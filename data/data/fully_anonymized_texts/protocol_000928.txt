Understanding Disparities in Quitting in African American and White Smokers  
Version date:  05/17/18  
 
SPECIFIC AIMS  
 Racial/ethnic differences in smoking are well documented; African Americans (AA) smoke fewer cigarettes 
per day than Whites but experience disproportionately greater smoking attributable morbidity and mortali ty. 
Well documented disparities also exist in smoking cessation with AA consistently quitting at lower rates than 
Whites. Our experienced, multi- disciplinary team has been working to improve tobacco use treatment 
outcomes in AA smokers for the last [ADDRESS_64937] documented lower quit rates 
for AA wi th nicotine gum, nicotine patch, and bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_60084]. Results of our recently completed pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (n=72) of varenicline in AA smokers, considered to be the 
most effective of currently available medic ations, mirrors these previous findings. Cotinine- verified abstinence 
at 12 weeks was 24% in this all AA sample, substantially lower than the 49% week [ADDRESS_64938] be made between participants enrolled in the 
same tr ial. To date, no adequately powered study, stratified on race/ethnicity has been conducted to 
prospectively examine AA- White differences in smoking cessation and concurrently to examine potential 
causal pathways explaining AA -White differences in quitting.  Such findings have important implications for 
improving tobacco treatment among AA smokers.  
 The long -term  goal of our research is to reduce disparities in tobacco- related morbidity and mortality by 
[CONTACT_60126]. By [CONTACT_60127]- to-head AA -White 
pharmacotherapy study, the objective of this application  is to examine varenicline for smoking cessation 
among AA and White smokers, and to better understand racial differences in quitting. We will conduct a prospective cohort intervention study, stratified on race, age (< 40, > 40), and gender, in which 448 participants 
(224 AA, 224 White) will receive 3 months of varenicline. The central hypothesis  is that AAs will demonstrate 
lower 7 -day abstinence from smoking at month 6 than Whites. We will also examine smoking, psychosocial, 
treatment process, and biological mechanisms underlying racial differences in quitting. Our specific aims are:  
Aim 1: Describe the differences in smoking cessation among AA and White smokers treated with 
varenicline . Hypothesis 1.  AAs will have significantly lower cotinine -verified 7- day abstinence at month 6 than 
Whites.  
Aim 2: Identify the smoking, psychosocial, treatment process, and biological factors that 
independently explain the relationship between race/ethnicity and cotinine- verified 7 -day abstinence at 
month 6. Hypothesis 2.1.(Smoking Factors). Menthol smoking will moderate, while cigarettes per day, nicotine 
intake, and nicotine dependence will mediate the relationship between race/ethnicity and cotinine- verified 7-
day abstinence among AA and White smokers. Hypothesis 2.2.(Psychosocial Factors).  Socioeconomic status 
(SES), social support, self-efficacy, barriers, negative affect, and perceived stress will mediate the relationship 
between race/ethnicity and cotinine- verified 7 -day abstinence among AA and White smokers. Hypothesis 
2.3.(Treatment Process Factors).  Side effects, adherence (medication, counseling), withdrawal, craving, and 
the reinforcing effects of nicoti ne will mediate the relationship between race/ethnicity and cotinine- verified 7-
day abstinence among AA and White smokers.  Hypothesis 2.4. (Biological Factors).  Phenotypic (3HC/COT) 
and genotypic (CYP2A6) markers for nicotine metabolism will moderate the relationship between race/ethnicity 
and cotinine- verified 7 -day abstinence among AA and White smokers.  
Aim 3: Examine the side effect profile of varenicline by [CONTACT_60128].  Hypothesis 3:  There will be no 
difference in side effect profiles (num ber or inte nsity) by [CONTACT_60129] [NOTE: Side effects will be examined 
as a mediator in Aims [ADDRESS_64939] 
examined varenicline in lower level smokers (3 -10 cpd)].  
 This study is innovative. It will be the first known study to report on the use of varenicline in AAs, the first to 
examine varenicline in light smokers (<10 cpd) and among a wide range of smoking levels (3- 20 cpd), the first 
head- to-head study, stratified on race, designed to prospectively compare pharmacotherapy in AAs versus 
Whites, and one of a few to explore mechanisms underlying disparities in quitting between AA and White smokers. The impact of these findings has ramifications for treatment, clinical practice, and policy. Significant  
knowledge will be gained about AA -White differences in quitting. Findings will improve tobacco use treatment 
by [CONTACT_60130] a generic focus on race/ethnicity toward a targeted focus on modifiable barriers and facilitators to quitting smokin g for AAs and Whites.  
A. SIGNIFICANCE  
A1. Disparities in Tobacco- Related Morbidity and Mortality. Tobacco is responsible for more than 442,000 
total deaths and more than 30% of all cancer death annually in the U.S.1,2 Although African Americans (AA) 
smokers use fewer cigarettes per day than Whites, they bear a disproportionate share of tobacco attributable 
morbidit y and mortality.3,[ADDRESS_64940] 
overall cancer  mortality rates compared to other racial/ethnic groups.3,[ADDRESS_64941] a strikingly 43- 55% higher relative risk compared to Whites.[ADDRESS_64942] that 38% of AA ever smokers have quit compared to 50% of White ever smokers.
[ADDRESS_64943] quit rates compared to those achieved by [CONTACT_60131].6,8-10,12 Results of our recently completed pi[INVESTIGATOR_60085]. Cotinine- verified Wk 12 abstinence was 24%. This is substantially 
lower than 49% Wk 12 abstinence rates found for White smokers in published randomized clinical trials (RCTs) 
and leads to more questions about disparities between AA and Whites in smoking cessation pharmacotherapy 
and the reasons for these disparities. It is important to note that we are comparing studies with different 
methodologies and sample characteristics and, therefore, caution should be used in interpreting the observed 
racial differences in quitting. In order to draw accurate conclusions about pharmacotherapy for one group 
relative to another it is necessary to make comparisons of participants enrolled in the same trial. The proposed study moves beyond the traditional approach of evaluating pharmacotherapy separately for each racial/ethnic 
group to comparing between AA and Whites enrolled in the same trial.  
Quitting disparities have been reported by [CONTACT_2312]. Posthoc analyses of clinical trials enrolling both AA and 
Whites have still found racial differences in quitting. A secondary data analysis from varenicline trials 
13,14 found 
Wk 12 smoking abstinence rates of 27% among AAs (n=26/97) compared to abstinence rates of 49% for 
Whites (n=381/782 ) (M. Posey, personal communication, May 1, 2010). AAs in the Lung Heart Study were significantly less likely than Whites to quit smoking at year 1 (23% versus 34%), despi[INVESTIGATOR_60086]- behavioral therapy for smoking cessation.
15 AAs in a randomized trial of 
counseling in combination with either bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_60087] 1 (Z= -2.21, p=0.03)16 Similarly, minority smokers, of whom 80.2% were AA, 
enrolled in a large multi -center randomized clinical trial of nicotine inhaler, bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], or both, were 44% less 
likely to quit smoking at Wk 12 (OR=0.56, p<0.01) compared to Whites, with 16% of minority and 26% of White 
smokers (p<0.01) demonstrating abstinence.[ADDRESS_64944] grouped all minorities together, limiting the ability to draw conclusions about AA-White differences in pharmacotherapy efficacy or smoking abstinence. Finally, and importantly, little 
attempt was made to explore possible mechanisms  (e.g., income, adherence, menthol, etc.) for the observed 
disparities in quitting. Our proposal will address these key issues.  
We anticipa te that our study will demonstrate similar disparities and our unique study design will then allow 
us to examine the factors that underlie these disparities. If, however, we don’t demonstrate these disparities, 
this study will still be equally significant – demonstrating that equal access to treatment with varenicline can 
eliminate disparities in outcomes. In the unlikely event that we don’t see disparities in outcomes of this study, a 
modified analytic plan would still allow us to test for racial differences in mediators/moderators of smoking 
cessation (see C8). The resulting race specific models would explore factors associated with quitting for AA 
and for Whites and would have significant implications for identifying and developi[INVESTIGATOR_60088]. 
Reasons for Disparities.   An understanding of possible reasons underlying AA -White differences in quitting 
smoking is guided by [CONTACT_60132], which posits that tobacco use results from 
multifaceted relationships between biopsychosocial factors.18,19 Our conceptual model  of smoking, 
psychosocial, treatment, and biological factors linking race to quitting (Fig.1) is grounded in the biobehavioral 
model and factors speculated to explain lower quit rates in AAs relative to Whites, although existing empi[INVESTIGATOR_60089] -hoc analyses of trials that were not designed to examine AA -W differences. To 
maximize the potential of our findings to inform future practice we have selected factors that can be addressed 
through intervention. Of the [ADDRESS_64945] are modifiable, with evidence suggesting that 
attention to these factors improves treatment outcome. Of the factors selected, some should make it easier for 
AA to quit smoking (e.g., cpd), while others should make it more difficult (e.g., menthol). A rationale for the 
possible role of each factor in accounting for racial differences is summarized below.  
 Smoking Factors.  AA smoke fewer cigarettes per day  than Whites but prefer mentholated cigarettes; 20,21 
82% of AA smoke menthol cigarettes compared to 23% of Whites.[ADDRESS_64946] of menthol smoking on cessation is mixed, with some studies finding lower cessation rates in 
menthol versus non- menthol smokers29,31,32 and others finding no association.33-36 Examination of the 
interrelationships between race/ethnicity, menthol, and cessation is limited but, in two existing studies, both 
found that menthol was associated with poorer cessation outcomes for non- White smokers only.31,37 The 
former, a population- based study, found that AA and Hispanic menthol smokers were significantly less likely to 
quit smoking (AOR=0.55, p<0.01) than AA and Hispanic non- menthol smokers. [ADDRESS_64947], White menthol 
smokers were more likely to quit than White non- menthol smokers (AOR=1.17, p<0.01). The second, a 
treatment study, found that AA m enthol smokers had half the odds of quitting compared with AA non- menthol 
smokers (AOR=0.48, p<0.05) while no difference was found in the odds of quitting for White menthol and non-
menthol smokers.[ADDRESS_64948] – i.e., menthol has a different effect on 
cessation in AAs and Whites – but to- date, only one treatment study has looked at these relationships. We will 
extend the existing research by [CONTACT_60133]. Identifying smoking factors that underlie racial disparities in cessation outcomes is critical to 
improving treatment of smoking cessation in AAs. As FDA considers potential regulatory action, our study  will 
inform this ongoing debate by [CONTACT_60134] a few treatment studies (the majority of evidence is based in 
population surveys) to examine if menthol reduces the rate of quitting success in AA relative to Whites, and if 
so, to examine the interrelationship of menthol, cpd, nicotine intake and dependence in explaining this 
disparity.  
 Psychosocial Factors.  Smokers of a low socioeconomic status (SES) are less likely to quit than high 
SES smokers.
38-[ADDRESS_64949]/stress .48-[ADDRESS_64950] of daily stress on quitting among low -income, predominately AA women,
46 while another study found significant 
positive associations between social support during a quit attempt and cessation for low income AA women (OR=1.41, CI=1.11 -1.78) and AA men (OR=1.50, CI=1.05 -2.15).
[ADDRESS_64951] major implications for clinical practice guidelines 
that address partner support interventions and skills training for support personnel.54-57 Similarly, we may find 
that racial disparities is quitting are mediated by [CONTACT_60135]/or negative affect. This could have major implications for clinical practice guidelines that address the role of stress and mood management techniques in 
supporting quitting.
58-60  
 Treatment Process Factors.  Adherence to medication and counseling is also linked to quitting. In a 
randomized, placebo- controlled trial, Shiffman found that the odds of quitting increased by 10% for each 
additional nicotine lozenge used per day61  and, in a separate study, found significant improvement in 
abstinence outcomes among subjects receiving active nicotine patch in adherent compared with nonadherent 
subjects.62 Pooled results from two randomized controlled trials found a positive correlation between 
adherence to pharmacotherapy and smoking abstinence63 and our varenicline pi[INVESTIGATOR_60090] a significant 
positive relationship between medication adherence and quitting.64 Counseling attendance and use of 
treatment self -help materials is also positively related to quitting smoking.10,65  
 Data about racial differences in adherence to tobacco treatment programs is limited. Nonetheless, there is 
some evidence that AAs may be less likely to complete treatment than Whites. Two recent studies found that 
AAs were 23% -40% less likely to use nicotine replacement therapy than Whites, controlling for income.66,67 
AAs in the Lung Heart Study were significantly less likely to return for follow -up (91% versus 96%, p<0.05) 
after the first year, which may partially explain the lower quit rates found for AAs relative to Whites (23% versus 34%), despi[INVESTIGATOR_60091].
15 Smoking cessation medications reduce 
withdrawal, craving, and the reinforcing effects of nicotine , with greater reductions linked to 
abstinence,13,14,68,69 but adherence to the prescribed dose and treatment length is necessary to achieve these 
effects. If AAs are less likely to follow treatment they may not get the full benefit – e.g., reductions in withdrawal 
and craving, acquisition of behavioral strategies for preventing relapse --relative to Whites. Given that 
withdrawal and craving predict relapse,70,71 it is plausible that racial differences in these factors could help 
explain quitting disparities in AA versus Whites, directly and indirectly through adherence. Identifying treatment process factors that underlie racial disparities in cessation outcomes is critical to improving treatment of 
smoking cessation in AAs. We may find, for example, that adherence to treatment is lower among AAs than 
Whites and that this difference predicts cessation, alone, or through treatment response pathways – i.e., less 
reduction in withdrawal, craving, nicotine reinforcement in AAs relative to Whites. This could have major implications for clinical practice guidelines that address the role of adherence and the importance of adherence- based interventions for maximizing treatm ent outcomes.
64,72-75  
 Biological Factors.  Nicotine is metabolically inactivated to cotinine, and cotinine is metabolized to 
3’hydroxycotinine, primarily by [CONTACT_097]2A6.76 CYP2A6 (genetic)  and 3HC/COT (phenotypic)  are both well -
established markers of nicotine metabolism . Slow er nicotine metabolism is consistently linked to higher quit 
rates, including for AA in our varenicline pi[INVESTIGATOR_60092] 12 abstinence by [CONTACT_097]2A6 activity was 27% for slow metabolizers, 20% for intermediate metabolizers, and 15% for normal metabolizers.
77-[ADDRESS_64952] slower rates of nicotine 
metabolism than Whites,87 and Tyndale (co -I) has identified novel CYP2A6 v ariants (*17,*20,*23- 28,*31,*35) 
occurring at a higher frequency in AAs that contribute to these slower rates.88-[ADDRESS_64953] comparison of quit rates while looking at nicotine metabolism (phenotype and genotype) in AA 
and Whites enrolled in the same study and by [CONTACT_60136]. Identifying biological factors that underlie racial dispari ties in cessation outcomes is critical to 
improving treatment of smoking cessation in AAs. It could be that any positive benefit of slower nicotine 
metabolism in AAs relative to Whites is attenuated by [CONTACT_60137] (e.g., stress, support) and/or treatment 
(e.g., adherence) factors. This could inform the ongoing debate about ways in which pretreatment biological 
markers of nicotine metabolism rate (CYP2A6, 3HC/COT) could be used to estimate a smoker’s response to 
therapy and have significant implications in the movement toward personalized medicine.

A3. Why Varenicline? The prevalence of cigarette smoking increased among US adults for the first time in 
nearly 40 years, from 19.7% in 2007 to 20.6% in 2010.93 In 2008, 45% of US adult smokers made a quit 
attempt yet only 9% were abstinent at [ADDRESS_64954] been conducted to date. A meta -
analysis from these trials found varenicline to be more effective than other available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
6 Average month 
6 quits rates for varenicline were 33%, compared to 27% for nicotine nasal spray, 25% for nicotine inhaler, 
24% for bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], 23% for nicotine patch, and 19% for nicotine gum. While these findings are promising, 
post-approval RCTs were conducted among predominately White, heavy smokers. Of the nearly 8,000 
smokers enrolled, 6% (475) were AA or ‘other’. The mean number of cigarettes smoked per day at baseline was 22.

 A4. Why Include Lighter Smokers? Clinical trials have focused on moderate to heavy smokers (> 15 cpd ) 
although recent data indicate a decline in moderate- heavy smoking subsequent to an increase in light 
smoking.104 Data from  the 2009 National Health Interview Survey indicate that the majority (80%) of US adult 
smokers consume <[ADDRESS_64956] chosen to exclude very light smokers (1- 2 cpd) because they represent a small sample of s mokers 
(less than 5% of the general population and 1% in our previous clinical trials) and because evidence regarding 
nicotine dependence and pharmacotherapy treatment in this subgroup is lacking. 9,109,110 Varenicline is 
approved for all smokers but has not been examined in those smoking < 10 cpd. Existing studies show no 
evidence of a greater number or more severe side effects by [CONTACT_60128].64 Nonetheless, we will routinely 
monitor side effects and will follow treatment protocols for reducing or discontinuing varenicline in the event of 
seve re adverse events (AE). In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], only 2 participants required discontinuation due to severe AE: 
all others were expected and not severe (e.g., nausea).  
A6. Conceptual Framework.  Our conceptual model linking race to quitting (Fig 1) is guided by [CONTACT_60138].18,19 18,19The majority of factors will be assessed at multiple time 
points. We will take full advantage of these longitudinal data by [CONTACT_60139]. The model has identified 4 pathways, 
each modeled independently, which might underlie AA -White differences in quitting. If multiple mediators 
and/or moderators are identified, our analytic plan will allow for examination of the interrelationship of factors across smoking, biological, psychosocial, and treatment domains (C8). Following standard definitions,
111 
mediator variables are those that operate the same in both groups and explain how a predictor influences an 
outcome. Moderator variables are those that operate differently in groups and influence the strength or 
direction of the association between the predictor and dependent variable. Menthol and nicotine metabolism 
are hypothesized as moderators because of literature documenting 1) that menthol is associated with poorer 
cessation outcomes for non- White smokers only,31,37 and 2) slower nicotine metabolism in AA relative to 
Whites despi[INVESTIGATOR_60093] 78,84-[ADDRESS_64957] quitting, irrespective of race, although some may be more true for AA (e.g., adherence) and others more true for Whites (e.g., nicotine dependence).  
 
A7.Summary of I mpact.  This study addresses an important public health problem – health disparities in 
relation to smoking – and through a prospective stratified cohort design will move the field beyond descriptive, 
post-hoc analyses. Findings from this study will not only address if disparities in quitting exist but, more 
importantly, will examine modifiable mechanisms underlying the difference, including probable 
interrelationships of factors across domains. Identification of mechanisms that underlie racial disparities i n

cessation is critical to improving treatment of smoking cessation in AAs. The selection of variables across 
biological, psychological, and social/environmental domains offers a comprehensive approach and is strongly 
grounded in the literature. Attention to proximal, modifiable factors (e.g., adherence, stress, social support) 
further maximizes the potential of our findings to inform practice by [CONTACT_60130] a generic focus on race toward an empi[INVESTIGATOR_60094]-related morbidity and mortality in future studies 
with AAs.  
 B. INNOVATION  
There has been much speculation about the mechanisms underlying racial disparities in quitting, but these mechanisms have not been tested in a prospective study and comparisons within existing studies are 
hampered by [CONTACT_60140] a select group of AA that smoke > [ADDRESS_64958] known to 
examine varenicline in AAs, light smokers (<10 cpd) and among a wide range of smoking levels (3- 20 cpd).  
C. APPROACH  
C1. Overview.  The proposed research is a prospective cohort 
intervention study, stratified on race, age (< 40, > 40), and gender, to evaluate varenicline for smoking cessation in 448 AA versus White smokers (224 AA, 224 White). All participants will receiv e 
varenicline for [ADDRESS_64959] for 6 months. Participants will be enrolled from Swope Health Central, a community -based primary care clinic in Kansas City 
and from the surrounding urban community. 448 smokers (224 AA, 224 White) will be required at baseline to detect the proposed treatment main effects.  
C1a. Design Considerations.  
Stratification.  Women and younger smokers are less 
likely to quit smoking than their male or older 
counterpart s.104,[ADDRESS_64960] decided to stratify our recruitment on 
these factors and enroll equal numbers of subjects into 
the 8 race, age, gender sub- cohorts.  
Other Racial/Ethnic Groups.  This proposal 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_60095], including our experience with AA smokers and the strong body of 
literature documenting quitting disparities between AA and Whites, and broadens our research to 
understanding possible underlying mechanisms. Importantly, this study represents a starting point for future 
work where we can expand to other ethnic groups (e.g., Native Americans, Latinos) that experience high rates 
of smoking -related morbidity and mortality.  
Placebo.  This is not an efficacy study, and therefore we do not have a placebo group. We are providing the 
best known treatment to examine AA- White differences in response to pharmacotherapy and to understand 
mechanisms that account for differential quit rates.  
Secondary  data analysis.  A secondary data analysis of existing varenicline RCTs would not accomplish our 
secondary aims. Limited data was collected on factors associated with quitting in these trials – e.g., menthol 
status was not asked; nicotine metabolism phenotype or genotype was not assessed; psychosocial variables 
were not collected; and no attention was given to treatment adherence. Most importantly, to address our primary aim and hypothesis, a study with the proper design needs to be conducted.  
Smoking level.  We have specified a lower and upper limit of cigarettes per day (3 -20 cpd) to minimize 
possible confounds in treatment response while still representing the majority of AA and White smokers. 
Although we expect that our sample of AA will smoke fewer cigarettes per day, on average, than our sample of Whites, they will have comparable blood nicotine levels
9,21,113,114 and will experience the same difficulty quitting 
as Whites.  6,98-100 The lower limit was  selected because very light smokers (1- 2 cpd) represent only 5% of Prospective Stratified Cohort Design

nationally known for their work in pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics.  
1) Does Varenicline Help AA Smokers Quit [Kansas Masonic Cancer Research Institute; Nollen (PI) Cox, Ahluwalia, Benowitz, Tyndale]:  
64 We completed a pi[INVESTIGATOR_60096] 72 AA 
smokers. COT -verified quittin g at Wk 12 was low (2 4%). In preparation for this application we examined 
quitting by [CONTACT_60141], finding that COT -verified abstinence was higher among slow metabolizers (see 
A.2 Biological Factors). In preparation for this application we also examined side effects by [CONTACT_60128]. No 
significant differences were found in the mean number of total (3.1 versus 2.9) or severe side effects (0.9 
versus 1.3) experienced by [CONTACT_60142] ( < 15cpd) versus heavy (>15cpd) smokers, providing preliminary 
evidence of the safety of varenicline among lower level smokers. Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_60097]; it informs the current proposal in a number of ways: 1) COT -verified quit rates i n 
this sample of AAs  were lower than expected compar ed to published studies of White smokers. 2) 
Associations were found between phenotypic (3HC/COT) and genotypic (CYP2A6) markers of slow nicotine metabolism and quitting. The nature of these relationships will be examined in more depth in the proposed 
study, including the unique interplay between race, nicotine metabolism, and quitting. The proposed study will be the first known to make direct comparisons of quit rates while looking at metabolism in AA and Whites 
enrolled in the same study. 3) Varenicline was safe in lower level smokers, providing preliminary evidence of tolerability, although the nature of these relationships will be examined in more depth in the proposed study.  
2) Kick It at Swope I [NCI R01 CA77856; Ahluwalia (PI), Mayo]:  8,34,[ADDRESS_64962] in our 
series of Kick It at S wope (KIS) projects that have, to date, enrolled 1,895  AA smokers from Swope Health 
Central. KIS I randomized 600 AA smokers (>10 cpd) to counseling plus bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_60098] (150mg bid) or 
placebo. Main outcomes, published in JAMA , found COT- validated abstinence rates at 26 weeks of 21.0% in 
the bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_60099] 13.7% in the placebo groups (p=0.02). 84% of the sample returned at 6 months. This study demonstrates : 1) our team’s capacity to conduct research with A A smokers in Kansas City,2) established 
Swope as an excellent partner for recruiting AAs, 3) quit rates are lower than whites in comparable RCTs, and 
4) our extensive follow -up procedures are successful in retaining participants .  
3) Kick It at Swope II [NCI R01 CA91912; Ahluwalia (PI) Nollen, Mayo, Benowitz, Tyndale] :
 9,11,116 This 
randomized trial examined the efficacy of nicotine gum (active versus placebo) and counseling [motivational 
interviewing ( MI) versus health education ( HE)] for smoking cess ation among 755 AA smokers ( <10 cpd). 637 
(84.4%)  were followed- up at Wk 26. COT -verified quit rates for nicotine gum were no better than for the 
placebo (14.2% v s 11.1%,  p=0.23) . However, HE performed significantly better than MI (16.7% vs 8.5%, 
p<0.001). This study continued to demonstrate our ability  to recruit and retain AA smokers  and has informed  
development of the current proposal in three ways: 1) Participants who completed the protocol were significantly more likely to quit smoking than those who did not (OR=0.48, CI=0.27 -0.84), leading to the 
inclusion of treatment adherence (medication, counseling) as a factor of interest in the proposed study, 2) Participants receiving HE counseling were more than twice as likely to quit smoking as participants receiving 
MI, justifying our rationale for HE counseling in the proposed study.  
4) Kick It at Swope III [ NCI R01
 CA091912; Cox ( PI), Nollen, Ahluwalia, Mayo, Benowitz, Tyndale ]: [ADDRESS_64963] successfully enrolled 540 AA smokers  in a randomized trial to examine the efficacy of bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394] (active 
versus placebo) in combination with HE counseling for smoking cessation  in African American light smokers . 
Verified abstinence rates at Wk 26 were 13.3% in the bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_60100] 10.0% in the placebo group 
(p=0.23). These quit rates are, again, quite modest compa red to those found among Whites . This study 
highlights our ongoing work with AA s and our ongoing recruitment resources available to support this  study.  
C3. Study Site.  This study will be conducted at Swope Health Central, a community -based clinic located in 
urban Kansas City. Swope has been the site for our three previous trials and has a longstanding relationship 
with the University of Kansas Medical Center. [CONTACT_60170] (PI) has secured commitment from Swope for this 
study (see letter of support). [CONTACT_60171] (co- I) secured research office space at Swope in 1997, and we have 
maintained it for the past 13 years. Swope has over 51,000 unique patients who complete 174,000  yearly 
visits; 75% (38,901) of patients are AA, 20% ( 10,374) are White, and 90% are below poverty.  
C4. Participants and Recruitment. We will recruit 448 eligible (224 AA, 224 White) smokers for this study. 
Our previous research in KIS –I, -II, and –III has provided us considerable knowledge of recruitment of 
smokers within this urban community in coordination with Swope. All recruitment documents will be identical in content and will be designed to 
attract the interest of our target population by [CONTACT_60143], 
graphics, and success stories of both AA and White smokers. 
We will use both clinic - and 
community -based recruitment 
strategies. Clinic -based 
recruitment.  Swope clinic staff 
will be fully informed about the study, the eligibility crite ria, and 
the enrollment process and will be able to refer smokers to the 
project office. Posters and flyers will be distributed throughout the health center. Finally, letters from Swope physicians will be mailed directly to clinic patients to inform them of the study. While it is feasible to recruit all 
participants from Swope (see Table), we will recruit from a partnering health center, Truman Medical Center 
(TMC), as needed. TMC served 95,000 unique patients in 2009. Patients are demographically similar t o those 
seen at Swope (see C3.) TMC served as a recruitment site in KIS -III. To recruit patients at TMC, a TMC 
employee will query their electronic  medical records to identify potential subjects. The TMC employee will mail  
letters signed by a sponsoring TMC physician on Truman letterhead to potential subjects to inform them of the 
study.  No PHI will be 
disclosed to KUMC study 
staff and  identities of 
potential subjects will only 
be known when they call our 
study line to find out if they are eligible. The sponsoring 
TMC physician and TMC 
employee will not query their records until they have 
received an approval of 
waiver o f privacy 
authorization from the TMC 
Privacy Board. Community -
based recruitment.  We will 
use additional community -
based strategies (word of 
mouth, radio and television ads, print materials) as needed, to reach our targeted enrollment of [ADDRESS_64964] conservatively estimated accruing 15 participants per month. Accrual in 
KIS II and III has averaged 26 per month; however accrual in this study may be slower because of our stratified 
design. Participants will be recruited until the targeted [ADDRESS_64965]. Ed Ellerbeck, authorized providers at the 
KUMC CRU, or the patient’s primary care provider must approve use of varenicline for each participant, in writing, prior to enrollment. Individuals not receiving authorization will not be enrolled into the study. Exclusion 
criteria are consistent with documented contra- indications for varenicline and the criteria used in previous Eligibility Criteria

C5. Intervention  
Kick It At Swope Guide.  The Kick It at Swope: Stop Smoking Guide was developed for our KIS -II and –III 
studies and goes hand -in-hand with HE counseling. The 36- page guide includes information about health 
consequences of tobacco use, benefits of quitting, and specific strategies to promote abstinence (e.g., making a quit plan, using medication, obtaining social support, managing withdrawal and craving, copi[INVESTIGATOR_18499] a lapse, relapse prevention). The guide will be revised and updated for use in this study to include specific discussion of 
varenicline for smoking cessation and also be modified for use with both AA and White smokers.  
Varenicline.   All participants will receive [ADDRESS_64969] dosing guidelines . Participants will initiate va renicline and set a target quit date one 
week later (i.e., Day 8). Medication will be dispensed in 30- day pi[INVESTIGATOR_60102] 0, 4, 8. Varenicline is  
approved by [CONTACT_60144]. Common side effects are nausea, insomnia, vivid dreams, dry 
mout h, flatulence, constipation, irritability, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. In July 2009, the FDA introduced 
a black box warning about neuropsychiatric complications (depressed mood, suicidal behavior) reported in 
patients attempting to quit smoking with varenicline. We will minimize these risks by [CONTACT_60145]. Use of varenicline will be under the supervision of Drs. Nollen (PI) and Ellerbeck  ( study physician). 
Participants will be prompted to discuss side effects at each visit and given the study phone number to report 
adverse events at interim time points. NIH guidelines for reporting adverse events will be followed. Any problems needing medical attention will be referred to [CONTACT_60172]  who will carry a study pager  and has 
played this role on previous RCTs. Treatment protocols will be followed for reducing or discontinuing varenicline in the event of severe adverse events.  In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_60103] 2% of participants required discontinuation 
due to severe AEs; all other s were expected and not severe (e.g., nausea).  
Health Education (HE) Counseling.  
The current Tobacco Use and 
Dependence Clinical Practice Guideline recommends the 
importance of counseling in combination with pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation.
[ADDRESS_64970] documented the efficacy of directive, health education 
(HE) counseling for smo king 
cessation.
16,118 Specific content for 
HE counseling by [CONTACT_60146]. HE sessions will use semi- structured scripts to incorporate counseling with use of the 
Kick It at Swope: Stop Smoking Guide. Sessions are tailored to the quit status of participants. For those who are quit, sessions will focus on strategies for preventing relapse, including alternatives to smoking and 
identifying and managing stressors that could lead to relapse. For those who are not quit, sessions will focus 
on motivating them to make another quit attempt , discuss problems that led to relapse/continued smoking, and 
encourage them to continuing taking varenicline and set another quit day.  
Counselor training and treatment fidelity.  Drs. Nollen (PI) and Cox (Co- I) are psychologists who have 
trained and supervised over [ADDRESS_64971], will lead the counselor training activities. All counselors will be Master’s level and will receive extensive training with [CONTACT_60173]. Mock sessions will be videotaped so that [CONTACT_60173] can provide guidance and feedback to the counselors 
on their performance. When [CONTACT_60173] believes the counselor has a high level of proficiency they will be certified 
to conduct HE counseling. Sessions will be recorded and listened to by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Cox during weekly supervision to monitor fidelity to the counseling protocol and assure equivalent delivery of counseling across race. Missed 
sessions.  Participants missing a session will be sent a letter and called/emailed up to 6 times. To maximize 
our potential to reach participants, we will update addresses at each visit and obtain names, addresses, and Overview of Health Education Counseling Sessions

C6. Study Procedures and Methods.    
Initial Screening.  The initial screen will review inclusion/exclusion criteria. Those eligible will be scheduled to 
complete final eligibility screening within 14 days. Given our  stratified design, it 
is possible that an individual who meets the eligibility 
criteria may not  be included 
in the study if enrollment for 
their cell has closed. All 
ineligible smokers will be 
referred to local resources.  
Final Screening and 
Enrollment  (Wk 0). Final 
eligibility screening will be conducted in person  and will 
consist of completing a 
pregnancy test on women of childbearing age and obtaining informed consent.  
Health Education Counseling Visits ( Wks 0, 1, 4, 8, 12, 16).  Counseling sessions, each lasting 
approximately [ADDRESS_64972] achieved visit completion rates 
of around 80%. Counseling sessions will be audio taped for clinical purposes only. Specifically, to ensure that 
participants  are receiving the highest quality of care and that counseling fits their unique needs. No data will be 
drawn from the audiotapes.  
Medication Dispensing ( Wk 0). Medication will be dispensed under the medical supervision of [CONTACT_60172] 
(study physician), Kansas License # 04- [ZIP_CODE] in 30- day pi[INVESTIGATOR_60102] 0, 4, 8  to facilitate appropriate use of 
varenicline. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_60105] (86% overall) in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
Assessment Visits (Wks 0, 4, 8, 12, 26).   Assessments will be completed at all in -person visits.  
Biological Sample Collection ( Wks 0, 4).  There will be two blood draws. The first will occur at Wk 0 to be 
used for analysis of nicotine metabolism phenotype (3HC/COT) (Benowitz ),genotype ( CYP2A6 ) (Tyndale) ,  
exosomes and Neutrophi Extracellular Traps (NETs), biomarkers that results from exposure to nicotine and the other chemicals in cigarettes. This assessment occurs when we expect smokers to be using tobacco at their 
regular levels, prior to quitting. The second blood dr aw will occur at Wk 4 for analysis of varenicline drug levels  
(Benowitz ). Wk [ADDRESS_64973] recruitment; only 4% refused 
blood draws in KIS -III. A small (approximately 1- 3 cm) hair sample will be taken from participants at Wk [ADDRESS_64974] after completion of specific study visits: $30 at Wks 0 and 4, $20 at Wk 8, $40 at Week 12, and $60 at Wk 26. If subjects complete all study visits, they will be compensated a total of $180 as compensation for their 
time/travel and in appreciation for their participation.  Subjects will also be given a t -shirt following their Wk 1 
phone call and a water bottle following their Wk 16 phone call. These items will be distributed at the in- person 
visits following the phone calls.  
C7. Measures.  Due to varied literacy levels of the target population, all questionnaire items will be read to 
participants. Factors that are stable over time (e.g., demographics) will be assessed at Wk 0; all others will be 
assessed at multiple time points. All measures are widely used, well -validated, and have been previously used Overview of Major Study Events

Primary Outcome: Abstinence (Wk 12,26).  The primary endpoint will be cotinine- verified 7- day point 
prevalence smoking abstinence, defined as no cigarettes for the previous 7 days at Wk 26. This method is 
consistent with recommended guidelines.119 The recommended cut -off of 15ng/ml for salivary cotinine will be 
used to differentiate smokers from non- smokers119 and will be conducted by [CONTACT_60147]. Neal Benowitz.120 
Secondary endpoint will be cotinine verified- 7 day point prevalence abstinence at Wk 12 (end of drug). 
Stratification Variables:  Race (Wk 0). Participants will self -identify as non- Hispanic AA or non- Hispanic White 
and complete the Pharmacogenetics Questionnaire where they note the racial/ethnic background of their 
grandparents.121 Age and Gender (Wk 0).  Participants will provide their date of birth and self -identified gender.  
Demographics:  Smoking history (Wk 0) will include standard items, including age when first smoked, age 
when started smoking regularly, and quitting/relapse history.122 Cigarettes per day (Wks 0,4 8,12,26). 
Timeline Followback asks participants to recall the number of cigarettes smoked per day over a designated time period and provides a more accurate estimation of smoking level than other measures.
123-125    
Smoking Factors:  Menthol (Wk 0).  Participants will also be asked to bring their cigare ttes with them to Wk 0. 
Research assistants will record the brand, the strength (e.g., regular, mild, light), and type (menthol, non -
menthol) of cigarette. Nicotine dependence (Wks 0,4,8,12,26).  The Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking 
Dependence Motives will be used to measure nicotine dependence.126 Nicotine intake (Wk 0) will be 
assessed by a 24- hour urine sample taken and will be quantified by [CONTACT_60148] (cotinine + 
cotinine- glucuronide + trans -3’-hydroxycotinine + 3HC -glucuronide) of the major nicotine metabolites using 
procedures described by [CONTACT_60149] (co- I).127 This measure of total nicotine equivalents (TNE) has the strongest 
correlation with nicotine dose in lab- based studies and represents the current gold standard for estimating 
nicotine dose.127 Another marker of nicotine intake is the ni cotine- derived nitrosamine, NNAL (4-
(methylnitrosamino) -1-(3)pyridyl -1-butanol), which will be measured using the same 24- hour urine sample 
collected for TNE. Exosomes, a tertiary marker of exposure to nicotine and the other chemicals in cigarettes, 
will b e also assessed through the Wk [ADDRESS_64975] been previously characterized in smokers 
and provide an understanding, beyond TNE or NNAL, of the ways in which nicotine and the other chemicals in cigarettes are harmful to a smoker’s health. Exosomes will be examined in relationship to smoking level, TNE, 
NNAL, cigarette type (menthol, non -menthol), and race. Psychosocial Factors:  
[NOTE: Psychosocial factors 
beyond those identified here may be related to race and quitting. This study represents a starting point. We have identified 
factors with strong supporting literature and well -validated measures. Future work will examine the relationship between 
other factors (e.g., motivation to quit), race, and quitting.]  
Socioeconomic status (Wk 0). Standar dized questions will be used to assess for income, education, 
employment, insurance status, and subjective social status.43,128 Support (variable timing, see below).  Three 
support factors known to be associated with cessation will be assessed: general support, support related to 
quitting, and presence of smokers in the social network.[ADDRESS_64976]  (Wks 
0,4,8,12,26) will be used to measure general support across three domains of appraisal, belonging, and 
tangible support.130 The Partner Interaction Questionnaire (Wks 0, 4,8,12,26)  will be used to assess positive 
(‘compliments you on not smoking’) and negative behaviors (‘criticized your smoking’) performed by [CONTACT_60150] (partner, friend, relative) during the quit attempt.
54 Social Influence (Wk 0).  
Participants will be asked to identify the smoking status of their partner, the number of smokers in the home, 
and the number of family members and friends who smoke.129,131 Self-Efficacy (Wks 0,4,8,12,26).  The 
Smoking Self -Efficacy Questionnaire will be used to assess participant’s belief in their ability to refrain from 
smoking when facing internal (feeling depressed) and external (being with smokers) stimuli.132 Perceived 
Barriers (Wks 0,4,8,12,26).  The Barriers to Cessation Scale will be used to assess barriers in 3 domains: 
addiction (‘feeling lost without a cigarette’), external (‘lack of support from family/friends’), and internal (‘feeling less in control of mood’).
[ADDRESS_64977] (Wks 0,4,8,12,26). The Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_60106] (CES- D) is a symptom checklist that measures depressive symptoms during the past [ADDRESS_64978] Scale  measures feelings of enjoyment (positive affect subscale) and 
distress/hos tility (negative affect subscale) in the past week.135 Stress (variable timing, see below). Stress is 
a multidimensional construct. For this study we focus on stressors known to influence smoking and health in 
low income populations. The Perceived Stress Scale (CSS) (Wks 0,4,8,12,26)  will be used to assess acute 
stress in the past month (‘something happened unexpectedly,’ ‘unable to control important things,’ ‘felt things 
were going your way)’.130 The Major Experiences and Everyday Discrimination Scales (Wk 0) includes items 
about chronic experiences of interpersonal mistreatment and  discrimination and attributions of the reason for 
the discrimination, e.g., race, education/income, gender.136  
Treatment Process Factors: Treatment compliance (variable, see below). Adherence will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_60151] 4, monthly pi[INVESTIGATOR_60107] 4, 8, 12, and the number of HE sessions 
completed. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_60108]137 and will provide a secondary 
measure of medication adherence in this study. Withdrawal (Wks 0,4,8,12,26). The Minnesota Withdrawal 
Scale  is used to determine the degree of withdrawal symptoms related to smoking cessation.138 Craving (Wks 
0,4,8,12,26).  The Brief Questionnaire of Smoking Urges139 is a measure of self -reported craving.139 
Reinforcing effects of nicotine (Wks 0,4,8,12,26).  The Cigarette Evaluation Questionnaire  assesses 
reinforcing effects of smoking, including satisfaction, psychological reward, enjoyment, craving relief, and 
aversion.140 Side effects (Wks 4,8,12):   Participants will be asked about symptoms commonly associated with 
quitting smoking and/or smoking cessation pharmacotherapy (i.e., nausea, sleep disturbance, irritability) and 
perception of the severity of the symptom (‘does not bother at all’ to ‘bothers a lot’). A similar check list has 
been used in varenicline RCTs.13,14,96-103 
Biological Factors: Genotype (Wk 0).  All DNA samples will be extracted from whole blood using established 
assays previously described by [CONTACT_60152] (Co- I).141-144 CYP2A6*1B,*2,*4,*9 and *12 will be genotyped in all 
subjects; 10 additional alleles (*17,*20, *23 -28,*31,*35) will be assessed in AA. These alleles are chosen as 
they are prevalent in this population, they alter nicotine pharmacokinetics and nicotine metabolism, and have 
been studied for associations with various smoking behaviors.78,89-91,141,145 Based on the data from whites and 
from our KIS I -II AA data we can group variants into normal (no variants), intermediate (one decreased activity 
*9 or *12 allele) or slow (two decreased activity *9 or *12 alleles, or one or more loss -of-function *2,*4,*17,*20, 
*23-*28,*31,*35 alleles) metabolic groups.79,[ADDRESS_64979] on 
cessation. New variants continue to be identified. We will assess known variants of importance for our population as well as plan for the assessment of additional variants as they become identified and 
characterized. Phenotype (Wk 0).  Nicotine metabolism phenotype (3HC/COT) will be conducted using 
standard procedures,
146,[ADDRESS_64980]. Benowitz (co- I) at the University of [LOCATION_004], San 
Francisco. Prior validation studies have shown that the main difference in quit rates is between the first quartile 
(slow metabolizers)  and the second through the fourth quartiles (fast metabolizers).83 We will use a similar 
approach to classify participants into a nicotine metabolism phenotype group (slow, fast) in the current study and assess the impact of groupi[INVESTIGATOR_60109].  
C8. Statistical Plan  
Sample Size.  The primary endpoint will be cotinine verified 7- day point prevalence abstinence at Wk 26.  We 
expect a 28% cessation rate in White and a 15% cessation rate in African American participants. Using the chi -
square test, along with the assumptions above, 224 subjects in each group will give us 90% power to detect 
this difference with a type I error rate of 5%.   Basis for Projected Abstinence Rates. We used quit rates from 
the existing varenicline trials as the basis for our projections. Wks 24 abstinence rates for White and AA 
smokers in the existing varenicline RCTs were 32% and 15%, respectively. Because quit rates are lower  
among the poor, we adjusted these rates down to 28% in Whites to account for the low SES of our target population. Using additional data from our varenicline pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251], we chose not to adjust down for AA. Wk 12 
abstinence among our sample of low income AA was 24%. In our previous AA clinical trials there has been a 
37% reduction in confirmed abstinence between the end of 
treatment and Wk 26. A similar reduction results in  
the projected 15% abstinence rate among AA in the proposed study and parallels abstinence rates found for AA 
in the existing varenicline trials. Missing Data.  All primary 
analyses on smoking cessation will be conducted using 
intent -to-treat and will code lost to follow -up as smokers. 
Subsequently we will evaluate the missing data pattern. If 
there is a differential loss based upon race, age, and/or baseline smoking level, multiple imputation techniques 
will also be used.  
Hypothesis 1. AAs will have significantly lower cotinine -verified 7 -day abstinence at month 6 than 
Whites: We will compare the cotinine verified [ADDRESS_64981] to follow -up will be considered as 
smokers. We also will look at completers only and will utilize multiple imputation techniques to ensure valid 
comparisons between the two groups if the loss to follow -up is not random. Given this is not a randomized 
study, we will also utilize multiple logistic re gression to compare the 7- day point prevalence abstinence rates 
between AA and Whites adjusting for our stratification variables (age, gender) along with baseline level of smoking. We will examine both main effects and pairwise interaction effects and determine if the expected

at the 0.10 level will be dropped from the model. To evaluate secondary endpoints, we will compare cotinine-
verified 7-d ay point prevalence abstinence rates between AAs -Whites at Wk 12 (end of drug) using the same 
methods as above.    
Hypothesis 2.1- 2.4. Smoking, psychosocial, treatment process, and biological factors will mediate 
and/or moderate the relationship between race/ethnicity and cotinine -verified 7 -day abstinence at 
month 6 in AA and White smokers.  If the racial differences hypothesized in Aim 1 are found, we will explore 
the mediation and moderation hypothesized in Aim 2. For this type of modeling the number of events is more 
relevant than the total sample size. Assuming a total of ~100 confirmed quitters at Wk 26 (see sample size 
calculation above) and the general guideline of [ADDRESS_64983] to 
accommodate 10 factors (including race and intercept) in the model. We will first individually assess the factors in each of the four proposed paths. We will use the methods proposed by [CONTACT_60153].
[ADDRESS_64984] of race on abstinence: 1) race 
must be associated with abstinence, 2) race must be associated with the mediator, 3) the mediator must be associated with abstinence, and 4) the relation between race and abstinence must be reduced or eliminated 
when controlling for the mediator. The mediation effect estimate will be computed according to MacKinnon
 who 
describes mediation as the difference of the race effect on the outcome variable with and without the presence of the mediators, or alternatively, the product of the effect of race on the mediators and the mediators on the 
outcome controlling for race.
[ADDRESS_64985] and criterion 4 will be 
tested using logistic regression. Criterion 2 will be evaluated using two sample t- tests for continuous variables 
(e.g., nicotine dependence) and chi -square tests for categorical variables (e.g., menthol), that are measured 
only at baseline. For factors measured longitudinally (e.g.,cpd, dependence, support, affect), the mediation could be inherent at baseline and/or due to longitudinal change.  For each of these longitudinal variables we will construct a linear mixed model, controlling for baseline levels of the specific variable, race and time, as well 
as a race by [CONTACT_60154], assuming a random slope and intercept. The 
interaction term or the main effect for race (if interaction not significant) will allow us to determine if the 
measure differs over time between AA and Whites. If measures differ, the random slope estimate for each 
individual on the measure will be the potential mediating variable. If the baseline measure is a significant factor in the model, then the baseline level of the measure will be a potential mediating variable. Thus, we will assess 
if the baseline effect and/or longitudinal change in the measure are mediating factors. To be conservative we 
will test these at the 0.10 level of significance.  For criterion 4 (mediation), race will be entered on the first step 
of a logistic regressio n model, and the potential mediating variable (baseline and/or slope estimate if 
longitudinal effect exists) will be entered on the second step. We will then compare the association of race with 
abstinence after the first step (without the potential mediat or in the model) to the association after the second 
step (with the potential mediator in the model) by [CONTACT_60155] (R) coefficient. If the relation between race and abstinence is reduced or eliminated by [CONTACT_60156], we will presume 
that mediation has occurred.  
 To assess moderation, we must determine if race and the potential moderator have a statistical interaction 
on the dependent variable cessation.
[ADDRESS_64986] of the potential moderating variable, and the interaction of 
the two. Each potential moderator whose interaction term is significant at the 0.10 level  of significance will be 
considered a potential moderator.   The same mediation/moderation approach will be used to examine how the hypothesized factors explain 
the relationship between race/ethnicity and quitting at Wk 12, where more factors can be accommodated by [CONTACT_10994]. Assuming confirmed Wk 12 quit rates of 49% in Whites and 24% in African Americans (based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_60110]), we expect a total of ~[ADDRESS_64987] to accommodate 15 factors (including race and intercept).  
 If multiple mediators and/or moderators are identified, we will construct a global structural equation model 
to examine the interrelationship of factors within and across causal paths using Mplus software package version 6.
149 Due to the estimated number of people quit, our global model can accommodate no more than 7 
variables. To optimize the likelihood of fitting a significant global model to the data, only factors identified as independent mediators/moderators will be considered for inclusion and we will systematically delete non -
significant paths (weakest paths first), until all paths are significant based on the methods described by [CONTACT_60157].
[ADDRESS_64988] terms for each factor found to be significantly related to abstinence at p<0.10 in bivariate analysis 
will be included in the model selection process. All of the subset of predictors in the final model will be 
statistically significant at p<0.05.  
Hypothesis 3.There will be no difference in side effect profiles by [CONTACT_60128].  For each subject we will 
create a count of the total number of side effects reported at Wk 4, 8 and 12, and also subset that for moderate to severe side effects.  We will globally report the mean of these at each week.  Finally, we will compare the 
number of side effects reported at each week among participants smoking 3- 5, 6-10, 11- 15, and >[ADDRESS_64989] of these developments and revise our inclusion criteria, consent documents, and 
monitoring protocol, as needed, to assure the safety of our participants. 
  
PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
 
1. Risks to Human Subjects  
Human Subjects Involvement, Characteristics, and Design .  The proposed research is a prospective 
cohort intervention study, stratified on race, age (< 40, > 40), and gender, to evaluate varenicline for smoking 
cessation in 448 AA versus White smokers (224 AA, 224 White). AA and White smokers have been selected 
as the target population because of the noted disparities in smoking and quitting in AAs relative to Whites. We 
have chosen to stratify on age and gender, in addition to race, because these factors are known to impact cessation. Stratification on these factors minimizes threats to internal validity and allows for the best possible study design.  Participants will be recruited from Swope Health Central, a community -based health center in 
Kansas City, Missouri.  Participation will last for [ADDRESS_64990] meet the following inclusion criteria: 
 Exclusion criteria are consistent with documented contra- indications for varenicline and the criteria used in 
previous RCTs. Participants must smoke 3- 20 cpd to minimize possible confounds in treatment response and 
smoke on > [ADDRESS_64991] dosing guidelines 
will be followed, which include 0.5 mg once per day for Days 1- 3, 0.5 mg twice per day for Days  4-7, and 1.0 
mg twice per day from Days 8 through the end of treatment (Week 12). Medication will be dispensed in 3, 30-day pi[INVESTIGATOR_16582] (Months 1, 2, 3) at entry into the study. Health education counseling was selected because it is 
consistent with the cur rent Tobacco Use and Dependence Clinical Practice Guideline and because our work • Non-Hispanic African American or  non-Hispanic White  
• ≥ 18 years of age  
• Smoked 3 -20 cigarettes per day  
• Smoked on >[ADDRESS_64992] 30 days  
• Functioning telephone  
• Interested in quitting smoking 
• Interested in taking 3 months of varenicline 
• Willing to complete all study visits  
Participants will be excluded if any of the following criteria are met:  
• Renal impairment  
• Evidence or history of clinically significant allergic reactions to varenicline  
•  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_60101] 2 months for any cardiovascular disease, including but not limited to: 
o Angina  
o Myocardial infarction 
o Peripheral vascular disease 
o Stroke  
• New onset of chest pain or arrhythmia in the past [ADDRESS_64993] year  
• Major depressive disorder in the last year requiring treatment  
• History of panic disorder, psychosis, bipolar disorder, or eating disorders  
• Use of tobacco products other than cigarettes in past 30 days  
• Use of pharmacotherapy in the month prior to enrollment, including prior use of varenicline  
• Pregnant, contemplating getting pregnant, or breastfeeding 
• Plans to move from KC during the treatment and follow -up phase 
• Another household member enrolled in the study  
and the work of others have documented the efficacy of this approach for smoking cessation. The number of 
sessions is consistent with our previous studies where we have achieved visit completion rates of around 80%.  
 In addition to investigators at the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC; Drs. Nollen, Cox, and 
Mayo), investigators are located at the University of Minnesota ([CONTACT_60171]), University of [LOCATION_004] San 
Francisco ([CONTACT_60174]), and University of Toronto ([CONTACT_29896]). The study will be conducted at KUMC and 
all source documents will be housed at KUMC. [CONTACT_60174] (UCSF) will be responsible for the analysis of samples for nicotine intake, 3HC/COT, and cotinine (described below). [CONTACT_29896] (Univ. of Toronto) will be 
responsible for the analysis of samples for CYP2A6 genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (described below). [CONTACT_60172]  (Univ. of 
Kansas Medical Center) will serve as the study physician.  He will be responsible for det ermining medical 
eligibility of participants to take varenicline and addressing any questions warranting medical attention. All 
investigators have completed the required human subjects training at their respective institutions.  
Sources of Materials .  Survey assessments will be completed at in- person visits (Weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, and 26). 
Surveys will include questions about participants demographic characteristics, smoking patterns (cigarettes per day, menthol status), as well as psychosocial (e.g., negative affect, depression, stress) and behavioral factors 
(social support, withdrawal, craving).  Biological samples will be taken for analyses by [CONTACT_60158] -
investigators Drs. Neal Benowitz (UCSF) and Rachel Tyndale (University of Toronto).  Urine will be taken at Week 0 for analysis of nicotine intake, represented as the sum of cotinine + cotinine- glucuronide + trans -3’-
hydroxycotinine + 3HC -glucuronide (Benowitz laboratory).  Blood will be also taken at Week 0 for analysis of 
nicotine metabolism phenotype (3HC/COT) (Benowitz laboratory) and genotype (CYP2A6) (Tyndale laboratory). Blood will be drawn again at Week 4 for analysis of varenicline steady -state levels (Benowitz 
laboratory).  Saliva will be taken at Weeks 12 and 26 among self -reported quitt ers for analysis of cotinine-
verified smoking status.  All specimens will be assigned a unique identification number only and will contain no 
individually identifiable private information. Specimens will be accessible only to identified research staff at t he 
respective institutions.  
The KUMC Department of Preventive Medicine has a well -developed structure for data management.  
Working data is maintained on a single large file server that services the entire section.  Inactive files are 
moved to archival storage under control of an automated system, itself controlled by a DBMS (Ingres) based 
request system which ensures that all data movement is appropriately logged and commented.  The archival storage is hosted on the institutional mainframe computer, which also supports billing and registration.  The 
use of the mainframe ensures several high level support functions for the archive system (e.g., storage in separate fire zones, regular copying of data to new media, guaranteed availability, etc.)  The data management 
will be governed by [CONTACT_60159].  All 
subjects will be identified with a sequentially assigned subject number, and subject initials.  To ensure subject confidentiality, no names, social security numbers, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_60111].  Names, addresses, telephone numbers, and any other information needed for recruitment, study 
involvement, and tracking will be obtained and maintained locally by [CONTACT_60160].  All computer files 
and systems will be password protected and accessible only by [CONTACT_4144]. Assigning each 
participant a study number and numerically coding all data will maintain confidentiality. The association of the ID-code and names of the participants will be kept by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Nollen (PI) in a locked file drawer. Only summaries of 
findings will be reported in any publications or presentations, with no identification of individuals.  Audio tapes of 
counseling sessions will be  identified by a number, not a name, and will be stored in a locked file cabinet. No 
one other than the study team will have access to the audio tapes. Audio tapes will be kept for [ADDRESS_64994] common adverse events are 
nausea, insomnia, vivid dreams, dry mouth, flatulence, constipation, irrability, headaches, dizziness, and 
fatigue. In July 2009, the FDA introduced a black box warning about neuropsychiatric complications 
(depressed mood, suicidal behavior) reported in patients attempting to quit smoking with varenicline. We will 
minimiz e these risks by [CONTACT_60161]. Use of varenicline will be under the supervision of Drs. 
Nollen (PI) and Ellerbeck  (study physician). Participants will be prompted to discuss side effects at each visit 
and given the study phone number to report adverse events at interim time points. FDA guidelines for reporting adverse events will be followed. Any problems needing medical attention will be referred to [CONTACT_60172]  who 
will carry a study pager. Treatment protocols (per [COMPANY_007] Global Pharmaceuticals) will be followed for reducing or discontinuing varenicline in the event of severe adverse events. In Phase 2 and 3 placebo -controlled 
studies, the treatment discontinuation rate due to adverse events in patients dosed with 1 mg, twice daily was 
12% for Chantix compared to 10% for placebo in studies of three months treatment.  
Other risks of the study include the risk of drawing blood and extracting DNA to be used by [CONTACT_60162]. The risks of drawing blood include brief pain, slight bruising, and rarely, 
infection where the needle went in. We take every precaution to minimize these risks. Some people feel dizzy 
when they have blood drawn, but this goes away when the person lies down. There is a small risk that  if 
people other than the researchers got a hold of participant's genetic facts they could misuse them. In order to 
minimize these potential risks, participants will be identified by a number, not by [CONTACT_2300], whenever possible and 
access to study -related information will be limited to the following agencies and/or collaborators: [CONTACT_60170] and 
all key personnel on this study, [COMPANY_007], the Food and Drug Administration, the Human Subjects Committee of the University of Kansas Medical Center, the University of Kansas Medical Center Research Institute, [CONTACT_60175] and her staff at the University of Toronto, and [CONTACT_60176] and his study staff at the 
University of [LOCATION_004] at San Francisco. In addition, participation is voluntary and participants may w ithdraw 
from the study at any time without penalty.  
Other risks for participating in the study are minimal and include those associated with the inconvenience 
of completion of several questionnaires and interviews, telephone follow -up assessments, providing saliva and 
urine for analysis of nicotine intake, and the inconvenience of coming to Swope for in- person and telephone 
counseling sessions. We believe the risks involved in this study are reasonable given the potential impact of 
the knowledge to be gained on smoking cessation treatment. 
Alternatives to participating in this study are to quit cold turkey, use other smoking cessation programs, 
purchase nicotine gum or patches from the pharmacy, and obtain a prescription for nicotine inhaler, nicotine 
nasal spray, nicotine lozenge, Zyban or Chantix.  
 
2. Adequacy of Protection Against Risks  
Recruitment and Informed Consent. We will recruit 448 eligible (224 AA, 224 White) smokers for this study. 
Our previous research in KIS –I, -II, and –III has provided us c onsiderable knowledge of recruitment of 
smokers within this urban community in coordination with Swope. We will use both clinic - and community -
based recruitment strategies. Clinic -based recruitment.  Swope clinic staff will be fully informed about the study, 
the eligibility criteria, and the enrollment process and will be able to refer smokers to the project office. Posters and flyers will be distributed throughout the health center. Finally, letters from Swope physicians will be mailed 
directly to clin ic patients to inform them of the study. To recruit patients at TMC, a TMC employee will query 
their electronic medical records to identify potential subjects. The TMC employee will mail letters signed by a sponsoring TMC physician on Truman letterhead to potential subjects to inform them of the study. No PHI will be disclosed to KUMC study staff and identities of potential subjects will only be known when they call our 
study line to find out if they are eligible. The sponsoring TMC physician and TMC employee will not query their 
records until they have received an approval of waiver of privacy authorization from the TMC Privacy Board.  
Community -based recruitment.  We will use additional community -based strategies (word of mouth, radio and 
television ads, print materials) as needed, to reach our targeted enrollment of [ADDRESS_64995] successfully complete screening and provide informed consent before being 
enrolled in the study and delivered an intervention. This ensures that all participants meet all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria as stated in the study protocol and have provided informed consent.  
Protections Against Risk.  Upon enrollment, all enrolled smokers will have the highest level of protection of 
confidentiality for their participation in this study. Standard language in our consent procedure assures the 
participants of the confidential nature of the study.  Those who elect to participate will be clearly told that they 
may withdraw from the study at any time without jeopardizing current or future care at any medical facility.  
Potential participants will also be informed of alternative treatments (i.e., using other smoking cessation 
programs, purchasing nicotine gum, patches, or lozenge from the pharmacy, obtaining a prescription for 
nicotine inhaler, nasal spray, or other smoking cessation products from their physician). The consent form will 
be reviewed with each participant and they will be given a copy of the signed consent form.  A copy of the 
signed consent will be maintained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Nollen for documentation. These standards are strictly adhered to 
and monitored by [CONTACT_56762].  Confidentiality will be maintained by [CONTACT_60163] a study number and numerically coding all data. The association of the ID -code and the 
participant’s name [CONTACT_60169] [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Nollen in a locked file cabinet. Only summaries of group data will be 
reported in any publications or presentations, with no identification of individuals.  All records will be kept in 
locked filing cabinets in offices that are kept locked when unoccupi[INVESTIGATOR_530].  Subject files will be kept in a secure 
area, with access only by [CONTACT_60164] (PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706]- Investigators).   
 In our varenicline pi[INVESTIGATOR_22613] 2% of participants required discontinuation due to severe AE 
(neuropychiatric symptoms consistent with the 2009 FDA Black Box Warning); all other AEs were expected 
and not severe (e.g., nausea). Nonetheless, we have a detailed plan for clinical management of psychiatric or 
medical problems. The study staff will monitor any reports or observations of severe depression or other psychiatric symptoms in the subjects (i.e., suicidal ideation) or medical problems using the following set of 
questions as a template for better assessing the participant’s current  mood, thoughts and feelings:  
Developi[INVESTIGATOR_60112]:  
• Participant may report depressed symptoms when staff is capturing adverse events  
• Noting a significant change in a participant’s affect  
 
Questions that can be asked to gather important information if a participant expresses suicidal ideation:  
• Ideation:  You indicated you might be having some thought or feelings of hurting yourself.  Tell me more.   
• History:  Have you ever felt like this in the past?  
  Have you ever tried to  harm yourself in the past?  
• Plan:  When you are thinking about hurting yourself, do you have any idea what you might do to harm   
  yourself?  (Does the person have the resources to carry out this plan?) 
• Intent:  Do you think you would act on this plan? 
  Can you imagine yourself actually doing this? 
  Do you think you might harm yourself in the near future?  
  (If “no”, ask “what would keep you from doing this?”  
 In the event of such an occurrence, the study assistant will arrange for additional ass essment of the 
subjects symptoms by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Nollen (psychiatric) or Ellerbeck  (medical).  Individuals who report suicidal intent or 
other severe psychiatric symptoms will be discontinued from varenicline and referred for treatment and 
followed throughout the s tudy period.  In the event of an emergency (e.g., suicidal plan), KUMC treating 
psychiatrists will be consulted to refer the participant for treatment at KUMC, Swope Health Central or at a 
local hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Referral for treatment will be made when appropriate.  Continued participation with the study will 
be voluntary and in cooperation with the health care professional treating the subject’s psychiatric condition. 
FDA guidelines for reporting adverse events to the sponsor (NIH), KUMC Human Subject’s Committee, and 
[COMPANY_007] Global Pharmaceutical will be followed. Following each in- person or telephone visit, the research 
counselor or study coordinator will record all data in the participants’ data collection book.  The study 
coordinator will serve as the internal monitor and will review and monitor books during the day.  [CONTACT_60170] will 
review all Adverse Events for all the data books on a weekly basis.   
 Participants with stable cardiovascular disease (i.e. no hospi[INVESTIGATOR_60113] i n 
the past 2 months) will not be excluded. However, given the [ADDRESS_64996] developed a plan to 
assess and intervene in the event of a cardiac problem: 
 
1) Advising participants of risk: All enrolled participants will be provided with the recommendations as 
delineated in the FDA advisory (June 2011). This advisory states that varenicline may be associated with a small, increased risk of certain cardiovascular events in patients with cardiovascular disease.  As 
outlined in the FDA advisory, all participants will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_60165], including 
but not limited to, shortness of breath or trouble breathing, new or worsening chest pain, and new or worsening pain in the legs.  
2) Ongoing monitoring:   Adverse events, including new or worsening symptoms of cardiovascular 
disease or intervening hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], will be assessed at each study time point and through 
spontaneous reports from participants during interim time points.  
3) Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_60114]: In the event that a cardiovascular event is reported, the 
participant will be immediately instructed to stop taking varenicline and to contact [CONTACT_464].  Study 
staff will contact [CONTACT_6283]. Nollen or Ellerbeck who will take necessary action, including conducting additional assessment of the symptoms.  An Adverse Events Record Form will  be completed that provides a 
description of the event, classification of the seriousness, evaluation of the potential relationship to the 
intervention, and an assessment of need for change in the informed consent or study activities. All 
serious adverse events will be reported to the KUMC IRB and NIH within [ADDRESS_64997] the safety of study subjects.  In the 
case of a Serious Adverse Event (as defined by [CONTACT_60166]), the study will be stopped and no 
further enrollment will take place until an investigation of the event has taken place by [CONTACT_9532], the Co -investigators and the study coordinator.  A determination of the association of the adverse 
event with the study intervention will be made and appropriate modification to the protocol will be made if an association is suspected.  If protocol modifications to ensure the safety of future study subjects cannot be made, the study will be terminated.   
 
3. Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to Human Subjects and Others   
 Participants will have the opportunity to benefit by [CONTACT_60167][INVESTIGATOR_60115]. Participants who stop smoking will experience invaluable health benefits, and family 
members of participants who stop smoking would be expected to benefit from reduced exposure to second-
hand smoke. The participants will receive study medication and counseling free of charge.  Participants will receive $[ADDRESS_64998] at Weeks 0, 26 and a $[ADDRESS_64999] at Weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, 16 as compensation for their 
time/travel and in appreciation for their participation. Participants will be informed that dis bursement of the 
incentives is not contingent on their smoking status.  
   
4. Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained  
 Racial/ethnic differences in smoking are well documented; African Americans smoke fewer cigarettes per 
day than Whites but experience disproportionately greater smoking attributable morbidity and mortality. Well 
documented disparities also exist in smoking cessation with African Americans consistently quitting at lower 
rates than Whites. However, to -date, no adequately powered study, stratified on race, has been conducted to 
understand the mechanisms accounting for differential quit rates in African Americans relative to Whites.  This 
application will 1) examine varenicline for smoking cessation among African American and White smokers, 2) 
examine how smoking, psychosocial, treatment process, and biological factors explain the relationship 
between race/ethnicity and cotinine- verified 7 -day abstinence in African American and White smokers, and 3) 
examine the side effect profile of varenicline by [CONTACT_60128]. The impact of these findings will be considerable, having ramifications for treatment, clinical practice, and policy. Significant knowledge will be gained about African American- White differences in quitting. These findings have the potential to improve 
tobacco use treatment by [CONTACT_60130] a generic focus on race/ethnicity toward a targeted focus on modifiable smoking, psychosocial, and treatment process factors most relevant to AA and to Whites. The 
risks involved in gaining this knowledge are reasonable given the potential impact of the knowledge to be 
gained on smoking cessation treatment.  5.  Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
 This study is not a clinical trial but involves the use of an FDA approved product, varenicli ne. The 
monitoring of the progress of the clinical trial and the safety of participants will be performed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Nollen (PI) in association with [CONTACT_60172]  and the other study co- investigators . [CONTACT_60170] will review AE data weekly 
and discuss at regular meetings with [CONTACT_60172] . The University of Kansas Medical Center also has a Data 
and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) which provides oversight for clinical trials for which an external DSMB is not in place. If the Human Subjects Committee determines that working with the DSMB is needed, [CONTACT_60170] 
will do so accordingly. The KUMC DSMB membership includes internal and external scientists and clinicians, a statistician, an ethicist, and lay representation. All members of the DSMB review written protocols,  informed 
consent procedures, and plans for data and safety monitoring. The investigator is invited to present in an open session in which members of the DSMB may ask questions for clarification. The DSMB general reporting guidelines are then individualized for the specific study taking into consideration the population under the 
study, any known anticipated adverse outcomes or risks of the specific study protocol, procedure, and/or drug, 
and any other data monitoring or oversight of the particular study. If necessary, the DSMB will review 
manuscripts and results from the study to assure that results are fairly presented and conclusions are 
appropriate.

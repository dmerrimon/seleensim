Rationale
 
The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) is a non-profit 
research and educational organization working as a clinical trial sponsor to obtain 
approval for the prescription use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) as 
an adjunct to therapy in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a 
serious debilitating disorder that negatively impacts a person’s daily life, and can result in 
diminished cognitive and psychosocial functioning, fractured relationships, inability to 
maintain employment, substance abuse, high-cost healthcare utilization, increased 
depression, and suicide risk. People who suffer from PTSD relive their traumatic 
experience(s) through nightmares and flashbacks, have difficulty sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and feel 
detached or estranged. Symptoms can be severe and long lasting. 
 
MDMA is a monoamine releaser and re-uptake inhibitor with indirect effects on 
neurohormone release. The combined neurobiological effects reduce defenses and fear of 
emotional injury, enhance communication and introspection, and increase empathy and 
compassion. MDMA may enhance fear extinction learning in humans. The subjective 
effects of MDMA create a productive psychological state that enhances the therapeutic 
process. Data from an international series of Phase [ADDRESS_134914] moderate PTSD. A flexible dose of MDMA hydrochloride salt (referred to 
as MDMA throughout) or placebo, followed by a supplemental half-dose unless 
tolerability issues emerge, is administered during the Treatment Period with manualized 
therapy in three blinded monthly Experimental Sessions. This ~12-week Treatment 
Period is preceded by [CONTACT_120546]. During the Treatment Period, each 
Experimental Session is followed by [CONTACT_120547]-drug therapy. 
Experimental Sessions are followed by [CONTACT_120548]; a sub-study ( Appendix A ) will 
assess feasibility of Experimental Sessions without an overnight stay. The Primary 
Outcome measure, the change in Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5) from 
Baseline (Visit 3), is assessed by a blinded centralized Independent Rater (IR) pool at [ADDRESS_134915] Baseline (Visit 19). The CAPS-5 is also administered as an exploratory 
measure after Treatments 1 and 2 (Visits 8 and 13). The IR pool will be blinded to visit 
number and number oftreatments received and will not have access to data collected by 
[CONTACT_120549]. 
 
Group 1: MDMA-assisted therapy or Group 2: placebo with therapy, with a planned

MDMA-assisted therapy as in the initial study. Data will be included in the sponsor’s 
overall safety database.
 
Primary Outcome (CAPS-5) Data Collection by [CONTACT_120551], blinded IRs selected based on availability from the IR Pool will perform the 
CAPS-5 assessments as described in the following table.

Dose Selection 
 
This study will compare the effects of three blinded manualized Experimental Sessions of 
therapy assisted by [CONTACT_120552], 
along with associated non-drug preparatory and integrative therapy. Similar MDMA 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation  MAPP2 Protocol Synopsis  
IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: [ADDRESS_134922] been safely used in previous Phase 2 and 3 
studies sponsored by [CONTACT_120553].
 
Dose Regimen of MDMA or Placebo 
Experimental 
SessionInitial Dose Supplemental Dose* Min-Max Cumulative Dose
1 80 mg 40 mg 80 mg to 120 mg
2 80 or 120 mg 40 or 60 mg 80 mg to 180 mg
3 80 or 120 mg 40 or 60 mg 80 mg to 180 mg
Total Cumulative Dose 240 mg to 480 mg
* Unless tolerability issues emerge with the first dose or it is refused by [CONTACT_2299].
 
Protocol Objective 
 
The overall objective of this study is to use standard clinical measures to confirm the 
efficacy and safety of manualized MDMA-assisted therapy with a flexible dose of 
MDMA in reducing PTSD and associated symptoms in comparison to the same therapy 
combined with an inactive placebo control. 
 
Primary Objective 
 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of MDMA-assisted therapy 
for PTSD compared to the identical therapy with inactive placebo, based on comparison 
of CAPS-5 Total Severity Score at Visit 3 (Baseline) to Visit 19 ([ADDRESS_134923] 
Baseline). 
 
Secondary Objective 
 
The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of MDMA-assisted 
therapy for PTSD compared with identical therapy with inactive placebo in clinician-
rated functional impairment, as measured by [CONTACT_120554] (SDS) item scores from Visit 3 (Baseline) to Visit 19 ([ADDRESS_134924] Baseline).  
 
Safety Objectives
The overall safety objective is to assess differences between groups in severity, incidence 
and frequency of AEs, Treatment Emergent AEs (TEAEs), AEs of Special Interest 
(AESIs), and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), concomitant medication use, suicidal 
ideation and behavior, and vital signs to support the package insert for MDMA-assisted 
therapy. The following safety objectives will evaluate the safety of MDMA-assisted 
therapy compared to identical psychotherapy with inactive placebo: 
 
1. Compare relative incidence of AEs during Experimental Sessions that may be indicative 
of a medical complication of the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP), such as 
clinical signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, or neurological symptoms 
or any other signs or symptoms that prompt additional vital sign measurements 
2. Compare relative incidence of AEs by [CONTACT_926] 
3. Compare relative incidence of TEAEs, to determine relationship to the IMP based on 
relative incidence in the MDMA group 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation  MAPP2 Protocol Synopsis  
IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: 23 March 2021 
Page 5 of 110 4. Compare relative incidence of TEAEs by [CONTACT_120555], 1 day, and 2 days after IMP administration 
5. Compare relative incidence of AESIs, defined as AEs specified in the protocol related to 
cardiac function and abuse liability 
6. Compare relative incidence of AEs by [CONTACT_120556], resulting in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and continuing at Study Termination 
7. Compare relative incidence of SAEs 
8. Compare relative incidence of psychiatric concomitant medications taken during an 
Experimental Session, 1 day, and 2 days after IMP administration 
9. Compare relative incidence of any psychiatric concomitant medications taken during the 
Treatment Period 
10. Compare relative incidence of positive or serious suicidal ideation and positive suicidal 
behavior assessed with the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) by 
[CONTACT_1570] 
11. Compare mean changes in blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature from pre-IMP 
administration to end of each Experimental Session by [CONTACT_120557]. Participants will be recruited through print and internet advertisements, 
referrals from other treatment providers, and by [CONTACT_6063]. The sponsor will monitor 
demographics on an ongoing basis and encourage diversity (representative of PTSD 
population) in enrollment of study participants by [CONTACT_120558]. 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_68566]. 
 
Participants will be persons aged [ADDRESS_134925] a 
Total Severity Score equal to or greater than 28 (moderate). Participants would not be 
excluded for having more than one traumatic event or for having tried, not tolerated, or 
refused a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin norepi[INVESTIGATOR_120474] (SNRI) prescribed for PTSD. Participants with confirmed diagnosis of 
specific psychological and personality disorders will be excluded. Participants must be in 
good physical health and without major medical disorders that could affect the safety or 
tolerability of MDMA.
Statistical Analysis of Efficacy
The statistical power calculations were made by [CONTACT_6486] a Mixed-Effect Model Repeated 
Measure (MMRM) model to Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-4 (CAPS-4) 
data from the Phase [ADDRESS_134926] covariance parameters. With a 
sample size of 50 participants per treatment group in the modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) 
population, this study has 90% power to detect a treatment effect, using a two-sided test 
with an alpha of 0.0499. Additional participants may be enrolled, depending on sample 
size re-estimation by [CONTACT_3153], with conditional power analysis conducted at 
a group-unblinded interim analysis for efficacy when 100 participants are enrolled and at 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation  MAPP2 Protocol Synopsis  
IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: [ADDRESS_134927] 60% of the blinded participants (N=60) have completed their final CAPS-5 
assessment and terminated treatment. The Sponsor does not plan to reduce the number of 
participants below the initial planned 100, in order to obtain additional safety data.
 
Primary Efficacy Analysis 
 
All efficacy analyses will be based on the mITT analysis set. The primary treatment 
comparison will be made at a 2-sided, 0.0499 level of significance. The reduction from 
Visit 3 (Baseline) in CAPS-5 Total Severity Scores between groups will be compared at 
Visit 19 (Primary Outcome) with least squares means from an MMRM model. The mITT 
analysis set will include all randomized participants who receive IMP in at least one 
blinded Experimental Session and have at least one follow-up CAPS-5 assessment.

Page 18 of 110 1.0 Introduction
The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) is a non-profit 
research and educational organization working as a clinical trial sponsor to obtain 
marketing approval for the prescription use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine 
(MDMA) as an adjunct to therapy in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 
Controlled Phase 1 studies, nonclinical studies, and investigator-initiated studies formed 
the basis for the Clinical Development Program of MDMA under Investigational New 
Drug (IND) #063384. MAPS-sponsored studies are implemented through MAPS’ wholly 
owned subsidiary and delegate, the MAPS Public Benefit Corporation (MPBC). 
 
1.1 Rationale 
PTSD is a serious debilitating disorder that negatively impacts a person’s daily life. 
MDMA has been shown to reduce defenses and fear of emotional injury, enhance 
communication, and increase empathy. MDMA may enhance fear extinction learning in 
humans. These subjective effects of MDMA create a productive psychological state that 
enhances the therapeutic process for the treatment of PTSD and other anxiety disorders. 
This is supported by [CONTACT_120560] [ADDRESS_134940] moderate PTSD, the sponsor is conducting this pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 randomized, 
placebo-controlled, two-arm, double-blind, multi-site study which will include an interim 
analysis of CAPS-5 data for sample size re-estimation. This novel treatment package 
consists of three once-monthly Experimental Sessions of therapy combined with either a 
flexible dose of MDMA or inactive placebo, along with non-drug preparatory and 
integrative therapy. The Primary Outcome measure, the Clinician Administered PTSD 
Scale (CAPS-5), evaluates changes in PTSD symptom severity and is assessed by a 
blinded centralized Independent Rater (IR) pool. 
 
1.2 Background 
1.2.1 PTSD 
PTSD is a serious debilitating disorder associated with increased mortality and 
cardiometabolic morbidity. PTSD is a stress-related psychiatric condition that may occur 
following a traumatic event such as war, disaster, sexual abuse, violence, terrorism, and 
accidents. The four main symptom categories described in the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5), include arousal and reactivity, 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation  MAPP2 Protocol 
IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: 23 March 2021 
Page 19 of 110 avoidance of triggers, negative thoughts and feelings, and intrusive thoughts and 
nightmares. PTSD negatively impacts a person’s daily life, resulting in fractured 
relationships, inability to maintain employment, diminished cognitive and psychosocial 
functioning, substance abuse, high-cost healthcare utilization, and increased depression 
and suicide risk. People who suffer from PTSD often relive the experience through 
nightmares and flashbacks, have poor sleep quality, and feel detached or estranged. 
Confronting overwhelming internal distress and frightening external environments can 
also lead to high levels of depersonalization and derealization, which led clinicians to 
identify a dissociative subtype of PTSD in the DSM-5. Adaptations in normal brain 
function have been observed in imaging studies of patients with PTSD that underlie 
alterations in emotional processing and regulation, cognition, and many aspects of 
behavior, though clinical symptoms and changes in brain activity are not homogenous 
across patients [ 1]. The dissociative subtype occurs in 12 to 30% of people with PTSD 
and is characterized by [CONTACT_120561], 
while the non-dissociative subtype presents symptoms of hyperarousal and re-
experiencing, an emotional undermodulation mediated by [CONTACT_120562] [ 2, 3]. Patients suffering from the dissociative subtype of 
PTSD typi[INVESTIGATOR_120477], with mixed response to existing evidence-based treatments. 
 
Approximately 7% of the population in the [LOCATION_002] (U.S.) will have PTSD 
sometime in their life, but this figure jumps to 10.8% to 13% of veterans with combat 
experience [ 4]. For soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, the incidence of PTSD 
is 17.1% with 400,000 to 500,000 U.S. Iraq/Afghanistan veterans reportedly having 
PTSD. In 2004, the Defense Department and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) 
spent $4.3 billion on PTSD disability payments to approximately 215,000 veterans [ 5]. In 
2012 alone the VA spent $294 million and $[ADDRESS_134941] of about $17 billion per 
year [6]. There are an estimated 20 to 22 suicides a day by [CONTACT_23065] [ 7].
Available PTSD treatments, including medications and therapy, effectively treat only a 
fraction of people who try them for adequate dose and duration. This indicates a need to 
develop treatments targeting durable remission of PTSD. The Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) has approved only two pharmacotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_57589], both of 
which are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Paroxetine and sertraline (Paxil 
and Zoloft) both demonstrated statistically significant superiority over placebo on the 
CAPS in 12-week confirmatory clinical trials with daily dosing, but some studies were 
less effective in treating combat-related PTSD and sertraline demonstrated gender 
differences with minimal efficacy in men [ 8-10]. PTSD rarely remits after [ADDRESS_134942]-line treatment by [CONTACT_120563]2 Protocol 
IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: 23 March 2021 
Page 20 of 110 VA’s National Center for PTSD in the U.S., as well as by [CONTACT_38375] 
(WHO). An extensive list of medications, namely antipsychotics, anxiolytics, 
antidepressants, and sleep aids, are frequently prescribed off-label but have only small 
effect sizes in reducing PTSD symptoms. PTSD brings a high public burden, both 
economically and socially, by [CONTACT_120564], lost wages, and 
disability payments [ 11, 12]. Given the chronicity of PTSD, low compliance evidenced 
by [CONTACT_120565], and limited recovery with current medications contributing to serious 
outcomes, PTSD patients suffer from unmet medical need. 
 
One treatment approach is to develop medications and/or psychotherapeutic treatments 
that may indirectly decrease or eliminate the neurochemical pathologies underlying the 
chronic hyperarousal and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]-adrenal (HPA) axis 
associated with PTSD. Cognitive behavioral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], particularly prolonged exposure 
and cognitive processing therapy, are considered among the most effective 
psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Other methods such as psychodynamic therapy and eye movement 
desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) have also proven to be effective in treating 
some symptoms of PTSD [ 13, 14], although some patients may need more than one type 
of treatment to reduce or resolve those symptoms. A meta-analysis concluded that all 
“bona fide” psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including those listed above, are similarly effective with 
PTSD [15]. In the past decade, there has been a growing amount of research into 
medications and other methods that may augment the effectiveness of psychotherapy for 
PTSD (see [ 16]for a review). Examples of this are virtual reality-assisted exposure 
therapy [17, 18] and D-cycloserine-assisted psychotherapy [ 19]. MDMA-assisted therapy 
is another such approach. 
 
1.2.2 MDMA
MDMA is a ring-substituted phenylisopropylamine derivative invented by [CONTACT_120566] 1912 [ 20, 21]. Similar to SSRIs, MDMA binds to the 
serotonin transporter, but has additional effects on carrier-mediated release and reuptake 
inhibition of norepi[INVESTIGATOR_120478] a lesser extent in humans, dopamine [ 22-28]. MDMA 
also increases levels of affiliative neurohormones oxytocin and vasopressin, which 
increases trust and attenuates reactivity to threatening cues, and some researchers have 
suggested a role for oxytocin in treating PTSD. The indirect effects of MDMA on central 
and peripheral neurohormone release contribute to a novel mechanism that may help 
regulate the HPA axis, which would treat the core psychopathology of PTSD for a 
durable remission. 
 
Onset of MDMA effects occurs ~0.[ADDRESS_134943] found a small percentage 
of people exhibit problematic use of Ecstasy (material represented as containing MDMA) 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation  MAPP2 Protocol 
IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: 23 March 2021 
Page 21 of 110 [29, 30]. Studies of regular or problematic Ecstasy users indicate that on average, regular 
use occurs no more often than once a week [ 31]. Hence, MDMA may have moderate 
abuse potential. See the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for a more detailed explanation.
1.2.3 MDMA-Assisted Therapy for PTSD 
Many therapi[INVESTIGATOR_120479] [ 14]. To be effective, exposure must be accompanied by a degree 
of emotional engagement or “fear activation” while avoiding dissociation or 
overwhelming emotion [ 32]. This has been referred to as working within the “optimal 
arousal zone” or “window of tolerance” [ 33-35]. 
 
The combined neurobiological effects of MDMA increase compassion, reduce defenses 
and fear of emotional injury, and enhance communication and introspection. MDMA 
produces anxiolytic and prosocial effects, which counteract avoidance and hyperarousal 
in the context of therapy. PTSD increases amygdala activity, causing heightened 
encoding of fearful memories and decreasing blood flow in the prefrontal cortex. In 
contrast, MDMA acutely decreases activity in the amygdala [ 36], and there is some 
indication that MDMA may increase activity in the prefrontal cortex [ 37]. Brain imaging 
after MDMA indicates less reactivity to angry facial expressions and greater reward in 
happy faces [ 36]. This action is compatible with its reported reduction in fear or 
defensiveness, and is in contrast to the stimulation of the amygdala observed in animal 
models of conditioned fear, a state similar to PTSD [ 38-40]. The reduction in stress-
induced activation of the amygdala may be supported and enhanced by [CONTACT_120567]. The subjective effects of 
MDMA create a productive psychological state that enhances the therapeutic process. 
MDMA is capable of inducing unique psychopharmacological effects, including 
decreased fear and increased wellbeing, sociability, interpersonal trust, acceptance of self 
and others, and ability to address these issues without extreme disorientation or ego loss 
due to alert state of consciousness. These factors taken together can provide the 
opportunity for a corrective emotional experience.
 
A combined treatment of MDMA and therapy may be especially useful for treating PTSD 
because MDMA can attenuate the fear response of a perceived threat to one’s emotional 
integrity and decrease defensiveness without blocking access to memories or preventing a 
deep and genuine experience of emotion [ 41-44]. Elimination of these conditioned fear 
responses can lead to more open and comfortable communication about past traumatic 
events and greater access to information about them [ 45]. Participants are able to 
experience and express fear, anger, and grief with less likelihood of feeling overwhelmed 
by [CONTACT_120568]. MDMA seems to engender internal awareness that even painful 
feelings that arise are an important part of the therapeutic process. In addition, feelings of 
empathy, love, and deep appreciation often emerge, along with a clearer perspective of 
the trauma as a past event, a more accurate perspective about its significance, and a 
heightened awareness of the support and safety that exists in the present. As a result, 
MDMA-assisted therapy may enable the participants to restructure their intra-psychic 
realities and develop a wider behavioral and emotional repertoire with which to respond 
to anxiogenic stimuli.  
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation  MAPP2 Protocol 
IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: [ADDRESS_134944] to report 
on the effects of MDMA in humans [ 46], with 80 to 160 milligrams (mg) MDMA 
required to produce desired subjective effects in humans [ 46, 47]. MDMA was found to 
robustly influence human emotional status in a unique way [ 46] without adversely 
affecting physiological functions or perception, such as visual perception or cognition 
[48-51]. In the 1970s, psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_120480]-assisted therapy to treat 
psychological disorders, including anxiety [ 52]. Legal therapeutic use continued until its 
placement on the U.S. list of Schedule 1 substances in 1985 [ 44, 45, 53]. An estimated 
500,000 doses of MDMA were administered during therapy and personal growth sessions 
in North America prior to its scheduling [ 44, 54]. A few uncontrolled human studies of 
MDMA assessing safety in a therapeutic setting occurred in the 1980s [ 55, 56]. 
 
Controlled human studies for clinical development of MDMA commenced in the mid-
1990s with a MAPS-funded investigator-initiated Phase 1 dose-response safety study [ 57, 
58]. Starting in [ADDRESS_134945] and safety pi[INVESTIGATOR_120481]. This study enrolled six participants, with four receiving a single 
session of MDMA-assisted therapy without any safety concerns and with some PTSD 
symptom reduction [ 41]. These studies formed the basis of clinical experience with 
MDMA prior to studies subsequently conducted under a MAPS IND.
 
Under IND #063384, MAPS initiated an international series of Phase [ADDRESS_134946] 
moderate PTSD (CAPS-4 score: 50+), with at least 6 months of symptoms. Participants 
were not excluded for having more than one traumatic event, or for having tried, not 
tolerated, or refused an SSRI or serotonin-norepi[INVESTIGATOR_26331] (SNRI) 
prescribed for PTSD. Outcomes from six Phase [ADDRESS_134947] been published: one study in the U.S. with a long-
term follow-up (LTFU) conducted an average of 3.8 years after the final MDMA-assisted 
therapy session (MP1) [ 43, 59]and one in Switzerland (MP2) [ 60, 61]. MP1 was 
followed by a small open-label extension study examining the treatment of relapse in 
three participants with a single MDMA-assisted therapy treatment and a 12-month 
follow-up (MP1E2). Three additional studies have completed treatments (MP8, MP9, 
MP12) and two international studies were terminated early for logistical reasons with 
partial datasets (MP3, MP4). These studies tested a range of designs, such as a placebo 
control (MP1, MP4), low dose MDMA comparator control (MP2, MP9), and three-arm 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation  MAPP2 Protocol 
IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: 23 March 2021 
Page 23 of 110 dose response studies (MP8, MP12). MP4 was terminated early due to delays in 
regulatory approval and enrollment timelines, with available efficacy data presented 
without a formal analysis. MP3 was terminated early by [CONTACT_120569]; efficacy data 
are not available for these reasons (MP3 is excluded from Phase 2 data). 
 
Intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of primary efficacy and safety data from six MAPS-
sponsored MDMA PTSD Phase 2 clinical trials worldwide (MP1, MP2, MP4, MP8, 
MP9, MP12) consisting of [ADDRESS_134948] Experimental Session in 91 participants who 
received a therapeutically active dose of MDMA in these studies, and 67% did not meet 
PTSD diagnostic criteria per CAPS-4 assessment [63]. As of October 01, 2020, with 341 
individuals exposed to MDMA in the sponsor’s development program across various 
indications and at least 1,434 participants in MDMA research studies conducted without 
sponsor support (for a total of at least 1,775 individuals), the sponsor has observed an 
acceptable risk-benefit ratio for MDMA-assisted therapy.. Across Phase [ADDRESS_134949] 
of difference in CAPS-4 severity scores from Baseline, 2 months after two blinded 
Experimental Sessions (p<0.001). The dropout rate across studies was 7.5% (8 of 107). 
Large between-groups effect size estimates (0.9), initial indications of efficacy, and 
favorable safety outcomes support expanding the research initiative to encompass a larger 
sample of participants with PTSD in a Phase [ADDRESS_134950] clinical measures to confirm the 
efficacy and safety of manualized MDMA-assisted therapy with a flexible dose MDMA 
in reducing PTSD and associated symptoms in comparison to the same therapy combined 
with an inactive placebo control. 
 
2.1 Primary Objective 
1. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of MDMA-assisted therapy 
for PTSD compared to identical therapy with inactive placebo, as measured by [CONTACT_120570]-5 Total Severity Score from Visit 3 (Baseline) to Visit 19 ([ADDRESS_134951] Baseline). 
 
2.2 Key Secondary Objective 
1. The key secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of MDMA-assisted 
therapy for PTSD compared to identical therapy with inactive placebo in clinician-rated 
functional impairment, as measured by [CONTACT_120571]

The overall safety objective is to assess differences between groups in severity, incidence 
and frequency of Adverse Events (AEs), Treatment Emergent AEs (TEAEs), AEs of 
Special Interest (AESIs), and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), concomitant medication 
use, suicidal ideation and behavior, and vital signs to support the package insert for 
MDMA-assisted therapy. The following safety objectives will evaluate the safety of 
MDMA-assisted therapy compared to identical therapy with inactive placebo:  
 
1. Compare relative incidence of AEs during Experimental Sessions that may be indicative 
of a medical complication of the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) such as clinical 
signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, or neurological symptoms or any 
other signs or symptoms that prompt additional vital sign measurements. 
2. Compare relative incidence of AEs by [CONTACT_926]. 
3. Compare relative incidence of TEAEs, to determine relationship to the IMP based on 
relative incidence in the MDMA group. 
4. Compare relative incidence of TEAEs by [CONTACT_120555], 1 day, and 2 days after IMP administration. 
5. Compare relative incidence of AESIs, defined as AEs specified in the protocol related to 
cardiac function and abuse liability. 
6. Compare relative incidence of AEs by [CONTACT_120556], resulting in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and continuing at Study Termination. 
7. Compare relative incidence of SAEs 
8. Compare relative incidence of concomitant medications taken during an Experimental 
Session, 1 day, and 2 days after IMP administration. 
9. Compare relative incidence of psychiatric concomitant medications taken during the 
Treatment Period. 
10. Compare relative incidence of positive or serious suicidal ideation and positive suicidal 
behavior assessed with the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) by 
[CONTACT_1570]. 
11. Compare mean changes in blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature from pre-IMP 
administration to end of each Experimental Session by [CONTACT_1570]. 
2.4 Exploratory Objectives

Total Severity analyses 
2. Explore changes in PTSD symptom clusters of re-experiencing, avoidance, negative 
alterations in cognition and mood, and hyperarousal, as measured by [CONTACT_120572]-5 
subscale scores from Visit 3 (Baseline) to Visit 19 ([ADDRESS_134953] Baseline) 
3. Characterization of CAPS-[ADDRESS_134954] of adverse childhood experiences (ACE) on the CAPS-5 Total Severity 
analyses 
5. Explore differences between treatment groups in:

Enrollment Confirmation takes place at the completion of the Preparatory Period, at 
which time the Treatment period will commence. The approximately 12-week Treatment 
Period will consist of three Experimental Sessions 3 to 5 weeks apart with associated 
non-drug Integrative Sessions and CAPS-5 assessments. 
After the final Integrative Session 3.3 (Visit 18), participants will enter follow-up with no

4.3 Interruptions and Accommodations Due to COVID-19 Pandemic or Any Other 
Unforeseen Emergency at Clinic Locations 
This clinical trial may be interrupted by [CONTACT_120587] 2019 (COVID-19) 
global pandemic. Accommodations may be required for study continuation and 
participant and study site staff safety due to this emergency or any other unforeseen 
emergency in the future. The following accommodations in the protocol will be allowed, 
captured, and noted in the Clinical Study Report as COVID-19 deviations: 
 
 Integrative Sessions may be conducted by [CONTACT_120588] 11.1 Tapering Instructions 
 Delaying Experimental Sessions and associated Integrative Sessions 
 Delaying Independent Rater assessments for participants who cannot complete them 
remotely off-site 
 Use of prohibited medications and/or cannabis or initiation of new therapy for 
participants with significant study delays, which will be reviewed by [CONTACT_120589]-tapered prior to resuming treatment per Section 
11.0 Concomitant Medications. 
 
For any participant with COVID-19 related illness, continued trial participation after full 
recovery of the disease may be appropriate after discussion between the site physicians 
and Medical Monitors on a case-by-case basis. 
 
4.4 Discontinuation and Completion Criteria 
4.4.1 Complete or Evaluable Participants 
A participant is considered ‘Evaluable’ and eligible for the mITT analysis if they have 
completed at least one Experimental Session and one CAPS-5 assessment beyond 
Baseline.  
 
A participant is considered ‘Evaluable and Completed Per Protocol’ if they have 
completed all Experimental Sessions and CAPS-5 assessments as planned. These 
participants will be included in the mITT analysis set and the Per Protocol analysis set. 
 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation  MAPP2 Protocol 
IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: 23 March 2021 
Page 38 of 110 A participant is considered ‘Evaluable and Early Termination’ if they have completed at 
least one Experimental Session and one CAPS-5 assessment beyond Baseline but 
terminated early. These participants will be included in the mITT analysis.  
 
A participant is considered to be in good standing with the clinical site if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_120484]/or therapy pair, the participant was compliant with protocol 
requirements, even if they were unable to complete all study visits. 
 
4.4.2 Screen Failures
‘Screen Failures’ are defined as participants who pass phone screening but are deemed 
ineligible before successfully enrolling in the study at Visit 0. Screen failures may fail to 
meet all Inclusion Criteria and may meet one or more Exclusion Criteria or withdraw 
consent prior to Enrollment. All potential participants who begin Screening will be 
tracked on a Screening Log, and reasons for Screen Failure will be recorded. Screen 
Failures are not considered evaluable. 
 
Screen Failures may be identified through review of medical history, assessments, 
measures, laboratory results, or conversations with the participant. Medical assessments 
may be repeated for confirmation. At any time during Screening, if a potential participant 
is deemed to be ineligible, classify as a Screen Failure, notify the potential participant 
that they are unfortunately not eligible for the study, and do not schedule additional 
Screening assessments. Participants who fail Screening may be rescreened at a later date 
if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_120590] a new copy of the Informed 
Consent Form (ICF). Screen Failures may request a referral to an outside therapi[INVESTIGATOR_120485]. Screen Failures that were scheduled for an IR assessment will be entered into the 
Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system.
 
4.4.3 Pre-Randomization Early Terminations
‘Pre-randomization Early Terminations’ are defined as participants who were deemed 
eligible and enrolled in the study at Visit 0, but are deemed ineligible prior to the first 
Experimental Session and do not have enrollment confirmed at Visit 4. These participants 
may fail to meet all Inclusion Criteria and may meet one or more Exclusion Criteria or 
withdraw consent prior to Enrollment Confirmation or the site may withdraw the 
participant for reasons described in Section 4.3.4 Early Termination from the Study . 
Participants who fail Enrollment Confirmation may not be re-enrolled into this study at a 
later date. All enrolled participants, even those failing Enrollment Confirmation, will be 
maintained in the EDC system. Pre-randomization Early Terminations are not considered 
evaluable.
 
Pre-randomization Early Terminations may be identified through review of medical 
history, assessments, measures, laboratory results, or conversations with the participant. 
At any time during the Preparatory Period, if a potential participant is deemed to be 
ineligible, classify as a Pre-randomization Early Termination, notify the potential 
participant that they are unfortunately not eligible for the study, and do not schedule 
additional assessments. Do not randomize the participant. Pre-randomization Early 
Terminations will be provided an Exit Plan as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] Exit Plan .

Page 39 of 110  
4.4.4 Early Termination from the Study
Participants who are removed from the study after they are randomized and receive IMP 
but do not complete the study may fall into one of these categories: Post-randomization 
Early Termination or Dropout. If the participant has received IMP in at least one 
Experimental Session and completed one CAPS-[ADDRESS_134997] of the participant or if the participant cannot comply with 
elements of the protocol that are critical for safety or for the scientific integrity of the 
study. If the site team makes the decision to terminate the participant from treatment or 
the study, they will explain the reason for withdrawal and document in the participant’s 
source records and Electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). If a participant develops any 
Exclusion Criteria that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_120486], affects the safety of 
the participant, including psychiatric diagnosis, medical diagnosis, pregnancy, or 
requiring use of prohibited medications, the participant will discontinue treatment in 
Experimental Sessions but remain in the study for the associated Integrative Sessions. 
Participants whose Experimental Sessions are delayed by [CONTACT_25963]-19 pandemic may 
start any of these medications during the delay, as clinically indicated. When study visits 
resume, they will be given the option to resume Experimental Sessions after tapering off 
of these medications per Section 11.1 Tapering Instructions. Any time a participant 
terminates from the study early, the site team will attempt to obtain information about AE 
outcomes if appropriate, as determined by [CONTACT_120591]. The 
site team will provide the participant with an Exit Plan as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] 
Exit Plan.
 
 Post-randomization Early Termination : Participants who discontinue study treatment 
but continue to participate in Independent Rater primary and secondary outcome 
assessments. Data collection by [CONTACT_120592]. 
 Dropout: If a participant decides to withdraw consent completely, they will terminate 
without further follow-up. If the participant agrees, they will complete a final CAPS-[ADDRESS_134998] one dose of IMP and no longer participate in the study (i.e., 
no further contact [CONTACT_120593]). Data collected on study participants up 
to the time of withdrawal of consent will remain in the trial database in order to maintain 
scientific validity. Removal of data from the database would undermine the scientific and 
ethical integrity of the research.

Phase 2 studies sponsored by [CONTACT_120553]. Phase 2 studies indicate that 75, 100 and 125 mg 
MDMA initial doses with the supplemental dose are active and effective in two to three 
Experimental Sessions. MDMA doses with an optimal risk-benefit ratio range from 75

(Cohen’s dIGPP=0.77, N=58) initial dose of MDMA with a 2-session treatment package. 
In Phase 2 studies, the sponsor observed a -36.4 point mean change in CAPS-4 scores 
among active dose participants receiving two Experimental Sessions (N=72) compared to 
a -44.2 point mean change after three Experimental Sessions (N=51). Although 
uncontrolled, the additional 7.[ADDRESS_135003] Experimental Session with an option to increase to 125 mg

Phase 1 studies (150 mg and 160 mg). The results of these Phase 2 studies led to the 
selection of 80 mg and 120 mg MDMA as the initial active doses to be compared to 
inactive placebo in Phase 3 trials.
 
This blinded study will compare the effects of a flexible dose of MDMA or placebo 
administered in three Experimental Sessions. A participant will receive a divided-dose of 
120 mg or 180 mg per Experimental Session. Initial doses per Experimental Session are 
80 mg or 120 mg of MDMA or placebo compounded with inactive excipi[INVESTIGATOR_120487], followed 1.5 to 2 hours later 
by a supplemental half-dose (40 mg or 60 mg, or placebo). A flexible dosing regimen

5.1 Description of Therapeutic Method
The largely non-directive therapeutic method of MDMA-assisted therapy is described in 
detail in the Treatment Manual. All therapy teams will be extensively trained in a multi-
week training program prior to the study to ensure all participants are treated in a similar 
manner. The non-directive approach pertains to inviting inquiry and providing suggestion 
rather than directing the participant in the therapeutic approach. This requires active or 
engaged listening and responding, as well as facilitation of therapeutic action by 
[CONTACT_120594] a manner that does not interfere 
with the participant’s spontaneous experience. 
 
5.[ADDRESS_135007] ensure that the minimum 
requirements below are met: 
 
 One person licensed to manage and administer controlled substances for each site  
 A physician to assess participant safety at Screening 
 One or more two-person therapy pairs, male/female preferred 
 One person per therapy pair is required to be licensed to provide therapy according to 
state and local requirements 
 If one person on the therapy pair is unlicensed, they will work under the direction of the 
licensed pair member 
 
5.3 Training
The sponsor’s Therapy Training Program is designed to teach competency in applying 
the essential elements of this method of MDMA-assisted therapy. Therapy team members 
will receive specific training in the MDMA-assisted therapy method, protocol, and latest 
version of the IB. Training in the therapy method consists of reading the Treatment

5.4 Adherence to Therapeutic Method
Therapy sessions, including Experimental Sessions, may be recorded, with recordings 
preserved for research and training purposes. Adherence criteria and competence ratings 
will be conducted by [CONTACT_3784], trained, and blinded Adherence Raters who will analyze 
video data from specific and randomly selected Preparatory Sessions, Experimental 
Sessions, and Integrative Sessions. The elements included in adherence criteria are 
specific to each type of session and are defined in the Treatment Manual. These ratings 
will be collected, at minimum, for each therapy pair in the study. Ratings will be used to

6.1 Primary Outcome Measure and Reliability
6.1.1 CAPS-5 (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5) 
The last month CAPS-5 is a semi-structured interview that assesses index history of 
DSM-5-defined traumatic event exposure [ 64], including the most distressing event, time 
since exposure, to produce a diagnostic score (presence vs. absence) and a PTSD Total 
Severity score [ 64]. The CAPS-5 rates intrusion symptoms (intrusive thoughts or 
memories), avoidance, cognitive and mood symptoms, arousal and reactivity symptoms, 
duration and degree of distress and dissociation. The CAPS-[ADDRESS_135011], 
or query further if behavioral examples are needed to determine the appropriate symptom 
intensity rating. Avoiding building therapeutic/clinical rapport beyond the basic level of 
rapport needed to conduct the interview in the research setting also minimizes the chance 
for bias. Remote assessment assures that the rater who is collecting the Primary Outcome 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation  MAPP2 Protocol 
IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: 23 March 2021 
Page 45 of 110 will not witness Experimental Sessions and the acute effects of IMP, which strengthens 
the study blind. Interviews may be recorded in as many instances as necessary to 
establish reliability of a random selection of interviews for accuracy. After the initial 
screening visit, the IRs will be blinded to visit number, number of treatments received, 
treatment assignment, and any study data for the participant. IR visits will be assigned 
based on availability.
 
6.2 Secondary Measure 
6.2.1 SDS (Sheehan Disability Scale)
The SDS is a clinician-rated assessment of functional impairment [ 65]. The reporting 
period for the SDS is the past monthand this measure is administered by a member of the 
Independent Rater Pool. The items indicate degree of impairment in the domains of 
work/school, social life, and home life, with response options based on an eleven-point 
scale (0=not at all to 10=extremely), and five verbal tags (not at all, mildly, moderately, 
markedly, extremely). The SDS takes 1 to 2 minutes to complete. The measure can be 
scored for each of the three domains. The SDS has high internal consistency and 
accurately identified 80% of a sample of primary care patients with mental disorders [ 66]. 
The SDS takes 1 to 2 minutes to complete. 
 
6.3 Safety Measures 
6.3.1 C-SSRS (Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale)
The C-SSRS is a clinician-administered measure of suicidal behavior devised to detect 
potential suicidal thoughts or behaviors during a clinical trial [ 66]. It consists of a 
Lifetime version and a Since Last Visit version that assess suicidal ideation, ideation 
intensity, and behavior. The C-SSRS consists of a series of questions and can be 
administered during a face-to-face interview or over the telephone. The Lifetime version 
will only be administered at the initial Screening visit. All subsequent administrations 
will utilize the Since Last Visit version. Participants who are discontinuing medications 
to participate in the study will complete the C-SSRS before and after medication 
washout. The C-SSRS Intensity scale for Lifetime obtained a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_135012] Visit C-SSRS severity scores were 
positively correlated with the BDI “suicide thoughts” item [ 67]. 
 
6.4 Screening Measures and Reliability
6.4.1 MINI (Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview)
This version of the MINI (7.0.2), a structured interview that was first developed in 1998 
to be compatible with DSM and International Classification of Disease (ICD) criteria for 
psychiatric illnesses [ 68], is now compatible with DSM-5 and will be administered by a 
member of the Independent Rater Pool to screen for psychiatric conditions per DSM-5. 
Each module of the MINI consists of two or three questions where the answer is either 
“Yes” or “No,” and decision-tree logic is used to determine whether to ask additional 
questions [ 70]. The MINI takes between 15 and 20 minutes to perform and addresses 
major psychiatric disorders. MINI items were highly reliable (interrater reliability 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation  MAPP2 Protocol 
IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: 23 March 2021 
Page 46 of 110 between kappa of 0.8 and 0.99; test-retest reliability between 0.[ADDRESS_135013] “current mania), and diagnosis via MINI was comparable to that made with the 
Composite Diagnostic Interview and the SCID [ 69, 70]Testing on nonpsychiatric 
samples did not create false positives [ 68]. The IR pool will not assess the PTSD or 
Antisocial Personality Disorder modules.
 
6.4.2 SCID-5-PD (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 for Personality 
Disorders)
The SCID-5-PD will be administered by a blinded IR via telemedicine [ 72]. Prior to the 
SCID-5-PD clinical interview, participants will complete a brief self-report questionnaire 
called the SCID-5 Self-report Personality Questionnaire (SCID-5-SPQ) as a self-report 
screening tool used to assess for personality disorders. Potential personality disorders that 
satisfy diagnostic thresholds will be further assessed via clinical interview during the 
SCID-5-PD. IRs will receive training on administering these measures from a research 
reliable trainer. Interviews may be recorded in as many instances as necessary to establish 
reliability of a random selection of interviews for accuracy. 
 
6.4.3 LEC-5 (Life Events Checklist for DSM-5)
The LEC-5 is a 17-item self-report instrument designed to determine the presence of 
traumatic life events in the assessment and diagnosis of PTSD. It is a companion measure 
to the PCL-5 and will be used to assess PTSD. The participant indicates whether each 
event listed has occurred during their lifetime, permitting the possibility of marking 
multiple events [ 73].
 
6.4.4 PCL-5 (PTSD Checklist)
The PCL-5 is a 20-item self-report questionnaire in which respondents indicate the 
presence and severity of PTSD symptoms, derived from the symptoms of PTSD per 
DSM-5 [74]. Participants indicate how much distress they have experienced due to 
symptoms such as "Repeated, disturbing memories, thoughts, or images of a stressful 
experience from the past," "Trouble remembering important parts of a stressful 
experience from the past," and "Feeling irritable or having angry outbursts" on a five-
point Likert-type scale (1=Not at all to 5=Extremely). A total PCL-5 score of 40 at 
Screening will be required for initial enrollment. 
 
6.4.5 DDIS (Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-5) 
Questions on the DDIS specifically addressing dissociative disorder symptoms (items 
117 to 130) will be assessed by a member of the Independent Rater Pool during 
Screening. These questions are part of an intensive interview that includes questions 
concerning somatic and psychiatric symptoms. The interview is intended to assess and 
potentially distinguish between dissociative disorders and other disorders and between 
Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) and a dissociative disorder not otherwise specified 
[75]. Owing tooverlap with items found between the DDIS and other screening 
measures, only questions specifically addressing DID will be assessed.

Page 47 of 110 6.5 Exploratory Measures
6.5.1 DSP-I (The Dissociative Subtype of PTSD Interview)
The DSP-I is a clinician-administered interview designed by [CONTACT_120595] (“add-on”) to the 
CAPS-5 [ 76]. Assessments of military veterans and civilians support the existence of a 
dissociative subtype of PTSD that is associated with PTSD severity and derealization and 
depersonalization [ 76-78]. The DSP-I takes approximately 5 to 15 minutes to complete
and will be assessed by a member of the Independent Rater Pool. It consists of two parts, 
only Part 1 will be administered. Part 1 contains five items addressing depersonalization, 
four items addressing derealization, and a section that is administered if dissociative 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_120489] (seven 
items) and observer items (three items) addressing interviewee demeanor, including 
evidence of dissociation, such as forgetfulness or giving a statement that is bizarre within 
the context of the interview. If two or more items within this section are endorsed, this 
indicates the presence of other dissociative symptoms beyond depersonalization and 
derealization. The DSP-I was first developed in 2016 and revised in 2017. 
 
6.5.2 ACE (Adverse Childhood Experience Questionnaire) 
The ACE is a 10-item checklist measure assessing number and types of adverse 
childhood experiences, including neglect and emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. 
Respondents are asked if an experience happened “often” and if so, to write “1”. The 
total score reflects the number of adverse childhood experiences. The measure was first 
used in the context of a study investigating the relationship between childhood adverse 
experiences and health outcomes in adulthood [ 79]. Number of frequent adverse 
childhood experiences is associated with adverse health outcomes in adulthood, including 
greater likelihood of heart disease, chronic pain, and poor work performance [ 80-83]. The 
scoring method has been used in archival research, finding an association between 
increased scores and health problems in several generations [ 83].  
 
6.5.3 BDI-II (Beck Depression Inventory II) 
The BDI-II is a revision of the BDI, a 21-item self-report measure [ 84, 85] that will serve 
as a measure of depression symptom severity over the prior two weeks [ 86]. The BDI-II 
has been validated, has high internal consistency and good test/re-test reliability, and is 
not overly sensitive to daily variations in mood. It takes 5 to 10 minutes to complete [ 86]. 
Score cutoffs indicate: 0 to 13 minimal depression, 14 to 19 mild depression, 20 to 28 
moderate depression, and 29 to 63 severe depression. Initial and subsequent studies report 
that the BDI-II total score has a reliability coefficient of 0.90 to 0.91 which is related to 
other measures of depression symptoms [ 86, 87]. Higher scores indicate more severe 
depressive symptoms.  
 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation  MAPP2 Protocol 
IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: 23 March 2021 
Page 48 of 110 6.5.4 CPGS (Chronic Pain Grade Scale)
The CPGS is a seven-item measure of pain. Responses to six of the seven items are made 
on a 10-point Likert scale regarding pain intensity in the past 6 months, and the response 
to the other item is made on a 10-point Likert scale regarding present-day pain [ 89]. 
Responses to questions are used to attain a rating (grade) for pain from 0 (no pain) to five 
(high disability, severely limiting). The instrument has three scale scores: pain severity, 
pain intensity, and pain-related disability. Estimated time to complete is 3 to 5 minutes. 
The CPGS is a validated scale with high internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha=0.90) 
and correlated with other instruments assessing pain [ 90].
 
6.5.5 EQ-5D-5L (EuroQol Five Dimensions-Five Levels Questionnaire) 
The EQ-5D-5L is a two-part self-report questionnaire assessing health status. It consists 
of five dimensions; mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain-discomfort and anxiety-
depression, and one visual analog scale (VAS). Responses are made on each dimension 
by [CONTACT_120596], from the healthiest or fewest problems (e.g., “I have no trouble walking 
about”) to the most trouble (e.g., “I am unable to walk about”) [ 90, 91]. In the second part 
of the EQ-5D-5L, current degree of health (“your health today”) is indicated by [CONTACT_112536] 
a 20 cm line marked form one to 100, with 100 considered “the best health you can 
imagine” and one “the worst health you can imagine.” The EQ-5D-5L does not sum 
responses, but treats each response on a dimension as a scale score, and the VAS is the 
location of the mark in centimeters. The scale can permit comparison across groups on 
health profiles, and an index can be derived from matching the five dimension scores and 
the VAS response with nation-specific datasets and calculator software or statistical 
software syntax designed for the measure. The EQ-5D-5L began as part of the EuroQoL 
measure, published in 1990 [ 93]. The instrument has been validated in populations from 
eight countries. EQ-5D-5L index scores and VAS scores assessed in people with stroke 
varied with degree of recovery assessed via long-term observation. EQ-5D-5L index 
scores and VAS scores assessed in people with stroke varied with degree of recovery 
assessed via long-term observation [ 93]. The EQ-5D-5L takes about 3 minutes to 
complete.
 
6.5.6 IASC (Inventory of Altered Self Capacities) 
The IASC is a 63-item self-report measure of difficulties with relationships, identity, and 
affect regulation [ 95]. The measure is completed by [CONTACT_120597] [ADDRESS_135014] month (1=Never to 5=Very often) on 
a 5-point Likert scale. The IASC consists of seven 9-item scales: interpersonal 
conflicts, idealization-disillusionment, abandonment concerns, identity impairment, 
susceptibility to influence, affect dysregulation, and tension reduction activities. Subscale 
scores are summed into raw scale scores. Level of symptomatology is assessed through 
use of t-scores based upon scale norms. IASC subscales range in reliability from 
Cronbach’s alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_135015] dysregulation scale scores 
were associated with a measure of depression [ 95].

IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: 23 March 2021 
Page 49 of 110 6.5.7 IPF (Inventory of Psychosocial Functioning)
The IPF will be administered as an exploratory measure at Baseline and 2-Month Follow-
up. The IPF is a self-report instrument designed to assess functional impairment across a 
spectrum of domains [ 96]. The IPF is an 80-item measure that was developed for use 
among individuals with PTSD. It assesses current psychosocial functioning across seven 
domains: romantic relationships, family, work, friendships, parenting, education, and 
self-care. Responses are made on a six point Likert scale, (1=Never to 6=Always). 
Domain scores can be computed for each subscale, which possess positive correlations 
with similar scales or subscales on other measures. The IPF has excellent psychometric 
properties, with Cronbach’s alpha for the total scale computed at 0.93 and good internal 
consistency for subscales (ranging from 0.80 to 0.90) [ 97].  
 
6.5.8 SCS (Self-Compassion Scale) 
The SCS is a 26-item self-report measure of self-compassion, or responding to one's own 
failure, suffering or inadequacies with kindness and compassion and recognizing one's 
own flaws and suffering as part of common human experience [ 98]. Respondents 
complete the SCS by [CONTACT_120598][INVESTIGATOR_120490] a 5-point Likert 
scale (1=Almost never and 5=Almost always). It is estimated to take between 4 to 8 
minutes to complete. The scale has six sub-scales: Self-Kindness, Self-Judgment, 
Common Humanity, Isolation, Mindfulness, and Over-Identified. The mean of subscale 
scores serves as a total score. Analysis of SCS response indicated that subscales are all 
related to a higher order factor of self-compassion, and the measure has high test-test 
reliability at a level of 0.93. Neff et al. reported an inverse relationship between SCS total 
scores and scores on measures of depression and anxiety. Self-compassion and global 
self-esteem are both related to positive mood and optimism, but self-compassion may be 
more strongly associated with stable mood and less associated with self-rumination and 
anger [99]. 
 
6.5.9 TAS-20 (Toronto Alexithymia Scale) 
The TAS-20 is a 20-item measure of self-reported difficulties with recognizing and 
verbalizing emotions [ 99, 100]. Responses are made on a 5-point Likert scale 
(1=Strongly disagree to 5=Strongly agree). Estimated time of measurement is 5 to 8 
minutes. The scale is comprised of three subscales: Difficulty Describing Feelings, 
Difficulty Identifying Feelings and Externally-Oriented Thinking, with all scales summed 
to create a total score reflecting presence and degree of alexithymia. The TAS-[ADDRESS_135016] reliability (Cronbach's 
alpha of 0.81, test-retest of 0.77).
 
6.5.10 Blinding Survey Measure  
The Blinding Survey Measure is a sponsor-developed measure assessing whether the 
participant thinks they receive active drug or placebo. The measure will be only collected 
at Study Termination (Visit 20) through participant direct report.  
 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation  MAPP2 Protocol 
IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: 23 March 2021 
Page 50 of 110 6.5.11 AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test)
The AUDIT is a ten-item self-report test. Respondents answer on a 5-point scale 
(0=Never or none, 4=Daily or greatest number) [ 102]. The ninth item addresses 
occurrence of injury of self or other as a result of drinking and the tenth addresses others’ 
concerns about the respondent’s drinking, with only three responses provided (0=No, 
2=Yes, but not during the last year, 3=Yes, during the last year). The measure can readily 
detect alcohol abuse disorders in a wide array of individuals [ 103].
6.5.12 DUDIT (Drug Use Disorders Identification Test)
The DUDIT is an 11-item measure designed toassess presence of substance use disorders
within the past year [ 103]. Responses to items are made on a 5-point scale with exact 
responses varying across questions. When present, use can be described in monthly or 
less than monthly versus four times a week or daily. A list of substances is provided at 
the end of the measure. The DUDIT is reliable, with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.80. When 
compared with an interview based on ICD 10, the DUDIT had a sensitivity to detecting 
substance use disorders of 90% and a specificity of 80% [ 103]. The English translation 
was developed from a Swedish-language original. Estimated time to complete is 2 to 4 
minutes.
 
6.5.13 SRNU (Self-reported Nicotine Use) 
The SRNU is a sponsor-developed measure that will assess participant’s use of nicotine, 
including approximate frequency of use in the last month and attitudes towards quitting. 
The measure will take less than 3 minutes to complete. 
 
6.5.14 EAT-26 (Eating Attitudes Test) 
The EAT-26 is a 26-item self-report measure that assesses attitudes about eating and food 
and is used to assess presence of eating disorders. Responses are made on a six-point 
scale (1=Always to 6=Never), and gathers information on gender, age, height, and
weight. The EAT-26 produces a total score and can be used to generate a “referral score.” 
The 27th item addresses the occurrence and frequency of specific eating behaviors, such 
as binge eating. Estimated time to complete is [ADDRESS_135017] 
high reliability coefficients (Cronbach alpha of 0.83 to 0.90) and has concurrent validity 
[105]. 
 
6.5.15 HPQSF (Health and Work Performance Absenteeism and Presenteeism Short 
Form)
The HPQSF is a short form of a larger measure of health and work performance that has 
selected items referring to absenteeism and work performance [ 106]. The larger measure 
was created by [CONTACT_120599]. It consists of 
eight questions selected from the larger Health and Work Performance Questionnaire, 
with one question containing five additional items. Items include questions concerning 
hours worked during an average week, number of whole and partial days missed during a 
4-week period, and items that rate average coworker and self-work performance on a ten-
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation  MAPP2 Protocol 
IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: 23 March 2021 
Page 51 of 110 point Likert scale (1=Worst performance to 10=Top performance). Hours spent in work 
over a 4-week period and over the last 7 days can be used to estimate absenteeism, and 
the HPQSF can also score presenteeism, a measure of actual performance in relation to 
possible performance. Self-reports on measure appear to match employer records of 
presence or absence [ 107], and the HPQSF appears to be reliable between one time point 
and another (reliability of 0.52) and is sensitive to change [ 106]. 
6.5.16 UFEC (Utilization of Facility-based and Emergent Care)
The UFEC is a sponsor-developed measure assessing participant health events, including 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120491], including in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
rehabilitation facilities and other health care facilities for a set period prior to study entry.

IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: [ADDRESS_135027] (IRB)-approved script to ascertain if they meet basic eligibility criteria. 
All individuals who are pre-screened should be assigned a Screening Number and 
recorded on the Screening Log. Data from potential participants who do not pass 
telephone screening will not be entered in the eCRF but reason of ineligibility will be 
documented on the Screening Log. At any time during Screening, if a potential 
participant is deemed ineligible, they will be classified as a Screen Failure, notified that 
they are not eligible for the study, and not be scheduled for any additional Screening 
assessments. 
 
If deemed potentially eligible, the potential participant will receive a copy of the ICF for 
review and invited to begin screening. Relevant medical and psychiatric records are 
required for the site physician to obtain a well-characterized medical history and assess 
eligibility. The physician may need to contact [CONTACT_120602] (see Section 11.0 Concomitant Medications ).
 
Site staff (preferably the therapy pair who would be treating this potential participant) or 
central screener will explain and obtain written (or electronic) informed consent using the 
IRB-approved ICF. Written consent must be obtained prior to performing any tests or 
evaluations for the study. The signature [CONTACT_120670] [ADDRESS_135028] over multiple visits and will be completed in-person, via 
telemedicine, and/or over the telephone. All procedures must be completed but there can 
be some flexibility in timing and order ofindividual assessments. The sponsor suggests
the following order of assessments to minimize in-person screening in light of COVID-
19:
 Initial Eligibility, including measures, in-person discussions, and review of medical 
records 
 Medical Assessments, including labs, electrocardiogram (ECG), and physical exam 
 Independent Rater Screening. 
 
7.1.2 Initial Eligibility Assessment
Qualified site staff or centralscreener willcomplete the following assessments in-person 
or via telemedicine: 
 
 Collect demographics information 
 Support the participant during completion of the LEC-5 with PCL-5 to confirm PTSD 
diagnosis and severity. Support is needed to ensure proper identification of the index 
trauma on the PCL-5. Symptom severity is assessed in relation to the index trauma. 
 Administer the Lifetime C-SSRS to assess history of suicidal behavior and ideation.

IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: [ADDRESS_135029] participant to complete self-reported Screening measures: 
o SCID-5-SPQ 
o AUDIT 
o DUDIT 
 Review results of all measures and discussions against eligibility criteria to assess initial 
eligibility. If deemed initially eligible, continue collection of information on source 
records, including past therapy and developmental trauma events, and schedule a meeting 
with a site physician. 
7.1.3 Meeting with Site Physician 
A site physician will meet with the participant over telemedicine, the phone, or in-person 
to perform the following assessments: 
In advance of meeting with the participant, review medical and psychiatric history via 
review of provided records. If no records were provided or those provided are not 
sufficient, request additional records. Collect data on previous hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120493]. 
 Review medical and psychiatric history with the participant via interview, confirming 
information collected in medical records. 
 Review past and current medications and adherence to prescriptions. 
 Assess ability to become pregnant and discuss requirement for commitment to adequate 
birth control for the duration of the study.  
 
If the physician deems the participant initially eligible based on these discussions and 
review of medical records, the site will make an assessment about the next step for 
screening, either IR screening (Section 7.1.4 Independent Rater Screening) or in-person 
medical assessments. The Sponsor suggests completing the IR Screening while the 
medical assessments are being scheduled.  
In-Person Medical Assessments
 
The physical exam must be performed by a qualified physician and lab assessments must 
be completed at a designated lab. Some or all of these assessments may be at outside 
facilities. Medical assessments will include:
 Perform urine pregnancy test for participants who are able to become pregnant. 
 Perform a urine drug test. blood pressure, pulse, and body temperature measurement. 
 Height and weight, which will be used to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI). 
 Examination of head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, skin, heart, lungs, abdomen, and 
extremities. 
 Brief neurological exam (cranial nerves 2 to 12, sensory, motor, reflexes, and cerebellar 
function). 
 ECG and 1-minute rhythm strip. 
 Clinical laboratory assessments, per Section 13.0 Clinical Laboratory Assessments. The 
clinical laboratory values will not be captured in the eCRF but will be used to establish 
eligibility and will be kept with the participant’s source record. Clinically significant 
abnormal values will be captured as medical history. 
 If there is evidence of liver disease by [CONTACT_969], physical examination or laboratory testing, 
HCV serology will be performed. 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation  MAPP2 Protocol  
IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: 23 March 2021 
Page 57 of 110  If there is evidence of significant hepatic disease other than HCV, the potential 
participant will not be eligible for enrollment and will be advised to see their personal 
physician for further evaluation. If HCV serology is positive and the potential participant 
has not already been evaluated for possible treatment of HCV, they will be referred to a 
physician with expertise in evaluating and treating liver disease. After this evaluation and 
after completion of any recommended treatment, if the HCV is judged by [CONTACT_120603], the participant may be enrolled, if there are no 
other contraindications. 
 If the potential participant has a condition such as controlled hypertension or Diabetes 
Mellitus (Type 2) that warrants additional testing to ensure they do not have evidence of 
significant vascular or other cardiac disease, they have no other evidence of 
cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease by [CONTACT_969], physical exam or ECG, and if the 
investigator judges their overall health and other cardiovascular risk factors to be 
acceptable (family history, smoking, lipid levels, body weight, level of physical activity), 
they will be referred for nuclear exercise testing by a cardiologist and for carotid 
ultrasound. If these tests fail to reveal evidence of significant vascular disease or other 
cardiac disease, the person may be enrolled if there are no other contraindications. 
Participants taking one or more antihypertensives may be enrolled in the study. The 
investigators will record and review medications used to control hypertension prior to 
enrollment. Per the Medical Monitor and site physician's instruction, other tests of 
cardiovascular health and function may be required during screening, such as an 
echocardiogram. These will only be completed on a case-by-case basis to confirm a 
participant's cardiovascular eligibility. 
 
Additional visits (in person, by [CONTACT_756], or via telemedicine) may be scheduled at the 
discretion of the study staff to collect more information for determining eligibility or to 
discuss study expectations with the potential participant.  
 
Once all results are obtained, the site team will review all medical assessments, notes 
from interviews and discussions, medical records, and measures against eligibility 
criteria. If, upon examination, there are questions raised about possible medical problems, 
the site physician will request additional tests, assessments, or measures as indicated. The 
site physician may also contact [CONTACT_120604]. 
7.1.[ADDRESS_135030] adequate internet access and be in a 
private and quiet space where they are comfortable talking about personal matters.
If participants meet initial eligibility during Screening, a blinded IR will continue the 
eligibility assessment via telemedicine after reviewing the results of the LEC-5 and 
SCID-5-SPQ. The blinded IR interview may be recorded to assess reliability of ratings. If 
possible, the potential participant should be present at the study site during this 
assessment, in case the therapy pair is needed for support. If a participant reports suicidal 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation  MAPP2 Protocol  
IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: [ADDRESS_135031] Visit C-SSRS to determine suicidal risk. 
 The IR will complete MINI interview to assess psychiatric disorders.  
The results from the MINI, SCID-5-PD, DDIS, and C-SSRS will be provided to the 
therapy pair at the site to review along with all other Screening information to determine 
eligibility. Items assessed by [CONTACT_120605], but the measures will not be repeated. If site staff deem 
the participant eligible, schedule Enrollment (Visit 0). 
 
If the results of the any interview indicate an exclusionary psychological disorder 
diagnosis is present, the Senior IR reviewer will review the recording of the MINI and/or 
SCID-5-PD assessment. The Senior IR reviewer will invite the study team (including 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], site physician, and Clinical Investigator) to provide any additional information 
that may inform the Senior IR reviewer’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. The Senior IR reviewer will make the 
final judgment on whether or not the participant has an exclusionary diagnosis. 
Participants with exclusionary diagnoses will not be enrolled. However, if any diagnosis 
is not present or uncertain according to any measure or interview, but the investigator 
believes the participant presents with a particular disorder, they may diagnose and deem 
the participant ineligible if appropriate. 
 
After the initial screening visit the IRs will be blinded to visit number, treatment 
assignment, number of treatments received, and any study data for the participant. IR 
visits will be assigned based on availability.  
 
7.1.[ADDRESS_135032] questions about 
further participants’ eligibility. If a participant is approved by [CONTACT_456], the participant

Page 59 of 110 Medical history and medication information will be reviewed for completeness. A 
medication tapering plan will be discussed with the participant, if applicable. If 
agreeable, the participant will be enrolled in the study. Once enrolled, AE collection 
requirements begin (refer to Section 10.0 Safety ). Visit [ADDRESS_135033] on the 
same day.
7.2 Preparatory Period with Enrollment Confirmation
Participants will undergo three Preparatory Sessions (Visits 1, 2, and 4) lasting 
approximately [ADDRESS_135034] 48 hours between 
Preparatory Sessions. The minimum time to complete the Preparatory Period is 5 days. 
The Preparatory Period will also include the Baseline CAPS-5 assessment (Visit 3), 
which will be assessed by a blinded IR. Adherence criteria for Preparatory Sessions 
should be followed per the Treatment Manual. In these visits the therapy pair will work 
with the participant to prepare for MDMA-assisted therapy, begin building therapeutic 
alliance, and promote a safe set and setting for confronting trauma-related memories, 
emotions, and thoughts.  
 
7.2.[ADDRESS_135035] of: 
 
 Preparatory Session 1 (Visit 1) will occur 0 to 12 days after Visit 0. The visit timing 
should take in to account appropriate times for monitoring medication tapering.  
 Preparatory Session 2 (Visit 2) will occur 2 to 21 days after Visit 1. The visit timing 
should take into account appropriate times for monitoring medication tapering. 
 If tapering is ongoing at Preparatory Session 2 (Visit 2), the site team will schedule a 
telephone phone call within 7 days of completion of tapering and stabilization confirm 
that the participant is eligible for the Baseline CAPS-5 assessment. If tapering is 
complete or not needed, the site team will confirm eligibility and schedule Baseline 
CAPS-5 T1 (Visit 3) and Preparatory Session 3 (Visit 4) as soon as possible.  
 
At each 90-minute psychoeducation and therapy Preparatory Session, the therapy pair 
will:
 
 Record the therapy session. 
 Inquire about any possible changes in health to ensure the participant continues to meet 
all eligibility requirements. Record AEs as described in Section 10.0 Safety . 
 Inquire about concomitant medication use and adherence. 
 Confirm that medication tapering is ongoing or complete, as appropriate. 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation  MAPP2 Protocol  
IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: [ADDRESS_135036] 
procedures and techniques described in the Treatment Manual [ 108].
If a participant would like a companion present during or after the Experimental Session, 
a meeting between the therapy pair and that individual will be scheduled prior to the first 
Experimental Session. There must be mutual agreement between the participant and 
therapy pair concerning the presence of the companion.
 
During one of the Preparatory Sessions, if possible, the therapy pair will introduce the 
participant to the attendant who will remain with the participant during each overnight 
stay after each MDMA-assisted therapy session. The attendant will be an individual with 
previous training in caregiving. The site will make all attempts to have the same attendant 
for each Experimental Session for a given participant, but it is not guaranteed. 
 
At any time during the Preparatory Period, if a potential participant is deemed to be 
ineligible, the site team will classify them as a Pre-randomization Early Termination, 
notify the potential participant that they are unfortunately not eligible for the study, and 
not schedule additional assessments. The site team will not randomize participants 
classified as Pre-randomization Early Terminations. 
 
7.2.2 Baseline: CAPS-5 by [CONTACT_120606] 3, an IR will measure the Baseline CAPS-5 (referred to as Baseline CAPS-5 T1) 
via telemedicine as soon as possible after medication tapering, stabilization, and two 
Preparatory Sessions are complete. This visit may be recorded to video to establish inter-
rater reliability. The scores will be sent as soon as possible to the site staff. A CAPS-[ADDRESS_135037] 28 is required to meet Enrollment Confirmation criteria. 
The IR will also administer the DSP-I and SDS. 
 
Due to possibilities of negative side effects of withdrawal from psychiatric medications, 
the Baseline CAPS-5 should be scheduled as close to the end of tapering as clinically 
appropriate so that participants who do not meet eligibility criteria can resume their 
previously prescribed medications as quickly as required for symptom management and 
participants who do meet criteria can be enrolled and treated as quickly as possible. 
 
7.2.3 Baseline: Preparatory Session 3 & Enrollment Confirmation 
Prior to Visit 4, the site team will review the results of the IR visit to ensure that the 
CAPS-[ADDRESS_135038] 28. Visit 4 should be scheduled 3 to 6 days after 
the Baseline CAPS-5 assessment and 1 to 4 days before Experimental Session 1 (Visit 5). 
At Visit 4, the site team will confirm eligibility by [CONTACT_120607]. If the 
participant continues to be eligible for the study, enrollment will be confirmed (after 
approval from the Medical Monitor for the initial participants until confidence is 
established). If any requirements are not met before or during Visit 4, the participant will 
be considered a Pre-randomization Early Termination.

7.3 Treatment Period 
During the Treatment Period, which occurs over a duration of 9 to 15 weeks (Visits 5 to 
18), participants will complete three treatments. Each treatment consists of an 
Experimental Session, followed the morning after by [CONTACT_120608], phone 
follow-ups over the next week, a second Integrative Session within [ADDRESS_135040] 
Integrative Session within 3 to 5 weeks. The Experimental Sessions will be scheduled 3 
to 5 weeks apart. The CAPS-5 will be assessed at two time points during the Treatment 
Period: CAPS-5 T2 after Integrative Session 1.2 (Visit 7) and CAPS-5 T3 after 
Integrative Session 2.2 (Visit 12). The Primary Outcome CAPS-5 (T4) will be assessed 
after the last Experimental Session during the Follow-up Period.
7.3.1 Experimental Sessions
There will be three blinded Experimental Sessions (Visits 5, 10, 15). Procedures for 
MDMA-assisted therapy will remain the same across all sessions and all procedures 
regardless of dose received. Experimental Sessions must be at least [ADDRESS_135041] of:
 Experimental Session 1 : (Visit 5) will occur 4 to 7 days after the Baseline CAPS-5

and discuss the participant’s goals, intentions, and concerns and some of the commonly 
experienced effects of MDMA. The choice of whether to keep the dose the same or 
change it from the first Experimental Session will be made by [CONTACT_120610], tolerability to the 
previously administered dose, and discussion with the participant.  
 If the participant continues to be eligible, the session will proceed. 
 Baseline blood pressure, body temperature, and pulse will be measured just prior to 
administration of the initial dose.

 The therapy pair or site physician shall remain available to participants via 24-hour 
cellular phone for integration, as needed. 
Overnight Stay (See Appendix A for sub-study with exceptions)
 
 Participants will remain overnight in an appropriately furnished room at or near the study 
site until after the Integrative Session the morning after each Experimental Session. The 
stay will be in an appropriately furnished room at the study site. With prior approval of 
the therapy pair, a companion may accompany the participant during the overnight stay.  
 An attendant will check in periodically on the participant during the overnight stay, even 
if a companion is present. The attendant will monitor participant condition and will help 
participants relax during the overnight stay. The attendant will be an individual with 
some previous training in caregiving and will be supportive but not intrusive. If there is 
an emergency or the participant needs additional support, the attendant can contact [CONTACT_120611].  
 The participant and a companion (if applicable) will receive information that will allow 
them to contact [CONTACT_120612].  
 Participants will be encouraged to use much of the time during their overnight stay for 
rest and as a period of reflection and integration in a quiet atmosphere. 
 
Participants may not drive until after the Integrative Session conducted on the day after the 
Experimental Session, as emotional processing may impair their attention and focus.  
 
7.3.[ADDRESS_135051], the therapy pair will:
 Inquire about any possible changes in health, assess the participant’s mental health and 
the status of any previously recorded AEs, and record AEs as described in Section 10.[ADDRESS_135052] Visit C-SSRS.

Upon completion of the study, defined as completing at least one Experimental Session 
and one CAPS assessment beyond Baseline, participants will be asked to join the LTFU 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation  MAPP2 Protocol  
IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: [ADDRESS_135061] 
Experimental Session. 
 
Upon unblinding after database lock, all participants who were assigned to placebo 
(regardless of final CAPS-5 scores), completed the study, meet criteria, and are in good 
standing with the clinical site, will be offered the opportunity to enroll in an open-label 
safety study using the same manualized MDMA-assisted therapy as administered during 
the study. This open-label safety study will take place at least [ADDRESS_135062] 19 to 38 weeks, similar to this protocol. 
Data from this study will be included in the sponsor’s overall safety database. 
 
Any sub-studies other than what is outlined in Appendix A will be detailed in separate 
documents. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Exit Plan
At Study Termination, participants will be provided with an Exit Plan. This Exit Plan will 
summarize treatments completed, current medications, and contact [CONTACT_120615]. Participants may request a referral for further 
therapeutic or medical care if appropriate. Enrolled participants who terminate the study 
early will be provided an Exit Plan at their last contact. Screen Failures will be provided a 
referral if requested.

8.1 Description of Active Compounds
The Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) to be used in this protocol is MDMA (as 
hydrochloride salt). This ring-substituted phenethylamine has a complex pharmacology, 
but it acts most prominently as a monoamine releaser and re-uptake inhibitor. Its direct 
actions on serotonergic, adrenergic, and other receptors are considerably lower. Refer to 
the IB for a comprehensive review of the pharmacology, effects and proposed 
mechanisms of action of the IMP. Mannitol and a lubricant, such as magnesium stearate,
will serve as inactive excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].
8.1.1 Doses
This study will compare the effects of three blinded manualized Experimental Sessions of 
therapy assisted by [CONTACT_120616]. Initial doses per Experimental 
Session include 80 mg or 120 mg MDMA HCl compounded with mannitol and 
magnesium stearate or indistinguishable weight placebos comprised entirely of mannitol 
and magnesium stearate, followed 1.5 to 2 hours later by a supplemental half-dose (40 
mg or 60 mg MDMA HCl or placebo). Total amounts of MDMA HCl to be administered 
per Experimental Session range from 80 mg to 180 mg. All drug is encapsulated with 
HPMC capsules.
Refer to Table 3: Dose Regimen of MDMA or Placebo . 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation  MAPP2 Protocol  
IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: [ADDRESS_135064] been assigned MDMA or placebo 
but can indicate if they want the dose to change or remain the same. 
 
8.1.3 Stability
IMP will be manufactured and packaged according to Good Manufacturing Practices 
(GMP). 6-month accelerated stability studies will be completed for the IMP along with an 
ambient stability study that will remain ongoing throughout the duration of the study. All 
required Chemistry Manufacturing and Control (CMC) submissions will be made to the 
IND.
8.2 Handling
8.2.1 Encapsulation, Packaging, and Labeling
The IMP for each Experimental Session will be packaged in one primary container, 
labeled with a unique container number, protocol number, blinded IMP name [CONTACT_120671], sponsor name, Experimental Session number and a statement that the IMP is 
restricted to clinical trial use only. All labels will comply with local, state, and federal 
regulations. The initial and supplemental dose will be packaged separately within the 
primary container. There will be one primary container per participant per Experimental 
Session.

fluid. 
 
A person at the site authorized to manage and administer controlled substances will 
dispense the appropriate container for each Experimental Session. If a supplemental dose 
is not administered, the unused IMP will be kept for accountability.  
 
Records pertaining to the use of scheduled, regulated compounds will be maintained in 
accordance with relevant federal and state regulations.  
 
8.2.5 Treatment Compliance 
Compliance to protocol required doses will be guaranteed by [CONTACT_120618]. All 
administered doses will be recorded for IMP accountability. The IMP will be stored 
securely per regulations. 
 
8.3 Randomization and Participant Numbering 
Every potential participant who is prescreened by [CONTACT_120619]-
approved script will be assigned a seven-character alphanumeric Screening Number and 
recorded on the Screening Log. This number will begin with ‘S4’ to identify that it is a 
Screening Number. The next two digits represent the site number (e.g., ‘11’), followed by 
a three-digit screening identifier starting with ‘401’. The screening identifier will be 
assigned to each prescreened participant at a site sequentially. For example, the first 
Screening Number at Site [ADDRESS_135067] two digits will be ‘22’. The next two 
digits represent the site number (e.g., ‘11’), followed by a three-digit participant identifier 
starting with ‘001’. The Participant Number will be assigned to each enrolled participant 
at a site sequentially. For example, the first Participant Number at Site 12 will be 
2212001. Eligible participants will be enrolled in the study and sequentially assigned an 
identification number. All participants will also be assigned a unique participant identifier 
within the database for use in analysis.  
 
Participants will be randomized in 1:1 allocation in a blinded fashion to the MDMA-
assisted therapy group and the placebo plus therapy group, stratified by [CONTACT_68566]. 
Randomization will be managed via an Interactive Web Randomization System (IWRS) 
based on a centralized randomization schedule developed by [CONTACT_120620]-party 
vendor to maintain blinding.  
 
8.4 Blinding and Bias Minimization 
Eligibility will be determined by [CONTACT_120621], site team and as needed 
the sponsor Medical Monitor prior to randomization. Participants, site staff, and the 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation  MAPP2 Protocol  
IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: [ADDRESS_135068] validity prior to randomization, the Senior IR will review video 
recordings of actual clinical interviews conducted by [CONTACT_120622]. The recordings of these 
interviews accompanied by [CONTACT_120623] 'dual' scoring of key rating instruments. This site-independent Senior IR 
reviewer either affirms subject eligibility or identifies administrative and/or clinical 
issues that may preclude study eligibility (screen failure). The Senior IR reviewer will 
invite the study team (including therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], site physician, and Clinical Investigator) to 
provide any additional information that may inform the Senior IR reviewer’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. 
The Senior IR reviewer will make the final judgment on whether or not the participant 
has an exclusionary diagnosis. 
 
To minimize bias, protect the study's double-blind and to ensure data quality, the sponsor 
will use a second Electronic Data Capture (EDC) database that is dedicated to the 
collection of critical primary and key secondary outcome measures, including the Total 
Severity Score on the CAPS-5 and item scores on the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), 
administered by [CONTACT_120624]. This second database 
is termed the Independent Rater Database (IRDB) and it will be separate from the 
blinded, clinical EDC database in order to ensure that site and sponsor staff engaged in 
study conduct are masked from study outcomes. The IRDB will only be accessible by: 
(1) qualified, observer-blind individuals who are in the established IR Pool, (2) the Senior 
IR responsible for oversight and data quality of the IR Pool, and (3) the IR Coordinator 
responsible for data entry based on paper Source Records completed by [CONTACT_120622]. All 
CAPS-5 and SDS scores and supporting documentation will be reviewed by [CONTACT_120625]. Frequent assessments of the CAPS-5 and timely entry 
into the EDC system will help ensure that data reviewed by [CONTACT_120626]. 
 
Once data is entered into the IRDB, the Senior IR will oversee the data quality by 
[CONTACT_120627] a risk-based approach. The risk-based 
monitoring methodology will utilize the following strategies: 1) To perform remote, 
source data review of the IRDB to check logic and to confirm reliability between the IR's, 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation  MAPP2 Protocol  
IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: 23 March 2021 
Page 73 of 110 2) To perform remote, source data verification to check the IRDB for administrative, data 
entry, or transcription errors made by [CONTACT_120628], and 3) To 
perform systematic line listing reviews for data trends and/or to trigger implementation of 
pre-defined, risk-mitigation strategies when specific data thresholds are exceeded.
 
To ensure that all participants regardless of group assignment are treated in a similar 
manner, the sites will be required to follow the protocol and Treatment Manual 
delineating minimum length of time per visit type and describing delivery of treatment. 
All Experimental Sessions are required to be at least [ADDRESS_135069] in an advisory capacity to the sponsor to monitor participant safety, 
data quality, and review Phase 3 outcomes to ensure the trial is conducted safely, 
ethically, and meets endpoint objectives. The DMC will be the only group reviewing 
group-unblinded interim data. The DMC will not be able to recommend early Study 
Termination for efficacy at the interim analysis, which will be conducted after N=[ADDRESS_135070] been enrolled. A single representative within MAPS will be designated to receive 
written communication of recommendations following the interim DMC review of the 
trial. This communication will be limited to the results needed for the decision of sample 
size re-estimation. The sponsor representative within MAPS and DMC members will sign 
a written confidentiality agreement in order that the precise rules governing sample size 
re-estimation may not be disclosed to the outside community. No other adaptions to the 
study design will be made based on this interim analysis. The sponsor representative from 
MAPS will not be part of any trial decisions or administration after the sample size re-
estimation has been communicated to MPBC who will continue to be the trial organizer. 
 
If there is an emergency requiring knowledge of a participant’s condition assignment, the 
blind may be broken for an individual participant through the IWRS. Upon database lock, 
the study will be unblinded and participants will be notified of treatment assignment.
 
9.0 Risks 
9.1 Non-drug Related Risks
9.1.1 Medical Assessments 
In preparation for MDMA-assisted therapy sessions, blood draws and a full medical 
examination, including a physical examination, ECG, 1-minute rhythm strip, and 
laboratory tests, are required to establish eligibility for the study. Temporary discomfort, 
inflammation, or infection could arise as a result of sampling blood at the punctured vein. 
Submitting to a full medical examination may also cause discomfort or psychological 
distress. Since medical examinations and blood draws are required to establish eligibility 
for the study, they cannot be omitted from the protocol. 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation  MAPP2 Protocol  
IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: 23 March 2021 
Page 74 of 110  
9.1.2 PTSD, Suicide Risk, and Therapy 
During Screening, throughout MDMA-assisted therapy, and during assessment of study 
measures, participants will be asked to think about and discuss their thoughts and 
emotions relating to the traumatic event or events. They may experience intense 
emotional responses or suicidal ideation as a result of recalling and speaking about this 
material. Even in a therapeutic context, thinking about and discussing the trauma, 
symptoms related to the trauma or the effects of PTSD on life function can produce 
distress and exacerbate suicidal ideation during and immediately after therapy sessions. 
Therapy is conducted as part of this study, and people undergoing therapy are expected to 
confront unpleasant thoughts, feelings and memories in the process. Because therapy is 
an integral part of the research study design, the potential distress arising from therapy is 
unavoidable. Therapy pairs will provide emotional support to participants during any 
psychological distress. 
 
The therapy pair will minimize risks by [CONTACT_120629] a current risk of suicidal behavior. Participants with a history of suicide 
attempts will not be excluded unless significant risk of suicidal ideation and/or behavior 
is detected, per Exclusion Criteria described in Section 3.2 . Participants will be enrolled 
according to the Eligibility Criteria based on the clinical judgment of the site physician, 
therapy pair, and Medical Monitor. 
 
A qualified individual will administer the C-SSRS according to  Table 6: Time and 
Events-Study Measures , and as needed depending on clinical presentation of the 
participants, to monitor for development and intensity of suicidal ideation and/or 
behavior. The therapy pair will implement the following plan to assess elevated or 
imminent suicide risk.
 
If the Since Last Visit C-SSRS reveals current serious Suicidal Ideation (scores of four or 
greater), indicating risk at the time of the assessment, or positive Suicidal Behavior 
(scores of one or greater), the participant will be referred for further management as 
described below: 
 
1. If the participant has current suicidal ideation, but no specific plan to commit suicide 
(Suicidal Ideation Score=4), the individual administering the C-SSRS will ensure: 
a. The participant is evaluated by [CONTACT_1755]/or site physician to determine 
an appropriate course of action. Findings will be discussed with the participant 
and their personal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], if applicable. 
b. Regular check-ins via phone or in-person will be continued until the participant 
has stabilized or a new course of action is taken based on changes in C-SSRS 
score and/or ongoing clinical assessment. 
c. Notification of the sponsor within [ADDRESS_135071] (AESI) per Section 10.1.1 and 
evaluated for seriousness. SAEs will be reported per regulatory guidance. 
d. Treatment would be continued when deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_120630], unless it is determined that treatment should be discontinued, 
in which case the participant will enter follow-up. 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation  MAPP2 Protocol  
IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: 23 March 2021 
Page 75 of 110 2. If the participant has suicidal ideation, and a plan to commit suicide (Suicidal Ideation 
Score=5) or positive Suicidal Behavior (Score greater than or equal to 1), the individual 
administering the C-SSRS will assess whether the risk is imminent. A Suicidal Ideation 
score of five does not necessarily indicate an immediate risk if the thoughts are fleeting, 
fairly easily controlled, and deterrents are strong. If there is no imminent risk, the 
individual will follow the procedure described above. If there is imminent risk of suicidal 
behavior, the individual will ensure: 
a. Participants are evaluated by [CONTACT_120631], and the therapy pair will contact [CONTACT_120632][INVESTIGATOR_541], who will be invited to come to the study site to assist, depending on 
their location. 
b. If it is determined that the participant is at imminent risk of suicide, the therapy 
pair will do one of the following: 
i. Escort the participant to the emergency department (ED); 
ii. Escort the participant to an appropriate mental health services facility 
(e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120496]); or  
iii. Call emergency medical services (EMS) and ensure that the participant is 
transferred to the responding medical personnel. 
c. If the participant will not comply and wishes to leave without consultation, call 
EMS. Explain that the participant is in immediate danger of committing suicide. 
Provide a complete description of the participant and give any other needed 
details to ensure the participant’s safety. 
d. Notification of appropriate members of the study team and sponsor 
representatives within [ADDRESS_135072] been developed based on Phase 2 and Phase 
3 PTSD trials whichexclude potential participants with pre-existing exclusionary medical 
conditions that would exacerbate risk. The therapy pairs and site physicians are available 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation  MAPP2 Protocol  
IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: 23 March 2021 
Page 76 of 110 via telephone throughout the study if any problem occurs when a participant is not at the 
site. In the event of a medical emergency or any other medical problem during an 
Experimental Session, the site physician should be immediately available by [CONTACT_756], 
and based on assessment of the situation, they should make the decision to either evaluate 
the participant themselves at the site or arrange for transfer of the participant to the 
Emergency Department.  
 
Further information on the risks associated with MDMA can be found in the IB and risk 
mitigation procedures are described by [CONTACT_120633]. Risk Categories were 
determined by [CONTACT_120634] (RACT).  
 
9.2.[ADDRESS_135073] assessment that new or many procedures, which are not complex, are needed to 
ensure screening is adequate to eliminate or manage the risk in the patient population. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Risks and Mitigation 
MDMA is known to transiently increase heart rate and blood pressure in a dose-
dependent manner that is generally not problematic for physically healthy individuals. 
These changes should last no more than [ADDRESS_135074] people do not experience elevations 
in cardiovascular parameters that exceed those seen after moderate exercise. An 
examination of safety data drawn from Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies of MDMA-assisted 
therapy detected a dose-dependent increase in SBP and to a lesser extent DBP. 
Characterization of sympathomimetic effects among participants with controlled 
hypertension is ongoing.  
 
Risks posed by [CONTACT_120635]-
existing uncontrolled hypertension and monitoring blood pressure and pulse, as described 
in Section 3.2 Exclusion Criteria . Before and after IMP administration in Experimental 
Sessions, the therapy teams monitor vital signs. The therapy teams should attend to 
clinical signs and symptoms of potential rare complications of the cardiovascular effects 
of MDMA, such as stroke or acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during Experimental 
Sessions. Any symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, neurological deficit or 
confusion or other potential indicators of end organ effects should prompt additional vital 
sign measurements, and intervention if appropriate. Therapy teams should notify the site 
physician if this occurs for evaluation.  
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation  MAPP2 Protocol  
IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: 23 March 2021 
Page 77 of 110  
If any participant has neurological deficits, as assessed by [CONTACT_120636], whether or 
not they are associated with hypertensive crisis, they should be monitored, as described 
above and transported to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120497]. If evaluation at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120498], there will be sufficient time to administer recombinant 
tissue plasminogen within the 3-hour time frame recommended in the 2019 American 
Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) guidelines [ 108].
If a participant experiences ischemic type chest pain, whether or not it is associated with 
hypertensive crisis, the study physician will be contact[CONTACT_15608], and the participant 
will be taken to an emergency room by [CONTACT_120637]/AHA and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines. Pending 
transport to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120499]. If further evaluation at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120500], they will be well within the time frame 
required for definitive therapy. 
 
Any participant who experiences such medical complications during an Experimental 
Session will not be given another Experimental Session. 
 
QT interval will be evaluated in the event of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120501]. If at any time a participant develops a QT/QTc 
interval that is exclusionary per eligibility criteria or of >30 ms over Baseline during 
ECG evaluation, the participant should be discontinued from treatment.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Psychological Risks and Mitigation 
Mild anxiety and depressed mood are occasionally reported 1 to 3 days after MDMA 
administration [ 49, 109]. Psychological distress from MDMA could arise from the first 
indications of MDMA effects until the last effects have dissipated or even later. Anxiety 
or distress during the session may last for as little as [ADDRESS_135075] with acute or sub-acute reactions. The potential for destabilizing psychological 
distress will be minimized by:
 
 [CONTACT_120638] (such as people diagnosed with 
bipolar affective disorder type 1 or with psychotic disorders). 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation  MAPP2 Protocol  
IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: [ADDRESS_135076] management techniques, will 
talk with the participant to help them gain cognitive perspective of theirexperiences, and 
will help the participant implement the self-soothing and stress inoculation techniques 
presented during the Preparatory Sessions. If the participant remains severely anxious, 
agitated, in danger of self-harm or suicide, or is otherwise psychologically unstable at the 
end of the 2-hour stabilization period, the site physician and therapy pair will decide 
between the following options:
 
1. If severe distress occurs at the end of an Experimental Session, a nurse, therapeutic 
assistant, physician, or therapy pair member should stay with the participant until the 
severe distress resolves or until the time of their Integrative Session appointment the 
following morning. The therapy pair should then meet with the participant daily until the 
period of destabilization has passed.  
2. If the participant experiences severe, persisting emotional distress, such as panic attacks, 
severe generalized anxiety, or insomnia following an Experimental Session, a site 
physician may prescribe a benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (specifically, lorazepam) and/or sleep aid (e.g., 
zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730]). The route, frequency, and dose should be determined by [CONTACT_120636]. If 
these medications are stocked on site, they should be stored according to applicable 
national and local regulations. This medication will be captured on the Concomitant 
Medications eCRF. The site physician should not prescribe an SSRI, SNRI, or 
monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) in this context, unless it has been determined that 
the participant will be withdrawn from the study. Residual symptoms will be addressed 
during the frequent follow-up therapy visits with the therapy pair. 
3. If a participant should become psychotic, arrangements should be made to stabilize them 
or transfer them to the Emergency Department if hospi[INVESTIGATOR_98929]. Any 
participant who is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2770] a severe psychological reaction will be suspended 
from the protocol until after recovery or stabilization, at which time the investigator 
and/or site physician will carefully evaluate the participant’s emotional status.  
 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation  MAPP2 Protocol  
IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: [ADDRESS_135077], the participant’s outside therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541](s) should be involved in 
the management of any psychiatric complications. For those participants engaged in an 
ongoing psychotherapeutic relationship with the investigator or member of the therapy 
pair, the management of any psychiatric complications should be undertaken by [CONTACT_120639]’s therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. 
 
9.2.[ADDRESS_135078] assessment that no new or complex procedures are needed to ensure screening is 
adequate to eliminate or manage the risk in the patient population. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Thermoregulatory Risks and Mitigation 
MDMA administered in a controlled setting produces only a slight increase in body 
temperature [ 109]. Ambient temperature does not enhance or attenuate this slight 
elevation in humans. In data gathered from sponsor-supported Phase 2 and Phase 3 
studies, it was found that compared to placebo, a higher percentage of participants 
receiving MDMA had peak body temperatures greater than 1 degree Celsius (°C) above 
baseline. However, there was no strong relationship between dose of MDMA and peak 
body temperature or between MDMA dose and elevation above threshold of 1°C above 
baseline. 
 
Ambient temperature should be kept at a comfortable level during Experimental Sessions. 
If a participant’s temperature rises more than 1°C or the participant states that they feel 
hot, attempts should be made to decrease body temperature and increase comfort by 
[CONTACT_120640], decreasing the ambient temperature, and, if 
necessary, directing a fan toward the participant. If at any time the temperature rises more 
than 1.5°C above baseline despi[INVESTIGATOR_120502], the site physician should be consulted for 
further evaluation and treatment. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Osmoregulatory Risk and Mitigation
MDMA administered in a controlled setting is not expected to have any risks of 
osmoregulatory changes. Participants are not allowed to drink more than three liters of 
water over the course of the Experimental Session and fluid intake will be spread out 
appropriately during the session. If a participant exhibits any signs of toxicity or 
clinically significant dilutional hyponatremia despi[INVESTIGATOR_120503], they should not receive another Experimental Session unless it is 
approved by [CONTACT_093], site physician, and the Medical Monitor.
[IP_ADDRESS] Genotoxicity Risk and Mitigation
The standard genotoxicity battery for MDMA has demonstrated that MDMA is negative 
for in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity, both with and without metabolic activation.
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation  MAPP2 Protocol  
IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: 23 March 2021 
Page 80 of 110 [IP_ADDRESS] Reproductive and Developmental Risks and Mitigation
There are no data from the use of MDMA in pregnant women. In the absence of these 
data, epi[INVESTIGATOR_120504]. One of two 
studies of Ecstasy users suggest that use of Ecstasy and polydrug use during pregnancy 
may be associated with some abnormalities at birth while the other failed to find this 
association [ 110, 111]. 
Studies in rats and rabbits have not shown direct or indirect harmful effects with respect 
to reproductive toxicity. Repeated dose toxicity studies of adequate duration, fertility, 
early embryonic development, and embryofetal development studies of MDMA with 
toxicokinetics have been completed. These studies established the NOAEL dose to be 
excluded 
both sexes of the rat for fertility, reproductive performance, and for maternal and 
developmental toxicity in the rabbit. The NOAEL dose was the highest dose level 
evalua
toxicity in the rat. Due to the short half-life and single-dose dosing regimen of MDMA, 
pre- and post-natal development studies are not considered necessary for assessment of 
risk to the unborn. Assessment of embryofetal risk based on all available non-clinical and 
clinical data supports unlikely human teratogenicity/fetotoxicity in early pregnancy. On 
the basis of male fertility studies, the embryofetal risk posed from treatment of male 
participants with MDMA is also unlikely.  
 
PABP are included in the studies in this program, defined as those who are fertile, 
following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile. 
Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_96802]. Postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for [ADDRESS_135079] dose of MDMA. The end of relevant systemic exposure to 
MDMA is approximately 48 hours [ 113].  
 
9.2.[ADDRESS_135080] assessment that no procedures are needed beyond basic monitoring to 
ensure screening is adequate to eliminate or manage the risk in the patient population. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Common Expected AEs 
Common expected AEs were typi[INVESTIGATOR_120505], but were 
transient and typi[INVESTIGATOR_120506] 
[ADDRESS_135081] common adverse events 
reported more frequently in the MDMA group were muscle tightness, decreased appetite, 
dizziness, nausea, hyperhidrosis, feeling cold, restlessness, mydriasis, dizziness 
(postural), bruxism, nystagmus, increased blood pressure, feeling jittery, chest pain (non-
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation  MAPP2 Protocol  
IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: 23 March 2021 
Page 81 of 110 cardiac), dry mouth, vision blurred, pollakiuria, intrusive thoughts, vomiting, stress, and 
musculoskeletal chest pain. AEs were typi[INVESTIGATOR_115216]-limiting.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Neurotoxicity Risk 
It does not appear that MDMA-assisted therapy negatively impacts cognitive function 
based on data from Phase 2 studies sponsored by [CONTACT_120553]. The sponsor has carefully 
considered the risks of such neurotoxicity and conclude that they are minimal in the 
proposed study. This conclusion is supported by [CONTACT_62866][INVESTIGATOR_120507].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Abuse Potential 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_120508] a Schedule I drug, an examination of findings in humans and 
animals suggests that MDMA possesses moderate abuse potential that is higher than that 
reported for “classic hallucinogens” like psilocybin, but lower than that reported for 
psychostimulants, such as cocaine or methamphetamine. There have been no AESIs 
reported in Phase [ADDRESS_135082] 12 months after participation in a MAPS-sponsored 
early Phase 2 PTSD study of MDMA-assisted therapy found that 8.7% (8 of 92) 
participants reported using Ecstasy subsequent to study participation, with 6 of these 8 
participants having used Ecstasy prior to study enrollment. Several participants 
volunteered that they would not seek out MDMA outside of a psychotherapeutic setting.

IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: [ADDRESS_135083] AEs during study visits from 
Enrollment (Visit 0) through Study Termination (Visit 20). Participants will be asked 
directly how they are feeling during each contact, and AEs may be captured 
spontaneously during therapy sessions, telephone calls, or other correspondence. 
Completed measures may create suspi[INVESTIGATOR_120509]; in this case, the site staff 
should follow-up with the participant. 
 
All AEs will be monitored by [CONTACT_120641], if the AE becomes 
chronic, a cause can be identified. If an AE is unresolved when a participant terminates 
from the study, a clinical assessment will be made by [CONTACT_120636], investigator, 
and/or Medical Monitor as to whether continued follow-up of the AE is warranted.
 
The severity of events reported on the “Adverse Events” eCRF will be determined by [CONTACT_120642]:
 
 Mild: No limitation in normal daily activity 
 Moderate : Some limitation in normal daily activity 
 Severe: Unable to perform normal daily activity 
 
The relationship of each AE to the IMP will be determined via analysis and the opi[INVESTIGATOR_120510], with the exception of SAEs.

In accordance with the guidance for a specific study site location, Health Canada Clinical 
Safety Data Management Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting ICH Topic 
E2A: Guidance for Industry or FDA Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and 
BA/BE Studies, the sponsor will pay special attention to a subset of AEs involving 
cardiac function that could be indicative of QT interval prolongation or cardiac 
arrhythmias, including Torsade de pointes, sudden death, ventricular extrasystoles, 
ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation and flutter, non-postural syncope, and 
seizures. 
The subset of AEs involving suicide risk under the following terms are also of special 
interest:
 suicides 
 suicide attempts  
 self-injurious behavior associated with suicidal ideation  
 suicidal ideation assessed as a 4 or 5 on the C-SSRS  
 suicidal ideation judged to be serious or severe in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871].  
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation  MAPP2 Protocol  
IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: 23 March 2021 
Page 83 of 110  
These AEs will be marked in the eCRF with the denotation “Adverse Event of Special 
Interest” (AESIs) whether serious or non-serious. 
 
In order to assess signals of abuse potential for the IMP in the intended patient 
population: 
 
AESIs involving the terms of Behavioral addiction, Drug abuser, Substance abuser, 
Dependence, Intentional product misuse, Overdose (accidental, intentional, or 
prescribed), or Drug diversion in cases that are related to MDMA or “Ecstasy” (material 
represented as MDMA) will be collected and coded as AESIs in the eCRF. 
 Cases of noncompliance, protocol violations, participants lost to follow-up, and any other 
reasons why participants dropped out of the study will be assessed for presence of AESIs. 
 Qualitative urine drug test data will be collected prior to each Experimental Session. Any 
positive findings that cannot be attributed to pre-approved concomitant medications or 
diet will be reviewed by [CONTACT_120643]. 
 
If an AESI is a SAE or if it involves suicide risk, it should be reported to the sponsor with 
a narrative via the eCRF within 24 hours of the site’s awareness of the event.
 
10.1.2 Serious Adverse Events
In accordance with guidance for the specific study site, Health Canada Clinical Safety 
Data Management Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting ICH Topic E2A: 
Guidance for Industry or FDA Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE 
Studies, an SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
 Results in death. 
 Is life-threatening (i.e., the participant was, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], at 
immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred); it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
 Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the event causes substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions). 
 Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 Requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage. 
 Is an important and significant medical event that may not be immediately life-
threatening or resulting in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, may jeopardize the participant or may require intervention to prevent one of 
the other outcomes listed above. 
 
AEs which do not fall into these categories are defined as non-serious. It should be noted 
that a severe Adverse Event need not be serious in nature and that a SAE need not, by 
[CONTACT_108], be severe. 
 
In addition, a pre-existing event or condition that results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120511]. The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120512] a study-related SAE, unless, in the view of the site physician,

IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: 23 March 2021 
Page 84 of 110 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120513] a result of participation in the clinical trial or was 
necessary due to a worsening of the pre-existing condition. This is because the onset of 
the event (the reason for the procedure) occurred before the participant was entered in the 
trial. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120514], non-emergency prophylaxis, or elective abortion does 
not result in an SAE report, unless, in the view of the site physician, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120515] a result of participation in the clinical trial.
 
All SAEs will be collected from enrollment through Study Termination. All SAEs which 
occur during the course of the trial, whether considered to be associated with IMP or not, 
must be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of the site staff’s awareness of 
occurrence. Reporting procedures will be provided to the site. All SAEs will be assessed 
for relationship, expectedness and any required actions to address safety at the time of 
reporting of the event. SAEs will be evaluated by [CONTACT_120644]-

are premenarchal, surgically sterile (documented hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], 
bilateral oophorectomy, and/or tubal ligation), permanently sterile by [CONTACT_120645], postmenopausal, or assigned male at birth.  
 
10.3.2 Contraception Guidelines 
Study participants who were assigned male at birth with partners of childbearing potential 
will not be required to practice birth control. Adequate birth control methods are required 
for participants of childbearing potential and include: 
 
 Intrauterine device (IUD) 
 Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS) 
 Non-oral hormonal methods, including injected, intravaginal, implanted, transdermal 
 Oral hormones plus a barrier contraception (condom, diaphragm, or spermicide)

prospective participant is being treated with psychiatric medications at enrollment, the 
prospective participant will be encouraged to discuss medication tapering with their 
outside treating physician, if any, and will be required to give the site physician 
permission to do so as well. Additionally, participants who are taking prohibited opi[INVESTIGATOR_120516]-tapered to an allowable opi[INVESTIGATOR_2573] (hydrocodone, morphine, and codeine) under 
the care of their prescribing physician.

course appropriate for the medication based on its half-life, with the Baseline CAPS-5 T1 
(Visit 3) scheduled to occur after complete washout for psychoactive medications and 
Experimental Session 1 (Visit 5) scheduled to occur after complete washout for 
medications with drug-drug interactions without a psychological concern (five half-lives 
plus at least 1 week for stabilization).
 
The therapy pair will request information about any changes in medication at each 
contact. The site physician will be responsible for reviewing and confirming all 
medications collected during the study. 
 
All medications, non-prescription and prescription, will be collected from Screening 
through [ADDRESS_135090]

medications taken to treat AEs will be collected. Throughout the protocol, all medications 
used to treat AEs will be collected, and all changes including discontinuations or 
additions to medications will be collected. The study team will also inquire about 
concomitant medication adherence and document all information on the Concomitant 
Medications eCRF. 
 
Participants may return to taking psychiatric medications and discontinue birth control 
after the final Study Termination visit if necessary. 
 
11.2 Allowed Concomitant Medications 
The site physician may prescribe necessary and appropriate medications in accordance 
with local and state regulations during the study to treat AEs that do not respond to other 
management outlined in the Treatment Manual. Examples include concomitant 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_120518] (for example, lorazepam at modest doses and 
occasional use only to avoid withdrawal effects of discontinuation between Experimental 
Sessions) or sleep aids (excluding trazodone) in compliance with Section 11.3 Prohibited 
Medications .  
 
Gabapentin or certain opi[INVESTIGATOR_120519]. The

administration. 
 
If the participant is on stimulants for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) at 
Baseline, they can continue to use them at the same dose and frequency, as long as they 
discontinue five half-lives before each Experimental Session and do not restart for [ADDRESS_135092]: 
 
 Refrain from the use of any psychoactive medication not approved by [CONTACT_120577] (with the exception of gabapentin or certain

13.2.1 Efficacy Analyses
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Outcome 
The primary analysis will be conducted after all participants complete Study Termination 
(V20) and the study database has been locked. The de jure estimand  of treatment efficacy 
will be used to estimate the causal effect of MDMA-assisted therapy on PTSD symptom 
severity in the intended population of patients with PTSD from any cause. All efficacy 
analyses will be based on the mITT analysis set. The primary treatment comparison will 
be made at a 2-sided, 0.0499 level of alpha. The primary estimator of effects of initially 
randomized treatments will be the difference between groups in mean change in CAPS-5 
Total Severity Scores from Baseline to 18 weeks after randomization (Visit 19). Least 
squares means from a restricted maximum likelihood (REML)-based MMRM will be 
used to compare treatment groups at Visit 19. Baseline CAPS-5 Total Severity Score and 
dissociative subtype based on CAPS-5 will be included as covariates in the MMRM 
model. CAPS-5 data collected after treatment discontinuation will not be included in the 
de jure estimand. Missing data will not be imputed. Details of analysis of are described in 
the Statistical Analysis Plan.

Longitudinal CAPS-[ADDRESS_135096]. Cohen’s d IGPP effect size of MDMA 
will be estimated using Cohen’s techniques.  
 
An exploratory responder analysis will further characterize clinical significance of PTSD

categories: 
 
 Treatment Response : 10-point or greater reduction in CAPS-5 Total Severity Score 
 Loss of Diagnosis : 10-point or greater reduction in CAPS-5 Total Severity Score and no 
longer meeting PTSD diagnostic criteria on CAPS-5 
 Remission : CAPS-5 Total Severity Score of 11 or less and no longer meeting PTSD 
diagnostic criteria on CAPS-5 
 
Exploratory sub-group analyses may be conducted when possible to evaluate efficacy by 
[CONTACT_120649] (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity, 
index trauma, dissociative subtype of PTSD, presence of secondary traumatic stressors 
during the assessment period with LEC-5, medication tapering, diagnosis of comorbid

re-estimation. The detailed results of the interim analysis will not be revealed to the site 
staff, participants, IRs, or sponsor staff/designees except for a single designated sponsor 
representative from MAPS. The independent DMC statistician will perform the 
unblinded administrative interim analysis as described in the DMC Charter. In addition, 
procedures will be developed to ensure the blinding of the participant level data for 
parties outside of the Independent Statistical Group (ISG). 
 
Following the DMC review of the MAPP1 results, the iDMC may recommend changes to 
the purpose and criteria of the interim analysis. For instance, the iDMC may recommend 
adding an efficacy interim analysis executed at a specific number of subjects with 
primary endpointdata. Regardless of the iDMCs suggested changes, overall type-I error 
will be preserved.    
 
Sample size re-estimation: Based on the result of calculating conditional power using the 
estimated effect size from the first 60% of participants in the mITT set, the sample size 
may be increased. The DMC will review the group-unblinded interim analysis results 
provided by [CONTACT_120650]. The designated sponsor representative from MAPS 
will provide written information to the trial organizer delegate of MPBC indicating how 
many participants, if any, to add but will not provide any information on the 
corresponding conditional power the additional participants are being added to achieve. 
Only the re-estimation of sample size will be completed at the interim analysis, this will 
not be used to drop or add treatment arms or doses, change entry criteria, change 
randomization ratio or change Primary Endpoint. The sponsor representative from MAPS 
will not be part of any trial decisions or administration after the sample size re-estimation 
has been communicated to MPBC who will continue to be the trial organizer. The full

The objective of the DMC Charter is to outline the specific purposes and functions of the 
DMC. In addition, it describes the procedures for data abstraction and data delivery 
conventions to and from the DMC members for review purposes. Access to the DMC 
charter will be restricted to the DMC and only limited specified sponsor staff who were 
involved in the trial design.
 
The DMC will periodically receive blinded safety reports and may receive aggregate data 
on the key secondary outcome measure, the SDS, to assess suitability of continuation of 
the study based on the risk/benefit profile and make recommendations as necessary. The 
objective of the DMC safety review is to monitor the safety of the subjects enrolled and 
to be enrolled in the study. The DMC may also review the results of MAPP1 and make 
recommendations on updating the adaptive design elements to the study protocol, interim 
analysis, and/or data analysis of the MAPP2 study. 
 
A single representative within MAPS will be designated to receive written 
communication of recommendations following DMC review of the trial. This 
communication will be limited to the DMC recommendation needed for the decision of 
sample size re-estimation. The sponsor representative within MAPS and DMC members 
will sign a written confidentiality agreement in the case that additional participants must 
be enrolled to ensure this is not disclosed to the outside community.

be revised whenever important new information becomes available that may be relevant 
to the participant’s consent. Any revised ICF and written information should receive 
approval from an IRB before use. The participant should be informed in a timely manner 
if new information becomes available that may affect the decision to take part or continue 
in the study. The communication of this information should be documented. Participants 
can withdraw consent at any time without prejudice. If a participant withdraws consent 
but does not revoke the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) 
authorization, the study team will have full access to their medical records, including 
termination visit information. If a participant revokes only the HIPAA authorization, the 
study team will have full access to all medical records prior to the date and time of 
revocation.

monitoring via the EDC system to develop and evaluate strategies for correction across 
sites. Sites will be monitored as appropriate for the rate of enrollment to comply with 
GCP guidelines and to ensure validity of study data. During each monitoring visit, source 
data verification will be performed to ensure compliance, including accurate and 
complete recording of data on eCRFs, source records, and IMP accountability records. 
An eCRF collation will be completed for each participant enrolled within the EDC 
system. 
 
CAPS-5 results will not be sent to site staff but instead will be sent to the IR Coordinator. 
The IR Coordinator will be responsible for review and data entry of the CAPS-5 source 
records into CAPS-5 eCRFs which will be blinded to sponsor and site personnel during 
the study.  
 
Videos from selected sessions will be reviewed for adherence to the Treatment Manual as 
described in Section 5.4. Findings from video reviews may be discussed with therapy 
teams as needed to ensure continued adherence to the protocol. 
 
During or after the study, the regulatory authorities, the IRB, and/or representatives of the 
sponsor may request access to all source documents, eCRFs, and other protocol 
documentation for on-site audit or inspection. Monitoring and auditing procedures will be 
supplied in a separate document.

individuals analyzing data. Researchers, other than the investigators who are directly 
involved in the protocol, with access to data will not be provided with any information 
that would identify participants by [CONTACT_120651], such as social security 
number. 
 
Maintaining data in a secure environment will prevent the accidental or deliberate 
examination or removal of data. The sponsor will utilize confidentiality procedures to 
assure participant privacy. Audiovisual recordings are necessary for sponsor oversight of 
therapy processes. Any requests for use of audiovisual recordings outside of research and 
training requests will result in participants receiving information on the request. 
Participants will have control over any presentation of audiovisual recordings beyond 
viewing by [CONTACT_120652], sponsor staff, or regulatory agencies. The sponsor 
uses encrypted, secure technology to transfer and store recordings, but there is always a 
risk of a security breach. The sponsor is committed to taking preventative measures to 
avoid such an event. In the case of a security breach, the participant will be notified, and 
all efforts will be made to minimize the dissemination of recorded content. 
 
Clinical trial data other than audiovisual recordings will be hosted on an EDC system that 
is FDA-compliant. All data entered into this system will be de-identified. Participants 
will only be referred to by [CONTACT_94202] a secondary identifier code. Source Records and 
identifying information will be retained at clinical sites per GCP. The sponsor will train 
the study staff on EDC procedures. Each study staff member with access to the data will 
be given an individual password.
 
The sponsor has developed a feature that will allow participants to create a password and 
enter their self-report questionnaire data directly into Medrio using the electronic 
Participant Reported Outcome (ePRO) feature. Participants will be reminded by [CONTACT_120653]. Participant emails will be treated as Protected Health Information (PHI) in

study. To cover these costs, the sponsor carries third-party insurance.  
 
The sponsor will not cover costs of ongoing treatment unrelated to the study due to pre-

Page 98 of 110 14.7 Publication Policy
The sponsor recognizes the importance of communicating medical research and scientific 
data and their obligations to participants enrolled in a study and therefore, encourage 
publication of such material in reputable scientific journals and at professional and/or 
academic seminars or conferences. For multi-center studies, it is intended that the first 
publication of the study’s primary clinical data be co-authored by [CONTACT_120655]. Inclusion of Clinical 
Investigators in the authorship of any multi-center publication will be based upon 
substantial contribution to the design, analysis, interpretation of data, drafting and/or 
critically revising any manuscript(s) derived from the Study. All publications will follow 
ICMJE Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing, and Publication of 
Scholarly Work in Medical Journals, unless other guidelines are required by [CONTACT_18038]. 
It is understood by [CONTACT_120656]. To allow for the use of 
information derived from the study, it is understood that the investigators are obliged to 
provide the sponsor with complete test results, all study data, and access to all study 
records. It is mandatory that all data analysis is done on the official monitored sponsor 
database and that the analysis plan is agreed upon with the sponsor statistician. 
 
Any results of medical investigations with the sponsor and/or 
publication/lecture/manuscripts based thereon shall be exchanged and discussed by [CONTACT_120657]. Due regard 
shall be given to the sponsor's legitimate interests, e.g., manuscript authorship, obtaining 
optimal patient protection, coordinating and maintaining submissions to health 
authorities, and coordinating with other ongoing studies in the same field. The full details 
of the processes of producing and reviewing reports, manuscripts, and presentations 
based on the data from this trial will be described in the Clinical Trial Agreement.

Page 99 of 110 Appendix A: Sub-study without Overnight Stays 
Rationale 
 
This sub-study to the MAPP2 protocol “A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-
Controlled, Multi-Site Phase 3 Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Manualized MDMA-
Assisted therapy for the Treatment of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder of Moderate or 
Greater Severity" allows participants to be discharged in the evening after the 
Experimental Session is over at select investigational study sites. In MAPS’ Phase [ADDRESS_135110] from the distractions of home, and to 
facilitate the logistics of participation in the integrative visit at the site on the day 
following the Experimental Session. The overnight stay is not required for medical 
reasons, but in case of emergencies, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_120528]-call for all 
sites. 
 
In the main study protocol, a Night Attendant accompanies the participant during the 
overnight stay. The Night Attendant’s primary function is to ensure the participant is 
comfortable and has a meal, to provide minimal support, and to alert qualified site staff in 
case of need expressed by [CONTACT_120658]. All Night 
Attendants are interviewed, trained, and approved by [CONTACT_120659].  
 
Medically-trained Night Attendants have not been required for any of the five Phase [ADDRESS_135111] 
arisen during overnight stays under the watch of Night Attendants. 
 
The sponsor and investigators agree that allowing participants who are screened for stable 
domestic circumstances to return home will not increase the risks of participation in the 
study. The study protocol discusses the risk of psychological distress in a PTSD 
population and mitigation in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_120529], including anxiety and depressed mood occasionally reported [ADDRESS_135112] responded well to reassurance from the therapy pair, with occasional 
use of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_120530]. If needed, the study physician may prescribe a short-
acting, low-dose benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (specifically, lorazepam) or sleep aids (excluding 
trazodone) as needed. 
 
MAPS Public Benefit Corporation  MAPP2 Protocol  
IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: [ADDRESS_135113] with acute or sub-
acute reactions. The potential for destabilizing psychological distress will be minimized 
by:
 [CONTACT_120638] (such as people diagnosed with 
bipolar affective disorder type 1 or with psychotic disorders). 
 Excluding people who do not have a stable living situation or supportive family/network. 
 Preparatory Sessions of non-drug therapy before the Experimental Session. 
 Creating an atmosphere of trust during the Experimental Session. 
 Close monitoring. 
 Phone contact [CONTACT_120660]. 
 Conduct of Integrative Session on the morning after the Experimental Session. 
 
Specific to sub-study:
 Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_120531]. 
 A support person identified by [CONTACT_120661][INVESTIGATOR_120532]. 
 The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_120533]. 
 A support person must assist the participant during transfer from study site after the 
Experimental Session and to the study site on the following morning for the Integrative 
Session. This Integrative Session will start later in the day to allow for logistics of 
transportation. Participants can arrange their own transportation after the Integrative 
Session. 
  
Implementation of Sub-study
 
All eligibility criteria from the main study protocol will apply, except for the following 
inclusion criteria listed as a Lifestyle Modification:
Post Experimental Session
 Are willing to remain overnight at the study site after each Experimental Session until 
after the Integrative Session the next morning (for exceptions see Appendix A sub-study) 
 Agree not to drive after the Experimental Sessions until after the Integrative Session the 
next morning. 
 
Sub-study participants will be required to be willing to:
 
Post Experimental Session 
 Identify a support person willing to accompany them overnight at a safe location of their 
choice after each Experimental Session. 
 Have the support person escort them away from the study site in the evening after the 
Experimental Sessions and to the site on the following morning for the Integrative 
Session. The Integrative Session may happen remotely if approved by [CONTACT_5051].

IND #063384  Amendment 4 Version 1: 23 March 2021 
Page 101 of 110 Screening & Preparatory Periods
 
During the Screening and Preparatory Period, the participant will identify an appropriate 
support person to stay with the participant on the evening of the Experimental Session. 
Participants will be escorted to and from the study site after Experimental Sessions. The 
support person is not required to be the same as the escort for the participant. There may 
be more than one support person(s), and they will be responsible for providing 
companionship as needed overnight and contact[CONTACT_120662]. Any support person spending the night with the participant will meet the 
therapy pair, during the Preparatory Period or in advance of the appropriate Experimental 
Session in-person to be oriented to the role. An escort who is responsible only for 
transportation need not meet with the therapy pair to perform that role. The participant 
will provide contact [CONTACT_120663](s) in advance of each 
Experimental Session. 
 
Orienting the Support Person 
 
In advance of the appropriate Experimental Session, the support person staying with the 
participant overnight will be required to meet with the therapy pair in person. The support 
person will receive printed instructions, including contact [CONTACT_120664], therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], investigator, and Study Coordinator and what to do in the case of an 
emergency.  
 
The support person will not provide therapy to the participant. Minimal discussion is 
acceptable, but only if initiated by [CONTACT_2299]. The support person should not interpret 
the participant’s experience or act as therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. The therapy pair will discuss this 
explicitly with the support person and include this information in the written instructions.
 
The main roles of the support person include:
 
Ensuring the participant has a comfortable place to sleep and discuss the plan for wakeup, 
breakfast, and travel time for the next day’s Integrative Session. 
 Seeing to the participant’s needs for food and liquids, including providing dinner and 
breakfast in accordance with the participant’s dietary preferences. 
 Eating with the participant unless they ask to be left alone. 
 Cleaning up after the participant, including doing the dishes and handling bedding 
 Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_120534]. 
 Ensuring the participant is safely transported to and from the study site as appropriate 
(may be completed by a separate support person). 
 Ensuring that the participant does not leave the overnight site without accompaniment 
and does not leave the participant alone at the overnight site. The participant may have 
privacy at the overnight site. 
 Supervising the participant to ensure they do not consume drugs or alcohol on the night 
of the Experimental Session and that phone/computer time is limited. 
 Remaining sober throughout the entire overnight stay. 
 Remaining available to participant’s needs throughout the night, but may sleep if the 
participant is sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007].

Page 102 of 110 End of Experimental Sessions 
 
Consistent with the main protocol, at the end of each Experimental Session, the therapy 
pair and site physician will assess the participant to decide if they are physically and 
emotionally stable. If the participant is not stable, the therapy pair and/or site physician 
will stay with the participant until stable or escalate for further care as appropriate. If it is 
in the best interest of the participant for them to spend the night at the study site, the 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_120535].
 
In the sub-study, if a participant is deemed medically and psychologically stable by [CONTACT_120665], the participant will be escorted home 
via car, rideshare, or public transportation and will not remain overnight at the study site. 
The support person will be provided with an instruction sheet including how to contact 
[CONTACT_120666], Site Physician, and/or therapy pair to report any issues. The 
support person will stay overnight with the participant and be instructed to call 911 in the 
case of a psychiatric or medical emergency. 
 
Each participant will be instructed to call the therapy pair when they arrive where they 
will stay for the night. If the therapy pair has not received a call within 2 hours after the 
participant has left the site, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_120536]. The therapy pair will ask about the participant’s emotional well-being 
and invite them to begin the process of integration through self-reflection, journaling, 
meditation, or other quiet activities. The therapy pair will remind the participants that this 
evening should be an opportunity to rest and integrate and that they should avoid 
unnecessary stresses, chores, etc. The therapy pair will also discuss this with the 
participant during the Preparatory and Experimental Sessions. The therapy pair and site 
physician will remain on-call overnight to attend to any medical or psychological issues 
that may come up for the participant.
 
On the morning after the Experimental Session, the participant will be escorted to the 
study site via car, rideshare, or public transportation, as participants are not allowed to 
drive within 24 hours of administration of MDMA. 
 
In the sub-study, if a participant is deemed to be not psychologically stable at the end of 
the Experimental Session, they will remain under the care of their therapy pair. The 
therapy pair will continue to evaluate the participant to make further disposition 
recommendations depending on the participant’s psychological condition. This could 
include: continued observation, psychological support and/or psychopharmacologic 
interventions; or further evaluation for potential transfer as appropriate per site Standard 
Operating Procedures (SOPs). If the therapy pair determines that the participant needs 
ongoing observation and psychological care at the same location as the Experimental 
Session, there will be the option for them to remain overnight with the therapy pair in 
accordance with site SOPs. If the participant will not be leaving the site for the night, the 
therapy pair will call the support person(s) to inform them and arrange appropriate 
transportation following the Integrative Session on the following day if appropriate.

Page 103 of 110 Sub-Study Objective & Evaluation
 
The primary objective of this sub-study will be to evaluate the feasibility of conducting 
MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD among participants who do not remain at the study 
site overnight after Experimental Sessions. 
 
This sub-study will include all participants enrolled and treated at select study sites. No 
formal analysis is planned to support this objective due to small sample size. However, 
case reports and AEs collected on the night of the Experimental Session will be evaluated 
to support feasibility. These reports will be used to explore feasibility of expanding the 
sub-study to include additional Phase [ADDRESS_135114]-approval.

 1. Introduction:  
For long, cirrhosis has been considered as end -stage liver disease but it is increasingly 
being realized that the 1- year mortality in cirrhosis varies widely, from 1% to 57%, depending on 
the occurrence of clinical decompensating events.[ADDRESS_780503] proposed that the 
histological term cirrhosis should be substituted by [CONTACT_591863], to underline the 
dynamic processes and variable prognosis of the disorder.2 A new term, compensated advanced 
chronic liver disease (cACLD) defining patients in the earl y phases of severe chronic liver 
disease, including both patients with severe fibrosis or pre- cirrhotic patients and patients with 
compensated cirrhosis is considered very helpful for both clinical practice and research 
purposes. Cirrhosis should no longer  be regarded as a terminal disease and the concept of a 
dynamic process is increasingly accepted. A prognostic clinical subclassiﬁcation with four distinct 
stages has been proposed with substantially diff ering likelihoods of mortality (Figure 1).  
Currently , the management of patients with cACLD includes assessment for severity of 
portal hypertension and risk stratification. Cirrhosis is  currently  classiﬁed in to two main prognostic 
stages: compensated and decompensated cirrhosis.1, 3  This classiﬁcation depends on the 
presence or absence of clinically evident decompensating events (speciﬁcally ascites, variceal 
hemorrhage, and encephalopathy), with a median survival in the compensated stage that exceeds 
12 years, while it is only 1.8 years in patients who develop decompensation (Figure).3   
  Figure. S tages of compensated advanced chronic liver disease and liver -related clinical events  
 
 
The Child- Turcotte- Pugh (CTP) classiﬁcation has been used to stratify patients with 
cirrhosis.
4 Patients with cirrhosis belonging to the CTP -A class are compensated, whereas those 
in the CTP -B/C class are mostly decompensated.4 Similarly, Model for End- Stage Liver Disease 
(MELD ) is a reliable meas ure of mortality risk in patients with end -stage liver disease and used to 
help prioritize organ allocation for transplant.5, 6 However, MELD scores of <10, typi[INVESTIGATOR_591859]-A, are unlikely to have prognostic value as the likelihood of clinical events in a [ADDRESS_780504] no liver -related  
symptoms.  
Patients with compensated cirrhosis are substaged based on the severity of portal 
hypertension (Figure 1).[ADDRESS_780505] puncture of 
the portal vein is risky and not routinely performed. Therefore, portal pressure is assessed 
indirectly by [CONTACT_591864] (HVPG) by [CONTACT_591865].10-12 The normal  value of HVPG is between 3 
and 5 mmHg.11, 12 Currently, the severity of portal hy pertension is defined as mild when HVPG is 
≥6 but < 10 mm Hg,  ≥ 10 mm Hg as clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH), and ≥12 mm 
Hg as severe portal hypertension (SPH) .13   Evaluation of a compens ated cirrhotic by [CONTACT_591866], decompensation (ascites, variceal hemorrhage and/or hepatic encephalopathy) and hepatocellular cancer.
14-[ADDRESS_780506]-to-Platelets Ratio Index (APRI) and fibrosis -4 (FIB -4) for prediction of 
adverse clinical outcomes related to portal hypertension.18, 19   
Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by [CONTACT_591867] (VCTE) 
is currently used for non -invasive diagnosis liver fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease.  In 
patients with cirrhosis, LSM is likely indicative of cumulative stiffness from underlying liver fibrosis 
and portal hypertension. In addition, some studies have reported a good correlation between LSM and HVPG and its ability to detect CSPH.
20, [ADDRESS_780507], in the recent Baveno conference (Baveno 
VI), a screening endoscopy was not recommended in patients with LSM <20 kilopascals ( kPa) 
and platelet count >150,000/μl due to very low risk of having varices at high risk of bleeding.21, 22  
In one study that examined the prognostic accuracy of HVPG and serum fibrosis biomarkers, both measures worked equally well in predicting clinical outcomes.

FibroScan®  is a commonly used  diagnostic device based on VCTE.23, 24 While the use of 
FibroScan® in liver clinics is attractive as a point of care exam that can provide immediate indirect 
data about hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in the clinic, advancement in quantitative ultrasound technology may now allow even more detailed and directed non -invas ive assessment of these 
measures of liver disease.

August 5 , 2021                                                                                                             - 6 - 
 Velacur  offers the ability to simultaneously and 
non-invasively measure Attenuation Coefficient Estimate 
(ACE) as a quantitative measure of ultrasound 
attenuation25 and detection of hepatic steatosis in addition 
to LSM which measures deep volumetric liver elasticity 
using steady state shear waves, known as shear wave 
absolute viboelastography (SWAVE). This technology enables measurements of liver elasticity to a depth equal to the B -mode image, or in excess of 15 cm. The system 
consists of an ultrasound machine, a vibration device to excite shear waves in the patient and an ultrasound 
transducer. The vibration device induces shear waves in the liver at four different frequencies between 40Hz and 70Hz simultaneously. The ultrasound volume is acquired 
through the ribs at the same location as a typi[INVESTIGATOR_591860] (TE) measurement. 
Volumes are collected in a fan of approximately 15 degrees and taken at a depth up to  15cm, 
which much deeper than Fibroscan® measurement (6 cm), and allows for much larger sample measurement (100,000 mm
3) versus that measured by [CONTACT_232785]®  (3,140 mm3). 
 The natural history of chronic liver dis ease  with advanced fibrosis/ cirrhosis across the 
different clinical stages of cirrhosis (Figure) is currently not well understood. Therefore, non-invasive tools that can assess the severity of cirrhos is and risk stratify prior to decompensation is 
currently an unmet need. The assessment of LSM  using Velacur  may eventually allow for a 
noninvasive, immediate, objective and efficient method for estimation of disease severity in patients with cirrhosis . Moreover, assessment over time of LSM may also allow for assessment 
of disease progression or regression from treatment interventions. We anticipate that baseline 
measurements of LSM and longitudinal changes ( ΔLSM/Δt) will serve as a prognostic tool in 
patients with cACLD.   
 
Hypothesis: The severity of portal hypertension in compensated advanced chronic liver disease 
(cACLD)  can be assessed measuring LSM by [CONTACT_591868] . 
 
Specific Aim  1: To examine the relationship between LSM by [CONTACT_591869].  
August 5 , 2021                                                                                                             - 7 - 
 advanced chronic liver disease (cACLD) . We will measure LSM by [CONTACT_591870] 200 patients with cACLD ( deﬁned by [CONTACT_591871] ≥10 kilopascals (kPa) 
according to the Baveno VI recommendations) who have not had a liver transplant .   
 
Specific Aim 2 : Compare the performance of LSM by [CONTACT_591872], esophageal 
and gastric varices to that of FibroScan® and other non -invasive markers such as MELD, CPT, 
platelets count, splenomegaly, APRI and FIB4. 
 Proposed Study Design: This is a cross sectional study that evaluates the relationship between 
LSM by [CONTACT_591873].

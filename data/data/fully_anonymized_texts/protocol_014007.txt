PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT 2a 
STUDY OBJECTIVE(S) Main Objective 
• To evaluate the effect of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], compared to placebo, on
airway inflammation in patients with persistent asthma. 
Additional Objective 
• To assess safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_848047]. 
Exploratory Objectives  
• To explore the effects of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], compared to placebo, inpatients with persistent asthma on: 
- Pulmonary function and asthma control, 
- T-helper cell 2 (Th2)-associated biomarkers in peripheral blood  
• To explore the pharmacokinetic- pharmacodynamic relationship of
the inflammatory biomarkers. 
• To evaluate the relationship between the baseline characteristics of
patients (eg, demographics, clinical status, clinical lab values, 
biomarkers, and genetic profiles) and treatment responses. 
STUDY DESIGN • Phase 2a, multicenter, exploratory, randomized, double-blind,placebo-controlled, parallel group study of repeated doses of
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_181149] (SC) in patients with
persistent asthma.
• During the study, patients will undergo 2 bronchoscopy proceduresfor the collection of bronchial biopsy, brushing and lavage samples
before treatment and at the end of the treatment period.
• Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_848048]-on therapy to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)in combination with long-acting beta-agonists (LABA).
• The clinical trial consists of three parts:
- Screening  5 weeks (and potentially additional up to 7 days for
confirmation of eligibility or scheduling of bronchoscopy)   
- Randomized Treatment Period (12 weeks)
- Post-Treatment Period (12 weeks)  for patients not participating
in the open label extension study 
• Eligible patients, who complete the treatment period, including the
end-of-treatment assessments, will be offered the opportunity to 
participate in an open label extension (OLE) study with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458].

ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE See Section  1 for details 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 Sample size determination: Approximately [ADDRESS_1179003] an 80% power to detect a 
difference of [ADDRESS_1179004] at 1-sided alpha=0.05. 
A patient who received treatment and prematurely ends his/her treatment 
prior to Week [ADDRESS_1179005] a sufficient number of 
patients with adequate bronchial biopsies to assess the main endpoints. 
Analysis Population: 
Pharmacodynamics 
 
For the main PD endpoints in bronchial submucosa, the PD population will 
consist of all randomized patients who underwent baseline and 
Week12/end-of-treatment (EOT) bronc hoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_848055]-of-treatment. 
Pharmacokinetics  
The PK population will consist of all patients in the safety population with at 
least one post dose, non-missing and elig ible serum concentration data. 
Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment actually received. 
Safety  
All patients who were exposed to study treatment, regardless of the amount of 
treatment administered, will be included in the safety population.  
ADA 
The ADA population will consist of all patients in the safety population with at 
least one qualified ADA result in the ADA assay following the first dose of the 
study medication. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment 
actually received. 
Main Analysis: 
The main endpoints, change from baseline in the number of airway 
submucosal inflammatory cells per surf ace airway of basal lamina (cells/mm2) 
and mucin in the bronchial mucosa, will be analyzed by [CONTACT_144406] 
(ANCOVA) with fixed terms for treatment, stratification factors of region and ICS dose, and airway submucosal infla mmatory cells per surface airway of 
basal lamina (cells/mm

difference in treatment mean changes will be calculated from the model. No 
multiplicity adjustment will be made for the main analyses. 
Descriptive statistics will also be performed by [CONTACT_848126]. 
Analysis of additional endpoints Pharmacodynamics:
 
The additional PD endpoints will be analyzed similarly to the main analysis. 
Analysis of FeNO will be specified in the statistical analysis plan. 
Pharmacokinetics  
Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_848056]. Anti-drug antibodies
 
Incidence of positivity in the ADA assay will be assessed as absolute 
occurrence (n) and percent of patients (%), presented by [CONTACT_204282]. 
Safety  
The safety analysis will be based on the review of descriptive statistics 
(summary tables) and individual data for adverse events (AEs) and clinical laboratory, vital signs and ECG parameters. Adverse events will be coded 
using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA), and the number 
of patients with Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) will be summarized. Potentially clinically significant abnormalities (PCSAs) for clinical 
laboratory, vital sign, and ECG data and out-of-normal range values for clinical laboratory data will be flagged and summarized in frequency tables. 
Analysis of exploratory endpoints 
Exploratory PD endpoints will be analyzed similarly to the main analysis. Associations between biomarker baseline characteristics and treatment 
outcome (as measured by [CONTACT_10266]
1 and other efficacy endpoints) will be 
explored.  Composite biomarker scores  (eg, Th2-related biomarkers) may be 
explored as appropriate. Correlations between changes in biomarkers and 
treatment responses (as measured by [CONTACT_10266] 1 and other efficacy endpoints) will 
be assessed. 
Descriptive statistics and, as appropriate, graphs will be provided for raw 
data, absolute changes and percent changes from baseline. 
DURATION OF STUDY PERIOD (per patient)  Total study duration for each patient, is approximately 29 weeks. 
• Screening: maximum of 5 weeks.  
• Treatment period: 12 weeks. 
• Follow-up period: 12 weeks.

4.2 RATIONALE 
4.2.1 Study Rationale 
The initial clinical study of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_848066] (ACT11457) and the dose-ranging 
study (DRI12544) in a broader population with pers istent asthma both showed treatment-related 
suppression of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and IL-4-/IL-13-dependent biomarkers in 
peripheral blood. The current study is designed to  more directly invest igate the effects of 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_848067].  
In ACT11457, 104 patients with m oderate-to-severe asthma in adequately controlled with 
medium-to-high dose combination inhaled cortic osteroids (ICS) / long-acting beta-agonists 
(LABA) (fluticasone/salmeterol, budesonide/formoterol, or mome tasone/formoterol) and with 
blood eosinophils >300 cells/µ L (101 patients) or sputum eosinophils >3% (3 patients) were 
studied. Patients were sw itched to fluticasone/salmeterol at Day 1 for 4 weeks, after which 
background therapy was reduced systematically. The primary endpoint was the incidence of 
asthma exacerbations after 12 weeks. An 87% (p<0.0001) relative reduction in asthma 
exacerbations was observed after 12-week treatme nt with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] (5.8%) vs placebo (44.2%).  
In the Phase 2b study (DRI12544), different doses and regimens of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] (up to 300 mg 
every 2 weeks [q2w] with a loading dose of 600 mg) have been evaluated in patients with 
moderate to severe, uncontrolled asthma. All patie nts received a stable dose of medium to high 
ICS/LABA in addition to their study treatment (placebo or dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458]). An interim analysis (dated 
02 November 2014) was performed after the last patients completed their Week 12 assessments. 
At the time of the interim repor t, 776 patients had been enrolled in the study and 731 patients had 
completed the 12-week study period. Results from the interim analysis indicated significant improvements, compared with placebo, in the chan ge from baseline forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_3741]

In addition, the effects of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_848069]2-associated biomarkers 
were evaluated in the ACT11457 and DRI12544 studi es. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), 
a quantitative method to measure airway infla mmation, decreased in dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458]-treated patients 
and remained suppressed through the end of treatment. Seru m levels of the Th2-associated 
chemokines, Thymus and Activation-Regulated Chemokine (TARC) and eotaxin-3, remained

• Placebo q2w with placebo loading dose.  
During the Randomized Treatment Period, patients continue the stab le (or equivalent) dose of an 
allowable combination product. The End-Of-Treatme nt (EOT) is designated as [ADDRESS_1179041] Treatment Period as indicat ed in the visit schedule (see Section  1.2 and Section  10.3.4).   
Eligible patients, who complete  the treatment period, including the EOT assessments, will be 
offered the opportunity to participate in an op en label extension (OLE) study with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458]. 
Patients subsequently enrolled in the OLE will not participate in the Post Treatment Period of this trial. 
Patients not participating in the OLE will enter a Post Treatment Period immediately after the

Bronchial biopsies afford a direct assessment of the effects of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_848073]. Inflammatory cell in filtration can occur in the mucosal, submucosal and smooth 
muscle layers, but most abundantly in the submucosa. During asthmatic inflammation, 
eosinophils, mast cells, and lymphocytes, including IL-4 expressing subpopulations within each of 
these cell types, are all increased in bronchial biopsies from atopic asthmatic patients compared with healthy control subjects. Assessmen t of the abundance of these cells using 
immunohistochemistry or other staining techniques will characterize the type of inflammation and 
quantify the effects of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_848074].

Infestations (preferred term [PT]: nasopharyngitis),  Nervous System Disorder (PT: headache), and 
General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (high level term [HLT]: injection site reactions). Based on the results of the recently completed dose-ranging study in patients with AD 
(study R668-AD-1021) and of the interim analysis  of the dose-ranging study in patients with 
asthma (study DRI12544), injection site reactions appear to be the pr imary dose-dependent TEAE 
related to dupi[INVESTIGATOR_848077], while nasopharyngitis and headach e appear to be balanced across 
treatment groups including placebo. A fe w TEAEs were observed more often in

dose or underlying disease; these TEAEs includ e nasopharyngitis, headache, oral herpes/herpes 
simplex, cough, oropharyngeal pain, and influenza. The majority of the TEAEs were 
mild-to-moderate in intensity.

The risks of bronchoscopy include discomfort and coughing (which will be reduced through local anesthetics), wheezing (which can be reduced by [CONTACT_848130]-agonist), reduced oxygen (which will be monitored and treated as needed during the procedure), minor bl eeding, infection and fever. Pneumothorax is a 
rare complication of bronchoscopy. Bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_848080].  Prior to the procedure, the investigator will confirm patient suitability by [CONTACT_848131]’s current lung function (eg, FEV

and asthma control.  In addition, prior to the procedure, the investigator will perform assessments, such as coagulation tests and platelets, to confirm suitability as well as any other assessments, such as a chest X-ray, at the investigator’s discretion.  Patients will be monitored after the 
procedure for at least one hour to allow detec tion and treatment of any complications. Another 
major risk of doing bronchoscopy in patients with asthma is inducing an asthma exacerbation. Because of this patients will receive prednisone/prednisolone  for [ADDRESS_1179046] cells, total T-lymphocytes and T-helper lymphocytes will be counted in the

will also be assessed histologically.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 45 9.2.2 Safety endpoints  
The same safety assessments will be applied across all arms.  Adverse events, including serious 
adverse events (SAEs) and adverse events of special interest (AESI), will be collected at every visit. The Investigator will ask the patient how he/s he has felt since the last study visit. The study 
specific and general safety criteria are detailed in Section  10.4. To assure the continuing safety of 
patients in this study, an inde pendent DMC will be responsible fo r reviewing the safety data on a 
periodic basis throughout the course of the study as outlined in  Section  6.4.1.  
Safety observations 
• The Investigator should take all appropriate measures to ensure  the safety of the patients. 
Notably, he/she should follow up the outcome of SAEs /AESI until c linical recovery is 
complete and laboratory results have returned to normal or until progression has been stabilized or death. In all cases, this may imp ly that observations will continue beyond the 
last planned visit per protocol, and that additional investiga tions may be requested by [CONTACT_429]. 
• When treatment is prematurely discontinued, the patient’s observations will continue until the end of the study as defined by  [CONTACT_56485]. 
• In case of any SAE/AESI with immediate notification brought to the attention of the Investigator at any time after the end of the study for the patient and considered by [CONTACT_12552]/her to be caused by [CONTACT_848142] a reasonable possibility, this should be 
reported to the Sponsor. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse events 
Adverse events for each patient will be monitored and documented from the time the patient gives informed consent at Visit [ADDRESS_1179081] (AESI) and serious adverse events (SAEs) 
will be reported as described in Section  10.4. 
Refer to Section  10.4 to Section  10.7 for details. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Laboratory safety variables 
The clinical laboratory data consist of blood anal ysis (including hematolo gy, clinical chemistry 
and serology) and urinalysis. Clinical laboratory values will be analyzed after conversion into 
standard international units. International units will be used in all listings and tables. 
The clinical laboratory tests will be conducted by [CONTACT_181271] (Co llege of American Pathologists

laboratory values should be repeated until they return to normal or until an etiology of the 
persistent abnormalit y is determined. 
Refer to Section  1.2 Study Flow Chart for the description of  the clinical laboratory evaluations 
and the schedule of laboratory evaluati ons performed throughout this study. 
The clinical laboratory testing  parameters that will be measured are: 
• Hematology:  hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet co unt, total white blood cell count with 
five-part differential count (neutrophils , eosinophils, basophils, monocytes and 
lymphocytes), and total red blood cell count. 
• Coagulation:  Prothrombin time, par tial thromboplastin time (PTT) at Visit 1 only 
• Serum chemistry:  creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, glucos e, uric acid, total cholesterol, 
total protein, albumin, total bilirubin (in case of values above the normal range, 
differentiation in conjugated and non-conjugated bilirubin), alanine aminotransferase, 
aspartate aminotransferase , alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 
electrolytes (sodium, potassium , chloride), bicarbonate, and creatine phosphokinase. The 
blood sample must be ta ken with the patient in fasting state which means no intake of any 
food or drink except for water for at least 8 hours. (If the visit can only be done during the 
day and the patient is not unde r fasting conditions, the patient  should eat light food and the 
site should document that serum chemistr y is not taken under fasting conditions). 
• Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA)  at Visit 1 for all patients a nd at Visit 8 only for patients 
planned to participate in the OLE. Note: An ti-ds DNA antibody will be tested if ANA is 
positive ( ≥1:160 titer). 
Other laboratory safety testing that will be measured includes: 
• Urinalysis:  Urine dipstick analysis including specifi c gravity, pH, glucose, ketones, blood, 
protein, nitrate, leukocyte esterase, urobilinogen and bilirubin. A quantitative 
measurement for glucose, protein, erythrocytes, and leucocytes will be performed in the event that the urine dipstick is positive for any of the above parameters. If the urine 
dipstick is positive for proteins, a microscopic analysis will be performed.  
• Virus serology testing:  (at Visit 1 for all patients and at  Visit 8 only for patients planned 
to participate in the OLE)  hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb), hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb [total and IgM]) and hepatitis C virus antibodies (HCV Ab), HIV screen (An ti-HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies). Patients who 
are Total-HBcAb positive and HBsAg negative at Visit [ADDRESS_1179082] be perform ed prior to randomization to determine 
eligibility. At Visit 8, the follow-up testing noted above (HBV DNA or HCV RNA) must

[IP_ADDRESS].3 ACQ-5  (Asthma Control Questionnaire, 5-question version) 
The ACQ-5 was designed to measure both the adequacy of asthma control and change in asthma control which occurs either spontaneously or as a result of treatment.  
The ACQ-5 has 5 questions, reflecting the top-scor ing five asthma symptoms: woken at night by 
[CONTACT_23805], wake in the mornings with symptoms, limitation of daily activities, shortness of breath 
and wheeze. Patients are asked to recall how their asthma has been during the previous week and 
to respond to the symptom questions on a 7- point scale (0=no impairment, 6= maximum 
impairment) (see Appendix G ). 
A global score is calculated: the questions are eq ually weighted and the ACQ-5 score is the mean 
of the 5 questions and, therefore, between 0 (tot ally controlled) and 6 (severely uncontrolled).  
Higher score indicates lower asthma control. Pa tients with a score below 1.[ADDRESS_1179091] change that 
can be considered clinically important, corresponding to the Minimal Clinically Important 
Difference (MCID) defined by [CONTACT_125471]. 
Measurement properties such as reliability and ability to detect change have been documented in 
the literature ( 18).

[IP_ADDRESS].1 Electronic diary/ PEF meter  
On a daily basis throughout the study, the pa tient uses an electronic diary / PEF meter to: 
• Measure morning and evening PEF, 
• Indicate the number of inhalations/day of salbutamol/albuterol or, 
levosalbutamol/levalbuterol for symptom relief, 
• Record the number of inhalations/day of background product used, 
• Record oral steroids use after bronchoscopy and for exacerbation event. 
At screening (Visit 1), patients will be issued an electronic diary/PEF. Patients will be instructed on the use of the device, and written instructions on the use of the electronic PEF meter will be provided to the patients. In additi on, the investigator will instruct the patients on how to record the 
following variables in the electronic PEF meter: 
• AM PEF performed within 15 minutes after arising (between 5:30 AM and 12:00 P M) prior 
to taking any albuterol/salbutamol or levalbuterol/levosalbutamol, 
• PM PEF performed in the evening (between 5:30 PM and 12:00  AM) prior to taking any 
albuterol/salbutamol or levalbuterol/levosalbutamol, 
• Patients should try to withhold albuterol/salbut amol or levalbuterol/levosalbutamol for at 
least 6 hours prior to measuring their PEF, 
• Three PEF efforts will be performed by [CONTACT_102]; all [ADDRESS_1179092] 7 days prior to Visit 2.  
Information derived from the electronic PEF meter will be evaluated by [CONTACT_181268].  
9.3.2 Exploratory Pharmacodynamic Analyses 
To evaluate the mechanism of action of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], biomarkers related to asthmatic inflammation 
and Th2 polarization will be assessed in bronchoscopy samples, including BALF, bronchial brushings and bronchial biopsies. RNA will be isolated from these samples to characterize 
treatment related changes in gene expression. In addition, selected biomarke rs will be assessed in 
peripheral blood to allow correlation with the airw ay and/or therapeutic responses, to document 
the time course of drug response, and to compare with observations in other dupi[INVESTIGATOR_848106].   
All samples will be archived to allow further analyses related to the mechanism of action of 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458]. More detailed information on the collec tion, handling, transport and preservation of 
samples (eg, minimum volumes required for blood collection and for aliquot s for each biomarker 
assay) will be provided in a separate laboratory manual.

[IP_ADDRESS] Optional stored DNA sample 
For those patients who signed the optional pharmacogenetic informed consent form, blood 
samples for exploratory genetic analysis of DNA will be collected at the study visit as specified in 
the study flow chart and this sample will be stored for future analysis. Specific procedures for 
collection, storage and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_848108] d in a lab manual.  
The DNA sample may be used to determine a possi ble relationship between genes and response to 
treatment with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], possible adverse reactions to dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], and to study the genetics of 
asthma. The DNA may be subjected to a genome-wi de association study by [CONTACT_848146]/or to whole exome sequencing or whole genome analysis in 
order to thoroughly explore genetic associations with disease risk and/or progression or treatment 
response (efficacy or adverse reactions).  
The blood sample will be transferred to a site that will, on behalf of [COMPANY_011], extract DNA from the 
sample. The contractor site can be located outsi de of your country, within or outside of the 
European Union.  
The DNA that is extracted for genetic testing w ill be assigned a second number, a Genetic ID 
(de-identification code) that is different from the Patient ID. This  “double coding” is performed to 
separate a patient’s medical  information and DNA data. 
The clinical study data (coded by [CONTACT_181276]) will be stored in the clinical data management 
system (CDMS), which is a distinct database in a separate environm ent from the database 
containing the pharmacogenetic data (coded by  [CONTACT_181277]). The key linking Patient ID and 
Genetic ID will be maintained by a third party, under appropriate access control.  The matching of clinical data and pharma cogenetic data, for the purpose of da ta analysis, will be possible only by 
[CONTACT_181278], which will be under strict access control. All data will be  reported only in coded 
form in order to maintain confidentiality. 
The aliquots of DNA sent to the bioanalytical la boratories for specific genetic testing will be 
destroyed after completion of that specific analysis and issuance of the related analytical data. 
For future genetic analysis, the DNA will be stored for up to 15 years from the completion of the 
clinical study report in the US. 
9.4 FUTURE USE OF SAMPLES 
Not all of the samples collected during this study may be required for the tests planned in this clinical trial. For patients who ha ve consented to it, the samples th at are archived, unused or left 
over after planned testing may be used for additi onal research purposes (any genetic analysis 
subject to additional consent per  Section  9.3.3). For patients who have c onsented to it, archival 
blood samples will be collected at the visit specifi ed in the study flow chart and processed and 
stored as described in the laboratory manual. For patients who have c onsented to it, samples 
collected during the bronchoscopy procedure (BAL , brushings, biopsy) will also be archived.

order to obtain 80% power to detect a signifi cant difference for lymphocytes (CD3+, CD4+ or 
CD8+) or eosinophils (EG2+), 15 subjects was an optimal minimal sample size ( 19).  In a clinical 
trial with omalizumab in allergic asthma, a treatment effect on the numbers of inflammatory cells, including eosinophils, total T-lymphocytes and T-helper cells, in the submucosa of bronchial biopsies was observed with a sa mple size of 14 per group ( 13).  Ward et al. studied the 
intrasubject variability of cellular parameters, incl uding eosinophils, in BAL in clinically stable,

10.1 VISIT SCHEDULE 
The clinical trial consists of three parts, using an add-on therapy approach to inhaled 
corticosteroid in combination with LABA: 
• Screening (5 weeks and optional addition of  7 days and not to exceed 6 weeks of 
screening; Visits 1 & 2).  
• Randomized Treatment Period (12 weeks; Visits 3-9). 
• Post-treatment Period (1 2 weeks; Visits 10-13). 
The study visits occur on the planned dates (relativ e to the first injection), as scheduled. The visit 
schedule should be adhered to within the ± [ADDRESS_1179095] the spi[INVESTIGATOR_848113] m chemistry tests. However, if the visit can only be done at a 
different time of the day and the patient is not fasting, then he/she should be advised to have a 
light meal and the site should document that serum chemistry was not obtained under fasting 
conditions. For spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], it should be performed at a pproximately the same time of the day at 
each visit throughout the study. 
Patients should be reminded that sexually active female patients of reproductive potential are 
required to practice effective contraception dur ing the entire study duration, while taking 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_181217] [ADDRESS_1179096] IMP dose . 
Prior to all screening assessments, after discussion of participation in the study, the written 
consent form (including voluntary participation in pharmacogenetic testing/future use of samples) 
must be signed and dated. 
Although the screening assessments for this study are grouped under the headings of Visits 1and 2 
in this protocol, it is possible for them to be perfo rmed over more than 2 site visits if necessary, as 
long as the screening visit window prior to rando mization (Day 1) is re spected and all results 
related to inclusion/exclusion criteria are availabl e prior to the baseline bronchoscopy procedure. 
If needed, in order to (re)confirm eligibility by [CONTACT_848147], an additional up to 7 days may be added to the screening period on 
the condition that: overall screening peri od will not exceed 6 weeks and Visit 2 (and 
bronchoscopy) will occur at least 3 days prior to visit 3 (day 1). Patients who failed the initial screening for certain inclusion/exclusion criteria (time-dependent and those that may be transient), may be rescreened for study eligibility one additional time if deemed appropriate at the discretion of the investigator and as long as the screen ing failure occurred prior to baseline bronchoscopy. 
Patients who are re-screened, must sign a new cons ent form and must repeat all of the Visit 1 
procedures (refer to Section  8.4 for further instructions related to rescreening) unless a prior 
assessment is performed within the time frame permitted prior to study entry. For patients who participate in screening visits but are subsequently not randomized into the clinical trial, further assay of stored specimens will be discontinued unless re-designated for the alternative purposes of biomarker assay development or establishment of  biomarker and RNA valu es for patients with 
asthma.

10.3 HANDLING OF PATIENT TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT TREATMENT 
DISCONTINUATION AND OF PATIENT STUDY DISCONTINUATION  
The IMP should be continued whenever possibl e. In case the IMP is stopped, it should be 
determined whether the stop can be made tempor arily; permanent IMP discontinuation should be 
a last resort. Any IMP discontinuation should be fully documented in the CRF. In any case, the patient should remain in the study as long as possible. 
10.3.[ADDRESS_1179134](s) 
Temporary treatment discontinuation may be consider ed by [CONTACT_179639]. Reinitiation of treatment with the IMP will be done under clos e and appropriate  clinical/and 
or laboratory monitoring once the Investigator will have considered according to his/her best medical judgment that the  AE is sufficiently resolved and unlikely to recur after resuming therapy with IMP.   
In addition, the following conditions(s) will be cau ses for temporary treatme nt discontinuation:  
• Infections or infestations that do not respond to medical treatment. 
• Any laboratory abnormality that meets temporary treatment disconti nuation criteria as per 
Appendix D .

Permanent treatment discontinuation is any tr eatment discontinuation associated with the 
definitive decision from the Investigator or the patient not to re-expose the patient to the IMP at 
any time. 
10.3.[ADDRESS_1179136] be withdrawn from treatment with the IMP if they decide to do so, at any time and irrespective of the reason, or this may be th e Investigator’s decision. All efforts should be 
made to document the reasons for treatment disc ontinuation and this should be documented in the 
e-CRF.  
Patients must be withdrawn from the treatment (ie, from any furt her investigational product or 
study procedure) for the following reasons:  
• At their own request or at the request of th eir legally authorized representative (Legally 
authorized representative means an individual or judicial or other body authorized under 
applicable law to consent on beha lf of a prospective patient to the patient’s participation in 
the procedure(s) involved in the research). 
• If, in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continuati on in the study would be detrimental to the 
patient’s well-being. 
• At the specific request of the Sponsor. 
• In the event of a protocol deviation, at the discretion of the Investigator or the Sponsor. 
• Any code breaking requested by [CONTACT_328745]. 
• Pregnancy. 
• Anaphylactic reactions or systemic allergic reactions that are related to IMP and require treatment. 
• Diagnosis of a malignancy during the study, ex cluding carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or 
squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin. 
• Any opportunistic infection, such as TB or ot her infections whose nature or course may 
suggest an immunocompromised status (See Appendix F ).  
• Serum ALT >[ADDRESS_1179137] and Total Bilirubin >2ULN (See Appendix D ).

Any abnormal laboratory value or ECG parameter will be immediately rechecked for confirmation before making a decision of perman ent discontinuation of the IMP for the concerned 
patient.

10.4.1 Definitions of adverse events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse event 
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
patient administered a pharmaceutical product an d which does not necessar ily have to have a 
causal relationship with this treatment. 
Since asthma exacerbations are representative of th e underlying disease (persistent asthma) of the 
study population, these events should not be repor ted as AEs unless fulfilling the criteria for a 
serious adverse event as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS].  For this study, asthma exacerbations will 
be managed by [CONTACT_848149] r medical judgment and applicable national / 
international asthma management guidelines. Any surgical procedures are not considered as adverse events, including the bronchoscopy 
procedure, but an adverse event caused by [CONTACT_848150]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious adverse event 
A serious adverse event  (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death, or 
• Is life-threatening, or 
 Note: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
 the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
 hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.

10.5 OBLIGATIONS OF THE SPONSOR 
During the course of the study, the Sponsor will report in an expedited manner: 
• All SAEs that are both unexpected and at leas t reasonably related to the IMP (S[LOCATION_003]R), to 
the regulatory authorities, IECs/IRBs as appropriate and to the Investigators.    
• All SAEs that are expected and at least reasonably related to the IMPs to the regulatory authorities, according to local regulations. 
In this study, some AEs are considered relate d to the underlying condition and thus will not be 
considered unexpected [eg, wheezing related to asthma]. 
Any other AE not listed as an expected event in the Investigator’s Brochure or in this protocol 
will be considered unexpected. For safety, the treatment code will be unblinded by [CONTACT_848152] (S[LOCATION_003]R) and reasonably associated 
with the use of the IMP according to either the judgment of the Investigator and/or the Sponsor. 
In case of a S[LOCATION_003]R, [COMPANY_011] Global Pharmacovigilance and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_848119]. 
The Sponsor will report all safety observations made during the conduct  of the trial in the clinical

incidence of local injection site  reactions observed at the highest dose level (300 mg weekly), 
severe injection site reactions, are considered as a potential risk. Patients who experience an 
injection site reaction must be closely monitored for the possibility of a more intense injection site reaction with a future injection. Any severe in jection reaction that lasts over 24 hours will be 
reported as an AESI with immediate notification.

In order to minimize this risk, any patient with an active parasitic infection should be excluded 
from the study. Similarly, patients with suspected parasitic infection, or those at high risk of 
parasitic infection are also excluded, unless clinical and (if necessary) laboratory assessments 
have ruled out active infection before randomization. During the study, appearance of signs or symptoms (such as abdominal pain, cough, diarrh ea, fever, fatigue hepatosplenomegaly) that 
could be associated with a parasitic infection should be carefully evaluated, especially if there is a history of parasitic exposure through recent travel to/ or residence in endemic areas, especially 
when conditions are conducive to infection (eg, ex tended stay, rural or slum areas, lack of running 
water, consumption of uncooked, undercooked, or otherwise potentially contaminated food, close contact [CONTACT_181292],  etc.). Subsequent medical a ssessments (eg, stool exam, blood 
tests, etc.) must be performed in order to rule out parasitic infe ction/infestation.   Patients with 
confirmed parasitic inf ections during the study should be reported as AESI with immediate 
notification and will be permanently discontinued from the study.

11.1 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
 
The sample size determination and the statistical power are estimated based on the pharmacodynamic endpoint of fracti onal exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO)  as no historical data is 
available on the main endpoints of bronchial s ubmucosal inflammatory cells. The following 
assumptions are used for the estimations: 
• A difference of [ADDRESS_1179165]  deviation of 32 ppb (This corresponds 
to a hypothesized effect size of 0.78). 
• A t-test at 1-sided α=0.05. 
• Not accounting for early dropout, ie, the calculate d sample size refers to the size of 
completers. Definition of completers will be detailed in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) prior to database lock. 
Based on the above assumptions, it is estimate d that, with a total of [ADDRESS_1179166] a 80% power to detect a difference of 
25 ppb in the change from baseline in FeNO at  Week 12 between SAR231893 and placebo. Based 
on observations in other clinical trials (see Section  9.5), it is expected that this sample size will be 
sufficient to evaluate the main PD endpoints in bronchial submucosa.

(See Section  9.2.2) 
The summary of safety results w ill be presented by [CONTACT_63300]. All safety analyses will be 
performed on the safety population using the following common rules: 
The baseline value is defined generally as the last available value before the first dose of IMP.   Treatment emergent period for safety population is defined as the time from the first 
administration of study medication to the end of the Post-treatment Period. 
The following definitions will be applied to laboratory parameters, vital signs and ECG. 
• The potentially clinically significant abnorma lity (PCSA) values are defined as abnormal 
values considered medically important by [CONTACT_56493]/thresholds based on lite rature review and defined by  [CONTACT_326932], vital signs and ECG.  
• PCSA criteria will determine which patients had at least 1 PCSA during the on-treatment period, taking into account all evaluations  performed during the on-treatment period, 
including unscheduled or repeated evaluations.  The number of all such patients will be the numerator for the on-treatment PCSA percentage.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse events 
Adverse event incidence tables will present by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) (sorted by [CONTACT_56496]), high-level group te rm (HLGT), high level term (HLT) and preferred 
term (PT) sorted in alphabetical order for each treatment group, the number (n) and percentage (%) of patients experiencing an AE.  Multiple occu rrences of the same event in the same patient 
will be counted only once in the tables w ithin a treatment phase. The denominator for 
computation of percentages is the safe ty population within each treatment group. 
Proportion of patients with at l east one treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE), serious TEAE 
and TEAE leading to discontinuation of the st udy will be tabulated by [CONTACT_1570]. In 
addition TEAEs will be de scribed according to maximum intensity and relation to the study drug. 
None treatment emergent seri ous AE, None treatment emergent AE leading to study 
discontinuation will be summarized separately. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 AESI 
The following summaries will be generated:  
• Incidence of each AESI will be tabulated by [CONTACT_1570].  
• The time-to-first event analyzed using K-M methods and displayed as K-M plots (cumulative incidence (%) versus time based on K-M estimates) will be provided to depi[INVESTIGATOR_848124]. When TEAE start date or worsening date is partially 
available, the maximum of the earliest possible TEAE start date and the treatment start date will be used. When TEAE start date or worsening date is completely missing, the treatment start date will be used.

Any amendment to the clinical trial protocol requires written approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_56400]/IEC prior to its implementation, unle ss there are overriding safety reasons. 
In case of substantial amendment to the clinical trial protocol, approval from the Health Authorities (Competent Re gulatory Authority) will be sought before implementation, as required 
by [CONTACT_1295]. 
In some instances, an amendment may require a change to the informed consent form. The 
Investigator must receive an IRB/IEC approval/fa vorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_56401]-collected if necessary.

1.Summary
a)Provide a brief summary of the scope of work of this project, using non-technical terms that would be understood by a non-scientific
reader. This summary should be no more than [ADDRESS_135327] pain management protocol is using 20 cc of 1% plain lidocaine in a two site injection. Few studies have compared buffered
versus nonbuffered lidocaine for paracervical blocks during first trimester surgical abortions. This study seeks to determine if buffered
lidocaine decreases injection pain versus plain lidocaine for paracervical blocks.
2.Purpose
a)Describe the purpose for the proposed project as well as the hypotheses/research questions to be examined.
The purpose of this study is to see if using buffered lidocaine for the standard paracervical block will decrease the injection pain
normally associated with the plain lidocaine solution we use as our standard protocol. Plain lidocaine is commonly used for
paracervical blocks. However, some studies have suggested that buffered lidocaine may decrease the pain associated with the
injection of the medication, but few studies have looked specifically at using buffered lidocaine for paracervical blocks during first
trimester outpatient surgical abortions. Our hypothesis is that using buffered lidocaine for the paracervical block during first trimester
surgical abortions will decrease injection pain as compared to using plain lidocaine.
b)What do the investigators hope to learn from this project?
Primary objective: To assess if buffered lidocaine reduces pain from injection more effectively than plain lidocaine for paracervical
blocks during first trimester surgical abortions
Secondary objectives: To evaluate if buffered lidocaine is more effective than plain lidocaine at reducing pain during dilation and
postoperative pain from first trimester surgical abortions
3.Procedures
a)Describe in chronological order of event(s) how the activities will be conducted, providing information about all procedures (e.g.
interventions/interactions with subjects, data collection, photographing, audio and video recording), including follow up procedures.
Potential participants will be identified at their office visits to the University Women’s Health Specialists either at Kapi’olani or
Queen’s. If a patient desires surgical termination of a first trimester pregnancy or management of a failed pregnancy in the first
trimester, they will first receive standard counseling and provide informed consent for the procedure. Next, the patient’s eligibility for
our study will be assessed. If the patient is eligible, she will be asked by a member of the research team if she is interested in
participating. If she is, the study will be explained to her and written consent will be obtained after she is given the opportunity to have
all of her questions answered.  The patient will then complete a written questionnaire to collect demographic data.
This prospective randomized control trial will consist of two study arms.  As participants are enrolled they will be randomly assigned to
Arm 1, where a paracervical block will be administered with 20 cc of 1% lidocaine, which is our standard office protocol, or to Arm 2,
where a paracervical block will be administered with 20 cc of 1% lidocaine buffered with 8.4% sodium bicarbonate.Patients will be
randomly assigned to either Arm 1 or Arm 2 of the study. Prior to the start of the study, study assignments will be generated in a 1:[ADDRESS_135328] of the study will use a computer random number generator to generate random
permuted blocks.  The random permuted blocks will also be randomly varied in sizes of 4, 6, & 8. This statistician will place allocation
assignment cards in sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes. A different randomization scheme will be used for each
location, one at the Kapi’olani office and one at the Queen’s office.
A clinic staff member not involved with the conduct of the study will be trained specifically in the opening of the allocation envelopes.
The clinic staff member will be trained to pull envelopes individually in a sequentially numbered order.  The staff member will be
trained to open the envelope and remove the study card to read the allocation group: buffered lidocaine or plain lidocaine.  The staff
member will be trained to not tell anyone involved in the study of the allocation assignment.  The clinic staff member will then draw up
the buffered lidocaine or plain lidocaine in an unlabeled syringe, and give it to the procedural physician or surgical assistant for study
administration.

All patients who consent to the study will receive standard counseling prior to their procedure. The procedure will start with a
bimanual exam by [CONTACT_13917]. Next, the provider will place a speculum, cleanse the cervix with betadine solution, and place a
single-tooth tenaculum on the anterior lip of the cervix. At this point, participants assigned to Arm 1 will receive a paracervical block
loaded with 20 cc of 1% lidocaine with 10 cc injected at the 4 and 8 o’clock positions of the cervicovaginal junction. Participants
assigned to Arm 2 will receive a paracervical block loaded with 18 cc of 1% lidocaine and 2 cc of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate in the
same fashion. The research assistant will ask the patient to verbally report their level of pain based on the 100 mm visual analog
scale at the following points of the procedure:
1)Prior to the start of the procedure (baseline)
2)After speculum placement
3)After paracervical block
4)After cervical dilation
5)After suction curettage
6)Fifteen minutes postoperatively
i)Be sure to identify what procedures are experimental and what are standard of care or established practice for the
condition/situation.
Our current standard of care is to use 20 cc of 1% plain lidocaine for the paracerical block. We are experimenting using a
paracervical block loaded with 18 cc of 1% lidocaine and 2 cc of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate to see if this decreases injection
pain.
b)Explain who will conduct the procedures and where and when they will take place. Indicate the frequency and duration of
visits/sessions as well as the subject's total time commitment for the study. Include how the data will be collected (i.e. in person or
online).
Abortion care providers will perform the dilation and curettage at University Women’s Health Specialists either at the Kapi’olani or
Queen’s location. The research portion will take place on the same day as the dilation and curettage procedure and will add an
additional 20 minutes to the patient's standard office visit. No additional visits are required for this research study. Data will be
collected in person and recorded on paper then transferred to a secure electronic database.

* * * Background and additional procedures * * *
4.Background and additional procedures
a.Relevant Background: Discuss the present knowledge, appropriate literature and rationale for conducting the research. Include the
rationale for the selected subject population.
A small number of studies have addressed this research question with conflicting results.
A multiphase study was published in 1995 using various techniques of the paracervical block for surgical abortions. Using a 10 cm
visual analog scale (VAS), the study found a statistically significant decrease in injection pain when using buffered lidocaine as
compared to plain lidocaine and bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]. However, the pain immediately after the injection decreased from [ADDRESS_135329] found that a 30% or 13-20mm difference on a
100mm VAS is clinically meaningful for patients.
Another study compared buffered lidocaine versus plain lidocaine for paracervical blocks for surgical abortions. Using an 11 point
scale, the investigators found an 8% decrease in pain from injection when using buffered lidocaine versus plain lidocaine.  Although
this difference was statistically significant, the author concluded that this was most likely not clinically significant and thus not worth
the extra cost of preparing the buffered solution.
Buffered lidocaine versus plain has been looked at in non-gynecological procedures as well. One randomized controlled study
compared buffered lidocaine versus plain lidocaine for patients undergoing bilateral periocular surgery. Investigators found a 51%
decrease in injection pain when using buffered lidocaine versus plain lidocaine, which was both statistically and clinically significant.
Another study compared 1% lidocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_120805] 1% lidocaine buffered with 8.4% sodium bicarbonate for patients
undergoing loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) procedure. Using a 100 mm Likert scale, the study found an eight-point
decrease in procedural pain when using buffered lidocaine; however, this was not statistically significant.
Loma Linda University conducted a study comparing pain using 1% lidocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_120805] 1% lidocaine with epi[INVESTIGATOR_120806] 8.4% sodium bicarbonate for patients undergoing eyelid surgery. Using a [ADDRESS_135330] decreased pain from injection when using buffered lidocaine; however, this was not statistically significant.
Two studies found no difference when using buffered lidocaine versus plain lidocaine. A dental study comparing buffered lidocaine
versus plain lidocaine for maxillary injections found no difference in pain with 5% buffered, 10% buffered, and nonbuffered lidocaine.
Another study compared buffered versus plain lidocaine for patients undergoing incision and drainage for pulpal necrosis. No
significant difference in pain was found.
Thus, very few studies have specifically looked at buffered lidocaine versus plain lidocaine for paracervical blocks during first
trimester surgical abortions. The studies that have been conducted have conflicting results. Some have found benefit by [CONTACT_120817]. Other studies have found no difference in pain.
It is important to determine the ideal anesthesia for first trimester surgical abortions since it is one of the most common outpatient
procedures worldwide. Buffered lidocaine for paracervical injections may have benefit for patients. However, it is more expensive to
prepare and requires more planning due to a shorter shelf life. Thus, buffered lidocaine should only be used if there is a definite
benefit. It is therefore important to determine if buffered lidocaine decreases injection pain during paracervical blocks for first trimester
surgical abortions.
We have decided to select our study population from patients at University Women’s Health Specialists offices due to the high volume
of patients seeking surgical terminations of pregnancy or surgical management of miscarriages. We believe our selected patient
population will reflect the diversity of Hawai'i.
b.Describe the statistical methods of the research and plans for analysis of the data (i.e. planned statistics, justification of sample size,
etc.).
Based on previous research showing that a clinically relevant decrease in pain on a [ADDRESS_135331] 15 mm, we need to enroll
88 patients (44 in each group) to show this difference with 80% power and alpha of 0.05. Inflating this number by 10% to account for
potential dropout (which is unlikely due to the lack of longitudinal follow-up), we obtain a total sample size of 98 patients (49 in each
group).
Based on the typi[INVESTIGATOR_120807], we anticipate that enrollment will take approximately 6-8 months.
We will assess the primary objective by [CONTACT_120818] 10 of 22 10

We will assess the primary objective by [CONTACT_120819]. To assess our secondary
objectives, we will compare the mean pain score after cervical dilation between participants assigned to Arm 1 and Arm 2 as well as
compare postoperative pain between the two arms. All analyses will assume a statistical significance level of 0.05. In addition, we will
monitor the extra costs of preparing buffered lidocaine solutions and how the preparation of buffered lidocaine impacts clinic flow and
staffing.

d)If your participants include pregnant women, human fetuses, neonates, children, adults with diminished capacity, and/or prisoners,
describe the protocol-specific safeguards used to protect the rights and welfare of this study population:
This study will recruit two possibly vulnerable populations: pregnant women and minors. This could raise the possibility of additional
risk to the pregnant woman or the fetus due to the pregnancy. However, women coming to either clinic are already choosing to
terminate their pregnancies and thus there are no additional risks to either the women or the fetus due to enrolling in this study. Also,
this study will recruit patients who are below the age of 18. Patients below the age of 18 will require patient assent and parental
consent.
e)Provide a clear compelling rational for excluding women, minorities, or minors, if they are intentionally excluded from the
research.XN/A
f)State if any of the subjects are students, employees, or laboratory personnel. Please explain how subjects will be
protected from coercion and undue influenceXN/A
g)Please describe the expertise you have, or have access to, which prepares you to conduct research in this location and/or with this
subject population, including specific qualifications (e.g., relevant coursework, background, experience, and training). Also, explain
your knowledge of local community attitudes and cultural norms and cultural sensitivities necessary to carry out the research (e.g.,
differences with U.S. culture).
My co-investigators and I have extensive experience and training in providing abortion care. I completed a reproductive health
externship in medical school, attended the Abortion Training Institute, and have completed my family planning rotation in residency.
My co-investigators have completed fellowships in family planning and conducted numerous research projects in family planning,
some specifically related to pain control. Because this research project does not alter the actual procedure being done, local
community attitudes, cultural norms, and cultural sensitivities should not hinder our project. In general, Honolulu is a city that supports
a woman's right to choose; thus, this project should not meet too much resistance.

Potential participants will be identified at their office visits to the University Women’s Health Specialists either at Kapi’olani or
Queen’s. If a patient desires surgical termination of a first trimester pregnancy or management of a failed pregnancy in the first
trimester, they will first receive standard counseling and provide informed consent for the procedure. Next, the patient’s eligibility for
our study will be assessed. If the patient is eligible, she will be asked by a member of the research team if she is interested in
participating. If she is, the study will be explained to her and written consent will be obtained after she is given the opportunity to

exposed to the possibility of injury, including physical, psychological, or social injury, as a consequence of participation as a subject in
any research, development, or related activity which departs from the application of those accepted methods necessary to meet his
needs, or which increases the ordinary risks of daily life, including the recognized risks inherent in a chosen occupation or field of
service."

a)PI's evaluation of the overall level of Risk. (Please check one: minimal or  minimal.)
XMinimal (everyday living)
 Minimal (greater than everyday living)
b)Describe all known risks or discomforts associated with study procedures whether physical, psychological or social (e.g., pain, stress,
invasion of privacy, breach of confidentiality) noting probability and magnitude of potential harm.  Specify the risk(s) associated with
each research procedure or test.
This study poses minimal risk to the research participants. Paracervical blocks are commonly performed in gynecological procedures
both in the office and in the operating room and are generally well tolerated. Routine care in our practice is to administer paracervical
blocks with 20 cc of 1% plain lidocaine.  There is no evidence to suggest that adding the buffering agent would present any additional
risks to the patient. Therefore risks of participating in this study are commensurate with the risks associated with having a surgical
abortion. Potential risks associated with enrollment in our study include the potential loss of privacy of medical information. However,
we are taking steps to mitigate these risks as outlined below.
c)Describe the procedures or safeguards in place to protect against or minimize potential risks (e.g., referral to psychological counseling
resources).
Patient’s medical information will be protected to the best of our ability using password protection and limiting access to investigators
and research staff. In addition, data will be de-identified prior to statistical analysis. If, during the study, new information is available
that would affect the safety of participants, they will be informed and the study will be modified to reflect this information.
d)How will subjects be assessed for adverse events?
All investigators will protect and monitor the rights, safety, and welfare of all participants. All participants will be informed to report any
adverse events or severe adverse events. Investigators will review these reports and follow all adverse events until they resolve. Any
severe adverse events will be reported to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_874] 24 hours as well as to the IRB and to the FDA if appropriate.
If a participant is withdrawn from the study due to a severe adverse event, the participant will be referred for or provided appropriate
medical follow up.
e)Is there a plan to monitor study data for subject safety? Y
If yes, discuss who will monitor the study data and describe the monitoring plan:
Investigators will meet regularly to review study progress, adverse events, severe adverse events, and any necessary changes to
study protocol. If at any point the study is suspected to place participants at unnecessary risk, the study may be unblinded and
terminated.

* * * Benefits * * *
9.Benefits
a)Discuss any potential benefits that would justify involvement of subjects in this study. Compensation is not considered a benefit.
i.Direct benefits to subjects (if applicable)
There is a potential medical benefit to participants who receive the buffered lidocaine for their paracervical injection due to a
possible decrease in injection pain.
ii.Indirect benefits to society
Participants will also benefit from their ability to contribute to the improvement of medical care.
b)Explain how the potential benefits justify the potential risks involved in participation in this research.
It is important to determine how to decrease pain during one of the most common outpatient procedures worldwide. The potential
risks to the participants are minimal and commensurate with the risks associated with having the planned procedure. Thus the

* * * Procedures to Maintain Confidentiality * * *
10.Procedures to Maintain Confidentiality or Anonymity
Will your research involve any of the following types of data listed below? Y
Which of the following types of data will you work with:
XIdentifiableInformation is considered to be identifiable when it can be linked to specific individuals by [CONTACT_093](s) either directly or
indirectly through coding systems, or when characteristics of the information obtained are such that by [CONTACT_15623] a reasonably
knowledgeable person or investigator could ascertain the identities of individuals. Therefore, even though a dataset may have been
stripped of direct identifiers (names, addresses, student ID numbers, etc.), it may still be possible to identify an individual through a
combination of other characteristics (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity, and place of employment).
AnonymousData are anonymous if no one, not even the researcher, can connect the data to the person who provided it--no identifying
information is collected from the individual. Investigators must be aware, however, that even if no direct identifiers (name, address,
student ID, etc.) are collected, identification of a participant may be possible from unique individual characteristics (indirect identifiers).
For example, a participant who is a member of a certain ethnic group or who was studied because of distinctive personal
accomplishments or medical history might be identifiable from even a large data pool.
De-identifiedIf the dataset has been stripped of all identifying information and there is no way that it could be linked back to the subjects
from whom it was originally collected (through a key to a coding system or by [CONTACT_86416]). Note: This also applies if the source of
the data is identifiable but the data collected is not.
CodedThis refers to data that have been stripped of all direct subject identifiers, but in this case each record has its own study ID or code,
which is linked to identifiable information such as name [CONTACT_17929]. The linking file must be separate from the coded data
set. This linking file may be held by [CONTACT_120822] (e.g. the PI) or it could be held by [CONTACT_120823]
(e.g. researcher at another institution). A coded data set may include limited identifiers under HIPAA. Of note, the code itself may not
contain identifiers such as subject initials or medical record number.
a)If information derived from the study will be provided to the subject's personal physician, a government agency, or any other person or
group (other than the research team), describe to whom the information will be given and the nature of the information, if applicable.
•Government or university staff may have access to patient information for review.
•Providers and other healthcare staff of University of Hawaii may have access for direct patient care.
•Federal, state and local agencies having oversight over this research, such as The Office for Human Research Protections in the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, and the National Institutes of Health may have
access to patient information for research purposes.
b)Explain how you will protect subjects' privacy. Note: Privacy refers to persons and their interest in controlling the access of others to
themselves. For example, based on their privacy interest's people want to control:
-The time and place where they give information.
-The nature of the information they give.
-The nature of the experiences that are given to them.
-Who receives and can use the information.
For example, persons might not want to be seen entering a place that might stigmatize them, such as a pregnancy-counseling center
that is clearly identified as such by [CONTACT_120824]. Please keep this definition in mind as you respond to this item.
Both of our clinic locations share space with other Ob/Gyn practitioners. Thus, patients are not clearly identified as seeking abortion
care when they walk through our doors. Once a patient is seen, she will receive counseling for the procedure and information about
the research project, if she is interested, in a private, confidential setting.

12.Assent Background
(Complete if applicable)
Assent Document: A form or script of the information that will be conveyed to the child about the study. In general, researcher must obtain the
affirmative agreement of children ages seven years and older for their participation. Assent forms should be written at a level understandable
to the child. If the study includes a broad age range of  hildren, more than one assent form may be needed (i.e., an assent from suitable for a
17 year old is not usually suitable for a 7 year old child).
Assent Waiver: No child assent will be sought at all. This means that the IRB is asked to waive the requirement for child assent. Among other
circumstances, this option is appropriate when the capability of the child to understand the research is too limited or when the research holds
out a prospect of direct benefits that is important to the health or well-being of the child.
All minors must provide an affirmative consent to participate by [CONTACT_2960] a simplified assent form, unless the Investigator(s) provides evidence
to the IRB that the minor subjects are not capable of assenting because of age, maturity, psychological state, or other factors.

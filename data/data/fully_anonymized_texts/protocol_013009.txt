Study Description:  This is a single site, randomized , sham -controlled , double -blind 
study assessing the feasibility, safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 
non-invasive VNS (nVNS) in the treatment of headache in 
subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). We hypothe size that two-two 
minute  noninvasive stimulation s of the cervical branch of the Vagus 
nerve, every 5 hours , is efficacious in safely reducing headache 
intensity and frequency  in patients with headache due to SAH, 
during the patient’s intensive care unit (ICU)  stay. After screening 
and obtaining informed consent, eligible patients diagnosed with 
SAH on head scans, admitted to the Neurosu rgical Intensive Care 
Unit (N SCU) at Northshore University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_735527] ( stimulation of the cervical branch of the Vagus

2  INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1 STUDY R ATIONALE   
 
Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a devastating condition, most commonly due to trauma and 
aneurysm rupture, and carries significant mortality and morbidity. About half of the survivors 
are left with disability. Some of the known complications are aneurysm re-rupture, seizures, 
central fever, delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) and hydrocephalus (ref). SAH induces a systemic 
inflammatory immune response (SIRS) and over activated  sympathetic nervous system. As a 
result, patients are monitored carefully in the int ensive care unit, with frequent neurologic 
examination. The most common presenting sign is headache, which worsens in the first 
week. (1) The hallmark of this headache in SAH is that it is often described as “the worst 
headache of my life”. Evaluatin g a cohort of patients with aneurysmal SAH, Magalhães et al., 
showed that headache lasts on average 12.5 days, and that anxiety was a risk factor for 
persistent headache. (2) In addition, headache is one of the most common cause of readmission 
in SAH, leading to an inc rease in healthcare cost. (3) Non-enhanced cat scan (CT) of the head 
VANQUISH  Version [ADDRESS_1004977] pain killers fail to control headache intensity and  carry 
risks. Physicians resort to opi[INVESTIGATOR_735534] (CNS) depression, 
alter the neurologic examination and lead to unnecessary te sts, increasing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_735535]. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_735536] (ICU) setting. In addition, the over usage of opi[INVESTIGATOR_735537] t o what we are currently experiencing in the [LOCATION_002], an 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_735538]. A recent study showed that on day [ADDRESS_1004978] SAH ictus, patients use a daily 
mean morphine equivalent dose of 18 mg intravenously. In addition, some patients were 
prescribed a max imum total daily dose of 16 mg of Decadron. (4) There is lack of strong 
evidence advocating the use of Decadron in the management of headache due to SAH. 
Howeve r, it is frequently used given the assumption that it decreases the inflammation caused 
by [CONTACT_735568], thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of headache, as a result, 
decrease headache intensity. However, steroids can cause immunosuppression, hyperglycemia, 
decrease wound healing, peptic ulcers, and has been shown to increase mortality in traumatic 
brain injury. Acetaminophen is frequently used, but not effective in controlling pain, and care 
should be taken to avoid toxic levels .(1) In a prospective study, Morad et al., showed that 
continuous usage of opi[INVESTIGATOR_735539], even though the daily mean intravenous morphine equivalence of 15.[ADDRESS_1004979] the need for a 
more effective and safe therapeutic intervention. (5) Headache is the major complaint in 
patients with SAH and is very disabling, leading to days of pain and suffering . Unfortunately 
until today, there are no effective treatments. Vagus nerve stimulation has been shown to have 
nociceptive effect and could potentially help safely manage headache in this patient 
population. In addition, vagus nerve stimulation activates the parasympathetic nervous system 
(SAH is a hyperact ive sympathetic response) and has anti -inflammatory properties that could 
potentially prevent secondary brain injury (DCI and stroke) seen in aneurysmal SAH (a -SAH). 
The FDA recently approved the noninvasive form, which has been proven to be safe and 
effic acious in controlling different types of headaches, which share similar pathophysiology to 
SAH related headache, making it an attractive therapeutic option for this patient population.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_1004980] of the NMDA receptor  is being 
investigated as a treatment for SAH related headache .(6) Cortical spreading depression 
commonly seen in SAH patients could also be involved in headache pathogenesis. It is 
frequently seen in migraine with aura. Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) has been FDA approved 
for many years for the treatment of refractory se izures and depression. Recently, the FDA 
approved the transcutaneous form, which stimulates the cervical branch of the vagus nerve for 
the treatment of migraine and cluster headaches, pathologies that share similar 
VANQUISH  Version 6 
  12 January 2023  
 
  6 pathophysiology (inflammation, cortical s preading depression) to headache and secondary 
brain injury caused by [CONTACT_241012]. This is a very attractive way of stimulating the 
nerve avoiding the surgical complications of the invasive form, with strong evidence showing 
safety and efficacy  in multiple patient population s. 
Some of the potential beneficial effects of nVNS  in subarachnoid hemorrhage patients are 
(Figure 1):  
1-Analgesic Effect:  Oshinsky et al showed that nVNS  could reverse allodynia in animal model, by 
[CONTACT_735569]. (7) VNS has also been shown to inhibit 
trigeminal nerve firing when animal dura was stimulated. (8) Functional imaging in individuals 
receiving nVNS  shows the deactivation of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_336021]. (9) The trigeminal 
nucleus is the major sensory nucl eus for pain.  
2- Cortical spreading depression (CSD)  is a wave of electrical depolarization often seen in 
patients with traumatic brain injury, strokes, subarachnoid hemorrhage and migraine. A recent 
study detected 120 CSD with subdural electroencephalogr am (ECoG) in 8 out of 9 patients with 
aneurysmal SAH. The frequency of CSD peaked between days 5 and 7. Clustering of CSD 
correlated with the hypoxemia and development of delayed ischemic neurologic deficit. (10) It is 
postulated that inhibitin g cortical spreading depression could provide neuroprotection.  In SAH 
animal model, noninvasive VNS has been shown to significantly reduce CSD. (11) Patients with 
migraine with a ura are at increased risk of having strokes, this is thought to be due to CSD. 
Inhibiting CSD with VNS could potentially help reduc e headache in SAH and prevent delayed 
cerebral ischemia and strokes.  
3- Inflammation:  Vagus nerve has been shown to control the neuroendocrine immune axis. It 
regulates the immune system through the Hypothalamus Pi[INVESTIGATOR_117296] (HPA) pathway and 
modulate s the release of inflammatory mediators through the spleen and immune cells. (12) 
There are multiple ongoing huma n studies using VNS for the treatment of autoimmune diseases 
like rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. These inflammatory mediators are thought to be 
involved in the pathogenesis of headache and secondary brain injury in SAH patients.  nVNS has 
been sh own to decrease the rate of aneurysm rupture and improve outcome   in a mouse model 
of intracranial aneurysm. (13) 
4- Psychiatric disorders : A recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_735540] a potential beneficial 
effect in the treatment of anxiety. (14) In addition, there is an ongoing study evaluating nVNS  in 
generalized anxiety disorder , chronic pain , depression and PTSD .(15, 16)  Magalhães et al . 
showed that anxiety is a risk factor for persistent headache in SAH . (2)  
5- Seizures:  VNS is FDA approved for the treatment of refractory seizures. Seizures are 
commonly seen in SAH, and often physicians use prophylactic antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_23935]’s  in SAH, although 
this is not recommended due to the side effects of the antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_23935]’s . nVNS  could potentially 
prevent seizures in patients with SAH.

patients with SAH. (Figure 1)

  10 Given the potential benefits and its safety profile, nVNS  could potentially help control headache 
and secondary brain injury due to SAH.  
 
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT   
 
2.3.[ADDRESS_1004982] been  due to the surgical procedure or the continuous 
on-off stimulation. With transcutaneous VNS, one can avoid these side effects. Per the 
gammaCore  instructions for use (IFU) , some of the potential reversable complications are 
dyspnea,  dysgusia, and muscle twit ching or pain during the stimulation. (19) Per the IFU, other 
mild to moderate complications are: “Paresthesia  or dysesthesias lasting beyond the treatment 
period, skin irritation due to allergic reaction to gel, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, or loss of 
appetite, sweating, fatigue, depressed mood, tinnitus, p rogression of headache symptom, 
abnormal heart rhythm. Potential risks associated with non -invasive vagus nerve stimulation 
that may be moderate to severe: progression of headache symptoms, syncope, light -
headedness, and/or dizziness”. (19)  
 
A recent systematic review of [ADDRESS_1004983], followed by [CONTACT_735570] 3.6% and nasopharyngitis in 1.7% . (20) Cardiac 
side effects are one of the most feared complications of invasive VNS. However, th e review, 
which included patients with previous cardiac disease, found that cardiac side effects from 
nVNS  on either side are minimal, accounting for only 1 out of the 1322 patients. The individual 
developed symptomatic bradycardia after nVNS .(20) In addition, there are ongoing studies 
evaluating the usefulness of nVNS  in heart failure. Other rare complications are dizziness, facial 
palsy, nausea and vomiting. In addition, Redgrave et al could not show that side effects 
correlated with nVNS  dose. (20) nVNS has not been studied in patients with subarachnoid 
hemorrhage or brain aneurysms, however the invasive form has been used in patients with 
cerebral vascular malformations, and we are unaware of any  cases in the literature of 
intracranial hemorrhage due  to VNS. There is an ongoing clinical trial on safety of noninvasive 
VNS, in moderate traumatic brain injury which include “operative intracranial lesions”. (21) A 
recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_735541], tolerable and 
safe. (22) Given the lack of human studies in aneurysmal SAH, only patients with comple tely 
treated aneurysms will be part of the study. It is important to include this patient population 
given the potential benefits of VNS in controlling secondary brain injury ( strokes and delayed 
cerebral ischmia) thought to be due to inflammation and cor tical spreading depression. These 
secondary complications seen in a -SAH are not typi[INVESTIGATOR_735542]. In 
addition, a recent study on  nVNS in a mouse model with cerebral aneurysm ahowed that daily 
stimulation of the vagus nerve could be actually protective and decreased the risk of 
aneurysmal rupture (13). Other vascular malformations will be excluded, given that their 
interventional treatment is more co mplicated.  It is unknown if nVNS  has long -term side effects, 
however, studies have shown that most common long -term complications seen in the invasive 
VANQUISH  Version 6

  11 form were due to recurrent surgeries for device malfunction (battery and lead replacement). 
This is by[CONTACT_735571].  
 
 
2.3.2  KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
 
gammaCore  has been successfully studied  for the acute and preventive treatment of cluster 
and migraine headache. (19) It has been proven to decrease headache intensity, and prevent 
migraine attacks. To this point  it has not been studied  in patients with headache due to SAH. 
Given the shared pathophysiology (inflammation, cortical spread depression) and the potential 
of deactivating the nociceptive center, nVNS  could potentially alleviate SAH related headache, 
decreasing the usage of opi[INVESTIGATOR_735543]. This 
could potentially decrease the ICU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577], decrease  the readmission rate 
from headache due to SAH, decrease the outpatient usage of opi[INVESTIGATOR_735544].  
In addition, nVNS could also provide neuroprotection against stroke, one of the most feared 
complication in a -SAH. Stroke in a -SAH is thought to be due to vasospasm of blood vessels 
caused by [CONTACT_735572]. In animal model, 
noninvasive VNS has been shown to significantly reduce CSD. (11) In addition, nVNS  has anti -
inflammatory properties. Experimental animal studies have shown that VNS has the  potential of 
improving outcome in critical illnesses through its anti -inflammatory effects which could 
potentially extend to  sepsis, intracranial hemorrhage, ventilator related lung injury, 
postoperative cognitive dysfunction, myocardial ischemia and repe rfusion injury. One of the 
postulated mechanisms, is that it regulates α7nAChR which regulates inflammation. (23) Animal 
studies h ave shown that stimulating the α7nACh decreases inflammatory markers. (24) Through 
inhibiting CSD and controlling inflammation, nVNS  could potentially prev ent secondary brain 
injury (strokes and DCI) seen in a -SAH patients.  
 
Studies have also shown that VNS enhances neuroplasticity, which could fasten recovery. 
Animal studies on intracranial hemorrhage showed that VNS improves functional recovery. (25) 
Multiple ongoing studies are evaluating the beneficial effects of VNS in improving functional 
recovery during rehabilitation of patients with strokes. (22) nVNS  could potentially help 
recovery from SAH.  
 
In Summary, some of the immediate potential benefits of non-invasive VNS  could include : 
control of headache intensity, decreasing the s ide effects of narcotic and steroid  use, prevent

2.3.3  ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS  
 
Although the risks of nVNS in SAH population are unknown , a recent study in a mouse model of 
SAH showed that it decreased aneurysmal rupture rate and improve d outcome s in those with 
ruptured aneurysm . The authors noted the potential for nVNS in humans and the ability to  
translat e their research to human studies. (13) To minimize risks, if an aneurysm has been 
identified to be the cause of the SAH, patients will only be enrolled when the aneurysm has 
been com pletely treated. In addition, while in the NSCU , patients will be continuously 
monitored via telemetry, with frequent BP measurement. Studies conducted on patients with 
migraine and cluster headache were conducted as outpatient. Our patients are continuously 
monitored, and the medical staff are well eq uipped to treat any medical emergency. Vagus 
nerve stimulation will only be administered if the vital signs are stable (SBP>100 mmHg, 
MAP>6 0 mmHg, HR>60, Oxygen saturation > 90%) . 
 
 
 
3 OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
   
The primary outcome measurement for effective ness is: 
 
-The difference between the active and sham treatment groups in mean daily morphine 
equivalence dosage during study  
 
Secondary endpoints include descriptive comparisons between the active and sham treatment 
groups in:  
 
- The difference in mean daily headache intensity during the study  
- The difference between total overall morphine equivalence dosages  per subject during study  
 -Opi[INVESTIGATOR_735531] (such as urinary retention, constipation, sedation, nausea, 
vomiting and pruritis)  
- The difference in cytokines levels and brain permeability markers in the blood and/or CSF  
 before and after stimulation and between the sha m and active  device  group   
- Effects of VNS on brain permeability measured through CT perfusion studies  
-The difference in modified rankin scale at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_735547]. 
This will be collected retrospectively from the follow u p outpatient visit.  
 
Exploratory analyses will include descriptive comparisons of the rates of stroke, vasospasm, DCI, 
seizure, central fever and severity of vasospasm between the active and sham treatment groups.

4 STUDY DESIGN  
 
4.1 OVERALL  DESIGN  
 
This is a single site,  randomized sham  controlled, double blinded,  and parallel  group study 
comparing the efficacy and safety of  transcutaneous VNS in the management of headache 
VANQUISH  Version 6 
  12 January 2023  
 
  15 related to subarachnoid hemorrhage. We will screen patients diagnosed with subarachnoid 
hemorrhage who are admitted to Northshore University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_735549]. 
These are patients admitted under our care. Eligible patients will be enrolled after signing the 
informed consent. Enrollment will be performed between days 1 and 5 of aneurysm treatment. 
Subjects  will be randomized into one of the two groups below:  
1.    Group 1: Control ( patients will receive treatment using an inactive VNS device)  
2.    Group 2: Treatment (patients will receive treatment using an active VNS device)  
  
The Biostatistics Unit at  the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research [BU -FIMR] w ill develop a 
randomization plan for the study using the Biostatistics Randomization Management System 
[BRMS]. BRMS is a secure, HIPAA -compliant, web -based application that allows investigators to 
randomize subjects into randomized clinical trials (RCTs) u sing a personal computer  with internet 
access. A randomization allocation  will be generated by [CONTACT_64487] -FIMR using the method of 
permuted blocks. Details of the randomization procedure, including required record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_735550] l of the protocol.  The treatment group will receive 2, [ADDRESS_1004986] of the day by [CONTACT_735574]. The control group will 
receive a sham device, the device is physically identical to the active  device , and howeve r no 
stimulation will be delivered . Patients in either group will be informed that they might feel a  
tingling sensation or muscle twitch with either  device . Before  the stimulation is initiated, vital 
signs will be checked. This include s HR, SBP, MAP, and oxygen saturation. If vital signs are stable, 
defined as HR>60  beats per minute,  SBP> 100 mmHg, MAP > 60 mm HG, and saturation > 90% on 
room  air, nasal cannula  or face mask, the stimulation will be provided . In addition, both group s 
will receive s tandard of care  abortive medications. Pain is usually assessed every 4 hours and as 
needed, and abortive medications are given depending on the intensity of the headach e.  40 
patients will be enrolled,  and VNS will be performed for up to 10 days .

This is a randomized sham -controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] . The patients and the person assessing the 
patient’s response will be blinded. Standard medical care treatment will be provided to both 
arms of the study .  
 
4.3 JUSTIFICATION FOR DOSE  
This will be a transcutaneous stimulation of the cervical branch of the Vagus nerve to avoid the 
operative complications of invasive VNS. Stimulation frequency will be similar  to what was has 
been used in studies on headache .(17) Patients  will receive a dosage based on the instructions 
from the gammaCore  IFU: the physician or patient will start stimulating the cervical branch of 
the Vagus nerve and will gradually increase the amplitude  to the most comfortable stimulation 
level .  
 
 
 
4.4 END OF STUDY DEFINITION  
 
The study intervention will be up to 10 days in length . Vagus stimulation will be performed 4 
times daily ( approximately at 6:30 AM, 1 1:30AM, 4:30PM and 9:30 PM).  Data collection will 
continue till hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. If the participant becomes hemodynamically unstable, defined 
as hypotension requiring vasopre ssors  the VNS will be held for safety purposes. However, it will 
be resumed, once the patient is stabilized, off vasopressors for 48 hours. If the patient is being 
hemodynamically augmented for symptomatic vasospasm, n -VNS will not be withheld as the 
benef icial effects of n -VNS on symptomatic vasospasm will be  investigated in this study.

5.4 PRE -SCREEN FAILURES  
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this trial ( pre-screen failure) 
because of unsecured aneurysm  intubated or has symptomatic hydrocephalus  or symptomatic 
bradycardia  may be rescreened once the aneurysm is secured, patient is extubated and 
stabilized , and EVD is placed . Rescreened participants should be assigned the same participant 
number as for the initial screening.  
 
5.5 STRATEGIE S FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  
The neurosurgica l critical  care unit (NSCU) at Northshore University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_735552]. All transferred 
patients  
are admitted to the NSCU, as a result, patients can be easily identified by [CONTACT_735575] 
a daily basis. Every day, the neuroint ensivist or the research coordinator will evaluate which 
patients admitted to the NSCU have been diagnosed with subarachnoid hemorrhage. If an 
aneurysm is found to be the cause of the SAH, surgical or endovascular treatment of the 
aneurysm is typi[INVESTIGATOR_735553] [ADDRESS_1004989] successful treatment 
of the aneurysm  unless discharged earlier from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
 
We admit on average 110 SAH cases a year. If we assume that 50% satisfy our inclusion criteria, 
and that 70% will sign the inform consent , we should be able to reach our target number in 
approximately  12 months . Patients identified in the NSCU will be appr oached by [CONTACT_17881] , and the study will be explained to them .  
 
6 STUDY INTERVENTION  
 
6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION (S) ADMINISTRATION  
 
 
6.1.1  STUDY INTERVENTION  DESCRIPTION  
VANQUISH  Version 6 
  12 January 2023  
 
  21  
GammaCore  has received FDA approval /clearance  for the treatment of acute migraine and 
acute or preventive treatment of cluster headache. It has not been studied for the  treatment of 
headache in SAH. Given the shared pathogenesis of headache in SAH and migraine, we would 
like to test the device in SAH  patient population. Per the GammaCore  IFU: “gammaCore  
Sapphire ™ (non -invasive vagus nerve stimulator) is a multi -use, hand -held, rechargeable, 
portable device consisting of a rechargeable battery, signal -generating and -amplifying 
electronics, and a contr ol button for the subject to adjust the signal amplitude. GammaCore  
Sapphire  provides visible (display) and audible (beep) feedback on the device and stimulation 
status. A pair of stainless steel surfaces, which are the skin contact [CONTACT_27922] (stimulation 
surfaces), allows the delivery of a proprietary electrical signal. Tubes of electroCore -approved 
gel are provided with each unit. The subject applies the gel to the stimulation surfaces to 
maintain an uninterrupted conductive path from the stimulation surfa ces to the skin on the 
neck. The stimulation surfaces are capped when not in use. gammaCore  Sapphire produces a 
low-voltage electric signal consisting of five [ADDRESS_1004990] with a peak voltage limited to 
24 V when placed on the skin and a maximum output current of 60 mA. (19). Each stimulation is 
designed to be applied for two minutes (120 seconds), after which the device automatically 
turns off. Each device allows for multiple stimulations”. (19) 
6.1.2  DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION  
Two -two minute transcutaneous stimulation s will be administered every 5 hours  
(approximately 6:30 AM, 11:30 AM , 4:30 PM and 9:30 PM) with no relation to meals. Some 
patients might miss few stimulations as they might be getting a procedure, have unstable vital 
signs, or refuse the stimulation, among st other reasons that might make stimulation not 
feasible. If vital signs are stable ( HR >  60 beats/minute , and SBP> 100 mmHg and MAP> 6 0 
mmhg  and saturation > 90% on room, nasal cannula  or face mask, ), nVNS or Sham will be 
initiated. We will start by [CONTACT_735576], the device will be placed in direct 
contact [CONTACT_735577]. The stimulation will be performed by [CONTACT_102], with 
assistance from a n IRB approved personnel  if the patient is uncomfortable pe rforming it. The 
stimulation intensity will be increased as directed by [CONTACT_735578] . Patients will be 
informed that they m ay or may not  feel a tingling sensation  with the investigational device and 
the sham device . Two [ADDRESS_1004991] on cerebral vasospasm.

DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL  
 
7.1 DISCONTINUATION  OF STUDY INTERVENTION  
The study intervention will be held  during procedure days, or if the participant gets intubated, 
or is in shock (cardiogenic, distributive or septic) . During non -procedure days, or o nce 
extubated and stabilized and participant becomes alert t he study intervention can be resumed.  
 
VANQUISH  Version 6 
  12 January 2023  
 
  24 In additio n, as stated earlier, if HR< 60 beats/min, SBP<100 mm HG, or MAP< 60 mm HG and 
oxygen saturation < 90 %, the intervention will be postponed .  
 
If hemodynamic instability or unstable arrhythmia occur during the VNS, and is thought to be 
due to the VNS by [CONTACT_3433] e investigator, the participant will be discontinued from the study 
procedure, however, will be followed until discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
 
If a clinically significant finding is identified (including, but not limited to changes from baseline) 
after enro llment, the investigator or qualified designee will determine if any change in 
participant management is needed. Any new clinically relevant finding will be reported as an 
adverse event (AE).  
 
 
7.2 PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL  FROM THE STUDY  
Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.  
An investigator may discontinue or withdraw a participant from the study for the following 
reasons:  
• Significant study intervention non -compliance  
• If any clinical a dverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or 
situation occurs such that continued participation in the study would not be in the best 
interest of the participant  
• Disease progression which requires discontinuation of the study in tervention  
• If the participant meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously 
recognized) that precludes further study participation  
• Participant unable to receive the study intervention for more than 3 consecutive days  
The reason for  participant discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be recorded on the 
Case Report Form (CRF). Subjects who sign the informed consent form but do not receive the 
study intervention may be replaced.  Subjects who sign the informed consent form, a nd receive 
the study intervention, and subsequently withdraw, or are withdrawn or discontinued from the 
study, will not be replaced.

  25 hydrocephalus) an external ventricular drain will be placed. Most patients will get either a CT 
angiogram or a conventional angiogram to rule out a vascular malformation, especially if there 
is no history of trauma. If an aneurysm  is detected, the standard of care is to treat it as soon as 
possible. Usual ly, an aneurysm is either coiled or clipped (craniectomy or craniotomy). Every 
patient admitted with subarachnoid hemorrhage will get graded accordingly to their headache 
intensity, level of consciousness and neurologic deficits with the Hunt Hess grade (ta ble 2). 
Their CT scans also get graded (modified fisher scale  mFS ) according to the thickness and 
location of blood  (table 3). All subarachnoid hemorrhage (unless there is minimal amount of 
blood and no vascular malformation) are admitted to the Neurosurgical care unit (NSCU). 
Detailed  physical examination, including the NIHSS,  history, including medication history, past  
medical , surgical history, and social history are recorded in the medical record s. North  Shore 
University hospi[INVESTIGATOR_735554] r eferral center for most of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_735555].  Most  aneurysmal SAH patients get transferred to our unit. Per standard of care, all 
women of child bearing age, admitted to the NSCU get a urine or blood pregnancy test, patients 
suspected of abusing drugs get urine toxicology. Once in the NSCU, patients get vital signs and 
neurologic assessment every  hour, and pain assessment every 4 hours and as needed. The 
length of stay in the intensive care unit depends on the amount of blood on the head scan 
(mFS) . Patients with higher mFS are more prone to get delayed cerebral ischemia . As a result, 
per standard of care, patients with SAH get almost daily transcranial dopplers to monitor for  
cerebral  vasospasm, frequent head scans , occasionally brain perfusion studies and MRI of the 
brain. Patients are monitored for central fever (vital signs, blood cultures), cerebral salt wasting 
with frequent BMP and urine output measurements, seizures with PRN  electroencephalograms 
(EEG). Once out of the crit ical care period, (vasospasm usually starts at day [ADDRESS_1004996] bleeding and 
peaks at day  10), patients get transferred to a regular neurosurgical floor before being 
discharged home or to rehabilitation. On average patients stay in the NSCU between 2-21 days.  
All patients admitted to the NSCU with SAH will be screened and evaluated for the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria  after obtaining an informed consent.  
 
Screening  involves reviewing the medical records following HIPPA regulation for: Age, gender, 
ethnicity, presence of aneurysm, day of rupture, etiology of the SAH if not aneurysmal, 
radiologic ( Angiogram, CT head) and medical history before and after the aneurysm i s secured, 
Glasgow coma score before and after aneurysm repair, modified fisher scale (mFS), Hunt -Hess 
grade ( HHS), time of ictus, history of alcohol and drug abuse, presence of hydrocephalus on 
head CT, presence of an external ventricular drain ( EVD) , date of EVD placement, new HHS 
after EVD placement, clippi[INVESTIGATOR_605817].  Medical records will be reviewed for the past medical 
history (pacemaker, defibrillator, history of CHF, arrhythmias, cervical carotid disease, history of 
a headache disorder like mi graine or cluster headache), physical examination, labs will be 
reviewed which includes but not limited to  pregnancy test and urine toxicology. Headache 
intensity  and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2573], steroids and acetaminophen usage  are recorded in the electronic medical 
record. The presence of vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia will be noted.  
Once found eligible satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria,  and informed consent signed,  
patients will be randomized to either the treatment group or the control group. The same data 
will be recorded for both groups.  The treatment period will start once admitted in the NSCU  
and will last for up to 10 days.  
VANQUISH  Version 6

During the NSCU stay, patients areevaluated for pain every 4 hours. If vital signs are stable 
(SBP> 100 mmHg and HR> 60 beats per minutes with no arrhythmia on telemetry, MAP> 6 0 
mmHg and oxygen saturation  > 90% ) patient will receive either  the treatment ( nVNS ) or the 
Sham device  every [ADDRESS_1004997] of care : 
• Transcranial dopplers (TCD)  
• Neuroimaging (CT head, MRI brain, angiograms , CT perfusion with permeability study )  
• EVD wean ing and day of start of weaning  
• Presence of vasospasm, d elayed cerebral ischemia, Central fever, Cerebral salt wasting. 
These are usually recorded in the medical record.  
• Urinary retention documented as frequent straight catheterization for more than 3 days  
• Constipation evaluated by [CONTACT_735579], suppository, lactulose or magnesium 
oxide administered   
• Blood tests, CSF studies  
• EEG results  
• Neurologic examination incl uding Glasgow coma score , and NIHSS  
• Delir ium score  
 
When T ranscranial dopplers  are being done as per standard of care, we will a ssess the 
change s in transcranial velocities around the time of the s timulation of the V agus nerve.  
 
When possible, we will draw blood or in case there is an EVD we will also collect CSF for 
biomarkers . Not more than 5 ml of blood will be drawn  before the 11:30 am stimulation 
session of the Vagus nerve. This will be repeated  approximately 24 hours later, at 11:[ADDRESS_1004998] -ictus  
In case there is an EVD, 2 cc of CSF from the drain and 20 cc of CSF that is otherwise 
discarded will be drawn  before the 11:30 am stimulation  session  of the Vagus nerve. 
Another 2 cc of CSF from the drain and 20 cc of CSF that is otherwise discarded will  be 
drawn approximately 24 hours later, at  around  11:[ADDRESS_1004999] of care between days 3-10, blood brain 
permeability will be evaluated and results wil l be compared between the sham group 
and the active device group.  
 
 
During the period of the study after the patients are discharged from the ICU to the 
Neurosurgical floor, we will evaluate the ir daily  headache intensity  and morphine 
equivalence dosage , in addition to their TCD results, Neuroimaging and EEG results, 
neurologic examination and vital signs.

and pain assessment evaluated every 4 hours and as needed . In the NSCU, patients are on 
continuous  ECG analyze s via telemetry . Stimulation will only be given if HR >60 and the 
SBP>100 mmHg , MAP> 60 mmHg  and oxygen saturation is >90 % for safety concerns. The 
presence of intolerable pain at the stimulation site, skin irritation, hoarseness, and change  in

  30 8.3.2  DEFI NITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)  
 
Serious adverse event is defined as in the view of the investigator, the occurrence of any of the 
following complications:  
 
Death  
A life-threatening adverse event  such as  any hemodynamically unstable arrhythmia  
Prolongs existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_735558], be life -threatening, or re quire 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
 
For adverse events ( AEs) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following 
guidelines will be used to describe severity.  
 
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the 
participant’s daily activities  like skin  irritation, transient dysgeusia , transient hoarseness , 
vomiting, mild pain at the stimulation site during stimulation .  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the 
therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning , 
like mild  shortness of breath, chest pain and reversible facial palsy.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening 
or incapacitating.  Of note, the term  “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious” . 
Like hypotension  requiring treatement , hemodynamic stable  arrhythmia , severe 
dyspnea requiring medical treatment  
 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION  
 
Using th e investigator clinical judgment,  the relation of the adverse events to the use of the 
device  will be reported as,  
 
• Definitely Related – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other 
possible contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an ab normal 
laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to study intervention 
administration and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_735580] 6 
  12 January 2023  
 
  31 chemicals. The response to withdrawal of the study intervention (dechallenge) should  
be clinically plausible. The event must be pharmacologically or phenomenologically 
definitive, with use of a satisfactory rechallenge procedure if necessary.  
• Probably Related – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence 
of other  factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test 
result, occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the study intervention , is 
unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and foll ows 
a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is 
not required to fulfill this definition.  
• Potentially Related – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the 
event occurred within a reasonabl e time after administration of the trial medication). 
However, other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the participant’s clinical 
condition, other concomitant events). Although an AE may rate only as “possibly 
related” soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more information and later 
be upgraded to “probably related” or “definitely related”, as appropriate.  
• Unlikely to be related – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, 
whose temporal relationship to study intervention administration makes a causal 
relationship improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after 
administration of the study intervention ) and in which other drugs or chemicals or 
underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the participant’s clinical 
condition, other concomitant treatments).  
• Not Related – The AE is completely independent of study  intervention administration, 
and/or evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another e tiology. There 
must be an alternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
Some of the expected adverse events are: application site discomfort , application site 
irritation/redness, local pain, face/head/neck area (including too thache), muscle twitching 
and/or contractions, face/head/neck area (including facial droop and/or lip pull), 
headache/migraine, dizziness, tingling, pricking, or a feeling of “pi[INVESTIGATOR_5625]” on the skin 
where the device is applied ( paresthesia/dysesthes ia) 
 
Additional expected adverse events , which have been associated with other VNS devices, are 
cough, gastrointestinal  discomfort, hoarseness or change in voice , irregular  heart beat 
(arrhythmia), metallic taste, nausea, shortness of breath (dyspnea)  
 
The principle investigator will be responsible for determining whether an adverse event ( AE) is 
expected or unexpected.  An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or 
frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information prev iously described for the 
study intervention .

8.3.3  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
The occurrence of an adverse event ( AE) or serious adverse event ( SAE) may arise at a ny time.  
As a result, the patient will be evaluated directly  after each stimulation . The neurointensivist in 
charge will determine the frequency of vital signs and neurologic examination checks.  
 
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the crite ria for SAEs will be captured 
on the appropriate  case report form  (CRF). Information to be collected includes event 
description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity  and relatedness to the study 
device , and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while in the study 
must be documented appropriately regardless of the relationship  to the device . All AEs will be 
followed to adequate resolution.  
 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is scree ned will be 
considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition 
deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessmen t of the duration of 
the event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require 
documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
 
The principal  investigators  will record all reportable events with start dates occurri ng any time 
after informed consent is obtained until [ADDRESS_1005002] day of study participation  (Vagus 
nerve is stimulated) , or until discharge from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (whatever  comes first) .  Events will be 
followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  
 
8.3.[ADDRESS_1005003] in charge of the patient will evaluate all side effects and deem it s 
seriousness and relatedness to the device.  
 
All adverse effects thought to be part of the natural history of SAH, or mild side effects that are 
expected to occur during the VNS such as skin irritation, muscle twitch, transient dyspnea 
during stimulation , transient hoarseness during stimulation, mild pain at the stimulation site 
will be recorded in the participant’s medical record and will be collected as secondary 
endpoints. All serious or severe or unexpected side effects related to the device will be 
reported to the IRB within 7 days  of the PI’s knowledge. Any unknown adverse event thought to 
be related to the device will also be reported to the IRB.

The study clinician will  report to the IRB any serious adverse event  related or potentially related 
to the  study intervention. All serious adverse events ( SAEs ) will be followed until satisfactory 
resolution or until the site investigator deems the event to be chronic or the participant is 
stable.

Actions:  
o Participants must have stable vital signs (SBP>  100mmHg, MAP>6 0 mmHg, HR> 
60 beats/minute, oxygen saturation > 90%, not on mechanical ventilation) 
before the vagus nerve is stimulated. If unstable vital signs, the stimulation will 
be skipped, until the patient is more stable.  
o If the  participant s devel op a life-threatening  arrhythmia thought to be due to the 
VNS, subject will be taken off therapy, but will continue to be followed until end 
of study.  
o If the participants get intubated or develops hemodynamic shock due to the 
natural history of the disease , the subject will be taken off the therapy.  
The study investigator shall complete an Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect Form and 
submit to the reviewing Institutional Review Board (IRB) as soon as possible, but in no 
event later than [ADDRESS_1005005] will be enrolled in this inpatient trial  
 
 
8.4 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
 
8.4.1  DEFINITION OF U NANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP)  
 
The Office for Human Research Protections ( OHRP ) considers unanticipated problems involving 
risks to participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that 
meets all of the following criteria:  
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research  procedures 
that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review 
Board ( IRB)-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the 
characteristics of the participant population being studied;  
VANQUISH  Version 6 
  12 January 2023  
 
  35 • Related or pos sibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means 
there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and  
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known 
or recognized.  
 
 
8.4.2   UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTING  
 
The investigator  will report unanticipated problems ( UPs) to the reviewing Institutional Review 
Board ( IRB). The UP report will include the following information:  
 
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB 
project number;  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, ex perience, or outcome;  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or 
outcome represents an UP;  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been 
taken or are proposed in response  to the UP. 
 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following 
timeline:   
 
• UPs that are serious adverse events ( SAEs) will be reported to the IRB within 2 days  of 
the investigator becoming aware of the event.  
• Any other UP will be reported to the IRB within [ADDRESS_1005006] side effects occur during stimulation, the individual will be 
informed directly (within 3 days) of the unanticipated problems . 3 days in order to make sure 
that the UP is due to the VNS.

[IP_ADDRESS]  CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION  
 
Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the individual’s agreeing to participate in the 
study and continues throughout the individual’s study participation.  Consent forms will be Institutional 
Review Board ( IRB)-approved and the participant will be asked to read and review the document. The 
investigator will explain the research study to the participant and answer any questions that may arise. 
A verbal explanation will be provided in terms suited to the participa nt’s comprehension of the 
purposes, procedures, and potential risks of the study and of their rights as research participants.  
Participants will have the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form and ask questions 
prior to signing.  The part icipants should have the opportunity to discuss the study with their family or 
surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. The participant will sign the informed 
consent document prior to any procedures being done specifically for the st udy. Participants must be 
informed that participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw from the study at any time, without 
prejudice. A copy of the informed consent document will be given to the participants for their records. 
The informed consent p rocess will be conducted and documented in the source document (including the 
date), and the form signed, before the participant undergoes any study -specific procedures. The rights 
and welfare of the participants will be protected by [CONTACT_735581].  
If the patient is physical disabled and is unable to sign the informed consent, oral consent process for 
more than minimal risk research will be followed as stated in the HRPP Policy and Procedures Manual . If 
patient decision capacity is in doubt, a mini mental state examination will be performed, and if the score 
is <24, the signature [CONTACT_4007] a healthcare Agent, guardian or next of kin will be requi red with an assent 
of the patient.

  50 POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE AE SECTION  
11.1 ADVERSE EVENTS/ADVERSE DEVICE EFFECTS AND DEVICE DEFICIENCIES  
The definitions and procedures for reporting adverse events (AE), adverse device effects (ADE), 
serious adverse events (SAE), serious adverse device effects (SADE) and are presented in the 
sections below. It is of utmost importance that all staff involved in the investigation are familiar 
with the definitions and procedures and it is the responsibility of the Clinical Investigator to 
ensure this.  
11.1.1  ADVERSE EVENT/ADVERSE DEVICE EFFECT DEFINITIONS  
Adverse Event  
Any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disea se or injury, or untoward clinical signs 
(including abnormal findings) in subjects, users or other persons, whether or not related to the 
study device . 
Note1: This definition includes events related to the investigational medical device or 
comparator.  
Note 2 : This definition includes events related to the procedures involved  
Note 3 : For users or other persons, this definition is restricted to events related to 
investigational medical device  
Adverse Device Effect  
Adverse event related to the use of an investigational medical device  
Note 1: This definition includes any event resulting from insufficiencies or inadequate 
instructions for use, deployment, implantation, installation, or operation, or any malfunction of  
the investigational medical device.  
Note 2: This definition includes any event that is a resulting from a user error or from 
intentional misuse of the investigational medical device.  
11.1.2  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT/SERIOUS ADVERSE DEVICE 
EFFECT/UNANTICIPATED ADVERS E DEVICE EFFECT DEFINITIONS  
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse event that:  
a) Leads to a death  
b) Led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject that either resulted in:  
VANQUISH  Version 6 
  12 January 2023  
 
  51 1. a life -threatening illness or injury or  
2. a permanent impairment of a body structure o r a body function, or  
3. in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_735566],  
4. medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or permanent         
impairment to a body structure or a body function  
c) Led to foetal distress, foetal d eath or a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
Serious Adverse Device Effect  
A SADE is an ADE that results in any of the consequences characteristic of an SAE or that might 
lead to any of these consequences if suitable action is not taken, if interventio n is not made or 
if circumstances are less opportune.  
11.1.[ADDRESS_1005020] ([LOCATION_003]DE)  
Serious adverse device effect which by [CONTACT_5942], incidence, severity or outcome has not been 
identified in the current version of the risk analysis  report.  
Note: Anticipated serious adverse device effect (ASADE) is an effect which by [CONTACT_6073], incidence, 
severity or outcome has been identified in the risk analysis report.  
 
11.1.4  REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS/ADVERSE DEVICE EFFECTS  
[IP_ADDRESS]  METHODS FOR ELICITING ADVERSE EVENTS/ADVERSE DEVICE EFFECTS  
All subjects will be carefully monitored for the occurrence of AEs during the investigation period 
from the run -in to the completion of follow up.  The Clinical Investigator will collect AE 
information using non-leading questions such as “have you experienced any new health 
problems or worsening of existing conditions”. Events directly observed or spontaneously 
volunteered by [CONTACT_735588].  
Clearly related signs, symptoms and abnormal diagnost ic procedure results should be grouped 
together and reported as a single diagnosis or syndrome whenever possible.  
All AEs including but not limited to events reported by [CONTACT_735589] o r member of this team, which fall into any of the 
above definitions must be recorded as an AE in the CRF and should include the following 
information.  
• Brief description of the event (diagnosis)  
VANQUISH  Version 6 
  12 January 2023  
 
  52 • Start date (and time, if relevant)  
• Stop date (and time, if rel evant) (or resolution)  
• Severity  
• Action taken regarding the medical device  
• Opi[INVESTIGATOR_735567]  
• Seriousness  
• Outcome  
Severity  
Severity describes the intensity of an event and will be assessed as:  
 
Mild  
The AE does not interfere in a significant manner with the subject’s normal functioning level. It 
may be an annoyance.  
 
Moderate  
The AE produces some impairment of function but not hazardous to health. It is uncomfortable 
and/or an embarrassment.  
 
Severe  
The AE produces significant impairment of functioni ng or incapacitation and/or it is a hazard to 
the subject.  
 
If an AE changes in severity, it should be reported as an AE of new severity but with the same 
description.  
Causality (Adverse Device Effects/ADE)  
Causality will be assessed as:  
VANQUISH  Version 6 
  12 January 2023  
 
  53  
Related (definite ly, possible or probable)  
 
A causal relationship between the clinical investigational medical device and the AE is at least a 
reasonable possibility, i.e. there is evidence or argument suggesting a causal relationship.  
 
Not related  
There is no indication that the AE was caused by [CONTACT_735590].  
 
ADEs will be reported by [CONTACT_43078] “yes” box for ADEs on the CRF page for AEs/ADEs.  
The procedures described for AEs above will be followed for documenting ADEs.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  FOLLOW -UP OF SUBJECTS WITH ADVERSE EVENTS  
Any AE that is ongoing when the subject is withdrawn from the investigation should be 
followed -up until the AE is resolved or the Clinical Investigator decides that the AE is stable and 
needs no further follow -up. The date when  the Clinical Investigator considers one of these 
outcomes to have occurred for the last ongoing AE for a subject will be considered the last visit 
for this subject, and the outcome should be recorded in the CRF.

INTRODUCTION
Glasde gib (PF-04449913) is a novel small molecule inhibitor of the Sonic Hedgehog (Hh) 
pathway  which is currently  under development for the treatment of hematologic 
malignancies. 
This multi -center open
-label Phase 1b study  is designed to evaluate the safety , efficacy , 
pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacod ynamics (PD) of glasdegib when combined with 
azacitidine in patients with previously  untreated Higher -Risk My elodysplastic Sy ndrome 
(MDS), Acute M yeloid Leukemia (AML), and Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia 
(CMML ).  This clinical study  includes two components: (a) a safet y lead-in co hort ( LIC)and 
(b) an expansion phase with two cohorts.
Indication
Safety  Lead-InCohort (LIC)
Previously  untreated adult patients with I ntermediate -2or High- Risk MDS according to the 
International Prognostic Scoring Sy stem (IPSS), AML  with 20% -30% blasts and 
multi- lineage dy splasia according to World Health Organization (WHO) 2008 classification, 
and CMML .
Expansion
(a) Previousl y untreated adult patients with I ntermediate, High, or Very  High risk MDS 
according to the International Prognostic Scoring Sy stem-Revised (I PSS-R) and (b) AML 
patients who are not candidates for intensive chemotherap y (according to WHO 
2016 classification).
Background and Rationale
Disease Overview
MDS is a heterogeneous group of my eloid disorders defined by  a common set of featur es, of 
which the most prominent is morphologic bone marrow and peripheral blood dysplasia 
associated with inefficient hematopoiesis, the development of peripheral cy topenias and an 
increased risk of transformation to AML .  The incidence of MDS is around 4–5 per 
100,000 individuals annually  worldwide, with the prevalence increasing with age.
The French
-American- British (FAB) classification sy stem established in [ADDRESS_322635] to the FAB classification were to consider patients w ith 20% or more bone marrow or 
peripheral blood blasts as having AML , and to remove the CMML  subt ype and place it in a 
newly  created category  termed M yelod ysplastic/ My eloproliferative Neoplasms 
(MDS/MPN). 
PF-[ADDRESS_322636] of care treatment of higher risk (In termediate -2and High -Risk) MDS and AML 
with 20- 30% bone marrow ( BM)blasts and multi -lineage d ysplasia, has previously  been 
focused on intensive chemotherap y using anthracycline and cytarabine (Ara -C) combinations 
but this approach has led to lower comple te response rates and a shorter response duration as 
compared to treatment outcomes in patients with de -novo AML ≥30% BM blasts.   In 
response to this unmet medical need, several multi -center randomized studies comparing
hypomethy lating agent (HMA) treatment to supportive care have been conducted and 
demonstrated delay ed progression to AML , with prolongation of median progression -free 
survival (PFS) of between [ADDRESS_322637] supportive therap y. 
Azacitidine was approved in the US by  [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) in 2004 for 
the treatment of all MDS subty pes according to the FAB classification.  This approval was 
based on the overall response rate defined as Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response 
(PR) observed in the randomized CALGB -9221 study .  The overall response rate (CR + PR) 
was 15.7% in the azacitidine treatment group, and there were no responders in the control 
group.
In 2009, results from the international AZA -001 trial, phase 3 randomized trial comparing 
azacitidine to conventional care regimens (CCR) in patients with I ntermediate - 2or High Risk 
MDS, showed that the median overall survival (OS) was significantly  prolonged in the 
azacitidine arm as compared with the CCR arm (24.5 months for azacitidine vs. 15.0 months 
for CCR; hazard ratio [HR] 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI ] 0.43 –0.77) despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a low CR 
rate (17% in the azacitidine arm vs 8% in the CCR arm).  Based on this observed survival 
benefit, azacitidine was approved in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of adults 
who are not eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and have Intermediate -
2or 
High- Risk MDS, CMML with 10 -29% marrow blasts and lacking a m yeloproliferative 
component, and AML with 20
-30% blasts and multi -lineage d ysplasia accordin g to WHO 
2008.
AML  is a geneticall y heterogeneous hematologic malignancy  characterized by  [CONTACT_265335][INVESTIGATOR_265300], 
resulting in treatment resistance, disease relapse, and reduced survival.  It is estimated that 
there will be 21,380 new cases and 10,500 deaths from AML  in the [LOCATION_002] in 2017.
Existing standards of care such as cy tarabine + anthracy cline (7+3), or hy pomethy lating 
agents like decitabine and azacitidine, can indu ce CR in 5 -70% of patients; however, 
remissions are not durable and disease relapse occurs in up to 60% of patients.  For AML  
patients unable to receive intensive chemotherap y, existing standard treatments like L ow 
Dose Cy tarabine (LDAC) are associated wit h response rates <20% and median OS times of 
5-6.[ADDRESS_322638] unmet medical need in the treatment of AML patients.   
I
n 2015, results from the international randomized phase 3 AZA -AML trial comparing 
azacitidine to CCRs in patients aged ≥65 years with newly  diagnosed or secondary  AML 
with >30% bone marrow blasts demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement in median

Page 22overall survival ( mOS) in the azacitidine arm of 10.4 months (95% CI , 8.0- 12.7) versus (vs) 
6.5months (95
% CI , 5.0- 8.6) in the CCR arm (HR=0.85; 95% CI, 0.69 -1.03; stratified 
log-rank p= 0.1009), although the primary  endpoint was not met. The CR rate in the 
azacitidine arm was lower than the CCR arm (19.5% vs 21.9%). The 1 -year survival rate 
with azacitidine was 46.5% compared with 34.2% with conventional therapy (95% CI, 
3.5%
-21.0%). Based on the observed survival benefit, the EU expanded the approval of 
azacitidine in AML  to adult patients aged 65 years or older who are not eligible for 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with >30% myeloblasts according to the 
WHO classification; previously , the indication covered AML patients with <30% blasts. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_265301], azacitidine is currently  the sta ndard of 
care for AML patients who are not candidates for intensive chemotherapy . New treatments 
are needed to improve outcomes in this older AML population. 
Rationale for Glasdegib/Azacitidine Combination Therap y
Glasdegib was initially  evaluated as a single -agent therap y in patients with select myeloid 
malignancies, and had a manageable safety  profile at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) 
of 100 mg once a day  (QD)per os with earl y signs of efficacy  observed in AML , MDS, 
chronic m yeloid leukemia (CML), and M yelofibrosis (MF).
In the saf ety LICof the current study , 12patients with previously  untreated high risk MDS 
(n=7), AML with 20 -30% blasts and multi -lineage dy splasia (n=3), ery throleukemia (n=1), 
and CMML  (n=1) were treated at the glasdegib , 100 mg QD per os, in co mbination with 
azacitidine 75 mg/m2daily  for 7 days subcutaneously  (SC) every  28days. An internal safety  
review team reviewed the data from this component of the study  and determined that the 
safet y profile of the combination treatment appeared to be co nsistent with what was expected 
for glasdegib or azacitidine alone, with no unexpected toxicities identified, and deemed 
acceptable to proceed to the next phase of development. Preliminary  efficacy  data from the 
LICshowed 5 patients responded: 3 patients with CR, 2 patients with marrow complete 
remission ( mCR): of note, after the data cutoff date, the complete blood count of 1 of the 
patients with mCR had normalized, consistent with CR. Of the 5 patients who responded, 
4 responses occurred on or before D ay 100. Of the 4 patients with CR (including the mCR 
patient who achieved a CR after the data cutoff date), 3 patients had AML (75% CR rate vs 
the historical control for azacitidine alone, 19.5%) and 1 patient had MDS (14% CR rate vs 
the historical contro l for azacitidine alone, 17%). A further 4 patients had stable disease 
(SD). No evidence of drug -drug interaction ( DDI)was noted. As of September 2016, mOS 
had not been reached. 
In the Phase 1b part of Study  B1371003, 52 patients with AML  or higher ri sk MDS were 
treated with glasdegib 100mg or 200 mg by [CONTACT_34048]  (PO Qday )in combination with low 
dose cy tarabine (LDAC) (n=23), decitabine (n=7), or 7 + 3(n=22). Median OS in the 
combined AML and MDS patients were 4.4 months (80% CI : 2.5, 6.6) , 11.5 months (80% 
CI:4.5, 17.4) (vs historical mOS of 7.7 months with decitabine alone), and 34.7 months (80% 
CI: 14.5, not reached ) , respectively , in the 3 treatment a rms.  Of the AML patients treated in 
combination with decitabine, 2/5 (40%) responded (1 CR a nd 1 complete response with 
incomplete blood count recovery  (CRi)). Of the high- risk MDS patients treated in 
combination with decitabine, 2/2 responded (2 mCR). The safet y profile of glasdegib in

Page 23combination with chemotherap y was consistent with what was seen in an earlier 
monotherapy study in patients with selected m yeloid malignancies.   A similar population of 
newly  diagnosed elderl y AML  patients was enrolled into a Phase 3 study  of decitabine vs 
supportive care vs low dose cy tarabine where the CR+ CRi rate was 25.6% in the decitabine 
only arm. 
In the Phase 2 portion of Study  B1371003, a prospective, randomized (2:1), open -label 
clinical trial in 132 previously  untreated AML patients who were not candidates for intensive 
chemotherap y based on age or oth er risk factors and higher risk MDS, the addition of 
glasdegib 100mg orally  PO Qday  to LDAC vs LDAC alone resulted in a significant 
improvement in OS (mOS 8.8 months (80% CI :
6.9, 9.9) vs 4.9 months (80% CI : 3.5, 6.0) ; 
hazard ratio [HR] 0.513 [80% CI : 0.394-0.666]; 1 -sided p -value=0.0004). The CR/CRi rate 
for AML patients in the glasdegib + LDAC arm was 25% (80% CI: 19.1, 30.9 )vs 4.5% (80% 
CI: 0.5, 8.6) in the LDAC alone arm. The safet y/tolerability  profile was consistent with that 
in elderly  AML patie nts receiving chemotherap y. 
Glasdegib, which targets the Hh pathway  component Smoothened (SMO), is an oral inhibitor 
of the Hh pathway  currently  in clinical development for patients with my eloid malignancies. 
The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway  regulates
cell differentiation and self- renewal in the 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_265302] o, and is ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y silenced in adult tissues. Aberrant Hh signaling in the 
post-embry onic stage may  result from mutations in key  pathway  genes, non -mutational 
mechanisms related to the secreti on of Hh ligands, or signals from cells in the tumor 
microenvironment. Aberrant Hh signaling has been identified in a variet y of human myeloid 
malignancies, and specifically  in leukemia stem cells (L SCs).
In a preclinical MDS model, blocking the Hh pathwa y with SMO inhibitors in combination 
with the hy pomethy lating agent ( HMA )azacitidine generated s ynerg y in vitro with growth 
inhibition in primary  malignant my eloid cells ex vivo. Upregulation of Hh pathway  
components has been observed in chemoresistant A ML cell lines in vitro, and
pharmacological inhibition of the Hh pathway  resulted in decreased multi
-drug resistance 
1(MDR -1) or P -glycoprotein (P -gp) expression in these cells.   In nonclinical models SMO, 
acting via its effector GLI2, has been implicated in the maintenance of LSC dormancy  and 
associated resistance to chemotherap y and targeted therap y, while inhibition of SMO via 
glasdegib can cause LSCs to re -enter the cell cy cle. Recrudescence of LSCs is prevented in 
preclinical hosts pre -treated with Hh pathway  inhibitors, including glasdegib . Consistent 
with these effects, glasdegib sensitized AML  cells to cy tosine arabinoside, and abrogated 
resistance to cy tosine arabinoside in AML  cells co -cultured with stromal cells. 
The clinical safet y database of glasdegib contains over 300patients with hematologic 
malignancies who received the recommended dose of at least 100 mg dail y.The safet y 
profile observed so far appears consistent with what has been reported for other marketed 
smoothened (SMO) inhibitor s and the underl ying chemotherap ybackbones when 
administered in combination. Glasdegib has shown clinical activity  in patients with higher 
risk MDS and AML patients who were not candidates for intensive chemotherapy  when 
combined with other treatments, such as azacitidine and decitabine and demonstrated a 
statistically  significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS when combined with 
LDAC vs L DAC alone.

adverse events (SAEs), the active reporting period to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative begins from the time that the p atient provides informed consent, which is 
obtained prior to the patient’s participation in the study, (ie, prior to undergoing a ny study related procedure and/or receiving investigational product), through and 
including [ADDRESS_322650] , even if another anticancer therapy has been started .  Serious adverse events occurrin g 
to a patient after the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all serious adverse events 
that the investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility of being 
related to study drug are to be reported to the sponsor.
19. Concom itant Medications and Treatments : All concomitant medications and treatments should be recorded in the CRF.

Page 521.INTRODUCTION
Glasdegib ( PF-04449913) is a novel small molecule inhibitor of the Sonic Hedgehog (Hh) 
pathway  which is currently  under development for the treatment of hematologic 
malignancies.
This multi -center open
-label Phase 1b study  is designed to evaluate the safety , efficacy , 
pharmacokine tics (PK), and pharmacody namics (PD) of glasdegib when combined with 
azacitidine in patients with previously  untreated Higher -Risk My elodysplastic Sy ndrome 
(MDS), Acute M yeloid Leukemia (AML), and Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia 
(CMML ).  This Phase 1b stud y includes two components: (a) a safet y lead-in cohort ( LIC)
and (b) an expansion phase with two cohorts.
1.1.Indication
Safety  Lead-InCohort
Previously  untreated adult patients with Intermediate -2or High- Risk MDS according to the 
International Prognostic Sc oring Sy stem (IPSS), AML  with 20% -30% blasts and 
multi- lineage dy splasia, ( according to World Health Organization (WHO) 
2008 classification), and CMML .
Expansion
Previously  untreated adult patients with Intermediate, High, or Very  High risk MDS 
according t o the International Prognostic Scoring Sy stem -Revised (I PSS-R), and 
AML  patients who are not candidates for intensive chemotherapy  (according to WHO 
2016 classification).
1.2.Background and Rationale
1.2.1. Disease Overview
MDS 
is comprised of a heterogeneous group of my eloid disorders defined by  a set of 
common features, of which the most prominent is morphologic bone marrow and peripheral 
blood dy splasia associated with inefficient hematopoiesis, peripheral cy topenias, and 
increased risk of transformation to AML .
The incidence of MDS was previousl y estimated to be around 4 –5per 100,000 annually  
worldwide, with the prevalence increasing with age.1An older publication based on the 
Surveillance, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623] , and End Resu
lts (SEER) –Medicare database, indicated that in 
the US the incidence of MDS in individuals aged ≥65years might be as high as 75 per 
100,000.2A recent analysis published in 2015 estimates the true incidence of MDS to be 
between 5.3 and 13.1 per 100,000 using newer case capture methods. Medicare claims data 
in the US shows the incidence of MDS in patients aged ≥65years to now be as high as 
162per 100,000. MDS prevalence is estimated to be 60,000 and –170,000 in the United 
States of America ( [LOCATION_003] )and projected to increase (Cogle et al, 2015).[ADDRESS_322665] demonstrated that MDS results from the acquisition of 
genetic and epi[INVESTIGATOR_265305]-renewal.  Recent data indicate that cy togenetic patterns are not stable in MDS, and that 
as the disease progresses a significant fraction of patients acquire additional cytogenetic 
changes.  This phenomenon is associated with an increased risk of transformation to AML  
and a worse overall survival.3
The French- American- British (FAB) [ADDRESS_322666] to the FAB classification were to consider patients with 
20% or more bone marrow or peripheral blood blasts as having AML , and to remove the 
CMML  subty pe and place it into a newly  created category  termed M yelodysplastic/ 
Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MDS/MPN). The WHO [ADDRESS_322667] of genetic markers on 
diagnosis and disease management and will be used to classify the MDS patients in the 
expansion component of the current study  (Arber et al, 2016).51
Independent of the classification sy stem applied, MDS prognosis is established by  [CONTACT_265339]: morphology, percentage blasts, cy topenias and cy togenet ic 
characteristics.  According to the 4 category  International Prognostic Scoring Sy stem (IPSS), 
the higher -risk MDS group (Intermediate -2and High -Risk) is characterized by a median 
overall survival of less than 12 months and by  a high risk of transformat ion to AML .8The 
IPSS has been updated to the I nternational Prognostic Scoring Sy stem -Revised (IPSS -R) via 
incorporation of additional elements of cy togenetics and further prognostication into 
5categories (Gre enberg et al, 2012).43Patients enrolled into the safet y LICof the study  were 
assessed using I PSS and patients enrolled into the expansion component of the study  will be 
assessed using the more contemporary  IPSS-R (Appendix 10).  The inclusion of the I PSS-R 
risk of intermediate, high, or very  high, has a concordance greater than 80% with the old 
IPSS scoring sy stem.[ADDRESS_322668] of genetic markers on diagnosis and disease manag ement and will be used to 
classify  the AML patients in the expansion component of the current study  (Arber et al, 
2016).[ADDRESS_322669] prognostic factors for OS (R öllig et al, 2011).52In 2011, the 
European LeukemiaNet (EL N) proposed a risk reporting sy stem that integrated molecular 
and cy togenetic factors, dividing 
AML  patients into 4 risk categories (favourable, 
intermediate -1, intermediate -2, adverse), demonstrating that these groups varied in terms of 
median survival times. Historical median OS for patients 60years who did not receive an 
allogeneic stem -cell tr ansplant by  [CONTACT_265340]: favorable (63.6 months), 
intermediate -1(13.6 months), intermediate -2(18.7 months), and adverse (6.0 months) 
(Röllig et al, 2011).52Historical mOS for patients >60 yearsby [CONTACT_265340]: 
favorable (14.6 months), intermediate -
1(9.5months), intermediate -2(9.2months), and 
adverse (4.8 months) (R öllig et al, 2011).52The ELN s ystem was recentl y updated in [ADDRESS_322670] 6 years. In the revised s ystem, the intermediate -1and 
intermediate -2risk groups are collapsed into one since they  were prognostically  
indistingu ishable in elderly  patients, resulting in 3 risk categories (favourable, intermediate, 
adverse) (D öhner H et al, 2017).42In addition, the EL N group proposed new response 
categories ( Appendix 11) for AML patients reflective of new data meant to integrate 
definitions across trials. The AML population proposed in the expansion component of the 
current stud y will be categorized by  [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_322671] sy stem and assessed b y the updated 
respons e categories.
1.2.2. Hedgehog (Hh) Pathway Signaling in MDS
A milestone in perceiving cancer as a disorder of differentiation and development was the 
identification of cancer stem cells that self -renew, initiate, and re -initiate tumor development 
and give rise to the bulk of the tumor.  The persistence of such tumor -initiating cells may  
contribute to tumor resistance and impact overall survival.  Standard chemotherap y, 
radiotherap y and targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_265306], but are less effective at targeting 
tumor -initiating cells.  The key  challenge has been to identify  the molecular mechanisms 
maintaining and sustaining tumor -initiating cell activity , self -
renewal and survival. 
Hhsignaling is critical in animal patterning and terminal cell differentiation durin g 
embryogenesis, and may  play  a key  role in human malignancies when aberrantly  activated.  
Following birth, the Hh pathway  is repressed in most cells, but activated during tissue repair 
and in self -renewing populations.  Hh signaling is initiated when the Hh ligands: I ndian Hh 
(Ihh), Sonic Hh (Shh), and/or Desert Hh (Dhh) bind to the Patched (PTCH) transmembrane 
protein and inactivate its function, which in the absence of Hh is to tonically inhibit SMO 
signal transduction.  Following deactivation of PTCH in response to the binding of Hh

Page 55ligands, the seven- transmembrane protein Smoothened (SMO), which is normally  held in an 
inactive state b y PTCH, is released and activates a signaling cascade that regulates the Gli 
family  of transcription factors ( Figure 2).  The Gli family  of genes encode proteins that 
function either as transcriptional repressors (in the absence of Hh), or as transcriptional 
activators (in the presence of Hh) of genes controlled by  [CONTACT_265341] .  Several proteins 
modulate the ratio of Gli activator (GliA) to Gli repressor (GliR) activity  and in so doing 
determine the level of active cellular Hh ligand ( Figure 2).[ADDRESS_322672]
The expression of Hh- related genes has bee n assessed in primary  human CD34+cells, CD34+
blastic cells (from MDS and AML patients) and BM stromal cells.  Both I hh and its signal 
transducer SMO, were expressed in CD34+AML  and MDS -derived cells.  Moreover the 
expression of the intrinsic Hh- signaling inhibitor, human Hh -interacting protein (HHIP) was 
markedl y lower in AML/MDS -derived stromal cells as compared with healthy donor- derived 
stromal cells.  Furthermore, in vitro treatment with azacitidine rescued the HHI P expression 
PF-04449913

Page 56via demeth ylation of HH IP gene and reduced the leukemic cell- supporting activity  of 
AML /MDS -derived stromal cells.14These data demonstrate the relevance of Hh signaling in 
primary  CD34+blasts derived from AML and MDS and confirm it s involvement in shapi[INVESTIGATOR_265307]. 
Furthermore, over -expression of the Hh signaling target gene BMI1 was detected in MDS 
patients, and inversel y correlated with the apoptosis of CD34+cells.  I n addition, 
over-expression of BMI1 was correlated with an elevated IPSS score and a shorter overall 
survival in MDS patients, facilitated proliferation, and inhibited apoptosis of MDS cells in 
vitro.  This suggests that over-expression of BMI1, a target o f the Hh signaling pathway , 
induces resistance to apoptosis and confers an adverse prognosis in MDS.[ADDRESS_322673]  was investigated in total BM and in CD34+
cells from MDS patie nts and health y donors.  PTCH and SMO showed decreased expression 
in MDS CD34+cells, whereas GLI1 overexpression was observed, indicating pathway  
activation in MDS progenitors.16
In nonclinical AML models, SMO, acting via its effector GLI2, has been implicated in the
maintenance of L SC dormancy  and associated resistance to chemotherapy  and targeted 
therap y, while inhibition of SMO via glasdegib can cause LSCs to re -enter the cell cy cle 
(Sadarangani, 2015; Tauchi , 2015; Fukushima, 2016).[ADDRESS_322674]  inhibitors, including glasdegib
(Fukushima et al, 2016 ). Consistent with these effects, glasdegib sensitized AML  cells to 
cytosine arabinoside, and abrogated resistance to cy tosine arabinoside in AML  cells 
co-cultured with stromal cells ( Fukushima, 2016).[ADDRESS_322675]  with SMO inhibitors in combination 
with the hy pomethy lating agent (HMA) azacitidine (Aza) generated s ynergy in vitro with 
growth inhibition in primary  maligna nt my eloid cells ex vivo (Tibes, 2015).56Hh inhibition 
in combination with HMAs represents a mechanistically  attractive approach for the 
elimination of the L SC population, while at the same time targets the deregulated gene 
expression in patients with higher -risk MDS.   Taken together these results suggest that the 
Hh signaling pathway  is frequentl y aberrantly activated in MDS patients and its inhibition 
represents an attractive therapeutic approach to improve d isease control.
1.2.3. Rationale for 
Glasdegib /Azacitidine Combination Therapy in Patients with 
Higher -Risk MDS, AML, and CMML
Treatment of higher risk (Intermediate-2 and High -Risk) MDS and AML  with 20 -30% blasts 
and multi -lineage d ysplasia, has ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_265308] b ased on intensive chemotherap y using 
anthracy cline and cy tarabine (Ara -C) combinations.  This has resulted in lower CRrates and 
shorter CR duration with respect to that observed in primary  AML.2,[ADDRESS_322676] 
compared treatment with a HMA treatment to supportive care in MDS patients, including the 
D-0007 (decitabine), AZA -001 (azacitidine), CALGB -9221 (azacitidine), and 
EORTC -[ZIP_CODE] (decitabine) trials.  These trials have demonstrated delay ed progression to 
AML  following HMA therap y, with an improvement in median PFS over supportive care 
ranging from 3 to 8months.18-21
Indeed, MDS is characterized by  [CONTACT_173474][INVESTIGATOR_265309], including the 
hypermethy lation of genes that control proliferation, adhesion, and other characteristic 
features of this pre -leukemic status.  Aberrant deoxy ribonucleic acid (DNA) 
hypermethy lation is associated with a poor prognosis in MDS that can be accounted for by  a 
more rapid progression to AML .39
Azacitidine was approved in the US by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) in [ADDRESS_322677] supportive care (BSC) 
and in two single -arm studies.  The overall response rate (complete response + partial 
response) observed in the randomized study  CALGB -9221 was 15.7% in the azacitidine 
treatment arm and there were no responders in the control arm (P <0.0001). The median 
duration of overall survival did not significantly  differ between patients receiving azacitidine 
and those receiving supportive care, although the results were confounded by  49best 
supportive care patients (53%) that crossed over to azacitidine during the course of the trial.   
In a landmark anal ysis designed to eliminate this confounding effect, the median duration of 
overall survival was significantly  longer in patients initially  randomized to azacitidine as 
compared with those initially  randomized to supportive care who did not cross over to 
azacitidine or who crossed over after 6 months had elapsed (18 versus 11 months; 
p = 0.03).21
Results published in 2009 from the international AZA -001 phase 3 randomized trial 
comparing azacitidine to conventional care regimens (CCR), including BSC, low dose 
cytarabine (LDAC) and intensive chemotherapy , in [ADDRESS_322678] an overall survival benefit.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a low CR 
rate (17%) , azacitidine treatment significantly  prolonged OSwith respect to CCR.  Median 
OSwas 24.5 months (9.9–not reached) for the azacitidine arm versus 15.0 months (5.6–24.1) 
for the CCR arm (hazard ratio 0.58; 95% CI  0.43– 0.77).  A significantly  lower risk of
progression to AML (HR=0.50, 95% CI 0.35 –0.70; p<0.0001) was also observed with 
azacitidine as compared with CCR, and transfusion independence was achieved more 
frequentl y in the azacitidine arm.18Based on the results of this trial, azacitidine was 
approved in European Union for the treatment of adults who are not eligible for HSCT and 
have Intermediate -
2or High -Risk MDS, CMML  with 10 -29% marrow blasts without 
myeloproliferative component, and AML with 20-30% blasts and multi -lineage d ysplasia, 
(according to the WHO 2008).

Page 58Animportant observation from the AZA-001 study  was that the achievement of CR is not a 
prerequisite for increased OS.  Indeed, the results of this trial demonstrated that patients who 
achie ved hematologic improvement (HI) (based on the I nternational Working Group (IWG) 
2000
criteria for MDS) but never attained complete or partial response still obtained a 
survival benefit .[ADDRESS_322679] of care in front line higher risk MDS and AML  patients 
with 20- 30% blasts and multi -lineage dy splasia , although it is not curative.  Continued 
treatment with azacitidine is necessary  in order to maintain clinical responses and following 
failure of the azacitidine treatment, life expectancy  among MDS patients is short with a 
median survival of less than 6 months.22As a result of these limitations, combination 
treatments of investigational agents with an HMA as a backbone are currently  under 
investigation.23
AML  is a geneticall y heterogeneous hematologic malignancy  characterized by  [CONTACT_265335][INVESTIGATOR_265310], 
resulting in treatment resistance, disease relapse, and reduced survival. 
In 2015, results from the international randomized phase 3 AZA -AML trial comparing 
azacitidine to CCRs in patients aged ≥ 65 years with newly  diagnosed or secondary  AML 
with >30% bone marrow blasts demonstrated a clinically  meaningful improvement in mOS 
in the azacitidine arm of 10.4 months (95% CI , 8.0-12.7) vs 6.5 months (95% CI , 5.0- 8.6) in 
the CCR arm (HR=0.85; 95% CI , 0.69-1.03; stratified log- rank p= 0.1009), although the 
primary  endpoint was not met. The CR rate in the azacitidine arm was lower than the CCR 
arm (19.5% vs 21.9%). The 1 -year survival rate with azacitidine was 46.5% compared with 
34.2% with conventional therap y (95% CI, 3.5% -21.0%; 
Dombret et al, 2015) .57Based on 
the observed survival benefit, the EU expanded the approval of azacitidine in AML  to adult 
patients aged [ADDRESS_322680] with >30% my eloblasts 
accord ing to the WHO classification; previously , the indication covered AML  patients with 
<30% blasts. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_265301], azacitidine is the 
currentl y the standard of care for AML patients not suitable for intensive chemotherap y. 
New treatments are needed to improve outcomes in this older AML  population. 
Preliminary  efficacy  data from the safety  LICof the current study  which enrolled patients 
with high risk MDS per IPSS, AML  with 20- 30% blasts and multi -lineage dy splasia, and 
CMML , treated with glasdegib 100mgPO Qday  in combination with azacitidine, showed 
5patients responded: 3 patients with CR, 2 patients with marrow mCR .  Of note, after the 
data cutoff date, the complete blood count of 1 of the patients with mCR had norma lized, 
consistent with CR. Of the 5 patients who responded, 4 responses occurred on or before Day  
100. Of the 4 patients with CR (including the mCR patient who achieved a CR after the data 
cutoff date), 3 patients had 
AML  (75% CR rate vs the historical c ontrol for azacitidine alone, 
19.5%) and 1 patient had MDS (14% CR rate vs the historical control for azacitidine alone, 
17%). A further 4 patients had SD. No evidence of drug-drug interaction (DDI) was noted.  
As of September 2016, mOS had not been reac hed.  In the Phase 1b part of Study  B1371003, 
52patients with previously  untreated AML or higher risk MDS were treated with glasdegib
100mg or 200 mg PO Qday in combination with low dose cy tarabine (LDAC) (n=23),

decitabine, 2/5 (40%) responded (1 CR and 1 complete response with incomplete blood count 
recovery  [CRi]). Of the high -risk MDS patients treated in combination with decitabine, 
2/2responded (2 mCR). Median OS in the combined AML and MDS patients were 
4.4months, 11.5 months (vs historical mOS of 7.7 months with decitabine alone), and 
34.7 months respectivel y in the 3 treatment arms.  A similar population of newly  diagnosed 
elderl y AML patients was enrolled into a Phase 3 study  of decitabine vs supportive care vs 
LDAC where the CR+ CRi rate was 25.6% in the decitabine onl y arm.
In the Phase 2 portion of Study  B1371003, a prospective, randomized (2:1), open -label 
clinical trial in 132 previously  untreated AML patie nts not suitable for intensive 
chemotherap y based on age or other risk factors and higher risk MDS, the addition of 
glasdegib 100mg orally  PO Qday  to LDAC vs LDAC alone resulted in a significant 
improvement in OS(mOS 8.8 months (80% CI : 6.9, 9.9) vs 4.9 months (80% CI : 3.5, 6.0) ; 
hazard ratio [HR] 0.5
13[80% CI : 0.394-0.666] ; 1-sided p -value=0.0004). In addition, the 
CR/CRi rate for AML patients in the glasdegib + LDAC arm was higher than the LDAC 
alone arm ( 25% [80% CI: 19.1, 30.9] vs 4.5% [80% CI : 0.5, 8.6 ]).When glasdegib was 
combined with treatments commonly  used in patients with higher risk MDS and AML not 
suitable for intensive chemotherapy  (azacitidine, decitabine, and LDAC), improvements in 
response rates and OS in the context of historical co ntrols were observed.
The target population in the safet y LICfor this study  was aligned with the AZA 001 trial, 
which addressed changes in the FAB and WHO 2008 MDS classifications sy stems.  The 
population included Intermediate -2and High -Risk MDS according to IPSS, AML  
20-30% BM blasts and with multi -lineage dy splasia, (WHO 2008) considered smoldering 
leukemias that may  remain stable for weeks or months, somewhat MDS- like, and therefore 
not necessaril y benefiting from the intensive treatments used for clas sic AML  patients, and 
lastly  CMML  patients without a my eloproliferative component (MDS t ype), defined as white 
blood cells (WBC)  13x 109/L according to the FAB classification.  All three 
hematological malignancies described above have been shown to benef it from azacitidine 
treatment.
In the expansion component of this study , patients with Intermediate, High, or Very  High 
risk MDS according to IPSS -R and AML  patients who are not candidates for intensive 
chemotherap y (WHO 2016) will be enrolled. CMML  patie nts and patients with 
unclassifiable MDS/MPN areeligible for enrollment into the MDS cohort.  Based on the 
results of the AZA -AML trial, the azacitidine label was expanded in 2009, making 
azacitidine a standard of care treatment in elderl y AML  patients un able to tolerate intensive 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. This historical data, coupled with the preliminary  efficacy  data from the safet y 
LICof the current study  warrants further investigation of azacitidine’s benefit in a larger 
AML  population. Since several prognostic a nd classification sy stems were recentl y updated, 
the following will be implemented in the expansion component of the study to make it more 
contemporary : IPSS -R and the WHO [ADDRESS_322681] risk stratification and updated response categories and 
the revised WHO 2016 classification sy stem will be applied to the AML patients.

Page 60Given the central role that Hh signaling plays in cellular differentiation through modulating 
both the leukemia ste m cells (L SC) population and the surrounding stromal environment, Hh 
inhibition in combination with HMAs represents a mechanisticall y attractive approach for the 
elimination of the L SC population while targeting the gene expression deregulation involved 
inthe pathway  development in patients with Higher -Risk MDS, AML , and CMML . 
1.2.4. Summary of Glasdegib Product Profile
Glasdegib is a potent and selective inhibitor of the Hh signaling pathway  through binding to 
its target SMO.  I t is currently  being developed fo r the treatment of hematologic 
malignancies.  Complete information for glasdegib may be found in the single reference 
study  document (SRSD), which for this study  is the Investigator Brochure (IB).26
Glasdegib inhibited the binding of a known comparator inhibitor of SMO (PF-03451358)
with an half maximal inhibitory  concentration (IC50)of 4nM.  I n addition, in a Shh- induced 
Gli-Luciferase reporter assay , glasdegib inhibited the Hh pathway  activity  with an I C50of
3nM.  
Using human aortic adventitial fibroblasts, Shh stimulation for 48 hours induced a 
300% increase in endogenous Gli1 levels, assessed using quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR); glasdegib at 100 nM inhibited 75% of the ligand- induced Gli1 levels.  
Glasdegib was also evaluated in mouse 3T3 -L1preadipocy tes, a cell line that forms 
trigly cerides through a mechanism activated by  [CONTACT_265342].  I n this 
model, glasdegib (50nM) reproducibly  antagonized Shh, restoring 60% of lipid production 
relative to control cultures induced with insulin alone.26
In the PTCH/P53 medulloblastoma mouse model of Hh pathway -driven tumors, 
glasdegib inhibited pathway  activation (Gli1 expression) and produce d rapid and complete 
tumor regression.  Preclinical PK/PD modeling using this model suggests a target human 
dose of 15 mg/day  is projected to yield at least 50% of tumor Gli1 messenger ribonucleic 
acid ( mRNA )inhibition from baseline levels and approximate ly 20% of skin Gli1 mRNA 
suppression.26
A series of preclinical studies show that glasdegib has significant activity  in imatinib 
resistant chronic m yeloid leukemia (CML) blast crisis disease (Abrahamsson -Schaire r A. et 
al).38Patient derived CD34+ imatinib resistant blast crisis CML  cells xenotransplanted into 
immunocompromised mice treated with glasdegib alone or in combination with dasatinib 
reduced primary leukemic tumor burden.  In addition, glasdegib treatment reduced leukemic 
tumor formation in secondary recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], suggesting that glasdegib is able to inhibit the L SC 
population necessary  for tumor propagation.  Importantly , this was verified in CML  T315I 
mutants, which have escaped tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI)inhibition.
1.2.5. Glasdegib Preclinical Toxicity Data
Glasdegib has been extensively  characterized in nonclinical safet y studies in rats, dogs and 
rabbits.  Glasdegib was evaluated in safety  pharmacology  studi es (cardiovascular, 
neurofunctional, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] ), definitive toxicology  assessments of up to 6 -and 9 -months 
duration, in vitro and in vivo genetic toxicity  studies, local irritation study  and embry o-fetal 
developmental toxicity  studies.  The primary  target organs in rat included kidney , bone, and

Page 61tooth.  Additional findings were observed in rat testis and peripheral nerve, and clinical 
observations included alopecia and muscle tremor/twitching.  The no observed adverse effect 
level (NOAE L) determined from the 6 month Good L aboratory  Practices (GLP
)rat study  
was 10 mg/kg/day , corresponding to free plasma concentrations of 116 ng/mL  (Cmax) and 
36ng/mL  (Cavgss).  The primary  target organs in the dog included kidney and liver.  
Additional observations of alo pecia and skin irritation/inflammation, and QTc prolongation 
were identified in the dog.  A NOAEL from the [ADDRESS_322682] dose tested in this study , 1mg/kg/day , the free plasma concentrations were 
16ng/mL  (Cmax)and 2 ng/mL  (Cavgss).  Glasdegib was teratogenic at all doses tested in rats 
and rabbits.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Kidney Effects in Preclinical Studies
The kidney  was identified as a target organ in both rat and dog toxicity  studies.  Adverse 
kidney  damage (tubular degeneration/ necrosis, cytomegaly , inflammation, regeneration) was 
observed in rats at ≥50mg/kg/day  and dogs at ≥1 mg/kg/day  and was ascribed as the primary  
cause of unscheduled euthanasia in both species.  Kidney damage partiall y reversed in rats 
and fully  reversed i n dogs during the recovery  phase in both the GL P 6-month rat and 
9-month dog studies.
1.2.6. Bone Effects in Preclinical Studies 
Bone (epi[INVESTIGATOR_265311]) and tooth (incisor) effects were observed in rat GL P studies with glasdegib .  
Bone changes in the femur and sternum 
were characterized b y decreased/disorganized 
chondrocy tes and partial to complete closure of epi[INVESTIGATOR_265312].  The odontopathy  were 
characterized b y incisor tooth necrosis and/or complete loss of the tooth and in some animals 
was coincident with oral mucosal ulceration and inflammation.  The effects on bone and 
teeth persisted during recovery  phases and did not reverse.  The changes in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_265313] (Hh) pathway  in growing bone 
(Kimura et al, 2008 )24and chondrogenesis ( Amano et al, 2008 )25and the generation of 
ameloblast progenitors from stem cells in the continuously  growing rodent incisor ( Seidel et 
al, 2010 ; Dassule et al, 2000)61,62is dependent on Hh pathway activity.
1.2.7. Cardiovascular Effects in Preclinical Studies 
The potential for QT prolongation was identified from the in vitro human 
ether -à-go-go-related gene (hERG )assay  and in vivo cardiovascular dog study .  Glasdegib
produced dose related changes in the QTc interval.  At 5 mg/kg, a small (5 msec) but 
statistically  significant increase in QTc interval occurred at free plasma exposures of 
420ng/mL  (Cmax).  At 30 mg/kg, a statistically  significant increase in QTc interval (24 msec) 
occurred at free plasma exposures of 1848 ng/mL (C max).  The QTc prolongation observed in 
the dog is consistent with the hERG I C50for glasdegib (3.1 uM).
1.2.8. Embryo -fetal Effects in Nonclinical Studies
Teratogenicity  was identified in rat and rabbit embry o fetal developmental toxicity  studies.  
Glasdegib treatment was associated with increased spontaneous abortions, lower 
embry o
-fetal survival, higher incidence of skeletal anomalies, lower fetal body  weights, and 
higher incidences of external, visceral and skel etal malformations and variations.  A

Page 62developmental NOAEL could not be established in rat or rabbit due to adverse teratogenic 
effects at all doses.  Inhibition of Hh signaling has been shown to induce teratogenicity  in 
animals as SMO is involved in embry onic development.  Accordingl y, inhibition of Hh 
signaling by  [CONTACT_265343] ( Chen et al, 2002
, Cooper et al, 
1998).63,64
1.2.9. Other Findings in Preclinical Studies 
Additional glasdegib -related findings in rats were observed in testis and peripheral nerve, and 
clinical observations included alopecia and muscle tremor/twitching.  Microscopic changes 
in the nerve and clinical observations of alopecia and muscle tremors full y recovered.  
Testicular degeneration did not recover; however this finding was only  seen in y oung 
growing rats and not in adult dogs and is consistent with inhibition of Hh signaling which 
plays a role in postnatal testis spermatogenesis ( Mäkelä et al, 2011 ).65In dog toxicity  studies 
with glasdegib, mild liver inflammation with increased liver enzymes was observed in some 
dogs.  However, this finding was only  evidenced in dogs with adverse renal damage and is 
likely  secondary  to kidney  findings.  The liver findings partially  recovered.
Glasdegib was not genotoxic in any  in vitro or in vivo assessment, d id not cause local 
irritation when administered intravenousl y or perivascularl y to rabbits and did not cause 
photo -irritancy  in the ey e or skin.
1.2.10. Clinical Relevance of Organ Toxicities Observed in Nonclinical studies
In general, man y findings in the rat and dog predict drug reactions reported in the clinic with 
glasdegib; these include muscle spasms, alopecia and QTc prolongation.  However; not all of 
the organ toxicities observed in animals have been observed in humans when treated with 
glasdegib. Although mild axonal degeneration was observed in rat mesenteric peripheral 
nerve, there have been no reported clinical effects related to worsening or new onset of 
peripheral nerve deficits.  The kidney  is a target organ in rat and dog. In the clinical 
program, at glasdegib, 100 mg dose, acute kidney  injury  has been reported, primarily  Grade 
1-2. These events were often associated with prerenal confounders or consequent to or 
exacerbated b y other glasdegib effects (eg, diarrhea, vomiting, and/or 
decreased oral i ntake). 
An imbalance in creatinine elevations was not seen in the AML  unfit L DAC + glasdegib arm 
versus the LDAC arm alone.
There have not been an y liver events or significant increases in liver transaminases reported 
in the clinic.  Findings in bone, tee th and testis are considered onl y a potential concern for 
pediatric patients as Hh signaling is important in growth and development of these tissues as 
cited above, thus, these effects have not manifest in adult patients and are not a risk for adults 
being treated with glasdegib .
1.2.11. Clinical Pharmacokinetic Summary
Data following single and multiple dos esof glasdegib from Study B1371001 in patients with 
selected hematologic malignancies are summarized for all cohorts tested (5, 10, 20, 40, 80,

Followi ng repeated dail y dosing, steady -state was achieved b y Day 8based on comparison of 
Ctrough values across PK days in C ycle 1.  Median T maxof glasdegib ranged from 1-2 hours 
following a single dose and 1-4 hours following multiple dosing.  The mean 
glasdegib volume of distribution ( Vz/F)ranged from 185 -455 L.  The geometric 
%
coefficient of variance (CV) for AUC infacross all dose levels ranged from 19% to 
109% following a single dose ( safety  LIC) and from 10% to 61% for AUC tauafter multiple 
dosing (Day  21).  Similarly , the geometric % CV for C maxranged from 3.0% to 79% after a 
single dose and 7.0% to 83% following multiple dosing.
The geometric mean t ½for glasdegib ranged from 17.4

levels; however, at most dose leve ls, the half- life was ~24 hours.  The geometric mean 
apparent oral clearance ( CL/F)ranged from 5.63 to 12.7 L/hour following a single dose and 
5.33 to 13.3 L/hour following multiple dosing.  Glasdegib accumulated following repeated 
dosing with a median R acranging from 1.2 to 2.5.  This was consistent with the observed t ½, 
as the predicted R acis in agreement with the estimated R ac.  The median linearit y ratio (R ss) 
ranged from 0.[ADDRESS_322683] of the tested dose le vels.
The geometric mean for the percentage of administered dose excreted unchanged in the urine 
over the dosing interval of 24 hours ranged from 5.89% to 16.8%.  The geometric mean for 
renal clearance ranged from 0.385 L/hr to 1.36 L/hr.
1.2.12. Clinical Pharmaco dynamic Summary
Analy sis of Hh pathway  gene expression changes in surrogate tissue (skin) in samples 
collected from both the B1371001 (n=3) and B1371002 (n=15)  studies indicated 
>75% down regulation of the expression of the Hh pathway  gene GLI1 at doses of [ADDRESS_322684]- treatment decrease in IL -8and IL -10 in one MF patient who responded 
to treatment in B1371001, although limited conclusions can be drawn due to the small 
number of samples available for anal ysis.
1.2.13. Clinical Experience in Patients with Selected Myeloid Malignancies
Currently  there are five clinical studies with glasdegib in patients with hematological 
malignancies (B1371001, B1371003, B1371005, B1371013, and I nvestigator I nitiated

[IP_ADDRESS]. Study B1371001: Patients with Select My eloid Malignancies
A total of 47 patients were screened and assigned to treatment in this Phase 1 dose escalation 
study  aimed to identify  the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and RP2D of 
glasdegib in 
patients with select my eloid malignancies.  The dose levels tested in this study  were: 5, 10, 
20, 40, 80, 120, 180, 270, 400 and 600 mg QD on a continuous regimen.  The majority  
(28/47 patients, 59.6%) of patients were male.  The median age was 69 years (range 
25-89 years).  The diagnoses of enrolled patients inclu ded: AML (28 patients, 59.6%), CML  
(5patients, 10.6%), CMML  (1patient, 2.1%), MDS (6 patients, 12.8%), and MF (7
patients, 
14.9%).  The median duration of treatment with glasdegib was 64.5 days (range: 5 -261 days) 
in AML  patients, 36.0 days (range: 1 -280 days) in CML  patients, 54.0 days (range: 
54-54 days) in CMML  patients, 153.0 days (range: 36 - 537days) in MDS patients, and 
182.0 days (range: 44 -371days) in MF patients.
Out of the 41 dose limiting toxicity  (DLT) evaluable patients, [ADDRESS_322688] 
frequentl y reported treatment related AEs were dysgeus ia (27.7%), decreased appetite 
(19.1%) and alopecia (14.9%).  A summary  of treatment related AEs occurring in >5% of all 
patients is provided in Table 5below.
Grade [ADDRESS_322689] results independent of causality  included: l ymphocytes decreased 
(n=16), platelets decreased (n=8), WBC decreased (n=8), hemoglobin decreased (n=10), 
neutrophils decreased (n=3), alanine aminotransferase ( ALT) increased (n=1), alkaline

Page 65Based on electrocardiogram (ECG) results, 3 patients (1 patient in the 400 mg QD group and 
2 patients in the 600 mg QD group) had a post baseline maximum Corrected Q T interval 
using Fridericia Formula (QTcF) of 500msec, and 6 patients (1 from the 5 mg group and 
5from the 600 mg group) had a maximum QTcF increase from baseline of 60msec.  
Higher frequencies and grades of QTcF prolongation were observed at the high est dose 
levels (400 mg QD and 600 mg QD).  All these events were as ymptomatic and transient and 
did not result in significant clinical sequelae.
The MTD was defined as 400 mg after considering the one DLT at 600 mg (Grade 
3 peripheral edema) and the high frequency  of QTc prolongation observed at the 600 mg QD 
dose level.  The Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) for glasdegib was determined to be 
200mg, based on the following factors:
Doses of glasdegib up to 200 mg were safe and well tolerated following prolonged 
administration (most patients tolerated stud y drug for a minimum of 3 cycles in the 
dose range of 5 -180 mg); 
At doses >200 mg, 3 patients (1 patient in the 400 mg group and 2 patients in the 
600 mg group) had a post baseline maximum QTcF interval of 500msec;
An overall lower frequency of treatment related Grade 3/[ADDRESS_322691] commonly  reported treatment 
related AEs were of Grade 1 or 2severity  suggesting that glasdegib is generally  well 
tolerated in this dose range. 
Although evaluation of efficacy  was not the primary  objective of this study , patients were 
evaluated for disease specific efficacy  endpoints.  A total of 4 MDS/CMML patients 
(4/7patients: 3/6 MDS patients and 1/1 CMML  patient, 57.1%) achieved stable disease or 
better, among whom 2 patients (2/7 patients, 28.6%) showed hematologic improvement.  For 
the 7 MF patients, 2 patients achieved clinical improvement.  For patients with AML  
(28patients), 1 patient (3.6%) had morpho logic complete remission with incomplete blood 
count recovery  (CRi), 4 patients (14.3%) had partial remission with incomplete blood count 
recovery  (PRI), and 4 patients (14.3%) had minor response (MR).  Treatment failures 
occurred in 7 AML patients (25%) due to resistant disease.  Clinical benefit (CR + CRI  + PR 
+ PRI  + SD+ MR) was shown in 16 AML  patients (57.1%), including 7 patients (25%) with 
SD.
Out of the 46 patients evaluated for efficacy , 2/7 MDS/CMML  patients (28.6%), 2/7 MF 
patients (28.6%), and 9/28 AML  patients (32.1%) had an objective response. 
In summary , glasdegib appears to be well tolerated with earl y signs of efficacy observed in 
all the hematologic diseases studied.  Several patients with aggressive malignancies remained 
on trial for pro longed durations.  On target AEs (eg, dy sgeusia and alopecia) were observed 
at multiple dose levels.  Taken together, this data support testing glasdegib as a combination 
therap y in patients with AML  and MDS for whom there are few effective therapeutic opt
ions 
for sustained responses.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Study B1371003: Phase 1b/2 Study in Patients with AML or High- Risk MDS
This is an open -label, multicenter safety  and efficacy  study  of glasdegib in combination with 
LDAC, decitabine, or intensive chemotherap y in patients with AML  or high -risk MDS. This 
study  includes two portions:
Phase 1b: To evaluate the safet y and RP2D determination of three first -line 
combination regimens of glasdegib plus: L DAC, decit abine, or ‘7+3’ induction 
chemotherap y (cytarabine/daunorubicin) .
Phase 2: To assess the efficacy of two combination regimens:
A Phase 2 randomized (2:1) open -label component in unfit patients (P2 Unfit) 
enrolled to receive either LDAC in combination with glasdegib or LDAC alone ;
A Phase 2 single arm component in fit patients (P2 Fit) to receive glasdegib in 
combination with 7+3 induction chemotherap y. Please refer to the glasdegib IB 
for further details on this part of the stud y.
Phase 1b Part
In the Phas e 1b part of Study  B1371003, 52 patients with AML  or higher risk MDS were
treated with glasdegib 100mg or 200 mg PO Qday in combination with LDAC (n=23),
decitabine (n=7), or 7 + 3(n=22).

dysgeusia (n = 6, 37.5%), stomatitis, headache, fatigue and py rexia (n = 5, 31.3% each), 
constipation, dyspepsia, vomiting, anaemia, neutropenia, white blood cell count decreased, 
hypocalcaemia, hy pokalaemia and alopecia (n = 4, 25% each). A DLT of Grade 
4polyneuropathy , later attributed to concomitant medication, was reported at the 
100mgdose level and treatment was permanentl y discontinued in that patient. 
Of the 45 AML patients treated in the entire Phase 1b cohort of Study  B1371003, 
1/20 treated patients in combination with LDAC responded (1 CR), 2/5 treated in 
combination with decitabine responded (1 CR, 1 complete response with incomplete blood 
count recovery  (CRi), and 11/20 treated patients in combination with 7 + 3responded

Page 71Phase 2 Randomized Combination Part (Phase 2 Unfit)
In the Phase 2 portion of Study  B1371003, a prospective, randomized (2:1), ope n-label 
clinical trial in 132 AML patients not suitable for intensive chemotherap y based on age or 
other risk factors, the addition of glasdegib 100 mg PO Qday  to LDAC vs LDAC alone 
resulted in a significant improvement in OS (median 8.8 months (80% CI :6.9, 9.9) vs 
4.9months (80% CI : 3.5, 6.0 ); HR 0.5
13 [80% CI : 0.394-0.666]; 1 -sided 
p-value=0.[ADDRESS_322701].  This benefit in OS was also consistent 
within prespecified subgroups and supported b y higher rates of complete remission in the 
LDAC + glasdegib arm (17% [80% CI : 11.9, 22.2] vs 2.3% [80% CI : 0.0, 5.2] ).  The 
addition of glasdegib to LDAC was well -tolerated, with 14 (16.7%) discontinuations due to 
adverse events. Thirteen of 84 (15%) patients were treated for at least 1 year (vs none in the 
LDAC alone arm). The median treatment duration was 
83days(range 3, 972 days) in the 
LDAC + glasdegib arm versus 47day s(range 6, 239 days) in the LDAC alone arm. 
The safet y profile was consistent with that in elderly  AML patients receiv ing chemotherap y, 
namely  cytopenias and gastrointestinal (GI)side effects, and had the safet y/tolerability  
profile of other marketed SMO inhibitors.  I n the LDAC + glasdegib arm, serious adverse 
events ( SAE s) of febrile neutropenia, occurred more frequent ly (28.6%) than in the LDAC 
alone arm (19.5%); however, frequencies of pneumonias were similar between treatment 
arms (21.4% in the LDAC + glasdegib arm and 17.1% in the LDAC alone arm), and sepsis 
rates were lower in the LDAC + glasdegib arm (3.6% in the LDAC + glasdegib arm and 
12.2% in the LDAC alone arm). The most common AEs in the LDAC + glasdegib arm were 
cytopenias and GI events, consistent with that in elderly  AM L patients receiving 
chemotherap y. Cytopenias were not accompanied with higher rates o f infections or bleeding 
as compared to the LDAC alone arm. QTcF prolongation >500 msec (Grade 3) was less 
frequent in the LDAC + glasdegib arm (6%) than in the L DAC alone arm (11.8%). SMO 
inhibitor -associated AEs in the L DAC + glasdegib arm included dy sgeusia (25%), muscle 
spasms (21.4%) and alopecia (10.7%). In the LDAC + glasdegib arm 28 (33%) patients were 
permanentl y discontinued due to AEs vs 20 (49%) patients in the LDAC alone arm, mostly  
for disease progression or infection. The most common caus e of death was disease 
progression in both treatment arms. 
The safet y profile and magnitude of improvement in OS appeared to be consistent with that 
in other ongoing single -arm studies of glasdegib as monotherapy  or in combination with 
other chemotherapie s in other MDS and AML populations.

Azacitidine (VIDAZA®) is a chemical analogue of the cy tosine nucleoside whose mechanism 
of action involves inhibition of DNA meth yltransferase at low doses, causing 
hypomethy lation of DNA, and direct cy totoxicit y in abnormal hematopoietic cells in the 
bone marrow through its incorporation into DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA) at high doses, 
resulting in cell death.  Azacitidine was approved by  [CONTACT_34033] 2004 for the treatment of all 
subty pes of MDS according to the FAB classif ication.  Azacitidine was approved in the EU 
in 2009 for the treatment of adult patients who are not eligible for hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation with intermediate -2and High -Risk MDS (per IPSS), CMML with 
10-29% bone marrow blasts without my elopro liferative disorder and AML with 
20-30% blasts and multi -lineage d ysplasia . In 2015, the EU expanded the approval of 
azacitidine in AML  to include adult patients aged [ADDRESS_322705] with >30% myeloblasts according to the W HO classification.

1.2.17. Rationale for Testing Glasdegib in Combination with Azacitidine in Patients 
with Previously Untreated Higher -Risk MDS, AML, and CMML
The combination of glasdegib with azacitidine is proposed for testing in this therapeutic 
setting based on:
Clinical and pre -clinical data suggesting a role for aberrant Hh pathway  activation in 
MDS, AML  and CMML (See Section 1.2.2 and1.2.3 );
Non-clinical data demonstrating that glasdegib limits L SC proliferation and evidence 
of glasdegib synergy with chemotherap y (See Section 1.2.2);
The acceptable safet y, tolerability  and pharmacokinetic profile observed for 
glasdegib in clinical studies in patients with hematological malignancie s both as a 
single agent and in combination with decitabine and azacitidine (see Section 1.2.6);
The clinical activity  observed following single -agent and combination treatment with 
glasdegib in patients with select hematological malignancies (see Section 
1.2.6);
The glasdegib pharmacody namic data for Hh pathway  inhibition obtained in 
surrogate tissues from a limited number of pati
ents (n=18) with select hematological 
malignancies and advanced solid tumors (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).

Page 74The above data along with the high unmet medical need for more effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (higher 
response rates and hematologic improvement that translate into survival benefit) for patients 
with higher- risk MDS, AML , and CMML, support the evaluation of glasdegib in 
combination with azacitidine in this population.
1.2.18. R ationale for the Starting Dose of Gladegib
As reported in Section [IP_ADDRESS], the B1371001 study  identified the MTD for single -agent 
glasdegib continuous administration as 400 mg QD, and the RP2D as 200 mg QD in patients 
with selec t hematologic malignancies. 
Subsequent evaluation of potential dose levels for further studies in patients with 
hematologic malignancies suggested the 100 mg QD dose level (MTD 
-4) as the optimal 
starting dose of single agent glasdegib .  This was supporte d by [CONTACT_243244]:
Clinical benefit observed in 16 patients in the B1371001 study  (including some with a 
diagnosis MDS and CMML ) with doses of glasdegib as low as [ADDRESS_322707] frequency  of responses being observed at 80 mg QD; 
GLI1 (abiomarker of Hh pathway  signaling activation) expression is down regulated 
by 80% at doses of 50 mg QD and higher in surrogate (skin) tissue, suggesting there 
will be adequate target modulation at the 100 mg QD dose;
Potential for increase in glasdegib p lasma exposures in the presence of a strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitor (s) (~140% increase in AUC infand a 40% increase in the C max) 
such as azoles which are medically  necessary  for management of infections in AML  
patients.
Taking into consideration the observed clin ical activity , safet y and tolerability
 profile, 
modulation of hedgehog pathway  activity  in surrogate tissue, and information relating 
to the possible impact of a CYP3A4 inhibitor, a dose of 100 mg QD was chosen as 
the appropriate glasdegib starting dose fo r further clinical studies both as a single 
agent and in combination. In the randomized Phase 2 portion of Study  
B1371003 (Section [IP_ADDRESS]), clincal benefit was demonstrated with LDAC ± 
glasdegib (
100mg Qday continuously in [ADDRESS_322708] line AML  patients. The m OSwas 
8.8months (80% CI: 6.9, 9.9) vs. 4.9 months (80% CI : 3.5, 6.0) for LDAC alone, 
with a hazard ratio of 0.5 13[80% CI : 0.394-0.666]. The safet y profile of glasdegib +
LDAC was gen erally tolerable and manageable.
In the single arm Phase 2 portion of Study  B1371003 (Section [IP_ADDRESS]), for older 
AML  pts receiving intensive chemotherapy
, the mOS stratified by  [CONTACT_265347]. The combination of glasdegib with ‘7+3’ was 
well-tolerated, with a safety  profile consistent with that typi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y seen in AML  
patients receiving standard intensive chemotherapy .
These data provide sadditional rationale for the100mg QD dose of glasdegib being a safe 
and potentially  clinically  effective dose in combination with azacitadine.

Page 751.2.19. Assessment of the Drug -Drug Interaction (DDI) Potential between 
Glasdegib and Azacitidine
Glasdegib has been shown to be extensivel y metabo lized by  [CONTACT_097]3A4 (99.8%) using human 
liver microsomes and hepatocy tes.  For azacitidine, the exact route of elimination and 
metabolic fate is not known in humans.  One of the pathways of elimination for azacitidine 
appears to be deamination by  [CONTACT_265348], the intestinal epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], and whole blood (Vidaza® USpackage insert ).  The 
potential for a DDI was considered to be low for the glasdegib and azacitidine, as enzy me 
systems other than CYP3A may be involved in the metabolism of azacitidine.  However, 
since this was a combination setting for dosing of glasdegib and azacitadine ,a DDI 
assessment was conducted in twelve subjects as part of the safety  LIC.  Based on preliminary  
PKresults, there was no evidence of changes in the PKs of either glasdegib or azacitadine 
when dosed in combination as compared to single agent dosing.
1.2.20. Summary of Benefit -Risk Assessment
An evaluation of the anticipated risks and benefits of treatment with glasdegib in the defined 
patient population as required in Article 3(2)(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC (cf. Article 6(3)(b) 
of Directive 2001/20/EC) has been conducted.
Based on the available clinical data, the safet y profile of glasdegib as a single agent and in 
combination administered orally  on a once daily  continuous dosing regimen is characterized 
by [CONTACT_265349] y.  The key observed toxicities are: muscle spasms, dysgeusia, decreased appeti te, and 
alopecia. 
Small but significant increases in the QTc interval have been reported in non-
clinical studies 
with glasdegib . Across the clinical program at glasdegib doses of 100 mg QD, cases of 
QTcF prolongation >500 msec or change in QTcF >[ADDRESS_322709] been 
reported, generally  in settings of multiple confounders; causal relationship could not be 
determined. Specific dosing modification and additional monitoring may  apply in case of 
prolonged QTcF (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] andTable 14). Concomitant administration of 
glasdegib with moderate/strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors ( Appendix 6andAppendix 7) and 
drugs with known risk of Torsade de Pointes (TdP) 
(Appendix 5) is not recommended due to 
the potential for DDI to prolong the QTc interval.
In a thorough QT 
(TQT) study  (Study  B1371023), a large effect (> 20 msec, the threshold of 
clinical concern for cancer drugs) of glasdegib on the QTc interval was not demonstrated at 
therapeutic (exposure equivalent to 100 mg QD ) and supratherapeutic (exposure equivalent 
to 200 mg QD) doses.  The largest mean QTc inte rval change at an y time point following the 
therapeutic dose was 8.03 msec.  The upper bound of the 2-sided 90% CIs for all 
time-matched least squares (L S) mean differences between glasdegib and placebo was below 
20msec (the maximum 90% CI  upper bound was 15.6 msec at the supratherapeutic dose) .  
Based on PK- PD anal ysis in cancer patients, there was no observed relationship between 
glasdegib concentration and heart rate.  The predicted mean change in QT interval corrected 
for heart rate using Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) from baseline was 5.30 msec (95% CI: 4.40, 
6.24) at the mean C maxat the therapeutic dose of 100 mg QD, and 12.1 msec (95% CI: 10.0,

Treatment will be administere d in 28- day cycles.  Glasdegib will be administered at the 
starting dose of 100 mg orally  once/day  and continuously  in combination with azacitidine.
Safety  Lead-In Cohort
The safety lead -in cohort has been completed .
All patients will be administered glasdegib, 100 mg orally  once/day  and continuously ;
Azacitidine will be administered SC at the starting dose of 75 mg/m2/day on a 
continuous schedule from Day  1to Day  7of each cy cle (Schedule 1).   Patients with 
>30% BM blasts OR a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_265317] e in the proportion of BM blasts at 
any point during the course of treatment must discontinue the study  drug combination 
and enter follow up.
Expansion
All patients will be administered glasdegib 100mg orally  once dailyand 
continuously ;
Azacitidine will be administered per local label or per the Investigational Product 
Manual (or SPC).  Azacitidine may  be administered by  [CONTACT_265337] 75 mg/m2/day for [ADDRESS_322719] 6 cycles of study  treatment the patient SHOULD NOT be 
withdrawn from study treatment if, in the Investigator’s judgme nt, the patient is still likely  to 
receive clinical benefit.   Treatment with the stud y drug combination should be continued 
beyond [ADDRESS_322720]. Treatment should also be continued 
beyond 6 cycles if patients demonstrate reasonable evidence of clinical benefit, defined as HI 
or better in patients enrolled into the safet y LIC, SD + HI or better in MDS patients enrolled 
to the expan sion, and not meeting the criteria for disease progression for AML  patients 
enrolled into the expansion.
If glasdegib is permanently  discontinued for reasons other than objective disease progression, 
patient refusal, or consent withdrawal, single- agent tre atment with azacitidine may  be 
continued if, in the Investigator’s judgment, a clinical benefit has been observed and 
following discussion between the Investigator and Sponsor.
PF-[ADDRESS_322721] be withdrawn from study 
drug combination and entered into the follow-up phase.
When study treatment with both drugs (glasdegib and azacitidine) is permanently 
discontinued, patients will enter into the follow-up phase. Patients receiving at least one dose of study treatment will be followed up for survival for up to [ADDRESS_322722] 4 weeks following the BM evaluation by [CONTACT_265351], an additional bone marrow confirmatory specimen is not required (applies to all patients in the safety LIC and only MDS patients in the expansion component).
  Transfusional support (red blood cells and 
platelets) will also be recorded.  Timely and complete (bone marrow AND peripheral blood counts) disease assessments at screening and during the study, whenever clinically indicated,are essential.  Failure to perform any of the required disease assessments will result in the inability to determine disease status for that time point and may weaken the conclusions of the study.
Safety assessments (laboratory, instrumental and clinical) and PK assessments will be 
performed regularly during the active treatment period in both components of the study.
DDI assessments were performed in the safety LIC only.
Please refer to the Schedule of Activities for the Safety Lead-in Cohort and the Schedule of 
Activities for the Expansion: MDS and AML Patients for a complete list of assessments to be 
performed on patients in the study.

4.3.Lifestyle Guidelines
In this stud y, male subjects who are able to father children and female subjects who are of 
childbearing po tential will receive azacitidine, a compound that has been shown to cause 
congenital malformations in animals and glasdegib, a compound which has been associated 
with teratogenic risk.   Subjects who are, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], sexually  active 
and at risk for pregnancy with their partner(s) must agree to use at 
least 1highly  effective 
PF-[ADDRESS_322733] and his/her partner(s) from 
the list of permitted contraception methods (see below) and will confirm that the subject has 
been instructed in their consistent and correct use.  At time points indicated in the
Table 3Schedule of Activities fo r the Expansion: MDS and AML  Patients , the investigator 
or designee will inform the subject of the need to use at least [ADDRESS_322734]’s 
affirmation, in the subject’s chart.  In addition, the investigator or designee will instruct the 
subject to call immediately  if the selected contraception method is disconti nued or if 
pregnancy  is known or suspected in the 
subject or partner(s). 
Highly  effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a 
failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently  and correctly  (ie, perfect use) and 
include the methods described in Table 11.

Sponsor’s Qualified Medical Personnel
The contact [CONTACT_1133]'s appropriately qualified medical personnel for the 
study  is documented in the study  contact [CONTACT_265352].
To facilitate ac cess to appropriatel y qualified medical personnel on stud y-related medical 
questions or problems, patients are provided with a contact [CONTACT_1137].  The contact [CONTACT_4662], 
at a minimum, protocol and investigational compound identifiers, patient study  numbers,
contact [CONTACT_4663], and contact [CONTACT_4664] a help desk in the 
event that the investigational site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical 
question or problem originating from another healthcare professional no t involved in the 
patient’s participation in the study.  The help desk number can also be used by  [CONTACT_134972]; however, it should only  be 
used in the event that the established communica tion pathway s between the investigational 
site and the study  team are not available.  It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace, 
the established communication pathway s between the investigational site and the study  team 
for advice on medical que stions or problems that may  arise during the study .  The help desk 
number is not intended for use b y the patient directly, and if a patient calls that number, he or 
she will be directed back to the investigational site.
5.STUDY TREATMENTS
5.1.Allocation to Treat ment
5.1.1. Safety Lead -In Cohort and Expansion
During both components of the study
, allocation of patients to treatment groups will proceed 
through the use of an Interactive Response Technology (IRT)System [Interactive Web 
Response (I WR)/Interactive Voice Respo nse (IVR)].  The site personnel (study  coordinator 
or specified designee) will be required to enter or select information including but not limited 
to the user’s identification (ID) and password, protocol number and the date of birth of the 
patient.  The site personnel will then be provided with a treatment assignment and 
dispensable unit (DU) or container number when drug is being supplied via the I RT.  The 
IRT s ystem will provide a confirmation report containing the patient number and DU or 
container numb er assigned. The confirmation report must be stored in the site’s files.
There is a [ADDRESS_322736] information and furthe r 
details on the use of the IRT.  Note: The I RT is the source of the patient number.  The IRT 
system will provide the patient number at the end of the first IRT patient transaction.
In the Safet y LICand expansion, allocation to treatment will occur in an open label fashion. 
PF-[ADDRESS_322737] is preferred but it does not preclude the use of an existing app ropriate clinical site 
documentation sy stem.  The existing clinical site's documentation sy stem should capture all 
pertinent/required information on the preparation and administration of the dose including 
the methodology  used to calculate the patient body surface area.  This may be used in place 
of the Preparation Record after approval from the Sponsor.
5.3.Drug Supplies
5.3.1. Formulation and Packaging
5.3.2. Glasdegib
Glasdegib will be supplied by  [CONTACT_265353] 25 mg and 
100mg tablets for o ral administration .  Supplies will be labeled according to local regulatory  
requirements.
Glasdegib will be packaged in high
-density  polyethylene (HDPE) bottles and should be 
handled with care.  Each bottle will contain enough medication for a [ADDRESS_322738] should be dispensed b y an appropriatel y qualified and experienced 
member of the stud y staff (eg, ph ysician, nurse, phy sician ’s assistant, practitioner, or 
pharmacist) as allowed by  [CONTACT_5737], state, and institutional guidance.
5.3.3. Azacitidine
Azacitidine 25 mg/mL  powder for suspension for injection will be used in this study .  Please 
refer to the local package insert (or SPC) or the investigational product manual for detailed 
formulation, preparation and IV and SC administration instructions.
Only  qualified personnel who are familiar with procedures that minimize undue exposure to 
them and to the environment should undertake the preparation, handling, and safe disposal of 
chemotherapeutic agents.
PF-[ADDRESS_322739] to confirm that the patient adequately understands the dosing instructions.
Glasdegib will be self- administered by  [CONTACT_44126], unless otherwise specified.  
Glasdegib will be administered orall y with approximately  8 ounces (240 mL) of water and 
should be taken in the morning, at the same time each day .  Tablets must not be crushed or 
cut; they  must be swallowed whole, not manipulated or not chewed prior to swallowing.  
Patients should be instructed to self- administer their medication in the morning at 
approximatel y the same time each day and to not take more than the prescribed dose at an y 
time.  If a patient forget s to take their dose at the regularl y scheduled time, and if less than 
10hours have passed since the scheduled dosing time, that dose should be taken as soon as 
possible.  I f more than [ADDRESS_322740] passed since the scheduled dosing time, the dose should 
be skipped and the patient should continue on their normal dosing schedule.  If a patient 
misses a day ’s dose entirely , they  must be instructed not to “make it up” the next day .  If a 
patient vomits any  time after taking a dose, they  must be instructed not to “make it up,” but 
to resume subsequent doses the next day  as prescribed.  If a patient inadvertently  takes 
1extra dose during a day, the patient should not take the next dose of glasdegib .  The patient 
will be reminded NOT to take their dose at home o n clinic day s but to bring their bottle(s) 
and patient dosing diary  into clinic so that glasdegib may be administered there .
Patients requiring glasdegib dose reduction(s) will be administered multiples of 25 mg tablets 
and should continue taking the glasdegib at the same time each morning at the dose 
prescribed b y the Investigator ( ie, 75 mg QD and 50 mg QD in the form of three or two 
25 mg tablets respectively ).  In situations where clinical benefit is observed, glasdegib can be 
reduced below 50 mg QD up on Sponsor approval. 
Dose modifications are discussed in Section 5.4.5.
5.4.2. Safety Lead -In Cohort
The safety lead -in cohort has been completed.
Azacitidine will be administered SC daily  at a dose of 75 mg/m2/day on Day s

discontinue the study  drug combination and enter follow -
up.
Treatment with the stud y drug combination should be continu ed bey ond [ADDRESS_322742]. Treatment should also be continued bey ond 6 cycles if patients 
demonstrate reasonable evidence of clin ical benefit, defined as HI or better in patients 
enrolled into the safet y LIC, SD + HI or better in MDS patients enrolled to the expansion, 
and not meeting the criteria for disease progression for AML patients enrolled into the 
expansion.
If glasdegib is permanently  discontinued for reasons other than objective disease progression, 
patient refusal, or consent withdrawal, single- agent treatment with azacitidine may  be 
continued if, in the Investigator’s judgment, a clinical benefit has been observed and 
following discussion between the Investigator and Sponsor.
In cases of unacceptable toxicity  or pregnancy , the patient must be withdrawn from study  
drug combination and entered into the follow -up phase of the study .
When study  treatment with both drugs ( glasdegib and azacitidine) is permanently  
discontinued, patients will enter into the follow- up phase.
PF-[ADDRESS_322743] be interrupted, delay ed and/or reduced as 
outlined below.  I n the event of multiple toxicities, dose modification should be based on the 
worst toxicity  observed.  Patient s must be instructed to notify  investigators at the first 
occurre nce of an y adverse sy mptom/s.
Dose modifications may  occur in three way s:
Within a cycle :Dosing interruption until adequate recovery  followed by  [CONTACT_147842] (if required) of glasdegib during a given treatment cy cle. 
Between cycles :The next treatment cycle may  be delay ed if toxicit y from the 
preceding cy cle persists.
In the next cycle : Dose reduction may  be required based on toxicities experienced in 
the previous cy cle.
A cycle is determined b y the azacitidine administration schedule.  A cycle is 28 days, but will 
be extended if there are dose delay s or modifications for azacitidine.  Azacitidine
administration should not be interrupted if glasdegib dosing is interrupted for toxicity .
If start of 
glasdegib administration in the next cy cle is delay ed due to toxicities potentially  
attributable to glasdegib , azacitidine administration should not be delay ed, and the day  when 
azacitidine administration occurs will be counted as Day  1of the next cy cle for both study  
drugs.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Glasdegib
Glasdegib does not need to be delay ed or dose reduced for hematologic toxicity  deemed 
unrelated/unlikel y related t o glasdegib by  [CONTACT_737] .
Patients experiencing Grade [ADDRESS_322744] their 
glasdegib treatment interrupted regardless of when it occurs in 
the cy cle until the toxicity  resolves or returns to baseline or <Grade 1, as described in 
Table 13. If these parameters have not been met following >28 consecutive day s of dose 
interruption, glasdegib should be permanentl y discontinued.  If glasdegib treatment is 
permane ntly discontinued, patients may continue single agent treatment with azacitidine, if 
according to the investigator’s judgment a clinical benefit has been observed, a nd following 
discussion between the investigator and the sponsor.
Appropriate follow
-up assessments should be implemented until adequate recovery  (toxicity  
resolves or returns to baseline) occurs. 
Depending on when the adverse event resolved, treatment in terruption may  lead to the patient 
missing all subsequent planned doses of glasdegib within the cy cle.  If the AE leading to 
PF-[ADDRESS_322745] return to the clinic to receive a new supply  of 
drug.   Glasdegib doses omitted for toxicity  will not be replaced within that cy cle (eg, cy cles 
will not be prolonged beyond the 28 days in order to make up for any missed 
glasdegib doses 
during that cy cle). 
Glasdegib may  be interrupted or permanently  discontinued for any  reason as per good 
clinical practice.   In the event of glasdegib treatment interruption for reasons other than 
treatment -related toxicit y (eg,elective surgery ) for a duration > 28days, the details of 
treatment resumption will be determined in consultation with the Sponsor.
Dose reduction of glasdegib by 1 or, if necessary , 2dose levels ( Table 12)will be allowed 
depen ding on the t ype and severit y of toxicity encountered .  NOTE : In the specific situations 
where clinical benefit is observed, glasdegib can be reduced below 50 mg QD upon Spons or 
approval.  All dose modifications/adjustments must be clearl y documented in th e patient's 
notes 
and case report form ( CRF ).
Once the glasdegib dose has been reduced, all subsequent cy cles should be administered at 
that dose level, unless further dose reduction is required.  Dose re -escalation is not allowed.   
Deviations from an y ofthe dose modifications must be discussed and agreed with the 
Sponsor Medical Monitor.

correctly  as required for proper storage o f investigational products.  These include 
thermometers for both the room storage and refrigerator storage.  An y temperature 
excursions should be reported to the sponsor.
The investigational product(s) must be stored as indicated.  Deviations from the stor age 
requirements, including any  actions taken, must be documented and reported to the sponsor.  
Once a deviation is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used 
until the sponsor provides documentation of permission to use the i nvestigational product.
Site sy stems must be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a 
minimum, daily  minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as 
applicable, including frozen, refrigerated and/or room tempe
rature products).  This should be 
captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout study .  Even for 
continuous monitoring sy stems, a log or site procedure which ensures active daily evaluation 
for excursions should be available.  The op eration of the temperature monitoring device and 
storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, should be regularl y inspected to ensure 
it is maintained in working order.
Any excursions from the product label storage conditions should be reported upon discovery .  
The site should activel y pursue options for returning the product to labeled storage 
conditions, as soon as possible.  Deviations from the storage requirements, including any 
actions taken, must be documented and reported to the sponsor.
Once a temperature excursion is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined 
and not used until the sponsor provides documentation of permission to use the 
investigational product.  Specific details regarding information the site should repo rt for each

7.ASSESSMENTS
Every  effort should be made to ensure that the protocol -required tests and procedures are 
completed as described.  However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may  be 
circumstances, outside of the control of the investigator, which may  make it unfeasible to 
perform the test.  In these cases the investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the 
safet y and well -being of the patient.  When a protoc ol-required test cannot be performed, the 
investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions that 
they have taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible.  The 
study  team must be informed of these incidents in a timely  manner.
7.1.Pregnancy Testing
For female patients of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy  test, with 
sensitivity  of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed on two occasions prior to starting study  
therap y -once at the start of screening and once at the baseline visit, immediately  before 
investigational product administration.  Following a negative pregnancy  result at screening, 
appropriate contraception (defined in Section 4.3) must be commenced and a further negative 
pregnancy  result will then be required at the baseline visit before the patient may  receive the 
investigational product.  Pregnancy  tests will also be routinely  repeated at every  cycle during 
the active treatment period, at the end of stud y treatment, and additionally  whenever one

drug combination and enter into the Follow -up phase.  Additional pregnancy tests may  also 
be undertaken if requested by  [CONTACT_128624] (IRBs)/Ethic Committees (ECs) or 
if required b y local regulations.
7.2.Adverse Events
Assessment of AEs will include the t ype, incidence, severit y (graded b y the NCI  CTCAE 
version 4.03) timing, seriousness, and relatedness.  Additional information regarding AE and 
Serious AE (SAE) reporting is provided in Section 8.
7.3.Laboratory Safety Assessments
Hematology , blood chemistry , coagulation and urinaly sis assessments will be drawn at the 
time points described in the Schedule of Activities for the Safet y Lead -inand the Schedule of 
Activities for the Expansion: MDS and AML  Patients and will be anal yzed by  [CONTACT_39722]/I nvestigator at local laboratories.  L aboratory  certifications and normal ranges with units 
must be provide d to the Sponsor.

response (applies to all patients in the safet y LIC and only  MDS patients in the expansion 
component) .  Hematology  tests may  be repeated also as clinically  indicated.
If blood chemistry  or coagulations are obtained wit hin 3 days of scheduled blood draw, the 
collection need not be repeated. 
If a urinal ysis was obtained within 3 days of the scheduled collection, it should not be 
repeated.  For urinal ysis, dipstick is acceptable.  Microscopic anal yses should be done if 
abnormal results (ie, the presence of protein or blood).
See Appendix 8for list of required tests. 
7.4.Transfusions
All red blood cell and platelet transfusions, including the date of each transfusion and 
number of 
red blood cell or platelet units transfused must be recorded while the patient is on 
treatment .  Transfusion histories for the [ADDRESS_322758] also be recorded in 
the CRF.  Note that the number of units (not the number of bags) must be reco rded.
7.5.Vital Signs and Physical Examination
Vital signs will include blood pressure and heart rate (to be recorded in sitting position).  
Patients will have a phy sical exam (PE) including an examination of major body  systems
(includes general appearance, head, neck, lungs, heart, abdomen, musculoskeletal, 
extremities, skin, ly mph nodes, neurological), measurement by  [CONTACT_265359], 
weight, height and assessment of ECOG status.  If PE obtained within [ADDRESS_322759] begins a ne w anticancer therapy , the recording period for non-serious AEs ends at 
the time the new treatment is started; however, SAEs must continue to be recorded on the 
CRF during the above -indicated active collection period.
Death must be reported if it occurs dur ing the SAE reporting period after the last dose of 
investigational product, irrespective of any intervening treatment.
8.3.Definition of an Adverse Event
An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a 
product or me dical device; the event need not necessarily  have a causal relationship with the 
treatment or usage.  Examples of AEs include but are not limited to: 
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant symptoms and signs;
Changes in phy sical examination findin gs;
Hypersensitivity ;
Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .
Additionally , they  may  include the signs or s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;
Drug withdrawal;
Drug misuse;
Drug interactions;
Extravasation;
Exposure during pregnancy  (EDP);
Exposure via breastfeedi ng;
Medication error;

8.4.Medication Errors
Medication errors may  result, in this study , from the administration or consumption of the 
wrong product, b y the wrong patient, at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength.  
Such medicat ion errors occurring to a study  participant are to be captured on the medication 
error case report form (CRF) which is a specific version of the adverse event (AE) page, and 
on the SAE form when appropriate.  In the event of medication dosing error, the sp onsor 
should be notified immediately .
Medication errors are reportable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE/SAE, 
including:
Medication errors involving patient exposure to the investigational product;
Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do 
or do not involve the participating patient.
Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by  [CONTACT_1149], as determined by  [CONTACT_1275], the medication error is captured on the medication error version of th e adverse 
event (AE) page and, if applicable, an y associated AE(s) are captured on an AE CRF page.
8.5.Abnormal Test Findings
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as 
an AE are as follows: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or
Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; 
and/or
Test result leads to a change in study  dosing or discontinuation from the study , 
significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therap y; and/or
Test result is considered to be an AE b y the investigator or sponsor.
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not 
constitute an AE.  An y abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require 
reporting as an AE.
PF-[ADDRESS_322760] medical occurrence at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions);
Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect.
Progression of the malignancy  under stud y (includi ng signs and sy mptoms of progression) 
should not be reported as an SAE unless the outcome is fatal within the safety  reporting 
period.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_196327].  If the malignancy  has a fatal outcome during the study or within the 
safet y reporting period, then the event leading to death must be recorded as an AE and as an 
SAE with CTCAE Grade 5(seeSection 8.8 on Severity  Assessment ).
Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. However, if it is determined that the event may  jeopardize 
the patient or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes the 
important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an eme rgency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
8.6.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events 
There are no protocol -specified SAEs in thi s study .  All cases of Grade >[ADDRESS_322761] dose of study  drug administered. All SAEs will be reported b y 
the investigator as described i n previous sections, and will be handled as SAEs in the safet y 
database (see the section on Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements).
8.6.2. Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury
Abnormal values in aspartate a minotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
levels concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria 
outlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury  are considered potential cases of 
drug-induced liver injury (potential Hy ’s law cases) and should alway s be considered 
important medical events.

Page 121The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential case of drug- induced liver injury  
depends on the patient’s individual baseline values and under lying conditions.  Patients who 
present with the following laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further to 
definitively  determine the etiology  of the abnormal laboratory values:
Patients with AST or ALT and total bilirubin baseline values within th e normal range 
who subsequently  present with AST or AL T values 3times the upper limit of 
normal (X ULN) concurrent with a total bilirubin value 2X ULN with no evidence 
of hemoly sis and an alkaline phosphatase value  2X ULN or not available .
For patients with preexisting AL T OR AST OR total bilirubin values above the ULN, 
the following threshold values should be used in the definition mentioned above:
For patients with preexisting AST or AL T baseline values above the normal 
range: AST or ALT values 
2 times the baseline values and [ADDRESS_322762], or 
[ADDRESS_322763] (whichever is smaller).
Concurrent with
For patients with preexisting values of total bilirubin above the normal range: 
Total bilirubin level increased from baseline b y an amount of at least [ADDRESS_322764] or
if the value reaches ≥3X ULN (whichever is smaller).
The patient should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results.  This evaluation should 
include laboratory  tests, detailed history , and physical assessment.  The possibility  of hepatic 
neoplasia (primary  or secondary ) should be considered. 
In addition to repeating measurements of AST and AL T, laboratory  tests should include 
albumin, creatine kinase, total bilirub in, direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutamyl 
transferase, prothrombin time (PT)/ international normalized ratio (INR), and alkaline 
phosphatase.  A detailed history , including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, 
acetaminophen , recreationa l drug and supplement consumption, family  history , occupational 
exposure, sexual history , travel history , history  of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person, surgery , 
blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and work exposure, should be collected. 
Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary  tract) 
may be warranted.  All cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria 
defined above, with no other cause for liver function test (L FT) abn ormalities identified at 
the time, should be considered potential Hy ’s law cases irrespective of availability  of all the 
results of the investigations performed to determine etiology  of the abnormal L FTs.  Such 
potential Hy ’s law cases should be reported as SAEs.
A potential Hy’s law case becomes a confirmed case only  after all results of reasonable 
investigations have excluded an alternative etiology .

includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care unit (eg, from the psy chiatric 
wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary  care unit , or neurological floor to a 
tuberculosis unit).  An emergency  room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
however, the event leading to the emergency  room visit should be assessed for medical 
importance.

Page 123Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not 
be reported as AEs.  Ho wever, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed 
should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE.  For example, an acute appendicitis 
that begins during the AE reporting period should be reported as the AE and the resulting 
appende ctomy  should be recorded as treatment of the AE.
8.8.Severity Assessment
AEs will be reported using concise medical terminology  (verbatim) as well as the Common 
Terminology  Criteria (CTC) term for Adverse Events (Version 4.03, Publish Date: June 14, 
2010, http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html)) listed in the Cancer Therapy Evaluation 
Program.
The investigator may  use the following definitions of Severit y in accordance with CTCAE 
Version 4.03 to describe the maximum intensity  of the adverse event. 
GRADE Clinical Description of Severit y
0 No change from normal or reference range (this grade is not included in the 
Version 4.03 CTCAE document but may  be used in certain circumstances.)
1 MILD adverse event
2 MODERATE adverse event
3 SEVERE adverse event
4 L IFE-THREATENING consequences; urgent intervention indicated
5 DEATH RELATED TO adverse event
Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE.  A severe event is not 
necessarily  an SAE.  For example, a headache may  be severe (interf eres significantly  with 
the patient's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the 
criteria for SAEs, listed above.
8.9.Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and
non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as appropriate, 
and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements if 
applicable.  An investigator’s causality
 assessment is the determination of w hether there 
exists a reasonable possibility  that the investigational product caused or contributed to an 
AE; generally  the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be 
provided.  If the investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused 
the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting 
purposes, as defined b y the sponsor (see the section on Reporting Requirements ).  If the 
investigator's causalit y assessment is “unknown but not related to investigational product,” 
this should be clearl y documented on study records. 
PF-[ADDRESS_322765] this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, as 
appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting 
requirements, if applicable.
8.10. Exposure During Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products a nd for marketed products, an exposure during 
pregnancy  occurs if:
1. A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been 
exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational 
product; or the female becomes, or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or 
being exposed to the investigational product; 
An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact [CONTACT_4490] 
a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has 
been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
2.A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the 
investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed 
during his partner’ s pregnancy .
If a stud y patient or study patient’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the 
study  patient’s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must submit this 
information to the [COMPANY_007] drug safet y unit on a Serious A dverse Event (SAE) Report Form 
and Exposure During Pregnancy  (EDP) supplemental form, regardless of whether an SAE 
has occurred.  In addition, the investigator must submit information regarding environmental 
exposure to a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a patient reports that she is pregnant 
and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product by [CONTACT_4691][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) using the EDP 
supplemental form.  This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and 
within 24 hours of awareness of the expos ure.  The information submitted should include the 
anticipated date of delivery  (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until 
completion (or until pregnancy  termination) and notify  [COMPANY_007] of the outcome as a follow-up 
to the initial EDP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity  of the 
neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for 
termination should be specified and, if clinicall y possible, the structural integrity  of the 
terminated fetus should be assessed b y gross visual inspectio n (unless preprocedure test 
findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal dea th, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live-born bab y, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.

Final Protocol Amendment 7, 14June 2018
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 125Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion;
Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_322766]. 
Additional information regarding the exposure during pregnancy  may  be requested by  [CONTACT_1275].  Further follow -up of birth out comes will be handled on a case- by-case basis 
(eg, follow -up on preterm infants to identify  developmental delay s).  In the case of paternal 
exposure, the investigator will provide the study patient with the Pregnant Partner Release of 
Information Form to d eliver to his partner.  The investigator must document in the source 
documents that the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to 
provide to his partner.
8.11. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when during the perf ormance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_8898], which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an adverse event.
An occupational exposure is reported to the drug safet y uni t within 24 hours of the 
investigator’s awareness, using the SAE Report form, regardless of whether there is an 
associated AE/SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a patient enrolled in the study, 
the information is not reported on a Case Report Form (CRF), however a copy  of the 
completed SAE Report form is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.12. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events
Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, 
according to the definition of AE n oted earlier, and recorded on the appropriate AE CRF 
page.   When a patient withdraws because of an SAE, the SAE must be reported in 
accordance with the reporting requirements defined below.
8.13. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to report all directly  observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously  reported b y 
the study  patient/legall y acceptable representative.  I n addition, each study  patient/legally  
acceptable representative will be questioned about AEs.
8.14. Reporting Requirements
Each AE is to be as
sessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAEs.  If an SAE occurs, 
expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations, as appropriate.
PF-[ADDRESS_322767] be made 
immediately , irrespective of the extent of available AE information.  This time frame also 
applies to additio nal new information (follow- up) on previously  forwarded SAE reports as 
well as to the initial and follow- up reporting of exposure during pregnancy , exposure via 
breastfeeding and occupational exposure cases.
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE 
immediately  (eg, if an outpatient study  patient initially  seeks treatment elsewhere), the 
investigator is to report the event within [ADDRESS_322768] awareness of the AE.
For all SAEs, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information to [COMPANY_007] in 
accordance with the time frames for reporting specified above.  In addition, an investigator 
may be requested by  [CONTACT_265361].  This information collected for SAEs is more detailed than that captured 
on the AE CRF.  I n general, this will include a description of the AE in sufficient detail to 
allow for a complete medical assessment of th e case and independent determination of 
possible causality .  Information on other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant 
medications, vaccines, and/or illnesses, must be provided.  In the case of a patient death, a 
summary of available autopsy  findings must be submitted as soon as possible to [COMPANY_007] or its 
designated representative. 
8.14.2. Non-serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
All AEs will be reported on the AE page(s) of the CRF.  I t should be noted that the form for 
collection of SAE infor mation is not the same as the AE CRF.  Where the same data are 
collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For example, the same AE 
term should be used on both forms.  AEs should be reported using concise medical 
terminology  on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of SAE information.
8.14.3. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
AE reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions will be carried out in 
accordance with applicable local regulations .
9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS
A detailed methodolog y for summary  and statistical anal ysis of the data collected in this 
study  will be documented in a Statistical Analy sis Plan will be maintained by  [CONTACT_1034].  
The document may  modify  the plans outl ined in the protocol; however, any  major 
modifications of the primary  endpoint definition and/or its analy sis will also be reflected in a 
protocol amendment.

Page 1289.3.1. Complete Response
The pro portion of patients achieving CR is the primary  endpoint for the expansion cohorts.   
The endpoint of CR will be anal yzed when the endpoint is mature in the specific expansion 
cohort.
A confirmation of response (peripheral blood onl y) is required [ADDRESS_322769]
28
weeks (to allow for confirmation of response per I WG 2006). No confirmation is needed 
for the expansion AML cohort. The final ansl yses for the AML cohort will be performed 
after all patients in th is cohort have been followed for at least 24weeks.
The proportion and two -sided 95% CI of patients achieving CR will be p rovided separatel y 
for the two expansion cohorts.
9.3.2. Response Rate
The proportion of patients achieving response (CR+PR) is a secondary  endpoint for the 
safet y LIC.  A confirmation of response (Peripheral Blood only ) is required [ADDRESS_322770] been followed for 28 weeks (to allow for confirmation of response per IWG 
2006).  The proportion and two- sided 95% CI (using exact method) of patients achiev ing 
response (CR+PR) will be provided for the safety  LIC.
9.3.3. Overall Survival (Expansion)
Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from date of first stud y treatment to date of death 
due to an y cause.  Patients last known to be alive will be censored at t he date of last contact.
OS will be analy zed and display ed graphically  for each expansion cohort separately  using the 
Kaplan -Meier method.  The median event time for each expansion cohort and corresponding 
two-sided 95% CI will be provided.  The Kaplan -Meier estimate of survival probabilities at 
12, 18, and 24 months and their two- sided 95% CI (using log-log transformation and 
back -transformation) will be provided for each arm separatel y.
First, OS will be analy zed when the primary  endpoint of CR is analy zed in the respective 
expansion cohort.  A follow- up anal ysis of updated OS will be conducted when the study  
concludes. OS is defined as the date of the first dose of any  of the study  medications to the 
date of death from an y cause .
9.3.4. Duration of Response
Duration of Response (DoR) is only defined in MDS patients or AML  patients achieving a 
CR in the expansion component. DoR 
is defined as the duration from date of first achieving 
CR to the date of disease progression (relapse )after CR, or death due to an y cause.  Patients 
last known to be alive who are free from disease progression or relapse after CR are censored 
at the date of the last assessment that verifies their disease status.  The minimum DoR is 
4weeks for MDS patients by  [CONTACT_108] (CR must last at least 4 weeks to qualify  as such per 
Appendix 2).

Page 132In all summaries, emphasis will be placed on treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs), 
namely , those with initial onset or that worsen in severit y after the fi rst dose of study  drug.  
Adverse events will be summarized by  [CONTACT_265362] y systems and MedDRA preferred term and b y 
worst NCI  CTCAE (version 4.03) grade.  Summaries will also be provided of treatment 
related TEAEs, namel y, those judged b y the investigator to be related or likely related to 
study  drug. 
Adverse events leading to death or discontinuation of study  treatment, events classified as 
NCI CTCAE version 4.[ADDRESS_322771] toxicity  grade observed for each lab assay , graded according 
to NCI  CTCAE version 4.03.  The anal yseswill summarize laboratory tests both on the 
entire study  period and by  [CONTACT_5265] (C ycle 1and C ycles bey ond 1).  Shift tables will be provided 
to examine the distribution of laboratory  toxicities.
For laboratory  tests without CTC grade definitions, results wi ll be categorized as normal, 
abnormal or not done . 
9.4.5. Baseline Characteristics
Patient characteristics at the time of study  entry  will be summarized in frequency  tables and 
descriptive statistics will be provided for quantitative variables for the full analy sis set (see
Section 9.2 for definitions of study  populations).
9.4.6. Electrocardiogram Analysis
The QT measurements corrected b y heart rate (QTc) will be used for the data anal ysis and 
interpretati on.  QTcF is planned to be the primary  anal ysis method for the QTc endpoint.  In 
addition a study -specific correction method (QTcS) and QTcB may  also be evaluated for the 
QTc evaluable patients.  The most appropriate correction method that eliminates an y QT vs.  
RR relationship may  be chosen after review of the data.
9.4.7. Summary and Categorical Analysis of Electrocardiogram Findings
The anal ysis of ECG results will be based on patients with both baseline and on -treatment 
ECG data.  All ECGs obtained during the study  will be evaluated for safet y.  ECG collected 
prior to the first day  of dosing will be considered the baseline ECG.
ECG measurements (an average of the triplicate measurements) will be used for the 
statistical analysis and all data presentations.  Any data obtained from ECGs repeated for 
safet y reasons after the nominal time -points will not be averaged along with the preceding

PK and PD data from this study may be analyzed using modeling approaches and may also 
be pooled with data from other studies to investigate any causal relationship between glasdegib exposure and  significant safety endpoints.  The results of these analyses, if performed, may be reported separately.
9.7. Interim Analyses
9.7.1. Futility Analyses
A Bayesian decision rule ( Section 3.3 ) will be used to continuously monitor CR rate without 
holding enrollment in the expansion component to allow early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_265322]. The decision rule is to stop enrollment for a specific expansion cohort if the posterior probability of the CR rate in study treatment is no more than 0.2 higher than historical azacitidine is greater than 95% in an expansion cohort, ie, Pr (glasdegib+Aza response < historical Aza reponse + 0.2) >0.95. The prior distribution assumptions for the Bayesian model are as follow: for MDS cohort, we assume a prior distribution of Beta(1,6) for the study treatment (based on data from MDS patients accumulated in the safety LIC[1 out of 7 MDS patients achieved CR]), and a prior distribution of Beta(15,75) by [CONTACT_265363] (AZA 001 trial); for the AML cohort, a prior distribution of Beta(4,4) for the study treatment (based on pooled data on AML patients from the B1371003 study [1 out of 4 AML patients achieved CR] and the LIC [3 out of 4 AML patients achieved CR]), and a prior distribution of Beta(23.5,97) by [CONTACT_265363].
57The Multc Lean software (Version 2.1.0) developed by [CONTACT_265364] (https://biostatistics.mdanderson.org/softwaredownload/SingleSoftware.aspx?Software_Id=12), which properly models variability in historical control that is more often than not ignored. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_265323].
The Bayesian decision rule applies once the minimum number of patients (ie, 10) in each 
expansion cohort has achieved the required follow-up duration (ie, 28 weeks for the expansion MDS cohort and 24 weeks for the expansion AML cohort). The enrollment to the respective expansion cohort will be stopped if the minimum number of responders in that expansion cohort is not achieved ( Table 8 for expansion MDS cohort, and Table 9 for 
expansion AML cohort in Section 3.3) . For instance, if there are no more than [ADDRESS_322772] 70% probability that the toxicity rate of any of the pre-defined safety events of interest ( Section 3.3 ) in that cohort is above 25%.
The safety stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_265324] (AML or MDS) starting when 
at least [ADDRESS_322773] completed the required follow-up period (28/24 weeks for MDS/AML respectively) and applied continuously afterwards.  Enrollment will continue CCI

however, the two cohorts will be anal yzed independently .
9.8.Data Monitoring Committee
This study  will use an external data monitoring committee (EDMC).  The EDMC will be 
responsible for ongoing monitoring of the safet y of subjects in the study  according to the 
charter.  The recommendations made by  [CONTACT_265365].  [COMPANY_007] will forward such decisions, which may  include 
summaries of aggregate analyses of endpoint events and of safet y data that are not endpoints, 
to regulatory  authorities, as appropriate.  An EDMC will be convened to monitor safet y in 
the study  at least once per y ear. 
10.QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
During study  conduct, 
[COMPANY_007] or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure 
that the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs) are being followed.  The monitors may  
review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs are accurate.  The 
investigat or and institution will allow [COMPANY_007] monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate 
regulatory  authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.
The study  site may  be subject to review by  [CONTACT_21980] (IRB)/ethi cs 
committee (EC), and/or to quality  assurance audits performed b y [COMPANY_007], or companies 
working with or on behalf of [COMPANY_007], and/or to inspection by  [CONTACT_8901].
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel a re available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.
11.DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]
11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be unde rstood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study .
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included patient.  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole propert yof [COMPANY_007] and should not be made available in any  form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007] or appropriate regulatory  
authorities, without written permission from [COMPANY_007].
The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the co llection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source 
documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic / original, attributable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring and available when required.  The 
PF-[ADDRESS_322774] be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the 
original entry . 
In most cases, the source documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]'s or the ph ysician's patient chart.  In 
these cases data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those c harts. 
In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may  also serve as source documents.  In these 
cases, a document should be available at the investigator’s site as well as at [COMPANY_007] and clearl y 
identify  those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and fo r which the CRF will stand as the 
source document.
11.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory  authorities or [COMPANY_007], the investigator 
agrees to keep records, including the identity  of all participating patients (sufficient 
informa tion to link records, eg, CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed informed 
consent/assentdocuments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], safety  reporting forms, source documents, and 
detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant 
correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, and telephone call reports).  The records should 
be retained b y the investigator according to International Conference on Harmonization 
(ICH), according to local regulations, or as specified in the clinical study  agreement (CSA), 
whichever is longer.
If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period (eg, retirement, relocation), [COMPANY_007] should be prospectivel y notified.  The 
study  records must be transfe rred to a designee acceptable to [COMPANY_007], such as another 
investigator, another institution, or an independent third party  arranged by  [CONTACT_4618].  
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of [ADDRESS_322775] obtain [COMPANY_007]'s written permission before disposing of an y records, 
even if retention requirements have been met.
12.ETHICS
12.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC)
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent/assent documents, and other relevant documents, eg, 
recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/EC.  All corre spondence with the 
IRB/EC should be retained in the investigator file.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1309] I RB/EC approvals should be 
forwarded to [COMPANY_007].

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 138The only  circumstance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to elim inate apparent immediate hazards to the patients.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/EC and [COMPANY_007] in writing immediately  after 
the implementation.
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with legal and regu latory  requirements, as well as 
the general principles set forth in the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical 
Research Involving Human Patients (Council for International Organizations of Medical 
Sciences 2002), Guidelines for Good Clinical Pract ive (GCP )(ICH 1996), and the 
Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association 1996 & 2008).
In addition, the study  will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, the I CH guideline 
on GCP, and applicable local regulatory  requirements and laws.
12.3. Patie nt Information and Consent
All parties will ensure protection of patient personal data and will not include patient names 
or other identifiable data in any  reports, publications or other disclosures, except where 
required b y laws. 
When study  data is compi [INVESTIGATOR_47581], patient 
names, address, birth date and other identifiable data will be replaced b y a numerical code 
consisting of a numbering sy stem provided b y [COMPANY_007] in order to de -identify  the study  patient.   
Thestudy  site will maintain a confidential list of patients who participated in the study  
linking their numerical code to the patient’s actual identity .  In case of data transfer, [COMPANY_007] 
will maintain high standards of confidentialit y and protection of patie nt personal data 
consistent with applicable privacy  laws.
The informed consent/assent document must be in compliance with ICH GCP, local 
regulatory  requirements, and legal requirements including applicable privacy  laws.
The informed consent/assent document
(s) used during the informed consent process must be 
reviewed b y the sponsor, approved b y the IRB/EC before use, and available for inspection.
The investigator must ensure that each study  patient, or his or her legall y acceptable 
representative, is fully informed about the nature and objectives of the study  and possible 
risks associated with participation.
Whenever consent is obtained from a patient’s legally  acceptable representative, the patient’s 
assent (affirmative agreement) must subsequently be obta ined when the patient has the 
capacity  to provide assent, as determined by  [CONTACT_1201]/EC.  If the investigator determines that 
a patient’s decisional capacity is so limited he/she cannot reasonabl y be consulted, as 
permitted by  [CONTACT_1201]/EC and consistent with local regulatory  and legal requirements, then 
the patient’s assent may  be waived with source documentation of the reason assent was not 
obtained.  If the stud y patient does not provide his/her own consent, the source documents 
must record wh y the patient did not provide consent (eg, minor, decisionally  impaired adult),

Page 139how the investigator determined that the person signing the consent was the patient’s legall y 
acceptable representative, the consent signer’s relationship to the study  patient (eg, parent, 
spouse) and that the patient’s assent was obtained, or waived.  If assent is obtained verball y it 
must be documented in the source documents.
The investigator, or a person designated b y the investigator, will obtain written informed 
consent from each patient or the patient's legally  acceptable representative before any  
study -specific activity  is performed unless a waiver of informed consent has been granted by  
[CONTACT_2717]/EC.  The investigator will retain the original of each patient's signed consent/assent 
docume nt.
12.4. Patient Recruitment
Advertisements approved by  [CONTACT_36553]. 
12.5. Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP
In the event of any prohibition or restrictio n imposed (ie, clinical hold) b y an applicable 
competent authorit y in any area of the world, or if the investigator is aware of an y new 
information that might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the investigational

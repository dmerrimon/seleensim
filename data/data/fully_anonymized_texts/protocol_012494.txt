TITLE OF STUDY: 
A Phase 3, Open-Label, Randomized, Parallel, 2-Arm, Multi-Center Study of Talazoparib (BMN 673)
versus Physician’s Choice in Germline BRCA Mutation Subjects with Locally Advanced and/or

PROTOCOL NUMBER :
673-301
STUDY SITES:
This study will be conducted at approximately 230 sites internationally in 16 countries ([LOCATION_002], 
Brazil, Russia, Spain, [LOCATION_008], Israel, Australia, [LOCATION_009], [LOCATION_013], Italy, Belgium, Ireland, 
South Korea, Poland, Taiwan, Ukraine). Additional countries and sites may be added. 
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT:
Phase 3
STUDY RATIONALE:The mutation that predisposes breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) mutation carriers to cancer 
formation selectively renders tumor cells susceptible to poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) 
inhibition while sparing normal cells that, possessing a normal BRCA allele, are relatively resistant to 
PARP inhibition.
The selection of appropriate therapy for metastatic breast cancer is complex because of the many 
treatment options and biologic heterogeneity of the disease, including several that have led to development of targeted therapeutics. Among others, the potential treatment options are influenced by 
[CONTACT_187622][INVESTIGATOR_3506] 2 (HER2) status of 
the tumor. Treatment options for subjects presenting with metastatic breast cancer may also be 
influenced by [CONTACT_187623], how soon after adjuvant therapy the subject relapses, 
and by [CONTACT_187624]. 
No therapi[INVESTIGATOR_187603]-defined vulnerability of 
BRCA mutant tumors. It would be a significant advance to provide a therapy which exploits the vulnerability of BRCA-mutant bearing tumors while sparing normal cells carrying one healthy BRCA 
allele.

with the mixed data from small retrospective studies, underscores the lack of information for making treatment decisions for these subjects. The potential role of BRCA1 in mediation of taxane 
cytotoxicity is consistent with the observation that the taxanes may be less effective in treatment of 
BRCA1-associated metastatic breast cancer than sporadic disease. 
This coupled with the potential to specifically target the underlying genetic abnormality of the disease 
highlights the unmet need as well as the need for prospective evaluation of a molecularly rational, 
targeted therapy in comparison to the standard drugs used. While several agents have been shown to 
prolong progression-free survival (PFS) and some have modestly improved survival in metastatic 
breast cancer, the disease is, nevertheless, nearly uniformly fatal. Moreover, standard, non-targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_187604], which limits the quality of life of subjects while they 
are undergoing treatment.
Two studies of the PARP inhibitor, olaparib, given as a single agent to breast cancer subjects have 
been published. In one study, subjects with germline BRCA mutations were treated with either 400 mg 
twice daily or 100 mg twice daily in a non-randomized fashion. Eleven of 27 subjects (41%) receiving the higher dose had objective responses while 6 of 27 (22%) of subjects receiving the lower dose 
responded .In a second trial, olaparib was evaluated in subjects with germline mutations as well as 
subjects with triple negative breast cancer in the absence of germline mutations. Ten subjects with 
germline mutations were enrolled, including [ADDRESS_221321] germline BRCA mutations or had unknown BRCA 
status.
In the Phase 1 study of talazoparib (also known as MDV3800, BMN 673), PRP-001, [ADDRESS_221322] cancer 
subjects with germline BRCA mutations, who had previously been treated with more than one 
chemotherapy regimen (range: 1 to 13), were enrolled during dose escalation (n=6) and expansion

OBJECTIVES: 
The primary objective of the study is to compare PFS of subjects treated with talazoparib as a 
monotherapy relative to those treated with protocol-specific physician’s choice.
The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the following:
!Objective response rate (ORR)
!Overall survival (OS)
!Safety
!Pharmacokinetics of talazoparib
The exploratory objectives are to evaluate the following:
!Duration of response (DOR) for objective responders 
!Quality of life for all enrolled subjects (European Organization for Research and Treatment of 
Cancer [EORTC] Quality of Life Questionnaire [QLC-C30]/ EORTC Quality of Life 
Questionnaire – Breast Cancer Module [QLQ-BR23])
!Research assessments related to blood and tumor sampling that includes characterization of 
tumor sensitivity and resistance to talazoparib
STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN: 
The study is an open-label, 2-arm, 2:1 randomized trial of talazoparib versus protocol-specific 
physician’s choice. Subjects with germline BRCA mutations who have received no more than 3 prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for locally advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer will be 
enrolled. Options for protocol-specific physician’s choice include one of the following single-agent 
chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]: 
!Capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, vinorelbine 
oThe protocol-specific physician’s choice must be determined prior to randomization 
for each individual subject. 
Subjects will be centrally randomized with stratification by [CONTACT_716]:

INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT(S), DOSE, ROUTE AND REGIMEN: 
Talazoparib will be administered orally once daily (ie, continuous dosing). Talazoparib should be 
taken at approximately the same time each day, preferably in the morning. Talazoparib will be 
swallowed whole, and may be taken with or without food. On days of clinic visits when PK samples are to be drawn, talazoparib should be taken at the clinic after completion of the pre-dose sampling and 
assessments.
The IP is talazoparib tosylate, a white to off-white crystalline powder. The drug substance is a 
4-methylbenzenesulfonate (tosylate) salt of talazoparib free base, the active moiety. The drug product 
consists of the drug substance formulated with a pharmaceutically suitable excipi[INVESTIGATOR_187606]. Capsules will be provided to the sites in dose strengths of 
0.25 mg and 1.0 mg capsules. The dosage strengths are based on the active moiety (talazoparib free 
base). The capsules for each dose strength are provided in dose-specific colors to provide a visual 
method of distinguishing dose strengths. 
Talazoparib should be stored at room temperature (15 to 30°C; 59 to 86°F). The capsules are supplied 
in 30-count induction-sealed high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles. 
Daily dosing of talazoparib can be interrupted for recovery from toxicity for up to [ADDRESS_221340] be made based on observed toxicity as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
DURATION OF TREATMENT: 
Subjects are eligible to receive treatment until radiographic disease progression as determined by [CONTACT_187631], occurrence of unacceptable toxicity, subject or physician decision to stop treatment, or until the study is terminated by [CONTACT_1034]. 090177e18f003b15\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:23-Jul-2018 11:08 (GMT ) 090177e18f141527\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:03-Au g-2018 10:11 (GMT )

Treatment of protocol-specific physician’s choice is to include any one of the single-agent 
chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_187607]. Suggested dosing schedules are noted, but if institution dose and regimen 
guidelines differ, the site may utilize institution guidelines: 
!Capecitabine: 1250 mg/m2, oral, twice daily, from Day 1 through 14 of a 21-day cycle, 
30 minutes after meal.
!Eribulin mesylate: 1.4 mg/m2(equivalent to eribulin 1.23 mg/m2), infusion over 2-5 minutes, 
Days 1 and 8 of 21-day cycles
!Gemcitabine: 1250 mg/m2, infusion over 30 minutes, Days 1 and 8 of 21-day cycles
!Vinorelbine: 30 mg/m2, weekly infusion over 6 to 10 minutes, Days 1, 8 and 15 of 21-day 
cycles
Dose modifications and reductions are to occur per the package insert and institutional practice, and as 
described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION: 
Efficacy: 
The primary efficacy measure will be the ability of the treatment to delay progression of breast cancer, 
assessed using sequential imaging studies digitally submitted to and reviewed by [CONTACT_187632]. 
Progression and response will be defined according to RECIST v.1.1 with modifications. Radiographic
disease assessment (CT and/or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) will be performed within 28 days 
prior to randomization. Subjects will undergo radiographic disease assessment every 6 weeks (± 7 days) from the date of randomization for 30 weeks. 
Thereafter, imaging assessments will be performed every 9 weeks (± 7 days) until progressive disease 
is radiographically documented as determined by [CONTACT_187633] a new 
antineoplastic therapy. Clinical disease progression should be verified by [CONTACT_187634] (or the subject will not be considered to have a progressive disease event for the purposes of the analysis). Imaging assessments should
continue according to the schedule of assessments until radiographic progression is observed by [CONTACT_187631], unless the subject withdraws consent or initiates a new antineoplastic therapy. 
The secondary efficacy measures include ORR (RECIST v.1.1 with modifications) as assessed by [CONTACT_187635]. Confirmation of objective response (CR or partial response [PR]) is not required.
The exploratory efficacy measures are to evaluate DOR in responding subjects and quality of life 090177e18f003b15\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:23-Jul-2018 11:08 (GMT ) 090177e18f141527\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:03-Au g-2018 10:11 (GMT )

Safety:
The following safety outcome measurements will be assessed:
!Incidence of adverse events (AEs), including serious AEs (SAEs) 
!Change in clinical laboratory tests (serum chemistry and hematology)
!Change in vital signs
!Change in physical examination 
!Concomitant medication use
Pharmacokinetics:
The following PK parameters will be determined from plasma talazoparib concentrations:
!Trough concentrations of talazoparib
A population PK modeling approach will be used to estimate individual values of apparent clearance 
(CL/F) and central volume of distribution (V c/F). Individual CL/F estimates will then be used to 
estimate individual area under the concentration time curve over a dosing interval (AUC τ).
STATISTICAL METHODS: 
Primary Efficacy Analysis:
The primary efficacy analysis is the comparison of PFS in subjects treated with talazoparib versus 
treatments of protocol-specific physician’s choice.
PFS is defined as time from randomization until the date of radiologic progressive disease (per 
RECIST v.1.1 with modifications as described in Section 24.3) as determined by [CONTACT_187636], whichever comes first. 
The primary analysis will be conducted when at least [ADDRESS_221343] been observed, and will be 
performed using the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, defined as all randomized subjects. 
The primary analysis will include only radiographic progression events as determined by [CONTACT_187637] v.1.[ADDRESS_221344] with a 0.05 level of significance will be used to compare treatment 
groups. The stratification factors will be the same as used to stratify the randomization schedule as

The median PFS and the associated 95% confidence interval (CI) for each treatment arm will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. 
The hazard ratio (HR= λ

If the p-value for the stratified log-rank test is statistically significant (< 0.05, two-sided) and the 
observed HR ( λ

For PFS, based on 2:1 randomization allocation ratio, a total of 288 events provide the study with 90% 
power for a 2-sided log-rank test with a 0.[ADDRESS_221349] a 50% increase in PFS 
(hazard ratio [HR]=0.67). 
Assuming an exponential distribution of PFS, this corresponds to an increase in median PFS from 
[ADDRESS_221350] that would result in 
statistical significance for PFS is a 28% improvement (HR = 0.78) from 20 to 25.6 weeks. 
Up to 429 subjects will be randomized (2:1) and followed to observe the required number of events 
within the planned study duration (approximately 39 months accrual; approximately 41 months total to 
observe the required PFS events).
For OS, approximately 321 death events will provide the study with 80% power for a 2-sided log-rank 
test with an overall 0.[ADDRESS_221351] a 39% increase in OS (HR=0.72). Assuming an exponential distribution of OS, this corresponds with an increase in median OS from 20 months to 
27.8 months. 
Safety Analysis:
The analyses of safety will include all subjects who receive any study drug (talazoparib or active 
control) throughout the study duration.
All AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The 
Investigator will classify the severity of AEs using the CTCAE v 4.03. A treatment emergent adverse 
event (TEAE) is defined as any event with an onset date on or after date of first dose of study drug, or 
any event present before treatment that worsens after treatment. Only TEAEs with an onset date prior 
to date of last dose + 30 days or the date of initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy (whichever 
occurs first) will be tabulated in summary tables. 
The number and percentage of subjects who experience AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_70244], preferred term, relationship to study drug, and severity for each treatment group. A by–subject 
listing will be provided for those subjects who experience an SAE, including death, or experience an 
AE associated with discontinuation from study drug. 
Clinical laboratory data will be summarized by [CONTACT_11876]. The number and percentage 
of subjects who experience abnormal (ie, outside of reference ranges) and/or clinically significant abnormalities after study drug administration will be presented for each clinical laboratory 
measurement. For each clinical laboratory measurement, descriptive statistics will be provided for 090177e18f003b15\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:23-Jul-2018 11:08 (GMT ) 090177e18f141527\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:03-Au g-2018 10:11 (GMT )

FINAL 14Dec20157 INTRODUCTION
A comprehensive review of talazoparib (also known as MDV3800, BMN 673) is contained 
in the Investigator Brochure (IB) supplied by [CONTACT_3433] e Sponsor. Investigators are to review this 
document prior to initiating this study.
7.1 Study Background
7.1.1 Talazoparib
Poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) represents a family of enzymes, of which at least two 
(PARP1 and PARP2) play important roles in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair. The study drug, talazoparib, is a potent and specific inhibitor of PARP [ADDRESS_221368] cancer susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) and breast cancer susceptibility gene 2 (BRCA2), both of which are key components in the pathway of repair for DNA double-strand breaks. Treatment with a PARP inhibitor results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.
7.1.2 Nonclinical Study Findings for Talazoparib
The nonclinical study findings in the rat and the dog for talazoparib are described in full in 
the IB. The main nonclinical findings were early hematological changes and subsequent bone marrow and lymphoid organ depletion, as well as focal necrosis, after repeat administration of talazoparib tosylate, the drug substance containing talazoparib. These findings were inaccordance with the mechanism of action and the exposure/ distribution pattern of the study drug and were reversible. The hematological changes, which consisted of decreases in the reticulocyte, platelet, red blood cell (RBC) and white blood cell (WBC) counts, were a sensitive and early marker of target organ toxicity and were used to clinically monitor safety. 
7.1.3 Preliminary Clinical Study Findings for Talazoparib
Two Phase 1 studies (PRP-001 and PRP-002) of talazoparib were conducted; one Phase 2 
study (673-201) has been initiated. 
The first-in-human study of talazoparib (PRP-001) was initiated in the first quarter of 2011. 
This is a Phase 1, single-arm, open-label, dose-escalation study of once daily, orally administered talazoparib for advanced or recurrent solid tumors (those that have defects in DNA repair). PRP-002, a Phase 1, 2-arm, open-label, dose-escalation study for talazoparibfor the treatment of subjects with advanced hematological malignancies was initiated in July 090177e18f003b15\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:23-Jul-2018 11:08 (GMT ) 090177e18f141527\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:03-Au g-2018 10:11 (GMT )

FINAL 14Dec20152011. This study enrolled subjects with acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, 
chronic lymphocy tic leukemia or mantle cell lymphoma. 
The primary objective of the Phase 1 studies is to establish the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) of once daily, orally administered talazoparib, and to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy in an expanded cohort of subjects with genetically defined tumors.
In June 2013, preliminary data from PRP-001 were presented at the American Society of 
Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2013 ( de Bono, 2013, J.Clin Oncol. ) and are described below. 
As of June 2013, 70 subjects (60 women/10 men) enrolled into the study; 39 subjects (33 women/6 men) with solid tumors were enrolled in the dose escalation phase of the study in 9 cohorts ranging from 25 to 1100 μg/day that defined a MTD of 1000 μg/day. On 
defining the MTD, [ADDRESS_221369], ovarian, and pancreas cancer with deleterious germline mutations; small cell lung cancer; and Ewing’s sarcoma, were enrolled in the expansion phase of the study to further characterize safety and efficacy. The median (range) age for all 70 subjects was 51.5 years (18 to 81), performance status (PS) was 0 (0 to 1) and number of prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26615] 4 (1 to 13), with 48 subjects having deleterious BRCA mutations. Tumors (number with deleterious BRCA 1/2 mutations) included 34 ovarian/ primary peritoneal (28); [ADDRESS_221370] (18); 8 Ewing’s; 4 pancreas; 2 colon; 1 prostate (1), and 1 mullerian carcinosarcoma. A total of 27 and 21 subjects had BRCA 1 and 2 mutations, respectively. 
Dose-limiting thrombocytopenia occurred in 1 of 6 subjects at 900 μg/day and 2 of 5 subjects 
at 1100μg/day, respectively. 
!Subject  (0.9 mg/day): Grade 3 thrombocytopenia reported on Days 29-42
resolved after discontinuation of study drug; no hemorrhage was noted. Grade 3 
anemia observed during this time also resolved
!Subject  (1.1 mg/day): Grade 3 thrombocytopenia reported on Days 22-26, 
became Grade 4 thrombocytopenia on Days 26-32. It resolved after discontinuation of 
study drug; the subject received a platelet transfusion. No hemorrhage was noted. The subject died on Day [ADDRESS_221371] cancer
!Subject  (1.1 mg/day): Grade 3 thrombocytopenia reported on Days 28-32 
resolved after discontinuation of study drug; no hemorrhage was noted
None of the 6 subjects who received a dose of 1 mg/day during the dose-escalation phase of 
this study had a dose-limiting toxicity, although Grade 3 anemia and neutropenia were observed in later treatment cycles. Based on these results, the MTD was defined at a dose of 1000μg/day. Related adverse events (AEs) occurring in >10% of all 70 subjects included

neutropenia (11%). One subject had drug-related grade [ADDRESS_221372] (1%), anemia and thrombocytopenia each in 9 subjects (13%) and neutropenia in 4 subjects (6%). Dose reductions occurred in [ADDRESS_221373] one dose of 
talazoparib of which 77 subjects received the recommended dose of 1 mg/day. Dose reductions were reported for 26 (34%) of the 77 subjects treated at the recommended dose. The dose was reduced once (to 0.75 mg/day) for 14 subjects, twice (to 0.75 mg/day, then 0.5 mg/day) for 11 subjects, and three times (to 0.75 mg/day, 0.5 mg/day, then 0.25 mg/day)for one subject. In 20 (77%) of the [ADDRESS_221374] frequently reported AEs leading to dose modification were thrombocytopenia and anemia, each reported for 20 subjects, followed by [CONTACT_187648] 12 subjects.
Inhibition of PARP activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cell was observed at doses 
≥100 μg/day. Talazoparib plasma concentrations peaked [ADDRESS_221375]-dose; in general, 
exposure increased dose proportionally. Steady state plasma concentrations were reached by [CONTACT_187649]. At the recommended dose of 1 mg/day, the mean maximum plasma concentration (C
max) was 10.6 (± 4.2) ng/mL on Day 1, and 
21.0 (± 8.0) ng/mL on Day 35. The mean area under the concentration time curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC
0-24) at the recommended dose of 1 mg/day was 85.1 (± 29.1) and 202.0 
(± 54.0) ng-hr/mL on Day 1 and Day 35, respectively. 
Objective (RECIST v.1.1) and/or CA-125 responses occurred at doses ≥ 100 μg/day in 11 of 
25 subjects (44%) and 19 of 27 subjects (70%) with BRCA-carrier ovarian and peritoneal cancer, respectively. Clinical benefit (complete response [CR]/partial response [PR]/stable disease [SD] > 24 weeks) occurred in 23 of 28 subjects (82%) with BRCA-carrier ovarian and peritoneal cancer. 
Objective responses occurred in 8 of 18 (44%) BRCA-carrier breast cancer subjects. Clinical 
benefit (CR/PR/SD >12 weeks) occurred in 12 of 18 (67%) of BRCA-carriers.

Medivation, Inc. 673-301 – Amendment [ADDRESS_221376] led to development of targeted therapeutics. Among others, the potential treatment options are influenced by [CONTACT_187622][INVESTIGATOR_3506] 2 (HER2) status of the tumor. Treatment options for subjects presenting with metastatic breast cancer may also be influenced by [CONTACT_187623], how soon after adjuvant therapy the subject relapses, and by [CONTACT_187624]. 
No therapi[INVESTIGATOR_187610]-defined vulnerability of 
BRCA mutant tumors. It would be a significant advance to provide a therapy which exploits the vulnerability of BRCA-mutant bearing tumors while sparing normal cells carrying one healthy BRCA allele.
Prognosis and best treatment practices in breast cancer subjects with germline BRCA1 or 
BRCA2 mutations have, for the most part, been characterized in retrospective studies from single institutions. When compared to sporadic primary breast cancer, BRCA1 disease is more likely to be hormone receptor negative and BRCA2 disease is more likely to be hormone receptor positive ( Atchley, 2008, J.Clin.Oncol. ), (Verhoog, 1999, J.Clin.Oncol.) . 
BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast cancers have been reported to be higher grade and higher stage and to have more extensive and extracapsular lymph node involvement compared to non-BRCA cancers ( Atchley, 2008, J.Clin.Oncol. ), (Rennert, 2007, N.Engl.J.Med. ). 
However, a review of [ADDRESS_221377] cancer, the presence of the mutation provided no other prognostic information (Liebens, 2007, Eur.J.Cancer ).
First-line therapy of metastatic breast cancer often includes an anthracycline and/or taxane. 
The combination of doxorubicin and paclitaxel in newly metastatic breast cancer was shown to improve response rates and time to treatment failure relative to either doxorubicin or paclitaxel given as single agents but had no significant impact on overall survival (OS) (Sledge, 2003, J.Clin.Oncol. ). This supports the use of single-agent chemotherapy where 
survival is not adversely impacted while limiting the toxicity of therapy. 090177e18f003b15\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:23-Jul-2018 11:08 (GMT ) 090177e18f141527\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:03-Au g-2018 10:11 (GMT )
Medivation, Inc. 673-301 – Amendment [ADDRESS_221378] was exposed to anthracyclines in the adjuvant setting. In addition, growing evidence from nonclinical studies suggests that sensitivity to taxanes may require functional BRCA1 protein ( Lafarge, 2001, Oncogene ), (Quinn, 2003, Cancer Res .), (Tassone, 2003, 
Br.J.Cancer ). In response to abnormal mitosis induced by [CONTACT_187650], BRCA1 protein activates 
the mitotic spi[INVESTIGATOR_187611] c-Jun-N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase pathway, leading to cell death ( Harkin, 1999, Cell ), (Quinn, 2009, 
Gynecol.Oncol .).
Responsiveness of BRCA-associated breast cancer to chemotherapy is poorly understood, 
and the data are conflicting. Retrospective neoadjuvant subject series have suggested that primary breast cancer in BRCA1 carriers is platinum-sensitive and relatively unresponsive to anthracyclines and/or taxanes ( By[CONTACT_116], 2010, J.Clin.Oncol .) while other studies have found 
that BRCA1 is relatively responsive to anthracyclines and/or taxanes while BRCA2 disease is less responsive than sporadic primary breast cancer to these drug classes ( Arun, 2011, 
J.Clin.Oncol. ). More recent data ( Tutt, 2014, SABCS ) demonstrated a prolonged median PFS 
in TNBC patients with a known deleterious BRCA1/[ADDRESS_221379] regimens (anthracycline-based, taxane-based or the combination regimen of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil [CMF]), while BRCA2 subjects appeared to have higher response rates with better survival than sporadic subjects ( Kriege, 2009, J.Clin.Oncol. ). In another series from the same institution evaluating 
taxane sensitivity in first- to third-line metastatic breast cancer, BRCA1 subjects appeared to be less responsive to docetaxel or paclitaxel than subjects with sporadic breast cancer, while BRCA2 subjects appeared to be more sensitive ( Kriege, 2012, Cancer ). 
Sensitivity of BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated breast cancer to other standard 
chemotherapeutic agents has not been reported but is not generally perceived to be different from sporadic breast cancer. However, the lack of prospective, controlled studies in BRCA1 and BRCA2-mutant disease along with the mixed data from small retrospective studies underscores the lack of information for making treatment decisions for these subjects. The potential role of BRCA1 in mediation of taxane cytotoxicity is consistent with the observation that the taxanes may be less effective in treatment of BRCA1-associated metastatic breast cancer than sporadic disease. This, coupled with the potential to specifically 090177e18f003b15\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:23-Jul-2018 11:08 (GMT ) 090177e18f141527\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:03-Au g-2018 10:11 (GMT )

Two studies of the PARP inhibitor, olaparib, given as a single agent to breast cancer subjects 
have been published. In one study, subjects with germline BRCA mutations were treated with either 400 mg twice daily or 100 mg twice daily in a non-randomized fashion. Eleven of 27 subjects (41%) receiving the higher dose had objective responses while 6 of 27 (22%) of subjects receiving the lower dose responded ( Tutt, 2010, Lancet ). In a second trial, olaparib 
was evaluated in subjects with germline mutations as well as subjects with triple negative breast cancer in the absence of germline mutations. 
Ten subjects with germline mutations were enrolled, including [ADDRESS_221381] germline BRCA mutations or had unknown BRCA status ( Gelmon, 2011, Lancet Oncol. ).

9.1 Overall Study Design and Plan
The study is an open-label, 2-arm, 2:1 randomized trial of talazoparib versus 
protocol-specific physician’s choice. Subjects with germline BRCA mutations who have received no more than 3 prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for locally advanced and/ormetastatic breast cancer will be enrolled. 
Options for protocol-specific physician’s choice include one of the following single-agent 
chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]: 
!Capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, vinorelbine
oThe protocol-specific physician’s choice must be determined prior to 
randomization for each individual subject. 
Subjects will be centrally randomized with stratification by [CONTACT_716]:
!Number of prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for locally advanced and/or
metastatic disease (0 vs. 1, 2, or 3)
!Triple negative (estrogen-receptor negative, progesterone-receptor negative, 
HER2-negative) vs. non-triple negative breast cancer based on most recent biopsy
!History of central nervous system (CNS) metastases vs. no CNS metastases
A Screening visit will occur within [ADDRESS_221386] start treatment ≤ 5 days from randomization; starting later will be considered a 
protocol deviation. Subjects will present for weekly treatment visits for the first 2 cycles of talazoparib or protocol-specific physician’s choice. Treatment with talazoparib or protocol-specific physician’s choice will continue until radiographic disease progression as determined by [CONTACT_187625] (IRF), unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal, physician’s decision to terminate treatment, or Sponsor’s decision to terminate the trial. 
Talazoparib will be administered orally daily for 21 days in repeated 21-day cycles at 
1.0 mg/day with provision for dose modifications as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
Protocol-specific physician’s choice will also be administered in 21-day cycles in accordance with the dose and regimens suggested below unless institution dose and regimen guidelines differ in which case the site may utilize institution guidelines:

Dose modifications and reductions for protocol-specific physician’s choice are to occur per 
the package insert and institutional practice.
Tumor assessments will be performed for subjects by [CONTACT_20420] (CT [preferred 
method]), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and x-ray. All subjects will also have nuclear medicine whole body bone scans within 12 weeks before randomization. 
Tumor assessments are to be performed every 6 weeks (± 7 days) from the date of 
randomization for the initial 30 weeks, and every 9 weeks thereafter (± 7 days), regardless ofany dose interruptions or dose delays until radiographic disease progression as determined by [CONTACT_187626] a new antineoplastic therapy. Tumor assessments can occur as clinically indicated anytime during the study, and at the time of clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_100640]. Optional tumor marker assessments (eg, CA15-3 or CA27-29) are to be performed every 6 weeks (± 7 days) from the date of randomization for the initial 30 weeks, every 9 weeks thereafter (± 7 days), and at the End of Treatment but should not be repeated if normal at baseline. If bone metastasis is seen at Baseline, bone scans will be repeated every 12 weeks (± 7 days) until radiographic disease progression as determined by [CONTACT_187626] a new antineoplastic therapy and as clinically indicated. In subjects without baseline bone lesions, bone scans should be repeated only as clinically indicated.
An End of Treatment visit will be performed for subjects 30 days (-3 or +10 days postdose) 
after the last dose of study drug. 
Subjects who discontinue from study drug for reasons other than radiographic disease 
progression as determined by [CONTACT_187626] a new antineoplastic therapy should be followed to radiographic progression by [CONTACT_187627] (eg, CT scans) unless the subject withdraws consent. Clinical disease progression should be verified by [CONTACT_187651]; study treatment should continue until radiographic progression has occurred. All subjects will be followed for anticancer treatment and survivalstatus. Survival follow-up will continue until death. Follow-up for anticancer therapy and survival status will occur every 60 days (± 7 days) after the last dose of study drug for 1 year and every 90 days (± 14 days) thereafter, or when requested by [CONTACT_1034].

FINAL 14Dec20159.2 Discussion of Study Design, Including Choice of Control Group
This is a Phase 3, open-label, randomized, parallel, 2-arm, multi-center study of talazoparib
vs. protocol-specific physician’s choice in germline BRCA mutation subjects with locally advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer, who have received no more than 3 prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for locally advanced and/or metastatic disease. 
The rationale for this study is outlined below and described in detail in Section 7.2. 
The subject population of germline BRCA mutation subjects with locally advanced and/or
metastatic breast cancer was chosen for this study as there is a current unmet need to treat this population and interim results from the Phase 1 study (PRP-001) indicated objective responses to talazoparib in [ADDRESS_221400] suitable 
for assessing the safety and efficacy endpoints in the talazoparib group compared with the control group. 
Talazoparib will be administered as a single agent in this study at a dose of 1.0 mg/day with 
provision for dose reductions to 0.75 mg/day and 0.5 mg/day (or lower) in case of toxicity. This dose regimen was chosen based on preliminary results from the Phase 1 clinical trial (PRP-001) involving breast cancer subjects, which reported good tolerability of talazoparibup to 1000 μg/day but dose-limiting thrombocytopenia at higher doses (1100 μg/day). 
The control group in this study is treatment by [CONTACT_990]-specific physician’s choice of any 
one of the single-agent chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]: capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine or vinorelbine. These reference chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_187612]-agent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_187613]/or metastatic breast cancer. Dose modifications and reductions are permitted per the package inserts and institutional practice. 
The study drug will be administered until radiographic disease progression as determined by 
[CONTACT_187654], occurrence of unacceptable toxicity, subject or physician decision to stop treatment or until the study is terminated by [CONTACT_1034]. 090177e18f003b15\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:23-Jul-2018 11:08 (GMT ) 090177e18f141527\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:03-Au g-2018 10:11 (GMT )

FINAL 14Dec2015Assignment to study drug arms will be based on a computer-generated schedule before the 
start of the study. The schedule will be developed according to the Randomization Plan. The approved randomization schedule will be implemented in an interactive voice and Web response system (IXRS). The IXRS will assign a subject to talazoparib or protocol-specific physician’s choice based on the subject’s strata and allocate a randomization number. For subjects assigned to the physician’s choice arm, the protocol-specific physician’s choice should be determined prior to randomization. A subject may only receive one randomization number; each randomization number may only be assigned to one subject. 
A subject will be considered randomized into the study when a randomization number is 
assigned. At the end of the trial the completed randomization schedule will be transferred to the Sponsor.

The selection of doses used in this study is described in Section 7.2and Section 9.2. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Talazoparib: Timing of Administration and Dose Reduction Guidelines 
Talazoparib should be taken orally once daily (ie, continuous daily dosing) at approximately 
the same time each day (preferably in the morning). On days of clinic visits when PK samples are to be drawn, talazoparib should be taken at the clinic after completion of pre-dose sampling and assessments; on these PK sample dates, the clinic visit should be scheduled for approximately the same time of day that the dose is typi[INVESTIGATOR_187615].
Daily dosing of talazoparib can be interrupted for recovery from toxicity for up to 28 days. 
For interruptions longer than 28 days, treatment at the same or a reduced dose can be considered based on a discussion between the Sponsor or designee and Investigator if evidence of response or clinical benefit to talazoparib is noted. 
Dose modifications should be made based on the observed toxicity, as summarized in

dosing may resume at the next lower dose level when 
toxicity resolves to Grade 1 or would meet the eligibility 
criteria ( Section 9.3).
Grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity 
(other than liver test
abnormalities)Daily dosing must be held for Grade 4 AEs (regardless of 
relationship to talazoparib). 
Supportive care should be implemented as appropriate

FINAL 14Dec2015(talazoparib or treatment of physician’s choice) as specified in US FDA Guidance for 
Industry Drug-Induced Liver Injury:  Premarketing Clinical Evaluation (2009).
Subjects who meet permanent discontinuation criteria or temporary withholding criteria, or 
who do not meet permanent discontinuation criteria or temporary withholding criteria but who have abnormal liver tests are to be followed according to the recommendations in this section.
It is recommended that study drug (talazoparib or treatment of physician’s choice) be 
withheld for any one of the liver test abnormalities listed in Table 9-4 .
Table 9-4: Liver Test Abnormalities That May Require Dose Modifications
Baseline AST or ALT Value Elevation
≤ 3 × ULN > 5 × ULN to ≤ 8 × ULN 
>3  t o  ≤5 × ULN > 8 × ULN 
Baseline Total Bilirubin Value Elevation
≤ 1.5 × ULN > 3 × ULN
Study drug (talazoparib or treatment of physician’s choice) should be withheld pending 
investigation into alternative causes of drug-induced liver injury (DILI). If study drug is withheld, the subject should be followed for possible DILI. Rechallenge may be considered if an alternative cause for the impaired liver tests (ie, ALT, AST, total bilirubin) is discovered and the laboratory abnormalities resolve to normal or baseline values.
The decision to rechallenge the subject should be discussed and agreed on unanimously by 
[CONTACT_423], Investigator, and Sponsor. Following rechallenge, subjects should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of hepatitis, and/or abnormal liver test results. If signs or symptoms recur with rechallenge, study drug (talazoparib or treatment of physician’s choice) should be permanently discontinued. Subjects who clearly meet the criteria for permanent discontinuation should never be rechallenged.
Study drug should be discontinued permanently if ALL of the following 4 criteria are met 
(ie, potential severe DILI/Hy’s Law case): 
1. AST or ALT increases to ≥ 3 × ULN (> 5 × ULN if baseline ALT/AST is > 3 and 
≤5 × ULN)
2. Total bilirubin increases to > 2 × ULN and/or INR > 1.53. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) value does not reach 2 × ULN090177e18f003b15\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:23-Jul-2018 11:08 (GMT ) 090177e18f141527\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:03-Au g-2018 10:11 (GMT )

FINAL 14Dec20154. No alternative cause explains the combination of the above laboratory abnormalities; 
important alternative causes include, but are not limited to:
oHepatobiliary tract disease
oViral hepatitis (eg, hepatitis A/B/C/D/E, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, 
herpes simplex virus, varicella, toxoplasmosis, parvovirus)
oCongestive heart failure, hypotension, or any cause of hypoxia to the liver 
causing ischemia
oExposure to hepatotoxic agents/drugs or hepatotoxins, including herbal and 
dietary supplements, plants, and mushrooms  
oAlcoholic hepatitis
oNon-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) 
oAutoimmune hepatitis 
oWilson’s disease and hemochromatosis
oAlpha-one antitrypsin deficiency 
If an alternative cause for hepatotoxicity is identified or if the liver test abnormalities do not 
reach the specified severity, study drug should be withheld or permanently discontinued, as appropriate for the safety of the subject based on the patient population and/or severity of the hepatotoxicity or event.  
All subjects in whom study drug is withheld (either conditionally or permanently) due to a 
potential DILI are to undergo a period of “close observation” until the liver test abnormalities return to baseline or normal values.  The evaluations listed in Table 9-5 should be performed.

FINAL 14Dec201510 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS
10.1 Adverse Events
!For this protocol, a reportable AE is any untoward medical occurrence (eg, sign, 
symptom, illness, disease or injury) in a subject administered study drug or other 
protocol-imposed intervention, regardless of attribution. Examples of AEs include the following: 
!A worsening, excluding minor fluctuations, in the nature, severity, frequency, or 
duration of a pre-existing condition
!Development of an intercurrent illness during the study
!Development of symptoms that may or may not be related to the use of a concomitant 
medication or investigational product
!Injury or accidents: If a medical condition is known to have caused the injury or
accident, the medical condition and the accident should be reported as 2 separate
medical events (eg, for a fall secondary to dizziness, both “dizziness” and “fall”should be recorded separately)
!Investigational abnormalities (eg, laboratory parameters, vital signs, ECG data)
should be defined as AEs only if the abnormality meets one of the following criteria:
oInduces clinical signs or symptoms
oNeeds active intervention
oNeeds interruption or discontinuation of study medication
oAbnormality or investigational value is clinically significant in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_187618]:
!Medical or surgical procedures (eg, surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction,
transfusion); the condition that leads to the procedure is an AE
!Pre-existing diseases or conditions present or detected before the start of study drug
administration that do not worsen
!Situations where an untoward medical event has not occurred (eg, planned
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_187619])
Events of special interest
: Adverse events of special interest are any events identified for
intensive monitoring during the study. For 673-301, events of special interest includeoverdose ( Section 10.3), pregnancy in the subject or partner ( Section 10.4), and specified
liver test abnormalities ( Section 10.5).090177e18f003b15\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:23-Jul-2018 11:08 (GMT ) 090177e18f141527\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:03-Au g-2018 10:11 (GMT )
Medivation, Inc. 673-301 – Amendment 1 Page 65
FINAL 14Dec2015An adverse drug reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that study drug 
caused the AE. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between study drug and the AE.
Whenever possible, it is preferable to record a diagnosis as the AE term rather than a series 
of terms relating to a diagnosis or a surgical procedure.
The reporting period for non-serious AEs is the period from the time of initial dose of study 
drug through [ADDRESS_221443] dose of study drug (permanent discontinuation of 
talazoparib or physician’s choice), or before initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy, whichever occurs first. If a non-serious AE remains unresolved at the conclusion of the study, the Investigator will assess whether continued follow-up of the AE is warranted, and the results of this assessment must be documented. Resolution is defined as the return to baseline status or stabilization of the condition with the expectation that it will remain chronic. The Investigator should follow all unresolved AEs until the events are resolved or stabilized, the subject is lost to follow-up, or it has been determined that the study drug or participation is not the cause of the AE. Resolution of AEs (with dates) should be documented on the appropriate eCRF page(s) and in the subject’s medical record.
The criteria for determining, and the reporting of, SAEs is provided in Section 10.2.
The Investigator responsible for the care of the subject or qualified designee will assess AEs 
for severity, for relationship to study drug, and seriousness (refer to Section 10.2 for SAE 
definition). 
Severity (as in mild, moderate or severe myocardial infarction) is not equivalent to 
seriousness, which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.
The Investigator will determine the severity of each event by [CONTACT_187672] v4.03. 
Adverse events that do not have a corresponding CTCAE term will be assessed according to the general guidelines for grading used in the CTCAE v4.03 as stated below.090177e18f003b15\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:23-Jul-2018 11:08 (GMT ) 090177e18f141527\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:03-Au g-2018 10:11 (GMT )

bSelf-care ADL refer to the following examples: bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding oneself, using the toilet, taking medications, not bedridden.
The study Investigator responsible for the subjects care (or qualified designee) will assess 
causality of reportable AEs/SAEs. The causal attribution guidance in Table 10-1 will be 
applied.
Table 10-1: Causal Attribution Guidance
Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE/SAE was caused by [CONTACT_187673] 
(evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship?
YES (Possible, probable or definite)If there is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the 
AE/SAE and study drug administration and the AE/SAE cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the AE/SAE follows a known pattern of response to study 
drug; and/or the AE/SAE abates or resolves upon discontinuation of study 
drug or dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re-challenge.

Disease progression is not unexpected in this study population and the term “disease

When clinical disease progression is identified, the clinical event that identifies the disease progression, if known, should be reported as the AE.090177e18f003b15\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:23-Jul-2018 11:08 (GMT ) 090177e18f141527\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:03-Au g-2018 10:11 (GMT )
Medivation, Inc. 673-301 – Amendment [ADDRESS_221456] for measuring response to treatment in cancer (Eisenhauer, Eur. J. Cancer. 2009 ). Modifications to the criteria, regarding progression by 
[CONTACT_187681] a requirement for progression by [CONTACT_9661] (omitting progression by [CONTACT_187682]), will be employed (detailed in Section 24.3). Efficacy endpoints based on tumor assessments have been 
increasingly used in drug development, and both PFS and time to tumor progression (TTP) have been accepted as markers of clinical benefit for drug approval. PFS is available earlier than OS, is less likely than OS to be influenced by [CONTACT_187683], and is not influenced by [CONTACT_187684] a given trial ( Everardo D. Saad., 
2011 ). PFS is subject to measurement error and bias. Measurement error may result from 
inconsistent use of definitions and standards among Investigators and bias may result from unblinded ascertainment of progression and from the fact that the date at which progression is verified radiographically is a proxy for the true progression date, which lies somewhere within two successive assessments ( Everardo D. Saad., 2011 ).
Overall survival has historically been considered the most important endpoint in medical 
oncology due to its objective measurement and the unquestionable benefit derived by [CONTACT_1962]. The US FDA considers OS a direct measure of treatment benefit; according to that agency, OS is usually the preferred endpoint when studies can be conducted to adequately assess survival ( US Department of Health and Human Services, May 2007 ). However, OS is 
increasingly an elusive endpoint, mostly because it may be confounded by [CONTACT_187685] a trial ( Everardo D. Saad., 2011 ). 
The European Medicine’s Agency (EMA), Committee for Medicinal Products for Human 
Use (CHMP) Guideline on the Evaluation of Anticancer Medicinal Products in Man (EMA/CPMP/205/95/Rev.4, 2012 ) states that OS and PFS are acceptable endpoints and 
recommends that if PFS is selected as the primary endpoint, OS should be selected as a secondary endpoint. 
In this study, PFS (defined as time from randomization until the date of radiologic
progressive disease [per RECIST v.1.1 with modifications] as determined by [CONTACT_187632], or death from any cause, whichever comes first) has been selected as the primary endpoint. The potential for measurement error and bias, outlined above, has been reduced in this study by [CONTACT_2224] a blinded central IRF and the use of a randomized study design in which a similar evaluation schedule is used for all treatment arms. Overall survival has been selected 090177e18f003b15\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:23-Jul-2018 11:08 (GMT ) 090177e18f141527\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:03-Au g-2018 10:11 (GMT )

FINAL 14Dec2015as a secondary endpoint in this study in accordance with the regulatory guidance described 
above.
The secondary efficacy measure of ORR and exploratory efficacy measure of DOR are well 
accepted efficacy endpoints in clinical development for oncology studies and in line with recommendations in the EMA CHMP Guideline on the Evaluation of Anticancer Medicinal Products in Man ( EMA/CPMP/205/95/Rev.4, 2012 ); and the US FDA Guidance for Industry 
on Clinical Trial Endpoints for the Approval of Cancer Drugs and Biologics ( US Department 
of Health and Human Services, May 2007 ). 
Quality of life will be assessed as an exploratory endpoint in this study using the EORTC

The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will provide additional details on the planned statistical 
analysis. 
14.1.[ADDRESS_221476] been observed. 
14.1.2 Procedures for Accounting for Missing, Unused and Spurious Data
All available data will be used. No efficacy or PK data will be imputed; missing values will 
be treated as missing.
14.2 Primary Efficacy Analysis
The primary efficacy analysis is the comparison of PFS in subjects treated with talazoparib
versus treatments of protocol-specific physician’s choice.
The primary endpoint is PFS, which is defined as time from randomization until the date of
radiologic progressive disease per RECIST v.1.[ADDRESS_221477] been observed. 
The primary analysis of PFS will be performed using the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, 
defined as all randomized subjects, and will include only radiographic progression events as determined by [CONTACT_187690] v.1.[ADDRESS_221478] with a 0.05 level of significance will be used to compare 
treatment groups. The stratification factors will be the same used to stratify the randomization schedule as documented in the interactive voice and Web response system (IXRS). 090177e18f003b15\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:23-Jul-2018 11:08 (GMT ) 090177e18f141527\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:03-Au g-2018 10:11 (GMT )
Medivation, Inc. 673-301 – Amendment 1 Page 88
FINAL 14Dec2015The median PFS and the associated 95% confidence interval (CI) for each treatment arm will 
be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The hazard ratio (HR; λtalazoparib / λcontrol ) and the 
associated 95% CI will be estimated using a Cox regression model with treatment group as the only main effect and stratifying by [CONTACT_187638]-rank test. An unstratified HR and the associated 95% CI will also be presented.
If the p-value for the stratified log-rank test is statistically significant (< 0.05, two-sided) and 
the observed HR ( λ
talazoparib / λcontrol ) is < 1, the null hypothesis of no difference in PFS will be 
rejected and it will be inferred that PFS is statistically prolonged in the group receiving talazoparib compared with the group receiving protocol-specific physician’s choice of therapy.

factors will be the same used to stratify the randomization schedule as documented in the IXRS.
The median of OS and the associated 95% CI for each treatment arm will be estimated using 
the Kaplan-Meier method. The HR and the associated 95% CI will be estimated using a Cox regression model with treatment group as the only main effect and stratifying by [CONTACT_187638]-rank test. An unstratified HR and the associated 95% CI will also be presented.
14.4 Exploratory Efficacy Analysis
The exploratory efficacy endpoints are duration of response in responding subjects and 
quality of life for all enrolled subjects, assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 / EORTC QLQ-BR23.  
Duration of response is defined, for subjects with an objective response, as the time from first 
radiographic documentation of CR or PR to disease progression by [CONTACT_393] v.1.[ADDRESS_221482]. Median duration of response and its associated 95% CI will be estimated, by [CONTACT_1570], using Kaplan-Meier methods. The difference between treatment groups will be analyzed using a stratified log-rank test, using the same stratification that was used for randomization. 
The EORTC QLQ-C30 / EORTC QLQ-BR23 is composed of a global health status scale, 
5 functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea & vomiting, and pain), and several single items, as well as a module designed specifically for breast cancer.
Summary statistics will be presented, by [CONTACT_1570], at Baseline, at Day [ADDRESS_221483] cancer module. Summary statistics for change from baseline will be presented at Day 1 of each cycle and at the End of Treatment. Differences between treatment groups will be analyzed using repeated measures analysis methods if applicable.
Blood and tumor samples will be collected for future exploratory research to identify 
additional marker profiles that indicate potential sensitivity to PARP inhibition, to characterize tumor sensitivity and resistance to talazoparib, and for other disease-related research. Analyses will include but not be limited to genomic/genetic, cellular, molecular, histochemical and biochemical assays. 090177e18f003b15\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:23-Jul-2018 11:08 (GMT ) 090177e18f141527\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:03-Au g-2018 10:11 (GMT )

A population PK modeling approach will be used to estimate individual values of apparent 
clearance (CL/F) and central volume of distribution (Vc/F) from the sparse post-dose PK samples. Individual CL/F estimates will then be used to estimate individual exposure parameters (eg, area under the concentration time curve over a dosing interval [AUC
τ]). The 
association between talazoparib exposure parameters and efficacy and safety outcomes maybe explored.
14.5 Safety Analysis
The analyses of safety will include all subjects who receive any study drug (talazoparib or 
active control) throughout the study duration.
All AEs will be coded using MedDRA. The Investigator will classify the severity of AEs 
using the CTCAE v 4.03. A treatment emergent AE (TEAE) is defined as any event with an onset date on or after date of first dose of study drug, or any event present before treatment that worsens after treatment. Only TEAEs with an onset date prior to date of last dose + 30 days or the date of initiation of a new antineoplastic therapy (whichever occurs first)will be tabulated in summary tables. 
The number and percentage of subjects with AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_9313], 
preferred term, relationship to study drug, and severity for each treatment group. A by-subject listing will be provided for those subjects who experience an SAE, including death, or experience an AE associated with discontinuation of study drug. 
Clinical laboratory data will be summarized by [CONTACT_11876]. The number and 
percentage of subjects who experience abnormal (ie, outside of reference ranges) and/or clinically significant abnormalities after study drug administration will be presented for each clinical laboratory measurement. For each clinical laboratory measurement, descriptive statistics will be provided for baseline and all subsequent post-treatment scheduled visits. Changes from baseline to the post-treatment visits will also be provided. Descriptive statistics of vital signs will also be provided in a similar manner. In addition, shift from baseline in CTCAE grade (where applicable) and by [CONTACT_5019]/low flags (where CTCAE grades are not defined) will be presented by [CONTACT_1570].090177e18f003b15\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:23-Jul-2018 11:08 (GMT ) 090177e18f141527\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:03-Au g-2018 10:11 (GMT )

FINAL 14Dec201514.6 Determination of Sample Size
This study is designed to provide adequate power for PFS and OS.
For PFS, based on 2:1 randomization allocation ratio, a total of 288 events provide the study 
with 90% power for a 2-sided log-rank test with a 0.[ADDRESS_221485] a 50% increase in PFS (hazard ratio [HR]=0.67). Assuming an exponential distribution of PFS, this corresponds to an increase in median PFS from [ADDRESS_221486] that would result in statistical significance for PFS is a 28% improvement (HR = 0.78) from 20 to 25.6 weeks. 
Up to 429 subjects will be randomized (2:1) and followed to observe the required number of 
events within the planned study duration (approximately 39 months accrual; approximately 41 months total to observe the required PFS events). 
For OS, approximately 321 events will provide the study with 80% power for a 2-sided 
log-rank test with an overall 0.[ADDRESS_221487] a 39% increase in OS (HR=0.72). Assuming an exponential distribution of OS, this corresponds with an increase in median OS from [ADDRESS_221488] of all subjects who receive any study drug

Medivation, Inc. 673-301 – Amendment [ADDRESS_221504] v.1.1 Criteria with Modifications
Tumor response will be assessed according to the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumor guideline (RECIST v.1.1) ( Eisenhauer, Eur. J. Cancer. 2009 ). Modifications to 
the criteria, regarding progression by [CONTACT_187702] (documented in the table notes for Overall Visit Response). Another modification is a requirement for progression by [CONTACT_9661] (omitting progression by [CONTACT_187682]), as described in Section 24.3.1 . Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI), X-ray, and nuclear medicine whole body bone scans will be reviewed at an independent review facility by [CONTACT_187703] v.1.1 for this trial ( Section 16), 
and blinded to subject demographics, treatment, and clinical status. Full details will be provided as a separate imaging charter.
24.3.1 Image Included in the Assessment
!CT is the preferred method of assessment. Intravenous contrast is required, unless the 
subject has an allergy to contrast that cannot be controlled with premedications. 
Anatomy scanned should include the chest (starting above the lung api[INVESTIGATOR_187621]), abdomen, and pelvis (coverage to include the symphysis pubis). Slice thickness should be no greater than 5 mm, with no gaps. Details of the imaging protocols will be provided to sites in an imaging manual.
!If subjects are unable to receive iodinated CT contrast, the preferred imaging is non-
contrast CT of the chest, and MRI of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast.
!For non-infiltrative and distinct skin nodules, CT or MRI remains the preferred 
method of assessment. Digital photography will not be acceptable as a method of 
radiographic assessment of skin lesions. Discrete skin nodules that are not visible using CT or MRI should be considered non-measurable, non-target lesions. 
!For bone lesions, CT or MRI remains the preferred method of assessment. For lesions 
that cannot be quantified by [CONTACT_462], nuclear medicine bone scan may be used to assess metastases to bone. Whole body acquisition with planar spot views of areas of concern is acceptable. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging, if acquired, is also acceptable.
!Chest X-ray is permitted by [CONTACT_39694] v.1.[ADDRESS_221505], a reviewer will determine which 
lesions are appropriate for repeated quantitative assessment (measurable lesions). From the 090177e18f003b15\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:23-Jul-2018 11:08 (GMT ) 090177e18f141527\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:03-Au g-2018 10:11 (GMT )
Medivation, Inc. 673-301 – Amendment 1 Page 105
FINAL 14Dec2015measurable lesions, the reviewer will choose a set of lesions to be followed quantitatively 
throughout the trial (target lesions). Target lesions will be selected based on size, reproducibility of measurement, and whether the group of lesions represents the disease distribution. A value for the target tumor burden (sum of diameters) will be calculated. All tumor lesions that are not chosen for quantitative assessment will be documented and followed qualitatively as non-target lesions.
At each follow-up visit, the reviewer will assess the target lesions by [CONTACT_187704]. The Reviewer will verify the calculatedsum of diameters, and the comparison of that sum to the baseline value (for determining partial response) and to the nadir, the smallest value seen until that point (to look for progression). The Reviewer will assess the non-target lesions qualitatively, and will search for new lesions. Information about target, non-target, and new lesions will be combined to produce an overall visit response for the subject. After all visit assessments are completed, the Reviewer will verify each visit response, and the visit responses will be used to derive information relevant to the endpoints (such as the date of progression and the best overall response).
24.3.3 Measurable and Non-Measurable Disease
Eligibility of lesions for quantitative assessment will be determined at baseline, with target 
lesions selected from the measurable lesions identified. After baseline, target lesions will always be assessed quantitatively, and non-target lesions will be assessed qualitatively, with no further evaluation of measurability according to these definitions.
Measurable Disease
!A lesion is considered measurable if it has a diameter of ≥ [ADDRESS_221506] or MRI, assuming that the slice thickness is 5 mm or less. If the slice thickness 
is greater than 5 mm, the minimum size increases to two times the slice thickness(slice thickness is the total distance between the tops of two adjacent slices, including any gap).
!Malignant lymph nodes are considered measurable if the short axis (greatest 
dimension perpendicular to the longest diameter) is ≥ 15 mm at baseline.
!If chest X-ray is used, a lesion is considered measurable if it is completely surrounded 
by [CONTACT_187705], and has a diameter of [ADDRESS_221507] scanner is used, the minimum size for measurability is 20 mm.090177e18f003b15\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:23-Jul-2018 11:08 (GMT ) 090177e18f141527\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:03-Au g-2018 10:11 (GMT )
Medivation, Inc. 673-301 – Amendment 1 Page 106
FINAL 14Dec2015Non-Measurable Disease
!A lesion is considered evaluable, but not measurable, if it does not meet the 
measurability criteria described above, but which is a manifestation of malignancy 
that can be followed qualitatively as an indicator of disease progression or treatment response. 
oBy [CONTACT_393] v.1.1 definitions, a lymph node that has a short axis diameter of 
10-14 mm is considered evaluable, but not measurable. Nodes with a short axis diameter of <[ADDRESS_221508] or MRI are considered 
evaluable but not measurable for this study
!Non-measurable lesions are those the reviewer strongly believes to be malignant, but 
which do not meet the definitions above.
oBone lesions that are blastic are non-measurable by [CONTACT_108]. Bone lesions 
that are lytic or mixed lytic-blastic, which have soft tissue components seen on CT or MRI, and which meet size criteria above, may be measurable.
oSimple cysts are considered benign by [CONTACT_15094]. Cystic metastases may be 
considered measurable, but solid lesions are preferred for selection as target.
oMalignant ascites or pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitic infiltration of 
skin or lung, leptomeningeal disease, inflammatory breast disease, and infiltrative disease without clear borders are all examples of disease considered intrinsically non-measurable.
!Lesions seen on nuclear medicine bone scan, or modalities other than CT or MRI 
(plain X-ray [with the exception for lung lesions noted above], positron emission 
tomography [PET], etc.) cannot be measured. These modalities can be used only to determine whether a lesion is present or absent.
!Previous local treatment: A previously irradiated lesion (or lesion subjected to other 
local treatment) is non-measurable unless it has progressed since completion of previous treatment.
24.3.4 Baseline Lesion Selection and Documentation
!Target lesions will be chosen from among the measurable lesions. The lesions chosen 
should be the largest, most reproducible, and most representative of the overall 
disease distribution. 
!All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions total, and 2 lesions per organ, 
should be selected as target lesions. Paired organs (lungs, kidneys, adrenals, ovaries) 
are considered one organ. The lymph nodes collectively are considered one organ.090177e18f003b15\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:23-Jul-2018 11:08 (GMT ) 090177e18f141527\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:03-Au g-2018 10:11 (GMT )
Medivation, Inc. 673-301 – Amendment 1 Page 107
FINAL 14Dec2015!Non-nodal target lesions are measured in the longest diameter in the axial plane (on 
CT or MR). Malignant lymph nodes are always measured in the short axis diameter 
(greatest dimension perpendicular to the longest diameter). The appropriate measurements for all target lesions chosen at baseline will be added to produce the recorded sum of diameters, which will be recorded.
!Other disease present at baseline should be recorded as ‘Non-target lesions’. Multiple 
non-target lesions in a single organ can be recorded as one entry during assessment, 
as non-target lesions are assessed as a whole during follow-up.
24.3.5 Assessment of Response
The overall response for each visit is a combination of target lesion response, non-target 
lesion response, and the presence or absence of new lesions. 
!Target lesions measurements should be performed in the same manner as at 
baseline. The sum of diameters of all target lesions must be calculated, and compared to the baseline value and to the nadir value (the smallest value previously seen during the trial, which may be the same as baseline). The following special rules apply to lesion measurements:
oIf two target lesions coalesce the longest diameter measurement of the 
coalesced mass is used. If a large target lesion splits, the longest diameter of each fragment is measured, and the sum is used.
oMeasurements for target lesions that become small should continue to be 
recorded, as long as the Reviewer is confident in the accuracy. If a target lesion is considered to have completely disappeared, 0 mm should be recorded. If it is too small to measure accurately, but is still present, a default value of 5 mm should be recorded.
oWhen nodal lesions decrease to <10 mm (normal), the actual measurement 
should still be recorded.
!Target lesion response categories are defined as follows
oComplete response (CR): Disappearance of all non-nodal target lesions. 
Target lymph nodes must reduce to < 10 mm in short axis
oPartial response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of 
target lesions, compared to the sum at baseline.
oProgressive disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of target lesion 
measurements, compared to the smallest sum on study (including baseline). Also, the absolute increase in the sum has to be at least 5 mm.090177e18f003b15\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:23-Jul-2018 11:08 (GMT ) 090177e18f141527\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:03-Au g-2018 10:11 (GMT )
Medivation, Inc. 673-301 – Amendment 1 Page 108
FINAL 14Dec2015oStable disease (SD): Neither PR nor PD criteria are met. 
SD can follow PR only in rare cases, when the sum increases by [CONTACT_4736] 20% from the nadir, but enough that a previously seen 30% decrease from baseline no longer holds. 
oNon Evaluable (NE): One or more target lesions cannot be assessed because 
assessment methods are not comparable to baseline (e.g., change of modality), lesion visibility is poor due to image quality or lesion features (except where the lesion is too small to measure), or one or more lesions that were excised or locally irradiated have not reappeared or increased; and the other lesions do not show sufficient growth to qualify for PD on their own.
!Non-target lesion response assessment is qualitative. Categories are defined as 
follows
oCR: Disappearance of all non-nodal non-target lesions. Non-target lymph 
nodes must reduce to < 10 mm in short axis
oPD: Unequivocal progression of non-target lesions, evaluated as a whole, 
such that it is clear that treatment has failed and disease is progressing, regardless of the status of the target lesions
oNon-CR/Non-PD: Neither CR nor PD criteria are met.
oNE: One or more non-target lesions cannot be assessed because assessment
methods are not comparable to baseline (e.g., change of modality), lesion visibility is poor due to image quality or lesion features (except where the lesion is too small to measure), or one or more lesions that were excised or locally irradiated have not reappeared or increased; and the other lesions do not show sufficient growth to qualify for PD on their own.
!New lesion response is classified as present or not (“Yes” or “No”). The response is 
“Yes” if there is at least one lesion that the reviewer considers unequivocal new 
tumor.
oLesions that are equivocal (for example, due to small size) should not be 
considered new until they are confirmed by [CONTACT_187706]. Once confirmed, they can be retrospectively called new lesions at the time they were first seen.
oA lesion identified in an area not previously scanned is considered a new 
lesion.
oNew lesions seen on nuclear medicine bone scans should be confirmed using 
anatomical imaging, whenever possible. If bone lesions are confirmed on later CT or MRI scan, progression should be assigned to the visit in which new lesion(s) were first seen on bone scan (in a manner similar to other equivocal new lesions). In the absence of structural confirmation, the pattern of lesions must clearly indicate metastasis, usually with at least two new lesions present.090177e18f003b15\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:23-Jul-2018 11:08 (GMT ) 090177e18f141527\0.1\Draft\Versioned On:03-Au g-2018 10:11 (GMT )

two new lesions present.
!After all visits have been evaluated, the sequence of overall visit responses is used to 
derive progression-free survival (PFS), best overall response (BOR), and duration of response (DOR).
oPFS is defined as the time from randomization until the date of radiologic 
progressive disease (per RECIST v.1.1 with modifications) as determined by [CONTACT_187708], whichever occurs first.
oBOR is defined as the best visit response recorded from the start of the 
treatment until disease progression/recurrence. 
RECIST v.1.1 states that confirmation of a BOR of PR or CR is 
required only for non-randomized trials in which response rate is the primary endpoint. Thus, confirmation is not required in this trial.

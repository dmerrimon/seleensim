Protocol Test Abstract: 
This study is designed to evaluate  the trending accuracy of a noninvasive regional oximetry measurement of 
somatic oxygen saturation. One investigational sensor (INVSENSO R00038) will be placed on the somatic site of the 
volunteer. The values obtained by [CONTACT_138478]-
cleared sensor placed on the somatic site on the contralateral side. 
 Data will be collected from healthy adult subjects while underg oing a desaturation procedure wherein the 
concentration of oxygen inhaled is slowly reduced until the sub ject’s oxygen saturation is approximately 70%.  The 
subject will then be returned to inhaling room air.

1. PURPOSE 
This study is designed to evaluate the trending accuracy of O3 system’s measurement of oxygen saturation in 
somatic sites.     The INVSENSOR00038 is Masimo’s O3 systemm, which has been clear ed by [CONTACT_138480]2 measurements in the 
cerebral tissue. The INVSENSOR00038 is identical to the current ly FDA-cleared neonatal O3 sensor and is made with 
with the same materials, optical components and is considered a n investigational device when placed over skeletal 
muscle. The values obtained by [CONTACT_138481]00038 will be compa red to reference values. 
 This is a nonrandomized study wherein all subjects receive both  the somatic sensor (INVSENSOR00038) and one 
FDA-cleared device sensor.  Data using the sensors will be coll ected from healthy volunteers undergoing a 
desaturation procedure. Desaturation will be conducted by [CONTACT_138482] a controlled manner to obtain noninvasive regional oxygen saturation readings, rSO
2, at various levels.  
Outcome Measure:  
This study will evaluate the trending accuracy of the INVSENSOR [ADDRESS_157439] applications in the operating 
room, critical care unit, emergency room, emergency transport v ehicles, as well as physician’s offices. 
 
2.1. Technology Background 
Regional oximetry is a noninvasive technology for measuring the  level of oxygenation in deep tissue (rSO2). 
To arrive at their measurements, regional oximeters use Near In frared Spectroscopy (NIRS), which is based 
on the Beer Lambert Law.  
For cerebral oximetry, multiple detectors and emitters are util ized to provide multiple pathways for the light 
to travel through the tissue. Software algorithms then process the received light signals to provide an 
oxygenation measurement.

 In addition to assessing brain oxygenation, the O3 system can b e used to for oxygenation measurement in 
somatic sites. The oxygenation of somatic tissue can be used cl inically in applicable medical, surgical, and 
trauma patients.  
2.2. Study Devices 
Investigational sensors : INVSENSOR00038 
The INVSENSOR00038 is a system which includes Masimo’s O3 neona tal sensor and Masimo’s O3 module. 
The sensor used in this study is a modification to the applicat ion of Masimo’s O3 neonatal line of sensors 
which is currently FDA cleared for application to the forehead.  This sensor will be used in conjunction with 
the Masimo O3 module that is currently cleared for clinical use  on adult and pediatric cerebral tissue in the 
US and EU countries.  The O3 module will be used with the Root monitor that will be used to collect data 
from the new application site during this study. 
 
FDA Cleared Sensors and Devices: 
Masimo Root Patient Monitoring Platform: Root is a patient moni toring and connectivity platform that 
offers rainbow® and Masimo SET® measurements with other parameters in an integrated platform. With 
docking capabilities for the Radical-7® handheld monitor and multiple networking/connectivity options,  Root 
integrates multiple streams of data into one display monitor.  
 
FDA Cleared Comparator Device 
The FDA cleared comparator device provides real-time monitoring  of changes in regional oxygen saturation 
(rSO2) of blood in the brain or other body tissues beneath the sensor. The system utilizes near-infrared light 
at wavelengths that are absorbed by [CONTACT_33308]. Light travels f rom the sensor’s light emitting diode to a 
proximal and a distal detector, permitting data processing of t he optical signals.  
The output measurement is a real-time rSO2.

 ii. Incomplete study or early termination where desaturation protoc ol could not be 
completed.  
iii. Reference device malfunctions, provides inconsistent saturation  values. 
iv. Discontinuities and abrupt dropouts due to instruments recalibr ation or device failure.  
v. Low signal quality (e.g. due to noise or interference). 
9.2.2.  Relative error and trend accuracy calculations 
In order to compute error, discrete time points along the conti nuous trances will be selected 
in a consistent fashion. The data points will be selected with a minimum of 5 min interval. 
Relative error in rSO2 is computed on a sensor by [CONTACT_32799] (i.e. subject by [CONTACT_1130]) basis. 
Relative error is defined to be the relative difference of the test sensor and reference sensor 
rSO2. 
Trending Accuracy is defined as root-mean-squared relative erro r of discrete data points 
across subjects. 
9.3. Measures taken to minimize/avoid bias: 
Sensors and devices will be provided to operators in a way that  minimizes the operator bias. Sensors 
and devices will be provided at random when deemed necessary.   
9.4. Expected drop out rates 
Subjects may not complete the study for various reasons, such a s a clinical screening test failure, 
unable to complete desaturation (less than 90 %SpO2).   
Expected drop out rate for this study is approximately 50% of t he total number of subjects enrolled.

12.3 Return or Destruction of Study Device 
At the completion of the study, there will be a final reconcili ation of study devices and sensors 
shipped, devices/sensors used, and devices/sensors remaining.  This reconciliation will be logged on 
the device accountability log.  Any discrepancies noted will be  investigated, resolved, and 
documented prior to return or destruction of unused study devic es.  Devices destroyed on site will 
only be upon written instruction from the sponsor and will be d ocumented in the study files. 
13. RISKS AND BENEFITS 
13.1. Benefits: There will be no benefit to the subject.  Other possi ble benefits would be to society as a 
whole.  Evaluation of the trend accuracy of this new device cou ld enable healthcare workers to 
more appropriately treat potentially life threatening condition s. 
13.2. Device Risks: The noninvasive devices used in this study are si milar in technology and design to 
some commercially available regional oximeters and other non-in vasive devices and hence have the 
same risks.  Regional oximiters oximeters and other non-invasiv e devices are commonly used and 
are considered to be minimal risk.  There is an extremely small  risk of damage to the subject’s skin 
including temporary skin irritation or discomfort associated wi th exposure to the sensor as well as 
potential temporary mechanical irritation or discomfort.  There  is a remote, yet possible, risk of a 
burn from the sensor. In the case of a sensor burn there is the  potential for permanent skin damage 
(scar/discoloration). 
13.3. Venous Cannulation Risks: swelling, infection, infiltration of fluids/ blood into area surrounding IV, 
bruising, hematoma, lightheadedness, fainting, feeling flush/wa rm, feeling nauseated, throwing up,

 sudden drop in blood pressure/sudden increase in blood pressure , sudden drop in heart 
rate/sudden increa se in heart rate, tingl ing sensation of face,  arms and/or legs, sweating, mouth 
dryness, damage to the blood  vessel and surrounding nerves or t issue. 
13.4. Other anticipated adverse events that may occur, include but ar e not limited to: vasovagal (passing 
out/fainting), infection to the skin or area right below the sk in, lightheadedness, feeling flush/ warm, 
feeling nauseated, throwing up, seizures, sudden drop in blood pressure/ sudden increase in blood 
pressure, sudden drop in h eart rate/ sudden increase in heart r ate, tingling sensation of face/arms 
and/or sweating, and mouth dryness.  These anticipated adverse events are expected to be 
temporary. 
13.5. Risk From Oxygen Administration:  There are no risks associated  with high oxygen/oxygen 
administration for less than [ADDRESS_157461]’s answers on the health qu estionnaire will help the medical staff 
decide if they can safely participate in this study; subjects a re encouraged to let the study staff know 
if they have any concerns. 
13.6. Low Oxygen Concentration Risks: Risks associated with hypoxia i nclude dizziness, shortness of 
breath, drowsiness, or headache. If or when this occurs, the st udy can be stopped. There is an 
extremely small risk of loss of consciousness, damage to vital organs, or death from lack of oxygen. 
The study shall be stopped by [CONTACT_138495] g before this could occur.  Other 
anticipated adverse events that may occur, include but are not limited to:  vasovagal (passing 
out/fainting), lightheadedness, feeling nauseated, throwing up,  seizures, sudden drop in blood 
pressure/sudden increase in blood pressure, sudden drop in hear t rate/sudden increase in heart 
rate, tingling sensation of face, arms and/or legs, sweating, m outh dryness.  These anticipated 
adverse events are expected to be temporary. 
13.7. Nose Clip Risks: It is expected that some people will have disc omfort/ pi[INVESTIGATOR_38633]/ scratches from 
wearing a nose clip. If this occurs, adjustments can be made an d/or the study can be stopped. 
13.8. Risk from Inflicted Knowledge: The risk of inflicted medical kn owledge to subjects is negligible since 
we deidentify all associated sample information including those  relevant to our clinical and 
engineering parameter studies.  The monitoring and test results  are not examined for diagnostic 
purposes and do not reflect an attempt to ascertain any subject 's medical condition.  The attending 
physician's role during this study is to ensure the safety of t he subject during the study. Subjects are 
informed that these are not diagnostic tools, if observations a re made using FDA cleared devices we 
will refer them to their primary care physician. 
13.9. Risk From Loss of Confidentiality: Masimo upholds the highest s tandards to protect hard and 
electronic data however, a complete promise for confidentiality  cannot be guaranteed due to 
unforeseeable events. 
13.10.  Risk From Additional Testing: 
13.11.1.  During the conduct of the study, it is possible, but not likely , that someone could become 
exposed to the sample of blood drawn from the subject through a n inadvertent needle 
stick or by [CONTACT_138496]. In such circumstances, it  will be important to the 
exposed individual to know whether the blood to which he or she  was exposed contained 
Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or  Hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
and additional testing of the sample will be performed.

 I. OBJECTIVES  
Summary.  Through the proposed K99/R00  studies, [CONTACT_158378] will receive direct training in 
communications and tobacco regulatory science, and application of this knowledge to mentored research to 
develop and gain skills necessary to develop anti -tobacco messages that effectively communicate the risks of 
polytobacco use to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender polytobacco users.  Using a conceptual model 
based on the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM)1-[ADDRESS_184008] framework4 we will develop  
and refine anti-tobacco messages targeting young adult polytobacco users ; specifically, lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
and transgender young adults —a polytobacco use disparities population (Aim  1, Phases 1 and 2). 
Brief Background. Between 21 -40% of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) young adults 
(YA)5-8 (vs 12- 21% of non -LGBT YA9,10) report polytobacco use, defined as using more  than  one 
tobacco product  including electronic  nicotine  delivery  systems  (ENDS ). This difference  is alarming as 
polytobacco use is associated with nicotine dependence11 and continued tobacco use12-16 into adulthood, which 
may widen existing tobacco disparities.17 Markedly low tobacco risk perceptions8,18-24 among LGBT YA may 
reinforce polytobacco use.25 National anti -tobacco communications are a successful strategy for increasing 
public knowledge about tobacco health risks and decreasing tobacco use;26-29 however,  they may not engage  
YA LGBT  polytobacco  users  for two reasons:  First,  existing  YA anti-tobacco communications  are not 
framed  to specifically address polytobacco  use risks.  Second,  LGBT  populations report  low 
engagement  with non- targeted anti-tobacco  communications.30,31 The proposed  study  will use 
experimental methods  to address  these  concerns . This proposal directly supports the FDA’s mandate to 
educate the public about the risks of tobacco32 by [CONTACT_158351] : The study goal is to determine effective communication of polytobacco use risk to 
at-risk LGBT YA . We propose to:   
Aim 1 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Identify  absolute and relative  risk anti-tobacco  messages  that effectively  communicate 
polytobacco risks to LGBT young adults (K99).  Hypothesis:  Messages emphasizing relative (vs absolute) risk 
of polytobacco use will most effectively increase tobacco risk perceptions. Hypothesis:  AR and RR messages 
emphasizing quit efficacy will increase intentions to quit all tobacco while AR and RR messages emphasizing 
switch efficacy will increase intentions to switch to exclusive ENDS use.  
 
Aim 2  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . Determine the effects of cultural targeting on LGBT young adult polytobacco users’ 
attention to anti -tobacco  messages and perceived effectiveness (K99).  Hypothesis: Exposure to culturally 
targeted messages will result in greater engagement with and perceived effectiveness of anti -polytobacco 
messages among LGBT YA.   
 
Aim 3. ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) (a) Assess the feasibility  of delivering MMS anti-tobacco messages developed in the 
K99 to LGBT young adults via texting; and (b)  Estimate  effect  sizes of exposure  to anti-tobacco messages  on 
risk perceptions  and tobacco use over time (R00). Hypothesis : LGBT young adult polytobacco users exposed 
to any anti-tobacco  messages (vs not exposed) will report greater risk perceptions and reduced tobacco use.  
 
 
A team of exceptional NIH -funded researchers will provide mentorship for the proposed K99/R00  mentored 
research : Amy Ferketich, a tobacco prevention and control expert, with experience leading health 
communications studies to inform tobacco regulatory policy will provide primary mentorship with collaborative support from a team of co- mentors. This team is comprised of Elizabeth Klein and Darren Mays  who are 
experts in leveraging psychophysiological measurement for health communications studies; and Theodore

II. BACKGROUND and RATIONALE  
This K99/R00  proposal addresses the FDA research priority area of Communications.  The rationale for 
the scientific aims is the following. While tobacco regulation has contributed to steady declines in combustible 
tobacco use, there has been a marked increase in the use of novel tobacco products, including electronic 
nicotine delivery systems (ENDS).6,[ADDRESS_184009] 
including ENDS, is increasing34 and is high in LGBT populations.5,21,35- 37 Between 22- 40% of LGBT young 
adults (YA)5-7 (vs 12 -21% of non -LGBT YA9,10) report past 30- day polytobacco use. This is concerning as many 
polytobacco users progress to exclusively using combustible tobacco.38,39 Both LGBT people8 and polytobacco 
users8,18- 24 are also less likely to perceive tobacco as harmful, which may reinforce tobacco use.25 The Food 
and Drug  Administration  (FDA)  Center  for Tobacco Products  (CTP)  is mandated to educate the public about 
the risks of tobacco products.26-29,[ADDRESS_184010]  specifically addressed polytobacco use. Existing  campaigns 
(e.g., The Real Cost , This Free Life) focused on communicating absolute risks  (AR) of specific tobacco 
products (e.g., “cigarette smoking leads to lung cancer”)  with the goal of preventing uptake in non -users or 
experimental users. YA polytobacco users have established tobacco patterns, so anti -tobacco  campaign goals 
must also aim to: (1) prevent uptake of additional products, and (2) promote total tobacco cessation, or (3) 
harm reduction53 by [CONTACT_158352], like ENDS.54,55 The FDA’s regulatory plan places tobacco 
products on a risk continuum,[ADDRESS_184011] of relative risk  (RR) communications 
(e.g., “cigarettes contain 9 times more cancer -causing chemicals than ENDS) on risk perceptions and tobacco 
use.57-59 Among smokers, RR communications increase intentions to quit smoking58 and switch to ENDS.57,58 
RR messages may also influence quitting and switching behaviors in polytobacco users.  
Targeting  is a broadly  supported communications strategy40 to increase engagement  with anti-tobacco  
communications. LGBT  adults  engage less with anti-tobacco campaigns  than heterosexuals;30,[ADDRESS_184012] been leveraged in health campaigns targeting LGBT people,66,67 including This Free Life , 
the FDA’s first anti-tobacco campaign for LGBT YA who occasionally smoke.68 The campaign’s  culturally 
targeted smoking prevention messages reached perceived effectiveness ratings similar to prior youth49,[ADDRESS_184013] tested  if LGBT culturally targeted (vs non -targeted) 
messages are more engaging or effective for reducing polytobacco use.71 Targeted anti -tobacco  campaigns 
THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY       RESEARCH PROTOCOL V8

LAST VERSION APPROVAL: 08/ 15/2023 (V7) 
VERSION APPROVAL:  11/20/[ADDRESS_184014] effectively engage audiences.  If cultural 
targeting does not increase engagement and effectiveness of anti -tobacco messages, then the FDA 
may be able to reach at -risk LGBT people via campaigns targeting YA more generally .  
A conceptual model based on the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM)1-[ADDRESS_184015] 
framework4 will guide the proposed research (Figure 2).  Together they posit that, upon exposure to anti -
tobacco messages, a person proceeds through three steps: attention, reaction, and formation of attitudes and 
intentions. These steps determine whether a person engages in the behavior promoted in the message.75 The 
EPPM includes four key variables: perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, response efficacy and self -
efficacy.25,76 The model predicts that messages which cause a high perceived threat and high efficacy will 
result in action (quitting, switching). The effectiveness of high threat58,77,78 messages for behavior change 
is well established; however, less is known about how to effectively frame efficacy messages. Prior anti-tobacco  campaigns have omitted efficacy statements entirely
1 or encouraged tobacco 
avoidance/cessation.28,[ADDRESS_184016] applied combination efficacy messages that emphasize total tobacco cessation, while stating that if smokers are not ready to quit, switching to exclusive ENDS use can reduce health risks.
58,80 However, combined quit/switch messages may be confusing for users.81 We will 
investigate optimal framing of threat/efficacy messages to communicate absolute and relative risk of 
polytobacco use.   
Bio-behavioral methods may be used to objectively quantify attention to culturally targeted anti -
tobacco messages.  Studies using self -report after anti -tobacco message exposure have revealed important 
information about behavioral intentions to use tobacco27,82- 84; however, self -report outcomes are subject to 
social desirability bias85 and can be enhanced by [CONTACT_68790]- behavioral methods.86-88 More specifically, 
psychophysiological measures can clarify which messages capture polytobacco users’ attention (eye- tracking) 
and evoke emotional responses (skin conductance) .[ADDRESS_184017] demonstrated effectiveness  for increasing 
cessation in YA smokers95-97 and preliminary  efficacy97 for changing risk perceptions  and behaviors  in YA 
waterpi[INVESTIGATOR_158330]. It is possible that anti-tobacco  mobile  multimedia  messages  (i.e., text plus graphic;  MMS) 
may be similarly  applied to communicate polytobacco use risks and reduce  polytobacco  use in LGBT  YA. Over  
96% of YA own a mobile  device with MMS,98 and 75% use it to seek  health information.99 By [CONTACT_158353]-

A. K99/R00  Research Design Overview   
Using qualitative and experimental designs, the proposed K99/R00 research is scientifically rigorous in its 
application of formative and summative evaluation.100 Aims are synergistic and focused on developi[INVESTIGATOR_158331]-tobacco messages for LGBT YA. Aim  1 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  is formative evaluation and 
focus es on optimal message framing for AR and RR anti-tobacco  messages . Aim 1  outcomes are presented in 
Table 1.  
NOTE: Aim 1 studies (Phase 1 and 2) have been proposed and approved. As the K99 is transitioning to 
the R00 phase (August 2022), we are now proposing the Aim 2 formative focus groups and Aim 2 eye-
tracking study ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . Amendments will be submitted for the future A im [ADDRESS_184019]  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED];

(K99 Grant Year 1)  In Aim 1 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED])  we will develop anti -tobacco  messages  and assess 
effectiveness .  
 
In Aim 1 Phase 1,  we will use multi -methods to gain feedback on textual anti -tobacco messages and gain 
insights about visual elements (images, fonts, colors) that are appealing to young adult polytobacco users. 
Phase 1 studies will include the following:  
 
• Aim 1, Phase 1 : Study 1 – FOCUS GROUPS  will explore terminology and message themes 
used in absolute and relative risk anti-tobacco  messages and quit/switch efficacy statements

 • Aim 1, Phase 1 : Study 2 – ONLINE RATING SURVEY  will quantitatively assess how young 
adults rate absolute and relative  polytobacco risk messages and quit/switch efficacy statements 
for perceived effectiveness and reactance  
 
• Aim 1, Phase 1 : Study 3 – IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS will explore qualitatively how young adults 
perceive 8 absolute risk and 8 relative  risk anti -tobacco messages.  
Aim 1,  Phase 1: Study 1 – FOCUS GROUPS:  Focus group participants will be asked to share their opi[INVESTIGATOR_158332] -tobacco messages  (Table 2) . Anti-tobacco risk statements will pe presented in two 
sets; communicating either absolute (e.g., “ tobacco smoke contains 69 cancer -causing chemicals, including 
arsenic and formaldehyde”) or relative risk (e.g., “combustible tobacco products contain 9 times more cancer -
causing chemicals than ENDS) . Messages will address FDA -regulatory topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]106; for example: addiction, toxic 
exposure, and health effects (see supplemental documents  for sample risk statements).  We will then 
present examples of efficacy statements including quit only ( e.g., “Quit all tobacco products to reduce health 
risks.” ), switch only (e.g., “Switch to using e-cigarettes  to reduce health risks.” ), or quit plus switch messages 
(e.g., “Quit all tobacco products to reduce your risk of cancer. If you’re not ready to quit, switch to e -cigarettes  
only.”). Focus group feedback will be used to further develop text for anti- tobacco messages that will be further 
tested in Aim 1, Phase 2  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). ( see supplemental documents A for sample efficacy 
statements).  Focus group participants will also be asked to provide feedback on the acceptability, appeal, and 
comprehension of specific terms (e.g., “traditional cigarettes” vs. “combustible cigarettes”, “e- cigarettes” vs. 
“nicotine vapes” vs “vapes”).  
 
 
To assess graphics that are appealing to using adult 
polytobacco users, we will present examples of existing  
anti-tobacco messages from  FDA and Truth  anti-tobacco 
campaigns  (see samples in supplemental documents) . 
We will ask focus group participants to identify the graphic components that are more and less appealing from 
existing anti -tobacco  ads. We will use focus group 
feedback to add visual elements to the textual anti -
tobacco messages that will be further tested in Aim 1, 
Phase 2. Graphics will mirror visual styles of existing 
campaigns107 using bold colors and images of YA108 to 
represent topi[INVESTIGATOR_158333]. Messages and images 
will be refined based on focus group feedback. 
 
Aim 1, Phase 1: Study 2 – ONLINE RATING SURVEY : In Phase 1, Study [ADDRESS_184020] an online survey 
to quantitatively examine young adults ’ perceptions of 8 absolute risk and 8 relative  risk anti -tobacco 
messages and quit/switch efficacy statements. To reduce participant burden, each participant will view a 
random sample of messages as follows: n = 5 absolute and relative  risk anti-tobacco messages  (of N = 24) , 
and n = 3 (of N = 12) efficacy messages . They will be asked to rate absolute and relative  risk antitobacco 
messages and quit/switch efficacy statements for perceived message effectiveness, likeability, and reactance.  
 
Aim 1, Phase 1: Study 3 – IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS: Interviewees will be asked to share their reactions to  the 
24 textual anti -tobacco messages tested in Study 2. Specifically, interviewees will be asked to rate their top 5  
(of N =12) absolute risk  and top 5 (of N =12) relative  risk antitobacco messages. We will then qualitatively 
explore their rationale for their top 5 selected messages.

 Aim 1, Phase 2: ONLINE FACTORIAL EXPERIMENT  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) : Using a 2x3 factorial experiment 
(Table 2), plus control group design we will test the influence of AR and R R message framing on perceived 
effectiveness, tobacco risk perceptions, and behavioral intentions in young adult  ever polytobacco user s. 
Participants will be randomized to one of 8 conditions, including 6 experimental  sets of AR and RR anti-
tobacco messages( Table 3) and a control set of AR or RR regulatory control messages . We will present 8 
messages within each experimental and control set.  An expert panel of scientists, selected and invited by [CONTACT_158355], will review all messages, which we will further refine based on expert feedback prior to testing 
in Aim 1, Phase 2 ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). 
 
B.1 Sample 
Participants for  Aim 1, Phase 1 studies  will be young adults ( age 18- 35 years) who live in the [LOCATION_002].  
and are susceptible to multiple nicotine and tobacco product use (i.e.,  have used combustible tobacco or  e-
cigarettes at least once ).  
In the Aim 1 Phase 1 focus groups and interviews, participants expressed concern that relative risk messages 
comparing combustible cigarette and ENDS use could increase young adult non -users' curiosity and intentions 
to use ENDS. The goal of anti -tobacco m essages being tested in this study is to increase harm perceptions 
and decrease use intentions among susceptible nicotine and tobacco users, However, we also do not want to negatively impact nonusers. After conferring with the mentoring committee and scien tific experts, in Phase 2, 
we will address this concern by [CONTACT_62866][INVESTIGATOR_158334]. As such, our sample will include young adults ( age 18- 35 years) who 
live in the [LOCATION_002]. Per the Aim 1, Phase [ADDRESS_184021] use (i.e.,  have used combustible tobacco or  e-cigarettes at 
least once) and half of the sample will comprise U.S. young adult nonusers.  
For Aim 1 , Phase 1 , Study 1 --FOCUS GROUPS: T he maximum overall sample size will be N = 58. However, 
our analytic sample size  will start with 3 focus groups of size 6 -8 individuals  (N = 18 -24 total participants). This 
sample size is standard in “usability research,” where existing messages are tested to uncover issues of effectiveness, and newly designed prototypes are tested to improve any communication issues. If we do not 
reach thematic saturation, we will conduct additional focus groups until thematic saturation is achieved, up to a 
total analytic sample size of N =  [ADDRESS_184022] inflated the overall sample size to 29 participants for 
each round of focus groups (N = 58) to allow for 20% dropout.    
 
Recruitment will occur online via social media,  on OSU’s campus , and in the Columbus community. On 
campus, we will reach out to student groups and we will place flyers in residence halls and other buildings. We 
have used these methods in the past with success. We will also work with the Office of Minority Health at 
Columbus Public Health to reach a racially, ethnically, and economically diverse group of young men and 
women. Co-investigator Ferketich has  partnered with this office in the past and they have helped successfully 
recruit young people through their community connections. We will also partner with The Equitas Health 
Institute to reach LGBT young adults. Both the PI (Patterson) and Co- I (Ferketich) have relationships with The 
Equitas Health Institute through the College of Publi c Health. Focus groups will be balanced by [CONTACT_158356]. 
 
Aim 1, Phase 1 : Study 2 – ONLINE RATING SURVEY: T he overall sample size  will be N = 550.  Participants 
will be recruited via Prolific ( https://www.prolific.co/), a platform for online subject recruitment for research, 
which is supported by [CONTACT_158357]. In recent years, Prolific has been extensively

young adults into survey studies, approximately 3% of survey participants had inconsistencies between the 
prescreening questions asked by [CONTACT_158358] (e.g., age range) and demographic questions reported as part of the 
survey (e.g., numerical age). Data for these participants was not included in analyses, as we could not confir m 
that they met study eligibility criteria. As our analytic sample size  is N = 500 participants; we have inflated our 
overall sample size is inflated by 10% to account for estimated inconsistencies between prescreening and 
survey responses.  
We will monitor enrollment with the goal of recruiting a balance of young adult participants by [CONTACT_654] (younger: age 18- 25, older: age 26 -35), gender, and sexual orientation. From current population- based estimates, we 
expect that study participants will be 57% non -Hispanic white, 19% non- Hispanic black, 15% Hispanic, and 6% 
Asian, and the remaining representing other race groups.  
As of October 2021, there are 11,[ADDRESS_184024] ever used nicotine or tobacco. Of these, 3,374 identify as women; 4465 identify as NOT heterosexual (i.e., 
homosexual, bisexual, other non- heterosexual sexual orientation), and 472 identify as transgender or 
nonbinary/genderqueer.  
 
Aim 1, Phase 1 : Study 3 – IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS. For interviews, the maximum overall sample size  will be 
N = 2 0. However, our initial analytic sample size will be N = [ADDRESS_184025] additional interviews until thematic saturation is achieved, up to a total analytic 
sample size of N = [ADDRESS_184026] inflated the overall sample size to 20  participants to allow for 20% 
dropout.    
 
Recruitment will occur online via social media, via email listservs, on OSU’s campus, and in the Columbus 
community . We will invite prior focus group participants to participate in in- depth interviews.  On campus, we 
will reach out to student groups and we will place flyers in residence halls and other buildings. We have used 
these methods in the past with success. We will also partner with The Equitas Health Institute to reach LGBT 
young adults. Both the PI (Patterson) and Co- I (Ferketich) have relationships with The Equitas Health Institute 
through the College of Public Health. We will aim to balance interviews  by [CONTACT_158359].  
 
For the Aim 1 , Phase 2 —ONLINE FACTORIAL EXPERIMENT  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) : The overall sample size will 
be N = . 2940. Participants will be recruited via Prolific (https://www.prolific.co/), a platform for online subject 
recruitment for research, which is supported by [CONTACT_158357]. In recent years, 
Prolific has been extensively used in social science research and by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_158335]. Prolific enables 
researchers to recruit participants  to perform tasks such as filling out surveys, opi[INVESTIGATOR_158336], cognitive 
psychological studies, and many others. Researchers advertise their studies on Prolific, and participants 
choose only those studies that interest them. Participants are paid for completing the studies.  In the PI’s  prior

We will monitor enrollment with the goal of recruiting a balance of young adult participants by [CONTACT_654] (younger: 
age 18- 25, older: age 26 -35), gender, and sexual orientation. From current population- based estimates, we 
expect that study participants will be 57 % non -Hispanic white, 1 9% non -Hispanic black, 15% Hispanic, and 6 % 
Asian, and the remaining representing other race groups.  
 
B.2. Measurement / Instrumentation  
For Aim 1, Phase 1 : Study 1 --FOCUS GROUPS: A focus group guide will be developed and will be used to 
facilitate the research for preliminary work. Participants will be asked about their opi[INVESTIGATOR_158337] a series of 
absolute and relative  risk polytobacco use statements, efficacy statements, and visual elements of anti-tobacco  
communication campaigns. Participants will also be asked their thoughts  on the types of images to pair  with 
anti-tobacco risk statements.  
For Aim 1, Phase 1 : Study 2 —ONLINE RATING SURVEY:  Primary outcome measures are presented in Table 
1. Baseline questionnaires will assess EC and combustible tobacco use,[ADDRESS_184027]-viewing 
their randomly assigned messages  participants will be asked to rate each message for perceived message 
effectiveness,70,101  likeability,112 and reactance.104 Finally, sociodemographic questions also include age, 
race/ethnicity, education level, location (state,  zip code, rurality), sexual orientation113 and gender identity.114  
For Aim 1, Phase 1 : Study 3 —IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS:  An interview guide will be developed and will be used 
to facilitate the research. Specifically, interviewees will be asked to rate their top 5 (of N =12) absolute risk and 
top 5 (of N =12) relative  risk antitobacco messages. We will then qualitatively explore their rationale for their 
top 5 selected messages.  We will also ask participants to share their opi[INVESTIGATOR_158338] -tobacco risk statements.  
 
For Aim 1, Phase 2 -ONLINE FACTORIAL EXPERIMENT  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]): Primary outcome measures are 
presented in Table 1. These measures were largely selected from the Tobacco Regulatory Research PhenX 
Toolkit.115,[ADDRESS_184028], and effectiveness of the 
messages. All baseline measures (excluding social media use and prior anti -tobacco message exposure) will 
be asked post -viewing all messages. Finally, sociodemographic questions also include age, race/ethnicity,

 • Our Aim 2 goal is to identify if culturally targeted (CT) or non- targeted (NT) anti -polytobacco messages 
are most effective for engaging LGBT YA. Using the most effective NT messages from Aim 1 (12 RR; 
12 AR), we will create a set of CT messages. Message framing will remain consistent between CT and 
NT messages; however, CT messages will include graphics representing LGBT values per the PI’s 
formative research and extant literature.39,[ADDRESS_184030] for this study and beyond. In the Aim 2 clinical trial  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) , a 
virtual eye -tracking study, participants will be randomized to view CT or NT messages in our virtual lab 
where we will assess eye- tracking, self -reported perceived effectiveness, risk perceptions, and 
behavioral intentions. We aim to determine the effects of cultural targeting on attention to anti -
polytobacco messages and perceived effectiveness among LGBT young adult polytobacco users.  The 
most effective messages (CT or NT) will be tested in Aim 3 for their influence on risk perceptions and 
tobacco use.    
 
• Aim 2 Focus groups:  Focus groups  will take place in -person or online via CarmenZoom in a secure, 
private space. Eligible participants will complete a  verbal informed consent and online baseline survey. 
A PDF of the informed consent will be made available for download as part of the online baseline 
survey. Consent will be reaffirmed prior to commencing discussions and audio- recording. Participants 
will receive $30 for their time.  
• Aim 2 Eve -tracking experiment  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) : The eye- tracking experiment will take place virtually 
using iMotions,  an online platform for remote eye- tracking data collection, and Qualtrics survey 
software. Eligible participants will complete written informed consent via RedCap. A PDF of the 
informed consent will be made available to participants for download. Participants will receive $50 for 
the eye -tracking survey. Participants will be contact[CONTACT_158361] -week after participating for a follow -up 
survey to assess recall. Participants will receive $[ADDRESS_184031] : (1) be 18-35 years old; (2) be able to speak English fluently; (3) an ever 
user of ENDS and  combustible tobacco who currently use ENDS, combustible cigarettes, or both ENDS and 
combustible cigarettes,  (4) self-identify as LGBTQ+, (5) reside in the US ([LOCATION_002]); ( 6) have access to a 
laptop or desktop computer with a camera for virtual eye- tracking, and ( 7) for eye- tracking study only, not have 
problems that would preclude eye- tracking (i.e., no glaucoma, cataracts).   
 
• Focus groups : Using targeted social media, online (i.e., listserv),  and print advertising,41-43 we will recruit 
up to 4 focus groups of 6 -8 LGBT young adults.  
• Virtual e ye-tracking: Using targeted online, social media, print and venue -based engagement ,41-43  and 
crowdsourcing, we will enroll up to N= 300 LGBT YA to ensure our analytic sample size of N=108.  
We will monitor enrollment with the goal of recruiting a balance of young adult participants by [CONTACT_654] 
(younger: age 18- 25, older: age 26 -35), gender, and sexual orientation. From current population- based 
estimates  of LGBT people, we expect that study participants will be 5 8% non -Hispanic white, 1 2% non-
Hispanic black, 20 % Hispanic, and 2 % Asian, and the remaining representing other race groups.  
 
Participants will be recruited using primarily a mix of convenience and snowball sampling, an effective strategy 
with difficult to locate populations, and which the PI [INVESTIGATOR_158339]. Online, we will engage community members via social media and organizational listervs to

C.2 Measurement / Instrumentation  
For Aim 2 focus groups, a focus group guide will be developed and will be used to facilitate the research for 
preliminary work. Focus groups : Via semi -structured interview, we will ask participants about polytobacco use 
patterns, risk perceptions, and responses to CT messages.  
 
For the Aim 2 eye- tracking experiment  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) , outcomes of interest are as follows:  
Primary;  Attention  During

Prescreening and consent. Participants will be recruited from OSU student organizations, flyers on campus, 
Reddit, other social media, or through word of mouth from participants who completed the study. The 
recruitment materials will include a study phone number and an OSU email address that will be set up for the 
study. Individuals who are interested in the study will be asked to take an online screener or, if they have 
questions, to call or email the study email address.    
 
Individuals who are deemed eligible via the online screener will be asked to share their contact [CONTACT_3031]. An 
IRB-approved study team member will contact [CONTACT_158365]. Eligible 
participants will complete a verbal informed consent. The research team member will read the informed consent 
script and verbally explain the online questionnaire and focus group process. The research team member will 
indicate that participation in the questionnaire and focus group is voluntary. The eligible participant will be given 
an opportunity to ask questions and have all questions answered to their satisfaction. Once the eligible participant 
understands the consent form and process, then and only then will the eligible participant be asked to give verbal 
consent. Eligible participants that do not consent will be released at this time.   Consenting participants will be 
emailed the informed consent script for their records. 
 
The research team member will ask eligible and consented participants for an email address for online questionnaire distribution and to send information for the future focus group. After the call has concluded, the research team member will email participants a link to a short questionnaire distributed via Qualtrics with 
questions about tobacco use, intentions to quit smoking, and demographic characteristics.  A PDF copy of the 
informed consent will be available for download as part of the online baseline survey.
 
 
Focus group procedures.  On the day of focus group, OSU IRB approved study personnel will provide an 
opportunity for verbal reconsent immediately preceding the focus group. Prior to audio- recording, the IRB-
approved research team member will re -affirm participant consent. The research team member will indicate 
that participation in the focus group is voluntary and that participants may withdraw participation at any time. 
Eligible participants who do not reaffirm consent to focus group participation will be released at this time.  
 
Focus groups will take place in-person or  online via CarmenZoom  in a secure, private space. A growing body 
of evidence describes the use of web -based videoconferencing platforms —also known as Voice over Internet 
Protocol (VoIP) -mediated technologies (e.g., CarmenZoom, Skype, FaceTime) —for collecting data in

conducting qualitative human subjects research with national samples.  
 
All focus groups will be audio- recorded and transcribed for subsequent analysis. Focus group length is 
anticipated to be about 60- 90 minutes. Audio- recorded data will capture participant’ responses to questions 
about nicotine and tobacco use, public education messages about nicotine and tobacco, and textual and visual elements of LGBT cultural targeting.  
 Sources of Materials : Information from focus groups (conducted via CarmenZoom) will be obtained in this 
study to pre- test culturally targeted anti -polytobacco messages. Focus groups will either be conducted in-
person and audio- recorded or will be conducted remotely using CarmenZoom

F. Aim 2: Virtual Eye- Tracking Experiment  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) Procedures 
Prescreening,  consent , and study procedures :  
  
Participants will complete an online screener via RedCap after viewing a social media ad or flyer, receiving an 
email from participating in another study, or via word- of-mouth from other participants. Eligibility screeners will 
include ‘nedCAPTCHA’, a module that provides the use of a classic image CAPTCHA with distorted text, a 
math problem, or a custom question/answer challenge. These CAPTCHAs are similar to the ‘I am not a robot’ 
button or the ‘Click all of the traffic lights’ CAPTCHAs often seen in onli ne forms. nedCAPTCHA is highly 
recommended by [CONTACT_158366]. The module will help 
prevent bots from completing surveys. Eligible participants will asked to report an email address and telephone 
number f or future contact [CONTACT_158367].  
  
 
As the eye- tracking component of this survey requires that participants complete the survey on a laptop or 
desktop with a webcam, we will include a question at the end of the eligibility screener asking participants if 
they are currently participating on a desktop/laptop with webcam. If participants meet all other eligibility criteria, 
but they are taking the screener on a device other than a laptotop or desktop with webcam (e.g,. a tablet or 
smart phone), they will be directed to the following opt -in state ment: “I have a desktop computer or laptop but I 
am currently on my phone or tablet. Please email me a link to the consent form and I will complete the iMotions 
task on my laptop/desktop.” Research study staff will then contact [CONTACT_158368], 
phone call or text to complete the informed consent and participate in the online eye- tracking experiment. After 
reviewing the consent form, participants will be asked to electronically indicate their consent to participate. 
Online cons ent will be documented in REDCap.  
  
If eligible participants indicate that they are currently taking the eligibility screener on a laptop or desktop with webcam, they will be immediately directed to an informed consent describing the study purpose and detail

collected via iMotions, a secure, online data collection platform. No self -report or eye- tracking data collected 
are directly linked to participant identifying information: self -report and eye- tracking data collected through 
iMotions are tracked using a unique, numeric participant identifier. Remote eye tracking is performed through 
the respondent 's own webcam and allows for recording and analysis of responses to images tracking visual 
attention. Webcam recordings of facial data will be recorded and stored within the I -motions software. Post -
participation, the data will be downloaded.  Facial recording data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_158370]- related purposes only, and will not be used for analysis. All survey and eye -tracking data will be

collected and stored in RedCap and linked to the participant’s personal identifier. At the conclusion of the study, all facial recognition data will be deleted. 
V.R
ISKS, BENEFITS, SAFETY PLANS
A.R isks associated with the study
Potential risks are minimal for the focus group and survey studies. Some of the questions may upset individuals;
however, we have used these questions and procedures in many previous studies without upsettin g
p
articipants. A potential  risk is loss of confidentiality  In our screener, we collect participant contact [CONTACT_3031].
Also, iMotions eye -tracking software saves facial data to track eye movements; however, this information will
onl
y be used to track participant compliance to study procedures, will not be used during data analysis, and will
be deleted upon study completion. We will not use facial recording information for any other purpose, and
because all study data including facial recording is stored on a secure password- protected University -
sponsored laptop, we do not believe this represent s an increase in risk for study participants. Participant
privacy is protected because participants will consent to research before any study activities are performed.Because facial recordings are collected, participants are informed of this at several points throughout the study

effectively communicating tobacco risk to polyto bacco users and at the same time, there is mounting 
evidence that LGBT young adult  polytob acco users , a vulnerable population from a tobacco control 
perspective, are largely misinformed of the risks of combustible tobacco and ENDS  use.  
VI. DATA ANALYSIS  
A. Aim 1, Phase 1: Study 1—FOCUS GROUPS Data Analysis   
For focus groups,  the goal is  to refine messages and determine which images should be matched to the AR 
and RR anti -tobacco  messages. These images will then move on to Aim 1 Phase 2 of this study. We will 
qualitatively summarize the feedback in response to each focus group question.  
 
Sample size justification:  For Aim 1 Phase 1 : Study 1 —FOCUS GROUPS: A  planned analytic sample 
size of N = [ADDRESS_184053] round of 
focus group, we will enroll up to an additional 24 participants (for a maximum analytic of N = 48).The 
sample size was inflated to 29 participants for each round of focus groups to allow for 20% dropout ; 
resul ting in a maximum overall sample size of N = 58 focus group participants.  
 
B. Aim 1, Phase 1: Study 2-ONLINE RATING SURVEY Data Analysis  
For online rating survey data, we will describe mean and median values of participants’ ratings of perceived 
message effectiveness, likeability, and reactance.  
In exploratory analyses, we will l assess whether there are systematic differences in participants’ ratings by [CONTACT_158371] (AR vs RR), gender, LGBT status (vs non -LGBT) , race/ethnicity, age (e.g., 18 -24 vs 25- 35) and 
tobacco user ty pe (e.g., current, former, never polytobacco user). We will test mean differences between 
groups using t -tests or ANOVA. If there are violations of assumptions (e.g., normality) we will test median 
differences between groups using Wilcoxon rank -sum test  (two groups) or Kruskal W allis test (more than 2 
groups).  
We will also run  exploratory regression models to evaluate the effect of risk message type ( e.g., absolute risk 
vs. relative risk)  and efficacy message type (e.g., quit; switch; combination)  on messages on perceived 
message effectiveness, likeability, and reactance; controlling for pro - and anti -tobacco marketing exposure, 
baseline risk and efficacy perceptions and behavioral intentions. For models testing the effect of efficacy

VERSION APPROVAL:  11/20/[ADDRESS_184054] of efficacy message type in each 
model. If so, pairwise t -tests will be conducted, and Holm’s procedure will be used to control Type I error rate.  
 
Sample Size Justification : For Aim 1, Phase 1, Study 2-- ONLINE RATING SURVEY:  An analytic 
sample size  of [ADDRESS_184055] deviation of 1.0 units, the 
study would require a minimum sample size of n =  199 for each group to achieve power  of 80% and 
two-sided significance level of p = .[ADDRESS_184056] a 0.25 unit difference in PME scores with 75% probability 
assuming a significance level of p = 0.1. As multi -group comparisons are exploratory, we believe this a 
prior sample size calculation is appropriate. As our  desired  analytic sample size is N = 5 00 participants 
(n = 25 0 participants per experimental group ; AR vs RR messages ); we have inflated our overall 
sample size is inflated by 10% to account for estimated inconsistencies between prescreening and 
survey responses, resulting in an overall sample size  of N = 550. 
 
C. Aim 1, Phase 1: Study 3—IN -DEPTH INTERVIEWS:  
For in- depth interviews the goal will be to refine messages and determine which images should be matched to 
the AR and RR anti -tobacco messages. These images will then move on to Aim 1 Phase 2 of this study. We 
will qualitatively summarize the feedback in response to each focus group question using rigorous and 
accelerated data reduction (RADaR)  analytic methods.125 Used in  applied research, RADaR organizes 
transcribed textual data from qualitative interviews into data tables; which are then organized and iteratively 
reduced, coded, and analyzed using team -based coding.  
 
Sample size justification:  For Aim 1, Phase 1: Study 3— IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS o ur planned analytic 
sample size  of N = [ADDRESS_184057] existing messages to improve any communication issues. If we do not reach 
thematic saturation, we will enroll additional  participants up to a maximum of N = 16. We have inflated 
the overall sample size to 20 participants to allow for  ~20% dropout.    
 
D. Aim 1, Phase 2: ONLINE FACTORIAL EXPERIMENT  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) Data Analysis  
We will fit linear regression models to evaluate the effect of condition on perceived effectiveness, risk 
perceptions, and behavioral intentions. Covariates will include exposure to pro - and anti -tobacco  marketing, 
and baseline risk perception and behavioral intention items (per respective models). Baseline and post -viewing 
scores may be transformed if violations of assumptions are detected. We will conduct overall F -tests to 
determine if there is an effect of condition in each model. If so, pairwise t -tests will be conducted, and Holm’s 
procedure will be used to control Type I error rate. Exploratory analyses will be conducted to determine if there 
is an interactive effect between Condition x Topic. Responses will be examined by [CONTACT_158372] .

 Sample Size Justification : For the Aim 1, Phase 2 : ONLINE FACTORIAL EXPERIMENT 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) an analytic sample size  of [ADDRESS_184058] 
message in terms of risk perception score with 75% probability assuming the mean score in the best 
group is at least 0.[ADDRESS_184059].  As our analytic sample size is N = 2800 participants (n = 400 participants 
per experimental or control group); we have inflated our overall sample size is inflated by 5% to account 
for estimated inconsistencies between prescreening and survey responses, resulting in an overall 
sample size  of N = 2940.  
E. Aim [ADDRESS_184060] messages. 
Sample Size Justification: We will recruit up to 4 focus groups of size 6- 8 LGBT polytobacco users (N = 
24-32), a standard sample size48,49 in formative qualitative research.  
 
F. Aim 2 Eye- tracking (NCT0597294) Data Analysis  
Hypothesis: Psychophysiological data will indicate that culturally targeted messages attract greater attention.  
 Anti-polytobacco messages will be divided into text and graphic AOIs. Dwell time on the textual message (in 
milliseconds) is the primary eye -tracking outcome. We will use linear regression models to compare message 
type (CT vs NT) and framing (RR vs AR) on average dwell time and proportion of time viewing AOIs.  
 Hypothesis: Exposure to targeted messages will result in greater perceived effectiveness of anti -polytobacco 
messages.  
 Generalized linear models (GLMs) will be fit to examine differences in perceived effectiveness by [CONTACT_158373] (CT vs NT). Covariates will include baseline measures in applicable models and prior exposure tobacco 
communications. We will also investigate gender differences. Exploratory analyses : We will conduct 
exploratory analyses on secondary outcomes of interest. Specifically, we will fit generalized linear models (GLMs) to examine differences in EPPM constructs, risk perceptions, behavioral intentions, and 1 -week recall 
by [CONTACT_158371] (CT vs NT).  
 Sample size justification: Virtual lab study. Differences in dwell time from eye- tracking antitobacco 
communications studies (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_158342]) provide the basis for estimates. Assuming a 1.[ADDRESS_184061] deviation, 108 participants (n = 54 per arm) will provide a 95% chance of detecting an 0.6 second mean difference in 
dwell time on AOIs, at 80% power. Data from our prior tobacco warning studies indicate up to a 0.8 second 
difference in dwell time between conditions (Klein, unpublished). A 0.6 second differenc e in dwell time is 
scientifically important as the brain can register stimuli within 0.03 seconds per fMRI.  The enrollment number of 
n=300 will account for  any duplicate responses, high abandonment rate forthe I-motions portion of the survey 
after consent has been completed, and any low-quality eye tracking data recorded due via  remote  I-motions 
software.

 Research question: How does culturally targeting influence message recall? 
For quantitative survey responses, generalized linear models (GLMs) will be fit to examine differences in message recall by [CONTACT_158371] (CT vs NT). Covariates will include baseline measures in applicable models and prior exposure tobacco communications. We will also investigate gender differences.  
For qualitative survey responses, we will summarize the feedback in response to each focus group question 
using rigorous and accelerated data reduction (RADaR)  analytic methods.125 Used in applied research, RADaR 
organizes transcribed textual data from qualitative interviews into data tables; which are then organized and iteratively reduced, coded, and analyzed using team -based coding.  
 
Sample size justification: All participants who complete the eye- tracking survey will be contact[CONTACT_66179] a 
one-week follow -up survey. Even with an estimated 30% attrition, the estimated analytic sample size (N=76) 
would be adequate for formative qualitative research.   
VII. DATA SAFETY and MONITORING PLAN  
The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC)  will be 
the DSMC of record and, thus, will be responsible for reviewing the study. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_879] a summary report 
of the study’s progress, including all subsite activities and data status to the DSMC on an annual basis. All 
adverse events related to the study will be recorded by [CONTACT_473]. The study investigators will evaluate 
adverse events and study data during their weekly meetings and make a determination of whether any adverse 
events affect the risk/benefit ratio of the study and whether modifications to the protocol (e.g., Potential risks) or consent procedures are required.  
 
Serious unanticipated events are not anticipated. In the unlikely case that such serious adverse events occur, 
they will be reviewed by [CONTACT_158374] – James Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC). All reportable 
serious adverse events will be reported within [ADDRESS_184062] the safety of the participants or the ethics of the trial. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_9042] a summary of the 
Data Safety and Monitoring Plan annually as part of the progress r eport to the National Cancer Institute (NCI). 
 All data and safety monitoring will adhere to the policies and procedures of the OSU Comprehensive Cancer 
Center’s Data and Safety Monitoring Plan which has been approved by [CONTACT_12134].  
 
VIII. Dissemination Plan 
The study will be uploaded to clinicaltrials.gov and the results and accomplishments from this study will be 
made available to the public. We will disseminate the results and accomplishments from this trial to the research community and to the public at large through peer- reviewed scientific journal manuscripts and 
national conferences for the tobacco control, public health and medical communities. Additionally, the findings from this trial may be used to provide evidence informing the development of anti -tobacco messages for

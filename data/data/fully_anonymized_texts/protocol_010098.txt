Version 7.0 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 4 In the Central Vein Occlusion Study (CVOS) 728 eyes with CRVO were studied.2  Of these 63 
728 eyes, 155 (21%) had macular edema that reduced visual acuity to 20/50 or worse 64 
(group M eyes, macular edema).  In the largest group (group P, perfused) that included 547 65 
eyes, 84% (460 eyes) had angiographic evidence of macular edema involving the fovea at 66 
baseline.  67 
 68 
The natural history of macular edema associated with CRVO was delineated in the CVOS.2-4 69 
Additionally, the group M arm of the CVOS evaluated the treatment of macular edema with 70 
grid laser photocoagulation in 155 eyes (77 treated eyes and 78 control eyes) over a 3 year 71 
follow-up period.  All eyes had macular edema for a minimum of 3 months prior to 72 
enrollment.  For untreated eyes with an initial visual acuity between 20/50 and 5/200 at 73 
presentation (n=78 eyes), 42 eyes were available for follow-up at the 3- year visit.  Of these 74 
eyes, 10 (24%) gained two or more lines of visual acuity at the 3- year follow -up.  Twenty 75 
eyes (48%) remained within two lines of baseline visual acuity and 12 eyes (29%) lost two or 76 
more lines of visual acuity at the 3 -year follow -up.  At the 3- year follow -up, six eyes (14%) 77 
gained three or more lines of visual acuity.  Thirty eyes (71%) remained within three lines of 78 
baseline visual acuity and six eyes (14%) lost three or more lines of visual acuity at the 3- 79 
year follow -up.  The final median visual acuity in untreated eyes was 20/160. 80 
 81 
At the 2 -year visit, 53 untreated eyes were available for follow -up.  Of these eyes, 10 (19%) 82 
gained two or more lines of visual acuity.  Thirty-one eyes (58%) remained within two lines 83 
of baseline visual acuity and 12 eyes (23%) lost two or more lines of visual acuity at the 2 - 84 
year follow -up.  At the 2- year follow -up, 6 eyes (11%) gained three or more lines of visual 85 
acuity.  Thirty -nine eyes (74%) remained within three lines of baseline visual acuity and 86 
eight eyes (15%) lost three or more lines of visual acuity at the 2 -year follow -up. 87 
 88 
At the 1 -year visit, 72 untreated eyes were available for follow -up.  Of these eyes, 6 (8%) 89 
gained two or more lines of visual acuity.  Forty-four eyes (61%) remained within two lines 90 
of baseline visual acui ty and 22 eyes (31%) lost two or more lines of visual acuity at the 1- 91

there is no proven therapy for visual impairment due to macular edema associated with 100 
CRVO.  Thus, it is important to explore other avenues for managing this potentially 101 
devastating cause of vision loss. 102 
 103 
The Branch Vein Occlusion Study (BVOS) reported on the natural history of macular 104 
edema associated with BRVO.1 All eyes had macular ed ema for 3 to 18 months prior to 105 
study entry; eyes with obvious areas of capi[INVESTIGATOR_786858] 106

(34%) with a presenting visual acuity of 20/40 or worse achieved a visual acuity of 20/40 or 108 
better.  Furthermore, eight eyes (23%) had 20/[ADDRESS_1082519] 3 -months (and less than 18 113 
months) in eyes with visual acuity of 20/40 or worse.  One hundred thirty nine eyes (71 114 
treated eyes and 68 control eyes) were studied.  This arm of the study did demonstrate a 115 
benefit for eyes treated with macular grid photocoagulation.1 Of 43 treated eyes available 116 
for follow -up at the 3-year visit, 28 eyes (65%) had gained two or more lines of visual [ADDRESS_1082520] eight months, as  compared with 118 
the same gain in 13 of 35 (37%) untreated eyes. At the 3- year visit, nearly twice as large a 119

retina is produced.8 This is then followed by [CONTACT_155666], and later structural changes, in the 150 
retinal capi[INVESTIGATOR_11037].  These changes resulted in an immediate increase in retinal capi[INVESTIGATOR_1396] 151

statistically significant increase in vitreous fluorescein leakage.  Vitreous fluorescein 163 
leakage in eyes injected with VEGF attained a maximum of 227% of control levels.  164 
Antonetti et al demonstrated that VEGF may regulate vessel permeability by [CONTACT_30212] 165 
phosphorylation of tight junction proteins such as occludin and zonula occluden 1.10  166 
Sprague-Dawley rats were given intravitreal injections of VEGF and changes in tight 167 
junction proteins were observed through Western blot analysis.  Treatment with alkaline 168 
phosphatase revealed that these changes were caused by a change in phosphorylation of 169 
tight junction proteins.  This model provides, at the molecular level, a potential mechanism 170 
for VEGF -mediated vascular permeability in the eye.  Similarly, in human non -ocular 171 
disease states such as ascites, VEGF has been characterized as a potent vascular 172 
permeability factor (VPF).11 173

2.3 Animal and Clinical Studies Using Intravitreal Triamcinolone Acetonide 202 
Injections  203 
Intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide has been shown to be non- toxic in animal 204 
studies.17-19 McCuen et al inj ected 1mg of triamcinolone acetonide into the vitreous cavity 205 
of 21 rabbit eyes.17  Throughout the 3-month course of follow-up ophthalmoscopy, IOP, 206 
electroretinography (scotopic and photopic responses) and light and electron microscopy all 207 
remained normal.   Schindler et al studied the clearance of intravitreally injected 208 
triamcinolone acetonide (0.5 mg) in [ADDRESS_1082527] Care vs. COrticosteroid for REtinal Vein Occlusion (SCORE) Study  February 10, 2008

respectively.18 It was found that the ophthalmoscopic disappearance of injected 212 
triamcinolone acetonide correlated well with a spectrophotometric analysis for clearance of 213 
the drug.  Scholes et al also studied the clearance of intravitreally injected triamcinolone 214 
acetonide (0.4 mg) in 24 rabbit eyes.19 Using high -performance liquid chromatography 215 
(HPLC) complete clearance of the drug was noted by 21 days.  Non- detectable drug levels 216

of VEGF.20,21  These properties of steroids are commonly utilized.  Clinically, 222 
triamcinolone acetonide is used locally as a periocular injection for the treatment of cystoid 223 
macular edema (CME) secondary to uveitis or as a result of intraocular surgery.22,23  In 224 
animal studies, intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide has been used in the prevention of 225 
proliferative vitreoretinopathy24,25 and retinal neovascularization.26,27  Intravitreal 226 
triamcinolone acetonide has been used clinically in the treatment of proliferative 227 
vitreoretinopathy28 and choroidal neovascularization.29-31 228 
 229 
Recently, intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide has been used clinically in the treatment of 230 
retinal vascular disease.  A case report b y Jonas and Sofker describes a patient with non- 231 
proliferative diabetic retinopathy with a 6 -month history of persistent, diffuse macular 232 
edema despi[INVESTIGATOR_786860].32 Following one intravitreal injection of 233 
triamcinolone acetonide (20mg) the visual acuity of this patient improved from 20/200 to 234 
20/50 over a 5-month follow-up period.  It was also noted that there was marked regression 235 
of macular edema on clinical examination.  236

Baseline central foveal thickness averaged 540 microns for the 16 enrolled eyes when 247

foveal thickness decreased from 533 microns to 242 microns.  Two eyes did not complete 249 
the 1 -month follow- up examination.  Fourteen eyes evaluated at 3 -months showed a 250 
reduction in mean foveal thickness from 528 microns to 224 microns.  Two eyes did not 251

Greenberg and Martidis studied both eyes of one patient with bilateral diffuse macular 281 
edema secondary to CRVO.35 The right eye of this 80 year old patient had macular edema 282 
from a CRVO of 9 months duration when the patient presented with a 2-week history of 283 
visual acuity loss due to macular edema from a CRVO in the left eye.  Because of the poor 284 
natural history of untreated macular edema in the right eye of this patient, the left eye 285 
received an intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide.  It did well both anatomically 286 
and functionally, with visual acuity improvement from 20/400 to 20/30 after three months 287 
of follow-up.  Central foveal thickness as measured by [CONTACT_7349] 288 
decreased fr om 589 microns to 160 microns with restoration of a normal foveal contour 289 
following treatment.  Six months following injection, visual acuity decreased to 20/400 290 
because of recurrence of retinal thickening that measured 834 microns by [CONTACT_786879] 291 
tomography. A second injection was performed and, 1 month later, visual acuity returned to 292 
20/50 with a decrease in central foveal thickness to 158 microns with a normal foveal 293 
contour.  This patient has maintained this level of visual acuity for over 6 months following 294 
the second injection.  Given the response to treatment in the left eye, the right eye (now 295 
with 16 months of untreated macular edema) was treated with an intravitreal injection of [ADDRESS_1082536] Care vs. COrticosteroid for REtinal Vein Occlusion (SCORE) Study  February 10, 2008

summary of the data from the seven studies listed shows that the frequency of injection- 335 
related adverse events such as endophthalmitis, non- infectious endophthalmitis, retinal 336

published literature.  Corticosteroid- related adverse events, from the data in Table 3, are 338 
more common.  However, corticosteroid- related adverse events (cataract and elevated IOP) 339 
appear to be manageable.  For example, of the 221 patients in the seven studies discussed, 340 
33 patients (15%) were noted to have some elevation of IOP; all patients were managed 341

corticosteroid fluocinolone acetonide directly to the posterior segment of the 381 
eye for a period of 3 year s.  A multi-center, randomized, masked trial is 382 
currently being conducted to evaluate this technology for the treatment of 383 
diabetic macular edema refractory to prior laser photocoagulation.  Eligible 384 
visual acuity was between 20/50 to 20/400, inclusive.  This trial enrolled 80 385 
patients with diabetic macular edema.  Patients were randomly assigned to one 386 
of three treatment arms:  0.5 mg implant (N=41), 2 mg implant (N=11) or [ADDRESS_1082555] of care treatment consisting of either repeat laser photocoagulation or 388

(Posurdex) that delivers the corticosteroid dexamethasone directly to the 406 
posterior segment of the eye for a period of 35 days.  A phase two clinical trial 407 
was completed evaluating two dosages of Posurdex, 350 micrograms and 700 408 
micrograms.  Patients with macular ede ma due to diabetic retinopathy, retinal 409 
vascular occlusive disease, Irvine-Gass syndrome or uveitis were included.  410 
Eligible visual acuity was 20/40 -20/200.  Patients were randomized to one of 411 
three treatment arms:  350 microgram implant, 700 microgram imp lant or 412 
observation.  306 patients were enrolled, 172 with diabetic macular edema, 413 
103 with vein occlusion, 27 with Irvine-Gass syndrome and 14 with uveitic 414 
macular edema.  415 
• Patients receiving the 700 microgram implant had a statistically 416 
significant improve ment in visual acuity of two or more lines on the 417 
ETDRS chart when compared to patients who did not receive the 418 
implant (P=0.019). 419 
• Secondary outcomes such as retinal thickness and fluorescein leakage 420 
also showed statistically significant decreases in patie nts that received 421 
the 700 microgram implant when compared to patients who did not 422 
receive the implant (P=0.001). 423 
• Patients receiving the 350 microgram implant also demonstrated 424 
statistically significant decreases in retinal thickness and fluorescein 425 
leakage, with a trend towards improvement in visual acuity, indicating 426 
a dose response to the treatment.  427

• At the 6 -month follow-up, 0.0% of patients in the standard of care 442

Elevated IOP  451 
• An IOP elevation to 25 mmHg or more was noted at some point in 452 
the study in 32 eyes; all were readily controll ed with topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] [ADDRESS_1082564] and other side effects  455 
• There was no difference in cataract progression between the study 456 
groups. 457 
• No other safety concerns were noted.  [ADDRESS_1082565] Care vs. COrticosteroid for REtinal Vein Occlusion (SCORE) Study  February 10, [ADDRESS_1082566] been 467 
reported to reduce macular edema.  There is a ration ale for using a dose lower than 4 468 
mg.42,43  Glucocorticoids bind to glucocorticoid receptors in the cell cytoplasm, and the 469 
steroid -receptor complex moves to the nucleus where it regulates gene exp ression. The 470 
steroid -receptor binding occurs with high affinity (low dissociation constant (Kd) which is 471 
on the order of 5 to 9 nanomolar).  Complete saturation of all the receptors occurs at about 472 
20 fold higher levels, so about 100 nanomolar.  A 4 mg dose of triamcinolone/4mg of [ADDRESS_1082567] of a 1 mg dose may be equivalent to that of a 4mg 475 
dose, because compared to the 10,000 fold saturation, a 4-fold difference in dose is 476 
inconsequential.  It is also possible that higher doses of corticosteroid could be less 477 
effective than lower doses due to down-regulation of the receptor.  The steroid implant 478 
studies provide additional justification for evaluating a lower dose—a 0.[ADDRESS_1082568] in reducing 480 
macular edema (P. Andrew Pearson, personal communication). 481 
 482 
There has been limited experience using doses greater than 4 mg.  Jonas’ case series [ADDRESS_1082569] not been able to replicate this dose using the preparation procedure described by [CONTACT_786880] 485 
(Frederick Ferris, personal communication).   [ADDRESS_1082570] Care vs. COrticosteroid for REtinal Vein Occlusion (SCORE) Study  February 10, [ADDRESS_1082571] common.  This relationship is well established.  In pat ients 506 
susceptible to this phenomenon, the elevation of IOP may occur as a result of topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], 507 
systemic or peribulbar administration.  For example, following 4-6 weeks of topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 508 
corticosteroid administration, 5% of subjects may show an elevation in IOP of 509 
>16mmHg and 30% of subjects may show an elevation of 6-15mmHg.44,45 510 
 511 
The mechanism of corticosteroid induced elevation of IOP is incompletely 512 
understood. Possible theories include46:  a) inhibition of the production of outflow- 513 
enhancing prostaglandins,  b) suppression of trabecular meshwork endothelial cell 514 
phagocytosis,  c) increased deposition of proteoglycans or glycosaminoglycans in the 515 
trabecular meshwork with a resultant increase in resistance to outflow,  d) increase in 516 
cross -linked actin networks in the trabecular meshwork,  e) increase in the expression 517 
of cellular tight-junction protein,  f) stabilization of lysosomes which allow 518 
accumulation of hyaluronate or other debris in the trabecular meshwork. 519 
 520 
The intravitreal administration of corticosteroid is expected to be associated with an 521 
increase in IOP in susceptible patients.  Indeed, the literature reviewed in this protocol 522 
confirm that corticosteroid induced elevation in IOP may result from intravitreal 523 
corticosteroid administration (Table 3).  The time course for the development of [ADDRESS_1082572] Care vs. COrticosteroid for REtinal Vein Occlusion (SCORE) Study  February 10, [ADDRESS_1082573] Formation 538

Indeed, the literature reviewed in this protocol confirms that 562 
cataracts appear to result from intravitreal corticosteroid administration (Table 3).  [ADDRESS_1082577] to form following the intravitreal administration of corticosteroid.  Table 3 569 
shows that 4% of patients in the [ADDRESS_1082578] surgery and 12% [ADDRESS_1082579] will be followed closely as an adverse event in this 574 
study. 575 
 576 
2.6.3 Endopht halmitis  577 
Infectious endophthalmitis is an intraocular inflammatory process due to infection 578 
with pathogens such as bacteria or fungi.  Clinical features include lid edema, 579 
conjunctival injection, corneal edema, anterior chamber and vitreous inflammation, 580 
and hypopyon.  Infectious endophthalmitis can occur following an intraocular 581 
procedure (e.g. cataract surgery, vitrectomy surgery, intravitreal injection), as a result [ADDRESS_1082580] Care vs. COrticosteroid for REtinal Vein Occlusion (SCORE) Study  February 10, [ADDRESS_1082581] surgery was <1%.50 In the Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study 588 
(EVS), gram -positive organisms accounted for 94% of culture positive cases.51 589 
 590 
The incidence and causative pathogens following intravitreal injection of 591 
corticosteroid are less well defined.  In the published literature, this complication 592 
appears uncommon (Table 3).  Endophthalmitis following intravitreal injection of 593 
antiviral agents for the treatment of CMV retinitis also appears to be uncommon 594 
(personal communication, Daniel F. Martin).  However, the injection of a bolus of 595 
medication that has immunosuppressive properties may result in a higher incidence of 596 
postinjection endophthalmitis using corticosteroids.  A standardized protocol to 597 
prepare eyes for the injection procedure may help to decrease the incidence of this 598 
complication.  Such a protocol is described in the Manual of Procedures and 599 
Procedures (MOPP).  600 
 601 
The clinical experience to date has been with the use of Kenalog.  Kenalog is a 602 
commercially available preparation that is FDA labeled for intramuscular or 603 
intrabursal use.  The available preparat ion of Kenalog contains, in addition to 604 
triamcinolone acetonide, 0.99% benzyl alcohol, 0.75% carboxymethylcellulose 605 
sodium and 0.04% polysorbate 80.52 Although the published literature to date does 606 
not describe a significant incidence of complications as a result of the Kenalog 607 
vehicle, anecdotal experience suggests that there may be a significant incidence of 608 
non-infectious endophthalmitis as a result of the vehicle components [American 609 
Society of Retinal Specialists listserve from 2002 -2003].  As a result of the possibility [ADDRESS_1082582] Care vs. COrticosteroid for REtinal Vein Occlusion (SCORE) Study  February 10, 2008

3. Objectives  622 
The primary objective of the SCORE Study is to compare visual acuity outcome among 3 groups 623 
of participants: those who are randomly assigned to receive standard care and those randomly 624 
assigned to receive one of two doses of intravitreal injection(s) of triamcinolone acetonide for [ADDRESS_1082583] and elevated IOP in eyes receiving intravitreal 628 
injection(s) of triamcinolone.  Other secondary objectives include comparing changes in retinal 629 
thickness and calculated retinal thickening in participants who are randomly assigned to receive 630 
intravitreal injection(s) of triamcinolone acetonide with those randomly assigned to standard care [ADDRESS_1082584] care with intravitreal injection(s) of triamcinolone acetonide for the 636 
treatment of macular edema associated with CRVO and BRVO.  Eligible participants within each 637

ii. A BRVO is defined as an eye that has retinal hemorrhage or other 711 
biomicroscopic evidence of retinal vein occlusion (e.g. 712 
telangiectatic capi[INVESTIGATOR_99996]) and a dilated venous system (or 713 
previously dilated venous system) in 1 quadrant or less of retina 714 
drained by [CONTACT_214613].  715 
iii. A hemiretinal vein occlusion (HRVO) is defined as an eye that 716 
has retinal hemorrhag e or other biomicroscopic evidence of retinal 717 
vein occlusion (e.g. telangiectatic capi[INVESTIGATOR_99996]) and a dilated 718 
venous system (or previously dilated venous system) in more than 719 
1 quadrant but less than all 4 quadrants.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], a HRVO is a 720

4.5 Informed Consent, Screening Evaluation, and Randomization 861 
4.5.1 Informed Consent  862 
Potential participants in the SCORE Study will be assessed as part of routine -care 863 
examinations.  Prior to completing a ny procedures or collecting any data that are not 864 
part of usual medical care, written informed consent will be obtained.  The informed 865 
consent should be reviewed with the patient at this visit and signed with the 866 
understanding that the patient may or may not be eligible.  Consent may be given in 867 
two stages (if approved by [CONTACT_1201]), with one consent signature [CONTACT_786905] [ADDRESS_1082611] two 871 
signature/date lines for the patient: one for the patient to consent to the screening 872 
procedures and one for the patient to consent for the randomized trial.  Patients will 873 
be encouraged to discuss the SCORE Study with family members and their personal 874 
physician(s) before deciding on study participation.  Two identical consent forms are 875 
signed.  One original consent form is to be kept in the participant’s study file and a 876 
copy of an original is placed in the participant’s clinical chart.  The other original 877 
signed consent is for the participant to take home.  The informed consent describes 878 
the study, randomization procedure, intravitreal steroid treatment and participant 879 
responsibilities.  Randomization will occur following confirmation of the patient’s [ADDRESS_1082612] Care vs. COrticosteroid for REtinal Vein Occlusion (SCORE) Study  February 10, 2008

4.5.3 Randomization 933 
A secure Internet -based eligibility, enrollment and randomization system is integrated 934 
into the SCORE Study.  One eye of each participant will be randomly assigned to 935 
either treatment with intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide in one of two doses (4 mg 936 
or 1 mg) vs. observation (CRVO) or intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide in one of 937 
two doses (4 mg or 1 mg) vs. observation/grid laser photocoagulation (BRVO).  938 
Treatment assignments, generated by [CONTACT_786885], will be 939 
stratified ac cording to the following disease groups:  CRVO, BRVO without dense 940 
macular hemorrhage, and BRVO with dense macular hemorrhage; and baseline visual 941 
acuity according to the following categories: good visual acuity (59-73 letters: 20/40 942 
to 20/63), moderate vi sual acuity (49 -58 letters: 20/80 to 20/100), and poor visual 943 
acuity (19 -48 letters: 20/125-20/400).  In participants with both eyes eligible and [ADDRESS_1082618] the same disease (CRVO or BRVO), the eye to be randomized 945 
into the SCORE Study will be at the discretion of the physician and patient.  Only one 946 
eye per participant may be randomized into the SCORE study.  In participants with 947 
both eyes eligible, but where the disease is different (i.e. CRVO in one eye and [ADDRESS_1082619] Care vs. COrticosteroid for REtinal Vein Occlusion (SCORE) Study  February 10, 2008

macula (and thus the timing of the grid laser photocoagulation) is left to the discretion of [ADDRESS_1082621] care who are eligible for laser (i.e., no 967 
dense macular hemorrhage) will have laser photocoagulation performed to treat both 968 
focal leaks, if any, and areas of diffuse retinal thickening.  The investigator has the 969 
flexibility to determine the total number of burns required for treatment.  However, 970 
the total number of burns delivered will depend on the number of focal leaks present, 971 
if any, and the area of diffuse retinal thickening present.  If the eye is not eligible for 972 
laser photocoagulation at the randomization visit because of t he presence of dense 973 
macular hemorrhage, the participant will be re- evaluated at 4 -month intervals.  If the 974 
macular hemorrhage clears, laser photocoagulation will be performed at that time.  975 
The following guidelines should be followed: [ADDRESS_1082622] Care vs. COrticosteroid for REtinal Vein Occlusion (SCORE) Study  February 10, 2008

investigator.  1062 
4.8.3 Retreatment Assessment  1063 
At each 4 -month visit during follow-up, the investigator will assess whethe r persistent 1064 
or recurrent macular edema is present that warrants retreatment with the 1065 
randomization assigned treatment.  1066

 1075 
If ret reatment is deferred because the patient has responded well to prior treatment, 1076 
then the patient can either be scheduled to be seen in 4 months or can be seen sooner 1077 
at investigator’s discretion.  1078 
 1079 
[IP_ADDRESS] Retreatment Criteria  1080 
In general, the patient will be retreated with the randomization -assigned 1081 
treatment unless there are specific reasons not to retreat, in which case the 1082 
investigator may decide to postpone treatment, although postponing treatment 1083 
is not required.  The reasons for not retreating include: 1084 
 1085 
1. Treatment has been successful and may not need to be repeated if one of 1086 
the following is present:  [ADDRESS_1082631] Care vs. COrticosteroid for REtinal Vein Occlusion (SCORE) Study  February 10, 2008

than 225 microns). 1091 
b. ETDRS visual acuity score of 79 or more letters (approximately 20/25 1092 
or better).  [ADDRESS_1082633] treatment session (e.g., > 1095 
50% decrease in retinal thickening [thickening is not retinal thickness; 1096

improvement (without additional treatment) in macular edema might [ADDRESS_1082634] from prior treatment or maximum treatment has 1103 
already been received.  Examples include the following :   1104 
• The participant had an IOP elevation after a previous steroid 1105 
injection that required treatment to lower the IOP.  ( Note: an [ADDRESS_1082635] be lowered 1110 
before retreatment is given ).  1111 
• In the investigator’s judgment, maximum safe laser 1112 
photocoagulation has been performed and therefore additional 1113 
laser photocoagulation is contraindicated 1114 
 1115 
3. Additional treatment seems "apparently futile": 1116 
Additional treatment will be defined as "apparently futile" if [ADDRESS_1082636] been 2 proce dures (either laser [ADDRESS_1082637] Care vs. COrticosteroid for REtinal Vein Occlusion (SCORE) Study  February 10, 2008

either of the following criteria compared with the findings at the beginning 1123 
of the 8 or more months period: 1124 
a. An increase in visual acuity score of 5 or more letters.  1125 
or 1126 
b. A decrease in calculated retinal thickening (measured  thickness minus [ADDRESS_1082640] central subfield of the six- radial scan map) [ADDRESS_1082641] a 20% reduction in 1129 
calculated retinal thickening (measured thickness minus 175 microns) 1130 
compared with the findings at the beginning of the 8 or more months 1131 
period. 1132 
If the eye meets the criteria for additional treatment being “apparently futile”, the [ADDRESS_1082642] is not obligated to discontinue treatment at 1135 
this visit and may perform an additional treatment (either laser photocoagulation 1136 
or intravitreal triamcinolone injection, according to the randomization assigned 1137 
treatment) if desired.  1138 
 1139 
Example of “Apparently Futile” at 20 Months After Study Enrollment 1140 
An eye improved in visual acuity from 55 letters (approximately 20/80) to 70 1141 
letters (approximately 20/40) and in OCT from [ADDRESS_1082643] year of follow -up (i.e., at the 12-month follow-up the visual acuity was 70 1143 
letters (approximately 20/40) and the OCT measured 300 microns) and had 1144 
intravitreal injections at baseline, 6, 12, and 16 months.  Between 12 and 20 1145 
months the eye never had a visual acuity measured at better than 70 letters 1146 
(approximately 20/40) and the smallest OCT thickness measured was 290 (less 1147

visit.  However, continued treatment is not forbidden.  If treatment is 1151 
discontinued, the investigator may choose to reinstate treatment at a subsequent 1152

(i.e. not due to cataract or other abnormality) that is documented on OCT. 1179 
(Note: for the purposes of this study, as a guideline, the center of the macula [ADDRESS_1082650] central subfield is >225 microns) . [ADDRESS_1082651] care group may 1183 
receive (but is not required to receive) intravitreal triamcinolone (4 mg dose, study 1184 
formulation) and BRVO eyes without a dense macular hemorrhage assigned to 1185 
intravitreal triamcinolone injection may receive (but are not required to receive) 1186 
laser photocoagulation. When the above criteria are met, the investigator should 1187 
only provide the alternate treatment if the investigator strongly believes that the 1188 
alternate treatment is in the patient’s best interest.  1189 
 1190 
4.8.5 Other Treatments  1191 
If, in  the investigator’s judgment, the study eye requires additional treatment o ther 1192 
than laser photocoagulation or intravitreal triamcinolone injection, then the Study 1193

4.9.1 Endophthalmitis Treatment  1199 
The decision to treat a patient for an endophthalmitis or a suspected endophthalmitis 1200 
will be guided by [CONTACT_786888].  The treatment method 1201 
(pars plana vitrectomy vs. vitreous tap) and choice of antimicrobial agents is also at [ADDRESS_1082652] practice patterns. 1203 
 The decision to use intravitreal steroids (e.g. dex amethasone) for the treatment of 1204 
endophthalmitis is also at the discretion of the investigator.  1205

used in the Collaborative Initial Glaucoma Treatment Study53 and is listed below:  1221 
 1222 
Participants may receive a sequence of medications, which may begin with a topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 1223 
beta-blocker, followed by [CONTACT_786889][INVESTIGATOR_786869], dual topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 1224

 1250 
4.9.4 Surgery for Proliferative Retinopathy and Other Complications Due to 1251 
Retinal Vein Occlusion  1252 
It is expected that some study participants will develop vitreous hemorrhage and/or 1253 
other complications of retinal vein occlus ion that may cause visual impairment.  1254 
Vitrectomy for the complications of proliferative retinopathy such as vitreous 1255 
hemorrhage should be delayed, if clinically feasible, because vitreous hemorrhage 1256 
may resolve, obviating the need for vitrectomy.  Furthermore, vitrectomy is thought to 1257 
reduce the half -life of intravitreal steroids such that participants assigned to the 1258 
steroid treatment arms may experience reduced benefit from intravitreal steroid 1259 
injections following vitrectomy.  1260 
 1261 
A suggested treatment plan  that may be followed for eyes with vitreous hemorrhage 1262 
and/or other complications of retinal vein occlusion is as follows: [ADDRESS_1082661] Care vs. COrticosteroid for REtinal Vein Occlusion (SCORE) Study  February 10, [ADDRESS_1082662] the same disease (CRVO or BRVO) or if each eye 1284 
has a different disease (i.e. one eye has a CRVO  and the other eye has a BRVO).  1285 
• If the study eye was assigned to an intravitreal corticosteroid group, then [ADDRESS_1082663] care to avoid treating both eyes 1287 
with intravitreal corticosteroids.   1288 
• If the study eye was assigned to stand ard care, then the non- study eye may 1289 
be treated with either intravitreal corticosteroids (study preparation, 4 mg 1290 
dose only) or standard care at investigator/patient discretion.  A non-study 1291 
eye treated with the study steroid preparation will undergo the s ame follow - 1292 
up schedule, retreatment regimen and adverse event monitoring as study 1293 
eyes in the SCORE Study. 1294

should be followed: 1301 
Burn Characteristics  1302 
 1303 
Size (on retina)  500 microns  
Exposure  0.1 seconds recommended, 0.05 to 0.2 allowed 
Intensity mild white  
Distribution  edges 1 burn width apart  
No. of Sessions/Sittings  unrestricted (each session generally should be completed in <6 sittings)  
Nasa l proximity to disk  No closer than 500 microns

precluding use of green or yellow)  
 1304 
5. Data Monitoring and Adverse Event Reporting 1305 
5.1 Data Safety Monitoring Committee 1306 
The SCORE Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) is responsible for reviewing 1307 
the study design and, as appropriate, recommending design changes to the SCORE 1308 
Executive Committee and the NEI.  The DSMC also may recommend to the NEI to 1309 
suspend enrollment if adverse events predominate.  In addition, the DSMC assesses study 1310 
data, particularly for adverse and/or beneficial effects of treatment.  The DSMC is expected [ADDRESS_1082665] every six months and will review all accumulating study data including 1312 
adverse events.  The SCORE Data Coordinating Center (DCC) will report to the DSMC [ADDRESS_1082666] Operating Procedure document.  In addition, the DSMC will review early safety 1315 
data on patients from the SCORE Study and from the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical 1316 
Research Network (DRCR.net) study on intravitreal tri amcinolone and diabetic macular [ADDRESS_1082667] Care vs. COrticosteroid for REtinal Vein Occlusion (SCORE) Study  February 10, 2008  
 
 
 
Version 7.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 48 formulation.  The SCORE Study will not proceed if there are any serious concerns 1319 
identified with the formulation or the injection procedure.  The monitoring plan that the 1320 
DSMC will follow is: 1321 
• An initial report will include the day [ADDRESS_1082668] 5 patients 1322 
(combined in the DRCRnet and SCORE studies) who receive an intravitreal [ADDRESS_1082669] been obtained and it is clear that there are no 1325 
immediate safety concerns.  1326 
• A second report will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_786870] [ADDRESS_1082670] 1327 
injection exam.  It will include th e 4-day data on a second group of 5 patients. 1328 
Note: no more than [ADDRESS_1082671] not been any unexpected consequences of the injections, enrollment 1331 
will be opened to all sites.  1332 
• A third report will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_786870] [ADDRESS_1082672] been no safety concerns, the data will be reviewed 1335 
on a monthly basis by [CONTACT_786890] 1336 
data on a less frequent schedule.  1337 
 1338 
5.2 Methods and Timing for Assessing, Recording and Analyzing Safety Parameters 1339 
Each clinical site is responsible for reporting all adverse events, including toxicities, that 1340 
occur to SCORE participants enrolled at their site, regardless of relatedness to study 1341 
therapy or procedure.  Reporting of all adverse event data is expected upon recognition. 1342 
 1343 
Serious adverse events (SAEs), as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] must be reported to the [ADDRESS_1082673] report serious 1345 
adverse events to their local ethics review committee (or IRB) promptly in accordance with [ADDRESS_1082674] Care vs. COrticosteroid for REtinal Vein Occlusion (SCORE) Study  February 10, 2008  
 
 
 
Version 7.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 49  1350 
5.3 Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events  1351 
Clinical sites are required to report all adverse events via the SCORE electronic data 1352 
capture system (AdvantageEDCSM).  Each site will receive training on reporting [ADDRESS_1082675] semi -annually. 1362 
 1363 
5.3.1 Routine SCORE DCC Review  1364 
The SCORE DCC Medical Monitor will be provided relevant material in order to 1365 
assess whether there are safety concerns that may require expedited reporting to the 1366 
FDA, DSMC, loc al ethics committee (or IRB), study investigators, the pharmaceutical 1367 
manufacturer, or the study sponsor (National Eye Institute).  A report of new adverse 1368 
events will be reviewed each weekday by [CONTACT_786891].  Other data are reviewed 1369 
weekly by [CONTACT_786891].  1370 
 1371 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of Adverse Event  1372 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a [ADDRESS_1082676] a causal relationship with this tr eatment.  An 1375 
adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including 1376 
an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated 1377 
with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to 1378 
the medic inal (investigational) product. [ADDRESS_1082677] Care vs. COrticosteroid for REtinal Vein Occlusion (SCORE) Study  February 10, 2008

AdvantageEDC, regardless of the severity or relationship to study medication or 1387 
procedure.  If an adverse event is caused by a combination of treatment and 1388 
disease, the adverse event should be graded as it is observed.  Early in the 1389 
development of a therapy, when little is known about the therapy’s safety 1390 
profile, it is especially important to maintain a high level of  suspi[INVESTIGATOR_786871] 1391 
adverse events that may be treatment -related adverse events.  This reporting may 1392 
facilitate identification of idiosyncratic or low frequency treatment- related 1393 
adverse events.  1394 
 1395 
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  1396 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any adverse event occurring at 1397 
any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: 1398 
a. Death;  1399 
b. Life-threatening adverse event*;  1400 
c. In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 1401

 1423 
5.3.2   Adverse Event Severity Gra ding  1424 
Severity grades are assigned by [CONTACT_786892] 1425 
experiences.  The SCORE Study has adapted usage of The National Cancer Institute's 1426 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) for application in adverse 1427 
event reporting.  A copy of the CTCAE system can be found on the SCORE website: 1428 
(http://www.emmes.com/ ). 1429 
 1430 
The CTCAE provides a term and a grade that closely describes the adverse event.  1431 
The CTCAE grade for each adverse event should be associated with a severity 1432 
category:  Grade 1 (Mild), Grade 2 (Moderate), Grade 3 (Severe), Grade 4 (Life- 1433 
threatening) and Grade 5 (Death).  If the adverse event is not included in the CTCAE, 1434 
the following general definitions should be us ed in determining severity: 1435 
 1436 
Grade 1   Mild   Transient or mild discomforts (<48 hours), no or minimal 1437 
medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_786872] 1438

Clinical sites are required to enter all known adverse event data from all 1472 
events into the electronic adverse event form in the AdvantageEDC. 1473 
 1474 
Serious adverse events are required to be entered into the AdvantageEDC 1475 
within 24 hours of recognition.  If all information required on the event form 1476 
has not been obtained, the site should submit what is available.  Additional 1477 
information, as it becomes available, can be submitted at a later date.  1478 
 1479 
5.3.5 Reporting Procedures  1480 
For reporting of AEs and SAEs, t he Site Coordinator will: 1481 
1. Complete an Adverse Event form (page 1) in the SCORE data entry 1482 
system.  1483 
2. If the site determines that the event is serious , the site will complete, in 1484 
detail, the Adverse Event Summary (page 2 of the Adverse Event Form). 1485

At the time a site Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_786874] a study 1511 
participant has become pregnant during the study, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_786875] 1512 
Coordinator will prepare a report on the pregnancy to be sent to the SCORE DCC that 1513 
includes the following elements: 1514 
• Participant (mother’s) coded study identifier(s); 1515 
• Date of last menstrual period; 1516 
• Date of enrollment; 1517 
• Date(s) of fluorescein  angiogram(s); and  1518 
• Date of last intravitreal injection or laser treatment, if any.  1519 
 1520 
Any pregnancy that occurs during the study should be followed until the time of delivery, 1521 
miscarriage or abortion.  A report with any relevant information on the condition of the 1522 
fetus or infant at birth should be forwarded to the SCORE DCC, including: 1523 
• Mother’s coded study identifier(s); 1524 
• Gestational age at delivery, m iscarriage, or abortion; 1525 
• Birth weight, gender, length, and head circumference, if available; 1526 
• Apgar scores recorded after birth, if available;  1527 
• Any abnormalities.  Report all abnormalities as a serious adverse event.  1528 
 1529 
6. Statistical Considerations 1530 
6.1 Scientific and Regulatory Objectives  1531 
The SCORE Study’s scientific and regulatory objectives are to compare the efficacy and [ADDRESS_1082694] care with intravitreal injection(s) of triamcinolone acetonide ([ADDRESS_1082695] Care vs. COrticosteroid for REtinal Vein Occlusion (SCORE) Study  February 10, 2008  
 
 
 
Version 7.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 55 mg) to treat macular edema associated with CRVO and BRVO.  Although scientific goals [ADDRESS_1082696] of Efficacy 1542 
For regulatory purposes, the SCORE Study will be configured as two separate and 1543 
independent clinical trials “A” and “B”, each trial to serve as confirmatory of the other.  To 1544 
accomplish this, clinical sites will be allocated before recruitment commences to either trial 1545 
“A” or trial “B”, using a method that strives for comparable geographic patterns and 1546 
distributions of enrollees per center .  Within each trial, CRVO and BRVO disease areas 1547 
will be pooled f or analysis and three primary efficacy analyses performed after no more 1548 
than one year of follow-up.  A detailed description of the method of assigning sites to Trial 1549 
“A” and Trial “B” is provided in the SCORE Study Manual of Procedures and Policies 1550 
(MOPP).   The assignment of sites to Trial “A” and Trial “B” will be made prior to [ADDRESS_1082697]- corrected ETDRS visual acuit y 1556 
score.  The significance of the three comparisons will be obtained by [CONTACT_659947]’s 1557 
sequentially rejective procedure, as described in detail in the MOPP, section 6.2.  The 1558 
overall alpha for the A trial will be no more than 0.05, and similarly for the independent B 1559 
trial (more specifically, the alpha for each of the “A” and “B” trials will be diminished from 1560 
0.05 by [CONTACT_786894]).  1561 
Within trial “A” and within trial “B”, an initial analysis of treatment effect will be carried 1562 
out by [CONTACT_786895] a statistical interaction exists between 1563 
disease group (BRVO and CRVO) and treatment group (standard care, [ADDRESS_1082698] Care vs. COrticosteroid for REtinal Vein Occlusion (SCORE) Study  February 10, 2008  
 
 
 
Version 7.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 56 mg steroid).  A finding of no interaction effect will provide justification for pooling the 1565 
CRVO and BRVO participants within trial “A” and trial “B” and the primary efficacy [ADDRESS_1082699] will require separate primary efficacy analyses for 1569 
CRVO and for BRVO within trial “A” and with trial “B”.  1570 
 1571 
6.3 Scientific Statistical Approach  1572 
6.3.1 Two Independent C linical Trials  1573 
The SCORE Study consists of two separate independent clinical trials - one for 1574 
CRVO and one for BRVO.  Each of these clinical trials has its own overall Type I 1575 
error (alpha) = .05. [ADDRESS_1082700] care to 4 mg intravitreal injection(s) of triamcinolone acetonide.  A second [ADDRESS_1082701] care to 1 mg intravitreal injection(s) of [ADDRESS_1082702] question compares 1 mg to 4 mg intravitreal 1582 
injections.  Within each clinical trial, the significance of the comparisons will be 1583 
obtained by [CONTACT_659947]’s sequentially rejective procedure using an alpha level of 0.05 1584 
(see the MOPP,  section 6.4).  1585 
6.3.3 Primary Efficacy Outcome Measure and Time Point  1586 
Improvement by 15 or more letters from the randomization visit visual acuity to the 1587 
12-month follow- up visual acuity is the primary efficacy outcome measure.  Visual 1588 
acuity is to be meas ured using E- ETDRS visual acuity testing.  1589 
 1590 
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Analysis Method 1591 
The three treatment comparisons ([ADDRESS_1082703] care, and 1 mg versus 4 mg) will be made by [CONTACT_786896] [ADDRESS_1082704] Care vs. COrticosteroid for REtinal Vein Occlusion (SCORE) Study  February 10, 2008  
 
 
 
Version 7.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 57 will be compared to the critical value of the efficacy monitoring guideline 1596 
(section 6.7.2).  Family- wise error will be controlled at no more than 0.05 by 1597 
Hochberg’s sequentially rejective method, modified for interim monitoring as 1598 
specified in the MOPP.  1599 
 1600 
The analysis will be on the basis of intent to treat (ITT), treating missing 1601 
observations as missing completely at random [i.e., missing data from study 1602 
participants will be dropped from the analysis and noncompliance (or 1603 
treatment crossover) ignored].   1604 
 1605 
[IP_ADDRESS] Additional Analysis Methods for Consistency of Primary 1606 
Efficacy Result  1607 
We will investigate two other ITT variants: (1) last-observation- carried - [ADDRESS_1082705] (LOCF) and (2) performing a sensitivity analysis in which outcomes [ADDRESS_1082706] for any potential 1615 
imbalances in baseline characteristics observed between treatment groups, 1616 
with the odds ratio used as a measure of increased or decreased risk.  1617 
Important baseline differences, not necessarily based on tests of statistical 1618 
significance, will be investigated as to their ability to confound the association 1619 
between the treatment groups and the primary outcome.  Although the intent- 1620 
to-treat analysis described in section [IP_ADDRESS] is considered to be the definitive 1621

6.4.1 Study Power  1627 
The study power is set for each trial at 80%.   [ADDRESS_1082708] Care Group  1630 
The Central Vein Occlusion Study (CVOS) demonstrated that in participants with 1631 
macular edema for more than 3 months secondary to a CRVO, macular grid laser 1632 
photocoagulation, as compared to no treatment, did not improve visual acuity.4 There 1633 
were no significant differences between treated and untreated participants in either 1634 
level of visual acuity or change in visual acuity across all follow -up visits.  The data 1635 
from the CVOS demonstrate that at 2 years from baseline 18% of treated eyes (10 of 1636 
57 eyes) and 11% of untreated eyes (6 of 53 eyes) experienced a gain of three or more 1637 
lines of visual acuity.  At 1 year, approximately 6% in both the treated and untreated 1638 
eyes showed a gain of three or more lines of visual acuity.  From these data, it is 1639 
conservatively estimated that approximately 15% of untreated eyes with CRVO will [ADDRESS_1082709] Care Group  1643 
In the Branch Vein Occlusion Study (BVOS), macular grid laser photocoagulation 1644 
was demonstrated to be effective in improving visual acuity in some eyes wit h BRVO 1645 
complicated by [CONTACT_15462].1 Treatment resulted in a two or more line 1646 
improvement in visual acuity for two or more consecutive visits in approximately 1647 
45% of eyes at the 2 -year follow -up.  At one year, approximately 20% of treated eyes 1648 
gained two or more lines of visual acuity at two or more consecutive visits.  Patients 1649 
in the BVOS all had absence of dense macular hemorrhage before enrollment.  In the 1650 
SCORE Study, we anticipate as many as 50% of participants may have a dense [ADDRESS_1082710] care arm of the SCORE 1654 
study.  From these data, it is conservatively estimated that approximately 35% of [ADDRESS_1082711] Care vs. COrticosteroid for REtinal Vein Occlusion (SCORE) Study  February 10, [ADDRESS_1082712] care eyes will experience a gain of three or more lines of visual acuity at 1 1656

6.4.4 Background Information on Efficacy of I ntravitreal Injection(s) of 1659 
Triamcinolone Acetonide 1660 
In Table 4, we provide outcomes of treatment with intravitreal steroid injections 1661 
based on six published reports of case series.  Data concerning diabetic macular 1662 
edema (DME) are included because of the similarity (VEGF related vascular 1663 
permeability) between DME and macul ar edema due to retinal vein occlusion. 1664

Except for Park et al,38 the six case series above did not use standardized methods to 1667 
measure visual acuity.  However, all six studies indicate a high likelihood of 1668 
significant visual acuity improvement for treatment of macular edema with 1669 
intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide.  The report by [CONTACT_786897]33 showed 11 of 16 1670 
DME eyes (69%) having a 3- line improvement in visual acuity at the last follow -up 1671 
visit for each eye, which was either 3 or 6 months after the intravitreal injection.  1672 
Park et al38 showed that 7/10 (70%) had a 3 or more line improvement after a mean 1673 
of 4.8 months follow up.  Further, unpublished data (Martidis et al and Ip et al), 1674 
some of which were presented at the 2002 Retina Congress (San Francisco, CA), [ADDRESS_1082713] Care vs. COrticosteroid for REtinal Vein Occlusion (SCORE) Study  February 10, 2008  
 
 
 
Version 7.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 60 provide addi tional evidence of the efficacy of this treatment for macular edema 1676 
secondary to retinal vein occlusion and diabetic macular edema.  Martidis et al, at 1677 
the 2002 Retina Congress, reported additional information on efficacy for DME: 1678 
73/125 (58%) had a two or more Snellen line improvement at an average follow -up 1679 
of 6.7-months.  For BRVO with prior laser treatment, 6/13 (46%) had a three or 1680 
more Snellen line improvement at 6 months.  Ip et al, at the 2002 Retina Congress, 1681 
reported additional information on effi cacy for CRVO (three Snellen line 1682 
improvement): 3/8 (38%) had a three or more Snellen line improvement at 6 1683 
months.   1684 
 1685 
[IP_ADDRESS] Estimate for CRVO Primary Efficacy Outcome in the 1686 
Intravitreal Injection(s) Groups  1687 
For CRVO eyes, our projected rate of improvement of 15 or more letters at 1688 
one year is 30% in the 1 mg and in the 4 mg injection group.   1689

The allocation ratio will be 1:1:[ADDRESS_1082718] care: 1 mg: 4 mg.  The number per 1710 
group has been increased by 10% to allow for some missing data at 12 months 1711 
(number per group=162).  Thus, the total sample estimate for the CRVO trial is 486 1712 
(3 times 162) and for the BRVO trial the total sample estimate is 486 (3 times 162).   1713 
 1714 
6.5 Safety Outcomes  1715 
Safety outcomes that will be assessed include serious adverse events and specific ocular 1716 
events requested by [CONTACT_140308].  The SCORE Study DCC 1717 
and DSMC will continuously monitor the following safety indicator variables: 1718 
• Cataract  1719 
• IOP exceeding 35 while on maximal medical therapy  1720 
• Filtration surgery to lower IOP  1721 
• Non-infectious endophthalm itis 1722 
• Any of: infectious endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, loss of [ADDRESS_1082719] injection, a new -onset retinal arterial 1724 
occlusion, a transition from a branch to a central retinal vein occlusion, a new, 1725 
clearly independent branch retinal vein occlusion, or anterior ischemic optic 1726 
neuropathy. 1727 
Table 5 indicates the precision with which the SCORE Study will be able to estimate rates 1728 
of safety events at the end of the trial.  Three sample sizes are provided in Table 5:  1729 
• N=162: within each study arm. 1730 
• N=324: pooling the [ADDRESS_1082720] Care vs. COrticosteroid for REtinal Vein Occlusion (SCORE) Study  February 10, 2008

For example, if the true rate is 0.25 and the sample size is 162, the 10% quantile for the 1736 
lower 95% confidence limits is 0.15, and the 90% quantile for the upper 95% confidence 1737 
limit and half -width are 0.36 and 0.07, respectively. 1738

6.6 Secondary Efficacy Outcomes  1744 
Secondary efficacy outcomes will be analyzed by [CONTACT_786898] (4 1745 
mg or 1 mg) to standard care as well as by [CONTACT_23992] 4 mg vs 1 mg intravitreal 1746 
triamcinolone for the secondary efficacy outcome variables listed below.  The secondary 1747 
efficacy outcomes include the following: 1748 
• Change between baseline and each efficacy outcome assessment visit in best - 1749 
corrected ETDRS visual acuity score (e.g., mean change from baseline in visual 1750 
acuity, distribution of change from baseline in visual acuity based on clinically 1751 
meaningful cut points of improvement or worsening of visual acuity). 1752 
• Change in calculated retinal thickening as assessed by [CONTACT_786879] 1753 
tomography. 1754 
• Change in retinal thickness at the center of the macula as assessed by [CONTACT_786899] 1755 
color fundus photography. 1756 
• Change in area of retinal thickening as assessed by [CONTACT_786881] [ADDRESS_1082721] Care vs. COrticosteroid for REtinal Vein Occlusion (SCORE) Study  February 10, 2008  
 
 
 
Version 7.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 63  1759 
6.7 Statistical Guidelines for Interim Monitoring by [CONTACT_6802]  1760 
6.7.1 Interim Monitoring for Safety  1761 
The SCORE Study will use repeated confidence intervals to continuously monitor the 1762 
safety indicator variables mentioned in section 6.5.  Safety rates will be reported 1763 
separately in the two disease areas, but injection arms will be pooled to increase 1764 
accuracy of the estimates.   1765 
 1766 
6.7.2 Interim Monitoring for Efficacy  1767 
The primary efficacy outcome occurs at 12 months from the randomization visit.  The 1768 
recruitm ent pattern is unpredictable.  Information concerning the primary outcome 1769 
will accrue as participants complete their 12 -month visit and thus "information time" [ADDRESS_1082722] completed this visit. 1771 
 1772 
Of the Type I error (alpha) = .05 for each trial, alpha = 0.005 will be allocated for 1773 
interim monitoring and the remaining alpha = 0.045 will be reserved for the final 1774 
analysis.  With alpha =0.045 for the final analysis, the estimate of the sample size 1775 
does not need to be increased for interim monitoring.  Interim testing will be carried 1776 
out using the Lan-DeMets interim monitoring boundary with an O’Brien- Fleming - [ADDRESS_1082723] 0.005 cumulative alpha can be spent prior to the 1778 
final analysis.  The "height of the hurdle" is highest when the information fraction is [ADDRESS_1082724] and decreases as additional patients complete 12 months.  The "height of the 1780 
hurdle" can be calculated for each DSMC meeting based on the number of patients [ADDRESS_1082725] completed the 12-month visit and the alpha spent by [CONTACT_786900] 1782 
"looks" by [CONTACT_6802].  With the specification that the total alpha for interim 1783 
monitoring is 0.005, the maximum amount the DSMC can "spend" is 0.005.  If the 1784 
DSMC looks more often, it will “spend” less per look. [ADDRESS_1082726] Care vs. COrticosteroid for REtinal Vein Occlusion (SCORE) Study  February 10, 2008  
 
 
 
Version 7.0 CONFIDENTIAL   Page 64 Formally, if t is the information fraction, B(t) is the 2 -sided cumulative O’Brien - 1787 
Fleming -type spending function of Lan & DeMets with final value B(1) = 0.005, and 1788

 ( ) for 0 1()0.05 for 1Bt tStt≤< ==  1790 
 1791 
At each interim inspection, the three comparisons will be made using the Lan- DeMets 1792 
methodology, and the results combined using Hochberg’s sequentially rejective 1793 
procedure as described in the MOPP, section 6.4. 1794 
6.7.3 Interim Monit oring for Futility  1795 
The DSMC will consider futility as well as safety and efficacy.  One method of 1796 
statistically assessing futility is to use conditional power to estimate the likelihood of 1797 
statistical significance given the observed efficacy results and various possible 1798 
choices for the remaining results.   1799 
 1800 
6.7.4 Analyses and Results Requested to be Considered Prior to 1801 
Recommending Early Termination  1802 
 1803 
Before recommending early termination, the DSMC will consider: 1804 
• internal consistency of primary and secondary resul ts 1805 
• internal consistency of primary and secondary results by [CONTACT_12125] 1806 
defined by [CONTACT_7863] (e.g. visual acuity categories, categories 1807 
based on length of history of CRVO or BRVO, and time period of 1808 
enrollment)  1809 
• distribution of baseline prognostic factors among the three groups 1810 
(standard care, 4 mg, 1 mg) 1811 
• consistency of primary and secondary results across clinical centers and [ADDRESS_1082727] Care vs. COrticosteroid for REtinal Vein Occlusion (SCORE) Study  February 10, 2008

• possible impact of missing data from missed patient visits for assessment 1817 
of the primary and secondary response variables 1818 
• possible differences in concomitant interventions or medications. [ADDRESS_1082729] only during the four meetings when the 1826

SUMMARY
Indication: 
Advanced malignancies (with the exception of leukemia) refrac tory to standard of care 
therap y, or for whom no standard of care therap y is available .
Rationale:
Cancer remains an area with tremendous unmet medical need.  Each year, an estimated 
23 million people worldwide are diagnosed with the disease and more than half die from it.  
Across the seven major markets (US, 5 EU and Japan), three million individuals are 
diagnosed with cancer annually , and 1.[ADDRESS_235985] frequency  include non -small cell lung ca ncer (NSCLC), breast 
cancer, and colorectal cancer.  Taken together, these cancers acc ount for more than [ADDRESS_235986] clinical efficacy  can be obtained w ith 
well-tolerated kinase inhibitors directed towards oncogenic kinases bearing activa ting 
mutations or other signal transduction perturbations.  Recent examples include Gleevecin 
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( GIST) with mutant c -Kit, Tarcevaand Iressain NSCL C 
with mutant epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] ( EGFR ),and SU11248 targeti ng the 
VHL -dependent vascular endoethelial growth factor ( VEGF )pathway  in renal cell carcinoma 
(RCC). 
MET /Hepatocy te growth factor receptor (HGFR) has been well ch aracterized for its role in 
regulation of cell growth, migration, and invasion of both tumo r cells and endothelial cells.  
An extensive body  of literature indicates that MET /HGFR is one of the receptor ty rosine 
kinases (RTKs) most frequently  mutated o r otherwise abnormall y activated in late -stage 
human cancer.  When activated, MET/HGFR plays a c ritical role in regulation of tumor 
oncogenic processes such as mitogenesis, survival, and invasive growth, and especiall y in the 
metastatic process.  Additionally , the emerging role of MET /HGFR in the regulation of 
tumor angiogenesis indicates potential f or dual anti -tumor and anti -angiogenic mechanisms.  
Activating mutations in MET /HGFR have been identified in multiple patient populations, 
includ ing NSCL C, small cell lung cancer (SCL C), renal cancers, head and neck cancers, and 
hepatocellular cancer.  In addition to activation driven by  [CONTACT_147844], MET /HGFR gene 
amplification/ overexpression resulting in increased kinase activity  has been frequ ently 
observed in gastric and colorectal cancer patients.  Furthermore, MET /HGFR is also 
activated in human tumors b y other mechanisms ( eg, autocrine loops, paracrine activation 
from tumor- associated stroma).  Collectivel y, the dysregulation of MET /HGFR in tumors by  
[CONTACT_198327] /HGFR in tumor angiogenesis 
comprises a large pot ential patient population.  Most importantly , in preclinical proof of 
concept studies, both neutralizing monoclonal antibody  and RTK inhibitor exhibit 
convincing antitumor activity  in several xenograft models, which supports the concepts that 
MET is a valid target for treatment of cancer.

Page 21Mutations in Met Exon 14 were previously reported to be oncogenic drivers in preclinical 
models of lung cancer (Ma et al, 2003; Ma et al, 2006; Kong-Beltran et al, 2006).22,23,24
Given the role of MET/HGFR in regulation of cell growth, migration, and invasion of both 
tumor cells and endothelial cells, there is increasing interest in understanding the potential effectiveness of tyrosine kinase inhibitors as a treatment in NSCLC patients with tumors harboring MET Exon 14 alterations. Paik et al (2015)
21reported on [ADDRESS_235987] a partial response.  
Mechanism of Action and Pharmacodynamic Relationship to Anti-Tumor Efficacy:
PF-02341066 is a selective MET/HGFR aminopyridine tyrosine kinase inhibitor and a potent 
ATP-competitive inhibitor of recombinant, human MET/HGFR kinase activity with a mean K
iof [ADDRESS_235988] MET/HGFR and selectivity against kinases identified 
in preliminary biochemical screens was further addressed in cellular kinase phosphorylation ELISAs. In these studies, PF-02341066 inhibited HGF-stimulated or constitutive total tyrosine phosphorylation of wild type MET/HGFR with a mean IC
50value of 11 nM across a 
panel of human tumor cell lines and demonstrated similar values in mouse or canine epi[INVESTIGATOR_1231].  PF-02341066 demonstrated minimal variation (<4-fold variance) across the panel of cell lines, which were selected for these studies by [CONTACT_198328].  These data indicate a moderate but manageable potential for intrinsic resistance to PF-02341066 due to expression of efflux transporters. 
The selectivity of PF-02341066 was evaluated in a panel of cell-based assays for selected 
kinases that were closely related to MET/HGFR and/or were identified in biochemical 
assays.  In these studies, PF-02341066 selectivity for MET/HGFR (IC
50= 11 nM) was

relative to IRK and Lck, approximately 40- to 60-fold relative to Axl, Tie2, TrkA, and TrkB, and approximately 20- to 30-fold relative to RON kinase.  Further studies to investigate the likelihood of inhibition of selected targets (ie, Tie-2) in pharmacodynamic assays in vivo indicated that pharmacologically relevant inhibition of these kinases by [INVESTIGATOR_16335]-[ADDRESS_235989] nucleophosmin (NPM)-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (-ALK), an oncogenic fusion protein variant of the ALK RTK, which results from a chromosomal translocation and is implicated in the pathogenesis of human ALCL (Pulford et al, 2004).

Page 22To also investigate for potential antiangiogenic activity , PF-02341066 was shown to inhibit 
HGF -mediated HUVEC endothelial cell survival (IC 50= 11 nM ) and matrigel invasion 
(IC50= 35 nM) as well as HMVEC endothelial cell tubulogenesis in fibrin gels 
(IC50= ~80 nM ).  These data suggest that antitumor efficacy  of PF -[ADDRESS_235990] effects on tumor ce ll growth or survival as well as antiangiogenic 
mechanisms.
To evaluate the pharmacody namic (PD) inhibition of MET /HGFR b y PF-02341066, 
GTL -16gastric carcinoma tumors were harvested at several time points following oral 
administration of PF -02341066 in both single- dose and repeat -dose (steady- state) studies.  
MET /HGFR phosphory lation status in tumors was quantitated by  [CONTACT_198330] a range of 
doses.  With focus on steady -state PD studies (11- day administration) to dra w a correlation 
with tumor grow th inhibition, PF -02341066 demonstrated the following:
At 50 mg/kg/day : 100% tumor growth inhibition correlated with complete inhibition 
of MET /HGFR phosphory lation in GTL -16 tumors sustained for 24 hours.  
(25mg/kg: near co mplete inhibition of both phosphorylation and tumor growth).  At 
12.5 mg/kg/day : 60% tumor growth inhibition correlated with 80 to 90% inhibition of 
MET /HGFR phosphorylation at 1 to 8 hours which decreased to 50% to 
60% inhibition by  16 to 24 hours.
At 6.2 5 mg/kg/day : non -significant trend toward tumor growth inhibition correlated 
with 30% to 50% inhibition of MET /HGFR phosphory lation at 1 to 8 hours with full 
recovery  by 16 hours.
In summary , MET has been shown to be a valid target, and PF- 02341066 is a potent and 
selective inhibitor of MET .  PF-02341066 exhibits convincing antitumor activity  in several 
xenograft models.  Importantly , it delivers antitumor efficacy in xenograft models with a 
large safet y window, providing increased confidence that mechanism -based toxicity  will not 
be limiting in the clinic.
Objectives: 
1.Determine the safet y profile of PF -02341066 including identification of dose limiting 
toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) .
2. Determine the recommended Phase 2 doses (RP2D) and regim ens of PF-[ADDRESS_235991] of food .
4. Perform initial evaluation of PF- 02341066 related CYP3A4 inhibition using

Dose Escalation:PF-02341066 will be administered orally on an empty stomach once a day (QD) or twice a 
day (BID) in continuous 28-day cycles (see Schedule of Activities ).  However, with the 
approval of Amendment #14, PF-02341066 may be administered without regards to meals.   
There will be a lead-in period in which single-dose pharmacokinetics of PF-02341066 or MDZ (for patients participating in the MDZ sub-study) will be characterized prior to initiation of continuous dosing in the first cycle of treatment unless patients who are exempted from the Day -7 lead-in dose (see below).  With the exception of cohorts in which the evaluation of a MDZ interaction is scheduled for patients who are exempted from the Day -7 lead-in dose (see below), all other patients will receive a single dose of PF-02341066 seven days prior to the start of Cycle 1 (Day –7) in order to characterize the complete PK profile of PF-02341066 after a single dose.   With the approval of Amendment #13, only 
patients enrolled in the QD dose escalation part of the study or Asian patients enrolled in CCI
PF-[ADDRESS_235993] the Day - 7 lead- in dose.  Patients enrolled in the MDZ interaction 
sub-study will receive a single 2 mg oral dose of MDZ on Day – 7.  These patients will 
receive another single 2 -mg oral dose of MDZ concurrently with PF -02341066 on Cycle 2 
Day 1.   During the stud y, real-time pharmacokinetic monitoring will be conducted as m uch 
as possible.
After approval of Amendment #16, Day -[ADDRESS_235994] cycle.  Dose escala tion will occur in 100% increments until either of 
the following occurrences: (1) drug related toxicity of Grade 2 severity occurs in 2 or more 
patients within a dose level; or (2) mean unbound AUC 0-24exceeds 2.4 g·h/mL (the highest 
unbound AUC tested in the one -month toxicology studies).  Escalation increments will then 
become 40%.  In any cohort , if 1 patient experiences a DLT, 3 additional patients will be 
enrolled to that dose level.  If 2/3 or 2/[ADDRESS_235995] a cytogenetic abnormality as described in Section 4.1(Inclusion # 1) may enter the 
study at the previous dose level.  These patients will not participate in the midazolam 
sub-study and will not have the Day -7 lead -in dose of PF -02341066 or any corresponding 
PK assessments.  The y will be evaluated for safety but will not contribute to the DLT 
assessments.  These patients will enter the study on Day 1 of Cycle 1.   Additionally, patients 
scheduled to enroll in the RP2D enriched population cohort (see RP2D Cohorts Section) 
may be exempted from the Day -[ADDRESS_235996]/ Ethics Committee ( IRB/EC)
approval of Amendment #12, non- Asian patients will also be exempt fr om the Day -7 lead -in 
dose.   Amendment #[ADDRESS_235997] paragraph of this 
section.
Doses may not be modified until a DLT has been reached.  The study investigator may 
implement dose suspension in order to ensure patient safety; this will be considered 
dose-limiting toxicity for the purpose of dose -escalation if PF -02341066 has to be suspended 
for more than 3 days.  Patients who discontinue treatment before completing Cycle 1 (DLT 
evaluation) for reasons other than treatm ent-related toxicity will be replaced.
One or more lower dose level(s) may be tested in search of the MTD, defined as the dose 
level immediately below that in wh ich 2/3 or 2/6 patients experience DLTs.  Dose escalation

2) exposure plateaus as the dose is increased and 3) MTD cannot be reached within a 
reasonable dose range (up to 2000 mg).  Th e MTD for both QD and BID dosing may be 
determined.
MDZ interaction sub -study: The potential for CYP3A inhibition due to PF -02341066 will be 
evaluated using MDZ as a CYP3A4 substrate probe at 3 dose levels of PF- 02341066: the 
next higher dose after the ini tial dose, the efficacious dose, and the RP2D (see Figure 4 ).  
The MDZ interaction study will be conducted starting in the second dose cohort, and will be 
conducted in a higher dose in which the trough unbound plasma concentration of 
PF-02341066 at the steady state will equal or exceed the projected target unbound 
concent rations (8.1- 12.8 nM) if target unbound plasma concentrations of PF -[ADDRESS_235999] of repeat PF -02341066 
administration on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam.  If a significant change in MDZ 
clearance (>3- fold increase in MDZ AUC in all 3 patie nts, or > 5-fold increase in 2 or more 
patients) is observed at any PF -[ADDRESS_236000] of PF -02341066 on CYP3A activity will be evaluated at the RP2D.  
Eight evaluable patients will be required fo r the MDZ interaction study in one of the RP2D 
cohorts (see RP2D Cohorts Section).  Patients enrolled in the MDZ interaction sub- study will 
receive a single 2 mg oral dose of MDZ on Day – 7 and another single 2 -mg oral dose of 
MDZ concurrently with PF -02341066 on Cycle 2 Day 1.
Rifampin interaction sub- study:
This sub -study is to determine the effect of the co -administration of rifampin onthe
multiple -dose plasma pharmacokinetic profile of PF-02341066.  The starting dose of 
PF-[ADDRESS_236001] of care therapy is available will be enrolled into this 
sub-studyto obtain 8 evaluable patients.  The rationale for the PF -02341066 starting dose of 
250mg BID is provided below.
In vitro studies demonstrated that CYP3A4/5 arethe major enzymes involved in the 
metabolic clearance of PF -02341066. Co-administration of a single 250 mg PF-02341066 
dose with rifampin (600 mg QD), a strong CYP3A inducer, resulted in 81.8% and 68 .5% 
decreases in PF -02341066 AUC infand C max, respectively, compared to when PF -02341066 
was given alone.  As PF-02341066 is also a CYP3A inhibitor, t he magnitude of the effects of 
CYP3A inducers on steady state PF -02341066 exposures may differ from those seen after 
single doses. A mathematical modeling approach based on preclinical and clinical data 
indicate that rifampin co-administration is likel y to result in an approximately 36% decrease 
in the PF- 02341066 AUC. Based on t hesefindings no safety issue s inusing a 250 mg BID 
PF-02341066 dose in combination with rifampin are anticipated.

Page 27Note that the Rifampin interaction sub-study will be enrolled prior to the enroll ment of 
patients on the itraconazole interaction sub- study.
Itraconazole interaction sub-study: 
This sub- study is to determine the effect of itrac onazole on the multiple -dose plasma 
pharmacokinetics of PF -02341066 when itraconazole is co- administered.  Ifmultiple -dosing 
of PF-02341066 in combination with itraconazole is tolerable (as defined in the T RIAL 
DESIGN Section), a cohort of patients may be also enrolled to determine the effect of 
itraconazole on single an d multiple -dose plasma pharmacokinetic profiles of PF-02341066.  
As of Protocol Amendment #22, the Single and Multiple -Dose Design will no longer be 
performed.  The starting dose of PF -[ADDRESS_236002] 8evaluable patients for multiple -dose PK. 
The magnitude of the effects of CYP3A inhibitors on steady state PF -02341066 expo sures 
may differ from those seen after a single dose ofPF-023 [ZIP_CODE] as PF- 02341066 is also a 
CYP3A inhibitor.   An autoinhibition -mediated change in apparent clearance of 
PF-02341066 was observed during chronic PF-02341066 treatment.  There are limited data
with single doses of PF -02341066 administered with ketoconazole (200 mg BID), a strong 
CYP3A inhibitor.  Co -administration of a single 150 mg oral dose of PF- 02341066 in the 
presence of ketoconazole, resulted in increases in PF -02341066 systemic exposure, with 
PF-02341066 AUC infand C maxvalues that were approximately 3.2 fold and 1.4 fold higher, 
respectively, than those seen when PF -02341066 was administered alone. SIMCYP (a 
population based pharmacokinetics modeling simulator) modeling based on preclinical and 
clinical data, predict a 2- fold increase in PF -[ADDRESS_236003] the starting dose of PF-02341066 accordingly. 
Please see Appendix 7for further details.
RP2D Cohorts: The RP2D will be determined as a dose below or equal to MTD, at which 
PF-02341066 is unlikely to cause an inhibition of CYP3A4 activity.  There will be two RP2D 
cohorts :  
1.Thefirst RP2D cohort will evaluate drug-drug interactions. This includes the MDZ ,

NSCLC that is positive for ALK chromosomal translocations or gene amplifications will not be allowed to enter the Enriched Other cohort. As of the PACL dated 07 December 2017, the remaining 13 open enrollment slots in the Enriched Other cohort were assigned specifically to NSCLC patients with tumors harboring MET Exon 14 alterations rather than the broader Enriched Other cohort.  Thus, the Enriched Other cohort will be open only for enrollment of NSCLC patients with MET Exon 14 alterations. As of the Investigator Communication Letter dated January 7, 2019, further enrollment of NSCLC patients with tumors harboring MET exon 14 alterations is closed.
f. ALK Marker Negative NSCLC Cohort #1: This cohort will consist of NSCLC 
patients who are negative for the ALK translocation as determined by [CONTACT_198332] (FISH) assay used in Protocols A8081007 and A8081005.  A minimum of 25 to a maximum of 50 evaluable patients will be enrolled into this cohort.  Patients will be dosed at the RP2D, ie, 250 mg BID of PF-02341066, with a cycle length of 3 weeks. Enrollment is closed with 47 patients treated.

sub-study.  Clinical sites in Korea will not participate in this sub -study.  Depending upon the 
overall results from the RP2D cohorts, a different dose/schedule may  be tested in additional 
coho rts.
Statistical Methods:
This is a Phase 1, open- label, multi- center, dose escalation study .  The number of patients to 
be enrolled will depend upon the observed safet y profile and stud y objectives, which will 
determine the number of patients per dose lev el, the number of dose escalations andthe 
number of cohorts.  Approximately  600 patients will be enrolled in the study  including 
patients in the dose escalation and RP2D cohorts [seeFigure 1].  All patients who r eceive at 
least [ADDRESS_236006] pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters including 
AUC 0-last, Cmaxand T maxfor individual patients.  Descriptive statistics of the PK parameters 
will be prov ided in tabular form.  The plasma concentration- time data of MDZ will be 
analyzed using non-compartmental methods to derive standard PK parameters including 
AUC 0-last, Cmaxand T max.  In the RP2D cohort, a mixed effects model will be used to analyze 
log-transformed MDZ AUC 0-lastfor evaluation of the potential CYP3A4 inhibition due to 
PF-02341066.   In the rifampin and itraconazole drug- drug interaction sub- studies, a mixed 
effect model will be used to analyze log-transformed PF- [ADDRESS_236007], inhibitio n of CYP3A and the 
comparison of anti -tumor effects in ALK marker negative NSCLC patients and ALK marker 
positive NSCLC patients (from Protocol sA8081007 and/or A8081005, as appropriate ).  In 
the food effect sub -study, a mixed effect model will be used to analyze log transformed 
AUC 0-lastbetween fasting and fed conditions for the evaluation of the food effect.

part of the study or Asian patients enrolled in any cohort will have the Day -7 lead -in dose.
32. Once Amendment #1 2 is approved by [CONTACT_1201] /EC, an ophthalmology examination will be performed at screening for all new patients.  The ophthalmology examination should 
be repeated during the study when visual disturbances have been observed and when the re is an increase in g rade for visual disturbances (includes all ongoing patients).   The 
ophthalmology examination should include ocular characteristics, visual acuity, fundoscopy and slit lamp examination.  All NSCLC patients enrolled after Amendment #17 is 
approved by [CONTACT_1201] /ECwill undergo additional special ophthalmological testing as described in Section 7.3until written notification by [CONTACT_1034].   As of the Note To File
issued 18 March 2016, the following ophthalmologic tests (added in Protocol Amendment #17) are no longer required for NSCLC patients: refractive er ror, pupil size, 
intraocular pressure, ocular coherence tomography, dilated fundus photography.  All ophthal mology examinations sh ould be performed by [CONTACT_4674].  Time points of 
this special testing aredesignated by “[ ]” in the Schedule of Activities Table and are performed at Screening, Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 3 Day 1, one year, an d yearly
thereafter.  For NSCLC patients on a 4-week cycle , the yearly ophthalmology examination will be done at Cycle 14 Day 1, and every 13 cycles thereafter .  For NSCLC 
patients on a 3-week cycle, the yearly ophthalmology examinati on will be done at Cyc le18 Day 1 and every 17cycles thereafter . These tests should also be done within 2- 8 
weeks after discontinuation of PF -02341066 .  There is a 2week window for the yearly ophthalmology examination.
33. Hypogonadism Laboratory Tests (ma le patients only): Allmale patients enrolled into the MET -amplified NSCLC and Enriched Other cohorts after IRB/EC approval of

luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, dihydroepi[INVESTIGATOR_198283], estradiol and prolactin.  Blood draws MUST be taken before PF -02341066 dosing and 
between 07:00 and 10:00 a.m. and, for each individu al patient, the time of the draw should be as consistent across visits as feasible.  If either total testosterone or free 
testosterone  decrease to a value that is both 25% lower than baseline and below the lower limit of normal, then a repeat laboratory t est of both of these parame ters must be 
performed at the next clinic visit to confirm hypogonadism.  Note : Patients enrolled in clinical sites in Japan will not participate in hypogonadism testing.  SeeSection 7.2, 
Appendix 9, Appendix 11,and Appendix 12for further details .
34. Contraceptive Check: As of IRB/EC approval of A mendment #21, m ale patients who are able to father children and female patients who are of childbearing potential will 
need to affirm that they meet the criteria for correct use of 2 of the selected methods of contraception.  The investigator or his or her designee will discuss with the patient the 
need to use 2 highly effective contraception methods consistently and correctly and document such conversation and, upon IRB/IC approval of Amendment #23, the patient’s 
affirmation in the patient’s chart.  In add ition, the investigator or his or her designee will instruct the patient to call immediately if one or both selected contrace ption methods 
are discontinued, or if pregnancy is known or suspected in the patient or the patient’s pa rtner.  SeeSection 4.5.[ADDRESS_236032] OF FIGURES ................................ ................................ ................................ ................. 41

1.INTRODUCTION
1.1.Background
Human cancers comprise a diverse array  of diseases that collectivel y are one of the leading 
causes of death in developed countries t hroughout the world (Americ an Cancer Societ y, 
2005).1  The progression of cancers is caused b y a complex series of multiple genetic and 
molecular events including gene mutations, chromosomal translocations, and karyotypic 
abnormalities (H anahan & Weinberg, 2000).3  Although the underl ying genetic causes of 
cancer are both diverse and complex, each cancer ty pe has been observed to exhibit common 
traits and acquired capa bilities that facilitate it s progression.  These acquired capabilities 
include dy sregulated cell growth, sustained ability to recruit blood vessels (ie, angiogenesis), 
and ability  of tumor cells to spread locall y as well as metastasize to secondary organ s ites 
(Hanahan & Weinberg, 2 000).3  Therefore, the ability  to identify  novel therapeutic agents 
that 1) inhibit molecular targets that are altered during cancer progression or 2) target 
multiple processes that are common to cancer progression in a variet y of tumors is predicted 
to yield improved therapeutic benefit.

PF-02341066 is a small- molecule inhibitor of the MET (mesench ymal-epi[INVESTIGATOR_198284] )/HGFR receptor tyrosine kinase.  The rationale for use of this mechanism to treat 
cancer is supported b y an emerging paradigm in oncology  that robust clinical efficacy  can be 
obtained with well -tolerated inhibitors directed toward oncogenic t yrosine kinases that are 
geneticall y altered through activating mutations, gene tr anslocations, or gene amplification.

or otherwise abnormall y activate d RTKs in various human cancers (Christensen et al, 2005).2  
Tumor ty pes in which MET /HGFR was reported to be genetically  altered by [CONTACT_198334] a strong unmet medical need such as 
renal, metastatic colorectal, glioma, non -small cell lung, gastric, and head and neck cancers 
(Christensen et al, 2005).2  In addition, PF -02341066 demonstrated potent activity  agains t 
NPM -ALK, an oncogenic fusion protein variant of the Anaplastic Lymph oma Kinase, which 
results from a chromosomal translocation which is implicated in the pathogenesis of human 
anaplastic large cell l ymphoma (Pulford et al, 2004).4  In addition to the rationale for 
PF-02341066 ba sed on the genetic d ysregulation of its ty rosine kinase targets, an additional 
rationale is based on its predicted abilit y to target multiple processes that are common to 
cancer progression in a variet y of tumors.  Inappropriate activation of MET /HGFR (inc luding 
wild-type MET ) is implicated in dy sregulation of multiple tumor oncogenic processes such 
as mitogenesis, survival, angiogenesis, invasive growth, and especially  in the m etastatic 
process (Christensen et al, 2005).2  Furthermore, the expression of MET and HGF, its sole, 
high-affinity  ligand, were demonstrated to correlate with poor prognosis or metastatic 
progression in a number of major human cancers (Christensen et al, 2005).2  The other 
molecular target of PF -02341066, NPM -ALK, is implicated in the dy sregulation of cell 
proliferation and apoptosis in AL CL lymphoma cells (Pulfor d et al, 2004).4  Consistent with 
its pr edicted mechanism of action, PF -02341066 inhibited target -dependent tumor cell 
proliferation or invasion, induced tumor cell apoptosis, and inhibited angiogenesis in 
noncl inical tumor models.  Oral administration of PF -02341066 also demonstrated efficacy , 
including marked cy toreductive antitumor activity , in several tumor models that expressed 
activated MET /HGFR or NPM -ALK.  The collective rationale for investigation o f 
PF-02341066 in clinical studies is built on genetic alteration of its molecular targets, its 
predicted abilit y to target multiple processes that are common to cancer progression, and 
preclinical efficacy  data. 
Safety:
The primary  PF-[ADDRESS_236044] (rat, dog, monkey ), hem atopoietic sy stem (rat, dog, monkey ), kidney s 
(rat), reproductive organs (rat), and activel y growing long bones (rat).  Additional effects 
related to PF -02341066 administration involved the cardiovascular s ystem based on safet y 
pharmacology  studies, and ge netic toxicity  findings.  Other findings of uncertain risk to 
humans include the decreased cellularity  in lymphoid organs, elevated liver enzy mes, 
potential for photo toxicity , and effects on the salivary  glands.
Gastrointestinal Effects: Clinical signs of diarrhea were observed in rats (500 mg/kg/day ), 
dogs ( 6mg/kg/day ), and monkey s (50 mg/kg/day ).  Focal edema was observed in the 
gastric submucosa in rats given 500 mg/kg/day  for 4 day s, as well as focal ulceration, 
inflammation, and glandular hy perplasia in one female.  Gastrointestinal effects were not 
observed in the 1- month study  in rats, where doses were tolerated for the full term of the

escalation range -finding study  in dogs.  Following single doses of 10, 25, and 40 mg/kg, 
severe gastrointestinal effects were observed, including blood y emesis and diarrhea, along 
with mucou s membranes in the feces.  Histopathological examination of the intestines 
revealed blood -filled dilated mucosal and submucosal vessels (congestion) and luminal 
contents of mucus admixed with low numbers of neutrophils.  I n the 1 -month study  in dogs, 
PF-02341066 at  6mg/kg/day  induced emesis, the incidence and frequency  of which 
decreased as t he study  progressed, and occasional diarrhea.  There was no effect on food 
consumption or body  weight, and no histopathological correlate was identified at the end of
the study .  Diarrhea and soft feces were also observed in monkey s given 50 mg/kg/day  of 
PF-02341066.  A decrease in phosphorus observed in this study  may  have been related to 
decreased intestinal absorption.  Marked cecal erosion and ulceration were obser ved in one 
monkey  euthanized moribund on Day 21. 
Kidney  Effects: Microscopic evidence of minimal to mild renal cortical tubule vacuolation 
was observed following 28 day s of dosing in male rats treated with  50mg/kg/day  of 
PF-02341066.  Urinal ysis reveale d significant decreases in urine pH from 50 mg/kg/day  in 
males and at 150 mg/kg/day  in fem ales.  The mechanism for renal tubular vacuolation is not 
known, however HGF is highl y expressed in the kidney tubular epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130] (Birchmeier, 
2003)5with reported cy toprotective effects on renal tubular epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130] (L iu, 1998).6  
Testes Effects: Microscopic evidence of minimal testicular pachy tene spermatocy te 
degeneration was ob served in rats given 50mg/kg/day  of PF -02341066 for 28 day s.  The 
mechanism responsible for the degenerative effects in the testes is not understood, however 
MET is known to be expressed on human seminiferous epi[INVESTIGATOR_198285] (Depuy dt, 1996).7
Hematopoietic Effects :Bone marrow h ypocellularity  was observed in toxicity  studies in rats 
and monkey s with PF -02341066.  Repeated administration of PF -02341066 for 28 days 
caused bo ne marrow hy pocellularity  at doses of 150 mg/kg/day  (rats, males only ) and 
50mg/kg/day  (monkey s).  Minimal bone marrow hy pocellularity  was also produced in rats 
of both sexes when PF- 02341066 was administered for shorter time duration (2 day s at 
2000 mg/k g and 4 day s at 500 mg/kg/day ).  Bone marrow h ypocellularity was not observed 
in dogs, however a decrease in white blood cells was identified following 3 single doses up 
to 40 mg/kg and 7 days of PF -02341066 at 20 mg/kg/day .  In monkey s, cytospin examinati on 
showed evidence of increased numbers of macrophages and debris consistent with bone 
marrow c ytotoxicity , and correlated with the bone marrow h ypocellularity observed 
histopathologicall y.  Hematological anal ysis revealed decreased reticulocyte counts and
suggested suppression of ery throid production within the bone marrow.  In addition, WBC 
precur sors lacked granulation characteristicall y present in these cells suggesting potential 
peroxidase deficiency  in granulocy tes.  This change in granulation was also noted in dogs 
given 20 mg/kg/day  for 28 day s.  Vacuolated ly mphocy tes were identified in male rats given 
150mg/kg/day , the significance of which is unclear. 
Lym phoid Tissue Effects : Lymphoid depletion was observed in the thy mus, spleen, ly mph 
nodes, or GALT in rats and dogs given PF- 02341066.  Findings in rats given 500 mg/kg/day  
for 4 days were attributed to stress (stress leukogram and clinical signs of intolerance were

in rats at  50mg/kg/day , however, these findings were considered of uncertain origin .  
Decreased th ymus weight ( 6mg/kg/day ) correlated to thy mic l ymphoid depletion in male 
dogs given 20 mg/kg/day PF -02341066 for 28 days, and was also considere d to be of 
uncertain relationship to treatment. 
Cardiovascular Effects: In vivo cardiovascular effects were observed in the safet y 
pharmacology  study  in anesthetized dogs.  PF -02341066 administration was associated with 
decreases in heart rate and increas es in LVEDP at 84 and 164 ng/mL free plasma 
concentration.  There were also statistically  signi ficant differences compared with 
vehicle -treated animals in my ocardial contractility  (LV+dP/dt) at 164 ng/mL  free plasma 
concentration.  Although there was a sta tistically  significant decrease in myocardial 
contractility , it should be noted that the actual myocardial contractility  values in the treated 
animals were similar to the pre -dose values.  The main effects of PF -02341066 on ECG 
parameters were statisticall y significant increases in PR interval, QRS, and QT interval at 
84and 164 ng/mL free plasma co ncentration.  The prolongation of PR- interval, QRS and 
QT-interval is probabl y due to the reduction in heart rate observed at these doses.  
Monophasic action pot ential duration during cardiac pacing is a heart rate- independent index 
of cardiac repolarization.  There were statistically  significant increases in MAPD 100at sinus 
rhythm at 84 and 164 ng/mL  free plasma concentration.  The increases in MAPD 100at sinus 
rhythm were consistent with the decreases observed in heart rate.  The plasma concentrations 
ofPF-02341066 achieved in this study  were up to 44 times the free efficacious plasma level 
predicted in humans (8.1 nM or 3.7 ng/mL).  In vitro, PF -02341066 block ed potassium 
currents or human ether -a-go-go-related gene (hERG) channel conduction with I C50and IC20

tension model, in vitro dog isolated Purkinje fibers, and in freshl y isolated Guinea pig 
ventricular m yocytes, PF -[ADDRESS_236045] on MAPD 100during pacing in this study .  The decrease in di astolic blood pressure 
observed at a free plasma concentration of 164 ng/mL  may  reflect the calcium channel 
antagonist effects observed in the rat isolated aorta model.  The nonclinical data suggest that 
free plasma concentrations greater than or equal to 84 ng/mL may  produce changes in the 
heart rate and at higher free plasma concentrations (164 ng/mL) changes in diastolic blood 
pressure.
Bone Effects: Repeated administration of PF -02341066 for 28 day s caused minimal 
decreased bone formation at the primary spongiosa of growing long bones at a dose of 
150mg/kg/day  in male rats.  Though an off -target relationship cannot be ruled out, reports of 
in vitro data descri be possible autocrine regulation of osteoclasts, paracrine regulation of 
osteoblasts (Grano, 19 96),8and modulation of bone resorptive activity  of osteoclasts in 
response to HGF (Fuller, 1995),9that may  be suggestive of a pharmacological effect on bone.  
This toxicity  is not expected in the adult patient population, whose growth plates are inactive.
Liver Effects : An elevation in liver enzy mes (alanine aminotransferas e [ALT], aspartate 
aminotransferase [AST ]) was observed in rats and monkey s given PF -02341066. Rats given 
2000 mg/kg/day  for 2 day s, 500 mg/kg/day  for 4 day s, or 50mg/kg/day  for 28 day s showed

Genotoxic Effects: PF -[ADDRESS_236047] condition.  I n addition to the clastogenic response, the 
kinetochore staining results from the in vitro micronucleus evaluation and the ob servation of 
polyploidy  in the cy togenetics assay  were consistent with an aneugenic response to

micronucleated normochromatic ery throcy tes) were observed at all doses eval uated in vivo 
(rat) in males onl y.  The increases in micronuclei were associated with changes i n other bone 
marrow parameters consistent with bone marrow toxicity . 
Phototoxic Effects: PF -02341066 potential for phototoxicity  was evaluated due to significan t 
absorbance in the UVA -UVB/visible range from 290 to 700 nm with a molar extinction 
coefficien t of ≥ 1000 L/Mol/cm, and its photodegradative propert y.  PF -[ADDRESS_236048] ying sunscreen when outdoors.

1.2.Rationale
MET /HGFR has been well characterized for its role in regulation of cell growth, mig ration, 
and invasion of both tumor cells and endothelial cells.  An extensive body  of literature 
indicates that MET /HGFR is one of the receptor ty rosine kinases (RTKs) most frequently  
mutated or otherwise abnormally  activated in late -stage human cancer.  When activated, 
MET /HGFR play s a critical role in regulation of tumor oncogenic processes such as 
mitogenesi s, survival, and invasive growth, and especiall y in the metastatic process.  
Additionally , the emerging role of MET/HGFR in the regula tion of tumor angiogenesis 
indicates potential for dual anti- tumor and anti -angiogenic mechanisms.  Activating 
mutations i n MET /HGFR have been identified in multiple patient populations, including 
NSCL C(Non Small Cell L ung Cancer) ,SCLC(Small Cell Lung Cancer) ,renal cancers, 
head and neck cancers, and hepatocellular cancer.  I n addition to activation driven by  
[CONTACT_147844], MET/HGFR gene amplification/ overexpression resulting in increased kinase 
activity  has been frequently  observed in gastric a nd colorectal cancer patients.  Furthermore, 
MET /HGFR is also activated in human tumors by  [CONTACT_27887] ( eg, autocrine loops, 
paracrine activation from tumor -associated stroma).  Collectively , the d ysregulation of 
MET /HGFR in tumors by [CONTACT_198335] /HGFR 
in tumor angiogenesis comprises a large potential patient population.  Most importantly ,in 
preclinical proof of concept studies, both neutralizing monoclonal antibody and RTK 
inhibitor exhibit convincing antitumor activity  in several xenograft models, which supports 
the concepts that MET is a valid target for treatment of cancer.
Mutations i n MET Exon 14 were previousl y reported to be oncogenic driver s in preclinical 
models of lung cancer (Ma et al, 2003; Ma et al, 2006; Kong -Beltran et al, 2006 ).22,23,24
Given the role of MET /HGFR in regulation of ce ll growth, migration, and invasion of both 
tumor cells and endothelial cells, there is increasing interest in understanding the potential 
effectiveness of t yrosin e kinase inhibitors as a treatment in NSCL C patients with tumors

Page 49harboring MET Exon 14 al terations. Paik et al (2015) reported on [ADDRESS_236049] in human (FIH) trial in cancer patients has 
been determined to be 50 mg dail y, based on information derived from the 1 -month repeat 
dose toxicology  studies in rats and dogs (see current IB).
The dose s tested in the 1 -month toxicology  rat study  were 10, 50, and 150 mg/kg/day  orall y 
and the doses in the 1 -month dog study  were 1, 6, and 20 mg/kg/day  orally.  I n the rat study , 
there were no deaths at any  dose levels.  The NOAEL identified in the rat study was 
10mg/kg/day .  Onl y mild to moderate toxicities were observe d at the highest dose 
(150 mg/kg), indicating that the STD 10in rats was greater than 150 mg/kg (900 mg/m2).  
There was a significant gender difference suggesting that the male rat was more s ensitive 
than the female, associated with increased plasma exposure of PF -02341066 in male rats.  In 
the dog stud y, no serious, irreversible toxicities were observed at an y dose level.  Hence, the 
NOAEL was determined to be 20 mg/kg/day  in the dog study .
According to DeGeorge et al. (1998),10the currently  accepted algorithm for calculating a 
starting dose in clinical trials for cy totoxic agents is to use one -tenth of the dose that causes 
severe toxicity  (or deat h) in 10% of the rodents (STD 10) on a mg/m2basis, provided this 
starting dose does not cause serious, irreversible toxicity  in a non -rodent species.  If 
irreversible toxicities are produced at the proposed starting dose in non -rodents or if the 
non-rodent is known to be the more appropriate animal model, then the start ing dose would 
generall y be one -sixth of the highest dose tested in the non -rodent that does not cause severe, 
irreversible toxicity .  Since one -tenth of the highest dose tested in rats (90 mg/m2, equivalent 
to 4.5 mg/kg in dogs) did not cause an y serious, irreversible toxicity  in dogs, the starting dose 
in humans can be estimated as 90 mg/m2, ie,150mg dail y dose, assuming body surface area 
of 1.[ADDRESS_236050] a PF- 02341066 plasma exposure 
(stead y-state plasma AUC of 3.26 g·hr/mL) exceeding the NOAEL (AUC of 2.16 g·hr/mL 
at 10 mg/kg) in male rats, the most sensitive species.  Furthermore, since the plasma protein 
binding for PF -02341066 is lower in humans (90.7%) than in rats (94.3%), the unboun d 
AUC (AUC u) in humans (0.303 g·hr/mL) at the 150 mg starting dose will be higher than 
that at the NOAEL in rats (0.123 g·hr/mL).  In humans, a dose of 61 mg is expected to y ield 
an unbound drug plasma AUC approximately  equal to that observed in rats at the NOAEL.  
Since the exposure-based human dose projection provides a lower estimate for the clinical 
starting dose (61 mg) than that based on 1/10 of the STD 10in rats (150 mg), this dose

as the starting dose for the FIH study.
1.2.2. Rationale for Evaluation of Midazolam (MDZ) Interaction
PF-02341066 is predominantly metabolized via the CYP3A isozymes in human liver 
microsomes and hepatocytes.  PF-02341066 also showed time-dependent inhibition of 
CYP3A isozymes in human liver microsomes with a k inactof 0.11 min-1and K Iof 3.0μM.  
Based on these values, the projected PF-02341066 therapeutic dose of 100 mg (C max, free
19 nM) is predicted to increase the systemic exposure (AUC) of co-administered drugs that 
are CYP3A substrates by [CONTACT_3450] 80% due to CYP3A inhibition.  There is a potential 
for more potent inhibition in patients receiving higher doses, leading to substantial drug interactions with commonly coadministered drugs that are CYP3A substrates.  In addition, PF-[ADDRESS_236051] in Human (FIH) study to assess the potential PF-02341066 related CYP3A inhibition. 
MDZ is a benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_198286].  It undergoes extensive 
metabolism via CYP3A4/5 and is a widely accepted in-vivo probe for assessing CYP3A activity.  In the current trial, midazolam pharmacokinetics (PK) following a single oral 2-mg dose will be evaluated before and after repeated daily administration of PF-02341066 at 3 dose levels (the next higher dose after the initial dose, the efficacious dose, and the RP2D),in order to assess the effects of PF-[ADDRESS_236052] selection of the RP2D and to determine if there is any need for concomitant medication restrictions or dose modifications in future studies.

5.TRIAL TREATMENTS
For the purposes of this study , and per International Conference on Harmonisation (I CH) 
guidelines, investigat ional product is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active 
ingredient being tested in a clinical trial, including a product with a marketing authorization 
when used or assembled (formulated or packaged) in a way  different from the approved 
form, or whe n used for an unapproved ind ication, or when used to gain further information 
about an approved use (ICH E6 1.33).  
For this study , the investigational product is PF -02341066.
PF-02341066 will be administered orally  once or twice a day  in continuous 28 -day cycles 
except 21- day cy cles for patients in the ALK marker negative NSCL C cohort (see Schedule 
of Activities and Appendix 8).
There will be a lead -in period in which single -dose pharmacokinetics of PF -02341066 or 
MDZ (for patients participating in the MDZ sub -study) will be characterized prior to 
initiation of continuous dosing in the first cycle of treatment.  W ith the exception of cohorts 
in which the evaluation of a MDZ interaction is scheduled or patients who are exempted 
from the Day -7 lead -in dose (see below), all other patients will receive a single dose of 
PF-02341066

Page 61PF-02341066 seven days prior to the start of Cycle 1 (Day –7) in order to characterize the 
complete PK pro file of PF -02341066 after a single dose.   With the approval of 
Amendment #13, only patients enrolled in the QD dose escalation part of the study or Asian 
patients enrolled in any cohort will have the Day - 7 lead -in dose.  Patients enrolled in the 
MDZ inter action sub-study will receiv e a single 2 mg oral dose of MDZ on Day –7.  These 
patients will receive another single [ADDRESS_236067] that a discontinuous regimen or another dosing frequency may be preferable.  If a 
BID dosing regimen is incorporated, all study assessments will be based on morning do sing 
(Day -7 dosing will still be a single PF -02341066 dose).  Dosing of oral PF-[ADDRESS_236068] cycle.  Dose escalation will occur in 100% incremen ts until either of 
the follo wing occurrences: (1) drug related toxicity of Grade 2 severity occurs in 2 or more 
patients within a dose level; or (2) mean unbound AUC 0-24exceeds 2.4 g·h/mL (the highest 
unbound AUC tested in the one- month toxicology studie s).  Escalation increments w ill then 
become 40%.  In any cohort, if 1 patient experiences a DLT, 3 additional patients will be 
enrolled to that dose level.  If 2/3 or 2/6 patients experience a DLT, no further dose 
escalation will occur (see Figure 4 ).  Patients will continue treatment at their assigned dose 
level for at least [ADDRESS_236069] a cytogenetic abnormality as described in Section 4.1(Inclusion # 1) may enter the 
study at the previous dose level.   These patients will not participate in the midazolam 
sub-study and will not have the Day -7 lead -in dose of PF -02341066 or any corresponding 
PK assessments.  They wil l be evaluated for safety but will not contribute to the MTD 
assessments.  These patients will enter the study on Day 1 of Cycle 1.   Additionally, patients 
scheduled to enroll in the RP2D enriched population cohort (see RP2D Cohorts Section) 
may b e exempted from the Day -7 lead -in dose depending on the their overall medical 
condition.  This exemption will be granted on a case-by- case basis as agreed upon by [CONTACT_198340] .  Upon IRB /ECapproval of Amendment #12, non- Asian patients 
will also be exempt from the Day - 7 lead -in dose.  Amendment #13 extends the requirements 
as described in the second paragraph of this section.   Upon IRB/EC approval of Amendment 
#16, Day -[ADDRESS_236070] occurred (end of Cycle 1) with the next higher dose 
PF-[ADDRESS_236071] 2/3 or 2/6 patients e xperiencing DLT.  The Sponsor with the agreement of the 
investigators may expand the cohort beyond six patients to better define the safety profile of 
this cohort in the search for the MTD.  The MTD may be determined for both QD and BID 
dosing.  As of Prot ocol Amendment #20,the MTD determined from the QD dose escalation 
cohort will not be expanded beyond 6patients.
Definition of DLT
DLT will have occurred when the patient has one or more of the toxicities noted in the
Table 1.  To deter mine dose escalation between cohorts, a DLT must occur within the first 
28 days of treatment (end of Cycle 1).  Toxicities will be graded according to the NCI 
CTCAE Version 3.0 (see Table 1).
Table 1.Dose Limiting Toxicities
Toxicity Category Toxicity/Grade
Hematologic Prolonged grade 4 neutropenia for >7 days
a Febrile neutropenia, defined here as grade 4 neutropenia with fever 
>38.5 C, both sustained over a 24 ho ur period.
Neutropenic infection: Grade 3 neutropenia with Grade 3 infection
Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with bleeding or grade 4 lasting 7 days 
Lymphopenia is not considered a DLT unless accompanied by [CONTACT_80601].
Other non -hematologic toxicity Grade 3 or 4 toxicities (ex cept for alopecia, Grade 3/4 hypophosphatemia, 
grade 3 hypertension with controlled blood pressure [<140/90], and 
Grade 3/4 hyperuricemia without signs and symptoms of gout).  Nausea, 
vomiting or diarrhea must persist at grade 3 or 4 despi[INVESTIGATOR_198290] l 
therapy.
aFebrile neutropenia qualifies as a DLT only if the fever and neutropenia are documented to be coincident 
in time and reconfirmed.
Doses may not be modified until a DLT has been reached.  The study investigator may 
implement dose suspension i n order to ensure patient safety; this will be considered 
dose-limiting toxicity for the purpose of dose -escalation if PF -02341066 has to be suspended 
for more than 3 days.  The occurrence of a DLT necessitates immediate interruption of the 
scheduled study treatment in that patient.  Resumption of study treatment for patients 
experiencing DLTs is permitted, contingent on the return of the DLT to <Grade 1 severity 
and interruption or delay in treatment for no more than 4 weeks.  Resum ption of treatment 
after resolution of a DLT will be at the next lower dose level tested (or 50% lower if the DLT 
occurs with the first dose level).  Patients who discontinue treatment before completing 
Cycle 1 (DLT evaluation period ) for reasons other than treatment -related toxi city ( ie,missed 
appointments, misplaced study drug supplies, development of coexisting medical condition 
rendering the patient unable to swallow medication, development of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_198291]) will be replaced.
To contribu te information to the assessment of safety for any dose level, a patient must 
receive at least 75% of the planned PF -02341066 doses or experience a treatment -related 
AE that prompts early treatment interruption or discontinuation.

level immediately below that in which 2/3 or 2/6 patients experience DLTs.  Dose escalation 
may be stopped if 1) MAD produces PF -[ADDRESS_236072] 5 -fold 
greater than the projected target concentration, 2) exposure plateaus as the dose is increased 
and 3) MTD cannot be reached within a reasonable dose range (up to 2000 mg).
Midazolam interaction sub- study
The potential for CYP3A inhibition due to PF -02341066 will be eval uated using MDZ as a 
CYP3A4 substrate probe at 3 dose levels of PF -02341066: the next higher dose after the 
initial dose, the efficacious dose, and the RP2D (see Figure 4 ).  The MDZ interaction study 
will be conducted starting in the seco nd dose cohort, and at a higher dose ( ie,the predicted 
efficacious dose) in which the trough unbound plasma concentration of PF -02341066 at the 
steady state will equal or exceed t he projected target unbound plasma concentrations

PF-[ADDRESS_236074] of PF -02341066 on CYP3A activ ity will be evaluated at the RP2D.  Eight 
evaluable patients will be required fo r the MDZ interaction study in one of the RP2D cohorts 
(see RP2D Cohorts Section).  The results of the MDZ interaction sub-study at the RP2D will 
be used to determine if there is any need for concomitant medication restrict ions or dose 
modifications in future PF- 02341066 studies. 
Patients enrolled in the MDZ interaction sub-study will receive a single 2 mg oral dose of 
MDZ on Day –7 and another single 2 -mg oral dose of MDZ concurrently with PF -02341066 
on Cycle 2 Day 1 (mor ning dose if the BID regimen is employed) .

be allowed to enter th e enriched cohort .As of the PACL  dated 07 December 
2017, the remaini ng 13 open enrollment slots in the Enriched Other cohort 
were assigned specifically  to NSCL C patients with tumors harboring MET 
Exon 14 alterations rather than the broader Enriched Other cohort.  Thus, the 
Enriched Other cohort will be open only for enrollm ent of NSCL C patients 
with MET E xon 14 alterations. As of the Investigator Communication L etter 
dated January  7, 2019, further enrol lment of NSCLC patients with tumors 
harboring MET exon 14 alterations is closed.
ALK M arker Negative NSCLC Cohort #1:

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 68Dose Reductions
Intrapatient dose reduction after Cycle 1 (DLT evaluation period) will be permitted once a 
patient has experienced unexpected toxicity provided the criteria for patient withdrawal fr om 
study treatment have not been met.  All intrapatient dose reductions are relative to the next 
lowest dose of the current cycle (dose level).  Dose reduction of the regimen will be 
dependent on the attribution of toxicity as PF-02341066- related or possib ly related to 
PF-02341066.  The investigator (in discussion with the Sponsor ) has discretion as to whether 
to discontinue or modify the dosages of the study drug, depending on the severity and timing 
of the ev ent(s).  A maximum of 2 dose reductions will be allowed per pa tient.
For patients enrolled in the RP2D cohorts, intrapatient dose reduction is permitted at any  
time.  Following IRB /ECapproval of Amendment #16, dose level -[ADDRESS_236080] anti- emetics such as prochlorperazine or 
ondansetron.  Taking the medication with food may  reduce nausea.  Prophylactic antiemetics
should be considered . 
5.1.2. Diarrhea
For CTCAE Grade 1 diarrhea, s ymptomatic care such as loperamide (Imodium) or no 
intervention at investigator judgment. 
ForCTCAE Grade 2 diarrhea, loperamide ([ADDRESS_236081] onset, then 2 mg every  2-4hours 
until sy mptom f ree for 12 hours).  No dose modification unless patient is intolerant or 
symptom is recurrent. 
ForCTCAE Grade 3 (despi[INVESTIGATOR_198292]), treatment should be withheld until 
recovery  to Grade 1.
5.1.3. Bradycardia
Concurrent use of PF- 02341066 with other br adycardic agents (eg, beta -blockers, 
non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as verapamil and diltiazem, clonidine, 
digoxin) should be avoided to the extent possible, due to the increased risk of sy mptomatic 
bradycardia. 
Heart rate and blood pre ssure should be monitored regularl y.  Dose modi fication is not 
required in cases of as ymptomatic brad ycardia.   For management of patients who develop 
symptomatic brad ycardia, see Table 2b.
PF-[ADDRESS_236082] evaluate thoroughly patients who demonstrate potential signs /symptoms 
of pneumonitis.  If a patient has a potential diagnosis of pneumonitis or drug related lung injury, the following evaluations/procedures should be considered to assist or exclude the diagnosis of pneumonitis during this period in the absence of disease progression, other pulmonary disease, infection or radiation effects:
•A sputum gram stain and culture (induced sputum if needed) bacterial, viral, fungal, 
protozoal, and mycobacterial pathogens;  
•Blood culture should be performed in febrile patients.  Consider appropriate 
serologies (mycoplasma, legionella, CMV, other viruses, etc.);
•Thoracentesis if pleural fluid is present (culture, microbiology, cytology);
•Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) if appropriate. The BAL fluid 
should be sent for culture, microbiology and cytology;
•A plasma sample for BNP (B-type Natriuretic peptide) to evaluate for evidence of 
CHF;
•For Asian patients, a blood sample for β-D-glucan to evaluate for the presence of 
fungal pneumonia (eg, Pneumocystis jirovecii ).
If clinically appropriate, high dose corticosteroid treatment should be initiated. Should the event be fatal an autopsy is highly recommended to confirm/exclude the 
diagnosis. 
For any case of drug-related pneumonitis, discontinue PF-[ADDRESS_236083] the Sponsor 
(seeTable 2b ).
5.1.5. Renal Cyst
The development of complex renal cysts has been reported in some patients with NSCLC 
treated with PF-02341066.  These cysts may be symptomatic or asymptomatic, and have 
usually developed within the first several months of starting PF-02341066.  The precise nature and significance of these cysts is unclear; however, while no evidence of malignancy has been found based on aspi[INVESTIGATOR_198293], complex renal cysts may be associated with renal malignancy, and thus consultation with a urologist or suitable alternate medical expert [INVESTIGATOR_198379].  Active surveillance with appropriate imaging (contrast-enhanced CT scanning or magnetic resonance imaging) should be CCI
PF-[ADDRESS_236084]/MRI s for an y prior occurrence of complex renal cy sts. 
Dipstick and urine microscopy should be performed on Day 1 of each cy cle.

Page 937.5.8. [18F]-FLT-PET and [18F]-FDG-PET Imaging (RP2D enriched population cohort 
only)
If possible, at least 6 evaluable patients with MET mutations/amplification will be enrolled 
into the imaging portion of the RP2D enriched population cohort.  These patients will undergo [
18F]-FLT-PET and [18F]-FDG-PET imaging. Also, if possible, the same patients 
that have pre- and post-dose biopsies will undergo PET imaging. The screening[
18F]-FLT-PET and [18F]-FDG-PET will be used to determine evaluable index lesions for 
each patient. Tumor background ratios (TBR) and development of new sites of abnormality will be recorded.  A patient will be considered evaluable if they have 2 or more baseline target lesions each identified by [CONTACT_17588] [
18F]-FLT-PET and [18F]-FDG-PET imaging.  All 
evaluable lesions must have a baseline [18F]-FLT-PET SUV of at least 2, and a baseline 
[18F]-FDG-PET SUV ≥3.5 (liver) or ≥5 (non-liver). Results of the PET sub-study will be 
scored according to the methods developed by [CONTACT_198356] (ACRIN; http://www.acrin.org/petcorelab.html).  These assessments will be performed as per the Schedule of Activities . With the approval of Amendment #13 by [CONTACT_134040]/EC, no additional patients will undergo PET imaging.CCI
PF-[ADDRESS_236150](s) will be reported asdescribed in the following 
sections. 
For all adverse events, the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to 
determine t he outcome of the adverse event and to assess whether it meets the cri teria for 
classification as a serious ad verse event (SAE) (see Section 8.6) requiring immediate 
notification to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative.  For all adverse events, su fficient 
information should be obtained by[CONTACT_198357].  The investigator is required to assess causality .  Follow -up by  [CONTACT_198358] a level acceptable to the 
invest igator, and [COMPANY_007] concurs with that assessment.
As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted b y the Sponsor, an y non -serious adverse event 
that is determined b y the Sponsor to be serious will be reported b y the Spons or as an SAE.  
To assist in the determin ation of case seriousness further information may  be requested from 
the investigator to provide clarit y and understanding of the event in the cont ext of the clinical 
study .
8.2.Reporting Period
For SAEs, the active repor tingperiod to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative begin from the 
time that the patient provides informed consent, which is obtained prior to the patient’s 
participation in the clini cal trial, ie, prior to undergoing an y trial -related procedure and/or 
receiving investigational product, throu gh and including [ADDRESS_236151]. Serious adverse events occurring to a patient
after the active reporting period has ended should be reported to the Spo nsorif the 
investigator becomes aware o f them; at a minimum, all serious adverse events that the 
investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to investi gational 
product are to be reported to the Sponsor.
Adverse events (se rious and non-serious) should be recorded on the Case Report Form ( CRF )
from the time the patient has taken at least one dose of investigational product through the 
patient’s last visit.
If a patient begins a new anticancer therap y, the adverse event repor tingperiod for 
non-serious adverse even ts ends at the time the new treatment is started.  Death must be 
reported if it occurs during the serious adverse event reporting period after the last dose of 
investigational product, irrespective of an y intervening treatment.
8.3.Definition of an Adverse Eve nt
An adverse event is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient 
administered a product or medical device; the event nee d not necessaril y have a causal

limited to:  
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant symptoms and signs;
Changes in ph ysical examination findings;
Hypersensit ivity;
Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .
Additionally , they  may  include the si gns or sy mptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;
Drug withdrawal;
Drug misuse;
Drug interactions;
Extravasation;
Exposure during pregnancy (EDP) ;
Exposure via breast feeding;
Medication error;
Occupational exposure;
Worsening of signs and symptoms of the m alignancy  under trial should be reported as
adverse events in the appropriate section of the CRF.  Disease progression assessed 
by [CONTACT_198359] r methods should not be 
reported as adverse events.
8.4.Medication Errors
Medication errors may  result, in this st udy,from the administration or consumption of the 
wrong product , by [CONTACT_4670] , at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength.  
Such medication errors occurring to a study  participant are to be captured on the medication 
error case report form (CRF) which is a specific version of the adverse event (AE) page, and 
on the SAE form when appropriate.  In the event of medication dosing error, the Sponsor
should be notified immediately .

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 96Medication errors are rep ortable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE/SAE, 
including:
Medication errors involving patient exposure to the investigational product ;
Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do 
or do not involve the participating patient .
Whether or no t the medication error is accompanied by  [CONTACT_1149], as determined by  [CONTACT_1275], the medication error iscaptured on the medication error versio n of the adverse 
event (AE) page and, if applicable, an y associated AE (s)are captured on an AE CRF page.
8.5.Abnormal Test Findings
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as 
an adverse event are as follows : 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms, and/or
Test r esult requires additional diagnostic tes tingor medical/surgical intervention, 
and/or
Test result leads to a change in trial dosing (outside of protocol- stipulated dose 
adjustments) or discontinuation from the trial, significant additional concomitant drug
treatment, or other therapy , and/or
Test result is considered to be an adverse event by  [CONTACT_76617] .
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the abov e conditions, does not 
constitute an adverse event.  Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an erro r does 
not require reporting as an adverse event.
8.6.Serious Adverse Events
A serious adverse event is any  untoward medical occurrence at any  dose th at:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_198297];
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduc t normal life functions) ;
Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect.
Progression of the malignancy  under stud y (including signs and s ymptoms of 
progression) should not be reported as serious adverse events unless the outcome is

Medical and scientific judgment isexercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical eve nt.An important medical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, if it is determined that the event may  jeopar dize 
the patient , ormay require intervention to prevent one of the other adverse even t outcomes, 
the important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
or deve lopm ent of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
8.6.1. Pr otocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events 
There are no protocol -specified SAEs in this study .  All SAEs will be reported by  [CONTACT_4688], and will be handled as SAEs in the sa fety
database (see the section on Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements). 
8.6.2. Potential Cases of Drug- Induce dLiver Injury
Abnormal values i n aspartate aminotrans ferase (AST )and/or alanine aminotrans ferase (ALT)
levels concurrent with abnormal eleva tions in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria 
outlined below in the absence of other causes of liver injury  are considered potential cases of 
drug-induced liver injury (potential Hy ’s Law cases) and should al waysbe considered 
important medical eve nts.
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential case of drug -induced liver injury  
depends on the patient’s individual baseline val ues and underl ying conditions.  Patients who 
present with the followin g laboratory  abnormalities should be eva luated further to 
definitively  determine the etiology  of the abnormal laboratory values:
Patients with AST or ALT and total bilirubin baseline val ues within the normal range
who subsequently  present with AST or AL T values3 times the upper limit of 
normal (xULN) concurrent with a total bilirubin value 2 x UL N with no evidence of 
hemoly sis and an alkaline phosphatase value [ADDRESS_236153] or not availabl e. 
For patients with pre -existing AST ORALT ORtotal bilirubin value s above the 
upper limit of normal, the f ollowing threshold values should be used in the definition 
mentioned above:
For patients with preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the nor mal 
range; AST or ALT values 2times the baseline values and 3x UL N, or
8x UL N (whichever is smaller).

The patient should return tothe investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results.  This evalua tion should 
include laboratory  tests, a detailed history  and phy sical assessment.  The possibility  of 
hepatic neo plasia (primary  or secondary ) should be considered.  In addition to repeating 
measurements of AST and AL Tand total bilirubin, laboratory  tests should also include 
albumin, creatine kinase, direct and indirect bili rubin, gamma -glutam yl transferase (GGT), 
prothrombin time (PT )/international normalized ratio ( INR),total bile acids, alkaline 
phosphatase and acetaminophen and/or protein adduct levels .  A detailed history , including 
relevant information, such as review ofethanol, acetaminophen, recreational drug and 
supplement consumption, family  history , occupational exposure, sexual history , travel 
history , history  of contact [CONTACT_4490] a jaundiced person , surgery , blood transfusion, history  of liver 
or allergic disease, a nd work exposure, should be collected.  Further testing for acute 
hepatitis A, B, or C infection and liver imaging ( eg,biliary  tract) may  be warranted.  All 
cases confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory  criteria defined above, with no 
other c ause for liver function test (L FT) abno rmalities identified at the time should be 
considered potential Hy ’s Law cases irrespective of availability  of all the resul ts of the

documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual patient;
Admission exclusively  for the administration of blood products.
Diagnostic and therapeutic non -invasive and invasive pr ocedures, such as surgery, should not 
be reported as adverse events.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was 
performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an adverse event.  For example, an 
acute appendicitis that begins during the adverse event reporting period should be reported as 
the adverse event, and the res ulting appendectomy  should be recorded a s treatment of the 
adverse event.
8.8.Severity Assessment
If required on the adverse event case report forms, the investigator w ill use the following 
definitions of severit y in accordance with National Cancer Institute Common Terminology  
Criteria for Adverse E vents (CTCAE) Version 3.[ADDRESS_236156] be consistent with the description of CTCAE grade inc luded in the narrative section of 
the se rious adverse event report.

0 No Change from Normal or Reference Range (This grade is not included in 
the Version 3.0 CTCAE document but may  be used in certain 
circumstances.)

Final Protocol Amendment 25, 11May 2021
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 1005 DEATH RELATED TO Adverse Event
Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an adverse event.  A severe 
event is not necessarily  a serious adverse event.  For example, a headache may  be severe 
(interferes significantl y with patient 's usual function) but would not be classified as serious 
unless it met one of the criteria for serious adverse events, l isted above.
8.9.Causality Assessment
The i nvestigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all adverse events (serious 
and non- serious) : the investigator must record the causal relationship in the CRF, as 
appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse r eporting 
requirements, if applicable.  An investigator’s causality  assessment is the determination of 
whether there exists a reasonable possibility  that the investigational product caused or 
contributed to an adverse event; generally  the facts (evidence) or a rguments to suggest a 
causal relationship should be provided .  If the investigator does not know whether or not 
investiga tional product caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to 
investigation al product” for reporting purposes as de fined by [CONTACT_1034] (see the s ection on 
Reporting Requirements ).  If the investigator's causality  assessment is “ unknown but not 
related to investigational product” , this should be clearl y documented on trial reco rds.
In addition, if the investigator determines a serious adverse event is associated with trial 
procedures, the investiga tor must record this causal relationship in the source documents and 
CRF, as appropriate, an d report such an assessment in accordanc e with the serious adverse 
event reporting requirements, if applicable.
8.10. Exposure During Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products , an exposure during 
pregnancy occurs if:
1.A female be come s, or is found to be, pregnant eithe r while receiving or having been 
exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational 
product ; or the female becomes, or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or 
being exposed tothe investigational product;
An exam pleof environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact [CONTACT_4490] 
a [COMPANY_007] product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurs e reports that she is pregnant and has 
been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
2.A male ha s been exposed (eg, because of treatment orenvironmental exposure) to the 
investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed 
during his partner’s pregnancy .
If any trial patient or trial patient ’s partner becomes or is fou nd to be pregnant during the trial 
patie nt’streatment with the investigational product, the investigator must submit this 
information to the [COMPANY_007] Drug Safet y Uni t on a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form 
andExposure During Pregnancy  (EDP) supplemen talform, regardless of whether an SAE 
has occurred .  In addition, the investigator must submit information regarding environmental

and has been exposed to a cy totoxicproduct by  [CONTACT_4691][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) using the EDP 
supplemental form.  This must be done irrespective of whether an adverse event has occurred 
and within 24 hour s of awareness of the exposure .  The information submitted should include 
the anticipated da te of delivery  (see below for informatio n related to termination of 
pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcom efor
all EDPreports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy  until
completion (or until pregnancy  term ination)and notify  [COMPANY_007] of the outcome as a follow up 
to the initial E DP supplemental form.  In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity  of the 
neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the event ofa termination, the reason(s) for 
termination should be specified and, if clinicall y possible, the structural integrit y of the 
terminated fetus should be assesse d by [CONTACT_4692] (unless pre -procedure test 
findings are conclusive for a congen italanomal y and the findings are report ed).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for a serious adverse event ( ie, ectopic 
pregnancy ,spontaneous abor tion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital 
anomaly  [in a live -born baby ,a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fet al demise, or a neonatal 
death]), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting serious adverse events.

“Spontaneous abortion” includes misc arriage and missed abortion.
Neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_236158] .
Additional inf ormation regarding the exposure during pregnancy  may  be requested by  [CONTACT_1275].  Furt herfollow -up of birth outcomes will be han dled on a case -by-case basis 
(eg,follow -up on preterm infants to identify  developmental delay s).  In the case of paterna l 
exposure, the investigator will provide the study  patient with the Pregnant Partner Releas e of
Information Form to deliver to his partner.  The Investigator must document in the source 
documents that the patient was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to 
provide to his partner.
8.11. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure o ccurs when during the performance of jo b duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact [CONTACT_8898], which may or may  not lead to the occurrence of an adverse event.
An occupational exposure is repo rtedto the drug safet y unit within 24 hours of the 
investigator’s awareness, using the SAE report form, regardless of whether there is an 
associated AE/SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a patient enrolled in the study ,

8.12. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See also the Section on Patient Withdrawal )
Withd rawal due to adverse event s should be di stinguished from withdrawal due to other 
causes , according to the definition of adverse event noted earlier, and recorded on the 
appropriate adverse event CRF page. 
When a patient withdraws because of an SAE , the se rious adverse event must be reported in 
accordance with the reporting requirements defined below.
8.13. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to report all directly  observed adverse events and all adverse events 
spontaneously  reported by  [CONTACT_198361].  In addition, each trial patientwill be questioned 
about adverse events.
8.14. Reporting Requirements
Each adverse event is to be assessed to determine if i t meets the criteria for serious adverse 
event.  If a serious adverse event occurs, expedited re porting will follow local and 
internati onal regulations, as appropriate.
8.14.1. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
If a serious adverse event occurs, [COMPANY_007] is to be notified within [ADDRESS_236159] be made immediately , irrespective of the extent of available adverse event information.  
This timeframe also applies to additional new information (follow -up) on previousl y
forwarded serious adverse event report s aswell as to the initial and follow -up reporting of 
exposure during pregn ancy , exposure via breast feeding and occupationa l exposure cases .
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occur rence of a serious 
adverse event immedia tely(eg, if an outpatient trial patient initially  seeks treatment 
elsewhere), the investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and 
document the time of his/her first awareness of the adve rseevent.
For all serious adverse events, t he investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information 
to [COMPANY_007] in accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above.  In addition, an 
investigator may  be requested by  [CONTACT_198362] c additional follow -up information in 
an ex pedited fashion.  This information collected for serious adverse events ismore detailed 
than that captured on the advers e event case report form.  In general, this will include a 
description of the adverse event in sufficient detail to allow for a comp letemedical 
assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality.  I nformation on 
other possible caus es of the event, such as concomitant medications , vaccines and/orillnesses 
must be provided .  In the case of a patient death, a sum maryof available autopsy  findings 
must be submitted as soon as possible to [COMPANY_007] or its designated representative.

All adverse events will be reported on the advers e event page(s) of the CRF.  It should b e 
noted that the form for collection of serious adverse event information is not the same as the 
adverse event CRF.  Where the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a 
consistent manner.  For example , the same adverse event term should be used on both forms.  
Adverse events should be reported using concise medical terminology on the CRFs as well as 
on the form for collection of serious adverse event information.

9.DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTI CAL METHODS
9.1.Sample Size Determination
Up to a pproximately 600 patients wi llbe enrolled in the study  including p atients in the dose 
escalation and RP2D cohorts seeFigure 1.  With S ponsor written approval and IRB/EC 
notification, 10 to 15 additional patients may be enrolled (for a tota l overall enrollment of 
approximately 580 patients) to reach the target enrollment of approximately 40to 50NSCLC 
patients with tumo r harboring MET Exon 14 alterations and approximately 20 to 25 male 
patients for hypogonadism evaluation in the event that over all enrollment is achieved prior 
to reaching these targets.
9.1.1. Dose Escalation Phase
The number of patients to be enrolled in the dose escalation phase of this study will depend 
upon the observed safety profile and study objectives, which will determine t he number of 
patients per dose level, th e number of dose escalations and the number of cohorts.
It is anticipated that a total of approximately 70 patients will be enrolled in the dose 
escalation phase of this study to determine both the QD MTD and the BID MTD. 
The operating characteristics for the dose escalation part of this study design are shown in
Table 3, which provides the probability of escalation to the next higher dose for each 
underlying true DLT rate.  For example, for a toxicity that occurs in 5% of patients, there is 
a greater than 95% probability of escalating.  Conversely, for a common toxici ty that occurs 
with a rate of 70%, the probability of escalating is <5%.

0-lastratio of MDZ in presence of PF-02341066 and MDZ alone.  Based on data from 
previous single dose MDZ studies conducted at [COMPANY_007], it is estimated that the within-patient
coefficient of variation (CV) for the AUC 0-∞data is 25%.  The standard deviation of the 
difference in log-transformed data is then estimated to be 0.348 [(sqrt 2) 
*(sqrt(ln(1+CV2)))].  If PF-02341066 increases MDZ AUC 0-∞by 2 fold (a 100% increase), 
then 8 patients will ensure that the width of the 90% confidence interval for the ratio will be no longer than 1.12, with 80% probability (see Table 5).  A probable 90% confidence interval is calculated to be: (1.52, 2.64).  The sample size is calculated using a paired t-test (nQuery, Version 4.0).

9.1.3. RP2D Enriched Population Cohort
It is anticipated that approximately 484 patients will be enrolled into the RP2D enriched 
population cohort.  Inclusion in this cohort is based on the inclusion criteria described in Section 4.1 and in Appendix 8 for ALK marker negative NSCLC patients, Appendix 9 for 
patients with MET-amplified NSCLC, Appendix 10 for ROS1 marker positive NSCLC 
patients and Appendix 11 for the Enriched Other cohort which includes patients with disease 
with molecular markers (other than ALK marker positive NSCLC, ROS1 marker positiveNSCLC and MET-amplified NSCLC) that may confer sensitivity to PF-02341066.  Two 
sub-studies will also be included in this cohort: (1) [
18F]-FLT-PET and (2) food effect.  First, 
approximately 6 patients will participate in a [18F]FLT-PET sub-study which should be 
sufficient to identify at least a 15% decline in standardized uptake value (SUV) compared to baseline.

[IP_ADDRESS]. ALK M arker Negative NSCLC Cohort s
[IP_ADDRESS].1. ALK Marker Neg ative NSCLC Cohort #1
The main objective of thisALK marker negative NSCLC cohort is to evaluate the objective 
response in this group of patients and to compare with the objective response observed from 
ALK marker positive NSCLC patients enrolled in Stu dy A8081007 and/ or Study A8081005 , 
as appropriate .  Depending on the recruitme nt for the ALK marker negative NSCLC cohort, 
patients with more than one previous treatment may be enrolled.  Response to PF -[ADDRESS_236163] ed to be low (to date no objective responses 
were observed in the unselected p opulation in this study).  Therefore, the subset of ALK 
marker negative patients in this cohort will be first limited to a total of 25 patients.
If 3 objective responses (CR or PR)are observed in the first 25 ALK marker negative 
patients, no additional A LK marker negative NSCLC patients will be enrolled into this trial. 
With 25 patients and exactly 3 objective responses, the 90% exact conf idence interval (CI) 
(3%, 28%) around t he observed response rate (12%) will not overlap with the 90% CI 
around the as sumed estimate of 40% for ALK marker positive patients (assuming that 
159 ALK marker positive patients are enrolled in the PF -02341066 arm of Study A8081007).  
Of note, the patie nt population in the current trial has been heavily pre -treated with a 
median number of 3 previous systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_198301] 
(ORR) for the ALK marker positive NSCLC group is ~60%.
If>3objective responses are observed among the 25 ALK marker negative patients, 
additional patients may be enrolled in this trial as noted in Table 6.

[IP_ADDRESS]. MET -Amplified NSCLC Cohort
In order to further evaluate the anti- tumor activity  of PF -02341066 associated with MET
amplif ication, patients with MET- amplified NSC LC will be enrolled into one of the 
following categories:
High Level MET Gene Amplified Category (MET/CEP7 ratio 5.0; Group 1): As per 
the PACL  dated 15 May  2017, the MET/CEP7 ratio cut -off for this group was revised 
to ≥4.0) . As per the PACL dated 11 September 2018, this group was closed to further 
enrollment. The remaining 14 enrollment slots were transferred to t he MET E xon 14 
alterations subgroup within the Enriched Other cohort.
Medium Level MET Gene Amplified Category (MET/CEP7 ratio >2.2 to <5; Group 
2):As per the PACL dated 15 May  2017, the MET/CEP7 ratio cut -off for this group 
was revised to >2.2 to 4.0 and this group wa s closed to further enrollment. The 
remaining 13 enrollment slots were transferred to the MET Exon 14 alterations 
subgroup within the Enriched Other cohort; 
Low Level MET Gene Amplified C ategory (MET/CEP7 ratio 1.8 to 2.2; Group 3) :  
As per the PACL dated 12 October 201 5, this group was closed to further enrollment.
For each c ategory , an ORR of 10% was considered to be uninteresting for further stud y for 
this c ategory with 30% considered interesting for further exploration.  Using a Simon optimal 
two-stage design w ith alpha=0.05 and 80% power, a test of the null hy pothesis that p 
10% ver susthe alternative p 30% requires [ADDRESS_236167] stage.  If 
1objective response (CR or PR) is observed in the first [ADDRESS_236168] 
stage, a decision will be made whether or not to expand to thesecond stage in an y of the 
3 categories investigated.  Within a c ategor y, if >5objectives responses are observed, the 
null hy pothesis will be rejected. 
As of a PACL issued June 27, 2014, 4 objective responses were observed in the High Level 
MET Gene Amplification category  and the cohort was expanded to an additional 19 patients, 
for a total of 29 -31 patients .  As of a PACL  issued October 28, 2014, 2 objective respons es 
were obse rved in the Medium L evel MET Gene Amplified category  and the cohort was 
expanded to an additional 19 patients, for a total of 29- 31 patients.

To increase the likelihood of achieving the target enrollment of approximately 20 to 
25evaluable male patients with hy pogonadism testing in a timely  manner, the Sponsor 
decided to close enrollment of patients into the MET low ampli fication NSCL C category  
(MET/CEP7 ratio  1.8 to  2.2) due to slow enrollment, effective as of the Protocol 
Administrative Clarification L etter dated 12 October 2015.  Thus, the remaining unused 
enrollment slots (estimated to be approximately  28: [ADDRESS_236169]-stage and 19 from 
Simon second- stage) wastransferred to the Enriched Other c ohort.  With Sponsor approval 
and I RB/EC notification, o ther conditions including, but not limited to, slow enrollment in 
the medium and/or high level MET amplificatio n categories, may  trigger transfer of 
additional enrollment slots from these MET gene amp lification categories to the Enriched 
Other cohort.  As per the PACL dated 15 May  2017, further enrollment of NSCL C patients 
into the MET intermediate amplificati on group was closed and the remaining 13 enrollment 
slots were transferred to the Enriched Oth er cohort to facilitate further enrollment of patients 
with MET E xon14-positive NSCL C. As per the PACL  dated 11 September 2018, further 
enrollment of NSCL C pati ents int o the MET high amplification group was closed and the 
remaining 14 enrollment slo ts we re transferred to the MET E xon 14 alterations subgroup
within the Enriched Other cohort.
[IP_ADDRESS]. ROS1 Marker Positive NSCLC Cohort
To further evaluate the anti- tumor activity of PF-02341066 in patients with NSCLC positive 
for a chromosomal translocation in the ROS 1 gene, approximately 30 patients will be 
enrolled.  An ORR of 10% was considered to be uninteresting for further study for this cohort

As of a database snapshot date of19 April 2012, 8 confirmed objective responses (CR, 
partial response [PR ])were observed in a total of 14 response eval uable patients enrolled in
the ROS1 marker -positive NSCLC cohort. Based on the number of confirmed objective 
responsesobserved (CR, PR), the null hypothesis was rejected. As recorded in the Note to 
File dated [ADDRESS_236172] estimation of antitumor activity in this patient population .

approximately  171 patients will be enrolled.
Further details for the Enriched Othe r cohort are provided in Appendix 11.
In the Enriched Other cohort, approximately 50 NSCLC patients with tumors harboring MET
Exon 14 alterations will be enrolled .  In addition, a separate group of approximate ly 
5 NSCLC patients with tumors harboring MET Exon 14 alterations will be enrolled in 
clinical sites in Japan. With Sponsor written approval and IRB/EC notification, additional 
patients may be enrolled as described earlier in this section ( Section 9.1) to reach thi s target 
enrollment in the event that overall enrollment is achieved prior to rea ching this target .  
In NSCL C patients with tumors harboring MET Exon 14 alterations, a n ORR of 10% will be
consi dered uninteresting for further study for this group, with 30% considered inter esting for 
further exploration.  With [ADDRESS_236174] 90% power to test the null 
hypothesis that the ORR is less than or equal t o 0.10 versus the alternative hy pothesis that it

responses are observed among the first [ADDRESS_236176] 2016, 11confirmed objective responses (CR, PR) were observed in a total of 28 
response -evaluable patients with MET Exon14-positive NSCL C.  Based on the number of 
confirmed objective responses observed, the null hy pothesis was rejected. T he proportion of 
respo nders will be estimated with better precision if the number of evaluable patients exceeds 
33 patients.
1.As of Amendment 23 (21 February  2017), the sample size in the Enriched Other 
cohort was further increased to a total of 130 patients, including approxim ately 
50 patients with MET Exon 14- positive NSCL C.  In addition, a separate group of 
approximately  5 patients with MET E xon14-positive NSCL C was planned to be 
enrolled i n clinical sites in Japan.   
2.As of the PACL  issued 15 May  2017 further enrollment of N SCLCpatients into the 
MET intermediate amplification group was closed and the remaining 13 enrollment 
slots were transferred to the Enriched Other cohort to facilitate f urther enrollment of 
patients with MET Exon14-positive NSCL C.  As a result, the total enrollment for 
patients with MET Exon 14-positive NSCLC was increased to 68 patients (50 original 
patients + 13 transferred slots + 5 Japanese patients) . 
3.As of the PACL issued 07 December 2017, sites were allowed to enroll additi onal 13 
patients with MET Exon 14- positive NSCL C into the Enriched Other cohort, which 
were originally  slotted for the broader Enriched Other cohort and were now assigned 
specificall y to patients with MET Exon14-positive NSCL C.  As a result, the total 
enrollment of the Enriched Other cohort subset of patients with MET 
Exon14-positive NSCLC increased to 81 patients (68 + 13 patients).  
4.As of the PACL  issued 11 September 2018, further enrollment of NSCL C patients 
into the MET high amplification group was c losed and the remaining 14 enrollment

9.1.6. Hypo gonadism 
The sample size for laboratory  testing will be determined by  [CONTACT_198364]- amplified NSCL C and the Enriched Other c ohorts.  
Accordingl y, assuming 50% of patients enrolled will be male, projected sample sizes are as 
follows:
It is anticipated that u p to 25 males (approximately 19 from the MET- amplified 
Cohort and approximately  6 from the Enriched Other C ohort) may  be av ailable for 
hypogonadism testing .  Testing will be performed at Cy cle [ADDRESS_236182] one dose of PF-02341066 .  The study  
population for efficacy  analy ses depend son the parameter; the anal ysis of so me endpoints
(eg,ORR, disease control rate [DCR ]) will be based on a response evaluab le population
while the anal ysis of other endpoints (eg, progression free survival [P FS] and overall survival 
[OS]) will be based on the safet y population.  
Due to the e xploratory  nature of this study , no confirmatory  inferential analy ses are planned,

PF-[ADDRESS_236199] to ensur e 
that the protocol and Good Clinical Pr actices (GCPs )are being followed.  The monitors may  
review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs areaccurate.  The 
investigator and institution will allow [COMPANY_007] monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate 
regulatory  authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.  This 
verification may  also occur after study  completion.
During stud y conduct and/or after stud y completion, t he trial site may  be subject to review by
[CONTACT_21980] (IRB) / ethic s committee (EC), and/or to quality  assurance 
audits performed b y [COMPANY_007], or companies working with or on behalf of [COMPANY_007], and/or to 
inspection by [CONTACT_47615].
The investigator(s) will n otify [COMPANY_007] or its agents immediately  of anyregulatory  inspection 
notification in relation to the study . Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with [COMPANY_007] 
or its agents to prepare the study  site for the inspection and will allow [COMPANY_007] or its age nt, 
whenever feasible, to be present durin g the inspection. The investigator site and investigator 
will promptly  resolve any discrepancies that are identified between the study  data and the 
patient's medical records.  The investigator will promptly  provid e copi[INVESTIGATOR_198302].  Before response submission to the regulatory  authorities, the 
investigator will provide [COMPANY_007] or its agents with an opportunity  to review and comment on 
responses to an y such findings.
It is impor tant that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process. 
11.DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]
11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Da taRecord
As used in this protocol, the ter m case report form (CRF) should be understood to refer to 
either a paper form or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection 
method used in this trial.
A CRF is required and should be complet ed for each included patient .  The compl eted
original CRFs are the sole propert y of [COMPANY_007] and should not be made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of [COMPANY_007] or appropriate regulatory  
authorities, without writt enpermission from [COMPANY_007].
The investigato r has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source 
documents) and ensuring that they  are accur ate, authentic/original, attributable, com plete, 
consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring and available when required.  The 
CRFs must be signed b y the investigator or b y an authorized staff member to attest that the 
data contained on the CRF s is true.  An y corrections to entries mad e inthe CRFs orsource 
documents must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the 
original entry .
PF-[ADDRESS_236200] cases, the source documents will be the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]'s or the ph ysician's chart . In cases 
where the source documents are thehospi[INVESTIGATOR_31019]'s chart, the information 
collected on the CRFs must match those charts. 
In some cases, the CRF , or part of the CRF, may also serve as the source document s.  In 
these cases, a documen t should be available at the investigator’ s site as well as at [COMPANY_007] and 
clearl y identify those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand 
as the source document.
11.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regul atory authorities or [COMPANY_007], the investigat or
agrees to keep records, including the identit y of all participating patients (sufficient 
information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed informed 
consent documents , copi[INVESTIGATOR_198303] l CRFs, safety  reporting forms, source doc uments, and 
detailed records of treatment disposition , and adequate documentation of relevant 
correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports) .  The records should be 
retained b y the investiga tor according to International Conference on Harmonisation ( ICH) 
guidelines, according to local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study  Agreement, 
whichever is longer.
If the investigator becomes unable for any  reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period (eg, reti rement, relocation), [COMPANY_007] should be prospectivel y notified.  The trial 
records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to [COMPANY_007] , such as another investigator, 
another institution, or to and independent thir d party  arranged by  [CONTACT_4618].  Investigator records 
must be kept for a minimum of [ADDRESS_236201] obtain [COMPANY_007]'s written permission b efore disposing of an y records, 
even if re tention requirements have been met.
12.ETHICS
12.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC)
It is the responsibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the trial protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other re levant documents, 
eg,recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the I RB/EC.  All correspondence with the 
IRB/EC should be retained in the investigator file.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1309] I RB/EC approvals should be 
forwarded to [COMPANY_007].
The only  circumstance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the patient s.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/EC and [COMPANY_007] in wr iting immediately  after 
the implementation .
PF-[ADDRESS_236202] of the Trial
The study  will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, legal and regulatory  
requirements, andthe general principles set forth in the I nternational Ethical Guidelines for 
Biomedic al Research Involving Human Subjects (Co uncil for International Organizations of 
Medical Sciences 2002), ICH Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, (ICH 1996), and the 
Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association 1996 and 2008).
12.3. Patient Information and Consent
All parties will ensure protec tion of patient personal data and will not include patient names 
or other identifiable data in any reports, publications, or other disclosures, except where 
required b y law.

of a numbering s ystem provided by  [CONTACT_47617] -identify  the study patient s. The 
study  site will maint ain a confidential list of patients who pa rticipated in the study linking 
each patient’s numerical code to his or her actual identity .
In case of data transfer, [COMPANY_007] will maintain high standards of confidentiality and protection 
of patients’ personal da taconsistent with applicable privacy  laws .
The informed consent documents and an y patient recruitment materials must be in 
compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory  requirements, and legal requirements, including 
applicable privacy  laws.
The informed cons ent documents used during the informed cons entprocess and an y patient 
recruitment materials must be reviewed and approved by  [CONTACT_4618] , approved by  [CONTACT_1201]/EC 
before use, and available for inspection. 
The investigator must ensure that each study  patient , or h is or her legall y acceptable 
representat iveis fully  informed about the nature and objectives of the study  and possible 
risks associated with participation. 
Whenever consent is obtained from a patient’ s legally  acceptable representative, the patient ’s 
assent (affirmative agreement) must subsequentl y be obtained when the patient has the 
capacity  to provide assent, as determined by  [CONTACT_1201]/EC.  If the investigator determines that 
a patient ’s decisional capacity  is so limited he/she cannot reasonabl y be con sulted, as 
permitted by  [CONTACT_1201]/EC and cons istent with local regulatory  and legal requirements, then 
the patient ’s assent may  be waived with source documentation of the reason assent was not 
obtained.  If the stud y patient does not provide his/her own cons ent, the source documents 
must record wh y thepatient did not provide consent (eg, decisionall y impaired adult), how 
the investigator determined that the person signing the consent was the patient ’s legally  
acceptable representative, the consent signer’s r elationship to the study  patient (eg, pare nt,
spouse) and that the patient’s assent was obtained, or waived.  If assent is obtained verball y it 
must be documented in the source documents.

PF-[ADDRESS_236206] version 1.0 Tumor Assessment Criteria17
At baseline, tumor lesi onswill be categorized as measurable or non -measurable (defined 
below).
All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the first day  of study  
treatment and never more than 4 weeks before star ting therap y.
Measurable Lesions
Lesions t hatcan be accurately  measured in at least 1 dimension (longest diameter to 
be recorded) as  2.0 cm with conventional techniques or 1.0 cm with spi[INVESTIGATOR_198307].
A tumor lesion that is situated in a previousl y irrad iated area is eligible for 
measurable dise aseprovided: 1) there has been documented disease progression in 
this site; 2) the criteria for measurability as outlined above are met; 3) this is not the 
only site of measurable disease.
All measurements should be determined using a ruler, calipers or di gital technology , 
and recorded on the CRF in metric notation.
Nonmeasurable Lesions
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <2.0 cm with conventional 
techniques or <1.[ADDRESS_236207]) and truly nonmeasurable lesions.  Truly  
nonmea surable lesions include bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or 
pericardial effusion, inflammatory  breast disease, ly mphangitis cutis or pulmonis, abdominal 
masses that are not confirmed and follo wed by [CONTACT_15218], and cy stic lesi ons.
Documentation of Target and Nontarget Lesions
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesion s and measured and 
recorded at baseline.  Target lesions (measurable) should be selected on the basis of their size 
(lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitability  for accurate repetitive measurements 
(either b y imaging techniques or clinicall y. A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all ta rget 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum L D.  The baseline sum L D will be 
used as reference b y which to characterize the objective tumor response.
All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as nontarget lesions andshould also 
be recorded at baseline.  Measurements are not required, and these lesions should be 
followed as present or absent.

Page 127Techniques for Assessing Measurable Disease
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at screening and during follow-up.  Imaging-based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_2085] (physical) examination when both methods have been used to assess the antitumor effect of a treatment.
Accepted methods of tumor assessment include:
Clinical examination: clinically detected lesions will only be considered measurable when 
they are superficial (eg, skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes).  For the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_3606] a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is recommended.
Chest x-ray: lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.
CT and MRI: CT and MRI are the best currently available and most reproducible methods 
of measuring target lesions selected for response assessment.  Conventional CT and MRI should be performed with contiguous cuts of [ADDRESS_236208] should be performed using a 5 mm contiguous reconstruction algorithm.
Ultrasound: should not be used to measure tumor lesions for objective response evaluation.  
It is however a possible alternative to clinical measurements of superficial palpable nodes, subcutaneous lesions and non-small cell lung nodules.  US might also be useful to confirm the complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by [CONTACT_12148].
Endoscopy and Laparoscopy: The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation has not yet been fully or widely validated.  Utilization of such techniques for objective tumor response should be restricted to validation purposes in specialized centers.  
 
Tumor markers: tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered a complete clinical response.
Cytology and histology: the cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion 
that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.
Response Criteria
The following RECIST criteria will be the primary method utilized in this study for the 
assessment and reporting of tumor response data.CCI

Page 128Complete Resp onse(CR): Disappearance of all target and nontarget lesions, normalization 
of tumor marker levels, and no appearance of new lesions indicates complete response.  Each 
of these must be documented on [ADDRESS_236209] 4 weeks.
Partial Respon se (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LDs of target lesions 
(taking as reference the baseline sum), without progression of nontarget lesions and no 
appearance of new lesions indicates partial response.   Each of these must be documented on 
[ADDRESS_236210] 4 weeks.
Stable Disease (SD): Neither CR, PR or PD criteria are met.  Patients who have stable 
disease (SD) as their only  response will be categorized as SD .
Progressive Disease (PD): 20% increase in the sum of the LD of targ et lesions taking as 
references the smallest sum L D recorded since the treatment started, unequivocal progression 
of existing nontarget lesions, or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions.  The occurrence of 
a pleura l effusion or ascites is also considered PDif substantiated by  [CONTACT_198367].  Pathologic fracture or collapse of bone is not necessaril y 
evidence of disease progression; however, new bone lesions not previously  documented are 
considered PD.
In cases wher e procedures used to assess tumor size suggest tumor necrosis or intratumor 
bleeding coincident with an increase in size, a PET scan or ultrasound should be considered 
because it is important to be sure that increa sing lesions are due to increased tumor gr owth
and not necrosis or bleeding.
Determination of Best Overall Response:
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence.  For PD, taking a s reference the smallest measurements 
recorded since treatment started.  For CR and PR the best response assignment will depend 
on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation (at the minimum of 28 day s) 
criteria.  Stable disease rate will be defin edas the percentage of patients with stabl e disease 
based on the total number of patients evaluable for response.
Determination of best overall response is su mmarized in Table 9with more details provided

PF-[ADDRESS_236212] version 1.1Tumor Assessment Criteria18
At baseline, individual tumor lesions will be categorized by  [CONTACT_198368], according to the criteria summ arized below:
Measurable Lesions
Lesions that can be accurately  measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of: 
[ADDRESS_236213] scan (C T scan slice 
thickness no greater than 5 mm) .
10 mm for lesions assessed clinically b y caliper measurement (lesions which cannot 
be accuratel y measured with calipers should be recorded as non -measurable).
[ADDRESS_236214] X -ray.
[ADDRESS_236215] scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). 
Non-measurable Lesions
Non-measurable lesions include small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm orpathological 
lymph nodes with a 10 but <15mm short axis) as well as truly  non-measurable lesions.  
Truly  non-measurable lesions include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial 
effusion, inflammatory  breast disease, lymphangitic involv ement of skin or lung, abdominal 
masses identi fied b y physical exam and not measurable b y reproducible imaging techniques.
Nodes that have a short axis <10 mm are considered non- pathological and should not be 
recorded or followed. 
Special Considerations R egarding Specific Lesions 
Bone lesions:
Bonescan, PET scan or plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques 
to measure bone lesions.  However, these techniques can be used to confirm the 
presence or disappearance of bone lesions.
Lytic bone le sions or mixed ly tic-blastic lesions, wi th identifiable soft tissue 
components, that can be evaluated b y cross sectional imaging techniques such as CT 
or MRI  can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets 
the definition of mea surability  described above.
Blastic bone l esions are non -measurable.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 131Cystic lesions:
Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographicall y defined simple cy sts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they  
are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cy sts.
‘Cystic l esions’ thought to represent cy stic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability  described above.  
However, if non- cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for 
selection as tar getlesions.
Lesions with prior local treatment :
Tumor lesions situated in a previousl y irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other 
loco- regional therap y, are usually  not considered measurable unless there ha s been 
demonstrated progression in the les ion.
Solitary  lesions:
If a measurable disease is restricted to a solitary  lesion, its neoplastic nature should be 
confirmed b y cytology /histology . 
Recording Tumor Measurements
All measurable lesions up to a maxim umof 2 lesions per organ and up to 5 in tota land 
representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and measured and 
recorded at baseline and at the stipulated intervals during treatment.  Target lesions should be 
selected on th e basis of their size (lesions with the longe st diameters) and their suitability  for 
accurate repetitive measurements (either b y imaging techniques or clinically). 
The longest diameter will be recorded for each target lesion.  The sum of the longest 
diame ter of all target lesions will be calculated a nd recorded as the baseline sum diameter to 
be used as reference to further characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable 
dimension of the disease during treatment. 
One exception to the above des cribed approach is related to pathological lymph nodes.  
Pathological l ymph nodes are defined as measurable lesions and may  be identified as target 
lesions if the criterion of a short axis of  [ADDRESS_236216] in which the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the 
axial plane; for MRI  the plane of acquisition may  be axial, sagittal or coronal).  The sm aller 
of these measures is the short axi s. 
A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all 
target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  The baseline 
sum diameters will be use d as reference to further characterize an y obj ective tumor 
regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.

PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 132All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and should 
also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements are not required and these lesions should be 
followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’.  In addition, it is 
possible to record multiple non -target lesions involving the same organ as a single item on 
the case record form ( eg‘multiple enlarged pelvic ly mph nodes’ or ‘ multiple liver 
metastases’).
Definition of Tumor Response 
Target Lesions
Response in target lesions is defined as follows:
Complete Response (CR): disappearance of all target lesions. 
Partial Response (PR): at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters oftarget 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
Progressive Disease (PD): atleast a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study  (this i ncludes the baseline sum 
if that is the sm allest on study ).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum 
must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  The appearance of one 
or more new lesions is also considered a sign of progression.
Stable Disease (SD): neither sufficien t shrinkage to qualify  for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify  for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study .
When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions and the nodes decr ease to 
‘normal’ size (<10 mm), they  may  still have a measurement reported on scans.  This 
measurement should be recorded even though the nodes are normal in order not to overstate 
progression should it be based on increase in size of the nodes.  As noted earlier, this means 
that patients with CR m aynot have a total sum of ‘zero’ on the CRF.
Non-Target Lesions
While some non -target lesions may  actually  be measurable, they  need not be measured and 
instead should be assessed only  qualitativel y at the time po ints specified in the protocol. 
Response in non-target lesions is defined as follows:
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization 
of tumor marker level. All ly mph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm 
short axis).
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one o r more non -target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.
PF-02341066
A808100 1
Final Protocol Amendment 25, 11May 2021
PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL
Page 133Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions.   
(Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).
Cytology, H istology 
These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in rare cases if required by  
[CONTACT_990] (for example, residual lesions in germ cell tumors).  When effusions are known to 
be a potential adverse effect of treatment ( eg,taxane compounds or angiogenesis inhibitors), 
the cy tological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any  effusion that appears or worsens 
during treatment can be considered if the measurable tumor has met criter iafor response or 
stable disease in order todifferentiate between response or stable disease and progressive 
disease.
For patients having effusions or ascites, only  cases having cy tological proof of malignancy  
should be recorded on the CRF.  Effusions th athave not been evaluated using cy tology  or 
were found to be non -malignant should not be recorded on the CRF. 
New Lesions 
The appearance of new malignant lesions indicates PD.  New lesion should be unequivocal 
(eg,not attributable to differences in ima ging technique, or change in imaging modali tyor 
findings not attributable to tumor).  If a new lesion is equivocal, for example due to its small 
size, continued therap y and follow -up assessment will clarify  the etiology  of the disease.  If 
repeat scans co nfirm there is definitely  a new lesion, th en progression should be declared 
using the date of the initial scan. 
The use of FDG -PET is sometimes reasonable to complement a CT scan assessment of a PD 
(particularl y for possible ‘new’ disease).  New lesions o n the basis of FDG -PET imaging can 
be ident ified according to the following algorithm: 
Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up 
No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG- PET at follow -up: if the positive 
FDG -PET at follow -up co rresponds to a new site of disease confirmed b y CT, this is 
PD.
If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow -up CT scans are needed to determine if there is trul y progression occurring 
at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date o f the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan).
If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT that 
is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.
Confirmati onof Tumor Response 
Confirmation of resp onseis required for non- randomized trials with primary  endpoint of 
response, but is not required in randomized studies since the control arm serves as 
appropriate means of interpretation of data.
PF-[ADDRESS_236217] version 1.1
When both target and non -target lesions are present, individual assessments will be recorded 
separately .  The overall assessment of response will involve all parameters as depi[INVESTIGATOR_198308] 10.

CR = complete response, PR = partial response, SD = stable disease,

Best overall response
The best overall res ponse is determined once all the data for the patient is known.  Best 
response in trials in which confirmation of complete or partial response is not required 
(ie,randomized trails) is defined as the best response across all time points (for example, a 
patient who has SD at first assessment, PR at second assessment, and PD on last assessment 
has a best overall response of PR).  When SD is believed to be the best response, it must 
also meet the protocol specified mini mum time from baseline.  If the minimum t imeis not 
met when SD is otherwise the best time point response, the patient’s best response depends 
on the subsequent assessments.  For example, a patient who has SD at first assessment, PD 
at second and does no t meet minimum duration for SD, will have a b est response of PD.  
The same patient lost to follow -up after the first SD assessment would be considered 
inevaluable. 
When confirmation of CR and PR is required ( ie, non -randomized trials with primary  
endpoint of response), the best overall response is de fined according to the tumor response 
along the stud y.  Complete or partial responses may be claimed onl y if the criteria for each 
are met at a following time point as specified in the protocol (generall y 4 wee kslater).  In 
this circumstance, the best overall response can be interpreted as in Table 11.

CR = complete response, PR = partial response, SD = stable disease, PD = progressive 
disease, and NE = inevaluable.
aIf a CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen at a subsequent time point, even disease 
meeting PR criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have 
reappeared after CR).  Best response would depend on whether minimum duration for SD was met.  
However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be claimed when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still 
present and in fact the patient had PR, not CR at the first time point.  Under these circumstances, the 
original CR should be changed to PR and the best response is PR.
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as ‘symptomatic deterioration’.  Every effort should be made to document objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an objective response: it is a reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_12003].  The objective response status of such patients is to be determined by [CONTACT_12157]-target lesions.
In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue.  
When the evaluation of CR depends upon this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/  before assigning a status of complete response.  FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG-PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_198369].  However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG-PET and biopsy resolution/ sensitivity.

Patients will be enroll ed into the rifampin interaction sub -study prior to the enrollment of 
patients in the itraconazole interaction sub- study.
Background:
The aim of this sub- study is to determine the effect of the co -administration of rifampin on the 
multiple -dose plasma pharmaco kinetics profile of PF- 02341066.  The starting dose of 
PF-02341066 will be 250 mg BID and approximately 25patients will be enrolled to obtain 
8evaluable patients.  See Section 9.1.4for furt herdetails.
In vitro studies demonstrated that CYP3A4/5 are the major enzymes involved in the 
metabolic clearance of PF -02341066. Co-administration of a single 250 mg PF-02341066 
dose with rifampin (600 mgQD), a strong CYP3A inducer, resulted in 81.8% and 
68.5% decreases in PF -02341066 AUC infand C max, respectively, compared to when 
PF-02341066 was given alone .13  As PF- 02341066 is also a CYP3A inhibitor, the magnitude
of the effects of CYP3A inducers on stead y state PF -02341066 exposures may differ from 
those seen after single doses. A mathematical modeling approach11based on preclinical and 
clinical data indicate that rif ampin co-administration is likely to result in an approximately 
36% decrease in the PF -02341066 AUC. Based on these findings no safety issues in using a 
250mg BID PF- 02341066 dose in combination with rifampin are anticipated.
Note: Clinical sites in Kore a will not participate in the rifampin int eraction sub- study.
Patient Population:  
This clinical trial can fulfill its objectives only if appropriate patients are enrolled.  The 
following eligibility criteria are designed to select patients for whom proto col treatment is 
considered appropriate.  Allrelevant medical and non -medical conditions should be taken 
into consideration when deciding whether this protocol is suitable for a particular patient. 
Inclusion Criteria:
Patient eligibility should be review edand documented by [CONTACT_198370]’s study team before patients are included in the study.
Patients must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for enrollment into the 
trial:
1.Histologically confirmed advance d malignancies (except for leukemias) refr actory to 
standard of care therapy, or for whom no standard of care therapy is available.

sub-study to obtain 8 evaluable patients.  See Section 9.1.4 for further detail s.
Concomitant Medication:
Patients using oral or other systemic horm onal contraceptives should be advised to 
additionally use nonhormonal methods of birth control during rifampin therapy.
Rifampin has been observed to increase the requirements for coumarin -like anticoagulant 
drugs.  It is therefore recommended that the pro thrombin time be performed as frequently a s
necessary to establish and maintain the required anticoagulant dose.
The concurrent use of halothane or isoniazid is not permitted during the rifampin dosing 
period as the potential for hepatotoxicity is increase d when these drugs are co- administered.

take these drugs from the first dose of itraconazole until the completion of full PK blood sample collection on 
Cycle 2Day 2. 
3Concomitant administration of itraconazole and oral midazolam is contraindi cated.  If midazolam is 
administered parente rally, special precaution and patient monitoring are required since the sedative effect 
may be prolonged.
All concomitant medications for patients enrolling in this sub -study must be approved by [CONTACT_429].
Hepatic Effects:
Itraconazole has been associated w ith rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity, including liver 
failure and death.  Some of these cases had neither pre -existing liver disease nor a serious 
underlying medical condition.  Some of these cases develo ped within the first week of 
treatment.  If c linical signs and symptoms of liver disease develop, itraconazole treatment 
should be discontinued and liver function testing be performed.
Neurotoxicity:
If neurotoxicity occurs that may be attributable to itra cona zole, itraconazole should be 
discontinue d.

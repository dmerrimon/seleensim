 1.0 Background and Rationale  
 
Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling illness that is associated with impairments in 
independent living as well as social and vocational functioning1. Schizophrenia also represents 
an important societal burden;  only 10% of individuals maintain employment, translating into 
annual lost wages of nearly $15 billion2,3. Cognitive dysfunction is a core facet of schizophrenia, 
contribut ing to profound social and vocational difficulties4-6. Cognitive control (CC) is an 
important mental process that is reliably impaired in schizophrenia7-9.  
 
CC facilitates flexible, goal- directed behavior through real time adjustments in perceptual 
selection, response biasing, and on- line maintenance of contextual information10,11. CC deficits 
in schizophrenia are associated with poor treatment compliance, social and occ upational 
dysfunction and decreased quality of life7-9. There are no effective treatments for CC 
impairment, due in large part to a gap in knowledge regarding the neural mechanisms of 
cognitive dysfunction  in schizophrenia.  In light of the significant functional disability and poor 
outcomes associated with impairment in CC there is a critical need for more effective 
therapeutic options for this important illness domain .  
 
Recently research has suggested that CC is subserved by a functionally related neural circuit, 
referred to as the cognitive control network (CCN), that includes  the left dorsolateral prefrontal 
cortex (LDLPFC), the left superior parietal cortex (LSPC), and the anterior cingulate cortex 
(ACC)10,12-14. The ACC is a key node within the CCN and is believed to act as a network hub 
that strongly affects processing and connection efficiency15. Though p revious work has 
demonstrated that disrupt ion within the CCN, particularly  decreased activity  in the ACC, is 
associated with deficits in CC functioning12,16-18, a clear understanding of the impact of ACC 
dysconnectivity remains elusive.  There is a critical need to identify investigational techniques 
that clarify the neural underpi[INVESTIGATOR_263142], such as ACC 
dysfunction, and contribute to the development of effective treatments  for this important 
cognitive deficit in schizophrenia.  
 
Repetitive  transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non- invasive neuromodulation 
technique that received FDA clearance for use in treatment resistant major depressive disorder 
in [ADDRESS_319933] provided 
evidence that high- frequency (HF) rTMS produces an increase in local cortical excitability20-24. 
Studies have also demonstrated that rTMS may increase functional connectivity  between 
separate but related cortical structures, utilizing high frequency stimulation25-28. Thus,  rTMS 
allows investigators to manipulate focal brain activity in a target region  and distal  function in 
associated circuitry25. The ability to affect activity downstream from  the point of stimulation is 
important, as this enables investigators to modulate structures not directly accessible to rTMS, 
such as the ACC.  
 
Work  by [CONTACT_263156] o thers have shown that rTMS is a viable option for investigating 
cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia26,28-30. We recently completed a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -study investigating 
the effects of HF  rTMS, compared to sham stimulation, on cognitive dysfunction in an  early 
phas e psychosis  (EPP)  population. This study administered bilateral, sequential, double- blinded 
sham stimulation or HF (20 Hz ) rTMS targeting the DLPFCs in twenty subjects with EPP. Ten 
Interactions of Fronto-Parietal High Frequency Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation on Anterior Cingulate 
Cortex Activation in Schizophrenia  
 
v.11.05.[ADDRESS_319934] examined the effects of rTMS targeting superficial CCN structures (LDLPFC 
and LSPC) on ACC activity or CCN connectivity in schizophrenia. It is a lso important to note 
that the vast majority of studies using rTMS in schizophrenia have examined chronic 
populations where confounds associated with prolonged duration of illness may be present. EPP is a desirable population to study because these individ uals tend to have fewer psychiatric 
and physical comorbidities and less antipsychotic drug exposure, all of which are factors that may confound investigations of new treatment interventions for this illness. In light of the 
significant unmet medical need associated with schizophrenia and the grave clinical effect of 
disrupted CC in the illness, rTMS modulating the ACC, and potentially CCN circuitry , represents 
an unexplored and novel potential treatment option.  
 
The goal
 of this project  is to utilize  HF (20 Hz) rTMS , in conjunction with  functional magnetic 
resonance imaging ( fMRI ), to provide evidence that rTMS  targeting superficial CCN structures 
(LDLPFC and LSPC) modulates : 1) activation  in the ACC during in- scanner CC task 
performance and 2) functional connectivity between the CCN structures during in- scanner CC 
task performance.  This study will provide vital preliminary data on target engagement informing 
future clinical trials seeking to investigate  rTMS as a novel treatment for CC impairment in 
schizophrenia.  This study will also seek to refine the understanding of the brain cir cuitry that 
mediates the potential pro- CC effects of rTMS through the use of fMRI at baseline and following 
the course of rTMS administration.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_319935] of HF (20 Hz)  rTMS 
targeting the LDLPFC and LSPC on ACC activation in individuals 
with schizophrenia during in- scanner CC task performance. W e 
predict  that HF rTMS targeting the LDLPFC and LSPC will result in 
increased functional activation in the ACC during performance of an 
in-scanner CC task. The second primary aim  of this study is to 
define the impact of HF rTMS targeting the LDLPFC and LSPC on CCN f unctional connectivity  (FC). We hypothesize that HF rTMS of the 
LDLPFC and LSPC will result in increased FC between the LDLPFC, 
LSPC, and ACC during performance of an in- scanner CC task. An 
exploratory aim  of this study is to determine the effects of HF rT MS 
targeting the LDLPFC and LSPC on CC performance. We will examine if HF rTMS targeting the LDLPFC and LSPC is  associated 
with improved performance during on in-scanner CC task . 
 
   
 
Primary Aim [ADDRESS_319936] 10 years, will be enrolled. 
Prior to randomization subjects will undergo fMRI during CC task (Stroop 
Color -Word paradigm) and resting- state 
paradigms. This baseline scan will also 
include a high- resolution structural sequence for neuronavigation purposes. Then , on two 
separate days, each occurring one -week apart, subjects will receive one  session of excitatory 
(20 Hz) rTMS targeting the LDLPFC and one session targeting the LSPC. The order of stimulation sites will be randomized and counter -balanced. Immediately following each session, 
subjects will undergo repeat fMRI during CC and RS paradigms. We will also examine the effect 
of rTMS on CC performance . 
 
rTMS  Set up and Administration 
rTMS will be delivered using the Magventure MagPro X100 Magnetic Stimulator (Magventure Inc., Alpharetta, Georgia). Motor threshold (MT) will be determined using single pulse 
stimulation over the left primary motor cortex, assessed as the lowest intensity producing five visible movements of the right abductor pollicis brevis out of ten stimulations.  
 High Frequency rTMS  
High frequency rTMS,  or rTMS greater than [ADDRESS_319937] utilized high frequency rTMS in 
schizophrenia populations, demonstrating that the treatment is safe, well -tolerated and capable 
of altering cognitive performance30,32. Our group has employed 20 Hz rTMS at 110% of motor 
threshold in a stimulation protocol in- line with the current proposal to improve cognitive function 
in an EPP cohort30. High Frequency rTMS Protocol : Subjects will receive two sessions of HF 
rTMS , targeting the LDLPFC and LSPC, within the following stimulation parameters: 20 Hz, at 
120% of MT, 60 trains (1.0 second per train), 20 pulses per train, inter -train interval of 20 
seconds, for a total of 1200 pulses over 21 minutes.  This stimulation protocol is within safety 
limits for rTMS21,33,34.  
 
Neuronavigation 
Brainsight  software (Rogue Research, Montreal Canada) will be used to reliably target the 
LDLPFC and LSPC for stimulation. First, the subject’s  individual anatomy will be registered 
stereotactically using the acquired structural MPRAGE brain image and fiduciary points on the 
scalp visible with a Polaris vicar camera (Brainsight software).  We will use the center s of mass 
of the LDPLFC and LSPC  (derived via Freesurfer parcellation; Destrieux Atlas35; left/right 
combined) to identify the specific coordinates for stimulation.  Stimulation sites will be marked on 
a swim cap worn by [CONTACT_263157], consistent with prior TMS studies
25.  
 Electrical field modeling  The processed structural image will be used to generate E -fields based on realistic conductor 
head models using SimNIBS (2.[ADDRESS_319938] version). SimNIBS includes volume conductor Fig 1. Study Outline

 modeling (following FreeSurfer segmentation), TMS coil specific magnetic dipole estimations, 
and finite element modeling of the electric field at each tetrahedral element of the subject’s head 
mesh. In anticipation of actual TMS sessions with each patient, we will find the optimal TMS 
positioning to most strongly influence the LDLP FC and LSPC , which will be the target for 
neuronavigated rTMS delivery.  
 rTMS  administration monitoring 
All subjects will be instructed to wear earplugs during each rTMS session and will be monitored by [CONTACT_263158].   
 Duration of Treatment  
Subjects will complete two stimulation sessions over two weeks , with one session occurring 
each week. Previous work has demonstrated that a single session of rTMS is sufficient to modulate target site functional activation as well as functional connectivity between the 
stimulation target and associated circuitry
25. 
 Sample Size

alpha level of 0.[ADDRESS_319940] significant results . 
 
Clinical Research Site  
The IU Psychotic Disorders Program (IUPDP),  which  is directed by  [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Alan Breier and is part of 
the IU Department of Psychiatry, is located in Indianapolis, Indiana.   IUPDP research personnel 
will manage the day -to-day activities of conducting the trial, including subject recruitment, 
consenting and screening subjects, conducting study visits, and performing assessments.   The 
IUPDP has [ADDRESS_319941] recruiter, one dedicated research technician, and two raters (1 Ph D, 1 Masters level) who have been trained and have extensive experience in conducting 
the assessments and cognitive tests used as outcome measures.

6.0 Clinical Assessments and Procedures  
 
The following assessments will be administered according to the Study Procedures Table 
(Attachment 1). All assessments will be completed by [CONTACT_263162].  
 Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
The C -SSRS captures the occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide- related thoughts and 
behaviors during the assessment period. The definition of behavioral suicidal events used in this 
scale is based on those used in the Columbia Suicide History Form41. During the baseline 
assessment, questions are in relation to lifetime experiences and all subsequent questioning is 
in relation to the last assessment.

v.11.05.20   8 
 The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)  
The PANSS is the primary assessment instrument for psychopathology. The PANSS contains 
30 items that assess symptoms of psychotic disorders including positive, negative and general 
psychopathology. The PANS S was chosen because of its widespread use in clinical studies of 
psychosis, and its demonstrated reliability in assessing psychopathology across diverse patient 
populations42. 
 
Diagnostic Interview  
The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -5 (SCID -5-RV) will be used to confirm the diagnosis 
of a psychotic disorder and/or rule out other diagnoses. The SCID -5-RV is a semi -structured 
interview designed to evaluate DSM -5 Axis I diagnoses37. 
 
Clinical Global Impressions Severity Scale (CGI -S)  
The CGI -S is used for repeated evaluations of global psychopathology43. The CGI -S scale is 
widely used in schizophrenia research and is a single 7- point Likert scale rating severity of 
psychopathology on a scale of 1 (normal, not ill) to 7 (very severely ill).  
 
Clinical Global Impressions Severity Improvement Scale (CGI -I)  
The CGI -I is used to assess the clinical change as compared to symptoms at baseline using a 
7-point Likert scale, ranging from very much improved (1) to very much worse (7)43. 
 
Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS)  
The AIMS is a 12- item scale designed to record the occurrence of dyskinetic movements44. 
Items 1 to 10 are rated on a 5- point scale, with 0 being no dyskinetic movements and 4 being 
severe dyskinetic move ments. Items 11 and 12 are yes/no questions regarding the dental 
condition of a subject.  
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Procedures  
Subjects  will practice tasks on a personal computer during Visit 1 and prior to the scan at 
subsequent visits.  Subjects will complete all pre -MRI procedures (e.g., completion of MRI 
screening form) before stimulation sessions to minimize the time in- between the stimulation 
session and MRI.  We intend to conduct post -stimulation scans within fifteen minutes of 
completing a stimulation session. Siebner et al. (2009) noted in a consensus paper on 
combining transcranial stimulation with neuroimaging that protocols apply ing prolonged trains of 
rTMS can induce changes in neuronal excitability that may last for more than one hour post -
TMS45. We believe that an interval of 15 minutes between rTMS session and f MRI will capture 
changes in excitability.  
 MRI will be performed at the IU Center for Neuroimaging using an integrated 45- minute exam, 
including structural and fMRI. Scans will be completed on a research -dedicated Siemens 
MAGNETOM Prisma 3T scanner.  Subjects will undergo a high- resolution 3D magnetization 
prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) scan fo r individual anatomical reference .  An MRI -
compatible response box will be utilized for tasks, recording reaction time and accuracy. fMRI will employ a computerized version of the Stroop Color -Word task.   A task -free resting state 
fMRI scan will also be acquired to measure functional connectivity between CCN structures.

words: “Red”, “Green”, or “ Yellow”, displayed in the 
corresponding color. Trials are either “congruent”  (word matches ink color), “incongruent ,” 
where the word and the color of the word differ in incongruent colors, or “nonwords,” which are 
“XXX” , “XXXX” , or “XXXXX”.  The Stroop Color -Word task requires participants to press one of 
three buttons to identify the ink color of a presented word (red, green, or yellow; randomly 
assigned). Subjects are instructed to indicate the color but ignore the word and to respond as quickly and accurately as possible via button press. There are multiple iterations of this task 
available, mitigating potential practice effects. Participants will practice examples of the CC task 
on a personal computer during Session [ADDRESS_319946], except emotional words (e.g., poor, sick, hurt) and 
neutral words ( e.g., note, run, spin) are used instead of congruent and incongruent words. 
Subjects are again instructed to indicate the ink color of the word via button- press. This task will 
be practiced prior to each scan as well.  
 
 Positioning and motion 
Subjects are instructed to remain still during scanning and deformable foam cushioning is used t
o stabilize the head. Real time image reconstruction and processing are used for quality 
assu rance at the  time of scanning. For fMRI, minor subvoxel -level translation or rotation is 
adjusted during post -processing. Noise : Noise -attenuating headphones and ear stopples 
provide excellent noise reduction and permit adequate auditory perception.  
 Func
tional Imaging Stimulation and Physiological Monitoring Procedures  
A comprehensive physiological monitoring system will be used with synchronized digital 
recording including pulse oximeter, respi[INVESTIGATOR_263143], HR and BP measures, which will be available for analysis in relation to BOLD fMRI time series. 
 
7.0 Safety Assessments  
 Vital Signs  
A seated blood pressure and pulse will be assessed at study visits per Study Procedures Table 
(Attachment 1).

See Attachment 2.  
 
10.0 Adverse Events  
 
Adverse events (AEs), especially those for which the relationship to study treatment is not 
“unrelated,” will be followed up until they have returned to baseline status or stabilized at the discretion of the PI. If after the follow -up period, return to baseline or stabilization cannot be 
established an explanation will be recorded in the source documentation.  
 
11.0 Criteria for Repeat Assessments, Rescreening, and Discontinuation  
 
Repeat Assessments  
Screening assess ments can be repeated within the screening window under the same 
screening number with the exception of eligibility criteria related rating scales/questionnaires. Subject diagnosis confirmation will not be repeated.  
 Rescreening 
Subjects who screen fail m ay be rescreened one time, under the same screening number. If a 
subject is rescreened, all screening assessments (with the exception of the diagnosis 
confirmation) must be repeated and the stability criteria timelines must be met.  
 Discontinuation  
Subjects will be discontinued under the following circumstances:  
1. Subjects unwilling or unable to complete study assessments or procedures  
2. Subjects who experience seizure occurrence at any point during study participation 
3. Subjects who require a change in dose of  antipsychotic medication or the addition of a 
new antipsychotic medication 
4. Subjects experiencing an exacerbation of illness requiring an increased level of care or 
one judged to be clinically significant by [CONTACT_978].  
 
If subjects discontinue from the study,  completion of discontinuation assessments will be at the 
discretion of the PI.  A subject may withdraw n from the study at any time at his/her own request, 
or may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_263144], behavioral, or 
administrative reasons.

v.11.05.[ADDRESS_319949] of HF rTMS on CC neurocircuitry or 
performance, there are no known calculations with EPP patients. However, previous  
investigations,  including our own, used  similar stimulation designs when investigating the effects 
of rTMS on overall cognitive performance. These studies  demonstrated statistically  significant 
results with sample size s consistent with the current proposal
32, and C ohen’s effect sizes of d = 
0.92 and 1.15, respectively30,32. Though these previous studies examined different cognitive 
constructs than the CC task in this current protocol, these studies do provide evidence that a similar stimulation design is sufficient to elicit a biologic response and assumedly appropriate for investigating the effects of rTMS on CC.  
 We believe that for the purpose of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we can demonstrate significant results with a 
sample size of 16 (eight per group). This accounts for the effect size estimate derived from the 
literature, d = 1.1, and the estimation of power to detect  an effect  at .75, utilizing a one- sided 
independent test and significance levels of 0.05.  
 Statistical Analyses  
 Preliminary analyses will consist of descriptive statistics for all outcome variables, including summary statistics, graphical displays of distributions, and spaghetti plots of individual data over 
time to detect possible data errors. Demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline will be 
examined using parametric or nonparametric test statistics as appropriate. Any d emographic 
variables that show significant differences will be added to the final models as covariates in order to ensure that the observed stimulation  effects are not spurious or due to demographic 
confounds.  
 To minimize the potential for Type II error, all treatment comparisons will be evaluated based on 
a one- sided significance level of 0.05. To compare overall effect of stimulation  over time for the 
two groups, a set of multivariate repeat measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be utilized, with stimulation  as the between- group factor and time as the within- subject factor.

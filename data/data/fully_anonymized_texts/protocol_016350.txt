Brief Summary of Research (250 -400 words):  
Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA) is an effective modality for the treatment of advanced 
osteoarthritis of the knee joint with excellen t outcomes. With 719,[ADDRESS_129631] operative pain an d improve functional 
outcomes in pa tients. Pain management in peri operative period enhances recovery 
and rehabil itation that improves length of stay and facilitates faster discharge with 
improvements in  patient satisfaction score s.  Numerous strategies  devised as a part 
of multimodal analgesia after TKA are epi[INVESTIGATOR_24686], femoral nerve block, 
adductor canal block, intra articular epi[INVESTIGATOR_13810] ( Caledonian protocol), intra 
articular cocktail, intra venous patient control analgesia along with IV ana lgesics 
and combinations.  The goal to minimize narcotics has been based on several studies 
demonstrating opi[INVESTIGATOR_116046] , increased leng th of stay as well as 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14051].  
 
Local infiltrative analgesia administered by [CONTACT_116053]. 
Periarticular analgesia ( PAI) primarily targets the mechanoreceptors and the free 
nerve endings in the intra articular area.

b) Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
   Inclusion criteri a: ASA (American Society of Anesthesiology) class I -IV, age 18-     
75. 
Exclusion criteria: ASA class V, morbid obesity, patient refusal, patients  with 
chronic pain or on pain medications , allergy to LA, patients receiving any additional 
regional technique s, coagulopathy , patients receiving  systemic anticoagulation, local 
infection, and procedures  anticipated  to last more than 5 hours.   
     c)Number of Subjects  
We intend to recruit 2 00 patients.  
Based on a confidence level of 99% with a Z score of 2.[ADDRESS_129637] deviation of .5 
and a confidence interval of 10% our sample size should be 166 . For ease of 
statistical calculations we rounded up to 2 00 patients. Based on previous literature 
pertaining to local articular infiltration in total knee arthroplasty an d postoperative 
femoral nerve block , we found s tudies included anywhere from 40 to 100 patients. 
We intend to use a higher sample size to see any statistical significance.

Sample size= [(2.58^2)(.5)(.5)]/(.1^2)=[ADDRESS_129638] set of pain scores obtained in the PACU.  A 
previous study of 45  patients undergoing knee arthroplasty treated with a femoral 
nerve block reported a mean visual analog scale score of 3.6 (SD 1.1) upon 
movement, at 24 h (Singelyn et al. 1998). In an earlier study on total knee 
arthroplasties (Axelsson et al. 2005), the mean morphine consumption over 48 hours 
postoperatively was 64.6 (SD 36.3) mg in the placebo group.  
 
The aim of this study  was to investigate whether the IPACK technique could r educe 
the morphine consumption.  The Mann -Whitney U test will be used for the analysis 
of the primary endpoint (morphine consumption). Mann -Whitney U test will be used 
to assess pain scores and the Bon ferroni-Holm method was used to correct for 
multiple measures. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], time to fulfill discharge criteria, knee function 
scores, and pati ent satisfaction scores will be  analyzed using the Mann -Whitney U 
test. Dichotomous data will be analyzed using the chi-squared test or Fisher's exact 
test, as appropriate. Values of p < 0.05 were considered to be statistically 
significant.  
 
 
d)Study Timelines  
     2017-[ADDRESS_129639]’s participation will be from 
time of enrollment in  the pre-operative period until first  24 hours after surgery . 
Estimated date of enrollment completion will be wh en 200 eligible subjects are

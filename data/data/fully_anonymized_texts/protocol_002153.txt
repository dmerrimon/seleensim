V I S I O N C A R E  R E S E A R C H  
PRO OTES -[ADDRESS_374165] lens  (CL) care product Oté Sensation  is a multi -purpose soft contact [CONTACT_305752],  disinfection, rinsing and 
storage of lenses.    
The product is CE -marked and has been marketed in Europe since January [ADDRESS_374166] 
contains constituents already used in FDA -approved multipurpose solutions.  The disinfecting 
agents are polyheximethylene biguanide (PHMB) and polyquaternium which are widely used in 
other multi -purpose solutions, including BioTr ue® (Bausch & Lomb) . 
There has been extensive pre -clinical testing to  demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy of 
the test solution, and scientific justification for conducting this clinical study ( see Investigator  
Brochure ). 
The purpose of this study is  to evaluate the clinical performance of the contact [CONTACT_305753]é Sensation in a representative population of soft contact [CONTACT_19554].  For comparison, the 
widely used soft lens multipurpose solution, BioTrue (Bausch & Lomb)  will be used as a co ntrol.  
This control product has been tested in previous clinical trial s.2-[ADDRESS_374167] whether the Oté Sensation multi -purpose solution is substantially equivalent to another 
multi -purpose solution (Bausch & Lomb BioTrue).  
2.1 Primary Hypotheses  
2.1.1  Efficacy Hy potheses  
The Oté Sensation  multi -purpose solution will be non -inferior to the Bausch & Lomb BioTrue  
solution in terms of:  
Comfort (0 -10), a non -inferior bound of 1.0 will be used.  
Visual acuity ( logMAR VA), a non -inferiority bound of 0.05 will be used  
Wettability (0 -4), a non -inferior bound of 0.5 will be used.  
Deposits ( in situ  0-4), a non -inferior bound of 0.5 will be used.  
2.1.2  Safety Hypotheses  
The Oté Sensation multi -purpose solution will be non -inferior to the Bausch & Lomb BioTrue 
solution in terms of : 
Corneal staining – type (mean grade, 0 -4), a non -inferior bound of 0.5 will be used.  
Limbal hyperemia  (grade, 0 -4), a non -inferior bound of 0.5 will be used.  
Bulbar hyperemia  (grade, 0 -4), a non -inferior bound of 0.5 will be used.

PRO OTES -3301 v3.0 FINAL 10JUL17  9 of 40   3 STUDY DESIGN & RATIONAL E 
This will be a 1-month, 200-subject, double -masked  (care product) , bilateral, randomized , 
comparative study.  Subjects will be clinically evaluated at the initial baseline visit (Visit 1), then 
after [ADDRESS_374168] or control solution.  
The risks and benefits to the subjects taking part in this study are detailed in the Informed 
Consent Form . 
3.1 Masking  
To prevent bias, several steps will be taken to keep the investigators and subjects masked to 
the identity of the assigned solution:  
 Subjects will be identified by [CONTACT_211494], which are unrelated to study solution 
assignments.  
 Solution bottles will be over -labelled (‘A’, ‘B’ or ‘C’ ) and packaged in kit-boxes so that the 
identity of the study solution is not revealed.  Therefore, investigators must only dispense 
solutions for the study that have been provided by [CONTACT_305754]  (CRO ). 
 If for any re ason the investigator needs to be unmasked to the solution type that the study 
subject is using, they should follow the decoding procedures which will be present in the 
investigator study binder.  
If required, for purposes of a subject’s safe clinical manag ement, the investigators will be able 
to learn the identity of the solution being used by [CONTACT_305755] (CRA ). 
3.[ADDRESS_374169]  and one code for the control  so there are equal numbers of bottles of 
each code  (‘A’, ‘B’ or ‘C’ ). Subjects will also be randomly assigned to a lens type.  
A random number generator (Microsoft Excel) will be used to determine t he randomization  of 
solutions  and lens types .  Each eligible subject will randomly be assigned to one of the lens 
care products and lens types using a block ing method and stratified by [CONTACT_3725]. All sites will use 
both the test and control solutions.  Each site wi ll only use four of the six study lens types.   
The randomization w ill be  performed in stages.  Firstly, the sites w ill be randomly assigned to 
four of the six study lens types .  Secondly, subjects w ill be randomly allocated, by [CONTACT_3725], to one 
of the four lens types in blocks of four subjects.  Thirdly, subjects within each site and lens type 
will be randomly allocated to one of the three solution codes ([ADDRESS_374170], 1 x Control) in blocks of 
three subjects.    
Subject ID numbers will be assigned consecutively to maintain randomization .

Subjects will be randomly allocated to use one of six lens types ( Table 2). Approximately 33 
subjects will be allocated to use each lens type: approximately [ADDRESS_374182].  
Each investigational site will use four of the six lens types (e.g. T ypes 1,2,3 ,4 or Types 1,2,5,6 
or Types 3,4,5,6). Each site will utilise  a stock of lenses so that, where possible, subjects may 
be dispensed lenses at the first visit.  However, if the appropriate lenses are not immediatel y 
available , a second visit (Visit 1b) will be scheduled.  
One of the lenses (Acuvue 2) is recommended for 2 -weekly replacement.  For these subjects, 
spare lenses will be issued during the Baseline visit  with instructions for replacement.  
In the event of lens loss or damage, replacement lens(es) will be issued at an unscheduled 
visit.

All subjects enrolled should be accounted for , even if they are not dispensed lenses or study 
product.   A sig ned Statement of Informed Consent constitutes enrolment.  After enrolment, a 
subject is considered active and should be accounted for at every visit until the completion of 
or discontinuation from the study.  
Each site will be expected to enroll  approximate ly 20 subjects , up to a maximum of 24 subjects.   
7.2 Study Visits  
7.2.1  Visit Schedule  
There will be a maximum of four scheduled visits as follows:  
Visit 1 a: Baseline  
Visit 1b: Lens issue  (may be combined with Visit 1a)  
Visit 2: 1 week follow -up (7 days ± 3 days) – WT 1-3 hours  
Visit 3:  1 month follow -up (30 days ±4 days)  
A visit schedule form will be supplied to all sites which will list the visit windows and this can 
assist in arranging visits within the acceptable visit window.  
The investigator should confirm  with the subject that they are able to attend the follow -up visits 
within the visit window before enrolling them in the study.  If, in extreme situations (sickness, 
unforeseen circumstances), the subject can only attend outside the visit window, the 
inves tigator should discuss with the CRA whether this visit can be considered a scheduled visit.

PRO OTES -3301 v3.0 FINAL 10JUL17  25 of 40   8.2 Adverse Eve nt Reporting  
On finding an adverse event the investigator will complete an Adverse Event Form (AE eCRF ) 
to document the condition.  
The Investigator must notify Visioncare Research of any type of AE, so that they are able to 
provide advice and support to the Investigator on how to proceed.  
The Investigator must do this by [CONTACT_305777], email, fax or telephone as soon as possible and no later than:  
o 24 hours from d iscovery if event is Serious  
o 2 working days from discovery if event is Significant or Non-Significant  
Visioncare Research will advise the investigator to notify the REC/IRB  no later than : 
 Sterling IRB (US) reporting requirements, within 10 working days from the date of 
discovery.  
 NRES  REC  ([LOCATION_006]) reporting requirements,  15 working days from  the date discovery.  
Visioncare Research may notify the REC /IRB on behalf of the investigator.  
To report to the REC /IRB send a covering letter with details as per the REC /IRB requirements. 
This usually includes the subject identifier and a brief description of how the AE was discovered, 
the subject’s condition and any follow -up anticipated. The AE Form is also sent to the REC /IRB. 
These documents can be sent by [CONTACT_305778] C/IRB facilities.  
The investigator must also notify Visioncare Research in writing that the AE has been reported 
to the REC /IRB. 
8.3 Device -Related Adverse Event Documentation  
Investigators are required to document and follow -up all AEs.  
All AEs are documented on an AE eCRF  upon event discovery.  One AE eCRF  is used per 
eye.   
Procedure:  
The investigator has the responsibility to:  
1. Complete as much information as possible on the AE eCRF  upon event discovery.  This 
includes:  
 A detailed descr iption of the AE and a diagnosis, including a probable cause   
 Detailed drawings that detail size, location and depth or photographs (if necessary)  
 Likelihood of the AE being device -related and whether lens or care product -related.  
2. If serious, collect any contact [CONTACT_305779], solutions, and the lens case used at the time.  
3. Report the AE to the sponsor (via CRO, i.e. Visioncare Research) and the REC/IRB  within 
the specified timelines (see Adverse Events section 8.2). 
4. Follow study subject until resolution recording all information on an unscheduled visit eCRF, 
including VA, symptoms and slit lamp findings, resolution and permanent sequelae if any.   
V I S I O N C A R E  R E S E A R C H  
PRO OTES -3301 v3.0 FINAL 10JUL17  26 of 40   5. Complete all remaining information as required by [CONTACT_305780] .  If follow -up of the AE is 
required, the follow -up section can only be completed when all follow -up visits are done.  
Additional information that will be completed on the AE eCRF  include:  
 Outco me, ocular sequelae if any  
 Whether the patient is discontinued from the study as a result of the AE  
8.[ADDRESS_374202] follow -up examinations until the condition has either:  
 Returned to pre -event status,  
 Stabilized , or   
 Been satisfactorily explained.  
If the subject is referred for medical attention, they will be tracked by [CONTACT_305781].  
Follow -up data will be collected on Follow -up Visit eCRFs (marked as unscheduled visit) and 
on the AE eCRF . 
If Corneal Staining  is present of G rade 3 or more, a nother  follow up v isit should be scheduled 
within  24 hours.  
The investigator should use his/her clinical judgement as to whether or not the subject r eporting 
with an adverse event should continue in the study.  
8.4.[ADDRESS_374203] to the device being studied a s per regulatory bodies’ 
requirements.  
To comply with this, the sponsor is responsible for promptly advising (in writing, via Visioncare 
Research) all investigators conducting clinical studies using an investigational device, of any 
incidents of serious or  unexpected adverse events/unanticipated adverse device effects 
reported for the devices/products involved in those studies.  
9 DATA MANAGEMENT  
9.1 Electronic Case Report Forms/Data Collection  
The data for this study will be collected on electronic report forms ( eCRFs) using an electronic 
data collection (EDC) system.  Designated study site personnel will enter study data into the 
electronic CRFs (eCRFs) using the Medrio EDC system.  Medrio is compliant with all relevant 
aspects of ICH/Good Clinical Practices and 21 CFR Part 11 (Electronic Records & Electronic 
Signatures) regulations.  
V I S I O N C A R E  R E S E A R C H  
PRO OTES -3301 v3.0 FINAL 10JUL17  27 of 40   9.2 Data Quality Assurance  
When eCRFs are reviewed at Visioncare Research, they will be subjected to error checking 
and data queries will be raised electronically via the EDC system for r esolution of omissions 
and discrepancies by [CONTACT_093].   
Before the final closing of the database, the data will be checked and approved for analysis as 
per Visioncare Research SOPs.  This includes checking for missing or erroneous data entries  
9.3 Data Entry and Storage  
All study data shall be entered into the study eCRFs.  The statistical analyses will be completed 
by [CONTACT_305782] (SAS Institute Inc., Version 9.4).  
10 SAMPLE SIZE AND STATISTICAL METHODS  
10.1 Sample Size Rationale  
The sample size  was selected to be in agreement with ISO [ZIP_CODE]:20 12.  The sample size 
assumes a drop -out rate of < 10% and was rounded up to allow for equal subject numbers and 
even enrolment at each site . 
10.2 Statistical Analysis Plan  
General considerations:   All data summaries and statistical analyses will be performed using 
the SAS software Version 9. 4 or higher (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).  Throughout the analysis of 
data, the results for each subject/eye will be used when available for summarization and 
statistical analysis.  Missing data will be excluded from the analysis.  Unscheduled visits will be 
excluded from the statistical analysis.  
Descriptive statistics will be reported by [CONTACT_305783], dispensing, and each follow -
up visit according to  ISO [ZIP_CODE]:20 12.  Conti nuous variables will be summarized  using sample 
size (N), mean, standard deviation (SD), minimum and maximum, and categorical  data

DISTANCE VISUAL ACUITY  
Measure Visual Acuity (VA) to the nearest letter.   
If the subject reads more than half of the letters on a given line, ask them to attempt the next line.  
Then if the subject is able to read letters on the next line assume that the previous line was correctly 
read for the purposes of recording VA.  
EXAMPLE 1 : If all six of the letters on the 6/[ADDRESS_374215] then 
correctly identified all but one of the six letters on the 6/7.[ADDRESS_374216] the acuity as:  
6 / 7.5 - 1 
EXAMPLE 2 : If the subject correctly identified four of the six letters on the 6/6 line and two of 
the six letters on the 6/[ADDRESS_374217] the acuity as:  
6 / 6 + 2  
If necessary, VA can also be recorded on the eCRF in logMAR

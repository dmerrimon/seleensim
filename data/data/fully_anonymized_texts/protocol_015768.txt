After confirming eligibility remotely, we will randomly assign participants to one of three on-line treatments: a) Meditation with psychoeducation; b) Kundalini Yoga with psychoeducation; and c) Psychoeducation alone. All 3 groups therefore will receive psychoeducational material about mental health care, but two of the 3 groups will also receive a mind-body therapy (mindfulness meditation or Kundalini Yoga).

Kundalini Yoga consists of breathing, meditation, and stretching techniques. The guided meditation includes breathing and mindfulness training delivered online. We plan to assess the extent to which these two mind-body practices can augment the psychoeducation in reducing anxiety. The primary outcomes will be improvement in self-reported anxiety and in self-reported multisystem symptom severity. Secondary outcomes will assess cognitive complaints, depression, sleep, and fatigue.This will be an on-line study. During this study, patients will be screened through an on-line process, review consent, and complete self-report questionnaires. 450 patients will be enrolled. Of these, 150 will be randomly assigned to kundalini yoga with psychoeducation, 150 will be assigned to mindfulness meditation with psychoeducation, and 150 will be assigned to psychoeducation alone. Assessments will be conducted weekly to 8 weeks; there will also be a 3- and 6-month follow-up by [CONTACT_63496].

Background, Significance and RationaleIn January 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a public health emergency of international concern by [CONTACT_38375]. Since then, the number of cases has risen exponentially in the [LOCATION_002] and world-wide, and the rapid spread of the virus has now been designated a global pandemic. The individual and societal costs of the pandemic are already wide-ranging, leading to substantial psychological burden even for those who have not been infected. A recent synthesis of psychological reactions to past infectious disease outbreaks indicated that anxiety and depression were among some of the most common symptoms experienced (Chew et al, 2020) . Other symptoms included somatic complaints, anger, irritability, grief, and post-traumatic stress. In the current context, anxiety is likely to be one of the most prevalent symptoms due to increasing uncertainty concerning health outcomes, contamination fears, and financial and occupational instability, as well as worry about the broader social and economic consequences. Approximately 25 to 33% of the population are likely to experience high levels of anxiety and worry, based on research from similar global pandemics (Bults et al, 2015; Lau et al 2008). Individuals with pre-existing medical and mental health issues may be at greater risk. The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether heightened anxiety in the context of COVID-[ADDRESS_903878] profound consequences to self and others, excessive anxiety can lead to impaired mood, thoughts, and behaviors. After confirming eligibility remotely, we will randomly assign participants to one of three on-line treatments: a) Meditation with psychoeducation; b) Kundalini Yoga with psychoeducation; and c) Psychoeducation alone. All 3 groups therefore will receive psychoeducational material about mental health care, but two of the 3 groups will also receive a mind-body therapy (mindfulness meditation or Kundalini Yoga). This study will recruit participants from throughout the [LOCATION_002]. Our research team is uniquely qualified to conduct this study given its expertise in anxiety disorders (esp illness anxiety and OCD) and in infectious disease. Each person’s study treatment is [ADDRESS_903879]. Newby’s on-line cognitive behavioral program (“ThisWayUp”) for anxiety production includes psychoeducational handouts. We extracted material on stress and anxiety reduction and on healthy habits from these psychoeducational handouts. Kundalini Yoga consists of breathing, meditation, and stretching techniques. Recent studies suggest that Kundalini Yoga can be helpful in reducing anxiety. One study of patients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) found that an 8 week study of KY compared to “treatment as usual with cognitive techniques” led to reduced anxiety and fewer somatic symptoms (Gabriel et al 2018). Another non-randomized single arm study among patients with GAD reported that CBT when combined with Kundalini Yoga led to significant improvements in state and trait anxiety, depression, panic, sleep, and quality of life

(Khalsa et al, 2015). A most recent randomized clinical trial reported that KY performed better than the relaxation response therapy among patients with OCD (Shannahoff-Khalsa 2019). The KY practice to be used in this study was promulgated and disseminated by [CONTACT_669150], Gurucharan Singh Khalsa (Phd). [CONTACT_459512] has been the leading international director of training for Kundalini Yoga for [ADDRESS_903880]. Charles Alexander (MD) studied with [CONTACT_459512]; [CONTACT_288759] is a certified instructor in this method has had over [ADDRESS_903881] sizes in reducing anxiety and depression (Blank et al, 2018). The guided meditation in this program includes breathing and mindfulness training delivered through a meditation online provider (called Journey). A recent publication using this specific meditation provider compared to a podcast control group (Basso et al 2019) demonstrated that 8 weeks of meditation therapy led to significantly greater improvement in mood, anxiety, and cognition (attention, working memory, and recognition memory). We plan to assess the extent to which these two mind-body practices can augment the psychoeducation in reducing anxiety. The primary outcomes will be improvement in self-reported anxiety and in self-reported multi-system symptom severity . Secondary outcomes will assess cognition, depression, sleep, and fatigue.This will be an on-line study. During this study, patients will be screened through an on-line process, review consent, and complete self-report questionnaires. 450 patients will be enrolled. Of these, 150 will be randomly assigned to kundalini yoga with psychoeducation, 150 will be assigned to mindfulness meditation with psychoeducation, and 150 will be assigned to psychoeducation alone. Assessments will be conducted weekly to 8 weeks; there will also be a 3- and 6-month post-treatment follow-up by [CONTACT_63496]. All participants at the end of the 8 weeks will be offered the option of receiving an additional 8 weeks of access to free online meditation recordings through Journey meditation which provides guided meditation. Should this study find evidence suggesting that either meditation therapy with psychoeducation and/or Kundlini Yoga with psychoeducation delivered remotely contribute additional benefit in augmenting anxiety reduction, this would be a valuable and welcome research finding that would have broad public health implications as it provides patients in the time of a public health crisis with a beneficial new approach to addressing anxiety.Specific Aims and HypothesesSpecific Aims and HypothesesHypothesis:Our expectation is that many patients will benefit in this study, regardless of the treatment received, as everyone will be receiving psychoeducation. Our primary hypothesis: Among participants with heightened anxiety in the context of an infection pandemic (COVID-19), augmentation of psychoeducation with Kundalini Yoga or Meditation will lead to a greater reduction in anxiety and in severity of multi-system

symptoms than treatment with psychoeducation alone. SPECIFIC AIMS Aim 1: Test whether Kundalini Yoga with psychoeducation results in a significantly greater reduction in anxiety and multi-system symptom severity and in improvement in secondary outcomes (e.g., depression, sleep, illness anxiety, fatigue, cognition) compared to psychoeducation alone Aim 2: Test whether a mindfulness meditation practice with psychoeducation leads to a significantly greater reduction in anxiety and multi-system symptom severity and in improvement in secondary outcomes (e.g., as above) compared to psychoeducation alone Aim 3: To assess whether treatment outcomes are moderated by [CONTACT_4113]-19 related variables (e.g., health/COVID exposure status, impact on job/school/financial stability) and personal variables (e.g, prior health status, substance use, intolerance of uncertainty, social support network, spi[INVESTIGATOR_25824]/religiosity) Aim 4: To assess at the follow-up at month [ADDRESS_903882] been sustained.  Aim 5: To assess whether there is a difference in both primary and secondary outcomes between the Kundalini Yoga and the meditation treatment groups.

b) Two of three patients also receive assignment to meditation or Kundalini Yoga.c) All participants who complete the initial 8 weeks of the study (treatment phase) will receive a free 8-week subscription to online meditation recordings via Journey meditation. Description of Treatmentsa. Psychoeducation. With the generous intellectual support of [CONTACT_669164] [CONTACT_669155] (Australia), we have adapted a set of four psychoeducation 3-4 page handouts to be given to all study participants that are designed to reduce anxiety (see appendix). Every 2 weeks, a new handout will be sent out (baseline and weeks 2, 4, 6). The topi[INVESTIGATOR_84946]: a) Education about health anxiety and the body’s fight/flight response; b) Education about the negative effects of attention and checking behaviors (with a specific focus on internet checking); c) Healthy thoughts and unhelpful thinking patterns; and d) Healthy habits (includes info on sleep and exercise). All participants (in each of the groups) will receive introductory material that explains the purpose of the psychoeducation tools and how they should be used. This material will also remind the participant of the procedures for the duration of the study (e.g., self-report questionnaire completion at baseline, 2, 4, 6, and [ADDRESS_903887]-treatment follow-ups). b. Meditation (via Journey). This meditation aims to train the mind for a healthier lifestyle through a 15 minute daily guided audio meditation delivered online. The group randomized to meditation will receive introductory material that explains the purpose and use of the psychoeducation tools and introduces the meditation daily practice with guided breathing. This material will also remind the participant of the procedures over the course of the study (e.g., daily log completion, self-report questionnaire completion at baseline, 2, 4, 6, and [ADDRESS_903888]-treatment follow-ups). They will then be directed to a link to the meditation video. Participants will be provided with the meditation program after completing the introductory/baseline questionnaires. Each day, they will participate in 15 minutes of meditation. c. Kundalini Yoga. Kundalini Yoga incorporates a daily practice of movement (stretching and hand movements), guided breathing, and meditation. The group randomized to Kundalini Yoga will receive introductory material that explains the purpose and use of the psychoeducation tools and introduces the daily practice of Kundalini yoga. This material will also remind the participants of the procedures over the course of the study (e.g., daily log completion, self-report questionnaire completion at baseline, 2, 4, 6, and [ADDRESS_903889]-treatment follow-ups). After the initial introduction, participants will watch a [ADDRESS_903890] the Breathing and Meditation each day. Stretching (brief description): Guided in the video, this includes about 9 minutes of gentle stretching movements of the arms and body. This can be done standing or in a chair if more comfortable. Kundalini Yoga (The initial Kundalini session is as follows)This lasts about [ADDRESS_903891].They will complete the 25 minutes of stretching/meditation each day. Each week they will watch a new informational talk on Kundalini yoga. Participants will be asked to maintain a meditation log throughout the [ADDRESS_903892] been sustained and whether the meditation or yoga practice has been continued. The study will not impose any restrictions on the participants after week 8. In other words, participants are then free to pursue other interventions if they wish. After a study is closed to new enrollment, a feedback questionnaire will be sent to all study participants.The feedback questionnaire consists of two parts: - the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (3 questions) and - 6 questions about participant’s decision to discontinue the study.

However, the psychoeducation component is given to all participants and therefore there is no delay due to research procedures. We anticipate psychoeducation does confer some benefit as it includes valuable information about ways to reduce anxiety that are drawn from the CBT courses in the ThisWayUP courses from New South Wales University. In fact, this is why all groups will be receiving psychoeducation. Our

goal is to determine whether meditation and/or Kundalini Yoga confer additional benefit on top of that obtained from the psychoeducation. Our answer is that because all participants are receiving a therapeutic modality that should confer some benefit, we do not believe there is a delay in starting treatment. Note on Psychoeducation:  Psychoeducation appears to be an effective intervention for anxiety/depression and psychological distress according to two recent reviews (Donker, Griffiths, Cuijpers, & Christensen, 2009; Rodrigues et al., 2018). Donker et al. (2009) concluded that ‘brief passive psychoeducational interventions’ in particular may prove effective in reducing symptoms. Further, in a recent study conducted by [CONTACT_669160] (2018) examining online interventions for health anxiety, the authors found medium and significant reductions on health anxiety, generalized anxiety, depression and disability in the psychoeducation control group. A similar methodology to the current study was employed using 2-4-page fact sheets on anxiety-related topi[INVESTIGATOR_669143].Maximum duration of delay to standard care or treatment of known efficacyThere is no delay as all participants will be receiving treatment. All participants in this study will be able to continue during the study with whatever treatment they had been receiving prior to the start of this study. All participants are asked to not start new treatments during the first [ADDRESS_903896] any new treatments received. After the 8 weeks, participants can pursue other treatments as they wish; as a gift for completing our study, all participants will be offered a free subscription to Journey meditation recordings. For follow-up purposes (3- and 6-months), we will collect information on any/all treatments (e.g., psychopharmacological, psychotherapeutic, mind-body therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) that participants have engaged in during the post-treatment phase to control for this at the analysis stage.   There is no delay as a result of completing study questionnaires as these can be done on the same day as starting treatment.Maximum duration of delay to standard care or treatment of known efficacy:[ADDRESS_903897] to participate in this study in order to obtain guidance in meditation or yoga

 Statistician Data preparation and analysis is performed by a research scientist for the team.  Study Objectives The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether heightened anxiety in the context of COVID-[ADDRESS_903900] not yet been infected with the novel corona virus.   The primary study goal is to examine the extent to which anxiety can be reduced through the use of on-line training programs. All participants will receive Anxiety Reduction Training using cognitive-behavioral methods known to be helpful in reducing stress, anxiety, depression, and insomnia. In addition, two-thirds of participants will be randomly assigned to receive training in either Kundalini Yoga (KY) or mindfulness meditation. The investigators will assess the degree to which each of these training programs lead to reduced stress, improved well-being, decreased multisystem symptoms, enhanced mood, and reduced cognitive complaints. Participants will complete self-report assessments at 2-week intervals during the 8 weeks of the acute phase of the study and then again 3- and 6-months later. For details see PSF.  General Study Population See PSF respective section Inclusion-Exclusion Criteria  See PSF respective section Study Assessments See PSF respective section Sample size The study enrollment was closed in 2022 with a sample size of 256.  Randomization  Randomization will be a simple allocation with 1:1:1 ratio. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: a) Meditation (using Journey meditation) with psychoeducation; b) Kundalini Yoga (provided through an on- line video program) with psychoeducation; or c) psychoeducation alone.  Primary aim#1 Aim 1: Test whether Kundalini Yoga with psychoeducation results in a significantly greater reduction in anxiety and multi-system symptom severity compared to psychoeducation alone.  Primary aim #2 Aim 2: Test whether a mindfulness meditation practice with psychoeducation leads to a significantly greater reduction in anxiety and multi-system symptom severity compared to psychoeducation alone.  Secondary aims and Exploratory goals:  Aim 3: To assess whether treatment outcomes are moderated by [CONTACT_4113]-19 related variables and personal variables. Aim 4: To assess at the follow-up at month [ADDRESS_903901] been sustained.  Aim 5: To assess whether there is a difference in both primary and secondary outcomes between the Kundalini Yoga and the meditation treatment groups.  
Timing of Analysis Analysis will be performed after the study is stopped for enrollment and a year after to make sure that all participants have finished their participation.  Analysis Population We conduct analysis of a change score between baseline and week 8 for those who were randomized into one of the study arms and completed active treatment phase.

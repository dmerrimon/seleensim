Study Design  
This study will be a randomized, single blind, 3 -period, 3 -treatment, single -dose, single -center, 
crossover study. The study will include the assessment of BGF MDI formulated with 3 different 
propellants: CCI (Treatment A [test]), CCI (Treatment B [test]) and HFA (Treatment C 
[reference]).  
The study will comprise:  
! Screening period: up to [ADDRESS_979648] dosing;  
! Three treatment periods of maximum 3 days each: subjects will be resident from the morning 
of the day before the first dosing with BGF MDI (Day -1) in Treatment Period 1, throughout 
all treatment and  washout periods up to discharge on Day 2 of Treatment Period 3; and  
! Follow -up: within [ADDRESS_979649]  
BGF MDI formulated with 3 different propellants: Treatment A ( CCI propellant [test]), 
Treatment B ( CCI propellant [test]) and Treatment C (HFA propellant [reference]).  
Outcome Endpoints  
Pharmacokinetic Endpoints:  
Where possible, PK parameters will be assessed for budesonide, glycopyrronium, and 
formoterol from plasma concentrations.  
! Primary PK parameters: Cmax, AUCinf, and AUClast for test and reference treatment  
! Secon dary PK parameters: tmax, t½ λz, MRT, λz, CL/F, Vz/F, TRCmax, TRAUCinf, and

Budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol MDI - D5985C00001  05 March 2021  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  6 of 91 Safety and tolerability variables will include  
! Adverse events (AEs)/Serious adverse events (SAEs)  
! Vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature,oxygen 
saturation, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697])  
! 12-lead safety and digital ele ctrocardiograms (ECGs) as well as cardiac telemetry  
! Physical examination  
! Laboratory assessments (Hematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis)  
! Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038]  
! Taste assessment  
Viral serology and drugs of abuse, alcohol and cotinine will be assessed for eligibility. Use of 
concomitant medication will also be assessed and reported.  
Exploratory Endpoints: 
! Not applicable  
Statistical Methods  
Presentation and Analysis of Pharmacokin etic Data:  
All PK concentrations, parameter summaries and statistical analyses will be presented for the 
PK Analysis Set, unless otherwise specified. The PK concentration and parameter listings will 
be presented for the Safety Analysis Set and will include  all reportable individual PK results.  
Individual PK concentration and parameter data for any subjects not included in the PK Analysis 
Set or excluded from the descriptive summary tables, figures and/or inferential statistical 
analyses will be included in  the listings and flagged with an appropriate footnote.  
The test treatments will be compared to the reference treatment separately (Treatment A vs 
Treatment C and Treatment B vs Treatment C) and also separately for each analyte. The 
statistical analyses will be performed using a linear mixed effects analysis of  variance model, 
using the natural logarithm of AUCinf, AUClast, and Cmax as the response variables, with 
sequence, period, treatment as fixed effects and subject nested within sequence as random effect. 
Transformed back from the logarithmic scale, geometr ic means together with and the intra -
subject coefficient of variation confidence intervals (CIs) (2 sided 95%) for AUCinf, AUClast, 
and Cmax will be estimated and presented. In addition, ratios of geometric means together with 
CIs (2 sided 90%) will be est imated and presented. The 90% CI of the geometric mean ratios of 
the PK parameters will be evaluated against the standard bioequivalence range of 80.00% to 
125.00%.  
Additionally, the median difference in untransformed tmax between the test treatments and t he 
reference treatment for each analyte and the 90% CIs for the median differences will be 
calculated using the non -parametric Hodges Lehmann method.

Budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol MDI - D5985C00001  05 March 2021  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  7 of 91 Safety data (scheduled and unscheduled) will be presented in the data listings. Continuous 
variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 
median, maximum) by [CONTACT_3148]. Categorical variables will be summarized in frequency tables 
(frequency and proportio n) by [CONTACT_3148], if applicable. The analysis of the safety variables will 
be based on the Safety Analysis Set.  
Adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_718135]. Further more, listings of SAEs and AEs that led 
to withdrawal will be made and the number of subjects who had any AEs, SAEs, AEs that led to 
withdrawal, and AEs with severe intensity will be summarized. Adverse events that occur before 
dosing will be reported sepa rately.  
Tabulations and listings of data for vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, digital ECGs and 12 -lead 
safety ECGs (listings only), telemetry (listings only) and spi[INVESTIGATOR_718081]. Results 
from the taste assessment will be presented separ ately in listings only. Any new or aggravated 
clinically relevant abnormal medical physical examination finding compared to the baseline 
assessment will be reported as an AE. Data will be summarized for the observed values at each 
scheduled assessment, tog ether with the corresponding changes from the baseline when baseline 
is defined. Clinical laboratory data will be reported in the units provided by [CONTACT_718136], and in Système International units in the 
Clinical Study Report.  
Out-of-range values for safety laboratory assessments will be flagged in individual listings as 
well as summarized descriptively using agreed standard reference ranges and/or extended 
reference ranges (eg, [COMPANY_008], program, or lab oratory ranges).  
Determination of Sample Size  
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_718082] [ADDRESS_979650] formulations of 
BGF MDI with NGPs compared with the current formulation with HFA propellant. Therefore, 
no sample size calculati on has been performed.  
It is expected that 48 healthy subjects will be randomized to a 6 -sequence Williams design for 
3 periods and 3 treatments: ABC, BCA, CAB, ACB, BAC, CBA, in order to ensure at least [ADDRESS_979651] an evaluable PK profile, ie, (1) receive active 
treatment, (2) do not significantly violate protocol inclusion or exclusion criteria, or deviate 
significantly from the protocol, and (3) do not have unavailable or incomplete data which may 
influence the PK analysis.

3. INTRODUCTION  
3.1. Background Information  
Pressurized MDIs are frequently used in the application of therapeutic delivery for the treatment 
of pulmonary diseases, such as COPD and/or asthma. Their formulations are generally 
comprised of a therapeutic material, a propellant, co-solvents, and surfactants to prevent drug -
aerosol coagulation and to lubricate moving parts of the metering valve. Historically these 
propellants were ozone -depleting chlorofluorocarbons, which prompted the search for more 
environmentally friendly alter natives [ 1]. 
The current HFA propellant (reference treatment) is known to have a relatively high GWP 
compared with some alternative propellants and contributes substantially to the Sponsor, 
[COMPANY_008]’s carbon footprint. The reformulation of [COMPANY_008]’s  MDI products with a NGP 
that has much lower GWP will allow patients to continue to use MDI type treatments while 
contributing to [COMPANY_008]’s sustainability efforts.  
[COMPANY_008] is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a Budesonide, Glycopyrronium, and Formoterol Fumarate MDI, 
hereinafter referred to as BGF MDI, for the treatment of COPD and asthma. The use of BGF 
MDI has recently been approved for the treatment of COPD. This drug product is a M DI 
formulated as a suspension with micronized active pharmaceutical ingredients and Co -
Suspension™ Delivery Technology.  
The Co -Suspension™ Delivery Technology consists of spray -dried porous particles comprised 
of the phospholipid 1,2 -distearoyl -sn-glycero -3-phosphocholine and calcium chloride (DSPC) 
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment No. 2  [COMPANY_008]  
Budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol MDI - D5985C00001  [ADDRESS_979666] that utilize either the current 
propellant (HFA [Treatment C]) or one of two NGPs with lower GWP ( CCI [Treatment A] and 
CCI [Treatment B]). This will be the first study of B GF MDI formulated with the NGPs and 
will determine the relative bioavailability of the new formulations compared with the current 
formulation.  
3.2. Investigational Medicinal Product Information  
3.2.1.  Description of Investigational Medicinal Products  
The study will in clude the assessment of BGF MDI formulated with 3 different propellants:  
CCI (Treatment A [test]), CCI (Treatment B [test]) and HFA (Treatment C [reference]). Each

! Treatment B: 2 inhalations of  of BGF MDI ( CCI  propellant) - test

! Treatment C: 2 inhalations of  of BGF MDI (HFA propellant) - reference 
formulation.  
No fluids will be allowed apart from water which can be given until 1 hour prior to 
administration of the investigational products and then from 2 hours after administratio n of the 
investigational products. A meal will be given 4 hours after administration of the investigational 
products.  
There will be a 3 to 7 -days washout between each treatment period. Subjects will be resident 
from the morning of the day before dosing wit h BGF MDI in Treatment Period 1 until 24 hours 
following dosing in Treatment Period 3.  
3.2.2.  Clinical Pharmacokinetics  
Budesonide, glycopyrronium, and formoterol fumarate are components (alone or in 
combination) of approved inhalation products (HFA propellant ba sed) for treatment of patients 
with COPD and their safety and efficacy are well characterized. Specific nonclinical absorption, 
distribution, metabolism, and excretion studies for the combination have not been conducted as 
it has been extensively investiga ted and is available in marketed products. General 
PK/toxicokinetic parameters were assessed in rats and dogs in (or in parallel to) the toxicity 
studies on the FDC and each active substance individually and showed no significant PK 
interactions. The Spons or has completed 13 clinical studies in support of the clinical 
development program for BGF MDI. In addition, the Sponsor has completed 3 PK studies  
(Phase 1) and 1 clinical (Phase 2) study in support of the clinical development program for BGF 
MDI to ass ist in dose selection for budesonide [ 1]. 
Budesonide  
The plasma protein binding of budesonide is moderate with an unbound fraction of 8 to 15% in 
human and nonclinical species plasma. Budesonide is a high clearance compound with the 
elimination being solely dependent on metabolic clearance. Two major metabol ites, formed via 
CYP3A4 catalyzed biotransformation, have been identified as 16 α-hydroxyprednisolone and 
6β-hydroxybudesonide. The corticosteroid activity of each of these metabolites is less than 1% 
of that of the parent compound. Data indicates little po tential for budesonide to be involved in 
drug-drug interactions. Budesonide is a substrate of P -glycoprotein and did not show any 
inhibition toward any of the transporters tested. In addition, budesonide did not inhibit or induce CCI

23 of 91 any CYP enzymes with the e xception of a moderate inhibition of CYP3A4 at a relatively high 
concentration [ 1]. 
CONFIDENTIAL  AND PROPRIETARY  
Glycopyrronium  
The free fraction of glycopyrronium in plasma is approximately 60% to 80% in nonclinical 
species and approximately 50% in human.  In vitro, hepatocytes from nonclinical species and 
man showed the main metabolic pathways in most species were mono -oxygenation, di -
oxygenation and mono -oxygenation in combination with desaturation. No turnover was seen in 
lung microsomes. CYP2D6 was foun d to be the predominant CYP isoform involved in the 
metabolism of glycopyrronium. However, in vivo metabolism data in animals showed that 
unchanged glycopyrronium accounted for the major part of drug -related material in plasma and 
urine following intraveno us administration whereas an acidic metabolite (formed by [CONTACT_718143]) was the major metabolite in plasma following oral administration. 
Glycopyrronium shows some drug transporter interactions at high concentrations, but the 
potential for drug interaction is considered to be low from comparison to relevant plasma 
concentrations at a therapeutic dose [ 1]. 
Formoterol Fumarate  
The free fraction of formoterol in plasma is approximately 50% in both human and nonclinical 
species. The primary meta bolism of formoterol is by [CONTACT_718144] O -
demethylation followed by [CONTACT_718145]. Secondary metabolic pathways 
include deformylation and sulfate conjugation. The CYP enzymes involved in the O -
demethylation are CYP2D6  and CYP2C. Possible interaction of formoterol with other 
substrates metabolized by [CONTACT_718146]. Results indicated that drug -drug 
interactions do not seem likely except possibly for CYP2D6; however, low concentrations of 
formoterol with th erapeutic dosing makes any interaction unlikely [ 1].

Refer to [ 2] and [ 3] for information on the NGPs.  
3.2.3.  Adverse Events, Contraindications and Warnings  
As the IMP contains budesonide, glycopyrroniumand formoterol, the type and severityof 
adverse reactions associated with each of these components may be expected.  
To date, the clinical development program has evaluated over [ZIP_CODE] patients with COPD and 
BGF MDI was found to be well -tolerated with a safety profile commensurate with the 
individual components and the medication class. The following AEs may be associated with 
BGF MDI: oral candidiasis, pneumonia, hyperglycemia, anxiety, insomnia, headache, 
palpit ations, dysphonia, coughing, nausea, urinary tract infections, and muscle spasms – 
common frequency; hypersensitivity, depression, agitation, restlessness, nervousness, tremor, 
dizziness, angina pectoris, tachycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, throat irritation , bronchospasms, 
dry mouth, bruising, urinary retention, chest pain, endocrine and psychiatric disorders -

Budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol MDI - D5985C00001  [ADDRESS_979668] been  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  
performed, therefore co -administration with other anticholinergic and/or long -acting β2-agonist 
containing medicinal product is not recommended [ 1]. 
No reproductive and  development toxicity studies have been conducted with BGF MDI since 
each of the individual active substances have been investigated. As with other 
glucocorticosteroids, budesonide is teratogenic and embryocidal in studies in rats and rabbits. 
Formoterol h as been shown to cause embryofetal toxicity, teratogenicity, and reduced male 
fertility only at very high doses, and glycopyrronium has shown no significant effects on 
reproduction at large multiples of the therapeutic dose. Experience with glucocorticoste roids 
suggests that rodents are more prone to teratogenic effects from glucocorticosteroids than 
humans. Studies of pregnant women have shown that inhaled budesonide does not increase the 
risk of abnormality when used during pregnancy. However, there are n o adequate and well 
controlled studies of the use of BGF MDI during pregnancy and lactation, therefore women will 
not be allowed to participate in this study [ 1]. 
There is no previous clinical experience with the NGPs ( CCI  and CCI ), however preclinical 
data generated indicates an adequate safety profile. For more information on the preclinical data 
generated, refer to [ 2] and [ 3].

Budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol MDI - D5985C00001  [ADDRESS_979681] in this study, 
excluding repeat samples, is summarized in Table 3 –4. 
Table 3 –[ADDRESS_979682] not exceed 500 mL.  
3.3.5.  Order of Assessments  
It is important that PK sampling occurs as close as possible to scheduled time. In order to 
achieve this , other assessments scheduled at the same time may be initiated prior to the time 
point. The sequence at a particular time point is:  
1 Electrocardiograms.  
2 Vital signs (systolic and diastolic BP, pulse rate, SpO 2, body temperature and respi[INVESTIGATOR_862]).  
3 Pharm acokinetic blood sampling (will be drawn at the specified time point).  
4 Spi[INVESTIGATOR_038].  
In the event of a delay due to technical or logistical issues with the vital sign assessment, PK 
blood sampling should be prioritized to ensure that it is taken within the ±  1-minute window 
allowed.  
Pre-dose assessments (except for pre -dose PK assessments) may be performed up to 
60 minutes prior to dosing.  
3.4. Dose Rationale  
The current dosage is 2 inhalations BID and therefore 2 inhalations should be sufficient to 
reliably estim ate PK parameters. The dose of the propellant to which participants will be 
exposed, is reflective of a 12 hour cycle which is part of the 2 inhalation BID dosage of BGF.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  33 of 91 3.5. Risk -benefit Assessment  
3.5.1.  Risks  
See Section 3.2.3 for risks and AEs that may be associated with BGF MDI.  
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, safety, known and expected 
benefits, and potential risks of BGF MDI is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure [ 1]. 
Overall, BGF MDI is well tolerated, especially considering that this study includes only 
single -dose administrations.  
Since the products to test are reformulations based on a change in the excipi[INVESTIGATOR_718091]:  
! The active ingredients are the same  
! Treatment is expected  to be as safe as it was previously  
! Treatment is expected to be as effective as it was previously  
! Inhaler device of reformulated drug is same as previous inhaler  
! NGPs are not expected to be environmentally damaging  
! Trials have been undertaken with the NGP -based products in the past  
CCI  
was negative in a battery of genotoxicity tests. It was also very well  
tolerated in single -dose (mouse and rat) and repeat dose (rat and dog) studies with the most 
noteworthy in -life finding being a non -adverse, slight reduction in body weight gain in dog s  
(up to 3620 mg/kg/day). During an inhaled multigeneration reproductive toxicology study,  
10 female rats given [ZIP_CODE] ppm for 6 hours/day (equating to female doses  
> [ZIP_CODE] mg/kg/day) were found dead or were killed early during the lactation stage 
(distr ibuted across the F0 and F1 generations). In one F0 animal, the paralysis was associated 
with brain lesions identified histologically; there were no histological findings to explain the 
deaths/poor condition of other decedents [ 2]. 
In repeat dose studies i n rats, microscopic changes were observed in the heart and liver. In 
repeat dose rat studies, very high gas concentrations were associated with an exacerbation of 
progressive murine cardiomyopathy, a commonly observed background finding in control 
animals.  The severity of this finding was low and did not progress upon longer term dosing; a 
NOAEL of 5000 ppm (6 or 4 hours/day) was maintained at [ADDRESS_979683] activity. In a 2 week study, rats g iven ≥ 
[ZIP_CODE] ppm showed hepatocyte vacuolation and inflammation with alterations in some 
associated clinical pathology parameters. This finding was not observed in longer term studies 
up to 6 months at doses to [ZIP_CODE] ppm. There were no findings in the hear t or liver of dogs 
treated with CCI  for up to 3 months ([ZIP_CODE] ppm for 2 hour/day [> 3000 mg/kg/day]). The CCI

Budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol MDI - D5985C00001  05 March 2021  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  34 of 91 NOAEL in the 6 month rat study (5180 ppm, 4280 mg/kg/day) provides a safety margin in 
excess of > 2000 fold, compared with the proposed human single -dose of 1.95 mg/kg [ 2]. 
In conclusion, based on the significant safety margins achieved (> 2000 to > 3000 -fold) 
demonstrated, the data from the toxicology studies completed to date are considered 
appropriate to support the proposed clinical trial [ 2]. 
CCI  
was negative in a battery of genotoxicity tests while in single and repeat  
dose toxicity studies, transient clinical observations were recorded during 
the dosing/exposure period which generally recovered upon cessation of dosing; exceptions to 
this w ere occasional deaths due to self -injury (primarily recorded in rats) and tube deaths 
(mice) at very high gas concentrations (at which levels, low oxygen levels were recorded). No 
other toxicologically important findings were observed in these studies. The  NOAELs 
achieved in the 14 -day repeat dose studies provide significant margins to a proposed single 
human dose of  
1.52 mg/kg (2 shots of 45.6 mg CCI /shot) in the proposed clinical study (between > 2000 
to > [ZIP_CODE] times) [ 3]. 
In conclusion, based on the si gnificant safety margins achieved (> 2000 to > [ZIP_CODE] fold), the 
data from the toxicology studies completed to date are considered appropriate to support the 
proposed clinical trial [ 3].

10.1. Overview  
The statistical methodology below describes the statistical analysis as it is foreseen when the 
study is being planned.  
If circumstances should arise during the study rendering the analysis inappropriate, or if in the 
meantime improved methods of analysis should come to light, different analyses may be 
performed. A separate SAP will not be written for the study. Any deviations from the 
statistical methodology defined in this protocol, reasons for such deviations and all 
alternative/additional statistical analyses that may be performed will be described i n the CSR. 
Such changes to analyses may be written into an abbreviated SAP, if appropriate. The 
verification and review of all statistical modeling assumptions will be documented 
appropriately.  
10.2. General Statistical Methodology  
All original and derived param eters as well as demographic and disposition data will be listed 
and described using summary statistics. All safety data (scheduled and unscheduled) will be 
presented in the data listings.  
Demographic and baseline data will be summarized for the Randomized  Set. Pharmacokinetic 
data will be summarized by [CONTACT_718167]. Safety and tolerability 
data will be summarized by [CONTACT_46936].  
Frequency counts (number of subjects [n] and percentages) will be made for ea ch qualitative 
variable. Descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum and 
maximum) will be calculated for each quantitative variable (unless otherwise stated). 
Descriptive statistics will only be presented if n > 3. If no subje cts have data at a given 
timepoint, then only n = 0 will be presented. If n < 3, only the n, minimum and maximum will 
be presented. If n = 3, only the n, median, minimum and maximum will be presented. The 
other descriptive statistics will be left blank.  
The following rules will apply to any repeated safety assessments occurring within each 
treatment period:  
! If the repeated measurement of a specific parameter occurs prior to IMP administration (Day 
1), then the last obtained value prior to dosing will be u sed in the descriptive statistics and 
in the calculation of changes from baseline;  
! If the repeated measurement of a specific parameter occurs after IMP administration (Day 
1), then the first (non -missing) value after dosing will be used in descriptive st atistics and 
in the calculation of changes from baseline.

10.5. Protocol Deviations  
Protocol deviations are considered any deviation from the CSP relating to a subject, and 
include the following:  
! Inclusion/exclusion criteria  deviations  
! Dosing deviations (eg, incorrect treatment received, subject was not fasted as per the 
protocol requirements prior to and after dosing)  
! Time window deviations for safety and/or PK assessments  
! Subjects receiving prohibited concomitant medi cations  
! Other procedural and study conduct deviations recorded by [CONTACT_718169] a protocol 
deviation log  
The criteria for the assessment and reporting of protocol deviations will be stipulated in a 
separate study specific PDS document. This will i nclude a WAD which stipulates tolerance 
windows for safety and PK assessments. Measurements performed within these tolerance 
windows will not be considered as protocol deviations and will not be reported.  
All protocol deviations will be discussed at the data review meeting prior to database hard 
lock in order to define the analysis sets for the study.  
Important protocol deviations will be listed by [CONTACT_1130].  
Protocol deviations will be handled in accordance with Parexel SOPs.

10.8.1.  Prior and Concomitant Medication  
Prior medications are those that started and stopped prior to the first dose of IMP; all 
medications taken after first dosing are consi dered as concomitant (including medications that 
started prior to dosing and continued after). Prior medication started within [ADDRESS_979739] dose of IMP will be recorded also in the concomitant medication module of 
ClinBase™.  
Prior and concom itant medication will be listed by [CONTACT_718173]: planned treatment sequence, reported name, Preferred Term, the route of 
administration, dose, frequency, start date/time, duration and indication. Prior and 
concomitant medication will be coded according to the Sponsor’s drug dictionary.  
The duration will be calculated as:  
Duration = end date/time – start date/time

collection time deviations of greater than ± 10% from the protocol scheduled time will be 
used in the PK analysis but will be flagged for exclusion fro m the summary tables and 
corresponding figures.  
Protocol scheduled times will be used to present the PK concentration summary tables and 
corresponding geometric mean concentration -time figures.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pharmacokinetic Parameter Data  
All reportable PK parameters, i ncluding diagnostic parameters, will be listed for the Safety 
Analysis Set for each subject by [CONTACT_3148], where treatments are pooled across periods and 
visit, for each analyte separately.  
All PK parameters will be summarized for the PK Analysis Set separa tely for each analyte by

For consistency, the plasma c oncentration values used in the gmean concentration -time plots 
will be those given in the descriptive statistics summary table for each time point. 
Concentrations that are NQ will be handled as described for the descriptive statistics; if the 
gmean is NQ, the value plotted will be zero for linear plots and missing for semi -logarithmic 
plots. Any gmean ± gSD error bar values that are negative will be truncated at zero on linear 
concentration -time plots and omitted from semi -logarithmic plots.  
10.9.3.  Statistical Ana lysis of Pharmacokinetic Data  
The relative bioavailability will be assessed between the test treatments and the reference 
treatment separately ( CCI  propellant [Treatment A] vs HFA propellant [Treatment C] and 
CCI propellant [Treatment B] vs HFA propellant [Treatment C]) separately for each analyte 
based on the PK Analysis Set.  
For each analyte, the statistical analyses will be performed using a linear mixed -effects 
analysis of variance model using the natural logarithm of AUCinf, AUClast, and Cmax as the 
response variables, with sequence, period, treatment as fixed effects and subject nested within 
sequence as random effect. Pairwise statistical models will be fit to the data such that, the 
analysis for each comparison will be conducted excluding the data fr om the treatment that is 
not relevant for the comparison in question. For each analysis, transformed back from the 
logarithmic scale, geometric means together with the CIs (2 -sided 95%) and the intra -subject 
CV for AUCinf, AUClast, and Cmax for each treatm ent will be estimated and presented. In

variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, minimum, median, 
maximum) by [CONTACT_3148]. Categorical variables will be summarized in frequency tables 
(frequency and proportion) by [CONTACT_3148]. The analysis of the safety variables will be based on 
the Safety Analysis Set. However, the safety data for the replacement subjects may als o be 
presented separately from the original subjects so as not to attenuate any potential safety 
signals stemming from less than full exposure to the investigational product.  
Adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_718183]. 
Furthermore, listings of SAEs and adverse events that led to withdrawal will be made and the 
number of subjects who had any AE, SAEs, AEs that led to withdrawal, and AEs with severe

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  71 of 91 Adverse events will be assigned to a treatment based on the start date/time of the AE in 
relation to dosing in that period; for tabulation purposes the AE will then be assigned to the 
treatment received in the respective treatment period as follows:  
! Treatment Period 1: AEs with start d ate/time at the time of or after dosing in Treatment 
Period 1 until the time of dosing in Treatment Period 2.  
! Treatment Period 2: AEs with start date/time at the time of or after dosing in Treatment 
Period 2 until the time of dosing in Treatment Period 3.  
! Treatment Period 3: AEs with start date/time at the time of or after dosing in Treatment 
Period 3 until the final follow -up visit.  
Adverse events with missing start dates/times will be handled as follows:  
! If the start date is completely missing but the end date is known and shows that the AE 
ended on or after the first dose date, then the start date will be im puted as the first day of 
dosing; if the end date is known and shows that the AE ended before the first dose date, 
then the screening date will be used for the start date. If the end date is non -informative 
(ie, is missing or does not contain enough inform ation), the start date will be imputed as 
the first date of dosing;  
! If only the start day is missing the day will be imputed as the first day on which a dose was 
given in that month unless the end date is known and shows that the AE ended before a 
dose w as given in that month; in which case the date will be imputed as 01. If the end 
date is non -informative (ie, is missing or does not contain enough information), the start 
date will be imputed as the first date of dosing in the known month. If the month is  not a 
dosing month the date will be imputed as 01;  
! If the start day and month are missing the date will be imputed as the first day of dosing in 
the known year unless the end date is known and shows that the AE ended before a dose 
was given in that year ; in which case the start day and month will be imputed as 01Jan or 
with the date of screening if this is later. If the end date is non -informative (ie, is missing 
or does not contain enough information), the start date will be imputed as the first date of  
dosing in the known year. If the year is not a year of dosing then the date will be imputed 
as 01Jan or with the date of screening if this is later;  
! Missing times will be imputed as 00:00 h or with the time of dosing for events starting on a

11.1. Definitions  
11.1.1.  Definition of Adverse Events  
An AE is the development of any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical study 
subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and un intended sign 
(eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom (for example nausea, chest pain), or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related 
to the medicinal product.  
The term AE is used to include b oth Serious and Non -Serious AEs and can include a 
deterioration of a pre -existing medical occurrence. An AE may occur at any time, including 
run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered.  
11.1.2.  Definitions of Serious Adverse Event  
A SAE is an AE occurring during any study phase (ie, run -in, treatment, washout, follow -up), 
that fulfills one or more of the following criteria:  
! Results in death  
! Is immediately life -threatening  
! Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17127] e xisting hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
! Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions  
! Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
! Is an important medical event that may jeopard ize the subject or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.

Budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol MDI - D5985C00001  05 March 2021  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  76 of 91 Adverse Events for malignant tumors reported during a study should generally be as sessed as 
SAEs. If no other seriousness criteria apply, the ‘important medical event’ criterion should be 
used. In certain situations, however, medical judgment on an individual event basis should be 
applied to clarify that the malignant tumor event should  be assessed and reported as a 
NonSerious AE. For example, if the tumor is included as medical history and progression 
occurs during the study, but the progression does not change treatment and/or prognosis of the 
malignant tumor, the AE may not fulfill th e attributes for being assessed as serious, although 
reporting of the progression of the malignant tumor as an AE is valid and should occur. Also, 
some types of malignant tumors, which do not spread remotely after a routine treatment that 
does not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be assessed as Non -Serious; examples include Stage [ADDRESS_979747] of AEs that were not reported as SAEs or where relevant DAEs and withdrawal from 
the study. Based on the expert’s judgment, significant AEs of particular clinical importance 
may, after consultation with the Global Safety Physici an, be considered OAEs and reported as 
such in the CSR. A similar review of other data from laboratory tests, vital signs, ECGs and 
other safety assessments will be performed for identification of OAEs.  
Examples of these are marked hematological and other laboratory abnormalities, and certain 
events that lead to intervention (other than those already classified as serious), dose reduction 
or significant additional treatment.  
11.2. Recording of Adverse Events  
11.2.1.  Time Period for Collection of Adverse Events  
Adverse Events will be collected from the first dose of IMP throughout the treatment period 
up to and including the follow -up visit.  
SAEs will be recorded from the time of informed consent.  
11.2.2.  Follow -up of Unresolv ed Adverse Events  
Any AEs that are unresolved at the subject’s last visit in the study are followed up by [CONTACT_978] 
[INVESTIGATOR_718122], but without further recording in the ClinBase™.  
[COMPANY_008] retains the right to request additional informa tion for any subject with ongoing 
AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary.  
11.2.3.  Variables  
The following variables will be collected for each AE:  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment No. 2  [COMPANY_008]  
Budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol MDI - D5985C00001  05 March 2021  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  77 of 91 ! AE diagnosis/description  
! The date and time when the AE started and stopped  
! Intensity  
! Wheth er the AE is serious or not  
! Principle Investigator causality rating against the investigational product (yes or no)  
! Action taken with regard to IMP  
! AE caused subject’s withdrawal from study (yes or no)  
! Outcome  
In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs:  
! Date AE met criteria for serious AE  
! Date PI [INVESTIGATOR_718123]  
! Adverse Event is serious due to  
! Date of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11298]  
! Date of discharge  
! Probable cause of death  
! Date of death  
! Autopsy performed  
! Causality assessment in relation to Study procedure(s)  
! Causality assessment to other medication  
The following intensity ratings will be used:  
1 Mild (awareness of s ign or symptom, but easily tolerated).  
2 Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities).  
3 Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities).  
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs:  
! Severity is a measure of intensity whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_14540] 
11.1.2 . 
! An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea 
that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea , but not a SAE. On the 
other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disability may be considered a 
mild stroke but would be an SAE.  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment No. 2  [COMPANY_008]  
Budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol MDI - D5985C00001  [ADDRESS_979748] and each adver se event, 
and answer “yes” or “no” to the question “Do you consider that there is a reasonable 
possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198]?”  
For SAEs, causal relationship will also be assessed for other medication, any additional drug 
and study procedures. Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure 
the causal relationship is implied as “yes”.  
A guide to the interpretat ion of the causality question is found in Appendix A of this CSP.  
11.2.5.  Adverse Events Based on Signs and Symptoms  
All AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_718194]: “Have you had any health probl ems since you were last asked?” , or 
revealed by [CONTACT_718195]™.  
When collecting AEs the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a 
list of signs and symptoms.  
However, if a diagnosis is k nown and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally 
part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately.  
11.2.6.  Adverse Events Based on Examinations and Tests  
The results from protocol -mandated laboratory tests,  vital signs, ECGs and other safety 
assessments will be summarized in the CSR.  
Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol -mandated laboratory values, vital signs, 
ECGs and other safety assessments should therefore only be reported as AEs if they ful fill any 
of the SAE criteria or are the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the investigational 
product.  
If deterioration in a laboratory value or vital sign is associated with clinical signs and 
symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as a n AE and the associated laboratory result, 
or vital sign will be considered as additional information.  
Wherever possible the reporting PI [INVESTIGATOR_718124], rather than the laboratory term (eg, 
anemia versus low hemoglobin value).  
In the absence of c linical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in nonprotocol -
mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s).  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment No. 2  [COMPANY_008]  
Budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol MDI - D5985C00001  05 March 2021  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  79 of 91 Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical 
examination as compared with the baseline assessm ent will be reported as an AE.  
11.2.7.  Hy's Law  
Cases where a subject shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation 
and occurrences of AST or ALT ≥ 3 × ULN together with TBL ≥ 2 × ULN may need to be  
reported as SAEs. Please refer to Appendix C for further instruction on cases of  increases in 
liver biochemistry and evaluation of Hy’s Law.  
11.3. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the investigational 
product, or to the study procedure(s). All SAEs will be recorde d in the ClinBase™.  
If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then PIs or other site personnel will inform 
appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives immediately, or no later than [ADDRESS_979749] the safety of participants and the safety of a study intervention 
under clinical investigation are met.  
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about  the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The 
Sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting 
to the regulatory authority, IRB, and PIs.

forwarded to PIs as necessary.  
A PI [INVESTIGATOR_718125] a SAE or other specific safety 
informa tion (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will review and then file it 
along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB, if appropriate according to 
local requirements.  
12. LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS  
12.1. Archiving of Study Document s 
All source documents generated in connection with the study will be retained in the limited 
access file storage area, respecting the privacy and confidentiality of all records that could 
identify the subjects. Direct access is allowed only for authorized  people for monitoring and 
auditing purposes. Source documents will be handled, stored and archived according to in

Further Guidance on the Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
Life-threatening  
‘Life -threatening’ means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in th e 
subject’s death. ‘Life -threatening’ does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more severe 
form it might have caused death (eg, hepatitis that resolved without hepatic failure).  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_280843] a  SAE, although the reasons for it 
may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2144]/or surgical operations 
planned before or during a study are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before 
the subject was enrolled in the st udy, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way 
during the study.  
Important Medical Event or Medical Intervention  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important medical  events may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], disability or incapacity but may jeopardize the subject or may require 
medical intervention to prevent [ADDRESS_979752] drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical 
judgment must be used.  
Examples of such events are:  
! Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring intraven ous 
hydrocortisone treatment.  
! Hepatotoxicity caused by [CONTACT_76475]/acetaminophen overdose requiring treatment with N -
acetyl cysteine.  
! Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm.  
! Blood dyscrasias (eg, neutropenia or anemia requiring blood transfusion) or convulsions that 
do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
! Development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment No. 2  [COMPANY_008]  
Budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol MDI - D5985C00001  05 March 2021  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  84 of 91 The following factors should be considered when deciding if there is a “reasonable 
possibility” that an AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_2203].  
! Time Course / Exposure to suspect drug:  
Has the subject actually received the suspect drug? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal 
relationship to the administration of the suspect drug?  
! Consistency with known drug profile:  
Was the AE consistent with the previous knowledge of the suspect drug (pharmacology and 
toxicology) or drugs of the same pharmacological class? OR, could the AE be anticipated 
from its pharmacological properties?  
! Dechallenge experience:  
Did the AE resolve or improve on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_718127]?  
! No alternative cause:  
The AE cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_718197], 
other drugs, other host or environmental factors.  
! Rechallenge experience:  
Did the AE reoccur if the su spected drug was reintroduced after having been stopped?  
Note: [COMPANY_008] would not normally recommend or support a rechallenge.  
! Laboratory tests:  
A specific laboratory investigation (if performed) has confirmed the relationship?  
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:  
! Is this a recognized feature of overdose of the drug?  
! Is there a known mechanism?  
Causality of ‘related’ i s made if following a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a  
‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship for the individual case. The expression 
‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that the re are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.  
The causality assessment is performed based on the available data including enough 
information to make an informed judgment. With limited or insufficient information in the 
case, it is likely that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’.

International Airline Transportation Association classifies bio hazardous agents into 3 
categories (http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dangerous_goods/infectious_substances.ht  
m). For transport purposes the classification of infectious substances according to risk groups 
was removed from the Dangerous Goods Regulations in the 46th edition (2005). Infectious 
substances are now classified either as Category A, Category B or Exempt . There is no direct 
relationship between Risk Groups and Categories A and B.  
Category A Infectious Substances are infectious substances in a form that, when exposure to 
it occurs, is capable of causing permanent disability, life -threatening or fatal disea se in 
otherwise healthy humans or animals. Category A pathogens are for example, Ebola and 
Lassa Fever viruses. Category A pathogens:  
Are to be packed and shipped in accordance with IATA Instruction 602.  
Category B Infectious Substances are infectious subs tances that do not meet the criteria for 
inclusion in Category A. Category B pathogens are for example, hepatitis A, B, C, D and E 
viruses, and HIV types 1 and 2. They are assigned the following UN number and proper 
shippi[INVESTIGATOR_72919]:

C 3 Identification of Potentia l Hy’s Law Cases  
In order to identify cases of PHL it is important to perform a comprehensive review of 
laboratory data for any subject who meets any of the following identification criteria in 
isolation or in combination:  
! Alanine aminotransferase ≥ 3 × ULN  
! Aspartate aminotransferase ≥ 3 × ULN  
! Total bilirubin ≥ 2 × ULN  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_718131]:

! Perform follow -up on subsequent laboratory results according to the guidance pro vided in 
the CSP.  
C 4.2  Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met  
If the subject does meet PHL criteria the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1318]:  
! Notify the [COMPANY_008] representative who will then inform the central Study Team.

symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically 
indicated. Completes follow -up SAE Form as required.  
o Investigate the etiology of the event and perform diagnostic investigations as 
discussed with the Study Physician. This includes deciding which of the tests 
available in the HL laboratory kit should be used (if applicable).  
o Complete the 3 Liver CRF Modules as information becomes available.  
# A ‘si gnificant’ change in the subject’s condition refers to a clinically relevant change in any 
of the individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST, or TBL) in isolation or in 
combination, or a clinically relevant change in associated symptoms. The determ ination of 
whether there has been a significant change will be at the discretion of the PI, this may be 
in consultation with the Study Physician if there is any uncertainty.  
C 5 Review and Assessment of Potential Hy’s Law Cases  
The instructions in this sec tion should be followed for all cases where PHL criteria are met.  
As soon as possible after the biochemistry abnormality was initially detected, the Study 
Physician contacts the PI [INVESTIGATOR_718134], to ensure 
timely analysis and reporting to health authorities within [ADDRESS_979758] and TBL elevations, 
a determination of whether the alternative explanation is an AE will be made and 
subsequently whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE:

Budesonide/glycopyrronium/formoterol MDI - D5985C00001  05 March 2021  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  90 of 91 ! If the alternative explanation is not an AE, record the alternative expl anation on the 
appropriate CRF module(s).  
! If the alternative explanation is an AE/SAE: update the previously submitted PHL SAE and 
AE CRF entries accordingly with the new information (reassessing event term; causality 
and seriousness criteria) following the AZ standard processes.  
If it is agreed that there is no explanation that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the IMP:  
! Send updated SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to [COMPANY_008] standard processes.  
∀ The ‘Medically Important’ serious criterion should be used if no other serious 
criteria apply  
∀ As there is no alternative explanation for the HL case, a causality assessment of 
‘related’ should be assigned.  
If there is an unavoidable delay, of over 15 calendar days in obtaining the information 
necessary to assess whether the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is 
no alternative explanation until such time as an informed decision can be made:  
! Provides any further update to the previously submitted SAE of PHL, (report term now 
‘Hy’s Law case’) ensuring causality assessment i s ‘related to IMP’ and the seriousness 
criterion is medically important, according to CSP process for SAE reporting.  
! Continue follow -up and review according to agreed plan. Once the necessary supplementary 
information is obtained, repeat the review and a ssessment to determine whether HL 
criteria are still met. Update the previously submitted PHL SAE report following CSP 
process for SAE reporting, according to the outcome of the review and amending the 
reported term if an alternative explanation for the li ver biochemistry elevations is 
determined.

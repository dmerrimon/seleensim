2.[ADDRESS_974940] cancer. SPY-PHI is intended for intraoperative visual  assessment of blood vessels and related 
tissue perfusion by [CONTACT_14085].  It is an im aging system used in ca pturing and viewing 
fluorescent images for visual assessment of  blood flow, as an adjunctive method for 
the evaluation of tissue perfusion, and relate d tissue-transfer circulation in tissue and 
free flaps during various surgical procedures. 
SPY-PHI allows for real time, intraoperativ e visualization and video of near infrared 
(NIR) fluorescence, which are acqui red by [CONTACT_715774].  
The imaging agent used with SPY-PHI is Indocyanine Green (IC2000), which is a 
sterile, water-soluble tricarbocyanine dy e with a peak spectral absorption at 
800-810 nm in blood plasma or blood. IC2000 contains not more than 5.0% sodium 
iodide. In this study, investigational ICG, IC2000, will be administered to subjects 
through an intradermal injection into t he peri-areolar area of the breast. 
Tc-99m radioactive colloid injection is a clear, colorless aqueous solution and will be 
injected into the peri-areolar area of the breast as per standard of care. 
Tc99m will be used in conjunc tion with the Gamma Probe. Gamma Probes detect the 
presence of gamma rays emitte d from radioactiv e isotopes in body organs or tissue . 
The system provides an increasing or decr easing sound and visual indicator (Count 
Bar) that vary in pi[INVESTIGATOR_715768]3.

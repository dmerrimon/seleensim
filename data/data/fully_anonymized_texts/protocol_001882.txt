1  Comparative Effectiveness of School and Community-Based Caries Prevention Programs for Children in Underserved, Low Income, Hispanic Communities  This is a pragmatic, cluster, randomized controlled, non-inferiority trial which compares simple vs complex caries prevention.  The study is being conducted in schools, at community-based locations, or at the [LOCATION_001] University College of Dentistry.  Simple is defined as fluoride varnish + silver diamine fluoride.  Complex is defined as fluoride varnish + traditional sealants + interim therapeutic restorations (also referred to as temporary fillings).  All interventions are: currently used in clinical practice; have American Dental Association billing codes; and, depending on the state and third party administrator, are compensated by [CONTACT_5556].

[ADDRESS_443340] NYC IRB Number S17-[ZIP_CODE] Study Type Human  Study Design Pragmatic, cluster, randomized controlled, non-inferiority trial Study Intervention Simple prevention (fluoride varnish + silver diamine fluoride) vs complex prevention (fluoride varnish + traditional sealants + interim therapeutic restorations) Study Duration 5 years Study Location(s) The study will be conducted in [LOCATION_001] City Title 1 Elementary Schools, community-based locations, or at the [LOCATION_001] University College of Dentistry Primary Objective To determine if the newer simple caries prevention is not inferior to the traditional complex caries prevention Sample Size 76 schools (approximately 20,000 children) Diagnosis and Main Inclusion Criteria The disease/condition is untreated caries.  All children in the participating schools with informed consent will be included.  The only exclusion criteria are children not in the participating schools, children without informed consent and children that are allergic to silver. Study Product and Planned Use Silver diamine fluoride (Advantage Silver Arrest).  The liquid is administered topi[INVESTIGATOR_355843], as well as pi[INVESTIGATOR_355844]. Control / Comparison The new simple prevention will be compared to the traditional complex prevention. Statistical Methodology Primary outcomes include caries arrest, caries prevention, and quality of life.  We will assess these using multilevel binomial regression and generalized estimating equations.  
[ADDRESS_443341] (IRB), Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, and applicable [LOCATION_001] University Medical Center (NYUMC) and federal regulatory requirements. 1.1 Background and Significance  1.1.1 Oral Health More than 50% of U.S. elementary school-age children have experienced caries (tooth decay or cavities), and more than 20% have untreated caries1. The oral health needs of low-income minority children are almost double U.S. averages – current estimates indicate that 70% have experienced caries, 38% have untreated caries, 66% do not have sealants, and all have difficulty accessing care1.   Even more troubling, children with untreated caries have an incidence of sepsis ranging from 5% to 10%2. In rare instances, untreated decay can lead to serious systemic infections and even death3.  Currently, only 25% of children in [LOCATION_001] City (NYC) schools receive school-based oral health care.  Importantly, these school-based oral health programs all vary in service provision and scope, and none have outcome measures to assess health equity.  1.1.2  Education Oral health has larger connections to general health and child development, such as academic performance and quality of life.  Oral health also affects children’s education.  Children with untreated caries and associated toothaches have more school absences, cannot pay attention in school, do not keep up with their peers academically, and have lower standardized test scores4-8. Additionally, children who require dental care in a traditional dental office frequently miss school.   1.1.3  Need Based on 3 years of conversations, surveys, and guidance, parents and stakeholder partners in [LOCATION_001] City requested school-based caries prevention9-10, and tracking the following patient-centered outcomes: untreated cavities, quality of life, and school performance.  Further, these parent and stakeholder partners participated in planning, designing, and pi[INVESTIGATOR_355845]. These partners are also participating in the proposed study’s conduct, dissemination, and implementation.  1.1.4 Geography NYC elementary schools serve over one million children of varying socioeconomic and racial/ethnic backgrounds, many of which are from those demographic groups with the highest oral health needs. This initiative focuses on improving the oral health of NYC children. We will enroll 76 schools across NYC to receive alternative caries prevention treatments.   1.2 Study Aims The overall goal of this study is to measurably improve oral health equity.  Towards this goal, we will compare “simple” and “complex” prevention, two packages of interventions designed to prevent and arrest dental caries.  The study design is a cluster randomized non-inferiority pragmatic trial.  Both preventive interventions are expected to be equally effective in improving health equity.  The major difference in the two protocols is that “simple” prevention costs 
8  approximately 25% of “complex” prevention.  Simple also takes approximately 25% of the time of complex prevention.  Therefore, if simple and complex are found to be equally effective, for the same time and cost, simple prevention could improve health and health equity to approximately 3 times the number of children as complex prevention.    Our prior work, and data from systematic reviews, indicates that the protocols we propose should be similarly effective in both arresting current caries and preventing subsequent caries by 50% to 80%.  Thus all children should benefit from the proposed preventions.  We will collect data on oral health and child quality of life, and assess student academic performance.   The study consists of three groups: (1) a group receiving simple prevention twice per year; (2) a group receiving complex prevention twice per year; and (3) a group receiving simple prevention once per year.   We will select 76 elementary schools to participate in the program over a five-year period. 30 elementary schools will be randomized to receive simple prevention twice per year and 30 elementary schools will be randomized to receive complex prevention twice per year. The remaining 16 schools will receive simple prevention once per year. The care will be provided in schools, community-based locations or at the [LOCATION_001] University College of Dentistry.  The inclusion criteria for the schools enrolled in groups (1) and (2) include: A Hispanic/Latino population of at least 50% and a free and reduced lunch population of at least 80%. The remaining racial/ethnic and socioeconomic distribution of these schools will include children from any race/ethnicity and economic background. The inclusion criteria for schools in group (3) include any elementary school in [LOCATION_001] City and will be selected to include representation from every major racial/ethnic group and socioeconomic level.   For the purposes of the analysis on dental-related service use and costs among Medicaid beneficiaries, all children participating in Medicaid of elementary school age will be included in the analysis, except for children in participating schools that do not provide informed consent to provide oral health and Medicaid dental service use data.  The Primary Specific Aims are to:  1. Determine the non-inferiority of simple vs complex caries prevention for preventing new caries (primary prevention). 2. Determine the non-inferiority of simple vs complex caries prevention for arresting current caries (secondary prevention). 3. Determine the impact of simple vs complex prevention on child oral health-related quality of life 4. Determine the impact of once per year vs twice per year care on the arrest and prevention of caries Notably, toothaches or office based dental care reduces in-class learning time.  If the caries prevention programs are as effective as predicted, knowing the time/trade-off will be important.  Thus a secondary outcome of the study will be school performance (school absence and student achievement).  To insure accurate assessments, program participants will be compared to children in their own schools and to children in NYC “peer schools” not participating in the study. No additional data is collected for educational outcomes from participants.   
9   The Secondary Specific Aims are to: 1. Determine the impact of prevention vs no prevention on school absence   2. Determine the impact of prevention vs no prevention on standardized test performance 3. Determine the impact of simple vs complex prevention on school absence and test performance  The exclusion criteria will be those: (1) not attending participating schools, (2) those attending participating schools without informed consent, or (3) those attending participating schools with informed consent, but without assent and (4) those allergic to silver.  For the purposes of the analysis on dental-related service use and costs among Medicaid beneficiaries, the only excluded groups are (1) children not participating in Medicaid will be excluded and (2) children participating in Medicaid in CariedAway schools, but without informed consent to provide oral health and Medicaid dental service use data.  1.3 Investigational Device Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) is a Category B low risk device.  It is a clear liquid, used for topi[INVESTIGATOR_355846]; on carious lesions to arrest decay; and on pi[INVESTIGATOR_355847].  Application is eligible for Medicaid coverage in some states. 1.4 Research Risks & Benefits  1.4.1 Risk of Investigational Device   The only known risks are allergies to silver and short-term (3-7 day) irritation from drippi[INVESTIGATOR_355848]. However oral health professionals working in this study will be trained on the proper techniques to avoid risks.  All students with a silver allergy will be excluded from participating.  The application of silver diamine fluoride may discolor any cavities resulting in a brown or black color.  This color change indicates that the cavity has stopped growing.  If accidental skin contact [CONTACT_355870] a temporary light brown staining to the lips, cheeks, or permanent staining to clothing.  For stain removal to the skin, soap and water are applied immediately.  The same procedure is applied for cleaning clothes.   1.4.2 Other Risks of Study Population   [IP_ADDRESS] Fluoride varnish Children that have a nut allergy.  Some fluoride varnish products contain pi[INVESTIGATOR_355849].  There are [ADDRESS_443342] is called FluoroDose® and will not contain pi[INVESTIGATOR_355850]. This product will be used for children that have a nut allergy.  The second fluoride varnish product is called PreviDent® and will be used on children that do not have a nut allergy.  These products are listed in section 5 under Study Device. [IP_ADDRESS] COVID-[ADDRESS_443343] to avoid transmission of SARS Cov-2 in school and community-based settings.  All [LOCATION_001] University College of Dentistry Health Care Personnel (NYUCD HCP) are required to get COVID-19 diagnostic PCR tests within 14 days prior to returning to work and submit verification, be tested every 14 days and complete the NYU daily screener. Any NYUCD HCP who fails on the “screener pass” will automatically be referred to the NYU COVID prevention & response team and will not report to work.    All clinical staff will wear personal protective equipment consistent with CDC, DOH, FDA and NYU Dentistry guidelines.  NYUCD HCP will be conducting all study related procedures at all locations.  NYUCD HCP will wear PPE based on current NYU Dentistry guidelines.  PPE is listed below:  1. Disposable gowns 2. Disposable gloves 3.

Level [ADDRESS_443344] that maximizes benefits while avoiding harm to personnel, students and parents/guardians from potential exposure to COVID-[ADDRESS_443345] benefits.  1. The benefit to all participants is that they will receive either primary or primary and secondary caries prevention once or twice yearly.  The expectation is that both the simple and complex will reduce caries by 50% to 80%. 
[ADDRESS_443346] to improvements in child oral health: an already-existing global and national burden of caries; the burden of disease in NYC; the social burden of disease, particularly affecting academic performance and psycho-social development; barriers to office-based care9; economic incentives to support treatment rather than prevention; the reduced efficacy of treatment to prevention; and large variation in care without outcome measures of effectiveness.   Without data to support the effectiveness of preventive oral health care, we predict that two things will occur (depending on state and local values and circumstances): 1) the current helter-skelter implementation of well-meaning but ineffective programs will continue; and/or 2) there will be an extinction of those public caries prevention programs that are truly effective.  From a national perspective, our preliminary data suggest that a school-based caries prevention program may represent the first program that exceeds the goals of Healthy People 2000. If this happened, it would be transformative. This information would: 1) set the stage for broader dissemination within NYC and other metropolitan areas; and 2) stimulate implementation tests of other “place-based” caries prevention programs for other populations (e.g.: mothers, elderly, etc.), in locations where people learn, work, play, and pray.   Long term, we believe that children (and adults) with improved oral health will be better prepared to learn, thrive and improve their social and economic opportunities.  These important accomplishments would be one step in reducing social inequalities.  The proposed school and community-based, cluster, randomized controlled trial, comparing two evidence-based caries prevention protocols, will address and potentially obviate all of the identified gaps. [ADDRESS_443347] and longitudinal caries prevention. 
12    2.2 Secondary Objective(s) To compare the effectiveness of simple prevention when provided twice yearly versus once yearly.  To determine if children receiving either simple prevention or complex prevention will have reduced school absence and higher academic performance when compared to matched students in non-participating schools.  To determine if children receiving simple prevention or complex prevention will have reduced dental service use and costs in Medicaid when compared to matched students in non-participating schools.  [ADDRESS_443348] group will be selected to receive simple prevention only, provided once yearly.    A total of 76 elementary schools will be selected from interested schools in [LOCATION_001] City, identified via letters and phone calls to school principals. For groups (1) and (2) 30 elementary schools will be randomized to receive simple prevention twice per year and 30 elementary schools will be randomized to receive complex prevention twice per year. For group (3), [ADDRESS_443349] year of the study, a total of 30 schools will be randomized (15 schools receiving simple prevention and 15 receiving complex prevention) to receive prevention twice per year consenting children will be followed over five years. In Year 2, 30 additional schools will be randomized to receive either simple or complex prevention twice per year. Consenting children will be followed over four years. Also in Year 2, an additional 16 schools will be selected to receive simple prevention once per year, and consenting children will be followed over four years.  Starting in year 3, all care will be provided by [CONTACT_355871], in school, at community-based locations, or at NYUCD.  Starting in year 5, NYUCD licensed dentists, dental hygienists, nurses, and/or advanced level dental hygiene students supervised by [CONTACT_355872], in school, at community-based locations, or at NYUCD.  The inclusion criteria for the schools enrolled in groups (1) and (2) include: A Hispanic/Latino population of at least 50% and a free and reduced lunch population of at least 80%. The remaining racial/ethnic and socioeconomic of the schools beyond these criteria can include children from any race/ethnicity and economic background. The inclusion criteria for schools in group (3) include any elementary school in [LOCATION_001] City. Schools in group (3) will be balanced to ensure representation from every primary race/ethnic group and from all socioeconomic tertiles.

Participating schools will be randomized or selected at the school level to receive either simple or complex prevention. All participants in a given school, community-based location, or at NYUCD will receive the same prevention as randomized. At the beginning of each school year, all students in grades PK - 8 will be given a personalized pre-populated principal recruitment letter, the parent/guardian alternate location recruitment letter, the parent/guardian recruitment flyer, a health history, the NYU Langone Health COVID-19 research participation information sheet and a blank informed consent form.  Electronic informed consent forms will be distributed to parents/guardians of new students who have not previously consented to see if they wish to have their child participate. Electronic informed consents can be distributed by [CONTACT_355874], in emails, or on the school’s social media page in the following ways:  1.

The primary end point for caries prevention will be at 3 years, and follow on to termination of trial to determine stability of prevention.  Presence / absence of caries is assessed by [CONTACT_355875]/tactile methods.  Sound tooth surfaces appear white and smooth.  Active caries appear brown and soft.  Arrested caries appear dark brown or black and hard.  For clinical assessment, we will train and standardize clinicians using validated criteria implemented by [CONTACT_7698] (CDC) in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). Training and validation were developed and documented by [CONTACT_355876], [CONTACT_355918], while at the CDC and field tested in the examination of special athletes23,24. Training and standardization of these examiners implement the World Health Organization guidelines25,26.  3.3 Secondary Study Endpoints School absence and academic performance data will be provided by [CONTACT_355877].   Medicaid claims, encounter, and eligibility data for elementary students in [LOCATION_001] City enrolled in Medicaid will be provided by [INVESTIGATOR_353947]’s Wagner School of Public Service and [LOCATION_001] University’s School of Medicine.  3.4 Primary Safety Endpoints The care provided is usual and customary care, not high-risk. The only risk about which we are aware is a toothache.  Our history suggests that this occurs in approximately 1 in 2000 children.  In our experience, this occurrence is far less than the percentage of children with tooth aches prior to initiation of prevention (approximately 5 in 100 children).

Any NYUCD HCP who fails on the “screener pass” will automatically be referred to the NYU COVID prevention & response team and will not report to work.   [IP_ADDRESS] Screening In-school Students and School Staff We will follow the school’s protocol for COVID-19 screening of students and school staff.   [IP_ADDRESS] Screening of Community-based Staff We will follow the community-based locations protocol for COVID-19 screening of their staff.   [IP_ADDRESS] Telephone Pre-screening of Children, Parent/Guardians at the Community-based Location 1. 24 hours prior to the child’s appointment the NYUCD HCP will telephone the parent/guardian and ask them the following questions: a. Have you or your child had close contact [CONTACT_355889] a confirmed or suspected COVID-[ADDRESS_443381] 14 days? c. Have you or your child had at least two of the following symptoms in the past 14 days:  chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, diarrhea, sore throat, new loss of taste or smell? 
[ADDRESS_443382] you or your child traveled within a state designated by [CONTACT_211852]’s Governor’s office as a restricted state?  If the parent/guardian answers yes to any of the above questions, the child’s appointment will be scheduled for a later date (10 or more days later)  6.1.4 Clinical Room Set-up The following procedures will be performed  The clinical treatment room set up will vary based on room size and ability to provide care at a safe distance. If the clinical room is small, only 1 station will be set up to provide care to 1 child at a time.  If the clinical room is large (eg: auditorium stage or large empty room), individual stations (up to 3) will be set up and spaced at a minimum of 6’ apart.  The clinical work area is disinfected with an EPA registered intermediate level surface disinfectant before supplies needed for the day are removed from suitcases or backpack.  Supplies needed for the day are placed on a barrier protected clean table at least 6’ away from the dental chair.  The table is covered with a vinyl tablecloth. The suitcase is then placed under the clean table for storage.  A barrier protected dirty table is set up at least 6’ away from the barrier protected clean clinical supply table. The dirty table is used for the disposal of used PPE, use disposable clinical supplies, and used non-disposable clinical supplies which are placed in a biohazard labeled sharps container and placed under the dirty table Clinical Room Diagram:  See illustration below:

Note: If the child or escort has a temperature of 100.4 °F or greater they will be deferred to seek primary care evaluation and the appointment will be postponed. 4. If the child and escort has a temperature of less than 100.4 °F the dental assistant will escort the child to the treatment area where they will seat the child in the dental chair.  If appropriate, the person escorting the child will be seated in the waiting are with their mask on until the child has completed their treatment visit.  The waiting room seats will be spaced 6’ apart and disinfected with an EPA registered intermediate level surface disinfectant between seating.  6.1.[ADDRESS_443384]-protected Apple iPads with electronic dental records pre-populated with demographic information of all students with informed consent.  Student lists on the Apple iPads will be used to: collect students during the care delivery days; record clinical findings and care delivered; and generate take home forms (see below).  On the scheduled care days, we will provide a gentle toothbrush cleaning, oral hygiene instruction, a toothbrush and fluoridated toothpaste.  We will also carry out an examination and provide preventive care.   The examination will include a soft tissue inspection and an assessment of all primary and permanent teeth to determine the presence/ absence of decay (active or arrested), missing, filled, or sealed surfaces on all teeth.    6.1.7  Prevention   Both simple and complex care regimens provide both primary and secondary caries prevention.  The goal of primary prevention is to prevent or delay the initial carious lesion using: 1) fluoride varnish for smooth surfaces (simple and complex prevention); and 2) either silver diamine fluoride (simple prevention) or sealants (complex prevention) for pi[INVESTIGATOR_217109].  The goal of secondary prevention is to arrest caries in situ, and prevent disease progression.  This is accomplished with silver diamine fluoride (simple prevention) or interim therapeutic restorations (complex prevention).    6.1.8  Take Home Messages and Follow-on Care 
30  We will provide two take-home messages, one for parents, and one for school nurses. The parents’ message will identify the care provided to the child, note any additional care needed.  Parents of children without a dentist or children that require an urgent referral will be provided information on local dental providers in the following ways: [IP_ADDRESS] Children without a Dentist Parents/guardians of children without a dentist can access the CariedAway Website Dentist finder map and link (https://dental.nyu.edu/faculty/epi[INVESTIGATOR_623]-health-promotion/pcori-grant.html).

For the latter, we will follow each school’s protocol.  6.[ADDRESS_443385] of local dentists or community health centers for follow on care.    
31  6.3 Study Administration and Duration Examination and care will be provided based in the school, at a community-based location, or NYUCD schedule and allow for a 30-minute eating free time following our care.   Care is delivered in a school room (e.g.: an empty room or class room, auditorium stage, nurse office, etc.), at a community-based location, or at NYUCD using mobile dental equipment and disposable supplies.   The clinical treatment room set up will vary based on room size and ability to provide care at a safe distance. If the clinical room is small, only 1 station will be set up to provide care to 1 child at a time.  If the clinical room is large (eg: auditorium stage or large empty room), individual stations (up to 3) will be set up and spaced at a minimum of 6’ apart.  The room is set up prior to the beginning of treatment.  All clinical personnel will wear personal protective equipment consistent with CDC, DOH, FDA and NYU Dentistry guidelines.  NYUCD licensed dentists, dental hygienists, nurses, and/or advanced dental hygiene students supervised by [CONTACT_355873].  All clinical personnel providing care will wear PPE based on current NYU Dentistry guidelines.  PPE is listed below:  1. Disposable gowns 2. Disposable gloves 3. N95 respi[INVESTIGATOR_355851] a specific respi[INVESTIGATOR_355852] 4. Level 3 surgical masks 5. Goggles 6. Face Shields 7. Bonnets 8. Booties  Gloves are changed between patients.  All dental chairs, stools and touch surfaces are disinfected with an EPA registered intermediate level surface disinfectant at the beginning of each day, prior to and after treating patients, and at the end of the day.  Goggles and face shields are also disinfected between patients.  Care is delivered only during school, community-based location, or NYUCD hours.  Based on informed consents, children will be scheduled and seen in a school room, a community-based location room, or at NYUCD.  Children are escorted to the waiting room in the school by [CONTACT_52721]’s parent coordinator.  Children are brought by [CONTACT_7071]/guardian at a community-based setting or at NYUCD.  After the child and parent/guardian at the community-based location passes the COVID-[ADDRESS_443386], the child will be escorted to the clinical treatment room by [CONTACT_355891].  Care will be provided by [CONTACT_355892], dental hygienists, nurses, and/or advanced level dental hygiene students supervised by [CONTACT_355893].  After the child has completed treatment they will be required to put their mask back on and apply an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.  The dental assistant will bring the child to the waiting room area.  The child will be escorted back to the classroom by [CONTACT_52721]’s parent coordinator or back home by [CONTACT_7071]/guardian from the community-based, or NYUCD locations. 
[ADDRESS_443387] Applicators to all pi[INVESTIGATOR_355859], and to all posterior, asymptomatic carious lesions.  Fluoride varnish is then applied which also takes 1 minute to apply.    Complex prevention takes approximately 20 minutes and is aerosol.  It consists or a gentle toothbrush cleaning, oral hygiene instruction, an examination, delivery of glass ionomer sealants to all pi[INVESTIGATOR_355859], and to all asymptomatic carious lesions.  This takes about 5 minutes to provide care to ¼ of the mouth at a time.  Fluoride varnish is then applied which takes approximately 1 minute.   6.4 Control/Comparison Group and Confounding Factors Complex prevention is the “comparison” while simple prevention is the “intervention” group.  Both groups receive primary and secondary prevention and we expect both protocols to be similarly effective in reducing untreated caries.  We will include relevant confounders a priori in our analysis, including: gender, previous (or concurrent) dental treatment (identified as new or existing treated dentition at examination), age at examination, race/ethnicity, and any school-level indicators. As these data have a multilevel structure, we will additionally assess caries incidence and prevalence using multilevel mixed effects Poisson and logistic modeling (ML-MEM). We will examine the effects of comprehensive prevention at multiple levels (tooth, child, grade, and school). In this analysis, we will be able to explore the variation in clinical outcomes across child and school levels. For all GEE and multilevel models, we will conduct analysis for outcomes (caries prevalence and incidence) measured by [CONTACT_355894], all adult teeth only, and all deciduous teeth only.  6.[ADDRESS_443388] actual implementation, we will visit each team in the fall and spring of each year for a one-day site visit.  During the day, we will monitor adherence to protocol, particularly: student flow, caries diagnosis, and procedures delivered.   Quantitatively, we will use the elementary methods of statistical process control27,28. We will examine four domains: 1) informed consent rates; 2) caries prevalence (e.g.: diagnosis); 3) care provision; and 4) outcomes.  We will monitor these domains using electronic records and then verify with in-person site visits.  We will start with national averages and standard deviations for school-based informed consent rate (35%), untreated caries prevalence of (21.5%).  All children (100%) with permanent bicuspi[INVESTIGATOR_355860] (simple prevention) or traditional sealants (complex prevention) and fluoride varnish.  All children (100%) with caries on their posterior teeth should receive either silver diamine fluoride (simple prevention) or interim therapeutic restorations (complex prevention).    We will create histograms, Pareto charts, and control charts, at the school, grade, and clinician level to identify common cause and special cause variation. Control limits will be adjusted yearly based on prior year data. If a clinician, school or grade exhibits variation that is out of the control range we will use this audit to work with the clinical team and school to provide feedback. We will continue this process during the school year.   6.[ADDRESS_443389] of care (SOC) dental commodities obtained from Henry Schien and Elevate Oral Care.

[ADDRESS_443393] to enroll approximately 14,100 students across the initial 60 schools over the duration of the study (N=235 per cluster).  The remaining 16 schools will contribute approximately 3760 participants. From our pi[INVESTIGATOR_355862]-based caries prevention, baseline caries prevalence is approximately 40%. Our power estimates assume an equal proportion of success, p, of 20% caries arrest. With a given non-inferiority margin (d) of 10%, a total sample size per group of 198 (Ntot = 396) is required for an alpha of 5% and a power of 80%29 . However, as we use a cluster randomized design, this sample size is inflated to account for clustering (intraclass correlation coefficient = .10) by a design effect of 24.[ADDRESS_443394] been shown to be 80% efficacious in individual clinical trials. Power for the repeated measures design was estimated using the method of Diggle et al (2002) for generalized estimating equations 30. For power estimates, we control for the baseline prevalence of untreated decay. We assume a conservative average number of visits per child of 6, with a power of .80 and an alpha of 5%. We further assume a repeated measures correlation of 0.5 and a per-visit attrition rate of 20%. For a given minimally detectable effect size (standardized effect size difference) of .25, an attrition and clustering adjusted sample size of 12,[ADDRESS_443395] determine the per-patient proportion of carious lesions treated with simple versus complex prevention that stayed arrested throughout the length of the study. The percentage of arrested caries (at the child level) will be modeled using multilevel binomial regression. Our noninferiority margin, d, is set at 10%. Our null hypothesis is that simple prevention is not inferior to the complex prevention by [CONTACT_2669] d: psimple - pcomplex ³ d. Our alternative hypothesis is that psimple - pcomplex < d. We will use differences in effect sizes as estimated by [CONTACT_355895]-inferiority of the two prevention methods.  For the prevention of new caries, we will use generalized estimating equations (GEE) with a logit link (caries prevalence) and a negative binomial link (caries incidence), assuming an exchangeable correlation matrix, to evaluate longitudinal effects of comprehensive care untreated decay. We will identify the number of teeth at risk for each child during each follow-up interval and determine the number of those teeth in which new caries is observed at the examination that ends that interval. Primary teeth lost in each interval and new permanent teeth will not contribute to data for that interval.  To explore non-linear trends in untreated decay between simple and complex prevention, we will use generalized additive models (GAMs) with non-parametric smoothers.  Longitudinal effects of simple and complex prevention on academic outcomes, compared to untreated children, will be analyzed using propensity score-matching and multilevel modeling. First, we will estimate propensity scores for each participant at baseline, establishing the probability of treatment assignment conditional on observed covariates (e.g., prior academic performance). Propensity scores will be used to match treatment students to students not receiving treatment, considering multiple forms of matching 
[ADDRESS_443396] neighbor and caliper. Treated students and matched comparators will then be analyzed using multilevel mixed effects linear regression (for academic achievement) and Poisson regression (for school absences).  Longitudinal effects of simple and complex prevention on dental-related service use and costs among Medicaid participants, compared to children in non-participating schools, will be analyzed using difference-in-differences analysis and propensity score matching. The propensity score weighting will be used to match children in participating schools to children in non-participating schools to account for any selection impacting whether a child is at a school participating in the CariedAway programs. The propensity score weighting will be used to account for student-level and school-level characteristics impacting whether the student is at a school participating in the CariedAway programs.  We will then adapt a published Markov model in combination with threshold analysis to compare the simple and complex prevention programs relative to non-participating schools in net costs and quality-adjusted life-years to determine the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of all three options (simple prevention, complex prevention, no prevention).  7.[ADDRESS_443397] Population for Analysis For study outcomes, participants will be analyzed using intent to treat. All participants will be analyzed as randomized in the original randomization, regardless of whether or not they received an intervention.  For dental-related service use and costs, all [LOCATION_001] City elementary school-age children enrolled in Medicaid will be analyzed using intent-to-treat.  7.4 Interim Analysis There are no interim analyses in this study. 8 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING PLAN (DSMP) All protocol amendments, other than minor administrative changes will be submitted in a prospective manner to the NYU School of Medicine IRB for approval and PCORI for notification. 8.1 Informed Consent Each participating school will obtain consent in accordance with their local circumstances.  The eICF forms were created and are stored using the secure REDCap data management system provided by [CONTACT_355896]. The REDCap system is HIPAA compliant.   The study administrator uploads all of the informed consent PDF’s to NESS via the secure and password protected ShareFile link listed below:  • https://nedental.sharefile.com  NESS then uploads each student’s eICF to their electronic dental record in the iPad.  Only select study investigators will have access to the eICF data, which will be stored on REDCap. This includes the principal investigators, the clinical research coordinator, the study administrator, the clinical director, the IRB coordinator and NESS.   
[ADDRESS_443398] security and Data Monitoring plan outlined in this proposal will help reduce this potential risk. Monitoring will be carried out by [CONTACT_355897].  8.3 Implementation On a daily basis, performance sites will upload data to New England Survey Systems (NESS). On a weekly basis, NESS will upload data to the Biostatistics and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_131101] (BEDAC) formerly the [LOCATION_011] University Data Coordinating Center (DCC).  The BEDAC will maintain records for each performance site that includes patients seen and data. The BEDAC will provide weekly reports to the PIs, Program Director, and clinical research associate (CRA) for each performance site that includes the daily reports. These reports will be matched with the MOPs to ensure timely recruitment and data reporting. If results are out of expected range, the CRA will contact [CONTACT_355898] a plan to resolve the problem. Monthly, quarterly, and yearly reports will be generated by [CONTACT_355899]. The initial reports will include recruitment data, while subsequent reports will include recruitment, retention, and databases for analysis. 8.[ADDRESS_443399] by [CONTACT_473], study staff, and the sponsor(s) and their agents.    The study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information generated will be held in strict confidence.  No information concerning the study or the data will be released to any unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the sponsor.  All patient information will be stored on password protected tablet (Apple iPad) computers. The iPads are transported by [CONTACT_355900] a locked backpack to and from treatment locations.  The iPads are locked each night in a closet on the 8th floor at NYUCD.  Participant data is uploaded at the end of each day through a secure transmitting server at NESS. NESS verifies validity of data and erases data from the tablet (Apple iPad). The BEDAC and NESS have additional data security protocols in place for data fidelity and security. Finally, NESS provides de-identified data to the BEDAC and the BEDAC provides de-identified data to the analytic team. Data monitoring, quality assurance, and quality control will be performed by [CONTACT_355901], NESS, the BEDAC, and the NYU Institutional Review Board.    The study monitor or other authorized representatives of the sponsor may inspect all study documents and records required to be maintained by [CONTACT_093], including but not limited to clinical data for the study subjects.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_355863].  The Health Evaluation and Analytics Lab at [LOCATION_001] University’s Wagner School of Public Service and [LOCATION_001] University’s School of Medicine will act as a third-party to carry out the the linkage between the oral health outcomes data collected through CariedAway and [LOCATION_001] Medicaid claims, encounter, and eligibility data. The linkage will be carried out using the Medicaid billing IDs collected through the implementation of the CariedAway program and/or first 
[ADDRESS_443400] name, date of birth, gender and residential zip code of the student. The Health Evaluation and Analytics Lab (HEAL) will then remove all “facial” identifiers (IDs, addresses, etc.) from the data provided for analysis to construct a HIPAA-defined “limited data set”. We will exclude children from the analysis who did not consent to providing their oral health outcomes data and Medicaid claims data.   The Medicaid claims, encounter, and eligibility data (and any other data with personal identifiers) will be maintained on password-protected computers locked inside metal cabinets that would in turn be fastened to office infrastructure, inside locked offices in limited-access buildings. Additionally, the cage will be bolted down to the floor to prevent the physical removal of the hard drive and the data from the cage and from the office. These computers would not have any connection to the internet except briefly periodically to upgrade software.  All data backups would be maintained on password protected encrypted external hard drives stored in locked cabinets in locked offices.  These specifications are in accordance with the agreement between the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services, the NYU School of Medicine, and NYU Wagner for the release and analysis of the [LOCATION_001] Medicaid claims data. The PD/PI [INVESTIGATOR_355864]. No attempts will be made to identify patients in the data, and in the case where subgroup analysis leads to small sample sizes at risk of identification, data will be aggregated or the subgroup enlarged to prevent identification from occurring.    8.4.2  Confidentiality During Adverse Event (AE) Reporting AE reports and annual summaries will not include subject or group-identifiable material. Each report will only include the identification code.  8.5 Expected Risks There are no expected risks associated with the clinical interventions proposed in this study. The only risk would be a data breach. The only possibility for a data breach would be the loss or theft of the tablet computers (Apple iPads) used for data collection. However, data is typi[INVESTIGATOR_355865].  The iPads are transported by [CONTACT_355900] a locked backpack to and from treatment locations.  The iPads are locked each night in a closet on the 8th floor at NYUCD.    8.6 Adverse Event/ Unanticipated Problems 8.6.1 Definitions [IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event (AE) For the purposes of this study, we know of no adverse events related to the clinical interventions in the study. Adverse events would therefore include protocol violations and/or breaches of confidentiality. Breaches of confidentiality are unlikely given the above procedures in place. Protocol violations will be identified using audits and feedback of patient records to ensure protocols are being followed and any complaints from patients. Any instances of protocol violation or breach of confidentiality will be reported to the IRB and to PCORI.  
40  [IP_ADDRESS]  Unanticipated Problems (UP) Unanticipated problems will be recorded in the data collection system throughout the study.  [IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) A serious adverse event (SAE) is one that meets one or more of the following criteria:  • Results in death • Is life-threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred) • Results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] • Results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity • Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect   An important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 8.[ADDRESS_443401] all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after informed consent is obtained until 7 (for non-serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation.  At each study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit.  Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  8.8 Characteristics of an Adverse Event  8.8.1  Relationship to Study Intervention To assess relationship of an event to study intervention, the following guidelines are used: 1. Related (Possible, Probable, Definite) a. The event is known to occur with the study intervention. b. There is a temporal relationship between the intervention and event onset. c. The event abates when the intervention is discontinued. d. The event reappears upon a re-challenge with the intervention. 2. Not Related (Unlikely, Not Related) a. There is no temporal relationship between the intervention and event onset. 
41  b. An alternate etiology has been established.  8.8.2  Expectedness of SAEs The Study PIs will be responsible for determining whether an SAE is expected or unexpected.  An adverse event will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the intervention.  No SAEs are expected for clinical interventions in this study.  8.8.3  Severity of Event The following scale will be used to grade adverse events:  1. Mild: no intervention required; no impact on activities of daily living (ADL)  2. Moderate: minimal, local, or non-invasive intervention indicated; moderate impact on ADL  3. Severe: significant symptoms requiring invasive intervention; subject seeks medical attention, needs major assistance with ADL  8.9 Reporting Procedures  8.9.1  Reporting for Multi-Center Trials Not applicable.  8.9.2  Unanticipated Problem Reporting Incidents or events that meet the Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) criteria for unanticipated problems will result in completing an unanticipated problem report form. The following information will be reported when reporting an adverse event, or any other incident, experience, or outcome as an unanticipated problem to the IRB:  • Appropriate identifying information for the research protocol (title, investigator’s name, and the IRB project number); • A detailed description of the adverse event, incident, experience, or outcome;  • An explanation of the basis for determining that the adverse event, incident, experience, or outcome represents an unanticipated problem;  • A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or are proposed in response to the unanticipated problem. To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, unanticipated problems will be reported using the following timeline:    • Unanticipated problems that are serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB and PCORI within 7 days of the investigator becoming aware of the event.  
42  Any other unanticipated problem will be reported to the IRB and PCORI within 14 days of the investigator becoming aware of the problem.   8.9.3  Adverse Event Reporting of Non-IND Studies SAEs that are unanticipated, serious, and possibly related to the study intervention will be reported to the IRB and PCORI in accordance with requirements.    • Unexpected fatal or life-threatening AEs related to the intervention will be reported to the PCORI Project Manager within 3 days of the investigator becoming aware of the event.  Other serious and unexpected AEs related to the intervention will be reported within 7 days. • Anticipated or unrelated SAEs will be handled in a less urgent manner but will be reported to the IRB in accordance with their requirements and will be reported to PCORI on an annual basis.    • All other AEs documented during the course of the trial will be reported to PCORI on an annual basis by [CONTACT_355902]/DSMP summary which will be provided to PCORI.  We note that no clinical adverse events are expected.  8.9.4  Adverse Event Reporting of Investigation New Drug (IND) Studies Not applicable.  8.9.[ADDRESS_443402] (if applicable) Not applicable.  8.9.6  Reporting of Pregnancy Not applicable. 8.10 Halting Rules Given the 25-year history of the study PIs, we know of no safety issues that would prompt suspension of enrollment or the interventions. However, if we encounter serious, unexpected, and related AEs, the PIs, PCORI, and the IRB would confer to determine whether findings might trigger a safety review based on the number of overall SAEs, the occurrence frequency of the type of SAE, severe AEs/reactions, or increased frequency of events.  8.[ADDRESS_443403] data, with NESS to securely upload examination and clinical data to electronic dental records. Records will then be checked to verify successful transmission, and then erased from each Apple iPad. Transmitted data will include unique identifiers of study participants, demographic information, and examination and care data.   Congruence of unique identifier with demographics (for returning students), as well as in/out of range includes: date of birth with grade, presence/absence and number and type of teeth, increasing occurrence of permanent teeth and decreasing occurrence of primary teeth, and 
43  logic errors (e.g.: change from decay to sound).  Records with apparent errors will be set aside for hand check.  If errors cannot be rectified, a child’s data for a given visit will be excluded from the analysis.   If metrics are beyond established control limits, the CRA will contact [CONTACT_355903].  We will determine if there is special or to determine the cause and see if and how we can assist the performance site.    As indicated in the Research Plan, reports will be generated by [CONTACT_355904]-PIs and Patient and Stakeholder Partners.  8.[ADDRESS_443404] Accrual and Compliance NESS maintains records for each program, school, grade, and child.  NESS provides weekly reports to the CRA (who will share this with the Co-PIs) to assess accrual.  These reports will be matched with the manual of procedures for the performance sites to insure timely recruitment and data reporting.    As indicated in the Research Plan, reports will be generated by [CONTACT_355904]-PIs and Patient and Stakeholder Partners.   8.12.[ADDRESS_443405] Accrual NESS maintains records for each program, school, grade, and child.

Progress reports, including patient recruitment, retention/attrition, and AEs will be provided to the community stakeholder groups as listed in the study protocol. An Annual Report will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_45186] a list and summary of AEs.  In addition, the Annual Report will address (1) whether AE rates are consistent with pre-study assumptions; (2) reason for dropouts from the study; (3) whether all participants met entry criteria; (4) whether continuation of the study is justified on the basis that additional data are needed to accomplish the stated aims of the study; and (5) conditions whereby [CONTACT_72771].

This may be modified on an ad hoc basis depending on the impact of, and reaction to, COVID-19 by a school or community location.     a. One professional development (PD) meeting at least per semester: NYUCD CariedAway staff will set up a Zoom meeting with each schools PD to educate teachers and additional staff about the program and billing procedures. NYUCD CariedAway staff will go over the personalized pre-populated principal recruitment letter, the parent/guardian alternate location recruitment letter which explains billing procedures and informed consent form in detail, discuss the process for scheduling students at alternate community-based locations and instruct all staff on how to properly fill out the informed consent form, and answer any questions they may have. Teachers will receive personalized pre-populated principal recruitment letters, the parent/guardian alternate location recruitment 
47  letter, the NYU Langone Health COVID-19 research participation information sheet and blank informed consent forms to distribute to all of their students.  b. In-Class or Zoom Oral Health Education (OHE) Presentations at least once per semester: NYUCD CariedAway staff will provide in-class or Zoom OHE to each class at each school once per semester. This allows NYUCD CariedAway staff to engage with all teachers/staff as well as each student.  Additional personalized pre-populated principal recruitment letters, the parent/guardian alternate location recruitment letter, the NYU Langone Health COVID-[ADDRESS_443411] once per semester: NYUCD CariedAway staff will provide parent/guardian informational tabling during student arrival and students dismissal time. This allows parents to meet NYUCD CariedAway staff, learn about the program, review and receive the personalized pre-populated principal recruitment letter, explain billing procedures, receive the informed consent form, and ask any questions they may have.  d.

Removed: For the pri mary outcome measure, if a subject stops recording 
measurements permanently (anticipated to be zero or minimal in occurrence) prior 
to the end of the 17 -week DB phase, the corresponding median PBO data for the 
missing days will be imputed (irrespective of treatment arm) within each stratum, 
as follows:  
 Compute the median 28 -day seizure frequency in the PBO arm based on all 
available PBO measurements during the 17 -week DB treatment phase.  Label 
that ‘X’ and define ‘A’ to be ‘X’/28, (ie, the daily average on  PBO during the 
17-week during the DB phase).  
 For any days (whether they be on the PBO or GNX arm) that occur AFTER a 
subject has become lost to follow up, impute ‘A’ on that day.  
A conceptually similar imputation approach will be used will be used for the  
secondary outcome measures when a subject stops recording measurements 
permanently prior to the end of the 17 -week DB phase.  
Added: The primary analysis will use all available data. Careful educating 
and monitoring of the study sites will attempt to limit  the amount of missing 
data to nearly zero, but despi[INVESTIGATOR_120502], some missing data may still arise. 
Thus, a sensitivity analysis, in which the missing data will be 
replaced/imputed, will be performed on the primary efficacy endpoint.  Section [IP_ADDRESS]  
Removed: In order to explore the possibility that subjects who stop recording their 
seizure counts tend to have higher seizure counts than the other subjects, the 
imputation method described in the SAP will be modified to use the median of the [ADDRESS_1180799] counts, rather than the median count, among the PBO subjects with data.  
Added: Two sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint of change in 
28-day frequency of the primary seizure types will be performed:  
 
Intermittent (random/sporadic) missing data during the 17 -week DB phase 
and any missing data during the baseline phase will be assumed missing 
completely at random and the collected data will be used to calculate the 28 -
day seizure frequencies. For early drug termination prior to the end of the  17-
week DB phase, caregivers will be instructed to continue to provide daily 
seizure records until the end of the 17 -week DB phase (hence further 
preventing missingness).  
 
In the first sensitivity analysis, the following imputation approach will be used 
for the primary outcome measure when a subject stops recording 
measurements permanently (anticipated to be zero or minimal in occurrence) 
prior to the end of the 17 -week DB phase: for the missing days, the 
corresponding median PBO data will be imputed (irre spective of treatment 
arm), within each stratum, as follows:  
 Compute the median 28 -day seizure frequency in the PBO arm based on all 
available PBO measurements during the 17 -week DB treatment 
phase.   Label that ‘X’, and define ‘A’ to be ‘X’/28, (i.e., the daily average 
on placebo during the 17 -week during the DB phase).  
 For any days (whether they be on the PBO or GNX arm) that occur 
AFTER a subject has become lost to follow up, impute ‘A’ on that day.  
 The second sensitivity analysis will explore the possibi lity that subjects 
who stop recording their seizure counts tend to have higher seizure counts 
than the other subjects. The imputation method described above will be 
modified to use the median of the [ADDRESS_1180800] counts, rather than the median 
count, among the  PBO subjects with data.  Section 9.13.3

the dose of 18 mg/kg/day or 450 m g/day (or lower).  
Revised: Any subject who completes the study or discontinues IP treatment at any 
time during the study  should undergo a 2 -week drug de -escalation (taper) period.    Section [IP_ADDRESS]  
Revised : As a generally acc epted guideline, subjects should remain 80% 
compliant with diary entries.  Parents/caregivers who fall short of this standard  
will be re -educated on the importance of adhering to daily seizure, IP and non -
study AED recording and a deviation recorded . Sectio n 6.6  and 7.4.1

Revised: A drug screen (plasma) will be performed to test for THC and non -
approved CBD during the DB phase  at Visit 1 (screening) , Visit 2 
(baseline/randomization) , and Visit 5 (final DB/first OL vi sit).  If the screening 
drug test is positive at Visit 1 (screening) , a confirmatory retest, via plasma, will 
be performed after 2 weeks. A drug screen may be performed at any time at 
Investigator’s discretion.    Sections 7.3.2  
Revised: If the subject has  a de novo PCDH19  VUS then the central assessor, PI, 
and Sponsor will review study inclusion.  Some subjects may have multiple 
PCDH19 mutations that include both VUS and pathogenic variants.   In these 
cases, the subject is known to have a pathogenic varian t and is eligible (does 
not require discussion with expert).  Section 7.3.5  
Added: If any test result is unexpectedly out of range, a repeat test can be 
performed at any time as decided by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_849183].  Section 7.6.5  
Revised: Medication errors are reportable to the sponsor only as defined below.  
 Cases of subjects missing doses of the IP are not considered reportable

subject a ssent) , it is expected that all eDiary entries will be made daily  (removed: 
and no longer than 72 hours after each day) . 
Added: Retrospective entry of diary events (seizure and medication) can be 
completed by [CONTACT_849304] 5 days later and proxy entr y by [CONTACT_849305] (greater than 5 days), but neither method is 
encouraged.  Section 9.1

Added: No formal interim analysis is planned for this study. After all active 
subjects complete the17 -week double -blind phase, the double -blind data in 
the database will be locked and used to perform endpoint analysis. Data 
collected during the open label phase w ill be analyzed se parately.   
Removed:  As enrollment in the study was discontinued early due to 
administrative reasons, and only [ADDRESS_1180810] ical hypotheses. Since the reason for

Added: A total of 50 subjects (25 in each treatment group) w as planned to be 
enrolled in the study.  
 
Note: Protocol versions 5 and 6 were implemented after enrollment was stopped 
early due to administrative reasons. The fina l sample size is not based on 
statistical considerations. Formal hypothesis testing will be performed based on 
all available sample size at the time of the study discontinuation.  
 
Removed:  Based on data from the [ADDRESS_1180811] deviation could be meaningfully higher. If we assume 
the standar d deviation to be 40 and the percent change in 28 -day seizure frequency

positive PCDH19 patients randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_1180812] about 94% power 
to detect this effect when using a test statistic that preserves a (one -sided) 2.5% 
false positive error rate. The threshold for achieving statistical significance in the 
biomarker positive cohort at the final analysis when [ADDRESS_1180813] completed 
their 17 -week double -blind phase  would be an estimate of the difference that is 
55.5% of the standard deviation.  (If the standard deviation is 40, then the 
threshold for statistical significance is approximately ꟷ23%). The actual analysis 
will use a Wilcoxon rank -sum test, which has app roximately the same power as the 
analysis of variance (ANOVA).  
 
As enrollment in the study was discontinued early due to administrative reasons 
and only [ADDRESS_1180814] adequ ate power for formal testing of the statistical 
hypotheses. Since the reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_849185] a

analysis would be considered as nominal.  Section 9.5  
Added: The Randomized population comprises all subjects who are 
randomized to one of GNX or PBO treatment group.  
Revised: The Safety (Removed: and ITT) population  comprises all randomized 
subjects who received at least one dose of study drug. (Removed: In addition to

ITT analysis results are nominally statistically significant.  Hierarchically, if GNX 
efficacy is established in the biomarker -positive stratum, it s efficacy will then be 
assessed  in the biomarker -negative stratum.  To be positive, the difference between

Rationale : 
Protocadherinl9 (PCDH19 )-related epi[INVESTIGATOR_849192] a serious epi[INVESTIGATOR_849193]-on set cluster 
seizures , cogniti ve and senso1y impairment of varying degrees , and psychiatric and beha vioral distw-bance s 
affec ting primarily females (Camacho 2012 ). The condition is caused by [CONTACT_849308]19 
gene located on the X chromosome . This gene encodes for a calcium -dependent cell-cell adhe sion molecule that 
is expre ssed in the central nervous system (CNS ; eg, hippocampus , cerebral cortex , thalamu s, amygdala ) and 
which appear s to be related to synaptic transmission and fo1mation of synaptic connec tions dw-ing brain 
development (D epi[INVESTIGATOR_798355] 2009 ).

Protocol 1042 -PCDH19 -3002   20 January 2021 
The mean age of seizure onset in this condition is approximately 10 months (range of 3 -38 m onths) 
(Scheffer  2008 , Specchio 2011 , Dipi[INVESTIGATOR_798355] 2011 , Cappelletti 2015 , van Harssel 2013 ).  The mean age of offset of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_849194] 12.5 years (1 -35 years) .  PCDH19 -related epi[INVESTIGATOR_849195] a 
“semiprogressive” condition, meaning that seizure frequency increases during the first few years of life 
(Specchio  2011 ).  However, over time the seizure frequency lessens, and seizures become less frequent with 
increased age .   
There is also evidence supporting an allopregnanolone de ficiency as a proposed contributor to the onset of 
seizures in individuals with PCDH19 -related epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] ( Tan 2015 ).  It was found that individuals with this genetic 
mutation demonstrated a downregulation of steroid hormone -metabolizing enzymes resulting in  reduced 
allopregnanolone levels compared to non -affected, age -match ed controls .  Since th is neurosteroid is known to 
have strong anti -convulsant properties, it is hypothesized that treatment with neurosteroids with similar action, or 
analogs such as GNX, may have therapeutic benefit to seizure control.  
Ganaxolone is the 3β -methylated synthetic analog of allopregnanolone, an endogenous allosteric modulator of 
CNS γ-Aminobutyric acid type A ( GABA A) receptors .  Ganaxolone has potency and efficacy comparable t o 
allopregnanolone ( Carter 1997 ) in activating synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA A receptors at a site distinct from 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_59684] .  Ganaxolone has protective activity in diverse rodent seizure models  
(Reddy  2012, Bialer 2010 ).  Clinical studies have demonstrated that GNX has anticonvulsant activity with an 
acceptable safety and tolerability profile in the dose range of 900 to 1800 mg in adults and children 
(Sperling  2017 , Laxer 2000 , Kerrigan 2000 , Pi[INVESTIGATOR_553811] 2007 ).  Further, GNX reduces seizures in children with IS 
and refractory pediatric epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] .  In an OL study, pediatric subjects aged 2 to 60 months with refractory seizures 
and a history of IS were treated with GNX doses up to 36 mg/kg for up to 3 months ( Kerrigan 2000 ).  Sixteen of 
the 20 subjects completed treatment, 15 o f whom had a history of IS .  Five of the 15 subjects had a decrease from 
baseline in the number of spasms of ≥ 50%, 5 had a decrease of 25 to 50%, and 5 had a decrease of <  25%.  One 
subject became spasm -free and 1 non -responder (with a decrease of < 25%) was spasm -free from weeks [ADDRESS_1180831] signal of GNX in PCDH19 -related epi[INVESTIGATOR_849196] -dose exploratory study (Study 1042 -0900) of GNX in children (age range 2 -15 years) with rare genetic 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_31629] (including PCDH19) with uncontrolled seizures despi[INVESTIGATOR_849197] ( AED ) regimens 
(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier :   [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) .  Following the screening and baseline evaluations, consenting 
subjects enrolled into a 26 -week study du ring which investigators could dose GNX starting with a titration up to 
1,800 mg/day for subjects whose body weight was > 30 kg or up to 63 mg/kg /day for subjects whose body -
weight was <  30 kg .  The dose could also be reduced for tolerability reasons .  The primary efficacy measure was 
the percent change from baseline in the 28 -day seizure frequency count .  Safety and tolerability assessments were 
among the secondary objectives .  The median change in 28 -day seizure frequency from baseline in the intent -to-
treat (ITT) population (primary endpoint) was a decrease of 2 5% (n = 11) .   
The median change from baseline in seizure -free days in the ITT population (key secondary endpoint) was an 
increase of 14% (n  = 11).  Baseline levels of allopregnanolone sulfate (Al lo-S, an endogenous neurosteroid) and 
28-day seizure rates were also assessed .  A ganaxolone -responder was specified by [CONTACT_447] -hoc definition, as having 
at least a 25% reduction in 28 -day seizure rate .  In the PCDH19 cohort, responders (n = 6) and non -respon ders (n 
= 5) had plasma Allo -S concentrations (mean ± SD) of 501 ± 430 pg mL-1 and 9,829 ± 6,638 pg mL-1, 
respectively .  When performing a retrospective separation of the PCDH19 cohort according to their Allo -S level, 
the 7 subjects with Allo -S levels belo w 2,500 pg mL-1 (biomarker -positive) had a 50% reduction in seizure rates 
while the 4 subjects with Allo -S levels above 2,500 pg mL-1 (biomarker -negative) had a 84% increase (performed 
in the research lab of Dr .  Graziano Pi[INVESTIGATOR_849198] s, Chicago, the only laboratory during the 
conduct of the study that could reliably produce results for sulphated neurosteroids) .  The Clinical Global 
Impression Scale rated by [CONTACT_4718] (CGI -I) and Caregivers (CGI -P) has been consistent with seizure c ontrol .  
In the OL study (1042 -0900), there were 4 SAEs ( 3 related to seizures and 1 related to rash) possibly related to 
the study drug in the PCDH19 subjects .   
In addition to anticonvulsant activity, GNX has shown positive effects on anxiety, hyperactiv ity, and attention in 
children with fragile X syndrome ( Ligsay 2016 ).  Similar behavior problems occur in individuals with PCDH19  
mutations ( Smith 2018 ).  It is hypothesized that GNX treatment will increase and improve GABA A-mediated 
signaling by [CONTACT_849309], but also 
other behavioral abnormalities in individuals with the PCDH19 mutation .

Protocol 1042 -PCDH19 -3002   20 January 2021 
Methodology :    This is a global, biomarker -stratified, DB, randomized, PBO -controlled tr ial of adjunctive GNX 
treatment in children with a confirmed pathogenic or likely pathogenic PCDH19  mutation .  The trial consists of a 
12-week prospective baseline period to collect seizure data, followed by a 17 -week DB phase, which is then 
followed by a long-term OL phase .  An interactive web response system (IWRS) will be used to randomize 
subjects, dispense drug, track treatment, and maintain the blind throughout the duration of the study.  
A 12-week daily historical seizure calendar will be reviewed at the screening visit to determine eligibility per 
inclusion/exclusion criteria .  Acceptable historical seizure data must include at least 12 consecutive weeks prior 
to the Screening visit of  documenting seizure type and frequency (also noting seizure -free d ays). Procedures 
specific to this protocol and not otherwise considered standard of care, will not be performed until written 
informed consent from the subject’s parent or legally authorized representative (LAR) and subject assent has 
been appropriately ob tained .  In the event that parent/caregiver/LAR do not routinely maintain a daily seizure 
calendar  or genetic testing has not been performed  per standard of care, written informed consent will be obtained 
from the parent/LAR and subject assent, and the sub ject will be asked to return to the clinic for the screening visit 
after they have maintained a 12 week daily historical seizure calendar  and/or genetic testing has been completed .   
During the screening visit , each subject’s  biomarker level  will be assess ed via a blood draw and subsequent 
analytical quantification.  Each subject  will then be assigned to 1 of 2  groups: biomarker -positive or biomarker -
negative.  A subject  will be considered biomarker -positive if her baseline Allo -S level is less than or equa l to 
2500 pg/mL (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_849199]).  The biomarker group assignment will remain blinded until database 
unblinding after the study has completed.  Based on the completed 11-subject 1042 -0900 Phase 2a study , it is 
estimated that approximately 65% o f all subjects will be biomarker -positive . 
Subject rescreening is allowed as agreed by [CONTACT_849310] a general concern for subject  
safety or an inability for the subject to become eligible (eg, GNX allergy, sensitivity or exposur e, non -PCDH19 
and/or other ineligible epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], chronic prohibited medical condition or treatment) .  Subsequent screening should 
take place at least [ADDRESS_1180832]’s last visit.  
The DB phase includes [ADDRESS_1180833] titration f ollowed by 13 weeks of dose maintenance .  
After meeting the eligibility criteria, approximately 25 children aged 1 -17 years (inclusive) with PCDH19 -related 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_849200] (1:1 ratio within each biomarker stratum) f or [ADDRESS_1180834] anti -seizure treatment .  Participants will be titrated to 63 mg/kg/day (max 1800 
mg/day) over 4 weeks, and then maintained at that dose for another 13 weeks .  Subjects who are not able to 
tolerate 63  mg/kg/day (or 1800  mg/day maximum) may be maintained on a lower dose .  A minimum dose of 
33 mg/kg/day or 900 mg/day is generally required following the DB escalation period, unless a lower dose is 
agreed to with the sponsor  due to tolerability issues  such as somnolence .

Refere nce Therapy, Dose and Mode of A dmini stration: Placebo is to be admini stered as an oral suspension 
TID with food during the 4-week, titration period of the DB phase of the study. 
Placebo will only be used in the OL phase of the study during the 4-week blinded titration phase for those subjects 
who were original ly randomized to GNX in the 17-week DB phase. 
Durati on of treatmen t: Eligible subjects will collec t 12 weeks of prospective baseline seizure data. Subjec ts 
will be randomized (1: 1 within each biomarker stratum) to a 17-w eek DB phase with GNX or PBO ( 4 weeks 
titration and 13 weeks dose maintenance) , follo wed by a long-tenn OL treatment phase with GNX. Following 
the completion of the 17-week DB phase , subjec ts randomized to PBO will transition to GNX (using blinded 
titration ), while subjec ts randomized to GNX will stay on 63 mg/k g/day suspension (1800 mg/day maximum) , or 
their maximum tolera ted dose (MTD) and also recei ve a blinded titration of PBO. Subjec ts will begin the 4-week 
blinded dose tit ration to 63 mg/k g/day (1800 mg/day or MTD) after completing the final DB visit. The OL phase 
will continue until the sponsor tenninates the developmen t of the investigational product in PCDH19-related 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_849201]' respecti ve coun try. 
Participants who comp lete t he study or discontinue investigational produc t treatmen t before the end of the study 
will undergo a 2-week taper period , unless otherwise medically indica ted, after which she will return to the study 
site for a safety follow up visit. Subjects who discontinue investiga tional produc t treatment before the 
comp letion of the DB phase will continue to be followed per protocol and, at a minimum , subjects will be 
encouraged to maintain daily seizure eDiary entries until the DB phase is comp leted. 
Criteria for Evaluati on: 
Seizw ·es: All seizure types and frequency will be recorded daily in an eDiaiy. Days in which no seizures occur 
will also be noted . Subsets of seizw·e types will be defined below. 
Prim a1-y Endpoint (seizure control) 
The prima1y efficacy endpoin t is the percen t change in 28-day primary seizw·e frequency during the 17-week DB 
phase relative to the baseline. The primaiy seizure types are defined as countab le focal seizure s that include 
progres sive hypotonia and impaired awareness , or any countab le focal or generalized seizure with a clear motor 
component. Focal and genera lized nonmo tor seizure s and myoclonic seizw·e s do not coun t as the prima1y seizure 
types for the prima1y efficacy endpoin t. The analyses of the primary endpoint will be performed on the sum of the 
individual countab le seizure s and each series of continuou s uncoun table seizw·e s (each contributes 1 to the sum). 
Post-baseline 28-day seizure frequency will be calcula ted as the total number of seizure s in the 17-week DB 
treatmen t phase divided by [CONTACT_849314] , multiplied by 28. Baseline 28-day 
seizure frequency will be calculated as the total number of seizw·es in the baseline phase divided by [CONTACT_849315] , multip lied by 28. The difference bet\¥een the GNX and placebo groups in 
the percen t change s will be tested using the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum statistic. The prima1y analysis will be 
conduc ted in the ITT population. If nominal statistical significance is achieved in the ITT popula tion, the 
prima1y analys is will be conduc ted in the biomarker-positive stratum of the ITT popula tion as a secondary 
endpoin t. 
Seco nda1·y endpoints (seizure control ): 
• The percen t change in 28-day prima1y seizure frequency dw·ing the 17-w eek DB Phase relative to 
baseline in biomarker-po sitive subjec ts. 
• Percen tage of subjec ts experiencing a c::: 50% reduc tion in 28-day primary seizw·e frequency 
compared to the baseline 
Seco nda1·y endpoints (behavioral/neuropsychiatl ic): 
• Beha vior Rating Invento1y of Execu tive Func tion (BRIEF , preschool version BRIEF -P) 
• Abe1rnn t Beha vior Check -Community (ABC -C) 
• Children ' s Sleep Habit Questionnaire (CSHQ)

Statistical Methods: Marinus Pha1mac euticals Inc. 
20 January 2021 
The primaiy efficacy endpoin t (seizure control) is the percent change in 28-day primaiy seizure frequ ency dw-ing 
the 17-week DB phase relati ve to the baseline, based on all countab le focal seizures that include progres sive 
hypo tonia and impair ed awareness, or any countab le focal or generalized seizw-e with a clear motor component . 
The analyses of the primaty endpoint will be performed on the sum of the individual countable seizures and each 
series of continuous uncoun table seizw-es (each contribu tes 1 to the sum). Post-baseline 28-day seizure frequency 
will be calculated as the total number of seizures in the 17-week DB treatment phase divided by [CONTACT_849316]·e data in the phase, multip lied by 28. Baseline 28-day seizure frequency will be calculated as the 
total number of seizure s in the baseline phase divided by [CONTACT_849314], 
multiplied by 28. 
The prima1y analysis will be conducted in the ITT Popula tion. 
All secondary efficacy endpoints will compare GNX and PBO during the 17-week DB treatment phase relative to 
the prospective baseline phase. 
The percentage s of seizure -free days will be based on the primaiy seizure types. 
BRIEF (BRIEF -P where appropriate) will be assessed as follows: in the DB phase at Visit 2 
(baseline /randotnization ) and Visit 5 (Week 17; also Final DB Visit/First OL Visit in open label phase ); in the OL 
phase at Visit 7 (Week 36) and Visit 9 (Week 68) and thereafter eve1y 16 weeks for the duration of this phase ; 
and at the Final OL Visit. 
The ABC-C will be assessed as follows : in the DB phase at Visit 2 (baseline /randotniza tion) and Visit 5 (Week 
17; also Final DB Visit/First OL Visit in open label phase ); in the OL phase at Visit 7 (Week 36) and Visit 9 
(Week 68) and thereafter eve1y 16 weeks for the duration of this phase; and at the Final OL Visit.

With few exceptions , all of the analyses for the DB phase  will be repeated for the OL phase  with the following 
differences . 
Safety Analysis :    
All saf ety analyses will be performed in the Safety Population .  The results in the DB and OL phases will be 
summarized separately .  Adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_59724], system organ class, and Preferred Term 
using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Ac tivities (MedDRA) coding system .  Incidence and percentage of 
AEs will be presented .  Additional tables, with AEs classified by [CONTACT_849317] [INVESTIGATOR_462034] .  Subset listings will be produced for AEs th at cause withdrawal and for 
SAEs .  Clinical laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry and urinalysis), vital signs and ECGs will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics including changes from baseline .  Physical, neurological and developmental 
examination s will be summarized using number and percentage of subjects with abnormalities.  
Pharmacokinetic Analysis :   A population PK approach addressing the relationship between GNX PK 
parameters and individual characteristics will be implemented during the study .  One blood sample will be 
obtained at the following visits for PK analyses:  
 During the DB Phase:  
- Visit 3 (Week 5) :  between [ADDRESS_1180848] dosing  
- Visit 4 (Week 9) :  between [ADDRESS_1180849] dosing  
 During the OL Phase:  
- Visit 6 (Week 21) : between [ADDRESS_1180850] dosing  
- Visit 8 (Week 52 ): between [ADDRESS_1180851] dosing  
For all other PK draws, there is no specifi ed time to draw the PK sample and can be drawn when convenient during 
the study visits  for Visit 5 (Week 17), Visit 7 (Week 36), Visit 9 (Week 68), and every [ADDRESS_1180852] time of sample withdrawal and drug intake  will be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF) .   
Neurosteroid serum and Concomitant AED levels :   Blood samples will be drawn at screening visit, Week 17, 
and the final OL visit to measure neurosteroid levels allopregnanolone and related end ogenous CNS -active 
steroids and sulfate metabolites .  Concomitant AED levels will not be mandatory but will be conducted per sites’ 
standard of care .  If AED levels are available, the results, date and time of last AED dose and date and time of 
AED PK samp le will be recorded in the eCRF.  
Interim Analysis:  No formal interim analysis is planned for this study.  After all active subject s complete the 17-
week double -blind phase , the double -blind data in the database will be locked  and used to perform endpoint 
analysis.  Data collected during the open label phase  will be analyzed separately.   
Data Monitoring Committee :   The emerging study data will be reviewed on a regular basis by [CONTACT_204778] (DMC) .  The mission of the DMC will be to  safeguard the interests of study 
participants and to enhance the integrity and credibility of the trial .  To enable the DMC to achieve their mission, 
the DMC will have ongoing access to efficacy and safety data and data regarding quality of trial conduct and will 
ensure the confidentiality of these data will be preserved .  A DMC Charter will provide the principles and 
guidelines for the DMC process .

parent/LAR and subject assent, and the subject will be asked to return to the clinic for the screening visit after she has ma intained a 12-week daily historical seizure calendar.  
d. Review of medical history only .   
e. Genetic testing to be perfo rmed to confirm pathogenic or likely pathogenic PCDH19  variant.  If genetic testing is not performed  as Standard of Care, a pre -baseline screen ing 
visit will be scheduled  to obtain  informed consent/assent and complete  the genetic testing. If genetic testing  results are available per SOC, the genetic testing will be done at 
screening to confirm the results by [CONTACT_849291].  
f. In addition, height and weight will be measured.  
g. In addition, weight will be measured.  At each visit, dosing will be review ed and adjusted as needed based on a subject’s current weight.  
h. Chemistry & Hematology .   
i. An attempt should be made to collect a urine sample for a urinalysis at screening ; otherwise, the urine sample can be collected at baseline for the urinalysis.  
j. A drug  screen (plasma ) will be performed to test for THC and CBD at screening . If the screening drug test is positive, the subject can be retested , via plasma , after two weeks .  
A drug screen may be performed at any time at Investigator’s discretion.   A positive  drug test during the DB phase will result in early termination.  
k. Serum pregnancy test is required for all girls/women of childbearing potential.   
l. Population PK will be conducted at these visits (Visit 3 :  between [ADDRESS_1180855] IP dosing, Visit 4 :  between [ADDRESS_1180856] dosing) .   
m. Concomitant AEDs must be stable for [ADDRESS_1180857] ing of seizures in the eDiary, seizure events will be recorded either as a countable seizure or a  series of continuous  uncountable seizures .  Both of these events will 
be counted as 1 seizure (equally weighted ) in the efficacy analysis .  A seizure cluster will be defined as 3 or more seizure events (either a countable or a  series  of continuous 
uncountable seizures), occurring within a period of time, followed by a period of at least 24 hours of seizure -freedom.  
Examples: ( Figure 2): 
 If a child experiences 3 seizure eve nts at 5:00, 5:30, and 6:00 PM on Monday, and the next seizure event occurs before 6:00 P M on Tuesday, the Monday and Tuesday 
seizure events are considered part o f the same seizure cluster ( Figure 2, Scenario 1) .   
 If a child experiences 3 seizure events at 5:00, 5:30, and 6:00 PM on Monday, and the next seizure event occurs at 6:00 PM or  later on Tuesday, the Tuesday seizure 
event is not considered part of the s ame cluster ( Figure 2, Scenario 2) . 
o. Caregiver given eDiary and instructions for use.  
p. During the screening visit, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_849203]/caregiver/LAR will decide on a domain and identify the spec ific behavior that the subject  exhibits that denotes 
the domain.  This behavior will be used at subsequent visits to assess change after the initiation of investigational product . 
q. Subjects  who discontinue investigational product early will be  encouraged to  continue with all procedures and scheduled visits.  
r. The 12 weeks between Screening and Randomization can be no less than 84 days and no more than 90 days.

1. BACKGROUND INFORMATION 
1.1. Indication and Current Treatment Options 
Pediatric patients with rare epi[INVESTIGATOR_849204], such as protocadherin 19 (PCDH19)-related 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], cyclin-dependent kinase-like
 5 (CDKL5) Disorder (CDD), Dravet Syndrome, as well as 
many other refractory genetic epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] c
onditions that may share common seizure types and 
often their seizures, become treatment-resistant.  These
 seizure disorders may overlap idiopathic 
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or other genetica
lly-based conditions with intractable epi[INVESTIGATOR_849205].  This population has been at times, treated with, and responsive to, 
classes of corticosteroids like prednisone or adrenocorticotropic hormone.  
Other epi[INVESTIGATOR_849206], such as continuous spi[INVESTIGATOR_849207] (CSWS) or 
electrical status epi[INVESTIGATOR_41755], may also re
spond to corticosteroid medications, and be 
refractive to standard antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_125796].  The mechanism by
 [CONTACT_849318][INVESTIGATOR_798331].  No sin
gle anticonvulsant has 
been found to be uniformly effective, and often multiple antic
onvulsants are needed; even then, 
patients still become treatment-resistant. 
The nee
d for novel treatments to address seizure control is critical for pediatric patients living 
with these conditions.  This study will assess the efficacy and s
afety of ganaxolone as an 
experimental drug with a new and distinct mechanism of acti
on. 
Ganaxolone (GNX) is the 3β -methylated synthetic a
nalog of allopregnanolone, an endogenous 
allosteric modulator of γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A) re
ceptors in the central nervous 
system (CNS).  Ganaxolone has potency and effica
cy comparable to allopregnanolone in 
activating synaptic and extrasynaptic
 GABA A receptors at a site distinct from the benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_849208].  Ganaxolone has protective activity in diverse rodent seizure models (Bialer 2010, 
Reddy 2012).  
Clinical studies have demonstrated that GNX has anticonvuls
ant efficac
y with an acceptable 
safety and tolerability profile in the dose range of 900 to 1800 m
g in adults and children 
(Sperling 2017, Laxer 2000, Kerrigan 2000, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_553811] 2007).  The present study will investigate 
whether GNX 
provides efficacy for children with uncontrolled se
izures and PCDH19-related 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_849209]. 
Protocadherin 19- female-pediatric epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], also known as PCDH19 female-limited epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], or 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_798332] (hereon referred to as PCDH19-related epi[INVESTIGATOR_002])
, is a 
serious epi[INVESTIGATOR_798333]-onset cluster seizures, cognitive and sensory 
impairment of varying degrees, and psychiatric and behavioral disturbances in some individuals 
(Camacho 2012, Depi[INVESTIGATOR_798355] 2014).   
PCDH19-related epi[INVESTIGATOR_849210] a mutation of the P
CDH19 gene, the gene that 
encodes for protoca
dherin19 on the X chromosome (Depi[INVESTIGATOR_798355] 2014a, Dibbens 2008).  The 
mechanism by [CONTACT_849319] e
pi[INVESTIGATOR_849211].  Protocadherin is, however, a transmembrane protein of 
calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecules that i
s strongly expressed in neural tissue (eg, 
hippocampus, cerebral cortex, thalamus, and amygdale) and which appears to be related to 
synaptic transmission and formation of synaptic connec
tions during brain development

Protocol 1042 -PCDH19 -3002   20 January  2021 
(Depi[INVESTIGATOR_798355] 2009 ).  Research suggests that impairment of γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic 
signaling both at the agonist and receptor le
vels is present in girls with PCDH19 mutations and 
pediatric-onset epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] (Tan 2015). 
The hallmark characteristics of PCDH19-related epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] a
re clusters of seizures which start in 
infancy or early childhood that are often associated with fever or immunization (Depi[INVESTIGATOR_798355] 2012, 
Higurashi 2013, Marini 2010).  Patients with PCDH19-related epi[INVESTIGATOR_849212].  In some patients, seizures 
improve as patients reach puberty, possibly due to increased endogenous levels of progesterone 
and allopregnanolone (Camacho 2012, Specchio 2011, Scheffer 2008). 
The mean a
ge of onset of PCDH19-
related epi[INVESTIGATOR_849213]
 10 months (range of 3-38 
months) (Scheffer 2008, Specchio 2011, Dipi[INVESTIGATOR_798355] 2011, Cappelletti 2015, van Harssel 2013).  
The mean age of of
fset of epi[INVESTIGATOR_849194] 12.5 years (1
-35 years).  PCDH19-
related epi[INVESTIGATOR_849195] a “semiprogressive” con
dition, meaning that seizure 
frequency increases during the first few years of life (Specchio 2011); however, the seizure 
frequency decreases, and seizures become less frequent with increased age.   
There is also evidence supporting an allopregnanolone deficiency as a proposed contributor to 
the onset of se
izures in individuals with PCDH19-related epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] (Tan 2015).  It was found that 
individuals with this genetic mutation demonstrated a downregulation of steroid hormone-
metaboli
zing enzymes, r
esulting in reduced allopregnanolone levels compared to non-affected, 
age-match ed controls.  Since th is neurosteroid is known to have strong anti-convulsant 
properties, it is hypothesized that tre
atment with neurosteroids with similar action, or analogs 
such as GNX, ma
y have therapeutic benefit to seizure control. 
1.2. Product Background and Clinical Information 
Ganaxolone is the 3β-methylated synthetic analogue of the neuroactive steroid allopregnanolone, 
but it is designed to not activate nuclear (classical) progesterone receptors.  Ganaxolone differs 
from other GABA agents by [CONTACT_408789]-synaptic GABA A receptors 
and at binding sites distinct from benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651].  Whereas benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_849214]
y action, GNX does not because it selectively binds to GABA A rec
eptors containing the 
α and δ subunits.  By [CONTACT_506938] A receptor function, GNX provides an alternative 
mechanism in the treatment of seizures, and could serve as 
effective therapy in the management 
of benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]-resistant seizure conditions, such as CDD.   
The anticonvulsant activity of G
NX was established in several in vivo  models of seizure activity.  
Ganaxolone was effective at behaviorally non-toxic doses in rodent models of seizures indu
ced 
by [CONTACT_849320], bicucilline, aminophylline, strychnine, and 
t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate and antagonized 4-AP lethality in mice.  Ganaxolone blocked 
tonic seizures induced by [CONTACT_849321], but only at doses that produced 
ataxia on the rotarod test.  Ganaxolone was a potent anticonvulsant against fully-kindled Stage-5 
seizures induced by [CONTACT_59728].  
Seizure threshold, as determined by [CONTACT_59729]-infused pentylenetetrazol required 
to induce clonus, was significantly elevated by [CONTACT_105]-toxic doses of GNX in the mouse.  These 
results indicate that GNX  blocks seizure propagation and elevates seizure threshold ( Carter 199 7, 
Kaminski 2004 , Reddy 2004 ). 
 
Confidential Page [ADDRESS_1180864] received treatment with GNX in completed 
company
-sponsored clinical trials ranging in duration from 1 day to more than 2 years, using 
doses from 50 to 2,000 mg/day. In addition, 30 subjects received GNX in an ongoing open-label 
Phase 2 stud
y, and an estimated 65 subjects received GNX in ongoing Phase 2/[ADDRESS_1180865] received GNX treatment in Phase 2/3 studies. The completed 
tria
ls include 20 Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects and 20 Phase 2/[ADDRESS_1180866] enrolled over 200 
unique subjects :  
 Study 1042-0900 in pediatric epi[INVESTIGATOR_849215]19 epi[INVESTIGATOR_849216]5 deficiency 
disorder, LGS and continuous spi[INVESTIGATOR_849174] (CSWS )

 Study 1042- [COMPANY_003]-2002 in women with [COMPANY_003] (GNX IV and oral capsule multiple-dose 
escalation double-blind study)  
 Study 1042- [COMPANY_003]-2003 in women with [COMPANY_003] (GNX oral capsule multi-dose escalation 
open label study) 
For these 4 ongoing clinical studies, enrollment is complete for Study 1042-0900, 1042- [COMPANY_003]-
2002 and 1042- [COMPANY_003]-2003 and is ongoing fo
r Stud y 1042- SE-2001. 
In addition to the company-sponsored studies, 29 subjects were treated with GNX in completed 
studies not sponsored by [CONTACT_59730].  These included 16 subjects who received oral GNX doses 
from 400 mg/day to 1200 mg/day in a smoking cessation study and [ADDRESS_1180867] received oral GNX up to 
63 mg/kg/day under a special access scheme in Australia for treatment of refractory seizures 
associated with PCDH19 genetic epi[INVESTIGATOR_002].  In addition, two pediatric subjects received GNX in 
separate emergency INDs to treat super-refractory status epi[INVESTIGATOR_7397]: [ADDRESS_1180868] received IV GNX 
up to a dose of 2880 mg/day and [ADDRESS_1180869] received IV GNX infusion up to a dose of 192 mg/day 
and transitioned to a GN
X oral suspension dose of 1260 mg/day that was tapered over 6 weeks. 
[SAE Section 5.6 IB] 
Furthermore, 3 non-company-sponsored clinical studies are ongoing. In these studies, a total of 
7 subjects continue to receive treatment with GNX through investigator-initiated INDs following 
participation in Marinus
-sponsored studies as follows :  
 In one study, 3 subjects received GNX following participation in Study 1042-0603 of 
adult subje
cts with drug-resistant partial-onset seizures. 
 In one study, 3 subjects ([ADDRESS_1180870] with LGS) 
receiv
ed GNX following participation in Study 1042-0900.

 In another study, [ADDRESS_1180871] with CDD received GNX following participation in 
Study 1042-0900 
The overall
 frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE) in company-sponsored 
placebo (PBO)-controlled studies was 61.7% (613/993 subjects) in subjects who received GNX 
and 51.8% (330/637 subj
ects) in subjects who received PBO.  The most frequently reported 
TEAEs in GNX-tre
ated subjects were somnolence, dizziness, fatigue, and headache.  All of these 
events, except for headache, occurred more frequently in GNX-treated subjects than PBO-treated 
subjects.  Central nervous system-related even ts appeared to be dose-related, with the majority of 
these events occurring at doses ≥ [ADDRESS_1180872] been noted for 
electrocardiogram (ECG) intervals, vital signs, physical or neurologic examinations, or mean 
changes from baseline in clinical laboratory results.  Overall, there have been a few clinically 
significant individual changes from baseline in clinical laboratory measurements in clinical trials 
of GNX.  In the completed PBO-controlled Phase 1, 2, and 3 studies, 0.3% of subjects treated 
with GNX and 0.5% of subjects treated with PBO exhibited elevated liver function tests during 
the study (aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase > 3 × the upper limit of normal 
[ULN]).  The
re have been no cases of Hy’s law considered to be related to GNX  in the GNX 
developme
nt program. 
In controlled clinical trials of GNX, 1.1% of subjects receiving PBO and 1.7% of subjects 
receiving GNX re
ported an adverse event ( AE) of rash suggesting there is no obvious imbalance 
between drug
 and PBO in terms of frequency of this AE.  However, in PBO-controlled studies, 
rash led to discontinuati
on in GNX-treated subjects in 6 cases (0.6%) compared to no cases (0%) 
in PBO-treated subjects.   One of the events was also reported as an SAE and the event resolved 
after discontinua
tion of the study drug. In addition, in the ongoing study 1042-0900, an 
additional event of rash was reported as an SAE. There have been no cases of Stevens-Johnson 
syndrome, toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_849217]. Marinus considers rash as a potential risk associated with GNX 
and continues to monitor the occurrence of this AE in the clinical development program. 
Pediatric Safety 
Marinus has completed 2 double-blind (DB), randomized trials and 5 open-label ( OL), 
uncontrolled clinical trials of GNX in the pediatric population.  One additional pediatric trial, OL 
S
tudy 1042-0900 in children with various genetic epi[INVESTIGATOR_849218], is ongoing.  This study 
has enrolled 30 subjects of which 7 are subjects with the CDKL5 mutation.   
Approximately 224 pediatric subjects aged 4 months to 17 years (data cutoff October 10, 2017) 
have rece
ived at least [ADDRESS_1180873] cohorts received 12 to 54 mg/kg/day, 
although some subjects received doses as high as 63 mg/kg/day or 1800 mg/day for adolescents.  
As of October 10, 2017, 4 subjects were treated ≥ 4 years, 9 subjects were treated ≥ 2 years, 
39 subjects were treated ≥ 1 year, and 66 subjects were treated ≥ 6 months. 
The major
ity of the pediatric subjects were refractory epi[INVESTIGATOR_849219] (AEDs) (range 1- 8).  Overall, GNX was

generally safe and well tolerated.  In the incomplete crossover Study 1042-0500 (N = 56; all 
subjects received GNX during the trial), 39 subjects with infantile spasms ( IS) treated w ith GNX 
doses up to 54 mg/kg/day for up to [ADDRESS_1180874] frequently 
reported AEs (≥
 8% of subjects) were vomiting (7 subjects), somnolence (5 subjects), and cough 
(5 subjects).  Most AEs 
were mild or moderate; [ADDRESS_1180875] frequent AEs noted were 
vomiting (11% in bot
h GNX and PBO groups) and cough (8% GNX, 5% PBO).  Other AEs 
attributed to GNX included flatulence, insomnia, irritability, lethargy, and somnolence.  Adverse 
events reporte
d in the other uncontrolled refractory pediatric epi[INVESTIGATOR_849220].   
In another randomized, DB, PBO-controlled study of 59 subjects (aged 5-17 years) with fragile 
X syndrome who w
ere treated with GNX up to 36 mg/kg/day (maximum 1800 mg/day) or PBO, 
the percentag

2. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE 
2.1. Rationale for the Study 
Protocadherin19 (PCDH19)-related epi[INVESTIGATOR_24571] a serious epi[INVESTIGATOR_849222]-onset cluster seizures, cognitive and sensory impairment of varying degrees, and 
psychiatric and behavioral disturbances affecting primarily females (Camacho 2012).  The 
condition is ca
used by [CONTACT_849308]19 gene located on the X chromosome.  
This gene encodes for a calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion molecule that is expressed in the 
CNS (hippocampus, cerebral cortex, thalamus, amygdala) and which appears to be related to 
synaptic transmission and formation of synaptic connections during brain development 
(Depi[INVESTIGATOR_798355] 2009 ). 
The mean age of seizure onset in this condition is approximately 10 months (range of 
3-38 months) (Scheffer IE 2008, Specchio N 2011, Dipi[INVESTIGATOR_798355] 2011, Cappelletti 2015, 
van Harssel
 2013).  The mean age of offset of epi[INVESTIGATOR_849194] 12.5 years 
(1-35 years).  PCDH19-related epi[INVESTIGATOR_849223] a
s a “semiprogressive” condition, 
meaning that seizure frequency increases during the first few years of life
 (Specchio 2011).  
However, over time the seizure frequency decreases, and seizures become less frequent with 
increased age.   
There is also evidence supporting an allopregnanolone deficien
cy as a proposed contributor to 
the onset of seizures in individuals with PCDH19-related epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] (Tan 2015).  It was found that 
individuals with this genetic mutation demonstrated a downregulation of steroid hormone-
metabolizing enzymes resulting in reduced allopregnanolone levels compared to non-affected, 
age-match ed controls.  Since th is neurosteroid is known to have strong anti-convulsant 
properties, it is hypothesized that treatment with neurosteroids with similar action, or analogs 
such as GN
X, may have therapeutic benefit to seizure control. 
Ganaxolone is the 3β-methylated synthetic analog of allopregnanolone, an endogenous allosteric 
modulator of CNS GABA A receptors.  Ganaxolone has potency and efficacy comparable to 
allopregnanolone (Carter 1997 ) in activating synaptic and extrasyn
aptic GABA A receptors at a 
site distinct from benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_59684].  Ganaxolone has protective a
ctivity in 
diverse rodent seizure models (Reddy 2012, Bialer 2010 ).  Clinical studies have demonstrated 
that GNX ha
s anticonvulsant activity with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in the dose 
range of 900 to 1800 mg in adults and children ( Sperling 2017 , Laxer 2000 , Kerrigan 2000 , 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_553811] 2007 ).  F
urther, GNX reduces seizures in children with IS and refractor
y pediatric 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_002].  In an OL  study, pediatric subjects aged 2 to 60 months with refractory seizures and a 
history of 
IS were treated with GNX doses up to 36 mg/kg for up to 3 months ( Kerrigan 2000 ).  
S
ixteen of the 20 subjects completed treatment, 15 of whom had a history of IS.  Five of the 15 
subjects had a decrease from baseline in the number of spasms of ≥ 50%, 5 had a decrease of 25 
to 50%, and 5 had a decrease of < 25%.  One subject became spasm-free and 1 non-responder 
(with a decrease of < 25%) was spasm-free from weeks [ADDRESS_1180877] signal of GNX in PCDH19-related e
pi[INVESTIGATOR_849224]-dose exploratory study (Study 1042-0900) of GNX in children (age 
range 2-15 years) with rare genetic epi[INVESTIGATOR_31629] (including P
CDH19) with uncontrolled seizures 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_849225] (Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]).  Following the

Protocol 1042 -PCDH19 -3002   20 January  2021 
screening and baseline evaluations, consenting subjects enrolled into a 26-week study during 
which investigators could dose GNX starting with a titration up to 1,800 mg/day for subjects 
whose body weight was > 30 kg or up to 63 mg/kg /day for subjects whose body-weight was 
< 30 kg.  The dose could also be reduced for tolerability reasons.  The primary efficacy measure 
was the percent change from baseli
ne in the 28-day seizure frequency count.  Safety and 
tolerability assessments were among th
e secondary objectives.  The median change in 28-day 
seizure frequency from baseline
 in the intent- to-treat (ITT) population (primary endpoint) was a 
decrease of 25% (n = 11).   
The median change from baseline in seiz
ure-free days in the ITT population (key secondary 
endpoint) was an increase of 14% (n = 11).  Baseline levels of allopregnanolone sulfate (Allo-S, 
an endogenous neurosteroid) and 28-day
 seizure rates were also assessed.  A ganaxolone-
responder was specified by [CONTACT_447]-hoc d
efinition, as having at least a 25% reduction in 28 -day 
seizure rate.  In the PCDH19 cohort, responders (n = 6) and non-responders (n = 5) ha d plasma 
Allo-S concentrations (mean ± S
D) of 501 ± 430 pg mL-1 and 9,829 ± 6,638 pg mL-1, 
respectively.  When performing a
 retrospective separation of the PCDH19 cohort ac cording to 
their Allo- S level, the 7 subjects with Allo-S levels below 2,500 pg
 mL-1 (biomarke r-positive) 
had a 50%
 reduction in seizure rates whil
e the 4 subjects with Allo-S levels above 2,500 p g mL-1 
(biomarker-negative) had a 84%
 increase (performed in the research lab of [CONTACT_849360] ziano Pi[INVESTIGATOR_849226], Chicago, the onl
y laboratory during the conduct of the stud y that 
could reliably produce results for sulphated neurosteroids).  The Clinical Global Impr ession 
Scale rated by [CONTACT_849322] (CGI-I) and Caregivers (CGI-P) has been consistent wit h seizure 
control.  In the OL study (1042-0900), there were 4 SAEs (3 related to seizures and 1 related to 
rash) possibly related to the study drug in the
 PCDH19 subjects.   
In addition to anticonvulsant activity
, GNX has shown positive effects on anxiety, h yperactivity, 
and attention in children with fragile X syndrome (Ligsay 2016).  Similar behavior pr oblems 
occur in individuals with PCDH19 mutations (Smi
th 2018 ). 
It is hypothesized that GNX treatment will i
ncrease and improve GABA A-mediated sig naling by 
[CONTACT_849323] c ontrol, but 
also other behavioral abnormalities in individuals with the PCDH19 mutation.

followed by a 17-week DB treatment phase, which
 is then followed by a long-term OL phase 
(Figure 1 ).  An interactive web response sy
stem (IWRS) will be used to randomize subjects, 
dispense drug, track treatment, and maintain the blind throughout the durati
on of the study 
(Section 6.2.1).  
A 12-week daily historical seizure calenda
r will be reviewed at the screening visit to determine 
eligibility per inclusion/exclusion criteria
 (Section 4). Acceptable historical seizure data must 
include at lea
st 12 consecutive weeks prior to the Screening visit of documenting seizure type 
and frequency (also noting seizure-
free days). If genetic testing is not performed as Standard of 
Care, a pre-baseline scree
ning visit will be scheduled to obtain informed consent/assent and 
complete the genetic testing. I
f genetic testing results are available from SOC, the genetic testing 
will be done at screening to confirm the results by [CONTACT_849324]. Genetic testing is 
to be performed to confirm pathogenic or likely pathog
enic PCDH19  variant.   Procedures 
specific to this protocol and not otherwise considered standard o
f care will not be performed 
until written informed consent from the subject’s parent or legally authorized representative 
(LAR) and subject assent has been appropriately obtained.  In the event that 
parent/caregiver/LAR do es not routinely maintain a daily seizure calendar or have genetic testing 
results per standard of care, written informed c
onsent will be obtained from the parent/LAR and 
subject assent. The subject will be asked to return to t
he clinic for the screening visit after she 
has maintained a 12-week daily historical seizure
 calendar.   
During the screening visit, each subjec
t’s biomarker level will be assessed via a blood draw and 
subsequent analytical quantification.  Each subject will then be assigned to 1 of 2 groups: 
biomarker-positive or biomarker-negative.  A subject will be considered biomarker-positive if 
her baseline Allo-S level is less than or equal to 2500 pg/mL (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_849199]). The 
biomarker group assignment will remain blinded unti
l database unblinding after the study has 
completed.  Based on the 11-subject OL study, it is estimated that approximately 65% of 
all-comers will be biomarker-positive. 
Subject rescreening is allowed as agreed by [CONTACT_849310] a general 
concern for subject safety or an inability for the subject to become eligible (eg, GNX allergy, 
sensitivity or exposure, non-PCDH19 and/or othe
r ineligible epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], or chronic prohibited 
medical condition or treatment).  Subsequent screening should take place at least 30 days from 
the subjec
t’s last visit. If a subject fails to qualify because of Exclusion Criteria #4 ( ≤ 3 primary 
seizures during the 12-week baseline p
eriod), she will not be randomized. However, she can be 
rescreened after collecting
 another 12 or more weeks of seizure history that satisfies all eligibility 
criteria including I nclusion Criteria #5 and Exc
lusion Criteria #3. Each subject is allowed a 
maximum of 1 rescreening visit.  
The DB  phase includes 4 weeks of IP titration (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) followed by 13 weeks of dose 
maintenance.  After meeting the eligibility criteria, approximately 25 children aged 1 to 17 years

(inclusive) with PCDH19-related epi[INVESTIGATOR_849228] 
(1:1 ratio within each biomarker stratum) for [ADDRESS_1180880] anti-seizure 
treatment.  Subjects will be titrated to 63 mg/kg/d
ay (max 1800 mg/day) over 4 weeks and then 
maintained at that dose for another 13 weeks.  Subjects who ar
e not able to tolerate 63 mg/kg/day 
(or 1800 mg/day maximum) may be maintained on a lower dose
.  A minimum dose of 
33 mg/kg/day or 900 mg/day is generall y required following the DB escalation period, unless a 
lowe
r dose is agreed to with the sponsor due to the tolerability such as somnolence. At each visit, 
dosing will be reviewed and adjusted as neede
d based on subject’s current weight. 
Dose changes, including alternative dosing paradigm (e.g. lower dose during the daytime and 
higher dose in the evening), should be discussed with t
he clinical research organization 
(CRO)/sponsor medical monitor prior to making the change
 or within [ADDRESS_1180881] IP to the treating study clinician; 
dose changes may not exceed the maxim
um total daily do defined by [CONTACT_760]. For any 
subject who is unable to be maintained at the minimum dose, the inves
tigator should contact [CONTACT_849325].  Subjects who discontinue IP should undergo a 2-week 
taper period, unless otherwise medic
ally indicated (Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  Subjects who discontinue 
IP treatment before the completion of the DB phase will continue to be followed per protocol 
and, at a minimum, subjects will be encouraged to maintain daily seizure eDiary entries until the 
DB phase is compl
eted.  These subjects will also return to the site [ADDRESS_1180882]-taper assessments. 
After completing the initial 17-week, DB, PBO-co
ntrolled phase, all subjects will be treated with 
GNX in the OL phase of the study.  Ganaxolone subjects will continue GNX treatment and PBO 
subjects will titrate onto GNX.  To maintain the blind, subj
ects initially randomized to GNX will 
undergo a blinded titration (increasing P
BO doses) for 4 weeks, whereas PBO subjects will 
titrate up to 63 mg/kg/day GNX (1800 mg/day ma
ximum) during the same time period 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  Any subject who completes the stud
y or discontinues IP treatment should 
undergo a 2-week drug
 de-escalation (taper) period (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) and return to the site [ADDRESS_1180883] is

3.2. Duration a
nd Study Co
mpletion Definition 
In the event that the parent/caregiver/LAR does not routinely maintain a daily seizure calendar 
per standard of care, written informed consent will be obtained from the parent/LAR and subject 
assent, and the subject will be asked to return to the clinic for the screening visit after she has 
maintained a 12-week daily historical seizure calendar. Additionally, if genetic testing is not 
completed as standard of care, 
a pre-baseline screening visit can be conducted to do so. 
Eligible subjects will collect [ADDRESS_1180885]’s biomarker level wil
l be assessed via a blood draw and subsequent analytical 
quantification.  Each subject will then be assigned to 1 of 2 groups: biomarker-positive or 
biomarker-negative.  A subject will be considered biomarker-positive if her baseline Allo-S level 
is less than or equal to 2500 pg/mL (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_849199]). Subjects will then be 
randomized (1:1 GNX:  PBO within each biomarker stratum) to a 17-week DB treatment phase 
(4 weeks titration and 13 weeks dose maintenance), followed by a long-term OL treatment phase 
with GNX. The
 biomarker group assignment will remain blinded until database unblinding after 
the study has completed. 
Following 
comple tion of the 17-week DB phase, subjects ra ndomized to PBO will transition to 
GNX (using blinded titration
, Section [IP_ADDRESS]), while subj ects randomiz ed to GNX will stay on 
63 mg/kg/day (1800 mg/day or MTD) suspension or their maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and 
also receive a blinded titration of
 PBO.  Subjects will beg in the 4-w eek blinded dose titration to 
63 mg/kg/day (1800 mg/day or MTD) after completing t he final DB visit.  The OL phase will 
conti
nue until the sponsor terminates the development of the IP in PCDH19-related epi[INVESTIGATOR_849229]’ respective country.

Subjects who complete the study or discontinue IP treatment before the end of the study will  
undergo a 2-week taper period 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS]), unless otherwise medically indicated, afte r 
which they will return to the study site for a sa
fety follow up visit.  Subjects who discontinue  IP

3.3. Sites and Regions 
This multicenter study is to be conducted globally, with approximately [ADDRESS_1180886] been shown to be safe in multiple studies with 
normal volunteers and children with epi[INVESTIGATOR_002].  In this study, subjects will be randomized to 
receive either oral suspension GNX or PBO (1:1 ratio within each biomarker stratum), pre scribed 
in increments of 15 mg/kg/day up to 63 mg/kg
/day (maximum 1800 mg/day).  Full details o f 
GNX dosing is provided in Section 6.2.3. 
The DB  pha
se will be followed by [CONTACT_849326] a n 
addit
ional [ADDRESS_1180887] tolerated dose.  A mini
mum oral suspension dose of 33 mg/kg/day or 900 
mg/day is generally require
d following the DB escalation period, unless a lower dose is agreed to 
with the sponsor due to tolerability issues such as 
somnolence. 
Dose changes including alternative dosing paradigm (e.g., lower dose during the daytime and 
higher dose in the evening) should be dis
cussed with the sponsor/CRO  medical monitor prior to 
making the change or within [ADDRESS_1180888] IP to the treating
 clinician; dose changes may not exceed the maximum daily 
dose defined by [CONTACT_760]. For any subject who is unable to be maintained at the minimum 
dose, the investigator should contact [CONTACT_849327]
d investigational product 
dosing. Subjects who discontinue IP shoul d undergo a 2-week taper period, unless otherwise 
medically indicated.  Subjects who discontinue
 IP treatment before the completion of  the DB 
phase will continue to be followed per protocol and, at a minimum, subjects will be encouraged 
to maintain daily seizure eDiary ent
ries until the DB phase is completed.  These subjects should 
also re
turn to the site after the taper for safety follow-up post-taper assessments.

 Contradict the clinical study label 
 Obscure the clinical study label 
 Identify the study subject by [CONTACT_2300], without consultation with the sponsor 
Additional labels may not be added without the sponsor’s prior full agreement. 
6.4.2. Packaging 
Investi

IP will be provided to the site as individual bottles containing 110 mL in 120-mL HDPE bottles 
at a concentra
tion of 50 mg/mL.   
Changes to sponsor-supplied packaging prior to dosing may not occur without full agreement in 
advance by [CONTACT_456]. 
6.4.3. Storage

but this delegation must be documented.  Investigational products are distributed by [CONTACT_408800] a nominated member of the study team.   
Investigational product should be stored at room temperature 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F). 
I
nvestigational product must be stored in accordance with labeled storage conditions.  
Temperature monitoring of the IP is required at the storage location to ensure that the IP is 
maintained within an establis
hed temperature range.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_849241] m
onitored throughout the duration of the study and that records are maintained; 
the temperature should be monitored continuously by [CONTACT_28920]-house system, by a mechanical 
recording device such as a calibrated chart recorder, or by [CONTACT_3177], such that both 
minimum and maximum thermometric values over a specific time period can be recorded and 
retrieved as required.  Such a device (i.e., certified min/max thermometer) would require manual 
resetting upon each recording.  The sponsor must be notified immediately upon discovery of any 
excursion from the e
stablished range.  Temperature excursions will require site investigation as 
to cause and remediation.  The sponsor will determine the ultimate impact of excursions on the 
IP and will provide supportive documentation as necessary.  Under no circumstances should the 
product be dispensed to subjects until the impact has been determined and the product is deemed 
appropriate for
 use by [CONTACT_456]. 
The sponsor should be notified immediately if there are any changes to the storage area of the IP 
that could affect the integrity of the product(s), such as fumigation of a storage room.

6.6. Subject Compliance 
Subject compliance will be tracked through the electronic seizure and medication diary.  
Parent/c

and non-study AED administration.  Compliance with IP treatment will be monitored by 
[CONTACT_849335] e
lectronic diary entries and returned supplies with queries as necessary.  As a 
generally accepted guideline, subjects should remain 80% compliant with diary entries. 
Parents/caregivers who fall short of this standard will be re-educated on the importance of 
adhering to dail
y seizure, IP and non-study AED recording and a deviation recorded.

7. STUDY PROCEDURES 
7.1. Study Assessments 
See Schedule of Assessme nts (Table 1 and Table 2 ) for details r egarding  scheduled assessments 
and procedures in this study.   
In the event of unforeseen circumstances, in-person study visi t assessments may not be able to be 
performed. To conduct the study acco
rding to protocol while preserving patient safety, 
operational alternatives such as those listed below can be employed as long as the site’s actions 
are in compliance with the institution’s IRB/EC policies and regulations.  
 Telemedicine visits (video and/or audio communication methods) 
 In-home visits 
 Local physician visits
 
 Use of loca
l and/or off-site labora
tories 
 Site- to-patient IP distribu
tion 
7.2. Study Procedures (Doubl
e-Blind Phase) 
7.2.1. Pre-Screen/Screen/Baseline 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Historical Se
izure Type and Frequency and/or Genetic Testing (Pre-Baseline 
Screening Visit (Visit 0))
 
Potential subjects will have already been p
re-identified by [CONTACT_849336]19 genetic mutation testing as part of their standard of care epi[INVESTIGATOR_849246]-up.   
It is also very common that parents/care
givers/LARs of PCDH19-related epi[INVESTIGATOR_849247], which capture
 both seizure type and frequency and days when 
no seizures occur as part of their standard of care treatment regimen.  A 12-week daily historical 
seizure calendar will be reviewed 
at the screening visit to determine eligibility per 
inclusion/exclusion criteria.  Acceptable daily historical seizure calendars will need to denote 
seizure types, frequency, 
and days that no seizures occurred. 
If genetic testing is not done as Standard of Care, a pre-screen visit will be scheduled where 
informed consent/assent is obtained to complete the ge
netic testing. If genetic testing results are 
available per SOC, the genetic testing will
 be done at screening to confirm the results by [CONTACT_849337].  
Procedures specific to this protocol and not otherwise considered standard of care, will not be 
performed until written informed consent (and subject assent) from the subject’s parent or legal 
guardian has been appropriately obt
ained.  In the event that parents/caregivers/LAR do not 
routinely maintain a daily seizure c
alendar or in a situation where the child’s PCDH19-related 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_849248] c
onfirmed with genetic testing per standard of care, written 
informed consent/assent will be obtained and the subje
ct will be asked to return to the clinic for 
the Screening (Visit 1) after she has maintained a 12-week daily historical seizure calendar 
and/or completed genetic testing.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Screening Visit – Start to Baseline (Visit 1, Week –12) 
Additional procedures/as
sessments to be completed during the screening period may include the 
following: 
 In
formed consent from parent/LAR (or subject assent) 
 De
mographics and medical history 
 Historical seizure calendar review 
 Review of inclusion/exclusion criteria 
 Genetic testing to confirm pathogenic or likely pathogenic PCDH19  variant  by [CONTACT_849338], if not done at pre
screening.  
 Seizure Identification and Diagnostic Review Form (SIF/DRF) (Epi[INVESTIGATOR_55610]) 
 Vital signs
 (to include BP, HR, RR, body temperature, weight, and height) 
 P
hysical, neurological, and developmental examination 
 Clinical laboratory tests (to include complete blood count [CBC] with automated differential, 
cre
atinine, blood urea nitrogen, and comprehensive metabolic panel) 
 Urinalysis (An attempt should be made to collect a urine sample at this screening visit.  
Otherwise, the u
rine sample can be collected at baseline) 
 Drug screen (plasma) 
 S
erum pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential  
 Tanner sta
ging 
 Concomi
tant AED review and levels if per standard of care (SOC) 
 Neurosteroid lev
el sample draw 
 Adve
rse events 
 Electronic
 seizure and medication diary set up and review 
A screen failure is a subject for whom full informed consent/assent has been obtained and has 
failed to meet the inclusion criteria and/or met at least [ADDRESS_1180923] to become eligible (eg, GNX allergy, sensitivity or 
exposure, non-PCDH19 and/or other ineligible epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], chronic prohibited medical condition or 
treatment).  Subsequent screening should take place at least [ADDRESS_1180924]’s last visit. 
If a subject fails 
to qualify because of Exclusion Criteria #4 (≤ 3 primary seizures during the 
12-week baseline period), she will not be randomized. However, she can be rescreened after 
collecti
ng another
 12 or more weeks of seizure history that satisfies all eligibility criteria 
including Inclusion Criteria #5 and Exclusion Criteria #3. Each subject is allowed a maximum of 
1 rescreening visit. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Baseline Visit – Randomization (Visit 2, Week 0 + 6 days) 
The following study pro
cedures/assessments to be completed, the results received, and the 
investigator must ensure the subject meets all inclusion and exclusion criteria prior to IP

Potential subjects will be pre-identified by [CONTACT_849339]19 
genetic mutation
 testing as part of their standard of care epi[INVESTIGATOR_849246]-up.  Potential subjects 
will
 have historical seizure diary charting 12 weeks prior to screening.  Eligible historical seizure 
diaries will need to include daily logs of seizure types and frequency and denote the absence of 
seizures on those
 days where no seizures occurred.

7.3.1.  Informed Consent / Assent 
Procedures sp
ecific to this protocol and not otherwise considered standard of care, will not be 
performed until written informed consent/Assent from the subject/parent/caregiver/LAR has 
been appropriately obtained.   
7.3.2. Drug Screen 
A drug sc
reen (plasma) will be performed to test for THC and non-approved CBD during the DB 
phase at Visit 1 (screening), Visit 2 (baseline/randomization), and Visit 5 (final DB/first OL 
visit).  If the screening drug test is positive at Visit 1 (screening), a confirmatory retest, via 
plasma, will be perf
ormed after 2 weeks. A  drug screen may be  performed at any time at 
Investigator’s discretion.  A positive drug test during the DB phase will result in early 
termination.
 
7.3.3. Demographics and Medical History 
Demographics includi
ng age, gender, ethnicity and race will be collected. In addition to the 
genetic confirmation of pathogenic or likely pathogenic PCDH19  variant, relevant medical 
history, including but not limited to the age of seizure onset, other physical disabilities such as 
scoliosis, visual impairment, sensory problems and gastrointestinal difficulties will also be 
assessed; the subject’s developmental history will also be assessed.  Demographics and Medical 
History will be reviewed and collected at the Visit 1 (screening).  A review of the subject’s 
Medical History will be performed again at Visit 2 (baseline/randomization ). 
7.3.4. Historical Seizure Calendar Review 
It is ver
y common for parent/caregivers/LARs to maintain daily seizure calendars for this subject 
population, which capture both seizure type and frequency.  A 12-week historical seizure 
calendar wil
l be reviewed at the screening visit to determine eligibility per inclusion/exclusion 
criteria.  Acceptable historical seizure calendars will need to denote both seizure type and 
frequenc
y and days that no seizures occur. 
In the event the subject is not able to provide eligible historical seizure diary (at least 12 weeks 
prior to screening), the informed consent/assent will need to be obtained and the parent/caregiver 
will need to chart prospective
ly.   
7.3.5. Genetic Testing 
Molecular con
firmation of a pathogenic or likely pathogenic PCDH19  mutation is required.  
Gene
tic mutations will be confirmed by [CONTACT_456]’s chosen central laboratory.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_849249].  If the subject has a de novo PCDH19 VUS then the central assessor, PI, and 
Sponsor will review study inclusion. Some subjects may have multiple PCDH19 mutations that 
include both VUS a
nd pathogenic variants.  In these cases, the subject is known to have a 
pathogenic variant and is elig
ible (does not require discussion with expert).

In the event that parents/caregivers/LAR do not have genetic testing results with a confirmed 
PCDH19-related epi[INVESTIGATOR_849250], written informed consent/assent will be 
obtained.  
Instructions for genetic testing sample collection and processing can be found in the central 
laboratory manual. 
7.3.6. Seizure Identification and Diagnostic Review 
Per the inclusi
on criteria, enrollment into the study will be based on the presence and frequency 
of all countable focal seizures that include progressive hypotonia and impaired awareness, or any 
countable focal or generalized seizure with a clear motor component.   
To standardize seizure identification and classification in the study, a SIF/DRF will be submitted 
and reviewed by [CONTACT_59743][INVESTIGATOR_55610].  Approval of the SIF/DRF will be required 
prior to randomization.  In addition to this form, videos of the subject’s seizure types will also be 
reviewed to confirm proper classification provided that the parent/caregiver is able to capture 
video of these seizure types, parents/caregivers are able to provide videos to the site for upload 
onto a secure encrypted server in a manner consistent with ICH/GCP and if local IRB/EC 
regulations grants approval for collection of such videos.  Parents/caregivers must make every 
effort to capture
 1 example of each of the primary seizure types that their child experiences.  
Although it is acknowled
ged that some seizure types (e.g., atonic/drop seizures) may be more 
difficult to capture
 on video, this information will provide valuable verification of this seizure 
type and the attempt should be made. 
Instructions for completion of the SIF/DRF and submission of videos can be found in the 
Investigator Site File. 
7.4. Efficacy Assessments 
Efficacy as determined by a reduction in seizures will be  evaluated by [CONTACT_849340].   
7.4.1. Seizure Type and Frequency 
Parent/
caregiver/LAR will record daily seizure frequency denoting seizure type and frequency in 
an electronic seizure diary (eDiary).  In rare cases when an eDiary completion is not feasible, a 
paper diary will be used to log daily seizure type and frequency.  These cases will need approval 
by [CONTACT_456].  Primary seizure types of c ountable focal seizures that include progressive 
hypotonia a
nd impaired awareness, or any countable focal or generalized seizure with a clear 
motor component, will be
 counted towards the primary endpoint.   
Subjects or pare
nt/caregiver/LAR are to record administration of IP and background AEDs in the 
eDiary/seiz
ure calendar.  Compliance with IP treatment will be assessed by [CONTACT_849341]’ eDiar
y/seizure calendar and returned supplies with queries as necessary. As a generally 
accepted guideline, subjects should re
main 80% compliant with diary entries. Parents/caregivers 
who fall short of this standard will be re-educated on the importance of adhering to daily seizure, 
IP and non-study AED recording and a deviation recorded.

Protocol 1042 -PCDH19 -3002   20 January  2021 
For recording of seizures in the eDiary, seizure events will be recorded either as a countable 
seizure or a series of continuous uncountable seizures.  Both of these events will be counted as 1 
seizure (equally weighted) in the e
fficacy analysis. 
A seizure cluster will be defined as 3 or more
 seizure events (either a countable or a series of 
continuous uncountable seizures), occurring
 within a period of time, followed by a period of at 
least 24 hours of seizure-freedom.  For e
xample (Figure 2):  
1. If a child experiences 3 seizure events at 5:00, 5:30, and 6:00 PM on Monday, and the 
next seizure event occurs before 6:00 PM on Tues
day, the Monday and Tuesday seizure 
events are considered part of the same seizure cluster ( Figure 2, Scenario 1).   
2. If a child experiences 3 seizure events at 5:00, 5:30, and 6:00 PM on Monday, and the 
next seizure event occurs at 6:00 PM or later on Tue
sday, the Tuesday seizure event is 
not considered part of the same cluster ( Figure 2 , Scenario 2).

The type, dose, date, and freque
ncy of rescue medication will be recorded in the eDiary and 
reviewed every visit.

nued if the criterion is met post baseline. 
If any of the criteria above are deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_978], then the sponsor’s medical 
monitor should be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. 
Due to the difficulty in obtaining urine samples, urinal
ysis will be conducted as follows:  during 
the DB phase at Visit 1 (screening) or baseline/randomization (Visit 2), Visit 3, and at Week 17 
(Visit 5; also Final DB  Visit/First OL Visit in OL phase); in the OL phase a t Visit 7 (Week 36), 
Visit 8 (Week 52) and annually thereafter, or at the Safety Follow-up Post-Taper visit if IP is 
discontinued; and at the Final OL Visit.  An atte

can be collected at baseline. 
7.6.6. Tanner Staging 
The Tanner sc
ale (also known as the Tanner stages) is a scale of physical development in 
children, adolescents, and adults.  The scale defines physical measurements of development 
based on external primary and seconda
ry sex characteristics.  Subjects will be evaluated and 
rated as Tanner I, Tanner II, Tanner III, Tanner IV, and Tanner V.  Tanner staging will occur 
during the DB phase at Visit 1 (screening)
; during the OL phase at Visit 8 (Week 52) and 
thereafter assessed annually for the dura

7.7. Pharmacokinetic Assessments 
A populati
on PK approach addressing the relationship between GNX PK parameters and 
individual characteristics will be implemented during the study.   
Blood sampling for PK  evaluation must be performed at the protocol-scheduled times within the 
windows specified in Table [ADDRESS_1180935] time of
 sample withdrawal and drug intake will 
be recorded in the electronic case report form (e
CRF).  One blood sample will be obtained at the 
following visits for PK analyses: 
During the DB Phase: 

 Visit 3 (Week 5):  between [ADDRESS_1180936] dosing  
 Visit 4 (Wee
k 9):  between [ADDRESS_1180937] dosing 
During the OL Phase: 
 Visit 6 (Week 21): between [ADDRESS_1180938] dosing 
 Visit 8 (Week 52): between [ADDRESS_1180939] dosing 
For all other P
K draws, there is no specified time to draw the PK sample and can be drawn when 
convenient during the study visit for Visit 5 (Week 17), Visit 7 (We
ek 36), Visit 9 (Week 68), 
and every [ADDRESS_1180940] time of sample withdrawal and drug intake will be
 recorded in the electronic case report 
form (eCRF).   
 
Confidential Page [ADDRESS_1180941]; it does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a n 
abnorma l laboratory finding), sympt
om, or disease temporally associated with the use of a  
medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigationa l) 
product ( International Conference on Harmonisation [ICH] Guidance E2A March 1995 ).   
All AEs are collected from the time the informed consent (and subject assent) is signed unti l the 
defined follow-up period.  This includes events oc
curring during the screening phase of the  
study, re gardless of whether or not the IP has been administered.  All AEs reported after the  
initiation of IP will be considered trea
tment-emergent AEs.  Where possible, a diagnosis ra ther 
than a list of symptoms should be recorded.  
If a diagnosis has not been made, then each 
symptom should be listed individually.  All AEs should be captured on the appropriate AE  pages 
in the eCRF and in source documents.  In addition to untoward AEs, unexpected benefits outside 
the IP indication should also be captured on the AE eCRF page.   
All AEs must be followed to closure (the subject’s health has returned to baseline status or all 
variables have returned to normal), regardless of whether the subject is still participating in the 
study.  Closure indicates that an outcome is reached, stabilization is achieved (the PI [INVESTIGATOR_528740]), or the event is otherwise explained.  
When appropriate, medical tests a
nd examinations are performed so that resolution of event(s) 
can be documented.  
8.1.1.  Severity Categorization 
The severity of AEs must be recorded during the course of the event, including the start and stop 
dates for each change in severity.  An event that changes in severity should be captured as a new 
event.  Worsening of pretreatment events, after initiation of the IP, must be recorded as new AEs 
(eg, if a subject experiences mild intermittent dyspepsia prior to dosing of the IP, but the 
dyspepsia becomes severe
 and more frequent after the first dose of the IP has been administered, 
a new AE of severe dyspepsia [with t
he appropriate date of onset] is recorded on the appropriate 
eCRF page). 
The medical assessment of severity is determined by [INVESTIGATOR_1477]: 
Mild: A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention.  The event does not generally interfere with usual 
activities of daily living. 
M
oderate: A type of AE that is usually alleviated with specific therapeutic intervention.  The 
event interferes with usual activit
ies of daily living, causing discomfort, but poses 
no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research subject. 
Severe: A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, that significantly 
affects clinical status, or that may require intensive therapeutic intervention.

Protocol 1042 -PCDH19 -3002   20 January  2021 
8.1.2.  Relationship Categorization 
A physician/investigator must make the assessment of relationship between the IP and each AE.  
The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_849252], in their medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that 
the eve
nt may have been caused by [CONTACT_33249].  If there is no valid reason for suggesting a 
relationship, the AE should be classified as “not related.”    If a relationship between the AE and 
the investigational product is at least reasonably possible (i.e. the relationship cannot be ruled 
out) the AE should be considered "related.” The causality assessment must be documented in the 
source document. 
The following additional guidance may be helpful: 
Term  Relationship definition  
Related  The temporal relationship between the event and the administration of the IP is compelling and/or 
follows a k nown or suspected response pattern to that product, and the event cannot be explained 
by [CONTACT_423]’s medical condition, other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or accident.  
Not related  The event can be readily explained by [CONTACT_1604], such as the subject’s underlying medic al 
condition, concomitant therapy, or accident, and no plausible temporal or biologic relationship 
exists between the IP and the event.  
8.1.3.  Outcome Categorization 
The outcome of AEs must be recorded during the course of the study on the eCRF.  Outcomes 
are as follows: 
 Fatal  
 Not rec
overed/not resolved 
 Recovered/resolved 

 Recovered/resolved with sequelae  
 Rec
overing/resolving 
 Unknown 
8.1.4. S
ymp
toms of the Disease Under Study 
Symptoms o
f the disease under study should not be classified as AEs as long as they are within 
the normal day- to-day fluctuation or expected progression of the disease and are part of the 
efficacy data to be collected in the study; however, significant worsening of the symptoms 
should be recorded as an AE.   
8.1.5. Clinical Laboratory and Other Safety Evaluations 
A chang
e in the value of a clinical laboratory, vital sign, ECG assessment can represent an AE if 
the change is clinically significant or if, during treatment with the IP, a shift of a parameter is 
observed from a normal value to an abnormal value, or there is a further worsening of an already 
abnormal value.  When evaluating such changes, the extent of deviation from the reference 
range, the duration until return to the reference range (either while continuing treatment or after 
the end of treatment with the IP), and the range of variation of the respective parameter within its 
reference range must be taken into consideration. 
 
Confidential Page [ADDRESS_1180942] to the start of study 
treatment, further investigations should be performed until the values return to within the 
reference range or until a plausible explanation ( eg, concomitant disease) is found for the 
abnormal values. 
The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_849253], based on the above criteria and the clinical condition of a subject, whether 
a change
 in a clinical laboratory, vital sign, or ECG parameter is clinically significant and 
therefore represents an AE. 
8.1.6.  Pregnancy 
All pregnancies are to be reported from the time informed consent (and subject assent) is signed 
until the defined follow-up period. 
Any report of pre
gnancy for any study subject must be reported within 24 hours to the Marinus 
Safety Department or its delegate using
 the Pregnancy Report Form.  A copy of the Pregnancy 
Report Form (and any applicable follow
-up reports) must also be sent to the CRO/Marinus 
medical monitor using the details specified in the emergency contact [CONTACT_849343].  The pregnant study subject must be withdrawn from the study. 
Every effort should be made to gather infor
mation regarding the pregnancy outcome and 
condition of the infant.  It is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_849254] 30 
calendar days after the initial notification and a
pproximately 30 calendar days after delivery.   
Pregnancy complications such as spontaneous abortion/miscarriage or congenital abnor mality 
are considered SAEs and must be reported a s outlined in Section 8.2.2 of the protocol usi ng the 
Marinus C
linical Study Serious Adverse Event Form.  Non-serious AEs are to be reporte d as per 
cli
nical eCRF guidelines.  Note:  An elective  abortion is not considered an SAE. 
In addition to the above, if the PI [INVESTIGATOR_849255] , it must be 
reported as an SAE to the Marinus Safety D
epartment or delegate as outlined in Section 8.2.[ADDRESS_1180943] positive serum/urine -human chorionic gonadotropin test or ultrasound result will
 
determine the pregnancy onset date. 
8.1.7. Abuse, Misuse, Overdose, and Medication Error 
Abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication error must be re
ported to the sponsor per the SAE 
reporting procedure whether or not it results in an AE/SAE as described in Section 8.2.2.  Note:

Confidential Page [ADDRESS_1180945] medical occurrence (whether considered to be related to IP or not) that 
at any dose:
 
 Results in death 
 Is life-threatening.  Note:  The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to 
an event in whic
h the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to 
an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  Note:  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_849258], which are the result of elective or previously scheduled surgery for 
preexisting conditions that have not worsened after initiation of treatment, should not be 
classified as SAEs.  For example, an admission for a previously scheduled ventral hernia 
repair would not be
 classified as an SAE; however, a complication resulting from a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_849259]. 
 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
 Is a
 congenital abnormality or birth defect 
 Is a
n important medical event.  Note:  Important medical events that may not result in death, 
be li
fe-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_59698], based on 
appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardize the subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of 
such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.   
8.2.4.  Serious Adverse Event Collection Time Frame 
All SAEs (regardless of relationship to study) are collected from the time the 
parent/caregiver/LAR/subject signs the informed consent/assent until the defined follow-up 
period stated and must be reported to the Marinus Safety Department and the CRO/Marinus 
medical monitor w
ithin [ADDRESS_1180946] awareness of the event.   
In addition, any SAE considered “related” to the IP and discovered by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_849260] c
ompleted must be reported to the Marinus Safety Department within [ADDRESS_1180947] after signing the informed consent 
form (and subject assent) or leading up to the onset date of the SAE, or following the resolution 
date of the SAE, must be recorded a
s an AE, if appropriate. 
 
Confidential Page [ADDRESS_1180948]’s death (i.e., the SAE was noted as the primary cause of 
death) must have fatal checked as an outcome, with the date of death recorded as the resolution 
date.  For all other events ongoing at the time of death that did not contribute to the subject’s 
death, the outcome should be conside
red not resolved, without a resolution date recorded. 
For any SAE that results in the subject’s death or any ongoing events at the time of death, unless 
another IP action was previously taken ( eg, the drug wa s interrupted, reduced, or withdrawn), the 
action taken with the IP should be recorded as “dose not changed” or “not applicable” (if the 
subject never 
received the IP).  The IP action of “withdrawn” should not be selected solely as a 
result of the subject’s death.   
8.2.7. Regulatory Agency, Institutional Review Board, Ethics Committee, and Site 
Reportin
g 
The sponsor is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities in the [LOCATION_002] 
(US) and the CRO is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities in rest of world 
of related, unexpected SAEs. 
In addition, the sponsor or the CRO is responsible for notifying active sites and central 
institutional review boards (IRBs) of all related, unexpected SAEs occurring during all 
interventiona
l studies across the GNX program.

9. DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL METHODS 
9.1. Data Collection 
The PI ’s authorized site personnel must enter the information required by [CONTACT_849344].  A study monitor will visit each site in accordance with the monitoring plan and review 
the eCRF data against the source data for completeness and accuracy.  Discrepancies between 
source data
 and data entered on the eCRF will be addressed by [CONTACT_1746].  When a 
data discrepa
ncy warrants correction, the correction will be made by [CONTACT_1747].  
Data collection procedures will be discussed with the site at the site initiation visit and/or at the 
PI’s meeting.  Once a subject is screened, it is expected that site personnel will complete the 
eCRF e
ntry within approximatel y [ADDRESS_1180949]’s visit. 
The subject
’s parent/caregiver/LAR must enter the information required by [CONTACT_849345].  A study monitor will review all seizure diary entries in accordance with the monitoring 
plan for completen
ess and accuracy.  Discrepancies will be addressed by [CONTACT_748]’ 
parent/caregiver/L
AR and qualified site personnel.  When a data discrepancy warrants 
correcti
on, the correction will be made by [CONTACT_748]’ parent/caregiver/LAR and authorized site 
personnel.  Dat
a collection procedures will be discussed with the site at the site initiation visit 
and/or at the investi
gator’s meeting.  Once the subject’s parent/caregiver/LAR signs informed 
consent (and subject assent), it is expected that all eDiary entries will be made daily. 
Retrospecti
ve entry of diary events (seizure and medication) can be completed by [CONTACT_849346] 5 days later and proxy entry by [CONTACT_849347] (greater than 5 
days), but neit
her method is encouraged. 
Telephone Follow-up visits are allowed to be conducted via secure email per institutional policy 
if granted by [CONTACT_59754]/EC.  
9.2. Clinical Data Management 
Data will be entered into a clinical database as specified in the CRO  data management plan.  
Quality c
ontrol and data validation procedures will be applied to ensure the validity and accuracy 
of the clinical database. 
Data will be reviewed and checked for omissions, errors, and values requiring further 
clarificati
on using computerized and manual procedures.  Data queries requiring clarification 
will be communicated to the site for resolution.  Only authorized personnel will make corrections 
to the clinica
l database, and all corrections will be documented in an auditable manner. 
9.3. Statistical Analysis Proce ss 
The study will be analyzed by [CONTACT_10196].  The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will 
provide the statistic
al methods and definitions for the analysis of the efficacy and safety data, as 
well as describe the approaches to be taken for summarizing other study information, such as 
subject dispo
sition, demographics, and baseline characteristics; IP exposure;  and prior and 
concomitant medications.  The SAP will also include a description of how missing data will be 
addressed.  To preserve the integrity of the statistical analysis and study conclusions, the SAP 
will be finalized prior to database lock.

 IND 044020   Marinus Ph armaceuticals Inc.  
Protocol 1042 -PCDH19 -3002   20 January  2021 
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® (SAS Institute, Cary, NC [ZIP_CODE]).  A 
summary o
f the statistical analyses is provided below; full, updated details are provided in a 
SAP. 
9.4. Data Monitoring Committee 
The emerging study data will be reviewed on a regular basis by [CONTACT_105231] (DMC).  The mission of the DMC will be to safeguard the interests of study subject s 
and to enhance the integrity and credibility of the trial.  To enable the DMC to achieve its 
mission, the DMC will
 have ongoing access to efficacy and safety data and data regarding 
quality of trial conduct and will ensure the confidentiality of these data will be protected.  A 
DMC charter 
will provide the principles and guidelines for the DMC process. 
9.5. Sample Size Calculation and Power Considerations 
A total of 50 subjects (25 in each treatment group) w as planned to be enrolled in the study.  
 
Note: Protoco l versi
ons [ADDRESS_1180950]-baseline efficacy assessment. 
The P
er-Protocol (PP) population includes all ITT subjects without major protocol violations 
(defined prior to database lock).   There will be no PP population for the OL period of the study. 
9.7. General St
atistical Considerations 
Source data for the summary tables and statistical analyses will be presented as subject data 
listings, which include data collected on the electronic case report forms (eCRFs) as well as any 
derived efficacy variables for all enrolled subjects.  
Except where noted, separate tables and data listings will be prepared for the DB and OL phases 
of the study.  Only events occurring before entry into the OL phase will be included in the DB 
phase outputs, and except where indicated, only baseline events and events occurring after entry 
into the OL phase will included in the OL phase outputs.  
Baseline seizure activity will be determined by [CONTACT_849306]’s daily seizure 
eDiaries, which are provided after signing informed consent/assent.  Within the DB phase of the 
study, determination of post-baseline seizure activity will begin on the day following the first day 
 
Confidential Page [ADDRESS_1180951] of only the 
subjects within the corresponding stratum.  The tables for the DB phase will show the results for 
each DB
 treatment group and, where noted, combined over the groups as well.  The tables for the 
OL phase will show the results for each DB treatment group (all subjects will be receiving GNX 
in the OL phase) and combined over them.  For the efficacy endpoints, the results will be derived 
according to the randomized treatment group; for the other endpoints, they will be derived 
according to the treatment actually received.  
Baselines for non-seizure efficacy and safety assessments are defined as the last non-missing 
value of the assessment before the first dose of treatment.   
The OL phase will use the same baseline as the DB phase.  
9.8. Subject Disposition 
Disposition will be summarized within the DB treatment groups and overall among all subjects 
within both the DB and extension phases of the study. 
Subjects completing the DB phase of the study are those who completed the 17-week DB 
treatment phase, regardless of whether they entered the OL.  A listing of dispositions will be 
provided for all randomized subjects. 
9.9. Eligibility Criteria and Protocol Deviations 
The clinical team will identify deviations; these will be provided in a data listing.  A data listing 
of subjects who violate any of the inclusion/exclusion characteristics will also be provided, as 
well as a data listing of subjects with other protocol violations. 
9.10. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic data (age, gender, race, height, weight and body mass index (BMI), and ethnicity) 
and baseline characteristics (Tanner staging) collected prior to the first dose will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics. 
9.11. Medical History and Genetic Testing 
Medical history will be coded with the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
Terminology version 22.0.  The number and percent of subjects with clinically significant 
medical history
 at screening will be summarized by [CONTACT_6657] (PT) 
by [CONTACT_849348]. 
The results of the genetic testing, historical seizure information, and seizure identification and 
diagnostic review will be summarized and listed. 
 
Confidential Page [ADDRESS_1180952] dose of 
DB study drug.  Concomitant medications are defined as medications (other than the study drug) 
taken on or after the
 first dose of the DB study drug, regardless of when the medications started.   
9.13. Efficacy Analyses 
9.13.1. Double-Blind Phase 
For the analyses of seizures, the baseline phase consists of the 8- or -[ADDRESS_1180953] dose of OL treatment for those who do.    
Tests of significance between the 2 treatment groups will be performed for the primary endpoint 
with a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Handling of Missing Data 
Careful educating and monitoring of the study sites will attempt to limit the amount of missing 
data to nearly zero, but despi[INVESTIGATOR_120502], some missing data may still ari se.   
Intermittent (random/sporadic) missing data during the 17-week double blind phase and any 
missing data during the baseline phase will be assumed missing at random and the collected data 
will be used to calculate the 28-day seizure frequencies. 
For early
 drug termination prior to the end of the 17-week DB phase, caregivers will be 
instructed to continue to provide daily seizure records until the end of the 17-week DB phase 
(hence further preventing missingness).  
The primary analysis will use all available data. Careful educating and monitoring of the study 
sites will attempt to limit the amount of missing data. Sensitivity analys es, with replacement of 
missing data, will be performed for the primary efficacy endpoint.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Prim
ary Endpoint (Seizure Control) 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent change in 28-day primary seizure frequency during 
the 17-week DB phase relative to the baseline. The primary seizure types are defined as 
countable focal seizures that include progressive hypotonia and impaired awareness, or any 
countable focal or 
generalized seizure with a clear motor component. Focal and generalized 
nonmotor seizures and myoclonic seizures do not count as the primary seizure types.  
The analyses of the primary endpoint will be performed on the sum of the individual countable 
seizures and each series of continuous uncountable seizures (each contributes 1 to the sum).   
Post-baseline 28-day seizure frequency will be calculated as the total number of seizures in the 
17-week DB treatment phase divided by [CONTACT_849314], 
multiplied b
y 28. Baseline 28-day seizure frequency will be calculated as the total number of 
seizures in the baseline phase divided by [CONTACT_849314], 
multiplied by 28. The difference between the GNX and placebo groups in the percent changes 
will be tested using
 the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum statistic.  Testing will be conducted in the following

times per week), or 3 = Usually (5 - 7 times per week) . Item 32 (Watc hing TV) and 33 (Riding 
in car) ask how sleepy the child h as appea red during those activities (1 = Not sleepy, 2 = Ve1 y 
sleepy , or 3 = Falls asleep). The questio nnaire includes 2 other qu antitative questio ns: 
• C hild's usual amount of sleep each day 
• N umber of minutes a night waking usually lasts 
The 33 items are pa1iit ioned into 8 domains: 
1. Bedtime resistance (items 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8) 
2. Sleep onset delay (item 2) 
3. Sleep duration (items 9, 10, 11)

Other than the wit hin-stratum analyses , no s ubgroup analyses are planned at this time. 
9.13.3. Sensitivity Anal yses 
Two sensitivity analyses of the primaiy efficacy endpo int of change in 28-day frequency of the 
primaiy seizure types will be perfo1med: 
futennittent (random/s poradic) missing data durin g the 17- week DB phase and any missing data 
durin g the baseline phase will be assumed missing complet ely at random and the collected data 
will be used to calculate the 28-day seizure frequencies. For eai·ly diug te1min ation prior to the 
end of the 17-week DB phase, cai·egivers will be instructed to continue to provide daily seizure 
records until the end of the 17- week DB phase (hence furth er preventing missingness) . 
fu the first sensitivity analysis, the following impu tation ap proach will be used for the prim aiy 
outco me m easure when a s ubject stops recording measuremen ts pennan ently (antic ipated to be 
zero or minim al in occmTence) prior to th e end of the 17- week DB phase: for the missing days , 
the conespond ing median PBO data will be impu ted (nTespective of treatinent aim), within each 
sti·atum, as follows:

 Compute the median  28-day seizure frequency in the PBO arm based on all available PBO 
measurements during the 17-week DB treatment phase.  Label that ‘X’ and define ‘A’ to be 
‘X’/28, (i.e., the daily avera
ge on placebo during the 17-week during the DB phase ). 
 For any days (whether they be on the PBO or GNX arm) that occur AFTER a subject has 
become lost to follow up, imput
e ‘A’ on that day. 
 
The se
cond sensitivity analysis will explore the possibility that subjects who stop recording their 
seizure counts tend to have higher seizure counts than the other subjects. The imputation method 
described above will be modified to use the median of the [ADDRESS_1180956] counts, rather than the 
median count, among the PBO subjects with data. 
9.13.4. Protections for Multiplicity 
To control the family-wise Type I error rate, hypothesis testing of the primary e fficacy endpoint 
will be conducted sequentially in the order specified in Section [IP_ADDRESS].   
9.13.5. Open-Label Period Anal
yses 
All of the analyses for the DB phase, will be repeated for the OL phase with the following 
differences: 
 The results will be presented overall and also classified according to the DB treatment 
received by [CONTACT_849349]. 
 P
ost-baseline seizure endpoints will be derived based on the first day of OL treatment. 
 No sensitivi
ty analyses will be performed 
 The seizure frequencies during the titration and maintenance phases will not be analyzed. 
 The time points for
 the efficacy, exploratory, and quality of life endpoints will be after 19 
weeks, 51 wee
ks, and every 16 weeks thereafter of OL treatment relative to the prospective 
baseline phase. 
 The differenc
es between the DB treatment groups in the percent changes from baseline of the 
28-day seizure frequencies w
ill not be tested for statistical significance. 
 No PP  analyses will be performed. 
 
Confidential Page [ADDRESS_1180957] perce
ntage of the maximum allowable daily dose (1800 mg or 63 mg/kg) that subjects 
received, and the total amount of investigational product received will be summarized. For the

entire study
 (combined DB and OL phases) but the classification by [INVESTIGATOR_18213]-blind treatment 
applies only for the open-label phase summary.  The summarization over the entire study will 
include the double-blind data only from subjects who were in the GNX group during the double-
blind phase, regardless of whether they entered the open-label phase, and all the subjects from 
the open-label phase.  
Adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_59724], system organ class, and Preferred Term using the 
Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) coding system.  Incidence and 
percentage of AEs will be presented.  Additional tables, with AEs classified by [CONTACT_849350]
d to drug as assessed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_462034].  Su bset listing s will be 
produced for AEs that cause withdrawal and for SAEs.  Clinical laboratory tests (hematology, 
chemistry and urinalysis), vital signs and ECGs will be summarized using descriptive statistics 
including changes from baseline.  In addition, shift tables cross-tabulating the baseline and post-
baseline low/normal/high classifications by [CONTACT_849351].  
Physical, neurological and developmental examinations will be summarized using number and 
percentage of subjects with abnormalities. 
The Tanner scale (also known as the Tanner stages) is a scale of physical development in 
children, adolescents and adults.  The scale defines physical measurements of development based 
on external prim
ary and secondary sex characteristics.  Subjects will be evaluated and rated as 
Tanner I, 
Tanner II, Tanner III, Tanner IV and Tanner V.  The Tanner scale is administered 
following the first dose, 
only during the OL phase of the study. 
The baseline and post-baseline values and the arithmetic changes from baseline of the 
neurosteroid levels will be summarized using descriptive statistics.   
Concomitant AED levels are not mandatory but will be collected per sites’ standard of care.  A 
subject listing, including date and time of last AED dose and date and time of AED PK sample, 
will be provided. 
Detailed analysis and complete listings will be outlined in the SAP. 
9.15. Pharmacokinetic Analyses 
A listing of the PK collection times will be provided, but the analyses will be described in a 
separate
 report (analyses details will be provided in the SAP).   
The PK population will
 include all subjects who have received at least [ADDRESS_1180958] and

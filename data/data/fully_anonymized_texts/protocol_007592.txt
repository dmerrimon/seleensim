Version 5.0  CLINICAL STUDY SYNOPSIS  
Title  A Randomized Double-blind Placebo-controlled Study to Evaluate the 
Safety and Efficacy of ATYR1923 In Adult Patients With Severe 
Pneumonia Related To SARS- CoV-2 Infection (COVID -19) 
Sponsor  aTyr Pharma, Inc.  
Clinical Phase  2 
Indication  Treatment of severe pneumonia due to SARS- CoV -2 infection. 
Objectives and 
Endpoints  The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of ATYR1923, compared to placebo, in subjects with SARS-CoV2 -related severe pneumonia not requiring mechanical ventilation. 
Primary  
• To assess the safety of a single intravenous (IV) dose of ATYR1923. Safety will be assessed by:  
- Incidence of treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs), 
including serious and severe TEAEs, overall and by [CONTACT_926]. 
Secondary  
• To assess the preliminary effects of ATYR1923 on clinical outcome measures of SARS -CoV -2 infection, including:  
- Time to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  
- Time to recovery (World Health Organization [WHO] Ordinal 
Scale score ≤3).  
- Proportion of patients achieving recovery by [CONTACT_2006] 14 and Day 28. 
- Duration of supplemental oxygen (O
2) requirement. 
- Number of days with fever (temperature >100.4ºF [38.0ºC]). 
- Change from baseline in WHO Ordinal Scale score on Days 5, 7, 14, 28, and 60. 
- Time to improvement from inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_590788] a 1 point reduction in WHO Ordinal Scale score. 
- All-cause mortality at Days 14, 28, and 60.

Version 5.0  Exploratory :  
• To explore the preliminary efficacy of ATYR1923 for SARS -CoV -
2 infection by [CONTACT_590813]:  
- Change from baseline in supplemental oxygen requirement at 
Days 3, 5, 10, 14 and discharge. 
- Proportion of patients requiring intubation, and among those 
patients, number of days of intubation.  
• To assess the pharmacodynamics (PD) of a single IV dose of 
ATYR1923 by [CONTACT_590814] : C-reactive protein (CRP), interferon gamma (INF -γ), 
interleukin (IL)- 6, IL -2, IL -7, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-alpha 
(TNFα), macrophage inflammatory protein-1 (MIP1), C-X- C motif 
chemokine 10 (CXC-10), and  monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 
(MCP -1). 
• To assess the impact of a single IV dose of ATYR1923 by 
[CONTACT_590815] -19 disease, including 
serum ferritin  and D- dimer.  
Study  Design  This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled study to evaluate 
the safety, PD, and efficacy of ATYR1923 in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_388988] -CoV -2-related severe pneumonia not requiring mechanical 
ventilation . SARS -CoV -2 infection will be confirmed usi ng a polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR) based test during Screening.  
Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to a single IV dose of ATYR1923 1 mg/kg, ATYR1923 3 mg/kg, or placebo. Study drug will be added to standard of care (SOC) per institutional standard for treating 
SARS -CoV2 infection. 
A single dose of study drug will be administered on Day 1. All study drug 
will be administered in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885]; patients who are intubated after 
randomization but prior to study drug administration are no longer eligible 
to receive study drug. As this is a single-dose study, the treatment period is 
[ADDRESS_778736] -treatment. 
The schedule of study assessments over this period is dependent on the duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_590789] ( ie, non- intubated  and intubated  patients).  
• While hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] , non-intubated patien ts will have study 
assessments performed while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_342601] 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, and Day 14 and/or Discharge .  
- If the non-intubated patient is discharged prior to Day 14, the 
assessments scheduled for Day 14 and/or Discharge will be 
completed at t he time of discharge. If discharge occurs on 
another scheduled study assessment day (ie,  any day between 
Day 2 and 10), the Day 14 and/or Discharge  assessments 
aTyr Pharma, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol Number ATYR1923-C-[ADDRESS_778737] (TC) follow -up visits.  
- If the patient is discharged prior to Day 14, then outpatient TC 
follow-up visits are to be conducted on Day 7 (as applicable) and Day 14. 
- If the non-intubated patient is discharged after Day 14, the 
patient is to have the assessments scheduled for Day 14 and/or 
Discharge performed on the day of discharge. If the patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80529] ≥21 days, the Day 14 assessments are to be 
performed weekly (Days 21, 28, 35, etc.) until discharge (with the exception of PK, which is to be done only at Day 28) . After 
discharge, the patient will proceed to the next scheduled 
outpatient TC follow -up visit. (Thus, if a patient remains 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_119813] 28, the Day 28 TC follow- up visit need not 
be conducted.) 
• In the event a patient is intubated , SOC assessments and 
interventions will supersede study assessments while intubated and 
for the duration of intubation
1, with clinical assessments collected 
as available per the institution’s electronic medical records. 
- Patients will resume the study assessment schedule upon  
extubation. (Thus, for example, if an intubated  patient is 
extubated on Day 7, they will resume the study assessment 
schedule on Day 7). 
- Extubated patients will have the assessments scheduled for 
Day 14 and/or Discharge performed at the time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_590790] 28 and 60 TC follow- up visits.  
- If the patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80529] ≥21 days, assessments 
(outlined in Section 4.1.1), are to be performed weekly (Days  21, 28, 35, etc.) until discharge (with the exception of 
PK, which is to be done only at Day 28). After discharge, the patient wi ll proceed to the next scheduled outpatient TC 
follow-up visit. (Thus, if a patient remains hospi[INVESTIGATOR_119813] 28, the Day 28 TC follow-up visit need not be conducted.) 
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review the progress of the stu dy and perform  interim review s of safety data at regular 
intervals beginning after the [ADDRESS_778738] one of 
the following:  
- Respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] >30 breaths/min; or 
- Severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], as determined by [CONTACT_737]; or; 
- Oxygen saturation ( SpO
2) ≤93% on room air. 
4. Female patients of childbearing potential must be willing to use adequate contraception or refrain from heterosexual intercourse 
from Screening  until [ADDRESS_778739] 
follow- up visit. (Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for details regarding 
adequate contraception.)

Version 5.0  2. INTRODUCTION 
2.1. ATYR1923 
ATYR1923 is a novel molecular entity that acts as an extracellular immunomodulator and is 
under development for treatment of interstitial lung disease ( ILD). ATYR1923 comprises a 
human 59 amino acid protein (iMod) fused to the Fc region of human immunoglobulin 1 (IgG1). The amino acid sequence of the 59 amino acid iMod domain in ATYR1923 corresponds identically to the extracellularly active iMod domain of histidyl- tRNA synthetase (HARS) amino 
acids 2 to 60 (HARS 2-60). In solution, the ATYR1923 molecule for ms a homodimer, similar to 
other Fc fusion proteins.  
ATYR1923 may provide a naturally occurring human immunomodulatory function to 
therapeutically control or balance the human immune system. The mechanism of action of ATYR1923 in T- cells overlaps with the  cellular pathology observed in lung sarcoidosis. In 
nonclinical studies, ATYR1923 has been shown to inhibit cytokines involved in regulation of inflammatory and immune responses and attenuate T- cell activation (Mertsching et al., 2018) As 
Neuropi[INVESTIGATOR_16568]-2 ( NRP -2) was recently discovered to bind ATYR1923, and innate immune cells 
such as dendritic cells and macrophages are known to express NRP-2 ( Roy et al., 2017; 
Schellenburg et al., 2017 ), further research into the interaction between ATYR1923 and NRP-2 
on these cells could potentially elucidate an additional mechanism through which ATYR1923 
modulates the immune system.  
2.1.1. Clinical Experience with ATYR1923  
To-date,  ATYR1923 has been evaluated in 1 completed study in normal healthy volunteers 
(ATYR1923-C-001) and 1 ongoing, blinded placebo- controlled study in patients with active 
pulmonary sarcoidosis (ATYR1923-C-002) ; data from this latter study remain blinded .  
In Study ATYR1923-C-001, 25 healthy adult subjects were exposed to single doses of ATYR1923 ranging from 0.03 to 5.0 mg/kg. ATYR1923 pharmacokinetics ( PK) was dose-
proportional over the range of 0.03 mg/kg to 5.0 mg/kg. Terminal elimination phases were 
parallel, and the mean t
1/2 was consistent from the 0.1 mg/kg dose onwards, with mean values 
ranging from 167 to 242 hours, supporting the potential for once-monthly dosing. ATYR1923 was generally well  tolerated at all doses tested . No severe treatment -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), or TEAEs leading to study drug modification (dose reduction or discontinuation) were reported. No apparent dose relationship was seen across the range of doses studied with regard to the incidence of TEAEs. Adverse reactions reported were headache, dizziness, and back pain.  
The safety profile of ATYR1923 in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis in Study ATYR1923-C-
002 was consistent with that seen in healthy volunteers. No deaths or treatment- related SAEs 
were reported. Adverse reactions included dizziness, headache, and productive cough (each 
2 patients) and back pain, Candida infection (considered related to Symbicort), diarrhea, migraine, ras h pruritic, sinus congestion, and urticaria (each 1 patient).

Version 5.0  Three (13%) patients experienced a severe (Grade 3) TEAE; no Grade 4 TEAEs were reported. 
Grade 3 TEAEs included cholecystitis acute, depression, and urticaria, each in 1 (4%) patient.  
No ATYR1 923-treated subject in Study ATYR1923-C- 001 experienced a definitive infusion-
related reaction ( IRR). However, the occurrence of an IRR could not be ruled out for subject, 
who experienced mild, transient symptoms of dizziness, abdominal pain, and “feeling cold” followed by [CONTACT_590817]. A patient with pulmonary sarcoidosis in Study ATYR1923-C-002 also experienced events considered representative of an IRR, with this patient similarly experiencing mild transient symptoms of dizziness as well as back pain. Other symptoms included a generalized warm sensation and tingling. As data from this study remain blinded, it is unknown whether this patient was exposed to ATYR1923.  
To-date, no patient participating in an ATYR1923 clinical study has developed a persistent  anti-
drug antibod y (ADA) response, or has been positive for Jo -1 antibodies (Ab) after ATYR1923 
exposure.  
2.2. Rationale for ATYR1923 for the Treatment of Severe Pneumonia  
Related to SARS -CoV-2 Infection (COVID -19) 
Emergent data gathered from patients with COVID -19 infection  indicate that significant 
inflammatory infiltration of the lungs and concurrent elevations in pro- inflammatory 
cytokines/chemokines ( ie, cytokine storms) are prominent factors in severe cases that have 
progressed to acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] ( ARDS ) (Zhou et al., 2020 ). Severely ill 
patients have significant increases in plasma concentrations of several pro -inflammatory 
cytokines: interleukins (IL)-2, -7, - 6 and 10, granulocyte -colony stimulating factor, interferon -
monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), macrophage i nflammatory protein 1 alpha 
(MIP1A), and tumor necrosis factor- alpha (TNF -α), indicative of a cytokine storm ( Wang et al., 
2020 ). Consistent with this acute inflammatory insult, serial computed tomography scans of 
patients with COVID -19 infection illustrate the rapid development of diffuse interstitial lung 
injury, which tracks with clinical disease progression ( Shi et al., 2020 ). It has been hypothesized 
that rapid activation of CD4+T lymphocytes leads to the acute elevations the se pro -inflammatory 
cytokines, resulting in aberrant lung inflammation and leading to potentially fatal lung damage 
(Zhou et al., 2020). 
ATYR1923 decreases the release of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-2, TNF-α, and IL-[ADDRESS_778753] mouse model. In two granuloma-forming, highly 
inflammatory mouse models of interstitial lung disease, S. rectivirgula-induced chronic

Version 5.0  hypersensitivity pneumonitis and P. acnes -induced sarcoidosis, ATYR1923 treatment led to the 
reduction of several pro -inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, MCP-1 and IFN- γ (Burkart et 
al., 2019 ). The immunomodulatory activity of ATYR1923 is likely exerted through interaction 
with the cell- surface receptor NRP -2, which is present on multiple immune cell types and 
upregulated on alveolar macrophages and inflammatory monocytes in response to inflammatory 
conditions in the lung. A potential therape utic effect of ATYR1923 was also investigated in a 
murine acute lung injury model that reproduces key features of human ARDS. Treatment with 
ATYR1923 at 3.0 and 10 mg/kg led to a dose-dependent reduction of total neutrophil and alveolar macrophage counts in the lung at 24h post insult.  
Thus, a strong scientific rationale exists to investigate ATYR1923 as a treatment for severe 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_590798]-19 infection. aTyr is conducting the current study to 
evaluate ATYR1923 1 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg in adults with  severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_590799] -CoV2  infection. Eligible patients will be adults aged [ADDRESS_778754] 
of ATYR1923 on other outcome measures in this patient population also will be explored.

Version 5.0  4. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
4.1. Overall Study Design and Plan  
Study ATYR1923-C-003 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the 
safety, PD and efficacy of ATYR1923 in subjects with SARS-CoV-2 related severe pneumonia. SARS -CoV-2 infection will be confirmed using a polymerase ch ain reaction (PCR) based test 
during Screening. The Investigator , Sponsor, and patient will be blinded to treatment assignment; 
study center pharmacy personnel will be unblinded. 
Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to a single IV dose of ATYR1923 1 mg/kg, 
ATYR1923 3 mg/kg, or placebo. Study drug (ATYR1923 or placebo) will be added onto institutional standard  of care (S OC) for treating SARS -CoV2 infection.  
A single dose of study drug will be administered on Day 1. All study drug will b e administered 
in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885]; patients who are intubated after randomization but prior to study drug 
administration are no longer eligible to receive study drug.  As this is a single -dose study, the 
treatment period is [ADDRESS_778755]- treatment. 
The schedule of study assessments over this period is dependent on the duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_590789]. 
 
• While hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] , non-intubated patients will have study assessme nts performed on Days 2, 
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, and Day 14 and/or Discharge.  
- If the non-intubated patient is discharged prior to Day 14, the assessments scheduled for 
Day 14 and/or Discharge will be completed at the time of discharge. If discharge occurs 
on another scheduled study assessment day ( ie, any day between Day 2 and 10), the 
Day 14 and/or Discharge assessments supersede that study assessment day and the patient 
then will proceed to outpatient telephone contact (TC) follow-up visits. 
- If a patient is d ischarged prior to Day 14, then outpatient TC follow-up visits are to be 
conducted on Day 7 (as applicable) and Day 14.  
- If the non-intubated patient is discharged on Day [ADDRESS_778756] the 
assessments scheduled for Day 14 and/or Discharge performed on the day of discharge. If 
the patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80529] ≥21 days, the Day 14 assessments are to be performed weekly (Days  21, 28, 35, etc.) until discharge (with the exception of PK, which is to be 
done only at Day 28). After discharge, the patient will proceed to the next scheduled outpatient TC follow-up visit. (Thus, if a patient remains hospi[INVESTIGATOR_119813] 28, the Day 28 TC follow-up visit need not be conducted.)

Version 5.0  • In the event a patient  is intubated , SOC assessments and interventions will supersede study 
assessments for the duration of their intubation2, with clinical assessments collected as 
available per the institution's electronic medical records  (see Section 4.1.1). 
- Intubated patients will resume the study assessment schedule upon extubation. (Thus, for 
example, if an intubated patient is  extubated , they will resume the study assessment 
schedule on Day 7).  
- Extubated  patients will have the assessments scheduled for Day 14 and/or Discharge  
performed at the time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_590801] 28 and 60 TC follow-up visits.  
- If the patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80529] ≥21 days, assessments (outlined in Sect ion 4.1.1), are to 
be performed weekly (Days 21, 28, 35, etc.) until discharge (with the exception of PK, which is to be done only at Day 28). After  discharge, the patient will proceed to the next 
scheduled outpatient TC follow-up visit. (Thus, if a patient remains hospi[INVESTIGATOR_119813] 28, the Day 28 TC follow-up visit need not be conducted.) 
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review the progress of the study and perform  interim review s of safety data at regular intervals beginning after the 6
th patient  has 
been  dosed, and at a frequency guided by [CONTACT_590821] .  
4.1.1. Assessments During Intubation  
In the event that a patient requires intubation, SOC assessments and interventions will supersede 
study a ssessments for the duration of intubation, with the exception of the WHO Scale and 
sample collection for ADA and Jo-1 Ab, which will continue to be collected as per the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ) on Days 5, 7, 10, 14 and weekly thereafter. T he following clinical 
assessments will be collected and analyzed as available per the institution's electronic medical records.   
• Date and time of intubation and extubation. 
• Adverse events ( AEs) (including new infections). In the case of new infections, the site and 
source of culture are to be recorded.  
• Concomitant medications.  
Patients requiring intubation will have the assessments scheduled for Day 14 and/or Discharge 
performed at the time of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_590801] 28 and 60 TC follow-up visits.

Version 5.0  If the patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80529] ≥21 days, the Day 14 and/or Discharge assessments are to be 
performed weekly (Days 21, 28, 35, etc.) until discharge (with the exception of PK, which is to be done only at Day 28). 
After discharge, the patient will proceed to the next scheduled outpatient TC follow-up visit. 
(Thus, if a patient remains hospi[INVESTIGATOR_119813] 28, the Day 28 TC follow-up visit need not be conducted.) 
4.1.2. Study Completion 
The study will be considered complete when the last patient completes the Day 60 TC Follow-up 
visit and any necessary follow-up for Jo -1 Ab positivity or ongoing study drug- related TEAEs 
has been completed.  
4.2. Discussion of Study Design  
Single and repeated doses of ATYR1923 were found to be safe and well tolerated in a in healthy 
volunteers and patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. No significant immunogenic responses (induction of ADAs or Jo-1 Ab positivity) were observed following the administration of single or repeated doses of ATYR1923. The PK of a single dose of ATYR1923 was well characterized 
and demonstrated dose-proportional exposures over the range of doses from 0.03 to 5 mg/kg following IV drug administration. Terminal elimination phases were parallel, and the mean half-
life was consistent from the 0.1 mg/kg onwards, with mean values ranging from 167 to 
242 hours.  
These data sup port the continued clinical evaluation of ATYR1923, a novel molecular entity that 
acts as an extracellular immunomodulator and is under development for treatment of ILD. A 
strong scientific rationale exists to investigate ATYR1923 as a treatment for patien ts with s evere 
pneumonia related to SARS -CoV-2 infection (COVID-19), a heavily compromised patient 
population representing a significant unmet medical need. Several design features have been employed in the current study in an effort to minimize bias, 
including a double-blind design, with patients randomized to treatment with ATYR1923 1 mg/kg,  3 mg/kg , or placebo. Random assignment of patients avoids bias and helps ensure that 
both known and unknown risk factors are distributed evenly between treatment groups. The use of placebo control permits prospective comparison between the ATYR1923 groups and the control group.  
This study will be conducted at multiple -study centers. This multi-center design is needed not 
only for efficient enrollment of the required number of patients, allowing for a more efficient 
evaluation of ATYR1923, but it provides a better basis for the subsequent generalization of study findings ( ICH, 1998 ).

Version 5.0  The current study is specifically designed, with the inclusion of detailed safety measures, to 
evaluate these parameters in patients with  severe pneumonia related to  SARS -CoV-2 infection 
(COVID -19).  
Patients will be evaluated  for 60 days after study drug exposure.  
The development of humoral immune responses (formation of Ab) to exogenously administered proteins occurs commonly. ATYR1923 is a protein- based therapeutic; specifically, it is a human 
59-amino acid protein (ie, iMod) directly fused to the C-terminus Fc region of human IgG1, and 
exists as an Fc fusion dimer. The immunogenicity assessments in clinical ATYR1923 studies include assessment of both ADA and Jo-1 Ab, the Ab that recognizes HARS, with lo ss of 
immune tolerance to HARS being associated with anti-synthetase syndrome. No significant immunogenic responses ( persistent induction of ADAs or Jo-1 Ab positivity) have been observed 
in patients participating in an ATYR1923 clinical study to date. However,  ADA have occurred 
infrequently in nonclinical studies with ATYR1923 in the rat and non-human primate. ADA did not affect the PK of the drug. Thus, ADAs may be observed in the current clinical study. Accordingly, the study design includes ADA and Jo-[ADDRESS_778757] Investigators in the clinical management of patients in whom immunogenicity oc curs (see Section 9.9).  
The Investigator will take all the usual medical safety precautions necessary for studies at an early stage in the development of a new drug and has full discretion to stop study drug infusion at any time, if clinically warranted, or otherwise in the patient’s best interest ( Section 6.4).

This will be a multi-center study. Each study center is required to obtain Institutional Review Board (IRB) and regulatory approval to conduct the study before enrollment of patients may commence. Patients meeting the study entry criteri a will be eligible for enrollment.  
Tyr Pharma, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol Number ATYR1923-C-[ADDRESS_778760] met all eligibility criteria will receive a unique Screening  number 
according to the Screening  order. Then, prior to dosing, each patient will be allocated a 
randomization number according to their chronological order of inclusion in the study. This number will correspond to a treatment (ATYR1923 or placebo) as specified on the pre-determined randomization schedule.  
The master randomization schedule will be made of randomly permuted blocks of appropriate 
sizes, as determined by [CONTACT_139642]. The schedule will be generated electronically.  
For patients who are replaced, the replacements should take the same treatment assignment as the original patient to ensure that the treatment groups stay balanced. 
The randomization code will be produced within the interactive web response system (IWRS). 
The study center pharmacist  or designated unblinded study team member will be provided access 
to the randomizatio n code within the IWRS. The laboratory where the PK samples are to be 
analyzed will also be provided access to distinguish between samples of patients dosed with ATYR1923 versus placebo. 
Patients who withdraw for any reason without completing all Screening  evaluations successfully, 
will be considered “screen failures”. Such patients will have a limited number of electronic case 
report forms (eCRFs) completed.  
6.2. Patient Management  
All patients or their designated legal representatives must provide informed consent before the 
performance of any study -related procedure. Patients eligible for the study will be randomized 
within 24 hours before study drug administration on Day  1 and will receive a single dose of 
study drug (either ATYR1923 or placebo), according to their treatment assignment on a double-blind basis. Patients will have post- treatment follow -up visit assessments performed for [ADDRESS_778761] be permanently discontinued for a patient if any of the following 
events occur:  
• A SAE that has a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship with the study drug. 
• A severe IRR that includes cardiac and/or respi[INVESTIGATOR_139593] (see Section 9.9 for 
Management of IRRs) . 
• Patient request to discontinue study drug dosing for any reason. 
• Other findings that, at the discretion of the Investigator and/or Sponsor, indicate that study 
drug a dministration should be discontinued. 
The Investigator has full discretion to stop study drug infusion at any time, if clinically warranted or in the patient’s best interest.  
All patients  who have been dosed with any amount of s tudy drug will continue to be followed for 
safety . Patients  who discontinue s tudy drug dosing at any time during the treatment period 
should return to the study center for the post treatment follow- up visits and as clinically 
indicated.  
Patients  who withdraw their consent will not re ceive any further  study drug, but will be offered 
all follow -up safety  assessments .  
If a subject fails to attend scheduled study assessments, the Investigator must determine and document the reasons and the circumstances as completely and accurately as possible. 
6.4.2. Replacement of Patients  
If a patient is withdrawn from the study for any reason, whether related to the study drug or not, or if a patient voluntarily withdraws before or after receiving the study drug, such patient will be considered an early -termination patient.  
Investigator will make every effort to ensure that early -termination patients who have received 
study drug complete the safety follow up assessments. 
Patients who are randomized and do not receive study drug will be replaced at the Sponsor’s 
discretion. The decision regarding the replacement of patients will be documented. 
Tyr Pharma, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol Number ATYR1923-C-[ADDRESS_778762] the right to d iscontinue from the study and withdraw 
consent at any time for any reason, without prejudice to their medical care. The Investigator also 
has the right to withdraw patients from the study for any of the following reasons: 
• Patient non-adherence to study drug or protocol requirements. 
• Patient unwillingness to continue in the study. 
• Any other reason, based upon the medical judgment of the Investigator. 
The reason for study withdrawal is to be documented in the patient’s source documents and 
electronic case rep ort form (eCRF ). 
At the time of discontinuation from the study, patients are to have all the assessments planned for the final follow -up visit performed after the last study drug dose, if feasible.  
6.5. Study Completion  
A patient is considered to have complete d the study if they completed all dosing and all follow -
up visits. 
6.6. Study Termination  
If the Sponsor or Investigator discovers conditions arising during the study that suggest the study should be halted, then this can happen only after appropriate consultation between the Sponsor and Investigator. Conditions that may warrant study termination include, but are not limited to: 
• The discovery of any unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to the patients enrolled in 
the study. 
• Insufficient adherence to the protocol requirements. 
• A decision on the part of the Sponsor to discontinue the Study 
• A decision on the part of the Sponsor to suspend or discontinue development of ATYR1923. 
6.7. Investigator Compliance  
If the study center deviates significantly from the protocol, the center may be discontinued from the study. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of all research records, the accountability of Study Drug, and the conduct of clinical and laboratory evaluations as outlined in the protocol.

Version 5.0  7. STUDY DRUG  
7.1. Study Drug Dose and Administration  
7.1.1. Treatments Administered  
Patients will be randomly assigned via computer- generated randomization lis t to 1 of 3 treatment 
groups at a 1:1:1 ratio as follows: 
• Single dose of ATYR1923 1 mg/kg 
• Single dose of ATYR1923 3 mg/kg 
• Single dose of placebo. 
It is planned that study drug will be administered as an IV infusion. 
The patient’s weight will be used to calculate the ATYR1923 dose. No patient will receive an 
absolute dose >800 mg. If there is a weight change >10%  between Day -3 and Day 1, the dose 
should be recalculated. 
7.1.2. Identity of Investigational Products 
[IP_ADDRESS]. ATYR1923  
The ATYR1923 Drug Product is a sterile, cl ear to slightly opalescent, colorless to slightly 
yellow, preservative-free liquid concentrate for IV administration. ATYR1923 Drug Product 
(3.8 mL fill volume) is supplied in a single -use borosilicate glass vial, stoppered with 
bromobutyl rubber stopper ( with FluroTec coating), and sealed with aluminum Flip -off® seal. 
The formulation of ATYR1923 Drug Product contains 25 mg/mL ATYR1923, 20 mM L-histidine, 125 mM sodium chloride, 3% sucrose, 10 mM L -methionine, and 0.02% polysorbate 
20 at pH 6.9.  
ATYR1923 will be administered to patients by [CONTACT_139644] 0.9% 
sterile sodium chloride solution, [LOCATION_002] Pharmacopeia (USP) , as outlined in the study 
Pharmacy Manual.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Placebo  
Placebo used in this study will be 0.9% sterile sodium chloride solution, USP.  
Placebo will be administered to patients by [CONTACT_590823].  
7.1.3. Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups  
After obtaining informed consent, patients will be screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria . Patients who are determined to be eligible, based on Screening  assessments, 
will be randomized on a 1:1:1 basis in a blinded fashion to 1 of 3 treatment groups (ATYR1923

Version 5.0  1 mg/kg, ATYR1923 3 mg/kg, or placebo) via the computer- generated randomization list. 
Patients who are randomized are considered enrolled in the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Criteria for Pausing Enrollment  
In the event that a serious unexpected suspected adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) has occurred, the 
enrollment and initiation of study drug administration to new patients will be paused and the Sponsor will request an unblinded review by [CONTACT_4318], who will provide its recommendation to aTyr Pharma. Such recommendation may include, but is not limited to, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_27823], continuing the study as planned, or continui ng the study with modifications . 
In addition, if unexpected, clinically significant trends or changes in other safety assessments are identified during routine safety reviews the Sponsor may request the DSMB to similarly perform a review and provide recommendations.  
7.1.4. Selection of Doses in the Study  
To date, [ADDRESS_778763] been exposed to ATYR1923 at doses ranging from 0.03 
to 5.0 mg/kg in a first- in-human clinical study. In addition, [ADDRESS_778764] participated in an ongoing multiple -dose study. At the time of this document, 
enrollment in Cohorts 1 and 2 (ATYR1923 1 and 3 mg/kg) has been complete, with DSMB review of blinded data performed. (As the data remain blinded, the number of patients exposed to ATYR1923 is unknown, but, based on the randomization scheme, is assumed to be approximately 16). Doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg are estimated to be pharmacologically  active.  
To date, no deaths or study drug- related SAEs have been reported  with ATYR 1923. No apparent 
dose relationship was seen across the range of doses studied with regard to the incidence of TEAEs. Adverse reactions reported to date include back pain, Candida infection, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, migraine, productive cough, rash pruritic, sinus congestion, and urticaria.  
No ATYR1923-treated subject in Study ATYR1923-C- [ADDRESS_778765], who experienced 
mild, transient symptoms of dizziness, abdominal pain, and “feeling cold” followed by [CONTACT_590824]. A patient with pulmonary sarcoidosis in Study ATYR1923-C-002 also experienced events considered representative of an IRR, with this patient similarly experiencing mild transient symptoms of dizzines s as well as back pain. Other symptoms included a generalized warm 
sensation and tingling. As data from this study remain blinded, it is unknown whether this patient was exposed to ATYR1923. 
No patient participating in an ATYR1923 clinical study was positi ve for ADA or Jo -1 Ab after 
study drug exposure. Given that doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg have been tolerable in both healthy volunteers and patients 
with pulmonary sarcoidosis and are predicted to be pharmacologically active, these dose levels 
were selected for use in the current study.

Version 5.0  7.1.5. Blinding  
The following controls will be employed to maintain the double-blind status of the study: 
• The infusion solution for patien ts assigned to active drug and placebo will be 
indistinguishable in appearance. 
• The study center pharmacist or designated unblinded study team member will have 
access to random treatment assignments via IWRS for dispensing purposes; treatment 
assignments will be accessible only to the pharmacist or designated unblinded study team 
memb er and will be maintained in a blinded fashion. The study drug infusion will be 
labeled by [CONTACT_590825] a blinded manner.  
To manage the patient’s condition in case of a medical emergency, the Investigator (or delegate) is allowed to break the code in order to identify whether a patient received ATYR1923 or placebo. If the blind is broken for an individual patient, the name [CONTACT_139689]. The Sponsor will be informed in case of unblinding. There are no specific antidotes for ATYR1923. Knowledge of whether the patient received ATYR1923 or placebo, may not necessarily help in the care of an individual patient. The need to break the blind must therefore be carefully considered. 
The laboratory where the PK samples are to be analyzed will also be provided access to the 
randomization code within the IWRS to distinguish between samples of patients dosed with ATYR1923 versus placebo. 
7.1.6. Concomitant Medication and Other Restrictions During the Study  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Prohibited or Restricted Concomitant Medications and Substances  
The following treatments and procedures are prohibited prior to and/or during study 
participation, as indicated below:  
• All investigational agents or devices (other than ATYR1923) within 3 months for small molecules and 6 months for biologics, or 5 half-lives (if known) of the agent, whichever is longer, before the first study drug dose and through the duration of study drug treatment.   
• Use of chronic (>30 days) oral corticosteroids for a non- COVID -19-related condition in a 
dose higher than prednisone 10 mg or equivalent per day.

8.3.1. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_590804], time and reason of initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_590805]. During hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the date and time of any change in the patient’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30070], specifically admittance and discharge to the intensive car e unit are also to be recorded. If, 
in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the patient required a higher level of care (ie, admittance to the intensive care unit ) but did not receive due to resource availability, this should be documented.  
8.3.2. WHO Ordinal Scale of Clinical Status  
The patient’s clinical status is to be assessed using the WHO Ordinal S cale (see Appendix 1) at 
the time points designated in Table 1. The WHO Ordinal Scale score is to be deter mined 
between 06:00 and 10:[ADDRESS_778771] to 8:00 hours recorded .  
The date and time of any change in the components of clinical status are to be documented in the patient’s eCRF, including: 
• Change in ambulatory status.  
• Requirement for oxygen (yes/no), and if yes, method of oxygenation (mask/nasal prongs, non-invasive ventilation, or high-flow oxygen; intubation and mechanical ventilation). The volume of oxygen administered is to be captured as a concomitant medic ation (see 
Section 7.1.6). If, in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], a patient required a higher level of 
oxygenation, but did not receive due to resource availability, this should be documented. 
8.3.3. Pulse Oximetry  
To assess eligibility, one measurement of SpO
2 without supplemental oxygen should be 
attempted. If not clinically feasible, obtain the measurement with supplemental oxygen. The corresponding level of supplemental O
2 use is to be recorded in the eCRF at screening to confirm 
eligibility . 
On Day 1, SpO 2 readings will be recorded pre -dose then at 1 and 4 hours (±15 minutes) after the 
start of infusion ( SOI). 
After Day 1, SpO 2 is to be measured per SOC and recorded in the eCRF, as per Table 1.

electrocardiograms  (ECGs) (if perfo rmed per SOC) , vital signs, pulse oximetry, or physical 
examinations are to be recorded as part of the patient’s medical history if occurring prior to start 
of dosing and as an AE if occurring after the start of study drug administration at Day 1, where the finding represents a change from Baseline.  
A TEAE is defined as any event not present prior to (the first) administration of the study drug or 
any event already present that worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to the study drug.  
An AE which occurs prior to (the first) administration of the study drug will be considered a pre-
treatment AE.  
AEs that occur during or within 24 hours after study drug injection should be captured as individual signs and symptoms (eg, dyspnea, rash, flushing) rather than a diagnosis of allergic reaction or IRR.  
Patients will be asked non-leading questions and evaluated to determine the occurrence of AEs. 
All AEs reported or observed spontaneously during the course of the study will be recorded. 
The inten sity of each AE will be rated by [CONTACT_590826] (NCI CTCAE), version 5.0 (available at:  
https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Quick_Reference_8.5x11.pdf ).  
AEs not listed on the NCI CTCAE V5.0 are to be rated by [CONTACT_5256] “mild (Grade 1)”, 
“moderate (Grade 2)”, “severe” (Grade 3), “life -threatening”(Grade 4), or “fatal” (Grade 5).  
The relationship between the AEs and the study drug will be indicated as “ not related”, “unlikely 
related”, “possibly related ”, or “ related ”. AEs assessed as “possibly  related ” or “related ” will be 
considered to be related to the study drug whereas AEs assessed as “not related ” or “unlikely 
related ” will be considered not to be related to the study drug.  
Details on the rating of the severity of the AEs and relationship to the study treatment are given in Section  9.2.

Version 5.0  9. ADVERSE EVENTS  
9.1. Definitions 
9.1.1. Adverse Event  
An AE is defined in the ICH Guideline for GCP as “any untoward medical occurrence in a 
patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment” (ICH E6:1.2).  
Worsening of a pre-existing medical condition, (ie, diabetes, migraine headaches, gout) is to be considered an AE if there is either an increase in severity, frequency, or duration of the condition or an association with significantly worse outcomes. 
Interventions for pretreatment conditions (ie, elective cosmetic surgery) or medical procedures that were planned before study enrollment are not considered AEs. 
In the case of death, only record “Fatal” for  the event causing death. AEs that are ongoing at the 
end of the study or time of death are to be noted as “continuing.”  The Investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining whether an 
abnormal value in an individual patie nt represents a significant change from baseline. In general, 
abnormal laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the Investigator’s judgment) should not be recorded as AEs; however, laboratory value changes requiring therapy or adjustment in prior therapy are considered AEs. 
9.1.2. Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug 
caused the AE. For the purposes of Investigational New Drug Application (IND) safety reporting , “reasonable possibility” and/or at least possibly related means there is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. A ‘suspected adverse reaction’ implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than ‘adverse reaction’, which means any AE caused by a drug.  
9.1.3. Serious Adverse Event  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• is fatal . 
For the purposes of this study, death due to SARS -CoV2 infection is not considered an 
SAE.  
• is life -threatening (ie, places the patient at immediate risk of death) . 
Tyr Pharma, Inc.

CONFIDENTIAL  48 
Version 5.0  • requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (overnight stay) or prolongation of existing 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . 
As all patients are required to be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_590809], 
any event other than SARS -CoV2 infection requiring prolonging of inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5478]/or rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_590810]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_590811] -CoV2 infection is not considered an SAE, provided that it 
did not deteriorate in an unexpected manner during the study. 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity . 
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
• is an important medical event; an important medical event is an event that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_124495], based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the 
definitions for SAEs. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
9.1.4. Unexpected Adverse Event  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or intensity that has been previously observed; or, if an Investigator’s Brochure is not required or avail able, is not consistent with the 
risk information described in the General Investigational Plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amended.  
9.1.5. Serious and Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A S[LOCATION_003]R is any event that meets all 3  of the following definitions: 
1) suspected adverse reaction ( Section  9.1.2);  
2) serious ( Section 9.1.3); and  
3) unexpected ( Section 9.1.4).  
9.2. Adverse Event Assessment  
All AEs will be collected and recorded in this study from the time of initiation of study drug 
administration  through the last visit for a patient. This includes AEs the patient reports 
spontaneously, those observed by [CONTACT_737], and those elicited by [CONTACT_139667]-ended questions during scheduled study center visits. 
AEs that occur during or within [ADDRESS_778776] to the following categories. 
9.2.1. Serious/Non -Serious  
AEs that meet the criteria specified in Section  9.1.3 are to be considered serious. 
9.2.2. Relationship to Study Drug  
This determination is based on the Investigator’s clinical judgment regarding the likelihood that 
the study drug caused the AE and may include consideration of some or all of the following factors:  
• Alternative possible causes of the AE, including the patient’s underlying disease or co-morbid conditions, other drugs, other host and environmental factors; 
• The chronological relationship between the exposure to study drug and the AE;  
• Whether the clinical or laboratory manifestations of the AE are consistent with known actions or toxicity of the study drug;  
• Whether the AE resolved or improved with decreasing the dose or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_35648] ( ie, dechallenge);  
Whether the AE recurred or worsened with re-exposure to the drug ( ie, rechallenge).  
The relationship between the study drug and the AE will be described using one of the following categories  Table 2. 
Table 2: Criteria for Determination of Adverse Event Relationship to Study Drug  
Relationship  Definition  
Related  The study drug is more likely the cause of the AE than other factors  
Possibly Related  There is a reasonable possibility that the study drug is the cause of the AE, 
including that the study drug and another factor(s) are equally likely as causes 
of the AE  
Unlikely Related  Another factor is considered more likely  the cause of the AE than the study 
drug 
Not related  Another factor is considered to be the cause of the AE

Death (Fatal)  To be used for the one AE which, in the judgment of the Investigator, was the 
primary cause of death  
Unknown  There were no observations after the onset (initial observation or report) of the event  
 
9.2.6. Study Drug Action  
For each AE, the Investigator will indicate the action taken regarding the administration of study 
drug per the categories in Table 5. 
Table 5: Study Drug Action Taken as a Result of Adverse E vents  
Action  Definition  
Discontinued (withdrawn)  Study drug was stopped permanently due to the AE  
Dosing Interrupted  Study drug regimen was modified by [CONTACT_590828], but drug was 
not stopped permanently

9.3. Recording Adverse Events  
All AEs occurring from the time of initiation of study drug administration through the last 
follow-up visit, or after the end of the study, if thought to be related to study drug, are to be 
recorded in the source documents and in the eCRF. All AE reports are to contain the following details regarding the AE:  a brief description, onset date and time, resolution date and time, intensity, treatment required, relationship to study drug, action taken with study drug, outcome, and whether the event is classified as serious.

Version 5.0  AEs that occur during or within 24 hours after study drug injection should be captured as 
individual signs and symptoms (eg, dyspnea, rash, flushing) rather than a diagnosis of allergic reaction or IRR.  
9.4. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
SAEs will be collected and recorded throughout the study period, beginning with the signing of the informed consent form ( ICF) through the last follow-up visit, or after the end of the stud y if 
thought to be related to study drug. 
The Investigator must report all SAEs within [ADDRESS_778777] Research 
Organization ( CRO ) Safety Team . 
SAE reporting, including supporting materials, will be performed by [CONTACT_590831] a system approved by [CONTACT_1034]. Detailed training will be provided by [CONTACT_2024] . Contact 
[CONTACT_590832]. A completed SAE report is to be entered into the system approved by [CONTACT_90614] 24 hours of discovering the event. Upon entry into the system, the responsible parties (including Medical Monitor and Safety Reporting Specialist) will be immediately notified.  
The Study Reference Manual will include an emergency back -up paper based reporting system, 
to be used if needed. 
The CRO Safety Team  will immediately (within one business day of receipt) forward the SAE 
report to the Sponsor. The initial report should include at least the following information:  
• Patient’s identification number; 
• Description and date of the event; 
• Criterion for serious; and 
• Preliminary assignment of causality to study drug.  
The Medical Monitor may contact [CONTACT_139674]-up 
information regarding the SAE, as appropriate. 
The Investigator, or designated party, should notify the appropriate IRB of SAEs occurring at the 
study center and other AE reports received from aTyr, in accordance with local procedures and statutes.  
SAEs that are consi dered as possibly or definitely related to the investigational product, and as 
unexpected (ie, S[LOCATION_003]Rs), will be reported to the National Regulatory Authority(ies) and IRB by [CONTACT_13679]’s designee as required by [CONTACT_13762]. Per regulation, any fatal or life -threatening S[LOCATION_003]R will be reported to the Nat ional Regulatory 
Authority(ies)/IRB within 7 calendar days, and additional information within an additional 8 calendar days. The Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee is required to submit any other S[LOCATION_003]R to the National Regulatory Authority(ies) /IRB within [ADDRESS_778778] promptly report to his or her IRB all unanticipated problems involving risks to patients, in accordance with local requirements . This may include death from any cause 
and all SAEs reasonably or possibly associated with the use of study drug according to the IRB’s procedures.  
9.7. Protocol Deviations Due to an Emergency or Adverse Event  
Departures from the protocol will be determined as allowable on a case- by-case basis and only in 
the event of an emergency. The Investigator or other physician in attendance in such an emergency must contact [CONTACT_256221].  
The Medical Monitor, in conjunction with the Investigator, will decide whether the patient should continue to participate in the study. All protocol deviations and reasons for such deviations must be noted in the eCRF. 
9.8. Pregnancy  
Pregnancies occurring while the patient is receiving study drug or within 30 days after the patient’s last dose of ATYR1923 will not be considered serious, but are to be reported using the same procedures as for SAEs described in Section  9.4. 
In the event of a pregnancy, the patient should be referred to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. 
The Investigator will follow the patient until completion of the pregnancy, and must notify the 
Medical Monitor of the outcome within 5 days. The Investigator will provide this information as a follow- up to the initial report.  
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (ie, spontaneous abortion [any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), then the Investigator should report it as such. Furthermore, all neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_778779]-infusion observation period. While these symptoms may be self- limiting, such 
symptoms may signal the possibility of a severe reaction that could escalate into a life -
threatening situation.  
Should a patient develop an IRR the subsequent management will depend on the nature of the IRR. Where the IRR symptoms are not cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_139609] i.e. they comprise cutaneous rash, flushing, burning sensation etc. and are mild to moderate in intensity – the patient may complete the infusion and receive subsequent doses. The patient will need to be observed until 
all symptoms resolve or for 6 hours after the end of the infusion.  
If the IRR symptoms constitute a cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_139610] (hypotension, dyspnea, hypoxia etc.) or 
any severe AE then all further dosing should be stopped for the patient. If necessary, the patient should be transferred to an acute care facility.  
Vital signs, pulse oximetry, and ECGs are to be performed to gather clinical information as soon 
as possib le after the onset of clinical symptoms of a generalized IRR (for instance, immediately 
after cessation of the study drug infusion if such a reaction is seen) and monitored as medically indicated. ECGs should be repeated as medically indicated. 
The following tests and procedures are to be performed 1 to 2 hours after the onset of symptoms: 
• ATYR1923 serum concentrations. 
• Jo-1 and ADA.  
• Tryptase.  
• Complete safety laboratory panel, including urine analysis and urine microscopy. 
• Cytokines/chemokines. 
The Investigator must inform the study Medical Monitor promptly regarding any patient who 
experiences a generalized IRR for additional instruction. Patients who experience generalized IRRs will continue to be monitored / have repeat 
assessments performed at a schedule determined by [CONTACT_590833]. Appropriate follow up for the patient must occur to ensure that there are no late -occurring sequelae.  
Note that in the eCRF, AEs that occur during or within 24 hours after study drug injection should be captured as individual signs and symptoms rather than a diagnosis of allergic reaction or IRR.

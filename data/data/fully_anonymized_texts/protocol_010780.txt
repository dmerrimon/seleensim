Introduction
On 05 Sep 2017, a Partial Clinical H old was placed to thi s study  by [CONTACT_24623] (US) Food 
and Drug Administration ( FDA ). The decisio n by [CONTACT_348879], an ant i
-programmed cell death -1 (PD-1) antibody , in pat ients with 
multiple myelo ma in combinat ion with immuno modulatory  agents. As a result, enrollment 
continued into Arm A only and new subjects received induct ion therapy  (durvalumab + R -
CHOP) after Cy cle 1 regardl ess of diffuse large B -cell lympho ma (DLBCL )cell o f origin (COO )
subtype.Enrollment into Arm B (durvalumab in combinat ion with 
lenalido mide plus rituximab, 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincrist ine, prednisone [R2-CHOP]) wasdiscontinued . Subjects 
enrolled and treated in Arm B prior to the US FDA Partial Clinical Ho ld who were receiving 
clinical benefit, based on the discret ion of the Investigator, couldcontinue study  treatm ent after 
being reconsented. 
Study  enrollment was completed in March 2018.
The protocol -defined pri mary analysis was completed with a data cutoff date of [ADDRESS_433305]’s last durvalumab dose occurred on [ADDRESS_433306]’s 90-day Safety Follow -upVisit was co mpleted. At the time of the data 
cutoff date of the l ast 90 -day Safet y Follow -up Visi t(06 Jun 2019), 30 subjects were in fo llow-
up. No subjects were on treatment with durvalum ab or any  other study  treatm ents.
There are no further plans to eval uate l ong-term efficacy , including overall survival (OS) ,for the 
remaining subjects on study , and n o addi tional statist ical analysis on safet y and efficacy will be 
perform ed. 
Therefore, the Follow -up P eriod will be discont inued, and data collect ionin the clinical database
will stop under this amendment. Subjects who received lenalidomide will continue to be 
followed for second primary  malignancies (SPMs) as required by  [CONTACT_348880] l 
(Secti on3.1.3.1 ) . After stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_348805], any SPM events will cont inue to be collected in the safet y database.

This Phase 2, two-arm, open -label study is designed to evaluate durvalumab in co mbination wit h 
R-CHOP (Arm  A) or in combinat ion with R2-CHOP (Arm  B),followed by [CONTACT_348885] -risk DLBCL (Figure 1).[ADDRESS_433308] ion therapy .Based on their DLBCL COO subtype (ABC v ersus non -ABC )as determined 
by [CONTACT_348886][INVESTIGATOR_157662] (LST) before start of Cycle 2, subjects will be 
allocated to one of two treatment arms1from Cycle 2 onwards :
Induction Therapy (21 -day cycles)
Arm A: Durvalum ab in combination with R -CHOP
Durvalumab 1125 mg int ravenously (IV) on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle in combinat ion 
with 6to8cycles R
-CHOP ( IV rituximab, doxorubicin, vincrist ine,and 
cyclophosphamide on Day 1; daily  oral/IV prednisone/predniso lone from Day 1 to5).
                                               
1As a result of the US FDA Partial Clinical Hold, enrollment continued into Arm A only and new subjects received 
inductio n therapy  (durvalumab + R CHOP) after Cycle 1 regardless of DLBCL COO subtype. Enrollment into 
Arm B (durvalum ab in combination with lenalidomide plus rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, 
vincristine, prednisone [R2 -CHOP]) wasdiscontinued. Subjects enrolled and treated in Arm B prior to the US 
FDA Partial Clinical Hold who were receiving clinical benefit, ba sed on the discretion of the Investigator, could
continue study treatment after being reconsented.

Statistical Methods
The Safety Run -in Stage will be used to determine the tolerabilit y of the addition of  durvalumab 
to the induct ion treatment with R -CHOP until at least [ADDRESS_433319] 
baseline tumor response assessment.
The primary  efficacy  analysis will evaluate the complete response rate (CRR) at the end of the 
inducti on therapy  in the efficacy  eval uable popul ation in a co mparative manner against historical 
control . The key  secondary  efficacy  analysis will evaluate the rate of subjects who continue 
conso lidation therapy  out of  all subjects in the efficacy  evaluable popul ation in a comparative 
manner against historical control .
If null hypothesis on primary endpo int is rejected, hypothesis testing on the key  secondary
endpo int will be performed hierarchically wit hout any t ype I error adjustment.
Analysis of secondary  efficacy  endpoints will  include further analysis of response and 
progression data ,and in particular those data related to biomarkers predict ive of respon se to 
study  treatm ent.

Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochures (IB s) of lenalido mide and durvalumab for detailed 
inform ation concerning the available pharmaco logy, toxi cology, drug m etabo lism, clinical trials, 
and AE profiles of these Investigational Products (IP).
On 05 Sep 2017, a Partial Clinical H old was placed to thi s study  by [CONTACT_24623] (US) Food 
and Drug Administration ( FDA ). The decisio n by [CONTACT_348879] ,an ant i
-programmed cell death -1 (PD-1) antibody , in pat ients with 
multiple myelo ma in combinat ion with immuno modulatory  agents. As a result, enrollment 
continued into Arm A only
 and new subjects received induct ion therapy  (durvalumab + R -
CHOP) after Cy cle 1 regardl ess of diffuse large B -cell lympho ma (DLBCL ) cell  or ori gin(COO )
subtype. Enrollment into Arm B (durvalumab in combinat ion with lenalido mide plus rituximab, 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincrist ine, prednisone [R2-CHOP]) wasdiscontinued . Subjects 
enrolled and treated in Arm B pri or to the US FDA Parti al Clinical  Hold who were receiving 
clinical benefit, based on the discret ion of the Investigator, may continue study  treatm ent after 
being reconsented. 
Study  enrollment was completed in March 2018.
The protocol -defined pri mary analysis was completed with a data cutoff date of02 Aug 2018,
and the last subject’s last durvalumab dose occurred on [ADDRESS_433341]’s 90-day Safety Follow -upVisit was com pleted. At the time of the data 
cutoff date of the l ast 90 -day Safet y Follow -up Visi t (06 Jun 2019), [ADDRESS_433342] ionin the clinical database
will stop under thi s amendment. Subj ects who received lenalidomide will continue to be 
followed for second primary  malignancies (SPMs) as required by  [CONTACT_348888]  
(Secti on3.1.3.1 ) . After stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_348805], any SPM events will cont inue to be collected in the safet y database.  
1.1. Diffuse Large B -cell Lymphoma
Diffuse large B -cell lympho mais a distinct histological t ype within mature B -cell non-Hodgkin’s 
lympho ma (NHL) that accounts for approximately 31% of all newly diagnosed malignant 
lympho mas ( Armitage, 1998 ), and is characterized by  [CONTACT_348889] .
In most countri es worl dwide, the standard of care treatment for newly diagnosed DLBCL 
consists of CHOP (cy clophosphamide, doxorubi cin, vincrist ine, and prednisone) chemotherapy 
in combinat ion with the ant i
-CD20 m onocl onal antibody  rituximab (R-CHOP; Feugier, 2005 ; 
Ketterer, 2013 ). In a study  com paring R -CHOP with CHOP as front -line therapy in elderly 
subjects wi th DLBCL, treatm ent wi th R-CHOP achieved a 5 -year event -free survival (EFS) of

(Feugier, 2005).
R-CHOP -21 (R-CHOP given in 21 -day cycles) as the current standard of care in this disease 
setting has not been replaced by [CONTACT_348890] -intensified or dose -
dense regimens such as dose -intensive rituximab, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vindesine, 
bleomycin, prednisone (R -ACVBD), dose -adjusted etoposi de, prednisone, vincrist ine, 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, rituximab (DA -EPOCH -R), ri tuximab, cyclophosphamide,

dexamethasone, methotrexate cy tarabine (R -HyperCVAD) ( Ketterer, 2013 ; Micallef, 2011 ; 
Recher, 2011).
Considering the overall DLBCL populat ion,approximately  50% to 60% of pati ents achieve a 
long-lasting complete response (CR) following R -CHOP and can be considered cured 
(Feugier, 2005
; Mic allef, 2011 ).In contrast , those 40% to 50% of DLBCL patients who are 
refractory  or who progress or rel apse following R -CHOP, have only limited treatment options 
and a poor overall clinical outcome, most of them dying within two y ears. Furtherm ore, DLBCL 
p
atients wi th an increased disease risk ( Secti on1.2) have a poorer outcome after R -CHOP 
therapy  than the overall DLBCL patient populat ion.
Therefore , patients who do not achieve a durable CRremain an unmet medical need and the 
evaluat ion of n ew treatment strategies is warranted.
1.2. Clinical and Biological Prognostic Factors
1.2.1. International Prognostic Index (IPI) and National Comprehensive Cancer 
Network International Prognostic Index (NCCN -IPI)
The IPI [INVESTIGATOR_32005] (Appendix F)is an important prognostic tool developed utilizing clinical 
characterist ics from more than 1,000 aggressive lympho ma patients treated with CHOP -like 
chemotherapy ( The Internat ionalNon-Hodgkin’s Lympho ma Prognostic Factors Project, 1993 ). 
Although developed in the pre
-rituximab era, the IPI i s still applicable and ut ilized today. Five 
clinical characterist ics (age, lactic acid dehydrogenase [ LDH ], number of extra nodal sites, Ann 
Arbor stage, and ECOG performance status) are used to stratify pat ients into the following 4 risk 
categori es:
Low-risk (0 -1)
Low-intermediate risk (2)
High-intermediate ri sk (3)
High-risk (4 -5).
The NCCN- IPI [INVESTIGATOR_348808] (Appendix F ) is an enhanced IPI [INVESTIGATOR_348809] m clinical 
data of 1,650 patients with DLBCL treated during the rituximab era between 2000 -2010 
(Zhou, 2014). Five predictors (age, LDH, sites of invo lvement, Ann Arbor stage, and ECOG 
perform ance status) were i dentified and a m aximum  of 8 points assigned, and pat ients are

1.2.2. Cell of Origin
Diffuse large B -cell lympho ma is co mposed primarily o f two biologically dist inct patho-
physio logic ent ities (Alizadeh, 2000 ) derived from different cells o f origin which can be 
classified by [INVESTIGATOR_15853] e expressi on profiling (GEP): germinal center B -cell (GCB) type and ABC t ype.
Subsequently, an addit ional type III was i dentified by [CONTACT_187024] ( Rosenwald ,
2002), whi ch has since 
been renamed as unclassifiable t ype. In contrast , the less precise method of 
immunohistochemistry  (IHC) resul ts in group ingABC and unclassifiable together as the 
non
-GCB t ypeand thus different iates between GCB and non -GCB only .The Lympho ma/
Leukemia Mo lecular Profiling Project reported approximately 60% GCB and 40% non-GCB in 
240newly diagnosed DLBCL subject biopsy samples examined by [CONTACT_187024] ( Fu, 2008; 
Lossos , 2004; Rosenwald, 2002 ).
The different DLBCL ty pes have been reported to have different clinical outcomes with CHOP 
(Rosenwald, 2002
) and R -CHOP ( Fu, 2008) therapy. In the first -line setting with CHOP therapy , 
the 5-year OS rates for the GCB, unclassifiable, and ABC t ypes were 60%, 39%, and 35%, 
respectively  (Rosenwald, 2002). With R -CHOP, the 3 -year EFS for GCB and non -GCB subt ypes 
was 67% and 52% ,respectively, and the 3 -year OS was 85% and 69%, respectively ( Fu, 2008). 
With R-CHOP and predo minant ly higher ri sk pat ients (IPI 0 -1 = 21%, IPI 2- 3 = 63%, and IPI 
4-5 = 15%) ,the median PFS for the ABC t ype was 1.5 years ( Lenz, 2008).
Gene expressio n profiling on fresh tissue biopsy samples was considered a gold standard for the 
characterizat ion of the COO in DLBCL. However, defining the COO via GEP is current ly 
neither part of the routine diagnost ic work -up in clinical practice, nor a practical method for 
subje ct sel ection in clinical trials due to the requirement of a fresh biopsy sample and the 
substant ia
l time and techno logical expertise required to perform standard GEP and analysis.
In thi s clinical study , a GEP -based assay will be used to ident ify the COO . The NanoString 
Lympho ma subt ypi[INVESTIGATOR_157662] (LST) assay , which is based on the NanoString 20-gene assay for 
COO subtypi[INVESTIGATOR_348811], will be used. The LST assay  profiles formalin-fixed 
paraffin -embedded (FFPE) tissue u sing the previo usly reported 20 -g
ene Lymph2Cx algorithm on 
the nCounter®Dx analysis platform .Although this assay is technically verified, it has not 
received marketing approval by a healt h authorit ybeyo nd being Conformité Européenne (CE) 
marked in the European Union (EU).
The NanoStrin g 20-gene assay was verified against the ori ginal  COO m odel defined by  [CONTACT_210833] 
(Lenz, 2008) using an independent cohort of 68 FFPE biopsies. In the validation cohort, the 
assay was found to be accurate with only one case with def initive COO that

1.2.3. Immune -checkpoint Inhibition
The intratum oral microenvironment in B-cell lympho ma includes tumor -infiltrat ing lymphocy tes 
(TILs) which are T -cells that appear to be specific for the malignant B -cell cloneand,thus
,have 
the capacit y to control  the growth of the lympho ma(Dunn, 2004 , Gooden, 2011). However, 
these T -cells have been found to have decreased proliferat ive capacit y and effector funct ion 
(Gitelson, 2002 , Hilchey, 2009 ), whi ch coul d explain their inabilit y to attack and eradicate the 
malignant B cells. Chronic and prolonged activation may cause so me T -cells to beco me 
“exhausted” and other T -cells to acquire expressio n of inhibitory  receptors (egprogrammed cell 
death -1 [PD-1], programmed cell death ligand -1 [PD-L1]) and beco me suppressive cells 
(Zhi-Zhang, 2015 ), a pheno menon also known as “adaptive immune resistance” ( Tum eh, 2014 ).
Engagement of TIL cell- surface receptors with these inhibitory  ligands leads to a dy sfunct ional 
immune response, causes T -cell exhaust ion, and facilitates tumor progression ( Baitsch, 2012 ;
Crespo, 2013 ).
Novel  monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that block these inhibitory  receptors have shown 
significant clinical activit y across a number of tumor ty pes ( Wolchok, 2009 ;Hodi , 2010 ;
Robert, 2011; Brahmer , 2010; Topalian, 2012 ).Specifically, blockade o f immune -checkpo int 
inhibitors such as cy totoxi c T-lymphocy te-associ ated ant igen 4 (CTLA -4), PD -1, and PD -L1 
have shown clinical act ivity not only in convent ionally  immune -responsive tum ors such as 
melano ma and renal cell carcino ma but also in non -small cell lung cancer ( Brahmer, 2010
;
Brahmer, 2012; Topalian, 2012 ;Gordon, 2013 ) and prostate cancer ( Harzstark, 2010 ). 
1.2.4. PD-L1/PD -[ADDRESS_433347] ive biomarker associated with a poorer overall survival (OS) in DLBCL pat ients 
treated with R -CHOP ( Rossille, 2014 ). These findings were confirmed in two addit ional 
databases in Australia and the U.S. and were found to be independent of IPI [INVESTIGATOR_348812] ( Fest, 2014).
Furtherm ore, i t has been shown that PD -L1expression on DLBCL cells is an independent 
(negat ive) prognostic factor for OS and that the number of PD -1 posi tive TILs is significant ly 
associ ated wi th PD-L1 posit ivity of lympho ma cells and tumor infiltrating non -malignant 
strom al cells ( Kiyasu, 2015). In addition, PD -1 expressio n in peripheral blood CD4+ and CD8+ 
T-cells were found to be markedly different between chronic lymphocy tic leukemia ( CLL)
disease stages when compared with healthy subjects ( Novak, 2015 ).
Apreclinical mant le-cell lymphom a (MCL) m odel dem onstrated that PD -L1 expressed on MCL 
cells inhibited T -cell pro liferat ion, impaired ant igen-specific T- cell responses, and rendered 
MCL cells resistant to T -cell mediated cy tolysis wh ich coul d be reversed by  [CONTACT_348891] -associ ated PD -L1 (Wang, 2013).

1.3. Compound Background 
1.3.1. Durvalumab (MEDI4736)
Durvalumab (MEDI4736) is a human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1к monoclo nal ant ibody  (mAb) 
that blocks PD -L1 by [CONTACT_348892] i ts receptors, all owing T -cells to recognize and kill 
tumor cells .Durvalumab select ively binds to human PD -L1 wi th high affinit y blocking its abili ty 
to bind to PD -1 and cluster of different iation (CD) 80. The fragment cry stallizable (Fc) domain 
of durvalumab contains a tr iple mutation in the constant dom ain o f the IgG1 heavy  chain that 
reduces binding to the complement component C1q and the Fcγ receptors responsible for 
mediat ing antibody -dependent cell -mediated cy totoxi city (ADCC) ( Oganesyan, 2008; 
Ibrahim, 2015).
On 01 May 2017, the US FDA granted accel erated approval to durvalumab (IMFINZI™) for the 
treatm ent of patients with locally  advanced or m etastati c urothelial carcino ma patients who have 
disease progressi on during or following plat inum- containing chemotherapy  or who have disease 
progression wit hin 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with plat inum -containing 
chemotherapy.
Please refer to the durvalumab IB for further informat ion.
1.3.2. Lenalidomide
Lenalido mide (Revlimid®) is a m ember of theclass of  immuno modulatory  drugs (IMi D®) and 
has potent immuno -stimulatory , antiangiogenic, and pro -apoptotic activit ies in vitro.
In the US, l enalido mide has been approved for the treatm ent of patients with:
Multiple myel oma (MM) in combinat ion with dexam ethasone
Maintenance MM therapy  following autol ogous hematopoi etic stem cell transplantation
Transfusio n-dependent anemia due to low -or intermediate -
1-risk myelodysplast ic 
syndro mes (MDS) associated with a deletion 5q abnormalit y with or without addit ional 
cytogeneti c abnorm alities
MCL whose di sease has rel apsed or progressed after two prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], one of which

1.4. Rationale
1.4.1. Rationale for Study Design
Patients wi th high -risk DLBCL ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_348813]. Therefore, the 
addition of  novel  agents to the currently  used inducti on therapy  (R-CHOP backbone) is a 
rationale
approach to improve therapeutic outcomes in this disease setting.
1.4.2. Rationale for Backbone Therapy (R -CHOP, R2 -CHOP)
Treatment with R -CHOP i s currently the most commo nly used induct ion therapy  for pati ents 
with previ ously untreated DLBCL .
Patients wi th non-GCB -DLBCL have a worse outcome thanGCB -like DLBCL when treated 
with R-CHOP . Importantly , clinically  meaningful  improvements in CRrate and PFS were seen 
in two recent Phase 2 trials in pat ients with non-GCB -DLBCL who were treated with 
lenalido mide in co mbinat ion with R-CHOP (R2- CHOP) when co mpared with histori cal 
R-CHOP -21 data ( Nowakowski, 2015; Chiapella, 2012).
In the REAL07 Phase2 study  with R2-CHOP conducted by  [CONTACT_941] I talian Lympho ma Stud y Group 
FIL ( Chiapella, 2012; Vitolo, 2014 ), Overall Response Rate was 92% and the CR rate was 86%. 
The 2 -year PFS was 81% (95% confidence interval [ CI], 51% to 93%) in patients with non- GCB 
disease and 71% ( 95% CI, 51% to 93%) in those wit h GCB disease (HR 0.78, 95% CI ,0·21 to
2·90; p=0.705).
Ina Phase 2 study  with R2-CHOP conducted by  [CONTACT_299781] o Clinic ( Nowakowski , 2015 ), the 
overall response rate ( ORR )was 98 % with a CR rate of 80%. Event -free survival and overall 
survival (OS) rates at 24 months were 59% (95% CI, 4 8 to 74) and 78% (95% CI, 68 to 90), 
respectively .
In a histori cal comparison wi th patients treated with R- CHOP, the 24 -month progression -free 
survival (PFS) and OS were 28% versus 64% and 46% versus 78% in non -GCB DLBCL versus 
GCB DLBCL, respect ively, und erlining the worse outcome of non-GCB -DLBCL patients who 
aretreated wi th R-CHOP .
In contrast, no significant changes in outcome were noted in GCB -like DLBCL pat ients 
receiving R2- CHOP. When co mpared with pat ients treated with R -CHOP, there was no 
difference in 24- month PFS or OS for R2 -CHOP patients on the basis of non -GCB and GCB 
subtype (60% v ersus 59% and 83% v ersus 75%, respect ively).

1.4.3. Rationale for Investigational Product
Based on the described pre -clinical and clinical observat ionsrelated to the PD -1/PD -L1 pathway , 
it is hypothesized that durvalumab will have activit y in DLBCL. In particular, the addi tion of  
durvalumab may significant ly augme nt the anti -tumor activi ty of R-CHOP against high -risk 
DLBCL subt ypes.
The safet y of durvalumab has already  been expl ored and assessed in other hematology  and 
oncol ogy patient populat ions, and no dose limit ing toxicit y (DLT) has been defined to date. 
However, as there is limited clinic al experience with durvalumab as mo notherapy  in DLBCL and 
none wit h durvalumab in co mbinat ion with R-CHOP or R2 -CHOP as first -line therapy of 
DLBCL, the design of this Phase 2 study  includes a Safety Run -in Stage .
1.4.4. Rational e for Dose, Schedule, and Regimen
The dos ingschedule of 20mg/kg once every  4weeks ( Q4W )for durval umab wasselected based 
on the safety  analysis of doses (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg once every  2 weeks [ Q2W ]) 
administered in Study  CD ON-MEDI4736-1108 and p harm acokinetics ( PK)profile simulat ions 
for durvalumab administered using 10 mg/kg Q2W and 20 mg/kg Q4W schedules.
Population PK analysis indicated only minor impact of body  weight on PK of durvalumab 
(coefficient of ≤ 0.5). The impact of body  weight -based (10 mg/kg Q2W) and fixed dosing 
(750 mg Q2W) of durvalumab was evaluated by [CONTACT_178536] (5thmedian, and 95thpercentiles) using the populat ion PK model. A fixed dose of 
750 m g was selected to approximate 10 mg/kg (based on median body weight of 75 kg).
Simulation results o f 1,000 patients using body  weights ranging fro m 40to 120 kg demonstrated 
that body  weight -based and fixed -dosing regimens yield similar median steady  state PK 
concentrations with slightly less overall between -subjec t variabilit y with the fixed- dosing 
regimen.
As it is therefore considered feasible to use a fixed -dosing regimen , 
and as a fixed -dosing 
approach i s generally  preferred by  [CONTACT_72959] y due to ease of use and reduced 
dosing errors, the current studywill usea fixed dose of 1125 mgdurvalumab Q3W (21-day 
cycles during induct ion therapy ) and 1500 mg durvalumab Q4W (28-day cycles during 
conso lidation therapy ),both being equivalent to 20 mg/kg Q4W.
1.4.5. Rationale for Biomarkers 
The key  specific translat ional quest ion in thisstudy is whether the COO status or other 
biomarkers in DLBCL are associated with response to durvalumab in combinat ion with either
R-CHOP orR2-CHOP .

Confident ial and Propri etary 27 MEDI4736 -DLBCL -001 Amendment 4 Final: [ADDRESS_433352] ivity of immune checkpo int inhibitors ( Topalian 2012 ; Herbst, 2014 ).More recent 
data indicates that a combinat ion of elevated PD -L1 protein expression and elevated interferon 
[IFN] gene expressio n in pretreatment tumor biopsies may predict the best response to 
durvalumab monotherapy  (Higgs, 2015 , Higgs 2016 ).
Experi ence of durvalumab in solid tumors showed that greater responses were observed in 
subjects wi th PD-L1-positive, and a much lower rate of responses in subjects with PD -L1-
negat ive tumors ( Segal, 2014 ). Thus, continued evaluat ion of these bio markers and a broad
explorat ion of addit ionalbiomarkers related to immuno logical and disease factors are needed to 
help the ident ificat ion of potential predictive bio markers for the therapy .
The predi ctive biomarker data analysis will proceed in three stages. In the first stage, public ally
available data, li terature, and propri etary  data assets of rel evance will be analyzed to generate 
and refine predictive bio marker hypotheses. During the second stage, bio marker data will be 
analyzed as it is generated for this study  and pre -specified hypotheses -related predictive 
biomarkers and immune mechanism of act ion will be tested. Lastly, after the bio marker, clinical 
and outcom e data from  the study is completed, final conclusio ns will be made on the pre -
specified hypotheses and hypotheses for te sting in future studies will be defined.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Rationale for Pharmacodynamic Biomarker Assays 
A key  scientific object ive of this clinical study is to evaluate the dynamic changes in the 
microenvironment of the tumor. While understanding the immuno logic characte ristics at baseline 
may be both predictive and prognostic, it will be extremely crit ical to understand the changes in 
the local immune system  following treatm ent wi th durvalumab and the co mbination agents.
Biomarker analysis of durvalumab in non -small  cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients dem onstrated 
a stati stically significant increase in CD8+ infiltrating lymphocy tes from on-treatment tumor 
samples co mpared with pre -treatm ent bi opsies (Rizvi, 2015 ).Furthermore, durvalumab treat ment 
induced IFNγ and effector T cell and Th -1gene expressio n withinNSCLC bi opsies wi thin 
8weeks of treatment ( Higgs, 2016 ), indicat ing a higher level o ftumor microenvironment.
This data is consistent with the Pdeffects o bserved in tumor biopsies from pat ients treated with 
atezolizumab (a PD -L1 inhibitor) and pembro lizumab (a PD -1 inhibitor). For pembrolizumab, 
increasing o f CD8+ densit y at tum or or invasive margin after treatment is observed in responders 
while absent in progressors in melano ma, indicat ing that the CD8+ TILs were activated and 
targeting the tumor ( Tumeh, 2014 ).Serial biopsy  analyses for atezolizumab showed that 
increases in PD -L1 protein expressio n and genes indicat ive of act ivated T cells (eggranzyme, 
IFN) were m ore frequent ly observed in patients who respond to the therapy co mpared with the 
non-responders ( Herbst ,
2014 ).Notably, while pharmacodynamic response to durvalumab and 
atezolizumab can also be observed in the blood, circulat ing biomarkers have not been shown to
be correlated with response.

Confident ial and Propri etary 32 MEDI4736 -DLBCL -001 Amendment 4 Final: [ADDRESS_433360] [ZIP_CODE]. OVERALL STUDY DESIGN
The study  will be conducted in com pliance wi th the International Council forHarm onisati on
(ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceut icals for Hum an Use/Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory  requi rements.
3.1. Study Design
This Phase 2, two- arm, open -label study  is designed to evaluate durvalumab in co mbination w ith 
R-CHOP (Arm  A) or in combinat ion with R2-CHOP (Arm  B),followed by [CONTACT_348885] -risk DLBCL (Figure 1).[ADDRESS_433361] up to 12 months.
The study  is divided into two stages:
A Safety Run-in Stage to eval uate the safet y of the treatm ent combinat ions(by a 
Safety Review Co mmit tee [SRC ], see Section 6.5.2 )until at least 10 subjects are 
included in the Safety Run -in(see Secti on6.5.1 ). Following Partial Clinical Ho ld 
instituted by  [CONTACT_348896] B, the Safety  Run -in Stage will evaluate 
safet y of the treatment Arm A co mbinations when at least [ADDRESS_433362] one cy cle of study  treatm ent or 
discontinued prematurely .
An Expansion Stage to analyze the clinical act ivity of the treatment combinations in 
up to approximately [ADDRESS_433363] anned to be enrolled in tothis study (with approximately 
40subjects in the efficacy evaluable population) . Subjects will be assigned into the appropriate
treatm ent arm s dependent upon their COO status as determined by [CONTACT_187024] .[ADDRESS_433364] signs the written informed consent form (ICF). 
During this period, the subjects will undergo assessments , according to Table 3and Secti on6.[ADDRESS_433365] undergo incisional or excisio nalbiopsies of their 
lympho ma in order to evaluate their tumor microenvironments as well as ot her bio markers .A 
core needl e biopsy  withmultiple passes i sacceptable but not preferred, due to the amount of 
tissue requi redneeded to perform  the necessary  analyses . For subjects unable to provide fresh 
tissue samples ,an archival diagnostic lymph node/tumor formalin fixed paraffin embedded 
                                               
2As a result of the US FDA Partial Clinical Hold, enrollment continued into Arm A only and new subjects received 
inductio n therapy  (durvalumab + R CHOP) af ter Cycle 1 regardless of DLBCL COO subtype. Enrollment into 
Arm B (durvalumab in combination with lenalidomide plus rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, 
vincristine, prednisone [R2 -CHOP]) wasdiscontinued. Subjects enrolled and treated in Arm B prior to the US 
FDA Partial Clinical Hold who were receiving clinical benefit, based on the discretion of the Investigator, could

3.1.2. Treatment Period
Eligible subjects with previously untreated, hi gh-risk DLBCL will receive one cy cle of  induct ion 
therapy  of durvalumab in co mbinat ion with R-CHOP. Based on their DLBCL COO subtype 
(ABC versus non-ABC) as determined by [CONTACT_348897]2, 
subjects will then be allocated to one of two treatment arms from Cycle 2 onwards (or the cy cle 
following COO determinat ion).Eligible subjects for whom the COO has al ready been ident ified 
as ABC subt ype by [CONTACT_348898], m ay have 
lenalid omide added starting wit h C1D1 onwards. Subjects for whom COO determinat ion is 
inconclusive will continue treatment in study  Treatment Arm A.Subjects for whom the COO is 
determined as ABC only  after Cycle [ADDRESS_433367] ion treatment will be administered until disease progression, unacceptable toxicit y or the 
completion of induction treatm ent (6 to 8 cycles) . 
Subjects completing the R-CHOP -based 
induct ion chemotherapy and achieving a CR(or a PR if the Investigator considers this to be a 
sufficient therapeutic response) will then receive consolidat ion therapy  comprised of durvalumab 
monotherapy for up to a total of 12months fro m the date of C1D1 , ie, from the start of the 
induct ion treatment period (Figure 1).Subjects receiving lenalido mide will be fo llowed f or SPM 
for 5years fo llowing enro llment (C1D1) of the last subject enrolled into Arm B (Figure 1

(Cheson, 2014; Appendix B ).
Tumor assessments will be performed by [CONTACT_11856] .There is no central  radiologyreview 
in this clinical study . However, tum or assessment data including images should be made 
available to the Celgene Medical Monitor or desi gnee upon request. Once a subject has 
experienced confirmed progression, no further scans are required.
6.4.1. Efficacy Assessments 
Integrated FDG -PET/CT is pr eferred for response assessment , however ,CT scans are required 
for all tumor assessment and FDG -PET scans are required at Screening and for confirmat ion of 
CR. The imaging modalit y(egCT,MRI and technique for exam ple,use of cont rast, slice 
thickness for scans )used at Screening shoul d be used consistent ly throughout the study for all 
further assessments .
Scans previously acquired as standard of care within 28 days prior to C1D1 may be used to 
fulfill the Screening requirement. Fields missing from archival scans may be imaged separately 
during Screening and the complete set of scans may be used together to fulfill Screening 
requi rements.

This Phase 2, two- arm, open -label study  is designed to evaluate durvalumab in co mbination wit h 
R-CHOP or in combinat ion with R2-CHOP followed by  [CONTACT_348918]- risk DLBCL.
Subjects m eeting the study eligibilit y criteria receive one cycle of induction therapy  of 
durvalumab in co mbinat ion with R-CHOP. Based on their DLBCL Cell -of-Origin subt ype (ABC 
versus non-ABC) as determined by [CONTACT_348919] 2, subjects 
will then be allo cated to one of two treatment arms from Cycle 2 onwards (or the cy cle fo llowing 
COO determinat ion).As a result of the US FDA Partial Clinical Ho ld, enrollment continued into 
Arm A only  and new subjects received induct ion therapy (durvalumab + R CHOP) after Cy cle 1 
regardl ess of DLBCL COO subt ype. Enrollment into Arm B (durvalumab in co mbinat ion with 
R2-CHOP) wasdiscont inued. Subjects enro lled and treated in Arm B prior to the US FDA 
Parti al Clinical Hol d who were receiving clinical benefit, based on the discretion of the 
Invest igator, couldcontinue study  treatm ent after being reconsented. 
Induct ion treatment w ill be administered unt il disease progression, unacceptable toxicit y or the 
completion of induction treatment (6 to 8 cycles) . Subject s com pleting induct ion treatment and 
achieving a CR (or a PR , see details on Secti on7.2.3.1 )will receive conso lidation therapy  
comprised of durvalumab monotherapy  for up to a total  of 12months from C1D1.

Bishop index which can be found in Appendix D (Cairo, 2004) a nd TFR which will be graded 
using NCI-CTCAE Versi on 3.0 .
Dose m odificat ions will not be required for AEs that are clearly not attributable to IPs (such as 
an accident) or for laboratory  abnorm alities that are not determined to be clinically  significant. If 
an AE occurs, the Invest igator should assess whether the AE is attributable to any  of the IPs. If 
the AE i s attributable to any  IP based on the Investigator ’s clinical judgment, then the 
Invest igator will fo llow the dose m odificat ion gui delines for that causative IP(s) provided in 
Secti on7.2.5 .
[IP_ADDRESS]. Dose Modification Guidelines for Durvalumab
Based on the mechanism o f action of  durvalumab leading to T -cell act ivation and proliferat ion, 
there is the possibilit y of observing immune -mediated AEs (i mAEs) during the conduct of this 
study . Potenti al imAEs may be similar to those seen with the use of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], BMS -936558, 
and BMS -936559 and m ayinclude immune -mediated enterocolit is, dermatit is, hepat itis, and 
endocrinopathies ( Hodi , 2010 ; Brahmer, 2012
; Topalian, 2012). Subjects should be monitored
for signs and symptoms of i mAEs.In the absence of an alternate etio logy (eginfect ion or disease 
progression), an immune -mediated etiology shoul d be considered for signs or symptoms of 
enterocolit is, derm atitis, hepat itis, and endocrinopathy.

(Weber, 2012). These guidelines recommend the following:
1.Subjects shoul d be evaluated to i dentify any alternative et iology
.
2.In the absence of clear alternat ive et iology, all events of an inflammatory  nature shoul d 
be considered to be immune -mediated.
3.Symptom atic and topi [INVESTIGATOR_348838] d be considered for low -grade events .
4. S ystemic corti costeroi ds shoul d be considered for a persistent low -grade event or for a 
severe event .
5.More potent immunosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_244836] d be considered for events not 
responding to systemic steroids (eginfliximab, mycopheno late, etc) .

Adverse Events 
(Overall 
Management 
For toxicities 
not noted 
below)Drug administration modifications of study drug/study regimen 
will be made to manage potential immune -mediated AEs based 
on severity of treatment -emergent toxicities graded per NCI 
CTCAE v4.03 .
In addition to the criteria for permanent discontinuation of study 
drug/study regimen based on CTC grade/severity (table below), 
permanently discontinue study drug/study regimen for the 
following condition s: 
Inability to reduce corticosteroid to a dose of ≤10mg of 
prednisone per day  (or equivalent) within [ADDRESS_433486] 
dose of study drug/study regime n
Recurrence of a previously experienced Grade 3 treatment -
related AE fol lowing resumption of dosin gIt is recommended that management of im mune -mediated adverse 
events (im AEs) follows the guidelines presented in this table :
-It is possible that events with an inflammatory or immune 
mediated mechanism could occur in nearly all o rgans, some of 
them not noted specifically in these guidelines .
-Whether specific immune -mediated events (and/or laboratory 
indicators of such events) are noted in these guidelines or not, 
patients should be thoroughly evaluated to rule out any 
alternative etiology (eg, disease progression, concomitant 
medications, and infections) to a possible immune -mediated 
event. In the absence of a clear alternative etiology, all such 
events should be managed as if they were immune related. 
General recommendations follo w.
-Symptomatic and topi[INVESTIGATOR_27549]-grade (Grade 1 o r 2, unless otherwise specified) events .
-For persistent (>3 to 5 days) low -grade (Grade 2) or severe 
(Grade ≥3) events, promptly start prednisone 1 to 2 mg/kg/day 
PO or IV equi valent .
-Some events with high likelihood for morbidity and/or mortality 
–eg, myocarditis, or other similar events even if they are not 
currently  noted in the guidelines –should progress rapi[INVESTIGATOR_348839] (methylprednisolone at 2 to 
4mg/kg/day) even if the event is Grade 2, and if clinical 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_27551]/or there has been clinical confirmation. 
Consider, as necessary, discussing with the Sponsor’s medical 
monitor , and promptly pursue specialist consultation .
-If symptoms recur or worsen during corticosteroid tapering 
(28days of taper), increase the corticosteroid dose (prednisone 
dose [eg, up to 2 to 4 mg/kg/day PO or IV equivalent]) until
stabilization or improvement of symptoms, then resume 
corticosteroid tapering at a slower rate (>28 days of taper).Grade 1 No dose modification
Grade 2 Hold study drug/study regimen dose until 
Grade 2 resolution to Grade ≤1.
If toxicity worsens, then treat as Grade 3 or 
Grade 4. Study drug/study regimen can be 
resumed o nce event stabilizes to Grade ≤1 after 
completion of steroid taper .
Subjects with endocrinopathies who may 
require prolonged or continued steroid 
replacement can be retreated with study 
drug/study regimen on the following 
conditio ns: 
1.The event stabilizes and is controlled
2.The patient is clinically stable as per 
Investigator or treating physician’s 
clinical judgement
3.Doses of prednisone are at 
≤10mg/day  or equivalent

Grade 3 Depending on the individual toxicity, study 
drug/study regimen may be permanently 
discontinued. Please refer to guidelines below .-More potent immunosuppressives such as TNF inhibitors 
(eg,infliximab) (also refer to the individual sections of the 
imAEs for specific type of immunosuppressive) should be 
considered for events not responding to systemic steroids. 
Progression to use of more potent im munosuppressives should 
proceed more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_348840]/or mortality –eg, my ocarditis, o r other similar 
events even if they are not currently noted in the guidelines –
when these events are not responding to systemic steroids .
-With long -term steroid and other immunosuppressive use, 
consider need for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP, 
formerly  known as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia) 
prophylaxis, gastrointestinal protection, and glucose monitoring.
-Discontinuation of study drug/study regimen is not mandated for 
Grade 3/Grade 4 inflammatory reactions attributed to local tumor 
response (eg ,inflammatory reaction at sites of metastatic disease 
and ly mph nodes). Continuation of study drug/study regimen in 
this situation should be based upon a benefit -risk analy sis for 
that patient .Grade 4 Permanently discontinue study drug/study 
regimen 
Note: For Grade ≥3 asymptomatic amylase or lipase levels, hold 
study drug/study regimen, and if complete work up shows no 
evidence of pancreatitis, study drug/study regimen may be 
continued or resumed .
Note: Study drug/study regimen should be permanently 
discontinued in Grade 3 events with high likelihood for morbidity 
and/o r mortality  –eg, myocarditis, or other similar even ts even if 
they are not currently noted in the guidelines. Similarly, consider 
whether study drug/study regimen should be permanently

and myasthenia 
gravisAny Grade General Guidance -The prompt diagnosis of immune -mediated peripheral neuromotor 
syndromes is important, since certain subjects may unpredictably  
experience acute decompensations which can result in substantial 
morbidity or in the worst case, death. Special care should be taken for 
certain sentinel symptoms which may predict a more severe outcome, 
such as prominent dysphagia, rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375] p rogressive weakness, and 
signs of respi[INVESTIGATOR_83741]
-Subjects should be evaluated to rule out any alternative etiology (eg
disease progression, infections, metabolic syndromes and 
medications, etc.). It should be noted that the diagnosis of immune -
mediated peripheral neuromotor syndromes can be particularly 
challenging in subjects with underlying cancer, due to the multiple 
potential confounding effects of cancer (and its treatments) 
throughout the neuraxis. Given the importa nce of prompt and 
accurate diagnosis, it is essential to have a low threshold to obtain a 
neurological consult
-Neurophy siologic diagnostic testing (egelectromyogram and nerve 
conduction investigations, and “repetitive stimulation” if myasthenia 
is suspect ed) are routinely indicated upon suspi[INVESTIGATOR_348845] a neurology

myocarditisFor Any Grade:
−The prompt diagnosis of immune -mediated myocarditis is important, 
particularly in patients with baseline cardiopulmonary disease and 
reduced cardiac function. 
−Consider, as necessary, discussing with the Sponsor’s medical 
monitor .
−Monitor patients for sign s and symptoms of myocarditis (new onset or 
worsening chest pain, arrhythmia, shortness of breath, peripheral 
edema). As some symptoms can overlap with lung toxicities, 
simultaneously evaluate for and rule out pulmonary toxicity as well as 
other causes (eg , pulmonary embolism, congestive heart failure, 
malignant pericardial effusion). A Cardiology consultation should be 
obtained early, with prompt assessment of whether and when to 
complete a cardiac biopsy, including any other diagnostic procedures.
−Initial work-up should include clinical evaluation, BNP, cardiac 
enzymes, ECG, echocardiogram (ECHO), monitoring of oxygenation 
via pulse oximetry (resting and exertion), and additional laboratory 
work -up as indicated. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_348849].
−Patients should be thoroughly evaluated to rule out any alternative 
etiology (eg, disease progression, other medications, or infections)

muscle weakness/pain occurs in proximal muscles including upper 
arms, thighs, shoulders, hips, neck and back, but rarely affects the 
extremities including hands and fingers; also difficul ty breathing and/or 
trouble swallowing can occur and progress rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375]. Increased general 
feelings of tiredness and fatigue may occur, and there can be new -onset 
falling, difficulty getting up from a fall, and trouble climbing stairs, 
standing up from a sea ted position, and/or reaching up.
−If poly/myositis is suspected, a Neurology consultation should be 
obtained early, with prompt guidance on diagnostic procedures. 
Myocarditis may co -occur with poly/myositis; refer to guidance under 
Myocarditis. Given breat hing complications, refer to guidance under 
Pneumo nitis/ILD. 
Given possibility of an existent (but previously unknown) autoimmune 
disorder, consider Rheumatology consultation.
−Consider, as necessary, discussing with the Sponsor’s medical monitor .
−Initial work-up should include clinical evaluation, creatine kinase, 
aldolase, LDH, BUN/creatinine, e rythrocy te sedimentatio n rate or C-
reactive protein level , urine myoglobin, and additional laboratory work -
up as indicated, including a number of possible

No newly  enrolled subjects are to be treated with the combinat ion of durvalumab, R -CHOP pl us 
lenalido mide. Only those subjects currently enro lled and receiving clinical benefit, based on the 
discreti on of  the Investigator, are eligible to remain on treatme nt following reconsent.
Dose m odificat ions (interruption and dose reduction) of lenalido mide are allowed for AEs 
associ ated wi th known lenalido mide -related toxi cities.Treatment -related AEs and the severit y 
which require protocol -defined dose modificat ionsof lenalido mide are found in Table 14. 
The dose of lenalidomide may be reduced successively by  [CONTACT_348934] 13.No more than one dose level reduct ion per cy cle is permitted unless 
discussed wi th and approved after consultation with the Celgene Medical Monitor. N o dose 
re-escalation of lenalido mide is permitted at any time during the study treatment. In addit ion, if a 
subject continues to experience unacceptable toxicit y at the l owest dose level allowed, 
lenalido mide will be discont inued permanently.

For subjects who are treated with lenalidomide in this study  (Arm  B: durvalumab in combinat ion 
with lenalido mide and R -CHOP ), please refer to the lenalidomide prescribing informat ion, the 
Summary  of Product Characteristics or the IB for potential drug inte ractions. In parti cular, 
cauti on shoul d be exercised with the concomitant use of digoxin and statins. Alt hough the 
coadministration of lenalido mide with the P- glyco protein inhibitors quinidine or temsiro limus 
had no clinically relevant effect on the pharma cokinet ics of l enalido mide, the concomitant use of 
P-glycoprotein inhibitors (eg v erapamil, cyclo sporin A, reserpi[INVESTIGATOR_050], quinidine, y ohimbine, 
tamoxifen ,toremifena )shoul d be considered carefully .
For informat ion regarding other drugs that may int eract wi th IP and affect its metabo lism, 
pharmacokinet ics, or excretion, please see the IB sand/or local package insert s.
8.1. Permitted/Recommended Concomitant Medications and Procedures
Invest igators may prescribe concomitant medicat ions or treatments necessary to prov ide 
adequate supportive care except for those medicat ions ident ified as “prohibi ted” as listed in 
Secti on8.2.
Specifically , subjects shoul d receive full supportive care during the study , including but not 
limited to, transfusio ns of blood and blood products, treatment with ant ibiotics, antiemetics, 
antidiarrheals, analgesics, and other treatments considered necessary  based on the clinical 
judgment of the treating physician, and in accordance wit h institutional standards.
8.1.1. Infection Prophylaxis
Invest igators may use their discret ion in administering infect ion prophylaxis for subjects 
regarded to be at high risk (including but not limited to: acy clovir or similar drug for herpes 
zoster). Monitoring of subjects for fever, neutropenia and infect ions and treatment with 
appropriate anti -infective therapy  shoul d be inst ituted as clinically  indicated.  
8.1.2. Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis (Lenalidomide)
It is not known whether prophylact ic ant icoagulation therapy prescribed in conjunct ion with 
lenalido mide may lessen the potential for venous thro mboembolism (VTE). The decision to take 
prophylact ic measures should be made carefully  after an assessment of an individual subject’s 
underlying risk factors.
As reference information, for subjects receiving lenalido mide in open -label trials, it is strongly 
recommended that subjects at risk for VTE receive either aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (70 –325 m g PO daily) or 
another prophylaxis agent w hile on l enalido mide. In those subjects with a high risk of VTE, it is

Prem edicat ion with an ant iemetic is reco mmended according to local pract ice.
8.1.4. Infusion Reaction Prophylaxis (Rituximab and Durvalumab)
Prem edicat ion consist ing of acetaminophen and an antihistamine should be administered before 
each ri tuximab infusio n (see package insert or where applicable refer to the instruction in the 
Pharmacy  Manual). Steroi ds m ay also be administ ered bef ore the start of the rituximab infusio n 
according to inst itutional pract ice. Surveillance measures during and after infusio n of ri tuximab 
shoul d be applied as recommended by  [CONTACT_941] m anufacturer/current guidelines.
Subjects who experienced Grade [ADDRESS_433544] ions are found in Table 10.
8.1.5. Treatment of Early Anti -Tumor Response (Tumor Flare Reaction)
Early ant i-tumor response (egpseudotumor progressio n, tum or flare react ion) is defined as a 
sudden increase in the size of the disease bearing sites, including the lymph nodes, spleen and/or 
the liver often acco mpanied by a low -grade fever, tenderness and swelling, diffuse rash and i n 
some cases, an increase in the peripheral blood lymphocy te counts. Treatm ent is based on the 
clinical judgment of the Invest igator . TFR will be graded using NCI-CTCAE Versi on 3.0. 
Symptom atic treatm ent of Grade 1 and 2 events with non -steroi dal ant i
-inflammatory  drugs 
(NSAIDs) ( ie,ibuprofen), corticosteroids, and/or narcotic analgesics for pain management is 
recommended, without an interruption in study  drug administration.
In the event of a ≥ Grade 3 early ant i-tumor response, i t is recommended that IP should be 
interrupted, as indicated, and the event treated with corticosteroids, NSAIDs, narcotic analgesics, 
and or antihistamines. Refer to Table 9for further instructi ons and dose modificat ions for 
Grade 3 and 4 events.
8.1.6. Urotoxicity Prophylaxis ( Cyclophosphamide )
Urotoxi city including h emorrhagic cyst itis, pyelit is, ureteritis, and haematuria have been 
reported with cyclophosphamide therapy . Prior, du ring and immediately after the administration, 
adequate amounts of fluid should be ingested or infused to force diuresis in order to reduce the 
risk of urinary  tract toxi city. Adequate treatment wit h mesna and/or strong hy dration to force 
diuresis can mark edly reduce the frequency and severit y of bladder toxicit y.Please refer to the 
cyclophosphamide prescribing informat ion for further details.

Confident ial and Propri etary 117 MEDI4736 -DLBCL -001 Amendment 4 Final: [ADDRESS_433553] 2019Analysis of other secondary  effica cy endpoints will include further analysis o f response and 
progression data and correlat ive evaluat ion of bio markers (as described in Section6.8) as
predi ctive with clinical responsiveness. 
The stati stical analysis o f the safet y profile will be observat ional in nature.
On 05 Sep 2017, a Partial Clinical Ho ld was placed to this study by [CONTACT_124756]. The decisio n by 
[CONTACT_348940], an ant i-programmed 
cell death -1 (PD -1) antibody, in pat ients with multiple myelo ma in combinat ion with 
immuno modulatory  agents. As a result of the US FDA Partial Clinical Hold, enrollment 
continued into Arm A only  and new su bjects received induct ion therapy  (durvalumab + 
R-CHOP) after Cy cle 1 regardl ess of DLBCL COO subt ype. Enrollment into Arm B 
(durvalumab in co mbinat ion with [R2-CHOP]) wasdiscont inued. Subjects enrolled and treated 
in Arm B pri or to the US FDA Partial Clinical Hold who were receiving clinical benefit, based 
on the di screti on of  the invest igator, couldcontinue study  treatm ent af ter being reconsented. 
9.2. Study Population Defi nitions
The stati stical analysis populat ions are defined as follows.
Safety Popul ation:  All subjects who take at least one dose of IP. Reporting done on 
Safety Popul ation will be done against actual treatment received.
Efficacy Evaluable Populat ion:  All subjects who complete at least one cy cle of their 
assigned treatment, have a baseline assessment by [CONTACT_348941]-baseline tumor response assessment. Reporting done on Efficacy Evaluable 
Popul ation will be done against planned treatmen t.
Pharmacokinet ic (PK) Populat ion:  All subjects who receive at least one dose of IP 
and have at least one measurable plasma concentration. Reporting done on PK 
Popul ation will be done against actual treatment received.
Biomarker Evaluable Population:  Al l subjects who receive at least one dose of IP and 
have at least one post- dose bio marker assessment. Reporting done on Bio marker 
Evaluable Populat ion will be done against actual treatment received.
9.3. Sample Size and Power Considerations
The total sample size for the study  is estimated to be approximately 45subjects enrolled (with 
approximately  40subjects in the efficacy evaluable populat ion).
Assuming historical control data of 55% f or the complete response rate at the end of the 
induct iontherapy  inthe efficacy  eval uable popul ation when treated with R -CHOP and 75% f or 
the complete response rate at the end of the induct ion when durvalumab is added to R-CHOP , 
40subjects would provide ~ 71% power to reject the null hypothesis that the complete response 
rate a t the end of the induct ion therapy  in the efficacy  evaluable popul ation is less than 55%. If 
null hypothesis on the primary endpo int is rejected, hy pothesis testing on the rate of subjects who 
continue conso lidation therapy  in the efficacy  evaluable popul ation will be performed 
hierarchically  without any  type I error adj ustment. Assuming thatthe rate of subjects who 
continue conso lidation when durvalumab is added to R -CHOP is at 85% , 40subjects would 
provi de in this hierarchical testing strategy  ~43% power to reject the null hypothesis that the rate

9.4. Background and Demographic Characteristics
Subject’s age, height, weight, and baseline characterist ics will  be summarized using descript ive 
statist ics, while sex, race and other categorical variables will be provided using frequency 
tabul ations. Medical history  data will be summarized using frequency tabulat ions by [CONTACT_348942].
9.5. Subject Disposition
Subject disposit ion (analysis population allocat ion, entered, di scont inued, along wit h primary  
reason for discont inuat ion) will be summarized using frequency and percent for both Treatment 
and Fo llow-up Peri ods. A summary of subjects enrolled by [CONTACT_27707]. Protocol 
deviat ions will be summarized using frequency tabulat ions.
9.6. Efficacy Analysis
The clinical act ivity of the study  treatm ents will be evaluated fro m a baseline assessment 
collected during Screening prior to the start of treatment, until a subject meets the criteria for 
disease progressi on.
All efficacy evaluable subjects will be included for efficacy analysis.
Efficacy analysis will be performed for each treatment arm by  [CONTACT_348943] R un-in Stage and the Expansion Stage of the study . Subgroup analysis for efficacy 
evaluat ion will be summarized. This includes sex, age category  and prognosti c risk cri teria for 
each treatment arm.
The primary  endpoint of this study  is the complete response rate at the end of the induct ion 
therapy .The key  secondary  endpoint is the rate of subjects who continue conso lidation therapy  
out of all subjects.
The CRR and t he rate of subjects who continue conso lidation therapy  will be summarized using 
count and per centage. The 95% confidence 2 -
sided confidence interval will be based on the 
Clopper -Pearson approach. Null hypothesis for the primary endpo int will be rejected if the lower 
limit of the confidence interval for the complete response rate at the end of the induction therapy 
in the efficacy  evaluable populat ion is above 55%. If null hypothesis for the primary endpo int is 
rejected, then hypothesis testing can be performed on the key  secondary  endpoint wi thout any  
type I error adjust ment. Null hypothesis for th e key  secondary  endpoint will be rejected if the 
lower limi t of the confidence interval for the rate of subjects who continue consolidation therapy  
out of all subjects in the efficacy evaluable populatio n is above 70%.
The secondary  efficacy endpoint will consist of an analysis of clinical responses to study  
treatm ent in bi omarker -defined subpopulations. Clinical responses will be assessed for potential 
relationship to bio marker posit ive subjects and bio marker negat ive subjects. Other efficacy 
analyses included in the exploratory  analysis will include PFS rate at 12 months, PFS rate at 24 
months,CR rate at end of treatment (12 months). Progression -free survival is calculated as the 
time fro m C1D1 to the first documented progression or death due to any c ause during the ent ire

laboratory  test val ues (as specified by  [CONTACT_348947]10.3), regardl ess of eti ology. Any 
worsening ( ie,any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency  or intensi ty of a pre -
exist ing condit ion) should be considered an AE. A diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on 
the AE page of the CRF rather than the individual signs or symptom s of the di agnosis or 
syndro me. 
Abuse, wi thdrawal , sensi tivity or toxi city to an investi gational product shoul d be reported as an 
AE.Overdose, accidental or intent ional, whether or not it is associated with an AE should be 
reported on the overdose CRF (See Section 7.2.6 for the definit ion of an overdose) . Any sequela 
of an accidental or intent ional overdose of an investigat ional product should be reported as an 
AE on the AE CRF. If the sequela of an overdose is an SAE, then the sequela must be reported 
on an SAE report form and on the AE CRF. The overdose result ing in the SAE should be 
ident ified as the cause of the event on the SAE report form and CRF but should not be reported 
as an SAE i tself.
In the event of overdose, the subject should be monitored as appropriate and should receive 
supportive measures as necessary .There is no known specific ant idote for durvalumab, 
lenalido mide, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin or prednisone overdose. 
Actual  treatm ent shoul d depend on the severit y of the clinical situation and the judgment and 
experience o f the treating physician.
All subjects will be mo nitored for AEs during the study .Assessments may include m onitoring of 
any or all o f the following parameters:  the subject’s clinical symptoms, laboratory , pathol ogical, 
radiological  or surgical  findings, physical examination findings, or findings from other tests 
and/or procedures.
All AEs will be record ed by  [CONTACT_11856] f rom the time the subject signs informed consent 
until [ADDRESS_433561] ’s source docum ents. All SAEs m ust be reported to Cel gene Drug Safet y

Confident ial and Propri etary 122 MEDI4736 -DLBCL -001 Amendment 4 Final: [ADDRESS_433563] 201910.2.1. Seriousness 
An SAE is any  AE occurring at any  dose that:
Results in death
Is life -threatening ( ie,in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of the Invest igator, the subject is at immediate 
risk of death fro m the AE)
Requi res inpat ient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_24508] 
(hospi [INVESTIGATOR_208838] n, regardl ess of l ength of stay )
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y (a substant ial disrupt ion of the 
subject’s abilit y to conduct normal life functions)
Is a congenital ano maly/birth defect
Const itutes an important medical event
Important m edical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately  life-
threatening or result in death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094], or disabilit y, but may  jeopardi ze the subject or 
requi re medical or surgi cal intervent ion to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  
Medical an d scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should be 
considered serious.
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_208839]:
Astandard procedure for protocol therapy  administrati on.However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_348858] d hospi [INVESTIGATOR_348859] a com plicat ion of therapy administration will be 
reported as an SAE
Routine treatm ent or m onitoring of  the studi ed indicati on not associ ated wi th any 
deteri oration in condit ion
The administration of blood or platelet transfusion as ro utine treatment of studied 
indicat ion.However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27589] a complication 
of such transfusion remains a reportable SAE
A procedure for protocol/disease- related invest igatio ns (egsurgery , scans, endoscopy , 
sampling for laboratory  tests, bone m arrow sam pling). However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_208840] a com plicat ion of such procedures remains a reportable 
SAE
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_348860], practical, or social 
reasons, i n absence of an AE
Aprocedure that is planned ( ie,planned pri or to start of treatment on study ); must be 
docum ented in the source document and the CRF. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_208842] a com plicati on remains a reportable SAE
An elect ive treatment of or an elect ive procedure for a pre -exist ing condit ion, 
unrelated to the studied indicat ion, that has not worsened fro m baseline
Emergency outpatient treatment or observat ion that does not result in admissio n, 
unless fulfilling other seriousness criteria above

Confident ial and Propri etary 123 MEDI4736 -DLBCL -001 Amendment 4 Final: [ADDRESS_433564] 2019If an AE i s considered serious, both the AE page/screen of the CRF and the SAE Report Form 
must be completed.
For each SAE, the Invest igator will provide information on severit y, start and stop dates, 
relationship to the IP, action taken re garding the IP, and outcome.
10.2.2. Severity/Intensity
For both AEs and SAEs, the Invest igator must assess the severit y/intensity of the event. 
The severit y/intensity of AEs will  be graded based upon the subject’s symptoms according to the 
current active minor v ersion of the Commo n Termino logy Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE, 
Versi on 4.0 3); 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applicat ions/ctc.htm#ctc_40 .However, 
TFR will be graded using NCI-CTCAE versio n 3.0.
AEs that are not defined in the CTCAE should be evaluated for severit y/intensity according to 
the following scale:
Grade 1 = Mild –transi ent or mild disco mfort; no limitat ion in act ivity; no m edical  
intervent ion/therapy  requi red
Grade 2 = Moderate –mild to moderate limitat ion in activity, som e assistance may  be needed; no 
or minimal medical intervent ion/therapy  requi red
Grade 3 = Severe –marked limitat ion in act ivity, som e assistance usually required; medical 
intervent ion/therapy  requi red, hospi [INVESTIGATOR_348861] 4 =Life-threatening – extreme limitation in activit y, significant assistance required; 
significant medical intervent ion/therapy  requi red, hospi [INVESTIGATOR_348862] 5 =Death -the event results in death
The term  “severe” is often used to describe the intensit y of a specific event (as in mild, moderate 
or severe myocardial infarct ion); the event itself, however, may be of relat ively minor medical 
significance (such as severe headache). This criterion is notthe sam e as “serious” which is based 
on subject/event outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s 
life or funct ioning.  
Seriousness, not severit y, serves as a gui de for defining regul atory  obligat ions.
10.2.3. Causality
The Invest
igator must determine the relat ionship between the administration o f the IP and the 
occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below:
Not suspected: a causal relat ionship of the adverse event to IP administration is unlikely 
or remote , or other m edicat ions, therapeutic intervent ions, or underlying 
condi tions provi de a sufficient explanat ion for the observed event.
Suspected: there is a reasonable possibility that the administration of IP caused the 
adverse event. ‘Reasonable possibili ty’ means there is evidence to 
suggest a causal relat ionship between the IP and the adverse event.

Confident ial and Propri etary 124 MEDI4736 -DLBCL -001 Amendment 4 Final: [ADDRESS_433565] 2019Causalit y shoul d be assessed and provided for every  AE/SAE based on currently available 
inform ation.Causalit y is to be reassessed and provided as addit ional inform ation beco mes 
available.
If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a comparator, ancillary or addit ional IP 
that has not been manufactured or provided by [CONTACT_27718], please provide the name [CONTACT_208924].
10.2.4. Duration
For both AEs and SAEs, the Invest igator will provide a record of the start and stop dates of the 
event.
10.2.5. Action Taken
The Investigator will report the action taken with IP as a result of an AE or SAE, as applicable 
(egdiscont inuat ion, interruption, or dose reduction of IP, as appropriate) and report if 
concomitant and/or addit ional treatments were given for the event. 
10.2.6. Outcome
The Investigator will report the outcome of the event for both AEs and SAEs.
All SAEs that ha ve not resolved upon discont inuatio n of the subject’s participat ion in the study  
must be fo llowed until recovered (returned to baseline), recovered with sequelae, or death (due to 
the SAE ).
10.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values
An abnormal laboratory  value is considered to be an AE ifthe abnorm ality:
resul ts in discont inuat ion from the study
requi res treatm ent, m odificat ion/ interruption of IP dose, or any other therapeutic 
intervent ion; or
is judged to be of significant clinica l importance, for example, one that i ndicates a 
new disease process and/or organ toxicit y, or is an exacerbation or worsening of an 
exist ing condit ion
Regardless of severit y grade, only  laboratory  abnorm alities that fulfill a seriousness criterion 
need to be documented as a serious adverse event.
If a laboratory  abnorm ality is one com ponent of a di agnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page/screen of the CRF. If the abnormalit y was not a 
part of a diagnosis or syndro me, then the laboratory abnormalit y shoul d be recorded as the AE. If 
possible, the laboratory  abnorm ality should be recorded as a medical term and not simply as an 
abnorm al laboratory  resul t (egrecord thrombocy topenia rather than decreased platelets ).
10.4. Pregnancy
All pregnancies or suspected pregnancies occurring in eit her a female subject of childbearing 
potenti al or partner of childbearing potential of a male subject are immediately reportable events .

regardl ess of disease state) occurring while the subject is on IP , or wi thin [ADDRESS_433567] is to be discont inued imme diately (please also see Secti on11.1) and the 
subject instructed to return any unused portion of lenalido mide or prednisone/predniso lone to the 
Invest igator .  The pregnancy , suspected pregnancy , or posi tive pregnancy  test m ust be reported to 
Celgene Drug Safet y immediately  by [CONTACT_6968] , phone or facsimile, or other appropriate method, 
using the Pregnancy Init ial Report Form , or approved equivalent form.  
The female subject should be referred to an obstetrician -gyneco logist, preferably  one 
experienced in reproductive toxicit y for further eval uation and counseling.
The Investi gator will fo llow the female subject until co mpletion of the pregnancy , and m ust 
notify Celgene Drug Safet y immediately  about the outcom e of the pregnancy  (either norm al or 
abnorm al outcom e) using the Pregnancy  Follow-up Report Form , or approved equivalent form .
If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (egspontaneous abortion), the Invest igator should 
report the abnormal outcome as an AE. If the abnormal outcome meets any of the serious 
criteria, i t must be reported as an SAE to Celgene Drug Safet y by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate 
method, within [ADDRESS_433568] igator ’s knowledge o f the event using the SAE Report

Confident ial and Propri etary 126 MEDI4736 -DLBCL -001 Amendment 4 Final: [ADDRESS_433571] 2019The Investigator is required to ensure that the data on these forms is accurate and consistent.   
This requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless of relat ionship to IP) that occur during the study  
(from the time the subject signs informed consent unt il [ADDRESS_433572] dose of a ny other IP, whichever is later ) or any  SAE m ade known to the 
Invest igator at any  time thereafter that are suspected of being related to IP. Serious adverse 
events occurring prior to treatment (after signing the ICF) will be captured.
The SAE report should provide a detailed descript ion of the SAE and include a concise summary 
of hospi [INVESTIGATOR_27598]. If a subject died and an autopsy has been 
perform ed, copi [INVESTIGATOR_348863]. Any fo llow-up data should be detailed in a subsequent 
SAE Report Form, or approved equivale nt form, and sent to Cel gene Drug Safet y.  
Where required by  [CONTACT_81689], the Invest igator is responsible for informing the Inst itutional 
Review Board/Ethics Co mmittee (IRB/EC) of the SAE and providing them wit h all relevant 
initial and fo llow-up in formation about the event. The Investigator must keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_208843] h Celgene and the IRB/EC.
10.5.1. Safety Queries
Queri es pertaining to SAEs will be co mmunicated fro m Celgene Drug Safet y to the si te via 
facsimile or electronic mail. The response t ime is expected to be no more than five (5) business 
days. Urgent queries (egmissing causalit y assessment) may be handled by [CONTACT_648].
10.6. Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events
For the purpose of regulatory  reporting, Celgene Drug Safet y will determine the expectedness of 
events suspected of being related to durvalumab or lenalidomide based on the IB.
In the US, all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be reported in an 
expedited manner in accordance wit h 21 CFR 312.32.
For countri es wi thin the European Economic Area (EEA), Celgene or its authorized 
representative will report in an expedited manner to Regulatory  Authori ties and Ethi cs 
Committees concerned, suspected unexpected S[LOCATION_003]Rs in accordance with Directive 
2001/20/EC and the Detailed Guidance on collect ion, verification and presentation of adverse 
reaction reports ari sing fro m clinical trials on investigat ional products for human use 
(ENTR/CT3) and also in accordance with country -specific req
uirements. 
For the purpose of regulatory  reporting in the EEA, Celgene Drug Safet y will determine the 
expectedness of events suspected of being related to the other components of the study treatment
(ie,rituximab, cy clophosphamide, vincrist ine, doxorubic in, predniso ne/predniso lone,) based on 
the EU Summary of Product Characterist ics(SmPC). Any SAE that is suspected of being related 
to local Involved -Field Radiat ion Therapy (IFRT )alone will  not be assessed for expectedness or 
reported in an expedited manner.
Events of disease progressi on for the di sease under study  (including deaths due to disease 
progression for indications that are considered to be fatal) will be assessed as exp ected adverse 
events and will not be reported as expedited safet y reports to regulatory  authori ties.

10.7. Adverse Events of Special Interest
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is one of scient ific and medical interest specific to 
understanding of the Invest igational Product and may require close mo nitoring and rapid 
communicat ion by [CONTACT_348948] . An AESI may be serious or non -serious. The 
rapid reporti ng of AESIs allows ongoing surveillance o f these events in order to characterize and 
understand them in associat ion with the use of this investigat ional product. These AESIs are 
being closely mo nitored in clinical studies w ith durvalumab monotherapy  and combinat ion 
therapy .
An imAE is defined as an adverse event that is associated with drug exposure and is consistent 
with an immune -mediated mechanism o f action and where there is no clear alternate etio logy. 
Serol ogic, immuno logic, and histol ogic (biopsy ) data, as appropri ate, shoul d be used to support 
an imAE diagnosis. Appropriate efforts should be made to rule out neoplast ic, infect ious, 
metabo lic, toxin, or other etio logic causes of the imAE.
If the Investigator has any qu estions in regard to an adverse event (AE) being an imAE, the 
Invest igator should promptly contact [CONTACT_1689].
10.7.1. AESIs for Durvalumab
The AESIs reported for durvalumab are AEs that include, but are not limited to, events with a 
potenti al inflammator y or immune -mediated mechanism that may require more frequent 
monitoring and/or interventions such as corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and/or endocrine 
therapy .Early recognit ion of signs and symptoms potentially  related to an inflammatory  or 
immune -mediated m echanism  is important for proper management of toxicit ies.
The AESIs observed with ant i PD-L1/PD -1 agents such as durvalumab include diarrhea/co litis, 
pneumo nitis/ILD, hepat itis and increases in transaminases, endocrinopathies, dermat itis/rash and 
pruri tus, nephri tis and increases in serum creatinine, neuromuscular toxicit y such as myasthenia 
gravis and Guillain- Barre, and pancreat itis.These are described below in more detail.

10.7.2. AESIs for Lenalidomide
The AESIs defined for lenalido mide in this study are Second Primary Malignancies (SPM), Deep 
Vein Thro mbosis (DVT), and Tumor Flare React ion (TFR). These AESIs are described below in 
more detail.
Further informat ion on the AESIs for lenalido mide can be found in the current version o f the 
lenalido mide IBand in the lenalido mide prescribing informat ion.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Second Primary Malignancies 
Second primary malignancies will be monitored as events of interest and must be reported as 
serious adverse events regardless of the treatment arm the subject is in and must be considered as 
“Important Medical Events” if no other serious criteria apply. This includes any second primary 
malignancy, regardless of causal relat ionship to IP (study  drugs), occurring at any  time for the 
durati on of  the study , from the time of signing the ICF for at least unt il: 
[ADDRESS_433576] dose of study  treatm ent; or
Upto [ADDRESS_433577] subjects’ first lenalido mide dose in the study, whichever is the 
later date for an individual subject
as well as, those SPMs made known to the Invest igator at any time thereafter that are suspected 
of being related to any  IP.
These e vents m ust al so be docum ented in the appropriate page(s) of the CRF ( ie,AE and SPM 
CRF) and subject’s source documents. Documentation on the diagnosis of the second primary 
malignancy must be provided at the time of reporting as a serious adverse event (egany 
confirmatory  histol ogy or cy tology resul ts, x-rays, CT scans, etc). 
Following com pletion of the last durval umab subject’s 90 -daySafety Follow
-up Vi sit (data 
cutoff date 06 Jun2019), SPMs will no longer be collected in the CRFs. Subjects who receiv ed 
lenalido mide will cont inue to be fo llowed for SPMs as requi red by [CONTACT_348888]  
(Secti on3.1.3.1 ) . Investigators w ill cont inue to record SPMs in the 
subject’s source documents and report SPM events to Celgene Drug Safet y. After stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_348864], any SPM events will cont inue to be collected in the safet y 
database.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Deep Vein Thrombosi s
Factors known to increase thrombotic risk in cancer patients in general, not necessarily those 
receiving lenalidomide, include but are not limited to the underlying disease, family history, age, 
obesit y, immo bilizat ion, hormonal therapy, central venous c atheter, recent DVT, and 
doxorubi cin (Zhou, 2010 ;Park, 2012 ;Lyman 2013).

Confident ial and Propri etary 129 MEDI4736 -DLBCL -001 Amendment 4 Final: [ADDRESS_433578] 2019Although available data with lenalido mide mo notherapy  in lympho ma patients show a l ower 
incidence of VTE compared with lenalido mide in combinat ion with dexamethasone in mult iple 
myelo ma subjects, it is reco mmended that all subjects at risk for thromboembo lic events receive 
anti-thrombotic prophylaxis (see Secti on8.1.2 ),and all subjects will be closely monitored for 
VTE.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Tumor Flare Reaction / Pseudoprogression
Tumor flare react ion is an adverse effect of lenalidomide typi[INVESTIGATOR_348865] 
(Chanan -Khan, 2008a; Witzig, 2009). It is important to note that the increased lymphadenopathy  
seen in TFR may mimic PD. Therefore, careful mo nitoring and evaluat ion to different iate TFR 
from PD is necessary  for addressing treatm ent of individual su bjects including making decisio ns 
to discont inue treatment ( Chanan -Khan, 2008b ). There are currently no laboratory  or
radiological  tests that di stinguish TFR from PD. The dist inction may be made on clinical 
grounds, incorporat ing observat ions such as timing of the event relat ive to the start of 
lenalido mide, associated physical findings, laboratory  findings, and pace of disease before and 
after inst itution of  lenalidomide treatment. Also, in case of TFR, inflammat ion and edema may 
reduce or disappear after short term treatment with NSAIDs and/or corticosteroids.
Management of TFR is described in Section8.1.[ADDRESS_433579] ions, Tum or 
Lysis Syndrome (TLS), and My elosuppressio n.These AESIs can be related to any  of the study  
treatm ents including backbone therapy  with rituximab, cy clophosphamide, doxorubicin, 
vincrist ine, and prednisone.
These AESIs are described below in more detail.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Infusion -Related Reaction, Anaphylaxis and Allergic Reactions
With the administration of monocl onal antibodies, major safety concerns associated with 
immunogenicit y include serious allergic reactions and anaphylaxis, cytokine -release syndrome, 
infusio n-related reacti ons, and del ayed hypersensit ivity associated to immune complex disease, 
which can potentially be severe or life -threatening leading to death.
Adverse reactions that occur during or shortly after infusio n may include fever, chills, 
hypotension, dyspnea, tachycardia, cy anosis, respi[INVESTIGATOR_33078], urti caria and pruritus, 
angioedem a, hy potoni a, arthral gia, bronchospasm, wheeze, cough, dizziness, fat igue, headache, 
hypertensio n rash, headache, flushing, sweat ing, myalgia, nausea, vo miting, unresponsiveness, 
and hemodynamic instabilit y. The ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_348866] [ADDRESS_433580] or second exposure to the agent, but between 10% and 30% 
occur during subsequent treatments (Lenz, 2007 ).
Anaphylaxis is a systemic, immediate hy persensi tivity react ion that is m ediated by  [CONTACT_348949] m IgE and m ast cells; these interactions result in an ant igen/ant ibody  
reacti on. Clinical manifestations o f acute allergic reactions may range from localized skin 
reacti ons at the inject ion site to AEs, which can include, but are not limited to, th ose events

[IP_ADDRESS]. Tumor Lysis Syndrome
Tumor lysis syndrom e (TLS) i s a well -known constellat ion ofmetabolic abnormalit ies result ing 
from spontaneous or treatment -related tum or necrosis or fulminant apoptosis. The metabolic 
abnorm alities include: hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia and hyperphosphatemia with secondary  
hypocalcaemia with risk of renal failure. TLS has been reported in subjects receiving rituximab 
plus lenalidomide and rituximab plus chemotherapy .
The presence of known risk factors such as bulky disease, pre- exist ing (moderate) renal 
insufficiency, high ALC and high uric acid levels (> 8 mg/ dL) prior to therapy  are known to 
increase the likelihood of TLS. Early ident ification of subjects at risk and the prevention of TLS 
development with the init iation of prevent ive measures, as well as the careful mo nitoring for 
early  signs of laboratory  TLS and the prom pt ini tiation of  supportive care are crit ical to prevent 
potenti ally life-threatening metabo lic derangements ( Cairo, 2010 ).
Management of TLS i s described in Section8.3.3 .
[IP_ADDRESS]. Myelosuppression
Myel osuppressi onis the major toxicit y of rituximab pl us cycl ophosphamide, doxorubi cin, 
vincrist ine, and prednisone (R -CHOP) regimen in the treatment of diffuse large B -cell 
lympho ma and can present as decrease in the WBC count, decrease in the platelet count, 
decrease in the hemoglobin concentrati on, or any  combinat ion of those.
Parti cularly neutropenia and f ebrile neutropenia (FN) areserious hematologic toxicit iesof 
chemot herap y containing myelotoxic agents, and p rolonged FN may increase disease -related

an interim scan. However, in trials involving PET where de -escalation is investigated, it may be preferable to 
consider a sc ore of 3 as inadequate response (to avoid undertreatment). 
Measured dominant lesions: Up to six of the largest dominant nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal lesions 
selected to be clearly measurable in two diameters. Nodes should preferably be from disparate regions of the 
body and should include, where applicable, mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas. Non -nodal lesions include 
those in solid organs (eg liver, spleen, kidneys, and lungs), GI involvement, cutaneous lesions, or those noted 
on palpation. Non -measured lesions: Any disease not selected as measured, dominant disease and truly 
assessable disease should be considered not measured. These sites include any nodes, nodal masses, and 
extranodal sites not selected as dominant or measurable or that do not meet the requirements for measurability 
but are still considered abnormal, as well as truly assessable disease, which is any site of suspected disease 
that would be difficult to follow quantitatively with measurement, including pleural effusions, ascites, bone 
lesions, leptome ningeal disease, abdominal masses, and other lesions that cannot be confirmed and followed 
by [CONTACT_9661]. In Waldeyer’s ring or in extranodal sites (egGI tract, liver, bone marrow), FDG uptake may be 
greater than in the mediastinum with complete metabolic re sponse, but should be no higher than surrounding 
normal physiologic uptake (egwith marrow activation as a result of chemotherapy or myeloid growth factors).

Signifi cant changes included in the amendment are summarized below.
The fo llowing changes were made tothe study  protocol and the associated sections of the 
Protocol  Summary :
Secti on 4.2: Update of inclusio n criterion 11 (c and d) for liver enzymes and 
hemoglo bin.
Rationale for change : The laboratory entry criteria w ere tightened in order to 
reduce the risk for additive or synergistic toxicity of compounds of the study 
treatment.
Secti on 4.2: Update of inclusi on criteria 12, 13 and 14 to:
oClarify  highly  effect ive methods for con tracepti on,
oClarify  timelines for subjects to abstain fro m breastfeeding, egg cell donat ion, 
blood and semen donation, 
oClarify  the requi rement for subjects to understand and fo llow the overall 
lenalido mide standard pregnancy and counseling plan.

use of live attenuated vaccines is from [ADDRESS_433642] dose of durvalumab, whichever is lo nger.
Rationale for change : Live attenuated vaccines during and after study treatment 
should be avoided because the effects of the study backbone therapy, namely B -cell 
depletion by [CONTACT_4124], and the PD -L1 inhibitor durvalumab, on such vaccination 
have not been evaluated. In order to not put study subjects at risk, live attenuated 
vaccines are not permitted during the defined periods of study participation and 
treatment.
Secti on 6 (Procedures): Clarification of the f ollowing assessments:
oSafety run-in stage: Clarificat ion by [CONTACT_348969] a new section (6.5.1.) .

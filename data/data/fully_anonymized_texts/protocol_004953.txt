Phase 1/2 Dose -Escalation, Safety, Clinical Activity, Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Study of the  
ERK1/[ADDRESS_1082950] astic Syndrome s 
Protocol Number:  
BVD- 523-02 
Indication:  
Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) or Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)  
Objectives:  
Primary objectives:  
• To define the safety and tolerability of BVD -523 in patients with AML or MDS by [CONTACT_787101]-limiting toxicities (DLT), the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the recommended Phase  2 
Dose (RP2D).  
• To determine the pharmacokinetic profile of BVD -523 and selected metabolites in patients with AML 
or MDS.  
Secondary objectives:  
• To assess clinical resp onse in patients with AML or MDS treated with BVD -523 at the recommended 
Phase 2 Dose (RP2D).  
• To determine the progression- free survival (PFS)  and duration of response (DOR)  of AML or MDS 
patients treated with BVD -523 achieving CR ( complete remission )/CRp (complete remission with 
incomplete platelet recovery ). 
Exploratory objective : 
• To evaluate pharmacodynamic marker (biomarker) measures.  
Methodology/Study Design:  
BVD- 523-02 is an open -label, multicenter, Phase 1/2 study with a dose -escalation phase (Part 1) and a cohort 
expansion phase (Part 2).  
Part 1 – Dose -escalation Phase:  A classic “3+3” design will be used to establish dose limiting toxicities (DLT), 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).  Three to six patients per 
treatment cohort will be assigned to receive sequentially higher oral doses of BVD -523 on a twice daily 
schedule (b.i.d.) for 21 days (a “Cycle”), starting at a dose of [ADDRESS_1082951] 
21 days (1 cycle).  
The 3  + 3 design will be conducted as follows.  Initially, 3 patients will be enrolled to a  cohort; the occurrence 
of a single drug- related DLT in one of these 3 patients will prompt enrollment of up to 3  additional patients to 
that same cohort.  When more than 1 DLT occurs in ≤  6 patients in a dosing cohort, dose escalation will be 
stopped and this dose level will be identified as the non -tolerated dose.  Doses between the non -tolerated dose 
and the preceding lower dose, where ≤  1 DLT occurred, may be explored to more precisely define the MTD.  
This strategy allows for a rigorous determination o f MTD, especially if the dose increase that resulted in 
determination of the non- tolerated dose is relatively large (i.e., > 50%).  
During the study, the Sponsor and Investigators may request that cohorts be enlarged or that evaluation of 
intermediate doses  between 2 planned escalation steps be explored.  Such requests will be discussed with the 
Investigator(s), Sponsor and Medical Monitor, and should be based on all data existing at that time, including

safety and clinical activity, determinations of pharma cokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and cumulative toxicity.  
Before each escalation, investigators will be consulted to ensure that all involved agree with the escalation 
decision.  
Part 2 – Cohort -expansion Phase :  Additional patients will be recruited to one o f two groups  - Group 1: RAS 
mutant positive AML or MDS; Group 2: RAS mutant negative AML or MDS - to receive treatment at the 
Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D).  Patients will receive twice daily oral doses of BVD -523 in 21- day 
treatment cycles until disease  progression, unacceptable toxicity, or another withdrawal criterion is met.  
Treatment cycles will occur consecutively without interruption except when necessary to manage adverse events.

Concomitant Medications:  
Necessary supportive care such as antibiotics, blood product transfusions, antiemetics, antidiarrheals, etc., will 
be allowed.  Drugs that  are strong inhibitors of CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, or strong inducers of 
CYP3A4, will not be allowed during the study  (see Appendix  1). 
Study Duration:  
Part 1: Approximately 6 months, Part  2: 18 to 24 months  
Criteria for Evaluation  
Safety : 
Vital signs, physical examination, ophthalmo logy examination, clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, 
electrocardiograms (ECG).  The severity of adverse events (AEs ) will be graded according to the National 
Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( NCI CTCAE ) Grading Sca le Version 
4.03 (see the NCI  CTCAE web page at http://ctep.cancer.gov  for details).  
Efficacy : 
Clinical response will be assessed on results of bone marrow biopsies using International Working Group 2003 
and 2006 criteria for AML or MDS  respectively  (1, 2).   
Pharmacokinetics : 
Blood samples will be collected  to measure BVD -523 and selected metabolite  concentration s.  At Baseline 
(Visit 2, Cycle 1) and again on Day 22 ( Visit 5, Cycle 1), blood samples will be collected prior to 
administration of the first daily dose and then post -dosing at the following time points: 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 
± 2 hours . 
Pharmacodynamics:  
Blood and/or bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_787073].   Blood and/or bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_787074]- [ADDRESS_1082960] reached steady -state.  
Statistical Methods : 
The sample size for Part 1 of this study was determ ined by [CONTACT_787102].  
Approximately 20 patients will be treated in Part  1 of this study (Dose Escalation Phase) to establish dose 
limiting toxicities (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the recommended Phase  2 dose (RP2D).  
After  completion of Part 1 of this study,  Part 2 will commence.  In Part 2,  up to 40 additional AML or MDS 
patients  will be recruited to one of two groups - Group 1: patients with positive RAS  mutant AML or MDS and 
Group 2: patients with negative RAS mutant AML or MDS  will be treated with the RP2D of BVD -523.  The 
purpose of the second phase of this study is to document evidence of response.  With 20 subjects in each group , 
there is an 88% probability of seeing at least one positive response in each group  if the true response rate is at 
least 10%.  
The observation of DLTs in more than 33% of patients in either Part [ADDRESS_1082961] 6 patients enrolled at 
any time during Part 2 will trigger temporary stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_787075]2D in the specific cohort.  Subsequent patients will be treated with a dose lower than the initial RP2D and this dose will be determined in discussion with the Clinical Investigators, the Medical Monitor, and the Sponsor.

A critical hallmark of cancer is t he activati on of cell-gr owth si gnali ng cascades independe nt of 
appropri ate g rowth stimuli (3).  A canonic al exa mple of a  cell growth control circuit is the 
mitogen-activated pr otein kinas e, or MAPK, p athway.  Here, surface re ceptor s activa ted by 
[CONTACT_787103] a line ar relay system: RAS f amily GTPa ses 
activate RAF  family protein kinase s, which  in turn trigger a phosphorylati on cascade invol ving 
mitogen -activated protein kinase/extracellular signal -related kinase ( MEK ) and extracellular 
signal -regulated kinase ( ERK ) family kinases.  ERK kinas es activa te an array o f direct 
effec tors that ultima tely tra nslate  growth signalin g into essential cellular functi ons inc luding 
cell div ision and ce ll survival.  
Aberrant activati on of  the MAPK p athway is freque ntly observed in ca ncer.  Often, 
components of the M APK pathway under go direct geneti c mu tation, causing consti tutive 
activati on of  the signali ng cascade in the  absence of  appropriate liga nds.  For example, 
memb ers of the RAS G TPase family (KRAS, NRAS , and HRA S) were am ong some  of the first 
endogenous oncogenes de monstr ated to ex hibit spont aneous, activati ng mutations in a v ariety 
of cancers, includ ing panc reatic, colorectal and no n-small cell lung mali gnanc ies (4).  
Up-regulation of the Ras>Raf>MEK>ERK and PI3K>Akt pathways and phosphorylation of the 
downstream target Bad are observed frequently in AML specimens and associated with a poorer 
prognosis than  that seen in  patients lacking these changes ( 5, 6).  Aberrant expression of a single 
pathway is associated with a poor prognosis and abnormal expression of multiple signaling 
pathways is associated with an even worse prognos is (5).  Dysregulation of the 
Ras>Raf>MEK>ERK and PI3K>Akt pathways in some AMLs may result from constitutive 
activation of Flt -3 (7, 8, 9).  Thus these two signaling pathways provide important clues 
regarding the mechanisms responsible for autonomous AML growth ( 10, 11, 12, 13, 14).  
Targeting these “downstream” pathways may prove effective for AML therapy, in cluding  in 
those cases where the precise mutation responsible for malignant transformation is unknown.   
AML is the most common type of acute leukemia seen in adults, with approximately 13,000 
cases diagnosed annually in the [LOCATION_002] (US).  The median  age at onset is 67  years, with 
the majority of patients being between 65 and 84 years at the ti me of diagnosis (15).  The 
incidence of this hematologic malignancy can be expected to increase as the US populatio n 
ages.   AML is often fatal, with a 5- year survival rate of only 23% (16). 
The goal of treatment of AML is to achieve a complete remission by [CONTACT_787104](s) to allow recovery of peripheral blood  production and re -population of the bone marrow 
(BM) with n ormal hematopoietic stem cells.  In the induction treatment of AML, complete 
remission is considered the only clinically important form of response .  The ability to achieve 
such a response has been directly correlated with survival and is a necessary first step in a curative treatment strategy.   In the majority of patients with AML who achieve a complete 
response (CR), the leukemia will recur within 3 years after diagnosis.  In general, the prognos is 
of patients after relapse is poor and treatment options unsatisfactory  (17).   
The Ras>Raf>MEK>ERK pathway is also activated by [CONTACT_787105] ( 18).  After receptor

 Confidential  Page 16  ligation, Shc, Src homology (SH) -2, a SH2- domain containing protein, becomes associated with 
the c- terminus of the cytokine receptor ( 19, 20, 21).  Shc recruits the GTP -exchange complex 
Grb2/Sos resulting in the loading of membrane bound Ras with GTP ( 22, 23).  Ras:GTP then 
recruits Raf to the membrane where it becomes activated, likely via a Src- family tyrosine kinase 
(24, 25, 26) .  Raf is responsible for phosphorylation of the mitogen associated/extracellular 
regulated kinase -1 (MEK1) (27, 28, 29).  MEK1 phosphorylates extracellular regulated kinases 
1 and 2 (ERKs 1 and 2) on specific threonine and tyrosine residues ( 27, 28, 29). 
Activated ERK1 and ERK2 serine/threonine kinases phosphorylate and activate a variety of 
substrates including p90Rsk1 ( 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36).  p90Rsk1 can activate the cyclic- AMP 
response element binding protein (CREB) transcription factor ( 33).  Moreover, ERK can 
translocate to the nucleus and phosphorylate additio nal transcription factors such as Elk1, CREB 
and Fos which bind promoters of many genes, including IL -3, a cytokine important in 
stimulating the growth and survival of early myeloid progenitor cells ( 32, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 
43, 44, 45, 46, 47).  The Raf>MEK>ERK pathway can also modulate the activity of many 
proteins involved in apoptosis including: Bcl -2, Bad, Bim, Mcl -1, caspase 9, and Survivin ( 48, 
49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58).  Therefore, targeting AML cells with an ERK1/2 inhibitor 
such as BVD -523 may be effective in this difficult to treat patient population.  
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal stem cell disorders 
characterized by a hypercellular bone marrow, peripheral cytopenias, and morphologi c 
dysplasia in erythroid cells, neutrophils and their precursors, and megakaryocytes.  A diagnosis 
of MDS is made based on the identification of dysplasia in at least 10% of cells of any of the myeloid lineages in the peripheral blood/bone marrow after exc lusion of acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML) and chronic  myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) ( 59).  The median age at 
diagnosis is 71 years ( 60).  It is estimated that the current incidence of MDS in the [LOCATION_002] 
(US) is approximately15,000 to 20,000 cases; however, given that MDS was not a reportable cancer to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surveillance, Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], and End Results (SEER) database until 2002, it is c onsidered likely that the actual incidence is as much as 7 -8-
fold higher (61). 
Several prognostic scoring systems are used to categorize MDS, with higher risk categories having shorter median survival and hig her risk of progression to AML.  The most widely used 
prognostic scoring system is the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), which classifies patients into lower risk categories (low and intermediate -1) and higher -risk categ ories 
(intermediate -2 and  high) (62).  Risk category is calculated based on the percentage of blasts, 
number of cytopenias, and bone marrow cytogenetics.  Median survival in the IPSS 
intermediate -2 and high -risk categories is short (1 .1 and 0.4  years, respectively).   Another 
prognostic tool, the World Health Organization (WHO) classification -based Prognostic Scoring 
System (WPSS), incorporates morphological disease characteristics, IPSS cytogenetics, and red cell transfusion needs, and categorizes patients into 5 risk categories ranging from very -low risk 
to very -high risk.  Median survival in the very -low risk category is 103 months and is notably 
shorter (12 months) in the very high- risk category.   Furthermore, patients in the very -high risk 
category have a high risk of transformation to AML), whereas the risk is low (0.06% ) of 
transformation to AML for the very low -risk group ( 63).  Overall, it is estimated that 
approximately 30% of patients with MDS will progress to AML.

approved in the US for the treatment of MDS (azacitidine, decitabine, and lenalidomide); 
however, allogeneic hematopoietic stem -cell transplantation (SCT) remains th e only known 
curative procedure ( 64). 
Similar to AML, the MAPK/ERK pathway is activated in  hematopoietic stem cells in MDS 
patients.  Therefore, investigational agents targeting other MAPK components are being 
explored in both monotherapy and combination chemotherapy regimens.  For example, 
inhibitors of MEK family kinases have shown preliminar y signs of clinical efficacy in BRAF -
mutant melanoma, and may also prove effective in cancers where RAS GTPase activating mutations are present ( 65, 66, 67). 
The ERK family kinases are MAPK signaling components that have yet to be therapeutically targeted.  BVD -[ADDRESS_1082970] in hematologic malignancies.  
1.1 STUDY DRUG 
BVD -523 is a small molecule that potently inhibits both ERK1 and ERK2 protein kinases in the 
sub-nanomolar range, while not significantly inhibiting any of an array of kinases even at  1000-
fold greater concentrations.  BVD -523 potently inhibits growth and survival in cultured cancer 
cell lines; melanoma, colorectal and pancreatic lines harboring BRAF or RAS mutations are 
among those most susceptible to the drug.  In animals bearing ectopic tumor xenografts, orally administered BVD -[ADDRESS_1082971] in capsule form.

characteri zed cellular, biochemical or genetic aberrations.  The modern view of cancer as a 
fundamentally genetic disease has greatly aided the inven tion and development of several such 
“targeted” therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

Clinical Study Protocol: BVD -523-02 
 Confidential  Page 18  A unique array of oncogenic mutations cluster in the mitogen- activated protein kinase (MAPK) 
pathway, a key signal transduction cascade that controls cell -growth signaling in many tissues 
(70, 71, 72, 73, 74).  As described in  detail previously in the Introduction, the MARK/ERK 
pathway is activated in hematopoietic stem cells of both AML and MDS  patients.  Therefore, 
investigational agents targeting other MAPK components are being explored in both 
monotherapy and combination chemotherapy regimens.  Activating mutations in RAS GTPase family members are found in ~30% of all cancers ( 75).  The inhibitors of the MEK family of 
kinases have shown preliminary signs of clinical efficacy in BR AF-mutant melanoma and may 
also prove effective in cancers like AML or MD S where the RAS GTPase acti vating mutations 
are present ( 65, 66, 67). 
Less frequently, activating mutations have also been observed in MEK family kinases, which are the direct substrates of RAF kinases.  MEK kinases phosphorylate and activate the ERK kinase gene family.  ERK kinases phosphorylate numerous proteins that act as MAPK pathway “effectors”; these substrates directly promote cell division, reduce cell death, and increase cell motility and cell differentiation ( 68, 69).  To date, spontaneous activating mutations in ERK 
kinases have not been observed in human cancers .  Nonetheless, abundant ERK 
phosphorylation reflecting elevated MAPK signaling is  frequently observed in cancer contexts 
where extracellular growth factors are elevated  or where activating mutations in RAS, BRAF, or 
MEK genes have occurred  (74). 
In this setting, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_787078] t hat show activation of the signaling cascade following genetic mutation .  
Notably, vemurafenib (ZELBORAF
®) is an inhibitor of mutated BRAF that, when dosed in 
patients with metastatic melanoma harboring specific BRAF activating mutations, for example, induces tumor regression and improves overall survival in this defined patient population ( 75, 
76, 77). 
The development of additional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_787079].  First, all drugs exhibit a unique spectrum of side effects that often influences their therapeutic utility.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_787080] -
related events, the incidence and severity of both BRAF and MEK inhibitor associated toxicities may uniquely indicate their use in particular patients.  Likewise, given the potential for drug -
drug interactions, and an increasing emphasis on polypharmacy in targeted oncology regimens, it is desirable to have multiple unique agents with discrete pharmacology and prescribing characteristics, even when they may share a common, r edundant target or modes of inhibition in 
a pathway.  
Additionally, a more fundamental and prominent problem drives the need for additional MAPK pathway modulators: increasingly, multiple inhibitors in the pathway exhibit the phenomenon of acquired drug resistance ( 78, 79, 80, 81).  Acquired resistance may limit the clinical efficacy of 
MAPK directed agents even when their initial activity is promising.  The severe consequences and complex biology of acquired resistance in patients treated with MAPK signaling inhibitors suggest that additional, novel agents targeting the pathway may display improved durability and overall efficacy ( 81). 
Given this background, we plan to assess the safety and efficacy of BVD -523, which is a potent 
and selective inhibitor of the ERK family kinases.  Drugs targeting other components of the

Protocol BVD-523-01, “Phase 1 Dose- escalation, safety, pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamics study of BVD -523 in patients with advanced malignancies”, is in 
progress.  Twenty seven patients with advanced malignancies have been treated in the dose-escalation part (Part 1) of the first- in-man Phase 1 clinical study to investigate the safety of 
BVD -523 and define the MTD and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). The dose 
escalation phase included dose levels of 10, 20, 40, 75, 150, 300, 600, 750, and 900 mg b.i.d. The MTD and RP2D of BVD-523 was established to be 600 mg b.i.d ( 82).  
 The most common adverse events included diarrhea, nausea, vomiting or constipation (89%), rash (any form), dermatitis, or pruritus (78%), fatigue (70%), decreased appetite (37%), dyspnea (33%), and anemia (26%). Pharmacokinetics were generally linear and dose proportional up to 600 mg twice a day, and BVD-523 achieved phar macologically relevant 
exposure ( 82). 
 
1.5 PRECLINICAL DATA 
In this section a short summary of preclinical data is provided.  Detailed information is 
presented in the BVD -523 Investigator’s Brochure  (Version  2.0, 21 April 2014).    
1.5.[ADDRESS_1082974]- in-human study (BVD -523-01) suggests the molecule has a safety profile 
supportive of its development as an anti -cancer therapeuti c.  Additionally, human clinical trials 
have been conducted using other drugs known to affect the MAPK pathway and findings from these studies may provide information regarding possible safety risks that may be mechanistically attributable to MAPK pathway inhibition.    
Thus, the risk profile for BVD -523 may potentially include the following:

include: non- specific rash and pruritus, acneiform dermatitis, epi[INVESTIGATOR_787082] , and paronychia.  
Additionally, clinical experience with both investigational agents and approved drugs that 
primarily target BRAF kinase have displayed exposure- dependent and reversible skin toxicities 
in a proportion of treated patients; relevant lesions here include keratoacanthoma- type squamous 
cell carcinomas, non -cancerous hyperkeratosis and actinic keratosis.    
A similar pattern of cut aneous toxicity was observed in the first [ADDRESS_1082975]

and on Day 8, at steady state.  
Tissue M ineralization  
Tissue mineralization has been observed in rodent toxicology studies of BVD -523.  The 
incidence and severity of mineralization  was dose -dependent and effects were observed in  one 
or more tissues at toxic doses.  In animals in which mineralization occurred after treatment with 
BVD -523, significantly increased serum phosphorus and modestly decreased serum calcium 
were seen.  T hese effects were not observed in animals in which there was no mineralization.  
Tissue mineralization has been reported in rodents with other compounds that target the MAPK pathway and published studies suggest that the MAPK pathway is a negative regulator of m atrix 
mineralization both in vitro  and in vivo . 
Routine clinical laboratory tests, including blood chemistry analyses for calcium and inorganic phosphate, will be performed and any indication of abnormalities may result in further investigations.  A clinical monitoring strategy similar to this was previously employed for related drugs that target the MAPK pathway.  
Hematologi cal Effects 
Hematological effects observed in a rat repeat dose study included lowered reticulocyte counts, mean corpuscular volume, platelet counts (in females only) and increased neutrophil, monocyte, basophil and large unstained cell counts.  In dogs the clinical pathology findings were consistent with inflammation (increased white blood cell count, neutrophils, fibrinogen and globulin) and decreased albumin and hemorrhage (decreased red cell mass).  
In order to monitor for potential hematologic toxicity in humans, routine clinical laboratory hematology tests, should be performed and any indication of abnormalities may result in further investigations.

BVD -523 is highly efficacious in vivo  when administered as a single agent in ectopic xenograft

While BVD -523 modestly inhibits the human ether -a-go-go related gene ( hERG ) current (IC 50

max = 17.3 µM).  Thus 
BVD -[ADDRESS_1082984] -in-human study will monitor for signs of cardiovascular effects of BVD -523 in 
humans.  
No significant cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibition has been observed with the compound.  
In vitro  studies suggest that the compound is metabolized primarily via oxidation by [CONTACT_787107] 3A4, 2D6, and 1A2.  Furthermore, no significant CYP induction wa s observed

of BVD- [ADDRESS_1082988] trial (BVD -523-01) was derived 
from 2 8-day G LP to xicology  studie s performed in rodent and non-rode nt spe cies and 
calcu lated as des cribed by [CONTACT_787110] (83).  Spec ifically, our results indicated th at toxicity in 
rodents would be  used to establish sta rting dose in patie nts.  The s everely toxic dose  in 10% of  
the animals (STD10) for BVD-523 w hen administered for up to 28 days in Sprague-Dawley 
rats was determined to be  12.5 m g/kg dosed twice daily ( 25 mg/kg /day).  A standard 10- fold 
reducti on of  this dose w as scaled to  establish  a sta rting dose of 13.5 mg twice-daily of BVD-
523 (free base equival ents) or  14.[ADDRESS_1082989] Phase  1 cli nical study with BVD- 523 in can cer p atients 
(BVD -523-01) was 10 mg tw ice-daily (20 mg/day) (84).   
The starting dose determination  for this Phase 1/2 study  (BVD -523-02) in AML or MDS  
patients described herein is  based on the clinical experience during  the dose-escalation st udy in 
patients with solid tumors.  The dose escalation phase of study BVD -523-01, the first -in-man 
Phase 1 clinical study included 27 patients treated at dose levels of 10, 20, 40, 75, 150, 300, 600, 
750, and 900 mg b.i. d. DLTs were observed in 5 pts: 2 with grade 3 rash (600 mg and 750 mg 
b.i.d. ), [ADDRESS_1082990] (900 mg b.i.d. ), 1 with grade 3 diarrhea, 
vomiting, dehydration and elevated creatinine (900 mg b.i.d. ), and 1 with grade 2 hypotension, 
elevated creatinine, and anemia ( 750 mg b .i.d.); the MTD was established at 600 mg b.i. d.  
BVD -523 achieved pharmacologically relevant exposure and manageable tolerab ility at its 
MTD of 600 mg b.i.d ( 82).  Ex vivo  whole blood assays demonstrated inhibition of 
phosphorylation of RSK, a downstream substrate of the target ERK, at doses ≥ 40 mg, b.i.d.  
Additionally, inhibition of metabolic activity was d emonstrated by [CONTACT_6789] -PET at 75 mg,  b.i.d.  
The 300 mg b.i.d. starting dose for the BVD -523-02 study with AML or MD S patients is based 
upon these results in the solid tumor study.  As the ongoing Phase 1 study progresses, the 
300 mg b.i.d. starting dose in AML or MDS patients may be revised  based upon accruing  safety 
experience and determination of the  RP2D from the so lid tumor study.

3.1.2  M ethodology / Study De sign 
BVD -523-02 is an open- label, multicenter, Phase 1/2 study with a dose -escalation phase (Part 1) 
and a cohort expansion phase (Part 2).  
Part 1  Dose-escalation  Phase: 
A classic “3+3” design will be used to establish dose limiting t oxicities (DLT), maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD), and the recommended Phase  2 dose (RP2D).  Three to six patients per 
treatment cohort will be assigned to receive sequentially higher oral doses of BVD -523 on a 
twice daily schedule (b.i.d.) for 21 days (a “Cyc le”), starting at a dose of [ADDRESS_1082991] 
21 days (1 cycle) . 
The classic 3 + 3 design will be conducted as follows.  Initially, 3 patients will be enrolled to a 
cohort; the occurrence of a single drug -related DLT in one of these 3 patients will prompt 
enrollment of up to 3 addit ional patients to that same cohort .  When more than 1 DLT occurs in 
BVD-523  BioMed Valley Discoveries, Inc.  
Clinical Study Protocol: BVD -523-02 
 Confidential  Page 26  ≤ 6 patients in a dosing cohort , dose escalation will be stopped and this dose level will be 
identified as the non- tolerated dose.   
Doses between the non- tolerated dose and the preceding lower dose, where ≤  1 DLT occurred, 
may be explored to more precisely define the MTD.  This strategy allows for a rigorous 
determination of MTD, especially if the dose increase that resulted in determination of the non -
tolerated dose is relatively large (i .e., > 50%).  
During the study, the Safety Monitoring Committee may request that cohorts be enlarged or that 
evaluation of intermediate doses between 2 planned escalation steps be explored.  Such requests 
will be discussed with the Investigator(s), Sponsor and Medical Monitor, and should be based 
on all data existing at that time, including safety and clinical activity, determinations of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and cumulative toxicity.  Before each escalation, investigators will be consulted to e nsure that all involved agree with the escalation decision.  
In addition, intra -patient dose escalation will be allowed after a patient has completed at least 
one cycle at their assigned dose, with escalation up to a dose where at least [ADDRESS_1082992] one cycle.  
Part 2 Cohort -expansion Phase :   
Additional patients with AML or MDS  with or without specific genetic mutations indicative of 
MAPK pathway activation will be recruited for treatment at the Recommended Phase 2 Dose 
(RP2D).  Patient s will receive twice daily oral doses of BVD -523 in 21- day treatment cycles 
until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or another withdrawal criterion is met.  Treatment cycles will occur consecutively without interruption except when necessary to manage adverse events.  
Total enrollment for P art 2 is targeted at approximately 40 patients.  Patients will be enrolled 
into 1 of 2 treatment groups.  Group assignments are made according to the following disease characteristics, which correspond to specifi c inclusion and exclusion criteria for P art 2:  
• Group 1: patients with RAS mutant positive AML or MDS; n (evaluable) ≤  20 
• Group 2: patients with RAS mutant negative AML or MDS; n (evaluable) ≤ 20

at the same or escalated dose level (see intra -patient dose escalation Sec 3.1.3) at the Investigator’s 
discretion.   Study m edication for a week of dosing should  be dispensed at each visit  for treatment C ycles 1 
and 2 .  For treatment cycles after Cycle 2, study medication will be dispensed to support the entire 3 week  
cycle.

5.5 DESCRIPTION OF STUDY VISITS FOR PA RT 2 
Study procedures for Part 2 will be the same as tho se for Part 1.  If clinical experience gained in 
Part 1 requires significant deviations in Part 2 from the procedures in Part 1, these changes will 
be addressed in a protocol amendment.  
6 METHODS OF ASSESSM ENT AND CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION 
All trial data  will be reco rded on the electronic case report forms ( eCRFs) (TEMPO™).   
Photographs will be taken in the event a patient experiences a rash, and the photos will be uploaded into the eCRF.  Blood and biops y specimens will be sent to a third party laboratory 
vendor for analysis.  
6.1 DEMOGRA PHIC DATA 
At Visit  1 (Sc reeni ng), patie nt demog raphic data will be collected.  These include date of birth, 
age, gende r, race, ethnicity, AML or MDS subtype  and mo lecular abnormalities (when 
available). 
6.2 MEDICAL HISTORY 
At Visit  1 (Screeni ng), a comple te medical history will be  obtaine d from each patie nt.  For 
female  patie nts of  child-bearing potential, the date of the  last menstru al period will be noted.  
Smoking history and prior cancer therapy will be recorded.  Da ta will be re viewed at Visit  2 
(Baseline) a nd upda ted at subseque nt visits. 
6.3 CONCOMITA NT MEDICA TIONS 
A detailed histo ry of medications, including  prior anti -cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  and procedure s will be 
documented for each patie nt at Visit  1 (Sc reening) a nd Visit  2 (Baseline ).  Conc omitant 
medi cations ( especially changes in me dication, including any anti -cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ) will be 
docu ment ed for e ach patie nt at each scheduled visit.  Necessary supportive care such as anti -
emetics and anti -diarrheals , etc., will be allowed.  Medi cations which a re known to be strong 
inhibitors of  CYP3A4, CYP2D6 , and CY P1A2, or  strong  inducers of CYP3A4, are not 
permitted during the  study (for list of non-pe rmitted drugs, see  Appendix  1). 
Hydroxyurea will b e allowed for all subjects during  Cycle [ADDRESS_1083017] on study.  
6.4 PHYSICAL EXAMINA TION 
• Height in centi meters (cm) will be me asured at V isit 1 (Sc reening). 
• Body weight in kilogram ( kg) wil l be measu red at screenin g and a t the beginning of each 
cycle.

indicated.  
The following clinical laboratory tests wi ll be p erformed:  
• Hematology (blood sam ple: ED TA) – hemoglobin, he mato crit, white  blood cell s (WBC) 
count with dif ferentia l, red blood cell s (RBC) count, and plate let count. 
• Blood Che mistry (blood sample:  serum) – albumin, alkaline phosphata se (ALP ), total 
bilirubin, calcium, chlo ride, cre atinin e, glucose, inorganic phosphorus, potassium, tota l 
protein, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspa rtate aminotransfera se (AST), sodium, 
blood urea nitrogen (BU N) uric acid, cholesterol and trigly cerides (at s
 creenin g and fir st 
day of Cycle 1 ). 
• If the to tal bilirubin concentration is inc reased above 1.[ADDRESS_1083020] reacti ng bi lirubin. 
• Urinalysis – sp ecific gravity, pH; semi-quanti tative "dipst ick" evaluati on of  glucose, 
protein, bilirubin, ketones, leukocytes, and blood and a mic roscopic examination 
including RBC, WB C and casts will be perfo rmed if the dipstick is abnormal . 
Blood chemistry will be analyzed at each trial center by a certified laboratory and a report of the laboratory values will be sent to the trial center.  The investigator  or designee  will review the 
laboratory report within 24 hours (except during clinic holidays, when review will be performed within 72 hours) after receipt of the results and assess  the clinical significance of all abnormal 
values .  Results must be reviewed prior to dosing and appropriate action taken for any clinically 
significant abnormal values.  Values will be documented on the laboratory report until stabilized, or the laboratory value returns to a clinically acceptable range (regardless of relationship to study medication)  or baseline.  Any laboratory value that remains abnormal at the 
end-of-study (EOS) and that is considered clinically significant will be followed according to

Patients are to be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons:  
• Withdrawa l of info rmed consent 
• Disease progression (at the discretion of the PI)  
• Unacceptable to xicity 
• Changes in the patient' s condition which rende r the patient una ccepta ble for further 
treatment in the judgment of the PI  
• At le ast 3 interruptions of  BVD-523 intake of > 7 days each, or 8 cons ecutive days  
• Patient bec omes p regnan t (withdrawa l is required) 
• Patient i s lost to follow- up

 Confidential  Page 49  8 TREATMENT 
The safety and PK of BVD -523 will be tested in sequentially increasing doses starting at  
300 mg twice daily, initially in patient cohorts of 3 patients  (for tabular summary, see 
Table 3.2).  Dose escalations of BVD -523 will occur in 100% increments in cohorts until one 
patient experiences a study related  ≥ Grade 2 toxicity (excluding alopecia or diarrhea) , after 
which dose increases will be ≤  50%.  If one patient in a 3 patient cohort experiences a DLT as 
defined in Table  3.2, up to 3 additional patients will be t reated at this dose level.  If more than 
one DLT occurs in ≤ 6 patients, this dose level will be defined as the non- tolerated dose and 
dose escalation will be stopped.  
Doses will not be escalated unless the patient(s) receiving the highest current dose have been 
observed for at least [ADDRESS_1083038] their treatment interrupted until the toxic ity returns to ≤ Grade 1 or pre -treatment baseline (whichever is more severe) .  
Resumption of BVD -[ADDRESS_1083039] 8 ounces of water  for 21 days, at 12- hour 
± 2 hour intervals.  The study medication should be taken at the same time each day on an 
empty stomach , i.e., fasting (30 -60 minutes before food or 2 hours after food).  A patient that is 
observed to vomit an intact capsule after dosing in the clinic during the PK measurements may receive a substitute dose of drug.  However, patients should be instructed NOT to take a substitute capsule if vomiting occurs after self-dosing at home.   Missed doses should be skipped 
and not taken as a double dose at the next dosing timepoint.  
Since this is a second -in-human study  relatively little  human toxicity has thus far been 
experienced .  Therefore, dose modifications for any toxicity seen will be developed as data are 
accrued .  However, patients experiencing DLT or unacceptable toxicity will have their treatment 
interrupted until the toxicity returns to ≤ Grade 1 or pre -treatment baseline .  BVD -523 treatment 
may then be re -initiated at the next lower dose level  where the safety profile has previously been 
established,  or between the dose level yielding unacceptable toxicity and the previous dose 
level, aligning with capsule dose availability .  Such dose adjustments will be done  in 
consultation with the Investigators and Medical Monitor of the study.

 Confidential  Page 52  9 ADVERSE EVEN T MANAGEMENT 
9.1 DEFINITION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT 
An Adv erse Event (A E) is defined as any untow ard medi cal occurrence in  a patie nt 
administered a medi cinal product that does not ne cessa rily have a ca usal relationship wi th this 
treatme nt.  An AE  can, the refore, be any unfavor able and unintende d sign (including a n 
abnorm al laboratory finding), symptom, or dise ase tempo rally associ ated with the use  of a 
medi cinal (investig ational) produc t, wh ether or not r elated to the study (investigational) 
produc t.  This includes a n exacerbation of  pre-existing conditions or event s, intercurre nt 
illness es, drug inter actio n, or the si gnificant wo rsening o f the ind ication under investigation 
that is not r ecorded e lsewhere in the eCRF under specific ef ficacy asse ssme nts.  Anticip ated 
fluctuations of pre -existing conditions, including  the disease un der study that doe s not r epresent 
a clinically si gnificant e xacerbati on or  worsening, need not be c onsidere d AEs. 
It is the re spons ibility of the inve stigator to d ocument all AEs that occur during the stu dy.  AE 
information will be  elicite d by [CONTACT_787120] a non-l eading question, for exa mple, “Have 
you expe rienced any ne w or change d symp toms since we  last asked/since you r last vis it?”  
AEs should be re ported on the a ppropri ate page of the  eCRF. 
9.2 DEFINITION OF A SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT 
A Serious Adve rse Event (SAE) is any untow ard medi cal oc currence that occurs at any dose 
(including after the ICF i s signed and prior to dosin g) that: 
• Results in death  
• Is life-threa tening (patien t is at immedia te risk of death  from the  event as it occurred) 
• Require s in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11298] (for mal admi ssion to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_17399] l for medical r easons) o r 
prolongation of ex isting hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• Results in pe rsistent or sig nificant disability/in capacity 
• Result s in a congenital anomaly /birth defect 
Impor tant medical events that may not result in de ath, are not life-threatening, or do not r equire  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18543] m ay be c onsidere d SAEs when, base d on a ppropriate medi cal judgment, th ey 
may jeopardize the p atient and m ay require  med ical or su rgical intervention to pr event one  of 
the out comes listed in this de finition.  Exa mples of su ch events include allerg ic bronchospa sm 
requiring  intensive tr eatment in an emergency r oom or at home , blood dyscra sias or  
convulsions that do not  result in in-patie nt hospi [INVESTIGATOR_059], or  the dev elopme nt of drug 
dependency o r drug abuse. 
Hospit alizations for  elective surg ery or other medical procedures that  are not related to a 
treatment-emerge nt AE  are not conside red SAEs.  
Progression of the malignancy under study (including signs and symptoms of progression) 
should not be reported as an SAE unless the outcome is fatal during the study or within the safety reporting period (see below).  If the malignancy has a fatal outcome during the study  or 
BVD-523  BioMed Valley Discoveries, Inc. 
Clinical Study Protocol: BVD-523-02 
 
 
 Confidential Page 53 within the safety reporting period, then the even t should be reported using the term “disease 
progression” with a CTCAE severity of Grade 5. 
9.3 RECORDING OF ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE 
EVENTS 
Recording and reporting of adve rse events should be in accordance with the FDA “Guidance 
for Industry and Investigators Safety Reporti ng Requirements for INDs and BA/BE Studies” of 
December 2012. 
Any AE is to be recorded in the eCRF.  In order to avoid vague, ambiguous, or colloquial 
expressions, the AE should be recorded in st andard medical terminology rather than the 
patient’s own words.  Whenever possible, the in vestigator should combine signs and symptoms 
that constitute a single diagnosis. 
The existence of an AE may be concluded from  a spontaneous report of the patient; from the 
physical examination; or from special tests, e. g., ECG, laboratory assessments, or other study-
specified tests (source of AE). The reporting period begins from the time that the patient provides informed consent through 
and including [ADDRESS_1083043] give consent for photographs to be 
taken. 
9.4 INTENSITY OF ADVERSE EVENTS 
The severity of the AE will be graded acco rding to the NCI CTCAE Grading Scale Version 
4.03 (see the NCI CTCAE web page at http://ctep. cancer.gov for details).   For AEs not covered 
by [CONTACT_4652], the severity will be characterized as “mild”, “moderate”, or “severe” 
according to the following definitions: 
• Mild events are usually transient and do not interfere with th e patient’s daily activities. 
• Moderate events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the patient and 
may interfere with daily activities. 
• Severe events interrupt the pa tient’s usual daily activities.

Device Deficiencies  
A device deficiency is inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, 
durabilit y, reliability, safety, or performance. A device deficiency may or may not be 
associated with patient harm (ie, ADE or SADE); however, not all ADEs or SADEs are due 
to a device deficiency. The Investigator should determine the applicable category listed in  the 
Device Deficiency eCRF for the identified or suspect device deficiency and report any patient 
harm separately.

7.[ADDRESS_267094] questions:  
• “Have you had any health problems since your last study visit? ” 
• “Have there been a ny changes in the medicines you take since your last study visit? ” 
Additionally, changes in any protocol -specific parameters and/or questionnaires evaluated 
during the study are to be reviewed by [CONTACT_737]. Any untoward (unfavorable and 
unintended) change in a protocol -specific parameter or questionnaire response  that is 
clinically relevant, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], is to be reported as an AE. These 
clinically relevant changes will be reported regardless of causality.  
7.3 Procedures for Recor ding and Reporting  
AEs are collected from the time of informed consent. Any pre -existing medical conditions or 
signs/symptoms present in a subject prior to the start of the study (ie, before informed 
consent is signed) are not considered AEs in the study a nd should be recorded as medical 
history .

Any AEs and device deficiencies for non -study marketed devices/products (ie, OFR ) will be 
considered and processed as spontaneous (following the postmarket vigilance procedures) 
and should be communicated to the device ’s/product ’s manufacturer as per local 
requirements.

The Study Sponsor will assess the AEs and  may upgrade the Investigator ’s assessment of 
seriousness and/or causality. The Study Sponsor will notify the Investigator of any AEs that 
are upgraded from non -serious to serious or from unrelated to related.  
  
 
 
 
 
  
7.5 Follow -Up of Subjects with Adverse Events

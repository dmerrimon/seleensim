Despi[INVESTIGATOR_345737] (Elkashef, Vocci et al. 2008 ), no medication has been approved t o 
treat methamphetamine (MA) dependence . Public health problems due to MA dependence include HIV 
infection: HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men (MSM) approaches 20% in [LOCATION_004] 
(Shoptaw and Reback 2007 ). Among MSM, incidence of HIV among MA -users is significantly higher than 
for MSM who do not use MA  (Buchacz, McFarland et al. 2005 , Plankey, Ostrow et al. 2007 ) and MA 
accounts for between 28% and 33% of new HIV infections in MSM (Koblin, H usnik et al. 2006 , Ostrow, 
Plankey et al. 2009 ). MA use is associated with neurocognitive deficits especially with HIV infection 
(Scott, Woods et al. 2007 ), poor antiretroviral adherence, and worse HIV treatment outcomes 
(Rajasin gham, Mimiaga et al. 2012 ). Therefore, development of effective medications for MA 
dependence, especially among HIV infected populations, is a public health priority.  
Ibudilast (IBUD) is a macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and phosphodiester ase (PDE) -4 
and -10 inhibitor  at peak clinical exposures  (Rolan, Hutchinson et al. 2009 ) that increases glial cell line -
derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF ) expression (Mizuno, Kurotani et al.  2004 ) and reduces microglial 
activation (Suzumura, Ito et al. 1999 , Suzumura, Ito et al. 2003 ), including HIV -induced glial activ ation 
(Kiebala and Maggirwar 2011 ). IBUD significantly reduces  MA prime - and stress -induced reinstatement 
of MA seeking in rats (Beardsley, Shelton et al. 2010 ) and has multiple effects that may make it an 
effective treatment for MA dependence i ncluding amelioration of dopaminergic and neuroinflammatory 
dysfunction. Multiple studies implicate glial cells in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases (Hirsch and 
Hunot 2009 , Sidoryk -Wegrzynowicz, Wegrzynowicz et al. 2011 ) including MA dependence  and HIV 
infection (Nath 2010 ). Activated glial cells secrete pro -inflammatory mediators (Minghetti, A jmone -Cat et 
al. 2005 ) that may exacerbate MA -induced dopaminergic dysfunction. Glial cells also produce 
neurotrophic factors, including  GDNF, which  may ameliorate dopaminergic dysfunction  (Pascual, 
Hidalgo -Figueroa et al. 2008 ). Thus, IBUD may be an effective medication for MA dependence due to its 
modulation of glial cell activation resulting in amelioration of dopaminergic and neurocognitive 
dysfunction and improved treatment outcomes in MA dependence. IBUD may also have unique effects in 
HIV positive MA users as it may additionally block the degradation of neuronal integrity seen in HIV 
infection (Chana, Everall et al. 2006 , Dash, Gorantla et al. 2011 ).  
The proposed study will complete a phase 2 clinical trial to determine the safety and efficacy of IBUD 
for the treatment of MA dependence. Treatment -seeking MA dependent volunteers (N = 1 40) will be 
randomly assigned to IBUD (50 mg BID; N= 70) or placebo (BID; N= 70), with twice -weekly clinic visits for 
counseling, urine drug screens, and safety/medication adherence monitoring, for [ADDRESS_429310] a statistically significant benefit of IBUD over placebo on the primary study outcome: 
MA abstinence dur ing the final two weeks of treatment  (FDA-preferred efficacy outcome ). The study will 
address the following specific aims  among 140 MA dependent participants :  
Aim 1:  To determine whether IBUD reduces MA use more than placebo among MA dependent 
participant s.  
Aim 2:  To determine whether IBUD results in longer treatment retention than placebo among MA 
dependent participants.  
As ibudilast has putative mechanisms that would have additional benefit in patients with HIV, we will 
enroll up to  70 HIV positive (as  determined by [CONTACT_345781]), MA dependent 
participants in order to address the following exploratory  HIV-specific Aims : 
 Aim 3 : To determine whether IBUD improves biological (CD4 count; HIV RNA) and neurocognitive 
outcomes more than p lacebo among HIV-positive MA dependent participants.  
Aim 4 : To determine whether IBUD improves behavioral outcomes (sexual transmission behaviors; 
uptake and/or adherence to HIV medications) relative to placebo among HIV-positive MA 
dependent participants . 
Secondary analyses will examine treatment outcomes and: (1) medication non -adherence, (2) adverse 
event rates , (3) MA abstinence during a two week lead -in period, a predictor of outcomes in stimulant 
trials (Bisaga, Aharonovich et al. 2010 ), (4) polymorphisms in dopaminergic genes and GD NF 
(Yoshimura, Usui et al. 2011 ) and (5) plasma and serum levels  of inflammatory  and neurotrophic 
markers . IBUD was well tolerated with no serious adverse events in a  phase I study of IBUD in MA 
dependent individuals (clinicaltrials.gov: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . These studies are the result of a long -standing 
collaboration between our research group  and MediciNova , Inc. who are fully committed to seeing IBUD 
[ADDRESS_429311] MA Ph II, Protocol     Page 3 of 39              Version 12.0; 9 July 2016  through the regulatory and marketing process for MA dependence . The study has high public health 
relevance as an effective medication would improve health outcomes and reduce public health harms in 
MA dependent  patients, especially those with HIV infection.  
 
Background  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_345737] (Elkashef, Vocci et al. 2008 ), no medication has been approved to 
treat methamphetamine (MA) dependence , although bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], a dopamine/norepi[INVESTIGATOR_263857] -uptake 
inhibitor, shows preliminary efficacy in a subgroup with lower pre -treatment frequency of MA use 
(Elkashef, Rawson et al. 2008 , Shoptaw, Heinzerling et al. 2008 ). Behavioral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_345738] (CM) are effective for MA dependence but response is variable (Roll, Petry et 
al. 2006 , Lee and Rawson 2008 , Dean, London et al. 2009 ). The past decade of research has 
highlighted the neurotoxic effects of MA, especially for dopaminergic systems in the ventral striatum 
(Krasnova and Cadet 2009 , Lee, London et al. 2009 ), as well as  the clinical consequences of MA-
induced neurotoxicity  including neurocognitive dysfunction (Scott, Woods et al. 2007 ) and poor response 
to behavioral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (Wang, Smith et al. 2011 ). As a result, medications that ameliorate MA -induced 
neurotox icity may improve clinical outcomes in MA dependence.  
Of the p ublic health problems due to MA dependence , HIV infection is one of the most serious. HIV 
prevalence among men who have sex with men (MSM) approaches 20% in [LOCATION_004] (Shoptaw and 
Reback 2007 ). Among MSM, incidence of HIV among MA -users is significantly higher than for MSM who 
do not use MA (Buchacz, McFarland et al. 2005 , Plankey, Ostrow et al. 2007 ) and MA accounts for 
between 28% and 33%  of new HIV infections in MSM (Koblin, Husnik et al. 2006 , Ostrow, Plankey et al. 
2009 ). HIV is associated with deficits in neurocognitive functioning  (Heaton, Clifford et al. 2010 ) which 
are compounded with co -occurring MA use (Rippeth, Heaton et al. [ADDRESS_429312] et al. 2005 , 
Letendre, Cherner et al. 2005 , Carey, Woods et al. 2006 ), and among HIV positive patients, MA use is 
associated with poor antiretroviral adherence  and worse HIV treatment outcomes (Rajasingham, 
Mimiaga et al. 2012 ). Therefore, testing of medications for MA dependence among HIV infected 
populations is a public health priority.  
Multiple studies implicate neuroinflammatory process es in the pathophysiology of a variety of 
neuropsychiatric conditi ons (Hirsch and Hunot 2009 , Sidoryk -Wegrzynowicz, Wegrzynowicz et al. 2011 ), 
including MA dependence. Activated glial cells play a central role in neuroinflammation via the secretion 
of multiple pro-inflammatory mediators (Minghetti, Ajmone -Cat et al. 2005 ) that may exacerbate MA -
induced neurodysfunction. For example, preclinical studies have shown that MA activates microglia and 
blocking MA -induced glial activation resul ts in attenuate d subsequent MA -induced neurodegeneration 
(Ladenheim, Krasnova et al. 2000; Flora, Lee et al. 2002; Thomas and Kuhn 2005; Fantegrossi, Ciullo et 
al. 2008; Narita, Suzuki et al. 2008; Thomas, [LOCATION_009]scutti -Verbeem et al. 2008). Importantly, MA -
induced microglial activation precedes the development of pathological changes in striatal dopamine 
neurons (LaVoie, Card et al. 2004), suggesting that microglial activation is involved in the development of 
MA-induced neurochanges and is not merely a rea ction to neurodegeneration. In a human imaging 
study, a marker for activated microglia was significantly increased in abstinent MA users versus non -
using controls and binding levels correlated inversely with the duration of MA abstinence (Sekine, Ouchi 
et al. 2008). Methamphetamine dependent women exhibited severe reductions in glial tricarboxylic acid 
(TCA) cycle rate  compared to healthy control subjects in a magnetic resonance spectroscopy  study , 
providing further evidence of in vivo  glial cell dysfunctio n in methamphetamine users (Sailasuta, 
Abulseoud et al. 2010 ). Furthermore , emerging research suggests that microglial activation may mediate 
MA-induced synaptic plasticity (Narita, Miyatake et al. 2006) thereby [CONTACT_345782] . Among human MA users, increased plasma  levels of pro -inflammatory 
cytokines (IFN -α, IL-1β, IL -2, IL-6, TNF -α) and chemokines (MCP -1, MIP -1α, MIP -1β) were  significantly 
associated with greater neurocognitive dysfunction (Loftis, Choi et al. 2011 ). Together, these results 
suggest that medications that counteract MA -induced neuroinfl ammation and microglial activation may 
reduce MA -induced neurodegeneration and thereby [CONTACT_345783].  
In addition to the potential negative impact of glial -mediated neuroinflammation on MA -related 
neurodegeneration, glial cells also produce neurotrophic factors that may ameliorate  dopaminergic 
dysfunction in MA dependence. For example, glial cell line -derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a nerve 
[ADDRESS_429313] MA Ph II, Protocol     Page 4 of 39              Version 12.0; 9 July 2016  growth factor important in early neuronal development (Carnicella and Ron 2009 ) that is critical to the 
survival and proper functioning of dopaminergic neurons in the adult brain (Pascual, Hidalgo -Figueroa et 
al. 2008 ). GDNF selectively p rotects dopaminergic neurons, but not serotonergic neurons, from MA -
induced neurodegeneration (Cass 1996 ) and increased GDNF expression in the putamen actually 
regenerates dopaminergic neurons and restores dopaminergic functioning in a non -human primate  
model of Parkinson’s Disease (Kells, Eberling et al. 2010 ). GDNF is found at high levels in the striatum 
includ ing the nucleus accumbens and GFRα1 and Ret, the receptors for GDNF, are highly expressed in 
dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (Carnicella and Ron 2009 ). Preclinical studies 
suggest that increased GDNF expression and the activation of the GDNF pathway reduce the 
biochemical and behavioral response to a variety of drugs of abuse including cocaine, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], alcohol, 
and MA. GDNF expression is increased in t he nucleus accumbens in mice following MA administration 
and treatment with the peptide Leu -Ile, which is a GDNF inducer, blocked the development of MA 
conditioned place preference and behavioral sensitization in wild type but not heterozygous GDNF 
knockou t (GDNF +/ -) mice (Niwa, Nitta et al. 2007 ). GDNF +/ - mice have lower levels of GDNF and 
exhibit greater MA conditioned place preference (Niwa, Nitta et al. 2007 ). GDNF +/ - mice acquire stab le 
MA self -administration behavior more quickly than wild type mice, exhibit greater motivation to self -
administer MA (increased dose -response curve for MA self -administration and higher break point on 
progressive ratio schedule) and greater re -instatement  of prime - and cue -induced drug seeking following 
extinction, an effect that remained even 6 months after extinction training (Yan, Yamada et al. 2007 ). In 
humans, polymorphisms in the GDNF gene have been associated with age of onset of MA dependence 
and addiction severity in Japanese MA users  (Yoshimura, Usui et al. 2011 ). GDNF serum levels are 
lower in alcohol dependent volunteers compared to he althy controls and among alcoholics GDNF serum 
levels were inversely correlated with alcohol tolerance (Heberlein, Muschler et al. 2010 ). Together, these 
studies suggest that increasing GDNF is a promising approach to treating MA dependence d ue to its 
neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects that may restore dopaminergic functioning (Gramage and 
Herradon 2011 ) and reduce  the reinforcing effect of MA (Carnicella and Ron 2009 , Ghitza, Zhai et al. 
2010 ). Early clinical trials of GDNF  in Parkinson’s disease have been complicated by [CONTACT_345784] (Richardson, Kells et al. 2011 ) suggesting that 
alternate approaches to enhancing GDNF function for treatment of MA dependence are needed.  
Neuroinflammation and accompanying neurocognitive dysfunction is also a major clinical issue in HIV 
infection, and is exacerbated by [CONTACT_345785]. HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders 
(HAND) are common even with antiretroviral therapy , with 52% of patients in a recent HIV clinical cohort 
exhibiting at least some level of neuropsychological impairment (Heaton, Clifford et al. 2010 ). HIV does 
not directly infect CNS neurons and HAND is thought to result primarily from the infection and 
subsequent activation of CNS macrophages and microglia, which then secrete many of the same pro -
inflammatory cytokines that are also secreted in response to MA including TNF -α, IL-1β, IL -6, and MCP -
1 (Yadav and Collman 2009 ). HIV proteins gp120 and Tat are also neurotoxic and combined with  MA 
exhibit synergistic toxicity on striatal dopaminergic neurons and the blood -brain barrier leading to 
enhanced CNS penetration by [CONTACT_10840] (Silverstein, Shah et al. 2011 ). Not surprisingly, MA abuse increases 
the risk for neurocognitive impairment among HIV infected persons (Rippeth, Heaton et al. 2004 , Carey, 
Woods et al. 2006 ), especi ally with HIV/HCV co -infection (Cherner, Letendre et al. 2005 , Letendre, 
Paulino et al. 2007 ). Greater cognitive dysfunction is associated with poor HIV clinical outcomes 
including medication non -adherence (Becker, Thames et al. 2011 ) and worse quality of life (Parsons, 
Braaten et al. 2006 ). Therefore, m edications that reduce neuroinflammation in HIV infected MA users 
may improve HIV and MA -related clinical outcomes via improvements in neurocognitive functioning.   
Ibudilast  (IBUD; MN -166/AV411) is a non -selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor with preferential 
inhibition of PDE3A, PDE4, PDE10, and PDE11 (Gibson, Hastings et al. 2006 ) that also inhibits  glial cell 
activation (Suzumura, Ito et al. 1999 ) and production of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (Cho, 
Crichlow et al. 2010 ). IBUD has be en used clinically for over [ADDRESS_429314] -stroke dizziness and ocular allergies during which it has 
proven to be safe and well tolerated  (Rolan, Hutchinson et al. 2009 ). IBUD increases expression of 
GDNF in in vitro  studies (Mizuno, Kurotani et al.  2004 ) suggesting that IBUD may ameliorate 
dopaminergic dysfunction amon g MA users via the induction of GDNF expression. IBUD also reduces 
microglial activation in vitro  in preclinical studies (Suzumura, Ito et al. 1999 , Suzumura, Ito et al. 2003 ). 
[ADDRESS_429315] MA Ph II, Protocol     Page 5 of 39              Version 12.0; [ADDRESS_429316] microglial activation and the subsequent cerebrovascular 
white matter lesio ns following bilateral ligation of the carotid arteries (an animal model of vascular 
dementia/cognitive impairment) in rats (Wakita, Tomimoto et al. 2003 ).  IBUD also suppresse d activated 
microglia -induced neuronal cell death in vitro  via inhibiting production of pro -inflammatory cytokines (IL-
1β, IL -6, TNF -α), reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide and increasing the  secretion of anti -
inflammatory mediators (IL-10, nerve gro wth factor, neurotrophin -4, and GDNF) by [CONTACT_345786] 
(Mizuno, Kurotani et al. 2004 ).  
Preclinical studies have found  that IBUD has effects in multiple rodent models of MA dependence 
including reinstatement, locomotor sensitization, and self -administration. Importantly, IBUD demonstrated 
a dose -dependent effect in all three models with the greatest effect at higher doses . In the MA -
reinstatement model, r ats were trained to lever press for MA after which MA infusions were discontinued 
and lever pressing extinguished. IBUD significantly reduced MA prime - and stress -induced reinstatement 
of active lever pressing  (Figure 1)  (Beardsley, Shelton et al. 2010 ) suggesting that IBUD may be effective 
in reducing relapse during clinical treatment for MA dependence. While both IBUD doses reduced stress -
induced reinstatement, only the higher IBUD dose reduced prime -induced reinstatement.

After achieving stable MA self -administration, rats were treated with twice -daily doses of IBUD ( 1, 7.5, 
and 10 mg/kg ). The highest IBUD dose (10 mg/kg) significantly reduced MA self -administration relative to 
the control vehicle condition  (Figure 2)  (Snider, Hendrick et al. 2013 ) suggesting that IBUD may reduce 
MA use  and faci litate initiation of abstinence  in humans during clinical treatment for MA dependence.

IBUD also significantly reduced locomotor sensitization to MA in mice (Snider, Vunck et al. 2012 ). 
Together these studies provide a strong pre -clinical rationale for testing higher doses of IBUD for the 
treatment of MA dependence in humans. The mechanism by [CONTACT_345787]. Reductions in glial 
activation may also play a rol e as IBUD -induced reductions in markers of glial activation following opi[INVESTIGATOR_345739] a reduction in opi[INVESTIGATOR_9801], reduced morphine -induced 
dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens, and blockade of the development of cond itioned place 
preference to morphine (Hutchinson, Lewis et al. 2008 ).  
Clinically, in addition to its use for asthma in Japan, IBUD has been tested in phase 1 and phase 2 
trials  among healthy volunteers as well as patients with diabetic neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, chronic 
headache pain and opi[INVESTIGATOR_345740] 4 50 study participants treated with IBUD and 
160 with matching placebo in these trials to date  (Table  1). In a randomized, double -blind, placebo -
controlled trial (N = 300) for multiple sclerosis (MS), IBUD 60 mg/day reduced time to MS relapse and 
the number of CNS lesions that progressed to persistent “black holes” on MRI suggesting a 
neuroprotective effe ct for IBUD in MS (Barkhof, Hulst et al. 2010 ). Of the IBUD clinical trials to date, this

Serious  Adverse Event deemed related (possibly) to IBUD which was a participant who developed 
hepatic steatosis. As a result, a follow -up phase 2 trial of IBUD 100 mg/d in 250 MS patients is planned 
as part of the NIH -funded NeuroNEXT Network. In trials with IBUD dosing of 80 -100 mg/day, adverse 
events have primarily been GI -related including mild to moderate nausea and diarrhea. T wo female 
participants, one receiving IBUD 60 mg/day and the other 80 mg/day, experienced elevated GGT levels 
which returned to normal following discontinuation of study medication. In general, these studies have 
found IBUD to be safe and well tolerated at doses of 100 mg/day for 2 to 3 weeks, 80 mg/day for 2 
months, and 60 mg/day for up to 2 years. In a two year trial of IBUD for Multiple Sclerosis, 17.6% (15/99) 
of patients on IBUD 60 mg/day had a greater than 30 millisecond increase in QTcF during  one year 
compared to baseline, compared to 11.6% (11/95) of patients on 30 mg/day and 7.8% (8/103) patients 
on placebo. None of these patients experienced a clinical adverse event related to QT changes and only 
one patient (on IBUD 30 mg/day) had a QTcF > 480 milliseconds.  
Our research group recently completed a phase I safety -interaction study of IBUD in MA dependent 
volunteers ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Eleven non -treatment seeking MA dependent volu nteers were admitted to 
an inpatient research unit  for 27 days and nights during which they received infusions with MA (0 mg, 15 
mg, and 30 mg) under placebo, IBUD 20 mg BID, and IBUD 50 mg BID conditions using a randomized 
double -blind, placebo -controlled  within -subjects crossover design. Participants were randomly assigned 
to medication dosing order (placebo, IBUD  20 mg BID, IBUD  50 mg BID versus IBUD  20 mg BID, IBUD  
50 mg BID, placebo) in a counter -balanced fashion.  In addition to the [ADDRESS_429319] MA Ph II, Protocol     Page 8 of 39              Version 12.0; 9 July 2016

One participant had mild anemia (hemoglobin 13.2 with lower limit of normal for lab 13.8) and mild 
elevation of alanine transaminase (ALT 66 with upper limit of normal for lab of 40) on study termination 
labs. The participant reported a previous history of  mild anemia, especially following plasma donation, 
and intermittent elevations of liver enzymes and therefore these were not attributed to study medication. 
No other participants had lab abnormalities.  
One participant had an epi[INVESTIGATOR_345741] s detected on routine cardiac monitoring. The 
ectopic beats occurred approximately 240 minutes after a 15 mg methamphetamine infusion while the 
participant was under the  IBUD  50 mg BID  condition . The nursing staffed notified the study physician that 
the ca rdiac monitors showed a brief run of ventricular bigeminy (a pairing of a normal beat with an 
ectopic beat) running approximately 6 pairs before reverting to normal rhythm. Occasional single 
premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) were also noted. The pa rticipant was in no distress, without 
complaints, and vital signs were normal throughout. A [ADDRESS_429322] 50 mg BID condition; both were 
determined to be artifact or normal variants . In one case  the computer EKG interpretation suggested 
“septal infarct, age undetermined.” Cardiology was consulted, an echocardiogram was done, which 
showed no evidence of septal wall motion abnormality or previous infarct, and the computer 
interpretation was attributed to irregular EKG lead p lacement. The other participant  had an EKG that was 
initially interpreted as having possible ST elev ation suggestive of acute pericarditis. The participant was 
in no distress, vital signs were normal, troponins were negative, and an echocardiogram was normal 
without evidence of pericarditis. The cardiology consultant attributed the EKG abnormality to ear ly 
repolarization, a normal variant, which had been present on the participant’s EKGs throughout. The 
participant completed the remainder of study activities without problems.  
[ADDRESS_429323] MA Ph II, Protocol     Page 9 of 39              Version 12.0; [ADDRESS_429324] did not augment or exacerbate the cardiovascular response to methamph etamine. The 
cardiovascular response to IV methamphetamine (0 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg) during treatment with IBUD  
20 mg BID, IBUD  50 mg BID, and placebo BID and s hown in Figure 3 . Peak systolic blood pressure, 
diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate (maximal  value observed  following IV MA infusion) as well as 
peak change i n systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate (difference between 
maximal value following MA infusion and -15 minute pre -infusion reading) during IBUD  20 mg BID, IBUD  
50 mg BID, and placebo were compared using a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
model that included IBUD  dose, MA dose, order of medication administration, and the interaction 
between IBUD  and MA.  As expected, the main effect for MA was signi ficant (p < 0.05) in all models 
demonstrating that MA infusion resulted in a significant increase in blood pressure and heart rate. 
Results of analyses of IBUD  main effects and IBUD -MA interactions are presented below:  
 There was a significant main effect f or IBUD  on peak heart rate (F = 9.855, d.f. = 2, p = 0.001) but 
the main effect for IBUD  was not significant in models of peak systolic blood pressure (F = 0.854, 
d.f. = 2, p = 0.442) and peak diastolic blood pressure (F = 2.381, d.f. = 2, p = 0.121). The mean 
peak heart rate for IBUD  20 mg BID was 6.0 (S.E. 2.0) beats per minute lower than the mean 
peak heart rate for placebo ( p = 0.017) and the mean peak heart rate for IBUD  50 mg BID was 
7.4 (S.E. 1.8) beats per minute lower than the mean peak heart rate for placebo ( p = 0.002). 
Although statistically significant, these changes in peak heart rate were not clinically significant 
and were not associated with any adverse events among participants.  
 There were no significant interactions between IBUD  and MA in models of peak systolic blood 
pressure (F = 1.255, d.f. = 4, p = 0.305 for interaction term), peak diastolic blood pressure (F = 
0.109, d.f. = 4, p = 0.978), or peak heart rate (F = 0.690, d.f. = 4, p = 0.604).  
 There was no significant main effect for IBUD on mean peak change in systolic blood pressure (F 
= 0.972, d.f. = 2, p = 0.397), diastolic blood pressure (F = 1.195, d.f. = 2, p = 0.326), or heart rate 
(F = 1.168, d.f. = 2, p = 0.333).  
 There were no significant interactions between IBUD  and MA in models of peak change in 
systolic blood pressure (F = 0.369, d.f. = 4, p = 0.829), diastolic blood pressure (F = 0.939, d.f. = 
4, p = 0.452), or heart rate (F = 0.857, d.f. = 4, p = 0.499).  
 There was no effect of IBUD  on daily morning measurements of systolic blood pressure (F = 
0.329, d.f. = 2, p = 0.723), diastolic blood pressure (F = 1.373, d.f. = 2, p = 0.276), or heart rate ( F 
= 1.134, d.f. = 2, p = 0.342).

Together, results of th is phase I clinical trial support the safety and tolerability of IBUD  at the 50 mg BID 
dose used in the current study among MA dependent participants.  
Changes in plasma biomarkers during treatment with IBUD were assessed in a phase 1b/2a trial of 
IBUD in 34 patients with neuropathic pain. There was a significant reduction in plasma MCP -1 with IBUD 
relative to placebo ( p = 0.015), but no change was seen in plasma BDNF, ICAM -1, IL-10, IL -1β, IL -6, 
TNF-α, VCAM -1, MIP -1β, VEGF, or PAI -1 (Medicinova 2011 ). Interestingly, MA users have reduced 
cerebral perfusion (Iyo, Namba et al. [ADDRESS_429327] et al. 2002 ) and 
IBUD has been shown to increase cerebral perfusion post -stroke (Fukuyama, Kimura et al. 1993 ) 
suggesting an additional potential mecha nism for IBUD in MA dependence. IBUD’s neurotrophic and 
neuroprotective effects via induction of GDNF and/or reduction in microglial activation/neuroinfla mmation 
suggest that IBUD may ameliorate the neurotoxic e ffects of MA, especially among HIV positive MA 
users, thereby [CONTACT_345788]. In summary, IBUD has 
multiple effects that may contribute to ameliorating dopaminergic dysfunction and improving cognition 
[ADDRESS_429328] MA Ph II, Protocol     Page 11 of 39              Version 12.0; 9 July 2016  and treatmen t outcomes in MA dependence including reductions in neuroinflam mation and the 
reinforcing effects of MA, and induction of neurotrophic factors such as GDNF. The clinical development 
of IBUD for MA dependence is the result of a long -standing collaboration b etween our research Center 
and MediciNova, Inc. (San Diego, CA) who are fully committed to seeing IBUD through the regulatory 
and marketing process for MA dependence.  
Drug use disorders commonly follow a history of experiencing high levels of early -life s tress (ELS)  
(Repetti, Taylor et al. [ADDRESS_429329], Clark et al. 2005 , Cohen, Paul et al. 
2006 ), which have been linked with neural dysfunction  (Cohen, Grieve et al. 2006 , Seckfort, Paul et al. 
2008 , Baker, Williams et al. 2013 , Philip, Sweet et al. 2013 ). HIV and high ELS have combined 
pathological effects on brain morphometry and neurocognitive function in HIV+ patients  (Clark, Cohen et 
al. 2012 ). MA abuse and high ELS have some common effects, both involving upregulation of 
neuroinflammatory processes. High levels of ELS also are associated with incr eases in pro -inflammatory 
cytokines  (Pollitt, Ka ufman et al. 2007 , Carpenter, Gawuga et al. 2010 , Slopen, Lewis et al. 2010 ). These 
findings suggest that high ELS may exacerbate MA -related neuropathology in HIV+ patients and 
therefore we will explore potential effects of ELS on treatment outcomes as well as interactions with 
ibudilast treatment.  As recent stress and/or trauma may confound any associations between ELS and 
neuroinflammation or cognition, we will assess recent stress and trauma using the Perceived Stress 
Scale (PSS -14) and the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist - Civilian (PCL -C) and control for these 
in our analyses.     
 
 
Research Plan  
The study is a phase 2 clinical trial to determine the safety and efficacy of IBUD for the treatment of 
MA dependence. The trial will be p erformed at the UCLA outpatient research clinic in Hollywood, 
[LOCATION_004] . Treatment -seeking MA dependent volunteers will undergo screening and eligibility 
assessments , including determination of HIV serostatus , during a two -week  placebo lead -in with a high 
value contingency management (CM) behavioral intervention aimed at assessing  participants ’ ability to 
adhere to medication taking and initiate MA abstinence prior to the start of medication, both important 
predictor s of subsequent treatment outcomes (Bisaga, Aharonovich et al. 2005 , Anderson, Reid et al. 
2009 , Bisaga, Aharonovich et al. 2010 ). Eligible participants (N = 140 ) will be randomized, stratified by 
[CONTACT_345789], to IBUD (50 mg BID) or placebo (BID) treatment for 12 wee ks, with twice weekly clinic 
visits for counseling, urine drug tests, and safety/medication adherence monitoring (Figure 4). An urn 
randomization procedure will be used to balance the following variables between active and placebo 
groups: MA use during the  two-week placebo/CM lead -in period , gender, ethnicity  (Hispanic  versus not 
Hispanic ), marijuana  dependence,  and baseline cognitive function.

The study is powered to detect a statistically significant benefit of IBUD over placebo on the primary 
study outcome, MA abstinence during the final two weeks  of treatment (at least one of the two possible 
urine drug screens each week is available during weeks 11 and 12 and all available samples are MA 
negative , the FDA -preferred prim ary efficacy outcome for phase 2 stimulant trials ) in the total sample (N 
= 140). Treatment retention for participants receiving IBUD versus placebo will also be compared.

outcomes in pre -specified subgroups defined by [CONTACT_345790], the ability to achieve 
initial MA abstinence during the placebo/CM lead -in, and baseline HIV serostatus. Exploratory analyses 
aimed at probing the mechanism of actio n for IBUD in MA dependence will examine potential 
associations between treatment outcomes/medication effects and a panel of inflammatory  and 
neurotrophic markers as well as polymorphisms in dopaminergic and GDNF genes.  
As IBUD has putative mechanisms tha t would have additional benefit in patients with MA 
dependence and HIV infection, analyses will also assess potential benefits of IBUD over placebo on the 
following  HIV-related outcomes among HIV positive participants ( up to n = 70): CD4 count and HIV RNA,  
neurocognitive performance, sexual HIV transmission behaviors, and uptake/adherence to HIV 
medications. The study is not powered to detect statistically significant differences in the HIV positive 
subsample but may provide important data to guide the deve lopment of MA medications in this critically 
important clinical population. Results of the trial, if positive, will be used to pursue eventual FDA approval 
and marketing of IBUD for MA dependence, in collaboration with MediciNova, Inc.  
Recruitment procedu res: Using procedures developed by [CONTACT_345791] a community -wide 
advertising campaign including advertising in local print , online (facebook , google ), and media outlets as 
well as listing the study on www.clinicaltrials.gov  and our own website ( http://www.uclacbam.org/ ). We 
also have a referral network in place to receive referrals of potential participants from community -based 
clinics and agencies in the area  and will utilize a UCLA participant pool ( UCLA H IV Research Study 
Volunteer Project, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, UCLA MIRB # 11 -003566 ). Interested 
potential participants will call a toll -free number where a staff member will conduct a telephone screen. If 
the individual appears eligible, a n appointment will be made as soon as possible to initiate informed 
consent and begin the screening process. At that appointment, one of the study clinicians will complete  
the informed consent process.   
Informed Consent:  During the informed consent appoin tment, potential participants are informed of 
the study purpose, procedures, potential risks, and benefits in a private, confidential setting with a study 
clinician . Potential participants will read the informed consent document and review the document in 
detail with a clinician . At this time, and throughout the study period, participants are encouraged to ask 
questions about study procedures and discuss any concerns they have with a clinician . No information 
will be withheld from participants regarding pur pose or design. The potential participant will be told that 
his/her participation is completely voluntary. The potential participant will also be informed of his/her right 
to terminate participation in the study at any time. The potential participant will be asked if he/she has 
any questions, and all questions will be answered. The clinician performing the informed consent will 
assess the participant’s comprehension by [CONTACT_345792]/b enefits as a means of prompting further discussion (e.g "Describe in your 
own words the purpose of the study.") The clinician performing the consent will clarify any 
misunderstandings to ensure the participant has comprehended the consent. Potential participants will 
also be asked if the information they have been given in response to all questions has been adequate 
and understood.  They will then be asked whether they have decided that they would like to participate in 
the study, whether th ey would like to have additional time to arrive at a decision, and/or whether they 
would like to discuss their possible participation in this study with some other person. Referrals to 
appropriate local treatment resources are offered at any point to those  who decide not to participate in 
the research study and are interested in the referrals. After completion of the informed consent process, 
participants who remain interested in taking part in the research will sign the consent document, receive 
a copy of the informed consent form, a copy of the Human Subject’s Bill of Rights, in addition to contact 
[CONTACT_345793] . The clinician  obtaining consent will sign the consent form as a 
witness.   
For informed consent procedures, we will follow the 1991 Code of Federal Regulations (45 CFR 
46.102) that defines “research” as a systematic investigation designed to develop or contribute to 
generalizable knowledge. Guiding principles include respect for persons, beneficence, and just selection 
of rese arch subjects. The informed consent process will conform to these policies and to UCLA’s consent 
form standards, including the handling and processing of anonymized genetics specimens, and the 
process will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_345794].   
[ADDRESS_429332] MA Ph II, Protocol     Page 13 of 39              Version 12.0; 9 July 2016  Two-week Placebo +CM Lead -in Period: After providing written informed consent, participants will 
begin a two -week  (six-visit) outpatient lead -in period during which they will attend the outpatient research 
clinic thrice -weekly and complete a comprehensive assessm ent of their baseline drug us e and 
psychological/ medical status, including a medical history and physical exam, EKG, labs, HCV and HIV 
serotesting, and other study measures (see Measures below). An EKG will be repeated if results indicate 
a corrected QT of > 450 msecs in men or > 460 msec in women (see below). Participants will complete a 
neurocognitive battery on the final week  of the lead -in period  as described below . All participants will take 
placebo capsules twice daily during the lead -in period. The placebo capsules will contain riboflavin which 
will be used to assess participants’ ability to adhere to medication taking. Participants will be allowed one 
urine specimen during the lead -in with a riboflavin concentration less than 900 ng/ml  as measured via UV 
fluorescence, but any participant with more than one of the five (excluding the day of consent) possible 
urine samples below the 900 ng/ml threshold will be considered medication non -adherent and will not be 
eligible. In addition, subje cts must provide at least one MA positive urine drug screen during the lead -in 
period.  The two -week lead -in period may be extended at the discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_345742], 
including telephone consents, holidays, etc.  
A high -value CM intervention adapted from (Bisaga, Aharonovich et al. 2010 ) will be used to 
characterize  participants on their ability to achieve initi al MA abstinence during the second week  of the 
lead-in period , a potential confounder of subsequent medication effects . Participants will be instructed at 
the first study visit that they  will have the chance to earn gift cards for providing MA -free urine drug 
screens during the second week of the lead -in period. Participants will receive $[ADDRESS_429333] MA -free 
urine provided during the second week, $2 5 for the second MA -free urine prov ided, and $ [ADDRESS_429334] their su bsequent participation and those unable to abstain will be encouraged to complete the 
screening in order to avoid differential attrition. Participants will be stratified in secondary analyses by 
[CONTACT_345795] -week lead -in period. All 
participants will receive $25 in gift cards upon completion of the screening measures, regardless of urine 
drug screen results, to compensate participants for time spent completing screening measures. 
Participants  who complete all baseline/eligibility assessments and meet all eligibility criteria will be 
randomized and begin study treatments and medication  within 1 week of completion of screening 
measures

Comprehensive feedback will be provided to subjects who are judged not suitable for the study for any 
psychiatric or medical reason. Participants who fail to complete all baseline data collection and 
procedures within two weeks will not be randomized into the trial. Subjects who are MA abstinent upon 
entry to the lead -in period are excluded as they are highly likely to remain abstinent regardless of 
treatment (Hillhouse, Marinelli -Casey et al. 2007 ).  
Randomization Procedures:   When p articipants are determined to be eligible and are cleared by 
[CONTACT_345796], they will be randomized to either IBUD 50 mg BID  or placebo BID , 
stratified by [CONTACT_345797] ( up to 70 HIV positive). In addition, within each str ata an urn 
randomization procedure  (Stout, Wirtz et al. 1994 ) will be used to provide multivariate balance across 
conditions along the following variables that may influence treatment outcomes: MA abstinent versus not 
abstinent as confirmed via urine  drug screen  during the second week of the lead -in period , (MA 
abstinence will be confirmed with at least two urine drug screens negative for presence of MA and no 
urine drug screen positive for MA , while  all other urine drug screen results will be conside red not 
abstinent ), gender  (biologic male v ersus  female ), ethnicity  (Hispanic v ersus not H ispanic , marijuana  
dependence (dependent v ersus not as assessed by [CONTACT_73794]) , and baseline cognitive function (greater than 
26 on the MoCA versus 25 or less) . Participants will be considered to have entered the trial for the 
intention to treat analysis at the point of randomization. The randomization key will be maintained off -site 
in the Research office.  
Outpatient Treatment Procedures:  Participants will attend  the outpatient research clinic twice  
weekly for urine drug screens, counseling, assessment of substance use and other standardized 
research measures (see below), and safety and medication adherence monitoring for [ADDRESS_429337]-medication safety monitoring.  
Experimental Drug Procedures:  Experimental medication w ill be obtained from MediciNova. The 
study drug is Ibudilast (MN -166, previously known as AV411 ) and the product is delayed -release 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_261936]® capsules, the Japanese generic  IBUD  product prod uced by [CONTACT_345798] . Matching placebo capsules will also be supplied by [CONTACT_262177]. The doses 
[ADDRESS_429338] MA Ph II, Protocol     Page 15 of 39              Version 12.0; [ADDRESS_429339] been 10 mg strength and formulation modification to 20 -50 mg dosage strengths are 
in process.  Should this protocol involve dosing at strengths greater than 10 mg, then supportive 
documents/amendments would be filed in advance of the change.  In addition, all participants will also 
take a daily dose of 25 mg ribo flavin for assessment of medication adherence  via urinary riboflavin  
(Herron, Mariani et al. 2010 ), one capsule in the AM and one capsule in the PM each containing 12. 5 mg 
riboflavin  (details under adherence monitoring below) . All capsules will be prepared by [CONTACT_345799]. Upon receipt of a prescription signed by [CONTACT_1003] , the un -blinded pharmacist 
prepares and sends a supply of study medication  in blister packaging to the study clinic. . After 
randomization, pa rticipants will take the first dose of study medication at the research clinic under 
observation by [CONTACT_345800] -
administration at home . Participants will then meet with a study clinician  and exchange the empty blister 
package for a new blister package. Participants will be in possession of the current week and next 
week’s medication supply  so that they will not run out of medication in t he event that they miss one of the 
medication dispensing visits. Unused medication will be recorded for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_345745]. Additional details concerning medication adherence 
procedures are  detailed  below.  
Dose Justification:  Dosing for IBUD will be [ADDRESS_429340] that CNS 
applications such as addiction will require higher doses to achieve clinically significant reductions in glial 
activation than those currently in clinical use for asthma, dizziness, and allergies (≤ 30mg a day). The 
dosage selected for the current study (20 mg BID titrated to 50 mg BID) was selected  in consultation with 
MediciNova  scientists and based on preclinical and clinical PK -PD in methamphetamine dependence 
and other neuropharmacological settin gs. Reflecting experience in recent MediciNova safety trials , 
including our group’s  phase I safety trial of IBUD in MA dependent volunteers , 50 mg BID has been well 
tolerated, adverse events being easily managed and 50 mg BID representing the upper limit o f what the 
manufacturer believes is the preferable well -tolerated and potentially efficacious dose for an addiction 
indication. The half -life of IBUD is about 1 8 hours (Rolan, Gibbons et al. 2008 ) justifying BID dosing. A 
large clinical trial of IBUD 50 mg BID for Multiple Sclerosis (N=250; MN -166-NeuroNext ) is anticipated to  
begin enrolling soon in the U.S. and also a phase 2 trial in the U.K. (MS -SMART) is pending ([ADDRESS_429341]) based on a previous trial that found 
30 mg and 60 mg IBUD daily to be well tolerate d and display dose -dependent effects on surrogate 
clinical outcomes (Barkhof, Hulst et al. 2010 ). The study  clinician  may reduce a participant’s dose from 
100 mg/day to 80 mg/day ( 40 mg in AM and 40 mg in PM) , or potentially 30 mg BID,  for any potential 
dose -related side effects but dose increases will not be allowed.  
As IBUD  is not currently clinically available in the US, information concerning possible adverse 
events come from results of clinical trials conducted by [CONTACT_345801] (Avigen /MediciNova ) ranging 
from 30 -100 mg/day and from experience with clinical use  in Asia  (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 30 mg/day) . In 
Avigen /MediciNova trials,  ~[ADDRESS_429342] been treated in the clinical development of IBUD  with no 
SAEs clearly linked to IBUD  and one severe AE of hepatic steatosis (possibly -related) at 30 mg/d IBUD  
and one moderate hepatotoxicity deemed related to IBUD  (at 60 mg/d); both at [ADDRESS_429343] frequently reported adverse events in trials of IBUD with 
fatigue, rash, hyperhidrosis, dizziness, hypotension, and tachycardia observed less frequently and more 
common with placebo than IBUD . According to the package insert for Ketas® (name [CONTACT_345826]), the most f requently observed adverse reactions are anorexia (weight loss; <1%), 
nausea (<1%), increased AST (GOT) levels (<1%), increased ALT (GPT; <1%), and thrombocytopenia 
(<1%). IBUD  is metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_097]2B6 and CYP2E1 and weakly inhibits CYP1A2, while  MA is 
primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2D6 suggesting that clinically significant IBUD -MA interactions are not 
likely  (nor observed in our phase Ib trial) . There have been no significant drug -drug interactions observed 
to date in clinical studies of IBUD among  patients being treated for diabetes, neuropathic pain, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2560], MOH pain, or multiple sclerosis. There is no evidence to suggest important drug -drug 
interactions between IBUD and HIV antiretroviral medications. Results of these studies and clini cal 
[ADDRESS_429344] MA Ph II, Protocol     Page 16 of 39              Version 12.0; 9 July 2016  experience at the doses proposed here (up to 50 mg BID) suggest that IBUD  is likely to be safe and well 
tolerated in study participants.  
Medication Adherence Support/Monitoring:  After randomization, participants will visit the clinic 
and take the first dose of study medication under supervision  of a study clinician . A comprehensive 
medication adherence support program that reinforces the importance of medication adherence at every 
clinical encounter with participants will be used and will include t he following elements:  
 Medication adherence c ounseling  (Osterberg and Blaschke 2005 ): Medication adherence 
counseling is an integral part of the Medical Management Counseling that is provided as part of 
the trial . At the initial visit when the participant starts study medication, he/she will meet with the 
study physician/nurse /counselor  and review how to take the medication. The use of the blister 
package (see below) will be reviewed and the critical impo rtance of daily medication adherence 
will be stressed. Participants will be instructed to take the study medication daily and assisted in 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a practical plan for incorporating medication taking into their daily routine. The need 
for adherence in or der to obtain any potential clinical benefit from the study medication will be 
emphasized. Participants will also be instructed to report any perceived medication side effects to 
study clinicians immediately such that they can be promptly addressed and rem oved as potential 
barrier to medication adherence (in addition to insuring participant safety). At least weekly, 
participants will meet with the study clinician  to review recent medication adherence. Reasons for 
any non -adherence will be explored and a pla n will be developed to address any non -adherence 
(including possible dose adjustments in the event of side effects). At each study visit, staff will 
reinforce adherence counseling by [CONTACT_345802] a ny issues regarding non -adherence will be referred to the study clinician . 
Participants who miss a study visit will receive a telephone call and/or text message to remind 
them to take their medication daily as instructed and to attend their next scheduled visit. Any non -
adherence will be addressed by [CONTACT_345803] a non -confrontational approach aimed at 
bolstering participant self -efficacy and motivation to achieve high adherence.  
 Study medication will be dispensed in blister packages , which have been shown to be an 
effective intervention to promote adherence (Haynes et al., 2005 ). Participants will receive $[ADDRESS_429345] any unused medication in the blister package such that participants’ self -reported pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] -
taking beh aviors can be reconciled with the remainder of pi[INVESTIGATOR_345746] -home blister packet. In 
addition to IBUD or placebo capsules, participants will take  one capsule containing 12.5 mg 
riboflavin  twice daily (total of 25 mg daily if the participant is adherent  to both the AM and PM 
doses ). At each study visit, urine specimens will be analyzed via fluorimetry  for quantitative 
measurement of riboflavin as an objective measure of medication adherence during study data  
analysis.  Urine specimens with a riboflavin concentration greater than or equal to 900 ng/ml will 
be considered positive and indicative  of medication adherence (Herron, Mariani et al. 2010 ). We 
use [ADDRESS_429346] ion (Herron, Mariani et 
al. 2010 ). The study clinician will feed back riboflavin results to participants at each visit and 
counsel particip ants regarding any negative riboflavin results.  
 An aliquot (5 ml) fro m each of the twice -weekly urine specimens during the 12 week medication 
period  will be collected  for measurement of concentrations of IBUD and its primary metabolite 
(6,7-dihydrodiol -ibudilast ) as a “snapshot” biological assessment of medication adherence  
during the trial. One sample will be collected immediately prior to starting study medication 
(negative control) . In addition, one serum sample (10 ml blood ) will be c ollected from participants 
during week [ADDRESS_429347] dose of study medication before providing the sample.  
Drug Accountability : Medical staff at the clinic will keep a dispensing log and drug accountability 
record for each subject enrolled in the study. Such records will be made available for verification by 
[ADDRESS_429348] MA Ph II, Protocol     Page 17 of 39              Version 12.0; 9 July 2016  relevant regulatory personnel as required . Upon completion of count verification, unused participant -
return ed medication and expi[INVESTIGATOR_345747] . 
Emergency Unblinding Procedures : The research pharmacist will provide the principal investigator 
[CONTACT_4490] a set of sealed envelopes containing individual randomiza tion assignment numbers allowing the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_345748] a clinical emergency, should that be necessary.  
Counseling  Procedures : Participants will attend an initial introductory counseling session (60 
minutes) during the baseline period to review the participant’s past experience with medication taking, 
identify any barriers to medication adherence, and explain the adherence monitoring via riboflavin during 
the lead -in period. A study clinician may follow -up wit h participants at subsequent lead -in visits if there is 
any indication of medication non -adherence or if participants have questions regarding the riboflavin 
adherence monitoring. Participants will then attend a session during week 1 of the study medicatio n 
treatment  period  to review medication adherence thus far and explain the study medication regimen 
(approximately 60 minutes) followed by [CONTACT_345804] -up counseling sessions (20 minutes) during the 
remainder of the 12 week medication treatment period. As  the study is a medication trial, we will employ 
a medically -based counseling platform  -- Medical Management (MM) counseling  -- as used in the 
COMBINE study of alcohol dependence pharmacotherapy (Pettinati and National Institute on Alcohol 
Abuse and Alcoholism (U.S.) 2004 , Pettinati, Weiss et al. 2005 ) which we have adapted for stimulant 
dependence trials. As medication  non-adherence is a severe threat to the validity of any medication trial, 
it is critical that medication adherence is central to the counseling intervention provided. In addition, the 
use of a medically -based counseling approach that can be implemented by  [CONTACT_105]-specialist clinicians in 
primary care settings is likely to be more generalizable than a cognitive behavioral therapy platform in 
light of the national trend towards the integration of addiction treatment into primary care settings. The 
MM counseling sessions will be delivered by a study physician/nurse or counselor following a manual 
developed for the trial. A primary focus of MM is to help clinicians provide education, support, and 
strategies to ensure that participants  are medication compli ant. Core  components of MM include: (1) 
providing  participants  strategies for taking their medic ations and staying in treatment, (2) educating 
participants about MA dependence and pharmacotherapy, (3) supporting their efforts to reduce or stop 
MA use, (4) making di rect recommendations that participants change their drug use behaviors.  
The initial MM session lasts 60 minutes  and covers: (1) Review the results from his/her screening 
evaluation a nd address any medical concerns, (2) Use the results from the evaluation to support the 
diagnosis of MA dependence, provide basic information about the disorder (including pr ognosis), and 
advise abstinence, (3) Provide a rationale for and in formation about pharmacotherapy, (4) Provide a 
rationale for evaluating medica tion compl iance at each session, (5) Use the patient’s history of taking 
medication to establish an individualized plan that wi ll ensure medication compliance, (6) Encourage 
participation in mutual -support groups (e.g., AA, SMART Recovery ), and ( 7) Answer any questi ons or 
concerns about treatment. Follow -up visits last 20 minutes and cover: (1) A medical check on th e 
participant’s general functioning, (2) Review results of the participant’s urine drug screen s, (3) Review 
the participant’s vital signs, (4) Ask about m edication side eff ects and concurrent medications, (5) 
Perform a brief assessment of the  participant’s drug use and HIV risk behaviors, (6) Assess his/her 
medication compliance, and (7) Make recommendations for the participant  to follow until the next visi t. 
To ensure integrity in the delivery  of the counseling sessions, Dr . Heinzerling will provide corrective 
feedback as needed to study clinicians , monitor adherence to the counseling manual throu gh review of 
audiotaped sessions , and in weekly supervision meetings .  
MA Urine Drug Screen Procedures:  Participants will have a urine drug screen collected at each 
clinic visit that will be assessed for MA -metabolites using standard point of care immunoassay drug 
screen urine cups  with a  threshold of 300ng/mL . If a participant is unable to attend a clinic visit ( e.g. out 
of town, holiday, etc.), subjects may provide drug screening samples using oral test kits.  
“Drop -out” Subject Tracking : Subjects who have not rescinded consent, but are no longer 
available/interested in attending twice -weekly visits (“drop -outs”) will be followed using alternative 
methods.  Every effort will be made for all subjects in the trial to attend a minimum of one clinic visit a 
week. However, attrition in Phase [ADDRESS_429349] weekly during the course of 
the medication phase of the trial at a mutually -agreeable location and/or taxi the  participant to the clinic 
to collect a urine drug sample and complete data typi[INVESTIGATOR_345749] a weekly basis.  
[ADDRESS_429350] MA Ph II, Protocol     Page 18 of 39              Version 12.0; 9 July 2016  Termination and Follow -Up Procedures : Once participants complete the 12 -week medication 
period, they will be asked to return during week 13 for a repeat EKG, labs, and physical exam, and for 
follow -up assessment. On the final visit (approximately 30 days after completing study medications), 
participants will complete a brief health check with a study clinician . Every effort will be made to ret ain all 
participants through the entire trial. Our group has developed effective procedures for retaining 
individuals in controlled experimental drug trials (e.g., building strong relationships with study 
participants , telephone , texting, and letter proced ures).  Similar strategies will be implemented for this 
proposed study.  However, we recognize that not all participants will complete the trial.  Early termination 
criteria by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_345750] (or four consec utive visits) of 
missed study activity or data collection visits. Participants who end the trial early, for whatever reason, 
will be asked to attend the 4 -week follow -up visits.  
Safety Procedures:  A study clinician  will assume primary medical responsibility for each participant 
and will personally evaluate any significant complaints, clinical adverse events, or abnormal laboratory 
finding. The observation of the initial dose of study medication at the clinic will pro vide an added level of 
safety monitoring that will enable the study clinicians  to ensure that participants are able tolerate study 
medications in the outpatient setting. Participants will be provided with instructions on how to contact [CONTACT_345805] a [ADDRESS_429351] danger due to continued drug use and/or to extreme psychiatric problems 
will be discontinued from the study and connected with an appropriate treatment facility.  All study staff 
receive  training in identifying suicide/homicide risks and/or signs of dangerous intoxication and in the 
steps needed to appropriately respond to these signs. In the event a participant is a potential risk to harm 
himself or others, Distress Protocol procedures w ill be followed to insure that the participant is assessed 
by a licensed clinic ian as soon as possible  (see Appendix I) . There have been rare occurrences of 
elevations in GGT levels (two participants of IBUD clinical tr ials to date) and as a result basic l ab tests 
(hematology, chemistry, and hepatic panel s including  GGT ) will be rechecked for each participant during 
week 3 , and week 8  of the medication period , as well as at termination (week 13) . Any participant 
experiencing an SAE will be followed until th e resolution of the SAE.  
Study Medication Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869] : With respect to medication stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418], mild to moderate 
symptoms of agitation, hostility, depressed mood, and changes in behavior or thinking are typi[INVESTIGATOR_345751]/or 
withdrawal and will not alone trigger discontinuation of IBUD . Agitation, hostility, depressed mood, and 
changes in behavior or thinking that are NOT typi[INVESTIGATOR_345752], i.e. 
severity greater than moderate and/or temporally un -related to methamphetamine use/withdrawal, will 
trigger immediate discontinuation of IBUD  and evaluation by [CONTACT_1003] . 
 Pre-specified criteria for dis continuation of study medication include:  
a)   Development of agitation, hostility, depressed mood, or changes in behavior or thinking not 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_345753] (more severe and/or temporally un -related to 
methamphetamine use/withdra wal) 
b)  Development of any psychiatric condition requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_345754]  
c)  Suicide attempt or active serious suicidal ideation as assessed by [CONTACT_941] C -SSRS or verbal 
report  
d)  Development of a medical condition that contraindicates treatment using IBUD  (e.g., 
treatment with beta -agonists or phosphodiesterase inhibitors for asthma)  
e)   Severe nausea and vomiting that does not respond to a reduction in study medicatio n 
f)  Increa sing methamphetamine use that requires more intensive care than outpatient  treatment  
g)  Have a systolic blood pressure greater than 160, or a diastolic blood pressure greater than 
100 (i.e. cutoffs for stage 2 hypertension), or a heart rate greater than 70% of the maximum 
heart rate expected for their age (0.70(220 -age)) at any visit  
h)  Confirmed QTc > 500 miliseconds on ECG or increase in QTc > 60 milliseconds from baseline 
(QTc to be determined on at least two ECGs)  
i)  Females who become pregnant  
j) Incarceration or mandated court urine testing  
[ADDRESS_429352] MA Ph II, Protocol     Page 19 of 39              Version 12.0; 9 July 2016  k)  Any other circumstances that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_7372], would compromise 
participant safety (e.g. onset of alcohol abuse, mania, etc.)  
The study clinician  may reduce a participant’s dose from 100 mg/day to 80 mg/da y (40 mg in AM and 40 
mg in PM) , or potentially 30 mg BID,  for any potential dose -related side effects but dose increases will 
not be allowed. The study physician may temporarily discontinue (hold) study medication for up to two 
weeks fol lowed by [INVESTIGATOR_1312] -initiation of study medication in the event of transient adverse events but if the 
medication is not re -started within two weeks of holding, the medication will be discontinued. If the 
medication is discontinued, medication adherence checks and  compensation will be discontinued as 
well. Urine samples will be collected for UV fluorimetry and storage up to [ADDRESS_429353] -medication 
discontinuation. MM counseling will continue through the remaining study weeks (up to week 12) to 
support and monitor th e participant.  
Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and Trial Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]: A Data  and Safety 
Monitoring Plan will be submitted to NIDA and the UCLA Addiction Medicine DSMB and approved prior 
to enrolling participants. The UCLA Addiction Medicine DSMB  will monitor the study and review study 
progress and adverse events after the first [ADDRESS_429354] yearly. 
Any SAEs that occur will be reported to the DSMB, as well as all other regulatory bodies monitoring the 
trial (e.g. FDA, NIDA, UCLA IRB) at the time of the occurrence of the SAE. In addition, a n interim blinded 
group analysis will be performed once mid -way through the trial when approximately half of the proposed 
[ADDRESS_429355] been enrolled. At this time, t he person responsible for randomization will confirm 
that randomization is proceeding according to the protocol.  
While statistical guidelines for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_345755] , they are intended as a  guide for 
the DSMB and other regulatory bodies to use in making a determination as to whether the trial should be 
stopped or continued and will not in isolation trigger discontinuation of the trial. The following statistical 
guidelines are provided for co nsideration of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356]:  
 If the frequency of SAEs is statistically significantly greater ( p < 0.05) in the IBUD group 
compared to the placebo group at interim analysis or anytime during the trial, consider 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356].  
 If there is a stati stically significant ( p < 0.05) difference in the primary study outcome (MA 
abstinence verified by [CONTACT_345806]) favoring the 
placebo over the IBUD group (e.g. suggesting significantly worse treatment outcomes and 
greater MA use during treatment with IBUD), consider stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356].  
Following the interim analysis or the occurrence of any severe, unexpected adverse events, the DSMB 
will review results of blinded group analyses, progress of the trial to date, and revisit the risks versus 
benefits of the trial for participants and society, and make recommendations regarding the continuation 
or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_84953]. The final decision regarding stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_345756] ( [CONTACT_287397]), NIDA, the DSMB, and other regulatory bodies (FDA, UCLA IRB) as 
appropriate.  
Collection Procedures  and Analysis of DNA  and Inflammatory Markers : All participants will have 
blood (10 ml) collected during the lead -in period  for genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007] . DNA will be extracted from samples at 
the UCLA Biological Samples Processing Core Facility using the Autopure LS ® (Gentra Systems, 
Minneapolis, MN) automated DNA purification system. After purification, DNA will be frozen at -20ºC 
until genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_345757]. Participants will be genotyped via allelic 
discrimination with the Taqman 5’ –nuclease assay on the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System 
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) at the UCLA Sequencing and Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_345758]. 
Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_345759] 6.5 statistical 
software package. To avoid issues of population stratification, analyses will be stratified by [CONTACT_124940].  
The following SNPs will be genotyped  (Table  3): rs2910704 in GDNF which is associated with 
severity of MA dependence in a Japanese study (Yoshimura, Usui et al. 2011 ); the A1 allele of the DRD2 
Taq1 A polymorphism (rs1800497), actually downstream of DRD2 within the gene for the ANKK1 kinase 
(Neville, Johnstone et al. 2004 ), is associated with reduced striatal D2 availab ility in human autopsy 
(Thompson, Thomas et al. 1997 , Ritchie and Noble 2003 ) and [11C] raclopride PET studies (Pohjalainen, 
Rinne et al. 1998 , Jonsson, Nothen et al. 1999 ); C957T in the D2 dopamine receptor gene (DRD2) which 
is associated with striatal D2 recept or availability on PET (Hirvonen, Laakso et al. 2004 , Hirvonen, 
Laakso et al. 2009 ) and response inhibition assessed via the stop signal task (Colzato, van den 
[ADDRESS_429356] MA Ph II, Protocol     Page 20 of 39              Version 12.0; 9 July 2016  Wildenberg et al. 2010 ); rs12364283 within DRD2 which is associated with altered D2 dopamine receptor 
expression (Zhang, Bertolino et al. 2007 ); and rs2283265 and rs1076560 in DRD2 which result in 
alternative splicing of DRD2 RNA and changes in the relative expression of the long (found 
postsynaptically) and shor t (found presyna ptically) isoforms of the D2 dopamine receptor (Zhang, 
Bertolino et al. 2007 ) and are associated with cocaine abuse in Caucasians (Moyer, Wang et al. 2011 ).

Plasma  and seru m will be collected during the lead -in period and during week s 3, 8 and 13  to 
measure inflammatory  and neurotrophic markers . Plasma levels of the following inflammatory cytokines 
and chemokines will be determined via multiplex assay:  IFN-α, IL-1β, IL -2, IL-6, TNF -α, MCP -1, MIP -1α, 
MIP-1β, and MIF. Serum levels of neurotrophic factors, GDNF  and BDNF , will be determined via 
singleplex assays . In addition to the above markers, CRP and  uric acid  will also be measured from 
serum at baseline and week s 3, 8 and 13  via ELISA and Uricase assays , respectively. Potential changes 
in inflammatory markers with treatment for MA dependence will be assessed.  
Neuropsychological Assessment:  A battery of neuropsychological (NP) tests will be administered 
to approximately half of the sample (N = 70) at baseline , week 4,  and immediately following 
discontinuation of study medication  (week 13) . As acute stimulant use masks neurocognitive deficits in 
stimulant abusers (Woicik, Moeller et al. 2009 ), participants will receive gift cards for providing 
methamphetamine -free urine samples during the second week of the lead -in period  when baseline 
cognitive testing will be done.  Any potential confounding effect of MA use on cognitive battery results will 
be explored in the data analysis.  
In addition to the comprehensive pre - and post-medication NP battery, brief serial assessments w ill 
be administered during the medication treatment period (weeks 1 -12) to examine potential changes in 
both top -down ( Iowa Gambling Task ) and bottom up (Stop Signal test) cognitive processing approaches 
during treatment. The Connors’ CPT will be administe red on weeks 2, 6 and 10.  
Note: Collection of data for the neurocognitive battery was concluded after randomization of [ADDRESS_429358] Reimbursement:  Subjects will be reimbursed for time spent completing study measures 
and costs related to transportation to and from the clinic in the form of gift cards only; no cash is provided 
to subjects  (Table 4).

Participants may receive compensation for the CM intervention during the second week of the two -
week lead -in period as follows: Participants will receive $[ADDRESS_429364] MA -free urine provided during the 
second week, $2 5 for the secon d MA -free urine provided, and $[ADDRESS_429365] MA -free urine provided  
for a maxim um of $80 for all three clean urine drug screens . All participants will receive $25 in gift cards 
upon completion of the screening measures, regardless of urine drug screen results , to compensate 
participants for time spent completing screening measures.  Participants will receive $5  in gift cards for 
completing weekly medication pi[INVESTIGATOR_345761] 12 week medication period  for a total of $ 60. During 
week 1 through week 10 of the medication treatment period, participants will receive $10 for each of the 
twice  weekly v isits attended . During weeks 11 and 12, participants will recei ve $25 for each of the twice  
weekly v isits attended . Participants who miss a clinic visit will not rece ive compensation for that visit . 
During baseline, and week s 4 and  13, half of the subjects  (n = 70)  will be compensated for complet ing 
the Iowa Gambling cognitive task (see below) and will  earn $[ADDRESS_429366] session for a possible 
maximum of $ 30. The following pertain to the initial 85 participants who will undergo neuroc ognitive 
testing: Participants who complete the neurocognitive testing will be randomized to the pay or no pay 
condition based on their assigned screening identification (SID) number, where an SID ending in an even 
number will be assigned to the pay condit ion and an SID ending in an odd number will be assigned to the 
no pay condition  for the remainder of the study .  In addition, subjects will earn $[ADDRESS_429367] battery during week 4 and at termination (week 13)  and $5 each time they complete the 
Connors’ CPT task (weeks 2, 6, and 10 for a total of $15 possible).  For all participants, d uring weeks 13, 
14 and 15, participants will receive $10 for each weekly visit attended.  Finally, subjects are reimbursed 
$15 for completing the final study close out visit (week 16). The total reimbursement that participants 
could earn during the trial is $5 95 (pay condition for Iowa Gambling Task) or $565 (no pay condition for 
Iowa Gambling Task)  for participants completing the n eurocognitive testing and $510 for participants 
participating after the close of the neurocognitive testing portion of the trial .   
Study Mea sures and Assessments : The following assessments have been selected to provide a 
comprehensive assessment of parti cipants’ medical and psychological status and severity of MA 
dependence at baseline as well as response to treatment including MA use, psychological symptoms 
and cravings, and adverse events.  Appendix II presents all study assessments in a table format.  
Addiction Severity Index (ASI) Lite  (McLellan, Kushner et al. 1992 ) estimates the severity of 
participants’ reported addiction -related problems. The ASI is a standardized 40 -minute clinical research 
instrument widely used in addiction res earch to quantify problem areas of alcohol/drug user populations. 
The following seven areas of functioning are measured: medical, employment, drug use, alcohol use, 
legal, family/social, and psychiatric conditions.  This measure will be administered during  the lead -in 
period.  
An adverse event  (AE) is defined as any reaction, side effect, or untoward event that occurs during 
the course of the clinical trial, whether or not the event is considered related to the study medications.  
For this study, AEs will in clude events reported by [CONTACT_423], as well as clinically significant abnormal 
[ADDRESS_429368] MA Ph II, Protocol     Page 22 of 39              Version 12.0; 9 July 2016  findings on physical examination or laboratory evaluations.  AEs will be assessed during screening, 
weekly during the medication phase, and at follow up .  
Barratt Impulsivenes s Scale -11 (BIS -11), administered during screening, is a 30 -item questionnaire 
(e.g., “I act on impulse”, “I plan tasks carefully”) that has been validated in several different populations. 
The BIS -11 includes three subscales labeled attentional, nonplanning, and motor (Patton et al., 1995).  
Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI , Derogatis,1993)  is a 53-item self -report clinical rating scale used to 
assess psychological distress.  This measure will be administered during screening and monthly.  
Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  is a brief questionnaire that was developed at the 
request of the FDA for monitoring of suicidality in subjects in clinical trials. The questionnaire takes 5 
minutes to administer and tracks both suicidal behavior and ide ation and provides a summary measure 
of suicidality that can be serially tracked over the course of a clinical trial (Posner, Oquendo et al. 2007 ). 
This measure will be administered during the lead -in period and weekly during the medication and follow 
up phase.  
Concomitant Medications:   All subjects will be asked about concomitant medications weekly during 
the lead-in and outpatient treatment period. Concomitant medications include both OTC and prescribed 
medicati ons. 
Early Life Stress Questionnaire (E LSQ):  The Early Life Stress Questionnaire (McFarlane, Clark et al. 
2005 ) (ELSQ) is a self -report questionnaire that considers 19 adverse life events (crime, sexual abuse, 
family conflict, bullying, etc.). High ELS is d efined as exposure to ≥  3 ELS events prior to age 19  (Cohen, 
Paul et al. 2006 , Paul, Henry et al. 2008 , Seckfort, Paul et al. 2008 , Clark, Cohen et al. 2012 ), consistent 
with the rates of ELS in the general population  (Cohen, Paul et al. 2006 ). Previous studies (Cohen, 
Grieve et al. 2006 , Cohen, Paul et al. 2006 , Seckfort, Paul et al. 2008 , Clark, Cohen et al. 2012 ) have 
shown that using a cut -point of ≥  [ADDRESS_429369] discrimination on the basis of ELS 
for behavioral and neural measures.  The ELSQ will be administered during  week 3 . 
Perceived Stress Scale ( PSS-14): The PSS -14 is a validated, self-report questionnaire that assesses 
the exten t to which individuals perceive their life to be stressful (Cohen and Williamson 1988 ). The PSS-
[ADDRESS_429370] - Civilian version (PLC -C): is the most commonly used self -
report questionnaire assessing number and severity of PTSD symptoms The PLC -C will be administered 
during week 3 . 
Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/SNP : 10 ml whole  blood will be collected at baseline for DNA extraction for genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_345762].  
Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD)  (Riskind, Beck et al. 1987 ): Completed in just 5 to 10  
minutes, the HAMD can be used to quickly evaluate symptom severity, to confirm a diagnosis of 
depression, to explore depressive symptoms, and to measure treatment outcome. The HAMD will be 
administered during the lead -in period and weekly during the medic ation and follow -up phase.  
HIV CD4 Count and Viral Load : Participants who are HIV+ will have CD4 count and viral load 
measured at baseline, at the termination of medication (week 13) , and at the last follow -up visit (week 
16).  
HIV medication adherence : Participants who are HIV positive will have their HIV medication 
adherence assessed monthly by [CONTACT_345807].  
HIV Risk -taking Behavior Scale : This is a self -administered assessme nt of the subject’s engagement 
in activities that increase the likelihood of contracting HIV (Darke et al, 1991). This measure will be 
administered at scre (McDonald and Calhoun 2010 )ening and monthly during the medication phase.  
MA Craving Visual Analog Scale  (Griffiths et al., 1993): Craving is a complex biological and 
psychological phenomenon.  Subjective effects will be measured using a visual analog scale that ranges 
from 0 (not at all) to 100 (extremely) assessing strongest craving in the past 24 hours, t he ability to 
refuse MA, “want” of methamphetamine,  use if access to drug, etc.  This measure will be administered 
during screening  and weekly  during the medication and termination . 
Medication compliance:  As described above, aliquots (5 ml) from each twic e weekly urine sample as 
well as a serum sample (10 ml) during week [ADDRESS_429371] MA Ph II, Protocol     Page 23 of 39              Version 12.0; 9 July 2016  Physical examination/medical and neurological history/labs/EKG:  A medical history, neurological 
history, and physical exam with all participants during the  screening  period. An EKG, blood chemistry 
panel (including liver profile  and GGT ), HIV and hepatitis C virus serology, [COMPANY_003]  (if not pr eviously 
completed) , CBC, and urinalysis will be completed during screening  and at termination . Hematology and 
chemistry labs (including liver panel and GGT) and an EKG will be repeated during week 3 and week 8 
of study medication  as well as at termination  (week 13)  for safety monitoring purposes. Female 
participants will have a urine pregnancy test monthly.  
Self-Report of Medication Adherence /Pi[INVESTIGATOR_38950] :  Using a the participant’s medication blister package 
as a visual aide , research staff will sit with each participant at each study visit and review study 
medication -taking in the period since the participant’s last visit. All study medications drugs taken will be 
plotted on the pi[INVESTIGATOR_345763].  Non -adherent 
subjects will review medication dosing procedures with a study clinician and barriers to compliance will 
be discussed.  
Inflammatory  and neurotrophic markers : Serum and plasma  will be collected from whole blood during 
baseline and during week s 3, 8 and 13  for assessment of these markers.  
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -IV (SCID)  (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_626], Williams et al. 1995 ): Participants must 
meet DSM -IV criteria for methamphetamine dependence, as determined by [CONTACT_345808]. 
A full SCID, as well as the Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) subsection of the SCID -II will be 
completed by a study clinician  (follow ing training on the instrument) These results will be used to 
estimate the extent of co -morbid psychiatric diagnoses, and to verify that the participant does not have 
an active psychiatric disorder that precludes safe study participation.  
Timeline Follow -Back method (TLFB) (Sobell, Sobell et al. 1986 ) will be used to determine days of 
use and quantities of use of cigarettes, alcohol, and other drugs over a [ADDRESS_429372] 7 days will be used weekly during th e second week of screening 
and during the medication and follow up phases.  
Urinary Cotinine : Cigarette smoking status will be monitored biologically weekly via measurement of 
urinary cotinine.  
Urine Drug Screening  for benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], marijuana, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], cocaine, and MA will be monitored 
using an onsite qualitative urine test device. Subjects will be warned that tampering with samples and 
taking OTCs that cross -react with the MA panel will be interpreted as positiv e for illicit substance use with 
consequences of being dropped from study participation. Urine drug screening will be completed at each  
study visit.  If a participant is unable to attend a clinic visit  (e.g. out of town, holiday, etc.), subjects may 
provide  drug screening samples using oral test kits.  
Urinary Riboflavin  concentration will be measured on each urine specimen via fluorimetry  using a 
Quantifluor Fluorometer (Promega Corp). Urinary riboflavin ≥ 900 ng/ml will be considered positive  for 
active pi [INVESTIGATOR_82959] .  
Vital Signs : Blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], and temperature will be collected at each study 
visit. 
Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURS)  (Wender, 1995), administered during screening, r etrospectively 
assesses ADHD -relevant childhood behaviors and symptoms in adults consisting of 25 items. Estimates 
of ADHD in the population of MA abusers are between 15% -35%.   
 
Assessment of Neurocognitive Endophenotypes Implicated in MA Dependence  
Neurocognitive testing will be performed on the initi al 85 participants enrolled. Beginning in July 2016 
(N = 85) only the MOCA will be administered at baseline and again at weeks 4 and 13. While we will 
include selected clinical NP tests to allow characterization of traditionally studied NP domains and to 
facilitate cross -study comparisons, our assessment strategy is focused on elucidation of underlying 
neurocognitive endophenotypes that are associated with chronic MA use and/or may serve as barriers to 
optimal engagement in treatment.  We will employ tasks that are sensitive to disordered inhibitory 
control, risky decision making, attentional control, and procedural learning and probabilistic 
categorization. When feasible, clinical NP tests that are part of the MATRICS battery will be employed. 
The MATRICS b attery (an acronym for Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in 
Schizophrenia) is the product of an NIMH initiative to stimulate the development of pharmacological 
agents to treat NP deficits in schizophrenia. It is specifically designed to be used in clinical trials in which 
[ADDRESS_429373] MA Ph II, Protocol     Page 24 of 39              Version 12.0; [ADDRESS_429374] reliability, 
relationship to functional outcome, and tolerability (MATRICS Manual, 2006). While there are of course 
significant  differences between the cognitive deficits seen in schizophrenia vs. MA dependence, there is 
also considerable overlap, making this test battery particularly well -suited for this study.  We will also 
include NP tests that measure cognitive functions thoug ht to be relatively unaffected by [CONTACT_345809] (i.e., 
language, visuospatial processing) to evaluate the specificity of our measures.  
Our brief serial assessments will include tests that target bottom -up and top -down cognitive 
processing approaches.  Prior work  has demonstrated that successful abstainers may attempt to control 
their intrusive drug -related cognitions either by [CONTACT_345810] -related stimuli 
(Baker, Lee et al. 2005 , Kavanagh, Andrade et al. 2005 , Schoenmakers, de Bruin et al.  2010 ) or 
suppressing their subjective craving (Brody, Mandelkern et al. 2007 ), an effect which may be facilitated 
by [CONTACT_345811] -down cognitive processing. Similarly, drug -dependent individuals may demonstrate 
deficits in top -down cognitive processing, concomitant with increased bo ttom-up activity in such regions 
as the nucleus accumbens and amygdale (Due, Huettel et al. 2002 , David, Munafo et al. 2005 , 
McClernon, Hiott et al. 2007 ) which trigger the affective and ap petitive signals of immediate drug 
outcomes (Bechara 2005 ). This may suggest that in successful abstainers, there will be increased top -
down processing in areas responsible for cognitive control, error/ risk detection (Whalen, Bush et al. 
1998 , Bush, Luu et al. 2000 , Bechara 2005 , Lee, Pohlman et al. 2010 ). Additional details for each of 
these tests follow . 
 Inhibitory Control    
Stop Signal Test (SST) . This task measures how long it takes for an individual to cancel an initiated 
motor response. On each of [ADDRESS_429375] press a corresponding key 
as quickly as possible.  Subjects are, however, also instructed to try to s top themselves from completing 
a response if they hear a “stop -signal” tone (25% of trials)  
MATRICS Continuous Performance T est (MATRICS CPT-II). We will employ the Identical Pairs 
version CPT which is part of the MATRICS assessment battery (MATRICS, 2006 ). This is a 
computerized test of sustained attention and response inhibition which was developed at UCLA and has 
indices of response inhibition (commission errors), vigilance (omissions), and reaction time.  The 
MATRICS CPT -II will be administered at base line, week 4 and termination.  
Conn ors’ Continuous Performance Test (Connors’ CPT -II). The Connors’ CPT -II is a reliable and 
valid computer administered test of sustained attention that takes approximately 15 minutes to 
administer.  The Connors’ CPT -II will be administered at weeks 2, 6 and 10.   
 Risk Taking/Decision Making  
Iowa Gambling Task (Bechara et al,1994) . This task was developed to more closely simulate real -
world decision making and risk taking than do most of the more typi[INVESTIGATOR_345764] “executive 
functions’ tasks.  To examine whether compensation enhances the ecological validity of this test,  half of 
the participants will  be randomized to  receive $10 per completed task  during baseline and weeks 4 and 
13 based on their SID assigned at consent .  
 Implicit learning/Procedural learning  
Pursuit Rotor Task . The Pursuit Rotor Task is well -known measure of procedural learning.  Based 
upon prior research performed by [CONTACT_345812] (van Gorp et al., 1999), 
the rate of rotation for the turntable will be set at 50 revolutions per mi nute.  
 Traditional Clinical NP Tests   
(1) Learning & Memory – (a) Hopkins Verbal Learning Test -Revised  (HVLT -R); (b) Brief Visuospatial 
Memory Test -Revised  (BVMT -R) 
(2) Speed of Processing – (a) Trail Making Test  (TMT) ; (b) Weischler Adult Intelligence Scale  - Fourth  
Edition (WAIS -IV) Digit Symbol coding; (c) WAIS -IV Symbol Search    
(3) Working Memory  - (a) WAIS -IV Letter Number Sequencing ; and (b) N -Back Task  
The Delis -Kaplan Executive Function System (DKEFS) Color Word Interference  test measures ability 
to inhibit a dominant and automatic verbal response.  
The Wechsler Test of Adult Reading ( WTAR, Wechsler, 2001)  is a test that estimates premorbid level 
of intellectual function.  
[ADDRESS_429376] MA Ph II, Protocol     Page 25 of 39              Version 12.0; 9 July 2016  The Montreal Cognitive Assessment  (MOCA, Nasreddine et  al., 2005)  is a brief (10 minute) 
screening instrument that samples behavior across [ADDRESS_429377] 4 ( WRAT4, Wilkinson & Robertson, 2006) is a norm referenced 
test with grade -based norms for reading.  
Delay Discounting Task  (DDT) : Subjects are given a number of choices between smaller, immediate 
rewards, and larger, delayed rewards. The results provide an estimate of how steeply individuals 
discount the future value of money compared to their estimation of the present value. An increased rate 
of DD (signifying a steeper discounting of the future value of money) has been observed in alcoholics, 
heroin addicts, cocaine addicts, smokers, and pat hological gamblers.  
During weeks 4 and 13, participants will repeat the following tasks: Montreal Cognitive Assessment; 
MATRICS CPT-II; HVLT -R; BVMT -R; SST ; TMT; DDT; WAIS -IV Letter Number Sequencing ; WAIS -IV 
Symbol Searc h, WAIS -IV Digit Symbol Coding; N -Back Task; DKEFS Color Word Interference and the 
Iowa Gambling Task.  
 
Data Analysis:  The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of IBUD as a treatment for 
MA dependence and to provide FDA with suffic ient data to advise whether IBUD should move forward for 
marketing as a MA dependence treatment. The primary outcome variable is the FDA -specified criterion 
of significant MA abstinence at the end of treatment  defined as no self -reported MA use during the final 
two weeks of treatment (weeks 11/12) confirmed via urine drug screens (at least one of the two possible 
urine specimens each week is available during weeks 11 and 12 and all available urine specimens are 
MA-negative). The study is powered to detect a significant difference in the proportion of participants 
achieving this outcome in the IBUD versus placebo groups. Additional measures of clinically meaningful 
reductions in MA use during treatment will al so be assessed in the event that IBUD produces effects on 
MA use that do not meet the abstinent at end of treatment threshold. In addition to MA use outcomes, 
treatment retention, an important clinical variable that is associated with long -term treatment o utcomes in 
substance abuse treatment (Hser, Evans et al. 2004 ), with IBUD versus placebo will be compared. 
Effects of potential confounders on each of these outcomes will also be examined including: (1) 
medication non -adherence, (2) medication safety and tolerability (adverse event rates), and (3) ability to 
achieve initial MA abstinence with the CM intervention during the two week lead -in period.  
A general univariate strategy will be used to test fo r differences between conditions at baseline and 
along all outcome variables using bivariate analyses (i.e., t -tests/ANOVA for continuous variables; χ2 for 
dichotomous variables). A multivariate analysis will also be used when appropriate to control for co -
variates known to influence MA dependence treatment outcomes including age, gender, baseline 
severity of MA dependence, HIV status, and ability to achieve initial abstinence during the CM lead -in.  
 
Aim 1:  To determine whether IBUD reduces MA use more tha n placebo among MA dependent 
participants.  
Hypothesis 1:  IBUD will result in significantly greater reductions in MA use than placebo  
Analysis:  The outcome of reductions in MA use will be assessed using results from twice  weekly 
urine drug screens for MA-metabolites and self -reported MA use (weekly time line follow -back). This 
analysis is an intent -to-treat analysis that involves the period from Day 0 to the end of the 12 week active 
medication period. Univariate composites of urine drug screen results include:  
 FDA-Specified Criterion of significant abstinence  – two weeks continuous MA abstinence at end 
of treatment ( primary study outcome ): The proportion of participants in the IBUD and placebo 
groups with two weeks continuous MA abstinence during weeks 11 and 12, defined as self -
reported MA abstinence confirmed by [CONTACT_297826] (at least one of the two possible urine 
specimens possible each week is available and all available are MA -negative) during weeks 11 
and 12.  
 Treatment Effectiveness Score : mean number of MA -free urine specimens provided during the 12 
week outpatient treatment period in the IBUD versus placebo groups . 
 Joint Probability Index : Measures whether an average participant is retained and abstinent at a 
given point in the trial. The p robability that a participant is retained at a given point is multiplied by 
[ADDRESS_429378] MA Ph II, Protocol     Page 26 of 39              Version 12.0; 9 July 2016  the probability a participant i s abstinent at the same point. The measure will be calculated at the 
midpoint (end week 6) and termination (end week 12) for IBUD and placebo groups.   
A logistic regression model will be used to compare the odds of the dichotomous outcome variable 
two weeks continuous MA abstinence at end of treatment for IBUD versus placebo groups, controlling for 
important co -variates including age, gender, severity of baseline MA dependence (number of MA use 
days in the past 30 days at baseline), and HIV status. Longitudinal modeling techniques including GEE 
will be then used to model MA use as measured via urine drug screen results and self -report of drug use, 
takin g advantage of the twice -weekly urine specimens collected during the trial. Additional covariates 
such as gender, age, baseline MA use may be included as appropriate.  
Examination of potential confounders  Rates of adverse events and medication adherence in the 
IBUD and placebo groups will be calculated and compared. Medication adherence will be assessed as a 
continuous variable: the proportion of twice -weekly urine drug samples positive for riboflavin (≥90 0 ng/ml 
riboflavin as determined via quantitative fluorimetry ), and as a dichotomous variable: medication 
adherent (≥80% of t wice-weekly urine drug screens positive for riboflavin). Adherence will also be 
assessed via qualitative measurement of IBUD and me tabolites in urine and serum samples, which is the 
gold standard for assessing adherence in the IBUD group but is limited by [CONTACT_345813]. Models for MA use outcomes will be repeated including 
the continuous measure of adherence as a co -variate. The models will also be run with the sample 
stratified as medication adherent versus non -adherent. As pre -treatment abstinence is an important 
predictor of treatment outcomes and medication response in st imulant dependence trials (Elkashef, 
Rawson et al. 2008 , Bisaga, Aharonovich et al. 2010 ), the sample will be stratified by [CONTACT_345814] -week lead -in period to explore whether medication effects may 
differ in these subgroups.  
 
Aim 2:  To determine whether IBUD results in longer treatment retention than placebo among MA 
dependent participants.  
Hypothesis 2:  IBUD will result in significantly greater treatment retention than placebo  
Analysis:  The mean number of days retained, defined as the number of days from the start of study 
medication to the final clinic visit during the [ADDRESS_429379]. Cox proportional hazards model will be u sed to compare days retained for IBUD 
versus placebo controlling for co -variates including age, gender, and baseline MA use. These analyses 
will then be repeated with the sample stratified by [CONTACT_345815]-week lead -in period to explore whether medication effects may differ in these subgroups.  
 
The following exploratory HIV -related aims will be address in the HIV positive participants.  
 
Aim 3 : To determine whether IBUD improves biological (CD4 count; HIV RNA) and neurocognitive 
outcomes more than placebo among HIV-positive MA dependent participants.  
Hypothesis 3:  IBUD will result in greater improvements in CD4 count, HIV viral load, and 
neurocognitive functioning than p lacebo among HIV positive participants.  
Analysis:  Change scores for CD4 count, HIV viral load, and scores on neurocognitive assessments 
will be calculated between baseline and end of medication treatment. The mean change score for each 
measure will be cal culated for IBUD versus placebo. A linear regression model will be used to assess the 
mean change in measures for IBUD versus placebo after controlling for possible confounders such as 
gender, MA abstinence during the two -week lead -in period, and medicatio n adherence.  
 
Aim 4 : To determine whether IBUD improves behavioral outcomes (sexual transmission behaviors; 
uptake and/or adherence to HIV medications) relative to placebo among HIV-positive MA 
dependent participants.  
Hypothesis 4 : IBUD will result in gre ater reductions in HIV risk behaviors and increased HIV 
medication uptake/adherence than placebo among HIV positive participants.  
Analysis:  The proportion of participants reporting HIV sexual risk behaviors in the IBUD and placebo 
groups will be calculate d. The proportion of participants reporting receipt of HIV medications as well as 
the proportion of medication they report taking will be calculated. The mean number of self -reported HIV 
[ADDRESS_429380] MA Ph II, Protocol     Page 27 of 39              Version 12.0; 9 July 2016  sexual risk behaviors for IBUD versus placebo will be compared via t tests and then in a linear regression 
model controlling for potential confounders. The mean HIV medication adherence rate (proportion of 
medication taken) for IBUD and placebo will also be compared via t test and then linear regression 
model.  
 
Exploratory  analyses  Baseline neurocognitive functioning of participants will be described using 
results of the neuropsychiatric (NP) battery performed at baseline. Baseline to post -treatment changes in 
scores on tests in the NP battery will be calculated for IBU D and placebo groups. Effect sizes for IBUD 
on NP battery change scores will be calculated and used to determine whether future fully powered 
studies examining NP changes with IBUD are warranted. In addition, GEE models will be used to 
compare change in the br ief serial weekly cognitive assessments (Balloon Analog Reaction Time task 
and Stop Signal test) during treatment with IBUD versus placebo. To explore whether severity/type of 
neurocognitive dysfunction at treatment entry mediates response to IBUD, baselin e scores on NP 
assessments will be included as co -variates in the models assessing IBUD effects on MA use outcomes 
and treatment retention. Finally, potential effects of polymorphisms in dopaminergic genes and GDNF 
(Yoshimura, Usui et al. 2011 ), as well levels of  inflammatory  biomarker s and neurotrophic factors on  
treatment outcomes will be explored. The sam ple will be stratified by [CONTACT_345816] -groups. In 
addition, baseline versus post -treatment serum  and plasma  levels of inflammatory markers neurotrophic 
facto rs will be compared for IBUD versus placebo groups and by [CONTACT_345789]. Correlation between 
early life stress measures and baseline severity of MA abuse as well as treatment outcomes, including 
potential early life stress -ibudilast interactions, will als o be explored.  
We recognize that the study is not powered to detect statistical significance in these analyses, 
especially if corrections for multiple testing are employed (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995 ) and as a result 
these analyses are by [CONTACT_345817]. Still we feel that including th ese probe s of 
potential IBUD mechanisms of action within the context of this early clinical trial is important in that the 
results may bolster any observed effects of IBUD on MA use outcomes and direct the design of 
subsequent adequately powered confirmato ry phase III trials.  
Power calculations : Power is calculated (Figure 5 ) for the primary study outcome: the proportion of 
participants achieving MA abstinence during the final two weeks of treatment (weeks 11 and 12) in the 
IBUD versus placebo group. This is the FDA -preferred outcome for stimulant pharmacotherapy trials and 
was used in a previous study that found an effect size of 0.5 for bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_345765] (Elkashef, Rawson et al. 2008 ). For a Fischer’s exact test comparing the proportion 
achieving abstinence during final two weeks on IBUD versus placebo, with an effect size similar  to that in 
the previous bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_345766] (0.5), a one -tailed test assuming IBUD will be superior to placebo, and an 
alpha = 0.05, 55 participants are required in each group (total N = 110) to achieve 80% power. Our total 
sample size of 1 40 exceeds 80% powe r. Note that the use of the outcome variable abstinent during the 
final two weeks of treatment accounts for attrition as participants who fail to complete the trial fail to 
achieve urine drug screen confirmed abstinence during the final two weeks (i.e. mis sing considered non -
abstinent). This is a conservative approach but appropriate as an effective medication would be expected 
to sustain patients in treatment for the allotted time in addition to facilitating abstinence as longer 
treatment retention and tre atment completion are strong predictors of superior long -term outcomes and 
sustained abstinence (Ahmadi, Kampman et al. 2006 , Hillhouse, Marinelli -Casey et al. 2007 ).

Managing Behavioral Disruption in Methamphetamine Dependent Participants  
OVERVIEW  
PURPOSE: The purpose of this Standard Operating Procedure is to guide behavior of staff members in responding 
to behavioral disruptions on the part of participants who are methamphetamine dependent and who are either 
inpatient or outpatient study participants.  
BACKGROUND: For the most part, methamphetamine dependent participants in outpatient studies are managed 
behaviorally in the same wa y as other participants in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313914]. Predictability and calmness on the part of 
staff members will aid in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_345777] a minimum, independent of whether the participant is methamphetamine 
dependent. Indeed, there is little to become concerned a bout in managing behavioral disruption from patients in 
studies of medications for methamphetamine dependence. Much of the skills necessary for managing participants 
who occasionally become disruptive during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_345778] d measure among the 
staff. For example, if a methamphetamine dependent participant becomes argumentative with a staff member, that 
individual can ask the participant to calm down and that he may want to return to a room until he is less upset.  
MANAGING MI NOR BEHAVIOR DISRUPTIONS  
Participants in this study will remain in the trial for a total of 18 weeks . In that time, some minor behavioral 
disruptions may occur. These behavioral disturbances will be managed successfully primarily by [CONTACT_117354] a 
general calm demeanor and using reasoning with the participants. Becoming upset in response to the patient’s 
actions will generally exaggerate the crisis.  
Signs:  Participant’s verbal and physical behaviors are the first clues of mild behavioral disruption.  
 Participant becomes argumentative or complains about details of the clinic , the study or his life.  
 Tone of  voice is urgent, but generally not rude.  
 Participant negotiates effectively with staff members who seek to resolve the disruptions.  
 There is little indication participant will become physically assaultive.  
 Participant is not being flagrant in other aspec ts of his behavior.  
Using a calm demeanor, there are several responses you can use to successfully resolve a minor behavioral 
disruption caused by a methamphetamine dependent patient:  
 Tell the participant you are willing to hear his complaint, but that you  can do that only if he calms down.  
o When the participant calms down, listen to what s/he is saying and if possible, work with the 
participant to resolve the problem being expressed.  
 Calmly ask the participant to remove him/herself from general community f or a period (e.g., “time out” in a 
room) until his mood is calm and he can return to the community to discuss the problem.  
 Ask if there is something that could be helpful to the participant in managing his upset mood (for example, 
food, snacks, movie, inte rnet, cell phone).  
 Check if the participant is experiencing tobacco withdrawal and whether he would like to be accompanied 
for a smoking break.  
MANAGING MODERATE BEHAVIOR DISRUPTIONS  
Signs: It is likely that one or two moderate behavior disruptions will occur as we complete 140 participants in this 
protocol.  These disruptions are likely to involve display of strong and immediate concerns/desires to leave the 
clinic  and to quit the study. You  will be able to tell this is different than a minor disruption as you will find it difficult to 
“talk the participant  down” or to get him to change his mind. It is unlikely that such moderate behavioral disruption 
will involve any threats of violence to s taff or to self. It is far likelier that the participant will demand to be let out of 
[ADDRESS_429407] MA Ph II, Protocol     Page 37 of 39              Version 12.0; 9 July 2016  the unit (withdraw study consent). Still, if the participant threatens to leave the unit, it is critical that you reach [CONTACT_345827] , [CONTACT_287400] or [CONTACT_345828]  immedi ately.  
MANAGING SEVERE BEHAVIOR DISRUPTIONS  
Signs:  Severe behavioral disruption is rare and obvious. Signs of severe behavioral disruption include extreme 
agitation (beyond being upset), threats, self -injurious behavior etc.  
For managing severe behavior d isruptions, the main issue is to maintain safety for the participant and the clinic .  
If there are concerns of threats to self/others, the Distress Protocol is activated (see below).  
If the situation is not sufficiently severe to summon security/police (e.g., participant destroys property, but is not a 
threat to self/others), manage as a moderate behavioral disruption above and get in touch with one of the study 
investigators to manage staff and participant ASAP.  
DISTRESS PROTOCOL  
 
Signs : Subjects give c lear signs when they are a danger to themselves or to someone else. These include but are not 
limited to:  
 They tell you they have thoughts about killing you, killing themselves, or killing someone else.  
 When a subject endorses item 3 of the HAMD with 2 or  greater.  
 When a subject has a total HAMD score greater than 17.  
 Sometimes a family member or friend will tell you the subject is talking about impulsive actions against self/others.  
 
When any sign  like this occurs, the following distress protocol is impl emented:  
1) Inform the subject you are seeking assistance, especially if the subject uses language that references wishes to 
die, thoughts of being better off dead, no more reason to live, threats to kill you or any person who is identifiable 
(i.e., a named individual – not just a vague reference such as “any A -hole who gets in my way today”), etc.  
2) Immediately  notify the study clinician  and request a licensed mental health provider be called. Once a staff 
member decides there is reason to initiate contact [CONTACT_29881] a responsible clinician, contact [CONTACT_345821] . It is critical that staff continue contact[CONTACT_345822] a licensed clinician is on -site to speak with the distressed subject. Distressed subjects must be 
evaluated by a licensed clinician with one hour  of discovery.  
a. Highest Levels of Distress : In cases in which a licensed clinician determines that immediate intervention 
is required to manage a subject’s extreme distress (e.g., th at the individual is making an unambiguous 
threat to the safety of himself or to an identifiable intended victim), immediate steps will be taken to arrange 
for an involuntary hold at the Psychiatric ER to guarantee the subject’s physical safety and/or the physical 
safety of an identifiable intended victim. In the event that an identifiable intended victim is named and 
clinical staff  determine  the threat to be credible, the information regarding the threat and the intended 
victim’s identity will be provided to the police. In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_345779] a counselor 
to warn an intended victim of a potential threat to their phys ical safety, clinical staff also will make contact 
[CONTACT_345823] a credible threat to his life has been made 
by [CONTACT_345824].  
b. Moderate Level of Distress : For subjects who are assessed as clinically distressed, but not in need of 
emergency intervention or containment, the clinician will speak briefly with the subject and inform him that 
we require the subjec t to freely engage a "no suicide/no homicide" contract. This type of contracting 
procedure is standard to psychological practices in managing distressed subjects and is identical to the 
procedures in use in our clinical research projects for the past 12 ye ars. Distressed subjects who receive 
this distress evaluation experience the procedure not as “coercive,” but instead find it reassuring that the 
level of distress they report is recognized and addressed.  The counseling and contracting process also 
signal s to the subject the seriousness the team places in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_345780]. Observing the distressed subject’s reaction after completing a clinical 
assessment and after informing him we wish to enter a com mitment to avoid injurious behaviors using a 
clinical contract not to hurt self or others provides additional information as to the actual level of distress for 
the subject (e.g., should the subject escalate, we have information that we need to re -think th e level of 
[ADDRESS_429408] MA Ph II, Protocol     Page 38 of 39              Version 12.0; [ADDRESS_429409] and to consider activating procedures to ensure physical safety). While it is possible 
(but highly unlikely) that a subject would misrepresent his distress by [CONTACT_345825]/no homicide contract and then kill himself or kill someone else, it 
remains that suicide/homicide are low base rate behaviors and the clinical evaluation and contracting 
process remain the gold standard for addressing highly distressed subjects in cl inical practice.  
3) A trained staff member will remain with the participant at all times  during assessment/ treatment until a 
Study Clinician deems the subject not at risk or the subject is handed off to another licensed clinician.  
4) It is possible that a subj ect may provide misleading information to the clinic staff members about his distress level 
and/or his intent to hurt himself or another. The procedures detailed here provide the best and most consistent 
methods used in clinical practice to respond to subj ects in distress and their intentions to hurt themselves or others.

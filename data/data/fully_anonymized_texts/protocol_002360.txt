Principal Investigator G. Kevin Gillian, MD 
Study Center Virginia Heartburn and Hernia Institute [ADDRESS_933005] undergone a hiatal hernia repair between 1 Jul 2015 and 1 June 2016 
•A minimum  of three attempts to reach each subject in the cohort shall
be made 
Study Objectives Primary Objective 
Characterize the procedural and early post-operative safety profile of 
MIROMESH when used as reinforcement in hiatal hernia repair.   
Secondary Objectives 
Identify a consecutive cohort who may be tracked long term to identify survival 
of repair. Identify a consecutive cohort who may be  tracked long term to characterize 
mid- and long-term clinical outcomes. 
Identify a consecutive cohort who may be tracked long term to further 
characterize the safety profile over time. 
Study Design This will be a retrospective chart review to identify the appropriate cohort with 
a prospective follow-up survey to acquire  safety and outcome information.

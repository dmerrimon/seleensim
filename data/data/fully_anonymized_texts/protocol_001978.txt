Table  1: Pharmacokinetic Sampling Schedule  
 
 
 Rationale  Genvoya, a  once -daily single fixed -dose combination tablet for treatment of HIV-infection , consists 
of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) , emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir 
(TFV) alafenamide fumarate (TAF), the integrase  strand transfer  inhibitor (InSTI) elvitegravir 
(EVG), and the boosting agent cobicistat (COBI). It is unknown whether Genvoya, taken as a 
crushed/dissolve d tablet, is bioequivalent to when taken as a whole tablet. This is crucial 
information since a substantial number of HIV -infected individuals suffer from pi[INVESTIGATOR_205777] -adherence and treatment failure.  
Design  Within -subject, fixed -order, two -period, open label study to determine the  bioequivalence of oral 
single dose of whole and crushed/dissolved  tablets of Genvoya in healthy adult male and female 
research participants administered under direct observation.    
Population  Up to 20  adult male and female healthy research participants will be enrolled to complete 12 . 
Intervention  Whole Tablet Period : Single observed oral dose of  Genvoya whole  tablet  
Crushed/dissolved  Tablet Period : Single observed oral dose of Genvoya  crushed/dissolve d tablet  
Outcome 
Measures  Primary :  To investigate the bioequivalence of oral single whole tablet and crushed/dissolved  tablet 
of Genvoya  by [CONTACT_205784] 0-∞ and C max of EVG, COBI, FTA, TAF, and T FV in 
plasma, after single doses of whole tablet and crushed/dissolved  tablet in healthy male and female 
adult research participants.  
Secondary : To compare other pharmacokinetic parameters of oral single whole tabl et and 
crushed/dissolved  tablet of Genvoya  by [CONTACT_205785] T max and terminal elimination 
half-life of EVG, COBI, FTA, TAF, and TFV  after single doses of whole tablet and 
crushed/dissolved  tablet in healthy male and female adult research partic ipant . 
Procedures  Screening : Potential research participants provide written informed consent and undergo evaluation 
of inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
Whole Tablet Period  (3 days) : Research partic ipants will swallow, under direct observation, a 
single dose of a whole  Genvoya tablet, followed by [CONTACT_205786]  72 hours as indicated in 
Table  1 below .  
Safety Visit:  Participants will return approximately 7 days after the whole -tablet dosing for clinical 
and laboratory safety assessment  visit. 
Washout : A minimum of 14  will elapse between the two Genvoya dose s. 
Crushed/dissolved  Tablet Period  (3 days) : Research p articipants will swallow, under direct 
observation, a single dose of a crushed/dissolved  Genvoya  tablet , followed by [CONTACT_205787] 72 hours, as indicated in Table  1 below . 
Final Safety Visit : Participants will return approximately 7 days after the crushed/dissolved -tablet 
dosing for a final clinical and laboratory safety assessment  visit.

 1     INTRODUCTION  
 
1.1 Background  
 
Genvoya , a fixed -dose combination of the two non -nucleosides reverse transcrip tase inhibitors (NRTIs) 
emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir (TFV) alafenamide  fumarate  (TAF), with the integrase strand transfer 
inhibitor (InSTI ) elvitegravir (EVG) and the EVG -boosting agent cobicistat (COBI), is FDA approved for 
the treatment of HIV-infec ted patients (1).  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_205778] , allowing for a single tablet fixed -dose combination and once -daily 
dosing, a substantial number of individuals living with HIV suffer from pi[INVESTIGATOR_205779], dysphagia, 
odynophagia, or problems swallowing  their oral regimens - all of which can contribute to non -adherence 
(2). These observations are especially important because non -adherence to antiretroviral ( ARV ) 
medications is highly prevalent and associated with decreased survival (3).  Non-adherence has  been 
estimated at 55% in North American pooled cohorts, and is a vital public health concern, as it leads to 
treatment failure and transmission of drug -resistant virus (4 -6). 
 
Many clinical scenarios make the administration of crushed/dissolved  tablets de sirable as a potential 
strategy to overcome pi[INVESTIGATOR_205779]. However, there is a theoretical concern that the systemic absorption of 
the active ingredients of tablets may be altered by [CONTACT_205788][INVESTIGATOR_3353]. In fact, pharmacokinetic and 
bioequivalence data are lacking for most ARV fixed -dose combinations used in the treatment of HIV -
infected patients. It is therefore of substantial practical and clinical interest to know whether ARV  
combinations such as Genvoya  can be taken in crushed/dissolved  form with bioequi valence to whole tablet 
form.   
 
A recent study reported the bioavailability results from crushing and splitting the single fixed -dose 
formulation tablet containing darunavir  (DRV) , cobicistat  (COBI) , emtricitabine  (FTC) , and TAF ( 7). This 
was an open -label , randomized, cross -over study in 30 HIV healthy research participants , using a single 
dose of this fixed dose formulation as whole tablet, crushed/dissolved  tablet , and halved tablet. Plasma 
concentrations for each method of administration were comparable  for DRV, FTC, and COBI. Although 
TAF was bioequivalent for the whole v ersus  split tablet , the crushed/dissolved  tablet resulted in 20% 
reduced TAF AUC.  Therefore, further studies are needed to confirm these results. Also, it is crucial to 
conduct a bioequ ivalence study with the Genvoya tablet, since this fixed -dose formulation includes EVG, a 
different ARV class than DRV in the previous bioavailability study  (7). 
 
The national treatment guidelines recommend that treatment -naive HIV-infected patients receiv e an initial 
combination regimen with InSTI-based therapy  (8). Thus, I nSTIs are a relevant class of ARV drugs for the 
treatment of HIV infection, and showing whether these medications can be taken in a crushed/dissolved  
tablet form can be a lifesaving inte rvention for individuals who cannot tolerate ingesting a whole tablet 
formulation.  
 
In this short pharmacokinetic study we will investigate whether an oral single -dose of whole tablets of 
Genvoya  is bioequivalent to a crushed/dissolved  form of this medica tion in healthy research participants .

1.2  STUDY DRUGS : CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY AND SAFETY  
 
Genvoya (EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF)  
 
Genvoya is a once -daily single fixed -dose combination tablet for treatment of HIV-infection . One tablet  
consists of two NRTIs , FTC 200 mg and TAF  10 mg , the I nSTI EVG  150 mg , and the EVG -boosting agent 
COBI 150 mg (1). The FDA recommended dosage of Genvoya  in patients  ≥12 years old is one tablet daily 
taken with food  (1). Genvoya should not be used in patients with a creatinine cle arance ( CrCl ) <30 mL/min 
(1). EVG and COBI are  highly bound to plasma proteins  (1).  
  
Safety.  The most common adverse effects with  Genvoya  are diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, and headaches  (1). 
Most of these adverse events are self -limited and resolve spontane ously. COBI is known to inhibit 
creatinine secretion that leads to an increase in serum creatinine , and a corresponding reduction in GFR and 
creatinine clearance although actual GFR is not affected (1). In addition, more patients treated with 
Genvoya  had L DL levels >190 mg/dL compared to  Stribild , 5% and 2%, respectively  (1).  
 
Cardiac electrophysiology studies showed that EVG and TAF did not prolong or affect the PR and QT/QTc 
intervals, respectively , while  COBI prolonged the PR interval in one study  (1). However, the dose of COBI 
in the Genvoya  tablet is lower than doses evaluated in cardiac electrophysiology study. Therefore, it is 
unlikely that treatment with Genvoya will lead to clinically important prolongation of the PR interval (1). 
The effect of the  combination regimen Genvoya  or FTC on the QT interval is unknown.  Genvoya  has been 
giving to healthy research participants  in a number of studies with minimal reported toxicity (1). It is also 
important to underscore that most of the side effects associat ed with Genvoya occur with chronic use of this 
ARV medication and , thus, less likely to occur with the short -term term dosing proposed in this 
bioavailability study.  
 
Genvoya is a category B drug for use during pregnancy (1). No adverse developmental effe cts were 
observed in animal studies when the components of Genvoya  were administered separately during the 
period of organogenesis (1). TAF use in women during pregnancy has not been evaluated, while EVG, 
COBI, and FTC use during pregnancy ha s been evaluat ed in a limited number of women  (1). Current data 
showed no birth defects reported for COBI or EVG and no difference in the overall risk of major birth 
defects for FTC compared with a U.S. reference population (1).  It is unknown if COBI, EVG, and TAF are 
present in human breast milk; FTC has been shown to be present in human breast milk (1).  
 
Clinical Pharmacology . The PK parameters of individual components of Genvoya are listed in Table 2. 
All PK parameter data are taken from the GenvoyaTM package insert for EVF, COBI, FTC, and TAF. Data 
for TFV, which results from the conversion of TAF, is taken from the VemlidyTM package insert with 
adjustment of PK parameters for 10 mg dose of TAF in Genvoya vs. 25 mg in Vemlidy, assuming dose 
proportionality (C max, AUC 0-∞, and C trough) and the Genvoya package insert (TFV half -life only which 
differs significantly from TFV half -life when administered as TDF).

COBI and EVG are  metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 enzyme ; therefore , concomitant use of these two drugs with 
CYP3A4 inhibitors could substantially increase their plasma concentration  (1). COBI  is also metabolized 
by [CONTACT_097]2D6. C YP3A4 inducers on the other hand, lower COBI and EVG plasma concentration s which may 
lead to loss of therapeutic effect of Genvoya and development of treatment failure and viral resistance (1). 
COBI is also an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and CYP 2D6 in addition to drug transporters such as breast cancer 
resistance protein (BCRP), p-glycoprotein (P -gp), and organic anion transporting peptide (OATP) 1B1 and 
1B3 (1). Therefore, co -administration of  Genvoya with CYP3A4 , CYP2D6 , P-gp, BCR P, OATP1B1 or 
OATP1B3 substrates  can significantly increase their plasma concentrations.  
 
EVG , a CYP2C9 inducer , can lower plasma concentrations of substrates  metabolized through this pathway  
(1). TAF is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A in vitro  but not  an inhib itor or inducer of CYP3A in vivo ;  TAF is 
also a substrate of P -gp, BCRP, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3  (1). Therefore, inhibitors of these drug 
transporters may increase the absorption of TAF. Conversely , drugs that induce the activity of these drug 
transporters could lead to a reduc tion TAF absorption  and decrease TAF plasma concentrations  (1). FTC is 
renally eliminated and does not undergo biotransform ation through the cytochrome P450 pathway  (1). 
Coadministration of Genvoya  with drugs that can affect renal functi on can lead to a reduction of renal 
elimination of FTC and consequently an increase in FTC concentrations and potential adverse events . Other 
mechanism of drug interactions with the components of Genvoya besides drug transporters and hepatic 
drug metaboliz ing enzymes, include diminished absorption when EVG is coadministered with drugs 
containing polyvalent cations (e.g., Mg, Al, Fe, or Ca ; 1).  
 
[ADDRESS_245435] difficulty swallowing whole tablets  of ARV 
combinations . Therefore, crushed/dissolved  tablet  oral formulations  are highly desirable as a potential 
strategy to overcome pi[INVESTIGATOR_205779]. However, th ere is a theoretical concern that the systemic absorption of 
the active ingredients of the whole tablet  formulation  may be altered by [CONTACT_205789] . We propose a 
study in healthy adult women and men research participants  to determine w hether  Genvoya  in 
crushed/dissolved  form is bioequivalen t with the whole tablet form.   
 
The FDA recommended dosage of Genvoya is one tablet daily for the treatment of HIV infection  (1). Since 
participants in this bioequivalence study will be dosed with Genvoya for only one dose on two occasions , 
we will only enroll healthy HIV -uninfected individuals in order to prevent the development of potential 
 
[ADDRESS_245436] line therapy for the treatment of HIV infection  (8). 
Therefore, Genvoya is frequently prescribed for treatment -naïve patient s initiating ART.

Pharmacokinetic Sampling . Plasma sampling for estimating pharmacokinetic parameters were 
selected to optimize information content of each sample for each drug  (and TFV metabolite of TAF) 
for robust estimates of T max, Cmax, AUC 0-∞, and terminal el imination half -life. These are based on 
prior observations of T max and half -life.

The proposed pharmacokinetic sampling visits will be conducted at the Drug Development Unit 
(DDU) in the Division of Clinical Pharmacology at th e Johns Hopkins Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The DDU staff has 
extensive experience conducting pharmacokinetic studies in healthy research participants . The DDU 
will provide study coordinators and other administrative research support, and recruit participants 
for this study .   
 
Plasma samples will be processed and analyzed  at the C linical Pharmacology Analytical Laboratory 
(CPAL) within the Division of Clinical Pharmacology . Genvoya tablets will be donated by [CONTACT_205791]. Approximately 
8ml of blood  will be collected in each dosing period,  on the time points outlined in Table  3. The 
plasma concentrations of EVG, COBI, FTC TFV, and TAF  will be quantified  using validated  liquid 
chromatographic -tandem mass spectrometric (LC -MS/MS)  method s (UPLC -MS/MS). Assay 
validation report s are peer -reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_108373] -sponsored Clinical Pharmacology 
Quality Assurance program.   
 
Safety Assessments . Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_205792] s, vital signs, and 
laboratory and clinical adverse events . Safety laboratory tests will be performed at the two safety 
visits post dose with whole and crushed/dissolved  Genvoya tablets. Laboratory tests will include 
hematology and chemistry . A negative  HIV-1/2 Antigen/Antibody (Ag/Ab) screening test  and

11 CRITERIA FOR DISCONTINU ING FURTHER GENVOYA DOS ING  
 
• Requirement of concomitant medication that is judged by [CONTACT_205797].  
• Request by [CONTACT_44681].  
• Clinical reasons believed life threatening by [CONTACT_093], even if not addressed in the toxic ity 
management of the protocol.  
• Subject judged by [CONTACT_205798].  
• Drug toxicity as d efined in Section 10.  
• At the discretion of the investigator, regulatory agencies, or pharmaceutical sponsor.  
• Failure by [CONTACT_205799].   
• Failure to complete a pharmacokinetic sampling visit within the allowable timefr ame.  
 
12 CRITERIA FOR PREMATURE STUDY DISCONTINUATION  
 
• Request by [CONTACT_205800] . 
• Drug toxicity as defined in Section 10. 
• Request of the primary care provider if s/he is no longer in the best interest of the subject . 
• Subject judged by [CONTACT_205801].  
• Imprisonment or the compulsory detention for treatment of either psych iatric or physical illness . 
• At the discretion of the investigator, regulatory agencies, or pharmaceutical sponsor.  
• Toxicities as outlined in Section [ADDRESS_245449] 
boundaries of 80 to 125% will be 
employed, in accordance with  the FDA 
guidance on bioequivalence studies , 
which define bioequivalence as “the 
absence of a significant difference in 
the rate and extent to which the active 
moiety becomes available at the site of 
action  when administered at the same 
molar dose under similar conditions  
(11).  
In order to test the primary hypothesis, 
log-transformed AUC 0-∞ and Cmax after 
a single dose for crushed/dissolved  Table 4 
 
18 
 versus whole tablets will be compared. The adjusted mean difference s will be estimated and their 
90% confidence intervals calculated. In the case of AUC 0-∞ and Cmax, the estimated differences and 
confidence limits will be exponentiated in order to compare ratios between tablet forms.  
Statistical Methods   
The sample size was calculated according to the formulas for a multiplicative model (12). Table 4 
includes sample size calculations for this proposed study (13). If the mean C max ratio or AUC ratio 
is 1, a sample size of 5 subjects produces a two -sided 90% confidence inte rval (0.952, 1.048) (i.e., a 
distance from the  mean to the limits that is equal to 0.048, when the estimated standard deviation is 
0.050). A sample size of 10 subjects produces a two -sided 90% confidence interval (0.855, 1.145) if 
the mean C max ratio or AU C ratio is 1, and the estimated standard deviation is 0.25. Assuming a 
dropout rate of 10%, a sample size of 12 subjects will be required to provide 90% power to 
demonstrate the bioequivalence of Cmax with 90% confidence intervals (CI) of 80% and 125%.  
 
13.[ADDRESS_245450] -secure 
database with an audit trail (e.g. REDCap).   Data for ineligible subjects will be retained for purposes 
of improving recruitment strategies and to help understand why potential participants are not 
eligible to participate.  
13.[ADDRESS_245451] will be assigned a confidential study number. Data  will be stored in a database on IBM PC 
compatible computers using only the confidential study number, without reference to participant’s 
name. Access to subject study identification codes will b e restricted to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_205783], to the JHU IRB or other regulatory agencies in compliance with 
HIPAA regulations. Data collected from the study containing PHI, will be stored on a secure 
password protected netwo rk accessible only to the study staff.   
 
 
14.[ADDRESS_245452] a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An adverse e vent can therefore be any unfavorable  and unintended sign (including 
an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational)  product. For the 
purposes of this protocol, all adverse events will be collected from the time of informed consent, but only 
those occurring following exposure to a dose of Genvoya will be analyzed.  
 
Other  adverse event  Definitions: The following definit ions of terms guided by [CONTACT_205802]:  
 
• Unexpected Adverse Event: An event in which the specificity or severity is not consistent with 
the current investigator’s brochure, consent form, or other risk information. “Unexpected”, as 
used in this definition, refers to an adverse drug experience that has not been previously 
observed.  
 
• Related Adverse Event: Any event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the  adverse 
experience may have been caused by [CONTACT_205803].   
 
• Serious Adverse Event: Includes death, a life -threatening adverse drug experience, inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a persistent or significant 
 
20 
 disability/incapacity, or any medical event that requires treatment to prevent one of the medical 
outcomes listed above.  
 
• Life-threatening, for the purpose of reporting adverse eve nts, refers to an event in which the 
patient was, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death at the time of the event 
as it occurred (i.e., it does not include a n event that, had it occurred in a more serious form, 
might have caused de ath).  
 
14.4 Reporting of Adverse Events  
 
All events will be reported to the JHU IRB  and to other regulatory agencies as needed . Serious 
adverse other than death and immediately lifer threatening events will be reported within 10 
business days after sponso r initial r eceipt of the information . Death and immediately lifer 
threatening events will be reported within 3 business days Non serious adverse events will be 
reported to the JHU IRB in the annual review report.  
 
14.5 Steps to Minimize the Risks  
 
Subjec ts will be evaluated as indicated in the schedule of events , or more f requently if medically 
indicated. If clinically indicated, d irected physical examination, vital signs  andsafety laboratory tests  
will be performed during outpatient visits. Additional la boratory tests may be undertaken for a 
participant , if medically indicated. Subjects experiencing toxicity will be followed until resolution, 
return to baseline values, stabilization, or an adequate explanation can be give n for their condition.  
 
Genvoya i s a FDA approved medication for the treatment of HIV infection. This fixed combination 
of ARV drugs is known to be well tolerated. This is a short duration study with only two doses of 
Genvoya. Side effects observed  with Genvoya are usually associated with  long term administration 
of this ARV  medication . Participants in this study will be healthy research participants  that will be 
given only two doses of Genvoya . Therefore, the short duration of this study and short medication 
exposure in health research pa rticipants  makes it less l ikely that participants will experience 
clinically important adverse events.  
 
14.6 Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research  
 
There are no benefits for the participants  enrolled in this study.  
 
14.7 Importance of the Knowledge  to be Gained  
 
This study will determine whether crushed/dissolved  Genvoya tablet is bioequivalent to the whole tablet  
formulation. Confirming b ioequivalence between these two tablet forms w ill provide HIV -infected 
subjects with the option of using the crushed/dissolved  Genvoya tablet if they have difficulty 
swallowing the whole table t formulation.  
 
 
 
[ADDRESS_245453] to the participant.  Participants will be compensated up to 
$900 to complete the study  and p arking validation will be provided for the long Day 1 PK study 
visits, if applicable.  There are no financial penalties for not completing the study. All costs for the 
study will be covered for by [CONTACT_1758].

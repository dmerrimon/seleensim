Page 10 of 77 SYNOPSIS  
 
Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder of neuromuscular transmission with an 
estimated annual incidence of about 1 -2 per 100,000 and prevalence as  high as 20 -50 per 
100,000.1 Treatment consists of symptomatic therapy with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and 
immunotherapy such as corticosteroids, azathioprine, cyclosporine, plasma exchange (PLEX)  
and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg).1-[ADDRESS_955220] s. We completed a small 
retrospective study to e valuate B cell targeted therapy in medically refractory generalized MG 7,8. 
In this analysis we show ed that rituximab led to a sustained clinical improvement in parallel to a 
reduction or discontinuation of other immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].   
 
We now plan on conducting  a multicenter randomized, double -blind, placebo controlled Phase II  
clinical trial  utilizing a fu tility design . The study would include acetylcholine receptor ( AChR ) 
antibody positive generalized MG subject s. This study also presents a unique opportunity to study 
both drug and disease mechanisms because unlike many other autoimmune diseases in which 
rituximab has been used, MG affords the investigation of antigen -specific components that 
participate in the immunopathology of the disease , namely  autoantibodies, autoantibody -
producing B cells , and antigen -specific T cells. This work will further our und erstanding of MG 
immunopathology and it represents the first step toward gaining a more complete understanding 
of the immune mechanisms underlying treatment of MG with rituximab leading to new ways to 
treat the disease.  
 
The specific aim of this study is t o determine whether rituximab is a safe and effective treatment 
for subjects with MG.  Although not part of the current protocol, we believe that adding 
exploratory mechanistic studies to the protocol would be important in order to identify 
biomarkers that  can potentially be used in future MG clinical trials as well as exploring whether 
B cell therapy is effective in MG.   With this in mind, the investigators have received funding in 
full support of an  exploratory mechanistic study with extended follow -up through the National 
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). In addition, NINDS has awarded funding in 
support of the extended clinical follow -up visits.

Short  Title: BeatMG:  Rituximab in Myasthenia Gravis  
 
Objectives   
 
The specific primary objective  of this study is to determine whether rituximab is a safe and 
beneficial therapeutic for MG that warrants further study in a phase III efficacy trial.  The primary 
clinical endpoint will be the steroid sparing effect of rituximab . Our retrospective study s howed 
that rituximab treatment had a measurable and significant effect on conventional 
Rituximab in Myasthenia Gravis  
Version 11.0 
Version date 07/05/[ADDRESS_955221] of the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) 
recommended steroid -sparing effect as a clinical outcome measure10. Our first primary outco me 
measure is the percent of subjects  achieving ≥ 75% mean daily prednisone dose reduction in the 
[ADDRESS_955222] s.  We plan to  enroll 25 subjects in a treatment 
group and 25 subjects in a  control placebo group.  
 
Primary Outcomes:  
1. Steroid Sparing Effect:   Percent of subjects tha t achieve a ≥ 75% reduction in mean daily 
prednisone dose in the 4 weeks prior to week 52 and with clinical improvement or no 
significant worsening of symptoms ( ≤ 2 point increase  in MG composite score ) as 
compared to the 4 -week period prior to randomizati on and initiation of treatment.  
2. Safety  
 
Secondary Outcomes:  
1. Evaluate whether there is a trend toward clinical benefit as measured by [CONTACT_4224] -specific clinical 
outcome scales used as endpoints in prior clinical trials.  We will determine if rituximab can 
signif icantly improve the scores  of the following MG -specific clinical outcome measures:   
a.   Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) score  
b. Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score  
 
Interventions and Duration  
 
Intervention (rituximab): The t reatment group will receive a total of two cycles of rituximab 
separated by 6 months. Each cycle is defined as one infusion  (375mg/m2 IV) per week for four 
consecutive weeks. As such, cycle 1 will be administered weeks 0-3 and cycle 2 will be given 
weeks 24 -27. The placebo gr oup will receive a vehicle control infusion.   A predetermined steroid 
taper schedule for both treatment (rituximab) and placebo groups will be utilized. In each subject, 
the prednisone dose will be gradually reduced based on the steroid taper schedule begi nning at 
week 8. The dose will only be reduced after confirming clinical improvement or stable symptoms 
based on the MGC score (≤ 2 point increase ). 
 
Duration: We set a study period of 52 weeks based on the delayed benefits observed following 
rituximab treatment and in the setting of utilizing a two -cycle protocol. The extended time points 
are needed as normalization of B cell counts typi[INVESTIGATOR_20187] 12+ months fo llowing B cell depletion 
treatment.  In order to assess safety in the B cell recovery period  as well as assess the long -term 
durability of response , there are two additional optional observational off study -intervention  time 
points (weeks 72 and 96). The subject s will be treated per medical standard of care during this 
period.

Version 11.0 
Version date 07/05/2017  
Page 12 of 77  
Evaluations: Subject s will have clinical evaluations at baseline and then every 4 weeks thereafter 
(week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52) .  Clinical evaluations w ill be completed by a 
blinded evaluator . The dose of prednisone will be recorded by [CONTACT_703495] . Post -intervention status (PIS) will be assessed by [CONTACT_703496], MGC, QMG, MG -ADL and MG -QOL scores. Adverse effects will be monitored to assess 
safety and tolerability in this subject  population per the NINDS Guidelines for Data and Safety 
Monitoring in Clinical Trials . A limited  clinical assessment per standard of care will be completed 
during the optio nal off study -intervention  follow -up period at weeks 72 and 96.   
 
Blinding  
This is a double -blind clinical trial.  All study subjects and Clinical Study Staff will be blinded to 
treatment assignment.   The Clinical Study Site Investigator is responsible reviewing all adverse 
events and adjusting subjects’ prednisone dose based on the Myasthen ia Gravis Composite 
(MGC) score  without  knowing whether a subject has received drug or placebo.   The clinical 
evaluators who determine the secondary outcome m easures, Myasthenia  Gravis Composite 
(MGC) and Quantitative Myasthe nia Gravis (QMG) , are bl inded to treatment assignment and 
clinical adverse event information.  Site Pharmacists will be the only staff who have access to 
treatment information.    
 
Sample Size and Population  
 
Sample Size: 50  
 
Population: Generalized AChR Antibody Positive (AChR+) Myasthenia Gravis  
 
Randomization will be performed through an interactive website, and will be stratified based on 
the steroid dose at baseline: moderate dose pred nisone (15 -35 mg/day) and high dose 
prednisone (>35 mg/day) as well as their treatment at baseline, prednisone only versus 
prednisone plus another immunosuppressive therapy (IST ). Subjects will be assigned a study ID 
at the time of enrollment.  The study I D includes the identification of the center and a unique 
subject ID.  The DCC will generate a randomization table for each of the strata using a permuted 
block design with random block sizes.

OVERVIEW STUDY SCHEMA  
 
A randomized, double -blind, placebo controlled clinical trial schematic is shown  below . A total of 
50 AChR+ MG subjects will be enrolled (25 in a treatment arm and 25 in a placebo arm). The 
subjects will be evaluated every 4 weeks for 52 weeks after initial treatment  along with two 
additional optional observational off study -intervention  time points at weeks 72 and 96.  
 
Rituximab in Myasthenia Gravis  
Version 11.0 
Version date 07/05/[ADDRESS_955227] s. We completed a small 
retrospective study to e valuate B cell targeted therapy in medically refractory generalized MG 7,8. 
In this analysis we show ed that rituximab led to a sustained clinical improvement in parallel to a 
reduction or discontinuation of corticosteroid therapy and plasma exchange treatments. We 
observed a prednisone dose reduction by a mean of 65%, 86% and 94% after one, two and three  
cycles of rituximab, respectively (Figure 1 ). 
 
The specific primary aim  of this study is to determine whether rituximab is a safe and beneficial 
therapeutic for MG that warrants further study in a phase III efficacy trial.  The primary clinical 
endpoint will be the steroid sparing effect of rituximab  (mean daily prednisone dos e in the last 4 
weeks of the study). Our retrospective 
study showed that rituximab treatment 
had a measurable and significant effect 
on conventional immunosuppression, 
specifically demonstrating an 
unmistakable prednisone dose 
reduction . Importantly, steroid -reduction 
was recently demonstrated to be a 
practical outcome measure in a MG trial 
by [CONTACT_617693] 9. Also in 2012, 
the Task Force on MG Study Design of 
the Medical Scientific Advisory Board of 
the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of 
America (MGFA) recommended 
steroid -sparing effect as a clinica l 
outcome measure 10.  
 
Primary Outcome 1.  Our first primary outcome measure i s the percent  of subjects that achieve a 
≥ 75% reduction in mean daily prednisone dose in the 4 weeks prior to week 52 and with clinical 
improvement or no significant worsening of symptoms (≤ 2 point increase  in MG Composite score )

Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis  score  (QMG) .[ADDRESS_955230] optimizing the design of a subsequent phase III efficacy trial of rituximab in 
MG.   
 
Additional explorat ory clinical outcomes  will be investigated to monitor effectiveness as well as

Phase III rituximab trial.   
 
Clinical Exploratory Outcomes.  
We will determine if rituximab can significantly improve the scores of the following outcome 
measures: (1) MG -Activities of Daily Living (MG -ADL) .14 (2) MG -Quality of Life (MG -QOL).[ADDRESS_955231] will be assessed: (1) Mean daily 
prednisone dose at each scheduled assessment (every 4 weeks). (2) A delayed start of the area 
under the dose -time curve (AUDTC), starting at week 8. (3) Percentage of subject s achieving a ≥ 
50% mean daily prednisone dose reduction with main tenance of minimal or no symptom s in 4 
weeks prior to week 52.  (4) Body Mass Index (Screening Visit and weeks 24 and 52).  (5) HbA1C  
(Screening Visit and week 52).  
 
MG flare rate (failure of therapy) will b e assessed by: (1) Number of rescue treatments (PLEX or 
IVIg) . (2) Number of times prednisone dose needed to be increased. (3) Frequency of a ≥ 3 -point 
increase in the MGC score.  
 
Additionally, there will be two  optional  observational off study -intervention time points (weeks 72 
and 96) The primary focus will be to assess B cell recovery/repopulation as a safety measure.  
Specifically, we will examine: (1) Percentage of subjects achieving normal B cell counts at week 
72 and 96.  (2) Percentage of  achieving baseline B cell counts at week 72 and 96. (3) Percent B 
cell recovery to normal or baseline levels.  In addition, the long -term durability of response will 
also be assessed.  Specifically, we will examine : (1) P ercentage of subject s achieving a sustained 
≥ 75% mean daily prednisone dose reduction . (2) Percentage of subject s achieving a ≥ 50% mean 
daily prednisone dose reduction . (3) Prednisone AUDTC (if applicable). (4) Clinical status as

Biomarker/Mechanistic Exploratory Outcomes . 
The biomarker or mechanistic studies are focused on identifying how treatment modifies the 
immunopathology of MG. We will study changes in the antigen specific  components of the MG 
immune system. We have developed/adapted immunoassays so that we can examine 
autoantibodies, B cells and T cells. The principal mechanistic outcome  will be the decrease in titer 
of circulating AChR autoantibodies within an individual.  Other e xploratory mechanism -based 
outcomes  include determining how rituximab modifies antigen -specific B cell frequency, the B cell 
repertoire, B cell activating factor (BAFF) levels and whether rituximab modifies antigen -specific 
T cell frequency and phe notype. Measurements will be performed prior to and during B cell 
depletion and through repopulation of the B cell compartment, which will be of particular interest 
in terms of assessing the durability of the treatment.   Blood will be collected for mechani stic 
studies at the Baseline Visit,  and at w eeks 24, 52, 72 and 96 . 
 
2 BACKGROUND  
2.1 Rationale  
 
Overview . Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder of neuromuscular transmission 
with an estimated annual incidence of about [ADDRESS_955232] asma  exchange 
(PLEX)  and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg).1-[ADDRESS_955233] Rationale . Autoreactive B cells play an important role in the immunopathogenesis of MG 
and as such would seem to be appropriate for targeted drug therapy investigation.17 Recent 
examples from other autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE) and multiple sclerosis (MS), which also frequently have poor response to 
current conventional therapy and frequent relapses or ref ractory disease, have suggested benefit 
with B cell directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].18-[ADDRESS_955234] therapy for non-
Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) as well as a number of autoimmune diseases.18,23,[ADDRESS_955235] s.4-8,26-33 It is, however, unclear what 
changes in the cellular and molecular immune system are associated with the clinica l 
improvement.

convincing steroid -sparing agent is azathioprine ( AZA) with some recent evidence supporting 
methotrexate ( MTX ).36,37 The current mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) and tacrolimus data are not 
very strong  but are suggestive of some benefit.9,[ADDRESS_955242] protocol for rituximab infusion in MG has not been established.  
Therefore, the non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL) treatment protocol was adopted which consist s 
of weekly infusions at 375 mg/m2.   One cycle is defined as [ADDRESS_955243] s continued to remain on prednisone and/or additional 
immunotherapy. Six out 10 AChR+ subject s in this study needed to be retreated to maintain initial 
clinical benefits. We believe that an additional treatment cycle may be indicated  to achieve a 
durable response in parallel to successful withdrawal/reduction of steroids and/or other chronic 
immunotherapy. Retrospective analysis of twenty MG subject s followed in our neuromuscular 
clinic has shown that only [ADDRESS_955244] s were immuno therapy -free after completing one cycle 
as compared to 12 of 20 following two cycles. Mean steroid dose was reduced by 65% and 86% 
following one and two cycles, respectively. This suggests that a two -cycle protocol may be more 
clinically advantageous  in MG  and serves as the basis for our approach.   Retrospective analysis 
of our data with the DCC also revealed that 82% of subjects  who received rituximab achieved at 
least a 75% reduction in their prednisone dose at 52 weeks (95% CI: 48% -98%).   This statistica l 
analysis is the basis for our primary endpoint.

Page 20 of 77 dose was 260 mg/m2 weekly for four weeks. Clinical symptoms of MG such as diplopia and muscle 
fatigability as well as pulmonary function tests showed improvement with a decrease in the serum 
AChR antibody levels.  
 
This was followed by [CONTACT_703499]. In 
2008, Illa and co -workers reported treating six severe refractory MG subject s (three AChR+ and 
three MuSK+  (Muscle Specific Kinase Antibody Pos itive)) with rituximab at 375 mg/m2 weekly for 
four weeks.5 All six cases (five MGFA Grade IVb and one Grade V) dramatically improved clinically.  
There was a decline in serum antibody titers in both AChR+ and MuSK+ groups.  There appeared 
to be a more sustained clinical improvement in the MuSK+ group.   No severe adverse events were 
reported.  
 
Investigators in the [LOCATION_008] reported data obtained from a nationwide survey of physicians 
treating MG.[ADDRESS_955246] s diagnosed with generalized MG (seven AChR+ and 
three MuSK+) and two with Lambert -Eaton myasthenic syndrome. Rituximab was administered in 
standard doses in eight cases, whereas the rest received one or two infusions at 375 mg/m2. Over 
the 4 to 48 month follow -up period, three of seven AChR+ MG cases improved on their MGFA 
post-interventio n status, whereas all MuSK+ cases improved. Both Lambert -Eaton myasthenic 
syndrome cases improved but did not achieve remission. Four subject s did not have significant 
benefit from rituximab, three of which received fewer than four infusions.  
 
There are ot her small case series that have suggested similar efficacy of rituximab in generalized 
MG.8,29,30 Lebrun and coworkers evaluated  six bedridden MG cases; one was AChR+, three had 
MuSK+, and two were double -seronegative cases.6 Rituximab was administered at 375 mg/m2 on 
Days 1, 8, 15, and [ADDRESS_955247] s to evaluate B cell 
targeted therapy in medically refractory generalized MG, including both MuSK+ and AChR + 
antibody subject s.[ADDRESS_955248] dose of 375 mg/m2 weekly.  Each cycle 
was defined as one infusion per week for four consecutive weeks. Interval between cycles was 
set at 6 months.  In this analysis, we showed that rituximab led to a sustained clinical improvement 
in parallel to a reduction or discontinuation of corticosteroid  therapy and plasma exchange 
treatments. We observed a prednisone dose reduction by a mean of 85.7% and 93.8% after two 
and three cycles of rituximab, respectively.  AChR antibody titers significantly decreased by a 
mean of 52.1% after the second cycle (p = 0.005).  
 
A group in Europe recently published a report describing seventeen drug -resistant MG subject s 
treated with rituximab (six MuSK+ and eleven AChR+).[ADDRESS_955249] -treatment period of 31 
months, ten of the AChR+ subject s improved but six of them needed reinfusions. In contrast, all 
MuSK+ subject s achieved a remission or min imal manifestations status and no need for 
reinfusions. Consequently, in the MuSK+ group, prednisone doses were reduced (average dose 
before rituximab: 49 mg/day; at last visit: 6.5 mg/day) and other immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_703472]. Clinical improvement  was associated with a significant decrease in the antibody titers 
only in the MuSK+ subject s (mean reduction of 86.7%, p = 0.002). MuSK antibody levels were 
either negative or decreased at the last follow -up period. They concluded that rituximab has long -
lasting benefits in MuSK+ subject s and recommend rituximab as an early therapeutic option in 
this group of subject s with MG if they do not respond to steroids. AChR+ subject s also responded 
to treatment but required repeat treatment.

is an infusion reaction consisting mainly of fever, rigors, nausea and hypotension.  Progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is the most significant complication, however, the relative 
risk is thought to be low per a recent review40. Per this review, there have been a total of 57 PML 
cases following rituximab therapy in HIV -negative patients from 1997 to 2008.  These numbers 
are based on cases reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as well as reported in 
the medical li terature. Fifty -two of the cases were patients with B -cell lymphoproliferative 
disorders and the remaining 5 cases were patients with an autoimmune disorder (i.e., SLE, 
rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune pancytopenia).  There have been no cases of PML report ed in 
MG subject s treated with rituximab.  We plan to minimize concomitant immunosuppressive 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_703473] s and plan to enroll subjects who are either only on prednisone or on 
prednisone plus only one other IST.  Please refer to eligibility crit eria for specific details.  These 
regimens represent real world scenarios and are also consistent with the types of patients 
included in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]7.  We recommend this type of approach prior to initiating rituximab as 
combination treatments could pos e a higher PML risk.   
 
Please refer to the study drug package insert for additional details.

time of enrollment will be expected to be on a stable fixed dose of prednisone (minimum dose of 
15 mg/day) for at least 4 weeks (28 days) with stable symptoms. Prednisone dose variation would 
be limited to less than 6 mg/day on average in the 4 weeks (28 days) prior to the start of the study  
or randomization . There will be two groups of standard of care treatment regimens and are d efined 
as: 
• Prednisone only.

A total of 50 AChR + subject s would be enrolled (25 in a treatment 
arm and 25 in a placebo arm). The subjects will be evaluated every 
4 weeks for 52 weeks after initial treatment.  There are two 
additional  optional time points at weeks 72 and 96 in order to follow 
B cell rec overy and long -term durability of response.

Page 22 of 77 • Prednisone plus another IST.   The prednisone dose must be as defined above and the 
subject must be on a stable dose for at least [ADDRESS_955254]:  azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetile, cycl osporine, tacrolimus or 
methotrexate.  
 
Study Duration.  We set a study period of 52 weeks based on the delayed benefits observed 
following rituximab treatment and in the setting of  utilizing a two -cycle protocol.  
 
In order to assess the long -term durabilit y of response, there are two additional optional 
observational off study -intervention  time points (weeks 72 and 96). The subject s will be treated 
per medical standard of care during this period.   The extended time points are also needed as 
normalization of B cell counts typi[INVESTIGATOR_20187] 12+ months following B cell depletion treatment.  
 
Randomization.   Randomization will be performed through an interactive website, and will be 
stratified based on t he steroid dose at baseline: moderate dose prednisone (15 -35 mg/day) and 
high dose prednisone (>35 mg/day)  as well as standard of care treatment regimen at the baseline 
visit (prednisone only vs. prednisone plus another IST) . Subjects will be assigned a st udy ID at 
the time of enrollment.  The study ID includes the identification of the center and a unique subject 
ID.  The DCC will generate a randomization table for each of the strata using a permuted block 
design with random block sizes.  
 
Blinding .  This is a double -blind clinical trial.  All study subjects and Clinical Study Staff will be 
blinded to treatment assignment.  The Clinical Study Site Investigator is responsible reviewing all 
adverse events and adjusting subjects’ prednisone dose based on the Myasthen ia Gravis 
Composite (MGC) score  without  knowing whether a subject has received drug or placebo.   The 
clinical evaluators who determine the secondary outcome measures, Myasthenia  Gravis 
Composite (MGC) and Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) , are bl inded to treatment 
assignment and clinical adverse event information.  Site Pharmacists will be the only staff who 
have access to treatment information.    
 
Rituximab . Treatment group will receive a total of two cycles of rituximab ( 375mg/m2) separated 
by 6 months. Each cycle is defined as one infusion per week for four consecutive weeks. As such, 
cycle 1 will be administered weeks 0-3 and cycle 2 will be given weeks 24 -27. The placebo group 
will receive an infusion that contains only the veh icle components of the rituximab solution.    
 
Prednisone.  A predetermined steroid taper schedule for both treatment (rituximab) and placebo 
groups will be utilized. In each subject, the prednisone dose will be gradually reduced based on 
the steroid taper s chedule beginning at week 8. The dose will only be reduced after confirming 
clinical improvement or stable symptoms based on the MGC score (≤ 2 point increase)  as 
compared to the Baseline Visit or prior study visit MGC score . If the MGC score change is ≥ [ADDRESS_955255] stabilized to 
baseline status (baseline  visit MGC score). After symptom stabilization, prednisone taper can 
again be resumed at next scheduled assessment. Subject s would co ntinue in the study even if 
they could not taper off higher doses of steroids (40 -60 mg/day) as long as their symptoms were 
controlled on that dose as this would be considered standard -of-care.  
 
Rescue Therapy.  If subject  symptoms significantly worsen dur ing the course of the trial and are 
not controlled by [CONTACT_703500] (high dose prednisone) , the subject  can receive PLEX 
or IVIg as a rescue therapy. PLEX  and IVIg  treated subject s would remain in the study and be

therapy. PLEX  and IVIg  treated subject s would remain in the study and be included in data 
analysis. The rationale for this is that these subject s would have already been up  titrated to a high 
prednisone dose but  failed to adequately respond. Subject s that could not be managed with 
steroids , IVIg, or  PLEX and required additional immunotherapy (e.g., pulse IV steroids , 
azathioprine, etc. ) would be considered treatment failures  and likely withdrawn from the study .  
 
Sample size has been determined to include a 20% subject withdrawal rate and will not replace

4.4.5  Randomization/Treatment Assignment  
 
Randomization will be performed through an interactive website, and  will be stratified based on 
the steroid dose at baseline, moderate dose prednisone (15 -35 mg/day) and high dose 
prednisone (>35 mg/day), as well as standard of care treatment regimen at the baseline visit.  
Subjects will be assigned a study ID at the time  of enrollment.  The study ID includes the 
identification of the center and a unique subject ID.  The DCC will generate a randomization table 
for each of the strata using a permuted block design with random block sizes.  
5 STUDY INTERVENTIONS/STUDY MEDICATION /STUDY DRUG OR DEVICE  
5.1 Study Medications/Interventions, Administration, and Duration  
 
Genentech, Inc . will provide rituximab (Rituxan ®) and matching placebo labeled for 
investigational use. The NeuroNEXT central pharmacy, the Clinical Materials Services Uni t 
(CMSU) at the University of [COMPANY_002]ster Medical Center (URMC) will create active and placebo 
study drug kits with unique identifiers not associated with the randomization ID . Each kit will 
contain 12 of the 100mg/10ml vials of the Rituxan ® or matching plac ebo and four (4) of the 
500mg/50ml vials of the Rituxan ® or matching placebo.  Each kit is good for 1 full cycle of dosing 
(4 infusions over the course of 4 weeks) of study drug assuming a maximum dose of 
800mg/weekly dose.  Each subject will receive a tot al of 2 full kits to allow for 2 full cycles of 
dosing. The CMSU will provide each approved site with an appropriate number of active and 
placebo kits to support subjects enrolled at the site. CMSU will prepare  and dispense both study 
drug and placebo control.  The Protocol PI [INVESTIGATOR_703475], dispensation, and disposal or return of all study  drug in accordance with 
Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (C.F .R.), Part 312.57 and 312.62 and Genentech 
requirements.  
 
Rituximab is a highly purified, 1328 –amino acid antibody with an approximate molecular mass of 
145 kD.  The chimeric mouse/human anti -CD20  antibody is a glycosylated IgG1  
immunoglobulin containing  murine light and heavy chain variable regions and human 1 heavy 
chain and  light chain constant regions . 
 
Rituximab will be administered intravenously (IV) at 375mg/m2 weekly consecutively for four 
weeks and then repeated at six months . To prevent infus ion-associated reactions, each subject 
will be administered premedication with [ADDRESS_955272] rituximab 
infusion.   These symptoms include flu -like symptoms, fever, chills/rigors, nausea, urticaria, 
headache, bronchospasm, angioedema, and hypotension.   Since hypotension may occur during 
Rituximab in Myasthenia Gravis  
Version 11.0 
Version date 07/05/[ADDRESS_955273] s treated with rituximab. 
Therefore, cardiac monitoring will be performed during and after all infusions  (immediate post -
infusion period) for subject s with a history of cardiac disease. In the pooled, placebo -controlled 
studies, the proportion of patients wi th serious cardiovascular reactions was 1.7% and 1.3% in 
the rituximab  and placebo treatment groups, respectively. In rare instances, severe and fatal 
infusion -related reactions have occurred.    
 
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is the most significant potential complication, 
however, the relative risk is thought to be low  in HIV negative subjects based on a recent review.40 
The incidence is < [ADDRESS_955274] prior to 
initiating rituximab and to limit use of rituximab treatment to the groups as defined above as 
combined treatments could pose a higher PML risk. Refer to the manufacture Investigator’s 
Brochure for additional details.  Subjects who are on prednisone plus one other IST, will continue 
to have routine safety monitor ing as per standard of care practices specific to that IST.  This 
monitoring will be conducted by [CONTACT_703507].    
5.2 Handling of Study Medication s/Intervention s 
 
Overview.   Rituximab is formulated for IV administration as a sterile product in 9.0  mg/mL sodium 
chloride, 0.7  mg/mL polysorbate 80, 7.35  mg/mL sodium citrate dihydrate, and Sterile Water for 
Injection (pH  6.5).  Rituximab is a sterile, clear, colorless, preservative -free liquid concentrate for 
intravenous (IV) administration. Rituximab is  supplied at a concentration of 10 mg/mL in either 
100 mg (10 mL) or 500 mg (50 mL) single -use vials  and will be reconstituted for infusion by [CONTACT_39722]’s investigational drug  pharmacy in  0.9%NaCl or D5W . Local pharmacists should refer to the 
Study Drug Package Insert provided to obtain guidance on  the dilution of Rituximab, and follow 
the institutional policies for the specific dilution ratio.  
 
Placebo will be provided by [CONTACT_703508] a sterile product in 9.0  mg/mL sodium chloride, 
0.7 mg/mL polysor bate 80, 7.35  mg/mL sodium citrate dihydrate, and Sterile Water for Injection 
(pH 6.5).  Placebo will be reconstituted for infusion by [CONTACT_779]’s investigational drug pharmacy or 
appropriately trained designee for IV administration as a sterile product of 0.9%NaCl or D5W.   
 
To prevent infusion -associated reactions, each subject will be administered premedication with

8C (36F–46F) for 24  hours and at room temperature (23 C) for an additional 24  hours.  
However, since Rituximab solutions do not contain preservative, diluted solutions should be 
stored refrigerated (2 C–8C).  No incompatibilities between rituximab and polyvinyl chloride or 
polyethylene bags have been observ ed.  A temperature monitoring log is to be maintained at all 
sites to record temperature on an at least daily basis.

375 mg/m2 for each infusion.  For more details, please refer to the NN103 Drug Dispensing 
System Users Manual  and Site Pharmacy Manual . 
   
Note: The weight recorded at Baseline Visit should be used for the first Infusion Cycle  
(Infusion s1-4) and the weight recorded at Week 24 Visit should be used for the second Infusion 
Cycle  (Infusion s 5-8). 
 
Rituximab should be given as a slow intravenous infusion.  It should not be administered as an 
intravenous push or bolus.  Premedi cation as noted in Section 5.[ADDRESS_955277] Infusion  (Infusion 1 only) : Initiate infusion at a rate of 50 mg/hr.  In the absence 
of infusion to xicity, increase infusion r ate by 50 mg/hr in crements every 30 minutes, to a  
maximum of 400  mg/hr. 
 
Subsequent Infusions  (Infusions 2 -8):  Initiate infus ion at a rate of 100 mg/hr.  In the  
absence  of infusion toxicity, increase rate by 100 mg/hr increments at 30-minute 
intervals, to a maximum of 400  mg/hr. 
 
If a hypersensitivity (non -IgE-mediated) or an infusion reaction develops,  the infusion rate 
should be reduced to half that rate, i.e. from 100 mg/h to 50 mg/h.  Subjects who experience a 
moderate to severe infusion related reaction (fever, chills, or hypotension) should have their 
infusion interrupted immediately and should receive aggressive symptomatic treatment.  The

5.2.3  Local Labs Prior to Infusion  
 
Lab panels will be drawn and analyzed locally  up to 1 day  prior to initiation of study drug infusion.  
Lab panels will include complete metabolic panels (including LFT and GFR calculation), uric acid, 
LDH and CBC with differential (including ANC).  These labs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_703509] n.   
5.3 Study Drug Accountability  
 
In accordance with local regulatory requirements, the investigator, designated site staff, or head 
of the medical institution (where applicable) must document the amount of investigational product 
dispensed and/or administered to study subjects, the amount  received from the central pharmacy, 
and the amount destroyed upon completion of the study. Each site  investigator is responsible for 
ensuring product accountability records are maintained throughout the course of the study.   The 
designated unblinded pharm acist will keep drug inventory and accountability logs.  The inventory 
will include details of rituximab received and dispensed to subjects, batch, and ID numbers. All 
unused vials must be kept until reconciliation of delivery records with accountability l ogs by [CONTACT_36102]. After the monitor has performed accountability, the site will be instructed by [CONTACT_703510]/device or return it to the Central 
Pharmacy or manufacturer. An accounting must be made of any drug deliberately or accidentally 
destroyed. Discrepancies between the amount of  rituximab received and dispensed drug must be 
reconciled.

of the study  (i.e. through week 52) .   Subjects who are on pyridostigmine (≤ 480 mg/day) at the 
time of enrollment must remain on a stable dose throughout the course of the study, and cannot 
be chang ed.  
 
These requirements are not applicable to the optional off-intervention  follow -up visits. During 
this time subjects will be treated per best medical practice (standard of care) for their MG at the 
discretion of the treating physician. However, a s the primary focus of the two additional optional 
observational time points is to assess B cell recovery/repopulation as a safety measure,  
subjects who have received treatment with rituximab, or have been involved with other 
interventions that result in b cell depletion since completion of the trial (i.e. Week 52) will be 
excluded from the optional off -intervention follow -up visits.  
 
For more details please refer to section 6.4.[ADDRESS_955281] compliance with study intervention (rituximab) will be directly monitored at the infusion 
center.  Subjects will complete a daily prednisone dose log that will be collected and reviewed 
every 4 weeks to monitor steroid compliance during the study.

• Subjects will be provided with information about the HIV and Hepatitis testing prior to the 
blood draw.  Subjects will be referred for HIV and hepatitis post -test counseling and 
medical care at each institution if necessary.  
 
• A 2-view chest x-ray (poste rioranterior and lateral), and EKG will be obt ained to document 
baseline status.  Chest x -rays will be read by a local radiologist, and EKGs will be read 
locally by [CONTACT_703512]/cardiologist  or any qualified physician . If a cardiologist /internist  is 
not available to do the read, it is recommended for the EKG to be remotely read , if 
possible based on the site’s current setup.  
 
Note: If the subject has had a chest x -ray done within [ADDRESS_955287] x -ray s ource document will be 
required.  
 
• Immunization status or need for the following vaccinations in advance of randomization 
will be completed:  tetanus, diphtheria, influe nza, pneumococcus polysaccharide, 
Varicella , measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) and hepatitis  B vaccines.   
 
Note: Any required vaccination/booster for a subject  must be given at least 28 days 
(4 weeks ) prior to the baseline/randomization visit .  Required immunizations should be 
determined based on a subject’s age and comorbidities and are per best medical practice 
standard.  
 
• MGC, MG -ADL and MG -QOL assessments will be completed . (Note: MG -QOL should be 
administered prior to other outcomes evalua tions.)  
 
• Women of child bearing potential will be instructed to take proper precautions to avoid 
pregnancy.  
 
• When inclusion/exclusion criteria are met, protocol eligibility and admission information 
consisting of demographic data including age, sex, past medical history, concomitant 
medications including prednisone dose, prior AChR  antibody titer  history , confirm ation of 
no history of thymoma  on each subject  will be documented.   Subject s will be instructed 
not to take pyridostigmine for at least 12 hours prior to the Baseline  Visit and each follow -
up visit.    
 
Note:  It is recommended that a  chest CT or MRI  source document (i.e. radiology report)  
be obtained to evaluate for thymoma during the  prescreening  process  to determine 
eligibility .

dosag e.  These will be collected, reviewed  and information recorded at the Baseline 
Visit and each scheduled visit thereafter.  
 
• Concomitant medications will be recorded.  
 
6.4.2  Baseline Visit Evaluations and Procedures  
 
All screening evaluations to determine eligibility will be completed within 4 to 6 weeks of 
screening visit (refer to SOA for details).  All successfully screened subjects will be randomized 
into the study within 6 weeks.  
 
The following will be performed during the baseline visit:  
 
• Prednisone diaries will be reviewed to ensure that subje cts have maintained a stable 
prednisone dose during the 28 days before the Baseline Visit.  A stable dose is defined 
as a dose that does not  vary by ≥ 6mg per day on average.  
• All Eligibility Criteria will be reviewed and verified by [CONTACT_6962].  The site 
investigator will sign off on the eligibility confirmation form prior to the randomization of 
any subject.  
• Subjects will undergo a complete physical examination  
• Vital signs will be measured  
• Urine Pregnancy Test  
• Phlebotomy will be performed in ord er to analyze the following (Note: Subjects will be 
asked to hold their usual prednisone dose on the day of the visit. ): 
o Specialized bloods: AChR  antibody titer, Total IgG, IgA and IgM levels, IgG 
subclasses (1,2,3, 4), and Flow Cytometry to assess B cell counts   
▪ NOTE – Specialized bloods should be drawn prior to daily prednisone 
dose.  
o Mechanistic bloods (immune cell analyses)  
 
• Outcome Assessments:  MGC, QMG, MG-ADL and MG -QOL will be completed . (Note: 
MG-QOL should be administered prior to other outcomes evaluations.)

Infusion [ADDRESS_955289] within 3 days 
of the Week 24 Visit.  
 
If, for any r eason, an infusion is held during either of the two cycles, it can be postponed up to 
one week (7 days) after the original scheduled date.  
 
• If the delayed infusion is administered within that one week, the subsequent  infusion 
should take place within the original time window  in order to resume  the initial infusion 
schedule . For example, if Infusion 2 is delayed but administered < 7 days  after the 
scheduled date, Infusion 3 should be administered as originally planned and not 
delayed as well .  
 
**Note** Two  separate Infusions should not be scheduled on consecutive days.  There 
should be a minimum of one day in between infusions.   
 
• If an Infusion is delayed by [CONTACT_185883] (7 days), then all subsequent infusions should be 
delayed by [CONTACT_703513]. For example  if Infusion [ADDRESS_955290] 28 days after Infusion 1.  
 
**Note** If the Infusion cycles are delayed, the 4th infusion must take place prior to the 
Week [ADDRESS_955291] on the same day,  
 
• If an infusion is held and cannot be administered within one week (7 days) of the original 
scheduled date, then that Infusion will be skipped altogether  (this will be designated as 
“missed”) , and efforts should be made to administer all subsequent infusions as 
scheduled.  
 
• If the 1st infusion of either cycle (Infusion 1 or 5) cannot be administered as scheduled , it 
can be delayed up to one week  after the original date. Subsequent infusions will be 
anchored o n the new date of the first infusion  and will follow the  weekly  window 
described above. If the first infusion of the cycle cannot be administered within one 
week of the original  date,  then that Infusion will be skipped altogether (this will be 
designated as “missed”), The schedule will then resume with second infusion of that 
cycle (i.e. the second infusion and all subsequent infusions will be anchored to the 
original date of the  first infusion ).

6.4.8  Prednisone Dose Adjustments  
 
Subjects will be treated with a minimum oral prednisone dose of 15 mg/day or equivalent every 
other day until week 8.  Each subject’s prednisone dose will be evaluated at the Week 4 Visit .   
 
The prednisone dose cannot  be tapered at the Week 4 Visit. It should be  maintained at enrollment 
dose and only increased in cases of clinical worsening  (as determined by [CONTACT_703515])  only, 
per the site investigator’s discretion.    
  
Forced Prednisone Taper  
 
A forced prednisone steroid taper will begin at the Week [ADDRESS_955299]'s baseline MGC score  and prior study visit .  The MGC score will be 
calculated, confirmed and available during the study visit in order to make steroid dose 
adjustment. Prednisone dose will be lowered at every 4 -week assessment beginning at the Week

Note: While typi[INVESTIGATOR_703480] 60 mg per day  (or equivalent on 
alternating days) , the above t able details a taper schedule with rows  shaded in grey if subjects 
enter the study on a higher dose.  The absolute maximum allowable prednisone dose at study 
entry is 100 mg per day  (or equivalent on alternating days).    
 
As subjects may be on a dose that is s lightly different than the above (i.e., 45 mg/day, 
alternating doses), the tapered dose will begin at the closest lower dose on the table and then 
follow tapering as per protocol.   Subjects taking more than 100 mg/day or 200 mg over a two 
day period  will b e excluded from the study.     
 
It is recommended that the Prednisone Dose Adjustment at Week 52 be done in the same 
manner as the other clinical study visits (i.e. tapered, maintained, or increased based on the 
subject’s MGC score) .  However, i f the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_703481] (i.e., for safety related reasons for instance), this will 
be allowed . If the decision is to not adjust the prednisone dose per protocol at Week 52, please  
notify the study t eam prior to proceeding.  
 
Prednisone Dose Adjustment s in Case s of Clinical Worsening  
 
If the MGC score is 3 or more points higher than the Baseline Visit score : 
❖ The taper will be stopped and prednisone will be increased per the guidelines  below.   
 
If the MGC score is less than or no more than 2 points higher than the Baseline  Visit score, but 
has increased 3 or more points than the MGC score at the previous  Study  Visit: 
❖ The taper will be stopped and prednisone dose may be either  held or increased per study 
prednisone schedule. The decision to hold or increase the prednisone dose in this case is at 
the discretion of the Site Investigator.  
 
Note: The prednisone dose will be increased until symptoms are resolved or at least stabilized 
to baseline status (MGC score is the same or less than the Baseline  Visit score).  
 
The following schedule will be followed  for sub jects with clinical worsening and who  require the 
prednisone dose to be increased:   
• For subjects on > 15 mg daily or the equivalent for every other day dosing, it is 
recommended that the prednisone daily dose be initially increased by 20 mg.  
•  For subjects on ≤ 15 mg daily or the equivalent fo r every other day dosing, prednisone may 
be increased by 10 or 20 mg, at the physician’s discretion.   
• If the prednisone dose is up titrated, the maximum dose would be 60 mg/day even if the 
subject was on a higher dose at study entry.  
 
Once symptoms stabilize (MGC score is the same or less than the Baseline Visit score  and not 
more than 2 points above the prior study visit ), the prednisone taper can again be resumed per 
the above protocol at the next scheduled visit/assessment.

Page 45 of 77 This is a forced stero id taper that is based on MGC score.  If the site investigator (treating 
physician) did not taper per protocol , this will be recorded as a  protocol deviation and will be 
corrected immediately .  As this is linked with primary outcome we wanted to make the decision 
on lowering the dose as objective as possible .  A mechanism will be put in place to double check 
the MGC score calculation made at the visit and whether or not prednisone adjustment decision 
was made correctly.   
 
6.4.9  Physical Exam  
 
A physical exam will be completed at the Screening Visit, Baseline Visit, weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 
24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48 and 52  Visits , as well as the optional  weeks 72 and 96  Visits .   
 
The physical exam will include assigning a  MGFA clinical classification grade. Th e grades are 
as follows:  
Class I - Any ocular muscle weakness, may have weakness of eye closure, all other 
muscle strength is normal.  
Class II – Mild weakness affecting other than ocular muscles, may also have ocular 
muscle weakness of any severity.  
Class III – Moderate weakness affecting other than ocular muscles, may also have 
ocular muscle weakness of any severity.  
IIIa. Predominantly affecting limb, axial muscles, or both. May also have lesser 
involvement of oropharyngeal muscles.  
IIIb. Predomin antly affecting oropharyngeal, respi[INVESTIGATOR_109458], or both. May 
also have lesser or equal involvement of limb, axial muscles, or both.  
Class IV – Severe weakness affecting other than ocular muscles, may also have ocular 
muscle weakness of any severity.  
IVa. Predominantly affecting limb, axial muscles, or both. May also have lesser 
involvement of oropharyngeal muscles.  
IVb. Predominantly affecting oropharyngeal, respi[INVESTIGATOR_109458], or both. May 
also have lesser or equal involvement of limb, axial muscle s, or both.  
Class V – Defined by [CONTACT_384277], with or without mechanical ventilation, except when 
employed during routine postoperative management.    
 
6.4.10  Study Medication/Intervention Discontinuation Evaluations/ Procedures  
 
Subjects will be monitored through regular physical examinations, vital signs, laboratory tests, 
and incidence and severity of adverse events. Infections will be treated symptomatically. 
Cardiovascular risk factors will be assessed prospectively by [CONTACT_703516] (e.g., family 
histo ry, smoking history, and status).   The safety evaluations will be conducted on conventional 
safety variables, such as serious adverse events, laboratory tests, and vital  sign changes. In 
particular, B cell counts, immunoglobulin levels, infusion -related re actions, and thromboses, 
infections will be carefully examined.  
 
Adverse events will be reviewed and recorded at each study visit and infusion visit.  An adverse 
event is any untoward, undesired, or unplanned event in the form of signs, symptoms, disease, 
laboratory or physiologic observations occurring in study participants.  Information on adverse 
effects of medication and on inter -current events will be determined at each visit by [CONTACT_703517] 11.0 
Version date 07/05/2017  
Page 46 of 77 questioning of the subjects, clinical examination, and laboratory t ests. Tolerability will be 
determined by [CONTACT_703518].   
 
Study Hold Rules (Safety) . 
 
Individual study subjects may be withdrawn from the study medication but  continue  to be followed 
for safety if subjects develop a grade 3 or more suspected toxicity as graded by [CONTACT_28129]’s ( NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  Version 4.0 
or a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  related to study medi cation  as determined by [CONTACT_703519] (IMM) .  Grade 3 adverse events are s evere or medically significant but n ot 
immediately life -threatening and may cause  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48622] .  Descriptions of CTC AE grading criteria are included in the Manual of Operations and 
SAEs are specifically defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  Subjects will be allowed to resume participation 
in the study if their suspected toxicity or adverse event (AE) resolves completely and if the 
judgment of the investigator  and IMM  it is safe for the subject to continue.  
 
 
Please see Section 8 for additional details regarding Criteria For Intervention Discontinuation . 
 
Please also see Package Insert and Investigator Brochure  for additional safety information. 
Additional safety monitoring visits will be at the discretion of the investigator or as directed by [CONTACT_703520]/or other regulatory authorities.  
 
Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869] (Safety) . 
 
The study will be permanently stopped  and no further administration of rituximab will be given if 
the investigator, the IRB and/or DSMB and/or any other institutional or regulatory body deems it 
inappropriate for the study to resume due to the following:  
 
A significant number of  enrolled subj ects develop safety concerns that cannot otherwise be 
attributed to MG, infections, disease relapse or pre -existent comorbidities  as deemed by [CONTACT_145858].   
 
 Please also see SOA  for additional safety monitoring information. Additional safety monitoring 
visits  will be at the discretion of the investigator or as directed by [CONTACT_4158]/or other regulatory 
authorities.

Page 47 of 77 There are two additional off study -intervention  time points (week 72 and 96) to assess durability 
of response as well as monitor B cell count no rmalization.  Subjects will have similar clinic al 
evaluations as during the on -study drug intervention period.  Subjects will be treated per 
medical standard of care. For more details regarding these visits, please refer to the SOA  and 
Section 6.4.5.    
 
6.4.12  Unscheduled Visits  
 
Subjects will be clinically evaluated at an Unscheduled Visit at the discretion of the treating 
physician for an y concern of disease relapse and/or significant worsening of symptoms as well 
concern for adverse event related to study.  A standard physical exam and the MGC score 
assessments will be performed during this visit.  Prednisone diary will also be reviewed.  Blood 
work will also be performed as per SOA  and primary study team recommendations .    
 
The following are recommended to be  performed during Unscheduled Visits:  
• Prednisone diaries will be collected and reviewed  
o Prednisone dose may be evaluated and increased at the Unscheduled Visit per Site 
Investigator judgment in cases of clinical worsening. Prednisone tapering should not 
occur at Unscheduled Visits that occur after Week 8. If the Site Investigator feels

has been diagnosed  with betwe en weeks 52 and 72 and weeks 72 and 96 .  
6.5.5  Treatment History  
 
All prior treatments  from the time of diagnosis (a minimum of one year’s history prior to screening)  
with immune therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (prednisone, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, monoclonal antibodies, 
etc.) will be obtained from the subject source documents.  Treatment history between weeks 52 
and 72 and weeks 72 and 96 will be documented at the optional off-intervention  follow -up visits . 
MG-related medication, including prednisone dose and/or any changes if applicable will be 
recorded.  
6.5.6  Concomitant Medications/Treatments  
 
All immune therapi[INVESTIGATOR_703483]. MG -related medication (including prednisone dose and/or any 
changes if applicable) taken between weeks 52 and 72 and weeks 72 and 96 will be 
documented at the optional off -intervention follow -up visits. Any immunosuppressive  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_703484].   
 
**Note** Subjects who have received treatment with rituximab, or have been involved with other

excluded from the optional off -intervention follow -up visits.  
6.5.[ADDRESS_955304]’s vaccination record and the need for immunization will be  carefully 
evaluated prior to receiving study drug.  For those who are likely to require immunization in the 
foreseeable future, such as subjects planning to travel to countries where specifi c immunization 
is required or subjects requiring vaccination/booster for their professional activity, any required 
vaccination/booster must be given at least 4  weeks prior to the baseline/randomization visit .  
Review of the subject’s immunization status or  need for the following vaccinations in advance of 
randomization  (as noted previously)  will be completed : tetanus, diphtheria, influenza, 
pneumococcus polysa ccharide, varicella, measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) and hepatitis  B, 
vacci nes. Required immunization s should be determined based on a subject’s age and 
comorbidities and are per best medical practice standard.  
 
The safety and efficacy of immunization with a live or at tenuated live vaccine in B  cell depleted 
subject s are not known.  For this reason, the use of live or attenuated vaccines (e.g.,  measles, 
mumps, rubella, oral polio vaccine, Bacillus Calmette -Guérin [BCG], typhoid, yellow fever, 
vaccinia,  varicella -zoster virus ( VZV) or any  other vaccines not yet licensed but belonging to this 
category) is specifically excluded 28  days prior to screening through the end of the 52 week 
follow -up period or until return of B  cells to within normal limits or baseline.  
 
Vaccines that do not cont ain live organisms (e.g.,  influenza, Pneumovax , tetanus) are not 
prohibited; however, vaccinat ions during B cell depletion may be ineffective.

6.5.13  Biomarker/Mechanistic Studies  
 
The biomarker or mechanistic studies are focused on identifying how treatment modifies the 
immunopathology of MG. We will study changes in the antigen specific  components of the MG 
immune system. We have developed/adap ted immunoassays so that we can examine 
autoantibodies, B cells and T cells. The principal mechanistic outcome  will be the decrease in titer 
of circulating AChR autoantibodies within an individual. Other e xploratory mechanism -based 
outcomes  include determi ning how rituximab modifies antigen -specific B cell frequency, the B cell 
repertoire, B cell activating factor (BAFF) levels and whether rituximab modifies antigen -specific 
T cell frequency and phenotype. Measurements will be performed prior to and during B cell 
depletion and through repopulation of the B cell compartment, which will be of particular interest 
in terms of assessing the durability of the treatment.   Blood will be collected for mechanistic 
studies at the Baseline Visit,  Week [ADDRESS_955310] rituximab 
infusion.   These symptoms include flu -like symptoms, fever, chills/rigors , nausea, urticaria, 
headache, bronchospasm, angioedema, and hypotension .  Since hypotension may occur during 
rituximab infusion, consideration should be given to withholding antihypertensive medications [ADDRESS_955311] occurred.   
 
If a hypersensitivity (non -IgE-mediated) or an infusion reaction develops,  the infusion rate should 
be reduced to half that rate, i.e. from 100 mg/h to 50 mg/h.  Subjects who experience a moderate 
to severe infusion related reaction (fever, chills, or hypotension) should have their infusion 
interrupted immediately and should receive aggressive symptomatic tr eatment  per local 
institutional policy or protocol .  The infusion should not be restarted before all the symptoms have 
disappeared and then the infusion can continue at one -half the previous rate.   If hypersensitivity 
reaction should occur, subject will re ceive 100 mg methylprednisolone IV 30 minutes prior to the 
next infusion.  
 
The infusion should be interrupted for severe reactions, and supportive care measures should be 
instituted as medically indicated (e.g., IV fluids, vasopressors, oxygen, bronchodila tors, 
diphenhydramine, and acetaminophen).  The infusion should not be restarted until all the 
symptoms have disappeared.  
  
Pregnancy:  
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_703485] a contraceptive medication. However, the  outcome of all 
pregnancies that occur during paternal or maternal exposure to study drug (spontaneous 
miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or congenital abnormality) must be followed up a nd 
Rituximab in Myasthenia Gravis  
Version 11.0 
Version date 07/05/[ADDRESS_955312] has been withdrawn from the study. All reports of congenital 
abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs. Spontaneous miscarriages should also be reported and 
handled as SAEs. Elective abortions without complications should no t be handled as AEs. All 
outcomes of pregnancy must be reported to the data safety monitor .   
 
Disease -Related Events (DREs):  
Given that variations in symptoms are an inherent part of the natural history of MG, all recorded 
information regarding MG status will be captured as outcomes data. While disease relapse or 
treatment failure is not considered an AE in our study, the DSMB will monitor the percentage of 
treatment failures in the two groups.  If the treatment failure rate reaches a level of concern, the  
DSMB has the ability to stop the trial at any point.  In the setting of a forced steroid taper, we 
expect to possibly observe an increased frequency of disease relapse, particularly in the placebo 
group.  As the forced steroid taper is guided by [CONTACT_703528] s core, we do not expect for this to be a 
significant concern.  Relapses will be managed by [CONTACT_703529] (rescue therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ) depending on severity.  These are standard of care 
practices.   For the purpose o f this study, variation in MG symptoms will not be considered an AE 
unless the MG relapse requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_703486]. If a subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_703487], it will be reported as an SAE.  
 
[ADDRESS_955313], after which a Termination Visit 
will be conducted. The Termination Visit will mirror the Week 52 Visit.  
• If the SAE is resolved  within 90 days, the Termination Visit can occur  earlier . 
• If the SAE is not resolved wi thin 90 days, the SAE will be R esolved with Sequelae, and 
the Termination Visit occur.  
 
During the 90 day (or less) SAE follow -up period, no new AEs will be recorded. Existing AEs 
would be followed until resolution, or the Termination Visit, whichever comes first.  
 
Subjects tha t are withdrawn from the study or intervention discontinued due to reasons other than 
an SAE, will complete a Termination Visit only – no follow -up will be required.  
 
9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
The NeuroNEXT Data Coordinating Center has developed a statistical analysis plan, in 
collaboration with the PPI, co -PPI, co -investigators and protocol steering committee.  
 
9.1 General Design Issues  
 
9.1.1. Summary of Study Design  
 
A previous study conducted at Yale demonstrated that 82% of subjects who received rituximab 
achieved at least a 75% reduction in their prednisone dose at 52 weeks (95% CI: 48% -98%).  The 
Rituximab in Myasthenia Gravis  
Version 11.0 
Version date 07/05/[ADDRESS_955314] an absolute 30% increase in the frequency of favorable 
responses .60,61  If “futility” is declared , then  the results would imply that it is not cost effective to 
conduct a  future phase III trial with this agent.  If “futility” is not declared, then the study would  
suggest that there could be a potentially clinically meaningful effect of rituximab which shoul d be 
explored in a larger follow -up study.  
 
The proposed study will involve a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled multicenter futility 
study with 50 subjects randomized in a 1:1 manner to receive either rituximab or placebo (25 per 
group).  The primary objective of the study is to test whet her rituximab is a beneficial steroid 
sparing therapeutic for myasthenia gravis subject s.  A predetermined steroid taper schedule will 
be utilized.  At the time of enrollment, each subject  will be expected to be on a stable fixed dose 
of prednisone for at least 28 days (4 weeks).  Subjects assigned to the rituximab group will receive 
a total of two cycles of rituximab separated by [CONTACT_157515].  Each cycle is defined as one infusion 
(375 mg/m2) per week for four consecutive weeks.  As such, cycle 1 will be ad ministered at weeks 
0-3 and cycle 2 will be given during weeks 24 -27.  Subjects assigned to the placebo group will 
receive similar cycles of placebo.  
 
MGFA  clinical classification  grade along with quantitative testing (i.e., MG -ADL score, QMG 
score, MG Com posite, MG -QOL) will be assessed every four weeks.  The proposed study 
duration is [ADDRESS_955315], the prednisone dose will be gradually reduced based on 
the steroid taper schedule beginning at week 8 (8 weeks after starting cycle 1 of rituxima b).  The 
dose will only be reduced after confirming improvement or minimal stable symptoms based on 
judgment of the examining physician and MG Composite Score.  If symptoms worsen, the 
prednisone dose would immediately be increased until the symptoms impro ved and/or resolved.  
In addition, subject s who worsen can receive PLEX or IVIg if the investigator decides it is 
warranted, and these subject s can remain in the study.  Prednisone taper would again be resumed 
four weeks after the subject s have improved.  The dose of prednisone will be recorded by [CONTACT_703530].  
 
The primary endpoint will be a binary indicator of whether a subject achieved at least a 75% 
reduction of prednisone dose from baseline.  The endpoint will be computed by [CONTACT_703531] -week period prior to randomization versus the four 
week period at the end of the study (weeks 49 -52).  Secondary endpoints will include the MGC 
and QMG.  Other exploratory clinical endpoi nts will include MG -ADL, other clinical measures, 
immune markers, and safety evaluations.  There will be a treating investigator who does the dose 
adjustments and a blinded investigator who performs the blinded assessments.  
 
9.1.2. Randomization  
 
Randomiza tion will be performed through an interactive website, and will be stratified based on 
the steroid dose at baseline  [moderate (15 -35 mg/day)  vs. high (>35 mg/day) ] and baseline 
therapy (prednisone only vs. prednisone plus another IST) .  Subjects will be assigned a study ID 
at the time of enrollment.  The study ID includes the identification of the center and a unique 
subject ID.  The DCC will generate a randomization table for each of the strata using a permuted 
block design with random block sizes.  At t he time of randomization, the study coordinator logs 
into the study website and enter s the potential subject’s baseline prednisone dose as well as other 
Rituximab in Myasthenia Gravis  
Version 11.0 
Version date 07/05/[ADDRESS_955316] will then be randomized to one of the two treatments.  The study 
ID is added to all subsequent CRF’s and on the dispensed study medication.  
9.2 Outcomes  
9.2.1  Primary Outcome (including definition)  
 
The specific primary aim of this study is to determine whether rituximab is a safe a nd shows 
sufficient promise as a steroid sparing therapeutic for MG to warrant further study in a phase III 
efficacy trial.   Refer to Section 9.[ADDRESS_955317].  The primary endpoint is the percent of subjects that achieve a ≥ 75% 
reduction in mean daily prednisone in the four weeks prior to week 52 (week 49 -52) along with 
clinical improvement or no significant worsening of symptoms (≤2 point increase  in MG composite 
score)  as compared to the four week period prior to randomization . 
 
Safety . Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_128048] -related adverse experiences 
in the two groups.  
9.2.2  Secondary Outcome(s)  
 
Our secondary objective is to evaluate whether there is a trend toward clinical benefit as 
measured by [CONTACT_4224] -specific clinical ou tcome scales used as endpoints in prior clinical trials.  We 
will determine if rituximab can significantly improve the scores of the following MG -specific clinical 
outcome measures:  (1) Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC).   (2) Quantitative Myasthenia 
Gravi s (QMG) .  These studied measures would lay the groundwork toward optimizing the design 
of a subsequent phase III efficacy trial of rituximab in MG.   
 
Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) .  The MGC is a new end-point that has been  developed 
for MG.   Spec ific components of the QMG, MG-ADL, and manual muscle testing scales  are 
combined to obtain  the MGC score.  
 
Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) .  The QMG is a validated [ADDRESS_955318] that objectively 
measures ocular, bulbar, extremity fatigue/strength, and  respi[INVESTIGATOR_4806].   A battery of 
quantitative functional tests are completed from which a QMG score  is calculated .  
 
9.2.3  Exploratory Outcomes  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Exploratory Outcomes  
 
Determine if rituximab can significantly improve the scores of the following other previously 
validated MG -specific outcome measures: (1) MG -Activities of Daily Living score (MG -ADL).  (2) 
MG-Quality of Life (MG -QOL) score.  
 
Other previously used measures  of steroid -sparing effect will be assessed: (1) Mean daily 
prednisone dose at each scheduled assessment (every 4 weeks). (2) A delayed start of the area 
under the dose -time curve (AUDTC), starting at week 8. (3) Percentage of subject s achieving a ≥ 
50% me an daily prednisone dose reduction with maintenance of minimal or no sympto ms in 4 
weeks prior to week 52.  (4) Body mass index (Screening Visit and weeks 24 and 52).  (5) HbA1C  
(Screening Visit and week 52).   
Rituximab in Myasthenia Gravis  
Version 11.0 
Version date 07/05/2017  
Page 56 of 77  
MG flare rate (failure of therapy) will be as sessed by: (1) Number of rescue treatments (PLEX or 
IVIg) . (2) Number of times prednisone dose needed to be increased. (3) Frequency of a ≥ 3 -point 
increase in the MGC score.  
 
The primary focus of the two observational off study -intervention  time points (weeks 72 and 96) 
will be to assess B cell recovery/repopulation as a safety measure .  Specifically, we will examine: 
(1) Percentage of subjects achieving normal B cell counts at week 72 and 96.  ( 2) Percentage of 
achieving baseline B cell counts at week 72 and 96. (3) Percent B cell recovery to normal or 
baseline levels.  In addition, the long -term durability of response will also be assessed.  
Specifically, we will examine : (1) P ercentage of subje cts achieving a sustained ≥ 75% mean daily 
prednisone dose reduction . (2) Percentage of subject s achieving a ≥ 50% mean daily prednisone 
dose reduction . (3) Prednisone AUDTC (if applicable). (4) Clinical status as measured by [CONTACT_703532], MGC, MG -QOL and MG -ADL scores. (5) Number of rescue treatments (PLEX or IVIg) . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Biomarker/Mechanistic Exploratory Outcomes  
 
The biomarker or mechanistic studies are focused on identifying how treatment modifies the 
immunopathology of MG. We will study changes in the antigen specific  components of the MG 
immune system. We have developed/adapted immunoassays so that we can examine 
autoantibodies, B cells and T cells. The principal mechanistic outcome  will be the decrease in titer 
of circulating AChR  autoantibodies within an individual. Other e xploratory mechanism -based 
outcomes  include determining how rituximab modifies antigen -specific B cell frequency, the B cell 
repertoire, B cell activating factor (BAFF) levels and whether rituximab modifies anti gen-specific 
T cell frequency and phenotype. Measurements will be performed prior to and during B cell 
depletion and through repopulation of the B cell compartment, which will be of particular interest 
in terms of assessing the durability of the treatment.   Blood will be collected for mechanistic 
studies at the Baseline Visit,  Week 24 . Week 52  Visits , as well as the optional  Week 72 and Week 
96 Visits . 
9.3 Sample Size and Accrual  
Below, we introduce some key notation that we use to describe the analysis plan fo r the 
proposed trial:  
• Let pP represent the true (unknown) percentage of subjects treated with placebo who will 
achieve success on the primary endpoint  
• Let pR represent the true (unknown) percentage of subjects treated with rituximab who 
will achieve success on the primary endpoint  
Based on a prior study completed by [CONTACT_703533] 2008 on MMF in AChR+ MG, 
38.6% of placebo treated case achieved a trea tment response .38 The placebo start point was 34.1 
mg prednisone ; hence, 38.6% of placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_136833] a reduction of prednisone dose by [CONTACT_12697] 78%.  Also the MMF  start point was 30.7 mg prednisone ; therefore , 44.3% of MMF  recip ients 
had a reduction of prednisone dose by [CONTACT_2669] 76%.  Based on this information, we assume that 
40% of placebo recipi[INVESTIGATOR_703488] a 75% or greater prednisone dose reduction ( pP = 0.40).  
The design of this trial was somewhat restricted due to the fact that the company that produces 
rituximab has only agreed to provide 25 doses to the investigators.  As a consequence, this 
study requires more of a sample size justification (for the sample size fixed by [CONTACT_84042]) 
as opposed to a standard samp le size calculation that determines the required sample size for a 
Rituximab in Myasthenia Gravis  
Version 11.0 
Version date 07/05/[ADDRESS_955319] may be stated as:  
𝐻0,𝐹:𝑝𝑅−𝑝𝑃≥0.30     𝑣𝑠.     𝐻𝐴,𝐹:𝑝𝑅−𝑝𝑃<0.30. 
Therefore, rejecting the null hypothesis suggests ‘futility’ in the sense that it appears unlikely 
that conducting a future phase III clinical trial would lead to a significant effect with a magnitude 
at least as large as the specified clinically meaningful effect of interest.  If we don’t reject the null 
hypothesis, this would provide one of the “go” conditions for conducting a future phase III study.    
The table below shows the power computed across a ra nge of assumed values for the true 
response rate in the rituximab subjects.  The calculations assume a type I error rate of 10%, pP 
= 0.40, and a conservative assumption of up to 20% missing data.  The table below 
demonstrates the benefits of using the fut ility design.  When the true success rate for rituximab 
is near or below the true success rate for placebo, the study will declare “futility” with high 
probability.  Likewise, when the true success rate for rituximab is well above the true success 
rate for  placebo, the study has a very low chance of incorrectly declaring “futility”.  Given the 
sample size limitations mentioned above, we feel that this provides a reasonable chance of 
having a successful study – where “success” is defined as answering the mai n question of 
interest regarding whether there is clear evidence to rule out an effect of rituximab in this

Page 58 of 77 An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disea se temporally associated with a 
study, use of a drug product or device whether or not considered related to the drug product or 
device.  FDA, Office of Human Research Protection (OHRP), and NeuroNEXT CIRB requirements 
for reporting AEs will be followed. Subjects will be monitored for AEs from the time they sign 
consent until the Week [ADDRESS_955321].  The IMM/DSMB will review 
cumulative AEs ; the frequency of this review will be determined by [CONTACT_145858]/DSMB in conjunction 
with the Protocol PI.  
All SAEs must be followe d until resolution, or until the Week [ADDRESS_955322].  If 
the SAE is still ongoing at Week 52, it will be Resolved with Sequelae.   
• SAEs that are discovered less the [ADDRESS_955323] the 
Week 52 Visit . A repeat Termination Visit does not need to occur.  
• If a new SAE is discovered at the Week [ADDRESS_955324].  
• For SAEs that result in study treatment discontinuation and a limited follow -up period , please 
refer to Section 8  – Criteria for Intervention Discontinuation .  
 
At the Week [ADDRESS_955325] visit will also be recorded.  
 
Each Clinical Study Site Investigator and research team (co -Investigators, research nurse, clinical trial 
coordinator) are responsible for identifying and reporting AEs and determining the relationship of the 
event to the study drug/study procedures.  Aggregate reports blinded by [CONTACT_1570], detailed by 
[CONTACT_926], attribution (expected or unexpected), and relationship to  the study drug/study procedures, 
will be available from the DCC for review by [CONTACT_3433] e IMM. A separate report detailing protocol 
compliance will also be available monthly from the DCC for review by [CONTACT_36942] , who will 
provide feedback to individual sites as needed. The Protocol Steering Committee (PSC) will 
advise the Protocol PI [INVESTIGATOR_703490] s

9.5 Statistical Analysi s Plan  
 
9.5.1. Primary Hypotheses  
Primary Futility Hypothesis: Subject s treated with rituximab will have at least a 30% 
absolute increase in  the frequency of achieving at least a 75% reduction in mean daily 
prednisone dose  with maintenance of minimal or no symptoms . 
The primary futility hypothesis being tested in this trial is that subject s treated with rituximab will 
achieve at least an absol ute 30% increase in the frequency of favorable responses.   Assuming a 
placebo response rate of 40% (as in the original sample size calculations), this corresponds to an 
odds ratio of 3.5.  Therefore, the primary futility hypothesis will be assessed using a  logistic 
regression model, adjusted for the two stratification variables, to estimate the log -odds of primary 
endpoint success in each group.  The logistic regression model used for these purposes is stated 
here:  
 
Rituximab in Myasthenia Gravis  
Version 11.0 
Version date 07/05/2017  
Page 59 of 77 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑖𝑡 (𝑌𝑖)= 𝛽0+ 𝛽1𝑋𝑑𝑜𝑠𝑒 + 𝛽2𝑋𝐼𝑆𝑇,𝑖+ 𝛽3𝑋𝑅𝑀𝐵 ,𝑖 
where  
• Yi represents the binary variable indicating whether or not the ith subject met the primary 
outcome requirement of a 75% or greater reduction in prednisone dose   
• Xdose ,i is an indicator variable  for prednisone dose at basel ine (=0 if moderate , =1 if high)  
• XIST,i is an indicator variable for whether the subject was receiving prednisone plus IST at 
baseline (=0 if prednisone alone , =[ADDRESS_955326] )  
• XRMB,i is an indicator variable for whether the ith subject was randomized to the Rituximab  
group  
Correspondingly, the primary futility hypothesis of interest can be assessed by [CONTACT_703534]:  
𝐻0,𝐹:log (𝛽3)≥3.5     𝑣𝑠.     𝐻𝐴,𝐹:log (𝛽3)<3.5. 
Therefore, rejecting the null hypothesis suggests ‘futility’ in the sense that it appears unlikely that 
conducting a future phase III clinical trial would lead to a significant effect with a magnitude at 
least as large  as the specified clinically meaningful effect of interest.  If we don’t reject the null 
hypothesis, this would provide  justification for proceeding to examine the superiority hypothesis .   
Due to randomization, it is unlikely that important covariates wil l be imbalanced in this study.  
However, given the small sample size, this cannot be dismissed.  We will assess for important 
baseline imbalances, and if any imbalances exist, we will adjust for these additional covariates in 
the logistic regression model.  
 
Primary Safety Hypothesis: There will be no increase in adverse experiences for the 
rituximab -treated vs. placebo subject s. 
The second primary hypothesis will involve a comparison of the safety profiles of rituximab vs. 
placebo.  As described elsewhere, general assessments of safety will occur throughout the trial 
in conjunction with the medical safety monitor.  This specific hypothesis will be assessed in two 
ways.  First, the percentage of subjects who experience a study -related AE, overall and by [CONTACT_110377], will be compared across the two groups using standard chi -square tests.  Then, the rates 
of study -related AE’s across the two groups will be compared using a Poisson regression model.  
 
9.5.2. Secondary Hypotheses  
 
Secondary Hypothesis #1: Rituximab -treated subjects will have clinically significant 
improvement in their Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) scores at the end of the [ADDRESS_955327] secondary hypothesis assesses the change in Myasthenia Gravis Composite ( MGC ) 
scores  at the end  of the 52 week study period.  The outcome will be defined as the change from 
baseline to week 52 in the MGC.  This hypothesis will be assessed using a linear regression 
model, adjusted for baseline MGC score.  For example, the following model w ill be fit to these 
data:  
 
𝑌𝑖= 𝛽0+ 𝛽1𝑋𝑑𝑜𝑠𝑒 + 𝛽2𝑋𝐼𝑆𝑇,𝑖+ 𝛽3𝑋𝑀𝐺𝐶 ,𝑖+ 𝛽3𝑋𝑅𝑀𝐵 ,𝑖 
where  
• Yi represents the change from baseline in the MGC score for the ith subject  
• Xdose ,i is an indicator variable  for prednisone dose at baseline ( =0 if moderate , =1 if high)  
Rituximab in Myasthenia Gravis  
Version 11.0 
Version date 07/05/2017  
Page 60 of 77 • XIST,i is an indicator variable for whether the subject was receiving prednisone plus IST at 
baseline (=0 if prednisone alone , =[ADDRESS_955328] )  
• XMGC ,i is the baseline MGC score for the ith subject   
• XRMB,i is an indicator variable for whether the ith subject was randomized to the Rituximab  
group  
Correspondingly, the secondary hypothesis of interest can be assessed by [CONTACT_746] a test of:  
H0: β4 = 0 vs. H A: β4 ≠ 0. 
As above, should important treatment imbalances occur across treatment groups with respect to 
covariates of interest, the model will be adjusted to control for these additional covariates.  
 
Secondary Hypothesis #2: Rituximab -treated subjects will have clinically significant 
improvement in the ir Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) scores at the end of the 52 
week treatment period.  
 
The second secondary hypothesis assesses the change in Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis 
(QMG ) scores over the course of the [ADDRESS_955329] secondary hypothesis.  
 
Secondary Hypothesis #3: Rituximab subje cts will have complete B -cell recovery by [CONTACT_189539] [ADDRESS_955330] secondary hypothesis will assess the rate of B -cell recovery among subjects treated 
with rituximab during the study.   The rate of B -cell recovery will be assesse d by [CONTACT_703535]: 1) return to their individual baseline level of B -cells, and 2) return to 
either the individual baseline level of B -cells or the lower limit of ‘normal’ based on the central 
lab (whichever is lower).   Point estimates, and 95% confidence intervals, will be computed for 
the rate of B -cell recovery at both 72 & [ADDRESS_955331] the upper limit of the 
confidence intervals to include the value 100% - which would support a high rate of B -cell 
recovery in this population.   Any subject who receives open -label rituximab treatment after 
Week 52 would be excluded from this analysis as well as from the extended  follow -up study.  
 
9.5.3. Exploratory Analyses  
  
Additional exploratory clinical outcomes  will be investigated to monitor effectiveness as well as 
evaluate other endpoints that would be useful in optimizing future MG trial designs as well as a 
Phase III rituximab trial.  We will assess whether rituximab can improve the scores on the MG -
Activities of Daily Living (MG -ADL) and MG -Quality of Life (MG -QOL) scales.  We will also 
assess other measures of steroid -sparing effect: 1. Mean daily prednisone dose in the [ADDRESS_955332] s achieving a ≥ 50% mean daily prednisone dose reduction with main tenance of 
minimal or no symptom s in 4 weeks prior to week 52. 4. Mean da ily prednisone dose at each 
scheduled assessment (every 4 weeks). 5. A delayed start of the area under the dose -time 
curve (AUDTC), started at week 8.  Failure of therapy (or MG flare rate) will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_703536]  (PLE X or IVIg) , number of times prednisone dose 
needed to be increased, and the frequency of a ≥ 3 point increase in the MGC score. In addition 
we will review the following predictable steroid related effects between the two groups: 1)

Version date 07/05/2017  
Page 61 of 77 HbA1C  (screening and week 52); 2) BMI (screening, week 24 and week 52).  A formal statistical 
analysis plan for these outcomes will be prepared and approved prior to f inal data lock by [CONTACT_703537].  Finally, we assess B cell recovery/repopul ation as a safety 
measure at the optional observational off study -intervention  time points (weeks 72 and 96)  
along with MG clinical status  during off study -intervention . A formal statistical analysis plan for 
these outcomes will be prepared and approved pr ior to f inal data lock by [CONTACT_703538] . Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS].   
 
9.5.4. Impact of Missing Data  
 
The primary analysis will follow the intent -to-treat (ITT) paradigm.  All enrolled subjects must be 
included in the primary ITT analysis, and will be analyzed in the treatment group to which they 
were initially randomized.  As such, it will be critically i mportant to minimize the occurrence of 
missing data.  Obviously, the optimal strategy for dealing with missing data is to make every effort 
to obtain complete data during the conduct of the study.  Our team of data managers and protocol 
coordinators will w ork diligently and use a variety of methods in order to minimize the percentage 
of missing data in this trial.  Nevertheless, there is likely to be a small percentage of missing data.  
For the primary analysis, we will take a conservative approach.  If the  mean prednisone dose is 
not known during weeks [ADDRESS_955333] achieved a 75% 
dose reduction (i.e., they will be counted as a failure).  In order to further assess the potential 
dependence of the results of the prim ary analysis o f these missing values, a series of sensitivity 
analyses will be conducted, including:  
• A Multiple Imputation Approach: This multiple imputation approach will be implemented 
using a model based on the prednisone dose at baseline and all observ ed time points for 
subjects throughout the study.  We will use five separate im plementations of this 
approach, and will average the parameters across the five imputations for the final 
analysis.  
• Using Only Observed Data (No Imputation)  
• Using a Last Observa tion Carried Forward Approach  
• Worst -case scenario: Assume all missing subjects in the rituximab group did not achieve 
a dose reduction and all missing subjects in the placebo group did achieve a dose 
reduction  
• Best-case scenario: Assume all missing subject s in the rituximab group did achieve a dose 
reduction and all missing subjects in the placebo group did not achieve a dose reduction.

appropriate informed consent. NeuroNEXT CIRB approval for the protocol must be on file at the 
DCC before accru al can occur from the clinical study site.  
 
The DCC will use a system of coded identifiers to protect participant confidentiality.   When the 
participant is registered to participate in the study using the DCC -provided web -based registration, 
the system wil l assign a participant ID number.  The unique ID code will include a protocol ID, a 
site ID, and a unique participant ID.  To confirm the correct participant ID, the data entry system 
will require a second entry of the unique participant ID and compare for consistency.  In this 
fashion, no personal identifiers would be accessible to the DCC and the data will be collected on 
the correctly identified subject.  
10.1.2  Data Entry  
 
Data entry will occur at the enrolling clinical study sites. Data quality assurance and a nalyses will 
be performed by [CONTACT_15791].  The DCC, located at the University of Iowa, will coordinate all data 
and statistical services for the study, as well as on -site monitoring for all participating clinical study 
sites.  
 
Data collection for this study wi ll be accomplished with online electronic case report forms.   Using 
encrypted communication links, online forms will be developed that contain the requisite data 
fields.    
 
10.2 Role of Data Management  
 
Data Management (DM) is the development, execution and supervision of plans, policies, 
programs, and practices that control, protect, deliver, and enhance the value of data and 
information assets.  
 
All data will be managed in compliance with NeuroNEXT policies, and applicable Sponsor and 
regulatory requirement s. The DCC will instruct site personnel to collect, transcribe, correct, and 
transmit the data onto source documents, CRFs, and other forms used to report, track and record 
clinical research data.  The DCC will monitor clinical sites to ensure compliance w ith data 
management requirements and Good Clinical Practices. The DCC is responsible for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
testing, and managing clinical data management activities, as required, at the clinical study sites 
(CSS), the CCC, and at the DCC.  
 
The DCC is responsible  for all aspects of clinical data management, and for properly instructing 
key study personnel (including the CCC, the CSS, and DCC staff) on how to collect, transcribe, 
correct and transmit the data onto CRFs or other data collection forms and logs.

10.3.1  Development of Monitoring Plan  
Onsite monitoring visits will be conducted by [CONTACT_703539] a pre -defined Monitoring 
Plan.  The monitoring plan will detail the frequency of on -site visits, the study data to be monitored, 
the review of any regulatory files, drug and supplies accountability (if applicable), documentation 
of the on -site visit, and the resolution process for data errors that are discovered during the visits.   
All participating clinical study sites will be monitored at least once after a study initiation visit and 
all sites will have a close -out visit for each protocol.  One on -site monitoring visi t is anticipated for 
each clinical study site per year.  All subjects will be monitored for inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
informed consent procedures, and adverse events.  A certain percentage of data is also 
monitored/ source data verified against the  data entered into the study database.  The monitoring 
plan will include flexibility to revise the frequency of visits or data monitored depending on clinical 
study site or study related issues.  
 
 
10.3.2  Site Monitoring Visits  
 
On-site monitoring visits will be c onducted by [CONTACT_703539] a pre -defined monitoring 
plan for each protocol.  The goal of on -site monitoring is to analyze (review) the data as it is 
collected, to check the validity and integrity of the data, to verify source documentation, to e nsure 
protection of human subjects, and to ensure protocol compliance with federal regulations.  During 
the monitoring visit, the monitor assesses the overall status of the study, staff, and facilities to 
determine whether the study is being conducted per protocol and in compliance with regulatory 
requirements.  The monitor also conducts a CRF review that includes checks of all adverse event 
documentation, verifies the presence of all critical correspondence and records related to 
investigational products a nd clinical supplies (if applicable), and determines if protocol violations 
have occurred and are documented properly.  After the monitoring visit, the monitor documents 
the results of the monitoring visit and completes a post -visit monitoring letter that conveys any 
issues discovered during the visit and the need for data corrections, if appropriate.  Drug and 
supplies accountability may also be monitored during the site visit.  The DCC will work closely 
with the CCC to monitor and document drug distributi on from the manufacturers to the clinical 
study sites (CSS).  Each CSS will be provided with a drug accountability log which will be reviewed 
by [CONTACT_703540]. At the study closeout visit, the monitors 
confirm that appropriate data have been reviewed, source documentation has been verified, and 
all required documents are present in the Study Regulatory File.

On-line Adverse Event Reporting System  
 
Upon entry of a serious adverse event by a site investigator, the DCC Online Adverse Event 
Reporting System will immediately notify the Independent Medical Monitor (IMM).   
 
• Within 24 hours  (of learning of the event), investigators must report any Serious Adverse Event 
(SAE) . Investigators must report all other AEs within 5 working days/7 calendar days  (of 
learning of the event).  
 
Serious adverse events : The site investigator determines caus ality (definitely not related, probably 
not related, possibly related, probably related, definitely related) of the adverse event. The IMM 
will review the SAE report.  The IMM may request further information if necessary.  The Online 
Adverse Event Reportin g System maintains audit trails and stores data (and data updated) and 
communication related to any adverse event in the study.  The IMM may determine that the 
Serious Adverse Event requires expedited reporting to the FDA.  The DCC will prepare a 
Medwatch safety report for submission to the FDA  and to Genentech .  If warranted, the IMM will 
notify the DSMB chair.  The DSMB may suggest changes to the protocol or consent form to the 
Study Chair as a consequence of adverse events.  
 
Non-serious adverse events : Non -serious adverse events that are reported to or observed by [CONTACT_92685] a member of his or her research team will be submitted to the DCC in a timely 
fashion (within 5 working days /7 calendar days ). The events will be presented in tabular form  and 
given to the IMM on a quarterly basis or as requested. Local site investigators are also required 
to fulfill all reporting requirements of their local institutions.  
 
For the purposes of this study, before randomization , only those adverse events, seri ous and non -
serious, that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_703493].  After randomization, all adverse events will be reported.  
 
The DCC will prepare aggregate reports of all adverse events (serious/not seri ous, 
expected/unexpected and relationship to study drug) for the IMM  and the  DSMB on a quarterly 
basis or as requested. In addition, all adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA system. A 
separate report detailing protocol compliance will also be avai lable from the DCC for DSMB and /or 
site review monthly or as requested. The research team will then evaluate whether the protocol 
or informed consent document requires revision based on the reports.

10.4.1  Definitions of Adverse Events, Suspected Adverse Drug Reactions & Serious 
Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adve rse Event and Suspected Adverse Drug Reactions  
 
An AE is any  untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered drug related .  
 
Adverse drug reactions (ADR) are all noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product 
related to any dose.  The phrase “responses to a medicinal product” means that a causal 
relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a  reasonable possibility, 
i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out.  Therefore, a subset of AEs can be classified as 
suspected ADRs, if there is a causal relationship to the medicinal product.  
 
Examples of adverse events include: new conditions, worsening  of pre -existing conditions, 
clinically significant abnormal physical examination signs (i.e. skin rash, peripheral edema, etc), 

Rituximab in Myasthenia Gravis  
Version 11.0 
Version date 07/05/[ADDRESS_955342] results (i.e. lab values or vital signs), with the exception of 
outcome measure results , which are not being recorded as adverse events in this trial (they are 
being collected, but analyzed separately). Stable chronic conditions (i.e., diabetes, arthritis) that 
are present prior to the start of the study and do not worsen during the trial ar e NOT considered 
adverse events. Chronic conditions that occur more frequently (for intermittent conditions) or with 
greater severity, would be considered as worsened and therefore would be recorded as adverse 
events.  
 
Adverse events are generally detected  in two ways:  
  
Clinical  symptoms reported by [CONTACT_243075].  
Ancillary Tests  abnormalities of vital signs, laboratory tests, and other diagnostic procedures 
(other than the outcome measures : the results of which are not being captured as AEs).  
 
If discernible at the time of completing the AE log, a specific disease or syndrome rather than 
individual associated signs and symptoms should be identified by [CONTACT_525036].  However, if an obse rved or reported sign, symptom, or clinically 
significant laboratory anomaly is not considered by [CONTACT_246413] a component of a 
specific disease or syndrome, then it should be recorded as a separate AE on the AE log.  
Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities, such as those that require intervention, are those 
that are identified as such by [CONTACT_67505].  
 
An unexpected adverse event is any adverse event, the specificity or severity of which is not 
consistent with the current In vestigators Brochure  or package insert or described in the protocol .  
An unexpected, suspected adverse drug reaction is any unexpected adverse event that, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_246384], there is a reasonable possibility that the invest igational 
product caused the event.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Events  
 
A SAE is defined as an adverse event that meets any of the following criteria:  
 
1. Results in death.  
2. Is life threatening: that is, poses an immediate risk of death as the event occurred.  
a. This serious  criterion applies if the study subject, in the view of the Site Investigator or 
Sponsor, is at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurs .  It does not apply if an 
AE hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
3. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
a. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34096] (including elective PEG tube/g -tube/feeding

medical occurrence.  
4. Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
a. This serious criterion applies if the “disability” caused by [CONTACT_243077] a 
substantial disruption of th e subject’s ability to carry out normal life functions.  
5. Results in congenital anomaly or birth defect in the offspring of the subject (whether the 
subject is male or female).   
6. Necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body 
function or permanent damage to a body structure.

Version 11.0 
Version date 07/05/[ADDRESS_955343] and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the  
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
An inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_243048] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], treatment -emergent, clinical 
adverse event may meet criteria for "seriousness" but is not an adverse  experience, and will 
therefore, not be c onsidered an SAE.  An example of this would include a social admission 
(subject admitted for other reasons than medical, e.g., lives far from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], has no place to 
sleep).  
 
A serious, suspected adverse drug reaction is an SAE that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649] o f the Site Investigator 
or Sponsor, suggests  a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused the event.  
 
The Site Investigator is responsible for classifying adverse events as serious or non -serious.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pregnancy  
 
If a female subject becomes pregnant while receiving investigational therapy or within [ADDRESS_955344] dose of study drug, a report should be completed and expeditiously submitted to 
the Genentech, Inc. Follow -up to obtain the outcome of the pregnancy should also occur. 
Aborti on, whether accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous, should always be classified as 
serious, and expeditiously reported as an SAE. Similarly, any congenital anomaly/birth defect in 
a child born to a female subject exposed to the {study drug} should be repo rted as an SAE.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  AEs of Special Interest (AESIs)  
 
AEs of Special Interest are defined as a potential safety problem, identified as a result of safety 
monitoring of the Product  
  
The Rituxan Events of Special Interest are: NONE  
10.4.2   Assessment and Recording of Adverse Events  
 
This study will utilize the CTCAE version 4.0 coding system for adverse event recording.  Adverse 
events reported using CTCAE will be recoded into MedDRA terms by [CONTACT_15791].  
 
Assessment of Adverse Events  
At each visit (including telephone interviews), the subject will be asked “Have you had any 
problems or symptoms since your last visit?” in order to determine the occurrence of adverse 
events. If the subject reports an adverse event, the Investigator will determine:  
 
1. Type of event  
2. Date of onset and resolution (duration)  
3. Severity (mild, moderate, severe)  
4. Seriousness (does the event meet the above definition for an SAE)  
5. Causality, relation to investigational product and disease  
Rituximab in Myasthenia Gravis  
Version 11.0 
Version date 07/05/[ADDRESS_955345] should be specified by [CONTACT_42737], using the following definitions:  
 
1. Not Related: Concomitant illness, accident or event with no r easonable association with 
treatment.  
2. Unlikely: The reaction has little or no temporal sequence from administration of the 
investigational product, and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists.  
3. Possibly Related: The reaction follows a reasonably tempor al sequence from administration of 
the investigational product and follows a known response pattern to the suspected 
investigational product; the reaction could have been produced by [CONTACT_246415]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_703543]. (suspected ADR)  
4. Probably Related:  The reaction follows a reasonably temporal sequence from administration 
of investigational product; is confirmed by [CONTACT_703544]-challenge; and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s 
clinical state. (suspected ADR)  
5. Definitely Related:  The reaction follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration 
of investigationa l product; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the 
investigational product; and that is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_22020], and reappearance of the reaction on repeated exposure. 
(suspected ADR)  
 
Recording of Adverse Events  
 
All clinical adverse events are recorded in the AE Log in the subject ’s study binder. The site should 
fill out the AE Log and enter the AE information into the online Adverse Event Reporting System 
within 5 working  days /7 calendar days  of the site learning of a new AE or receiving an update on 
an existing AE.   
 
Please Note: SAEs must be reported to the NeuroNEXT Data Coordinating Center within [ADDRESS_955346]. If 
the SAE is still ongoing at Week 52, it will be Resolved with Sequelae.  
• SAEs that are discovered less the [ADDRESS_955347] the 
Week 52 Visit . A repeat Termination Visit does not need to occur.  
• If a new SAE is discovered at the Week [ADDRESS_955348].  
• For SAEs that result in study treatment discontinuation and a limited follow -up period, 
please refer to Section 8 – Criteria for Intervention Discontinuation.

following: name [CONTACT_243085], the date of onset, the date of resolution, relationship to 
investigational product, action taken, and primary outcome of event.  
 
Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events - Reportable Events  
 
The following are considered reportable events and must be reported to the NeuroNEXT Data  
Coordinati ng Center within 24 hours of the site being notified of the event.  
 
• All events that meet the above criteria for Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
 
All occurrences of SAEs must be reported within [ADDRESS_955349] be reported within  5 working days/7 calendar days of discovery of the event.  
 
Adverse Event Data Management System (AEDAMS)  
 
Upon entry of a serious ad verse event by a clinical site, the DCC Online Adverse Event Reporting 
System will immediately notify the IMM. If warranted, the IMM will notify the DSMB chair.  
 
Serious adverse events : The site investigator determines causality (definitely not related, p robably 
not related, possibly related, probably related, definitely related) of the adverse event. The IMM 
will review the SAE report.  The IMM may request further information if necessary.  The DSMB 
may suggest changes to the protocol or consent form to t he Project PI [INVESTIGATOR_17174] a consequence of 
adverse events. The Online Adverse Event Reporting System maintains audit trails and stores 
data (and data updated) and communication related to any adverse event in the study.  
 
Non-serious adverse events : Non -serious adv erse events that are reported to or observed by [CONTACT_92685] a member of his research team will be submitted to the DCC within 5 working 
days /7 calendar days . The events will be presented in tabular form and given to the IMM on a 
monthly basis or as  requested. Local site investigators are also required to fulfill all reporting 
requirements of their local institutions.  
 
The DCC will prepare aggregate reports of all adverse events (serious/not serious and expected, 
unexpected) for the DSMB.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reconciliation  
 
The Sponsor agrees to conduct reconciliation for the product. Genentech and the Sponsor will 
agree to the reconciliation periodicity and format, but agree at minimum to exchange monthly

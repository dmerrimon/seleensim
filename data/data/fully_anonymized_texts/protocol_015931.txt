Abstract
Of the man y f
actors contributing to the obesity epi[INVESTIGATOR_901], the timing of food consumption is now 
recognized as a significant contributor to body weight regulation. Disruption of the normal timing of 
feeding in mice has been found to promote weight gain, alter serum leptin levels, and induce 
hypothalamic leptin resistance. Delays in daytime eating have also been found to increase the risk of 
obesity and metabolic syndrome in humans. Disrupting normally-timed sleep-wake cycles produces 
major effects on body weight, adiposity, and metabolism, but it remains unclear whether meal timing 
independently plays a causal role in metabolic dysregulation when sleep-wake cycles are unaltered. The 
purpose of this study is to determine if, controlling for eating and sleep timing, caloric intake, and 
exercise, daytime vs. delayed eating affects body mass, adiposity, and energy metabolism in healthy 
adults.
Objectives
Overall objectives
To determine 
if timing of food consumption (daytime vs. delayed eating) affects body mass, adiposity, 
and energy metabolism by [CONTACT_79323] 30 healthy men and women in a randomized cross-over design 
study.
Primary outcome variable(s)
To determine 
if timing of food consumption (daytime vs. delayed eating) affects body mass (kg) after a 
period of two months.
Secondary outcome variable(s)
Our secondary outcomes will be assessed before and after each eating condition for a total of four 
assessment periods. Blood samples will be taken e
very four hours for 24 hours in the CTRC during 
each assessment. Metabolic testing and DEXA will occur once at each of the four assessment periods.  
Specific secondary outcomes include: Amplitude and phase of circadian rhythms of leptin, cortisol, and 
melatonin; Fasting levels of glucose, insulin, adiponectin, cholesterol, triglycerides, and non-esterified 
fatty acids; Energy expenditure and fuel oxidation as measured by [CONTACT_46146]; and Body 
composition measured using DEXA
Background
Obesity affects one-third 
of the general population and is related to many serious medical 
comorbidities, including diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and obstructive sleep apnea. Behavioral weight 
loss approaches are effective at helpi[INVESTIGATOR_204996] 5-10% of their initial body weight , 
but prevention of obesity remains a primary public health goal, along with identifying behavioral 
strategies to optimize weight loss and maintenance. Of the many factors contributing to the obesity 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_901], the timing of food consumption is now recognized as a significant contributor to body weight 
regulation.  The underlying mechanisms governing the circadian rhythms of fundamental animal 
Page 8 of 20processes such as sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_204997], are well characterized. The circadian system enables organisms 
to synchronize behaviors, metabolism, 
and physiological processes to sleep-wake cycles. The core 
clock mechanism is based on a feedback loop involving the transcription factors BMAL1, CLOCK, and 
NPAS and their targets. In mammals, circadian rhythms are organized hierarchically with the 
hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) controlling a network of central and peripheral clocks. 
The SCN responds mainly to light and synchronizes behavioral and physiological rhythms via circadian 
oscillations in extra-SCN brain circuits and peripheral tissues. When food is abundant and animals are 
kept under normal light-dark (LD) cycles, photoperiod is the primary zeitgeber (time-giver) for the 
master clock in the SCN, and produces a near-[ADDRESS_244685] 
been studied more carefully in rodents compared to humans. Deletion of canonical clock genes in mice 
alters feeding behavior, food intake, and adiposity. Macronutrients (i.e. glucose, fatty acids, and amino 
acids) and nutrient-sensing molecules (e.g., AMPK, SIRT1, mTOR, and CRTC2) entrain central and 
peripheral clocks, changing the timing and amplitude of gene expression rhythms and metabolic 
pathways. Co-I Ahima and colleagues found that restriction of ad libitum feeding to light in mice 
resulted in a parallel phase-shifting of circadian rhythms of several hormones, such that the nadir of 
insulin and leptin occurred prior to feeding and peaked after feeding, while corticosterone peaked 
before feeding and declined afterwards. Food restriction in rodents housed in normal LD cycles 
triggered food anticipatory activity and increased bouts of wakefulness and food-seeking behavior. 
Notably, mice restricted to light feeding developed obesity. In contrast, mice restricted to 8 h of feeding 
during the dark cycle were protected from obesity, inflammation, diabetes, and liver disease. Paschos et 
al. showed that deletion of Arntl (BMAL) in the adipose tissue of mice produces circadian clock 
dysfunction in adipocytes causing a shift in the diurnal rhythm of food intake, obesity, and increased 
stored fat without a change in total locomotor activity or caloric intake. Further, Fonken et al. exposed 
mice during the dark phase to either dim light (approximating human artificial light exposure at night) 
or daytime light; both types of exposure produced a significant increase in light phase intake, weight 
gain, fat storage, and impaired glucose tolerance compared to mice exposed to normal LD patterns.  
Ahimas lab compared the metabolic profiles of mice housed in normal LD cycles restricted to ad 
libitum feeding during the light cycle (unpub. data). Twelve week-old male C57BL/6J mice were 
housed singly in 12-h light:12-h dark cycles, and fed normal (low fat) chow diet ad libitum (LD-Fed), 
or restricted to ad libitum feeding during the light phase (L-Fed). Food intake was lower in L-Fed than 
LD-Fed for 2d, increased above LD-Fed levels for 5d, and was similar to LD-Fed thereafter. However, 
the L-Fed mice developed excess adiposity after [ADDRESS_244686] 15 million Americans work full time on evening shifts, night shifts, or 
rotating shifts, which relates to a higher prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular morbidity. 
Circadian misalignment accompanying shift work decreases insulin sensitivity, alters the circadian 
rhythms of leptin, cortisol and glucose, and may cause high blood pressure. Short sleep duration and/or 
sleep deprivation are also associated with diabetes, increased appetite and caloric intake, weight gain, 
and obesity. In a large experimental study, Co-I Goel and colleagues found sleep deprivation promoted 
weight gain compared to a control (normal sleep) condition and increased caloric intake, particularly 
during late-night hours. Delayed sleep timing is also related to poorer diet and later eating times, the 
latter of which relates to higher BMI. Gluck et al. showed that subjects who ate at night (between 
2300h0500h) during an inpatient study had a higher 24h respi[INVESTIGATOR_38952], higher rates of 
Page 9 of 20carbohydrate oxidation, and lower rates of fat oxidation, suggesting a phenotype associated with 
increased energy intak
e and weight. Shift work and many sleep disorders alter the circadian rhythms of 
leptin, adiponectin, resistin, insulin resistance, diabetes, dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], and cardiovascular morbidity. 
Although these findings indicate that disrupting normally-timed sleep-wake cycles produces major 
effects on body weight, adiposity, and metabolism, it is unclear whether meal timing independently 
plays a causal role in metabolic dysregulation when sleep-wake cycles are unaltered.  The human 
phenotype of a delayed pattern of eating, such as that described in the animal studies above, is 
consistent with NES. NES is defined by [CONTACT_205016], evening hyperphagia (consumption of 25% 
of daily caloric intake after dinner) and nocturnal ingestions 2/wk. The prevalence of NES is estimated 
at 1.5-6% of community samples and is positively related to BMI in epi[INVESTIGATOR_204998]. While we have shown that sleep efficiency is reduced in NES, sleep onset and offset is similar 
to control participants in outpatient and inpatient settings, even with increased caloric intake. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_204999] a delayed sleep period, we previously reported that persons with NES showed attenuated 
circadian rhythms for food intake, cortisol, ghrelin, and insulin, but increased TSH amplitude during a 
24h blood draw with ad libitum access to food. Those with NES also showed phase delays of food 
intake, leptin, cortisol, insulin, and melatonin, with a phase inversion of glucose and a phase advance in 
ghrelin. Thus, results from various populations and methodologies strongly suggest that nighttime 
eating may contribute to weight gain, or, at a minimum, maintenance of higher weight. Further, just as 
in animal studies, nighttime eating may exacerbate medical conditions in humans, such as diabetes 
mellitus. Indeed, diabetic patients with nighttime eating are more likely to have HbA1c values [ADDRESS_244687] of 
delayed eating on weight and energy metabolism, independent of interrupted or phase-shifted sleep or 
psychiatric distress (i.e., in NES).  Descriptive clinical studies of non-eating-disordered adults found 
that breakfast intake was negatively related to total daily caloric intake, while the proportion of food 
consumed late at night was positively related to total intake. A recent observational study of 420 
Spaniards seeking weight loss with a standardized Mediterranean diet found that late eaters (those 
eating the midday meal after 1500h), compared to early eaters (eating the midday meal before 1500h), 
lost significantly less weight (7.7 kg vs. 9.9 kg, respectively) during the [ADDRESS_244688] of 
nighttime eating on weight using a randomized cross-over design. Qin et al. assessed 7 students 
assigned to typi[INVESTIGATOR_205000]. delayed eating schedules for 3 wks in each condition. After the delayed 
condition, the peaks of melatonin and leptin were attenuated, glucose increases were maintained across 
the early morning hours, and insulin secretion decreased, suggesting an impaired insulin response to 
glucose. In the second study, 11 women ate either a morning (1000h) or evening (2300h) snack in 
addition to their 3 meals, which they were instructed to eat at their usual times, for 13d periods. The 
evening, as compared to the daytime, snack condition decreased fat oxidation and increased total and 
LDL cholesterol, but glucose and insulin levels did not differ, suggesting that eating at night changes fat 
metabolism. Finally, LeCheminant et al. examined 27 males who were prohibited from eating between 
1900h-0600h for 2 wk, or ate as per their usual schedule for 2 wk, with a 1 wk intervening washout 
period. They consumed 2420 kcals in the restricted vs. 2664 kcals in the usual eating condition (with 
700 kcals consumed after 1900h). Weight change was -0.04 kg for the restricted condition and +0.06 kg 
for usual eating (p0.001). Thus, the short-term evening food restriction resulted in a small but likely 
clinically relevant caloric reduction. It is unknown if these intake differences would continue over time. 
Notably, in contrast to the current proposal, none of these studies controlled for, or carefully monitored, 
calorie levels, macronutrient content, activity levels, or timing of sleep-wake cycles.
Study Design
Phase*
Not applicable
Design
This is a 5-month, randomized, cross-ov er 
design study. Upon completion of screening and baseline 
assessments, participants will be assigned to the first eating condition for 2 months. They will complete 
an assessment, followed by a 2-week washout period and an additional assessment visit. Participants 
will then be assigned to the second eating condition for 2 months. Upon completion of the second 
eating condition, participants will complete the 4th and final assessment. 30 healthy participants with 
access to a personal smartphone, tablet, or other electronic devices will be recruited over a one-year 
Page 10 of 20period.
Study duration
The estimated duration of the study is 2 years. It will take ~12 
months to recruit 30 participants. Each 
participant will be engaged in study procedures for ~5 months (2 weeks of screening/baseline 
assessments, [ADDRESS_244689] eating condition, 2 week wash-out period, 2 months in second eating 
condition). Recruitment will likely begin in July, 2014.

Describe research staff and 
justify that the staff are adequate in number and qualifications to conduct 
the research. Describe how you will ensure that all staff assisting with the research are adequately 
informed about the protocol and their research related duties. Please allow adequate time for the 
researchers to conduct and complete the research. Please confirm that there are adequate facilities for 
the research.
Kelly Allison, PhD, the Principal investigator, will be responsible for the overall conduct of this 
research. Along with [CONTACT_112362], co-investigators Namni Goel, PhD, an expert in circadian rhythms and 
Rexford Ahima, MD, PhD, an endocrinologist who will serve as medical director. Michael Rickels, 
MD, will serve as admitting physician for the study. Additional staff available include the research 
coordinator (Madelyn Ruggieri) who will be responsible for recruitment, initial screening, study 
logistics, and delivery of food; Nasreen Alfaris, MD, MPH, Co-Medical Director at CWED will be 
available for any medical issues that arise and reviewing DXA scans.  CTRC services will also be 
involved, including Lisa Basel-Brown at the metabolic kitchen and nursing staff for support of the [ADDRESS_244690]. Goel's 
resources in Experimental Psychiatry. Andrea Spaeth will perform the metabolic testing, as she has in 
previous studies.  Our offices at the Center for Weight and Eating Disorders are adequate for 
recruitment and screening of the participants.  We will also use the CTRC at Presby[CONTACT_24021][INVESTIGATOR_307]. It 
houses a DEXA machine that will be used at each of the pre-post eating condition assessments.  We wil 
recruit our [ADDRESS_244691] Philadelphia community so they are in close 
proximity to receive the food that we will supply. These will be healthy controls with a BMI of 19 - 30 
kg/m2. We believe that this goal is feasible within the two-year research window. The PI (a clinical 
psychologist) or co-I Ahima (a physician) will be able to refer the participants to appropriate medical or 
psychological services as needed.

to undergo a history and physical at the CTRC and, subsequently, their baseline assessment and 
randomization. After the 28-h baseline assessment, participants will be randomized to begin the study 
with either the daytime or delayed eating condition, and they will receive their first 3d of food. The 
participants will also receive food, sleep, and exercise logs and actigraphs, which they will use for the 
studys duration. Assessments will be conducted at four points:1) baseline; 2) after completion of 
condition 1; 3) after the 2 wk wash-out period; and 4) after completion of condition 2 . Each assessment 
will include 28h at the Clinical and Translational Research Center (CTRC) where participants will eat 
according to their typi[INVESTIGATOR_205004] (for points 1 and 3) or their assigned schedule - daytime or delayed 
(for points 2 and 4). 10mL (2 teaspoonfuls) of blood will be drawn at 4h intervals (0800h, 1200h, 
1600h, 2000h, 2400h, and 0400h) to measure amplitude and phase of circadian rhythms of leptin, 
cortisol, and melatonin. Fasting levels of glucose, insulin, adiponectin, cholesterol, triglycerides, and 
non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) will be measured at the beginning of each assessment session. All 
blood assays will be performed by [CONTACT_205021], Ph.D. and her staff at the RIA Core Lab of the Penn 
Diabetes Center. Energy expenditure measurement: On the morning after blood draws and an overnight 
fast, indirect calorimetry will be used to assess energy expenditure and fuel oxidation (respi[INVESTIGATOR_205005]). One technique for assessing energy expenditure involves measuring a proxy of heat loss 
using indirect calorimetry. The body's energy production is dependent on oxygen (O2) and each liter of 
O2 consumed by [CONTACT_205022] ~5 kcal; therefore, O2 consumption (VO2) provides an 
accurate indirect way of measuring a persons energy expenditure (Leonard, 2012). In addition to VO2, 
the respi[INVESTIGATOR_38952] (the ratio of CO2 production (VCO2) to VO2), can be measured. Because the 
caloric equivalent for each liter of O2 consumed varies as a function of respi[INVESTIGATOR_38952], both 
measurements are required to calculate resting metabolic rate. Diet induced thermogenesis represents 
the increase in energy expenditure above resting metabolic rate divided by [CONTACT_205023] a percentage. In this study, a Parvo Medics True One [ADDRESS_244694], 
integrated metabolic measurement system which contains O2 and CO2 analyzers, a device for 
measuring breathing (ventilation) rates, a gas sampling system, and a computer interface that allows for 
the transfer of raw data. A canopy/hood interface is used to collect air samples. This metabolic monitor 
has been widely used in clinical and experimental settings and has been validated (Bassett et al., 2001; 
Cooper et al., 2009). The metabolic monitor will assess indirect calorimetry for each subject a total of 4 
times (once during each inpatient assessment). During each of the four assessments, subjects resting 
metabolic rate will be assessed the morning after continuous blood draws with each measurement 
lasting 45 minutes (10-15 minute adaptation period, followed by 30 minutes of testing). During the 
Page [ADDRESS_244695] lays supi[INVESTIGATOR_205006]/her head under a plastic canopy which collects the 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_205007]. Resting metabolic rate will be 
measured after a [ADDRESS_244696] calorimetry are 
routinely conducted (and have IRB approval) for our experimental sleep studies (under Co-I [CONTACT_205048]'s 
leadership). Body composition will then be measured using DEXA at the Presby[CONTACT_24021][INVESTIGATOR_205008] (i.e., our study's medical director, Co-I [CONTACT_205047], or Drs. 
Rickels or Alfaris. The scans will take approximately [ADDRESS_244697] and provide new actigraphs (1/wk). Personalized menus will accompany the meals and 
participants will check off each food item they consume and note any modifications to their meals and 
snacks. The CTRC staff will provide portion size training at baseline, and all participants will receive 
measuring cups. Participants will purchase their own beverages and record them on the menus. Mean 
beverage intake, as reported at baseline, will be factored into each participant's total daily caloric and 
macronutrient totals. CTRC staff will provide a diet consisting of approximately 55% carbohydrate, 
15% protein, and 30% fat with an isocaloric energy level. These parameters will remain constant across 
conditions. Staff will send daily queries by [CONTACT_205024] e-mail to monitor adherence to the eating, sleep, and 
exercise parameters (Appendix B) and intervene the same day if participants report consuming less than 
80% (4/5) of the provided meals and snacks, eating or sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_205009], 
or exercising more than prescribed. Staff will also download actigraphy data and collect the logs 
weekly, to monitor compliance.  If participants are unable to consume a meal or snack as provided, they 
will send a pi[INVESTIGATOR_205010], including a reference object, i.e., a 
card of known dimensions provided by [CONTACT_205025]. This 
template-based approach has been used to develop more sophisticated mobile applications for food 
intake assessment. All uneaten food will be saved and returned to the metabolic kitchen when staff 
delivers new food. If it is not possible to save leftover food, participants will take a pi[INVESTIGATOR_205011]. Kitchen staff will pre-weigh all provided items and post-
weigh any non-eaten items and compute macronutrient and caloric counts for participants daily intake 
using the Nutrition Data System for Research (NDSR). [Note: participants will be provided a master 
meal and snack menu from which they can pi[INVESTIGATOR_205012]. If participants do not 
like certain foods, they can alter their selections. Regular contact [CONTACT_205026]. We plan to offset the high study burden 
by [CONTACT_205027], providing them with all meals and snacks for 
a total of 4 mo at an estimated value of $1000, and compensating them $300 for each of 4 CTRC 
assessments, with a $300 bonus at study completion ($1500 total, paid by [CONTACT_9434]).  After the first 
condition (2 mo), participants will complete assessment 2. They will eat according to their usual 
(baseline) dietary pattern for two weeks, which serves as a wash-out period from the first assigned 
eating condition. Participants will then complete assessment 3, immediately followed by [CONTACT_205028], followed by [INVESTIGATOR_13699] 4. All assessments follow the same protocol. 
Following completion of the fourth assessment, participants will complete a brief survey regarding their 
perceived adherance to study protocol and explain what they would have changed to make the study 
easier to adhere to. Appendix A shows the study timeline. Appendix B shows the text/email questions 
we will use to assess adherence each day. Appendix C shows a sample menu that will be used for 
participants to identify their food preferences.

Written Statement of Research (phonescript.docx)
Risk / Benefit
Potential Study Risks
The risk to participants in this trial ha ve 
been carefully considered and minimized to the extent possible. 
Every effort has been made to provide a study in which the safety of the research participants is 
protected. During this study participants will be asked personal questions such as their weight, age, 
eating habits, and mood. During the outpatient phase participants will experience the inconvenience of 
wearing actigraphs and keepi[INVESTIGATOR_205014], sleep, mood, and physical activity, all of 
which pose minimal risk. The interviews and paper-and-pencil assessments present little risk to 
participants beyond those experienced in daily life.  Blood draws. During the inpatient assessments, 
participants will experience the discomfort of the initial venapuncture and blood withdrawal system and 
the possibility of small bruises at the site of the needle, dizziness, or fainting shortly after having blood 
drawn. Local clots may form, and infections may occur, but these are rare.  DEXA. This research study 
involves exposure to radiation from the DEXA scans and therefore participants will receive a radiation 
dose. The radiation exposure from a whole body DEXA scan is 0.[ADDRESS_244701] 10 hours (overnight), which may be uncomfortable.  If 
unforeseen risks are seen, they will be reported to the Office of Research Integrity and Compliance. If 
any events occur that might be related to the study, the participant will be instructed to bring them to the 
attention of their personal physician, as well as study staff.
Potential Study Benefits
There may be no direct benefit to subjects as a result of participation in the study. P
articipants may 
increase their knowledge of their eating and sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_610]. Participation will contribute important 
data for the field of weight management, which may benefit persons more broadly .
Alternatives to Participation (optional)
The only alternative to participation is to choose not to participate in this study.
Data and Safety Monitoring
Safety 
and tolerability will be assessed throughout the study by [CONTACT_205032], 
questionnaires, and clinical laboratory measures. All safety information will be collected and processed 
promptly, to comply with regulatory requirements designed to protect study participants. University 
guidelines regarding the reporting of adverse events will be followed as documented in the detailed 
study protocol. The investigators, study coordinators, and research assistants will monitor this study. 
Adverse events will be reported to the IRB at regular intervals. Protections Against Risk (from the 
Human Subjects section of the R21 application): i. Compliance statement. This study will be conducted 
in full accordance of all applicable University of Pennsylvania Research Policies and Procedures and all 
applicable Federal and State laws and regulations including 45 CFR 46, 21 CFR Parts 50, 54, 56, 312, 
Page 18 of [ZIP_CODE], and 812, and the Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guideline approved by [CONTACT_121026] (ICH). Any 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_23457]. The 
investigators will perform the study in accordance with this protocol, will obtain consent and assent, 
and will report all study related adverse events, unanticipated problems, and deviations from the 
protocol in accordance with University of Pennsylvania-Childrens Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684]-Center IRB 
Policies and Procedures and all federal requirements. Collection, recording, and reporting of data will 
be accurate and will ensure the privacy, health, and welfare of research participants during and after the 
study.   ii. General conduct of research. Experienced staff will collect all blood samples, DEXA data, 
and indirect calorimetry data. Experienced personnel will administer the questionnaires and collect all 
other data related to disordered eating, sleep, mood, and adherence to the study procedures, including 
the daily text/e-mail queries.  iii. Medical monitoring. Patients will be monitored by [CONTACT_464]. 
Medical personnel, [CONTACT_205047] and the CTRC research nursing staff, will be charged with approving 
participants at study baseline and will be consulted in the case of any medical issues that arise during 
the study. Adverse events will be documented on template forms from the Office of Human Research 
indicating the nature of the event, the likelihood that it was study related, and if it were an expected or 
unexpected event. Adverse events will be summarized and documented in the yearly continuing review 
report to the IRB.  Serious adverse events that occur will be reported to the IRB within [ADDRESS_244702] effects on ones weight and metabolism that could be beneficial for weight gain prevention, and/or 
weight loss efforts. Such an intervention strategy could be widely distributed to help promote weight 
management and prevention or management of weight-related comorbidities. Thus, the risks to subjects 
are reasonable considering the importance of the knowledge that reasonably may be expected to result 
from this study. 6.5. Data and Safety Monitoring Plan General Description. We will provide the 
following safety and monitoring procedures, in accordance with the policy of the NIH that all 
investigative sites provide a plan regarding monitoring and oversight of the conduct of the clinical trial 
to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. Data and safety monitoring 
will be performed in accordance with all local IRB, NIH, and other applicable federal regulatory 
guidelines. Research and treatment procedures will also be conducted in accordance with the Principles 
of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines. Standard University of Pennsylvania procedures and 
infrastructure for data and safety monitoring will be utilized. These procedures are described below.  a. 
Who will be responsible for monitoring? The Principal Investigator, [CONTACT_112362], and Co-Investigators, 
Drs. Ahima and Goel, in conjunction with the study coordinator, will be responsible for overseeing and 
completing the monitoring process. Participants will have 24-hr access to emergency medical personnel 
through emergency services at Penn Medicine.  b. How will monitoring be performed? All protocols 
and consent forms belonging to this project will be fully approved by [CONTACT_168756]. During the course of the study, safety and data quality monitoring will be performed on 
an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_205033]. The research coordinator is 
responsible for collecting and recording all clinical data. This includes ensuring that all source 
documents exist for the data on the case report forms, ensuring all fields are completed appropriately, 
and all corrections are entered according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines. Any 
inconsistencies/deviations will be documented. c. Study initiation. [CONTACT_112362] will be responsible for 
assuring that all staff and participants understand and accept: the obligations incurred in undertaking 
this study; the obligation to obtain informed consent; the obligation to obtain IRB review and approval 
of a clinical investigation before the investigation may be initiated and to ensure continuing review of 
Page 19 of 20the study by [CONTACT_1201]; and the obligation to keep the sponsor informed of such IRB approval and 
subsequent IRB actions concerning the study. d. 
Ongoing monitoring meetings. Monitoring will be 
conducted in accordance with the University of Pennsylvania Sponsor-Investigator Standard Operating 
Procedure. Enrollment will be complete when 30 participants meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria 
have been screened, participated in informed consent, and [ADDRESS_244703] participant is enrolled. Subsequent monitoring will 
occur at weekly study meetings of study investigators and staff. Specific items to be reviewed at these 
meeting include: 1. Accrual and retention 2. Protocol compliance 3. Adverse or unexpected events 4. 
Other participant issues 5. Regulatory issues The research coordinator will file all meeting agendas and 
reports in the study regulatory binder that will be reviewed regularly by [CONTACT_205034]. e. Assessing adverse events. Monitoring for Adverse Events (AE) will be 
conducted in real-time by [CONTACT_205035]. Drs. Allison, 
Ahima, and Goel will determine the severity of the adverse events related to study participation, as well 
as the appropriate course of action for the study participant. Participants will also be instructed to 
contact [CONTACT_205036]. After 
removing identifying patient health information, any serious unexpected or adverse events will be 
reported to the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board within 72 hours. Serious adverse 
events (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) will be brought to the attention of the Investigators and study physician 
within 24 hours and to the attention of the IRB and NIH within 72 hrs, as required. All adverse and 
unexpected events will be recorded, and a summary table will be reviewed by [CONTACT_44251]. f. Data, 
safety and monitoring report. The PIs will provide a summary of the data safety and monitoring (DSM) 
report to NIH on an annual basis, as part of the progress report. The DSM report will include the 
participants, sociodemographic characteristics, expected versus actual recruitment rates, retention rates, 
any quality assurance or regulatory issues that occurred during the past year, summaries of AEs and 
SAEs, and any actions or changes with respect to the protocol. The DSM report to NIH will also 
include, if applicable, the results of any hypothesis-testing data analysis conducted. g. Regulatory 
Approval. We will obtain regulatory approval through the University of Pennsylvanias biomedical IRB 
before initiating the trial.  h. Evidence of training in human subject research. All research personnel 
associated with this study will have completed the University of Pennsylvanias Collaborative 
Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) for patient-oriented research, as well as HIPAA Compliance 
Training. Documentation of this training will be retained in the study regulatory binder.

1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
 
1.1 Glioblastoma Multiforme  
 
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and lethal malignant brain tumor1.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_396788], median survival is < 15 months, and < 5% of patients survive > [ADDRESS_499097] shown 
anti-growth acti vity in vitro .  This high failure rate is likely due to the redundancy in key 
growth pathways and the molecular and cellular heterogeneity within each tumor.  Anothe r 
explanation is the poor CNS penetration of these drugs due to the blood brain barrier (BBB).  As a result, high drug doses were used to achieve therapeutic drug concentrations in the CNS, resulting in significant toxicities
4.  Thus an outstanding challenge in neuro-
oncology has been to generate drugs that have excellent CNS penetration or methods that can compromise the BBB to enhance drug delivery. 
 
1.2 MRI -guided Laser Ablation (MLA)  
 
MRI -guided laser ablation (MLA) therapy for GBM is a novel minimally invasive surgery 
approved for cytoreductive treatment of brain tumors
5.  [CONTACT_396845] 
and [CONTACT_396846] performed one of the first MLA procedures in the country and are experts in this 
technique.  Currently Washington 
University has one of the largest clinical experiences using this new technology (Monteris, Winnipeg, CA), which has received FDA  
clearance for “use to ablate, necrotize, 
or coagulate soft tissue through interstitial irradiation or thermal therapy (LITT) in medicine and surgery in the discipline of neurosurgery with 1064 nm lasers,” and is marketed under the brand name 
[CONTACT_396843].  MLA employs a small incision in the scalp and skull, through which a t hin laser probe is inserted 
and guided by [CONTACT_396819] a tumor mass where it delivers hyperthermic ablation from the core to the rim.   The temperature at the 
core can reach 70°C, resulting in coagulative necrosis  (Fig. 1) .  The 

Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 10 of 70 temperature decrease in the peritumoral region but remains high enough (> 40°C) to induce 
disruption of the BBB as evidenced by [CONTACT_396820], while the original tumor enhancement is lost due to the heat ablation  (Figs. 1 and 2).   
 
General characteristics that 
make the lesion(s) favorable 
to treatment include the 
follo wing: (1) the lesion(s) is 
(are) supratentorial and 
accessible from a cephalad 
approach (i.e., top one third of 
the head), (2) the lesion(s) is 
(are) unilateral, (3) the 
lesion(s)  is (are) relatively 
well circumscribed, (4) the 
volume of lesion(s) can be 
encompassed by [CONTACT_1192] 3- cm 
cylinders (i .e., 2 treatment 
trajectories), (5) a safe 
trajectory c an be established 
relative to functional structures (i.e., eloquent cortex and corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_88735]), and (6) the 
patient ’s body habitus c an fit into the bore of the MRI. Trajectories are chosen to maximize 
lesion ablation and minimize the number of passes.  MLA will be performed per FDA 
clearance for the NeuroBlate device using 1064n m lasers (for a detailed description of the 
procedure, please refer to these references5-8).  Live intra -procedural treatment monitoring 
is critical for stereotactic LITT in order to assess for real -time tissue temperature and avoid 
treatment beyond the target zone. Fortunately, recent technological advances in intraoperative MR imaging when coupled with the NeuroBlate apparatus now enable accurate intraoperative thermal monitoring that is necessary for successful and safe ablation of intracranial lesions. Intra -procedural repetitive measurements of a T1 -weighted 
2-dimensional- FLASH sequence, or sim ilar methods, provide temporally- sensitive 
thermometry measurements necessary to create controlled and conformal lesions (Fig. 1 C).   
 The disrupted BBB may also allow release of tumor antigens into the circulation and influx of immune cells into the peritumoral region.  In a series of patients treated with MLA at our institution, peritumor enhancement modestly increased [ADDRESS_499098] of the BBB disruption after MLA could be the activation of an immune reaction leading to infiltration of tumor- specific lymphocytes 
and the resultant delayed inflammatory reaction.  

Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/[ADDRESS_499099] experienced transient aphasia, transient hemiparesis, transient hyponatremia, and a documented case of lower extremity deep venous thrombosis. Patients with aphasia or hemiparesis impr oved over time with steroid therapy. Hyponatremia resolved 
spontaneously. One patient experienced fatal meningitis. Subsequent in-depth analysis revealed that this patient’s meningitis was due to an operating room infrastructure -related contamination and not due to equipment contamination 
related to performance of the MLA procedure.  
 
1.3 Immune Dysregulation  
 
Recent work has collectively demonstrated striking immune dysregulation in patients with GBM, including T cell lymphopenia and anergy, cytokine dysregulation, increased regulatory T cell (Treg) populations, and NK cell dysfunction, among others, which reflect immunologic compromise and functional impairment
9-12.  However, a growing list of 
potential tumor antigens has been identified, suggesting that tumor cell -specific 
recognition by [CONTACT_396821]11,13.  Therefore, given the immune dysfunction characterized in GBM patients, 
approaches that potentiat e the anti -glioma immune response are particularly exciting.  A 
priori, because the immune system has evolved to recognize a tremendous diversity of antigenic epi[INVESTIGATOR_396789], immune -potentiating efforts may be especially effective 
at targeting the  heterogeneity that defines GBM.  Recently, the success of antibody -based 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_396790]
14,[ADDRESS_499100] across many cancer types, including GBM.  Of these agents, those targeting the negative regulator proteins CTLA -4 and PD -1/PD -L1 have 
shown clinical efficacy but have not been studied in GBM patients.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_499101] immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic transformation has been known for decades
16.  Accumulating evidence shows a correlation 
between tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in 
various malignancies17-21 .  In particular, the presence of CD8+ T -cells an d the ratio of 
CD8+ effector T -cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells seems to correlate with improved 
prognosis and long-term survival in many solid tumors.  The PD -[ADDRESS_499102] hijacked by [CONTACT_55548].  The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated 
T-cells under healthy conditions, is to down- modulate unwanted or excessive immune 
responses, including autoimmune reactions.  PD -1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an Ig 
superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA -4 which has been shown to negatively 
regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or 
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 12 of 70 PD-L2)22,23.  The structure of murine PD -1 has been resolved24.  PD -1 and family members 
are type  I transmembrane glyco proteins containing an Ig Variable -type (V -type) domain 
responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is responsible for the binding 
of signaling molecules.  The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 tyrosine -based signali ng 
motifs, an immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor 
tyrosine -based switch motif (ITSM).  Following T -cell stimulation, PD -[ADDRESS_499103] from that of CTLA -4 as 
both molecules regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_77971]28,29.  PD -1 was shown to 
be expressed on activated lymphocytes including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells, B -
cells, T regs and Natural Killer cells30,31 .  Expression has also been shown during thymic 
development on CD4- CD8 - (double negative) T -cells as well as subsets of macrophages 
and dendritic cells  32 .  The ligands for PD -1 (PD -L1 and PD -L2) are constitutively 
expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types, including non- hematopoietic tissues 
as well as in various tumors 28,33-[ADDRESS_499104] notably on vascular endothelium, 
whereas PD -L2 protein is only detectably expressed on antigen- presenting cells found in 
lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments.  PD -L2 is thought to control 
immune T -cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD -L1 serves to dampen 
unwarranted T -cell function in peripheral tissues 28.  Although healthy organs express little 
(if any) PD -L1, a variety of cancers were demonstra ted to express abundant levels of this 
T-cell inh ibitor.  PD -1 has been suggested to regulate tumor -specific T -cell expansion in 
subjects with melanoma (MEL)  36.  This suggests that the PD -1/PD -L1 pathway plays a 
critical role in tumor immune evasion and should be considered as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.  
 Pembrolizumab  is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of 
the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD -1 and its 
ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2.  Keytruda
TM (pembrolizumab) has recently been approved in 
the United Stated for  the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma 
and disease progression following ipi[INVESTIGATOR_164], if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor.  
 Please refer to the IB for preclinical and clinical data.  
 
1.4.1 Rationale for Dosing 
 An ope n-label Phase I trial (Protocol 001) is being conducted to evaluate the safety 
and clinical activity of single agent MK -3475.  The dose escalation portion of this 
trial evaluated three dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 weeks  (Q2W) in subjects with advanced solid tumors.  All three dose levels 
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/[ADDRESS_499105] in 
human study of MK -3475 showed evidence of target engagement and objective 
evidence of tumor size reducti on at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg 
Q2W).  No MTD has been identified to date.  10.0 mg/kg Q2W, the highest dose 
tested in PN001, will be the dose and schedule utilized in Cohorts A, B, C and D of this protocol to test for initial tumor activity.  Recent data from other clinical studies within the MK -3475 program has shown that a lower dose of MK -3475 and 
a less frequent schedule may be sufficient for target engagement and clinical activity.  
 PK data analysis of MK -3475 administered Q2W and Q3W showed slow systemic 
clearance, limited volume of distribution, and a long half -life (refer to IB).  
Pharmacodynamic data (IL -2 release assay) suggested that peripheral target 
engagement is durable (>21 days).  This early PK and pharmacodynamic data provides scientific rationale for testing a Q2W and Q3W dosing schedule.    A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed using serum concentration time data from [ADDRESS_499106] a wide therapeutic range based on the 
melanoma indication.  The differences in exposure for a 200 mg fixed dose regimen relative to a 2 mg/kg Q3W body weight -based regimen are anticipated to remain 
well within the established exposure margins of 0.5 – 5.0 for MK -3475 in the 
melanoma indication. The exposure margins are based on the notion of similar efficacy and safety in melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. the proposed dose regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W  (i.e. 5- fold higher dose and exposure). The population PK 
evaluation revealed that there was no significant impact of tumor burden on exposure. In addition, exposure was similar between the NSCLC and melanoma indications. Therefore, there are no anticipat ed changes in exposure between 
different indication settings.  
 One of the potential immune -related adverse events of a PD -[ADDRESS_499107] built in a dose escalation plan including a low dose of MK -
3475 of 100 mg Q3W, an intermediate dose of 150 mg Q3W, and a high dose of 200 mg Q3W in order to determine the safety of this combination.  
1.5 Study Rationale  
 The BBB is a major obstacle to drug delivery in the treatment of malignant brain tumors including GBM. Recent work also detailed immune dysregulation in patients with GBM, which is due in part to the BBB limiting tumor antigen presentation and access of immune 
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 14 of 70 cells to the tumor.  MLA has been noted to disrupt peritumoral BBB, which could then lead 
to increased access of new tumor antigens to the lymphovascular system and vice versa of 
immune effector cells to the tumor for effective activation of the immune system . 
Therefore, t he combination of MK -3475 and MLA as proposed in this protocol is 
hypothesized to create a therapeutic synergy in which MLA increases material access to promote immune activation and then MK-3475 maximizes these tumor- specific immune 
reactions  to impart effective tumor control. 
 
1.6 Correlative Studies Background  
 
In both arms  of phase II , intratumoral PD -L1 expression will be determined by [CONTACT_16641]-PCR 
and/or IHC. TIL profile will be assessed by [CONTACT_396822] (when available). Glioma- specific 
immune response will be assessed in cultured TIL, peripheral blood, and sampled cLN (where available). Pre - and post -surgery peripheral blood will be assessed by [CONTACT_396823] (for Washington University samples) and the Tran lab or the University 
of [LOCATION_012] Brain Tumor Immunotherapy Program (for the UF samples) for markers of T 
cell activation and anergy as well as cytokine profiles. In addition, PD-1-dependent 
signature [CONTACT_396844]- specific T cells from the peripheral blood and sampled cLN where 
samples and RNAseq are available can  be generated by [CONTACT_396824]-1-dependent transcriptional signatures and develop a PD -1 dependent biomarker 
program that will be easily de -convoluted to provide data on serial changes in (a) cell type 
composition and (b) cell type activation programs.  Furthermore, if necessary, serum or 
plasma will be assessed for the presence and level of soluble immune checkpoint 
molecules, cytokines, and chemokines using commercially available multiplex immunoassays.

feasibility of completing enrollments in the MK -3475 monotherapy arm.  Therefore, in the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_396791], potential or perceived, to subjects and to complete the study in a timely manner,  patients will no longer be randomized in the phase II portion of this trial.  
After approval of Amendment 12, an additional 20 evaluable patients will be enrolled to 
participate  in a single treatment arm with both MLA and MK -3475. Survival endpoints 
will be compared to historical data based on the above existing data.

3.0 PATIENT SELE CTION 
 
3.1 Inclusion Criteria  
 
1. Phase I : Histologically confirmed grade III or IV malignant glioma.  
Phase II : Histologically confirmed grade IV malignant glioma  (GBM) . 
 
Note: GBM variants and secondary GBM, and suspected secondary GBM are allowed for both phase I and phase II.  
2. Unequivocal evidence of tumor progression as documented by [CONTACT_396825] (see Section 12).  
 
3. There must be an interval of at least [ADDRESS_499109] frontline therapy to study registration unless there is unequivocal evidence for tumor recurrence per RANO criteria (see Section 12).  When the interval is less than 12 weeks, t he use 
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 16 of 70 of perfusion imaging and/or PET scan is allowed to differentiate between unequivocal 
evidence of tumor recurrence and pseudoprogression.  Standard frontline therapy is as described below: 
 
a. For grade IV malignant gliomas (GBM) : Standard frontline the rapy for newly 
diagnosed GBM must include maximal feasible surgical resection (biopsy alone allowed), radiotherapy , and temozolomide chemotherapy.  If the tumor was initially 
diagnosed as either a grade II or III tumor and now has recurred or progressed as a grade IV GBM, it will be considered a secondary recurrent grade IV GBM and will be eligible for this study as long as prior treatment included maximal feasible surgical resection (biopsy alone allowed), radiotherapy, and temozolomide chemotherapy. 
 
b. For grade III malignant gliomas with 1p 19q codeletions : Standard frontline therapy 
for newly diagnosed grade III malignant gliomas must include maximal feasible 
surgical resection (biopsy alone allowed), radiotherapy , and chemotherapy (PCV 
or temozolomide).  If the patient did not receive any or all components of the standard front line therapy as detailed above for newly diagnosed grade III gliomas with 1p 19q codeletions and the tumor then recurred or progressed, s/he must first 
receive at least one prior st andard therapy or any appropriate combination of the 
components of standard therapy as detailed above and must experience further recurrence or progression before s/he is deemed eligible for this study.   If the tumor 
was initially diagnosed as a grade II g lioma with 1p 19q codeletions and now has 
recurred or progressed as a grade III tumor, it will be considered a secondary recurrent grade III glioma with 1p 19q codeletions and will be eligible for this study 
as long as prior treatment included maximal feas ible surgical resection (biopsy 
alone allowed), radiotherapy, and chemotherapy (PCV or temozolomide). 
 
c. For grade III malignant glioma without 1p 19q codeletions : Standard frontline 
therapy for newly diagnosed grade III malignant gliomas must include maxima l 
feasible surgical resection (biopsy alone allowed), radiotherapy , and temozolomide 
chemotherapy.  If the tumor was initially diagnosed as a grade II glioma without 1p 
19q codeletions and now has recurred or progressed as a grade III tumor, it will be considered a secondary recurrent grade III glioma without 1p 19q codeletions and will be eligible for this study as long as prior treatment included maximal feasible surgical resection (biopsy alone allowed), radiotherapy, and temozolomide chemotherapy. 
 
4. Cand idate for MLA  based on the size, location, and shape of the recurrent tumor as 
determined by [CONTACT_396826]. Surgical resection/debulking prior to MLA is allowed per standard of care  but is not required; if the patient undergoes 
resection or d ebulking, it  must have occurred at least [ADDRESS_499110] dose of

database at Washington University. 
 
4.3 Assignment of UPN  
 Each patient will be identified with a unique patient number (UPN) for this study.  All data will be recorded with this identification number on the appropriate CRFs.  
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 21 of 70 4.4 Phase II Patients  
 
As of Amendment 12, patien ts enrolled in the phase II portion of this trial will no longer 
be randomized. After registration and surgery (if applicable ), these patients will undergo 
MLA followed by [CONTACT_90338]-[ADDRESS_499127] dose of MK-3475 will be given not more than 1 
week after MLA , and it will be administered every 3 weeks +/- [ADDRESS_499128] tissue available for diagnostic purpose and for immunological 
monitoring. Surgical resection/debulking is per standard of care and optional for the purpose of 
this study and the performing neurosurgeon will determine whether each patient will undergo 
surgery.   All phase II patients will undergo MLA followed by [CONTACT_90338] -3475.  Patient s who are planning to have 
surgical resection/debulking will have MLA performed at least 3 weeks but not more than 6 weeks 
after surgical resection/debulking.    
 Patients who are not planning to have surgical  resection/debulking will have a  biopsy for tiss ue 
diagnosis and immune monitoring during MLA . If there is a patient with suspected GBM and the 
pathology results are not available by [CONTACT_396827] -
3475, s/he will not be treated and will be removed from stud y. “Determined to be ineligible” will 
be listed as the “Reason Off Therapy” in the OnCore database. The date pathology results were reviewed and/or the date the final determination about eligibility was made will be used as the “Date Off Therapy.” Patients removed from study due to suspected GBM not being confirmed 
through pathology will not be included in the patient total enrolled and will be replaced.  All patients will receive their first dose of  MK-3475 not more than 1 week after MLA (if 
applicable) or biopsy, and then every 3 weeks +/ - [ADDRESS_499129] 3 weeks but not more than 
6 weeks after surgical debulking, and then every 3 weeks +/ - [ADDRESS_499130] dose of MK -3475.  Subsequently, research blood will be drawn at doses 2, 4, 6, 9, 18, 36, and 
at the end of treatment.  In addition, an optional ipsilateral cervical lymph node may be sampled 
by [CONTACT_396828] (including surgical debulking , MLA , or 
biopsy) and again 6 weeks after surgery.  Those patients who, in the event of surgical intervention 
for clinical reasons of a radiographically progressing tumor, undergo a subsequent surgical procedure (whether biopsy or resection) will have tissu e collected for correlative analysis after 
histopathologic diagnosis of recurrent  GBM.  
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/[ADDRESS_499131] progressed and be allowed to resume assigned study treatment at a time deemed safe by [CONTACT_1963], but no later than 8 weeks from the surgery.   
5.1 Premedication Administration  
 
No premedications are required, but antiemetics may be given as per institutional practice if needed.  
5.2 Agent Administration  
 
MK-3475 will be given intravenously over the course of 30 minutes ( -5 min/+10 min) on 
an outpatient basis.  The starting dose for the phase I portion of the study is 100 mg every 
3 weeks ; please refer to the dose escalation schema in Section 5. 4 for dosing during phase 
I.  As determined during the phase I  portion of the study, the phase II dose of MK -3475 for 
all patients is 200 mg .  In the phase I portion of this study, MK-3475 will be given every 3 
weeks starting no more than 1 week after MLA.   In the phase II portion of this study, MK -
3475 will be given every 3 weeks beginning no mor e than 1 week  (+/- 3 days) after MLA.  
 
5.3 MRI -Guided Laser Ablation  
 
MLA is a minimally invasive laser surgery, which employs a small incision in the scalp 
and skull, through which a thin laser probe is inserted and guided by [CONTACT_396829].  
The maximal temperature in the core can reach 70 °C, resulting in coagulative necrosis.  
MLA will be performed as per standard of care.  In those who have undergone a gross total 
resection, the MLA will be directed at treating a peritumoral margin of 0.5 -1cm 
surrounding the resection cavity to disrupt the BBB and potentially increase access of MK -
3475 to the peritumoral infiltrating glioma cells.  
 
After initiation of anesthesia and placement of an MRI -compatible head holder, a  MRI -
guided navigation system is registered using preoperative MRI to define the centroid of the 
target lesion. After inserting the probe in the lesion and positioning the patient in the MRI 
scanner, the laser (1064 nm wavelength, 10- 14 Watts power, pulse duration 2.2 seconds 
on, 1.7 seconds off) is activated and real -time thermal isodose MRI is monitored to achieve 
sufficient treatment (no limit to exposure duration). The NeuroBlate  software provides 
predictive thermal dosage lines.  Yellow lines for 43 °C  are set for 2 min and blue lines for 
43°C for 10 min to estimate ablation volume. These thermal dosage lines will be used to 
establish treatment duration, movement of the probe, and additional trajectories depending 
on the location, shape and size of the target lesion. For some patients, additional trajectories 
are chosen preoperatively; for other patients, additional trajectories are chosen based on 
thermal dosage lines of the initial trajectory. After successful ablation, the probe is removed 
and the wound is closed in routine fashion.  Patients are generally hospi[INVESTIGATOR_396792] 16, 10/06/[ADDRESS_499132] -treatment edema. Also, the patients are placed on prophylactic ant iepi[INVESTIGATOR_23698] 
(i.e. Keppra) to mitigate perioperative and post- treatment seizures. During post -operative 
recovery, patients have routine neurological exams per the care team.  In the ICU this is on an hourly basis; in the stepdown unit this is every two hours. Additionally, post -operative 
labs are obtained immediately after surgery and on the following day to ensure there are no metabolic abnormalities. They are also seen in the morning and in the late afternoon by [CONTACT_343217].  
 
5.4 Phase I Dose Escala tion Schema  
 
Dose Escalation Schedul e 
Dose Level  MK-3475 Dose  
Level 1  (Starting Dose)  [ADDRESS_499133] -MLA dose of MK -3475 and the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_396793] 3 weeks after that dose. 
 
NOTE:  No later than two weeks following the completion of the first two months of 
treatment for the first [ADDRESS_499134] be provided 
to the FDA as a formal IND submission.  This submission should include a listing of all AEs of grade 2 or greater severity observed.  For all AEs of grade 3 or greater severity, and for all SAEs, a narrative description of the events should be included, along with the timing 
of the event in relationship to study treatment, interventions, duration, and outcome.  
 
5.5 Definition of MTD, DLT, and Dose Escalation Criteria  
 
5.5.1 Definition of Maximum  Tolerated Dose (MTD)  
 
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the dose level immediately below the dose level at which 2 patients of a cohort (of 2 to 6 patients) experience dose- limiting toxicity during the first cycle.  Dose escalations will proceed until the 
MTD has been reached or, failing that, 200 mg q3wks will be considered the MTD. 
 
5.5.2 Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs) 
 
DLT is defined as any of the following that occur during the  time frame between 
the first dose of MK -3475 and 3 weeks after the second dose of MK -3475 that are 
attributed as possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study treatment:  
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 24 of 70 • Grade 2 or greater diarrhea 
• Autoimmune hypophysitis 
• Grade 3 or greater h epatitis  
• Grade 2 or greater p neumonitis 
• Significant intracranial edema requiring high- dose steroid (defined as > 16 
mg/day and/or inability to taper steroids to ≤ 8 mg/day within 4 weeks due 
to recurrent symptoms attributable to excessive cranial edema)  
• Grade 3 or greater non-hematologic toxicity 
• Grade 3 or greater hematologic toxicity  
 
5.5.3 Dose Escalation Criteria  
 
Dose escalations will proceed as follows after the occurrence of DLT:  
Number of Patients with 
DLT at a Given Dose Level  Escalation Decision Rule 
[ADDRESS_499135] dose level  if only 3 patients were treated 
previously at that dose . 
1 out of 3  • Enter at least 3 more patients at this dose level.  
• If 0 of these 3 patients experience DLT, proceed to the next 
dose level . 
• If [ADDRESS_499136] dose level  if only 3 patients were treated previously at 
that dose . 
≤ [ADDRESS_499137] dose of MK -
3475 through 3 weeks following the second dose of MK -3475.  Once the patient has 
received his/her third dose of MK -3475, s/he will no longer be evaluated for DLTs.  
Patients who do not incur a DLT and who receive only a single dose of MK -3475 or who 
do not undergo MLA should be considered not evaluable for DLT and shoul d be replaced.  
 
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 25 of 70 5.7 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
All treatments that the investigator considers necessary for a patient’s welfare may be administered at the discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_133594].  Patients are prohibited from receiving the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_396794]:

5.8 Women of Childbearing Potential  
 
Women of childbearing potential (defined as women with regular menses, women  with 
amenorrhea, women with irregular cycles, women using a contraceptive method that 
precludes withdrawal bleeding , and w omen who have had a tubal ligation ) are required to 
have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within [ADDRESS_499140] azoospermia (whether due to having had a vasectomy or due to an underlying medical condition).    A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal 
unless permanently sterile (see below).  Wom en in the following categories are not 
considered of childbearing potential:  
• Premenarchal  
• Premenopausal female with 1 of the following: 
o Documented hysterectomy  
o Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656] 
o Documented bilateral oophorectomy 
Note:  Documentation can c ome from the site personnel’s review of the 
participant’s medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
 
• Postmenopausal female 
o A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an 
alternative medical cause.  
 A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, 
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/[ADDRESS_499141] discontinue HRT to 
allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment. 
 
Contraception Requirements  
Subjects should be informed that taking the study medication may involve unknown risks 
to the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study.  In order to 
participate in the study subjects of childbearing potential must adhere to the contraception requirement (described below) from the day of study medication initiation (or 14 days prior  
to the initiation of study medication for oral contraception) throughout the study period up to [ADDRESS_499142] should not be entered into the study.  
Male Participants: 
Male participants with female partners of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to one of the following during the protocol defined timef rame:  
• Be abstinent from penile -vaginal intercourse as their usual and preferred lifestyle 
(abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent 
• Use a male condom plus partner use of a contraceptive method with a failure rate of <1%  per year as described in the table below when having penile -vaginal 
intercourse with a woman of childbearing potential who is not currently pregnant. 
o Note: Men with a pregnant or breastfeeding partner must agree to remain abstinent from penile -vaginal int ercourse or use a male condom during each 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_117492].

Pregnancy Testing 
WOCBP should only be included after a negative highly sensitive urine or serum 
pregnancy test.  
 Following initiation of treatment, pregnancy testing will be performed whenever an expected menstrual cycle is missed or when pregnancy is otherwise suspected, after the last dose of study treatment, and as required locally.  Pregnancy testing will be performed whenever an expected menstrual cycle is missed or when pregnancy is otherwise suspected.  
 
5.9 Duration of Therapy  
 
If at any time the constraints of this protocol are considered to be detrimental to the 
patient’s health and/or the patient no longer wishes to c ontinue protocol therapy, the 
protocol therapy should be discontinued and the reason(s) for discontinuation documented in the case report forms.  
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue for up to 
24 months (35 cycles; t he number of treatments is calculated starting with the first dose ) 
or until one of the following criteria applies:  
 
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 29 of 70 • Documented and confirmed disease progression 
• Death  
• Adverse event(s) that, in the judgment of the investigator, may cause severe or 
permanent harm or which rule out continuation of study drug 
• General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator

for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution  or stabilization of the 
adverse event.  
  
6.0 DOSE DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
AEs associated with pembrolizumab exposure may represent an immunologic etiology. These immune -related AEs (irAEs) may occur shortly after the first dose or several months after the last 
dose of pembrolizumab treatment and may affect more than on body system simultaneously. Therefore, early recognition and initiation of treatment is critical to reduce complications.   
Based on existing clinical study data, most irAEs were reversible and could be managed with interruptions of pembrolizumab, administrat ion of corticosteroids and/or other supportive care. 
For suspected irAEs, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Additional procedures or tests such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, skin biopsy may be included as part of the evaluation. Based on the severity of irAEs, withhold or permanently discontinue pembrolizumab and administer corticosteroids. Dose modification and toxicity management guidelines for irAEs associated with pembrolizumab are provided in the table below. 
 
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 31 of 70  
General instructions:  
1. Corticosteroid taper should be initiated upon AE improving to Grade [ADDRESS_499146] 4 weeks.  
2. For situations where pembrolizumab has been withheld, pembrolizumab can be resumed after AE has been reduced to Grade 1 or 0 and corticosteroid has been 
tapered. Pembrolizumab should be permanently discontinued if AE does not resolve within 12 weeks of las t dose or corticosteroids cannot be reduced to ≤ [ADDRESS_499147] followed by [CONTACT_44874]. Other immunosuppressive treatment sh ould be initiated if

[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Overdose  
 
For purposes of this trial, an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any dose of 1,000 mg or greater (≥5 times the indicated dose).  No specific 
information is available on the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab. Appropriate supportive treatment  should be provided if clinically indicated.  
In the event of overdose, the subject should be observed closely for signs of toxicity.  Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.  If an adverse event(s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose of a [COMPANY_006] product, the adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even if no other seriousness criteria are met.  
 
If a dose of [COMPANY_006]’s product meeting the protocol definition of overdose is 
taken without any assoc iated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory 
results, the  overdose is reported as a non- serious Event of Clinical Interest 
(ECI), using the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.”  
 All reports of overdose with and without  an adverse event must be reported 
within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to [COMPANY_006] Global Safety. (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX [PHONE_8247])

9.3 Tumor Tissue Specimens  
 
9.3.1 Collection of Specimens  
 
Any tissue (from either surgical debulking or biopsy or MLA/bio psy) available 
after histopathologic diagnosis of GBM will be collected for correlated studies as 
follows: 
• Flash frozen for DNA and RNA isolation and for priming of DC 
• Fixed and embedded in paraffin for IHC 
• Acutely dissociated to generate patients’ primary  GBM cell lines and tumor 
infiltrating lymphocyte culture  if adequate tissue is available. 
 Phase II patients will have tissue collected.  
 Those patients who, in the event of surgical intervention for clinical reasons of a radiographically progressing tumor, undergo a subsequent surgical procedure (whether biopsy or resection) will be collected after histopathologic diagnosis of 
progressive GBM.  
 
9.3.[ADDRESS_499171] protocol. One half 
of the tissue will be equally divided into 2 parts: one part will be flash frozen and 
the other part will be fixed and embedded in paraffin (FFPE).  FFPE samples are to 
be batch shipped to a MERCK- designated laboratory for central performance of 
PD-L1 IHC. F ive (5) unstained slides may be submitted in lieu of the FFPE tissue 
block. The other half of the tissue will be divided into 2 parts: one part will be 
acutely dissociated by [CONTACT_396836]-

Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/[ADDRESS_499198] – Solid Tumors  
 
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re -evaluated for response every 9 +/- 1 
weeks.  In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained 9 weeks 
(not less than 4) weeks following initial documentation of objective response. 
 Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the updated response assessment criteria for high -grade gliomas: Response Assessment in Neuro -Oncology 
(RANO) working group guideline [JCO 28(11): 1963-1972, 2010].  
Criteria for Determining First Progression Depending on Time from Initial Chemoradiotherapy  
First Progression  Definition  
Progressive disease < 12 
weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy
 Progression can only be defined using diagnostic imaging if there is new 
enhancement outside of the radiation field (beyond the high- dose region or 
80% isodose line) or if there is unequivocal evidence of viable tumor on histopathologic sampling (eg, solid tumor areas [ie, > 70% 
tumor cell nuclei 
in areas], high or progressive increase in MIB-1 proliferation index compared with prior biopsy, or evidence for histologic progression or increased anaplasia in tumor). Note: Given the difficulty of differentiating true progression from pseudoprogression, clinical decline alone, in the absence of radiographic or histologic confirmation of progression, will not 
be sufficient for definition of progressive disease in the first 12 weeks after 
completion of concurrent chemoradiotherapy.  
Prog ressive disease ≥ [ADDRESS_499199] -enhancing lesion outside of radiation field on 
decreasing, stable, or increasing doses of corticosteroids.  
2. Increase by ≥ 25% in the sum of the products of perpendicular diameters between the first postradiotherapy scan, or a subsequent scan with smaller tumor size, and the scan at 12 weeks or later on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids. 
 
3. Clinical deterioration not attributable to concurrent medication or comorbid conditions is sufficient to declare progression on current treatment but not for entry onto a clinical trial for recurrence. 
 
4. For patients receiving antiangiogenic therapy, significant increase in 
T2/FLAIR nonenhancing lesion may also be considered progressive 
disease. The increased T2/FLAIR must have occurred with the patient on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids compared with baseline scan or best response after initiation of therapy and 
not be a result of comorbid events (eg, effects of radiation thera py, 
demyelination, ischemic injury, infection, seizures, postoperative 
changes, or other treatment effects).

Criteria for Response Assessment Incorporating MRI and Clinical Factors (Adapted from JCO 2010) 
Response  Criteria  
Complete response • Requir es all of the following: complete disappearance of all enhancing 
measurable and nonmeasurable disease sustained for at least 4 weeks.  
• No new lesions; stable or improved nonenhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions. 
• Patients must be off corticosteroids (or on physiologi c replacement 
doses only) and stable or improved clinically. Note: Patients with nonmeasurable disease only cannot have a complete response; the best 
response possible is stable disease.  
Partial response Requires all of the following:  
• ≥ 50% decrease compared with baseline in the sum of products of 
perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions sustained 
for at least 4 weeks.  
• No progression of nonmeasurable disease.  
• Stable or improved nonenhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same or lower dose of corticosteroids compared with baseline scan; the corticosteroid 
dose at the time of the scan evaluation should be no greater than the dose 
at time of baseline scan.  
• Stable or improved clinically. Note: Patients with nonmeasurable 
disease only cannot have  a partial response; the best response possible is 
stable disease.  
Stable disease Requires all of the following:  
• Does not qualify for complete response, partial response, or progression.  
• Stable nonenhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same or lower dose of 
corticosteroids compared with baseline scan. In the event that the corticosteroid dose was increased for new symptoms and signs without confirmation of disease progression on neuroimaging, and subsequent follow-up imaging shows that this increase in corticos teroids was 
required because of disease progression, the last scan considered to show stable disease will be the scan obtained when the corticosteroid 
dose was equivalent to the baseline dose.  
Progression Defined by [CONTACT_39132]:  
• ≥ 25% increase in sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of 
enhancing lesions compared with the smallest tumor measurement 
obtained either at baseline (if no decrease) or best response, on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids
*. The absolute increase in any 
dimension must be at least 5mm when calculating the products. 
• Significant increase in T2/FLAIR nonenhancing lesion on stable or increasing doses of corticosteroids compared with baseline scan or best response after initiation of therapy
* not caused by [CONTACT_186754] (e.g. 
radiation therapy, demyelination, ischemic injury, infection, seizures, 
postoperative changes, or other treatment effects).  
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 51 of 70 Response  Criteria  
• Any new measureable lesion . 
• Clear clinical deterioration not attributable to other causes apart from the 
tumor (e.g. seizures, medication adverse effects, complications of 
therapy, cerebrovascu lar events, infection, and so on) or changes in 
corticosteroid dose. 
• Failure to return for evaluation as a result of death or deteriorating 
condition; or clear progression of nonmeasurable disease.  
• NOTE. All measurable and nonmeasurable lesions must be a ssessed using the same techniques as at 
baseline.  
• Abbreviations: MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; FLAIR, fluid -attenuated inversion recovery.  
• Stable doses of corticosteroids include patients not on corticosteroids.  
 
12.2 Disease Parameters  
 
Measurable disease:  Bi-dimensionally measurable lesions with clearly defined margins 
by [CONTACT_396837] ≥ [ADDRESS_499200] be recorded in millimeters (or 
decimal fractions of centimeters).   
 
Non-measurable or evaluable disease:   Uni-dimens ionally measurable lesions or lesions 
with margins not clearly defined such as  areas of T2/FLAIR signal abnormality or poorly 
defined enhancing abnormality.  
 
Note: For cystic lesions, the only measurable part is any enhancement area around the cyst 
that is clearly defined and bi -dimensionally measurable. The cyst itself should not be 
considered measurable or non- measureable disease.  
 Target lesions:  All measurable lesions that are seen at baseline MRI. Target lesions should 
be selected on the basis of thei r size (lesions with the longest diameter), but in addition 
should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion, which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  When there are too many measurable lesions, choose the largest 3 lesions as target lesions to follow.  The other measurable lesions should be considered evaluable for the purpose of objective status determination.  Non-target lesions:  All non -measurable lesions should be identified as non -target lesions 
and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout follow-up.  
 
12.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler.  All baseline MRI evaluations should be performed  prior to MLA . An MRI should be collected 
and evaluated after any surgical procedure (MLA, surgical resection/debulking, or biopsy).  
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/[ADDRESS_499201] dose of MK -3475 for patients not receiving any 
surgical procedure.    
    
Clinical lesions:  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable on brain MRI when 
they are ≥ 10 mm in bi-dimensional diameter s as assessed using a ruler.  
 
Histology:  This technique can be used to differentiate between partial responses (PR) and 
complete responses (CR) in rare cases when biopsy or surgical resection of a measureable 
lesion is clinically indicated.  
 
Perfusion/CBV: This advanced brain MRI technique can  be used as an adjunct test to 
determine treatment response or disease status.  However, it should not be used as the primary or sole method to determine response or disease status.  
 Brain FDG -PET coupled with head CT or brain MRI:  This advanced metabolic  
imaging technique can be used as an adjunct test to determine response or disease status. However it should be used as the primary or sole method of determining response or disease status.  
 
12.3.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all target lesions.  
 Partial Response (PR):   ≥ 50% decrease compared with baseline in the sum of 
products of perpendicular diameters of all target lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD):   At least a 25% increase in the sum of products of 
perpendicular diameters of at least [ADDRESS_499202] sum of products of perpendicular diameters on study (this includes the baseline sum 
if that is the smallest on study).   The absolute increase in any dimension must be at 
least 5mm when calculating the products of perpendicular diameters.  In the event of surgical intervention for clinical reasons of a radiographically progressing tumor when subsequent surgical pathology demonstrates a predominant immune -mediated reaction  with no obvious progression of tumor , 
the subject will be deemed not progressed and allowed to resume study treatment as assigned prior to the surgery at a time deemed safe by [CONTACT_1963], but no later than 8 weeks from the surgery.  Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of products of 
perpendicular diameters while on study. 
 
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 53 of 70 12.3.2 Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all non -target lesions.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s).  
 Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions on stable or increasing doses 
of corticosteroids compared with baseline scan or best response after initiation of therapy
* not caused by [CONTACT_186754] (e.g. radiation therapy, demyelination, 
ischemic injury, infection, seizures, postoperative changes, or other treatment effects) . Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion status.  
It must be representative of overall disea se status change, not a single lesion 
increase.     
 Although a clear progression of “non- target” lesions only is exceptional, the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_36408], and the progression status should be confirmed at a l ater time by [CONTACT_463] (or 
Principal Investigator).  
 
12.3.[ADDRESS_499203] response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressi ve 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The 
patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both 
measurement and confirmation criteria.

Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 54 of 70 † Increase in corticosteroids alone will not be taken into account  in determining progression in the 
absence of persistent clinical deterioration.  
NOTE: Patients may continue on  treatment and rem ain under close obs ervation and evalu ation at

“pseudop rogres sion” associa ted with dec reased ster oid use. 
 
12.3.4 Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response:   The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement c riteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) 
until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented 
(taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first 
met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   
 
Duration of stable disease:   Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
 
12.3.[ADDRESS_499205]  (DSM B) will be specifically convened for this 
trial to review toxicity data.  A DSM B will consist of no fewer than [ADDRESS_499206] to the trial principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or appropriate university  officials, in accordance with institution policies. 
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 55 of 70 Potential conflicts that develop during a trial or a member’s tenure on a DSM B must also be 
disclosed.  
 Until such a time as the first secondary site enrolls its first patient, a semi -annual DSM report to 
be prepared by [CONTACT_396838] (QASMC) semi- annually beginning six months after study activation at Washington 
University (if at least one patient has been enrolled) or one year after study activation (if no patients have been enrolled at the six -month mark). 
 The DSM report will be prepared by [CONTACT_396839] , 
will be reviewed by [CONTACT_9288] B, and will be submitted to the Quality Assurance and Safety 
Monitoring Committee (QASMC).  The DSMB must meet at least every six months beginning six 
months after study activation at Washington University or beginning six months after enrollment of the first patient at a secondary site, no more than one month prior to the due date of the DSM report to QASMC.

15.1 Power Analysis  
 
In the phase I portion of the study, a traditional 3+3 design is used to determine the maximal 
tolerated dose (MTD) of MK -3475 when combined with MLA for the treatment of 
recurrent malignant gliomas.  
 Power analysis for phase II is based on PFS.  Using a 1-sided alpha of 0.15, with an accrual 
interval of 20 months and additional follow-up of 6 months (study period in Phase II is 26 months), and assuming a progression free survival probability at 6 month ( 6-PFS) of 40% 
for the MK -3475 alone group and 65% fo r MK -3475 + MLA combination group, we will 
need 17 patients per group with probability (power) 0.8. If the 6 -PFS of the MK -3475 alone 
group is 45% and 65% for the MK -3475 + MLA combination group, we will need 25 
patients per group.  We are planning to enro ll 20 patients per group for th e phase II portion 
of trial.

Six-PFS for all current commonly used treatments for recurrent GBM (e.g. bevacizumab, 
temozolomide, carboplatin, carmustine, lomustine, etoposide, irinot ecan) ranges from < 
10% to low 30% 39-43. Since historical data on 6- PFS in recurrent GBM for both MK -3475 
and MLA are not available, for the purpose of reasonable estimation of efficacy of the  MK-
3475 and MLA combination as compared to MK -3475 alone in recurrent/progressive 
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 58 of 70 GBM, we will assume that the 6 -PFS of the MK -3475 alone group to be 40- 45% to derive 
sample size estimates for both groups as detailed above.  
 
15.[ADDRESS_499209] assumption will be 
examined .  
 Pearson correlation coefficient (r) will be calculated between intratumoral expression of PD-L1 and the frequency of glioma cell -specific cytotoxic T cells. Similarly, Cox 
proportional hazard model will be used to investigate the relationship between PD -1-
dependent biomarkers in gl ioma cell -specific T cells and PFS and OS
. 
 
15.3 Phase II Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_396810] a continuous basis. Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_396811] 3 seizure rate. It is assumed that a maximum -tolerated seizure rate is 
50% and a seizure rate of 33% and or less is acceptable. For each treatment arm (n=20), based on the repeated significance testing (using R function toxbdry) with 80% power and 0.[ADDRESS_499210] (20th) 
patient has completed the trial.  
 In addition, enrollment will stop and a review will be conducted to determin e whether 
modifications to the protocol are warranted or if the trial should be terminated if 2 patients 
in either group die or incur life -threatening (grade 4) adverse reactions that are thought 
to be at least possibly related to study treatment.  
 
15.[ADDRESS_499211], an interim analysis was conducted  in June 2019.  The MK-3475 + 
MLA group included 2 GBM patients who received 200mg in Phase 1 and 10 patients in Phase 2.  PFS probability at 6, 9, and 12 months after treatment are 45.0%, 45.0%, and 
33.8%, the median PFS is 5.49 months. Survival probabilities at 6, 9, and 12 months after treatment are 75.0%, 62.5%, and 50.0%, and the median OS is not estimable.  For the MK-
3475 monotherapy (no MLA)  group, PFS probability at 3 months after treatment is 44.4% 
Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 59 of 70 and the median PFS is 2.73 months (95% CI: 1.41- 3.88). Survival probabilities at 3 and 6 
months after treatment are 83.3%, and 31.3%, and the median OS is 4.77 months (95% CI: 
1.74-8.78).   
 This analysis showed significant differences in PFS and survival probabilities between the 
MK-3475 + MLA group and the MK -3475 alone group.  Therefore, with Amendment 12, 
we are revising the study to a single arm (MK -3475 + MLA)  in the s pi[INVESTIGATOR_396812], potential or perceived, to subjects and to complete the study in a timely manner. The recent study
46 shows median PFS was 2.4 months. To be conservative, we will use the 
shorter  mPFS for MK -3475 + MLA group and longer mPFS  from historical data. We will 
enroll additional [ADDRESS_499212] calculated from a sam ple of 32 subjects achieves 8 0.9% power at 
a 0.[ADDRESS_499213] a median PFS of 5.1 months  in the MK -3475 + MLA 
group when the median PFS of the historical control is 2.9 months .  
 
15.5 Subgroup analysis  
 
For participants in the Second Course Phase (Retreatment) , PFS and OS will be estimated 
by [CONTACT_5263]- Meier product limit method .  
  
16.0 MULTICENTER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

Protoc ol Amendment 16, 10/06/2021   page 65 of 70 APPENDIX B:  Definitions for Adverse Event Reporting  
 
A. Adverse Events (AEs)  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32:   Definition: any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered drug- related.  
 Grading:  the descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for all toxicity reporting.  A copy 
of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website.  Attribution (relatedness), Expectedness, and Seriousness:  the definitions for the terms listed 
that should be used are those provided by [CONTACT_9092]’ Office 
for Human Research Protections (OHRP).  A copy of this guidance can be found on OHRP’s website:  
http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html
 
 
B. Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32:  Definition: any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the 
adverse event.  “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relatio nship 
between the drug and the adverse event.  “Suspected adverse reaction” implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug. 
 
C. Life-Threatening Adverse Event / Life Threatening Suspected Adverse Reaction  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32:  Definition: any adverse drug event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” 
if, in the view of the investigator, its occurren ce places the patient at immediate risk of death.  It 
does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
 
D. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction  
 As defined in 21 CFR 312.32:  Definition:  an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view 
of the investigator, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
o Death  
o A life -threatening adverse event 
o Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_396816] 16, 10/06/[ADDRESS_499217] 
normal life functions  
o A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
o Any other important medical event that does not fit the criteria above but , based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above 
 
E. Events of Clinical Interest  
 
Events of clinical interest for this trial in clude: 
1. an overdose of [COMPANY_006] product that is not associated with clinical symptoms or abnormal 
laboratory results.  
2. an elevated AST or ALT lab value that is ≥ [ADDRESS_499218] and an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is ≥ [ADDRESS_499219] and, at the same time, an al kaline phosphatase lab value that is < 
[ADDRESS_499220] of protocol -specified laboratory testing or unscheduled 
laboratory testing.  
 
F. Protocol Exceptions  
 
Definition: A planned change in the conduct of the research for one participant. 
 
G. Deviation 
 
Definition: Any alteration or modification to the IRB -approved research without prospective IRB 
approval.  The term “research” encompasses all IRB -approved materials and documents including 
the detailed protocol, IRB application, consent form, r ecruitment materials, questionnaires/data 
collection forms, and any other information relating to the research study.  A minor or administrative deviation is one that does not have the potential to negatively impact the rights, safety, or welfare of participants or others or the scientific validity of the study.  
 A major deviation is one that does have the potential to negatively impact the rights, safety, or welfare of participants or others or the scientific validity of the study.

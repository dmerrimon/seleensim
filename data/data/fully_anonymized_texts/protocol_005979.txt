Protocol Title: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_333111] -paired breathalyzers and loss - and gain -framed 
text notifications for reducing drinking driving  
Short Title: BE SAFE  
Protocol Description: This project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of a scalabl e behavioral 
intervention using smartphone -paired breathalyzers and text message s aimed a t reducing drinking and 
driving among individuals who report heavy drinking. Participants re ceive a smartphone breathalyzer to 
provide feedback on their estimated blood alcohol level. The i ntervention compares loss - and gain -
framed messages that make the consequences of drinking and d riving more salient to standard 
messages not to drink and drive.

Study Instruments  
Discuss the particulars of the research instruments, questionnaires and other evaluation instruments in 
detail. Provide validation documentation and or procedures to  be used to  validate instruments. For well 
know and generally accepted test instruments the detail here can be bri ef. More detail may be required 
for a novel or new instrument. For ethnographic studies identify any study instruments to be used (i .e. 
for deception studies) and describe in detail where, when and how the study will be conducted and who 
or what are the subjects of study. Note: For more information on h ow to conduct ethical and valid 
ethnographic research, follow the link For oral historie s or interview s provide the general framework for 
questioning and means of data collection. If interviews or groups se ttings are to be audio taped or video 
taped describe in detail the conditions under which it will take place. Include a copy of any no vel or new 
test instruments with the IRB submission.  
 
1. Intake Survey (attached to the protocol) a) Driving History and Experience Questionnaire DHEQ  
(Harrison & Fillmore, 2005): This self -report questionnaire gathers information on driving history and  
behavi ors. Included in the questionnaire are measures of driving experience such as length of time  
holding a driver ’s license and number of days and miles driven per week. The questionnaire also gathers  
information about participants driving behaviors, such as l icense revocations, presence and number of  
DUI citations and punishments, traffic accidents, traffic tickets, typi[INVESTIGATOR_333112] (rural, urban, 
and interstate), and the type of vehicle transmission (manual, a utomatic, or both). b) Drinking and 
driving questionnaire (McCarthy et al): This self -report questionnaire gathered information on  
individuals drinking and driving history. The questionnaire asked parti cipants to respond to questions 
about drinking and driving history on 4 or 5 point Likert sca les. The q uestionnaire included a measure of 
frequency of drinking and driving and typi[INVESTIGATOR_333113]. The items 
were obtained from a scale reported by [CONTACT_333132].  (2012). c) Delayed discounting questionnaire 
(Senecal, Kable et al 2012). Time discounting (known in terchangeably as present -biased preferences or 
delay discounting) is a measure of impulsivity that  reflects people ’s tendencies to discount the value of a 
V4; 10.4.[ADDRESS_411910] stronger present biased preferences.  
This is expected because engagement  in unhealthy behaviors enta ils immediate gratifications in 
exchange for future health problems. It is not known whether a similar pa ttern of behavior is present in 
those engaging in drinking and driving. Consistent with prior work, w e will use the 51 -item  monetary 
choice questionnaire developed by [CONTACT_333133]; and colleagues (2012) that defines 10 ranges  of delayed 
discounting by [CONTACT_6486] a hyperbolic function to participants expressed pr eferences for smaller immediate 
versus larger delayed rewards. d) Barratt I mpulsiveness Scale BIS -11 (P atton et al., 1995) This 30 -item 
self- report questionnaire is designed to measure the personality dimensi on of impulsivity. Participants 
rated 30 different statements on a 4 -point Likert -type scale ranging from Rarely/Never to Almost  
Always/Always. Higher total scores indicate higher levels of self -reported impulsiveness. e) Self reported  
drinking. We will collect self -reported drinking days and drinks per day using a timeline follow -back 
method. This method has been used by [CONTACT_333134] (1996). We w ill cover the previous month in this assessment. f) 
Basic demographics such a race, age, and education.  g) Self -report of drinking and driving in stances 
(Sloan et al. 2014). This survey is a validated instr ument that asks participants to report on their general 
drinking behavior and its relation to driving.  
 
 2. End of Baseline survey (attached to protocol) a) Driving History and Experience Questio nnaire DHEQ 
(Harrison & Fillmore, 2005): This self-report questionnaire gathers information on driving history and 
beha viors. This will be modified to cover the length of time since this was previously asked (4 weeks), all 
questions that were used in the intake and are no longer relevant will be removed. b) Drinking and 
driving questionnaire (McCart hy et al): This self -report questionnaire gathered information on 
individuals dr inking and driving history. The questionnaire asked participants to respond to q uestions 
about drinkin g and driving history on 4 or 5 point Likert scales. The questionnaire included a measure of 
freque ncy of drinking and driving and typi[INVESTIGATOR_333114]. The items 
were ob tained from a scale reported by [CONTACT_333132]. (2012). This survey will be modified to cover the 
previous 4 weeks of the baselin e period. c) Self -reported drinking. We will collect self -reported drinking 
days and drinks per day using a timeline follow -back method. This method has been us ed by [CONTACT_333135] (19 96). We 
will cover the previous month in this assessment.  
 
3. End of Study Survey (attached to p rotocol) a) Driving History and Experience Quest ionnaire DHEQ 
(Harrison & Fillmore, 2005): This se lf-report questionnaire gathers information on driving history and 
behaviors. This will be modified to  cover the length of time since this was previously asked (4 weeks), all 
questions that were used in the  intake and are no longer relevant will be removed. b) Drinking and 
driving questionnaire (McCarth y et al): This self -report questionnaire gathered information on 
individuals drinking and driving h istory. The questionnaire asked participants to respond to questions 
about drinking and driving history on 4 or 5 point Likert scales. The  questionnaire included a measure of 
frequency of drinking and driving and typi[INVESTIGATOR_333115]. The items 
were obtained from a scale reported by [CONTACT_333132]. (2012).  
This survey will be modified to cover the previous 4 weeks of the interven tion period. c) Self -
reported drinking. We will collect self -reported drinking days and drinks per d ay using a timeline follow -
back method. This method has be en used by [CONTACT_333136] (1996). We will cover the previous month in this 
assessment.  
 
V4; 10.4.17  4. End of study interview (attached to protocol) This interview will ask ab out the experience in the trial 
and help determine if this intervention is acceptable and liked by [CONTACT_306991]. We will also use this 
interview to inquire about ways it can improve and things that were not liked by [CONTACT_20908].  
 
5. Smartphone Br eathalyzer (BacTrack Mobile Pro) This device was ch osen as one of the most popular 
currently commercially available breathalyzers that pair with smartpho nes, which has received growing 
attention in the national media. (A smartphone breathalyzer, 2015; Joll y, 2015). In a recently completed 
study conducted by [CONTACT_2296], this was the most accurate smartphone pair ed breathalyzer available on 
the market and it was actually better than a current police grade breathaly zer at predicting blood 
alcohol levels.  
This s tudy was accepted for presentation at the 2017 Society for the Advancement of Violence 
and Injury Research annual meeting. The device pairs with the BACtrack app available for Android and  
iPhone, which enables the export of data to the study team. The curr ently collected data fields available 
in this free, publically available consumer application include: gues sed BAC, actual BAC, was it 
themselves or friend, GPS coordinates of where BAC was taken, and timestamp of the BAC.  
 
6. TrueMotion Driving app: True Motion.is a leading provider of s martphone applications aimed at 
measuring and improving driving behavior. They are the vendor for Pro gressive Insurances usage -based 
insurance application. The app uses native phone sensors to detect d riving and passenger v s. driver 
status. The app is also able to log passenger epi[INVESTIGATOR_333116]. The  
TrueMotion app will be installed on participants’ phones to track driving e xposure. Once installed it will 
run continuously in the background without any user interaction. Tr ueMotion collects the following 
information for each trip level data set (each will be coded with user I D and trip ID): , 1. Start/stop time, 
location, and intensity of detected braking and acceleration events 2.  Start/stop time, location, and 
intensity of speeding events (excess speed relative to an absolute threshold or relative to local speed 
limits) 3. OS -level events like screen on, screen unlock, call state 4. Start/stop time and location of 
detected distrac tion events using our sensor -based algorithms: phone cal ls (with a detection of in -hand 
versus hands -free) and general non -call usage like tappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], typi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. As far  as the time -series sensor data 
which can be linked with a user ID and trip ID, TrueMotion wil l provide: 1. GPS points (lat/lon position, 
speed, accuracy, etc) at 1 Hz IMU sensor data (3 -axis accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer) at [ADDRESS_411911] data fields collected and that will be exported include trip start/ stop time, location, 
and mileage The data will be securely transferred to  the University of Pennsylvania on a weekly basis.

Group Modifications  
Describe necessary changes that will or have been made to the study instruments for different groups.  
 
During all phases study staf f will collect data from 3 sources:  
 
1) The BACtrack device and app will require the participant to initiate use during all phases of the trial. 
Researc hers will instruct participants to use this device during the study when drinking to help inform 
them o f their level of impairment and ability to operate a vehicle. See section attached screenshots for 
more i nformation on this app and what it tells users. As part of the BACtrack app each participant wi ll be 
asked to guess what their BAC is prior to submit ting a sample. Once a sample is submitted and  
processed the app will display both the actual BAC measure as well as the participants guess. They  will 
also be able to indicate of the sample was provided by [CONTACT_333138]. Data collected usi ng this 
app and device includes guessed BAC, actual BAC, person submitting the sample, GPS coordinates, and 
timestamps.  
 
2) The TrueMotion app will collect participant driving data without any additional  initiation by [CONTACT_2416]. Data collected from this app will include GPS coordinates, driving speed, trip length, time of 
drive, and  cellphone use while driving. During a drive or after its comple tion participa nts will be able to 
indicate if they are a passenger or a driver.  
 
3) Self -report in the form of a TLFB  and additional questions about drinking and driving over the past [ADDRESS_411914] to H ealth site that asks them about drinking events, drinking and driving 
events, and BACtrack use for th e previous week. At enrollment, the research coordinator will conf irm 
that the participant has an active Uber and/or Lyft app installed and active account. This will be done to 
encourage participants to  not drink and drive.  
 
Baseline Phase:  All participants will receive an identical baseline phase l asting [ADDRESS_411915] of capturing observed and self -reported incidents of alcohol use and driving epi[INVESTIGATOR_333117]. During thi s phase participants will be asked to install and use the TrueMotion app and will 
receive a BACtrack device. Once both app s are installed and working the baseline phase will begin.  
 
After the baseline phase, participants will be randomized into one of three arms for the remaining 4 
weeks of the trial:  
 
V4; 10.4.17  1. Control arm:  Participants assigned to this arm will continue to use the TrueMotion app and 
BACtrack device as in the baseline phase. They will also be asked to complete the same weekly 
self-report survey each week.  
2. Loss -framed messaging arm:  Participants assigned to this arm will continue to use the 
TrueMotion app and BACtrack device as in the baseline phase. They will also be asked to 
complete the same weekly self -report survey. During this phase participants will receive a text 
message  on Thursday, Friday, and Satur day before 6:00 PM  that are framed as  a loss  (financially 
or personal). On each of these days, a text message will be selected from a bank of   messages 
(attached) that utilizes loss aversion  as it reminds participants to use the BACtrack app and to 
not dri nk and drive (for example, “A BAC >0.[ADDRESS_411916]. A DUI can land you in jail with $10,000 -15,000 in fines and increased 
insurance costs.  Don’t ruin your life: plan a ride and commit to not drinki ng and driving tonight.  
#BESAFE”) . 
3. Gain -framed messaging arm:  Participants assigned to this arm will continue to use the 
TrueMotion app and  BACtrack device as in the baseline phase. They will also be asked to 
complete the same weekly self -report  survey . During this phase participants will receive  a text 
message  (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday before 6:00 PM)  that are framed as  a gain  (financially 
or personal ). On each of these  days, a message will be selected from a bank of  messages 
(attached) that utiliz es a gain as it reminds participants to use the BACtrack app and to  not drink 
and drive (for example,  “A BAC >0.[ADDRESS_411917] a life : plan a ride and commit to not drinking and driving tonigh t.  #BESAFE”).   
 
Method for Assigning Subjects to Groups  
Describe how subjects will be randomized to groups.  
We will use block randomization where participants and will be to assigned their study arms  
 
Administration of Surveys and/or Process  
Describe the approximate time and frequency for administering surveys a nd/or evaluations. For surveys, 
questionnaires and evaluations presented to groups and in settings su ch as high schools, focus group 
sessions or community treatment centers explain how the process w ill be administered and who will 
oversee the process. For instance, discuss the potential issues of h aving teachers and other school 
personnel administer instruments to minors who are students especially if the content is sensiti ve in 
nature. Describe the procedure for audio and videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_333118]/or focus groups and 
the storage of the tapes. For instance, if audio tape recording is to be used in a classroom setting, 
describe how this will be managed if individuals in the class are not pa rticipating in the study. Explain if 
the research involves the review of records (including public databases o r registries) with identifiable 
private information. If so, describe the type of information gathered from the records and if identifiers 
will be collected and retained with the data after it is retrieved. Describe  the kinds of identifiers to be 
obtained, (i.e. names, social security numbers) and how long the i dentifiers will be retained and 
justification for use.  
We are planning to recruit and enro ll approximately 60 individuals th rough recruitment material that 
will be sent out through emails and fliers (see recruitment material attac hed). Participants will also be 
recruited through posted flyers, postcards, email blasts, social media,  and by [CONTACT_72683] -of-mouth/colleague 
referrals at Penn. The flyers will be posted in a variety of public and private locations. Research 
assistants will recruit participants by [CONTACT_333139] p laces, such as on the street or 
near bars. No one will be app roached to participant who appears intox icated. And No recruitment will 
occur at public or private places without first obtaining permission. The Penn Social Media & Health  
V4; 10.4.[ADDRESS_411918] decided to use this proce ss to reduce the 
time needed to read the full consent for those who may not qualify. Once eligibili ty has been 
determined eligible participants will be instructed to re view and sign the full consent for participation .  
 
We are also planning to recruit through the Emergency Department (ED). Through ED recruitment, we 
will have an opportunity to encounter potential participants who may bene fit from this injury 
prevention intervention. The Emergency Departments at the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_333119] 
(HUP) and Penn Presby[CONTACT_51616] (PPMC) are staffed with Academic Associates (AA). The AAs 
are a  cadre of staff who are trained, provided appropriate access  to patient in formation, and employed 
for the express purpose of screening patients for eligibility upon admission and recruiting patients as 
research participants at clinically appropriate times. The recruitment of research subjects is an ongoing 
procedur e in the ED of HUP and PPMC and their systems for subject recruitment are well established.  
The AAs at all locations participate in training seminars throughou t the year to stay current with 
protocol updates and to orient to upcoming studies. Approximately  2-[ADDRESS_411919] access to EPIC/PennChart may also pa rticipate in the se seminars and 
recruit in the ED.  
 
Eligibility for screening will be determined via the  ED tracking system using EPIC. AAs and trained 
research staff in the ED will review the tracking boards to identify patients age 21 -39. This review is for 
screening purposes only. AAs and research staff will  not review medical records for any patient. When 
an eligible patient is identified (age 21 -39), they will check the tracking board and/or confirm with the 
treating physician or resident physician that the pati ent is fit to be approached for research (no altered 
mental status, no active intoxication, not too uncomfortable from pain, n o unstable vital signs, no 
Emergency Severity Index (ESI) level 1 or 2). If the timing  is clinically appropriate, the AA or research 
staff member will confirm with the treating physicia n that the interviewer will not interrupt the flow of 
care. Once confirmed, the interviewer will approach the patient to provide information about the study 
including the inclusion/exclusion criteria. If t he timing is suitable and the  patient is interested, the 
interviewer will proceed through the eligibility screening proces s and the informed consent procedure 
via electronic device (UPHS -approved tablet or laptop, or patients personal device) used to enrol l the 
patient as a participant via Way to Health.  The interview may be conducted with patients in a private 
room in the ED as they await discharge . For patients on the ward, the interview would also be 
conducted in a private room. For patients who are disc harged before being enrolled, the enrollment 
process will continue electronically via the  Way to Health platform. If its clinically appropriate to 
approach, but not enroll, the AA or researc h staff member may approach the patient to provide 
information abo ut the study including the inclusio n/exclusion criteria and obtain contact [CONTACT_333140] a later time. For patients who are discharged before completing the 
onboarding portion of the enrollment process  (downloading apps, pr oviding a photo of their ID, 
V4; 10.4.17  receiving a breathalyzer) the AA or research staff m ember may take the patient to a private area in the 
HUP or PPMC lobby [CONTACT_333141].  
 
Following this, a member of the research team will contact [CONTACT_333142]. If enrolled in the ED, the study staff member will set up an a ppointment with the 
participant to go through all of the enrollment steps. Staff will ensure full comprehension of study 
procedures and requirements  during this call. Participants will also be asked to complete the intake 
survey to continue in the trial. T he trial timeline will not begi n until the intake has been completed, all 
apps have been installed and act ivated, and the BACtrack device has been received.  
 
Participants will be asked to complete [ADDRESS_411920] to health to complete an intake survey  and end of study 
survey at predetermined time points (following eligibility and consent  and study completion 
respectively).  
 
Attached to this protocol are the following study instruments for data collection and recruitment: 1) 
Written Informed Consent 2) Eligibi lity Survey 3) Intake Survey 4) End of Study Survey 5) Weekly self -
report survey  
 
Data Management  
Describe how and who manages confidential data, including  how and whe re it will be stored and 
analyzed. For instance, describe if paper or electronic report forms will be used, how corrections to the 
report form will be made, how data will be entered into any database, an d the person(s) responsible for 
creating and maintaining the research database. Describe the use of pseudonyms, code numbers and 
how listing of such identifiers will be kept separate from the research data.  
 
Way to Health (Survey data):  All personal information that the particip ant is as ked to provide will be 
collected via Penn ’s Way To Health study platform. Way To Health co llects subjects names, dates of 
birth, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, and the last four digits of their social security 
number. They also request the name  [CONTACT_333159]. To assure that 
participant confidentiality is preserved, individual identifiers are stored  in a single password protected 
system that is accessible only to study research, analysis and IT staff. The last four digi ts of participant’s  
social security numbers will be stored in a locked cabinet to be destroyed a t a later date. An investigator 
or statistician who logs in will be able to access only non -ident ifiable data. The Way To Health 
administrative group and resear ch coordinators responsible for contac ting participants for follow -up 
study visits or responding to questions about the study are able to vie w participant names and contact 
[CONTACT_3031]. The WTH web development team and Project Directo r currently have admin istrative access 
to PHI. All of these personnel will have completed Huma n Subjects Protection and HIPAA privacy 
training. The system automatically generates logs of all data q ueries which can be reviewed by [CONTACT_333143].  
 
This system is hosted on site at The University of Pennsylvania and is pro tected by a secure firewall and 
several layers of operational security. Once a participant has been ent ered into this system, th ey are 
given a unique study identification number (ID). Any datasets and compute r files that leave the firewall 
are stripped of all identifiers and individuals are referred to by [CONTACT_23976] y ID. The study ID is also used 
on all analytical files. The Penn M edicine Academic Computing Serv ices (PMACS) is the hub for the 
V4; 10.4.[ADDRESS_411921] 
party data sources (i.e. survey software) is strippe d of any identifie rs and transmitted in encrypted 
format.  
 
The same unique study ID is used to link these outside data to the participants.  All data for this project 
will be stored on the secure/firewalled servers of the PMACS Data Cen ter, in data files t hat will be 
protected  by [CONTACT_164259]. These data servers are maintained in a guarded facility behind 
several locked doors, with very limited physical access rights. They are al so cyber -protected by [CONTACT_333144]. Electro nic access rights are carefully 
controlled by [CONTACT_111551]. Way To Health uses highly se cure methods of data encryption 
for all transactions involving participant's financial information using a level of security com parable to 
what is used in commercial financial transactions. This multi -layer system  of data security, identical to 
the system protecting the University of Pennsylvania Health S ystems medical records, greatly minimizes 
the risk of loss of privacy. All com munications between users  and our site will be encrypted with 
SSL/HTTPs technology.  
 
TrueMotion (Driving data):  TrueMotion requires users to enter in basic  
information to set up the account policy. This includes: Username [CONTACT_333160]: The following raw data fields organized at the timestamp level (clustered within  
drives, clustered within participants) will be transferred in C SV files in a way that can be securely  
downloaded in bulk by [CONTACT_3374]: Trip level data set with user ID and trip ID: 5.  
Start/stop time, location, and intensity of detected braking and accelera tion events 6. Start/stop time, 
location,  and intensity of speeding events (excess speed relative to an ab solute threshold or relative to 
local speed limits) 7. OS -level events like screen on, screen unlock, ca ll state 8. Start/stop time and 
location of detected distraction events using our senso r-based algorithms: phon e calls (with a detection 
of in -hand versus hands -free) and general non -call usage like tappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. As far as the time -series 
sensor data which can be linked with a user ID and trip ID, TrueMotion will provide: 2. GPS points (l at/ 
lon position, speed, accuracy, etc) at 1 Hz 3. IMU sensor data (3 -axis accelerometer, gyroscope, and 
magnetometer) at [ADDRESS_411922] access to pull these data onto PMACS server in one we ek increments. Data will not be tracked 
or analyzed in real time.  
 
V4; 10.4.17  BACTtrack (Breathalyzer Data)  We co llect time -stamped and geocoded data on breath alcohol 
content using the BACTrack App wh ich pairs with the FDA approved BACtrack Mobile Pro. Each 
participant will be instructed to down load the BACTrack View app from the Apple App store and register 
a uniquely assigned, de-identified study email (e.g. [EMAIL_6498]) to create a BACTrack 
account. Parti cipants will need to accept the BACTrack privacy policy and accept the option to share 
data with  BACtrack. No identifying HIPAA sensitive information will be entered into BACTrack app 
registratio n portal by [CONTACT_19288]. BACtrack will provide the University of Pennsylvania a weekly 
down load of all data collected from designated user accounts (prefix besafe) via access to BACtracks 
secure Box fold er. These password protected CSV files will be downloaded from the BACtracks B ox 
folder by [CONTACT_333145] a weekly basis and be inputted into Way to Health. This 
includes the de -identified user ID (e.g. besafe24), timestamped and geocoded guessed and actual B AC 
measurements. In addit ion to the BACTrack privacy policy outlines that personally identifiable 
infor mation (account names) will not be shared with outside parties, we will also obtain an NIH 
Certificate of Confidentiality that will  protect the University of Pennsylvania from di sclosing this 
potentially sen sitive information to any third parties.

Abstract  
 
Nearly 88,[ADDRESS_411924], is to demonstrate the feasibility of a scalable in tervention using loss- or gain -framed messaging 
to reduce drinking and driving , compare the effectiveness of each type of messaging,  and to increase 
the use of a personal BAC monitor. Our long -term  objective is to secure federal funding for research that 
leverages insights from behavioral ec onomics supported by [CONTACT_333147], drinking and driving, and to increase self -monitoring and understanding of how alcohol affects 
us. This long -term objective is consistent with the rec ently released FY 2016 -20 NIH Strategic Vision that 
strives to deliver ef fective mobile health (mHealth) technologies for health promotion and disease 
V4; 10.4.[ADDRESS_411925] theory proposes that messages framed in different ways can elicit different responses 
from individuals.36 Loss aversion refers to people's tendency to prefer avoiding  losses to acquiring 
equivalent gains: it's better to not lose $5 than to find $[ADDRESS_411926] on preventative healthcare.37 By [CONTACT_333148], innovative loss aversion and gain -framed messaging  strategies incorporating insights from 
behavioral economics c ould be more easily implemented by [CONTACT_333149] a 
risky behavior taking plac e. We hope that the use of loss aversive and/or gain -framed messaging will 
lead to individuals improving planning behavior  around drinking, especially in regards to drinking and 
driving. The objectiv e of this project is to demonstrate the feasi bility of a scalable intervention using 
loss- gain -framed messaging to reduce drinking and driving , compare the effectiveness of each type of 
messaging,  and to increase the use of BAC monitors as a way to plan s afer strategies when drinking . Our 
long -term objective is to secure federal funding for research that leverages insights from be havioral 
economics supported by [CONTACT_333150]. This long -term objective is 
consistent with the recently released FY 2016 -20 NIH Strategic Vision that strives to deliver effective 
mobile health (mHea lth) technologies for health promotion and disease prevention and monitori ng 
blood -alcohol levels in real time to prevent alcohol -related injury and dise ase. 
 
Primary outcome variable(s)  
The primary outcome will be: Change in proportion of breathalyzer measurements submitted with self -
reported drinking ep isodes across groups . 
 
Secondary outcome variable(s)  
Secondary outcomes will be: 1) Change in frequency of BACtrack monitoring within each intervention 
group from baseline; 2) Drinking and driving epi[INVESTIGATOR_333120] t heir BAC via self -report or BAC measure 
is expected to be positive; 3) Changes in accuracy of  BAC g uess vs actual BAC measure with continued 
use (Does a participant become more accurate overtime in predicting what their BAC will be prior to 
measuring). Lack of previous research prevents us from calculating the power to detect the  drinking and 
driving outcomes, which is why this pi[INVESTIGATOR_333121].  
 
Background  
 
Nearly 88,[ADDRESS_411927] similar cognitive abili ties, actually understand legal consequences 
V4; 10.4.17  better, but are poorer planners and more present -biased, heavily weighing immediate costs and 
benefits relative to future ones when making decisions.6 This su ggests that str ategies such as planning a 
designated driver and providing immediate reinforceme nt of the benefit of moderating alcohol 
consumption are particularly promising approaches to reduce  drinking and driving and binge drinking. 
Nationally, 17% of individuals aged [ADDRESS_411928] theory proposes that messages framed in different ways ca n elicit different responses  from 
individuals.36 Loss aversion refers to people's tendency to prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equ ivalent 
gains: it's better to not lose $5 than to find $5. People are more moti vated to avoid losing something 
than they ar e to win something. Studies have found that delivering mess aging framed as a loss are also 
effective in motivating certain behaviors. On the other hand, gain -framed messages have been shown to 
have a positive effect on preventative healthcare.[ADDRESS_411929] come on the 
market,17,19 allowing individuals to monitor and more easily track their own breath alcohol concentration 
(BrAC). Given the popularity of these devices,20,21 booming sales (an $816 million dolla r market),[ADDRESS_411930], is to demonstrate the feasibility of a scalable 
intervention using messaging to increase the use of the monitors.

V4; 10.4.17  Study Design  
 
Phase*  
Not applicable  
 
Design  
 
Study population : We will recruit [ADDRESS_411938] be (a) over 21 years of 
age, (b), Reports an average  of one heavy drinking day (men more th an five drinks, women more than 
four drinks) per week over the preceding 8 weeks. (d) a valid photo ID (e) willing and able to use an  
Uber or Lyft or septa as transportation home (f) drives four or more trips per week  (g) and owns an  
Apple iPhone or Android smartphone. Participants will be excluded if th ey (a) desire alcohol treatment 
now or received it in the past 6 months, (b) alcohol use disorder per DSM -V criteria and (c) non -English -
speaking, and (d) women who are  pregnant (e) individuals  who should not consume alcohol due to a 
medical condition.  
 
Procedures:  Participants will be pr ovided with a smartphone -paired breathalyzer (BACtrack) and a 
smartphone app that tracks (TrueMotion) drivi ng behavior. The drive tracking app has been modified for 
research purposes to run completely  in the background with special privacy protections for research 
participants with an approved NIH Certi ficate of Confidentiality.  
 
Data and information will be collected in 3 ways througho ut this study :  
1) The BACtrack device and app will require the participant to initiate use during all phases of the t rial. 
Researchers will instruct participants to use this device during the study when drinking to help inform 
them  of their level of impairment and ability to operate a vehicle . As part of th e BACtrack app each 
participant will be asked to guess what their BAC is prior to s ubmitting a sample.  Once a sample is 
submitted and processed the app will display both the actual BAC measure as well as th e participants 
guess. They will also be able to indicate of the sample was provided by [CONTACT_333138]. Data 
collected using thi s app and device includes guessed BAC, actual BAC, person submitti ng the sample, 
GPS coordinates, and timestamps.  
 
2) The TrueMotion app will collect participant driv ing data without any additional initiation by [CONTACT_2416]. Data collected from this a pp will include GPS coordinates, driving speed, trip length, time of 
drive, and cellphone use while driving. During a drive or after its completion participants will be able to 
indicate if they are a passenger or a driver.  
 
3) Self -report i n the form of a  TLFB will be collected once a week for all participants. Each wee k 
participants will be asked to complete a brief survey on the Way to Health site that asks them abou t 
drinking events, drinking and driving events, and BACtrack use for the p revious week   
 
Participants  will be given educ ational information on the risks of drinking and will be randomized, using 
block randomization, to a control or  one of two  intervention group s for 8 weeks. Par ticipants will be 
blinded as to their group assignment. Participants  in the intervention groups  will receive messag es on 
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday before 6:00 PM  and will be informed of this  random selection  in the 
consent . For the intervention groups , the context of these messages will differ across each gro up and 
participants will not be alerted to this difference. Specifically, the consent will state that rese archers will 
V4; 10.4.[ADDRESS_411939] of different messaging strategies on the use of self -monitoring. Text messag es will be 
delivered 3 days a week —Thursday, Friday, and Saturday —through the Way  to Health platform and 
Twilio, a texting service that is contracted through W ay to Health.  
 
This program does not encourage drinking and dri ving, in fact it is designed in hopes t hat participants 
will be more informed about their level of intoxication and their ability to drive. Additionally, messages 
delivered following a posi tive BAC reading highlights the dangers and risks of a DUI. Attached to this 
protocol are examples of thes e messages.  
 
Measures and Data Analysis.  Participants will complete a baseline and end of study survey via Way to 
Health with standard measures of drinking and driving behavior, measures of pla nning ability, a delay 
discounting task, and demographic variables. Time -stamped and g eocoded drive trip data will be 
obtained from the TrueMotion app. Self -reported drinking behavior wi ll be recorded weekly using the 
timeline follow back method.  
 
The primary  outcome  measure will  be the change in proportion of breathalyzer measurements 
submitted with self -reported drinking ep isodes across groups.  
 
Secondary  outcomes will be: 1) Change in frequency of BACtrack monitoring  within  each  intervention 
group from baseline; 2) Drinking and driving epi[INVESTIGATOR_333126] r BAC vi a self -report or BAC measure 
is expected to be positive; 3) Changes in accuracy of BAC guess vs ac tual BAC measure with continued 
use (Does a participant become more accurate overtime in predicting what their BAC will be prior to 
measuring). Lack o f previous research prevents us from calculating the power to detect outcome #3, 
which is why this pi[INVESTIGATOR_333121].  
 
We will use logistic regression a s our primary analytic model to assess effectiveness, between and wit hin 
the interventions. Altho ugh longitudinal models such as generalized estimating equations might be 
considered in light of the repeated measures among  individual participants, logistic regression is 
preferred in this c ase because the primary outcome collapses most time points into a single 
dichotomous measure. Approa ch to missing data: As our main outcome in this trial is the proportion of 
measures conducted overtime,  missing data will be scored as not completing a measurement.  
 
Participants missing weekly self -report surveys will be reminded to complete a TLFB for any missing 
weeks regularly. If a participant fails to  complete 75% of the self -report surveys under baseline 
conditions they will not be allowed to cont inue to the intervention phase. If participants who have 
moved to the intervention phase fail to complet e self -report data during the intervention phase 
estimates on drinking behavior can be derived from their baseline data.  
 
Study duration  
Participants will be enrolled for eight weeks in th e study. The projected start date of the study is

Will the recruitment plan propose to use any Penn media services (communications, marketing, etc.) for 
outreach via social media avenues (examples include: Facebook, Twi tter, blogging, texting, etc.) or does 
the study team plan to directly use social media to recruit for the research?  
Yes 
 
Please identify which method(s) of social media you will utilize, the content of the text to be used, and 
the method(s) for posting th is information (i.e., using Penn supported communication services). When 
proposing the text to utilize, please be aware of any social media limitations (i.e., number of characters 
allowed in a tweet) and any appropriate confidentiality practices necessary to be compliant with posting 
research recruitment text.*  
We plan to use Facebook and Twitter to post recruitment messages. Thes e messages are severely 
limited in terms of the length they can be. Our message will be "Help Upenn researchers reduce drinking 
and driving while earning money" and will include a link to the WTH stud y portal that will contain more 
information such as that listed on our recruitment flyer. We also plan to post our recruitment flyer on  
Craigslist.  
 
Study Procedures  
 
Suicidal Ideation and Behavior  
Does this research qualify as a clinical investigation that will utilize a test article (ie - drug or biological)  
which may carry a potential for central nervous system (CNS) effect(s)?  
No 
 
Procedures  
 
Enrollment:  Potential participants will be directed to the Way to Heal th platform. A participant will 
create an account and review an Eligibility screening consent. This brief consent will grant us access to 
administer a brief eligibility survey. We have decided to use this proce ss to reduce the time needed to 
read the full consent for those who may not qualify. Once eligibility has  been determined eligible 
participants will be instructed to review and sign the full consent for p articipation. Following this, a 
member of the research team will contact [CONTACT_333156]. Participants will also be asked to complete the intake  survey to continue in the trial.  
The trial timeline will not begin until the intake has been completed and  all devices and apps have been 
received and activated.  
V4; 10.4.17   
Randomization:  Once participants have received  and activated their devices they will be pla ced into 
the baseline phase of the trial for [ADDRESS_411945] completed 75% of 
their self -report measures they w ill be randomized to one of t hree  groups : a) control , b) loss-framed 
messaging group, or c) gain -framed mes saging group .  
 
Baseline Measurement:  During the baseline period, the TrueMotion app will passively track driving 
behavior and participants. Pa rticipants will not receive any information on whether to use their 
BACtrack device. At the end of the baseline meas urement period participants will complete an end of 
Baseline survey via way to health.   
 
Intervention Period : After four weeks , participants will be randomized into one of three  arms : control , 
loss-framed messaging group, or gain -framed messaging group .  
 
Weekly Surveys:  Each week, under both phases, participant will be prompted to complete a self -report 
survey and TLFB.  
 
 
Deception

No 
 
Analysis Plan  
 
Measures and Data Analysis.  Participants will complete a baseline, end  of baseline period, and end of 
study survey via Way to Health with standard measures of drinking and driving behavior, measures of 
planning ability, a delay discounting task, and demographic variables. Time -stamped and geocoded drive 
trip data will be obt ained from the TrueMotion app. Self -reported drinking behavior will be recorded 
weekly using the timeline follow back method.  
 
Primary outcome : The primary outcome measure will be the change in proportion of breathalyzer 
measurements submitted with self -reported drinking epi[INVESTIGATOR_333128].  
Secondary outcome  measures include: 1) Change in frequency of BACtrack monitoring within each 
intervention group from baseline; 2) Drinking and driving epi[INVESTIGATOR_333129] -report or 
BAC measure is ex pected to be positive; 3) Changes in accuracy of BAC guess vs actual BAC measure 
with continued use (Does a participant become more accurate overtime in predicting what their BAC will 
be prior to measuring). Lack of previous research prevents us from calcu lating the power to detect the 
drinking and driving outcomes, which is why this pi[INVESTIGATOR_333121].  
To measure the primary outcome, we will employ a logistic regression using the participants baseline as 
a predictor and the  intervention vs. control and vs each other as the primary predictors. Although 
longitudinal models such as generalized estimating equations might be considered in light of the 
repeated measures among individual participants, logistic regression is preferr ed in this case because 
the primary outcome collapses most time points into a single dichotomous measure.  
V4; 10.4.17   
Approach to missing data:  As our main outcome in this trial is the proportion of measures conducted 
overtime, missing data will be scored a s not comp leting a measurement. Participants missing weekly 
self-report surveys will be reminded to complete a TLFB for any missing weeks regularly. If a participant 
fails to complete 75% of the self -report surveys unde r baseline conditions they will not be allowed to 
continue to the intervention phase. If participants who have moved to the intervention phase fail to 
complete self -report data during t he intervention phase estimates on drinking behavior can be derived 
from their baseline data.  
 
Data confidentiality  
x Paper -based records will be kept in a secure location and only be accessible to personnel involved  
   in the study.  
x Computer -based files will only be made available to personnel involved in the study through the  
   use of access privileges and passwords.  
   Prior to access to any study -related information, personnel will be required to sign statements  
   agreeing to protect the security and confidentiality of identifiable information.  
x Wherever feasible, identifiers will be removed from study -related inf ormation.  
x A Certificate of Confidentiality will be obtained, because the research could place the subject at  
   risk of criminal or civil liability or cause damage to the subject's financial standing,  
   employability, or liability.  
   A waiver of docume ntation of consent is being requested, because the only link between the  
   subject and the study would be the consent document and the primary risk is a breach of  
   confidentiality. (This is not an option for FDA -regulated research.)  
x Precautions are in  place to ensure the data is secure by [CONTACT_71994], because  
   the research involves web -based surveys.  
x Audio and/or video recordings will be transcribed and then destroyed to eliminate audible  
   identification of subjects.  
 
Subject Confidentiality  
All data and records generated during this study will be kept confidential in accordance with  
Institutional policies on subject privacy and the Investigator and other s ite personnel will not use such 
data and records for any purpose other t han conducting the study. The safeguards described above will 
be implemented to ensure subject confidentiality. No identifiable data will be used for future studies 
without first obtaining IRB approval. The investigator will obtain a data use agre ement bet ween provider 
(the PI) and any recipi[INVESTIGATOR_5772] (including others at  CHOP) before sharing a limited dataset (dates 
and zip codes). We will be collecting licenses through the  secure Way to Health portal to verify that all 
participants are licensed to d rive. We will destroy these im ages when the participant study participation 
is complete, no more than 1 week after their final survey completion  
 
Sensitive Research Information*  
Does this research involve collection of sensitive information about the subjects that should be excluded  
from the electronic medical record?  
No 
 
Subject Privacy  
V4; 10.4.17  Privacy refers to the person's desire to control access of others to themselves. Privacy concerns people, 
whereas confidentiality concerns data. Describe the strategie s to protect privacy giving consideration to 
the following: The degree to which privacy can be expected in the proposed research and the safeguards 
that will be put into place to respect those boundaries. The methods used to identify and contact 
[CONTACT_42148]. The settings in which an individual will be interacting with an investigator. The 
privacy guidelines developed by [CONTACT_153719], professional associations and scholarly disciplines 
(e.g., psychiatry, genetic counseling, oral history, a nthropology, psychology).  
Privacy is of the utmost concern for us. In this trial every participant  will be assigned a participant 
number, this will link their study related data. We will not release any  names or information to anyone 
outside of this study.  Participants will complete all surveys online and wil l not be required to attend any 
in person sessions. We will allow for participants to be placed on te ams with unknown others if they 
chose and will never release their names to team members. We will in clude all risks associated with 
participating such as the potential risk of personal information being o btained in the consent for each 
participant to consider.  
 
Data Disclosure  
Will the data be disclosed to anyone who is not listed under Personnel?  
No. Par ticipant BrAC measurements and survey responses from par ticipants will not be linked to 
participant identifying information, and data will be available only fo r study personnel. However, all 
potential subjects will be informed that the information they pro vide will be held in confidence to the  
extent that the law allows, but that the exception to this confidentiality is any disclosure of potential for 
immediate harm of themselves or others, such as active suicidal or homicidal ideation or child abuse.  
The p articipants will be notified prior to participation that if any of these issues are raised, the 
researchers will take whatever steps are necessary to protect the subjec t or others, including bringing 
risk of harm to the attention of the proper authorities.  As an emer gency physician, [CONTACT_333164] is 
experienced with assessing this type of risk and committing patient s or notifying child protective 
services or law enforcement when necessary.

Risk / Benefit  
 
Potential Study Risks  
This is a minimal risk, behavioral intervention study. Physical risk is no more than the risks already 
caused by [CONTACT_333157].  Participants will not have to interac t with the TrueMotion app after 
installation and will be instructed to only use the BACtrack device in a safe setting. There are no 
expected serious adverse events related to the intervention or participat ion in this s tudy. This program 
does not encourage drinking and driving, in fact , it is designed in hopes that participants will be more  
V4; 10.4.[ADDRESS_411949] this we will be using assigned participant IDs 
that will be tied to the data derived in thi s trial. These IDs will be used by [CONTACT_333158] (TrueMotion and 
BACtrack) as the key identifier and data  labeling. We will not disclose participants names as part of this 
trial.  
 
Rating Scales and Questionnaires.  To avoid breach of confidentiality, subjects' names will appear only 
on a consent form, a  telephone screening form and a "key" form kept in a locked cabinet. All forms that 
contain identifying information will be kept double locked (i.e., in a locked cabinet, in a locked room) to 
maintain their secu rity. All study data forms will contain only the subject's unique study identification 
number, using a  reference system maintained by [CONTACT_5984]. Completed study forms will be kept in a 
locked cabinet, the key to which will be  available only to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_333131]. Subject 
visits will be scheduled and no information about the subject will be provided to anyone (except in 
emergencies as defined above) in person or by [CONTACT_756]. All paper research records will be stored in 
locked cabinets and only the investigators and only IRB a pproved study will have access to those 
records.  
 
Potential Study Benefits  
All participants will benefit by [CONTACT_26777] a text message to promote t he use of a BAC monitor to help 
plan less risky driving incidents. Participants are contributing to preparat ion of a larger study, which in 
turn may have benefits to society in general. Understanding the pote ntial of using breathalyzers to 
reduce risky drinking has the potential to benefit society in general.  
 
Alternatives to Participation (optional)  
 
Data and Safety Monitoring  
All source documents will be identified by [CONTACT_47201] (ID)  number, and the key to that ID 
number will be kept in a locked file cabinet. All personally identifiable i nformation also will be kept 
separately in a locked file cabine t. No results will be reported in a pers onally identifiable manner. All 
tracking system data and research database information will be passwor d-protected with several levels 
of protection: first, a password will be required to access the computer of  the us er who has access to 
the database; second, a password will be required to access the database. The principal investigator, [CONTACT_333165], and the project manager, Jessie Hemmons , will monitor and maintain confidentiality of data.  
 
Risk / Benefit Assessment  
In general the benefits outweigh the risks in this study. Participants will  receive information on alcohol 
consumption and health. Participants are also contributing to preparation o f a larger study, which in 
turn may have benefits to society in general. A lthough there are some risks in volved in participating in 
this study, as mentioned above, these can be minimized to ensure that th e potential benefits exceed the 
potential risks, so that the risk/benefit ratio is favorable.

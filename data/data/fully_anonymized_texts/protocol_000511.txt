Protocol Date:  5/18/[ADDRESS_1013489] shown metformin to decrease 
all-cause mortality in diabetic and non -diabetic patients.1 –3 Additionally, in both animal mo dels 
and human trails, metformin has been shown to decrease the risk of arterial and venous 
thrombosis without affecting bleeding time through its interaction with platelet mitochondria.4 –[ADDRESS_1013490] focused on 
optimizing older, deconditioned patients prior to the operation with varying protocols referred to 
as prehabilitation. These programs work to improve the body’s response to the surgical stress 
resulting in improved  wound healing, decreased postoperative complications, and decreased 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577]. The affect of metformin, like increasing physical activity, has wide 
spread affects on physiology. We therefore hypothesize that metformin administration to non -
diabetic adults will improve clinical outcomes to physiologic stress (including surgical stress) by 
[CONTACT_741248], that can be deleterious.  
 
The body’s response to stress is a complex interplay between the magnitude of the stress and 
host factors including genetics, epi[INVESTIGATOR_7009], age, and lifestyle. Surgical procedures result in a loss 
of physical barriers to the environment, local tissue injury, vascular damage, altered 
neurohormonal signaling, and hemodynamic changes . 9–13 Tissue injury results in stimulation 
of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll -like receptors (TLRs). The systemic level 
of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a ligand for TLR4, is increased following major abdominal 
surgery.12 –[ADDRESS_1013491] the body from invading pathogens, aid in tissue healing, and allow for overall 
survi val. 2,3,13 However, the systemic complications of an overwhelming inflammatory 
response, including but not limited to acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], acute kidney injury, 
vascular thrombosis, poor wound healing both due to and independent of glycemic  control, 
deteriorations in memory and mood, and depressed cardiac function are all well -established 
postoperative complications. The balance of the pro - and anti -inflammatory reaction is key to 
homeostasis and recovery. However, why some patients suffer f rom postoperative inflammatory 
complications while others do not is not well understood. Further, currently there is no 
established anti -inflammatory treatment in the peri -operative period to help alleviate or prevent 
an overwhelming pro -inflammatory syste mic response. This study will help us to better 
understand the underlying mechanisms of metformin and potentially identify it as a source of 
pharmacologic prehabilitaiton improving surgical outcomes.  
 
The underlying mechanisms of action of metformin are un der active investigation. Presumably,

 cellular mitochondria are thought to be the primary site of metformin activity. Metformin 
decreases intracellular AMP and increases 5’ -AMP -activated protein kinase (AMPK) resulting in 
three main down -stream effects.[ADDRESS_1013492], there is a decrease in gluconeognesis, 
decreasing serum glucose levels, and improving insulin resistance. Secondly, mitochondrial 
AMPK activation inhibits mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), which decreases mitotic 
activity and ther efore has anti -tumor affects and influences mitochondrial homeostasis. Finally, 
downstream protein synthesis inhibition results in decreased production of both pro -
inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) through activation of the 
thioredox ine antioxidant system decreasing DNA damage.15 –18 
 
In addition to its effects on human cellular mitochondria and systemic inflammation, 
metformin’s direct effect on the gastrointestinal system has become an active area of research. 
Metformin has been show n to alter activity of the gastrointestinal endocrine system, increasing 
release of glucagon like peptide -1 (GLP -1) and pancreatic polypeptide (PPY) which regulate bile 
acids and control satiety and metabolism.20,[ADDRESS_1013493] metformin has 
in non -diabetic patients. Non -diabetic patients were tr eated with 250mg - 875mg three times 
daily or 2000mg daily for 14 days – [ADDRESS_1013494] (30 -60% of subjects) being self -
limited gastrointestinal discomfort in cluding mild diarrhea and anorexia.23 –[ADDRESS_1013495] this hypothesis by [CONTACT_741249].

Study Design  & Methods  
 
All samples will be gathered prior to, throughout the 90 days (30, 60 and 90 days), and again 
approximately 30 days following completion of the metformin exposure.  
1.) Changes in basic metabolic, coagulation, and hematologic profiles  during and following 
exposure to metformin.  
2.) Establish dose specific responses to affects on PBMC and ex vivo inflammatory response to 
innate immune system during and following metformin exposure. Cells will also be assessed for 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_741246].  
3.) Understand the dose -specific effects of metformin on thrombotic factors, coagulation, and 
platelet function in an ex vivo model.  
4.) Mitochondrial analysis of cellular respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].  
5.) Stool samples assessed for changes in the gastrointestinal microbiome  
 
Cognition and physiology will be assessed at the baseline, 90 day, and 120 day time points.  
6.) Physiologic testing: grip strength as measured by a dynamometer and a short physical 
performance battery  
 
Unexpected adverse events including significant illnes s, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], emergent or urgent 
surgery or procedure, psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_741247], would require the 
study team to discontinue the subject’s participation.  
 
Additionally, if the subject fails to participate in the require d study procedures they will receive 
compensation for those items that they have completed. However, they may be removed from the 
study and not allowed to participate in the study going forward. If participation needs to be 
discontinued, the study team wil l make up to [ADDRESS_1013496] the inclusion criteria:  
1. Age ≥55 and ≤85 years of age  
2. Non -diabetic  
3. Adjusted risk analysis index (RAI) 20 -42 
4. Estimated glomerular filtration rate >=[ADDRESS_1013497] the exclusion criteria:  
1. Hypersensitivity to metformin or any component of the formulation  
2. Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis with or without coma  
3. Pregnant or breastfeeding females  
4. Evidence or history of hepatic, renal, or cardiac failure  
5. Excessive acute or chronic ethanol use  
6. Planned or known hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063], exposure to anesthesia, or surgical intervention 30 days 
prior to study or scheduled 30 days after the trial initiation  
7. Laboratory analysis showing HbgA1c >6.1 or eGFR <[ADDRESS_1013498] impactful variable included in this study. 
Previously, our group has looked at the immune response to lipopolysac charide in healthy 
volunteers PBMCs ex vivo. In this study, we noted a statistically significant increase in pro -
inflammatory cytokines between the two groups by [CONTACT_3450] 40%. We expect a standard 
deviation of around 50% of the baseline values. Theref ore, based upon previous inflammatory 
changes seen in healthy volunteers and a desired alpha = 0.05 and a beta = 0.2, our most 
conservative projected sample size using a two -sided Mann -Whitney test is [ADDRESS_1013499] results (30 days after treatment discontinuation) for physiologic 
Page 6 of 6 
 testing will be compared to the individuals baseline values. Additionally, the various treatment 
doses will be compared at baseline, to ensure randomization allowed for equivalent patient 
groupi[INVESTIGATOR_14839].  
 
Randomization and blinding will be completed by [CONTACT_741250] a block 
randomization scheme (see Sample Randomization in the Supporting Documents Section). The 
randomization scheme will have a block size of 8. Within each block, the randomization is 
classic and 1:1:1:1 between groups.  
 
Changes from baseline will be investigated at each time point using ANOVA. Significance will 
be assumed with p<0.05.

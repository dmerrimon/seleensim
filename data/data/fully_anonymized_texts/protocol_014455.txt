Title:  Pan-Asia U nited States PrEvention of Sudden Cardiac  Death 
Catheter Ablation Trial  (PAUSE- SCD)  
 
Objective:  1) To assess  the inc idence of sudden cardiac death and 
impact of ablation and ICD therapy  vs. ICD therapy 
alone  in Asia, which has not been studied in 
randomized trials except  in the US and Europe.  
2) To explore the impact of preemptive VT ablation 
alone in patients at risk for sudden death 
(observational registry cohort).  
  
Sample Size:  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] s ample size of  120 randomized patients (60 ICD 
and 60 ICD+ablation). Registry is reserved for patients who refuse randomization and received ablation only.  
 
Design:  Prospective, mul ti-center randomized, controlled study.  
 
Clinical Sites:  Approximately 8 -12 ablation centers in Asia  (China, Korea , 
Japan) will participate in the study.  Additional centers may be considered based on the discretion of the principal participating centers.  The anticipated enrollment duration is 24 months for the initial pi[INVESTIGATOR_443658], clinically indicated ICD implantation, NIPS study, and ICD follow up.  
Due to the COVID19 global pandemic, China centers w ere 
shut down and complete access for patient follow -up will 
require an additional 6- 12 months.   Therefore, we are 
requesting one extra year extension for follow  up due to 
these unanticipated circumstances . No statistical review or 
analysis was performed, as follow -up remains incomplete as 
of April,28
th , 2020.  
 
 
Inclusion Criteria : ● Patient is receiving a new ICD or CRT-D implant, that 
has study required programing capabilities and is 
appropriate for remote monitoring. Patient who has received the ICD / CRT -D within 90  days of enrollment 
can also be enrolled.

PAUSE- SCD Trial   Version G 21Jul2021  
8 Intervention : 
 1) ICD with medical management  
 
2) ICD with catheter ablation. Main strategy is scar -
based ablation with targeting of late potentials 
defined as low voltage potentials with fractionated, split, or delayed components   
 
3) Registry on non- randomized patients undergoing 
ablation only.  
 
Study Endpoint:  
 The p rimar y endpoint  is defined as  a composite of  recurrent 
VT, cardiovascular rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and death.  
Prespecified secondary endpoints  include each of the 
individual components of the primary endpoint.  
Comparison of the ablation- only registry with the 
randomized patients will serve as an additional secondary outcome measure.  
 
Length of Study:  
 The trial consists of a 2 -3 year recruitment and 
randomization phase with a 2 year follow -up period.   
Due to the COVID19 global pandemic, China centers were shut down and complete access for patient follow -up 
will require an additional 6- 12 months.   Therefore, we are 
requesting one extra year extension for follow  up due to 
these unanticipated circumstances. No statistical review or analysis was performed, as follow- up remains 
incomplete as of April,28

  2. INTRODUCTION  
  2.1 Background and Rationale  
  Sudden cardiac death (SCD) remains the leading cause of death in the [LOCATION_002], 
totally over 440,[ADDRESS_564337] on mortality.  A recent multicenter study of 2,061 patients by [CONTACT_443677] a 7- fold subsequent risk for mortality and across all stages of heart 
failure, patients that had successful ablation experienced impr oved surviva l.(1)  Only 
two randomized studies have been completed to date, SMASH VT  (2)and V TACH(3), 
demonstrating that early preemptive ablation results in statistically significant reduction 
in subsequent ICD shocks.   A trend towards improved survival was seen in the ablation 
group in SMASH VT.  
  2.[ADDRESS_564338] 
medical therapy.  Additionally, the registry arm which will enroll patients that refuse ICD 
will assess the efficacy of catheter ablation in the absence of background ICD therapy . 
 Additionally, secondary goals of this study include:  
 
1) Increasing SCD awareness in A sia and improv ing clinical follow- up of patients at 
risk. 
2) Assessing  whether SCD is less prevalent in Asia than US and Europe and 
prospectively determine the relative magnitude of benefit of both ICD and ablation.   
3) Determining the composition and etiology of patients referred for ICD and ablation in Asia.  Patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy represent a 
PAUSE- SCD Trial   Version G 21Jul2021  
11 disproportionately sma ll proportion of patients referred for VT ablation, despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a 
high prevalence of coronary artery disease and myocardial infar ction.  Biological 
and cultural differences in scar patterns may account for variations in 
arrhythmogenicity  
  3. STUDY DESIGN  
  3.1 Study Objective  
 The study  is a prospective , multi -center , randomized controlled trial  evaluating the 
efficacy of ICD plus catheter ablation vs. ICD alone in preventing recurrent VT, 
cardiovascular rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and death in patients with  primary and secondary 
indications for ICD  implantation.  
  3.2 Study endpoints  
 The primary efficacy endpoint is defined as freedom from recurrent VT, cardiovascular  
rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , and all -cause mortality through a period of 2 years after the procedure 
(ablation) or randomization (standard medical therapy).   Recurrent VT is  defined as any 
appropriate ICD therapy (shock or ATP) or documented sustained monomorphic VT >30 seconds. Cardiovascular rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_443659] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_443660], procedure- associated complication, or 
arrhythmia- related causes during the follow -up period.  
  3.3 Clinical Centers  
 We anticipate enrollment of 120 patients for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_443661] 8 -12 institutions with 
extensive experience in complex ablation procedures.  As a conservative estimate, enrollment will occur over a 2 year period, with 60 patients per year (7- 8 patients/year at 
each institution).  Additional centers may be cons idered based on clinical competency 
and experience.  
  3.[ADDRESS_564339] Selection

• Patient has a PVC or VT induced cardiomyopathy that is expected to resolve with 
ablation and will not require an ICD

  3.5 Study Design Overview  
 Based on assumptions from t he SMASH VT trial and the AVID study, a 50% reduction 
in events from ablation is projected with a 50% event rate in the control arm at 2 years. 120 patients are required to achieve 80% power to detect a true difference of this 
magnitude with a two -sided al pha error of 0.05.   The primary endpoint is a composite 
that includes cardiovascular rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_9017], which will increase event rates at an estimated 10%/year, individually. (1,4) 
  3.5.1 Randomization  
 Subjects who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be entered into the randomized trial. Randomization will be 1:1 between control group and ablation group. Those randomized to the control group will receive ICD therapy and routine drug therapy (including 
antiarrhythmic drugs as indicated). Subjects randomized to the ablation group will receive ablation therapy  plus ICD for ventricular tachycardia.  Patients that refuse ICD 
therapy and undergo ablation only will be enrolled in a prospective registry.  All primary 
statistical analyses will be performed on an intent -to-treat basis.   
 Central randomization is conducted by [CONTACT_165245]. Prior to 10/12/16, the  
participating sites performed randomization using a table (block size of 4) provided by  
[CONTACT_165245]. After additional in- house statistical review  of the protocol, 
electronic randomization from  the coordinating site was advised. Central electronic  
randomization commenced on 10/12/2016. 25 patients were enrolled using the original 
randomization table schema.  The remaining patients were randomized using electronic 
randomization.

14 3.6 Study Population  
 
 
 
 3.6.1 Randomized Subjects  
 The Intent to Treat (ITT) population includes all randomized subjects. These subjects 
can be included in the randomized trial if they meet all other entry criteria.  
  3.6.[ADDRESS_564340] and follow -up with clinic visits 30 and 36 months to check on their 
overall status  
 
 3.6.3 Discontinued Subjects  
 
• Lost to follow -up: subjects may be lost to follow -up despi[INVESTIGATOR_443663]. A minimum of two (2) attempts (by [CONTACT_230861]) to contact 
[CONTACT_443678] a certified letter will be sent to the last known address. Attempts to contact [CONTACT_242589].  
• Subject/Family request: subjects may voluntarily decide to withdraw from the study with no penalty. If a subject chooses to discontinue participation in the study at the time of a study visit, the required assessments for that visit will be completed. If the subject notifies the clinical center by [CONTACT_335146], he/she may be requested to come in to have a final assessment.  
• Subject’s participation terminated by [CONTACT_10670]: a subject’s participation may be discontinued if the Investigator considers that it is in the subject’s best interest.  
• Subject’s participation terminated by [CONTACT_126463] [CONTACT_32236].  
• Subject Death.  
 If a patient i s discontinued from the study, the reason for discontinuation will be 
documented and the data collected from this subject will be used in the final analysis and treated as censored subject.  
  4. STUDY PROCEDURES  
  4.[ADDRESS_564341] sign the informed consent form prior to randomization or collection of any 
study data. Once randomized, they will be considered enrolled in the study.  The Investigator, Co -Investigator or Research Coordinator and if necessary, any witnesses 
should sign and date the consent as well.  Consented subjects who do not satisfy entry criteria are screen failures and will not be randomized.  
  4.3 Schedule of Vis its and Procedures  
 All subjects participating in the study should follow the schedule of visits as outlined in 
the Table provided.  
  4.4 Pre-Ablation  
 Subjects shall undergo the items outlined for Pre- ablation / baseline in Table 2.  
• Informed Consent  
• Inclusion Exclusion Criteria  
• Medical History  
• TTE (Trans -thoracic echocardiogram). This can be obtained up to six months 
prior to the procedure to assess EF which is standard prior to ICD implant. An MRI or TEE ca n be performed in lieu of a TTE  
• TEE (Trans -esophageal echocardiogram) required if subject has history of LA or 
LV clot and recommended if subject has AF with a CHADS score >1  
• A CT or MRI is strongly recommended within 3 month prior to the ablation 
proced ure to allow for anatomy fusion  
• 12-lead ECG within 6 mo nths prior to the consent visit  
• Assessment of current AAD medication  
• Assessment of current anti -coagulation medication  
  4.5 Ablation Procedure  (Ablation Arm Only) 
  4.5.1 Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_443664]-density mappi[INVESTIGATOR_443665]  (Ensite Velocity, S t Jude 
Medical ). Multipolar  catheters such as duodecapolar multielecrode (Livewire 2- 2-2 mm 
spacing) are strongly encouraged to facilitate high- density mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. (5)  A minimum of 
500 points is strongly encouraged  for each chamber mapped.  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_443666].  
Scar will be defined  as regions of low voltage <1.5 mV with dense scar as <0.5mV.  
  4.5.[ADDRESS_564342] zone of conduction should be targeted by [CONTACT_443679] (Isochronal Late Activation Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]). (6) Activation 
and entrainment mappi[INVESTIGATOR_443667].  If time allows, homogenization is the goal of the procedure, where all other local abnormal electrograms that demonstrate uncoupling are eliminated. (7) 
  4.5.3 Procedural E ndpoints  
 Programmed stimulation is required before the ablation procedure with two cycle lengths (600ms and 400ms up to triple extrastimuli down to VERP or 200 ms).  This may be performed through the implanted ICD (NIPS). A VT is considered clinical if there is a m orphologic match by 12- lead ECG or intracardiac EGM or has a similar 
tachycardia cycle length.   Left ventricular stimulation within scar should be performed if the patient is noninducible with RV stimulation.  Substrate- based ablation strategy 
targeting a bnormal regions of slow conduction can be performed in the event of 
noninducibility.  
 The acute procedural endpoint is noninducibility of the targeted clinical VT and 
elimination of abnormal electrograms within scar.  Programmed stimulation will be perform ed in the same fashion as prior to ablation.  Complete noninducibility is 
encouraged but not required.  
  4.5.4 ICD P rogramming  
 The ICD will be programmed to disable all therapi[INVESTIGATOR_443668].   In the Note section of the devi ce, type the following message:  
 PAUSE- SCD Trial subject. Please contact [physician or coordinator name] at [center 
name] at [center phone] before making any programming changes.  
 Protocol -mandated programmed settings should be confirmed after the device is 
enabled at the conclusion of ablation.  VF zone of 230 bpm (ATP during charging) and 
VT zone 185 or 10 bpm  slower than clinical VT (induced or spontaneous)  with detection 
at 30/4 0 intervals.  (ATPx3) . 
 
 4.5.5 Data Collection during Ablation 
PAUSE- SCD Trial   Version G 21Jul2021  
18  
An ablation procedure form  shall be completed by [CONTACT_73693] , which includes patient 
demographics, number of VTs induced and targeted, predominant strategy, number of VT morphologies terminated during ablation, duration of radiofrequency applications, 
hemodynamic toleration during VT, and scar location and size.  
  4.5.6 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_443669] e through the 
subxiphoid percutaneous approach, provided that surgical backup is present at the time of the ablation.  This can be performed as a combined strategy, where access is obtained prior to any systemic anticoagulation or after reversal of anticoa gulation 
(documentation of ACT<150)  if VT remains inducible after endocardial ablation.  It is recommended to leave in an epi[INVESTIGATOR_443670] >[ADDRESS_564343] overnight observation after ablation.  In 
patients that undergo epi[INVESTIGATOR_313073], an echocardiogram should be performed in the following day.   Subjects shall undergo the following at Pre- Discharge:  
• 12-lead ECG  
• Assessment of AAD medication  
• Assessment  of anti -coagulation medication  
• Assessment of Adverse Events  
 For ICD programming, the following steps will be followed:  
1) Program the device per guidelines outlined:  VF zone of 230 bpm (ATP durin g 
charging) and VT zone 185 or 10 bpm   slower than clinical VT (induced or 
spontaneous) with detection at 30/40 intervals. (ATPx3).  
 2) If the device is not programmed according to the settings recommended and 
unless at discretion of the physician for subject ’s benefit, a Deviation Form and 
any other applicable forms (i.e. Adverse Event or Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_331227]) must be 
completed if not previously submitted.  
 3) Print out the following reports  to be included with procedure form :

arrhythmic medications after ablation are at the discretion of the treating physician.  
 Subjects who have significant LV endocardial ablation and have LV dysfunction should receive anticoagulation for four weeks post -procedure per current guidelines. Other 
subjects with LV endocardial ablation should be considered for ASA. Also any subject who requires anticoagulation for other reasons (e.g. AF) should be maintained on therapeutic anticoagulation.

  5.1 Definitions  
  5.1.1 Adverse Events Definition (AE)  
 An adverse event is any  undesirable clinical occurrence or experience in a subject 
during the course of the study, whether or not it is related to the device or procedure.  
 Each adverse event will be classified by [CONTACT_443680]-serious. This classification of the event determines the reporting procedures to be 
followed. The Investigator will also assess the possible relationship between the adverse event and the investigational device. Adverse events will be followed until they are adequately resolved or deemed unresolvable.  
  5.1.2 Serious Adverse Events Definition (SAE)  
 A serious adverse event is defined as an adverse event that results in:  
A. Death  
B. Serious deterioration in the health of the subject that:  
1) Results in a life -threatening illness or injury;  
2) Results in permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function;  
3) Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] > 24 hours or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059];  
4) Results in medical or surgical interventi on to prevent permanent impairment 
to body structure or a body function.  
 
 
5.1.3 Anticipated Adverse Events  
 The anticipated adver se events provided in section 7.1 (Risks) are believed to represent 
PAUSE- SCD Trial   Version G 21Jul2021  
22 adverse events and complications experienced in either animal and/or clinical studies to 
date with ablation procedures reported in the literature.  
  5.1.4 Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (UADE)  
 An unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) is any serious adverse effect on health or safety, any lif e-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, 
if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in this Investigational Plan; or any other serious problem associated with a  device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects. All UADE events  
should  be reported to the coordinating center as soon as possible (within 24 hours) , but 
in no event later than [ADDRESS_564347] learns of the event.  
  5.2 Handling and Reporting of Adverse Events  
 Adverse events should be recorded in the source documents and on the Adverse Events Form. Non- serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB/EC as required by 
[CONTACT_401671]’s  IRB/EC.  
 If a serious adv erse event or unanticipated adverse device effect  occurs, the 
Invest igator should do the following:  
1) Notify the coordinating center within 24 hours of awareness of death, within 48 hours of awareness of a UADE and within 3 business days of awareness of an 
SAE.  
2) Obtain and maintain applicable medical records such as procedure summary, diagnostic procedure report, discharge summary, etc. in the treatment and follow -
up of the subject.  
3) Provide the coordinating center a complete case history along with the adverse 
event form.  
4) Inform the governing IRB/EC of the serious adverse event, in accordance with the IRB/EC’s reporting requirement.  
 If the site investigator believes that a serious adverse effect is related to study procedures, the coordinating site should be notified within 10 days of the site 
investigator’s knowledge. While the coordinating site will not be responsible for safety 
conduct at the sites, the study team would like remain aware of any unexpected outcomes or risks.  
  
5.[ADDRESS_564348] Death  
 
Notification of death should include a detailed statement of the pertinent events and be signed by [CONTACT_443681](s). It is the site 
investigator’s responsibility to notify the appropriate IRB/EC, in accordance with the 
PAUSE- SCD Trial   Version G 21Jul2021  
23 IRB/EC’s reporting requirements.  
 
If the site investigator believes that the death is related to study procedures,  the 
coordinating site should be notified within 24 hours of the site investiga tor’s knowledge. 
While the coordinating site will not be responsible for safety conduct at the sites, the 
study team would like remain aware of any unexpected outcomes or risks.  
Data communicated should include:  
• Date of death;  
• Prima ry cause (if known);  
• Tempo ral course of death (if known);  
• Any other circu mstances surrounding the death;  
• Whether it w as device or procedure related.  
• Autopsy report (if available)  
 If available, also provide clinical notes and witness statements. Appropriate CRFs must 
also be completed.  
  6. PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
 A protocol deviation is defined as a study related activity that is not in compliance with the protocol or the Investigator Agreement.   Protocol deviations should be tracked and 
managed by [CONTACT_25733], and reported according the site’s IRB/EC policies . 
 Examples of deviations include but are not limited to: a required test not being done or 
not being done within the specified time- frame, a  subject enrolled who did not meet the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, a missed follow -up visit or missed visit window or enrollment 
of a subject without appropriate consent.

  7.[ADDRESS_564350] complex ablation experience (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] >50 per year) and in a fully 
equipped electrophysiology lab. In addition operators and centers should have 
experience in epi[INVESTIGATOR_313073]. Catheter advancement is carefully performed under fluoroscopic guidance in conjunction with internal electrograms and impedance 
PAUSE- SCD Trial   Version G 21Jul2021  
[ADDRESS_564351]’s fluid balance and hemodynamic st atus is 
continuously monitored during ablation. Various displays and alarms are used as 
precautionary measures to warn the physician of the possibility of any undesirable event 
occurring.  
  7.[ADDRESS_564352] identifiers include, but are not limited to: subj ect’s name, 
social security number / unique identification number, and medical record number. Study documents will identify the subject by a subject study identification number . 
  9. STA TISTICAL ANALYSIS  
  9.1 Sample size and power calculation  
 Based on assumptions from the SMASH VT trial and the AVID study, a 50% reduction in events from ablation is projected with a 50% event rate in the control arm at 2 years. 120 patients are required to achieve 80% power to detect a true difference of this 
magnitude with a two -sided alpha error of 0.05.   The primary endpoint is a composite 
that includes cardiovascular rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_9017], which will increase event rates 
at an estimated 10%/year, individually.  
 
 9.2 Primary Endpoint  
 
PAUSE- SCD Trial   Version G 21Jul2021  
26 The primary efficacy endpoint is defined as freedom from recurrent VT, cardiovascular 
rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and all -cause mortality through a period of 2 years after the procedure 
(ablation) or randomization (standard medical therapy).   Recurrent VT is defined as any 
appropriate ICD therapy (shock or ATP) or documented sustained monomorphic VT >30 seconds. Cardiovascular rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_31561] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_443672], procedure- associated complication, or 
arrhythmia- related causes during the follow -up period.  
 Prespecified secondary endpoints  include each of the individual components of the 
primary endpoint.  Comparison of the ablation- only registry with the randomized patients 
will serve as an additional s econdary outcome measure.  
Prespecified subgroup analysis will be performed for patients with RV cardiomyopathy.  
  9.3 Primary Endpoint Analysis  
 The primary endpoint analysis will be a time to event analysis and account for censored observations for all randomized subjects. Intention to treat analysis will be used for this endpoint; the analysis will be “ analyzed as randomized”  regardless of the ac tual 
treatment patients  receive during the follow -up period. Kaplan- Meier (1958) estimates of 
the primary endpoint and overall survival will be generated along with 95% confidence intervals for the median time to event or death (Brookmeyer and Crowley, 1982) .(8,9)  
Log-rank test will be used to compare the hazard functions between the two groups. 
Cox (1972) regression models will be fit to assess and adjust for baseline covariates. (10)  The median time to VT recurrence as well as the 95% confidence 
interval s will be reported for both groups . The event free survival probability as well as 
the 95% confidence intervals at the 24- month follow -up for both groups will be 
presented.   Adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_443682] -square or Fisher exact tests.   
 Secondary analyses comparing outcomes in the ICD+ablation and ICD arms vs. the registry patients (ablation only) will be performed in a similar manner to those described above.  
 Interim analyses will be g enerated by [CONTACT_443683].  A Peto- Haybittle 
efficacy monitoring boundary will be used:  if the p- value for the difference between 
groups is <0.001, early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_443673].  Using this monitoring bound, the p- value for statistical significance at the final analysis will remain at the 
nominal 0.[ADDRESS_564353] a copy of the IRB/EC approval letter for each site, as 
well as a copy of the final approved informed consent  before randomization can begin.  
The coordinating site will collect a final complete data set from each site, and may work 
with the sites regarding any questions or outstanding data elements.  
 Upon inspection of the final data set, the coordinating site may request to see source  
documentation, reports of protocol deviations or adverse events if needed to verify data elements.  
  11. INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD AND ETHICS COMMITTEE  
 The study protocol  must be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_233556]/Ethics Committee before subject enrollment may begin. Proposed changes to the protocol must be reviewed by [CONTACT_443684] [INVESTIGATOR_443674] / Ethics 
Committee. A significant change is one which may increase risks or present a new risk to the subject, or which may adversely affect the scientific validity of the study. Each investigator must sign t he protocol amendment before implementing the change at 
his/her center.  
 IRB/EC approval is required for each institution participating in this investigation. Prior to enrollment, a signed copy of the Institutional Review Board approval letter addressed to the investigator must be submitted to the coordinating site certifying study approval. 
Investigators are responsible for obtaining and maintaining approval of the study by [CONTACT_1201]/EC. Annual review and approvals for continuation of the trial at each center must also be forwarded to the lead site where they will be submitted to coordinating site’s  IRB 
at the time of continuing review, per IRB policy .  Correspondence with the IRB/EC 
should be retained at the center. Adverse events and protocol deviations must be reported per IRB/EC requirements.  
  12. STATEMENT OF CO MPLIANCE  
 The clinical investigation shall be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and ISO [ZIP_CODE].  
These principles protect the rights, safety, and well -being of human subjects, which are

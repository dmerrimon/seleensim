VERSION:  [ADDRESS_1282291]:  Risdiplam (RO7034067)  
PHASE:  I 
 
RATIONALE  
Part 1 of this study will investigate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of multiple 
oral doses of risdiplam administered once daily ( QD) for 14 days to healthy participants. To 
date, risdiplam has not been investigated as a multiple- dose QD regimen in healthy participants; 
all previous Phase I studies have been single-dose studies. The PK and safety data collected in 
Part [ADDRESS_1282292] of multiple oral 
doses of risdiplam on the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single oral 
dose of midazolam in healthy 
participants.  Midazolam concentrations and thereof 
derived PK parameters for midazolam (and its metabolite[s] as appropriate) 
alone and in combination with risdiplam.  
Secondary  
To assess the safety and tolerability of a 
single oral dose of midazolam alone and in combination with multiple oral doses of 
risdiplam in healthy participants.  
 Incidence and severity of adverse events 
(AEs); changes in vital signs, physical 
findings, electrocardiogram (ECG) 
parameters, and clinical laboratory test 
results during and after midazolam administration alone and in combination 
with risdiplam.

Protocol BP41361, Version 1 2. INTRODUCTION 
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB)1 for detailed information concerning the 
available pharmacology, toxicology, drug metabolism, clinical studies, and adverse event 
(AE) profile of the investigational medicinal product (IMP). 
2.1 OVERVIEW OF THE DISEASE  
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_11902] (SMA) is an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder characterized by [CONTACT_912707].
2,[ADDRESS_1282316], leading to skeletal muscle weakness and atrophy. Muscle weakness and atrophy are symmetrical and progressive, often impacting the legs more than the arms, eventually leading to a decline in intercostal muscle strength. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_912692].
5  
SMA  is caused by [CONTACT_703147] (95% of cases) or mutation of the survival motor 
neuron (SMN)1  gene.6 In humans, there are 2 SMN genes (telomeric SMN1  gene and 
centromeric SMN2  gene), which originated from an intrachromosomal duplication of 
5q13 and subsequent divergence due to genetic drift. Species, other than humans, have only 1 SMN  gene, which is equivalent to the human SMN1  gene. SMN2  differs from 
SMN1  by [CONTACT_46917] a translationally synonymous C→T mutation at nucleotide 6 in 
exon 7. As a result of this, the SMN2  pre-mRNA undergoes alternative splicing which 
excludes exon 7 from 85% to 90% of SMN2  transcripts, which produces an unstable 
SMN∆7 protein that is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_500336].
7 In the remaining 10% to 15% of splicing 
events, the full -length SMN2  mRNA is generated, leading to the production of functional 
full-length SMN protein. Accordingly, patients with SMA lacking a functioning SMN1  
gene are dependent on their SMN2  gene and SMA is the consequence of decreased, 
insufficient levels of full -length functional SMN protein which is produced only by [CONTACT_912708]2  gene.8  
2.2 OVERVIEW OF RISDIPLAM 
There is currently no approved oral treatment that provides stabilization or improvement of motor function to patients with SMA. One of the promising strategies currently being pursued is to increase SMN protein levels in patients with SMA by [CONTACT_490810]2  
splicing to favor the inclusion of exon 7 into the mRNA transcript, thus increasing 
expression of stable full -length protein from the SMN2  gene.
8,9 One such compound 
currently being developed is risdiplam (RO7034067), which directly targets the underlying molecular deficiency of SMA, to promote the inclusion of exon 7 to generate 
full-length SMN2  mRNA, increasing the production of functional SMN protein. The 
 
Risdiplam (RO7034067) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  Page 19  
Protocol BP41361, Version 1 increase in SMN protein following treatment with risdiplam has been shown in fibroblasts 
and motor neurons derived from patients with SMA, and in clinical trials in patients with SMA. 
2.2.1 Summary of Clinical Experience 
The Phase I development of risdiplam comprised 3 completed studies in healthy 
subjects: a single-ascending dose study including an exploratory investigation of the effect of food and an itraconazole interaction part (Study  BP29840), a study to 
investigate potential differences in the pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety and tolerability of risdiplam in healthy Japanese subjects compared with Caucasians (Study  NP39625), 
and a mass balance study (Study  BP39122). 
Currently, 3 clinical studies in patients with SMA are ongoing: a study in children and 
young adults with Type 2 and Type 3 SMA (Study  BP39055) and in infants with Type 1 
SMA (Study  BP39056), and an exploratory study in patients with SMA previously treated 
with another SMA therapy (Study  BP39054). A study to assess the efficacy, safety and 
tolerability, and PK/pharmacodynamic s of risdiplam in pre-symptomatic infants 
genetically diagnosed with SMA is in preparation. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety  
In Study BP29840, single doses of risdiplam administered alone at doses of 0.6 mg, 
2 mg, 6 mg, and 18 mg, or 6 mg in combination with itraconazole were well tolerated in 
healthy male subjects. There were no deaths, serious adverse events (SAEs), or withdrawals due to AEs. Overall, 27 AEs were reported, all of which were mild in 
intensity and resolved within a short period of time without sequelae. With the exception of 2 AEs (pollakiuria [placebo] and headache [18  mg risdiplam]), all events were 
considered by [CONTACT_912709]. The most frequently affected system organ class was gastrointestinal (GI) disorders (9  AEs) and nervous system 
disorders (4 AEs). The most frequently reported AEs were headache (4 subjects) and 
diarrhea, abdominal pain, and nasopharyngitis (3 subjects each). There were no 
dose-related increases in the incidence or severity of reported AEs and no cluster of AEs indicative of a toxic effect of the compound on a given organ system. Although there were no safety findings  at any dose administered, dose escalation was stopped at 
18 mg, as the protocol -specified plasma exposure cap of 1500 h.ng/mL for area under 
the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to 24 hours postdose on an 
individual basis for healthy subjects only was approached with this dose.  
Study NP39625 in healthy Japanese subjects demonstrated that single oral doses of risdiplam at 2 mg, 6 mg, and 12 mg were well tolerated with no marked differences in the 
safety profile between Japanese and Caucasian subjects. There were no SAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal from the study, or severe AEs reported. Overall, 12 AEs were 
reported, of which 10 were visual AEs reported in 6 subjects (visual acuity reduced in 
2 subjects who received placebo; bilateral cataracts and visual acuity reduced, and 
bilateral cataracts and vision blurred in 2 subjects who received 6 mg risdiplam; and 
 
Risdiplam (RO7034067) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  Page 20  
Protocol BP41361, Version 1 visual acuity reduced in 2 subjects who received 12 mg risdiplam). The events of visual 
acuity reduced in the placebo and [ADDRESS_1282317] from the central reader 
Optic Nerve Research Center assessed that the findings were pre-existing cataracts that 
had worsened, which is in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_912693]. No evidence was observed suggesting that the AEs of vision blurred or the worsened cataracts were related to the study medication. The Sponsor assessed the events as unrelated to study medication based on asymmetrical findings in both eyes, exposure to a single dose of study medication, no similar findings in other patients exposed to multiple doses (caveat higher age/Asian ethnicity), no findings in the previous healthy subject study with single ascending doses up to 18 mg (Study  BP29840), no preclinical findings in lens, 
consideration that cataracts appear significantly earlier in Asians compared to Caucasians and therefore the study subject was at significant risk for cataract irrespective of study therapy.  
In Study  BP39122, a single oral dose of 18 mg of [
14C/12C]-risdiplam was well tolerated 
in healthy male subjects. All [ADDRESS_1282318] frequent being 
dry skin (3  subjects). There were no severe AEs or AEs leading to withdrawal from study 
treatment. One subject reported an SAE of pneumonia, which was assessed by [CONTACT_912710]. 
In none of these studies were there any clinically significant treatment or 
dose-dependent changes compared with baseline in vital signs, electrocardiograms 
(ECGs), laboratory parameters, or ophthalmological assessments. 
Risdiplam has, so far, been well tolerated in the 3 currently ongoing clinical studies in 
patients with SMA, with a treatment duration of up to more than 1 year (with once daily 
[QD] administration). For further information, refer to the IB.

[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetics 
In the completed single- ascending dose study (including exploratory investigation of the 
effect of food and itraconazole interaction) in healthy adults (Study BP29840), risdiplam 
was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_19627] a median time of maximum observed plasma concentration 
(Tmax) between 2 and 3 hours postdose under fasted conditions. The maximum observed 
plasma concentration (C max) and AUC increased in a dose- proportional manner. The 
apparent plasma terminal elimination half-life (t ½) was approximately 41 hours to 
64 hours. On average, a small fraction (<10%) of the administered dose was excreted 
unchanged into urine. Food had no relevant effect on the PK of risdiplam; only median T
max was delayed to 4.[ADDRESS_1282319] on the PK of a 
single oral dose of risdiplam resulting in an increase (11%) of the AUC from time zero to 
120 hours postdose and a reduction (9%) of the C max. 
 
Risdiplam (RO7034067) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  Page 21  
Protocol BP41361, Version 1 A mass balance study (Study  BP39122) with single-dose administration of 
[14C/12C]-risdiplam was conducted in healthy adult subjects. The mean overall recovery 
of total administered [14C]-radioactivity was 81.4%, ranging from 60.3% to 89.6%. The 
major pathway of elimination of [14C]-radioactivity was fecal excretion with, on average, 
53.2% of the dose administered; urinary excretion of [14C]-radioactivity accounted for , on 
average, 28.2% of the dose administered. 
Study NP39625 demonstrated no relevant differences in plasma or urine PK parameters, 
or the pharmacodynamic effects of risdiplam on SMN mRNA and SMN protein, between 
Japanese and Caucasian healthy subjects.  
M1 was confirmed as the major metabolite in patients with SMA, but it is not 
pharmacologically active. The median M1-to-parent ratio of all trough samples was 
approximately 30% with no apparent dose, time, body weight, or age dependency.

An in vitro signal for time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A by [CONTACT_912712]. The assessment of time-dependent inhibition in vivo requires multiple-dose administration of risdiplam for 2 weeks as QD dosing. To date, however, risdiplam has 
not been investigated as a multiple-dose regimen in  healthy participants; all previous  
Phase I studies have been single-dose studies . Therefore, Part [ADDRESS_1282321] of multiple doses  of risdiplam on the PK of

2.4 BACKGROUND  
2.4.1 Background on Risdiplam  
Refer to Section 2.1 for an overview of the disease SMA  and to Section 2.2  for an 
overview of risdiplam.  
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy , and safety of risdiplam  is 
provided in the IB.1

Protocol BP41361, Version 1 2.4.2 Background on Midazolam  
Midazolam is a short-ac ting benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. Midazolam is the paradigm marker 
substrate for the in vivo assessment of CYP3A activity recommended by [CONTACT_4469] (FDA ) and European Medicines Agency ( EMA ).[ADDRESS_1282322]-pass metabolism. Midazolam is primarily metabolized in the liver and gut by [CONTACT_143025]3A to its pharmacologically active metabolite 1-OH -midazolam. In the subsequent UDP -glucuronosyltransferase-mediated phase II-
reaction, the main urinary metabolite 1’ -OH-midazolam -glucuronide is formed; 63% to 
80% of the dose is found conjugated in the urine within 24 hours, while only 1% is 
excreted unchanged. The mean t
½ of midazolam ranges from 2.[ADDRESS_1282323] to change, while by [CONTACT_912713], only the systemic clearance will be affected.  
Pharmacodynamic properties of midazolam and its metabolites include sedative, anxiolytic, amnesic, and  hypnotic activities. Benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_912694] γ -amino butyric acid

An oral dose of 2 mg of midazolam will be used in this study.  
2.5 BENEFIT/RISK ASSESSM ENT 
Participants  in the current study will not receive any health benefit (beyond that of an 
assessment of their medical status) from participating in the study. The risks of participation are primarily those associated with adverse reactions to the study treatments, although there may also be some discomfort from collection of blood samples and other study procedures. However, the potential risks for any participant due to the treatment with risdiplam, midazolam (applicable to patients enrolled in Part 2  
only), or study -related procedures are considered minimal and are outweighed by [CONTACT_912714][INVESTIGATOR_007] a new oral treatment for SMA.  
To minimize any potential risk, participants will be carefully selected in line with eligibility 
criteria and closely monitored for  safety and will be under continuous medical 
observation during the course of the study.

4. STUDY DESIGN 
4.1 OVERALL DESIGN  
This will be a Phase I, 2 -part, open-label, non-randomized study to investigate the 
safety, tolerability, and PK of a multiple -dosing regimen of risdiplam (QD; Part 1) and the 
effect of risdiplam on the PK of midazolam (Part 2) following oral administration in 
healthy adult male and female participants.  
 
Risdiplam (RO7034067) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  Page 24  
Protocol BP41361, Version 1 In total a maximum of 40 participants may be enrolled in this study as follows: 
• Part 1: [ADDRESS_1282325] 6 evaluable 
participants.  
• Part 2: [ADDRESS_1282326] results (i.e., hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis) collected up to (and including) [ADDRESS_1282327] study drug administration and available plasma PK data up to (and including) [ADDRESS_1282328] study drug administration from a minimum of 4 Part 1 participants. The risdiplam dose in Part 2 will be determined based on the PK and safety data obtained in Part 1, with the aim to achieve an average exposure (mean AUC over a dosing interval  [AUC
tau] at steady  
state) of 2000 ng.h/mL in Part 2 (i.e., the therapeutic exposure observed in SMA 
patients ). 
A Dose Escalation Meeting will be conducted prior to the start of Part 2 (see 
Section 4.1.1), in order to evaluate the Part [ADDRESS_1282329] the risdiplam dose to be 
administered in Part 2 of this study . 
In Part 2, all study participants will receive a single oral dose of 2 mg midazolam on Day 1. On Day 3, the 14-day QD treatment period with risdiplam will begin (targeting a 
mean AUC
tau at steady  state of 2000 ng.h/mL; the precise dose will be based on the 
results of Part 1), with single dose administration of 2 mg midazolam again on Day 15 (1 hour after the thirteenth dose of risdiplam). 
In both study parts, PK blood samples will be collected at timepoints specified in T able 1. 
Safety monitoring will be performed throughout the study as described in Section 8.2.

circumstances occurs in participants treated with 5 mg risdiplam in Part 1, unless it is obvious that the occurrence is not related to the administration of risdiplam.  
• Severe AEs of the same type in ≥  50% of participants.  
• Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities of the same type in ≥ 50% of 
participants.  
• Clinically significant changes in ECGs of the same type in ≥  50% participants.  
• Other findings, which at the joint discretion of the Sponsor Clinical Pharmacologist 
and the Investigator, indicate that the dose in Part 2 should not be increased. 
 
4.1.3 Individual Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_912697] a given individual participant if, compared to baseline (as 
applicable), 1 of the following circumstances occurs, unless it is obvious that the 
occurrence is not related to the administration of risdiplam:

• Any elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >  3 x upper limit of normal (ULN), 
with an associated increase in bilirubin > [ADDRESS_1282333], and with a spartate 
aminotransferase (AST) < [ADDRESS_1282334], in the absence of an alternative explanation.  
• Other findings that, at the joint discretion of the Sponsor Clinical Pharmacologist and 
the Investigator, indicate that dosing should be stopped. 
 
4.1.4 Communication Strategy  
In Part 1, there will be an ongoing review of available data. A dose-decision meeting will be conducted between the Sponsor study team and the Investigator prior to start of 
Part 2. 
 
 
Risdiplam (RO7034067) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  Page 26  
Protocol BP41361, Version 1 4.1.5 Length of the Study  
The total duration of the study for each participant will be up to approximately 8 weeks 
divided as follows:  
• Screening: Up to 27 days (Days -28 to -2). 
• In clinic period: Day  -1 to Day 16 (Part 1) or Day -1 to Day 18 (Part 2) . 
• Non-residential visits: Days 18 and 20 (Part 1) or Days 20 and 22 (Part 2). 
• Safety Follow -up (Post-study): 10±[ADDRESS_1282335] of multiple doses of risdiplam on the PK of the sensitive CYP3A substrate midazolam will be assessed, at a risdiplam dose targeting a mean AUC
tau at 
steady  state of 2000 h.ng/mL, which is the therapeutic exposure observed in SMA 
patients.  
The seamless transition between the [ADDRESS_1282336] of multiple oral doses of risdiplam (QD) on the PK of midazolam, a 
substrate specific for the drug-metabolizing CYP isozyme CYP3A, will be explored. The dose of risdiplam in Part 2 will be selected based on all available data from a minimum of 4 participants from Part 1. 
4.2.1 Rationale for Study Population 
Healthy male participants and female participants of non-childbearing potential aged 18 to 55 years (inclusive) were chosen because of the absence of potentially 
confounding disease processes, which will lead to a clearer and more consistent assessment of drug safety, tolerability, and pharmacological activity. H ealthy participants 
are unlikely to require concomitant medication which could have an impact on the PK of 
 
Risdiplam (RO7034067) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  Page 27  
Protocol BP41361, Version 1 risdiplam  and/or midazolam, respectively, or on the assessment of a potential DDI  
between these 2 compounds, which is the primary objective of this study . 
4.2.2 Rationale for Pharmacokinetic Assessments 
Pharmacokinetic assessment of risdiplam and midazolam concentrations, and their  
metabolite(s) if appropriate, in plasma are included in the study. The times of PK sample 
collection are based on previous  studies and are considered adequate to allow 
characterization of the drug’s PK after oral dosing. Furthermore, sample collection up to 144 hours postdose for risdiplam and up to 24 hours postdose for midazolam  is 
anticipated to be sufficient to allow reasonable estimation of half-life  during the terminal 
elimination phase.  
4.3 JUSTIFICATION  FOR D OSE  
4.3.1 Risdiplam  
Safety data of risdiplam in healthy subjects from the dedicated clinical pharmacology studies (BP29840, BP39122, and NP39625) demonstrated that single oral doses of risdiplam up to [ADDRESS_1282337] been safe and well tolerated in healthy subjects without 
relevant safety concerns. Treatment with risdiplam up to 5 mg QD for more than 1 year 
has been safe and well tolerated in patients with SMA in the currently ongoing clinical studies. Further  details are provided in the IB.
1 The dose of 5 mg risdiplam is the 
therapeutic dose administered to adult patients with SMA  in the ongoing pi[INVESTIGATOR_912698]. The exposure observed at this dose is a mean AUC
tau at steady state of 2000 ng.h/mL. In order to evaluate the potential for DDI , 
the dose administered in Part 2 will therefore target a mean AUC tau at steady state of 
2000 ng.h/mL . 
The duration of risdiplam dosing of 14 days is required, and is considered to be sufficient, to evaluate the potential for time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A by [CONTACT_912715].  
4.3.2 Midazolam  
Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. It has been selected because it is exclusively metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A, is not a substrate of P -glycoprotein, and it has been 
validated in a number of studies  as a CYP3A substrate. It is recommended as the 
sensitive model substrate for CYP3A by [CONTACT_17513] (e.g., the FDA and EMA ) 
and is the most widely used CYP3A probe substrate.
[ADDRESS_1282338] of possible inhibition of intestinal and liver CYP3A. 
A midazolam dose of 2 mg has been selected for Part 2 of this study because this dose 
is expected to yield midazolam plasma concentrations sufficient to adequately capture midazolam PK outcomes.

The end of the study is defined as the date when the last participant last visit  (LPLV) 
occurs.  
5. STUDY POPULATION

PARTICIPANT DISCONTI NUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
Details on study and site closures are provided in Appendix  1. 
7.1 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY TREATMENT  
See the SoA (Section 1.2) for data to be collected at the time of treatment 
discontinuation/Early Termination and Follow -up and for any further evaluations that 
need to be completed. 
Every effort should be made to obtain information on participants who withdraw from the 
study but have not withdrawn consent. Participants who discontinue study treatment prematurely will be asked to return to the clinic for a Study Completion/Early Termination 
visit (see Section 8.11.3) and may undergo follow -up assessments (see Section 8.11.4), 
unless the participant withdrew consent. The primary reason for premature study treatment discontinuation should be documented on the appropriate eCRF. Participants who discontinue study treatment prematurely may be replaced depending on the reason 
for discontinuation, as defined in Section 7.2 below . 
7.2 PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM THE 
STUDY  
Participants have the right to voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time for any 
reason.  
In addition, the Investigator has the right to withdraw a participant from the study for 
medical conditions that the Investigator or Sponsor determines may jeopardize the participant’s safety if he/she continues in the study.  
If possible, information on reason for withdrawal from the study should be obtained. The primary reason for withdrawal from the study should be documented on the appropriate eCRF. Participants will not be followed for any reason after consent has been withdrawn. 
When a participant voluntarily withdraws from the study, or is withdrawn by [CONTACT_737], samples collected until the date of withdrawal will be analyzed, unless the participant specifically requests for these to be discarded or local laws require their immediate destruction. However, if samples have been tested prior to withdrawal, results from those tests will be used as part of the overall research data.

required study visit: 
• The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_14315], counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the 
assigned visit schedule, and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to 
and/or should continue in the study. 
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the Investigator or designee must 
make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635]. These contact [CONTACT_78779]’s medical record. 
• Should the participant continue to be unreachable, they  will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study.  
Discontinuation of sites or of study as a whole are handled as part of Appendix  1. 
8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
Study procedures and th eir timepoints  are summarized in the SoA (Section 1.2). 
Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed.  
Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the Sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study treatment. Such consultation should be adequately documented and archived in 
the site file.  
The maximum amount of blood collected from each participant will not exceed 500 mL. 
Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issues with the samples. 
8.1 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
Not applicable. 
8.2 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS

assessments, vital signs,  and ECGs; and other protocol -specified tests that are deemed 
critical to the safety evaluation of the study. 
8.2.1 Physical Examinations 
• A complete physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the 
cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], GI , dermatological,  and musculoskeletal systems in 
addition to the head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, neck , and lymph nodes. Height, 
weight, and BMI will also be calculated and recorded at specified times . Further 
examination of other body systems may be performed in case of evocative 
symptoms at the Investigator’s discretion.  
• A brief physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the skin, lungs, cardiovascular system, and abdomen (liver and spleen). 
• Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses.  
The physical exam will NOT include pelvic, rectal, or  breast exams.  
Any abnormality identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical 
History and Baseline Conditions eCRF. 
As clinically indicat ed, limited, symptom -directed physical examinations should be 
performed. Changes from baseline abnormalities should be recorded in the participant’s 
notes. New or worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as AEs 
on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
8.2.2 Vital Signs  
Temperature, PR, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be assessed as outlined 
in the SoA (see Section 1.2). 
Blood pressure and pulse measurements will be assessed in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_103645] a completely automated device. Manual techniques will be used only if an automated device is not available. When possible, the same arm and device should be used for all blood pressure measurements. 
Blood pressure and pulse measurements should be preceded by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_1282356] for the participant in a quiet setting without distractions (e.g., television, cell phones). 
8.2.3 Electrocardiograms 
Single 12-lead ECG s will be obtained as outlined in the SoA (see Section 1.2) using an 
ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, 
and QTc  intervals. 
 
Risdiplam (RO7034067) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  Page 39

≥10 minutes prior to each ECG evaluation. Supi[INVESTIGATOR_912700]. Environmental distractions (e.g., television, radio, conversation) should be avoided during the pre-ECG resting period and during ECG recording. Electrocardiograms  should be performed prior 
to any scheduled vital signs  measurements and blood draws. 
 
8.2.[ADDRESS_1282357] be conducted in accordance with the SoA (Section 1.2). 
The Investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the e CRF. The 
laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents.  
• In the event of unexplained abnormal clinically significant laboratory test values, the 
tests should be repeated immediately and followed up until they have returned to the normal range and/or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found. 
• If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged 
reasonable by [CONTACT_737], the etiology should be identified within participant’s  
standard of care and the Sponsor notified.  
 
Results of clinical laboratory testing will be recorded on the eCRF or be received as 
electronically -produced laboratory reports submitted directly from the local laboratory. 
Additional blood or urine samples may be taken at the discretion of the Investigator if the results of any test fall outside the reference ranges  and deemed clinically  significant by 
[CONTACT_737], or clinical symptoms necessitate additional testing to monitor participant safety. 
Where the clinical significance of abnormal laboratory  results at Screening is  considered 
uncertain, screening lab oratory  tests may be repeated to confirm eligibility  once at 
Day -1. 
8.2.5 Medical History and Demographic Data 
Medical history includes clinically significant diseases and all medications (e.g., 
prescription drugs, OTC drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by [CONTACT_78772] 30 days prior to the Screening visit. 
Demographic data will include age, sex, and self‑reported race/ethnicity.  
8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT S 
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix  2. The non-serious AESIs 
(NSAESIs) are discussed in Section 8.3.6. 
 
Risdiplam (RO7034067) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  Page 40  
Protocol BP41361, Version 1 The Investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for ensuring that all AEs 
(including assessment of seriousness, severity, and causality; see Appendix  2) are 
recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported to the Sponsor in accordance with instructions provided in this section and in Appendix  2. 
Procedures used for recording AEs are provided in Appendix 3 : 
• Diagnosis versus signs and symptoms  
• AEs occurring secondary to other events  
• Persistent or recurrent AEs  
• Abnormal laboratory values  
• Abnormal vital signs  values  
• Abnormal liver function tests  
• Deaths  
• Pre-existing medical conditions  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912701]. 
 
8.3.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting Adverse Event and 
Serious Adverse Event Information 
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix  2 and 
Appendix  3 as applicable. 
Investigators will seek information on AEs at each participant’s contact. All AEs , whether 
reported by [CONTACT_260060], will be recorded in the participant’s medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF as follows: 
After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study treatment , 
only SAEs caused by a protocol -mandated intervention as judged by [CONTACT_912719]. Any other AE should not be reported. 
After initiation of study treatment , all AEs, regardless of relationship to study 
treatment, will be reported until the Follow -up visit. 
Post -study AEs and SAEs : The Investigator is not required to actively monitor 
participants for AEs after the end of the AE reporting period (after the F ollow -up v isit, 
defined as 10± [ADDRESS_1282358] final dose of study treatment; see SoA [Section 1.2]). 
However, if the Investigator learns of any SAE (including a death) or other AEs of 
concern that are believed to be related to prior treatment with study treatment, at any 
time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and the Investigator considers the event to be reasonably related to the study treatment or study 
 
Risdiplam (RO7034067) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  Page [ADDRESS_1282359] promptly notify the Sponsor. For the procedure of 
reporting, see Appendix  2. 
8.3.2 Method of Detecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse 
Events  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence.  
A consistent methodology of non-directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting AE information at all participant evaluation timepoints. 
8.3.3 Follow -up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Investigator Follow -up 
The Investigator should follow each AE until the event has resolved to baseline grade or 
better, the event is assessed as stable by [CONTACT_737], the event is otherwise 
explained, the participant is lost to follow-up (Section 7.3), or the participant withdraws 
consent. Every effort should be made to follow all SAEs considered to be related to 
study treatment or trial -related procedures until a final outcome can be reported. 
During the study period, resolution of AEs (with dates) should be documented on the 
Adverse Event eCRF and in the participant’s medical record to facilitate source data verification. If, after Follow -up, return to baseline status or stabilization cannot be 
established, an explanation should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
All pregnancies reported during the study should be followed until pregnancy outcome and reported according to the instructions provided in Section 8.3.5. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Sponsor Follow -up 
For SAEs , NSAESIs , and pregnancies, the Sponsor or a designee may follow -up by 
[CONTACT_756], fax, electronic mail, and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details and outcome information (e.g., from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8838], consultant reports, 
autopsy reports) in order to perform an independent medical assessment of the reported case.  
8.3.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse 
Events  
Prompt notification by [CONTACT_76885] a study treatment under clinical investigation are met. 
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and 
other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study treatment under clinical 
 
Risdiplam (RO7034067) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  Page 42  
Protocol BP41361, Version 1 investigation. The Sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements 
relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRBs/IECs , and I nvestigators.  
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to Investigators as necessary.  
An Investigator who receives an I nvestigator safety report describing an SAE or other 
specific safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will review and file it along with the IB  and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to 
local requirements. 
For immediate and expedited reporting requirements from Investigator to Sponsor and 
from Sponsor to Health Authority, Investigators, and IRB/EC, see Appendix 2 .

8.3.5 Pregnancy 
Male participants  will be instructed through the Informed Consent Form  to immediately 
inform the Investigator if their partner becomes pregnant during the study or within 90 days after the final dose of study drug. 
If a pregnancy is reported, the Investigator should inform the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
learning of the pregnancy and should follow the pregnancy reporting process as detailed in Appendix  5. 
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs ( Appendix  5). 
8.3.[ADDRESS_1282361]  
Non-serious AESIs are required to be reported by [CONTACT_144391] (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Appendix  2 for 
reporting instructions).  
Non-serious AESIs for this study include the following: 
• Cases of an elevated ALT or aspartate aminotransferase ( AST) in combination with 
either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined in Appendix  3. 
• Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by [CONTACT_104841], as defined 
below:

Protocol BP41361, Version 1 Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting 
transmissible spongiform  encephalopathy), pathogenic or non-pathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent. A transmission of an infectious agent may be suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an infection in a participant  exposed to a medicinal product. This term applies only  
when a contamination of the study treatment is suspected.

Decisions regarding dose-interruptions or modifications (if applicable) will be made by 
[CONTACT_912720]. Such consultation should be adequately documented and archived in 
the site file.  
In the event of an overdose, the Investigator should: 
1. Contact [CONTACT_1034]’s Medical Monitor immediately. 
2. Closely monitor the participant for AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities until 
resolved. 
3. Obtain a blood sample for PK analysis if requested by [CONTACT_1689] (determined on a case-by -case basis). 
4. Document the quantity of the excess dose, as well as the duration of the overdose, in the e CRF (recorded in the comments of the AE or as additional observations). 
 
8.5 PHARMACOKINETICS 
Mandatory blood samples to evaluate concentrations of study treatment (and its 
metabolite[s], if appropriate) will be  collected. The date and time of each sample 
collection will be recorded in the eCRF. Risdiplam and midazolam  (Part 2 only) l evels 
will be analyzed by [CONTACT_912721]. The PK samples will be taken as outlined in 
the Schedules of Activities tables (see Section 1.2). During the course of the study, PK 
sampling timepoints  may be modified on the basis of emerging data to ensure the PK of 
study treatment can be adequately characterized. Metabolites may be measured by a

Sections  8.3.1 and 8.3.3. 
9. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS 
9.1 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION  
In total a maximum of 40 participants  may be enrolled in this study as follows: 
• Part 1: 8 participants will be enrolled in order to obtain 6 evaluable participants. The 
Part 1 sample size was determined by [CONTACT_912723]. 
• Part 2: [ADDRESS_1282366] 
coefficient of variation of 26% and 35% for AUC extrapolated to infinity ( AUC inf) and 
Cmax of midazolam, respectively, from a previous clinical study.13 A sample size of 
26 evaluable participants ensures that the two-sided 90% confidence interval for the 
geometric population mean of the individual exposure ratios of Day [ADDRESS_1282367] 80% probability (power) . 
The additional 4 participants are in case the dropout rate in Part 2 is higher than 
expected in order to achieve 26 evaluable participants.  
 
Risdiplam (RO7034067) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  Page [ADDRESS_1282368] values will be presented in International System of Units (SI units; Système International d’Unités) by [CONTACT_260063].  Summaries of clinical 
laboratory tests will also be used, as appropriate.  
Vital signs  Vital signs data will be presented by [CONTACT_852514]. In additi on, 
tabular summaries will be used, as appropriate.  
ECG data analysis  ECG data will be presented by [CONTACT_260065]. In addition, tabular summaries will be used, as appropriate.

Protocol BP41361, Version 1 Concomitant 
medications  The original terms recorded on the participant s’ eCRF by [CONTACT_436280] 
a mapped term and appropriate drug dictionary level . 
Concomitant medications will be presented in summary tables and listings.  
 
9.3.2 Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Analyses will be carried out on the PK analysis population. All PK parameters will be 
presented by [CONTACT_375484] ( arithmetic mean, standard 
deviation, geometric mean, geometric coefficient of variation, median, minimum, and 
maximum).  For T max, only the median, minimum, and maximum values will be presented. 
Pharmacokinetic  parameters will be read directly from the plasma concentration-time 
profiles, or calculated using standard non-compartmental methods.  
The following PK parameters will be computed for risdiplam and its metabolite(s) as 
appropriate and midazolam and its metabolite(s) as appropriate. Other PK parameters might be computed in addition as appropriate.  
• T
max  Time of maximum observed plasma concentration 
• C max  Maximu m observed plasma concentration 
• C trough  Trough observed plasma concentration 
• AUC tau Area under the plasma concentration -time curve over a dosing interval  
• AUC last Area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time [ADDRESS_1282369] quantifiable concentration (t last) 
• AUC inf Area under the plasma concentration -time curve extrapolated to infinity  
• λz  Apparent terminal elimination rate constant  
• t ½  Apparent plasma terminal elimination half-life  
• CLss/F Apparent total plasma clearance at s teady  state 
• AR AUC Accumulation ratio for AUC  
• AR Cmax Accumulation ratio for C max 
No formal statistical analyses are planned for Part 1. 
In Part 2, the effect of multiple oral doses of risdiplam  on the PK of a single oral dose of 
midazolam (and its  metabolite[s] as appropriate) will be explored using an analysis of 
variance applied to the log-transformed PK parameters C max and AUC inf (or, if AUC inf 
 
Risdiplam (RO7034067) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  Page [ADDRESS_1282370] or an alternate partial AUC from time zero to a 
common postdose time, AUC 0-t). The model will include treatment as a fixed effect and 
subject as a random effect. From the model estimates, the geometric mean ratios 
(midazolam alone versus midazolam in combination with risdiplam ) will be derived 
together with corresponding two-sided 90% confidence intervals.

These data may be combined with or linked to other data and used for research purposes, to advance science and public health, or for analysis, development, and commercialization of products to treat and diagnose disease. In addition, redacted Clinical Study Reports and other summary reports will be provided 
upon request. 
1.5. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE  
Investigators will provide the Sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial information in accordance with local regulations to allow the Sponsor to submit complete and accurate financial certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate Health Authorities. Investigators are responsible for providing information on financial interests during the course of the study and for 1 year after completion of the study (i.e., last participant last 
visit [ LPLV ]). 
2. DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD  
2.1. DATA COLLECTION  AND MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES  
2.1.1.  Data Quality Assurance  
All participant data relating to the study will be recorded on printed or electronic Case Report Form (CRF ) unless transmitted to the Sponsor or designee electronically (e.g., 
laboratory data). The Investigator is responsible for verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by [CONTACT_1189].  
The Investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports the information entered in the CRF.  
The Investigator must permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and 
regulatory agency inspections and provide direct access to source data documents. 
The Sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of this study including 
quality checking of the data. 
 
Risdiplam (RO7034067) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  Page 53  
Protocol BP41361, Version 1 Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered 
into the CRF by [CONTACT_1191], complete, and verifiable from source documents; that the safety and rights of participants are being protected; and that the study is being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other study agreements, ICH Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ), and all applicable regulatory 
requirements. 
2.1.2. Source Data Records 
Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which participant data are recorded and documented for the first time. They include, but are not limited to, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_25683], microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X -rays, patient files, and records 
kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico‑ technical departments involved in a 
clinical trial.  
Before study initiation, data to be entered directly into the electronic CRFs  (i.e., no prior 
written or electronic record of the data) and considered source data must be defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan. 
Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data 
entered into the electronic CRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be 
retained per the policy for retention of records described below. 
To facilitate source data verification, the Investigators and institutions must provide the 
Sponsor direct access to applicable source documents and reports for trial ‑related 
monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/I EC review. The investigational site must also allow 
inspection by [CONTACT_436295].  
2.1.3. Use of Computerized Systems 
When clinical observations are entered directly into an inves tigational site’s 
computerized medical record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the 
electronic record can serve as the source document if the system has been validated in accordance with Health Authority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research. An acceptable computerized data collection system allows preservation of the original entry of data. If original data are modified, the system should maintain a viewable audit trail that shows the original data as well as the reason for the change, name [CONTACT_25773], and date of the change.  
2.2. RETENTION OF RECORDS  
Records and documents, including signed ICF, pertaining to the conduct of this study must be retained by [CONTACT_12103] 15 years after study completion unless local regulations or institutional policies require a longer retention period. No records 
 
Risdiplam (RO7034067) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  Page [ADDRESS_1282373] of the study to be fully reconstructed, including but not limited to the protocol, pr otocol 
amendments, ICFs, and documentation of IRB/I EC and governmental approval.  
[COMPANY_002] shall also submit an Annual Safety Report once a year to the IRB/ IEC according 
to local regulatory requirements and timelines of each country participating in the study . 
2.3.1.  Protocol Amendments 
Any substantial protocol amendments will be prepared by [CONTACT_912724]. Substantial protocol amendments will be submitted to the IRB/IEC and to 
regulatory authorities in accordance with local regulatory requirements. 
Approval must be obtained from the IRB/I EC and regulatory authorities (as locally 
required) before implementation of any changes, except for changes necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to participants  or any non-substantial changes, as 
defined by [CONTACT_66363]. 
2.3.2.  Publication Policy  
The results of this study may be published or presented at scientific meetings. If this is foreseen, the Investigator agrees to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to the Sponsor for approval prior to submission. This allows the Sponsor to protect proprietary information and to provide comments based on information from other studies that may not yet be available to the Investigator. 
The Sponsor will comply with the requirements for publication of study results. In 
accordance with standard editorial and ethical practice, the Sponsor will generally support publication of multicenter trials only in their entirety and not as individual center data. In this case, a coordinating Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_12992]. 
Any formal publication of the study in which contribution of Sponsor personnel exceeded 
that of conventional monitoring will be considered as a joint publication by [CONTACT_66361]. 
Authorship will be determined by [CONTACT_14346].  
Any inventions and resulting patents, improvements, and/or know -how originating from 
the use of data from this study will become and remain the exclusive and unburdened property of the Sponsor, except where agreed otherwise.

3. ADMINISTRATIVE STRUC TURE 
The Sponsor of the trial is F. Hoffmann-La [COMPANY_002] Ltd. 
Covance is the contract research organization. 
4. STUDY AND SITE CLOSURE  
The Sponsor (or designee) has the right to close the study site or terminate this study at 
any time. Reasons for terminating the study may include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• The incidence or severity of AEs in this or other studies indicates a potential health 
hazard to participants.  
• Participant enrollment is unsatisfactory.  
 
The Sponsor will notify the Investigator and Health Authorities if the study is placed on 
hold, or if the Sponsor decides to discontinue the study or development program.  
Study sites will be closed upon study completion. A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected and a study  site closure 
visit has been performed. 
The Investigator may initiate study  site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable 
cause and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination. 
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by [CONTACT_31202]: 
• Failure of the Investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the 
IRB/IEC or local Health Authorities, the Sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines.  
• Inadequate recruitment of participants by [CONTACT_737].  
• Discontinuation of further study treatment development.

Protocol BP41361, Version 1 Appendix  2  
Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Evaluating, 
Follow- up, and Reporting  
1. DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
According to the E2A International Conference for Harmonisation guideline for Good 
Clinical Practice, an adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a 
patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which 
does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
An AE can therefore be: 
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
 
Events Meeting the AE Definition:  
• Deterioration in a laboratory value (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other clinical test (e.g., electrocardiogram , X-ray) that is associated with symptoms 
or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant treatment or discontinuation 
from study treatment (see Appendix  3, Section 4). 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition, including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New c onditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study. 
• Adverse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those 
that occur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening invasive 
procedures such as biopsies).  
 
Events NOT  Meeting the AE Definition:  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by 
[CONTACT_78782]’s condition.  
• The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of 
the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s condition.  
• Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to the procedure is an AE. 
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]). 
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 
 
 
Risdiplam (RO7034067) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  Page 57  
Protocol BP41361, Version 1 2. DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be a serious AE (SAE) even 
if serious conditions are met (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1080]/symptoms of the disease 
under study, death due to progression of disease). 
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death. 
• Is life-threatening. 
The term "life-threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers to an event in which 
the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]

In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19949] (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious . 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre-existing condition that did not worsen 
from baseline is not considered an AE. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
Disability means substantial disruption of the participant’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere with or 
prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
• Other significant events: 
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE 
reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_63474] 
1 of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually 
be considered serious.  
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or

or drug abuse. 
3. RECORDING OF ADVERSE EVENT AND/OR SERIOUS 
ADVERSE EVENT  
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to review all  
documentation (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory reports, and diagnostics 
reports) related to the event. 
The Investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the Case Report 
Form ( CRF). 
It is not  acceptable for the Investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914]’s medical 
records to Medical Monitor in lieu of completion of the electronic CRF.  
There may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_29482]. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the 
participant number, will be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_47957] . 
The Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. 
3.1. ASSESSMENT OF SEVERITY  
The Investigator will make an assessment of severity for each AE and SAE reported during the study and assign it to 1 of the categories provided in Table 1 below (as a 
guidance for assessing AE severity). 
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous. Severity refers to the intensity of an AE (rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to a pre-defined grading criteria 
[e.g., National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events criteria ]); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as sever e 
headache without any further findings). 
Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each AE recorded on 
the electronic CRF.  
Serious AEs are required to be reported by [CONTACT_10550] 
(i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event). 
 
Risdiplam (RO7034067) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  Page [ADDRESS_1282374] normal daily activity  
Severe  Incapacitating with inability to work or to perform normal daily activity  
Note: Regardless of severity, some events may also meet seriousness criteria. Refer to 
definition of a serious adverse event (see above).  
 
3.2. ASSESSMENT OF CA[LOCATION_003]LITY  
Investigators should use their knowledge of the participant, the circumstances 
surrounding the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether or not an AE is considered to be related to the study treatment, 
indicating "yes" or "no" accordingly. The following guidance should be taken into consideration: 
• Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study treatment. 
• Course of the event, considering especially the effects of dose-reduction, 
discontinuation of study treatment, or reintroduction of study treatment (where 
applicable) . 
• Known association of the event with the study treatment or with similar treatments. 
• Known association of the event with the disease under study. 
• Presence of risk factors in the participant or use of concomitant medications known 
to increase the occurrence of the event. 
• Presence of non-treatment-related factors that are known to be associated with the occurrence of the event. 
 
For participant receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for 
each protocol -mandated therapy. 
4. FOLLOW -UP OF AES AND SAES 
The Investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_388405]/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. 
This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. 
If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up 
period, the Investigator will provide the Sponsor  with a copy of any post-mortem findings 
including histopathology. 
New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed CRF.  
 
Risdiplam (RO7034067) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  Page [ADDRESS_1282375] report such events to the Sponsor immediately; under no circumstances should reporting take place more than [ADDRESS_1282376] report to the Sponsor within 24 hours after learning of the event, regardless of relationship to study treatment: 
• Serious AEs. 
• Non-serious adverse events of special interest (NSAESI) . 
• Pregnancies (see Section 8.3.5). 
 
The Investigator must report new significant follow-up information for these events to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after becoming aware of the information). New significant information includes the following: 
• New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis.  
• Significant new diagnostic test results. 
• Change in causality based on new information. 
• Change in the event’s outcome, including recovery.  
• Additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event. 
 
Investigators must also comply with local requirements for reporting SAEs to the local 
Health Authority and Institutional Review Board ( IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC). 
5.[ADDRESS_1282377]  
Events  That Occur Prior to Study Treatment Initiation 
After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study treatment, only 
SAEs caused by a protocol -mandated intervention should be reported. The Serious 
Adverse Event/Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting Form provided to Investigators should be completed and submitted to the Serious Adverse Event 
Responsible person immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event). 
 
Risdiplam (RO7034067) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  Page 61  
Protocol BP41361, Version 1 Events That Occur After Study Treatment Initiation 
For reports of SAEs and NSAESIs (Section 8.3.6) that occur after initiation of study 
treatment (Section 8.3.1), Investigators should record all case details that can be 
gathered immediately (i.e., within 24 hours after learning of the event) on the paper 
Clinical Trial Serious Adverse Event/Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting Form and submit to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after 
learning of the event), either by [CONTACT_912725].  
Reporting of Post -Study Adve rse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
If the Investigator becomes aware of any other SAEs occurring after the end of the AE 
reporting period, if the event is believed to be related to prior study treatment, the event 
should be reported directly to the Sponsor or its designee, either by [CONTACT_912726] I nvestigators. 
5.2 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR CASES OF  ACCIDENTAL 
OVERDOSE OR MEDICATION ERROR (SPECIAL SITUATIONS)  
Accidental overdose and medication error (hereafter collectively referred to as "special situations") are defined as follows:  
• Accidental overdose: accidental administration of a drug in a quantity that is higher 
than the assigned dose  
• Medication error: acci dental deviation in the administration of a drug  
In some cases, a medication error may be intercepted prior to administration of the drug. 
 
Special situations are not in themselves AEs , but may result in AEs. Each AE associated 
with a special situation should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event electronic 
CRF. If the associated AE fulfills seriousness criteria, the event should be reported to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event). For 
risdiplam, AEs assoc iated with special situations should be recorded as described below  
for each situation: 
• Accidental overdose: Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] "accidental overdose" as the event 
term. Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes. 
• Medication error that does not qualify as an overdose: Enter the AE term.  Check the 
"Medication error" box.  
• Medication error that qualifies as an overdose: Enter the AE term. Check the 
"Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.  
 
 
Risdiplam (RO7034067) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  Page 62  
Protocol BP41361, Version 1 In addition, all special situations associated with risdiplam , regardless of whether they 
result in an AE, should be recorded on the Adverse Event electronic CRF. Special 
situations should be recorded as described below: 
• Accidental overdose: Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] "accidental overdose" as the event 
term. Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes. 
• Medication error that does not qualify as an overdose: Enter the name [CONTACT_26865] a description of the error (e.g., wrong dose administered, wr ong 
dosing schedule, incorrect route of administration, wrong drug, expi[INVESTIGATOR_679392]) as the event term. Check the "Medication error" box.  
• Medication error that qualifies as an overdose: Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] "accidental 
overdose" as the event term. Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication 
error" boxes. Enter a description of the error in the additional case details . 
• Intercepted medication error: Enter the drug name [INVESTIGATOR_1238] "intercepted medication 
error" as the event term. Check the "Medication error" box. Enter a description of the error in the additional case details.  
 
As an example, an accidental overdose that resulted in a headache would require the 
completion of 2 Adverse Event electronic CRF pages, 1 to report the accidental 
overdose and 1 to report the headache. The "Accidental overdose" and "Medication 
error" boxes would need to be checked on both electronic CRF pages.  
6. EXPEDITED REPORTING TO HEALTH AUTHORITIES, 
INVESTIGATORS, INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW  BOARDS, AND 
ETHICS COMMITTEES  
The Sponsor will promptly evaluate all SAEs and NSAESI against cumulative product 
experience to identify and expeditiously communicate possible new safety findings to 
Investigators, IRBs, IECs, and applicable Health Authorities based on applicable 
legislation.  
To determine reporting requirements for single AE  cases, the Sponsor will assess the 
expectedness of these events using the following reference documents: 
• Risdiplam  Investigator’s Brochure 
 
The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event 
frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the applicable reference document. 
Reporting requirements will also be based on the Investigator's assessment of causality 
and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by [CONTACT_25753]. 
 
Risdiplam (RO7034067) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  Page [ADDRESS_1282378] medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse 
events (AEs) on the Adverse Event electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF ). Avoid 
colloquialisms and abbreviations.  
Only 1 AE term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
1. DIAGNOSIS VERSUS SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS 
A diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported AEs based on 
signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced by [ADDRESS_1282379] symptom of the eventual diagnosis. 
2. ADVERSE EVENTS OCCURRING SECONDARY TO OT HER 
EVENTS  
In general, AEs occurring secondary  to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical 
sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252], with the exception of severe or serious secondary events. However, medically significant AEs  occurring secondary to an 
initiating event that are separated in time should be recorded as independent events on the Adverse Event eCRF. For example: 
• If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, 
only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF. 
• If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF. 
• If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF.  
• If dizziness leads to a fall and subsequent fracture, all 3 events  should be reported 
separately on the eCRF. 
 
All AEs should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is unclear as to 
whether the events are associated.  
3. PERSISTENT OR RECURRENT ADVERSE EVENTS  
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between participant 
evaluation timepoints. Such events should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event 
 
Risdiplam (RO7034067) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  Page [ADDRESS_1282380] result should be 
reported as an AE if it meets any of the following criter ia: 
• Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]. 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation). 
• Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) or a change in concomitant therapy. 
• Clinically significant in the Investigator’s judgment. 
 
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings. Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory abnorm ality should be classified as an AE. 
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5 times the upper limit of normal [ULN] 
associated with cholecystitis), only the diagnosis (i.e., cholecystitis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating if the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., "elevated potassium" as opposed to "abnormal potassium"). If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the AE. For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L 
should be recorded as “hyperkalemia.” 
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, unless the etiology changes. The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens. 
 
Risdiplam (RO7034067) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  Page 65  
Protocol BP41361, Version 1 5. ABNORMAL VITAL SIGN VALUES  
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an AE . A vital sign result should be reported 
as an AE if it meets any of the following criteria:  
• Accompanied by [CONTACT_4659]. 
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation). 
• Resul ts in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy. 
• Clinically significant in the Investigator’s judgment. 
 
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to review all vital signs  findings. Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign 
abnormality should be classified as an AE. 
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on 
the Adverse Event eCRF. 
Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, unless the etiology changes. The initial severity of the event should be recorded, and the severity or seriousness should be updated any time the event worsens. 
6. ABNORMAL LIVER FUNCTION TESTS  
The finding of an elevated alanine aminotransferase ( ALT) or aspartate 
aminotransferase ( AST) (>  3 × ULN) in combination with either an elevated total bilirubin 
(> 2 × ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or other causes of 
hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury. Therefore, Investigators must report as an AE the occurrence of either of the following: 
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST
 > 3 × ULN in combination with total 
bilirubin  > 2 × ULN.  
• Treatment-emergent ALT or AST  > 3 × ULN in combination with clinical jaundice.  
 
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (Section 8.2.4 and 
Appendix  2) and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after  
learning of the event), either as an SAE or a NSAESI (Appendix  2). 
7. DEATHS  
All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AE reporting period (see Section 5 of 
Appendix  2), regardless of relationship to study treatment, must be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor.  
 
Risdiplam (RO7034067) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  Page [ADDRESS_1282381] event. The event or condition 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF. Generally, only 1 such event should be reported. If 
the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, “unexplained death” should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), “unexplained death” should be replaced by [CONTACT_25749]. The term "sudden death" should not be used unless combined with the presumed cause of death (e.g., "sudden cardiac death"). 
8. PRE- EXISTING MEDICAL CON DITIONS  
A pre -existing medical condition is one that is present at the Screening visit for this 
study. Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF.  
A pre -existing medical condition should be recorded as an AE  only if the frequency, 
severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study. When recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the pre-existing condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] (e.g., “more 
frequent headaches”).  
9. HOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_912702] (per the definition of SAE  in Appendix  2), except as outlined 
below. 
An event that leads to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912703] a n SAE: 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25678] 
• Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33402] (e.g., for study treatment 
administration)  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre-existing condition, provided that all of the following criteria are met: 
o The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912704]. 
o The participant has not suffered an AE. 
An event that leads to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_678569], but should be reported as an AE instead:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_912705].

Protocol BP41361, Version 1 Additional Statistical Considerations for Clinical Laboratory Data 
• Standard Reference Ranges and Transformation of Data 
Potential analysis considerations for analyzing l aboratory data includes the use of 
standard reference ranges and potential transformation of data for specific lab tests.  
In this scenario, [COMPANY_002] standard reference ranges, rather than the reference ranges of 
the Investigator, can be used for specific parameters. For these parameters, the 
measured laboratory test result will be assessed directly using the [COMPANY_002] standard 
reference range. Certain laboratory parameters will be transformed to [COMPANY_002]’s standard 
reference ranges.  
A transformation will be performed on certain laboratory tests that lack sufficiently 
common procedures and have a wide range of Investigator ranges (e.g., enzyme tests that include aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline 
phosphatase and total bilirubin). Since the standard reference ranges for these parameters have a lower limit of zero, only the upper limits of the ranges will be used in transforming the data.  
• Definition of Laboratory Abnormalities  
For all laboratory parameters included in this analysis, there exists a [COMPANY_002] predefined standard reference range. Laboratory values falling outside this standard reference range will be labeled “H” for high or “L” for low in participant listings of laboratory data. 
In addition to the standard reference range, a marked reference range has been predefined by [CONTACT_436301]. The marked reference range is broader  than the standard reference range. Values falling outside the marked reference 
range that also represent a defined change from baseline will be considered marked laboratory abnormalities (i.e., potentially clinically relevant). If a baseline value is not available for a participant, the midpoint of the standard reference range will be used as the participant’s baseline value for the purposes of determining marked laboratory abnormalities. Marked laboratory abnormalities will be labeled in the participant l istings 
as “HH” for very high or “LL” for very low.

Information  
1. DEFINITIONS  
• Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal 
unless permanently sterile. The definition of childbearing potential may be adapted for alignment with local guidelines or requirements. 
• Women in the following categories are considered to be a Woman of 
Non-Childbearing Potential (WONCBP)  
a) Pre-menarchal  
b) Pre-menopausal  female with 1 of the following:  
– Documented hysterectomy.  
– Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656].  
– Documented tubal ligation. 
– Documented bilateral oophorectomy.  
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s: review of participant’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
c) Post-menopausal  female 
– A post-menopausal  state is defined as no menses for  ≥ 12 months without an 
alternative medical cause other than menopause. A high follicle-stimulating 
hormone (FSH) level in the post-menopausal  range may be used to confirm a 
post-menopausal  state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal 
replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, 
a single FSH measurement is insufficient.  
– Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use 
[ADDRESS_1282383]-menopausal  status before study enrollment. 
 
 
Risdiplam (RO7034067) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  Page 70  
Protocol BP41361, Version 1 2. CONTRACEPTION GUIDAN CE 
• Female Participants 
Not applicable; female participants of childbearing potential (WOCBP) will not be allowed 
to participate in this study. Women of n on-childbearing potential are eligible for the 
study. Both are defined in Section 1 above. 
• Male Participants 
Use of adequate contraception methods during the treatment period and until [ADDRESS_1282384] refrain from donating sperm during this 
same period.  
a) Contraception methods for male participants considered as acceptable for the study:  
o With non-pregnant female partners, use contraceptive measures such as a 
condom with spermicide plus an additional contraceptive method that together 
result in a failure rate of <1% per year, with partners who are WOCBP ( as 
defined in Section 1 above). The additional contraceptive method must be 1 of 
the following: diaphragm in combination with spermicide, intrauterine device, 
injectable or implantable contraceptives, oral hormonal contraceptives (e.g., “progesterone only pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] ,” tablets, patch, or vaginal ring with both estrogen and 
progesterone). Contraception is required during the treatment period and for 
at least [ADDRESS_1282385] dose of risdiplam . 
Abstinence (including those who practice abstinence as part of their normal and preferred lifestyle, periodic abstinence, e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or 
post ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception in this study.  
3. PREGNANCY TESTING  
Female participants of childbearing potential will not be allowed to participate in this 
study. Blood sample and urine pregnancy tests will be performed according to Schedule 
of Activity tables (see S ection 1.2). If a urine pregnancy test is positive, it must be 
confirmed by a blood pregnancy test. 
4. COLLECTION OF PREGNANCY INFORMATION  
• Male participants with partners who become pregnant  
The Investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male participant’s female partner who becomes pregnant while the male participant is in this study (see Section 8.3.5 Pregnancy).  
 
Risdiplam (RO7034067) —F. Hoffmann -La [COMPANY_002] Ltd  Page [ADDRESS_1282386] pregnancy information on the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form and submit it to the S ponsor  within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pregnancy . 
When permitted by [CONTACT_779], the pregnant partner would need to sign an Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Pregnancy Health Information to allow for follow-up on her pregnancy. If the authorization has been signed, the Investigator should update the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form with additional information on the course and outcome of the pregnancy when available. An Investigator who is contact[CONTACT_716664], to support an informed decision in cooperation with the treating phys ician and/or obstetrician. The female partner will be followed to 
determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the Sponsor. Monitoring of the participant’s partner should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy. Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure.  
5 ABORTIONS  
Any spontaneous abortion should be classified as an SAE (as the Sponsor considers 
spontaneous abortions to be medically significant events), recorded on the Adverse Event electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF ), and reported to the Sponsor immediately 
(i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5 of Appendix  2). 
Any induced abortion due to maternal toxicity and/or embryo -fetal toxicity should also be 
classified as an SAE, recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5 of Appendix  2). 
Elective or therapeutic abortion not associated with an underlying maternal or 
embryo-fetal  toxicity (e.g., induced abortion for personal reasons) does not require 
expedited reporting but should be reported as outcome of pregnancy on the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form.  
6 CONGENITAL ANOMALIES/BIRTH DEFECTS

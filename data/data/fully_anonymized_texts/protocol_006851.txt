3.0 B ACKG ROU ND AND RATIONALE  
 
 
3.1 Introduc tion 
Rena l cell cancer (RCC)  is the  7th most common cancer in U .S. men  and the 9th most common 
cance r in U .S wom en. A n estimat ed 61,560 ne w cases and 14,080 death s are expec ted in 2015.1 
Approximately 30% of patients will h ave metastatic RCC a t the time of diagnosis,2 and a simila r 
propo rtion of n ewly diagnose d RCC p atients will later on de velop meta stasis.3 Clear-cell RCC 
(ccRCC) is the most c ommon RCC hi stologic type, compris ing 83%-90% o f all RCCs .4,5 An 
improv ed unde rstanding of ccRCC tumor biolo gy has led to ma jor advances in the treatment of 
metastatic  ccRCC (mRCC) ov er the last decade. Subsequently , immunomodulating cy tokin es 
such as inte rleukin-2 and interferon a lfa, which we re the ma instay therapy for mRCC for  two 
decades, ha ve re cently been repla ced by [CONTACT_644395] t of 
rapamyc in (m TOR) pathway s.6 
 
ccRCC is asso ciated with in activ ating muta tions of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL ) tumor 
suppre ssor gene. This leads to upre gulation of hypoxia-inducible f actors (HI F) and to 
downstrea m up regulation of VEGF, resulting in increased angiogene sis, wh ich is c ommon ly 
noted in ccRCC.[ADDRESS_862524] a re also frequently found in

both here ditary and sporadic f orms of  ccRCC.8 Tyrosine kinase  inhibitors (TKI s) targ eting the 
VEGF pathway that h ave been approved by [CONTACT_644396] 
(FDA ) for use in mRCC include sorafenib, sunitinib, pazopanib, and ax itinib. Bevacizumab, a 
monoclona l antibo dy that binds to VE GF also has efficacy against mRCC.  Two mTOR 
inhibitors, t emsirolimus  and everolimus, have received FD A approva l for use in mRCC.  The 
most re cent t argeted ag ents to improve surviva l in mRCC are cabozantinib, a TKI that targ ets the 
VEGF, Ax l and c-MET pathways, and nivolumab, a monoclonal antibody that target s the

3.1 Background on MGCD516  
 
MGCD516  is a potent inhi bitor of the catalytic activity of a subset of closely rela ted recombina nt 
human receptor tyrosine kinase s (RTKs)  including the Ax l family, c- MET,  KIT, FLT3, RET and 
the VEGF R, PDGF R, D DR, T rk familie s as well as selected Eph fa mily memb ers and selected 
target oncogenic va riants (Table 2).13 To confir m that inhibition of enzy matic activity, as 
measured using rec ombinant protein a ssays, trans lated into inhibition of t arget kinases in ce lls, 
MGCD516  bioche mical specificity wa s evaluated in cell-based a ssays with half max imal 
inhibitory c oncentration (IC 50) values ranging from <10 to 181 nmol/L (Table 2 ). Many of the 
targets inhibited by [CONTACT_297021]516 a re known d river kinase s in mRCC.

3.1.2 Preclinical efficacy data of MGCD516 
 
A series of in vivo expe riments with MGCD516 were performed to 1) demo nstrate inh ibition of 
its kin ase targets (e.g., c- MET, Ax l, RET, E PHA 2) in tumors and establish the PK and 
pharmacodyna mic (PD)  para meters of c-MET in hibition; 2) demonstra te anti- tumor efficacy in 
rodent mode ls of cance r; 3) d emonstra te the dose- and time-dependent re lationship of inhibition 
of RTK targets, su ch as c-MET, with anti-tumor ef ficacy. 
 
The anti- tumor ef ficacy of MG CD516 wa s eva luated in a variety of human tumor xenogra ft 
models (total of 17 ) representative of  cance rs known to exhibit dy sregulation of RTKs targeted 
by [CONTACT_297021]51 6.  MGCD 516 demonstra ted si gnificant anti- tumor effi cacy compare d with  vehicle 
control ac ross all evaluated models at dose leve ls ranging from 1.25 to 20 mg/kg /day depending 
on the mode l tested (see the Inve stigator’s Broc hure for full d etails).  Anti-tumor efficacy wa s 
generally dose-dependen t for models for  which m ultiple  dose levels were evaluated. MGCD516 
was generally we ll tole rated w ith minima l ove rt toxicity or weig ht loss at dose levels up to 20 
mg/kg /day for up to 18 day s of administra tion.  The  20 mg/kg /day dose leve l was the m aximum 
dose for c omparative purpose s across all models utilize d for  efficacy studi es. At this dos e, anti- 
tumor eff icacy ranged from stabl e disease to robu st tumor re gression, with the minimum 
propo rtion of stable tumors obse rved being 77% (DU145 pr ostate and HCT-116 colon), which 
was signifi cantly higher compared with vehicle control.  MGCD516 consistently produced e ither 
stable disea se or tumor response ( >90% of case s) in the ma jority of mo dels evaluated a t the 
20 mg/kg /day dose  with multiple mod els exh ibiting frank tumor regre ssions a t this dose  level. 
Highly se nsitive mode ls exhibiting tumor regressions at 20 mg/kg /day MGCD516 included the 
MKN45 ga stric adenocarc inoma  model (41% tumor regression), NCI- H1437 lung 
adenocarc inoma  (24%  tumor regression), CTG-0838 lung adenocarc inoma  (43%  tumor 
regression),  and MV4-11 leuke mia (minor tumor regression).  Intere stingly, severa l of t hese 
models ha ve an underlying gene tic alteration of at least one MGCD516 RT K target including 
focal amplification of the MET gene (MKN45), linear a mplification of a region of chromosome 
4, which includes the PDGF RA, KIT and KDR  gene loci, a long with a R988C  MET mutation 
(NCI-H1437), a KIF5B- RET oncogenic gene fusion eve nt (CTG -0838 ); and a FLT3- ITD gene

3.1.3 Dose  Rationale for M GCD516  
The PK/PD of  MGCD516 wa s evaluated using the c- MET-dependent MKN45 ga stric 
adenocarc inoma  tumor model.  P lasma  concentra tions of M GCD516 were de termined using 
liquid chr omato graphy– mass sp ectrometry, a nd phosphorylation of c- MET  in MKN45 tumors 
was determined by [CONTACT_115592] A at several dose l evels and time points on Day [ADDRESS_862530] 
range of dose s by [CONTACT_644400] 1 in a 14-day repeat-dose 
study.  These studie s sug gested tha t the anti- tumor efficacy o f MGCD516 in the MKN45 mode l 
depended on the ex tent and dura tion of c-MET i nhibition.  This mod el was further used to de fine 
the target pla sma conce ntration, i.e., the projec ted effic acious plasma level IC 50 and 90% 
maximal inhib itory concentration (IC 90).  The IC 90 value for inhibiting  c-M ET phosphorylation 
corresponded to the IC 50 values of stable disea se or tumor response suggesting that n ear- 
complete inhibition of c-MET phosphoryla tion (> 90% ) is n eeded t o inhibit tumor growth ( > 
50%). 
Because the a ntitumor ac tivity of M GCD516 m ay be mediated by [CONTACT_644401] c- 
MET, the  determination of human target effic acious exposure is based on PK/PD mod eling of 
anti-tumor efficacy a s opposed to only c-MET inhibition.  In te rms of  systemic exposure, the 
daily exposure (AUC 0-24,ss ) that is associ ated to 5 0% maximum tu mor growth inhibition wa s 
estimat ed at 2.5 µmol ·h/L (1.57 µg·h/mL) which wa s thus establish ed as the minimum targe t 
efficacious exposure in the clinical setting  based on this model. The corresponding ave rage 
plasma concentration a t steady-state (Cave,ss) was estimated a t 0.1 µ mol/L  (0.0630 µg/mL ).

(28.1% ), rash (14.7% ), diar rhea (13.4% ), pruritus (10.5% ), nausea (9% ), decreased appe tite 
(9%), and fever (6%).  The majo rity of AEs we re low grade, and only 14% of pa tients developed 
Grade 3/4 drug-re lated A Es. The  mos t common Grade 3/4 dr ug-related AE s occurring in ≥ 1% of 
patients were fatigue (2% ), pne umonitis  (1%), diar rhea (1%),  and AST/ALT increase (0.3 % 
each). Drug-re lated se rious adve rse events ( SAEs) occurred in 17% of pat ients.  Grade 3/4 drug- 
related SAEs occurring in ≥ 1% of patients were pneumonitis (1.3% ), and diar rhea (1%). The

different dose levels used. Le ss common d rug-related AEs inclu ded vitili go, hepa titis, 
hypophysitis, and thyroid itis. 
 
Treatme nt interruption  and a dministra tion of cor ticoster oids were used to mana ge hepa tic or 
gastroint estinal AE s, which overa ll we re fully reve rsible.  Hormone replace ment  therapy wa s 
used to manage endoc rine A Es. Several pa tients with these A Es successf ully re started nivolumab 
therapy. Drug-re lated pneumonitis was noted in 3% of pa tients. Grade ≥ 3 pneumonitis 
developed in only 3 patie nts (1%). There was no c lear re lationship  between the o ccurrence of 
pneumonitis and dose leve l, dose number, or t umor  type. Low-grade pneumonitis generally 
resolved with discontinu ation of treatment a nd administr ation of c orticosteroids.  Infliximab 
and/or myc ophenolate we re used as additional immunosuppre ssants  in 3 pa tients, but it remains 
uncerta in whether this provided a dditional bene fit. Three drug-re lated deaths (1%) due to 
pneumonitis we re noted. In two of these cases, early and aggre ssive intervention  such a s 
systemic  corticosteroid therapy was not initiated, and this likely significantly contributed to the 
fatal event, wher eas in the 3rd pa tient, conc omittant a dministra tion of other  anti- cancer agents 
(erlotin ib and vinore lbine) may  have aggrava ted toxicity. 
 
In the Ch eckMate 025 s tudy using the now e stablish ed nivolumab dose of 3 mg/kg every 2 
weeks, following a median dura tion of treatment of 5.5 months (range, <0.1 to 29.6), treatment- 
related AEs of any g rade occurred in 319/406 pa tients (79% ). The most frequent treatment-

AEs occurred in 19% of pa tients, with the most common Grade 3/4 AE being fatigue (2%). 
Treatme nt-related AEs lea ding to  nivolumab discontinua tion were noted in 8% of pa tients. There 
were no nivolumab-re lated deaths.9

3.3 Rationale for Com bining MGCD516 w ith Immune Checkpoi nt Therapy 
MGCD516 is a  TKI that targets multiple  closely re lated receptor ty rosine kinase p athways 
including VEGF, plate let-derived gro wth fac tor (PDGF), c-KI T, c- MET,  and the Tyro3, Axl, and 
MER (TAM)  family.  The re is a stro ng ra tionale for targe ting these pathways in mRCC due  to 
their role in aber rant tumor angiogene sis (VE GFR and PDGFR), tumor gro wth and meta static 
progression (c- MET), and evasion of immune surve illance (VEGFRs, c-KIT, TA Ms). VEGF, c- 
KIT, c-MET,  and Ax l sign aling activates cel ls and mol ecules th at limit the ability of immune 
checkpoint ther apy to fully harne ss the immune sy stem  and ac hieve consistent, dura ble anti- 
tumor ac tivity. 
 
The TA M receptor tyrosine kinase s Axl and MER Proto- Oncogene (MERT K) are ex pressed by 
[CONTACT_644404],37 and 
cooperate to create a n immunosuppre ssive tumor mic roenvironmen t. MERTK  suppre sses the 
classically activated (M1) macropha ge pro- inflammato ry cytokine re spon se involving IL ‑ 12, 
IL 6 and TNF, and enhances M2 m acrophage a nti-inflammatory cytokine produc tion involving  
IL‑ 10, IL-4, TGF β, and HGF.38,[ADDRESS_862546] tumors via immune

by [CONTACT_644405] p art of a

progression and meta stasis in mouse  cancer mo dels.44   Tumors implante d into null mice for the 
MERTK  and Ax l liga nd G as6 grow mo re slow ly, likely due to the inhibition of MERTK on 
macrophages, Axl on de ndritic  cells, and both Axl and MERTK on N K cells.45  Collectively, 
these da ta implic ate Ax l and MERTK a s key regulators of the  innate immune sy stem  within the

demonstra ting immunostimulatory ac tivity are ava ilable for Vascula r endothelial g rowth factor

immunosuppre ssive cellular subsets, including T regs and MDSC s. VEGF neutra lizing antibodies 
and VEGF receptor sma ll mole cule inhibitors reduced the percentage of intratumoral Treg s in a

reduce s the number of sy stemic MDSCs.  Additi onal studies to inv estigate the e ffects of 
MGCD516 in the tumor mic roenvironmen t are ongoing. 
 
Since  MGCD516 and immune chec kpoint inhibitors, such as nivoluma b, use distinct 
mechanisms for immune activ ation we hypothesi ze that c ombin ation therapy with MGCD516 
plus nivolumab w ill have  acceptabl e safety profile and m ay lead to high cli nical response ra te 
and long-te rm su rvival fo r patients with mRCC. T reatm ent of mRCC with MGCD516 m ay 
produc e rapid tumor ce ll death and re lease of tumor a ssoci ated antigens, as we ll as 
simultane ously enhance the ability of APCs to present t umor antigens. This would pr ime anti- 
tumor T  cell responses,  which can then be enhan ced and sustained by [CONTACT_20382]. In addition, 
because multiple M GCD516 RTK targets are a lso implica ted in  the eva sion of immune 
surve illance and re sistance to immune  checkpo int inhibitors th ere is a strong  mecha nistic 
rationale for the combin ation of these  classe s of agents.

Tregs and MDSCs, ha s also been observed in patients tr eated w ith cabozan tinib.58 
 
Sunit inib blocks the tyrosine kina se activities of  multiple r eceptors inclu ding the VE GF receptor

3.4 Updated results from the present protocol  
 
From May 2017 through February 2020, 42 patients were enrolled in the present  trial. At data 
cutoff (September 21, 2020), 12/42 patient s (28.6%) continued to receive trial treatment. The 
median follow -up time was 18.7 months (95% CI 13.5 to 24.3). Sitravatinib (MGCD516)  starting 
doses of 60, 80, 120, and 150 mg daily were selected according to the late- onset efficacy -toxicity 
(LO-EffTox) design for 0, 15 (35.7%), 24 (57.1%), and 3 (7.1%) patients . Overall, regardless of 
sitravatinib starting dose, the combination of sitravatinib plus nivolumab yielded an objective 
response rate (ORR) of 35.7% (15/42 patients) and a disease control rate (DC R) of 88.1% (37/42 
patients). Complete response was noted in one patient (2.4%), who received a sitravatinib starting dose of 80 mg. The posterior mean for the median progression free survival (PFS) was 11.7 months [95% credible interval (CrI) 8.2 to 16.6]. Median overall survival (OS) was not reached, and 34/42 patients (80.1%) were alive at the time of data cutoff. Because we designed our trial to reflect the patient population enrolled in the CheckMate 025 phase III trial of nivolumab monotherapy in advanced ccRCC, we performed historical comparisons with CheckMate 025 using conservative Bayesian non -informative priors . Combining the three sitravatinib dose groups, the posterior 
probabilities that sitravatinib plus nivolumab yielded higher ORR and longer PFS than those reported for nivolumab monotherapy in CheckMate 025 were 96% and 100%, respectively.   Dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs) were noted in all three patients treated with 150 mg daily. The 120 
mg dose produced an ORR of 37.5% (9/24 patients) compared with the ORR of 26.7% (4/15 patients) observed with 80 mg. The 80 mg dose was associated with fewer DLTs (4/15 patients; 26.7%) compared with the 120 mg dose (10/24 patients; 41.7%). The estimated EffTox desirability scores were 0.622, 0.787, 0.755, and 0.630 for the 60, 80, 120, and 150 mg doses, respectively. 
Because the 80 and 120 mg doses had nearly identical estimated trade- off desirability scores, we 
compared them using additional criteria. The Bayesian posterior probabilities of sitravatinib 120 mg producing a higher ORR and longer PFS, compared with 80 mg were 80.7% and 68.3% respectively. The posterior probabilities of sitravatinib 120 mg yielding lower level of depression, higher quality of life, and higher hope for the future scores at 3 months compared with sitravatinib 80 mg were 92.7%, 82.6%, and 90.5%, respectively. Thus, all metrics favored the sitravatinib

starting dose of 120 mg.  
 Adverse events (AEs) requiring dose reduction of sitravatinib throughout the treatment course were noted in 22/42 patients (52.4%) . The primary reason for treatment discontinuation was disease progression (25/42 patients [59.5%]). Treatment discontinuation due to AEs was noted in 4/42 patients (9.5%). Death due to toxicity occurred in one patient who developed respi[INVESTIGATOR_644369]. High -dose glucocorticoids (prednisone ≥ 40 mg/day or equivalent) for the 
management of immune- related AEs were administered in 8/42 patients (19%). Additional 
immunosuppressive strategies such as infliximab were  needed in 2/42 patients (4.8%).  
 In conclusion, this is the first study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sitravatinib  (MGCD516)  
plus nivolumab in cc RCC. Higher ORR and longer PFS with sitravatinib plus nivolumab in 
patients with ccRCC that progressed on prior antiangiogenic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_644370], compared to historical studies with  nivolumab or TKI monotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_644371]. Furthermore, we found that

6.2.6 Manageme nt of MGC516 toxic ity 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Manageme nt of stom atitis/oral mucositi s/mouth ulc ers 
 
Stom atitis/oral mucositis/mouth ul cers due to s tudy drug should be trea ted using loca l supportive ca re. 
Please note th at investigators in earlier trials have desc ribed the or al toxicities associ ated with stu dy drug 
as mouth ulcers, rathe r than muco sitis or stomatiti s. If your exa mination reveals mouth ulcers rather than 
a more genera l infla mmation of the mouth, pl ease classify the adve rse eve nt as su ch. Ple ase follow the  
paradigm below f or treatm ent of stoma titis/ora l mucositis/mouth ulce rs: 
 
1. For mild to xicity (Grade 1), use conse rvative measures such as non-alcoho lic mouth w ash or sa lt

water (0.9%) mouth wa sh sever al time s a day until re solution.  For mo re severe toxicity (Grade [ADDRESS_862576]  pain but a re able to maintain adequa te ora l alim entation, or Grade 3 in 
which ca se pa tients cannot maintain ad equate oral a limentation), the sugg ested treatm ents are 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_644378] (i.e.,  loca l ane sthetics su ch as benzoca ine, butyl aminobenzoa te, 
tetracaine hydrochloride, menthol, or phenol) with or without topi[INVESTIGATOR_19529] l corticoster oids,  such a s 
triamc inolone  oral pa ste 0.1% ( Kenalog in Orabase®). 
 
2. Agents containing hydrogen pe roxide, iodine, and thy me deriv atives may tend to worsen 
mouth ulce rs. It is p referable to avoid the se agent s. 
 
3. Antifunga l agents must be avoided unle ss a fu ngal infection is dia gnosed. In particular, systemic 
imidazole antifungal age nts (k etoconazole, fluconazole, itracona zole, e tc.) should be avoided in a ll 
patients due to their strong  inhibi tion of  metabolism of stu dy drug, thereb y leading to highe r drug 
level exposur es. Th erefore, topi [INVESTIGATOR_644379]. 
Similarly, antiviral agent s such a s acyclovir should be avoided unless a viral infe ction is 
diagnosed. 
 
Note:  Stoma titis/ora l mucositis should be appropr iately graded using the func tional grading g iven on 
the NCI CTCA E for  adve rse eve nts, v ersion 4.0. 
 
6.3 Conc omitant Therap ies 
 
The following considera tions apply during the e ntire duration of the stu dy: 
• No othe r approved or inve stigational anticance r treatm ent will be p ermitted during the stu dy 
period, including che motherapy, biolog ic ag ents, hormone  therapy or immunotherapy ex cept for 
bisphosphona tes.  No other  investig ational drug may be use d during treatment on this protocol, and 
concurrent pa rticipation in another therape utic clinical trial is not allowed. 
• No anti cance r agents oth er than the study medica tions should be  given to pa tients. If such 
agents are require d for a  patient then the pa tient must first be withdra wn fr om the  study. 
• Surgery or radiation therapy for p alliation purp oses or manage ment of intercurre nt illn ess whi ch, 
in the judgement of the  treating phy sician, is not re lated to dis ease progression. Afte r the p atient 
has re ceived a t least 2 infusions of nivolumab and 6 weeks (42 da ys) of oral MGCD516 then 
further therapy on protocol can be held for up to 4 w eeks (28 days ) to allow 
for recovery from surgical or othe r interventions. 
• Growth  facto rs (e.g.G- CSF, GM-CSF, erythropoie tin, platelets growth factors etc.) are not to be  
administered prophyl actically but may be prescribed by [CONTACT_644423] s evere 
hematolog ic eve nts, if this is thou ght to be approp riate. 
• No chronic tr eatm ent wi th sy stemic steroids or other immunosuppre ssive agents. Topi [INVESTIGATOR_644380] c orticoster oids are a llowed. 
• Live v accines should be avoided w hile a pa tient is on  protocol. 
• The co-administra tion of MGCD516 and ora l warfarin is possible  but should be subjec t to 
verification of  coag ulation (I NR) once  steady state is reache d (after one week’s t reatment ). 
• Patients who develop venous thromboe mbolism (pulmon ary e mbolisms  or deep venous 
thrombosis) may be tr eated as indi cated by L MW hepa rin and st ay on p rotocol at the 
discretion of the trea ting physician. 
• The patient w ill provide a list of concurrent medi cations re lated to co-morbi dity (e.g. 
hype rtension,  diabe tes, etc.), including over the counter agents, taken prior to enrollm ent. The list 
will be upda ted during c linic visits  while  on treatment and will be maintained in the medical 
record .

• In vitro experim ents indic ate that MGCD516 is a po tential inducer of CYP 2B6 and 3A4, as well as  a 
potenti al inhibitor of CYP 2C8, 2D6, and 3A4, though neither  time dep endent nor me tabolism 
depend ent inhibit ion has been observ ed. Medic ations  that are subs trates  for CY P 2C8, 2D6 or 3A4 
and are either sensitive s ubstrates or have a narrow th erapeu tic index should be used with caution dur ing 
treatment with MG CD516. 
• In vitro exper iments  in micro somes and recombinant hu man P450 enzymes suggest that MGCD516 
is metaboli zed by [CONTACT_644424] 3A4, 2B6, 2D6, and with a low  risk of any 
one CYP demonstr ating  a disproportionate contrib ution  to its metabolism. Cauti on should therefore be 
used when administeri ng MGCD516 to patients taking  medications that are strong inhib itors or 
induc ers of the cytochrome P450 sys tem. 
• The s olubility of MGCD516 is pH dependen t. For this reas on, medications  that are a ssociat ed with 
sustained increase in gas tric pH  should be avoided during treatment w ith MGCD516. P atien ts 
requir ing gastric pH medic ations should sw itch from u se of proton pu mp inhib itors or H 2 antagonis ts to 
use of antacids. 
• MGCD516 is an inhibitor of BCRP and P-gp transporters bas ed on in vitro studies. Med ications that  
are subs trates for BCRP or P-gp transporters should be avoided dur ing treatment wit h 
MGCD516. 
• Medications with QTc Prolonging Activity: The risk of QTc prolongation in patients receiving sitravatinib 
has not been characterized. Use of medications known to prolong QTc and pose risk of Torsades de 
Pointes (listed in Appendix E) is to be avoided.

infusions of nivolumab 240 mg IV every 2 weeks with no DLT related to nivolumab, will be allowed 
to transition to the equivalent  nivolumab schedule of 480 mg IV every 4 weeks. If one agent 
(MGCD516 or nivolumab) is i nterrupted or discontinued, administration of the other agent may 
continue at the discretion of the Investigator and patient.  
There
 are four possible dose levels for MGCD516 in this study: 60, 80, 120, and 150 mg per day. 
Depending on safety observations, the MGCD516 dose during subsequent cycles of treatment may be 
reduced to the next lower dose level at the discretion of the Investigator and patient. Specifically, for grade ≥ 3 hematologic and non-hematologic DLT s or Grade ≥ 2 drug- related uveitis that d oes not respond 
to topi[INVESTIGATOR_644381] (as described in section  5.3) attributed to MGCD516 
then treatment should be held until resolution to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline, and then MGCD516 can be restarted at the next lower dose level. If toxicity recurs (second time  or third time ) at Grade ≥3 ( or Grade 
≥ 2 drug-related uveitis that does not respond to topi[INVESTIGATOR_644381]) , then 
hold MGCD516 until resolution to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline and restart at next lower dose level. If the patient develops a DLT related to MGCD516 at the 60 mg dose level then MGC D516 should be discontinued. 
Dose reductions of MGCD516 will also be allowed on a case -by-case basis at the discretion of the 
Investigator and patient  in patients with toxicity related to MGCD516 that does not meet the DLT criteria 
outlined in section 5.3. Once the dose has been reduced, re-escalation is generally not recommended but 
may be considered on a case-by-case basis. If the administration of MGCD516 is interrupted for reasons other than toxicity, then treatment with MGCD516  may be resumed at the same dose.  Only the data from 
the originally planned MGCD516 dose will be used for the dose- finding late -onset EffTox (Lo- EffTox) 
calculations, described in section 14.

Immun e-related Adverse Eve nts (irA Es) are defined in the  nivolumab labe l as those o ccurring during 
nivolumab therapy, often nece ssitate  immunosuppression a nd have no other a lterna te etiology. The  
nivolumab p ackage inser t (http://packageinser ts.bms. com/pi/pi_opdivo.pdf ) provid es detailed 
evaluation and management guide lines for the following types of ir-AEs: pneumonitis, c olitis, h epatitis, 
endocrinopathie s, nephritis/rena l dysfunction, rash, and encepha litis. As a  gene ral prin ciple, nivolumab 
should be withheld or permanently discontinued in patients with modera te or severe irAEs. Depending 
on the na ture of the irAE, it should be manage d with cor ticosteroids and/or hormone-replace ment 
therapy. The cor ticosteroids should be tapered down upon improve ment of the irA E to G rade ≤1. 
Depending on the seve rity of the irA E, re starting of nivolu mab m ay be considered. Prior  to re- initiating

6.5 Quality of Life Evaluation  
 
Measuring quality of life (QOL) outcomes in cancer patients has become an important mandate for clinical trials.  It is especially important to assess QOL in phase II cancer clinical trials  that are likely to

Protocol 2016 -0332  
May 24, 2021  
Page 35 of 62  
move into the phase III setting.  The extent to which treatment impairs QOL is information the patients 
need when making treatment decisions.  It is also important to try and identify factors that are associated with better adjustment to help us identify patients at risk for adjustment problems and translate this information into the clinical setting to individualize intervention programs.  In addition, elucidating protective and risk factors will help identify individuals at greater ris k for medical complications, disease 
progression, and recurrence. 
 
Patients will experience somewhat different symptoms when they receive the different therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  In order to assess the effects of combining these treatments, we will assess multidimensional aspects of QOL over the treatment course.  
 QOL evaluations will not be performed during the long term extension phase of the trial.  
 
6.5.1 Assessment Schedule  All patients will complete a full assessment battery at baseline, prior  to treatment.  Patients will then 
complete a brief assessment battery at week 2, week 4, week 6, and then every 12 weeks (see Table 4).

 Several measures used previously in our work on chronic stress and QOL will be used in the proposed study.  In all cases, they have proven to be useful and sensitive measures of stress and QOL, have prove n 
to be stable, reliable, and valid with groups of people who are and are not suffering from major depression or other psychiatric disorders. All surveys will be completed electronically using e -tablets 
and response data will be collected using the HIPAA -compliant Qualtrics software platform.  
 
Quality of Life:   
 The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) is a cancer -specific measure of health- related 
quality of life .  This instrument was able to discriminate between individuals with metastatic and non -
metastatic disease, as well as between patients at different stages of illness.  The scale has been found to have good concurrent validity, high internal consistency (0.89), and good test re- test reliability (0.82 to 
0.88).  The FACT will be completed at each assessment.  
 General QOL – General QOL will be assessed using the Medical Outcomes Study 12 -item short- form 
survey (SF -12).  Responses are based on a Likert -type sc ale. The SF -[ADDRESS_862582] reliability (coefficients for various subscales range from 0.60 to 0.81) and good internal 
consistency (coefficients range from 0.78 to 0.93).  The SF-12 will be completed at each assessment.

Depression:   
  Depression will be assessed using the Centers for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_7307] - Depression (CES -D) (3).  The 
CES-D is a well -validated 20- item self- report measure of depression that focuses on affective components 
of depression.  Cut- off scores of [ADDRESS_862583] been recommended.  Internal 
consistency is high in the general population and in patient populations.  It also has been demonstrated to possess adequate convergent validity with other measures of depression.  The CES- D will be completed at 
baseline and at each subsequent assessment . 
 Lifetime history of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) will be measured using the two cardinal items from the Structured Clinical Interv iew for DSM -IV Disorder (SCID) that assess lifetime presence of 
depressed mood or anhedonia for two weeks or more. Patients are considered to have lifetime MDD if they endorse one or both of the items. These two questions will only be completed at the first assessment.  Social Support:  
Perceived availability of social support will be measured using the 24 -item Social Provisions Scale that 
includes subscales for attachment , social integration, opportunity for nurturance, reassurance of worth, 
reliable alliance, and guidance.  The SPS will only be completed at baseline.  Hope for the future :  
Finding meaning in cancer will be measured using the Finding Meaning in Cancer scal e (FMCS) .  This 
17-item scale assesses benefits in different domains, including accepting life’s imperfections, changing 
priorities, and developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a sense of purpose in life. The scale is scored as a single factor, has good internal consistency (0.95), and has shown moderate association with psychological well-being.   
 
7.0 CO RREL ATIVE STUDIES  
 
We will perform immune monitoring, including but not limited to the evaluation of CD4 and CD8 T 
cells in available tumor tissue and peripheral blood samples as prev iously published.63-66 Peripheral 
blood and tumor tissue samples (optional) will be obtained within 14 days pretreatment, 2 weeks after 
MGCD516 monotherapy, following 2 infusions of Nivolumab, and upon disease progression. All 
samples will be collected and  analyzed per a separate IRB -approved protocol. In addition, another IRB -
approved protocol, separate from the afor ementioned immunotherapy analyse s, will be used to 
investigate in the blood and tumor tissues , a panel of cytokines, chemokines, cell-free DNA , and other 
relevant angiogenic factors, biological receptors,  ligands, nucleotides and proteins. 
 
Up to one hundre d (150) ml of blood will be dra wn at the visits  outlined in Sectio ns [ADDRESS_862584]  be discontinued from study therapy AND withdra wn from  the study for the

The assessment  of c linical bene fit should take into account whether the subject is 
clinically de teriorating and unlikely to receive further benefit from continued t reatment. 
 
All decisions  to continue treatment beyond in itial progre ssion  must be discusse d with the  
MDACC IND Off ice and documented in t he study records. 
 
Patients should discontinue study therapy upon e viden ce of further progression, de fined 
as an additional 10% or greater increa se in tumor bu rden from time of initial progression  
(including all target lesions and ne w measurable lesions).  
 
New lesions a re considere d me asurable a t the  time of initial p rogre ssion if  the longe st 
diameter is at least 10 mm (ex cept for pathological lymph node s, which must ha ve a short 
axis of at least 15 mm).  Any new lesion  conside red non- measura ble at the time of initial 
progre ssion  may bec ome me asurable and therefore includ ed in the tumor  burden 
measure ment  if the longe st diame ter increases to at least 10 mm (ex cept for pathological 
lymph node s, which must have an increase in short ax is to at least 15  mm).  
 
For statistica l analyse s that  include the investiga tor-assessed progression da te, patients 
who continue treatment beyond initial investiga tor-asse ssed RECIST 1.1-defined 
progre ssion  will be considered to have investiga tor-assessed progre ssive disease at the time

14.3 Additional analyses  
 
Demographics: For e ach treatment g roup (cont rol, expe rimental), summary  statistics will be 
provide d for  age, base line disea se status and p rior treatments. 
 
Toxicity:  Adv erse effec ts that will be evaluated include, but a re not limit ed to infections, rena l 
toxicity, hepa tic toxicity, and pulmonary toxicity.  Methods of a ssessment  will include 
monitoring  blood counts, and perfo rming  laboratory tests as indi cated by [CONTACT_644430]. Evid ence o f toxicity or adve rse eve nts will be  recorded a t all cli nic visits.  All 
observed adve rse effects will be  graded fo r all patients and the degree of as sociation of each with 
therapy a ssessed. 
 
Quality of Life: Prior to inferential procedures, extensive descriptive analyses will be conducted 
for each of the measures obtained at each session.  Descriptive statistics (e.g., means, ranges, 
standard deviat ions) will be computed, together with ninety- five percent confidence intervals for 
the means.  Proportions of subjects falling outside normative ranges for the stress and QOL measures will also be calculated.  Values for the standardized scales will be com pared to 
normative data and patients receiving other types of cancer therapy.  Graphical methods (e.g., boxplots and histograms) will be employed to more closely examine the distributions of the measures at each time point.  Change scores for the stress and QOL measures will be computed as the simple differences between the baseline measure and subsequent evaluations.  Bivariate associations between the raw scores, the change scores, optimism, social support, and demographic variables will be evaluated using Pearson’s product moment correlation coefficients together with scatterplots where appropriate.  These procedures will allow us to thoroughly characterize the stress and QOL profiles of this patient population across the sessions.  
 In this study, numerous models will be constructed to analyze the data and, therefore, the results will be treated as hypothesis generating and interpreted with caution.  Inferential statistics will comprise paired t -tests of the stress and QOL measures.  Significant test resu lts (p < .05) will be 
interpreted as indicating significant changes in stress and QOL associated with the treatment.  Linear regression analyses will then be used to construct prediction models using a composite stress and QOL score.  In these analyses, the composite stress and QOL score will be regressed onto spi[INVESTIGATOR_644391], and interaction terms will be calculated to determine whether these factors moderate stress and quality of life .  Potential confounders 
include the stress and QOL measures obtained at baseline and demographic and treatment characteristics.  Backwards step -wise regression will be employed to construct the final models, 
with a rejection criteria of p > .05.   Multivariate methods, including repeated measures analyses, will be employed to further explore the potential changes in the stress and QOL measures over time.  Standard residual based diagnostic procedures will be used to evaluate model assumption and normalizing transformation made as appropriate.

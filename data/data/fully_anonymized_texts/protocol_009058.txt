Investigators:  
Multicenter
Study Sites:   
Approximately 65 globally
Study Population:   
Phase 1:  Histologically or cytologically confirmed extensive stage disease SCLC or any other 
advanced/metastatic solid tumor for which carboplatin/etoposide treatment is considered appropriate.
Phase 2:  Histologically or cytologically confirmed treatment-naïve extensive stage disease SCLC.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   
Phase 1 Dose Escalation portion:  Approximately:  35Phase 2 Randomized Double-Blind portion:  Approximately:  180
Methodology:This is a Phase 1 dose escalation and Phase 2 randomized double-blind study.
Screening Procedures:
Screening procedures should be performed within 28 days of Cycle 1 Day –2.  If the screening visit is 
performed greater than 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day –2, the physical exam, laboratory tests, and pregnancy test (for female subjects of childbearing potential) must be repeated on Cycle 1 Day –2.  Vital signs and performance status assessments will be performed on Cycle 1 Day –2 for all subjects.  Baseline radiographic tumor assessments per computed tomography (CT) with IV contrast/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis will be conducted within 21 days prior to Cycle 1 Day –2.  If CNS metastases are suspected, a head CT must also be performed at screening.  If the subject is unable to undergo a CT scan with IV contrast due to allergy or renal insufficiency, a non-contrast CT may be performed.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be conducted in cases where 
local laws/requirements mandate, but should have Sponsor approval prior to performing the MRI.
Phase 1 Dose Escalation:
For subjects in the dose escalation portion of the study, each subject will participate in only [ADDRESS_25224] 2014-001764-35

Methodology (Continued):
Phase 1 Dose Escalation (Continued):
The Phase 1 portion of this study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), 
RPTD, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD), of veliparib/carboplatin/etoposide combination in subjects diagnosed with Extensive Stage Disease Small Cell Lung Cancer or, other advanced/metastatic solid tumor for which carboplatin/etoposide treatment is considered appropriate.  Veliparib will be administered on Days –2 to 5 (7-d ay schedule), and, if the MTD of the 7-day schedule 
is not reached at ≤ 200 mg BID veliparib dose level, may be administered on Days –2 to 12 (14-day 
schedule) and/or Days –2 to 19 (continuous schedule) orally BID, in combination with carboplatin area under the curve 5 mg/mL*min administered on Day 1 and etoposide 100 mg/m
2administered on Days 1 
to 3 via intravenous (IV) infusion in 21-day cycles.  An exception would be for the Phase 1 Cycle 2:  In the 7-day schedule, veliparib in Cycle 2 will be administered on Days 2 to 5 and for the 14-day schedule, Days 2 to 12 (veliparib dose on Cycle 2 Days –2 and –1 and Cycle 2 Day 1 will be omitted to allow for 
the evaluation of drug-drug interaction of veliparib with etoposide).
Upon completion of 4 cycles of combination therapy, subjects without evidence of disease progression 
will continue on veliparib 400 mg BID until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  Subjects who will be receiving prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) will have maintenance veliparib interrupted for 
the duration of radiotherapy.
All subjects will be monitored for DLTs during the DLT observation period (Cycle 1 Day –2 to pre-dose 
Cycle 2 Day 1), and treatment-related adverse events (AEs) will be evaluated throughout the course of 
the study for evidence of acute, delayed, or cumulative toxicities.
The dose levels of veliparib to be evaluated in the dose-escalation portion of this study were determined 
based on the outcome of prior clinical studies of veliparib as well as on pre-clinical toxicology, toxicokinetic, and nonclinical anti-tumor efficacy studies.  The following dose levels may be evaluated in the dose-escalation portion of the study:  80, 120, 160, 200, and [ADDRESS_25225] safety including, but not limited to, Grade 2 study-drug related AEs.  If the MTD is not reached at veliparib 200 mg BID dose level, higher dose levels (with no more than 25% veliparib dose increments, and not exceeding single agent veliparib RPTD of 400 mg BID) may be evaluated at the discretion of the sponsor.  The alternative dosing schedules can include dosing veliparib Day –2 to 12 (14-day schedule) and/or Day –2 to 19 (continuous schedule) of 21 day Cycle.  The initial dose for these schedules will be 200 mg BID or the maximum administered dose (MAD), not exceeding the MTD, in the 7-day schedule.  The 14-day schedule will be explored prior to continuous dosing schedule.  Reduced or interim dose levels may be evaluated based on review of the safety and 
PK.
A "3 + 3" escalation rule will be used for the dose-escalation portion of this study, with a condition 
applied for the Dose Level 1, which will allow 3 additional subjects to be entered in Dose Level 1 if 2 of 6 initial subjects experience DLTs.  Enrollment of the 3 additional subjects at all dose levels will depend 
on a review of the specific DLTs observed and discussion with the Investigators.
Dose-Escalation Criteria:
AEs, clinical laboratory results, and vital signs will be assessed throughout the study in each 
dose-escalation cohort.

Methodology (Continued):
Dose-Escalation Criteria (Continued):
DLTs will be assessed in each dose-escalation cohort during the DLT observation period
(Cycle 1 Day –2 to pre-dose on Cycle 2 Day 1).  Based on the safety and tolerability of study drugs after the first cycle of treatment has been completed in at least 3 subjects, escalation to a subsequent dose 
level or expansion of the current dose level will occur based upon the following criteria:
Number of Subjects with 
DLT in the First Cycle Escalation Decision Rule
0 out of 3 Enter 3 subjects at the next dose level.
1 out of 3 Add 3 more subjects at current dose level.  If [COMPANY_013] or the investigator 
considers the DLT(s) clinically significant, [COMPANY_013] will determine if it 
is appropriate to add more patients at this dose level.
!If < 2 of 6 subjects (or < 33% of subjects) experience DLT, dose 
escalation will proceed to the next dose level.
!If ≥ 2 of total 6 subjects (or ≥  33% of subjects) experience DLTs, 
then dose escalation will be stopped.*
≥ 2 out of 3 or 6 Dose escalation will be stopped.  *Additional subjects will be enrolled 
at the previous lower dose level as needed.  The following exceptions apply to Dose Level 1:
!If 2 of 6 initial subjects at Dose Level 1 experience DLTs, 
3 additional subjects may be entered and the cohort will be 
expanded up to 9 subjects for further DLT assessment.  
oEnrollment of the 3 additional subjects will depend on a review 
of the specific DLTs observed and discussion with the 
Investigators.  
!If 2 of 9 subjects at Dose Level 1 experience DLTs, then escalation to the next dose level may proceed.
!If > 2 of 9 subjects in Dose Level 1 experience drug-related DLTs, dose-escalation will stop.
* If 2 out of 6 subjects experience different DLTs, for example nausea and neutropenia, the data will be reviewed 
by [CONTACT_26207] 3 additional subjects should be added at that dose level.  If 
3 subjects will be added and none experience DLTs, this dose level will be declared the MTD.
An MTD and/or maximum administered dose (MAD), and RPTD, will be determined.  The MTD is 
defined as the maximum dose at which < 2 of 6 or ≤ [ADDRESS_25227] 2014-001764-35
11
Methodology (Continued):
DLT Definition:
DLT is defined as any of the following drug-related toxicities occurring during the DLT observation 
period in any of the dose-escalation cohorts, with grading according to the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0:
1. Cycle 1 events associated with treatment delay > 14 days in initiating Cycle 2:
a. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets < 25.0 × 109/L)
b. Grade 4 neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 0.5 × 109/L)
c. Grade 3 febrile neutropenia with fever lasting for > 7 days
d. Grade 4 febrile neutropenia of any duration
NOTE:  Delay of more than 14 days in initiating Cycle 2 due to factors not directly related to 
treatment-emergent toxicity will not be considered a DLT.
2. Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_25228] 2 grade increase from baseline and is 
attributed to veliparib treatment:
a. Exclusion:  nausea and vomiting lasting ≤ 48 hours or inadequately treated
b. Exclusion:  electrolyte abnormalities resolving within ≤ 24 hours
c. Exclusion:  hypersensitivity reactionsd. Exclusion:  alopecia
3. Grade [ADDRESS_25229] 2 grade increase from baseline, is 
attributed to veliparib treatment and requires a treatment delay of > [ADDRESS_25230] one of:a. Dose modification within Cycle 1b. Omission of carboplatin, > 1 daily etoposide dose, or > 30% veliparib doses in Cycle 1
Subjects experiencing DLT(s) during DLT observation period (Cycle 1 Day –2 to pre-dose Cycle 2 
Day 1) will require an interruption and possible discontinuation from further participation in the study.  Veliparib may be reintroduced at a reduced dose, if the toxicity returns to ≤ Grade 1 or to baseline if 
Grade 2 at study entry.  All decisions regarding continued dosing for individual subjects who experience 
a DLT will be medically managed by [CONTACT_26208].
Pharmacokinetics:
Pharmacokinetics of veliparib and etoposide will be assessed to determine the drug-drug interactions.  
Further pharmacokinetics of carboplatin will be assessed on Day 1 of Cycle 1.
Phase 2 Randomized Double-Blind
The veliparib dose and schedule for the Phase 2 was determined to be 240 mg BID on a 14 day schedule 
based on the analysis of Phase 1 data.
Approximately 180 total subjects with treatment-naïve ED SCLC will be enrolled at the 240 mg BID 
veliparib/placebo dose and 14 day schedule in the Phase 2 double-blinded portion of the study.  They 
will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three treatment arms: 
●Arm A:  veliparib in combination with carboplatin/etoposide followed by [CONTACT_26209]
●Arm B:  veliparib in combination with carboplatin/etoposide followed by [CONTACT_26210]
M14-[ADDRESS_25231] 2014-001764-35

Methodology (Continued):
Phase 2 Randomized Double-Blind (Continued)
!Arm C:  placebo in combination with carboplatin/etoposide followed by [CONTACT_26211] 2 study arms will receive a minimum of 4 cycles of combination therapy unless 
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity warrants earlier discontinuation from the treatment.  Additional 2 cycles of combination therapy (e.g., up to a total of 6 cycles) may be administered at the investigators discretion if subject status at the completion of initial 4 cycles warrants continued combination treatment and/or if local SOC guidelines require 6 cycles of platinum-based therapy.  In the combination cycles of Arms A and B, subjects will receive veliparib at 240 mg BID on a 14-day schedule, Arm C will receive matching placebo.  After completion of the chemotherapy combination cycles (at least 4), subjects without evidence of disease progression will receive veliparib at 400 mg BID continuous dosing (21-day cycles) (Arms A), or matching placebo (Arms B and C) as per treatment arm 
assignment, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.  
Subjects who will be receiving prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) will have maintenance veliparib 
interrupted for the duration of radiotherapy.
Subject randomization for Phase 2 will be stratified by [CONTACT_26212] (> ULN versus ≤ ULN), and 
gender.
Pharmacodynamics (Phase 1 Dose Escalation and Phase 2 Randomized Double-Blind):Research to find biomarkers that may serve as surrogates for clinical endpoints in future veliparib studies 
or that may be predictive of veliparib activity will be conducted.  Serum, plasma, blood and tissue 
samples will be collected at designated time points throughout the study.
Tumor Assessments and Safety Follow-Up
Tumor assessments will be performed until radiographic disease progression.  Tumor assessment and 
assessment of response will occur every 6 weeks (± 1 week) from C1D-[ADDRESS_25232] 24 weeks (Phase 1) or 30 weeks (Phase 2), then every 9 weeks (± 1 week) thereafter.  Tumor response will be determined according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Version 1.1.  Subjects will continue on study until they meet defined discontinuation criteria.  When the investigator has determined that a subject should discontinue the study, a Final Visit will be conducted.  Subjects will have a 30-Day Follow-Up Visit following the last dose of study drugs or placebo (Phase 2, dependent on treatment arm).  If the subject begins another treatment regimen directly following protocol treatment and if a 30-Day Follow-Up Visit is not possible, all adverse events ongoing as of the end of study must be 
followed to a satisfactory conclusion.

Duration of Treatment:
Subject will remain on study drug until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
Criteria for Evaluation:
Efficacy:Progression-free survival (PFS) will be derived according to disease progression (radiographic 
progression per RECIST version 1.1) or death.  Radiographic tumor assessments for response will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_26214], every [ADDRESS_25240] 24 weeks (Phase 1) or 
30 weeks (Phase 2), then every 9 weeks until disease progression.
Objective response rate (ORR) will be derived per RECIST version 1.1.  Radiographic tumor 
assessments for response will be conducted by [CONTACT_26214], every [ADDRESS_25241] 24 weeks (Phase 1) or 30 weeks (Phase 2), then every 9 weeks until disease progression.
Duration of overall response (DOR) will be derived according to disease progression (radiographic 
progression per RECIST version 1.1). 
Overall survival will be determined by [CONTACT_26215].  After the 
final visit, survival information will be collected via electronic data capture (EDC) at 2 month intervals 
(or as requested by [CONTACT_26216]).
ECOG performance status will be determined by [CONTACT_26217].  
Pharmacokinetic:
Blood samples for pharmacokinetics of veliparib, carboplatin (Phase 1 Dose Escalation only) and 
etoposide (Phase 1 Dose Escalation only) will be collected at designated time points throughout the study.  Pharmacokinetics of veliparib and etoposide will be assessed to determine the drug-drug 
interactions.  In addition, pharmacokinetics of carboplatin will be determined.

Criteria for Evaluation (Continued):
Pharmacodynamic:
Research to find biomarkers that may be predictive of veliparib activity will be conducted.  Serum, 
plasma, blood and archived tissue samples will be collected at designated time points throughout the 
study.
Pharmacogenetic:
DNA samples may be analyzed for genetic factors contributing to the subject's response to veliparib, or 
other study treatment, in terms of pharmacokinetics, efficacy, tolerability and safety .
Safety:
Adverse events, laboratory profiles, physical examinations, vital signs and neurological assessments will 
be evaluated and recorded throughout the study.
Statistical Methods:
Efficacy:
The following end point will be analyzed using data obtained from subjects in Phase 1 and Phase 2 
separately:
Objective Response Rate
The proportion of subjects with objective response (CR or PR) as assessed by [CONTACT_26218] 1.1 will be calculated for all dosed subjects.
The following end point will be analyzed using data obtained from subjects in Phase 2:
Progression-Free Survival
Progression-Free Survival will be defined as the number of days from the date of randomization to the 
date of earliest radiographic disease progression or death.  All disease progression will be included regardless whether the event occurred while the subject was taking study drug or had previously discontinued study drug.  If the subject does not experience disease progression or death, then the data 
will be censored at the date of the last radiographic disease assessment.
Overall Survival
Overall survival will be defined as the number of days from the date of randomization to the date of 
death.  For subjects who did not die, their data will be censored at the date of last study visit or the last 
known date to be alive, whichever is later.  
Duration of Overall Response
Duration of overall response will be defined as the number of days from the date of first response (CR or 
PR) to the earliest documentation of radiographic progressive disease.  If a subject is still responding, then the subject's data will be censored at the date of the subject's last available radiographic disease assessment.  For subjects who never experience response, the subject's data will not be included in the 
analysis.
Performance Status
Changes and/or percent changes from baseline will be summarized using descriptive statistics for each 
scheduled post-baseline visit and for the Final Visit for ECOG performance status.  Post-baseline measurements more than [ADDRESS_25243] 2014-001764-35

Statistical Methods (Continued):
Pharmacokinetic:
Plasma concentrations of veliparib, etoposide, and carboplatin and pharmacokinetic parameter values 
will be tabulated for each subject and each dose level, and summary statistics will be computed for each 
sampling time and each parameter.
The effects of co-administration of veliparib on etoposide pharmacokinetics will be addressed by 
[CONTACT_26219] 1 Day 1 (veliparib with carboplatin and etoposide) and Cycle 2 Day 1 (carboplatin and etoposide alone) etoposide pharmacokinetic variables, including T
max, dose normalized C maxand 
dose normalized AUC.
Pharmacodynamic:
Biomarker results will be tabulated for each subject and each regimen, and summary statistics will be 
computed for each sampling time and each parameter.  The relationship between biomarker status and 
clinical outcome or drug exposure may be examined.
Safety:
●The safety of veliparib in combination with carboplatin/etoposide will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_26220], adverse events, serious adverse events, all deaths, as well as changes in laboratory determinations and vital sign parameters.  Safety will be summarized per dose level using descriptive statistics for the dose escalation cohorts and per treatment arm 
in Phase 2.
●RPTD was determined based on the rate of DLTs and overall tolerability of the combination of

3.0 Introduction
3.1 Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a neuroendocrine carcinoma that exhibits aggressive 
behavior, rapid growth, and early spread to distant sites.  It constitutes approximately 15% of lung carcinomas.  SCLC is staged as limited or extensive stage disease (LD and ED SCLC, respectively).  LD SCLC is defined herein as a disease confined to the hemithorax of origin, with or without the involvement of regional lymph nodes, including ipsilateral and contralateral hilar, ipsilateral and contralateral mediastinal, and ipsilateral supraclavicular nodes.  ED SCLC is defined as all other SCLC.  At presentation, 60% to 70% of SCLC cases in the [LOCATION_002] are diagnosed as extensive-stage disease, for which at present there is no curative treatment.  There has been no significant improvement in the clinical outcome for subjects with ED SCLC in the last [ADDRESS_25258] fatal cancers.  The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommended management approach for ED SCLC is platinum-based doublet systemic chemotherapy, and platinum-etoposide is the most common regimen in the North America and Europe.  This regimen achieves a response rate of 50% to 70%, median survival of 9 – 11 months and median 5-year survival of less than 5%.
1-[ADDRESS_25259] patients relapse and die of their disease.  Previous strategy to improve the outcome of the disease was the use of high intensity chemotherapy which led to an improvement in the response rate; however this did not translate into survival benefit due to heightened toxicities.
4-[ADDRESS_25260] chemotherapy agents as a strategy for improved efficacy has a great potential for improved clinical outcome in this disease.
3.2 Poly (ADP) Ribose Polymerase (PARP)
Poly (ADP) ribose polymerases (PARPs) are a family of enzymes that catalyze the 
addition of ADP-ribose to a variety of cellular molecules.  Several members of PARP family are involved in DNA damage repair, primarily through base excision repair 
Veliparib
M14-[ADDRESS_25261] 2014-001764-35
28
mechanism.7-9  Inactive PARPs 1 and 2 bind to damaged DNA, which leads to their 
auto-activation.  The resulting activated PARP then poly(ADP-ribosyl)ates many nuclear 
target proteins, including those that facilitate DNA repair of both single-stranded or double-stranded DNA breaks.  Thus, inhibition of PARP results in less efficient DNA repair following a DNA damaging insult.  Veliparib potently inhibits PARP-[ADDRESS_25262], and colon.
A detailed discussion of the preclinical toxicology, metabolism, and pharmacology can be 
found in the Investigator's Brochure.

3.3.1 Preclinical Studies and Toxicology
Veliparib is a novel small molecule that is a potent inhibitor of both PARP-1 and PARP-2 
with Ki's of 5 nM and 3 nM, respectively.  In cells under oxidative stress, veliparib inhibits the PARP induced formation of poly-(ADP-ribose) (PAR) with an EC
50of 
2.4 nM.
In cellular assays, veliparib increases sensitivity of tumor cells to DNA-damaging agents 
including platinum agents, irinotecan, cyclophosphamide, temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation.  In preclinical tumor models, veliparib enhances the anti-tumor efficacy of crosslinking agents (cisplatin, carboplatin), alkylating/methylating agents (TMZ, cyclophosphamide), topoisomerase inhibitors (irinotecan) and radiation.
Veliparib has been shown to enhance the efficacy of carboplatin in several xenograft 
tumor models.   
Veliparib
M14-[ADDRESS_25264] 2014-001764-35

The toxicological profile of veliparib has been evaluated in nonclinical general toxicity 
studies that included single-dose (rats and mice), repeat-dose (duration of up to 6 months in rats and up to 9 months in dog), reproductive (embryofetal development in rat and rabbit), genetic (Ames, in vitro cytogenetics, in vivo micronucleus), phototoxicity (in vitro photosensitivity) and juvenile rat toxicity studies.  Primary nonclinical findings included effects on the central nervous system (convulsions, tremors), hematopoietic system (bone marrow depletion), reproductive system (male germ cell depletion, female reproductive tract tissues degeneration), and lymphoid tissues (lymphocyte depletion), 
with lesser effects on the gastrointestinal tract (single-cell necrosis) and cardiovascular system (10% QTc interval prolongation).  All findings were dose-dependent and reversible or self-limited.  Veliparib was genotoxic (induced chromosomal aberrations in vitro and increased micronuclei formation in vivo) and was toxic to the developi[INVESTIGATOR_16103] (increases in the incidence of fetal external/visceral/skeletal malformations/variations) in rats and rabbits.  Veliparib demonstrated no phototoxic potential in photosensitivity tests.
3.3.2 Veliparib Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics
In humans, at least 90% of the dose is absorbed after oral administration of veliparib.  
Veliparib is primarily cleared in the urine as intact parent drug (73% of administered dose), with a small fraction of clearance from metabolism.  Preliminary clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) data available from [ADDRESS_25265] on veliparib bioavailability.  
Veliparib is not a potent inhibitor, nor an inducer, of the major human cytochrome P450s 
(CYPs), suggesting a minimal potential for DDIs at the anticipated therapeutic concentrations.  In study subjects, there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between veliparib and TMZ, and preliminary results indicate the absence of DDI between 
Veliparib
M14-[ADDRESS_25266] 2014-001764-35
31
veliparib and carboplatin/gemcitabine, between veliparib and FOLFIRI, between veliparib 
and carboplatin/paclitaxel, or between veliparib and capecitabine/5-FU.
In Phase 0 Study A10-161, substantial inhibition of PARP activity was observed in tumor 
biopsies collected 3 to 6 hours after dosing in all 3 subjects who received a single dose of 25 mg veliparib (92%, 95%, and 100%).  For subjects receiving 50 mg, PARP activity inhibition in tumor biopsies averaged 75% at 3 to 6 hours after dosing (N = 3) and averaged 74% at 24 hours after dosing (N = 3).  Therefore, both 25 mg and 50 mg veliparib doses were biologically active.
3.3.3 Veliparib Clinical Studies
Veliparib is being investigated in [COMPANY_013]-sponsored studies, in Investigator initiated 
studies (IIS), and in CTEP-sponsored studies.  In these studies, veliparib is administered as monotherapy, combined with a variety of chemotherapeutic agents, or combined with radiation therapy.
Summary preliminary or final efficacy data from  [COMPANY_013] sponsored studies show that 
veliparib has activity in combination with temozolomide (TMZ), with radiotherapy, and 
with carboplatin + paclitaxel.
17Data from non-[COMPANY_013] sponsored studies show veliparib 
has activity as monotherapy for treatment of ovarian cancer18and activity in combination 
with carboplatin + paclitaxel for treatment of early breast cancer.19  Veliparib is currently 
in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical development in combination with several DNA-damaging agents across a variety of cancer indications.
Several clinical studies explored combinations of veliparib with carboplatin-based 
combination chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_26164]/etoposide/veliparib combination.
Phase 1 data from subjects treated with veliparib, carboplatin, and paclitaxel for advanced 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are available from Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) Study 7967.
[ADDRESS_25267] 2014-001764-35
32
(febrile neutropenia and hyponatremia) were observed in 2 of 7 evaluable subjects treated 
at the maximum tolerated dose of veliparib 120 mg BID, paclitaxel 200 mg/m2, and 
carboplatin AUC 6.  The most common AEs reported in this study were neutropenia and fatigue (reported in > 50% of subjects); nausea, thrombocytopenia, and peripheral sensory neuropathy (> 40% of subjects); and anemia, constipation, alopecia, diarrhea, decreased appetite, lymphopenia, and myalgia (> 20% of subjects).
A double-blind, randomized Phase 2 study (Study M10-898) of carboplatin and paclitaxel 
with veliparib or placebo for subjects with advanced NSCLC is complete.  Therapy was delivered for up to 6 cycles with carboplatin AUC 6 (IV) and paclitaxel 200 mg/m
2(IV) 
every 3 weeks plus veliparib/placebo 120 mg BID (PO) on [ADDRESS_25268] completed therapy.  Leukopenia was increased in frequency by < 15% for veliparib versus placebo-treated subjects, and neutropenia was increased in frequency by < 10% for veliparib versus placebo-treated subjects.  No other AE was increased by > 5%.  AEs led to reduction or discontinuation of backbone therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26165] (± 3%) with or without veliparib.  The efficacy data are summarized in Investigator Brochure, version 9.
An ongoing ECOG study E2511 is a Phase 1 and randomized Phase 2 double-blind 
clinical study of cisplatin and etoposide in combination with veliparib or placebo as frontline therapy for ED SCLC.
21In the Phase 1 part of the study the maximum 
administered dose of veliparib in combination with 75 mg/m2cisplatin and 100 mg/m2
etoposide was 100 mg BID.  This dose was selected as the recommended Phase 2 dose for the randomized part of the study, which is currently ongoing.  The Phase 1 part of the study enrolled 9 patients with ED SCLC.  Veliparib was well tolerated at the 60 mg dose (0 of 3 patients with DLT).  DLT was seen in 1 of 6 patients treated at the 100 mg dose (grade 5 cardiac failure; Takotsubo cardiomyopathy).  The same subject experienced G4 respi[INVESTIGATOR_26166] G5 cardiac failure.  The maximum administered dose of veliparib of [ADDRESS_25269] doses of cisplatin and etoposide was defined as the RPTD.  Other Grades 3 – [ADDRESS_25270] 2014-001764-35

attribution included:  neutropenia (6), leukopenia (5), nausea (3), thrombocytopenia (2), 
fatigue (2), hyponatremia (2), dehydration (1), febrile neutropenia (1), and diarrhea (1).  Unconfirmed investigator-assessed efficacy outcome in 7 evaluable patients were stable disease in 2/7 (28.6%), partial response in 4/7 (57.1%) and complete response in 1/7 (14.3%) patients.
[ADDRESS_25271] been exposed to veliparib in [COMPANY_013] and CTEP clinical trials with veliparib administered as monotherapy and as combination therapy to study subjects with various solid and hematological tumors.  Based upon mechanism of action, nonclinical, and clinical data, hematological cytopenias (thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia, and lymphopenia) are toxicities that may result from veliparib therapy.  When veliparib is administered as single-agent therapy, these toxicities are predominantly Grade [ADDRESS_25272] been as expected with DNA-damaging agents and are manageable with routine oncology supportive care.  Potential risks of veliparib administration, identified mostly in preclinical studies or based on pharmacological mechanism, but not confirmed in clinical studies, are seizures, changes in testes/ovaries, and toxicity to the developi[INVESTIGATOR_16103].  A potential risk of secondary malignancies is theoretical based on veliparib's mechanism of action.

3.4 Carboplatin and Etoposide
Carboplatin is a commonly used platinum compound that acts by [CONTACT_26221] (DNA) and interrupting cell division.  It is approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) for the treatment of patients with ovarian cancer.  It is also used for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small cell lung cancer

recently in breast cancer.  Carboplatin is eliminated by [CONTACT_13624].  The clearance is related to the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).  Therefore it is dosed based on the GFR and the target area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC).  The main side effect of carboplatin is myelosuppression.  Other toxicities include nausea, vomiting, renal and neurotoxicity.
22,[ADDRESS_25274] appears to be at the G2 portion of the cell cycle in mammalian cells.  Hematologic toxicity (myelosuppression) is the most frequently observed toxicity of etoposide.  Other frequent toxicities include nausea and vomiting, anorexia and alopecia.

Carboplatin in combination with etoposide (both IV and oral formulations) has been extensively tested in randomized clinical trials in SCLC as well as in other tumor types.
24-[ADDRESS_25275] frequently reported adverse events in subjects treated with carboplatin 
and etoposide combination were myelosuppression (leukopenia and thrombocytopenia), nausea, vomiting and alopecia.
The recommended dose of carboplatin for this combination is AUC of 5 – 6 mg/mL*min 
on Day 1 and the dose for etoposide 100 mg/m

NCCN 2014 guidelines for the treatment of ED SCLC.
3.5 Study Rationale
The proposed study has the potential to advance the management of SCLC if it results in 
improved clinical outcome as anticipated, based on preclinical evaluation.
DNA damaging agents constitute the mainstay of therapy for SCLC.  The combination of 
DNA damaging cytotoxic chemotherapy (e.g., cisplatin and etoposide) and a 
Veliparib
M14-[ADDRESS_25276] 2014-001764-35
35
pharmacologic inhibitor of DNA damage repair enzyme, poly (ADP) Ribose polymerase 
(PARP), may result in greater cytotoxicity and antitumor efficacy of the cytotoxic agents.  It is postulated that enhanced efficacy may translate into improved disease progression without concomitant increased toxicity in subjects with extensive stage SCLC.
The in vitro and in vivo studies of veliparib and standard cytotoxic agents for SCLC 
including cisplatin, carboplatin and etoposide, discussed in the preceding sections provide specific supporting evidence for the clinical evaluation of veliparib as an agent that can further potentiate currently available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26167].  Similar strategies are currently in clinical translation for various types of cancer including melanoma, breast and ovarian cancers.

3.6 Differences Statement
This study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of veliparib in combination 
with carboplatin and etoposide in subjects with small cell lung cancer or advanced/metastatic solid tumors.  This is the first study being conducted with this combination of treatment.  Previous early phase studies have been designed to test the safety and tolerability of veliparib as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy.

Day 1 and etoposide 100 mg/m2on Days 1 – [ADDRESS_25279] therapy.  
Preliminary safety data from several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies indicate that veliparib is tolerated in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel at doses of up to 120 – [ADDRESS_25280] clinical practices to manage the toxicity of carboplatin + etoposide are well established.  Toxicity will be closely monitored at all study visits.  Toxicities of veliparib expected to overlap with the toxicity of carboplatin + etoposide regimen include nausea/vomiting and myelosuppression.  Other potential risks of veliparib administration, identified in preclinical studies or based on pharmacological mechanism, but not confirmed in clinical studies must also be considered.  These risks include seizures, changes in testes/ovaries, toxicity to the developi[INVESTIGATOR_26168].  Addition of veliparib resulted in no compromise to the delivery of carboplatin.  Drug-drug interaction with etoposide is not anticipated, but will be monitored.

5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose escalation/ Phase [ADDRESS_25283] carboplatin/etoposide regimen based on the observed toxicities.  Subjects in Phase 2 will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to carboplatin, etoposide, placebo followed by [CONTACT_26230], or carboplatin, etoposide, veliparib followed by [CONTACT_26231].  Approximately 215 adult male or female subjects diagnosed with extensive stage disease SCLC or other advanced/metastatic solid tumors will be selected to participate in the study according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Veliparib
M14-[ADDRESS_25284] 2014-001764-35
39
The study was designed to enroll approximately 35 subjects in Phase 1 and approximately 
180 subjects in Phase 2 to meet scientific and regulatory objectives without enrolling an undue number of subjects in alignment with ethical considerations.  Possible dose levelsto be evaluated are as shown in Table 4.
Phase 1 Dose Escalation
The Phase 1 portion of this study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), RPTD, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of veliparib in combination with carboplatin and etoposide in 21-day cycles in subjects with small cell lung cancer or advanced/metastatic solid tumors with possible schedules outlined in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3.  For the Phase 1 subjects receiving 
non-continuous dosing, veliparib in Cycle 2 will be administered on Days 2 – 5 or Days 2 – 12 dependent on the dosing schedule to allow for evaluation of drug-drug interaction of veliparib with etoposide ( Table 2).  Details on drug administration and cycle schedules are 
described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .

Upon completion of 4 cycles of combination therapy, subjects without evidence of disease 
progression will continue on maintenance monotherapy veliparib 400 mg BID until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  Subjects who will be receiving prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) will have maintenance veliparib interrupted for the duration of radiotherapy as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].
For subjects in the Phase [ADDRESS_25286] dose-escalation. Study procedures are provided in the Schedule of Assessments and Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic tables (Section 5.3.1).
All subjects will be monitored for DLTs during DLT observation period (Cycle 1 Day –2 to pre-dose on Cycle 2 Day 1), and treatment-related adverse events (AEs) will be evaluated throughout the course of the study for evidence of acute, delayed, or cumulative toxicities.
Veliparib

41
Subjects who do not complete the DLT observation period for reasons other than DLT 
(e.g., withdraw consent, non-compliance, etc.) will be replaced to ensure appropriate number of subjects are evaluated.
The dose levels of veliparib to be evaluated in the dose-escalation portion of this study 
were determined based on the outcome of prior clinical studies of veliparib as well as on pre-clinical toxicology, toxicokinetic, and nonclinical anti-tumor efficacy studies.  The following dose levels may be evaluated in the dose-escalation portion of the study:  80, 120, 160, 200 and 240 mg BID ( Table 4 ).  Reduced dose levels may be evaluated based 
upon review of subject safety and PK data.  Intermediate dose levels may be evaluated based upon review of subject safety including, but not limited to, Grade 2 study-drug related AEs.  If the MTD is not reached at veliparib 200 mg BID dose level, higher dose levels (with no more than 25% veliparib dose increments, and not exceeding single agent veliparib RPTD of 400 mg BID ( Table 4, Levels V – VIII) or alternative veliparib dosing 
schedules may be evaluated at the discretion of the sponsor.  The alternative dosing schedules can include dosing veliparib for Day –2 to Day 12 (14-day schedule) and/or Day –2 to Day 19 (continuous schedule) of the 21 day cycle ( Table 1, Table 2 and 
Table 3).  The initial dose for these schedules will be 200 mg BID or the maximum administered dose (MAD), not exceeding the MTD in the [ADDRESS_25288] 2014-001764-35

A "3 + 3" escalation rule will be used for the dose-escalation portion of this study, with a 
condition applied for the Dose Level 1, which will allow 3 additional subjects to be entered in Dose Level 1 if 2 of 6 initial subjects experience DLTs.  Enrollment of the 3 additional subjects at all dose levels will depend on a review of the specific DLTs observed and discussion with the Investigators.
A minimum of 3 evaluable subjects will be enrolled at each dose level.  Additional 
eligible subjects may be enrolled at the current dose level at the discretion of the Investigators and the [COMPANY_013] TA MD.  The dose escalation decisions will be made following the completion of the DLT observation period for the evaluable subjects in the intended cohort size.  If a cohort is over-enrolled, reported toxicities in additional subjects will be taken into consideration.
Dose-Escalation Criteria: 
AEs, clinical laboratory results and vital signs will be assessed throughout the study in 
each dose-escalation cohort.  
DLTs will be assessed in each dose-escalation cohort during DLT observation period 
(Cycle 1 Day –2 to pre-dose Cycle 2 Day 1).  Based on the safety and tolerability of study 
Veliparib
M14-[ADDRESS_25289] 3 subjects, escalation 
to a subsequent dose level or expansion of the current dose level will occur based upon the following criteria ( Table 5 ):
Table 5. Dose Escalation Guidelines
Number of Subjects with 
DLT in the First Cycle Escalation Decision Rule
0 out of 3 Enter 3 subjects at the next dose level.
1 out of 3 Add 3 more subjects at current dose level.  If [COMPANY_013] or the investigator 
considers the DLT(s) is clinically significant, [COMPANY_013] will determine if it is 
appropriate to add more patients at this dose level.
●If < 2 of 6 subjects (or < 33% of subjects) experience DLT, dose 
escalation will proceed to the next dose level.
●If ≥ 2 of total 6 subjects (or ≥ 33% of subjects) experience DLTs, then 
dose escalation will be stopped.*
≥ 2 out of 3 or 6 Dose escalation will be stopped.  *Additional subjects will be enrolled at 
the previous lower dose level as needed.  The following exceptions apply to Dose Level 1:
●If 2 of 6 initial subjects at Dose Level 1 experience DLTs, 3 additional 
subjects may be entered and the cohort will be expanded up to 
9 subjects for further DLT assessment.  
oEnrollment of the 3 additional subjects will depend on a review of the specific DLTs observed and discussion with the Investigators.  
●If 2 of 9 subjects at Dose Level 1 experience DLTs, then escalation to the next dose level may proceed.
●If > 2 of 9 subjects in Dose Level 1 experience DLTs, dose-escalation will stop.
* If 2 out of 6 subjects experience different DLTs, for example nausea and neutropenia, the data will be reviewed by 
[CONTACT_26232] 3 additional subjects should be added at that dose level.  If 3 subjects 
will be added and none experience DLTs, this dose level will be declared the MTD.
An MTD and/or maximum administered dose (MAD), and RPTD, will be determined.  
The MTD is defined as the maximum dose at which < 2 of 6 or ≤ [ADDRESS_25290] 9 subjects will be treated at the RPTD.
DLT Definition:  DLT is defined as any of the following drug-related toxicities occurring 
during the DLT observation period (Cycle 1 Day –2 to Cycle 2 Day 1) in any of the dose-escalation cohorts, with grading according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0
20:
1. Cycle 1 events associated with treatment delay > 14 days in initiating Cycle 2 
chemotherapy:
a. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets < 25.0 × 109/L)
b. Grade 4 neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 0.5 × 109/L)
c. Grade 3 febrile neutropenia with fever lasting for > 7 days
d. Grade 4 febrile neutropenia of any duration
NOTE:  Delay of more than 14 days in initiating Cycle 2 due to factors not directly 
related to treatment emergent toxicity will not be considered a DLT.
2. Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_25291] 2 grade increase from 
baseline and is attributed to veliparib treatment:
a. Exclusion:  nausea and vomiting lasting ≤ 48 hours or inadequately treated
b. Exclusion:  electrolyte abnormalities resolving within ≤ 24 hours
c. Exclusion:  hypersensitivity reactions
d. Exclusion:  alopecia
3. Grade [ADDRESS_25292] 2 grade increase from

b. Omission of carboplatin, > 1 daily etoposide dose, or > 30% veliparib doses in 
Cycle 1
Subjects experiencing DLT(s) during the DLT observation period will require an 
interruption of study drugs and possible discontinuation from further participation in the study.  Veliparib may be reintroduced at a reduced dose, if the toxicity returns to ≤Grade [ADDRESS_25295] will be considered evaluable for DLT if he/she has completed the DLT 
evaluation period with the assigned regimen (full dose carboplatin, at least two doses of etoposide, with ≥ 80% compliance of veliparib) or discontinued Cycle 1 due to a DLT.  
All cohort sizes and numbers of subjects in the Phase 1 dose escalation criteria section above refer to evaluable subjects.  Any subjects who discontinue from study prior to the completion of the DLT evaluation period for any reason other than a DLT will be replaced.
Phase 1 Pharmacokinetics
Pharmacokinetics of veliparib and etoposide will be assessed to determine the drug-drug 
interactions.  Further pharmacokinetics of carboplatin will be assessed on Day 1 of Cycle 1 (please reference Table 10 and Table 11 .)

discontinuation (Section 5.4.1).
Phase 2 Randomized Double -Blind
The veliparib dose and schedule for the Phase 2 was determined to be 240 mg BID on a 14 day schedule based on the analysis of Phase 1 data.
Approximately 180 total subjects with treatment-naïve ED SCLC will be enrolled at the 
240 mg BID veliparib/placebo dose and 14 day schedule in the Phase 2 double-blinded portion of the study.  They will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three treatment arms: 
Arm A:  veliparib 240 mg in combination with carboplatin/etoposide followed by 
[CONTACT_26233] 400 mg BID monotherapy
Arm B:  veliparib 240 mg in combination with carboplatin/etoposide followed by [CONTACT_26234] C:  placebo in combination with carboplatin/etoposide followed by [CONTACT_26235] 2 study arms will receive a minimum of 4 cycles of combination 
therapy unless disease progression or unacceptable toxicity warrants earlier discontinuation from the treatment.  Additional 2 cycles of combination therapy (e.g., up to a total of 6 cycles) may be administered at the investigators discretion if subject status at the completion of initial 4 cycles warrants continued combination treatment and/or if local SOC guidelines require 6 cycles of platinum-based therapy.  In the combination cycles of Arms A and B, subjects will receive veliparib at 240 mg BID on a 14-day schedule, Arm C will receive matching placebo.  After completion of the chemotherapy combination cycles (at least 4), subjects without evidence of disease progression will receive veliparib at 400 mg BID continuous dosing (21-day cycles) (Arms A), or 
Veliparib

For Phase 1 subjects, adjuvant/neoadjuvant radiotherapy is allowed if completed 
≥12 months prior to Cycle 1 Day –2 and the field did not involve > 10% of bone marrow 
reserve.
Phase [ADDRESS_25313] any prior antitumor 
treatment for the disease under study.  For the purposes of this protocol, antitumor treatment is defined as systemic anticancer agents (cytotoxic chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy), radiotherapy, and investigational anti-cancer agents.  For subjects in Phase 2, radiotherapy to a single lesion with the intent of symptom palliation (irradiated lesion will not be used as a target lesion for RECIST evaluations) is allowed, if completed at least 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day –2.

[IP_ADDRESS] Concomitant Therapy
The locally approved product label, institutional guidelines, local practice, or applicable 
Summary of Product Characterizations (SmPC) for carboplatin and etoposide should be referenced for any concomitant therapy guidelines.
Premedication: The prophylactic antiemetics, including 5-HT3 antagonists, according to 
institution, National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), European 
Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) or American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines should be given, prior to administration of carboplatin and etoposide.  Prophylaxis with anti-emetics (e.g., 5-HT3 
antagonists such as ondansetron) is strongly recommended when initiating 
single agent veliparib/placebo maintenance monotherapy.
Anticancer Agents: Other anticancer agents are not permitted during the treatment portion of the 
study.  All subjects will receive carboplatin + etoposide with veliparib/placebo at specified timepoints during the treatment portion of the study.  The locally approved carboplatin and etoposide product labels or SmPCs should be referenced to determine if there are any contraindications associated with 
concomitant medications (e.g., phenytoin, etc.).
Supportive Care: Best supportive care and treatment will be given as appropriate to each subject 
(antiemetics, antibiotics, transfusions, nutritional support, palliative treatment 
for pain, bisphosphonates or denosumab) according to institutional or clinical 
practice guidelines (e.g., ASCO, ESMO, or NCCN).
Growth Factors: Biologic response modifiers administered for erythropoiesis 
(e.g., erythropoietin, darbepoetin alpha) and colony stimulating factors 
(e.g., neulasta, G-CSF, GM CSF, etc.) may be administered according to institutional or clinical practice guidelines (e.g., ASCO, ESMO, or NCCN).  Growth factors prophylaxis will not be allowed in Cycle 1 (Day –2 through Day 21) of the dose escalation cohorts.  Growth factors prophylaxis is 
acceptable in Phase 2.

Radiation: Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is allowed during the study in the 
Maintenance phase of treatment at Investigators discretion.  The dose of PCI 
should be 24 Gy in 8 fractions of 3 Gy each, or per local treatment standards.  Veliparib or placebo maintenance monotherapy will be held starting 2 days prior to the initiation of radiation therapy, throughout the radiation therapy and for 4 days following radiation therapy.  Palliative radiation to a non-target lesion with the intent of symptom control is allowed; non-progressing status of lesion to be irradiated must be documented prior to the procedure.  Radiation to non-target lesions for other reasons will not be allowed during combination treatment cycles and generally will not be allowed during maintenance; exceptional circumstances that may arise during maintenance must be discussed with [COMPANY_013] TA MD and non-progressing status of such lesions using the same modality as study tumor assessments will have to be documented prior to
procedure.
Surgery: If the subject requires surgery during the study, then this needs to be discussed 
with the [COMPANY_013] TA MD.
Alternate Therapy: No traditional herbal anti-cancer medicine (e.g., Chinese, Asian, etc.) may be 
taken concurrently with veliparib (a 14-day washout period must be documented).

[IP_ADDRESS] Study Procedures
Unless otherwise stated, the baseline measurement for any given variable will be defined 
as the last value obtained for the variable prior to the first dose of study drug.
The study procedures outlined in Table 7 and Table 8 are discussed in detail in this
section, with the exception of the monitoring of treatment compliance (discussed in 
Section 5.5.7) and adverse event information (discussed in Section 6.0).  All study data 
will be recorded on eCRFs with supporting source documentation.
Screening procedures should be performed within 28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day –2.  If the 
screening visit is performed greater than 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day –2, the physical exam, laboratory tests, and pregnancy test (for female subjects of childbearing potential) must be repeated on Cycle 1 Day –2.  Vital signs and performance status assessments will be performed on Cycle 1 Day –2 for all subjects.  Baseline radiographic tumor assessments per computed tomography (CT) with IV contrast/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest, abdomen, pelvis and head (if CNS metastases are suspected) will be conducted within 21 days prior to Cycle 1 Day –2.  If the subject is unable to undergo a CT scan with IV contrast due to allergy or renal insufficiency, a non-contrast CT may be performed.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be conducted in cases where local laws/requirements mandate, but should have Sponsor approval prior to performing the MRI.
For procedures performed at Screening and repeated, the later procedure performed prior 
to dosing will serve as a baseline for clinical assessment.  Subsequent study procedures should be performed approximately within ± 1 day on days of IV infusion of carboplatin and etoposide and ± [ADDRESS_25347] 2014-001764-35

order to participate in this study.  A separate optional informed consent will be required 
for pharmacogenetic testing.  Details about how informed consent will be obtained and documented are provided in Section 9.3.
Subjects will be considered screen failures if the informed consent has been signed and a study specific procedure has been performed (e.g., central laboratories drawn), but subject does not enter into the study.  The reason for screen failure will be documented in the source and will be captured in the eCRF.
Medical History
A complete medical history, including alcohol, tobacco and nicotine-containing product 
use history, will be taken at Screening.  The medical history includes complete medical history, including documentation of any clinically significant medical condition; the presence and severity of any symptoms/conditions associated with SCLC; and detailed SCLC oncology history (histology, staging, date of diagnosis, tumor burden, metastatic sites, surgical history).
On Cycle 1 Day –2, any changes observed from the screening assessments, prior to 
dosing, will be recorded in the subject's medical history.  At each subsequent visit, the subject's medical history will be reviewed and any clinically significant changes from baseline will be recorded in the source documents and on the adverse event eCRF.
Physical Examination
A physical examination, including body weight, will be performed per Table [ADDRESS_25348] label, local practice, or applicable SmPC.  If the Screening physical examination is performed within 7 days of Cycle 1 Day –2, it is not required to repeat the exam on Cycle 1 Day –[ADDRESS_25349] will wear lightweight 
clothing and no shoes during weighing.
Vital Signs
Vital signs will be performed per Table 7 and Table 8 .  Vital sign determinations include 
sitting blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature.  If possible, blood pressure and 
heart rate measurements should not immediately follow scheduled blood collections.
12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)
A resting single ECG will be performed per as per Table 7 and Table 8 .  A qualified 
physician will determine whether any findings outside of normal physiological variation 
are clinically significant (in consultation with a cardiologist if necessary).  The physician will document whether findings are clinically significant (CS) or not clinically significant (NCS) on the tracing and sign and date the tracing.  The original annotated ECG tracing along with a photocopy of the tracing containing the physician's assessment will be retained in the subject's records at the study site.
ECOG Performance Status
The ECOG performance status will be assessed per Table 7 and Table 8 as follows:
Grade ECOG
0 Fully Active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without 
restriction.
1 Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry 
out work of a light or sedentary nature, e.g., light housework, office work.
2 Ambulatory and capable of all self-care but unable to carry out any work 
activities.  Up and about more than 50% of waking hours.
3 Capable of only limited self-care, confined to bed or chair more than 50% 
of waking hours.
Veliparib
M14-[ADDRESS_25350], the investigator will document non-childbearing status 
(surgically sterile or post-menopausal for at least 1 year) or potential childbearing status.  Subjects with non-childbearing status do not require pregnancy tests.  For subjects of childbearing potential, a serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screening and the results must be available prior to the administration of the first dose of study drug on Cycle 1 Day –2.  A urine pregnancy test should also be performed prior to dosing on Cycle 1 Day –2 if > [ADDRESS_25351] she is pregnant while 
participating in this study, she should inform the treating investigator immediately (Section 6.7).
Hepatitis Screen
Subjects with history of hepatitis C (HCV) must be tested for HCV RNA at screening if no documented test result is available from within 3 months from the date of informed consent, and for Phase 2 if status within 3 months of the study entry is unknown.  Subjects with history of hepatitis B (HBV) must be tested for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) at screening if no documented test result is available from within [ADDRESS_25352] 2014-001764-35
72
Clinical Laboratory Tests
Samples for chemistry, hematology and urinalysis will be collected per Table 7 (Phase 1) 
and Table 8 (Phase 2).  Specific laboratory assessments are outlined in Table 12 .
All study samples will be shipped to the central laboratory, and central laboratory results 
will be used for data analysis.  A certified local laboratory may be used to perform laboratory analyses for immediate treatment decisions; however, split or concurrent samples must be drawn and sent to the central laboratory for analysis.  The central laboratory will provide instructions regarding the collection, processing and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_26172].
Sites will obtain the estimated creatinine clearance locally.Qualified medical staff at the site will review, initial and date all local and central 
laboratory results.  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that is considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_26242].  Clinically significant laboratory values will be recorded as adverse events if they meet the criteria as specified in Section 6.6.
For any laboratory test value outside the reference range that the investigator considers being clinically significant:
●The investigator will follow the out-of-range value to a satisfactory clinical 
resolution.
●A laboratory test value that requires a subject to be discontinued from the 
study or requires a subject to receive treatment will be recorded as an adverse 
event.
Study samples for central laboratory analysis may be performed within 48 hours of the 
scheduled day.  A qualified (e.g., certification or accreditation) local laboratory may be used to perform laboratory analyses for treatment decisions but this cannot replace the central laboratory analysis on a protocol defined visit.

If HBsAg/HCV RNA status is unknown it must be tested at screening for Phase 2 subjects.  Testing will be performed by [CONTACT_456]-designated central laboratory.
Tumor Assessments (Radiographic)
A CT scan with contrast will be used in the evaluation of tumor responses with RECIST 
version 1.1.  The scanned areas will include chest, abdomen and pelvis at all radiographic assessments, and head CT as warranted by [CONTACT_26243][INVESTIGATOR_26171].
If the subject is unable to undergo a CT scan with IV contrast due to allergy or renal 
insufficiency, a non-contrast CT may be performed.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

can be conducted in cases where local laws/requirements mandate but should have 
Sponsor approval prior to performing the MRI.
Subjects will continue to be monitored by [CONTACT_26244].
Sites may be requested to electronically transfer copi[INVESTIGATOR_26173] [ADDRESS_25355] for scans becomes necessary.
Tumor Assessments Schedule
Tumor assessments will be performed until radiographic disease progression.  Tumor 
assessment and assessment of response will occur every 6 weeks (± 1 week) from C1D-[ADDRESS_25356] 24 weeks (Phase 1) or 30 weeks (Phase 2), then every 9 weeks (± 1 week) thereafter.  Tumor response will be determined according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Version 1.1.  Tumor assessment is to be performed at the Final Visit for subjects who discontinue the study for reasons other than radiographic progression and if no assessment has been performed within the last 4 weeks.  An unscheduled assessment should be obtained in such subjects if a Final Visit will not be conducted.
For Phase 2, the protocol defined tumor assessment schedule should be maintained 
independent of any treatment delays or changes.
Refer to Appendix C "RECIST (Version 1.1) for Tumor Response (PFS)" for response 
criteria and guidelines. 
Post-Treatment Follow-Up
Subjects who discontinue all study drugs prior to reaching an event of radiographic 
progression must enter into Post-Treatment Follow-Up.  Subjects will remain on study 
Veliparib
M14-[ADDRESS_25357] 2014-001764-35
75
(off study drug) and will continue to receive tumor assessments according to the protocol 
defined tumor assessment schedule until reaching an event of radiographic progression. 
Subjects who discontinue all study drugs due to toxicity should have a 30-day Follow-up 
visit prior to entering into Post-Treatment Follow-Up to ensure all toxicities have 
resolved.  Subjects will have a Final Visit and be discontinued from the study upon reaching an event of radiographic progression, if the Investigator determines they should be discontinued for any other reason or if the subject withdraws consent.
Survival Follow-Up (Phase 2 Only)
All discontinued subjects will have survival information collected via electronic data 
capture (EDC) at two month intervals (or as requested by [CONTACT_26216]) after the subject discontinues the study and continuing until the endpoint of death, the subject has become lost to follow-up, or [COMPANY_013] terminates the study.  
All subjects will be followed for survival information (i.e., the date and cause of death or 
last known alive date if not deceased) unless the subject requests to be withdrawn specifically from study survival follow-up; this request must be documented in the subject's medical record and signed by [CONTACT_737].
If known, post treatment anti-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], dates of initiation, and end dates will be 
collected.
If the subject withdraws from survival follow-up, the study staff may use a public 
information source (such as county records) to obtain information about survival status only, as appropriate per local regulations.
Randomization and Subject Number Assignment
An Interactive Response Technology System (IRT) will be utilized to register subjects.
The site will access the IRT system at Screening, after the subject signs informed consent 
and a unique subject number will be provided.  Subjects who complete all Screening 
Veliparib
M14-[ADDRESS_25358] 2014-001764-35
76
procedures and meet the eligibility criteria will proceed to dosing.  Subjects who sign 
consent and do not meet the eligibility criteria will be considered a screen failure and the reason for screen failure will be documented in the source and in the eCRF.  Subjects will also be registered as a screen failure in the IRT system.
Subjects in Phase 2 who complete all Screening procedures and meet the eligibility 
criteria will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three treatment arms:  
Arm A:  veliparib 240 mg in combination with carboplatin/etoposide followed by 
[CONTACT_26233] 400 mg BID monotherapy
Arm B:  veliparib 240 mg in combination with carboplatin/etoposide followed by [CONTACT_26234] C:  placebo in combination with carboplatin/etoposide followed by [CONTACT_26245]
A bottle number randomization schedule and a subject randomization schedule will be 
generated by [CONTACT_26246].  A copy of all randomization schedules will be kept by [CONTACT_26247] a copy will be forwarded to the IRT vendor.

If pharmacogenetic (PG) testing is performed, results from individual subjects will be kept 
coded and confidential and will not be given to anyone not directly involved with this research study.  [COMPANY_013] will store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality.  Samples will be coded so that subject identities will not be available to the scientists conducting the genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_26174].  Individual subject results will not be provided to the Investigator so that neither the subject nor the Investigator will have knowledge of specific subject genotypes.  [COMPANY_013] will keep the DNA samples until destroyed by [CONTACT_26248].  These samples will not be stored longer than 20 years or per country requirement.
[IP_ADDRESS] Collection and Handling of Pharmacodynamic Variables
Pharmacodynamic correlative studies are exploratory in nature.  Serum, plasma and tissue 
specimens may be utilized to evaluate known and novel markers (nucleic acids, peptides/proteins and/or metabolites) of disease status.  PD variables will be further discussed in Section 5.3.7 .
Blood Collection for Plasma Markers
Twelve (12) mL (Cycle 1 Day –2 or Final Visit) or 6 mL (all other time points) of blood will be collected pre-dose by [CONTACT_26249] [ADDRESS_25360] 2014-001764-35
78
Blood Collection for Serum Markers
Approximately 5 mL of blood will be collected pre-dose by [CONTACT_26250] 9.  The collection, processing and storage should be performed as 
described in the study specific laboratory manual.  The complete process of clot formation, centrifugation, transfer to cryovials and freezing should be accomplished in less than 90 minutes from the time of blood draw.
Tissue Collection for IHC, ELISA and FISH DNA Mutational/Methylation Analysis
Archived Tissue Specimens:
Subjects must consent to provide available archived tissue for analysis.  It is recognized 
that samples suitable for analysis will not be available from all consenting subjects.  The most recent archived biopsy is preferred and should be obtained at Cycle 1 Day –2, if possible.  While sending FFPE blocks is preferred, slides prepared by [CONTACT_26251].  Study specific biopsies are not required for subject participation.
[IP_ADDRESS] Shipment of Pharmacodynamic Samples

[IP_ADDRESS] Handling/Processing of Samples
The processing and storage of the PK samples for veliparib, carboplatin and etoposide 
should be performed as described in the study specific laboratory manual.
[COMPANY_013] or a designated laboratory will store the pharmacokinetic samples in a secure 
storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality.  To increase confidence in trends, remaining sample aliquots may be used to perform replicate tests, or sample analysis at additional time points for tests currently identified in the protocol.  The placebo samples may not be analyzed to confirm the absence of veliparib.  Upon completion of this research, [COMPANY_013] or a designated laboratory will destroy the samples.
[IP_ADDRESS] Disposition of Samples
The frozen plasma samples for veliparib, carboplatin and etoposide assays will be packed 
in dry ice sufficient to last during transport and shipped from the study site to the central laboratory according to instructions in the central laboratory manual.
[IP_ADDRESS] Measurement Methods
Analysis of Plasma Samples
Plasma concentrations of veliparib will be determined under the supervision of the Drug 
Analysis Department at [COMPANY_013].  Placebo samples may or may not be analyzed to confirm the absence of veliparib (ABT-888).  Plasma concentrations of etoposide and carboplatin will be determined at external laboratories using validated assays under the supervision of the Drug Analysis Department at [COMPANY_013].

measurable lesions over the course of therapy must be evaluated using the criteria 
presented in Appendix C .  Tumor assessments will be performed until disease 
progression.  See tumor assessment schedule in Section [IP_ADDRESS].
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of Disease Progression
Disease progression will be defined as radiographic progression of disease as determined 
by [CONTACT_26253] (Version 1.1) Appendix C .
Clinical progression as determined by [CONTACT_093], which may be characterized as, but not limited to:
●Increase in at least two points of ECOG performance status attributable to 
cancer progression;
●Subject requires non-palliative radiation, chemotherapy or surgery due to 
progressive disease;
●Death from progressive disease.
In cases where an Investigator determines that a subject has met the criteria for clinical 
disease progression, every effort should be made to confirm the progression radiographically.

5.3.5 Pharmacokinetic Variables
Values for pharmacokinetic parameters of veliparib, including the maximum observed 
plasma concentration (C
max), the time to C max(peak time, T max), the area under the plasma 
concentration-time curve from time [ADDRESS_25365] measurable concentration (AUC t) 
will be determined for veliparib doses on Day [ADDRESS_25366] measurable concentration (AUC t) and from time 0 to time infinity (AUC ∞), 
clearance and terminal half-life will be determined on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of 
Cycle 2 using noncompartmental methods.
Values for compartmental pharmacokinetic parameters of carboplatin in the dose 
escalation cohorts (such as volume of distribution and clearance) and of veliparib in the Phase 2 part of the study such as rate of absorption (K
a), apparent volume of distribution 
(V/F) and oral clearance (CL/F) may be estimated using a nonlinear mixed-effect population modeling approach with NONMEM software and reported in a separate pharmacokinetic report.
5.3.[ADDRESS_25367]'s response to veliparib, (or other study treatment) in terms of pharmacokinetics, efficacy, tolerability, and safety.  Such genetic factors may include 
Veliparib
M14-[ADDRESS_25368], other genes believed to be related to the disease or to drug response.  Some genes currently insufficiently characterized or unknown may be understood to be important at the time of analysis.  The samples may be analyzed as part of a multi-study assessment of genetic factors involved in the response to veliparib, drugs of this class, or the disease state.  The samples may also be used for the development of diagnostic tests related to veliparib, drugs of this class, or the disease state.  The results of pharmacogenetic analyses will not be reported to subjects and may not be reported with the study summary.
5.3.7 Pharmacodynamic Variables
Several putative biomarkers of efficacy and response may be evaluated in this protocol 
with the goal of exploring the relationship between tumor response and/or disease status.
Biospecimens collected may be evaluated for genetic lesions whether they occur by 
[CONTACT_26254], chromosomal loss and/or mutational/methylation with the intent of identifying potential associations with subject outcome or to better characterize the disease.  These characterizations may be included, but are not limited, characterization of gene methylation/mutational status or copy number changes of genes, particularly those involved in DNA repair pathways.  Additional analysis aimed at identifying underlying defects in the homologous recombination pathway, regardless of etiology, may be performed and associated with response.
Biospecimens may be evaluated for levels of biomarkers including nucleic acids, 
proteins/peptides and metabolites.  For example, analysis of proteins, including but not limited to proteins involved in DNA repair, such as ERCC1 and XPF, may be performed on tumor tissue obtained from each consented subject and associated with response.
Samples collected during the course of this study may be banked and used in the future to 
investigate new scientific questions related to this study.  Additionally, the samples may be anonymized and used for diagnostic test development.  [COMPANY_013] (or a designated 
Veliparib
M14-[ADDRESS_25369] 2014-001764-35

laboratory) will store the samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to 
protect confidentiality.  The samples will be retained while research on veliparib (or drugs of this class) continues for up to but no longer than [ADDRESS_25370] discontinuation from the study (without reaching a protocol-defined 
endpoint) is planned, the Investigator is to notify the [COMPANY_013] TA MD or the clinical team representative (Section 7.0) via telephone as soon as possible (provided, in each case, 
subject care and safety are not compromised).  If not notified prior to discontinuation, the [COMPANY_013] TA MD may contact [CONTACT_26255].
If a subject is discontinued from the study with an ongoing adverse event or an unresolved 
laboratory result that is significantly outside of the reference range, the investigator will attempt to provide follow-up until a satisfactory clinical resolution of the laboratory result or adverse event is achieved.
In the event that a positive result is obtained on a pregnancy test for a subject or a subject 
reports becoming pregnant during the study, the administration of study drug to that subject must be discontinued immediately.  The investigator must report a pregnancy within [ADDRESS_25371]-Treatment Follow-Up period of the study by [CONTACT_26256] (unless medical contraindication is noted) until disease progression (Table 8).
Final Visit
The visit at which an investigator identifies disease progression or at which a subject meets other criteria for study discontinuation will be considered the Final Visit.  The reason(s) for the discontinuation from the study will be recorded and assessments will be performed per Table [ADDRESS_25372]'s condition.
30-Day Follow-Up Visit
Subjects who discontinue treatment for reasons other than radiographic progression will 
have a Follow-Up Visit approximately [ADDRESS_25373] survival information collected via electronic data 
capture (EDC) at 2 month intervals (or as requested by [CONTACT_26216]) after the subject discontinues the study and continuing until the endpoint of death, the subject has become lost to follow-up, or [COMPANY_013] terminates the study.

5.5.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
(Phase 1 Dose Escalation)
In the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of the study, there is no randomization schedule; 
however, an IRT system will still be utilized to assign subject numbers.  Subject numbers will be assigned by [CONTACT_26264].
5.5.4 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
(Phase 2 Randomized Double-Blind)
All subjects will be randomized using an IRT system.  Before the study is initiated, the 
IRT user manual, which provides instruction on how to use the system via the web or phone, will be provided to each site.
Subjects who complete all Screening procedures and meet eligibility criteria may proceed 
to randomization.  Subject randomization will be stratified by:  [CONTACT_26265] ( ≤ ULN versus 
> ULN), and gender; therefore a subject's baseline LDH value must be known prior to randomization and when accessing the IRT to perform the randomization transaction.
The site will contact [CONTACT_26266] a Screening (subject) number once the subject has 
signed the informed consent and a study-specific procedure has been performed (i.e., central laboratory samples drawn).  Once the subject number is assigned, if the subject is not enrolled/randomized the reason for screen failure will be documented in the source document and in the eCRF.

Phase 1 Dose Escalation
All Phase 1 subjects will receive veliparib orally.  Depending on the dosing schedule 
assigned, veliparib will be dosed twice a day on Days –2 through 5 (7-day schedule) or Days –2 through 12 (14-day schedule) of 1
st, 3rdand 4th21-day cycles and on Days 2 
through 5 or Days 2 through 12 (14-day schedule) of the 2nd21-day cycle, or on Days –2 
through 19 (continuous schedule) of the 21 day Cycles 1 – 4 at a dose level based on the dose escalation cohort assignment.  One dose will be taken in the morning and the second dose will be taken in the evening (approximately 12 hours after the morning dose).  The morning dose of veliparib should be administered in the clinic prior to etoposide and carboplatin, but after chemotherapy premedications on days when administered with chemotherapy.  Premedications may be administered per individual institutional standards.
After the end of Cycle 4, subjects without evidence of disease progression by [CONTACT_26268] (CT) will receive veliparib at [ADDRESS_25388] 2014-001764-35

5.5.7 Treatment Compliance
The investigator or his/her designated and qualified representatives will 
administer/dispense study drug only to subjects enrolled in the study in accordance with the protocol.  The study drug must not be used for reasons other than that described in the protocol.  Veliparib/placebo should be taken as directed by [CONTACT_093].  Carboplatin and etoposide will be administered intravenously by [CONTACT_1146].
Subjects will be instructed to return all veliparib/placebo bottles (empty, partially filled or 
full) and the completed dosing card to the study site personnel at each combination cycle Day 1, each Maintenance cycle Day 1, 30-Day Follow-Up Visit and/or at the Final Visit.  The Investigator or his/her designated and qualified representatives will document the bottles returned and the number of capsules returned per bottle in the IRT system.
Upon completion or termination of the study, all original bottles/cartons containing 
unused veliparib/placebo (empty containers will be defaced and discarded on site) will be returned to [COMPANY_013] or the destruction facility according to [COMPANY_013]'s instructions, or if pre-arranged between the sponsor and site, destruction of used and unused bottles will be performed at the site.
Subjects should be questioned regarding their adherence to the assigned treatment 
schedule at each study visit.  The Investigator or his/her designated and qualified representatives will also confirm that the subject took the required number of capsules per protocol. 
Unless otherwise directed by [CONTACT_093], a subject will be considered compliant with 
study drug, veliparib, if 80% of the assigned dose is taken during a cycle.  Compliance below 80% will require counseling of the subject by [CONTACT_26271].  The Investigator or his/her designated and qualified representatives will document compliance on the appropriate eCRF.
Veliparib
M14-[ADDRESS_25392] amounts.  This will be documented by [CONTACT_26272] (PoR) or similar document respectively via direct recording in the IRT.  The shipment receipt must be acknowledged in the IRT in order to become available for dispensation to subjects.  All veliparib/placebo must be retained in the designated secure area under proper storage conditions.  The study site will record the kit number of veliparib/placebo given to each subject in the source documents and on the eCRF.
The IRT will maintain a current and accurate inventory of study drug, accountability, 
reconciliation, returns, and destruction for each site.  The IRT will also include the lot number, the bottle/kit numbers, and the date veliparib/placebo was dispensed for eachsubject.
In the event the IRT is not operable, the above information will be documented on forms 
provided/approved by [CONTACT_1034].
The Investigator or designee will document the bottles of veliparib/placebo returned and 
the number of capsules on the appropriate form in the IRT.  If the number of capsules taken and the number of capsules returned do not add up to the number of capsules dispensed, an explanation is required and should be documented in the IRT.
An overall accountability of the study drug will be performed and verified by [CONTACT_26273]-out visit.  All study drug unit doses must be inventoried, accounted for, and returned to the destruction facility or to [COMPANY_013] or destroyed per instructions from [COMPANY_013] and according to local regulations.  
The investigator and/or named the sub-investigators agree not to supply study medication 
to any persons not enrolled in the study.

M14-[ADDRESS_25393] a potential benefit for subjects with ED SCLC.  This Phase 1 dose escalation/Phase 2 randomized double-blind study will determine the recommended Phase 2 dose of veliparib in combination with carboplatin and etoposide (Phase 1 portion), and will evaluate the treatment effect due to the addition of veliparib to carboplatin/etoposide chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_26274] (Phase 2 portion).
5.6.[ADDRESS_25394] 3 + [ADDRESS_25395] Population
Subjects with ED SCLC and advanced/metastatic solid tumors (Phase 1) and with 
treatment-naïve ED SCLC (Phase 2) and meeting inclusion and exclusion selection criteria as outlined in the Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.2.2 are appropriate for this study.  
Subjects with advanced/metastatic solid tumors will allow defining the recommended Phase 2 dose as the tolerability of the study regimen in this population should be similar to the target population with ED-SCLC.  Subjects with treatment-naïve ED SCLC are appropriate to define efficacy and safety of the study regimen since carboplatin/etoposide is the first line standard of care in this tumor type and SCLC is the intended indication for further clinical evaluation of veliparib/carboplatin/etoposide combination.

Study drug interruptions for events that are clearly not related to the study drug treatment, (e.g., underlying cancer, planned surgical procedures or acute viral illnesses), should not necessitate a dose reduction.  The timing of dose resumption should be at the discretion of the Investigator.  Study treatment may be delayed for up to 21 days due to toxicity.  Toxicity-related delays greater than 21 days will result in study treatment discontinuation.

b. Refer to Section 5.7.1 for veliparib dose reduction guidelines for maintenance therapy.  "Next lower DL" refers to 
the daily dose levels tested in the dose escalation part of the study.  The dose of each drug can be reduced 
independently based on the observed toxicities.  For veliparib dose level of 80 mg (Phase 1 only), Dose Reduction 1 is to 60 mg, Dose Reduction 2 is to 40 mg.
5.7.1 Veliparib/Placebo Dose Reductions and Interruptions
The following are guidelines for dose reduction, interruption and discontinuation of 
veliparib/placebo during combination therapy:
Veliparib
M14-[ADDRESS_25399] 2014-001764-35
100
1. Veliparib/placebo will be discontinued if both carboplatin and etoposide are 
discontinued prior to the completion of the planned number of combination therapy 
cycles.
2. For any subject who experiences Grade 3/4 toxicity which is not attributable to 
carboplatin/etoposide or the underlying disease, refer to Table 17 for dosing 
guidelines.
3. Two dose reductions are prospectively allowed during combination therapy for 
subjects who experience toxicity attributable to veliparib/placebo.  Refer to Table 16 for dose reduction guidelines.
a. Veliparib dose reduction at C1D1 is allowed in case of nausea and vomiting 
attributable to C1D-2 and C1D-1 veliparib doses
b. All veliparib/placebo dose reductions within combination therapy cycles are 
permanent.
c. If further dose reductions (beyond prospectively allowed two) are required, 
sites must contact [CONTACT_26275].
4. Any ≥ Grade 2 event of seizure attributed to veliparib/placebo requires 
discontinuation of veliparib/placebo.
5. Veliparib/placebo interruptions will not affect the schedule of planned study 
procedures and will not be replaced.  If veliparib/placebo-related toxicity necessitates the delay in veliparib/placebo re-initiation beyond the scheduled start of the next combination therapy cycle, the start of the cycle should be delayed until veliparib/placebo can be restarted.  The [COMPANY_013] TA MD may be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] (Section 6.6) for subjects who require more than a 2-week delay in the re-initiation 
of the next cycle.
The following are guidelines for dose reduction, interruption and discontinuation of veliparib/placebo during Maintenance Therapy:
1. Dose Reduction 1:  [ADDRESS_25400] 2014-001764-35
101
2. Dose Reduction 2:  200 mg BID.
3. Subjects requiring dose reduction of veliparib/placebo to below 200 mg BID will 
be discontinued from treatment.
4. For subjects who experience any Grade 3/4 toxicity during maintenance therapy 
which is attributable to veliparib, refer to Table 18 for dosing guidelines.

5.7.2 Carboplatin/Etoposide Dose Reductions and Delays
If a subject experiences an adverse event attributable to carboplatin or etoposide, 
carboplatin or etoposide may either be interrupted or the dose reduced.  
If a dose reduction or delay is required for carboplatin and/or etoposide, the Investigator 
should follow procedures as defined in the locally approved product label or applicable Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC).  Section [IP_ADDRESS] outlines suggested dose

reductions for carboplatin/etoposide if above information is not available.  PD and/or PK 
samples will not be drawn during carboplatin and/or etoposide dose delays.
[IP_ADDRESS] Guidelines for Carboplatin and Etoposide Dose Reductions 
and Delays
The below guidelines are suggested, unless described as mandatory.  If a dose reduction 
or delay is required for carboplatin and/or etoposide, the Investigator should follow procedures according to institutional guidelines, the locally approved product label, local practice, or applicable SmPC.  If the Investigator considers an event attributable to carboplatin and/or etoposide, the Investigator may consider reducing carboplatin and/or etoposide, but not veliparib/placebo.  Suggested guidelines for dose reduction, delay, and discontinuation are included in Table 16 and Table 19 (if locally approved product label, 
local standard of care guideline or applicable SmPC for carboplatin/etoposide combination chemotherapy are not available).
All carboplatin and/or etoposide dose reductions are permanent.  Re-escalation of the dose 
of therapy is not allowed.  All toxicities should have resolved to grade 1 or less prior to initiation of a new cycle of therapy, with the exception of anemia, alopecia, neuropathy, and non-treatment related clinically insignificant laboratory abnormalities.
If toxicity precludes the initiation of the dosing of carboplatin/etoposide in the cycle, and 
veliparib doses on Days –2 and –[ADDRESS_25402] already been administered, veliparib should be administered again once the toxicity resolves for 2 days prior to carboplatin/etoposide dosing.  In such a case, a new supply of veliparib/placebo is to be dispensed, and Day –2 and Day –1 are to be repeated for that cycle.
For Phase 1 ONLY:  PD and/or PK samples will not be drawn during carboplatin and/or 
etoposide dose delays.  If the Investigator considers an event attributable to carboplatin and/or etoposide and not veliparib, the Investigator may consider reducing the dose of both agents.

should be obtained weekly via central labs (if done locally, sample MUST be split for central lab) until the counts reach the lower limits for treatment as outlined.  The treatment schedule will then proceed in the usual sequence.
Neutropenia or Febrile Neutropenia
For febrile neutropenia with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 500/mm3and a single 
temperature of > 38.3°C (101°F) or a sustained temperature of ≥38°C (100.4°F) for more 
than one hour, requiring intravenous antibiotics:
a. Doses of both carboplatin and etoposide drugs should be reduced to the next lower 
dose level for all subsequent cycles of chemotherapy.  Suggested dose reduction 
levels are outlined in Table 14 .
b. Implement dose reductions, as outlined in Table 19 .
c. Initiate prophylactic neutrophil growth factors (e.g., G-CSF) after the first epi[INVESTIGATOR_26178], ASCO or NCCN guidelines.
d. If ANC counts do not recover within [ADDRESS_25405] be ≥  1,500/mm

Platelets
For Grade 4 nadir platelet count decrease (thrombocytopenia) (platelets < 25,000 mm3), 
the dose of both carboplatin and etoposide should be reduced to next lower dose level 
from the previous dose for all subsequent cycles of chemotherapy.  Implement dose reductions [ADDRESS_25407] be > 100,000/mm
3on Day 1 of each cycle (mandatory).  Doses or all 
drugs (carboplatin, etoposide and veliparib) should be delayed until platelet count 
recovers to > 100,000/mm3.
Anemia
No dose reductions will be made for anemia.  Subjects should be supported per the treating physician's discretion.  The use of RBC transfusions for anemia will be allowed as clinically indicated and as per local standard of care or current NCCN guidelines.  The use of growth factors for anemia is not permitted during Phase 1 Cycle 1.
If more than two dose modifications of carboplatin and etoposide are required for 
hematologic toxicity, e.g., in cases where an additional dose modification is needed for a toxicity which was not observed earlier, please consult the [COMPANY_013] TA MD.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Non-Hematological Toxicity
Gastrointestinal Toxicity: Nausea and Vomiting
All subjects should receive antiemetics* to prevent nausea and vomiting.  Specific 
antiemetic therapy is left to the discretion of the treating physician (steroids and 5-HT3 antagonists should be used).  For vomiting Grade ≥ 3, consider hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26179]/or 
use of aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], if possible.  Nausea/vomiting should have resolved to Grade 1 or less prior to initiation of next treatment cycle.  Do not modify carboplatin and/or etoposide doses due to nausea/vomiting.

* Aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], when given once daily for 14 days as a 100 mg capsule with an oral contraceptive containing 35 mcg of 
ethinyl estradiol and 1 mg of norethindrone, decreased the AUC of ethinyl estradiol by 43% and decreased the 
AUC of norethindrone by 8%.  Women of childbearing potential using pregnancy contraception that includes ethinyl estradiol should not receive Aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_26180]/delayed emesis.  Subjects may change to a different method of contraception if they wish to use Aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053].
Hepatic Toxicity
For bilirubin > 1.5 – 3.0 × ULN, not attributable to underlying disease, reduce the dose of 
etoposide to 50 mg/m2.  For bilirubin > 3 – 5 × ULN reduce the dose of etoposide to 
30 mg/m2.  For bilirubin > 5 × ULN hold etoposide or hold all treatment if starting the 
next treatment cycle.  When bilirubin resolves to ≤ 5 × ULN, treatment can be resumed, 
with etoposide dose to 30 mg/m2.  If bilirubin does not improve to ≤ 5 × ULN within 
[ADDRESS_25409] occurrence, discontinue protocol therapy.

All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
6.1 Definitions
6.1.1 Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  Any worsening of a pre-existing condition or illness is considered an adverse event.  Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse event.  Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse events only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, (meets protocol specific criteria [see Section 6.8 regarding toxicity 
management]) and/or if the investigator considers them to be adverse events.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre-existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been pre planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study (e.g., surgery is performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event.
Veliparib
M14-[ADDRESS_25415] 2014-001764-35
108
6.1.2 Deaths
For this protocol, mortality is an efficacy endpoint.  Deaths that occur during the protocol 
specified adverse event reporting period (Section 6.5) that are attributed by [CONTACT_26276]/Early Discontinuation eCRF.  All other on-study deaths, regardless of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor (Section 6.1.4).
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be reported.  The term "sudden death" should only be used for the occurrence of an abrupt and unexpected death due to presumed cardiac causes in a patient with or without preexistingheart disease, within [ADDRESS_25416] seen alive and stable.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, "unexplained death" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), "unexplained death" should be replaced by [CONTACT_25749].
During survival follow-up, deaths should be recorded on Survival eCRF.
6.1.[ADDRESS_25417] 2014-001764-35

6.1.4 Serious Adverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to [COMPANY_013] as a 
serious adverse event (SAE) within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event:
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would 
have resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention 
had not been taken.  This does not include an event that 
would have been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26182]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This does not include an emergency room visit or 
admission to an outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that 
results in fetal loss.
Persistent or Significant Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not intended to include experiences 
of relatively minor medical significance such as headache, 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).
Veliparib
M14-[ADDRESS_25418] 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent any of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life-threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomaly, or persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered 
an important medical event.  Examples of such events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.
6.[ADDRESS_25419] to expedited reporting.  These data will be captured as efficacy assessment data only.
6.3 Adverse Event Severity
The investigator will rate the severity of each adverse event according to the National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE Version 4.0).
[ADDRESS_25420] 2014-001764-35
111
For adverse events not captured by [CONTACT_26277] 4.0, the investigator will use 
the following definitions to rate the severity of each adverse event:
Mild 
(Grade 1)The adverse event is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].
Moderate 
(Grade 2)The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject's usual activities.
Severe 
(Grade 3/4)The adverse event causes considerable interference with the subject's usual activities and may be incapacitating or life-threatening.
Death (Grade 5)Death
If a reported adverse event increases in severity, the initial adverse event should be given 
an outcome date and a new adverse event should be reported to reflect the change in severity.
For all reported serious adverse events that increase in severity, the SAE supplemental 
eCRFs also need to be updated and need to include the new AE serial number.
6.4 Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of study drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is sufficient evidence (information to suggest a 
causal relationship.
No Reasonable PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, clinical judgment and potential alternative causes there is insufficient evidence (information to suggest a 
causal relationship.
Veliparib
M14-[ADDRESS_25421] 2014-001764-35
112
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being 
related to the study drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered "not associated."  In addition, when the investigator has not reported a causality or deemed it not assessable, [COMPANY_013] will consider the event associated.  For the purposes of this study, causality assessments will be attributed to veliparib/placebo or carboplatin or etoposide separately.
If an investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_26183], another cause of event must be provided by [CONTACT_26278].

6.6 Adverse Event Reporting
In the event of a serious adverse event, whether associated with study drug or not, the 
Investigator will notify  Clinical Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event by [CONTACT_26280] (EDC) system.  Serious adverse events that occur prior to the site having access to the RAVE
®system or if RAVE is not operable should be sent to 
Clinical Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of being made aware of the serious adverse event using the paper CRF (pCRF).
Serious adverse events which are considered expected due to the underlying disease of 
SCLC would not be expedited as individual safety case reports to regulatory authorities.

hazards model.
[IP_ADDRESS] ECOG Performance Status
Changes and/or percent changes from baseline in ECOG performance status will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics for each scheduled post-baseline visit and for the final visit.  Post-baseline measurements more than [ADDRESS_25442]-baseline measurements will not be included.  Changes and/or percent changes from baseline to each visit will be compared between Arm A and Arm C as well as between Arm B and Arm C using an analysis of covariance with treatment arm as the factor and baseline value as a covariate.
8.1.6 Pharmacokinetics
[IP_ADDRESS] Tabulations and Summary Statistics
Plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameter values of veliparib, carboplatin, 
and etoposide will be tabulated for each subject by [CONTACT_15994], and summary statistics will be computed for each sampling time and each parameter by [CONTACT_15994].
[IP_ADDRESS] Model and Tests
Dose Proportionality of Veliparib on Phase 1 Cycle 1 Day 1
To address the issue of dose proportionality for designated veliparib doses, a linear mixed 
effects model analysis will be performed for dose-normalized C maxand AUC 0-8and other 
pharmacokinetic parameters provided that they can be adequately determined from the data.  The natural logarithmic transformation will be employed for C
maxand the AUC's 
unless the data clearly indicate that other transformation or the untransformed variable provides more nearly symmetric probability distributions and/or more nearly homogenous variances across dose levels.  The model will include dose level, this may be done by [CONTACT_26289], if appropriate, using dose level as a continuous 
Veliparib
M14-[ADDRESS_25443] on Etoposide Pharmacokinetics Parameters
For the dose escalation subjects, a linear mixed effects model analysis will be performed 
for dose normalized C max, AUC 0-24and AUC ∞, to compare etoposide pharmacokinetics 
parameters when co-administered with veliparib (Cycle 1 Day 1) relative to etoposideadministered alone (Cycle 2 Day 1).  For C
maxand AUC, the logarithmic transformation 
will be used unless the data indicate that the logarithm has significant non-normality.  The model will include effects for visit (Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 2 Day 1).  The within-subject variability will be accounted for utilizing the repeated statement for the effect of visit.  Within the repeated measure analysis modeling framework, the null hypothesis of no difference between etoposide in combination with veliparib and etoposide alone will be tested with a significance level of 0.05.  The relative bioavailability of etoposide co-administered with veliparib relative to etoposide alone will be estimated.  Point estimates and corresponding 90% confidence intervals for the ratio of etoposide co-administered relative to etoposide alone will be provided.  The point estimates will be obtained by [CONTACT_26290].  The 90% confidence intervals will be similarly obtained by [CONTACT_26291].

125
[IP_ADDRESS] Missing Values and Model Violations
All available data will be included in the mixed effect analyses.  Data exclusion, if any, 
will be documented and justification provided.
Normally values of pharmacokinetic variables (C max, AUC, etc.) will be determined 
without replacing missing individual concentration values, simply using the available 
data, and if necessary doing the analysis with some missing values for a pharmacokinetic variable.  However, if a missing individual concentration results in a value of a pharmacokinetic parameter that may be too low or too high to a meaningful degree, the value of the pharmacokinetic parameter will tentatively be considered missing.  In this case, a value for the missing individual concentration may be imputed so that an appropriate value of the pharmacokinetic parameter can be included in the analysis.  The imputed value will be obtained using appropriate methodology that   takes into account the individual characteristics of the subject.
If an outlier is identified and/or a pronounced non-normal probability distribution is 
observed (after logarithmic transformation for C
maxand AUC), then a non-parametric 
analysis may also be performed.  Such a model violation may be identified by [CONTACT_26292], measures of non-normality (e.g., skewness, kurtosis) or other appropriate methods.  If the regimens have unequal variances to the extent that conclusions might be affected, then approximate methods that allow for unequal variances will be used.
8.1.7 Safety
Safety analyses will be performed for Phase 1 and Phase 2 separately.[IP_ADDRESS] Duration of Study Drug
A summary of the number of days and/or cycles subjects were exposed to study drug will 
be provided.

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events
Analyses of adverse events will include only "treatment-emergent" events, i.e., those that 
have an onset on or after the day of the first dose of study drug (veliparib or placebo).  Analyses will not include those that have an onset greater than [ADDRESS_25446] dose of study drug.
Treatment-emergent adverse events will be coded and summarized by [CONTACT_26293] (MedDRA) adverse event coding dictionary.  The percentage of subjects experiencing an adverse event at a given NCI CTCAE version 4.0 grade, and relationship to study drug will be provided.  For Phase 1, all summaries will be done by [CONTACT_15994].  For Phase 2, comparisons of the percentages of subjects experiencing an adverse event between Arm A and Arm C as well as between Arm B and Arm C will be performed using Fisher's exact test.
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events
Serious adverse events will be summarized using the same methods as adverse events 
described above in Section [IP_ADDRESS].
[IP_ADDRESS] Deaths
The number of subject deaths will be summarized 1) for deaths occurring while the 
subject was still receiving study drug in this study, 2) for deaths occurring off treatment within [ADDRESS_25447] dose of study drug, and 3) for all deaths in this study regardless of the number of days after the last dose of study drug.
[IP_ADDRESS] Longitudinal Analyses of Laboratory and Vital Signs Data
Changes from baseline will be analyzed for each scheduled post-baseline visit and for the 
final visit for blood chemistry and hematology parameters, as well as urinalysis and vital sign parameters.  If more than one measurement exists for a subject on a particular day, an arithmetic average will be calculated.  This average will be considered to be that subject's 
Veliparib
M14-[ADDRESS_25448]-baseline measurements will not be included.  For Phase 1, changes from baseline will be analyzed by [CONTACT_26294].  For Phase 2, comparisons of the differences in mean changes from baseline between Arm A and Arm C as well as between Arm B and Arm C will be made using ANCOVA with treatment group as the factor and baseline as a covariate.
[IP_ADDRESS] Analyses of Laboratory Data Using NCI CTCAE
Where applicable, blood chemistry and hematology determinations will be categorized 
according to NCI CTCAE version 4.[ADDRESS_25449]-baseline grades of 3 to 4 between Arm A and Arm C as well as between Arm B and Arm C will be performed using Fisher's exact tests.  Additional analyses including all measurements collected, regardless of the number of days after the last dose of study drug, will be performed.

[IP_ADDRESS] Analyses of Vital Signs Using Criteria for Potentially 
Clinically Significant Vital Sign Values
Detailed listings of data for subjects experiencing potentially clinically significant vital 
sign values according to the [COMPANY_013]-defined criteria for vital sign values will be provided.  All measurements collected, regardless of the number of days after the last dose of study drug, will be included in these listings.
8.1.8 Timing of Efficacy Analyses and Safety Evaluations
When the 126
thPFS event is observed, all efficacy and safety data as of this time will be 
retrieved and entered into the clinical database prior to breaking the study blind.  When 
the data collection is completed and reviewed for completeness and all data management quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) procedures are performed, the study blind will be broken and clinical database data will be extracted for documentation and statistical analyses of the efficacy and safety data.
Overall survival will be collected on all subjects.  After all survival data have been 
collected and entered into the clinical database, the clinical database will be extracted again for documentation and a "Final OS Analysis" will be performed on this dataset.
8.1.9 Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)
A safety DMC will be set up for the Phase [ADDRESS_25451] 30 Phase 2 subjects complete combination treatment.  Based on this initial safety DMC review, the frequency of subsequent safety DMC reviews will be determined.  However, the initial safety DMC review may occur sooner:  if the observed rate of DLT-like events in the aggregate blinded safety review of the first 15 Phase 2 subjects exceeds the rate observed in the MTD/RPTD cohort by [CONTACT_726] 10%, the safety DMC will convene immediately to review the aggregate unblinded safety data.  The details of the safety DMC setup and procedure will be outlined in a separate document.
The DMC will not evaluate efficacy data.

8.2 Determination of Sample Size
Phase 1 Dose Escalation
The number of subjects required for dose escalation portion will depend upon the 
toxicities observed as the trial progresses.
Phase 2 Randomized Double-Blind
Assuming a median PFS of 5.5 months for placebo in combination with carboplatin and 
etoposide followed by [CONTACT_26201] (Arm C) and a hazard ratio of 0.63 for veliparib in combination with carboplatin and etoposide followed by [CONTACT_26209] (Arm A) versus Arm C, a total of [ADDRESS_25453] 80% power to detect a statistically significant difference between Arm A and Arm C at a one-sided α  = 0.1.  Further assuming a hazard ratio of 0.75 for veliparib in combination 
with carboplatin and etoposide followed by [CONTACT_26201] (Arm B) versus Arm C, a total of 126 PFS events will be observed across all three arms at the time when 85 PFS events are observed for Arm A and Arm C combined.  A total of approximately 180 subjects (60 subjects per treatment arm) will be enrolled into the study to obtain the [ADDRESS_25454] the IRT to obtain a Screening (subject) number once the subject has signed the informed consent and a study-specific procedure has been performed (i.e., central laboratory samples drawn).  Once the Screening number is assigned, if the subject is not randomized into the study, the reason for screen failure will be documented in the source document and in the eCRF.  For others, the site will access the system and a unique randomization number will be provided.
The IRT will randomize subjects in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the treatment arms as follows:
Veliparib
M14-[ADDRESS_25455] 2014-001764-35

[CONTACT_26201]
●Arm C:  placebo in combination with carboplatin/etoposide followed by [CONTACT_26295] ( ≤ ULN versus > ULN) and 
gender.  The stratification factors used for the randomization should be the last values on 
or prior to the date of randomization and should be consistent with those on the eCRF.
A bottle number randomization schedule and a subject randomization schedule will be 
generated by [CONTACT_26296].  A copy of all randomization schedules will be kept by [CONTACT_26297] a copy will be forwarded to the IRT vendor.

M14-[ADDRESS_25471] (Version 1.1) for Tumor Response (PFS)
Response criteria will be assessed using RECIST (version 1.1).[ADDRESS_25472] (version 1.1).  Measurable disease is defined by [CONTACT_12155].  If the measurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by [CONTACT_3973]/histology if possible.
Measurability
Measurable 
LesionsLesions accurately measured in at least one dimension with a minimum size of:
●Longest diameter ≥  10 mm (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm)
●10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_26304]-Measurable 
LesionsAll other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm) as well as 
truly non-measurable lesions.  Lesions considered truly non-measurable include:  leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung and also abdominal masses that 
are not confirmed and followed by [CONTACT_15218].
Measurable 
Malignant 
Lymph NodesTo be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be 
≥[ADDRESS_25473] scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only the 
short axis will be measured and followed.
Non-Measurable 
Malignant 
Lymph NodesPathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < [ADDRESS_25474] 2014-001764-35
144
Special 
Considerations 
Regarding Lesion 
MeasurabilityBone lesions
Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
components, that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_26305]/CT can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets 
the definition of measurability described above.
Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable.
Cystic lesions
Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not 
be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since 
they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.
'Cystic lesions' thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above.
However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred 
for selection as target lesions.
Lesions with prior local treatmentTumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to 
other loco-regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has 
been demonstrated progression in the lesion.
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation, using calipers if 
clinically assessed.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and not more than 21 days before the beginning of the treatment.
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up.
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin 
nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥ [ADDRESS_25475] or MRI should be made based upon discussion with the [COMPANY_013] TA MD.
For accurate objective response evaluation, ultrasound (US) should not be used to 
measure tumor lesions.
The utilization of endoscopy and laparoscopy for objective tumor evaluation is not 
advised.  However, such techniques can be useful in confirming complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained.
Cytology and histology can be used to differentiate between partial response (PR) and 
complete response (CR) in rare cases.
Baseline Documentation of "Target" and "Non-Target" Lesions
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other 
Veliparib
M14-[ADDRESS_25476] meet the criterion of a short axis of ≥ [ADDRESS_25477] in which the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane).  The smaller of these measures is the short axis.  For example, an abdominal node which is reported as being 20 mm × 30 mm has a short axis of 20 mm and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node.  In this example, 20 mm should be recorded as the node measurement.  All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥10 mm but < 15 mm) should be considered non-target lesions.  Nodes that have a short 
axis < [ADDRESS_25478] diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as 
the baseline sum LD.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum LD will be used as reference by [CONTACT_14218].
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be 
identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence (stable, increasing or decreasing) or absence of each should be noted throughout follow-up.
Evaluation of Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR):
The disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or 
non-target) must have reduction in short axis to < [ADDRESS_25479] 2014-001764-35
147
Partial Response (PR):
At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
baseline sum diameters.
Progressive Disease (PD):
At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the 
smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started (baseline or after) or the appearance of one or more new lesions.  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.
Stable Disease (SD):
Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, 
taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started (baseline or after).
Assessment of Target Lesions:
Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual short axis 
measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examination), even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study.  This means that when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the 'sum' of lesions may not be zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of < 10 mm.  For PR, SD and PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included in the sum of target lesions.
All lesions (nodal and non-nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual 
measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (< 5 mm).  However, sometimes target lesions or lymph nodes become too small to measure.  If it is in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26191], the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm.  If the lesion is believed to be present, but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned (as derived from the [ADDRESS_25480] slice thickness).  The measurement of these lesions is potentially non-reproducible; therefore 
Veliparib
M14-[ADDRESS_25481] 2014-001764-35
148
providing this default value will prevent false responses or progression based upon 
measurement error.
Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR):
The disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level.  All 
lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis).
Non-CR/Non-PD:
Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level 
above the normal limits.
Progressive Disease (PD):
Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.
In this setting, to achieve 'unequivocal progression' on the basis of non-target disease, 
there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in the presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest 'increase' in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status.  The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.
New Lesions
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression.  While there are no 
specific criteria for the identification of new radiographic lesions, the findings of a new lesion should be unequivocal; i.e., not attributable to differences in scanning technique, timing of scanning, phase of contrast administration, change in imaging modality or finding thought to represent something other than tumor (e.g., some 'new' bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre-existing lesions).  A lesion identified on a follow-up 
Veliparib
M14-[ADDRESS_25482] or MRI brain ordered which reveals metastases.  The patient's brain metastases are considered evidence of progressive disease even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.
If a new lesion is equivocal (e.g., too small to measure), continued therapy and follow-up 
evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease.  If repeat scans confirm there is a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.

Appendix E. Calculation of Carboplatin Dose
The Cockcroft-Gault formula will be used.
The carboplatin dose will be calculated to reach a target AUC according to the Calvert 
formula using an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from the Cockcroft-Gault formula.
The initial dose of carboplatin must be calculated using GFR.  In the absence of renal 
toxicity greater than or equal to CTCAE Grade 2 (serum creatinine > 1.5 × ULN) or toxicity requiring dose modification, the dose of carboplatin will not need to be recalculated for subsequent cycles, but will be subject to dose modification for toxicity as noted in the protocol.
Carboplatin doses will be based on the subject's weight at baseline and will remain the 
same throughout the study.  However, the doses may be recalculated based on the subject's weight at each cycle, and need to be recalculated if the subject has a weight change of greater than or equal to 10% from baseline.
In subjects with an abnormally low serum creatinine (less than 0.7 mg/dL), the creatinine 
clearance should be estimated using a minimum value of 0.7 mg/dL.
CALVERT FORMULA:Carboplatin dose (mg) = target AUC × (GFR + 25)NOTE:  the GFR used in the Calvert formula should not exceed 125 mL/min.Maximum carboplatin dose (mg) = target AUC (mg/ml × min) × 150 mL/min.The maximum allowed doses of carboplatin are:
●AUC
5= 750 mg
●AUC 4= [ADDRESS_25485] 2014-001764-35
152
For the purposes of this protocol, the GFR is considered to be equivalent to the estimated 
creatinine clearance.  The estimated creatinine clearance (mL/min) is calculated by [CONTACT_26306]-Gault using the following formula:
Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) = [140-Age (years)] × Weight (kg) × 
72 × serum creatinine (mg/dL)
For female subjects:  multiply the result above by 0.85.Notes:
a. Body mass index (BMI) should be calculated for each subject.  A BMI should be 
calculated using the following formula:
BMI = (Weight in kg) / (Height in meters)
2
b. Actual weight should be used for estimation of GFR for subjects with BMI < 25.
c. Adjusted weight should be used for estimation of GFR for subjects with BMI ≥ 25.
d. Adjusted weight calculation:
i. Ideal weight (kg) = (((Height (cm)/2.54) – 60) × 2.3) + 45.5
ii. Adjusted weight (kg) = ((Actual weight – Ideal weight) × 0.40) + 
Ideal weight
e. If a patient with BMI of ≥ [ADDRESS_25486] 
dose with next planned treatment.
At the time of a dose modification for toxicity:
●If the creatinine at the time of a dose modification is lower than the creatinine
used to calculate the previous dose, use the previous (higher) creatinine;
●If the creatinine at the time of a dose modification is higher than the creatinine 
used to calculate the previous dose, use the current (higher) creatinine.  This 
will ensure that the patient is actually receiving a dose reduction.

than or equal to 10% from baseline.

Methodology:
This is a Phase 1 dose escalation and Phase 2 randomized double-blind study.
Screening Procedures:Screening procedures should be performed within 28 days of Cycle 1 Day –2.  If the screening visit is 
performed greater than 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day –2, the physical exam, laboratory tests, and pregnancy test (for female subjects of childbearing potential) must be repeated on Cycle 1 Day –2.  Vital signs and performance status assessments will be performed on Cycle 1 Day –2 for all subjects.  Baseline radiographic tumor assessments per computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest, abdomen, and head will be conducted within 21 days prior to Cycle 1 Day –2.  If 
CNS metastases are suspected, a head CT should also be performed at screening.
Phase 1 Dose Escalation:
For subjects in the dose escalation portion of the study, each subject will participate in only [ADDRESS_25493] dose-escalation.  Study procedures will be provided in the 
Schedule of Assessments and Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic tables.
The Phase 1 portion of this study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), 
RPTD, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD), of veliparib/carboplatin/etoposide 
combination in subjects diagnosed with Extensive Stage Disease Small Cell Lung Cancer or, other advanced/metastatic solid tumor for which carboplatin/etoposide treatment is considered appropriate.  Veliparib will be administered on Days –2 to 5 (7-d ay schedule), and, if the MTD of the 7-day schedule 
is not reached at ≤  200 mg BID veliparib dose level, may be administered on Days –2 to 12 (14-day

An exception would be for the Phase 1 Cycle 2:  In the 7-day schedule, veliparib in Cycle 2 will be administered on Days 2 to 5 and for the 14-day schedule, Days 2 to 12 (veliparib dose on Cycle 2 Days –2 and –1 and Cycle 2 Day 1 will be omitted to allow for 
the evaluation of drug-drug interaction of veliparib with etoposide).
Upon completion of 4 cycles of combination therapy, subjects without evidence of disease progression 
will continue on veliparib 400 mg BID until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  Subjects who will be receiving prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) will have maintenance veliparib interrupted for 
the duration of radiotherapy.
All subjects will be monitored for DLTs during the DLT observation period (Cycle 1 Day –2 to pre-dose 
Cycle 2 Day 1), and treatment-related adverse events (AEs) will be evaluated throughout the course of 
the study for evidence of acute, delayed, or cumulative toxicities.
The dose levels of veliparib to be evaluated in the dose-escalation portion of this study were determined 
based on the outcome of prior clinical studies of veliparib as well as on pre-clinical toxicology, toxicokinetic, and nonclinical anti-tumor efficacy studies.  The following dose levels may be evaluated in the dose-escalation portion of the study:  80, 120, 160, 200, and [ADDRESS_25494] safety including, but not limited to, Grade 2 study-drug related AEs.  If the MTD is not reached at veliparib 200 mg BID dose level, higher dose levels (with no more than 25% veliparib dose increments, and not exceeding single agent veliparib RPTD of 400 mg BID) may be evaluated at the discretion of the sponsor.  The alternative dosing schedules can include dosing 
veliparib Day –2 to 12 (14-day schedule) and/or Day –2 to 19 (continuous schedule) of [ADDRESS_25495] 2014-001764-35
159
Methodology (Continued):
Phase 1 Dose Escalation (Continued):
The initial dose for these schedules will be 200 mg BID or the maximum administered dose (MAD), not 
exceeding the MTD, in the 7-day schedule.  The 14-day schedule will be explored prior to continuous dosing schedule.  Reduced or interim dose levels may be evaluated based on review of the safety and 
PK.
A "3 + 3" escalation rule will be used for the dose-escalation portion of this study, with a condition 
applied for the Dose Level 1, which will allow 3 additional subjects to be entered in Dose Level 1 if 2 of 6 initial subjects experience DLTs.  Enrollment of the 3 additional subjects at all dose levels will depend 
on a review of the specific DLTs observed and discussion with the Investigators.
Dose-Escalation Criteria:
AEs, clinical laboratory results, and vital signs will be assessed throughout the study in each 
dose-escalation cohort.
DLTs will be assessed in each dose-escalation cohort during the DLT observation period
(Cycle 1 Day –2 to pre-dose on Cycle 2 Day 1).  Based on the safety and tolerability of study drugs after the first cycle of treatment has been completed in at least 3 subjects, escalation to a subsequent dose 
level or expansion of the current dose level will occur based upon the following criteria:

Dose-Escalation Criteria (Continued):
Number of Subjects with 
DLT in the First Cycle Escalation Decision Rule
0 out of 3 Enter 3 subjects at the next dose level.
1 out of 3 Add 3 more subjects at current dose level.  If [COMPANY_013] or the investigator 
considers the DLT(s) clinically significant, [COMPANY_013] will determine if it is appropriate to add more patients at this dose level.
!If < 2 of 6 subjects (or < 33% of subjects) experience DLT, dose 
escalation will proceed to the next dose level.
!If ≥ 2 of total 6 subjects (or ≥  33% of subjects) experience DLTs, 
then dose escalation will be stopped.*
≥ 2 out of 3 or 6 Dose escalation will be stopped.  *Additional subjects will be enrolled 
at the previous lower dose level as needed.  The following exceptions apply to Dose Level 1:
!If 2 of 6 initial subjects at Dose Level 1 experience DLTs, 
3 additional subjects may be entered and the cohort will be 
expanded up to 9 subjects for further DLT assessment.  
oEnrollment of the 3 additional subjects will depend on a review 
of the specific DLTs observed and discussion with the 
Investigators.  
!If 2 of 9 subjects at Dose Level 1 experience DLTs, then escalation to the next dose level may proceed.
!If > 2 of 9 subjects in Dose Level 1 experience drug-related DLTs, dose-escalation will stop.
* If 2 out of 6 subjects experience different DLTs, for example nausea and neutropenia, the data will be reviewed 
by [CONTACT_26207] 3 additional subjects should be added at that dose level.  If 
3 subjects will be added and none experience DLTs, this dose level will be declared the MTD.
An MTD and/or maximum administered dose (MAD), and RPTD, will be determined.  The MTD is 
defined as the maximum dose at which < 2 of 6 or ≤ [ADDRESS_25497] 2014-001764-35
161
Methodology (Continued):
DLT Definition:
DLT is defined as any of the following drug-related toxicities occurring during the DLT observation 
period in any of the dose-escalation cohorts, with grading according to the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0:
1. Cycle 1 events associated with treatment delay > 14 days in initiating Cycle 2:
a. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets < 25.0 × 109/L)
b. Grade 4 neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 0.5 × 109/L)
c. Grade 3 febrile neutropenia with fever lasting for > 7 days
d. Grade 4 febrile neutropenia of any duration
NOTE:  Delay of more than 14 days in initiating Cycle 2 due to factors not directly related to 
treatment-emergent toxicity will not be considered a DLT.
2. Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_25498] 2 grade increase from baseline and is 
attributed to veliparib treatment:
a. Exclusion:  nausea and vomiting lasting ≤ 48 hours or inadequately treated
b. Exclusion:  electrolyte abnormalities resolving within ≤ 24 hours
c. Exclusion:  hypersensitivity reactionsd. Exclusion:  alopecia
3. Grade [ADDRESS_25499] 2 grade increase from baseline, is 
attributed to veliparib treatment and requires a treatment delay of > [ADDRESS_25500] one of:a. Dose modification within Cycle 1b. Omission of carboplatin, > 1 daily etoposide dose, or > 30% veliparib doses in Cycle 1
Subjects experiencing DLT(s) during DLT observation period (Cycle 1 Day –2 to pre-dose Cycle 2 
Day 1) will require an interruption and possible discontinuation from further participation in the study.  Veliparib may be reintroduced at a reduced dose, if the toxicity returns to ≤ Grade 1 or to baseline if 
Grade 2 at study entry.  All decisions regarding continued dosing for individual subjects who experience 
a DLT will be medically managed by [CONTACT_26308].
Pharmacokinetics:
Pharmacokinetics of veliparib and etoposide will be assessed to determine the drug-drug interactions.  
Further pharmacokinetics of carboplatin will be assessed on Day 1 of Cycle 1.
Phase 2
In the Phase 2 double-blinded portion of the study subjects with treatment-naïve ED SCLC will be 
randomized to one of three treatment arms in 1:1:1 ratio: 
●Arm A:  veliparib in combination with carboplatin/etoposide followed by [CONTACT_26209]
●Arm B:  veliparib in combination with carboplatin/etoposide followed by [CONTACT_26201]
●Arm C:  placebo in combination with carboplatin/etoposide followed by [CONTACT_26210]

Methodology (Continued):
Dose-Escalation Criteria (Continued):
Phase 2 (Continued):Subjects in all Phase 2 study arms will receive a minimum of 4 cycles of combination therapy unless 
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity warrants earlier discontinuation from the treatment.  Additional 2 cycles of combination therapy (e.g., up to a total of 6 cycles) may be administered at the investigators discretion if subject status at the completion of initial [ADDRESS_25502] 4 chemotherapy combination cycles subjects without evidence of disease progression will receive veliparib at 400 mg BID continuous dosing (Arms A), or matching  placebo (Arms B and C), 
until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.
Subjects who will be receiving prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) will have maintenance veliparib 
interrupted for the duration of radiotherapy.
Subject randomization for Phase 2 will be stratified by [CONTACT_26212] (> ULN versus ≤ ULN), and 
gender.
Pharmacodynamics (Dose Escalation and Phase 2):Research to find biomarkers that may serve as surrogates for clinical endpoints in future veliparib studies 
or that may be predictive of veliparib activity will be conducted.  Serum, plasma, blood and tissue 
samples will be collected at designated time points throughout the study.
Tumor Assessments and Safety Follow-Up
Tumor assessments will be performed until disease progression.  Tumor assessment and assessment of 
response will occur every 6 weeks (± 1 week) for the first [ADDRESS_25503] dose of study drugs, then every 9 weeks (± 1 week) thereafter.  Tumor response will be determined according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Version 1.1.  Subjects will continue on study until they meet defined discontinuation criteria.  When the investigator has determined that a subject should discontinue the study, a Final Visit will be conducted.  Subjects will have a 30-Day Safety Follow-Up Visit following the last dose of study drugs or placebo (dependent on cohort).  If the subject begins another treatment regimen directly following protocol treatment and if a 30-Day Follow-Up Visit is not 
possible, all adverse events ongoing as of the end of study must be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.

Study Sites:   
Approximately 65 globally
Study Population:   
Phase 1:  Histologically or cytologically confirmed extensive stage disease SCLC or any other 
advanced/metastatic solid tumor for which carboplatin/etoposide treatment is considered appropriate.
Phase 2:  Histologically or cytologically confirmed treatment-naïve extensive stage disease SCLC.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   
Phase 1 Dose Escalation portion:  Approximately:  35Phase 2 Randomized Double-Blind portion:  Approximately:  180
Methodology:This is a Phase 1 dose escalation and Phase 2 randomized double-blind study.
Screening Procedures:
Screening procedures should be performed within 28 days of Cycle 1 Day –2.  If the screening visit is 
performed greater than 7 days prior to Cycle 1 Day –2, the physical exam, laboratory tests, and pregnancy test (for female subjects of childbearing potential) must be repeated on Cycle 1 Day –2.  Vital signs and performance status assessments will be performed on Cycle 1 Day –2 for all subjects.  Baseline radiographic tumor assessments per computed tomography (CT) with IV contrast/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis will be conducted within 21 days prior to Cycle 1 Day –2.  If CNS metastases are suspected, a head CT must also be performed at screening.  If the subject is unable to undergo a CT scan with IV contrast due to allergy or renal insufficiency, a non-contrast CT may be performed.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be conducted in cases where 
local laws/requirements mandate, but should have Sponsor approval prior to performing the MRI.
Phase 1 Dose Escalation:
For subjects in the dose escalation portion of the study, each subject will participate in only [ADDRESS_25520] 2014-001764-35

Methodology (Continued):
Phase 1 Dose Escalation (Continued):
The Phase 1 portion of this study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), 
RPTD, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD), of veliparib/carboplatin/etoposide combination in subjects diagnosed with Extensive Stage Disease Small Cell Lung Cancer or, other advanced/metastatic solid tumor for which carboplatin/etoposide treatment is considered appropriate.  Veliparib will be administered on Days –2 to 5 (7-d ay schedule), and, if the MTD of the 7-day schedule 
is not reached at ≤  200 mg BID veliparib dose level, may be administered on Days –2 to 12 (14-day 
schedule) and/or Days –2 to 19 (continuous schedule) orally BID, in combination with carboplatin area under the curve 5 mg/mL*min administered on Day 1 and etoposide 100 mg/m
2administered on Days 1 
to 3 via intravenous (IV) infusion in 21-day cycles.  An exception would be for the Phase 1 Cycle 2:  In the 7-day schedule, veliparib in Cycle 2 will be administered on Days 2 to 5 and for the 14-day schedule, Days 2 to 12 (veliparib dose on Cycle 2 Days –2 and –1 and Cycle 2 Day 1 will be omitted to allow for 
the evaluation of drug-drug interaction of veliparib with etoposide).
Upon completion of 4 cycles of combination therapy, subjects without evidence of disease progression 
will continue on veliparib 400 mg BID until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  Subjects who will be receiving prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) will have maintenance veliparib interrupted for 
the duration of radiotherapy.
All subjects will be monitored for DLTs during the DLT observation period (Cycle 1 Day –2 to pre-dose 
Cycle 2 Day 1), and treatment-related adverse events (AEs) will be evaluated throughout the course of 
the study for evidence of acute, delayed, or cumulative toxicities.
The dose levels of veliparib to be evaluated in the dose-escalation portion of this study were determined 
based on the outcome of prior clinical studies of veliparib as well as on pre-clinical toxicology, toxicokinetic, and nonclinical anti-tumor efficacy studies.  The following dose levels may be evaluated in the dose-escalation portion of the study:  80, 120, 160, 200, and [ADDRESS_25521] safety including, but not limited to, Grade 2 study-drug related AEs.  If the MTD is not reached at veliparib 200 mg BID dose level, higher dose levels (with no more than 25% veliparib dose increments, and not exceeding single agent veliparib RPTD of 400 mg BID) may be evaluated at the discretion of the sponsor.  The alternative dosing schedules can include dosing veliparib Day –2 to 12 (14-day schedule) and/or Day –2 to 19 (continuous schedule) of 21 day Cycle.  The initial dose for these schedules will be 200 mg BID or the maximum administered dose (MAD), not exceeding the MTD, in the 7-day schedule.  The 14-day schedule will be explored prior to continuous dosing schedule.  Reduced or interim dose levels may be evaluated based on review of the safety and 
PK.
A "3 + 3" escalation rule will be used for the dose-escalation portion of this study, with a condition 
applied for the Dose Level 1, which will allow 3 additional subjects to be entered in Dose Level 1 if 2 of 6 initial subjects experience DLTs.  Enrollment of the 3 additional subjects at all dose levels will depend 
on a review of the specific DLTs observed and discussion with the Investigators.
Dose-Escalation Criteria:
AEs, clinical laboratory results, and vital signs will be assessed throughout the study in each 
dose-escalation cohort.

Methodology (Continued):
Dose-Escalation Criteria (Continued):
DLTs will be assessed in each dose-escalation cohort during the DLT observation period
(Cycle 1 Day –2 to pre-dose on Cycle 2 Day 1).  Based on the safety and tolerability of study drugs after the first cycle of treatment has been completed in at least 3 subjects, escalation to a subsequent dose 
level or expansion of the current dose level will occur based upon the following criteria:
Number of Subjects with 
DLT in the First Cycle Escalation Decision Rule
0 out of 3 Enter 3 subjects at the next dose level.
1 out of 3 Add 3 more subjects at current dose level.  If [COMPANY_013] or the investigator 
considers the DLT(s) clinically significant, [COMPANY_013] will determine if it 
is appropriate to add more patients at this dose level.
!If < 2 of 6 subjects (or < 33% of subjects) experience DLT, dose 
escalation will proceed to the next dose level.
!If ≥ 2 of total 6 subjects (or ≥ 33% of subjects) experience DLTs, 
then dose escalation will be stopped.*
≥ 2 out of 3 or 6 Dose escalation will be stopped.  *Additional subjects will be enrolled 
at the previous lower dose level as needed.  The following exceptions apply to Dose Level 1:
!If 2 of 6 initial subjects at Dose Level 1 experience DLTs, 
3 additional subjects may be entered and the cohort will be 
expanded up to 9 subjects for further DLT assessment.  
oEnrollment of the 3 additional subjects will depend on a review 
of the specific DLTs observed and discussion with the 
Investigators.  
!If 2 of 9 subjects at Dose Level 1 experience DLTs, then escalation to the next dose level may proceed.
!If > 2 of 9 subjects in Dose Level 1 experience drug-related DLTs, dose-escalation will stop.
* If 2 out of 6 subjects experience different DLTs, for example nausea and neutropenia, the data will be reviewed 
by [CONTACT_26207] 3 additional subjects should be added at that dose level.  If 
3 subjects will be added and none experience DLTs, this dose level will be declared the MTD.
An MTD and/or maximum administered dose (MAD), and RPTD, will be determined.  The MTD is 
defined as the maximum dose at which < 2 of 6 or ≤ [ADDRESS_25523] 2014-001764-35
172
Methodology (Continued):
DLT Definition:
DLT is defined as any of the following drug-related toxicities occurring during the DLT observation 
period in any of the dose-escalation cohorts, with grading according to the National Cancer Institute 
(NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0:
1. Cycle 1 events associated with treatment delay > 14 days in initiating Cycle 2:
a. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets < 25.0 × 109/L)
b. Grade 4 neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 0.5 × 109/L)
c. Grade 3 febrile neutropenia with fever lasting for > 7 days
d. Grade 4 febrile neutropenia of any duration
NOTE:  Delay of more than 14 days in initiating Cycle 2 due to factors not directly related to 
treatment-emergent toxicity will not be considered a DLT.
2. Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_25524] 2 grade increase from baseline and is 
attributed to veliparib treatment:
a. Exclusion:  nausea and vomiting lasting ≤ 48 hours or inadequately treated
b. Exclusion:  electrolyte abnormalities resolving within ≤ 24 hours
c. Exclusion:  hypersensitivity reactionsd. Exclusion:  alopecia
3. Grade [ADDRESS_25525] 2 grade increase from baseline, is 
attributed to veliparib treatment and requires a treatment delay of > [ADDRESS_25526] one of:a. Dose modification within Cycle 1b. Omission of carboplatin, > 1 daily etoposide dose, or > 30% veliparib doses in Cycle 1
Subjects experiencing DLT(s) during DLT observation period (Cycle 1 Day –2 to pre-dose Cycle 2 
Day 1) will require an interruption and possible discontinuation from further participation in the study.  Veliparib may be reintroduced at a reduced dose, if the toxicity returns to ≤ Grade 1 or to baseline if 
Grade 2 at study entry.  All decisions regarding continued dosing for individual subjects who experience 
a DLT will be medically managed by [CONTACT_26208].
Pharmacokinetics:
Pharmacokinetics of veliparib and etoposide will be assessed to determine the drug-drug interactions.  
Further pharmacokinetics of carboplatin will be assessed on Day 1 of Cycle 1.
Phase 2 Randomized Double-Blind
The veliparib dose and schedule for the Phase 2 was determined to be 240 mg BID on a 14 day schedule 
based on the analysis of Phase 1 data.
Approximately 180 total subjects with treatment-naïve ED SCLC will be enrolled at the 240 mg BID 
veliparib/placebo dose and 14 day schedule in the Phase 2 double-blinded portion of the study.  They 
will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three treatment arms: 
●Arm A:  veliparib in combination with carboplatin/etoposide followed by [CONTACT_26209]
●Arm B:  veliparib in combination with carboplatin/etoposide followed by [CONTACT_26210]
M14-[ADDRESS_25527] 2014-001764-35
173
Methodology (Continued):
Phase 2 Randomized Double-Blind (Continued)
!Arm C:  placebo in combination with carboplatin/etoposide followed by [CONTACT_26211] 2 study arms will receive a minimum of 4 cycles of combination therapy unless 
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity warrants earlier discontinuation from the treatment.  Additional 2 cycles of combination therapy (e.g., up to a total of 6 cycles) may be administered at the investigators discretion if subject status at the completion of initial 4 cycles warrants continued combination treatment and/or if local SOC guidelines require 6 cycles of platinum-based therapy.  In the combination cycles of Arms A and B, subjects will receive veliparib at 240 mg BID on a 14-day schedule, Arm C will receive matching placebo.  After completion of the chemotherapy combination cycles (at least 4), subjects without evidence of disease progression will receive veliparib at 400 mg BID continuous dosing (21-day cycles) (Arms A), or matching placebo (Arms B and C) as per treatment arm 
assignment, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.  
Subjects who will be receiving prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) will have maintenance veliparib 
interrupted for the duration of radiotherapy.
Subject randomization for Phase 2 will be stratified by [CONTACT_26212] (> ULN versus ≤ ULN), and 
gender.
Pharmacodynamics (Phase 1 Dose Escalation and Phase 2 Randomized Double-Blind):Research to find biomarkers that may serve as surrogates for clinical endpoints in future veliparib studies 
or that may be predictive of veliparib activity will be conducted.  Serum, plasma, blood and tissue 
samples will be collected at designated time points throughout the study.
Tumor Assessments and Safety Follow-Up
Tumor assessments will be performed until radiographic disease progression.  Tumor assessment and 
assessment of response will occur every 6 weeks (± 1 week) from C1D-[ADDRESS_25528] 24 weeks (Phase 1) or 30 weeks (Phase 2), then every 9 weeks (± 1 week) thereafter.  Tumor response will be determined according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), Version 1.1.  Subjects will continue on study until they meet defined discontinuation criteria.  When the investigator has determined that a subject should discontinue the study, a Final Visit will be conducted.  Subjects will have a 30-Day Follow-Up Visit following the last dose of study drugs or placebo (Phase 2, dependent on treatment arm).  If the subject begins another treatment regimen directly following protocol treatment and if a 30-Day Follow-Up Visit is not possible, all adverse events ongoing as of the end of study must be 
followed to a satisfactory conclusion.

The following end point will be analyzed using data obtained from subjects in Phase 1 and Phase 2 
separately:
Objective Response Rate
The proportion of subjects with objective response (CR or PR) as assessed by [CONTACT_26218] 1.1 will be calculated for all dosed subjects.
The following end point will be analyzed using data obtained from subjects in Phase 2:
Progression-Free Survival
Progression-Free Survival will be defined as the number of days from the date of randomization to the 
date of earliest radiographic disease progression or death.  All disease progression will be included regardless whether the event occurred while the subject was taking study drug or had previously discontinued study drug.  If the subject does not experience disease progression or death, then the data 
will be censored at the date of the last radiographic disease assessment.
Overall Survival
Overall survival will be defined as the number of days from the date of randomization to the date of 
death.  For subjects who did not die, their data will be censored at the date of last study visit or the last 
known date to be alive, whichever is later.  
Duration of Overall Response
Duration of overall response will be defined as the number of days from the date of first response (CR or 
PR) to the earliest documentation of radiographic progressive disease.  If a subject is still responding, then the subject's data will be censored at the date of the subject's last available radiographic disease assessment.  For subjects who never experience response, the subject's data will not be included in the 
analysis.
Performance Status
Changes and/or percent changes from baseline will be summarized using descriptive statistics for each 
scheduled post-baseline visit and for the Final Visit for ECOG performance status.  Post-baseline measurements more than [ADDRESS_25539] 2014-001764-35

will be determined according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST), Version 1.1.
In the Phase 1 portion, subjects will receive veliparib BID in combination with 
carboplatin/etoposide for up to a maximum 4 cycles of treatment.  In the Phase 2 portion, subjects will receive veliparib or placebo BID as applicable in combination with carboplatin/etoposide for up to 6 cycles of treatment.  In Phase 1, subjects that do not progress according to a radiographic assessment (CT) at Cycle 4 may continue in the monotherapy portion veliparib or placebo as appropriate starting at Cycle 5 Day 1.  In Phase 2, subjects that do not progress according to a radiographic assessment (CT) at completion of at least 4 combination chemotherapy Cycles may continue in the monotherapy portion veliparib or placebo starting at Maintenance Day 1.  In the Phase 2 portion, subjects discontinuing both carboplatin and etoposide due to toxicity and without evidence of disease progression prior to the completion of 4 cycles of combination therapy may transition to monotherapy veliparib/placebo as per treatment arm assignment.  All subjects will remain on study until reaching a protocol defined event of disease progression.  Subjects in the Phase 2 portion of the study, who are discontinued from study treatment due to an adverse event, will remain on study/off study drugs until reaching an event of disease progression.
When an investigator has determined that a subject has met the protocol defined criteria 
for disease progression, as outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS] , a Final Visit will be conducted.
All subjects will have one Follow-Up Visit approximately [ADDRESS_25553] had a Final Visit conducted ≥ [ADDRESS_25554] treatment tumor assessments (if subject

Premedication: The prophylactic antiemetics, including 5-HT3 antagonists, according to 
institution, National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), European 
Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) or American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines should be given, prior to administration of carboplatin and etoposide.  Prophylaxis with anti-emetics (e.g., 5-HT3 antagonists such as ondansetron) is strongly recommended when initiating 
single agent veliparib maintenance therapy.
Anticancer Agents: Other anticancer agents are not permitted during the treatment portion of the 
study.  All subjects will receive carboplatin + etoposide with veliparib/placebo 
at specified timepoints during the treatment portion of the study.  The locally approved carboplatin and etoposide product labels or SmPCs should be referenced to determine if there are any contraindications associated with 
concomitant medications (e.g., phenytoin, etc.).
Supportive Care: Best supportive care and treatment will be given as appropriate to each subject 
(antiemetics, antibiotics, transfusions, nutritional support, non-radiation 
palliative treatment for pain, bisphosphonates or denosumab) according to 
institutional or clinical practice guidelines (e.g., ASCO, ESMO, or NCCN).
Growth Factors: Biologic response modifiers administered for erythropoiesis 
(e.g., erythropoietin, darbepoetin alpha) and colony stimulating factors 
(e.g., neulasta, G-CSF, GM CSF, etc.) may be administered according to institutional or clinical practice guidelines (e.g., ASCO, ESMO, or NCCN).  Growth factors prophylaxis will not be allowed in Cycle 1 (Day –2 through 
Day 21) of the dose escalation cohorts.
Radiation: Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is allowed during the study in the 
maintenance phase of treatment at Investigators discretion.  The dose of PCI 
should be 24 Gy in 8 fractions of 3 Gy each, or per local treatment standards.  Veliparib or placebo maintenance monotherapy will be held starting 2 days prior to the initiation of radiation therapy, throughout the radiation therapy and for 4 days following radiation therapy.  Palliative radiation to a non-target lesion with the intent of symptom control is allowed; non-progressing status of lesion 
to be irradiated must be documented prior to the procedure.
Surgery: If the subject requires surgery during the study, then this needs to be discussed 
with the [COMPANY_013] Medical Monitor.
Alternate Therapy: No traditional herbal anti-cancer medicine (e.g., Chinese, Asian, etc.) may be 
taken concurrently with veliparib (a 14-day washout period must be documented).

Subsection Calculation of Carboplatin Dose
Delete:  subsection title and text
Calculation of Carboplatin Dose
The below guidance recommendation for carboplatin dose calculation is intended to 
reduce variability of carboplatin doses between sites. 
The initial dose of carboplatin must be calculated using GFR.  In the absence of renal 
toxicity greater than or equal to CTCAE Grade 2 (serum creatinine > 1.5 × ULN) or toxicity requiring dose modification, the dose of carboplatin does not need to be recalculated for subsequent cycles, but will be subject to dose modification for toxicity as noted in the protocol.
Carboplatin doses will be based on the subject's weight at baseline and should remain the 
same throughout the study.  However, the doses may be recalculated based on the subject's weight at each cycle, and need to be recalculated if the subject has a weight change of greater than or equal to 10% from baseline.
In subjects with an abnormally low serum creatinine (less than 0.7 mg/dL), the creatinine 
clearance should be estimated using a minimum value of 0.7 mg/dL.
CALVERT FORMULA:Carboplatin dose (mg) = target AUC × (GFR + 25)NOTE:  the GFR used in the Calvert formula cannot exceed 125 mL/min.For the purposes of this protocol, the GFR is considered to be equivalent to the estimated 
creatinine clearance.  The estimated creatinine clearance (mL/min) is calculated by [CONTACT_26306]-Gault using the following formula:
Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) = [140-Age (years)] × Weight (kg) / 
(72 × Ser Cr (mg/dL))
Veliparib
M14-[ADDRESS_25638] 2014-001764-35
223
For female subjects:  multiply the result above by 0.85.
Notes:
Body mass index (BMI) should be calculated for each subject.  A BMI should be 
calculated using the following formula:
BMI = (Weight in kg) / (Height in meters)2
Actual weight should be used for estimation of GFR for subjects with BMI < 25.
Adjusted weight should be used for estimation of GFR for subjects with BMI 
≥25.
Adjusted weight calculation:
Ideal weight (kg) = (((Height (cm)/2.54) – 60) × 2.3) + 45.5
Adjusted weight (kg) = ((Actual weight – Ideal weight) × 0.40) + Ideal 
weight
If a patient with BMI of ≥ [ADDRESS_25639] 
dose with next planned treatment.
At the time of a dose modification for toxicity:
If the creatinine at the time of a dose modification is lower than the creatinine used to calculate the previous dose, use the previous (higher) creatinine; 
If the creatinine at the time of a dose modification is higher than the creatinine 
used to calculate the previous dose, use the current (higher) creatinine.  This will ensure that the patient is actually receiving a dose reduction. 
Note that carboplatin dose will be recalculated if the subject has weight change of greater than or equal to 10% from baseline.

5.5.4 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
(Randomized Phase 2 Portion)
All subjects will be randomized using an IRT system.  Before the study is initiated, 
directions for the IRT will be provided to each site.  The site will contact [CONTACT_26316] [ADDRESS_25644]'s Cycle 1 Day –2 to obtain a Screening (subject) number once the subject has signed the informed consent and a study-specific procedure has been performed (i.e., central laboratory samples drawn).  Once the screening number is assigned, if the subject is not enrolled in the study or is not randomized (as applicable), the reason for screen failure will be documented in the source document and in the eCRF.  For others, the site will access the system and a unique randomization number will be provided.
The IRT will randomize subjects in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the three treatment arms as 
follows:
●Arm A: veliparib in combination with carboplatin/etoposide followed by 
[CONTACT_26209]
●Arm B:  veliparib in combination with carboplatin/etoposide followed by

●Arm C:  placebo in combination with carboplatin/etoposide followed by [CONTACT_26210]
M14-[ADDRESS_25645] randomization will be stratified by:  [CONTACT_26265] ( ≤ ULN versus > ULN), and gender.
A bottle number randomization schedule and a subject randomization schedule will be

5.5.4 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
(Phase 2 Randomized Double-Blind)
All subjects will be randomized using an IRT system.  Before the study is initiated, the 
IRT user manual, which provides instruction on how to use the system via the web or phone, will be provided to each site.
Subjects who complete all Screening procedures and meet eligibility criteria may proceed 
to randomization.  Subject randomization will be stratified by:  [CONTACT_26265] ( ≤ ULN versus 
> ULN), and gender; therefore a subject's baseline LDH value must be known prior to randomization and when accessing the IRT to perform the randomization transaction.
The site will contact [CONTACT_26266] a Screening (subject) number once the subject has 
signed the informed consent and a study-specific procedure has been performed (i.e., central laboratory samples drawn).  Once the subject number is assigned, if the subject is not enrolled/randomized the reason for screen failure will be documented in the source document and in the eCRF.  If the subject meets all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria, the site will access the system to randomize the subject.

Section [IP_ADDRESS]  Guidelines for Carboplatin and Etoposide Dose Reductions and 
DelaysPreviously read:
The below guidelines are suggested, unless described as mandatory.  If a dose reduction 
or delay is required for carboplatin and/or etoposide, the Investigator should follow procedures according to institutional guidelines, the locally approved product label, local practice, or applicable SmPC.  If the Investigator considers an event attributable to carboplatin and/or etoposide, the Investigator may consider reducing carboplatin and/or etoposide, but not veliparib/placebo.  Suggested guidelines for dose reduction, delay, and discontinuation are included in Table 19 (if locally approved product label, local standard of care guideline or applicable SmPC for carboplatin/etoposide combination chemotherapy are not available).
Hematologic Toxicity
Neutropenia or Febrile Neutropenia
For febrile neutropenia with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 500/mm3 and a single 
temperature of > 38.3°C (101°F) or a sustained temperature of ≥ 38°C (100.4°F) for more 
than one hour, requiring intravenous antibiotics, the doses of both carboplatin and etoposide drugs should be reduced to the next lower dose level for all subsequent cycles of chemotherapy (Table 14).  Implement dose reductions [ADDRESS_25669] and second epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], respectively, as outlined in Table 19.  Consider initiating prophylactic neutrophil growth factors (e.g., G-CSF) after the first epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  If ANC counts do not recover within [ADDRESS_25670] be ≥  1,500/mm3on Day 1 of each cycle (mandatory).  If the counts are lower 
than the limit, then dosing of all drugs (carboplatin, etoposide and veliparib) should be 
delayed until recovery to the required ANC.
If the subject experiences fever with neutropenia, then neutrophil growth factors 
(e.g., G-CSF) should be given based on local standard of care guidelines, ASCO or NCCN guidelines.  
Platelets
For Grade 4 nadir platelet count decrease (thrombocytopenia) (platelets < 25,000 mm3), 
the dose of both carboplatin and etoposide should be reduced to next lower dose level from the previous dose for all subsequent cycles of chemotherapy.  Implement dose reductions [ADDRESS_25671] be > 100,000/mm
3on Day 1 of each cycle.  Doses or all drugs 
(carboplatin, etoposide and veliparib) should be delayed until platelet count recovers to 
> 100,000/mm3.
Anemia
No dose reductions will be made for anemia.  Subjects should be supported per the treating physician's discretion.  The use of RBC transfusions for anemia will be allowed as clinically indicated and as per local standard of care or current NCCN guidelines.  The use of growth factors for anemia is not permitted during Phase [ADDRESS_25672] 2014-001764-35
243
Non-Hematological Toxicity
Gastrointestinal Toxicity:  Nausea and Vomiting
All subjects should receive antiemetics* to prevent nausea and vomiting.  Specific

use of aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], if possible.  Nausea/vomiting should have resolved to Grade 1 or less prior to initiation of next treatment cycle.  Do not modify carboplatin and/or etoposide doses due to nausea/vomiting.
* Aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], when given once daily for 14 days as a 100 mg capsule with an oral contraceptive containing 35 mcg of 
ethinyl estradiol and 1 mg of norethindrone, decreased the AUC of ethinyl estradiol by 43% and decreased the 
AUC of norethindrone by 8%.  Women of childbearing potential using pregnancy contraception that includes ethinyl estradiol should not receive Aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_26180]/delayed emesis.  Subjects may change to a different method of contraception if they wish to use Aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053].
Hepatic Toxicity
For bilirubin > 1.5 – 3.0 × ULN, not attributable to underlying disease, reduce the dose of 
etoposide to 50 mg/m2.  For bilirubin > 3 – 5 × ULN reduce the dose of etoposide to 
30 mg/m2.  For bilirubin > 5 × ULN hold etoposide or hold all treatment if starting the 
next treatment cycle.  When bilirubin resolves to ≤ 5 × ULN, treatment can be resumed, 
with etoposide dose to 30 mg/m2.  If bilirubin does not improve to ≤ 5 × ULN within 
[ADDRESS_25673] occurrence, discontinue protocol therapy.

Any other Grade 3/4 toxicity Per local SmPC/institution guidelines Per local SmPC/institution guidelines
Has been changed to read:
The below guidelines are suggested, unless described as mandatory.  If a dose reduction 
or delay is required for carboplatin and/or etoposide, the Investigator should follow procedures according to institutional guidelines, the locally approved product label, local practice, or applicable SmPC.  If the Investigator considers an event attributable to carboplatin and/or etoposide, the Investigator may consider reducing carboplatin and/or etoposide, but not veliparib/placebo.  Suggested guidelines for dose reduction, delay, and discontinuation are included in Table 16 and Table 19 (if locally approved product label, 
Veliparib
M14-[ADDRESS_25677] of care guideline or applicable SmPC for carboplatin/etoposide 
combination chemotherapy are not available).
All carboplatin and/or etoposide dose reductions are permanent.  Re-escalation of the dose 
of therapy is not allowed.  All toxicities should have resolved to grade 1 or less prior to initiation of a new cycle of therapy, with the exception of anemia, alopecia, neuropathy, and non-treatment related clinically insignificant laboratory abnormalities.
If toxicity precludes the initiation of the dosing of carboplatin/etoposide in the cycle, and 
veliparib doses on Days –2 and –[ADDRESS_25678] already been administered, veliparib should be administered again once the toxicity resolves for two days prior to carboplatin/etoposide dosing.  In such a case, a new supply of veliparib/placebo is to be dispensed, and Day –2 and Day –1 are to be repeated for that cycle.
For Phase 1 ONLY:  PD and/or PK samples will not be drawn during carboplatin and/or 
etoposide dose delays.  If the Investigator considers an event attributable to carboplatin and/or etoposide and not veliparib, the Investigator may consider reducing the dose of both agents.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_25679] be withheld due to hematologic toxicity, CBC and platelet counts
should be obtained weekly via central labs (if done locally, sample MUST be split for central lab) until the counts reach the lower limits for treatment as outlined.  The treatment schedule will then proceed in the usual sequence.
Neutropenia or Febrile Neutropenia
For febrile neutropenia with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 500/mm3and a single 
temperature of > 38.3°C (101°F) or a sustained temperature of ≥ 38°C (100.4°F) for more 
than one hour, requiring intravenous antibiotics:

a. Doses of both carboplatin and etoposide drugs should be reduced to the next lower 
dose level for all subsequent cycles of chemotherapy.  Suggested dose reduction 
levels are outlined in Table 14 .
b. Implement dose reductions, as outlined in Table 19 .
c. Initiate prophylactic neutrophil growth factors (e.g., G-CSF) after the first epi[INVESTIGATOR_26178], ASCO or NCCN guidelines.
d. If ANC counts do not recover within [ADDRESS_25681] be ≥  1,500/mm
3on Day 1 of each cycle (mandatory).  If the ANC is lower 
than 1,500/mm3, then dosing of all drugs (carboplatin, etoposide and veliparib) will be 
delayed until recovery to the required ANC.
Platelets
For Grade 4 nadir platelet count decrease (thrombocytopenia) (platelets < 25,000 mm3), 
the dose of both carboplatin and etoposide should be reduced to next lower dose level 
from the previous dose for all subsequent cycles of chemotherapy.  Implement dose reductions [ADDRESS_25682] be > 100,000/mm
3on Day 1 of each cycle (mandatory).  Doses or all 
drugs (carboplatin, etoposide and veliparib) should be delayed until platelet count 
recovers to > 100,000/mm3.

Anemia
No dose reductions will be made for anemia.  Subjects should be supported per the 
treating physician's discretion.  The use of RBC transfusions for anemia will be allowed as clinically indicated and as per local standard of care or current NCCN guidelines.  The use of growth factors for anemia is not permitted during Phase 1 Cycle 1.
If more than two dose modifications of carboplatin and etoposide are required for 
hematologic toxicity, e.g., in cases where an additional dose modification is needed for a toxicity which was not observed earlier, please consult the [COMPANY_013] TA MD.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Non-Hematological Toxicity
Gastrointestinal Toxicity:  Nausea and Vomiting
All subjects should receive antiemetics* to prevent nausea and vomiting.  Specific 
antiemetic therapy is left to the discretion of the treating physician (steroids and 5-HT3 antagonists should be used).  For vomiting Grade ≥ 3, consider hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26179]/or 
use of aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], if possible.  Nausea/vomiting should have resolved to Grade 1 or less prior to initiation of next treatment cycle.  Do not modify carboplatin and/or etoposide doses due to nausea/vomiting.

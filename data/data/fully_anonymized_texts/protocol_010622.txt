1 Background and Specific Aims  
Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions  are among the most commonly performed outpatient 
orthopedic procedures, with approximately 400,000 ACLRs  performed each year.1 Outcomes following ACL 
reconstruction (ACLR) are excellent, with low rates of graft failure and high rates of return to pre -injury 
function.2,[ADDRESS_475369] 
be explored.4,5  
 
For arthroscopic ACLR  with Bone Patellar Tendon Bone (BPTB) autograft , assuming there are no contra -
indications, anesthesiologists at our institution perform a block of the saphenous nerve via the adductor 
canal, also known as adductor  canal block (ACB) .  When compared to a femoral nerve block (FNB) , the 
adductor canal  block has been shown to have equivalent analgesia without the undesired quadriceps 
weakness associated with  FNBs .6-[ADDRESS_475370] been several studies looking at the use of 
IPACK block in arthroplasty ; these studies hav e found a short term improved analgesic effect of decreased 
pain scores while in the post anesthesia care unit (PACU), however they did not find significant differences 
in amount of narcotics used postoperativly .6,9-11 In a study looking at ACLR with femoral block + IPACK and 
local infiltration anesthesia, patients who underwent IPACK and femoral block had lower postoperative IV morphine consumption within [ADDRESS_475371] been no studies looking at 
analgesia using IPACK block  combined with  adductor canal bloc k for patient undergoing ACLR in the 
ambulatory setting.  With this blinded randomized control trial, we seek to  elucidate the added benefit  of an 
IPACK  block and to determine if it leads to improved pain control and decreased opi[INVESTIGATOR_379839] .  
1.1 Specific Aims  
This study will aim to compare  ACB + IPACK block versus ACB only for posterior knee pain in patients 
undergoing ACLR  with BPTB autograft .   
 
AIM 1:   To determine if the addition of IPACK block to the standard of care ACB is superior in terms of 
decreasing opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], decreasing pain, and increasing analgesia duration  following anterior 
cruciate ligament reconstruction .  
 
1.[ADDRESS_475372] 24 hours (measured in morphine equivalents) compared to those who an isolated 
ACB  following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction . Furthermore, the study group will report lower 
postoperative pain scores on POD1 than the control group.  Failing to reject the null would signify that the 
IPACK  block has no clinically relevant difference on post -operative opi[INVESTIGATOR_379840] .

Sample Size:  50 
 
Medication:  15 mL of 0.25%  Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_379841] 20  mL of 0.25 % Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_379842]:  15 mL of 0.25% Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_379843] 
 
2.1 Description of Study Design  
RECRUITMENT PHASE/CONSENTING PHASE:  
Surgeons will identify eligible patients via Epic during their initial clinic visit and discuss the study . Surgeons 
will provide research coordinator  with the name [CONTACT_379881] .  If the patient 
meets the inclusion criteria outlined below and is agreeable,  subjects will be first introduced to the stu dy 
during one of their presurgical clinic visits and then consented on the day of surgery  by a member of the 
research team.  Patients will be made acquainted with the study  prior to surgery. On DOS when they arrive 
1.5/2 hours before surgery,  we (study tea m members) will consent them  in a private room  and provide ample 
time to discuss and review any questions or concerns they may have.   
 
BASELINE ASSESSMENTS:  
Subjects will complete a baseline VAS  McGill Pain scale , Kujala , KOOS -PS and Tegner Activity Scale  
 
RANDOMIZATION PHASE:  
Subjects scheduled to undergo ACLR  with BPTB autograft  will be  randomized to either ACB with IPACK block 
or to ACB only. A randomization scheme will be created prior to start of study enrollment using the 
randomizer.org website to generate the assignment. Block randomization is commonly used in clinical trial 
design to reduce bias  and achieve balance in the allocation of participants to treatment arms throughout the 
course of the study. Randomized block design allows us to account for variables so  that observed differences 
are largely due to true differences between   treatments and not to the variable. We will create blocks of four 
patients and in each block, two patients will be assigned to the IPACK + ACB  group, and two to the ACB only  
Study number:  s22-[ZIP_CODE]    Page 10 
Version: 02.10.[ADDRESS_475374]  to the 
IPACK + ACB or ACB only will be opened on the  day of surgery after the pat ient has signed consent agreeing 
to participate  in the study.  
 
Patients will be blinded to their group allocation. During peripheral block patients are sedated and 
postoperatively, the areas of infiltration will be covered by [CONTACT_379862].  
 
TRE
ATMENT PHASE:  
 
Patients in both the study and control group will receive the standard of care adductor canal block . This 
consists of 15mL of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]  (0.25%)  Injected under ultrasound guidance in the saphenous nerve via the 
adductor canal . Patients in the study group will receive the additional IPACK block performed using 20 mL 
of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (0.25%) injected into the i nterspace between the popliteal artery and capsule of the knee.  
 
 
POST- OPERATIVE PHASE:  
After initial recruitment, subjects’ pain will be assessed via visual analog scale (VAS) by [CONTACT_379863] -operative period as per standard of care in the post anesthesia care unit, and by [CONTACT_379864]. The VAS pain scores are collected and documented in the p atient’s 
electronic medical record. Additionally, a standardized regimen of pain medication will be given to all subjects who are enrolled. The pain medications given to patients are standard of care medication  [ADDRESS_475375]

 Process of Consent  
Written  consent for participation will be obtained on day of surgery in pre -operative holding room by [CONTACT_379867], or authorized researchers that are members of the study team. Extensive discussion of 
risks and possible benefits of participation will  be provided to the participants and their families. Consent 
forms will be IRB -approved, and participants will be asked to read and review the document. The investigator 
will explain the research study to the participant and answer any questions that may arise. All participants will receive a verbal explanation suited to their comprehension of the purposes, procedures and potential 
risks as well as their rights as research participants. Participants will have the opportunity to carefully review 
the written consent form and ask questions prior to signing. The participants will have the opportunity to 
discuss the study with their surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. The participant will sign the informed consent document prior to any procedures being done specifically for the study. The 
participants may withdraw consent at any time throughout the course of the trial. A copy of the key 
information form  document will be given to the participants for their records. The rights and welfare of the 
participants will be protected by [CONTACT_342987]. If possible,  subjects will be given a copy of the informed 
consent form at their pre -surgical visit to allow them time to read through it, discuss with their relatives, and 
contact [CONTACT_379868].  
 
A copy of the signed informed consent document will be given to the patient, placed in the patient’s 
electronic medical record and the original copy will be stored in the research regulatory binder.   Any 
alteration to the standard consent process (e.g., use of a translator, consent document presented orally, etc.) and the justification for such alteration w ill likewise be documented.  
 
Capacity will be assessed through the subject’s ability to express understanding of the information being 
presented to them. The subject will be asked to state back the goals of the study and that they are willing to 
participa te in their primary language.

4.1 Study Procedures/Evaluations  
4.1.[ADDRESS_475382] of care adductor canal block 
composed of 15 mL of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (0.25%). Patients in the study group will receive the additional IPACK 
block performed using 20 mL of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (0.25%) injected into the interspace between the popliteal 
artery and capsule of the knee. This use of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (0.25%) in this dosage is consistent with its 
approved use for peripheral nerve blocks of the lower extremity, per the package insert.  
 Postoperatively, pain will be assessed via visual analog scale (VAS) by [CONTACT_379869] -
operative period as per standard of care. The VAS pain scores are collected and documented in the patient’s electronic medical record. Additionally, while  the patient is in the PACU, an authorized research member 
will visit the patient and administer a pain questionnaire (VAS  and McGill Pain scale). Data on PACU opi[INVESTIGATOR_379850].  
4.1.[ADDRESS_475383] of care procedures will undergo adductor canal block with 15 mL of 0.25% 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] . Although not standard of care at this institution, the addition of IPACK block is widely accepted 
as a standard part of multimodal analgesia in ACLR.

ROM, and strength wil l be assessed.  
4.2.5  Withdrawal/Early Termination Visit  
Subjects may discontinue their participation in the study at any time. As there is only a single intervention, 
and the safety of this is not in question, further follow up will not be required if a subject  decides to terminate 
their participation in the study.  
 
4.3 Concomitant Medications, Treatments, and Procedures  
 All concomitant prescription medications taken during study participation will be recorded on the case 
report forms (CRFs). For this protocol, a prescription medication is defined as a medication that can be 
prescribed only by a properly authorized/licensed clinician. Medications to be reported in the CRF are 
concomitant prescription medications, over -the-counter medications and non -prescription me dications.

in the post anesthesia care unit per standard of care for  any adverse effects of the nerve block including 
nausea, vomiting , blurred vision, and infection at the injection site. Both the ACB and ACB plus IPACK  block 
are used as standard of care at this institution depending on treatment physician’s preference.  
 
5.2 Potential benefits  
 
Study subjects may experience better pain control, improved satisfaction, decreased need for opi[INVESTIGATOR_379856]. If the study is not inconclusive, the study’s results may benefit future 
patients by [CONTACT_379871] 24 hours of  an ACLR.  
 
6 Statistical Analysis  
6.1 General Approach  
The primary analysis will follow the intention -to-treat (ITT) principle in order to evaluate the true outcome 
of the intervention as experienced by [CONTACT_110817].  
 
Continuous and categorical baseline characteristics will be compared using Hedge s standardized difference  
Normally distributed data will be compared using t tests while non -n ormally distributed continuous 
outcomes will be assessed using the Mann -Whitney U test.  
 
It is anticipated that the data for some subjects will be incomplete for various reasons:  missing diary entries, refusal to answer a question on the questionnaire, onset of illness, loss -to-follow -up, etc. All occurrences of 
incomplete data will be investigated to carefully document the reasons for the missing data. If the pri mary 
outcome (amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_379836] 24 hours after surgery) cannot be ascertained with a 
reasonable degree of certainty, the patient will be excluded from the study.

7 Assessment of Safety  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal 
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_379874]:  s22-[ZIP_CODE]    Page 18

CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the NYU School of Medicine and Langone Medical Center.  Do not disclose or  use except as authorized in 
writing by [CONTACT_4530]  7.1 Definition of Adverse Events (AE)  
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
• fatal  
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• results in p ersistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event 
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening but are clearly of major 
clinical significance. They may jeop ardize the subject and may require intervention to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes noted above. For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in 
in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergen cy department would 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].   
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non -serious 
adverse events .  
7.2 Definition of Unanticipated Problems (UP) 
 
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all  o f the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency (i.e., not described in study -related documents such as 
the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc)  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (i.e., possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156])  
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm).  
 
T
his de finition could include an unanticipated adverse device effect, any serious adverse effect on health or 
safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, 
problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the 
investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other 
unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of 
subjects (21 CFR 812.3(s)).  
 
7.3 Classification of an Adverse Event  
7.3.1  Severity of Event  
 For AEs not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will be used to 
describe severity.  
• Mild  – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily 
activities.  
• Moderate  – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. 
Moderate events may cause some interference with func tioning.

CONFIDENTIAL  
This material is the property of the NYU School of Medicine and Langone Medical Center.  Do not disclose or  use except as authorized in 
writing by [CONTACT_4530]  • Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy 
or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life- threatening or incapacitating.  
 
7.3.2  Relationship to Study Agent 
 
The clinician’s assessment of an AE's relationship to study agent (drug, biologic, device) is part of the 
documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. If there is 
any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, t he event should be reported. All AEs must have their 
relationship to study agent assessed. In a clinical trial, the study product must always be suspect. To help assess, 
the following guidelines are used.  
 
1. Related – The AE is known to occur with the study agent, there is a reasonable possibility that the 
study agent caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study agent and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study 
agent  and the AE.  
2. Not Related – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study agent caused 
the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study agent and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been established.  
 For all collected AEs, the clinician who examines and evaluates the participant will determine the AE’s causality 
based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgment. The degree of certainty about causality will be 
graded using the categories below.  
 
1. Definitely Related  – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to drug administration and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_64716]. The response to withdrawal of the drug (dechallenge) should be clinically plausible. The event must be pharmacologically or phenomenologically definitive, with use of 
a satisfactory rechallenge procedure if necessary.  
2. Probably Related  – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other 
factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs within a 
reasonab le time after administration of the drug, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or 
other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this defi nition.  
3. Possibly Related  – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event occurred 
within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). However, other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the partici pant’s clinical condition, other concomitant events). 
Although an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “probably related” or “definitely related,” as appropria te. 
4. Unlikely to be related  – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose 
temporal relationship to drug administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administrat ion of the trial medication) and in which other 
drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the participant’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).  
5. Not Related – The AE is completely independent of study drug administration, and/or evidence exists 
that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an alternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370].  
 
Study number:  s22-[ZIP_CODE]    Page 20 
Version: 02.10.[ADDRESS_475388]. Strauss , will be responsible for determining whether  an AE is expected or unexpected. An AE will 
be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk 
information previously described for the study agent.  
 
7.4 Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment a nd Follow -Up 
 The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and 
interviews of a study participant presenting for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor. All AEs 
including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the appropriate 
RF. Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, 
relationship to study product (assessed only by [CONTACT_8703] a diagnosis), 
and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study must be documented 
appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  
 
Any medical condition tha t is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE. UPs will be recorded in the data collection system throughout 
the study.  
 Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset 
and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_46183] 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation. At each 
study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit. Events will be 
followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.   
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_1374], the 
subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the 
investigator should instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.  The investigator should notify the study sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any time after a subject has 
discontinued or terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this study.  The sponsor 
should also be notified if the investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that has participated in this s tudy.  
 
7.5 Reporting Procedures – Notifying the IRB  
7.5.1  Unanticipated Problem Reporting  
 Incidents or events that meet the OHRP criteria for UPs require the creation and completion of an UP report 
form. It is the site investigator’s responsibility to report UPs to their IRB. The UP report will include the 
following information:  
 
1. Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project number;  
2. A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;

This material is the property of the NYU School of Medicine and Langone Medical Center.  Do not disclose or  use except as authorized in 
writing by [CONTACT_4530]  3. An explanation o f the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an UP;  
4. A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or are 
proposed in response to the UP.  
 
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UPs will be reported using the following timeline:  
 
• UPs that are SAEs will be reported to the IRB within 7 days of the investigator becoming aware of the event.  
• Any other UP will be reported to the IRB within 7 days of the investigato r becoming aware of the 
problem.  
• All UPs should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required by [CONTACT_17347]’s written reporting procedures), the supporting agency head (or designee), and OHRP within 7 days 
of the IR’s receipt of the report of the problem from the investigator.  
7.6 Safety Oversight  
 It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigato r Eric J Strauss , and co -investigators David Furgiuele MD  
and Jovan Popovic  MD to oversee the safety of the study at his/her site.  This safety monitoring will include 
careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted above, as well as the construction 
and implementation of a site data and safety -monitoring plan. Adverse Events such as development of an 
allergy to local anesthetic, inadvertent intravascular injection of local anesthetic and infection at site of 
injection will be reviewed every three months. Serious adverse events are rare and are unlikely to occur but 
if a serious adverse event occurs, steps will be taken to address it.  Study recruitment will cease temporarily while a data safety monitoring team convenes to review the event. Medical monitoring will include a regular 
assessment of the number a nd type of serious adverse events.  
 
Data Safety Monitoring Plan  
 The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_277259] J Strauss , and co -investigators David Furgiuele MD  and Jovan Popovic  MD are 
responsible for data safety and monitoring of the overall study.   
 
The following da ta points  and outcomes  will be reviewed during data safety monitoring reviews: number of 
patients enrolled, pain scores of patients, AEs and SAEs such as neuro and cardiotoxicity. Data will be 
monitored quarterly  and will be reported at the time of continuing review.  
 The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_379857], as measured by [CONTACT_379875], 
specifically neurotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, or allergic reaction to bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]. A chi -square test will be used to 
determine if there is  a statistically significant difference (p<0.01) in the rate of SAEs between treatment 
arms. If there is a statistically significant difference in the rates of SAEs between arms, accrual to the trail will be suspended while the study team and data safety m onitoring team conduct an evaluation of the 
events.

subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico -technical departments 
involved in the clinical trial. It is acceptable to use CRFs as source documents. If this is the case, it should be stated in this section what data will be collected on CRFs and what data will be collected from other sources.  
 
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All data requested 
on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing data must be explained.  If a space on the CRF is left blank because 
the procedure was not done or the question was not aske d, write “N/D”.  If the item is not applicable to the 
individual case, write “N/A”.  All entries should be printed legibly in black ink.  If any entry error has been made, to correct such an error, draw a single straight line through the incorrect entry and enter the correct data above it.  All such changes must be initialed and dated.  DO NOT ERASE OR WHITE OUT ERRORS.  For 
clarification of illegible or uncertain entries, print the clarification above the item, then initial and date it.

sponsor, government regulatory bodies, and University compliance  and quality assurance groups of all study 
related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data 
etc.).  The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study -related facilities (e.g. 
pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  
 
Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by [CONTACT_28832].  
9 Quality Assuranc e and Quality Control  
QC procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system and data QC checks that will be 
run on the database will be generated. Any missing data or data anomalies will be communicated to the 
site(s) for clarification/res olution.  
 
Following written SOPs, the monitors will verify that the clinical trial is conducted and data are generated, 
documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the protocol, GCP, and the applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
10 Ethics/Protection  of Human Subjects  
10.[ADDRESS_475389]  
The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full conformity with Regulations for the 
Protection of Human Subjects of Research codified in 45 CFR Part 46, 21 CFR Part 50, 21 CFR Part 56, 
and/or the ICH E6 . 
10.[ADDRESS_475390]  
The protocol, informed consent form(s), recruitment materials, and all participant materials will be submitted to the IRB for review and approval. Approval of both the protocol and the consent form must be 
obtained before any p articipant is enrolled. Any amendment to the protocol will require review and 
approval by [CONTACT_3484]. All changes to the consent form will be IRB approved; a determination will be made regarding whether previously consented participants need 
to be re -consented.  
Study number:  s22-[ZIP_CODE]    Page 23 
Version: 02.10.[ADDRESS_475391] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed 
subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains 
the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that 
have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at t he end of their scheduled study period.  
 Participant confidentiality is strictly held in trust by [CONTACT_3486], their staff, and the 
sponsor(s) and their agents. Therefore, the study protocol, documentation, data, and all other informati on 
generated will be held in strict confidence. No information concerning the study or the data will be released 
to any unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the sponsor.  
 The study monitor, other authorized representatives of the spon sor, representatives of the IRB or 
pharmaceutical company supplying study product may inspect all documents and records required to be 
maintained by [CONTACT_093], including but not limited to, medical records (office, clinic, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) and 
pharmacy records for the participants in this study. The clinical study site will permit access to such records.

11.1  Data Collection and Management Responsibilities  
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of the site PI. 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data 
reported.  
 
All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of 
data. Black ink is required to ensure clarity of reproduced copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. When making changes or corrections, 
cross out the original entry with a single line, and initial and date the change. DO NOT ERASE, OVERWRITE, 
OR USE CORRECTION FLUID OR TAPE ON THE ORIGINAL.

writing by [CONTACT_379879] a progress note and maintained in the participant’s official electronic study record.  
 Clinical data (including AEs, concomitant medications, and expected adverse reactions data) and clinical 
laboratory data will be entered into Redcap. The data system includes passwo rd protection and internal 
quality checks, such as automatic range checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate. Clinical data will be entered directly from the source documents.  
11.2  Study Records Retention  
Study documents will  be retained for the longer of 3 years after close- out, 5 years after final 
reporting/publication.  
 
11.3  Protocol Deviations  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, GCP, or Manual of Procedures (MOP) requirements. The noncompliance may be either on the part of the participant, the investigator, or 
the study site staff. As a result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by [CONTACT_90478].  
 These practices are consistent with ICH E6:  
• 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3  
• 5.1 Quality Assurance and Quality Control, section 5.1.1  
• 5.20 Noncompliance, sections 5.20.1, and 5.20.2.  
 
It is the responsibility of the site PI/study staff to use continuous vigilance to identif y and report deviations 
within [ADDRESS_475393] be reported to the local IRB per their guidelines. The site PI/study staff is 
responsible for knowing and adhering to their IRB requirements. Further details about the handling of 
protocol deviations will be included in the MOP.  
 
11.4  Publication and Data Sharing Policy  
 
The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (I CMJE) member journals have adopted a clinical 
trials registration policy as a condition for publication. The ICMJE defines a clinical trial as any research project that prospectively assigns human subjects to intervention or concurrent comparison or control 
groups to study the cause -and-effect relationship between a medical intervention and a health outcome. 
Medical interventions include drugs, surgical procedures, devices, behavioral treatments, process -of-care 
changes, and the like. Health outcomes include any biomedical or health -related measures obtained in 
patients or participants, including pharmacokinetic measures and adverse events. The ICMJE policy, and the 
Section [ADDRESS_475394] of 2007, requires that all cli nical trials be 
registered in a public trials registry such as ClinicalTrials.gov, which is sponsored by [CONTACT_294434]. Other biomedical journals are considering adopting similar policies. For interventional clinical 
trials performed und er NIH IC grants and cooperative agreements, it is the grantee’s responsibility to 
register the trial in an acceptable registry, so the research results may be considered for publication in ICMJE member journals. The ICMJE does not review specific studies to determine whether registration is 
necessary; instead, the committee recommends that researchers who have questions about the need to

 FDAAA mandates that a "responsible party" (i.e., the sponsor or designated principal investigator) register 
and report results of certain "applicable clinical trials":  
 
• Trials of Drugs and Biologics: Controlled, clinical investigations, other than Phase I investigations of a 
product subject to FDA regulation;  
• Trials of Devices: Controlled trials with health outcomes of a product subject to FDA regulation (other than small feasibility studies) and pediatric postmarket surveillance studies.  
• NIH grantees must take specific steps to ensure compliance with NIH implementation of FDAAA.

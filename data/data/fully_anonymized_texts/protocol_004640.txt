Protocol Abstract Biofilms are aggregates of microorganisms that are attached to a surface and enmeshed in a protective extracellular polymeric matrix, causing many infectious diseases. Biofilm-associated infections are notoriously difficult to treat. Bacterial infections in the root canal lead to high rates of failure of endodontic treatments. Conventional drugs often fail to kill the microbes embedded within biofilms and are incapable of destroying the matrix. New approach using catalytic nanoparticles (CAT-NP) that are biocompatible and have potent anti-biofilm action has been proposed. Studies on CAT-NP have shown that CAT-NP rapi[INVESTIGATOR_318647] H2O2 to generate free radicals in situ to degrade the biofilm matrix and simultaneously kill embedded bacteria with exceptional efficacy. Moreover, the treatment suppresses virulent biofilm formation without cytotoxicity in an animal biofilm model. Recently, a clinically approved and commercially available iron oxide nanoparticle formulation with similar catalytic activity and anti-biofilm properties of CAT-NP became available. The purpose of this study is to develop a protocol for biofilms disinfection with a clinically approved and commercially available iron oxide nanoparticle formulation Feraheme. This protocol will be testing a local single topi[INVESTIGATOR_318646], will evaluate its potential as anti-biofilm treatment and compare it to other currently used antibacterial protocols  Objectives Overall objectives The purpose of this study is to develop a better, more effective disinfection protocol against biofilms within the root canal system, subsequently, improve the success of root canal treatment in teeth with api[INVESTIGATOR_318648]. This protocol will be testing local single topi[INVESTIGATOR_55594] a very low dose of Feraheme within the canal system in patients going through routine endodontic treatment, will evaluate its potential as a novel antibacterial, anti-biofilm treatment by [CONTACT_90169]-canal bacterial sampling and compare it to other currently used antibacterial protocols  Primary outcome variable(s) Studies has shown that the bacteria within tooth root canal system is the primary etiology for the root- end disease process. The reduction or elimination of microorganisms from the root canal system of infected teeth has been shown to correlate with the long-term success of the endodontic treatment. The main objective of root canal treatment is to disinfect root canal systems entirely and seal to prevent further contamination. However, with current techniques, it is impossible to eradicate bacteria and biofilm completely from the complex root canal system. This study is designed to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of Feraheme/H2O2 and to compare it to the routinely used protocol. The outcome 
Page 8 of 21  will be evaluated by [CONTACT_318664]. Bacteria from each sample will be quantified. The primary outcome parameter will be the difference in bacterial reduction between the experimental group (Feraheme) and a comparison group (routinely used protocol).  Secondary outcome variable(s) Complex anatomy limit the efficacy of disinfection solutions and protocols. By [CONTACT_318665], we will have a better understanding on the efficacy of tested solutions. Furthermore, proof-of-concept experiments in endodontic treatment could open the door for Feraheme to be used in numerous clinical anti-biofilm applications.  Background Endodontic research has established the importance of microorganisms in the pathogenesis of api[INVESTIGATOR_318648] (1-3). The reduction or elimination of microorganisms is a logical aim for successful endodontic treatment. Sjörgen et al (4) evaluated the long-term outcome after one step endodontic treatment of teeth with negative or positive cultures after instrumentation. 94% of the teeth filled after a negative culture succeeded, whereas only 68% of the canals filled after a positive culture had been detected were successful. Based on this study the optimal clinical success will be reached if a tooth is filled when the bacterial load of the canal is undetectable with culturing methods. Because culturing is as yet only effective as a research tool, the clinician should expect optimal success when treating an infected tooth with a technique or protocol that has been shown experimentally to result in consistent negative cultures. By[CONTACT_318666]öm et al (5-7) published a series of studies to evaluate the antibacteriological effects of the individual steps in the endodontic procedure. Only after instrumentation using endodontic instruments with NaOCl and EDTA irrigation and a dressing of calcium hydroxide it was possible to obtain a predictable negative culture (5-7). However, Histo-bacteriological studies have shown that even after meticulous chemo-mechanical preparation using endodontic instruments with NaOCl and EDTA and obturation of the root canal system, a significant amount of bacterial biofilm is often present in the anatomical complexities of the root canal system (isthmuses, api[INVESTIGATOR_318649], accessory canals, and dentinal tubules) and on the walls of the main root canal that was not engaged by [CONTACT_318667] (8-10). Endodontic biofilms may play a key role in infections persisting after primary or secondary endodontic treatment, as microorganisms growing in biofilms are better protected from adverse environmental changes and other antimicrobial agents. Ricucci et al, (11) evaluated the prevalence of bacterial biofilms in untreated root canals of teeth showing api[INVESTIGATOR_318650] 80% of the cases. Nevertheless, the persistence of endodontic infections is also attributed to the presence of the aforementioned anatomical complexities, which can harbor biofilm and protect it from the effects of the current disinfection solutions (12). Based on these facts, advanced disinfection strategies with the ability to disrupt biofilm are needed to achieve the goal of endodontic treatment and to overcome the persistence of endodontic infections, if possible using less harsh chemicals as currently used (e.g. NaOCl). Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is commonly used as a safe green chemical (13) for disinfection purposes or as tooth-whitening agent (at concentrations as high as 10%) because it generates free radicals that exhibit antibacterial activity or stain removal (through degradation of polymeric substances). However, the process of free radical generation is slow and H2O2 by [CONTACT_318668] a modest anti-biofilm or endodontic disinfection effects when used alone. It has been shown that catalytic iron oxide nanoparticles (CAT-NP) have enhanced peroxidase-like activity that catalyzes hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to create a potent anti-biofilm action in vivo (14). Very low concentrations of CAT-NP (at 0.5 mg/ml) rapi[INVESTIGATOR_318651] H2O2 to generate free radicals in situ that simultaneously degrade the biofilm matrix and kill embedded bacteria with exceptional efficacy within 5 minutes (5,000-fold more effective than H2O2 alone), without cytotoxic effects on oral tissues in vivo (14). Recently, in a preliminary in- vitro study we tested the antibacterial activity of CAT-NP/ H2O2 in comparison to 3% H2O2, 3% NaOCl, and 2% CHX, the latter two solutions are current disinfectants used in endodontic treatment. The solutions were topi[INVESTIGATOR_318652] E. faecalis, a commonly isolated microorganism from root canal treated teeth with persistent api[INVESTIGATOR_318648]. Our results show that the antibacterial activity of CAT-NP/H2O2 was significantly better than the conventional irrigants. CAT-NP/H2O2 was up to 30-fold more effective in bacterial killing compared to NaOCl and CHX. These results reveal the potential to exploit CAT-NP/H2O2 as a potent alternative approach for treatment of endodontic infections. Recently, an FDA-approved iron oxide nanoparticle formulation known as Feraheme became available commercially. Our in-vitro studies have shown that the peroxidase-like activity of Feraheme is similar to CAT-NP and this nanoparticle with H2O2 exhibited similar catalytic activity and potent anti-biofilm effects against endodontic biofilms. Feraheme is approved as an intravenous treatment for iron deficiency with repeated dosing at 510 mg. For 
Page 9 of 21  endodontic applications, only a single topi[INVESTIGATOR_318653] 6 mg (which is 85 times less than the FDA-approved dose) would be used for a transient exposure (for less than 10 minutes) of infected tooth canal in the oral cavity, supporting the potential clinical translation of a Feraheme/H2O2 anti- biofilm treatment. Proof-of-concept experiments in endodontic treatment could open the door for Feraheme to be used in numerous clinical anti-biofilm applications. The assessment of bacterial reduction during endodontic therapy by [CONTACT_318669] (15-18). There is a current need for a better disinfecting agent that is capable of overcoming the limitations of the currently used irrigation solutions, and based on our preliminary findings, CAT-NP/H2O2 has a potential as a novel anti-biofilm clinical therapy with its potent antibacterial and anti-biofilm activities. The purpose of this study is to develop an irrigation disinfection protocol for eradicating biofilms with a clinically approved and commercially available iron oxide nanoparticle formulation Feraheme. This protocol will be testing local application of Feraheme within the canal system in patients going through routine endodontic treatment, will evaluate its potential as a novel anti-biofilm disinfection solution and compare it to other currently used antibacterial protocols.

Study Design Phase* Not applicable  Design Patients presenting to the Department of Endodontics, School of Dental Medicine, University of Pennsylvania for evaluation and routine endodontic treatment of infected, necrotic teeth with chronic api[INVESTIGATOR_318656]. Prior to patient recruitment a randomized chart was drafted that assigns teeth to either NaOCL or Feraheme/H2O2 (amended). After eligibility of the patient is confirmed, the randomly assigned protocol for the tooth to be treated will be looked up by [CONTACT_318670] 10 of 21  investigator. Before treatment, patients will be thoroughly informed about the nature, potential risks and alternatives of the study as well as the root canal treatment. Patients will be presented with a written consent form regarding the above mentioned study characteristics (amended to this IRB proposal) as well as the regular consent forms for the root canal therapy, including the consent form for endodontic treatement, acknowledgement of privacy practices and a patient understanding and informed consent form. Patients will be eligible to participate in the study for NaOCL or Feraheme/H2O2 if the following inclusion criteria are met: 1. Patients to welling to participate in the study. 2.

(19). Briefly, Patients presenting to the Department of Endodontics for evaluation and treatment of infected, necrotic teeth with chronic api[INVESTIGATOR_318659]. Informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_458]. The patient will be anesthetized, and the tooth will be isolated with rubber dam and opal dam will be placed around the tooth. The tooth, the clamp, and the rubber dam will be cleansed using 30% hydrogen peroxide and disinfected with 3% NaOCl. After access preparation with sterile burs and sterile saline irrigation, thermoplastic gutta percha will be placed to temporarily block the orifice. The field, including the pulp chamber, will be cleaned and disinfected as described previously. NaOCl will be neutralized with 10% sodium thiosulfate. After removal of the gutta percha from the root canal orifices and working length determination, Liquid Dental Transport Media (LDT) will be placed in the canal with a sterile 31g needle, and a #15 Hedstrom file will be used in a filing motion to scrape the canal walls and agitate the canal content. (S1) sample will be taken by [CONTACT_1299] a sterile paper point in the canal, allow it to saturate for 30 seconds, and then transfer to a tube containing LDT. This step will be once more with a second paper point. The treatment solution (saline, NaOCl, or Fer/H2O2) 2 mL will be introduced into the canal. Canals will be instrumented with 15/0.04, 20/0.04, and 25/0.[ADDRESS_392190] time of 10 minutes. Canal contents will be deactivated with sodium thiosulphate for NaOCl, and saline wash will be used for Fer/H2O2 and saline treatments. A wash step with 1 mL saline will be done to wash the deactivating solution, and paper points will be used to dry the canals. A second bacterial sample will be taken (S2) by [CONTACT_318672], agitating it with 25/0.[ADDRESS_392191] groups to evaluate if further irrigation after (S2) will lead to more reduction of bacterial counts inside the root canal system. This could inform future experiments evaluating the possibility of synergistic antimicrobial effects for the sequential Fer/H2O2 and NaOCl treatment. All canals in all groups were irrigated with 2 mL of 3% NaOCl (1 min), followed by [CONTACT_318673] [ADDRESS_392192] bacterial sample (S3) was taken following the deactivation, washing, drying, and sampling steps as described above.The remaining treatment sequences of the routine root canal therapy will be carried out after these procedures including further root-end enlargement and final routine irrigation protocol. The root canals will be dried with paper points, a medication (calcium hydroxide) will be placed and the teeth sealed with a temporary restoration. Patients will return after one to four weeks for completion of the root filling. For the any of the groups, the treatment procedures carried out during this investigation do not differ from the standard root canal treatment protocol with the exception of additional irrigation step with the experimental solution and the bacteriologic sampling procedures. The paper points used to take the bacteriological sampling will be transferred to the microbiology laboratory using a vial containing 1 ml of reduced transport fluid (LDT). The laboratory procedures will be performed at the University of Pennsylvanias Leon Levy Oral Health Sciences Building of the School of Dental Medicine in the Microbiology Laboratory (Dr. M. Koo's laboratory). Vial labels will contain information on tooth number, sample number (S0-S1-S2-S3) and the experimental group. Patient information will not be used in any case. LDT vials with samples will be vortexed before preparing aliquots. Samples with dilutions of 10, 100, and 1000-fold will be prepared 
Page 11 of 21  under anaerobic conditions using sterile glassware. Cell culture dishes with anaerobic sheep blood agar will be inoculated with 0.25 ml of undiluted sample, as well as each of the three dilutions. The culture plates will be incubated at 37°C in an anaerobic glove box containing 5% hydrogen, 10% nitrogen, and 85% CO2 for [ADDRESS_392193] and complete the research. Please confirm that there are adequate facilities for the research. Patients will be treated in the Endodontic Clinic of the University of Pennsylvania's Department of Endodontics of the School of Dental Medicine (PDM). The Endodontic Clinic exclusively handles all root canal procedures carried out at the PDM with the exception of Dental Care Network facilities. By [CONTACT_318674], more than [ADDRESS_392194] and participants protection at all times. Before treatment of an individual patient potentially suitable for treatment under the conditions of this investigation, the research consent form, the general root canal treatment consent form, OSHA, HIPPA, privacy notice etc. will be reviewed with the patient. Besides the principal investigator (BK), who is a full-time member of the Endodontic Department, and the co-investigator (AB), who is one of the endodontic residents, endodontic residents are under supervision of full-time and/or part-time faculty members during patient treatments at any time. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_6254]-investigator received training, conducted research in cell culture techniques and analysis. Needs for medical or psychological services are not a possible consequence of the bacterial sampling procedures to be undertaken during the routine root canal therapy for this research project. Any medical needs that should arise during the routine endodontic therapy are covered by [CONTACT_318675]’s medical emergency services (511) as for any other dental procedure routinely carried out at the PDM. The laboratory part of the investigation will be performed in the Microbiology Laboratory (Dr. M. Koo's laboratory) of the Leon Levy Oral Health Sciences Building of the School of Dental Medicine. This laboratory is well equipped for cell culture and the handling of anaerobic bacteria, including an anaerobic glove box as well as all standard equipment for laboratory cell culture.

No  Procedures Patients presenting to the Department of Endodontics, School of Dental Medicine, University of Pennsylvania for evaluation and routine endodontic treatment of infected, necrotic teeth with chronic api[INVESTIGATOR_318656]. Prior to patient recruitment a randomized chart was drafted that assigns teeth to either NaOCL, saline or Feraheme/H2O2 (amended). After eligibility of the patient is confirmed, the randomly assigned protocol for the tooth to be treated will be looked up by [CONTACT_458]. Before treatment, patients will be thoroughly informed about the nature, potential risks and alternatives of the study as well as the root canal treatment. Patients will be presented with a written consent form regarding the above mentioned study characteristics (amended to this IRB proposal) as well as the regular consent forms for the root canal therapy, including the consent form for endodontic treatement, acknowledgement of privacy practices and a patient understanding and informed consent form. Patients will be eligible to participate in the study for NaOCL (positive control), saline (negative control or Feraheme/H2O2 if the following inclusion criteria are met: 1. Patients to welling to participate in the study. 2. Patients are 18 years or above. 3.

The treatment and sampling procedures will largely follow the protocol described by [CONTACT_318671][INVESTIGATOR_318658]. (19). Briefly, Patients presenting to the Department of Endodontics for evaluation and treatment of infected, necrotic teeth with chronic api[INVESTIGATOR_318659]. Informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_458]. The patient will be anesthetized, and the tooth will be isolated with rubber dam and opal dam will be placed around the tooth. The tooth, the clamp, and the rubber dam will be cleansed using 30% hydrogen peroxide and disinfected with 3% NaOCl. After access preparation with sterile burs and sterile saline irrigation, thermoplastic gutta percha will be placed to temporarily block the orifice. The field, including the pulp chamber, will be cleaned and disinfected as described previously. NaOCl will be neutralized with 10% sodium thiosulfate. After removal of the gutta percha from the root canal orifices and working length determination, Liquid Dental Transport Media (LDT) will be placed in the canal with a sterile 31g needle, and a #15 Hedstrom file will be used in a filing motion to scrape the canal walls and agitate the canal content. (S1) sample will be taken by [CONTACT_1299] a sterile paper point in the canal, allow it to saturate for 30 seconds, and then transfer to a tube containing LDT. This step will be once more with a second paper point. The treatment solution (saline, NaOCl, or Fer/H2O2) 2 mL will be introduced into the canal. Canals will be instrumented with 15/0.04, 20/0.04, and 25/0.[ADDRESS_392196] time of 10 minutes. Canal contents will be deactivated with sodium thiosulphate for NaOCl, and saline wash will be used for Fer/H2O2 and saline treatments. A wash step with 1 mL saline will be done to wash the deactivating solution, and paper points will be used to dry the canals. A second bacterial sample will be taken (S2) by [CONTACT_318672], agitating it with 25/0.[ADDRESS_392197] groups to evaluate if further irrigation after (S2) will lead to more reduction of bacterial counts inside the root canal system. This could inform future experiments evaluating the possibility of synergistic antimicrobial effects for the sequential Fer/H2O2 and NaOCl treatment. All canals in all groups were irrigated with 2 mL of 3% NaOCl (1 min), followed by [CONTACT_318673] [ADDRESS_392198] bacterial sample (S3) was taken following the deactivation, washing, drying, and sampling steps as described previously. The remaining treatment sequences of the routine root canal therapy will be carried out after these procedures further root-end enlargement and final routine irrigation protocol. The root canals will be dried with paper points, a medication (calcium hydroxide) will be placed and the teeth sealed with a temporary restoration. Patients will return after one to four weeks for completion of the root filling. For the any of the groups, the treatment procedures carried out during this investigation do not differ from the standard root canal treatment protocol with the exception of additional irrigation step with the experimental solution and the bacteriologic sampling procedures. The paper points used to take the bacteriological sampling will be transferred to the microbiology laboratory using a vial containing 1 ml of reduced transport fluid (LDT). The laboratory procedures will be performed at the University of Pennsylvania’s Leon Levy Oral Health Sciences Building of the School of Dental Medicine in the Microbiology Laboratory (Dr. M. Koos laboratory). Vial labels will contain information on tooth number, sample number (S0-S1-S2-S3) and the experimental group. Patient information will not be used in any case. LDT vials with samples will be vortexed before preparing aliquots. Samples with dilutions of 10, 100, and 1000-fold will be prepared under anaerobic conditions using sterile glassware. Cell culture dishes with anaerobic sheep blood agar will be inoculated with 0.25 ml of undiluted sample, as well as each of the three dilutions. The culture plates will be incubated at 37°C in an anaerobic glove box containing 5% hydrogen, 10% nitrogen, and 85% CO2 for [ADDRESS_392199] will be used for statistical analysis.

Consent Process Overview Patients routinely sign a consent form before being seen in the endodontic clinic. This form reviews the routine root canal procedure and any risks associated with it. We review routinely the consent form and health history with the patient and answer any questions that they may have on root canal procedures. The language used in the consent form is meant for lay-people and is not scientific in nature. If a patient chooses to participate in our study, they will sign an additional consent form for participation prior to participating. They will be made aware that if they do not wish to participate, they will not receive any treatment that is subpar as opposed to if they did agree to participate. The examiners will review the consent form with the patient and answer any questions they may have. If at any point, a patient decides they no longer want to participate, they will be excused from the study and will continue treatment as needed.

Risk / Benefit Potential Study Risks Only the risks or discomforts that can arise during or after any routine root canal treatment procedure apply. Bacterial sampling will not have any adverse effect on the treatment or on treatment outcome. There are no potential risks expected from the noninvasive bacteriological sampling, including any potential physical, psychological, social, economic, monetary, legal or other risks. Identifying the antibacterial benefits of Feraheme/H2O2 irrigation is the goal of our experiment. Feraheme with much higher concentrations has been used in medicine as IV to improve and heal patients iron deficiency. Feraheme used in this experiment is limited within the root canal system and applied on dentine surfaces only. It will not be used systemically. Solution will be kept within the root canal system for a couple of minutes proposed in this protocol and will be evacuated by [CONTACT_318678], dental suction and paper points. Experiment was designed that the final root canal disinfection is not relying on experimental solutions antibacterial effect only. After bacterial sampling, antibacterial medication (CaOH2) will placed as done routinely to treat cases with pulp necrosis and api[INVESTIGATOR_318648]. Besides tooth number, diagnosis and the PDM chart number (for potential verification of study correctness) no patient data will be collected by [CONTACT_978]. All treatment procedures at the PDM, including the routine root canal treatment of the participants, during which the samples will be taken, are subject to strict HIPPA (privacy) and OSHA (hygiene) regulations.  Potential Study Benefits The participant is not expected to get any personal benefit from taking part in this proposed research study. Microbial elimination is a key to the successful treatment of infected, necrotic teeth. Finding a better protocol to reduce intracanal infection will increase the successful outcome of endodontically treated necrotic, infected teeth and will result in an increased retention of natural teeth for the general population. The proposed study will verify by [CONTACT_318679], whether Feraheme/H2O2 irrigation protocol can provide better, effective disinfection on root canal surfaces and a significant reduction of intra-canal infection in-vivo. If this can be demonstrated by [CONTACT_318680].  Alternatives to Participation (optional) If patient does not want to participate in the study, elected root canal treatment will be completed.  Data and Safety Monitoring Investigators listed on the proposal will monitor the progress of the experiment. Routine meetings will be conducted to assess the number of samples collected, results, patient comments and complains, investigators' comments and findings.

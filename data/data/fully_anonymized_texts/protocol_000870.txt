BMS will provide the investigator with an appropriate (ie, Global or Lo cal) sample informed 
consent form which will include all elements required by [CONTACT_12212], GCP and applicable regulatory 
requirements. The sample informed consent form w ill adhere to the ethi cal principles that have 
their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Investigators must:
1) Provide a copy of the consent form and written information about the study in the language in 
which the subject is most proficient prior to clinical study participation. The language must be 
non-technical and easily understood. 
2) Allow time necessary for subj ect or sub ject's legally acceptable representative to inquire about 
the details of the study.
3) Obtain an informed consent signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_29159]'s legally 
acceptable representative and by [CONTACT_28490]. 
4) Obtain the IRB/IEC’s written approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_82705], prior to the beginning of the study, 
and after any revisions are completed for new information.
5) If informed consent is initially given by a subject’s legally acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, and the subject subsequently becomes capable of making and communicating his or 
her informed consent during the study, consent must additionally be obtained from the subject.
6) Revise the informed consent whenever important new information becomes available that is 
relevant to the subject's consent. The investigator, or a person designated by [CONTACT_093], 
should fully i nform the subj ect or the subject's leg ally acceptable representative or legal 
guardian, of all pertinent aspects of the study and of any new information relevant to the 
subject's willingness to continue participation in the study. This communication should be 
documented. 
The confidentiality of records that could identify subjects must be protected, respecting the privacy 
and confidentiality rules applicable to regulatory  requirements, the subject s' signed ICF and, in the 
US, the subjects’ signed HIPAA Authorization.
The consent form must also include a statement that BMS and regulatory authorities have direct 
access to subject records. 
Subjects unable to give their written consent (eg, stroke or subjects with or severe dementia) may 
only be enrolled in the study with the consent of a legally acceptable representative. The subject 
must also be informed about the nature of th e study to the extent compatible with his or her 
understanding, and should this subject become capable, he or she should personally sign and date 
the consent form as soon as possible. The exp licit wish of a s ubject who is unable to give his or 
her written consent, but who is  capable of forming an opi[INVESTIGATOR_120975], or to be withdrawn from, the clinical study at any time s hould be considered by 
[CONTACT_093].
The rights, safety, and well-being of the study s ubjects are the most important considerations and 
should prevail over interests of science and society.

3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
3.1 Study Design and Duration
This is an open-label, multi-site Phase 2 study  of nivolumab combined with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_212663] s ubjects with melanoma metastatic to the brain. 
Per Amendment 02 (August 2106), both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients are eligible for  
enrollment as described below:
Cohort A (asymptomatic ) Patients with histologically confirmed metas tatic melanoma  
presenting with intracranial metastases and at least 1 measurable index intracranial metastasis 
≥0.5 cm and ≤3 cm in diameter that has not been previ ously irradiated. No clinical requirement  
for local intervention (surgery, radiosurgery, cortic osteroid therapy) or other systemic therapy.  
Approximate enrollment in Cohort A is 90 patients.
Cohort B (symptomatic) : Patients with histologically confirmed metastatic melanoma presenting  
with symptomatic intracranial metastases who may be on steroids with doses no higher than a total  
daily dose of [ADDRESS_255032] 1 measurable index intracranial metastasis  
≥0.5 cm and ≤[ADDRESS_255033] not require  
immediate local therapy (SRT or surgery within [ADDRESS_255034] treatment), have a  
performance status 0-2, and no experience of seizure within [ADDRESS_255035] received prior treatment with  BRAF inhibitors and/or MEK inhibitors, and  
subjects who have been treated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_212664] a re eligible for the study.
All patients will be tr eated with the combination regimen of nivolumab 1 mg/kg combined with  
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg Q3W (4 doses), followed by [CONTACT_53930] (3 mg/kg Q2W) for a  
maximum of 24 months, or until disease progre ssion or unacceptable toxicity. The use of SRT
(single epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]) for disease progression for ≤ 3 intracranial lesions is permitted. ( Section [IP_ADDRESS] )
Recommended intervals between treatment with study drug and use of SRT, dose delay after SRT,  
allowable steroid use ( ≤ 16 mg dexamethasone PO QD), and tapered over no more than 4 weeks),
and observation of patients post SRT when tr eatment is resumed are also specified in Section
[IP_ADDRESS]. Any subject who meets criteria for discont inuation following SRT ( Section 4.5.5 ) will 
proceed to follow-up for safety, progression, and overall survival after discontinuation of study  
medication based on the assessment schedules presented in Section 5 . NOTE: To continue on-
study after SRT, at least [ADDRESS_255036] completes 3 years of follow up from 
Revised Protocol No: 03
Date: 13-Nov-[ADDRESS_255037] treatment or the study is discontinued by [CONTACT_1034]. The study design is presented
in Figure 3.1-1 :

Additional imaging may be performed for patient care at the discretion of the investigator. All 
efficacy objectives will be based on Investigator assessment at the study site. 
All radiologic imaging from this study will be transmitted to a centralized imaging core laboratory 
for storage and analysis. Sites will be informed of quality issues or the need for repeat scanning 
via queries from the core lab. The details of the independent review performed by [CONTACT_212678] (IRRC) are outlined in a separate CA209204 Imaging Review 
Charter.
Safety will be evaluated for all tr eated subjects using the NCI CTCA E version 4.0. Safety 
assessments will be based on medical review of AE reports, vital sign measurement results, 
physical examinations, and clinical laboratory tests . In addition, a designated Steering Committee
composed of a core group of study investigators who are experts in treating patients with 
melanoma intracranial metastases and sponsor physicians/ staff will evaluate safety and efficacy 
throughout the trial as described in Section 7.
 
 
Safety and Tolerability Assessment Evaluation of Risk/Benefit 
An interim analysis was conducted when 20 subjects completed i nduction or discontinued 
treatment for any reason. At the completion of th e interim analysis by [CONTACT_181127], the 
combination was determined to be safe in patients with asymptomatic untreated melanoma 
intracranial metastases. Per Amendment 02 (August 2016), the patient population will be expanded 
to include C ohort B, which will enroll a pproximately 20 patients with symptomatic intracranial
metastases who may be on steroids provided ther e is no immediate need for SRT or surgery (within 
[ADDRESS_255038] treatment. Patients who are symptomatic and are not being treated with steroids for CNS 
symptoms are elig ible for enrollment.
In the event unfavorable safety/tolerability event occurs in the interim analyses, the Steering 
Committee and the Sponsor will review the available d ata. Upon review of the risk/benefit profile,
the Sponsor and the Steering Committee will recommend continuation, modification, or 
termination of the study. 
The most frequent severe drug related AEs for the combination of nivolumab and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_212665] (eg, laboratory testing of liver function tests 
(LFT) and lipase levels) and preliminary evidence s hows deep and durable responses in advanced 
melanoma (CA209004) despi[INVESTIGATOR_212666]. In particular, any assessment of the risk/benefit will 
be examined if the following criteria are met:
•A majority of subjects have at least stable disease or a partial tumor response

BMS-936558 nivolumab
•All treatment-r elated AEs leading to discontinuation are non-fatal, reversible, and without 
severe sequelae 
•A majority of the treatment related AEs are laboratory in nature, asymptomatic, and 
monitorable by [CONTACT_212679].
If a decision is made to continue because of a fa vorable risk/benefit profile (ie, non-fatal AEs in 
subjects with at least stable disease or a partial tumor response) and despi[INVESTIGATOR_212667] ‘not tolerable’ criteria, the EC/IRBs must be notified, Informed Consent forms updated 
if necessary to add new information, and discussion of  the risk/benefit, if determined to be different 
than at the outset of the study, must be documented with all current and future subjects who are 
enrolled into the study. 
3.1.1 Screening Phase
•Screening begins by [CONTACT_52225]’s initial eligibility and signing of the ICF.
•Subject is enrolled using the IRT. Subjects will be enrolled into either Cohort A

Cohort A and become symptomatic during the screening evaluations may be considered for 
enrollment into  Cohort B if they meet all other cr iteria for Cohort B. No crossover between 
cohorts is permitted after the start of treatment.
•Subject is assessed for study eligibility as described in Section 3.3.1 and Section 3.3.2 .
•Pre-treatment t umor tissue i s required from all patients and s hould be from an excisional, 
incisional, (preferred) , punch, or core needle biopsy. Tissue representing an extracranial 
metastasis collected after prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_212668], but archival primary or metastatic tumor 
tissue specimens are acceptable. A tumor tissue block or minimum of 15 slides should be 
submitted.
3.1.2 Treatment Phase

Table 5.1-3 (Cycles 3 and beyond). 
•Adverse event assessments should be documented at each clinic visit. 
•Outcomes Research Assessment (Healthcare Resources Utilization (HCRU) will be conducted 
prior to Cycle 1 dosing and at the time of progression.
•Exploratory Biomarker Testing will be conducted according to Table [IP_ADDRESS]-1 .
•All enrolled participants will be treated with nivolumab IV ove r 60 minutes ± 10 minutes at 1 
mg/kg combined with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_114526] 90 minutes ± 10 minutes at 3 mg/kg 
every 3 weeks for a total of 4 doses of the combination therapy followed by [CONTACT_212680] 60 minutes ± 10 minutes at 3mg/kg every 2 weeks for a maximum of 24 
months or until progression or unacceptable toxicity.

•The treatment phase ends when the subject is discontinued from study therapy. For a complete 
list of reasons for treatment discontinuation see Section 3.5 .
3.1.3 Follow-Up Phase
•Begins when the decision to discontinue a subject from treatment is made (no further treatment 
with study therapy).
•After completion of the first two follow-up visits, subjects will be followed every 3 months for 
survival.
•Follow-up assessments are to be collected as outlined in Table 5.1-4 .
•Subjects who discontinue treatment for reasons other than tumor progression will continue to 
have tumor assessments beginning 6 weeks ( ±7 days) from the first dose of study drug for the 
first 12 months, and every 12 weeks ( ±7 days) thereafter until documented tumor progression.
•Subjects will be followed for drug-related toxicities until these toxicities resolve, return to 
baseline or are deemed irreversible. All advers e events will be documented for a minimum of 
[ADDRESS_255040] Study Access to Study Drug
At the end of the study, BMS will not continue to provide BMS s upplied study drug to 
subjects/investigators unless BMS chooses to exte nd the study. The investigator should ensure that

5.3.1 Medical History, Physical Exam, Physical Measurements 
At baseline, a medical history w ill be ob tained to capture relevant underlying conditions. The 
baseline examinations  should include weight, height, ECOG Pe rformance Status, blood pressure 
(BP), heart rate (HR), temperature, and oxygen satura tion by [CONTACT_61871] (also monitor 
amount of supplemental o xygen if applicable) should be performed within [ADDRESS_255088] dose and are to

serum urea level, creatinine, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Cl, Gl ucose, amylase, lipase, TSH, Free T4, Free T3, 
Hep B/C (HBV sAG, HCV antibody, or HCV RNA).
While on-study and during follow-up, local laborat ory assessments are to be conducted as 
specified on Table 5.1-2 to Table 5.1-4 . Thyroid function testing is to be done every 6 weeks (every 
3 cycles) for subjects receiving nivolumab.
Subjects will be evalu ated for safety if they have received  any study drug. Toxicity asse ssments 
will be continuous during the treatment phase. Duri ng study tr eatment and nivolumab Follow-Up 
Visits 1 and 2, toxicity assessments should be done in person. Once subjects reach the survival 
follow-up, either in-person visits or documented telephone calls/email correspondence to assess 
the subject’s status are acceptable.
Revised Protocol No: 03
Date: 13-Nov-[ADDRESS_255089] (also monitor amount of supplemental oxygen if  
applicable) should be assessed at each on-study visit prior to dosing. The start and stop time of the  
study therapy infusions should be documented. 
Physical examinations are to be  performed as specified in Section 5.[ADDRESS_255090] exam, report changes  
on the appropriate non-serious or serious adverse event page.
On treatment local laboratory assessments are to be completed within 72 hours prior to dosing.
Additional measures, including non-study required laboratory tests, should be performed as  
clinically ind icated or to comply with local regulations. Laboratory toxicities (eg, suspected drug  
induced liver enzyme evaluations) will be monitored during the follow-up phase via on si te/local  
labs until all study drug related toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed irreversible.
If a subject shows changes on pulse oximetry or other pulmonary-related signs (hypoxia, fever) or  
symptoms (eg. dyspnea, cough, fever) consistent with possible pulmona ry-related signs (hypoxia,  
fever) or symptoms (eg, dyspnea, cough, fever) consis tent with possible pulmonary adverse events,  
the subject should be immediately ev aluated to rule out pulmonary toxicity, according to the  
suspected pulmonary toxicity management al gorithm in the BMS- 936558 (nivolumab) IB.
Some of the assessments referred to in this section may not be captured as data in the eCRF. They  
are intended to be used as safety monitoring by [CONTACT_1963]. Additional testing or  
assessments may be performed as clinically necessary or where required by [CONTACT_212688].

for brain lesions (Appendix 3 ).
Radiographic images will be collected and sent to a centralized imaging core laboratory for storage 
and potential future central reading.
All radiologic imaging from this study will be assessed at the study site by [CONTACT_737]. Sites 
will be trained in image acquisition par ameters, image analyses, and submission process, prior to 
scanning the first study sub ject. These guidelines w ill be outlined in a separate CA209204 Site 
Imaging Manual. 
For extracranial disease assessment, contrast-e nhanced computed tomography (CT) scans acquired 
on dedicated CT equipment is preferred for this study. CT with contrast of the chest, abdomen and 
pelvis and other areas of disease are to be performed for tumor assessments per Table 5.1-[ADDRESS_255099] enhanced MRI of the abdomen and pelvis may be obtained. MRI’s should be 
acquired with slice thickness of < 5 mm with no gap (contiguous). 
Use of CT component of a PET/CT scanner: Combined mod ality scanning such as with FDG-
PET/CT is increasingly used in clinical care, and is a mod ality/technology that is in rapid 
evolution; therefore, the recommendations outlined he re may change rather quickly with time. At 
present, low dose or attenuation correction CT por tions of a combined FDG-PET/CT are of limited 
use in anatomically based efficacy assessments and it is therefore suggest ed that they should not 
be substituted for dedicated di agnostic contrast enhanced CT scans for anatomically based 
RECIST measurements. However, if a site can document that the CT performed as part of a FDG-
PET/CT is of ident ical dia gnostic qu ality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast) then the 
CT portion of the FDG-PET/CT can be used fo r RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_255100] introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is 
not routinely or serially performed.
MRI scans: Bi-dimensional and three-d imensional contrast enhanced MRI of the brain will be 
acquired per the CA209204 Imaging Manual re quirements. Every a ttempt s hould be made to 
image each subject using an identical acquisition protocol on the same scanner for all imaging time 
points. Cases of suspected radiologic disease progression will be confirmed by [CONTACT_212691] 4 weeks after the initial radiological assessment of progression.
5.4.1 Computed Tomography Imaging (CT)
Baseline CT assessments s hould be performed within [ADDRESS_255101] assessments should occur at +/- [ADDRESS_255102] asse ssments. Subjects will be evaluated for tumor response 
every 6 weeks for Year 1 and every 12 weeks thereafter until progression or discontinuation, 
whichever is later.

5.4.3 Confirmation of Scans
Verification of Response: Confirmation of intracranial response will be confirmed by [CONTACT_212692] 4 weeks after the initial radiological assessment. If repeat scans confirm 
overall response (OR), then response should be declared using the date of the initial scan. If repeat 
scans do not confirm OR, then the subject is considered not to have had an OR. 
Verification of Progression: Progression of disease s hould be verified in cases where progression 
is equivocal and will be  confirmed by [CONTACT_212693] [ADDRESS_255104] progressive disease.

medical event. (See Section 6.6 for the definition of potential DILI.)
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study drug  
is an SAE. 
Although pregna ncy, overdose, cancer, and potential dr ug induced liver in jury (DILI) are not  
always serious by [CONTACT_8661], these ev ents must be handled as SAEs. (See Sectio n 6.1.1

Revised Protocol No: 03
Date: 13-Nov-[ADDRESS_255108] be collected that occur during the screening period and within 100 days of discontinuation of 
dosing.
The investigator should report any SAE that occurs after these time periods and that is believed to 
be related to study drug or protocol-specified procedure. 
An SAE report should be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness. 
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study drug, but is potentially related to the 
conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy or a complication of a study 
procedure), the relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.
SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS (or 
designee) within [ADDRESS_255109] be recorded on the SAE Report Form; pregnancies on a 
Pregnancy Surveillance Form (electronic or paper forms). The preferred method for SAE data 
reporting collection is through the eCRF.  The paper SAE/pregnancy surveillance forms are only 
intended as a back-up option when the eCRF system is not functioning.  In this case, the paper 
forms are to be transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile (fax) transmission to:
SAE Email Address: [EMAIL_176]
SAE Facsimile Number:  See Contact [CONTACT_20491].
For studies capturing SAEs through electronic data cap ture (EDC), electronic submission is the 
required method for reporting. The paper forms should be used and submitted immediately, only 
in the event the electronic system is unavailable for transmission. When paper forms are used, the 
original paper forms are to remain on site.
SAE Telephone Contact (required for SAE and pregnancy reporting): Refer to Contact 
[CONTACT_20491].
If only limited information is initially available, follow-up reports are required. (Note: Follow-up 
SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to st udy drug or if ne w information 
becomes available, a follow-up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours to the BMS (or 
designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report. 
All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization.

The collection of nonserious AE information should begin at initiation of study drug. Nonserious 
AE information should also be collected from the start of a placebo lead-in period or other 
observational period intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects.

page or SAE Report Form (paper or electronic) as appropriate:
•Any laboratory test result that is clinically  significant or meets the definition of an SAE 
•Any laboratory test result abnormality that require d the subject to have study drug discontinued  
or interrupted
•Any laboratory test result abnormality that required the subject to r eceive specific corrective  
therapy.

[IP_ADDRESS] Best Overall Response (BOR) per Subject 
The best overall response is determined once all the data for the subject is known. It is defined as  
the best response designation, as determined by [CONTACT_093], recorded between the date of first  
dose of study drug and the date of objectively doc umented progression or the date of subsequent  
therapy, whichever occurs first. For subjects without documented progression or subsequent  
therapy, all available response designations will contribute to the BOR assessment.

In this study, BOR is specified for the intracranial, extracranial, and global compartments based 
on the (1) modified RECIST 1.1 criteria (intracran ial), (2) RECIST 1.1 criteria (extracranial), (3) 
combination of modified RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_255116] 1.1 criteria (global). Image assessment 
criteria (modified RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_255117] 1.1) are presented in Appendix 3.
For the assessment of BOR, all available assessments per subject are considered. 
The best overall response for each patient is d etermined from the sequence of overall (lesion) 
responses according to the following rules, listed in order of priority:
•CR = At least two determinations of CR at least 4 weeks apart before progression.
•PR = At least two determinations of PR or better at least 4 weeks apart before progression 
(and not qualifying for a CR).
•SD = At least one SD assessment ≥6 months after start of treatment.
•PD = At least two determinations of PD at l east 4 weeks apart after start of treatment (and 
not qualifying for CR, PR or SD).
The BOR for each patient will also be determined by [CONTACT_212695]209204 
Imaging Review Charter.
[IP_ADDRESS] Overall Survival
Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of the start of treatment until the date of 
death. For those subjects who have not died, OS will be censored at the rec orded last date of subject 
contact, and subjects with a missing recorded last date of contact [CONTACT_212696].

Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as th e time between the date of first dose of study drug
and the first date of documented confirmed progressi on, as determined by [CONTACT_093], or death 
due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Subjects who die without a reported progression will be 
considered to have progressed on the date of their death. Subjects who did not progress or die will 
be censored on the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment. Sub jects who did not have any 
on study tumor assessments and did not die will be censored on the date of first dose of study drug. 
Subjects who started anti-cancer therapy without a prior reported progression will be censored on 
the date of their last evaluable tumor assessment prior to the initiation of subsequent anti-cancer 
therapy.
Overall response r ate (ORR) is defined as the number of subjects who achieve a best overall 
response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) divided by [CONTACT_212698]. The best overall response is defined as the best response designation recorded between

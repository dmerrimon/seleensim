Abstract  
 
Background: Available therapeutic options for idiopathic fecal incontinence (FI) are limited 
and unsatisfactory .  There are no controlled studies documenting the efficacy of medications 
used to treat FI .  We observed that oral clonidine significantly reduced  diarrhea in patients 
with urge FI; while clonidine reduced the frequency of FI, effects were not statistically significant .  Small u ncontrolled studies suggest that the bile acid binding resin colesevelam  
also improves functional diarrhea.  However, there are no controlled studies that have investigated the effect of colesevelam  in FI.  In this placebo controlled study, we plan to 
investigate the effects of combining colesevelam  with clonidine on symptoms in women with 
FI.  The primary aim  of our study is  to investigate the hypotheses  that compared to placebo, 
colesevelam  and clonidine will reduce the frequency of FI  and rectal urgency .  Additionally, 
we will also investigate the stool and mucosa associated microbiota in these patients at baseline and after treatment .  The role of microbiota in pathogenesis of FI is unknown and 
we hope this study will offer us valuable insight into this question.  Sixty women  (18-80 y) 
with symptoms of urge or combined (i.e. urge and passive)  FI will be recruited to this study 
and treated with a combination of colesevelam and clonidine or placebo for [ADDRESS_1029983] 5 0% reduction in the 
frequency of F I (number of FI epi[INVESTIGATOR_752093] ) at the end of 4 weeks of treatment.

A. Specific Aims  
Fecal incontinence (FI) is a common symptom that can significantly impair quality of life.  [ADDRESS_1029984] significantly 
decreased the proportion of loose stools in patients with urge or combined FI who also had diarrhea.  While clonidine reduced the frequency of FI, effects were not statistically 
significant.  A  retrospective analysis of patients with bile acid malabsorption (BAM) observ ed 
that colesevelam, a bile acid binding resin improved subjective symptoms of FI in more than 70% patients.
[ADDRESS_1029985] not been compared.  
The central hypothesis  of this study is that a combination treatment with clonidine 
and colesevelam is better than placebo in reducing stool frequency and rectal urgency in FI .  
Additional hypotheses are that FI is associated with (i) BAM , (ii) alterations in the fecal and 
colonic mucosal microbiota , which are modified by [CONTACT_752108] (iii) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of selected genes.  
 In order to investigate these hypotheses we propose five aims  as follows:   
Aim 1: Compare the effects of combination treatment with colesevelam and clonidine vs. 
placebo on bowel symptoms  in FI  
Aim 2: Investigate the prevalence of BAM in patients with FI  
Aim 3: Evaluate the fecal and colonic mucosal microbiota in patients with FI and the effects of treatment with colesevelam and clonidine  
Aim 4: Compare the colonic mucosal microbiota obtained wit h mucosal biopsies during a 
flexible sigmoidoscopy and an rectal  catheter  in FI  
Aim 5: Investigate SNPs associated with FI through microarray analysis of genomic DNA obtained at baseline.

 Background and Significance  
 Fecal incontinence, the involuntary leakage of stool from the anus, is a common 
symptom not only in nursing home residents, but also in the community .  8  Our observations 
(2800 women) from Olmsted County demonstrate that  one of 10 adult women and one of five 
women aged ≥  [ADDRESS_1029986] moderate to severe FI.   
 There is very limited, mostly uncontrolled, evidence to support the approaches 
currently used to manage FI .  9-11  Based on observations of responsiveness to placebo in 
controlled clinical trials, conservative measures (e.g., dietary modification, behavioral measures to suppress rectal sensation and not  including biofeedback therapy ) improved  
symptoms in approximately 25% of patients .  
12  Amitriptyline and loperamide improved 
diarrhea and rectal urgency in uncontrolled studies .  13-15  However, the use of these agents 
Title of Study: Colesevelam for Fecal incontinence       3 of 16 
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_557464] E . Bharucha  
is often limited by [CONTACT_49060].  Biofeedback therapy is better than pelvic  floor exercises 
alone in patients who do not respond to conservative measures.16  In the only controlled 
clinical trial of medical therapy for FI, the effects of oral clonidine (0.1 mg twice daily) for 4 
weeks on symptoms were not significantly different versus placebo in all comers with FI .  
However, clonidine significantly decreased the proportion of loose stools in FI patients with 
diarrhea.  Among patients with diarrhea, clonidine decreased the proportion of days with FI; 
however results were not statistically significant .[ADDRESS_1029987] bowel disturbances (i.e., irritable bowel syndrome 
[IBS]) , it is important to understand the contribution of peripheral dysfunctions (e.g., BAM, 
altered colonic microbiota), which are observed in IBS, to FI. For example, while several small studies observed differences in the microbiota in feces  between health and irritable 
bowel syndrome,
[ADDRESS_1029988] evaluated t he fecal 
and colonic mucosal   microbiota in FI.  Currently , the mucosal microbiome is evaluated by 
[CONTACT_752109] .  It may be possible to assess the 
mucosal microbiota with an rectal  catheter , which  is a noninvasive technique.  Hence, we 
propose to compare the fecal and colonic mucosal microbiota obtained with flexible 
sigmoidoscopy and an rectal  catheter  in patients with FI .  
In the community, the prevalence of FI in men is similar to that in women (8.9% and 
7.7% respectively).[ADDRESS_1029989], the 3 main risk factors for FI in men are: 
proctitis secondary to radiotherapy for prostate cancer, a rectal evacuation disorder, and iatrogenic anal sphincter injury ( e.g., due to surgery).  Hence, t he pathophysiology of FI is 
differs betw een men and women.  Therefore, and to ensure a more homogenous composition 
of the patient group, this study is limited to women.

Title of Study: Colesevelam for Fecal incontinence       4 of 16 
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_557464] E . Bharucha  
1. Overall e xperimental design .   
This study will consist of four phases (Figure 1) 
1. Phase 1 (Initial 
screening)  
Patients who 
consent to participate in the study will visit with the investigator during which a physical examination may be performed.  During this visit they will be asked to compl ete 
questionnaires designed to determine whether or not they have FI, the type of FI, screen for anxiety or depression and assess quality of life at baseline.  Those who have diarrhea but not FI as assessed by 
[CONTACT_364346] (i.e. Bristol stool type 6 or 7, or >3 bowel movements/day on average) will be excluded from the study.   Eligible patients who give consent will undergo 
a urine pregnancy test, a 12 lead EKG, anorectal manometry (if not done at Mayo Clinic in the last 6 months), spot stool sample for microbiota analysis, blood draw for genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], assessment of the a rectal mucosal microbiota with a rectal catheter, and an optional flexible sigmoidoscopy.  Patients will be asked to record their dietary intake for [ADDRESS_1029990] a 
flexible sigmoidoscopy, the mucosal microbiota will be compared on mucosal samples and a rectal catheter .  In an attempt at (i) avoiding situations where we recognize subjects are 
not eligible to participate when they present at the screening visit and (ii) reduce the time taken for screening visits, we propose, when feasible, to ask participants to complete the questionnaires and a 2 week bowel diary before they come for their screening visit.  Subjects 
will return these questionnaires to us by [CONTACT_752110].  If subjects are not subsequently consented/enrolled into the study, these items will be destroyed.  [This bowel 
diary is identical to that approved for use later in the study.]  
  
2. Phase 2 (Completion of bowel diaries)  
Patients, who have FI, as documented by [CONTACT_752111] 1, are not 
pregnant, and do not have EKG exclusion criteria documented below will enter phase 2.  During this phase, patients will fill out daily bowel diaries to ascertain if they have FI sympt oms of sufficient severity.  The duration of this phase is variable and ranges from 2- [ADDRESS_1029991] 
weekly review of the bowel diaries starting at week 2 i.e., (i) compl etion of at least 5 out of 7 
days of the diary in the preceding week and 10 out of 14 in the preceding 2 weeks, (ii) experience at least 1 epi[INVESTIGATOR_752094] 2 weeks, (iii) have a Bristol stool form score ≥ 3, and (iii) an average stool frequency of ≥1/day will enter the treatment phase .  
Patients who have not filled out the minimum number of days of bowel symptoms will be asked to fill out bowel diaries for an additional 2 weeks .  Those who satisfy criteria at the end Figure 1.  Study design  
 

Title of Study: Colesevelam for Fecal incontinence       5 of 16 
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_557464] E . Bharucha  
of the two additional weeks will proceed to Phase 3.  Otherwise their participation in the trial 
will be terminated and they will exit the study.   
 
3. Phase 3 (Treatment Phase)  
Patients who satisfy symptom criteria in Phase 2 will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive either a combination of colesevelam (1.875 gm twice daily) and clonidine (0.1 mg 
oral twice daily) or an identical placebo for [ADDRESS_1029992]. Zinsmeister, will be balanced on age (<50 vs. ≥ 50 y) and BMI (<30 vs. ≥ 30 kg/m2) .  
Patients will fill daily  bowel diaries for the entire duration of the treatment phase and mail 
them in every week.  Patients will be contact[CONTACT_752112] (by [CONTACT_61529]) to assess compliance with medications, with filling bowel diaries and for any adv erse events.  At the 
end of the treatment phase, patients will be asked to fill questionnaires pertaining to their quality of life and satisfaction with treatment.  During the treatment phase, patients will be allowed to use rescue medication in the form of loperamide to circumvent the potential for withdrawal from the study due to overwhelming symptoms.  Patients are allowed to take loperamide (2mg/dose) up to [ADDRESS_1029993] their loperamide 
usage in the bowel diary.

3. S tudy procedures  
a) History and physical examination   a physical examination will not be performed, at the 
discretion of the investigator, when this has been performed in the past [ADDRESS_1029995] will be administered as described previously .  28 The maximum score 
is 30 and a score of less than 21 is suggestive of dementia.  
b) A norectal manometry  will only be performed when this has not been performed in the 
past 6 months at Mayo Clinic.  After rectal cleansing with 1- 2 magnesium citrate 
(Fleets ,C.B. Fleet, Lynchburg, 
VA) enemas, anorectal functio ns 
will be assessed using standard 
and established techniques in our laboratory 
29.  Anal pressures will 
be measured at rest, during squeeze, simulated evacuation, and a Valsalva maneuver  by 
[CONTACT_5019]- resolution manometry .  
Since clinical observations suggest that FI is also associated with a rectal evacuation disorder, rectal balloon expulsion will also 
be assessed.   
c) F
lexible sigmoidoscopy  
will be performed in the Clinical Research Unit  after 1 -2 Fleet’s 
enemas .  This is an optional 
procedure and will be performed in Phase [ADDRESS_1029996] biopsy forceps, 8 mucosal biopsies will be obtained each from the sigmoid colon and 
the rectum.  Eight biopsies will 
provide adequate tissue for microbial DNA extraction.   If any 
abnormality is seen on sigmoidoscopy, additional biopsies will be obtained for histology .  The colonic mucosal

microbiota will be compared to that evaluated with a rectal catheter .  
d) Re ctal catheter .  This test will be done  in all patients either  just prior to anorectal 
manometry or during the initial visit in patients who do not have a manometry .  The Mega 
Brush ® (provided by [CONTACT_752114]., Figure 2) is a mass cytology cell retriever system 
comprised of a foam sphere made of biocompatible material that is used to obtain specimens 
from the anorectum.  It is FDA cleared (FDA K944614/A) for collection of mucosal specimen 
with an endoscope. .  The foam is enclosed in a flexible outer tube and the tip covered by a 
gelatin cap.  The diameter of the foam is [ADDRESS_1029997] vision during the rectal examination. Once the catheter is in the rectum, the capsule will be pushed out into the rectum and the cap allowed to dissolve over about 5 minutes. This will deploy the foam sphere. The foam sphere will be rotated 1- 2 times in the rectum very gently with the help of 
the sheath. The catheter will then be slowly withdrawn.  . 
e) Calculating relative abundance of
  bacterial 16s rRNA to human DNA:  Quantitative PCR 
will be used to assay the quantity of bacterial 16s rRNA in the stool sample.  This will be  
normalized to a single copy human gene ( e.g. TNF -alpha) as described in literature 30.  The 
relative proportion of bacterial to human DNA will be calculated by [CONTACT_752115] a standard curve by [CONTACT_752116] a representative target ( e.g. E.coli  
16s rRNA or human TNF-alpha).  Purified plasmids will be amplified in parallel with patient 
samples and a standard curve generated to assess number of copi[INVESTIGATOR_752096].  
f) F
ecal  and colonic  mucosal microbiome analysis:  Microbial DNA will be extracted from 
stool and tissue samples using standardized methods [18].  Phylotype profiles of the microbiome from colesevelam and placebo treated FI populations will be generated using deep rDNA hypervariable tag sequencing of the hypervariable V3- V5 region of the SSU rRNA gene, 
which has been validated for use with human microbiomes and is one of the methods of choice for the HMP.  With the longer reads from the MiSeq (250x250 paired end reads), our sequencing will include both the V3- V5 RGTs making for a more optimal phylogenetic analysis 
[19].  Phylotype profiles of the mucosa- associated microbiome will be generated using rDNA 
sequencing of the hypervariable V3- V5 region, which has been validated for standard use by 
[CONTACT_752117].  The 500 base pair reads will ensure a better optimal 
phylogenetic identification.  Barcoding samples prior to sequencing will yield approximately 
20,000 reads/sample, ensuring detection of both dominant (core microbiome) and poorly represented taxa (variable microbiome) .  Identifying the existent taxa, diversity, and ecological 
relationships within each sample requires that we process large volumes of 16S DNA sequence data.  In order to accomplish this task we will follow protocols that we have 
quantitatively shown to be optimal .  Reads will be aligned using our own custom multiple 
alignment tool (TORNADO v2.0) that has been optimized the production of taxonomic calls and alignments for downstream analysis such as OTU clustering and phylogeny from paired end reads [20].  Sequences will be culled according to initial quality files using QIIME, pre clustered in order to reduce the number of unique reads due to sequencing errors using mother, and aligned using the new version of the TORNADO pi[INVESTIGATOR_752097].  TORNADO v2.0 will then be used to obtain the taxa calls that will be used in later correlation analysis .  Second, quantitative PCR assays targeting functional genes mcrA and mrtA 
(methanogens) dsrA (sulfate -reducing bacteria) and hydA (hydrogen -producing bacteria) will 
be performed on both stool and mucosal samples following published protocols [21].  Similarly, different sulfate- reducing genera will be quantified with validated 16S primers .  The abundance 
Title of Study: Colesevelam for Fecal incontinence       9 of 16 
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_557464] E . Bharucha  
of functional genes will be correlated to physiological parameters.  Subsequent QPCR assays 
on microbial groups that are significantly distinct in sequencing analyses may also be 
performed.  
 (i) N utritional Assessment : Habitual dietary intake will b e assessed  at baseline using an 
electronic graphical food frequency questionnaire ( FFQ) (Viocare Technologies, Inc. [ADDRESS_1029998], Princeton, NJ [ZIP_CODE]).  This questionnaire is based on the Women's Health Initiative FFQ and has been adapted by [CONTACT_752118] -
administered format to evaluate dietary intake over a three month period.  It employs the Minnesota NDS nutritional analysis database for nutrient analyses .  The FFQ has been 
validated and compares well with nutrient intake validated against food records and four 24-hr dietary recalls ( 29, 30 ).  (ii) Participants will keep food records of their actual dietary 
intake for 72 hours prior to collecting  the stool specimens for microbiome analysis .  The 
food records will be analyzed for energy, protein, fat, carbohydrate and fiber content by [CONTACT_752119] (Version 10.15) developed by [CONTACT_752120], Salem, Oregon [ZIP_CODE]- 1028.    
g)   D
rug therapy  Patients  will be treated with colesevelam (1.875 gm)  and clonidine (0.1 
mg) twice daily or matching placebo for 4 weeks.  Patients  will need to discontinue any 
antidiarrheal  medications  from the start of Phase 1 through end of Phase 3.  Loperamide 
tablets (2 mg) will be provided for rescue when patients experience intolerable diarrhea.  Patients can take up to [ADDRESS_1029999] their loperamide usage during 
the treatment phase.  
h) Genome wide DNA analysis .
   We are currently exploring for SNPs associated with FI 
by [CONTACT_37688][INVESTIGATOR_007] 175 women with FI and 175 age- and gender -matched controls from Olmsted 
County (IRB 22- 01), using a chip with > 500,[ADDRESS_1030000] DNA from 2 0 ml of blood, to be drawn from study participants .  
The tubes will be spun down in the Clinical Research and Trial Unit immediately and the plasma stored at minus 80 degrees celsius .  The buffy coat will be stored at minus 80 degrees 
Celsius until DNA is extracted .  DNA extraction will be conducted at the B AP Lab.  Genome-
wide analysis will be conducted using Illumina 610 QUAD microarray or comparable approaches.  All patients who qualify for the study based on physician assessment in Phase 
1 will undergo genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  Genotype -phenotype correlations will be examined using these 
patients and other patients in ongoing studies.  
i) Analysis of Differential Gene Expression by
  [CONTACT_752121] .  In order to investigate 
if there is any relationship between the global gene expression in a patient and their response 
to treatment  for FI , we will perform RNA Seq analysis with help of the Gene Expression Core 
Facility at Mayo Clinic [COMPANY_002]ster .  We will collect 7.[ADDRESS_1030001] ID  Lab Tube (amount required)

j)  Symptom assessments.    
The following instruments will be used to evaluate symptoms, co -morbid conditions, and 
impact on QOL.  
(i) Fecal Incontinence Severity Index  (FISI)  – which is a validated 4- item scale used to 
assess the frequency of 3 different types of FI .  31 
(ii) Fecal Incontinence Quality of Life (FI -QOL) – is a 30- item validated questionnaire that 
assesses the effects of FI on QOL .  32 
(iii) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_435438] (HAD) Scale 33 
(iv) Health -status questionnaire (Radosevich DM, Wetzler H, Wilson SM. 1994.  Health 
Status Questionnaire (HSQ) 2.0: Scoring Comparisons and Reference Data.  Health 
Outcom es Institute, Bloomington, MN. )  is a self -report inventory designed to measure 
a patient’s overall health and functioning.  
(v)  Fecal incontinence and Constipation Assessment (FICA) Scale – This validated 
instrument, developed in our program, has 4- items (fr equency, type, amount of 
leakage, and presence of urgency) used to rate the severity of FI .  34  It is the only 
instrument that incorporates the amount of leakage, which is an important yardstick of the severity of FI.  
(vi) Satisfaction with treatmen t: In order to determine if patients were satisfied with the 
treatment received, we will use a previously validated visual analog score.  
FICA score will be calculated from the bowel questionnaire.  FISI, HAD, HSQ and Satisfaction 
with treatment score will be calculated from the General Questionnaire that will be administered pre and post -treatment ( Table 1 ).

4. D ata and statistical analysis   
i. Power Statement:   
Based on the observed difference in the frequency  of FI (i.e., mean number of FI epi[INVESTIGATOR_752099]) betw een treatment and placebo groups  in the clonidine study, w e 
estimate that approximately 33 subjects in each treatment group (i.e. colesevelam  and 
Title of Study: Colesevelam for Fecal incontinence       11 of 16 
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_557464] E . Bharucha  
clonidine vs placebo) will provide 80% power, using a two sided alpha level of 0.05, to detect 
at least a  50% difference in the frequency of FI  between treatment groups.17 
ii. D ata Analysis Plan:  
a) Statistical analysis  
An Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) spreadsheet of treatment assignments (balanced on 
age and BMI) will be generated (by [INVESTIGATOR_124].  Zinsmeister) and sent to the research pharmacy.  
Study personnel will be blinded until the study is completed.  
Bowel diaries will be analyzed as follows: S tool frequency , form, urgency and use of rescue 
medications  will be averaged first for each day and then over 1- 2 weeks (two weeks in Phase 
1 and one week in Phase 3) in each subject .   
We will compare response to treatment between colesevelam/clonidine and placebo between for the treatment period using the values during Phase [ADDRESS_1030002] -treatment.  The analyses will use an α value of 0.05 for each comparison.  
Treatment groups will compared using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with the corresponding baseline ( Phase 1) value as the covariate.  Data will be analyzed per intent -
to treat analysis using all subjects randomized.   Missing values will be imputed as described 
previously and an adjustment in the ANCOVA error degrees of freedom will be made.  
Separate ANCOVA models will be used to evaluate whether treatment effects were influenced by [CONTACT_752122].  All tests will be two tailed.  
Endpoints   
   
The primary and secondary endpoints have been well described in our study of  clonidine in FI and will be employed in this study as well
34  
a) Primary endpoint:  
Previously, we have shown that in patients whom the frequency of FI (measured as 
mean number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_752100] ) decreased by [CONTACT_2669] 50%, the 
corresponding FICA severity score exceeded the minimum clinically -important 
difference ( i.e., the smallest change detected by [CONTACT_752123]) in at least 75% of the cases .  This means  that the majority of 
people who report at least 50% improvement in FI frequency have a clinically 
significant improvement .  Hence i n this study, we will use  a 50% reduction in the 
frequency of FI epi[INVESTIGATOR_752101].    
Secondary endpoints:  
The following secondary end points will be compared between placebo and colesevelam groups  
a) Change in the number of days with FI   
b) Volume of FI - this will be graded as small (staining only), moderate (requiring change 
of underwear) or large (requiring change of all clothes) .  We will calculate the 
proportion of FI epi[INVESTIGATOR_752102].  
c) Composition of leaked stools (measured as percentage of all incontinent bowel movements that were type 5- 7 on the Bristol stool scale) - average Bristol stool form 
will be calcula ted from bowel diaries and will be compared before and during 
treatment.  
d) Number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_752103]  
e) Rectal urgency (proportion of total and incontinent bowel movements preceded by [CONTACT_165547])  
f) Proportion of complete bowel movements

Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_557464] E . Bharucha  
g) Time for which a bowel movement can be deferred after occurrence of urgency  
h) Change in Bristol stool form  
i) Change in proportion of FI epi[INVESTIGATOR_752104] (Bristol stool score 5- 7) 
j) Patient reported severity of bowel symptoms as assessed by [CONTACT_8298]  
k) S everity of FI (FISI score)  
l) Impact of FI on quality of life (FI -QOL score)  
m) Impact on symptoms of anxiety and depression (HAD score)  
n) Satisfaction  with treatment measured by [CONTACT_224968]  
o) Proport ion of days where patient used l operamide  
 
For the above end points, we will obtain information either from weekly bowel diaries or questionnaires administered during each of the phases of this study as outlined in Section 2.  
 Using standardized approaches established in our laboratory, mucosal  microbiota profiles 
will be compared between rectal  catheter s and  colonic mucosal biopsies obtained at 
flexible sigmoidoscopy.  
 
iii. Subject Safety.  Only subjects who are eligible based on pre- defined criteria, an 
interview and a physical examination, and screening laboratory tests will be enrolled.  The consent form details issues related to privacy, withdrawal from studies, and use of blood for genetic analyses among other items .  The eligibility criteria are structured 
to exclude patients who have a greater risk of side effects with clonidine.  Interventions (clonidine, colesevelam and anorectal tests) pose a low risk to participants.  In our previous study, clonidine was well tolerated by [CONTACT_752124]; dry mouth was the only side effect that occurred more frequently with clonidine than placebo .  
[ADDRESS_1030003] a co- worker page 911.  Study 
procedures are conducted by [CONTACT_557493] .  Monitoring for side 
effects will be performed by [CONTACT_24355] .  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_557468] .  
Each study is reviewed and analyzed; study discussions and communications are generally by e- mail and stored.   
iv. Data Integrity .  Only subjects who are eligible based on pre- defined criteria, an 
interview and a physical examination will be enrolled.  Transcription of data is accurate and complete.  Calculations will be standardized and accurate.  The study technician 
will monitor data after every study .  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_557471] [ADDRESS_1030004] Accountability .  Research Pharmacy will obtain and dispense medication.  
Unused medication will be collected from subjects at the end of the study and destroyed.

viii. Study Documentation.  Documentation will be per established guidelines during the 
study (hard copy and electronic data capture).  These files will be sampled annually.  
ix. Study Coordination .  Quarterly debriefing will be conducted to ensure expectations 
are clear and if educational needs exist.  
 
D.  Human Subjects   
Only subjects who satisfy stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria and provide written 
informed consent will be included in the protocol.  The consent form details issues related to privacy, withdrawal from studies, and use of blood for genetic analyses among other items.  Additional details as follows:  
1. Anorectal assessments are extremely safe; discomfort, if any during rectal distention is 
mild and tolerable and the risk of rectal perforation in an uninflamed rectum is negligible.   
2. Clonidine  is generally well tolerated at this dose.  In a recent study, we observed that the 
most common side effect with clonidine was dry mouth (about 70% vs. 4.5% in placebo) .  
Other adverse effects included drowsiness (23% vs 14% in placebo), light headedness (27% vs.9% in placebo) and fatigue (36% vs. 23% in placebo)  although they did not reach 
statistical significance .  
[ADDRESS_1030005] commonly reported side 
effects from Colesevelam are constipation, diarrhea, dyspepsia, hypoglycemia (mild and well tolerated), headache, abdominal cramps, nausea, and flatulence and back pain.  Their frequency ranges from 8% -40% in different studies .  
35-[ADDRESS_1030006] will be checked before beginning clonidine or col esevelam .   
 Patients who cannot tolerate clonidine 0.1 mg bid will be switched to 0.1 mg once daily 
(qhs)  Clonidine will be discontinued if: - 
(i) Subjects have syncope, or lethargy that interferes with safe performance of the volunteer’s activities of daily living; or  
(ii) if the systolic blood pressure drops to < 90 mmHg for patients with a systolic BP between 90 and 130 mmHg, or if systolic BP falls to < 100 mmHg for subjects with a pre-treatment systolic BP > 130 mmHg; or  
(iii) if a subject becomes pregnant during the study.   Patients who cannot tolerate three tablets of [ADDRESS_1030007] becomes pregnant during the study.  
Data Safety and Monitoring Plan.  The DSMP utilized will adhere to the protocol approved by [CONTACT_68275] .  We propose the following plan: - 
Data quality and management : T
 he principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_752105] a thr ee-monthly basis for completeness and accuracy of the data as well as 
protocol compliance.  
Adverse events grading: The  common grading scale listed below will be used to grade AEs:  
0 No adverse event or within normal limits or not clinical significant  
1 Mild AE, did not require treatment  
2 Moderate AE, resolved with treatment  
3 Severe AE, resulted in inability to carry on normal activities and required professional medical attention

Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_557464] E . Bharucha  
4 Life threatening or disabling AE  
5 Fatal AE  
Attribution s c ale: An adverse event includes both, an expected side effect that is of a 
serious nature, or an unexpected side effect/ event regardless of severity .  All events will be 
graded as to their attribution (unrelated to protocol, or possibly, probably, or defi nitely 
related to protocol) .  Any event that is reported to either the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_752106].  
Data M onitoring.  The majority of data generated from these protocols will be from analyses performed in our laboratory or the immunochemical core laboratory .  Standard 
quality control procedures are in place for each assay.  The frequency of data review for this study differs according to the type of data and can be summarized in the following table:  
 
Data type  Frequency of 
review  
Subject accrual (adherence to protocol regarding 
demographics, inclusion/exclusion)  Weekly  
Adverse event/safety rates (injuries)  Weekly  
Annual report  Yearly for IRB  
 4.  DNA and RNA analyses.   DNA , RNA  and plasma samples will be anonymized before 
being submitted to the genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_752107].  Specific information is provided in the 
consent form regarding storage and future use of the biologic sample.  These results will not 
be added to the written record.           E. R ef

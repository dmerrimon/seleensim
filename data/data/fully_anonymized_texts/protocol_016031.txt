Exploratory endpoint:  
 To evaluate MRD: defined as the proportion of patients who are MRD positive 
versus those who are MRD negative.  
 
All efficacy analyses will be performed using the response evaluation  population.  The 
IFR will be computed and presented together with the exact 90% confidence interval (CI) 
using the method of Clopper and Pearson.  The null hypothesis of 65% IFR will be 
rejected if at least [ADDRESS_69750] 90% Clopper and Pearson CIs.  
 
The Kaplan -Meier product limit method will be used to estimate PFS and OS.  Median 
values and rates at clinically relevant time points will be provided w ith the 90% CIs.  A 
Cox Proportional Hazards Model may also be utilized to estimate the effects of patient 
baseline characteristics or known prognostic factors on PFS and OS.

1.1 Background  
Multiple mye loma (MM) , a B-cell tumor of malignant plasma cells within the bone marrow,  is 
characterized by [CONTACT_64353] (and other organs) and 
commonly results in anemia, bone marrow failure, bone  destruction, hypercalcemia,  renal 
failure , and increased susceptibility to infections .  The disease accounts for approximately 1 .4% 
of all new cancer cases  in the [LOCATION_002] (US) and approximately 13% of hematologic cancers 
worldwide ( Palumbo and Anderson 2011 ).  There are approximately 24 ,000 new cases of MM 
diagnosed in the US  each year with over 11 ,000 deaths annually due to the disease  (Howlader et 
al 2014 ). 
1.[ADDRESS_69764] 2 decades 
with the introduction of more effective treatment options.  Multiple myeloma is sensitive to a 
number of cytotoxic drugs (e.g., alkylating agents and anthracyclines) and cor ticosteroids that 
are commonly used for initial treatment and for relapsed disease.  Younger patients are 
consolidated with high -dose therapy (ablative chemotherapy or radiation) with autologous stem 
cell transplantation (ASCT).  In addition, the introduct ion of novel agents such as proteasome 
inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) has revolutionized treatment and improved 
survival rates for this disease.  
Current treatments include combination chemotherapy with regimens using melphalan 
(Alkeran®), bo rtezomib (Velcade®), thalidomide (Thalomid®), lenalidomide (Revlimid®) , 
elotuzumab (EMPLICITI™), and their combinations with and without corticosteroids.  Altho ugh 
improvements in progression -free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) have occurred in t he 
past 5 years, even with the bes t available approved agents, 10%  to 30% of patients fail to 
respond to the primary therapy, and almost all patient s eventually relapse, with a median OS  of 
44.8 months  (Kumar et al 2008 ). 
1.3 Elotuzumab  
On 30 November 2015, the U .S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved elotuzumab 
(EMPLICITI, Bristol -Myers Squibb Company) in combination with lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with MM who have received 1  to 3 prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].   
The full package insert can be viewed at:

Elotuzumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the SLAMF7 
(Signaling Lymphocytic Acti vation Molecule Family member 7) protein.  SLAMF7 is expressed 
on myeloma cells independent of cytogenetic abnormalities, and is also expressed on natural 
killer cells, plasma cells, and at lower levels on specific immune cell subsets of differentiated 
cells within the hematopoietic lineage.

AMENDMENT 2 DATE:  [ADDRESS_69765] and Fc 
receptors.  Elotuzumab also targets SLAMF7 on myeloma cells and facilitates the interaction 
with natural killer cells to mediate the killing of myeloma cells through antibody -dependent 
cellular cytotoxicity.  In preclinical models, the combination of elotuzumab and lenalidomide 
resulted in enhanced activation of natural killer cells that was greater than the effects of either 
agent alone and increased anti -tumor activity in vitro  and in vivo . 
1.3.1 Summary of non -clinical e xperience  
The expression of the elotuzumab target, SLAMF7, is restricted to malignant myeloma cells  and 
subsets of normal leukocytes in humans ( natural killer , natural k iller-like T cells, a subset of 
CD8+  T cells, and tissue plasma cells).  No significant expression was detected in resting CD4+  
T cells, B cells, resting monocytes, neutrophils, and granulocytes.   Elotuzumab binding was  not 
observed on epi[INVESTIGATOR_24603], vessels, or smooth muscle cells of any of the organs examined.  
No SLAMF7 expression was noted with immunohistochemical staining in a variety of  normal 
and neoplastic tissues.  Except for infiltrating cells, no SLAMF7 expression was noted  in brain, 
breast, colon, he art, kidney, liver, lung, ovary, pancreas, prostate, skin, small  intestine, spleen, 
stomach, testis, tonsil, uterus, and urinary bladder.  Additionally, no  SLAMF7 expression was 
noted in tumor samples, including ductal breast adenocarcinoma,  lobular breast  adenocarcinoma, 
renal cell carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, endometrial  adenocarcinoma, gastric adenocarcinoma, 
urothelial carcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma,  non-small cell lung carcinoma, ovarian 
carcinoma, testicular germ cell tumor, head and neck  squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma,  and 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( Hsi et al 2008 ). 
Elotuzumab only recognizes human SLAMF7 protein and does not appear to bind SLAMF7  
from other species, including chimpanzee, cynomolgus  monkey, dog, mini pig, mouse,  rabbit, 
rat, and rhesus monkey.  Due to the lack of species -specific cross -reactivity, there are  no relevant 
animal species in which to conduct toxicological studies.  Therefore, the  nonclinical studies 
consisted primarily of  in vitro  safety assessments and selected in vivo  biological activity 
assessment to address the selectivity of elotuzumab and potential  toxicities.  In addition, a 
limited non -Good Laboratory Practice  exploratory  single -dose intravenous (IV) toxicity and 
toxicokinetics study in rhesus monkeys was  conducted and no potential non -target effects were 
identified.  
Elotuzumab (100 and 200 μg/mL) in vitro  had no effect on lymphocytes, CD3, CD4, CD8,  and B 
cell counts in blood samples from healthy human donors.  The natural killer  cell counts were  
decreased on average by 20% at both doses of elotuzumab.   The observed d ecline was  variable 
between donors and ranged between 0% and 45%.  
Elotuzumab , at concentrations up to 500 μg/mL , did not adversely affect the ability of human  
bone marrow -derived hematopoietic stem cells to differentiate down the erythroid and  myeloid 
pathways.  
In nonclinical models, elotuzumab plus either bortezomib or lenalidomide had greater  antitumor 
activity than either agent alone.  In addition, elotuzumab plus mAbs that enhance  natural killer  
cell function either by [CONTACT_64354] a negative regulatory  molecule, KIR2DL3, or by  [CONTACT_64355] (S):  ELOTUZUMAB                  SARAH CANNON DEVELOPMENT INNOVATIONS

AMENDMENT 2 DATE:  [ADDRESS_69766] that, while maximal antitumor  
activity is reached at elotuzumab serum levels of 70 to 430 μg/mL, minimal biological  activity is 
seen at 2 to 13 μg/mL.  In vitro  experiments suggested that the elotuzumab  concentration 
required to achieve saturation of SLAMF7 on PBMCs from healthy donors  was approximately 
20 μg/mL.  
1.3.[ADDRESS_69767] 3 elotuzumab clinical trials were Phase I studies in patients with relapsed MM with 
elotuzumab as monotherapy or combined with bortezomib or lenalidomide.  
Results of the monothe rapy Phase I  trial ( Zonder et al 2012 ) demonstrated acceptable safety with 
no maximum tolerated dose (MTD) identified up to 20 mg/kg.  The most common adverse 
events (AEs), regardless of attribution, were cough, he adache, back pain, fever, and chills.  
Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity, and AEs attributed to elotuzumab 
were primarily infusion -related.  Stable disease was re ported for 27% of the 35 patient s treated.   
Plasma elotuzumab levels and terminal half -life increased with dose whereas clearance 
decreased, suggesting target -mediated clearance.  
Results of the Phase I trial of the combination of elotuzumab with bortezomib/dexamethasone  
demonstrated adequate safety with no MTD observed up t o 20 mg/kg .  Twenty -eight patients  
were tre ated:  each were treated with the 2.5 -, 5.0-, and 10 -mg/kg dose  cohorts , and 19 subjects 
were treated with the 20 -mg/kg  cohort.  Objective responses were obtained in  48% of treated 
patients.  
Results of a  Phase I tr ial of the combination of elotuzumab with lenalidomide/dexamethasone  
demonstrated acceptable safety with no MTD observed up to 20 mg/kg  (Lonial et al 2012 ).  
Twenty -eight  patients were treated:  3 each in the 5.0 - and 10 -mg/kg cohorts, and 22 in the 
20-mg/kg cohort.  No dose -limiting toxicities were observed up to the maximum proposed dose 
of 20 mg/kg.  The most frequent Grade 3 to 4 toxicities were neutropenia (36%) a nd 
thrombocytopenia (21%).  Two  patients experien ced a serious infusion reaction during the first 
treatment cycle.  Objective responses were obtained in 82% (23 of 28) of treated patients.  After 
a median of 16.4 months follow -up, the median time to progression was not reached for patients 
in the 20 -mg/k g cohort who were treated until disease progression.  This  trial also included a 
Phase 2 portion that is ongoing.  Preliminary data from this portion of the trial demonstrated an 
objective response rate  of 84% among all 73 treated patient s, 92% among the 3 6 subjects treated 
with 10 mg/kg of elotuzumab.  Median PFS was 33 months with the 10 mg/kg dose and 
18.6 months with the 20 -mg/kg dose.

Page 23 of 96 In a randomized  portion of a Phase Ib/II trial, the combination of elotuzumab with 
lenalidomide/dexamethasone  was studi ed in patients with relapsed MM who were randomly 
assigned to either 10 -mg/kg (36 patients) or 20 -mg/kg (37 patients) doses of elotuzumab plu s 
oral lenalidomide/dexamethasone  (Richardson et al 2015 ).  Of the 73  patients randomized, 
61 (84%) achieved an objective response (33 [92%] with 10 mg/kg, 28  [76%] with 20 mg/kg); 
31 (42%) a very good partial response (17 [47%] with 10 mg/kg, 14  [38%] with 20 mg/kg); and 
20 (27%) a partial response (10 [28%] with 10 mg/kg, 10 [27%] with 20 mg/kg).  The most 
common treatment -emerg ent AE s of any grade were diarrhea (48  [66%]), muscle spasms 
(45 [62%]), and fatigue (41 [56%]).  Fifty -seven (78%) patients had Grade [ADDRESS_69768] common of which were lymphopenia (15 [21 %]) and neutropenia (14 [19%]).  
In a randomized, open -label Phase III clinical trial , patients with previously treated MM were 
assigned to receive either 10 mg/kg elotuzumab plus lenalidomide/ dexamethasone (elotuzumab 
group) or lenalidomide /dexamethasone alon e (control group ) (Lonial et al 2015 , EMPLICITI ).  
Overall, 321 patients were assigned to the elotuzumab group and 325 to the control group.  After 
a median follow -up of 24 .5 months, the rate of PFS at 1 year in the elotuzumab group was 68%, 
as compared with 57% in the control group; at 2 years, the rates were 41% and 27%, 
respectively.  Median PFS in the elotuzumab group was 19.4 months versus 14.9 months in the 
control gro up (hazard ratio for progression or death in the elotuzumab group, 0.70; 95% 
confidence interval, 0.57 to 0.85; P<0.001).  The overall response rate in the elotuzumab group 
was 79% versus 66% in the control group (P<0.001).  Common Grade 3 or 4 AEs in the 2 groups 
were lymphocytopenia, neutropenia, fatigue, and pneumonia.  Infusion reactions occurred in 
33 patients (10%) in the elotuzumab group, and were Grade 1 or 2 in 29 (88%) patients.  The 
conclusion derived from these results was that patients with rel apsed or refractory MM receiving 
a combination of elotuzumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone had a significant relative 
reduction of 30% in the risk of disease progression or death over those who received 
lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone.  
Precautions and risks  with elotuzumab are presented in Section  8.1.4 . 
1.4 Lenalidomide  and d examethasone  
Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory derivative of thalidomide and has both immunomodulatory 
and anti -angiogenic properties  that are considered to confer anti -tumor effects.   Two pi[INVESTIGATOR_64325] 3  trials established that lenalidomide in combination with high -dose 
dexamethasone produced a significant impr ovement in ORR and time to progression (TTP) versus 
high-dose dex amethasone alone in patients with relapsed MM who had had up to 3 prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
(Dimopoulos et al 2007 , Weber et al 2007 ). 
The combination of l enalidomide and high -dose d exametha sone has shown impressive activity in 
untreated disease.  In a Phase 2 study of 34 patient s with newly diagnosed MM , patient s received 
lenalidomide (25 mg Days 1 to 21 of a 28 -day cycle) and high -dose dexamethasone (40  mg Days 
1 to 4, 9 to 12, and 17 to 20).  The ORR  was 91%, with 6% complete responders  (CR), 32% near 
CR plus very good partial response ( VGPR ), and 53% partial responses ( PR) (Arastu -Kapur et al 
2008 ).  However, when this regimen was compared with a more conventional delivery of 
dexamethasone (40 mg Days 1, 8, 15, and 22) in a 445 -patient  study, the more intensive 
dexamethasone schedule was associated with signif icantly shorter OS  relative to the less 
intensive regimen (1 -year survival rates 86 % vs. 96.5%, respectively)  (Kirk et al 2008 ).  The

AMENDMENT 2 DATE:  [ADDRESS_69769] ing patients’ quality of life.  The  combination of 
10 mg/kg elotuzumab, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone  (ERd) is active , well-tolerated , and 
approved for patients with MM who have had prior treatments , based on data from a large 
randomized  trial of elotuzu mab in combination with lenalidomide  and dexamethasone  in newly 
diagnosed transplant -ineligible patients with MM  (Lonial et al 2015 ).  There are currently no 
studies looking at this combination in the t ransplant -eligible population.  
In this study , we will determine the feasibility o f incorporating ERd into the treatment paradigm 
of transplant -eligible patients with MM.  All patients will undergo [ADDRESS_69770] for 8 more cycles , and then  maintenance with elotuzumab and 
lenalidomide for up to 2 years .  Elotuzumab 10 mg/kg will be dosed every 2 weeks for all phases 
of the study with the exception of the maintenance phase.  During maintenance, the frequency of 
elotuzumab dosing drops to once every 4 weeks.  Therefore, the dose  of elotuzumab is  increased 
to 20  mg/kg for that phase to maintain as much of the receptor saturation as p ossible , as reflected 
by [CONTACT_64356] I studies ( Zonder et al 2012 , Lonial et al 2012 ).  The t 1/2 increased 
with an increased dose of elotuzumab from 0.5  mg/k g to 20  mg/kg, and saturation of the CS1 by 
[CONTACT_64357].  At doses 
of 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg elotuzumab, CS1 receptors on bone marrow –derived myeloma cells 
were consistently saturated.   Lower dose groups exhibited more variation in the level of target 
cell saturation achieved.  Since the  20-mg/kg dose of elotuzumab, both as monotherapy and in 
combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone , has been shown to be well tolerated when 
dosed  every 2 weeks, n o increase in toxicity would be expected with the less frequ ent dosing 
schedule of once every 4 weeks.  This  maintenance strategy is being used in  several large studies 
in front -line MM in both the transplant and non -transplant settings .

[IP_ADDRESS]  Guidelines for infusion reactions  
Grade 1 infusion reaction  
Grade 1  elotuzumab infusion -related reactions by [CONTACT_108], require no intervention; however, 
increased monitoring is recommended.  
Grade ≥2 infusion reaction  
For a Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_69806]  should be treated as clinically indicated with one or more of the following medications or 
interventions: antiemetics, antihistamines, analgesics, corticosteroids, leukotriene inhibitors, 
oxygen inhalation, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], bronchodilators, or other supportive me asures as indicated.  
Patients with a Grade [ADDRESS_69807] s should continue to receive lenalidomide and dexamethasone per 
protocol.  
Once the elotuzumab infusion -related reaction h as resolved to Grade ≤1, the infusion can be 
restarted at 0.5 mL/minute.  If symptoms do not recur after 30 minutes, the infusion rate may be 
increased in a stepwise fashion (0.5 mL/minute every 30 minutes) to a maximum of 2 mL/minute 
or the rate at which the infusion reaction occurred.  Patients who experience an infusion reaction 
require vital signs to be monitored every [ADDRESS_69808] ’s signs 
and symptoms.  The infusion can be reattempted at the next protocol -defined infusion time point 
at the Investigator’s discretion with additional pr emedication as described in Table 1. 
If a Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_69809] should be treated as clinically indicated with 1 or more of the following med ications or 
interventions: diphenhydramine, acetaminophen, hydrocortisone, H [ADDRESS_69810] the next infusion started at 
0.5 mL/minute and then escalated in a stepwise fashion (0.5 mL/minute every 30 minutes to a 
maximum of 2 mL/minute).  If there is no recurrence of a Grade >2 infusion reaction, the next 
infusion may be initiate d at 1.0 mL/minute.  The infusion rate may be escalated by 
1.0 mL/minute to a maximum rate of 2 mL/minute, if the subject does not experience an infusion 
reaction within [ADDRESS_69811] has received 3 consecutive infusions initiated at 
1.0 mL/m inute without a Grade >2 infusion reaction, subsequent infusions may be initiated at a 
maximum rate of 2.0 mL/minute and maintained at that rate.  
The dose reduction guidelines for other non-hematologic toxicities are shown in  Table 5.

8.1.4 Precautions and risks a ssociated with elotuzumab  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Infusion reactions  
Elotuzumab can cause infusion reactions.  Infusion reactions were repor ted in approximately 
10% of patients treated with ERd in the randomized trial in patients with MM.  All reports of 
infusion reaction were Grade 3 or lower.  Grade 3 infusion reactions occurred in 1% of patients.  
The most common symptoms of an infusion rea ction included fever, chills, and hypertension.  
Bradycardia and hypotension also developed during infusions.  
In the trial, 5% of patients required interruption of the administration of elotuzumab for a median 
of 25 minutes due to infusion reactions, and 1 % of patients discontinued due to infusion 
reactions.  Of the patients who experienced an infusion reaction, 70% (23/33) had them during 
the first dose.  
Administer premedication consisting of dexamethasone, antihistamines (H 1 and H 2 blockers), 
and acetamin ophen prior to elotuzumab infusion.  
Interrupt elotuzumab infusion for Grade 2 or higher infusion reactions and institute appropriate 
medical management.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Infections  
In a clinical trial of patients with MM (N=635), infections were reported in 81.4% of patien ts in 
the ERd arm and 74.4% in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Ld) arm.  Grade 3 to 4 
infections were noted in 28% and 24.3% of ERd - and Ld -treated patients, respectively.  
Discontinuations due to infections occurred in 3.5% of ERd -treated and 4.1% of Ld-treated 
patients.  Fatal infections were reported in 2.5% and 2.2% of ERd - and Ld -treated patients.  
Opportunistic infections were reported in 22% of patients in the ERd arm and 12.9% of patients 
in the Ld arm.  Fungal infections occurred in 9.7% of pati ents in the ERd arm and 5.4% of 
patients in the Ld arm.  Herpes zoster was reported in 13.5% of patients treated with ERd and 
6.9% of patients treated with Ld.  Monitor patients for development of infections and treat 
promptly.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Second primary malignancies  
In a clinical trial of patients with MM (N=635), invasive second primary malignancies have been 
observed in 9.1% of patients treated with ERd and 5.7% of patients treated with Ld.  The rate of 
hematologic malignancies were the same between the ERd and Ld t reatment arms (1.6%).   Solid 
tumors were reported in 3.5% and 2.2% of ER d- and Ld -treated patients, respectively.  Skin 
cancer was reported in 4.4% and 2 .8% of patients treated with ERd and Ld,  respectively.  
Monitor patients for the development of second primary malignancies.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Hepatoxicity  
Elevations in liver enzymes (AST/ALT greater than [ADDRESS_69836]) consistent with hepatotoxicity were 
reported in 2.5% and 0.6% of ERd - and Ld-treated patients, respectively, in a clinical trial of

Page 57 of 96 patients with MM (N=635).  Two patients experiencing hepatotoxicity were not able to continue 
treatment; however, 6 out of 8 patients had resolution and were able to continue treatment.  
Monitor li ver enzymes periodically.  Stop elotuzumab upon Grade 3 or higher elevation of liver 
enzymes.  After return to baseline values, continuation of treatment may be considered.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Interference with determination of complete response  
Elotuzumab is a humanized IgG kappa monoclonal antibody that can be detected on both the 
serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and immunofixation (IFE) assays used for the clinical 
monitoring of endogenous M -protein.  This interference can impact the determination of CR and

humans, whether or not considered  drug related.  An AE  can be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temp orarily associated with the 
use of a drug, without any judgement about causality.   An AE  can arise with any use of the drug 
(e.g., off -label use, use in combination with another drug) and with any route of administration,

11.1.2  Serious adverse events  
An AE or a suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is considered “serious” if it results in any of 
the following outcomes:  
 Death  
 A life -threatening AE  
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_869]  
 A persistent  or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Potential drug -induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important medical

one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias 
or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.  
It is important to distinguish between “serious” and “severe” AE, as the terms are not 
synonymous.  Severity is a measure of intensity; however, an AE of  severe intensity need not 
necessarily be considered serious.  Seriousness serves as the guide for defining regulatory 
reporting obligations.  “Serious” is a regulatory definition and is based on patient/event outcome 
or action usually associated with even ts that pose a threat to a patient’s life or vital functions.  
For example, nausea which persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but may 
not be considered an SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke which results in only a limited degree of 
disability may be considered only a mild stroke, but would be considered an SAE.  Severity and 
seriousness should be independently assessed when recording AEs on the eCRF and SAEs on the 
SAE Report Form.

relationship betwee n the drug and the AE .  A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree 
of certainty about causality than adverse reactio n, wh ich means any AE  caused by a drug.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Recording of  adverse e vents  
All AEs of any patient during the course of the research study will be recorded in the eCRF, and 
the investigator will give his or her opi[INVESTIGATOR_64337] e relationship of the AE to the study drug 
treatment (i.e., whether the event is related or unrelated to study drug administration).  
All AEs should be documented.  A description of the event, including its date of onset and 
resolution, whether it const itutes an SAE  or not, any action taken (e.g., changes to study 
treatment), and outcome, shou ld be provided, along with the I nvestigator’s assessment of 
causality (i.e., the rela tionship to the study treatments ).  For an AE to be a suspected treatment -
related e vent there should be at least a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between the 
protocol treatment and the AE.  Adverse events will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE 
Version  4.03, and changes will be documented.  
If the AE is serious, it shou ld be reported immediately to Sarah Cannon  Development 
Innovations  Safety Department.  Other untoward events occurring in the framework of a clinical 
study are to be recorded as AEs (i.e., AEs that occur prior to assignment of study treatment that

study treatment as defined by [CONTACT_64373], are to be recorded on the 
corresponding screen(s) included in the eCRF.  
All AEs resulting in discontinuation from the study should be followed until resolution or 
stabilization.  All new AEs occurring duri ng this period must be reported and followed until 
resolution unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the AE or laboratory abnormality/ies are not 
likely to improve because of the underlying disease.  In this case, the investigators must record 
his or her reasoning for this decision in the patient’s medical record and as a comment on the 
eCRF screen.  
After [ADDRESS_69859], or other means , will be 
reported appropriately.  Each reported AE or SAE will be described by [CONTACT_13662] (i.e.,  start and 
end dates), regulatory seriousness criteria (if applicable ), suspected relationship to the study drug 
(see following guidance), and actions taken.  
To ensure consistency of AE and SAE causality assessments, investigators should apply the 
following general guideline:  
YES:  There is a plausible temporal re lationship between the onset of the AE and 
administration of the study medication, and the AE cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_4677]’s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and/or the AE 
follows a known pattern of response to the study drug, and/or the AE abates or resolves

11.3 Recording of adverse events and serious adverse e vents  
11.3.1  Diagnosis versus signs and s ymptoms  
All AEs should be recorded individually in the patient’s own words (verbatim) unless, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_64338], the AEs constitute components of a 
recognized condition, disease, or syndrome.  In the latter case, the condition, disease, or 
syndrome should be named rather than each individual sign or symptom.  If a c onstellation of 
signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at 
the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded as an AE or SAE as appropriate

Page 65 of 96 on the relevant form(s) (SAE Report Form and/or AE e CRF screen).  If a diagnosis is 
subsequently established, it should be reported as follow -up information is available.  If a 
diagnosis is determined subsequent to the reporting of the constellation of symptoms, the 
signs/symptoms should be updated to refle ct the diagnosis.  
Progression of malignancy (including fatal outcomes), if documented by [CONTACT_5371] (for example, as per IMWG Uniform Response Criteria ), should not be reported as an 
SAE.  
11.3.2  Persistent or recurrent adverse e vents  
A persistent A E is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation 
time points.  Such events should only be recorded once on the SAE Report Form and/or the AE 
eCRF screen.  If a persistent AE becomes more severe or lessens in severity, it s hould be 
recorded on a separate SAE Report Form and/or AE eCRF screen.  
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between patient evaluation time points, and 
subsequently recurs.  All recurrent AEs should be recorded on an SAE Report Form and/or AE 
eCRF screen.  
11.3.3  Abnormal laboratory v alues  
If an abnormal laboratory value or vital sign is associated with clinical signs and/or symptoms, 
the sign or symptom should be reported as an AE or SAE, and the associated laboratory value or 
vital sign should be consid ered additional information that must be collected on the relevant 
eCRF screen.  If the laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome, only the diagnosis 
needs to be recorded on the SAE Report Form or AE eCRF screen.  
Abnormal laboratory values will be reported as an AE if: the laboratory result requires an 
adjustment in the study drug(s) or discontinuation of treatment, and/or laboratory findings 
require additional testing or surgical intervention, a laboratory result or finding is associated wi th 
accompanying symptoms, or a laboratory result is  considered to be an AE by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator.  
11.3.4  Deaths  
Deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AE reporting period that are attributed by [CONTACT_64374] “Study Discontinuation” 
eCRF screen.  All other on -study deaths, regardless of attribution, will be recorded on an SAE 
Report Form and expeditiously reported to the Sarah Cannon  Development Innovations  Safety 
Department.  
When recording a SAE wi th an outcome of death, the event or condition that caused or 
contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the SAE 
Report Form and Adverse Event screen of the eCRF.  If the cause of death is unknown and 
cannot be asc ertained at the time of reporting, record “Death NOS” on the eCRF Adverse Event 
screen.  During post -study survival follow -up, deaths attributed to progression of disease will be 
recorded only on the “After Progressive Disease Follow -Up” eCRF screen.

condition should be recorded as an AE  or SAE only if the frequency, severity, or character of the 
condition worsens during the study.  When recording such events on an SAE Report Form and/or

All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilizat ion. 
11.5.2  Sponsor assessment of u nexpected  
The Sponsor is responsibl e for assessing an AE  or SAR  as “unexpected .” 
An AE  or SAR  is considered “unexpected” when the following conditions occur:  
 Event(s) is not mentioned in the Investigator’s Brochure  
 Event(s) is n ot listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed  
 Event(s) is not consistent with the General Investigative Plan or in the current application  
 Includes AEs or SAR s that may be anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the 
study drug,  or that occur with members of the drug class, or that have previously been 
observed under investigation  
When applicab le, an unexpected AE may also apply to an event that is not listed i n the current 
US Package Insert , or an event t hat may be mentioned in the package insert , but differs from the 
event because of gre ater severity or specificity.  
Known as Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R), these events are 
suspected (by [CONTACT_9304]) to be related to the study drug, are une xpected (not 
listed in the  Investigator’s Brochure or package insert ), and are serious (as defined by [CONTACT_12695]) and require expedient submission to relevant health authorities within 7 days (fatal or 
life-threatening event) or 15 days (all serious even ts), or as defined by [CONTACT_2371].  The term S[LOCATION_003]R is 
used primarily in the reporting of events to regulatory authorities.  
Expected AEs are those events that are listed or characterized in the package i nsert or current 
Investigator’s Brochure  (Elotuzumab 2014 ).

if retention requirements have been met.  All study  files will be maintained by [CONTACT_1034] 
(Sarah Cannon  Development Innovations) throughout the study , and w ill be held by [CONTACT_64387] . 
14.4 Data c ollection  
The study  eCRF is the primary data collection instrument for the study .  Case report forms will 
be completed using the English language and should be kept current to enable the Sponsor  to 
review the patients’ status es throughout the course of the study . 
In order to maintain confidentiality, only study  number, patient number, initials and date of birth 
will identify the patient in the eCRF.  If the patient’s name [CONTACT_64403] (e.g., 
laboratory report), it must be obliterated on the copy of the document to be supplied to Sarah 
Cannon  Development Innovations and replaced instead with the patient number and patient’s 
initials.  The investigator will maintain a personal patie nt identification list (patient numbers with 
corresponding patient identifiers) to enable records to be identified and verified as authentic.  
Patient data/information will be kept confidential, and will be managed according to applicable 
local, state, and  federal regulations.  
All data requested in the eCRF must be supported by [CONTACT_64388]’s source 
documentation.  All missing data must be explained.  When a required laboratory test, 
assessment, or evaluation has not been done or an “U nknown” box is not an option on the eCRF, 
a note should be created verifying that the field was “Not Done” or “Unknown .”  For any entry 
errors made, the error(s) must be corrected, and a note explaining the reason for change should 
be provided.  
The investi gator will electronically sign and date the patient eCRF casebook indicating that the 
data in the eCRF has been assessed.  Each completed eCRF will be signed and dated by [CONTACT_1268], once all data for that patient is final.

Appendix E: Guidelines for Female Patients of Childbearing Potential and Fertile Male 
Patients  
Females of repr oductive potential must have [ADDRESS_69883] mon th, then 
monthly thereafter in women with regular menstrual cycles or every 2 weeks in women with 
irregular menstrual cycles . 
Acceptable Contraception Methods:  
Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming 
pregna nt, must use highly effective contracep tion for at least 4 weeks before beginning study 
therapy, during therapy, during dose interruptions, and for 4 weeks following discontinuation 
of study therapy . 
Highly effective contraception is defined as either:  
True Abstinence  When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient . 
Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -
ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of 
contraception.  
Sterilization   When a woman of childbearing potential has had surgical bilateral 
oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least 
six weeks prior to study entry.  In case of oophorectomy alone, only 
when the reproductive status of the woman has been conf irmed by 
[CONTACT_104].  
Male Partner Sterilization  When  the appropriate post -vasectomy documentation of the 
absence of sperm in the ejaculate . 
Use of a combination of any two of the following ( one from a + one from b): 
a) Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)  
b)  Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (dia phragm or  
cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository.  
Lenalidomide is present in the semen of pat ients receiving the drug.  Fertile m ale patients , 
defined as all males physiologically capable of conceiving offspring, with female partners of  
child -bearing potential must always use a latex or synthetic condom during any sexual contact 
[CONTACT_64394], during dose inte rruptions, 
and for [ADDRESS_69884] not donate sperm.

 Latex condom, diaphragm or cervical/vault cap when used with spermicidal 
foam/gel/film/cream/suppository  
Unacceptable Contraception Methods:  for women of childbearing potential include:  
 IUD progesterone T  
 Female cond om 
 Natural family planning (rhythm method) or breastfeeding  
 Fertility awareness  
 Withdrawal  
 Cervical shield  
Pregnancies  
If pregnancy does occur during treatment, lenalidomide must be discontinued immediately.  
To ensure patient  safety, each pregnancy in a patient on study treatment must be reported to 
the Sarah Cannon  Development  Innovations  Safety Department  within 24 hours of 
learning of its occurrence  using the pregnancy form at the end of this appendix .  The 
pregnancy should be followed up for 3  months af ter the termination of the pregnancy to 
determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and 
the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or new-
born complications.   Pregnan cy follow -up should be recorded on the same form and should 
include an assessment of the possible relationship to the study drug of any pregnancy outcome.   
Any SAE experienced during pregnancy must be reported on the SAE Report Form.  
Pregnancy outcomes mus t be collected for the female partners of any males who took study 
treatment in this study.  Consent to report information regarding these pregnancy outcomes 
should be obtained from the mother.  
Women Not of Childbearing Pot ential are defined as Follows:  
 Women are considered post -menopausal and not of childbearing potential if they have had 
12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g., 
age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms).  
 Women who are permanently steri lized (e.g., tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral

a Baseline procedures including medical history, physical examination ( including a neurological evaluation and a peripheral neuropathy questionnaire ), 
ECOG performance status, 12 -lead ECG, CBC, CMP plus magnesium and phosphorus, prothrombin time ( PT)/activated partial thromboplastin time 
(aPTT)/and International Normalized Ratio ( INR), LDH and uric acid,  and c-reactive protein (CRP)  should be done ≤[ADDRESS_69892] be prescribed through and in compliance with the Revlimid R EMS® program of Celgene Corporation.  Prescriptions must be filled 
within 7 days.  Consideration should be given to prescribing lenalidomide 5 to 7 days in advance of Day 1 of each cycle to al low time for required patient 
and prescriber surveys and drug sh ipment to patient.  Any unused Revlimid® (lenalidomide) should be returned to the patient for disposition in accordance 
with the Revlimid REMS® program.  
c Physical examinations will include the measurement of height at the screening visit only.  Patients s hould be weighed within  [ADDRESS_69893] dose.  Measurement of weight is not required for visits occurring after completion of 
treatment.  All physical examinations should include  an assessment of peripheral neuropathy (see Appendix F). 
d Vital signs will include resting heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and temperatur e. 
e All events will be recorded from first study treatment.  Non -serious AEs considered by [CONTACT_64395] [ADDRESS_69894], ALT, total bilirubin, 
total protein, albumin, magnesium, and phosphorus.  
g Coagulation tests:  PT, aPTT, and INR.  I f normal at baseline, they do not need to be repeated.  Patients requiring the initiation of an anti -coagulation 
therapy during study treatment should have coagulation tests performed according to standard practice guidelines.  
h Standard of care [ADDRESS_69895] consolidation cycle (Cycle 5)  
i Serum or urine pregnancy tests and pregnancy counseling are to be conducted in women of childbearing potential.  For definition of childbearing potential, 
see Appendix E.  Two serum or urine pregnancy tests must be performed; one 10 to 14 days prior to initiation of study treatment and one within  24 hours 
of initiation of study treatment.  Serum or uri ne pregnancy tests, including pregnancy counseling, for women of childbearing potential will continue 
weekly during Cycle 1, then monthly thereafter in women with regular menstrual cycles or every 2 weeks in women with irregula r menstrual cycles.   For 
those with irregular menses, pregnancy tests are required at 14 and 28 days after treatment discontinuation of lenalidomide.   From the end of Cycle 4 thru 
the start of mobilization, pregnancy tests are not required, but women of child -bearing potential should be reminded to follow approved birth control 
practices while off study treatment.  
j Restage every cycle (4 weeks):  response will be evaluated after completion of [ADDRESS_69896]  be done within a window of -
7 to Day 1 of the next cycle.   Disease assessments need only be done on Cycle 1 Day 1 if >14 days elapsed since baseline disease assessments.  
k 24-hour urine total protein, urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP), and urine protein immunofixation.  For patient s whose disease i s being monitored 
through UPEP, additional post baseline 24 -hour urine collections are required, as indicated.  
l Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP):  obtain blood for M -protein levels measured by [CONTACT_64396] s in whom 
SPEP are felt to be unreliable (IgA type multiple myeloma), depending upon which studies were positive at baseline.  
m Baseline bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_64350], cytogenetics, and FISH for 1q amplification, 13 d el, 1p  del, t(4;14), t(11;14), 
t(14;16) and 17p del) per institutional guidelines.  Sample should also be used for gene expression profiling (GEP) per insti tutional guidelines.   Bone 
marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026]/biopsies obtained ≤[ADDRESS_69897] analysis should be conducted per insti tutional guidelines.  
o Beginning with Cycle 12 Day 1, r estaging ( SPEP, UPEP, plasmacytoma  (if applicable) , quantitative Igs  [IgG, IgA, IgM] , and SFLC ) is to be conducted 
every 3 months during maintenance.  
p Plasmacytoma:  ONLY for patients with a known pla smacytoma that has been imaged before enrolling on study (to be done at baseline and every 2 cycles 
after that)  
 
 q Skeletal survey  or alternate imaging as per institutional guidelines :  should  preferably be within 28  days of plan ned treatment start , but ≤60 days prior to 
Cycle 1 Day 1 is acceptable .  This assessment i ncludes  lateral radiograph of the skull, anteroposterior and lateral views of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and anteroposterior 
views of the pelvis, ribs, femora, and humeri.    Skeletal survey need only be rep eated if clinically indicated (i.e. , bone pain).  
r Dexamethasone 8 mg IV is pre -medication  on the day of elotuzumab infusion 45 to 90 minutes prior to the start of elotuzumab infusion  (for all pre -
medications, see Section  5.1. 
s After patients are discontinued from the study, they will visit the study center ≤[ADDRESS_69898] dose of  study 
drug.  
t Patients who discontinue study treatment prior to the occurrence of disease progression will be followed every 3 months (±1 m onth ) for a total of up to [ADDRESS_69899].  
u Patients with documented disease recurrence or progression will be followed every 3 months (±1 month) for survival status (e. g., date and cause of death) 
for up to [ADDRESS_69900].  Patients may be contact[CONTACT_64397].  
v Cycle 5 Day 1 assessments need to be done only if >21 days elapsed between the Day  70 to 120 evaluation and start of consolidation.

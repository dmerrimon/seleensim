Revised 6/21/19 Page 2 of 12 1. Study Purpose and Rationale  
 
Acute coronary syndrome (ACS; myocardial infarction or unstable angina) is a leading cause of 
morbidity and mortality in the U.S., and survivors are at high risk for recurrent cardiovascular 
disease (CVD) events, particu larly if they do not adhere to risk -reducing medications. Failure to 
take aspi[INVESTIGATOR_252539] 75% increased risk of recurrent CVD events or 
mortality,1 and half of ACS patients are nonadherent to secondary risk medications by 1 year 
after the index ACS event. Emerging evidence suggests that posttraumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD) symptoms following ACS and other cardiovascular disease (CVD) are strongly 
associated with medication nonadherence, and ~50% of patients report symptoms.2-[ADDRESS_307019] distressed by a CVD event (as evidenced by [CONTACT_252568]) are also those least likely to behave in ways that would reduce the probability of 
CVD event recurrence.[ADDRESS_307020] from PTSD due to stereotypi[INVESTIGATOR_252540], because 
intrusive thoughts may be focused on fear of CVD event recurrence (FoR) in the future, rather 
than preoccupation with the past cardiac event.9 Ironically, rather than promoting preventive 
health behaviors, FoR may be associated with worse medication adherence, as patients wh o 
develop PTSD symptoms report avoiding medications because they do not want to be reminded 
of their CVD risk.10 It is possible that the small/distal perceived CVD benefit of adherence 
relative to the large/proximal psychological benefit of avoidance10 may result in nonadherence. 
We now propose to determine whether FoR is a modifiable mechanism linking PTSD symptoms 
with nonadherence to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_252541].  
 
We will use the Science of Behavior Change ( SOBC ) experimental medicin e approach to 
identify, measure, and influence FoR and related cognitive mechanisms (e.g., diminished future 
time perspective), and determine whether change in FoR is related to change in medication 
adherence. We will enroll N = [ADDRESS_307021] presenting to the emergency 
department with suspected acute coronary syndrome who reported  elevated early symptoms 
indicative of risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_138384] (threat perceptions ) at the time of their emergency 
department visit .11 In all particip ants, we will measure FoR using the Concerns About 
Recurrence Scale  (which we have adapted for ACS).13 We will also measure future time 
perspective using an assay from the SOBC measures repository: the Future Time Perspective 
Scale ,[ADDRESS_307022] their associa tion with FoR and nonadherence. Prior to discharge, we will 
randomize patients to receive a computerized cognitive -affective FoR intervention [8 sessions 
(30 min/session; 2/week for 4 weeks)[ADDRESS_307023] from threatening disease -related cues (e.g., looking away from the word recurrence 
and instead toward a neutral word such as categories) and to make b enign interpretations of 
ambiguous, potentially disease -related information (e.g., fatigue reflects lack of sleep, not ACS 
recurrence). Finally, we will test whether the intervention (and/or improvement in FoR) is 
associated with greater electronically -measured adherence to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_252542], 
including non-aspi[INVESTIGATOR_252543], beta-blockers , or statins, in the 2 months after discharge.  
 
Revised 6/21/19 Page 3 of 12 Specific Aim 1:  To measure FoR  in ACS patients, and test its associations with ACS -induced 
PTSD, diminished future time perspective, nonadherence to medications , and lack of physical 
activity .  
 
Specific Aim 2:  To test whether a cognitive -affective intervention reduces FoR in ACS patie nts.  
 
Specific Aim 3:  To test whether patients randomized to the intervention are more adherent to 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_252544] [ADDRESS_307024] 
is explained by [CONTACT_252569].  
 
Exploratory Aim  1: We will test for off -target in tervention effects on future time perspective, as 
well as the alternative mediation path through improvement in future time perspective.  
 
Exploratory Aim 2:  We will test whether the intervention is associated with greater increases in 
physical activity re lative to the control group and whether this association is mediated by 
[CONTACT_252570].  
 
Half of ACS patients are nonadherent to secondary prevention medications within [ADDRESS_307025] study to identify (and perhaps modify) 
cognitive/affective m echanisms of adherence behavior in patients at high risk for ACS 
recurrence and mortality. Physicians routinely magnify patients’ FoR after acute life -threatening 
medical events to capi[INVESTIGATOR_222400] “teachable moment.” This study may provide evidence for t he 
opposite approach, as well as validated measures to assess FoR in CVD patients.  
 
2. Study Design  
We will enroll 100 English- and Spanish -speaking  patien ts (50 intervention group, 50 
control group) who recently presented to the ED of the  [LOCATION_001] Presby[CONTACT_24021][INVESTIGATOR_307] 
(NYPH) with a probable admitting  diagno sis of acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ). 
Specifically, eligible participants will be  patients already  enrolled in a separate approved 
protocol (IRB -AAAR7350: “Testing biopsychosocial mechanisms of the posthospi[INVESTIGATOR_252545] [PHS] model of early rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_252546]”) who presented to the 
NYPH ED with chest pain and an admitting diagnosis of non -ST-elevation myocardial 
infarction ( NSTEMI) or unstable angina (UA). Prior to enrollment in that  separate study, 
participants will have verbally confirmed with the caregiving physician  that they were  not 
active substance  abusers, demented, an d/or psychotic. Patients will not be eligible for the 
present study  unless  they indicated during the consent procedure for that separate protoc ol 
that they were  willing to be contact[CONTACT_252571] a different study.  In terms of 
timing, patients who consented to the PHS study within the last 6 weeks (i.e., 42 days) will 
be potentially eligible for the present study.  
 
The fundamental components of the study design are  described below (see Procedure 
section for more details). One to t hree bilingual (English/Spanish) research assistants 
(RAs) assist in data collection  at each session .  
 
Revised 6/21/19 Page 4 of 12 Study recruitment occurs primarily in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_252547] 
(those  currently enrolled in the separate protocol AAAR7350  and interested in  learning 
more about other research  studies)  have been admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_252548]. For some patients, s tudy recruitment may occur post -discharge, up to 6 
weeks following participants’ presentation to the Emergency Department  when  they 
enroll ed in the PHS study.  Research coordinators  for the present protocol will approach 
these patients , introduce the study  and begin the informed consent process . Consenting 
participants are randomized to the intervention or control condition and complete baseline 
measures for the present protocol at the pre -training session (i.e., Time 1 ). Participants ar e 
given an electronic tablet device and a brief training on its use  at the end of or within 
several days of  this baseline session . For the subset of patients who provide signed consent  
and the brief tablet training for this intervention study in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_252549] , the Time -[ADDRESS_307026] the questionnaires and the 
brief tablet training of the pre -training session (i.e., Time 1) in person. All p articipants  then 
complete 8 sessions  of the training (intervention or control version) at home twice per 
week for [ADDRESS_307027] -training session (i.,e., Time 2), during which they 
complete the same measures as completed at the Time -1 session . Then, participants return 
the tablet devices to CUMC researchers using pre-addressed envelopes/packages  mailed to 
their homes. Finally, at 8 weeks  after the Time -1 session,  participants return the eCAP 
medication adherence monitoring devices to CUMC researchers also using pre-addressed 
envelo pes/packages  boxes.

The training sessions are administered by [CONTACT_252576] 4 weeks. The design of the training is described below separately for both conditions: 
intervention and control.  
 
Cognitive -Affective Training  (8 at -home sessi ons; 30 minutes each)  
 
Cognitive bias modification for attention (CBM -A) 
 
Intervention  version : In this modified dot probe task,[ADDRESS_307029] from ACS threat -related stimuli  (e.g., “death,” 
“heart attack” ) and toward neutral stimuli (e.g., “diet s,” “vacuum cleaner” ). Threat -related 
and neutral word pairs are matched on ap proximate number of characters and frequency of 
use in English and Spanish, at a fourth grade reading level per the Flesch -Kincaid 
readability statistic. This task consists of 160 trials ([ADDRESS_307030] trials). Each 
trial begins with one pai r of threat -neutral words for [ADDRESS_307031] occupi[INVESTIGATOR_252553]. Next a target screen appears 
that consists of a single letter (E or F) appearing in either the top or bottom location. 
Partici pants’ task is to respond as quickly and accurately as possible by [CONTACT_53737][INVESTIGATOR_252554] E or F. For participants in the 
intervention group, in the 130 training trials of the task, the location of the target letter (i.e., 
top or bottom) is always the location previously occupi[INVESTIGATOR_252555]. The other 
[ADDRESS_307032] trials, the location of the target 
Revised 6/21/[ADDRESS_307033] on 90.6% of trials (145/160).  
 
Control  version : For participants in the control group, in the 130 training trials of the task, 
the location of the target letter (i.e., top or bottom) is equally likely to be the location 
previously occupi[INVESTIGATOR_252556] -related word and the neutral word. The [ADDRESS_307034] trials for the intervention. Example trial from 
intervention group (see above). Thus, participants in the control group are not reinforced 
for attending to either particular kind of stimuli. For each ad ministration of the task, 
preferential attentional allocation toward threat -related information is assessed as the mean 
response time for test trials in which the target location is congruent with the threat -related 
word subtracted from the mean response t ime for test trials in which the target location is 
incongruent with the threat -related word. In this way, as a manipulation check, we will 
assess the extent to which attentional allocation to threat diminishes as a function of group 
and session (1 -8) over  the course of the 8 training sessions.  
 
Cognitive bias modificat ion for interpretation (CBM -I) 
 
Intervention  version : CBM -I trials are designed to train participants to appraise ambiguous 
information that is potentially related to ACS threat as benign. E ach of [ADDRESS_307035] or short phrase corresponding to either a threatening (e.g., “dying”) or benign 
(e.g., “sleep”) interpretation of a sentence that follows it (e.g., “You have been waking up 
tired recently”). On the next screen participa nts are asked to tap one of two buttons on the 
screen of the tablet to indicate “Yes” or “No” in response to the question “Was the word or 
phrase related to the sentence?” Participants in the intervention group receive positive 
feedback (“You are correct!” ) for rejected threat interpretations or for benign 
interpretations, and otherwise they receive negative feedback (“You are incorrect”).  
 
Control  version : Participants are equally likely to receive positive or negative feedback for 
endorsing or rejecting threat interpretations or for endorsing or rejecting benign 
interpretations. For each administration of the task, the tendency to make threat 
interpretations is assessed as the proportion of threat endorsements (i.e., “Yes” responses) 
on trials with threat -related words, and the tendency toward benign interpretations is 
assessed as the proportion of benign endorsements on trials with benign words. 
Additionally, we will assess threat rejection time (i.e., mean speed of responding “No” on 
trials with sentence s preceded by a threat -related word).  
 
Measures  
 
Fear of recurrence (FoR) of ACS . We have adapted the Concerns about Recurrence Scale  
(CARS )[ADDRESS_307036] cancer. T his adapted  scale  comprises 26 items evaluating three  
specific components of FCR. The health worries  subscale evaluates fears about declining 
health  (e.g., “I worry that a recurrence of a heart problem would threaten my physical 
health ”). The role worries subscale evaluates fears about impaired relationships with other 
Revised 6/21/19 Page 7 of 12 people  (e.g., “I worry that a recurrence of a heart problem would keep me from fulfilling 
my responsibilities ”). The death worries subscale evaluates fears about mortality (e.g., “I 
worry that a recurrence of a heart problem would threaten my life ”). Each item is rated on 
a Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 ( extremely ). A total score can be obtained for 
each subscale and for the total scale by [CONTACT_145851]. A higher s core indicates higher 
levels of FoR.  
 
Future time perspective . An exploratory aim of the study is to determine the relationships 
among FoR and medication adherence with future time perspective. Patients with cardiac -
induced PTSD often report that their sen se of the future is foreshortened, and prior 
conceptualizations of PTSD emphasized this sense.[ADDRESS_307037] PTSD diagnosis in a population of patients with 
multiple sclerosis, and may be similarly  associated with both PTSD and nonadherence in 
ACS patients.16  
 
If PTSD, FoR, or both are also associated with diminished future time perspective, patients 
may value future life goals (e.g., maintain long -term heart health by [CONTACT_252577][INVESTIGATOR_34223]) 
less than more immediate goals (e.g., avoid distressing reminders of past trauma and future 
mortality), with predictable consequences for health behaviors. Behavioral economics 
research suggests that diminished future perspective is associated with lower m edication 
adherence among patients with hypertension and diabetes.17 We will explore the 
associations among PTSD, FoR, and a measure from the SOBC measures repository that 
assess es time perspective ; the 10 -item self -reported Future Time Perspective Scale assesses 
the extent to which participants conceive of the future as relatively limited or open -
ended.14 
 
Medication adherence . We measure adherence to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_252557] 
(Information Med iary Corp., Ottawa, Canada). Medication bottles with these special caps 
automatically record the date and time of bottle openings. Medication adherence across a 
unit of time (e.g., 1 week, 1 month) is computed as the proportion of days that participants 
took the correct number of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_252558]. If patients are taking aspi[INVESTIGATOR_252559] (i.e., non-aspi[INVESTIGATOR_252560], beta-blockers , statins , or antihypertensives ), 
then the aspi[INVESTIGATOR_252561]. However, if patients are taking other heart medications (i.e., non-aspi[INVESTIGATOR_252562], beta-blockers , statins , or antihypertensive s) but not aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], then they will 
choose which one medication (either a non -aspi[INVESTIGATOR_252543], beta-blocker , statin , or 
antihypertensive ) to put in the eCAP bottle  to be monitored . 
 
Threat Perceptions . In a separate protocol w e measure perceptions of threat, which are 
very early indicators of PTSD symptoms at the emergency department .11 This measure is 
used as part of the eligibility criteria (see above).  
 
Context sensitivity.  We measure participants’ ability to identify information about stressful  
situations that is helpful for the successful and flexible regulat ion of distress . The Context 
Sensitivity Index (CSI) presents hypothetical scenarios  and asks participants to answer 
questions about them (e.g., “How much control do you have over what happens next? ”).12  
Revised 6/21/[ADDRESS_307038] the extent to which the hypothesized measures of the behavior change mechanisms 
in question (FoR, future time perspective) are intercorrelated in ACS patients with elevated acute 
stress symptoms. First, to test convergent validity, we will assess zero -order correlations among 
these measures. Specifically, we predict that —across both groups at Time 1 before the 
intervention —higher FoR will be associated with lower future time perspective (i.e., lower 
FTPS). Second, we will test whether higher FoR is associated with higher threat perception 
symptoms and overall lower proportio n of days adherent to aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]. Third, due to the within -
subjects design, we will also assess test -retest reliability from Time [ADDRESS_307039] size of a cognitive -affective intervention on FoR 
symptoms (Hedge’s g for difference in health worries from pre - to post -intervention = 0.35). In 
separate unadju sted tests with pre -to-post change in FoR (and in an exploratory test of future 
time perspective) as the outcome, we will enter group (intervention, control) as the predictor. We 
will repeat the tests adjusting for factors that may explain variance in heal th behavior, including 
demographic information (age, sex, race, ethnicity), medical severity assessed by [CONTACT_252578]18 and Charlson comorbidity index,[ADDRESS_307040] the questi on 
definitively, the results will inform whether a future larger trial is warranted. The behavioral 
outcome in the model is heart medication adherence from the eCAP data: mean proportion of 
adherent days in the 2 -month  monitoring period that occurs within several months  after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7954]. The predictor is group (intervention, control). The mediator is pre -to-post change in 
FoR from Time [ADDRESS_307041] ed 
improved heart medication adherence over the month -long intervention.  
Revised 6/21/[ADDRESS_307042] will be structured as for Specific Aim 3 and Exploratory Aim 1 but with physical 
activity  as the tested behavioral outcome measure  instead of medication adherence . 
 
Power analysis.  
In prior research with N = [ADDRESS_307043] size (Hedges g = 0.54) was found for differences in FoR between the 
intervention (n  = 64) and control (n = 36) groups after [ADDRESS_307044] 
size (Hedge’s g = 0.35) immediately after the 1 -month intervention.13 Using G*Power 3.1,[ADDRESS_307045] size f 
of 0.35 or larger with a sample size of N = 100 (50 intervention, 50 control), given alpha = .05 
and an intention -to-treat design in which missing dat a due to attrition are handled with multiple 
imputation.  
 
4. Study Procedures  
 
Patients will be considered for enrollment in the present study who are currently enrolled in 
AAAR7350  (the PHS study) , who signed consent for AAAR7350 within the last 6 weeks (i.e., 
42 days),  who have indicated they are willing to hear about other research studies , and who have 
an Elevated Threat Perception score.  Consent will be obtained using an IRB -approved consent 
form .  
 
Pre-training /Time 1: For patients consenting to the study  in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , the pre -training session  
ideally  occurs at this same visit. The RA will assess the potential mechanisms of behavior 
change verbally. At the end of this session , each patient will be given a tablet and an eCAP bottle  
with a brief explanation of their use. The estimat ed duration of this session is 4 5 minutes , 
including the consent process , questionnaires, and the brief training in the use of the tablet . A 
subset of patients will complete the consent process and receive  the devices (eCAP bottle, tablet) 
with a brief training in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_252563]. A separate subset of patients will complete the Time -1 session at 
CUMC sometime after hospi [INVESTIGATOR_252564] 6 weeks (i.e., 42 days) have elapsed from 
the time of consent to the protocol AAAR7350.  
 
Training phase: Random group assignment to the intervention or control group will be 
determined in a double -blind way by [CONTACT_252579]. 
Revised 6/21/19 Page 10 of 12 Participants are asked to complete 8 at -home 30 -minute intervention sessions (both CBM -A and 
CBM -I tasks are programmed to occur sequentially in one session). The schedule of sessions is [ADDRESS_307046]-training /Time 2: A clinical coordinator will administer the measures by [CONTACT_252580]. 
Participants who prefer a home visit  may complete the session in person and return their tablet to 
the interviewing clinical coordinator at that time . The estimated duration o f this session is 45 
minutes. All other participants will return their tablets and eCAP bottles via mail : one pre-
addressed envelope/  package for the return of the tablet at 4 weeks after the Time -1 session and 
soon after completion of the Time -2 session and one separate pre-addressed envelope/ package 
for the return of the eCAP bottle  at [ADDRESS_307047] installment 
of monetary compensation, participants receive $20 at Time 1. Regarding the second installment 
of monetary compensation, it is structured such that participants are incentivized to return their 
devices with complete data. They receive $[ADDRESS_307048] at-home tablet tasks session, 
$5 for the  2nd, $[ADDRESS_307049], $5 for the 4th, $10 for the 5th, $10 for the 6th, $20 for the 7th, and $20 
for the 8th tablet tasks session. They receive $[ADDRESS_307050] study compensation, participants  receive $20 for returning the eCAP device. Thus, total 
study compensation for participants who complete all sessions is $140  ($[ADDRESS_307051] installment + 
up to $100  in second installment  + $[ADDRESS_307052] installment ).

In April 2009, the CHR approved a minor modification that included the elimination of the third round of risk 
stratification  testing  at the 2-year visit (as had been  suggested  by [CONTACT_390000]/PREDICTS  Executive  Committee). 
However, during the May 12th m eeting of the VEST/PREDICTS Steering Committee, the members voted to 
reinstate  the third round  of risk stratification  testing.

VEST & VEST Registry – Summary of 
Revisions up to V3.2  January 2018 Page 2  Version 1.3 and 1.3a to Version 2.0 (6/24/2009)  
 
Enrollment into the VEST/PREDICTS study was significantly lower than expected. Consequently, during meeti ngs 
in May/June  of 2009,  the VEST/PREDICTS  NIH-appointed  Data  Safety  and Monitoring  Board,  Steering  Committee, 
and Executive Committee members voted to approve three study modifications that include, 1) allowing separate 
entry  into the VEST  only or PREDICTS  only components  of the study  while  retaining  participation  into the combined 
VEST/PREDICTS  study,  2) a reduction  in the sample  size for PREDICTS  to 2400,  and 3) an increase  in the number 
of clinical  sites implementing  our protocol  from 60 to 90. 
 
1. Relevant  changes  to the Protocol  can be found  on pages  1-7 to pages  1-10 where  we present  two tables  and 
accompanying  narrative  summarizing  different  inclusion  and exclusion  criteria  for the three  entry  options.  The 
inclusion and exclusion criteria for ‘VEST/PREDICTS combined’ and ‘VEST only’ participation are the same, 
and have not changed from the most recent approved protocol version 1.3a. (as displayed in Table 1 -1a on 
page  1-7). 
2. The modified  inclusion  and exclusion  criteria  for ‘PREDICT S only’ are displayed  in Table  1-1b on page  1-8. For 
participants  enrolling  in PREDICTS  only,  we broadened  the inclusion  criteria  to include  patients  ≤6 months  from 
an MI (#1, Table 1 -1b). Therefore the qualifying ejection fraction (EF) is either measured during the MI 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or if the patient presents outside of the [ADDRESS_489224] discharge window, the “most recent EF” 
before enrollment is the qualifying EF (#2, Table 1 -1b). This change allows for a larger pool of patients and 
parallels  what  is done  in practice  through  application  of current  ICD implantation  guidelines.  
3. The modified exclusion criteria for ‘PREDICTS only’ excludes patients with an existing ICD, with a previous 
cardiac arrest, and with sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventr icular fibrillation. However, patients are not 
excluded  who have  had prior CABG  (after  qualifying  MI), paralleling  current  guidelines  (3 months  after CABG).

Version 2.0 to Version 2.1 (1/29/2010)  
 
On December  3, 2009,  VEST/PREDICTS  (VP) Executive  and Steering  Committees  and the NIH appointed  DSMB 
approved a plan to 1) change the primary outcome in VEST from all -cause mortality to sudden death and, 2) 
extend the follow -up time in VEST to [ADDRESS_489227] (they will continue support for PREDICTS) and ZOLL has agreed to 
provide sole support for the continuation of VEST with the above changes. The Protocol has been modified as 
follows:  
1. Protocol Version change from  2.[ADDRESS_489228]  sample  size changed  from 4506  to 1890  (1900)  
5. Changes  in sample  size calculations  methodology  for VEST

27, 2011 and on November 11, 2011, UCSF’s Committee on Human Research also approved the changes to the 
protocol as well as the consent  forms  
 
The two major changes are as follows: 1) As of July 2011, the PREDICTS study follow -up is completed. Therefore, 
all PREDICTS -related text has been removed from the proposed new version of t he protocol and 2) As suggested

Version 3.1 to Version 3.2 (June 8, 2016)  
 
In October 2015, the VEST Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) reviewed the sample size re -estimation 
calculations  after [ADDRESS_489235]  wear  time was below  target  (i.e., below  the estimated  avg. of 17 hours  per day, which  was used 
for the original  sample  size calculations),  but the composite  event  rate had been  on target  throughout  the 
study. Due to the lower LifeVest average wear -time, which decreased the study’s current estimated power, the 
DSMB was concerned about a substantial likelihood of type II error.  
 
In March 2016, the DSMB recommended that the VES T sample size be increased by [CONTACT_390008] [ADDRESS_489236] 
Steering  Committee  approved  this amendment  to the protocol  on April 25, 2016.  
 
At the end of the trial, we will perform  a National  Death  Index  search  for U.S. participants  with unknown  vital status 
to obtain data on the primary (Sudden death) and secondary (all cause mortality) study outcomes. Confirmation of 
VEST  participant  deaths  is of vital importance,  in order  to reduce  the risk of missing  data bias which  may impact  the 
robustness of the final trial  results.

1.2 BACKGRO UND  
While implantable cardioverter -defibrillators (ICDs) have had some impact in reducing the nearly 
500,000 annual sudden cardiac deaths (SCD) in the US2, our current treatment strategy is still limited. 
Recent studies have demonstrated a very high rate o f sudden cardiac death in the first several months 
following a myocardial infarction (MI), particularly in participants with depressed left ventricular 
function. One study (DINAMIT) showed that implanting an ICD during this period reduced arrhythmic 
mortal ity, but did not reduce overall mortality.[ADDRESS_489248] -MI

participants as possible. The CCC Project Director will act as a recruitment liaison with the sites, 
monitoring recruitment goals at each site and facilitating information sharing about successful recruitment 
strategies. If a center is found to be recruiting below goals, the CCC will arrange for those sites to 
exchange ideas and recruitment strategies with successful clinics, f ollowed if appropriate by a site visit to 
assist the clinic in correcting any problems. Sites with continued recruitment difficulties may be closed 
before study termination.

Continuous Participant Monitoring (during the study period: V0 -V2) 
In addition to the visits described above, participants randomized to LifeVest will have continuous 
remote monitoring via the LifeVest.  
 
Monitoring Capabilities and Data Collection from LifeVest: The LifeVest performs constant ECG 
monitoring while it is worn. It records all ventric ular tachyarrhythmias that last more than 15 seconds and 
asystolic events (<20 beats per minute). Bradyarrhythmias (<40 bpm) are logged but no ECG is recorded. 
It also compi[INVESTIGATOR_389978] d ay. This 
data will be uploaded via modem and phone line. After initial setup, the coordinator or fitter (from ZOLL 
Lifecor) will upload the participant’s baseline data, then the participant will upload (from home) every 
other day for a total of [ADDRESS_489260] participants to discover problems and encourage compliance. Sites with persistent or 
numerous poorly compliant participants will be visited and their staff re -trained.  
 
The participant’s compliance to the visit schedule will be continuously monitored on the study 
website by [CONTACT_68566]. The CCC will review visit compli ance reports with the clinical sites on the 
Quality Control Committee conference calls/meetings to identify problems and recommend corrective 
action. If a participant misses a scheduled visit, clinic staff will contact [CONTACT_12552]/her immediately to review the 
reasons for the missed visit, to identify any barriers that can be corrected, and to reschedule the  visit.  
 
1.5.[ADDRESS_489261]  
Participants will be randomized in a 2:[ADDRESS_489262] -MI and CHF medical 
therapy plus a wearable defibr illator (LifeVest) or optimal post -MI and CHF medical therapy alone for [ADDRESS_489263] ideally before they are 
discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7708], but the fitting may occur at the particip ant’s home within [ADDRESS_489264] discharge from index MI.  
 
Compliance:  Prior to consent to participate in the study, potential participants may be shown the 
LifeVest and given an opportunity to try it on. Participants will be told that they will be expected t o wear 
the LifeVest for at least [ADDRESS_489265] monitor via the integrated modem over a phone line. Participants, 
regardless of group assignment, will receive optimal medical therapy based on current AHA/ACC 
Guidelines unless there is a contraindication7, 8. 
Participants will be urged to wear the LifeVest continuously after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_389979] 3 
months (or until ICD implantation). They will be instructed to take the LifeVest off only for bathing or 
showering. Participants will send data from the LifeVest monitor via modem [ADDRESS_489266], 
Holter data, arrhythmia occurrence and shocks (delivered and aborted). Site coordinators  will contact 
[CONTACT_390014]’t transmit on schedule or who wear the LifeVest <[ADDRESS_489267]  Protocol

 consecutive days by [CONTACT_390015]. For sites with poor compliance rates, the following 
remedial actions will be taken: 1) discussions with site coordinator; 2) engagement of ZOLL Lifecor staff 
and site visit for coordinator training, if needed; 3) engagement of ZOLL Lifecor staff for fitting of 
participants.  
Blinding to treatment assignment:  Participants and clinicians will not be blinded to treatment 
assignment (LifeVest versus no LifeVest). Since the primary outcome in VEST is sudden death and death 
due to ventricular arrhythmia, it is unlikely that this outcome would be significantly affect ed by [CONTACT_390016].  
Blinding to arrhythmias : Clinicians will be blinded to most arrhythmia recordings from the LifeVest 
in the group assigned to wear the LifeVest. This is necessary to prevent co -interve ntions with 
inappropriate anti -arrhythmic drugs or early implantation of an ICD. There are provisions for unblinding 
when clinically indicated, as detailed in Chapter 6 of the Operations Manual. Two types of unblinding 
will occur:  
 
1) Automatic unblinding , generated by [CONTACT_390017], which will result in electronic notification to 
the site and sending of LifeVest monitoring strips. Automatic unblinding will be initiated if any of the 
following events  occurs:  
• Participant receives a  shock  
• LifeVest alarms, but participant averts a shock or the rhythm spontaneously  terminates 
if the rhythm lasts > 30  seconds  
• Asystole or Bradycardia less than 20  bpm 
2) Clinical sites can request unblinding and receive LifeVest strips under the following  circumstances:  
• Participant suffers a cardiac arrest, or reports receiving a shock or LifeVest  alarm  
• Participant complains of syncope or  pre-syncope  
• Participant complains of palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814]  
• Physician deems it to be medically necessary (a protocol deviation may be reported) 
The procedure for requesting these strips will require a case report form (completed by [CONTACT_390018]) 
with a diagnosis or rationale (as outlined above), the date range of strips requested and a follow -up form 
that documents any treatment change s resulting from viewing these  strips.  
 
Crossovers  
Participants randomized to the control arm of VEST should not wear a LifeVest during the [ADDRESS_489268] follow -up period; use of a LifeVest by a control participant will be recorded as a protocol 
deviation.  
Treatment of Participants Who Receive a LifeVest Shock  
Evaluation and treatment of participants who receive a shock while wearing the LifeVest will be 
determined by [CONTACT_172276]. Recommendations for possible evaluation strategies and treatment 
will be included in the Operations Manual (Chapter Guidelines for Care of the Medical Treatment). This 
may include the possibility of assessing for recurrent ischemia, treatment of arrhythmias such as atrial 
fibrillation or titration of medication.  
Early IC D Implantation  
It is recognized that some participants will develop indications for ICD implantation during the [ADDRESS_489269] portion of the study. Given the short follow -up of only 3 months, we anticipate that this 
will be a rare event. The protocol provid es for participants in the control (non -LifeVest group) and the 
intervention group (LifeVest group) who suffer an aborted cardiac arrest subsequent to the qualifying

The following are NOT considered appropriate reasons for early ICD implantation and if elected by 
[CONTACT_390019]:  
• Malfunction of the LifeVest (Poor sensing or inappropriate detection/shock  delivery)  
• Poor participant  compliance  
• Non-sustained ventricular arrhythmias (<30  seconds)  
• Asymptomatic ventricular  arrhythmias

1.5.6 Randomization  
Participants will be randomized in a 2:[ADDRESS_489271] chance maldistribution of important predictors. Stratification will 
be by [CONTACT_390021] (<25% vs. >25%) and by [CONTACT_390022] (i.e., None/PCI/CABG), both known 
strong predictors of mortality, and by [CONTACT_390023].  Randomization blocks will vary in size 
to protect against predictability of randomization assignment within clinical site/EF/revascularization strata. Block 
size will vary from [ADDRESS_489272] 2:1 ratio in 
any given site/EF/revascularization stratum. Separate tables for each stratum will be pre -generated (by [CONTACT_390024]),  encrypted,  and accessible  only to the Senior Statistician 
and the DCC Data  Analyst.  
The DCC will implement a web -based interface that clinical sites will use to obtain randomization  assignments 
for each enrolled participant after completion of the Enrollment Visit. Clinical sites will access the r andomization 
website using a secure password, and will be prompted to attest that all entrance criteria are met and that informed 
consent has been obtained. Each inclusion and exclusion criterion will require active attestation to minimize errors 
of omissi on. Once entry criteria are verified electronically, the recruiter will be shown a “randomize” button, and 
will receive the assignment (“Wear LifeVest” or “Do Not Wear LifeVest”) upon activating the button since 
participants and clinical site clinicians ar e not blinded to treatment assignment. After randomization, the group 
assignment may be printed by [CONTACT_390025] -specific study instructions for 
physicians and  participants.  
If there is any question regarding eligibil ity for randomization, the clinical site personnel will contact [CONTACT_390026]. Every effort will be made to minimize protocol deviations 
regarding participant eligibility for the study, including quality control pr ocedures to assure that the ejection 
fraction (EF) entry criterion is accurate.  
 
1.5.[ADDRESS_489273] to follow -up given the short 3 month time frame. All the 
participants will be recovering from a recent MI; therefore, they are less likely to travel far or be non -compliant. 
Two thirds of the participants will also be wearin g a LifeVest during these [ADDRESS_489274] will be required to send data vi a a modem (integrated into the 
LifeVest monitor) on a weekly basis. This will allow clinical sites to track participants on a weekly basis. The Data 
Management System will identify participants who have missed transmissions and post reports on the study we bsite 
accessed by [CONTACT_390027]. These will be followed up by e -mail alerts.  
VEST  Protocol  
Page 10 06/08/[ADDRESS_489275].  
 
1.5.9 Outcome  Variables  
The outcome measures are outlined in Table 3. The primary outcome is sudden death and death due to 
ventricular arrhythmia at 3 months (90 days) after ra ndomization. We will use the following definition of Sudden 
Death:  
 
For witnessed deaths, sudden cardiac death will be defined as an unexpected, non -traumatic, non - 
self-inflicted fatality in otherwise stable participants who die within one hour of the ons et of the 
terminal symptoms. For persons dying more than one hour after a cardiac arrest from a 
ventricular arrhythmia, the Non -Sudden Death due to Ventricular Arrhythmia category should be 
used.  
 
For unwitnessed deaths, participants will meet the definition of sudden death if they are found 
dead within [ADDRESS_489276] from complications (e.g., neurological 
damage). Secondary outcomes for VEST are total mortality, non -sudden death and other cause -specific mortality 
(non-sudden fatal MI, other cardiac death, non -cardi ac death, and indeterminate cause of death), hospi[INVESTIGATOR_389981], congestive heart failure, stroke/transient ischemic attack, ventricular arrhythmias, adverse events, LifeVest 
compliance, eventual ICD implantation, quality of life, and resource utilizat ion/cost. The wearable defibrillator can 
do continuous ECG recording and monitor time worn. Therefore, data for several of the secondary outcomes that 
are analyzed within the intervention group will come from the LifeVest transmissions.  
 
Outcome Adjudicati on: The DCC will direct the adjudication of study outcomes. Assigning cause -specific 
mortality, as is required for the primary VEST outcome and a number of important secondary endpoints for VEST, 
can be difficult. Cardiac electrophysiologists actively enga ged in clinically relevant patient care will be employed 
to provide expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_389982]. The Endpoints Director will manage the adjudication process 
designed to categorize arrhythmias and deaths appropriately, minimize bias by [CONTACT_390028] g adjudicators to treatment 
assignment, and protect against unnecessary disclosure of protected health information. Table 3 lists the primary 
and secondary outcomes, the data source, and whether or not each endpoint requires adjudication. Definitions for 
each endpoint are provided  below.  
 
Cause -specific Mortality and Non -Fatal Cardiovascular Events: Deaths will be reported by [CONTACT_390029], or detected by [CONTACT_390030] s 
scheduled data transmissions. Social security death index searches will be performed for all participants lost to 
follow -up for whom vital status is unknown in the U.S.. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_389983]. Sites will notify the DCC within [ADDRESS_489277] eight weeks to obtain a death certificate; all discharge 
summaries for any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_389984] 1 mont h of the index death/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and narratives from 
personal contacts of deceased participants (listed at recruitment) regarding manner and circumstances of death. All 
personal identifiers and mention of treatment assignment (for the VEST arm) will b e carefully stripped by [CONTACT_390031]. For all deaths, the DCC will redact any mention of the LifeVest in participants 
assigned to VEST, and add fake redaction in participants assigned to NO VEST so that adjudication of cause o f 
death will be blinded. ECG data from the LifeVest will NOT be used to adjudicate fatal outcomes for  VEST,  
VEST  Protocol  
Page 11 06/08/[ADDRESS_489278] adjudicator 
when required.  
 
Ventricular Arrhythmias: Electronic rhythm strips recorded by [CONTACT_390032]. Strips will be presente d to adjudicators in batches, with study ID numbers 
and adjudication forms and read independently by [CONTACT_390033]. Adjudicators will determine 
whether the LifeVest therapy was “appropriate” or “inappropriate” based primarily on the pres ence or absence of a 
true ventricular arrhythmia. Discordances will be resolved by [CONTACT_21128], involving a third adjudicator when 
required.  
 
Quality of Life: Quality of life outcomes will be measured using self -administered questionnaires mailed to 
particip ants 1 -2 weeks prior to the 3 month visit. QOL will be assessed using the SF -36 for health related quality of 
life, the CES -D to measure depression, the Spi[INVESTIGATOR_389985], and the MOS sleep scale to 
measure sleep patterns. The EQ -5D will be administered to measure subjective health status, and the International 
Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) short format for physical activity. The [LOCATION_012] Patient Acceptance Scale 
(FPAS) will be included to measure device acceptance in those randomi zed to the LifeVest.  
 
Economic Outcomes: Cardiovascular hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], visits to emergency rooms, unscheduled cardiovascular 
outpatient visits and adverse events will be collected at the follow -up visits by [CONTACT_6270] -report, including the reasons for 
admissi on and length of stay. All admissions will be assigned to a DRG based on participant report and review of 
medical records obtained to document clinical outcomes. The number of physician visits, major tests, and 
medications will be collected using a brief s urvey. For VEST, we will compare costs over follow -up between 
participants assigned to the LifeVest and those assigned to usual care. We will analyze whether the costs of 
management, apart from the cost of the LifeVest itself, are lower in the vest assigne d participants. This approach 
will allow us to determine if there are any cost savings in the VEST arm participants that will offset the expected, 
planned costs of the intervention. In a secondary analysis, we will compare total cost (i.e., costs including  the cost 
of the LifeVest) between the two randomized groups, and calculate confidence limits on the cost difference 
between the two groups using a bootstrap resampling approach.  
 
 
1.5.10  Adverse/Outcome  Events  
Most symptoms, signs and clinical events will be captured by [CONTACT_390034].  Data collection forms are specifically designed to capture known adverse events from the 
LifeVest including physical discomfort (rash, etc.). Inappropriate shock events will b e adjudicated, as above. Site 
investigators will make a determination for all deaths and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_389986]; all such events will be adjudicated and summarized for the Data Safety Monitoring B oard 
(DSMB).  
 
 
1.5.[ADDRESS_489279] and control groups at 60/[ADDRESS_489280] will be conducted using a two -sided alpha 
of 5%. This analysis will be by [CONTACT_118067] (ITT), without regard to adherence to the assigned study 
intervention or other aspects of c are. The analysis will be jointly

We will also conduct a secondary “ modified intention -to-treat” analysis of sudden death and death due to 
ventricular arrhythmia, total mortality, and other secondary outcomes. For this analysis, follow -up time will start at 
the time of discharge instead of randomization, and end 60/[ADDRESS_489282] methods specified for the primary analysis; for more common seco ndary 
outcomes, asymptotic methods will be considered.  
We will also analyze treatment effects on overall mortality and non -sudden death, non -fatal cardiovascular 
events, ventricular arrhythmias, adverse events, LifeVest compliance, ICD implantation, qualit y of life and resource 
utilization/cost. For rare outcomes, exact methods will be used, as for the primary endpoint. For VEST therapi[INVESTIGATOR_389991], we will use the Anderson -Gill extension of the Cox model for repeated events, with robust 
standard  errors, to better capture information from high -risk participants with repeated VEST therapi[INVESTIGATOR_389992].  
We will also conduct a secondary, “as treated” analysis of sudden death and death due to ventricular 
arrhythmia, total mortality, and other  secondary outcomes. The primary ITT analysis will estimate effectiveness of 
the vest, averaged over variations in compliance. We will attempt to estimate the efficacy of the vest for prevention 
of sudden death and death due to ventricular arrhythmia as we ll as total mortality using survival models treating 
observed vest use as a time -dependent covariate. For sudden death and death due to ventricular arrhythmia, we  will

 use a Fine -Gray model treating other deaths as competing risks; a standard Cox model will be used for total 
mortality.  
 
1.5.[ADDRESS_489283] study was estimated to be 1,890. This 
assumed a power of 80%, with a 2 -sided alpha of 0.05 and a 2:[ADDRESS_489284] sample size was 
carefully computed using data -based estimates of the following factors:  
 
1. Mortality due to sudden death in the first 2 months following an MI in patients with EF≤35% is 2.4%. The 
VALIANT Study, the EPHESUS Study, and t he DINAMIT Study are three recent studies reporting on 
mortality and sudden death rates in the early period following an MI in populations similar to our study 
population. A meta -analysis of these three studies populations gives a summary estimate for sudd en death 
rate of  2.4% . 
 
2. Mortality due to sudden death in the first 3 months following an MI in patients with EF≤35% is 3.0%. 
Using month -by-month data on sudden death in VALIANT, we estimate that extending follow -up from 2 to 3 
months will increase the sud den death rate by 25%, from 2.4% to 3.0%. This accounts for declines in the 
sudden death rate in the weeks following  MI. 
 
3. Mortality  due to ventricular  arrhythmias  in the first 3 months  following  an MI in patients  with EF≤35%  is 
2.73%. The wearable defibrillator vest will be effective at reducing only sudden death due to a ventricular 
arrhythmia. The preliminary data from the wearable defibrillation vest shows that 91% of all sudden cardiac 
arrests are due to ventricular arrhythmias. This is consiste nt with estimates in the literature. Therefore, 91% 
of 3.0% would give us an expected mortality of 2.73% due to ventricular  arrhythmia.  
 
4. The effectiveness of the wearable defibrillator to reduce sudden death due to ventricular arrhythmias will 
be 71.9%. Previous analyses show that the LifeVest conversion success rate is 98% for syncopal VT/VF. 
Based on early experience in VEST and planned changes in randomization procedures, we have targeted an 
intention -to-treat compliance rate with the LifeVest of 70%. Th is means that participants assigned to the 
LifeVest will wear it for 70% of all hours in the [ADDRESS_489285] will be used during more than 70% of sudden death 
events. Thus, we estimate that the LifeVest will reduce sudden death due to syncopal VT/VF by  71.9%.  
 
5. Given the above assumptions, we estimate an overall sudden death rate of 3.0% in the control group and 
1.02% in the wearable defibrillator group (67% reduction in sudden death). The absolute reduction in 
mortality is the mortality from ventricular arrhythm ia (2.73%) times the effectiveness of the LifeVest 
(71.9%) = 1.98%. Thus, the sudden death rate in the defibrillator LifeVest group is expected to be the 
mortality in the control group minus the absolute reduction or 3.00% -1.98% =  1.02%.  
 
6. Given the short follow -up period (3 months) and strong efforts to collect complete data, we anticipate 
minimal loss to follow -up and minimal crossover. Crossover in the treatment group (LifeVest group) is 
accounted for in #4 above (some patients will not tolerate th e LifeVest). Given that the LifeVest is only 
available by [CONTACT_50246], we expect that crossover from the control group to the treatment group will be 
exceedingly  rare. 
 
7. A power of 80%, with a 2 -sided alpha of 0.05 and a 2:1 randomization scheme. Using the se estimated 
event rates, a 2:[ADDRESS_489286]: We recognized that this sample size calculation is sensitive to the values of 
the inputs  noted  above.  This raises  the concern  that the VEST  trial might  fail to reach  firm conclusions  despi[INVESTIGATOR_389993] 14 06/08/[ADDRESS_489287] compliance and crossover rates (off - 
protocol use of the LifeVest in the NO VEST arm), in conjunction with our original assumptions about the 
proportion of all sudden deaths that are due to ventricular arrhythmias and the efficacy of the LifeVest  in 
preventing these  potential events. We will also account for time in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_389994] (using real estimates of time -to-discharge from the study), during which the LifeVest is typi[INVESTIGATOR_389995]. Because this 
procedure is blinded to treatment assignment, no meaningful inflation of the type -I error rate is expected.11, 12 
The following limits will be adhered to when updating the sample size:  
• The sample size will be updated only if the revised sample size is more than 10% larger than the planned 
value of 1900, i.e., greater than  2100.  
• The updated sample size will not exceed 4,000 (twice the current planned sample  size).  
• No decrease in the planned sample size will be allowed (outside of the direction of the  DSMB).  
 
FINAL SAMPLE SIZE: In October 2015, after [ADDRESS_489288] (DSMB) reviewed the blinded sample size re -estimation ca lculations and was concerned that 
with the estimated power at the current sample size (n=1890) there is a substantial likelihood of type II error.  
Therefore, the DSMB recommended that the VEST sample size be increased in order to achieve an estimated 
power  of at least 70%, with a composite sudden death rate in the trial of 1.66%.  
 
On April 25, 2016, the VEST Steering Committee approved the increase in sample size to a total of 2300 
participants.  
 
1.6 DATA  REPOSITORY  
All primary data (including that collected vi a questionnaire, testing, LifeVest interrogation) will be stored in a 
study -wide database.

obtained by [CONTACT_390037], and by [CONTACT_390038].  
 
1.7.1 U.S. National Death Index Search at End of the  Trial  
 
At the end of the trial, we will perform a National Death Index search for U.S. participants with unknown vital 
status to obtain data on the primary (sudden death) and secondary (all cause mortality) study outcomes.  
Confirmation of VEST participant deaths is of vital importance, in order to reduce the risk of missing data bias 
which may impact the robustness of the final trial results. The International Conference on Har monization (ICH) 
guidelines on Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials14, which has been adopted by [CONTACT_941] U.S. FDA, state “Missing 
values represent a potential source of bias in a clinical trial. Hence, every effort should be undertaken to fulfill all 
the requirements of the protocol concerning the collection and management of data.”  
 
The proposed NDI search qualifies for a waiver of consent. Federal regulation 45 CFR 46.116(d)  establishes four 
criteria for waiving consent or altering the elements of consent in minimal risk studies.  
 
1. The research involves no more than minimal  risk; 
VEST  Protocol  
Page 15 06/08/201

Version   
 • The NDI search involves no more than minimal risk, since the only potential risk of the NDI search is a 
possible loss of confidentiality for VEST participants that have unknown vital status at the end of the 
study period. Based on the c urrent rate of unknown vital status in VEST to date (as of June 2016), it is 
estimated that only 6% of all randomized participants (6% of 2300 = 138 participants) will have 
unknown vital status at the end of the trial. The UCSF Data Coordinating Center wil l do the 
following to minimize the risk of a loss of confidentiality: (1) access to NDI search data that 
includes possible identifiers will be limited to the unblinded statistician and the unblinded 
DSMB project director; (2) NDI search data with identifie rs will be temporarily stored on a 
restricted access server that is encrypted and password protected. This is necessary for the 
data to be reviewed for accuracy during the matching process; (3) After completion of the 
matching process and vital status for the approx. n=138 participants has been determined, all 
electronic (and hardcopy data, if any) NDI data containing identifiers will be  destroyed.  
 
2. The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the  subjects;  
• The NDI search wil l not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the VEST participants, since the only 
potential risk of the NDI search is a possible loss of confidentiality for VEST participants that have 
unknown vital status (approx..  n=138).  
 
3. The research could not pra cticably be carried out without the waiver or alteration;  and 
• There is no other option for obtaining the data necessary to answer this trial’s key research objective 
regarding the primary study outcome (death) without the NDI search for the participants wi th unknown 
vital status at the end of the study period . Prior to classifying a participant as having “unknown vital 
status”, the clinical sites will attempt to obtain vital status using all available options, as possible (e.g., 
contact[CONTACT_90803] u sing all available contact [CONTACT_3031] (i.e., U.S. mail, email, phone), 
contact[CONTACT_376581]/friends, search of available medical records, search of public records, including 
obituaries and genealogy websites). Only after these options have been exhausted wil l the participant 
be included in the list of individuals to be submitted to the NDI. It would not be possible to obtain 
consent to do the NDI search for these participants with “unknown vital status” at the end of the  trial. 
 
4. Whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information  after 
participation.  
• The NDI search will only provide results for the potential confirmation of death outcomes in VEST 
participants. Therefore, this criteria does not  apply.

 PART 2. COORDINATING CENTERS’ PLAN  
 
2.[ADDRESS_489290]. A Clinical  Coordinating Center 
(CCC), led by [CONTACT_390039], MD, 
responsible for day -to-day operations of 
the study as it relates to participant 
enrollment and clinical site 
administration, and a Data Coordinating 
Center (DCC), led by [CONTACT_390040], 
MD, MPH responsib le for assuring 
excellence of all aspects of data 
acquisition and analysis for the study.  
The PIs and staff of the coordinating 
centers will work cooperatively to assure 
the successful achievement of the studies’ 
specific aims. One of the reasons for 
separ ate coordinating centers is to assure 
that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_389996],   
Figure [ADDRESS_489291]. Olgin and will be comprised of the CC co -investigators (Drs.  
Pletcher and Lee), statistician ([CONTACT_267088]), representatives from ZOL L, select consultants and site PIs. 
Industry representatives will be non -voting members on the committee. A list of Steering Committee Members is 
attached. The Steering Committee will meet at least twice in the 1st year and then at least once yearly in per son, 
videoconference or teleconference.  
 
Executive Committee.  An executive subgroup of the Steering Committee will be responsible for decisions that 
require attention between Steering Committee meetings, and for major financial, administrative, and operati onal 

VEST  Protocol  
Page 17 06/08/[ADDRESS_489292]. Olgin (chair), [CONTACT_6321], [CONTACT_390057], [CONTACT_267088], and 
one representative from ZOLL. Industry representatives will be non -voting members on the committee.  
 
Quality Control (QC) Committee . The QC Committee will be responsible for assuring that the methods and 
procedures of the study are carried out uniformly and with a high level of quality. It will be co -chaired by [INVESTIGATOR_124].  
Pletcher (DCC) and [CONTACT_6321] (CCC), with [CONTACT_390057] leading t he portion of the meeting devoted to data quality, 
and [CONTACT_6321] leading the portion devoted to clinical procedures. Members of the committee will include the project 
directors of the DCC and CCC, representatives from all clinical sites (study coordinators),  and ad hoc participation 
by [CONTACT_390041] -wide consultants when needed.  
 
Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). An independent DSMB will be responsible for reviewing the outcome 
data obtained at regular intervals to recommend decisions designed to assure the safety of the participants, the 
integrity of the scientific effort, and the optimal timing for ending VEST recruitment.  
 
2.[ADDRESS_489293], transfer and store data. 
In this system, data are collected on Teleform forms and transmitted electronically (via fax) to the DCC by [CONTACT_390042]. Electronic data are received at the DCC and assessed by [CONTACT_390043] -wide database. Every 24 hours, data discrepancies (queries) are automatically 
generated identifying potential errors in the data. Clinical site staff members access their own data queries via the 
secure web site and resolve them in a timely manner. An audit trail of changes to the data is automatically 
produced. Data from outside sources, such as central reading centers or core laboratories, is integrated into the 
study -wide  database.  
 
Study -wide Communications/Website:  Most communication and problem -solving regarding data management 
issues will occur through a central website provided by [CONTACT_390044]. The private, secure website 
provides access to a study -wide directory with phone numbers, fax numbers and e -mail addresses of all clinical 
sites and core labs. It serves as a central repository for study documents including the operations manual, meeting 
and conference call m inutes, all -site emails, and all required data forms, which can be directly downloaded from the 
website.  
 
Data Collection and Editing at the Clinical sites : Our data system uses machine readable forms and Internet 
technology to provide rapid and timely acc ess to accurate and high quality data. The clinical sites complete the 
machine -readable data forms and transmit them to the DCC using standard fax machines. All that is required at the 
participating sites is a fax machine and a high -speed Internet connecti on. When the data arrives at the DCC, the 
data forms are received as an electronic image and are automatically evaluated using Teleform software. As each 
form is verified by a DCC staff member, the data is automatically written to the study’s Microsoft SQL  Server 
database.  
Each hour, all of the study data is subjected to error -checking programs that check for completeness, 
consistency and validity. The results of the error -checking procedures are posted to the study web site where 
clinical site personnel ch eck it daily to both confirm that the DCC has successfully received all of the faxed forms 
and to address the errors that have been detected. In all such procedures, site personnel will have access only to 
their own site’s data.  
VEST  Protocol  
Page 18 06/08/201

Version   
 Data Transmis sion from Reading Centers, Laboratories:  For data that is electronic in nature, such as from the 
LifeVest, the DCC will establish a system for efficient transfer of this data directly to the DCC database andwill 
monitor it for completeness and quality.  
 
 
2.[ADDRESS_489294] operating procedures (SOPs) for computer system security to ensure the 
confidentiality and validity of study data. The SOPs are designed to prevent unauthorized access and limit 
authorized access to our co mputer systems and are in compliance with established standards for Information 
Technology Security. Our network is privately maintained, hardware fire -walled and none of the workstations or 
database servers can be directly addressed from outside the Local  Area Network. Study website and database access 
requires a network domain account with appropriate account -specific permission on the database. All requests for 
new accounts and access to the database must be documented by a System Access Request Form sig ned by [CONTACT_390045].  
All study data will be stored on SQL servers at the DCC at [ADDRESS_489295]., San Francisco. Each server is 
backed -up nightly to disk and mirrored to a “failover” site at our co -location facility at [ADDRESS_489296] copi[INVESTIGATOR_389997] a disaster in one of the locations. In addition, backup copi[INVESTIGATOR_389998] 
(databases, user workstations, file servers , etc) are archived in Sacramento, [LOCATION_004] by [CONTACT_80838], Inc. This will 
protect the study data in case of a natural disaster affecting the San Francisco Bay Area.  All servers are housed in 
a new (2005) state -of the -art secure server room. Access to the ser ver room is via a limited access suite occupi[INVESTIGATOR_389999] (IT) staff. Both the suite and server room doors are fitted with an Access Control 
System. Only critical IT staff members are allowed to enter the room. All others who enter the server room (e.g., 
air conditioning repairman) must be accompanied by a member of the IT staff and their visit is  logged.  
Website communications are encrypted at the 128 -bit level using an SSL certificate issued by [CONTACT_390046] 
(Verisign, Inc, Mountain View, C A). All servers are protected from viruses by [CONTACT_80839] 4.x, 
Groupshield, and VirusScan Enterprise 7.x (McAfee, Santa Clara, CA). This software automatically checks for 
virus signature [CONTACT_80856]’ FTP and HTTP s ites once an hour. All anti -virus software is 
monitored and IT personnel are notified in the event that the software stops functioning on a particular server.  
 
2.5 TRAINING, SITE VISITS AND QUALITY  CONTROL  
Central Training Session:  A central training session for clinical site personnel will be held prior to 
the start of participant enrollment in the study. All staff will be trained on use of the LifeVest, study 
protocols, and the data system. At the initial training session, the clinical site coordinat ors will receive the 
Operations Manual, which will serve as a guide to the training session. The subsequent expectation is that 
if a trained staff member leaves during the study, he or she would train his/her replacement. Since that is 
not always possible,  we have found that new staff members are fairly readily able to learn the procedures 
of the study and the data system by [CONTACT_390047], either a site visit to a nearby [CONTACT_390048], and frequent telephone and email contact [CONTACT_390049].  
 
Site Visits to Clinical Sites:  Every clinic will be site visited soon after starting recruitment by a 
representative of the CCC, DCC or industry partner, and a structured review of facilities and equipment, 
procedures, files, systems and dat a will be carried out. In addition there may be early visits by 
[CONTACT_390050]. Subsequent site visits 
will be scheduled as needed, and to address quality control issues that come to light in the clinical and 
data monitoring procedures described below. In addition, routine site monitoring by [CONTACT_323238], DCC or ZOLL 
will occur throughout the study duration and at close -out. 
 
Data Quality Control and Verification at the DCC:  The distributed nature of th e data system 
emphasizes error identification and resolution at the clinical site soon after entry via the data query system 
described above. The primary advantage of this system is to concentrate data editing closer to the data 
collection process, which w ill result in the following benefits: (1) site personnel will have better  
VEST  Protocol  
Page 19 06/08/201
6 
Version   
 recollection of the data making resolution easier and more efficient, (2) data errors will not build up over 
time and remain manageable, (3) early recognition of errors  by [CONTACT_390051], and (4) data will be cleaner for interim reports and presentations to the 
DSMB. Once the data arrive at the DCC, there is a multi -step approach for data verification and quality 
control , including:  
• 100% visual verification of all data values as interpreted by [CONTACT_390052] (OCR) against scanned images of the completed source data  collection 
forms  
• Data form specific insertion criteria (via SQL triggers) to prevent duplicate or incorrectly 
identified form entry  
• Missing forms reports based on temporal or logical relationships, generated by a batch 
Visual Basic application. These reports will be made available on the study web  site. 
• Comprehensive univariate and multivariate field discrepancy identification by a Visual 
Basic query generation application. These queries will involve within -form and cross -form 
comparisons and will appear on the study web site for real -time resolution by t he clinical 
sites.  
• Complex and resource -intensive second -tier data cleaning in  SAS.  
 
The data management system provides an audit trail that tracks what variables have been changed, the 
date they were changed, and which staff member made the changes. In ad dition, site PIs or Co -PIs will be 
required to review and approve each participant dataset to ensure data integrity.  
 
Data Monitoring:  The DCC will design reports that will be accessible to all sites from the study 
website. Most reports will display data s tratified by [CONTACT_68566], introducing a healthy competition 
between centers.  Examples of such monitoring reports include: recruitment reports comparing goal 
versus actual recruitment rates by [CONTACT_384]; visit compliance reports comparing the number of expe cted 
visits to actual visits for each protocol -required visit; participant retention reports indicating the number of 
participants active, completed, lost, etc; missing forms reports; missing data reports (for specific critical 
data fields or variables), e tc. These reports will be reviewed every month on Quality Control Committee 
conference calls and periodically brought to the attention of the Steering Committee. These types of 
monitoring reports will also be presented to the DSMB along with outcomes data.   Such reports are 
critical to identify study -wide problems as well as problems specific to particular clinical sites, and since 
the reports are available “real -time”, problems can be addressed before they become  entrenched.

Statistical Analysis Plan  
Version 1.0 to Version 1.1 (5/12/2012)  
1. Primary endpoint revised from sudden cardiac death to sudden cardiac death or  non- 
sudden death to ventricular arrhythmia (Section A, page  1). 
Version 1.1 to V ersion 1.2 (12/5/2016)  
1. Analysis of primary endpoint revised to use a simple chi -square test rather than  exact 
stratified methods (Section A, page  1). 
2. Section on Exploratory Analysis of Compliance added (Section B.4, page  2). 
 
Version 1.2 to Version 1.3 (3/2/2017)  
1. Plan is added  for weighted  sensitivity  analysis  of primary  outcome  omitting  patients  with 
indeterminate cause of death or unknown vital status (Section  B.1.3)  
Version 1.3, 02Mar2017_DSMB approved  [ADDRESS_489301] and control groups at 60/[ADDRESS_489302] will be conducted using a two -sided alpha of 5%. This analysis 
will be by [CONTACT_118067] (ITT), according to treatment assignment, without regard to adherence 
to the assigned study intervention or other aspect s of care.  
 
B. Secondary  Analyses  
 
B.1. Sensitivity  Analyses  
Results will be checked for robustness in three planned sensitivity analyses.  
 
1. Modified intention to treat. We will omit from this analysis, patients who do not survive until 
discharge from the  index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and the 60/[ADDRESS_489303] for th ese factors. If more 
than two factors need to be adjusted for, we will summarize them using propensity scores 
[Rosenbaum 1983], then use a logistic model to adjust for the scores as a three -knot cubic  spline, 
requiring two basis functions, so that the cons ervative rule of thumb of approximately 10 events 
per variable is observed [Vittinghoff  2006].  
 
3. Inverse weighting to deal with indeterminate cause of death and missing vital status. In the 
primary analysis, participants with indeterminate cause of death or  missing vital status will be 
assumed not to have had a primary study event. In two secondary analyses, we will restrict the 
analysis to deceased participants with determinate cause of death and those known to be alive, 
weighting these observations so that  their baseline correlates of the primary outcome are 
representative of the entire randomized cohort. To do this, we will develop two logistic models: 
the first for having determinate cause of death among all patients known to have died, and the 
second for  having known vital status among all participants. Weights will be calculated as the 
inverse of the product of the fitted probabilities from these two models, after assigning a fitted 
probability of [ADDRESS_489304] across the 6 randomization strata jointly defined by [CONTACT_51634], PCI, and CABG, as well 
as across the 2 strata defined by [CONTACT_390054] 3 strata defined by [CONTACT_390055]. Nominal 
differences across strata will be conservatively interpreted in the light of tests for interaction 
between treatment and stratum, using a Bonferroni -corrected two -sided alpha of 0.05/3=0.0167. 
In additional  exploratory analysis, we will assess modification of the ITT treatment effect by  [CONTACT_8422], 
NYHA class, BMI, gender, and  compliance  
 
B.3. Treatment effects on secondary  endpoints  
o Total mortality, revascularization, ICD implantation . Treatment effects on these bina ry 
secondary endpoints will be analyzed using chi -square tests, as proposed for the primary 
analysis. Logistic regression will be used to adjust for baseline imbalances as  needed.  
 
o Re-infarctions and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] .Treatment effects on these potentially recurring outcomes 
will be analyzed using the Anderson -Gill extension of the Cox model for recurrent events, with 
robust standard errors [Therneau 2000], to account for potential clustering of recurrent  outcomes 
within  participants.  
o Vest-relate d symptoms . Fisher’s exact tests will be used to compare frequency of potentially 
vest-related symptoms currently tabulated in the DSMB report, including fatigue, back pain, 
trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and upper body rash and  itching.  
 
B.4. Exploratory analysis of  compli ance  
Factors associated with compliance with the VEST will be examined in an exploratory, 
hypothesis - generating analysis focusing on seasonality, site, geographic region, body mass 
index (BMI), time on study, baseline EF, as well as age, gender, race/ethn icity, education, marital 
and employment status, NYHA Class, and length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. The analysis will use two -part 
models for repeated daily compliance measures, the first a GEE logistic model for any use of the 
VEST, and the second a GEE linear mode l for hours of use, transformed as necessary to meet 
normality assumptions, for patient -days where any use is detected. Inference for the combined

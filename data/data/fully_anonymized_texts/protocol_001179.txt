Phase 1 Dose Escalation  
Phase 1 is the dose-escalation phase, which will include up to 6 cohorts of subjects treated with 
epacadostat at doses of 25 mg twice daily (BID), 50 mg BID, 75 mg BID, 100 mg BID, and 300 mg BID in combination with durvalumab 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg given on Day [ADDRESS_1253065] 75% of the doses (63 doses) and have received at least 
3 doses of durvalumab during the 42-day dose- limiting toxicity (DLT) observation period, or have 
experienced a DLT to be evaluable for dose tolerability.  Additional subjects will be enrolled in a cohort to achieve the minimum of 3 evaluable subjects if dropouts or dose interruptions/reductions occur that 
result in a subject being n onevaluable for DLTs.  
The dose of epacadostat will be escalated if [ADDRESS_1253066] 3 evaluable subjects enrolled experience a DLT, the cohort will be expanded to include 3 additional evaluab
le subjects.  If 2 or more of either 3 or 6 subjects enrolled experience a DLT, the prior 
dose level will be considered the MTD.  If only 3 subjects were treated at this dose level, the dose will be confirmed as the MTD by [CONTACT_894436] 3 sub jects before this dose is recommended for 
Phase 2 testing.   
The cohorts and dose levels are shown in the table below. 
Cohort  Maximum Daily Dose of Epacadostat  Dose of Durvalumab  
(Once Every 14 Days)  
1 25 mg BID orally  3 mg/kg IV  
2 25 mg BID orally  10 mg /kg IV  
3 50 mg BID orally  10 mg/kg IV  
4 75 mg BID orally  10 mg/kg IV  
5 100 mg BID orally  10 mg/kg IV  
6 300 mg BID orallya 10 mg/kg IV  
IV = intravenous.  
a Intermediate dose levels may be explored based on emerging PK or pharmacodynamic data.  
Phase [ADDRESS_1253067] will be enrolled at the MTD or PAD of epacadostat in 
combination with durvalumab.  The approximate number of subjects needed for the melanoma, TNBC, 
and gastric and GE junction cancer cohorts will be determined using the Simon 2- stage design:  Stage 1 
will be the initial number of subjects per tumor type, and the decision to proceed with Stage 2 will be determined by [CONTACT_894437] 1.   If more than 1 PAD is evaluated, the cohort may or 
may not be repeated for the specified tumor type as indicated in the table below.  The sponsor may limit 
enrollment of a specific tumor type to Stage 1.

NSCLC  [ADDRESS_1253074] of 3 periods: 
Screening:   Up to 28 days. 
Treatment Period:   The treatment period will continue every 14 days for up to 12 months as long as 
subjects are receiving benefit from treatment and hav e not met any criteria for study withdrawal.  Once 
subjects complete 12 months of study treatment or permanently discontinue study treatment for any other 
reason, the end-of-treatment (EOT) visit should be conducted, and they should enter the safety follow-up 
period of the study. 
Protocol Amendment 6 (28 JUN 2017) removed the option for subjects to receive epacadostat 
monotherapy once they completed [ADDRESS_1253075].  
These subjects will be allowed to continue epacadostat monotherapy for up to an additional 12 m onths, 
and their maximum overall study treatment duration should not exceed 24 months.  Exceptions for these 
subjects to  contin ue study treatment beyond 24 months will require medical monitor review and approval 
every 3 months. 
Follow -Up Period:   The safet y follow -up visits will occur at [ADDRESS_1253076] dose of study treatment (if the EOT was not performed).   
Study Drug s, Dosage s, and Mode s of Administration:  
Epacadostat  will be self -administered orally BID without regard to food and continued BID during each 
14-day cycle.  The MTD  or PAD  of epacadostat  defined during Phase [ADDRESS_1253077] dose escalation of epacadostat 
is not allowed. 
Durvalumab  is an investigational agent and will be administered at 3 mg/kg  or 10 mg/kg over 
[ADDRESS_1253078] dose escalation of durvalum ab is 
not allowed  except as defined in the body of the Protocol. 
Reference Therapy , Dosage,  and Mode of Administration :  Not applicable.  
Duration of Participation:   Subject participation is expected to average approximately 6 months. 
Study Population:  
Subjects with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced  melanoma, NSCLC, pancreatic cancer  
(Phase 1 only) , SCCHN, TNBC, gastric or  GE junction cancer, or TCC of the GU tract  will be enrolled.

1. INTRODUCTION 
INCB [ZIP_CODE]-203 is a Phase 1/2 study of epacadostat  administered in combination with 
durvalumab in subjects with advanced  melanoma, NSCLC, pancreatic cancer  (Phase 1 only), 
SCCHN , TNBC, gastric or  GE junction cancer, and TCC  of the GU tract .  Phase [ADDRESS_1253104] human PD-L1.  The antibody is composed of 2 identical heavy chains of approximately 49,670 Da each, and 2 identical light chains of approximately 23,390 Da each.  The fragment crystallizable domain of 
durvalumab contains a triple mutation in the constant domain of the IgG1 heavy chain that 
reduces binding to the complement component C1q and the fragment crystallizable  gamma 
receptors responsible for mediating antibody- dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity.  
For a thorough discussion of the pharmacology of epacadostat  and durvalumab, refer to the 
epacadostat  Investigator's Brochure ( iIB) and the current  durvalumab Investigator' s 
Brochure  (mIB). 
1.1. Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background  
The immune system has the innate ability to detect and eliminate aberrant cells, including tumor 
cells.  This occurs through T cells by [CONTACT_894442].  Tum or cells have been shown to evade the 
immune system by [CONTACT_894443] ( Davies  2014).  Immune therapi[INVESTIGATOR_894392]'s ability to control malignancy.  The PD -[ADDRESS_1253105] 
been  shown to be present in the tumor microenvironment and appear to be valid immunotherapy 
targets for generating a successful immune response ( Creelan  2014, Spranger  et al 2014).  
1.1.1. Inhibition of PD -[ADDRESS_1253106].  
The normal function of PD-1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T cells under normal conditions, is to down-modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including 
autoimmune reactions.  Similar to CTLA -4, PD- 1 is a surface receptor member of the B7 -CD28 
superfamily.  It has been shown to induce T- cell tolerance by [CONTACT_894444] (PD-L1 and/or PD- L2) ( Talmadge et al 2007, 
Creelan  2014).  The mechanism by [CONTACT_13209]-[ADDRESS_1253107] from that of CTLA -4, as both mol ecules regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_55509] ( Hiraoka 2010, Nobili et al 2008).  PD -1 has been shown to be expressed on activated 
lymphocytes, including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, Tregs, and natural killer

Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 203 Amendment 7  Version 7  21 SEP 2018  
cells ( Hodi and Dranoff 2010, Kloor 2009).  The ligands for PD- 1 (PD -L1 and PD- L2) are 
expressed in several cell types, including nonhematopoietic tissues and many tumors 
(Lee et al 2008, Leffers  et al 2009, Nishimura  et al 2000, Hiraoka 2010).  Binding of either PD-[ADDRESS_1253108] notably on vascular endothelium, whereas PD-L2 protein is only detectably expressed on antigen- presenting cells 
found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments.  PD-L2 is thought to control 
immune T -cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD-L1 serves to dampen unwarranted 
T-cell function in peripheral tissues ( Hiraoka 2010).  PD -L1 is  expressed in many human tumors 
and has been associated with a poor prognosis ( Thompson et al 200 7, Konishi et al  2004, 
Hamanishi  et al 2007, Nomi et al  2007, Boland et al 2013).  This evidence suggests that the 
PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune evasion and that upregulation of this 
pathway contributes to immune tolerance and tumor progression and should be considered as a target for the therapeutic intervention of cancer.  
1.1.2. Inhibition of IDO1 as a Target for Cancer 
Recent interest has focused on the role of IDO1 as a mechanism of immune tolerance in malignancy ( Godin- Ethier  et al 2011).  IDO1 is a heme-containing, monomeric oxidoreductase 
that catalyzes the degradation of the essential amino acid tryptophan to N -formyl -kynurenine.  
Kynurenine can be subsequently metabolized through a series of enzymatic steps to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.  IDO1 is the first rate-limiting enzyme in one of the breakdown pathways of tryptophan. 
The expression and activity profiles of IDO1 are distinct from those of tryptophan dioxygenase, 
an enzyme predominantly expressed in liver that catalyzes the same enzymatic reaction as IDO1 and maintains proper tryptophan balance in response to dietary uptake.  In contrast to tryptophan 
dioxygenase, IDO1 is expressed in a variety of tissues, with particularly high levels found in 
areas of contact [CONTACT_398823] (eg, gut, respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352], placenta, 
spleen), consistent with a role for regulating tryptophan metabolism in a local microenvironment 
(Mellor  and Munn 2004).  Within the immune system, IDO1 activity is specifically induced in 
cells such as DCs and macrophages at localized sites of inflammation ( Munn and Mellor 2007).  
IDO1 -driven oxidation of tryptophan results in a strong inhibitory effect on the development of 
T-cell mediated responses by [CONTACT_47506] T-cell activation and inducing T-cell apoptosis 
(Mellor  et al 2003).  Both the reduction in local tryptophan levels and the production of 
tryptophan catabolites that are inhibitory to cell proliferation contribute to the 
immunosuppressive effects ( Frumento et al 2002).  IDO1 activity also promotes the 
differentiation of naive T cells to Treg s (Fallarino  et al 2006).  Since increased Treg activity has 
been shown to promote tumor growth and Treg depletion has been shown to allow an otherwise ineffectual antitumor immune response to occur ( Zou 2006), IDO1 expansion of Tregs may 
provide an additional mechanism whereby [CONTACT_165881]1 could promote an immunosuppressive 
environment. 
A critical role for IDO1 in immune modulation has been confirmed in numerous animal models, 
including models of allograft tolerance, inflammation, and cancer ( Mellor  and Munn 2004).  
While IDO1 inhibition can exacerbate disease in models of autoimmune disorders ( Mellor  and 
Munn 2004), IDO1 null mice show no evidence of susceptibility to developi[INVESTIGATOR_894393] 27 of 166

ipi[INVESTIGATOR_45762], respectively) in subjects with advanced melanoma.  In the Phase 1 
open- label, dose escalation study of nivolumab in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], ORR  
(according to the modified World Health Organization criteria) for all subjects in the concurrent regimen group was 40%.  Evidence of clinical activity (conventional, unconfirmed, or immune -related response or SD for ≥ 24 weeks) was observed in 65% of subjects.  In 17 subjects 
treated at the maximum doses that were associated with an acceptable level of AEs, 53% of subjects had an objective response compared with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79285] (10.9%), all with tumor reduction of ≥ 80%.  Grade 3 or 4 AEs related to therapy occurred in 53% of subjects in 
the concurrent- regimen group but were qualitatively similar to previous experience with 
monotherapy and were generally reversible ( Wolchok et al 2013).  
In the Phase 2 randomized, double-blinded study of nivolumab in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_206] i pi[INVESTIGATOR_894394], unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma, the investigator- assessed ORR among subjects  with BRAF wild -type tumors was 
61% (95% CI, 49 to 72) in the combination group versus 11% in the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_404311].  A CR was observed in 16 subjects  (22%) in the combination group and no subjects  in the 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_894395].  In subjects  with BRAF wild -type tumors, median PFS was not 
reached with the combination and was 4.4 months (95% CI, 2.8 to 5.7) w ith ipi[INVESTIGATOR_894396] (HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.68; p < 0.001).  Among subjects with BRAF mutation 
positive tumors, the ORR  was 52% (12 of 23 subjects) in the combination group.  M edian PFS 
for the combination was 8.5 months (95% CI, 2.8 to not estimable) and 2.7 months (95% CI, 1.0 to 5.4) in the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_894395].   The rate of treatment -related AEs was 91% in 
the combination group and 93% in the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_404311].  Drug -related AEs of 
Grade 3 or 4 were reported more frequently in the combination group than in the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_404311] (54% vs 24%).  Select AEs with potential immunological causes were 
consistent with the Phase [ADDRESS_1253109] of the events resolved with immune-modulating 
medication  (Postow et  al 2015).  
As described above, IDO1 is another negative regulatory mechanism that contributes to 
tumor-derived immune suppression.  In preclinical models, IDO1 inhibition has been shown to 
synergize with blockade of either anti −CTLA -4 or anti−PD-1/PD-L1 in delaying tumor growth 
and increasing OS (Holmgaard  et al 2013, Spranger  et al 2014).  This effect was shown to be 
T-cell−dependent, leading to enhanced T- cell proliferation and  interleukin-2 production within 
the tumor and to a marked increase in the effector -to-regulatory T- cell ratios in the tumors.  
In an ongoing Phase 1/2  open- label dose- escalation study of epacadostat  in combination with 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (3  mg/kg IV), daily doses of  epacadostat  have been evaluated in 21- day cycles.  In 
the initial Phase 1 dose-escalation portion, 5 of 7 subjects  receiving epacadostat 300 mg BID in 
combination with 4 doses of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (3 mg/kg every 3 weeks) developed clinically 
significant ALT elevations; therefore, the study was amended to evaluate lower epacadostat 
doses.  At the 300 mg BID dose level, 6 of 7 subjects had evaluable scans and all showed SD  as 
assessed by [CONTACT_19104] .  Enrollment was restarted at 25 mg BID (n  = 8), where [ADDRESS_1253110] with 
progression of prior extensive liver metastases had a dose- limiting toxicity ( DLT ; Grade [ADDRESS_1253111] 
elevation).  Subsequent cohorts received 50 mg BID continuous, 50 mg BID interm ittent 
(2 weeks on, 1 week off), and 75 mg BID (50 mg every morning/25 mg every evening) in 
combination with 4 doses of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks.  Eighteen subjects were 
enrolled in the 50 mg BID continuous dosing cohort, and 4 DLTs were reported ([ADDRESS_1253112] tumor tissue assessed for the presence of a 
driver mutation that stimulates tumor growth.  These mutations define subsets of patients like ly 
to respond to specific inhibitors ( NCCN  Guidelines ).  Patients with a known driver mutation in 
the EGFR are initially managed with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( Moran  and 
Sequist 2012, Gridelli et al 2012).  Those with an anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusion oncogene 
in their tumor are preferentially treated with crizotinib ( Kwak  et al 2010, Camidge  et al 2012, 
Shaw  et al 2013).  Patients without a driver mutation are generally treated with chemotherapy.  
Most patients with advanced NSCLC eventually develop PD and require additional treatment 
after their initial treatment with either chemother apy or targeted therapy.  Currently approved

Phase 1 studies of anti −PD-[ADDRESS_1253113] disease progression on or after platinum-containing regimens ( Garon  et al 2015 ).  
Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations should have disease progression on an 
FDA -approved therapy for these aberrations before receiving pembr olizumab.  In the Phase 1 
study by [CONTACT_894445] (2015), an ORR of 19.4% was reported in the [ADDRESS_1253114] disease progression on an FDA-approved therapy for these agents.  The Phase 3 study comparing nivolumab to docetaxel resulted in an OS of 12.2 months (95% CI, 9.7 to 15.0) 
among 292 subjects in the nivolumab group and 9.4 months among the 290 subjects  in the 
docetaxel group (HR, 0.73; 96% CI, 0.59 to 0.89; p = 0.002).  The response rate with nivolumab 
was 19% as compared with 12% in the docetaxel group (p = 0.02) ( Borghaei  et al 2015). 
In addition to PD-[ADDRESS_1253115] also shown promising data.  
MPDL3280A, a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks PD-L1 from binding to its 
receptors, including PD-1 and B7.1, has shown similar efficacy.  In a Phase 1 study that included 
subjects with both squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC; ORR was 24% (9/37), and at the time of the abstract publication, all responses were ongoing and improving ( Soria  et al 2013).  The 
24-week PFS was 46%.  Analysis of biomarker data from tumor samples demonstrate d a 
correlation between PD -L1 status and efficacy  in both the MPDL3280A and pembrolizumab 
(MK-3475) studies. 
Targeting the IDO1 enzyme has been studied in subjects  with metastatic NSCLC as well in the 
form of vaccination with an epi[INVESTIGATOR_762230]1.  In the Phase 1 study, no severe toxicities occurred.  One of 15 HLA-A2−positive subjects treated developed a PR after 1 year of 
vaccine treatment, and SD of ≥ 8.5 months was reported in another 6 subjects.  The median survival was 25.9 months, and long- lasting PR  + SD was seen in 47% of the subjects .  
Express ion of IDO was detected in 9 of 10 tumor biopsy specimens by [CONTACT_4658] (Iversen  et al 2014).

Most die from the disease because it commonly presents in an advanced state.  
Chemotherapy represents the cornerstone of initial therapy for patients with advanced disease.  
Until recently, single -agent gemcitabine or gemcitabine in combination with erlotinib was 
considered the standard of care for most patients in the first- line advanced disease setting 
(Burris  et al 1997, Moore et al 2007).  Two combination regimens have recently emerged as new 
standards of care based on Phase 3 studies in which the combinations were compared to 
gemcitabine monotherapy.  
Subjects treated with gemcitabine in combination with nab-pa clitaxel showed a statistically 
significant improvement in OS compared with subjects  receiving gemcitabine alone (median of 
8.5 months vs 6.7 months; HR 0.72, p = 0.000015).  Based on these results, the combination of 
gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel was ap proved by [CONTACT_894446]- line treatment of 
metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and has emerged as a standard of care for the 
treatment of patients with advanced disease and good performance status ( NCCN  Guidelines ). 
The superiority of FOLFIRINOX (a regimen that combines leucovorin-modulated 5- FU with 
irinotecan and/or oxaliplatin) over gemcitabine monotherapy was initially suggested in a randomized Phase 2 study that showed FOLFIRINOX was associated with a high ORR 
(39% vs 11%) and manageable toxicity ( Ychou et al 2007).  The study was expanded to a 
Phase 3 study in which chemotherapy- naive subjects with metastatic pancreatic cancer were 
randomly assigned to gemcitabine alone versus the FOLFIR INOX regimen ( Conroy et al 2011).  
The study was stopped when a preplanned interim analysis demonstrated that the primary endpoint of OS had been met (median 11.1 months vs 6.8 months; HR 0.57; p < 0.001).  These 
data establish FOLFIRINOX as another standard-of-care option in treatment-naive patients with 
advanced pancreatic cancer with a good performance status ( NCCN  Guidelines ). 
The future role of immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer is less clear than t he evidence shown in 
melanoma and NSCLC.  Experience in the clinical settin g with immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_295082].   A 
Phase [ADDRESS_1253117]  also had an improvement in tumor markers and performance 
status ( Royal  et al 2010).  P ancreatic cancers have been shown to express PD -L1, which may be 
contributing to immune suppression and evasion.  PD- L1 expression in pancreatic cancer has 
also been shown to be associated with decreased tumor- infiltrating lymphocytes  and poor 
prognosis ( McDermott  and Atkins 2013).  
As there are currently no approved standard of care for patients with pancreatic cancer who have PD despi[INVESTIGATOR_588781]- line therapy, guidelines established by [CONTACT_894447] 
(NCCN  Guidelines , Seufferlein  et al 2012).  Because of  the lack of effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_894398], it is reasonable to provide an experimental therapy to patients who 
have failed approved first- line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_644371].

1.1.9. Squa mous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck 
In the [LOCATION_002] alone, approximately 55,070 people will develop head and neck cancer in 
the next year ( Cancer.net  2014).  Tobacco use and drinking alcohol greatly increase the risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_894399].  In addition, infection with HPV is associated with the 
development of head and neck cancer, and the incidence of HPV- associated SCCHN is on the 
rise.  Many patients present with localized disease that may be treated with either surgery or 
radiation therapy with curative intent ( Vermorken  and Specenier 2010).  Unfortunately, most 
patients will develop local recurrent disease , and about 20% to 30% of these patients will be 
diagnosed with distant metastases.  Treatment for recurrent/metastatic disease is typi[INVESTIGATOR_894400].  Single agents most 
commonly used as monotherapy in this setting (eg, methotrexate, cisplatin , and 5- FU) typi[INVESTIGATOR_318108] a short duration of response of only approximately 3 to 5 months.  Combination 
chemotherapy may be selected in patients with selected characteristics such as a good 
performance status ( NCCN  Guidelines ).  Response rates of combination therapy are generally 
improved over monotherapy; however, clinical study data have not proven an OS benefit when 
compared to methotrexate, cisplatin , or 5 -FU monotherapy ( Vermorken  and Specenier 2010 ), 
and these combinations may cause a significant increase in toxicity . 
Cetuximab, an agent targeting EGFR, is widely used in the [LOCATION_002]  and the EU in the 
setting of recurrent/metastatic disease .  In the U nited States  and EU, cetuximab is approved for 
use in recurrent locoregional or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in combination with platinum- based therapy with [ADDRESS_1253118] -line subjects  with SCCHN showed that the addition of cetuximab to platinum- based 
(cisplatin or carboplatin) therapy with 5-FU significantly improved OS from 7.4 months to 
10.1 months (HR = 0.80; p = 0.04).  Significant benefits were also seen in PFS and ORR; however, approximately 20% of subjects  in each arm discontinued due to AE s. 
PD-L1 has been shown to be expressed in the tumor microenvironment of SCCHN.  PD- L1 
staining by [CONTACT_894448]-positive tumors and HPV-negative tu mors , although HPV 
positivity does appear to correlate with a higher probability of PD-L1 expression in the tumor microenvironment ( Lyford -Pi[INVESTIGATOR_110069] 2013).  In early clinical studies , a subject  with metastatic 
SCCHN was tr eated with the anti −PD-L1 monoclonal antibody MDPL3280A experienced a 
response by [CONTACT_894449] ( Herbst  et al 2013).   More r ecent data studying the 
anti−PD-1 antibody MK-3475 in subjects  with PD-L1−positive SCCHN  has shown a best ORR  
of 19.6% using RECIST v1.1 ( Seiwert  et al 2014).  Additional studies of anti −PD-1 and 
anti−PD-L1 agents in the setting of metastatic SCCHN are ongoing.  
1.1.10. Triple -Negative Breast Cancer  
Triple -negative breast cancer accounts for approximately 20% of breast cancers diagnosed 
worldwide, or about 200, 000 cases each year ( Swain  2008).   A strong association has been found 
with African -American race, younger age, higher grade, premenopausal status, more advanced 
stage at diagnosis, and positive BRCA mutation status.  More than 75% of tumors displaying a positive BRCA mutation status are triple negative (Bayraktar  et al 2011).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_894401], TNBC has a poor prognosis as defined by [CONTACT_6398] 5-year survival and high recurrence rates after  adjuvant therapy.

Triple negative status is defined as tumors that lack expression of the ER and Pg R but express 
HER2  at normal levels .  The ASCO/CAP panel  guidelines for determining ER, PgR, and 
HER2  status were created to improve the accuracy of testing and are commonly us ed in clinical 
practice ( Hammond et  al 2010, Wolff et al 2013). 
Triple -negative breast cancer is described as "paradoxical " because of  the relatively high 
likelihood of response and pathologic CR but poorer overall outcomes.  The risk of distant 
recurrence in TNBC and death peaks approximately 3 years after diagnosis and declines rapi [INVESTIGATOR_894402] ( Liedtke et al  2008).   As compared with ER- positive breast cancers, TNBC has a 
higher rate of relapse and a higher risk for metastases to the lung  and brain  (Lin et al 2012).  
Unfortunate ly, since endocrine therapy and HER2 -directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_565954], t he only 
approved option for m etastatic TNBC is chemotherapy , which is associated with a median 
survival of < [ADDRESS_1253119] that PD- L1 is expressed in approximately 2 0% of patients with TNBC 
(Chawla et al 2014), and immunotherapy agents , including the anti- PD-1 antibody 
pembrolizumab, appear to be active in heavily pretreated patients with metastatic TNBC .  In a 
Phase 1b study, subjects with  PD-L1+ metastatic TNBC were treated with monotherapy 
pembrolizumab every 2 weeks.  Approximately 50% of subjects  on study had received ≥ 3 lines 
of therapy.  Of the 27 evaluable subjects , the ORR was 18.5%, median time to response was 
18 weeks, and the median duration of response had not been reached (range, 15- 40+ weeks) .  
Three of 5 responders at the time of analysis were on treatment for ≥ 11 months ( Buisseret  
et al 2015).  Additional  studies of both anti −PD-1 and anti −PD-L1 targeted agents are ongoing . 
1.1.11. Gastric and Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer 
In 2015, an estimated 24,590 and 16,980 patients  will be diagnosed with gastric and esophageal 
cancer , respectively , and approximately 26,310 men and women will eventually succumb to  their 
disease ( NCCN  2015).  The prognosis for both gastric and GE junction cancers remains 
overwhelmingly poor.  Five- year survival rate rates for patients with proximal gastric cancer are 
only 10% to 15%.  Locally advanced unresectable and metastatic gastroesophageal cancers are 
not curable, and typi[INVESTIGATOR_894403] a multidisciplina ry approach including 
surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Cisplatin is o ne of the most active agents for locally advanced metastatic esophageal cancer , with 
single -agent response rates of approximately 20% or higher.  Single- agent activity has also been 
observed with irinotecan, docetaxel, paclitaxel, and etoposide; however, cisplatin in combination 
with fluorouracil is the most commonly used regimen, resulting in response rates of 
approximately 20% to 50%.  Other combination chemotherapy regimens including oxaliplatin, 
carboplatin, mitomycin, and gemcitabine have been evaluated in advanced or metastatic 
esophageal cancer in the clinical trial setting ; however, no consistent benefit was seen for any 
specific chemotherapy regimen  (NCCN  2015).  
Recently, targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_894404].  Ramucirumab , a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor -[ADDRESS_1253120] supportive care plus ramucirumab or placebo.  
Median OS was 5.2 months in subjects  treated in the ramucirumab group compared to 
3.8 months for those in the placebo group (p = 0.047) ( Fuchs  et al 2014).  In a second study of 
ramucirumab in combination with paclitaxel, the combination resulted in significantly higher 
OS, PFS, and ORR than paclitaxel alone.  The median OS for the combination was 9.63 months 
as compared to  7.63 months in the paclitaxel -alone arm (p = 0.0001) ( NCCN 2015). 
In the near future, molecular characterization of upper GI tumors is expected to lead to  additional 
treatment options for patients with advanced disease.  HER2 -neu testing is currently  
recommended if metastatic disease i s documented or suspected.  In the ToGA study, t he addition 
of trastuzumab to chemotherapy in patients with HER2 -neu overexpression or amplification 
resulted in a significant improvement in OS  (13.8 vs 11.1 months, p = 0.046) ( Bang  et al 2010).  
This study established trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy as a new standard of care 
for patients with HER2 -neu−positive or met astatic gastric and esophagogastric junction 
adenocarcinoma.  
Recent clinical studies suggest that PD -[ADDRESS_1253121] clinical activity in 
gastric and GE junction tumors.  In a Phase 1b study, subjects with metastatic adenocarcinoma of 
the stomach or GE  junction received the anti −PD-1 treatment pembrolizumab every 2 weeks .  
The ORR  was 22% (95% CI, 10-39) by [CONTACT_401129] 33% by [CONTACT_107443].  Median 
time to response was 8 weeks (range, 7-16 weeks ), median duration of response was 24 weeks 
(range , 8+ to 33+ weeks ), and t he 6-month PFS rate was 24% ( Muro  et al 2015 ).  Additional 
studies with immunotherapy agents are ongoing. 
1.1.12. Transitional Cell Ca rcinoma  of the Genitourinary Tract  
Urothelial carcinomas , also referred to as TCC s, are the most common histologic al subtype in the 
[LOCATION_002].  Transitional cell carcinoma  may develop anywhere transitional epi[INVESTIGATOR_894405], from the renal pelvis to the ureter, bladder, and proximal two-thirds of the uret hra 
(NCCN  2015).   In the [LOCATION_002], approximately 75,000 new cases and 16,000 deaths occur 
each year due to bladder cancer ( Siegel  et al 2015).  Occupational  and environmental 
carcinogens as well as  tobacco use greatly increase risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_894406] .  In 
addition, s everal studies have suggested a relationship between TCC and HPV infection.  
A recent meta-analysis found that approximately 17% of bladder cancers are HPV-positive 
(Li et al 2011).  The life expectancy for patients with metastatic urothelial cancer is poor , with a 
median OS of [ADDRESS_1253122] elderly pat ient often includes gemcitabine  plus cisplatin or dose- dense methotrexate, 
vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin .  Alternatively , carboplatin, taxane- based regimens , or 
single -agent chemotherapy may be considered as well  (NCCN  2015).  Second- line chemotherapy 
data are highly variable, and treatment choices in this setting largely depend on the patient 's 
first-line treatment.  
More recently clinical activity has been observed with PD-1 and PD- L1 tar geted agents.  In the 
Phase 2 stu dy IMvigor210, subjects  who progressed after  treatment with a platinum- based 
chemotherapy were administered the anti −PD-L1 agent atezolizumab.  The ORR  was 15%

(p = 0.0058) for all subjects on study, 18% (p = 0.0004) for subjects  with PD -L1 expression 
≥ 1%, and 27% (p = 0.0001) in subjects  with PD -L1 expression ≥ 5%.  Median duration of 
response at the time of analysis had not yet been reached ; however, 92% (43 of 47) of responses 
were ongoing at 24 weeks  (Rosenberg et al 2015) .  In a separate Phase 1b study, 33 subjects  with  
PD-L1+ urothe lial tract tumors  of mostly transitional cell histology were administered 
monotherapy pembrolizumab.  The ORR by [CONTACT_510828] 24.1% , with 10.3% of subjects  
achieving CRs.  Duration of re sponse was 16 to 40+ weeks (median not reached), with 6 of the 
7 responders ongoing at the time of analysis.  The median PFS was 8.6 weeks and the median OS 
in all subjects  was 9.3 months (6-month OS rate, 58% ; Plimack  et al 201 4).  Several additional 
studies are ongoing to further evaluate the activity of PD-[ADDRESS_1253123].

1 dose of epacadostat  in investigator-sponsored studies. 
In Study INCB [ZIP_CODE]-101, the multiple-dose PK of epacadostat  was evaluated in subjects with 
refractory solid tumors at doses of 50 mg QD to 700 mg BID.  P harmacokinetic observations 
include the following and are summarized in Figure  1. 
• After oral dose administration in the fasted state, the peak plasma concentration of 
epacadostat was typi[INVESTIGATOR_894407] 2 hours postdose.  E pacadostat was eliminated 
with a geometric mean terminal disposition half -life of 2.9 hours. 
• Systemic accumulation after BID administration increased the mean epacadostat C max 
and AUC 0-t by 16% and 33%, respectively, suggesting an "effective" half -life of 4 to 
6 hours. 
• Increases in epacadostat C max and AUC 0-t were less than proportional to dose.  The 
slightly lower than dose-proportional relationship was most likely because of the limited rate and/or extent of intestinal absorption for this compound at higher doses. 
• A high -fat meal delayed epacadostat median T
max by [ADDRESS_1253125] to food. 
• Moderate intersubject variability was observed for epacadostat plasma exposure at the steady state after administration in the fasted state.  
• The highest steady -state mean unbound 0- to 24-hour AUC (2.2 μM∙h) observed in 
this study (700 mg BID dose group) was well below the NOAEL unbound AUC
0-24h 
of 7.9 μM∙h observed in the 28-day GLP toxicology study.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Summary of Epacadostat Pharmacodynamics in Humans  
Tryptophan and kynurenine levels were measured in plasma and in stimulated whole blood 
samples from Studies INCB [ZIP_CODE]-101, INCB [ZIP_CODE]-201, and INCB [ZIP_CODE]-210 as pharmacodynamic measures of the inhibition of IDO1 activity by [CONTACT_658634].  Whole blood 
samples were stimulated ex vivo with LPS and interferon -γ in order to increase the levels of 
IDO1 expression before measurement of tryptophan to kynurenine levels 24 hours later.  In 
addition, systemic changes in plasma markers of inflammation and lym phocyte subsets were 
monitored. 
Pharmacodynamic observations include the following: 
• Epacadostat administration effectively inhibits IDO1 enzyme activity, which is 
upregulated in many cancers and correlated with poor prognosis. 
• Inhibition of IDO1 is dose-dependent, and at doses at or above 300 mg BID, epacadostat ef fectively achieves maximal inhibition of IDO1 activity at trough, as 
assessed using changes in kynurenine levels.  
• Epacadostat inhibits IDO1 in all subjects, irrespective of cancer type.  
• The elevated kynurenine levels at baseline that are observed in cancer  subjects are 
reduced at first measure after onset of treatment with epacadostat.  The elevated 
kynurenine levels are reduced back to the range noted in normal healthy individuals 
in most subjects.  
• The pharmacodynamic effects of epacadostat are consistent with the PK.  
• No significant changes in peripheral blood immune cell subsets or immune plasma 
proteins have been noted, suggesting that IDO1 inhibition does not elicit global changes in the peripheral immune system.  
Figure  2 summarizes the changes in plasma kynurenine levels observed in Study 
INCB  [ZIP_CODE]-101.  The levels of IDO1 inhibition are quantified in Table 1.

synergize with blockade of PD-1/PD -L1 in delaying tumor growth and increasing OS 
(Holmgaard  et al 2013).   Many recent clinical results suggest that a common rate -limiting step is 
the expression of PD-L1 as a distal immune modulator expressed in 20% to 50% of human 
cancer ( Hiraoka et al [ADDRESS_1253126]  et al 2013), including but not limited to the ones selected for 
investigation in this study:  advanced or metastatic NSCLC, melanoma, pancreatic cancer  
(Phase 1 only), SCCHN , TNBC, gastric or  GE junction cancer, and TCC of the GU tract .  
Expression of IDO and PD-1/L1 have been found to be increased in NSCLC as the disease progresses, and expression of these markers in tumor cells has been associated with shorter 
subject survival ( Iversen  et al 2014).  Anti−PD-L1 and anti −PD-1 monotherapy response rates of 
approximately 20% have been reported in refractory NSCLC ( Garon  et al 2015 , Brahmer  
et al 2013) with a survival median of approximately  [ADDRESS_1253127] 50% of tumor cells, the reported response rate was 45.2% with a median 
PFS of 6.3 months.  At the time of analysis, OS had not yet been reached ( Garon  et al 2015 ). 
In APR 2018, the ECHO- 301/KEYNOTE -252 study, a P hase 3 trial evaluating the anti–PD -[ADDRESS_1253128] lin e treatment in subjects with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, underwent a 
preplanned eDMC review.  This eDMC review concluded that the co-primary endpoint of 
improvement in progression- free survival was not met (HR  = 1.00; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.21) and that 
the co -primary endpoint of improvement in overall survival was also not expected to reach 
statistical significance (HR = 1.13; 95% CI 0.86 to 1.49).  Based on these results, and on the recommendation of the eDMC, the study was stopped.  The safety profile observed in the 
ECHO- 301/KEYNOTE -[ADDRESS_1253129] exceeded the 50% inhibitory concentration for the 
IDO1 enzyme in cells (7 nM) by [CONTACT_8622] 370-fold in the absence of any toxicity, so the risk of unintended pharmacological activity is expected to be low.  In the Phase 1 clinical study in 
subjects with refractory solid tumors (INCB  [ZIP_CODE]-101), epacadostat  was well tolerated with a 
single SAE of radiation pneumonitis (also considered a DLT)  in a subject with  mediastinal 
metastas is of endometrial cancer , 1 report of asymptomatic and re versible hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_894408] , and 1 event of Grade 3 fatigue determined by [CONTACT_894450] a DLT.  Preliminary data from study INCB  [ZIP_CODE]-201 (evaluating the combination of epa cadostat  and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]) suggest that 
epacadostat  doses ≤ 50 mg BID were well tolerated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] .  In the 50 mg BID 
continuous cohort, 4 DLTs (Grade 3 diarrhea, Grade 3 ALT/AST elevation, Grade 3 colitis, and Grade 3 pneumonitis) in  18 subjects  were reported.  Immune- related AEs were reversible with 
appropriate management.  The initial evaluation of epacadostat  300 mg BID in combination with 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_165822] 3 or 4 ALT/AST elevation in 5 of 
7 subjects treated at this dose.  These AEs were reversible in all subjects upon discontinuation of 
study therapy and institution of corticosteroids based on an established protocol for the 
management of immune toxicities related to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_224].  Treatment -emergent AEs  were 
reported in 100% of subjects administered  25 mg BID, 50 mg BID, 50 mg intermittent, 75 mg

Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 203 Amendment 7  Version 7  21 SEP 2018  
total daily dose, and 300 mg BID of epacadostat in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  
Treatment -emergent AEs occurring in ≥ 20% of patients overall included fatigue (n = 29 [69%]), 
constipation and nausea (n = 13 [31%] each), decreased appetite and headache (n  = 11 [26%] 
each) , and vomiting (n = 10 [24%]) ( Gibney et al 2015). 
A potential concern of IDO1  inhibition is  an increase in ser otonin levels that could precipi[INVESTIGATOR_047] a 
cluster of AEs termed SS when administered alone or in combination with other serotonergic agents.  This rare syndrome has been associated with some MAOIs and combinations of 
serotonergic drugs ( Boyer  and Shannon 2005).  The clinical manifestations of SS range from 
barely perceptible to lethal; onset is rapid (within 12 hours of drug[s] administration).  Preclinical data suggest that SS is unlikely after treatment with either epacadostat alon e or with 
combination with MAOIs such as linezolid ( Zhang  et al 2016).  As of 27 FEB 2017, 2 subjects 
across the epacadostat program (958 subjects treated) have reported non-serious SS or symptoms of SS, and both were mild in their severity and resolved. 
1.3.2. Risks From Durvalumab 
Risks associated with durvalumab monotherapy and in combination are provided below.  
Additional safety information can be found in the durvalumab Investigator Brochure ( mIB). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Possible  Risks Based on Mechanism of Action 
Durvalumab, an anti −PD-L1 antibody, binds with high affinity and specificity to PD-L1 and 
blocks its binding to PD-1 and CD80, thus promoting antitumor immunity and tumor cell killing.  
Potential risks based on the mecha nism of action of durvalumab and related molecules include 
immune -mediated reactions such as enterocolitis, pneumonitis, dermatitis, hepatotoxicity, 
endocrinopathy, and neuropathy. 
A hypothetical risk exists for agents that activate the immune system by [CONTACT_894451], such as CD28 ( Suntharalingam et al 2006 ).  Such agents 
have an increased potential to trigger systemic, nonspecific activation of T cells since they can 
exert their effects in the absence of any antigen -specific T -cell receptor signals.  In contrast, 
agents that act via antagonism of an inhibitory pathway modulate an existing antigen- specific 
T-cell receptor signal and have a limited potential to drive systemic, nonspecific activation of 
T cells.  This is exemplified clinically by [CONTACT_894452] -4 and PD-1, which are not 
associated with acute, severe adverse effects, such as cytokine storm ( Brahmer  et al 2010, 
Berger  et al 2008, Wolchok et al 2010).  Like these molecules, durvalumab antagonizes an 
inhibitory receptor (PD-L1).  As such, in the absence of an antigen- specific T -cell receptor 
signal, inhibition of function of PD- L1 is not anticipated to elicit any response.  This expectation 
is supported by [CONTACT_894453] −PD-L1 antibodies in the absence of a 
T-cell receptor stimulus ( Dong et al 200 2).  To assess directly the potential of durvalumab to 
induce a release of cytokines, cytokine release assays were conducted in human whole blood.  
Durvalumab did not induce release of any cytokine from any donor at any concentration tested.  
These results support that, consi stent with its mechanism of action as a PD -L1 antagonist, 
durvalumab is not expected to induce acute cytokine release in humans.  Nevertheless, the 
durvalumab first -time-in-human study design took into account the unlikely possibility of a 
cytokine release event by [CONTACT_7661] a low starting dose, extensive monitoring, and cytokine 
sampling.  To further mitigate the risk to subjects, vital signs will be monitored every [ADDRESS_1253130] infusion of durvalumab.  Thus, 
the target occupancy will be well controlled with ample opportunity for observation, cessation of 
treatment, or intervention, if necessary. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Possibl e Risks Based on Clinical Data  
As of 12 JUL 2015, > [ADDRESS_1253131] been treated across the ongoing durvalumab 
(MEDI4736) studies, including sponsored studies and collaborative studies.  The majority of 
subjects have been treated with monotherapy durvalumab (n  = 1279); however, [ADDRESS_1253132] received MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab or other anticancer agents, 
14 received other agents (1 gefitinib, 13 MEDI6383), and 150 subjects were blinded ( mIB). 
The safety profile of durvalumab as monotherapy and combined with other anticancer agents 
was consistent with the pharmacology of the target and other agents in the immune checkpoint inhibitor class.  No tumor types appeared to be associated with unique AEs.  Immune- related  
AEs, which are important risks of immune checkpoint inhibitors, have been observed with 
durvalumab and include colitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis/hepatotoxicity, neuropathy/neuromuscular 
toxicity, endocrinopathy, dermatitis, and nephritis. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Risks of Durvalumab Monotherapy  
Risks with durvalumab monotherapy include diarrhea, colitis, pneumonitis/ interstitial lung 
disease, endocrinopathies ( eg, hypo - and hyperthyroidism, T ype I DM, diabetes insipi[INVESTIGATOR_27562], 
hypophysitis, and adrenal insufficiency), hepatitis/hepatotoxicity/increases in transaminases, 
neurotoxicities, nephritis/increases in creatinine, pancreatitis, rash/pruritus/dermatitis,  
infusion- related reactions, anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity or allergic reactions, myocarditis , and 
immune complex disease.  
Further information on the identified and potential risks can be found in the current version of 
the durvalumab IB ( mIB). 
In monotherapy clinical studies, very commonly reported (≥ 10% of subjects) AEs of all grades 
are fatigue, nausea, de creased appetite, dyspnea, cough, constipation, diarrhea, vomiting, back 
pain, pyrexia, abdominal pain, anemia, arthralgia, peripheral edema, headache, rash, and pruritus.  
Approximately 8% of subjects  experienced an AE that resulted in permanent discontinuation of 
durvalumab, and approximately 5% of subjects  experienced an SAE that was considered to be 
related to durvalumab by [CONTACT_1704]. 
The majority of treatment- related AEs were manageable with dose delays, symptomatic 
treatment, and , in the case of events suspected to have an immune basis, the use of established 
treatment guidelines for immune -mediated toxicity (see Section  5.6.3).  
A detailed summary of durvalumab monotherapy AE data can be found in the current version of 
the durvalumab IB ( mIB). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Possible Risks Based on Nonclinical Data  
Nonclinical studies have demonstrated that durvalumab partially suppressed the primary 
antibody response to a T- cell−dependent antigen (KLH).  Secondary antibody responses to this 
antigen were normal.  The relevance of this finding with respect to a human immune response is

1.4. Justification for Treatment Regimen  
The goal of the present study is to explore doses of epacadostat  that may synergize or otherwise 
augment the efficacy observed with the PD -L1 inhibitor durvalumab in subjects with advanced 
cancer.  The established regimen of durvalumab ( 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg once every 14 days) will 
be combined with doses of epacadostat  that provide partial and more complete IDO1 inhibition 
based on observations from the Phase 1 study (INCB [ZIP_CODE]-101).  The initial dose selected for 
epacadostat  in combination with durvalumab is 25 mg BID with escalation to 300 mg BID.  This 
is based on the preliminary observation that the average kynurenine inhibition for epacadostat  
25 mg BID and 300 mg BID are 66% and > 94%, respectively, and the safety of these doses, as well as doses up to 700 mg BID in the Phase 1 monotherapy study and in combination with 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_894409]  [ZIP_CODE]-201.  Dose escalation of epacadostat  will evaluate 25  mg BID, 
50 mg BID, 75 mg BID, 100 mg BID, and 300 mg BID.  This dose ra nge will span a range of 
average inhibition of IDO1 from approximately 40% (at 25 mg BID dosing) to 60% (50 mg BID dosing) to 89% (100 mg BID dosing) and 94% (300 mg BID dosing), based on pharmacodynamic testing.  Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic observations from 
Studies INCB [ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_1253133].  
The 200 mg dose level of epacadostat  will not be explored in combination with durvalumab 
based on PK and pharma codynamic considerations.  The results from Study INCB [ZIP_CODE]-101 
demonstrated that epacadostat displays mildly sublinear exposure-dose response, as shown in Figure  3 and Table 3.  It is likely that there would be significant overlap in exposure at 200 mg 
compared to both 100 mg and 300 mg dose steps.  Furthermore, inhibition of IDO1 is well described by [CONTACT_1629] E
max model that  is fundamentally nonlinear, especially beyond the inhibition 
> 80%.  Any incremental increase in IDO1 inhibition begins to level off and would be insensitive 
to further increased epacadostat concentration.  Our pharmacodynamic model estimates  Iave 
increases from 83% to 89% with dose steppi[INVESTIGATOR_52857] 100 mg to 300 mg BID, which justifies not 
exploring the 200 mg intermediate dose in combination with durvalumab.

population that has significant comorbidities.  
It should be noted that the initial evaluation of epacadostat at  300 mg BID in combination with 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (Study INCB [ZIP_CODE]-201) was terminated due to the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 
ALT/AST elevation in [ADDRESS_1253135] 
elevation was observed.  Four DLTs (Grade 3 diarrhea, Grade 3 colitis, Grade 3 pneumonitis, 
and Grade 3 ALT /AST  elevation) have been  observed in the 50 mg BID continuous dosing 
cohort among  18 evaluable subjects,  and 1 occurrence of Grade 3 colitis has been observed in the 
50 m g BID  intermittent dosing cohort (2 weeks on/1 week off) among  9 evaluable patients .  In 
the 75 mg total daily dose cohort (50 mg every morning and 25 mg every evening ), there was 
[ADDRESS_1253136] common all- grade irAEs were 
rash ( 52.4%), pruritus (38.1%), diarrhea (33.3%), increased ALT  and AST ( 21.4% and 16.7% ), 
and hypothyroidism (11.9%).  irAEs ≥ Grade 3 occurring in >  [ADDRESS_1253137] elevation and 
colitis (n  = 4 [9.5%] each) and ALT elevation (n = 3 [7.1%]).  Other treatment -emergent AEs 
occurring in ≥ 20% of subjects  overall included fatigue (n = 29 [69%]); constipation and nausea 
(n = 13 [31%] each); decreased appetite and headache (n  = 11 [26%] each); and vomiting (n = 10 
[24%]; Gibney et al 2015).  Adverse events reported in this study were consistent with what has been reported previous ly in subjects treated  with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_79285]  (iIB).  Complete 
inhibition of the IDO1 target is not required for maximally effective activity in preclinical 
models.  As monotherapy, maximally effective doses in nonclinical models result in exposures 
that are comparable to doses of [ADDRESS_1253138] v1.1 (mRECIST v1.1).  Modified 
RECIST v1.1 will also be used by [CONTACT_894454].  Imaging will be collected and held for possible future central imaging vendor assessment.  
Immunotherapeutic agent s such as durvalumab work to enhance antitumor immune responses 
and these response patterns may lead to a clinical benefit ( eg, CR, PR, SD) after an initial 
increase in tumor burden that may be classified as PD by [CONTACT_330401] 
(Wolchok et  al 2009).  Standard RECIST criteria may not provide an adequate response 
assessment of immunotherapeutic agents such as durvalumab.  Therefore, RECIST v1.1 will be 
used with the following modification (and defined as mRECIST v1.1). 
Progressive disease should be confirmed a minimum of [ADDRESS_1253139] the option of continuing study treatment per the 
investigator's discretion while waiting for radiologic confirmation of progression. 
Clinically stable for this purpose is defined by t he following criteria:  
• Absence of signs and symptoms indicating disease progression. 
• No decline in ECOG performance status. 
• Absence of rapid progression of disease. 
• Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites ( eg, spi[INVESTIGATOR_6710]) requiring urgent alternative medical intervention . 
Subjects who are deemed clinically unstable are not required to have repeat imaging for 
confirmation of PD .  Additional information regarding mRECIST v1.[ADDRESS_1253140] ELIGIBILITY

4. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
4.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase 1/2 open-label study of epacadostat  administered in combination with 
durvalumab in subjects with advanced  melanoma, NSCLC, pancreatic cancer  (Phase 1 only), 
SCCHN , TNBC, gastric or GE junction cancer, or TCC of the GU tract .  The dose- escalation 
part of the study (Phase 1) uses a 3 + [ADDRESS_1253156] of 3 periods: 
Screening:   Up to 28 days. 
Treatment Period:   The treatment period will continue  every [ADDRESS_1253157] not met any criteria for study 
withdrawal as defined in Section 5.7.1.  Once subjects complete 12 months of study treatment or 
permanently discontinue study treatment for any other reason, the EOT visit should be 
conducted, and they should enter the follow-up period of the study. 
Follow- Up P eriod :  The safety follow -up visits will occur at 42 days (± 7 days)  and 90 days 
(± 7 days)  after the  EOT visit or the last dose of study treatment if the EOT visit is not 
completed . 
4.1.1. Phase 1 Dose Escalation 
Phase 1 is the dose-escalation phase, which will include up to 6 cohorts of subjects treated with 
epacadostat  at doses of 25 mg BID, 50 mg BID, 75 mg BID, 100 mg BID, and 300 mg BID in 
combination with durvalumab 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg given on Day [ADDRESS_1253158] 75% of the doses 
(63 doses) and have received at least [ADDRESS_1253159] experienced a DLT to be evaluable for dose tolerability.  Additional subjects will 
be enrolled in a cohort to achieve the minimum of 3 evaluable subjects if dropouts or dose 
interruptions/reductions occur that result in a subject being nonevaluable for DLTs. 
The dose of epacadostat  will be escalated if [ADDRESS_1253160] 3 evaluable subjects enrolled experience a DLT, the cohort will be 
expanded to include 3 additional evaluable subjects.  If 2 or more of either  3 or 6 subjects 
enrolled experience a DLT, the prior dose level will be considered the MTD.   If only 3 subjects 
were treated at this dose level, the dose will be confirmed as the MTD by [CONTACT_894436] 3 subjects before this dose is recommended for Phase 2 testing. 
The cohorts and dose levels are shown in Table 4.

During the study, dose interruptions and/or dose decreases may be implemented based on 
toxicity as described in Section 5.6. 
For the definition of DLT, see Section 5.5.1. 
All subjects who received epacadostat  and durvalumab in the dose- escalation phase and remain 
on study treatment will be observed for at least [ADDRESS_1253161] will be enrolled at the MTD or PAD of 
epacadostat  in combination with durvalumab.  More than 1 PAD may be evaluated in Phase 2.  
The approximate number of subjects needed for the melanoma, TNBC, and gastric and GE 
junction cancer cohorts will be determined using the Simon 2-stage design:  Stage 1 will be the 
initial number of subjects per tumor type, and the decision to proceed with Stage 2 will be 
determined by [CONTACT_894437] 1 (further number of subjects to be enrolled in 
each stage per tumor type is detailed in Table 5).  If more than 1 PAD is evaluated, the cohort 
may or may not be repeated for the specified tumor type as indicated in Table 5.  The sponsor 
may limit enrollment of a specific tumor type to Stage 1.

4.2. Study  Endpoints  
4.2.1. Primary Endpoints  
• Phase 1:  MTD or PAD.  The MTD is defined by [CONTACT_894459] [ADDRESS_1253169] Protocol-defined dose for 
each agent in the absence of exceeding the MTD.   Alternatively, the PAD is defined 
as a tolerated dose of epacadostat  (in combination with durvalumab) that produces 
substantial pharmacological target inhibition.   Safety and tolerability will be assessed 
by [CONTACT_190060], duration, and severity of AEs, through physical 
examinations, by [CONTACT_658643], and through clinical 
laboratory blood and urine sample evaluations. 
• Phase 2:  Objective response rate determined by [CONTACT_894460] v1.1 described in Section s 1.5.1 and 7.4. 
4.2.2. Secondary Endpoints  
• Phase 1:  Objective res ponse rate determined by [CONTACT_894461] v1.1. 
• Phase 2:  Safety and tolerability of the combination as assessed by [CONTACT_190060], duration, and severity of AEs, through physical examinations, by [CONTACT_894462], and through clinical laboratory blood and 
urine sample evaluations . 
• Phases 1 and 2:  Durability of response determined by [CONTACT_894463]  
• Phases 1 and 2:  PFS  determined from the date of randomization until disease 
progression or death. 
• Phases 1 and 2:  The endpoints for assessment of PK of durvalumab and epacadostat  
include individual durvalumab and epacadostat  concen trations and PK parameters. 
• Phases 1 and 2:  The  endpoints for assessment of immunogenicity of durvalumab 
include the number and percentage of subjects who develop detectable ADA s.

self-administered except the days scheduled to be given at the study clinic ( see Section  7.6).  
Epacadostat  should be taken just prior to beginning the infusion of durvalumab  on days given in 
clinic.  Epacadostat  will be given daily in combination with durvalumab for up to [ADDRESS_1253171]'s weight in kilograms.  
Durvalumab will be administered in the clinic as an IV infusion of 3 mg/kg or  10 mg/kg once 
every  [ADDRESS_1253172] dose escalation of durvalumab is not permitted  
except as defined in Section 5.6.1. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Durvalumab Treatment Administration  
Durvalumab will be administered as an IV infusion over approximately 60 minutes 
(± 5 min utes).  The IV line will be flushed with a volume of normal saline equal to the priming 
volume of the infusion set used after the contents of the IV bag are fully administered (unless 
prohibited by [CONTACT_894464]).  No incompatibilities have been observed between 
durvalumab and polypropylene, polyethylene, polyolefin copolymers, or polyvinylchloride. 
Since the compatibility of durvalumab with other IV medications and solutions, other than 
normal saline (0.9% [w/v] sodium chloride for injection), is not known, the durvalumab solution 
should not be infused through an IV line in which other solutions or medications are being administered.  The date, start time, interruption, and completion time of durvalumab 
administration must be recorded in the source documents. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Monitoring of Durvalumab Administration  
Subjects will be monitored during and after infusion with assessment of vital signs at the 
beginning of the infusion (± 5 minutes), every 15 minutes (± 5 minutes) during the infusion of 
durvalumab, at the end of infusion (± 5 minutes), and at 30 minutes  (± 5 minutes) and 
60 minutes (± 5 minutes) postinfusion.  Subjects  will be monitored during a 3-hour 
(± 15 minutes) postinfusion period of observation after the first dose of durvalumab only.  For 
subsequent doses, the 3-hour observation period will not be required unless a subject experiences

an infusion-related reaction.  If the infusion takes longer than 60 minutes, then the vital signs 
assessments should follow the principles as described above. 
In the event of ≤ Grade 2 infusion-related reaction, the infusion rate of durvalumab may be 
decreased by 50% or interrupted until resolution of the event (up to 4 hours) and reinitiated at 50% of the initial rate until completion of the infusion.  In subjects experiencing ≤ Grade 2 
infusion-related reaction, subsequent infusions may be administered at 50% of the initial rate.  Acetaminophen and/or an antihistamine (eg, diphenhydramine) or equivalent medications per institutional standard may be administered at the discretion of the investigator.  If the 
infusion- related reaction is ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_1253173] will 
enter the safety follow-up period (s ee Section 6.4). 
Protocol Amendment 6 (28 JUN 2017) removed the option for subjects to receive epacadostat monotherapy once they completed [ADDRESS_1253174].  These subjects will be allowed to continue epacadostat monotherapy 
for up to an additional 12 months, and their maximum overall study treatment duration should 
not exceed 24 months.  Exceptions for these subjects to continue study treatment beyond 24 months will require medical monitor review and approval every 3 months. 
Study participation is expected to average about 6  months.

5.5. Rationale  for Dose Modification  
The purpose of the dose-escalation portion of the study (Phase 1) is to establish a suitable dose of 
epacadostat  in combination with durvalumab. 
A 42-day DLT window, along with regular internal reviews of safety events, will be used for the 
dose-escalation phase of the study.  While the rules for adjudicating DLTs in the context of dose escalation/cohort expansion are specified in Section 5.5.1, an AE not listed above, or an AE 
meeting the DLT criteria above but occurring outside of the DLT period, may be defined as a DLT after consultat ion between the sponsor and investigator, based on the emerging safety 
profile.  The final recommended dose for the dose-expansion phase will be based on the review 
of the safety and tolerability data, including cumulative toxicity from available cohorts. 
Independent of the determination of tolerability during Phase [ADDRESS_1253175] at the same dose level.  Grading of 
DLTs will be ac cording to the NCI CTCAE v4.0.  A DLT will be defined as the occurrence of 
any treatment -related toxicity  described in Table 7  occurring up to and including S tudy Day 42 
(6-week observation period).  Only toxicities with a clear alternative explanation (eg, due to 
disease progression, comorbid conditions, concomitant medications) or transient (≤ 72 hours) 
abnormal laboratory values without associated clinically significant signs or symptoms based on investigator determination can be deemed non -DLT.   Grade 3 irAEs  (excluding ocular, 
pneumonitis, or colitis) that improve to ≤ Grade [ADDRESS_1253176] experienced recurrent dose 
interruptions and/or reductions will be considered in the determination of the study drug doses to be used in Phase 2.

meet DLT criteria defined above.  
• If subjects are unable to receive 75% of epacadostat  or 3 doses of durvalumab  during the DLT observation period 
because of drug -related toxicity, even if the toxicity does not meet DLT criteria defined above.  
• While the rules for adjudicating DLTs in the context of dose escalation are specified abov e, an AE not listed 
above may be defined as a DLT after a consultation with the sponsor and investigators, based on the emerging 
safety profile.  
a Immune -related AEs are defined as AEs of an immune nature (ie, inflammatory) in the absence of a clear alternative etiology.  
In the absence of a clinically significant abnormality, repeat laboratory testing will be conducted to confirm significant 
laboratory findings prior to designation as a DLT.  
5.5.2. Procedures for Cohort Review and Dose Escalation in Phase 1  
Telephone conferences will be scheduled by [CONTACT_165908] 1 investigators in order to 
review cohort -specific data, overall safety data from prior cohorts (if applicable), and to agree on 
dose escalation.  For additional safety oversight, this group will review and adjudicate individual 
high-grade AEs as potentially dose- limiting and for guiding the study team on decisions 
regarding dose escalation and cohort expansion.  The same method will be employed for 
reviewing data in Phase 1 to determine the recommended dose for Phase 2.

Subjects whose treatment is discontinued due to a DLT must be followed until resolution or 
stabilization of the DLT event, whichev er comes first.  
5.6. Dose Adjustment  of Study Drug  
5.6.1. Planned Dose Increases  
Cohort dose escalation is described in Section 4.1.1. 
Intrasubject dose escalations of epacadostat  are not permitted.  
Intrasubject dose escalat ion of durvalumab to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks will be allowed only for 
subjects who were enrolled into the study at a dose of durvalumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, 
provided that the following criteria are met:  
• The Protocol inclusion criteria are met . 
• The subject  has not experienced related or possibly related toxicity ≥ Grade 2. 
• The next dose level of epacadostat  25 mg BID and durvalumab 10 mg/kg has been 
determined to be safe based on DLT rules (eg, no DLTs during the DLT observation period). 
• The subject is willing to submit to the PK  sampling schedule and 
durvalumab infusion observation as in Cycle 1. 
• In the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the subject does not have any concurrent condition or circumstance that would complicate the dose escalation  or PK sampling, or pose 
increased risk to the subject . 
• The intrasubject dose escalation has been approved by [CONTACT_456]. 
Note that if a subject dose escalates and experiences toxicity, guidance for dose interruption is provided in Sections 5.6.[ADDRESS_1253178] be 
implemented with the indicated related AEs.  Additional information related to dose changes and 
AE management for irAEs can be found in Section 5.6.3. 
In general, treatment with both study drugs should be withheld for ≥ Grade 3 irAEs  or non-irAEs  
and may be withheld for ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_1253179].  There will be no dose reductions of durvalumab allowed for the 
management of toxicities of individual subjects (exception noted in Section 5.6.1).  Dos es of

Note:  There may be some circumstances where, due to toxicity  attributed to epacadostat , a 
subject may not tolerate the combination therapy but may benefit from monotherapy with 
durvalumab.  These cases must be discussed and approved by [CONTACT_894466]. 
Any interruptions of > [ADDRESS_1253181] be discussed with the medical 
monitor prior to resuming treatment.  
Except in cases of emergency, it is recomm ended that the investigator consult with the medical 
monitor (or other representative of the sponsor) before temporarily interrupting therapy for reasons other than Protocol-mandated medication hold.  Additionally, the investigator must 
notify the sponsor' s medical monitor and study project manager via email before  restarting study 
drug that was interrupted for > 4 weeks due to  an AE.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Procedures and Guidelines for Pneumonitis  
Subjects with symptomatic pneumonitis should immediately stop receiving durvalumab and 
epacadostat  and have an evaluation.  Subjects should be monitored for signs and symptoms of 
pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease.  The evaluation may include  imaging  (high resolution 
CT scan) , bronchoscopy, and pulmonary function tests such as monitoring of oxygenation via 
pulse oximetry (resting and exertion) and laboratory  work -up to rule out other causes such as 
infection.  If the subject is determined to have study drug −associated pneumonitis, the suggested 
treatment plan is detailed in Table 10.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Procedures for Immune -Mediated Neuropathies  
Subjects  should be evaluated to rule out any alternative etiology (eg, disease progression, 
infections, metabolic syndromes, or medications).  Monitor subjects for symptoms of motor or 
sensory neuropathy such as unilateral or bilateral weakness, sensory alterations, behavior 
changes, headache, nausea, vertigo, or paresthesia.  Consider appropriate diagnostic testing 
(eg, electr omyogram and nerve conduction investigations).  Perform symptomatic treatment with 
neurological consult as appropriate.  Recommendations for the management of immune -mediated neuropathies are shown in Table 14. 
For any grade immune-mediated peripheral neuromotor syndromes, such as Guillain- Barré 
syndrome and myasthenia gravis, the following precautions should be followed: 
• The prompt diagnosis of immune-mediated peripheral neuromotor syndromes is 
important, since certain subjects may unpredictably experience acute 
decompensations that can result in substantial morbidity or, in the worst case, death.  
Special care should be taken for certain sentinel symptoms that may predict a more 
severe outcome, such as prominent dysphagia, rapi[INVESTIGATOR_27567], and signs of respi[INVESTIGATOR_83741]. 
• Subjects should be evaluated to rule out any alternative etiology (eg, disease progression, infections, metabolic syndromes, and medications).  It should be noted 
that the diagnosis of immune-mediated peripheral neuromotor syndromes can be 
particularly challenging in patients with underlying cancer, due to the multiple potential confounding effects of cancer (and its treatments) throughout the neuraxis.  
Given the importance of prompt and accurate diagnosis, it is essential to have a low 
threshold to obtain a neurological consult. 
• Neurophysiologic diagnostic testing (eg, electromyogram, nerve conduction 
investigations, and "repetitive stimulation ," if myast henia is suspected) is routinely 
indicated upon suspi[INVESTIGATOR_213167] a 
neurology consultation. 
• It is important to consider that the use of steroids as the primary treatment of 
Guillain -Barré syndrome is not typi[INVESTIGATOR_27574].  Subjects requiring 
treatment should be started with IVIG, followed by [CONTACT_27697].

5.6.4. Procedures for Subjects Exhibiting Serotonin Syndrome  
As noted in Section 1.3.1, there is a rare chance that epacadostat  could cause an increase in 
serotonin levels in the brain that might trigger SS ( Boyer  and Shannon 2005) when administ ered 
in combination with other serotonergic agents.  This syndrome has been most closely associated 
with use of MAOIs, meperidine, linezolid, or methylene blue; all of these agents are prohibited during the study ( see Section  5.10.2).  Selective s erotonin reuptake inhibitors and SNRIs are 
permitted during the study.  Serotonin syndrome usually manifests with autonomic changes, 
mental status changes, and neurological findings.  These mild, moderate, and severe sign s and 
symptoms of SS (summarized in  Table 22) should be evaluated in the context of possible 
comorbid conditions as well.

Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 203 Amendment 7  Version 7  21 SEP 2018  
The following procedures will be implemented if subjects exhibit the signs/symptoms of SS 
described in  Table 22, including tremor, hyperreflexia, and spontaneous ocular or inducible 
clonus together with agitation, fever, diaphoresis, or muscle rigidity:  
• Immediately interrupt study treatment administration . 
• Immediately interrupt any SSRI or SNRI administration . 
• Provide appropriate medical management of the subject until all signs/symptoms are 
resolved ( eg, IV fluids and/or sympathomimetic amines for hypotension, 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_165836], administration of 5 -hydroxytryptamine antagonists 
such as cyproheptadine). 
• If etiologies other than SS  are excluded, durvalumab administration may be resumed 
once all signs and symptoms have resolved unless other AE management guidelines 
apply for the specific event  (eg, immune -mediated neurotoxicities) . 
• If the subject chooses to remain in the study, restart dosing with epacadostat  after the 
SSRI or SNRI has been discontinued, no sooner than [ADDRESS_1253194] elapsed for the 
specific SSRI or SNRI in question, and after res olution of signs/symptoms of SS.  
The SSRI or SNRI dosing MAY NOT be restarted. 
• If the subject chooses to discontinue the study, or must restart treatment with SSRI or 
SNRI, subject should be scheduled for a follow- up visit.  SSRI or SNRI treatment 
may be initiated 2 weeks after resolution of signs and symptoms of SS. 
• If a subject has experienced moderate or severe unconfounded SS in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_13046], without concomitant SSRI or SNRI usage or serotonergic 
concomitant medications, epacadostat treatment should be permanently discontinued.  
Durvalumab administration may be resumed with medical monitor approval once all signs and symptoms have resolved.

received up to 28 days prior to enrollment will be recorded in the CRF.  Concomitant 
treatments/procedures that are required to manage a subject's medical condition during the study will also be recorded in the CRF.   Concomitant medications administered as treatment 
prophylaxis (eg, for the management of infusion reactions) should also be recorded in the CRF. 
5.10.1. Restricted Medications  and Measures  
• Systemic steroids may be used at doses ≤ 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent with 
medical monitor approval. 
• Use of coumarin-based anticoagulants ( eg, warfarin) is discouraged.  Low-dose 
warfarin (1 mg) is acceptable; however, doses t hat increase the INR are discouraged  
and will require a dose modification.  If an alternative to coumarin -based 
anticoagulants cannot be used, investigators should follow the guidelines in Table [ADDRESS_1253198]'s dose of 
coumarin -based anticoagulant upon initiating therapy with epacadostat .

− Note:  Administration  of epacadostat on the morning of a pr ocedure where 
propofol may be administered is permitted ; however, the evening dose after the 
procedure should be held, and subjects may resume regular dosing the following 
day. 
• Administration of live attenuated vaccines is prohibited from [ADDRESS_1253199] 
dose of study treatment through 30 days after the final dose of durvalumab.  
Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following:  measles, 
mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette –Guérin , typhoid 
vaccine, and intranasal influenza vaccines.  
• Administration of  inactivated  vaccines (including the injectable influenza vaccine)  is 
prohibited during the DLT observation period (ie, 42 days after Cycle 1 Day 1). 
6. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
All study assessments will be performed as indicated  in the schedule of assessments 
(see Table 24)  and laboratory assessments ( see Table  25).  The required analytes for each 
laboratory test are shown in Table 26.  The order of assessments is suggested by [CONTACT_894475]. 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_1253200] be collected at peak 
exposure after the morning epacadostat dose (approximately 2-3 hours after dosing) and a peripheral whole blood sample should be collected at the same time as the biopsy.  
Additionally, one of the subject’s target lesions may be used to collect this sample if it is the most accessible for biopsy  (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS].1). 
i Imaging will be performed every 12 weeks scheduled from C1D1. 
j If a scan was obtained within 4 weeks before the date of discontinuation, then a scan at treatment discontinuation isn't mandatory.  In subjects who discontinue study therapy 
without confirmed disease progression, a radiologic evaluation should be repeated at the time of treatment discontinuation (i e, dat e of discontinuation ± 4 week window).  
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_1253201]  who fails  screening may repeat the screening 
process 1 time  if the investigator believes there  has been a change in eligibility status 
(eg, followin g recovery from an infection). 
6.2. Treatment Period  
The treatment period with the combination therapy will continue every 14 days for up to 
12 months.  Once subjects complete 12 months of study treatment or permanently discontinue 
study treatment for any other reason , the EOT  visit should be conducted, an d they should enter 
the follow-up period of the study.  Subjects enrolled prior to Protocol Amendment 6 
(28 JUN 2017) who were on epacadostat monotherapy and allowed to continue taking it will be 
allowed to continue epacadostat monotherapy  for up to an additional [ADDRESS_1253202] dose of either epacadostat 
or durvalumab (whichever comes later).  The subject should be encouraged to return for the 
safety follow-up visits. 
6.4. Follow -Up Period  
6.4.1. Safety Follow- Up 
The safety follow -up period is the interval between the EOT visit and the last scheduled safety 
follow-up visit, which should occur 90 days after the EOT visi t (or after the last dose of study 
drug if the EOT visit was not performed).  Safety follow -up visit 1 will be performed 42 days 
(± 7 days) after the EOT visit or the last dose of study treatment (if the EOT visit was not 
performed).  Safety follow-up visit 2 will be performed 90 days (± 7 days) after the EOT visit or 
last dose of study treatment (if the EOT visit was not performed) .  Adverse events and SAEs 
must be reported up until at least [ADDRESS_1253203] the next scheduled safety follow-up 
(42-day or 90-day) visit before the first dose of the new therapy.  
6.5. Unscheduled Vis its 
Unscheduled study visits may occur at any time if medically warranted.  Any assessments 
performed at those visits should be recorded in the CRF. 
6.6. Early Termination  
Not applicable.  
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_1253204] be followed; a copy of the signed ICF must be provided to the study subject.  Subjects of 
childbearing potential must agree to take appropriate measures to avoid pregnancy in order to 
participate in the study  (see Appendix A ). 
7.2. Demography and History 
7.2.1. Demographics and Medical History  
Demographic data and a complete medical and medication history will be collected at screening 
by [CONTACT_165922], race, ethnicity, medical 
and surgical history, and concurrent illnesses assessed using the NCI CTCAE v4.0 ( NCI 2010).  
Documentation of disease history, including details of malignancy (date of diagnosis, primary 
tumor histology, prior systemic anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], surgeries, radiation therapy, and stage of 
cancer ) will a lso be collected at screening.  
7.2.2. Prior  and Concomitant Medications 
Prior and ongoing medications will be reviewed to determine study eligibility.  All prior 
treatments for the subject 's advanced cancer will be recorded in  the CRF.  
The medication record will be maintained  after  enrollment as documentation of concomitant 
medications , including any changes to the dose or regimen.  Concomitant medications include 
any prescription, over- the-counter, or natural/herbal preparations taken or administered during 
the study period. 
7.3. Safety Assessments  
7.3.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be monitored from the time the subject  signs the ICF .  Subjects will be 
instructed to report all AEs during the study and will be assessed for the occur rence of AEs 
throughout the study.  In order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects will be asked general, nonleading questions such as "How are you feeling? "  All AEs (serious and nonserious) must be 
recorded on the source documents and CRFs  regardless of the assumption of a causal 
relationship with the study drug .  The definition, reporting, and recording requirements for AEs 
are described in Section 8.

Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_1253205] be performed by a medically qualified individual such as a licensed 
physician, Physician 's Assistant, or an advanced Registered Nurse Practitioner, as local law 
permits.  
The comprehensive physical examination will include the following organ or body s ystem 
assessments:   skin; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; thyroid; lungs; cardiovascular system ; 
abdomen (liver, spleen); extremities ; lymph nodes; and a brief neurological exam ination . 
7.3.3. Targeted Physical  Examination 
A targeted physical examination will be a symptom -directed evaluation.  The targeted physical 
examination will include assessment(s) of the body systems or organs indicated by [CONTACT_488286], AEs, or other findings as determined by [CONTACT_1719]. 
7.3.4. Vital Signs  
Vital sign measu rements (blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], body temperature) will be taken 
with the subject in the recumbent, semirecumbent, or sitting position after [ADDRESS_1253206] to infusion of 
durvalumab: 
• At the beginning of the infusion (at 0 minutes ± 5 minutes). 
• Every 15 minutes during the infusion (at 15, 30, and 45 minutes ; all ± 5 minutes) . 
• At the end of the infusion (at 60 minutes ± 5 minutes). 
• 30 and 60 minutes after  the infusion (ie, 90 and 120 minutes from the start of the 
infusion; ± 5 minutes). 
• Followed by a 3-hour period of observation (± 15 minutes) after the first infusion. 
7.3.5. Twelve- Lead Electrocardiograms  
All [ADDRESS_1253207] for the baseline ECG .  Electrocardiograms  will be obtained as outlined in Table 27 (unless 
emerging PK data suggest alternate timing) .  Electrocardiograms  should be performed before the 
PK blood draw when collected at the same visit .

acceptable; however, subjects with a left bundle branch block would be excluded.  
b ECGs must be performed before  PK draws.  
c ECGs should be performed before  durvalumab and epacadostat administration.  
The 12- lead ECGs will be interpreted by [CONTACT_165924].  The decision to include or exclude a subject or withdraw a 
subject from the study based on an ECG flagged as " Abnormal, Clinically Significant " is the 
responsibility of the investigator, in consultation with the sponsor's m edical monitor, as 
appropriate. 
7.3.6. Laboratory Assessments 
A labora tory local to the study site may perform all clinical laboratory assessments for safety 
(including comprehensive chemistry, hematology assessments , and urinalysis).  A central 
laboratory will perform PK , immunogenicity,  assessments.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Chemistry  
A comprehensive chemistry panel will be performed as indicated in  Table 25; required analytes 
for this panel are listed in  Table 26.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Liver Chemistry Monitoring  
If analytes are found to be abnormal (Grade 1 or higher) , frequency of monitoring should be 
increased to twice weekly until they have resolved to baseline or corticosteroid treatment has 
begun, at which time monitoring will be performed according to institutional standards or 
approximately weekly, whichever is shorter.  Liver chemistry  monitoring for persistent 
low-grade abnormalities does not need to be monitored twice weekly  indefinitely.  Appropriate 
liver chemistry  monitoring intervals should be discussed with the medical monitor for these 
circumstances.  Required analytes  for liver chemistry monitoring are listed in Table 26. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hematology 
Hematology assessments will be performed as indicated in  Table 25.  R equired analytes for this 
panel are listed in Table 26. 
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page 103 of 166 
Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 203 Amendment 7  Version 7  21 SEP 2018  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Coagulation Panel 
A coagulation panel including PT and INR will be measured at screening.  Subjects who are 
taking anticoagulant ther apy should be monitored per local institutional guidelines.   
See Section  5.10.1 for use of coumarin- based anticoagulant guidelines and warfarin dose 
modification.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Endocrine Function Testing  
Endocrine function tes ting will be performed as indicated in  Table 25; required analytes for this 
panel are listed  in Table 26. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serology 
Serology will be performed at screening to rule out hepatit is infection; required analytes are 
shown in Table 26. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy Testing  
A serum pregnancy test will be required for all female subjects of childbearing potential during 
screening .  Subsequent pregnancy tests (either serum or urine) may be conducted as medically 
necessary or as required per local guidelines.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Urinalysis  
Urinalysis will be analyzed as indicated in  Table 25; required analytes for this panel are listed in 
Table 26. 
7.3.7. Chest Radiograph 
A chest radiograph is required at screening.  Subsequent chest radiographs will be conducted 
only as clinically indicated.  
7.4. Efficacy Assessments  
7.4.1. Initial Tumor Imaging 
Initial tumor imaging must be performed within [ADDRESS_1253209] v1.1 guidelines ( Eisenhauer et al 2009) with 
modifications for all subjects and will be performed every [ADDRESS_1253210] dose of study 
treatment  (see Table 24 ).  This assessment schedule also applies to those subjects who continue 
to receive study treatment beyond confirmed PD (s ee Section  [IP_ADDRESS].4).  Scheduled disease 
assessments should always be calculated from the first dose of study treatment.  Imaging should 
not be delayed for delays in cycle starts.  For those subjects who discontinue study treatment as a 
result of confirmed  PD, disease evaluation will be performed at the EOT  visit if clinically 
appropriate (ie, in the absence of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_894421]).   Additional disease 
assessments may be performed as clinically indicated.  Images of the chest and abdomen are 
required for all subjects, and neck imaging is also required for subjects with SCCHN.  Imaging 
of the pelvis is only required for subjects with TCC of the GU tract but is strongly encouraged 
for all subjects.  
7.4.3. RECIST v 1.1 
Tumor lesions that  are located i n a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other 
locoregional therapy, should not be selected as target lesions.  Additionally, tumor lesions that  
will be biopsied should not be selected as target lesions.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Tumor Assessments  
• Physical examination: 
− Lesions detected by [CONTACT_497150], eg, skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes.  Documentation by [CONTACT_894476]. 
• CT scan  with contrast of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (plus head and neck if 
applicable) : 
− CT scans should be performed with contiguous cuts in slice thickness of [ADDRESS_1253211] should be performed using a 5-mm contiguous reconstruction 
algorithm.  
• MRI scans : 
− MRI of the abdomen and pelvis (plus head and neck if applicable) is acceptable 
for measurement of lesions provided that the same anatomical plane is used for 
serial assessments.  If possible, the same imaging device should be used for serial 
evaluat ions.  In case of MRI, measurements will be preferably performed in the 
axial (transverse) plane on contrast -enhanced T1 weighted images.  However, 
there are no specific sequence recommendations.

Incyte Corporation  Page 105 of 166 
Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 203 Amendment 7  Version 7  21 SEP 2018  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Measurability of Tumor Lesions 
Tumor lesions will be categor ized as follows: 
• Measurable Lesions :  Must be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension (longest 
diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of: 
− [ADDRESS_1253212] scan (irrespective of scanner type) and MRI (no less than double 
the slice thickness and a minimum of 10 mm). 
− 10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_229400]  (when superficial).  
− Malignant lymph nodes are considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be ≥ [ADDRESS_1253213] s can (CT scan 
slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). 
• Nonmeasurable Lesions :  Nonmeasurable lesions are defined as all other lesions 
(or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis).  Lesions considered truly nonmeasurable include the following:  leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement 
of skin or lung, and abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by 
[CONTACT_894477]. 
• Target Lesions :  All lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions total (and a maximum of 
2 lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified as 
target lesions.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend 
itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. 
• Nontarget Lesio ns:  It is possible to record multiple nontarget lesions involving the 
same organ as a single item on the case record form (eg, "multiple enlarged pelvic 
lymph nodes" or "multiple liver metastases "). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Response Criteria  
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Evaluation of Target Lesions 
• Complete Response :  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or nontarget) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm (the sum may not be "0 " if there are target nodes).  
• Partial Response:   At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
• Progressive Disease:   At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum 
must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  The appearance 
of 1 or more new lesions is also considered progression.) 
• Stable Disease:   Neither s ufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase 
to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters while on study.  
CONFIDENTIAL

Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 203 Amendment 7  Version 7  21 SEP 2018  
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Evaluation of Nontarget Lesions 
• Complete Response:   Disappearance of all nontarget lesions  
  All lymph nodes must be nonpathologica l in size (< 10 mm short 
axis).  
• Non−Complete Response/Non −Progressive Disease:   Persistence of 1 or more 
nontarget lesion(s)  
 
• Progressive Disease:   Unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions will be 
defined as the overall level of substantial worsening in nont arget disease such that, 
even in presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has 
increased su fficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  In the absence of 
measurable disease, change in nonmeasurable disease comparable in magnitude to the 
increase that would be required to declare PD for measurable disease.  Examples 
include an increase in a p leural effusion from " trace" to " large, " an increase in 
lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3. Appearance of New Lesions  
The appearance of new lesions is cons idered PD according to RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_1253214] been observed with immunotherapy, new lesions may not represent true disease progression.  In the absence of rapid clinical deterioration, 
subjects may continue to receive study treatment if investigators consider that subjects continue 
to benefit from treatment. 
[IP_ADDRESS].4. Evaluation of Overall Response With Modifications 
Confirmation of PD should be assessed  by a repeat, consecutive assessment no less than [ADDRESS_1253215] documentation.  Treatment with study treatment will continue betwee n the 
initial assessment of PD and confirmation for PD if they are considered clinically stable as 
defined by [CONTACT_4868]:  
• Absence of signs and symptoms indicating disease progression. 
• No decline in ECOG performance status. 
• Absence of rapid progression of disease. 
• Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (eg, cord compression) requiring urgent alternative medical intervention.  
In addition, subjects may continue to receive study treatment beyond confirmed PD in the 
absence of clin ical deterioration and if investigators consider that subjects continue to receive 
benefit from treatment after consultation with the medical monitor.  For example, subjects who 
are clinically stable with no further tumor increase after the initial scan demonstrating PD may 
be allowed to continue study treatment.  In the absence of clinical deterioration, such modifications to the RECIST criteria may discourage the early discontinuation of study treatment 
and provide a more complete evaluation of its antitumor activity than would be seen with

information sheet for signs and symptoms of SS.  This information sheet also instructs subjects 
to seek immediate medical care if any of these symptoms are observed.  
8. SAFETY MONITORING AND REPORTING  
8.1. Adverse Events  
8.1.1. Definitions and Reporting  
For the purposes of this Protocol, an AE is defined as the appearance of (or worsening of any pre-existing) undesirable sign(s), symptom(s), or medical condition(s) that occur after a subject  
provides informed consent.  Abnormal laboratory values or test results occurring after informed consent constitute AEs  only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically 
meaningful, require therapy (eg , hematologic abnormality that requires trans fusion), or require 
changes in the study drug(s).  
Adverse events  that begin or worsen after informed consent should be recorded on the Adverse 
Events page  of the CRF.  Conditions that were already present at the time of infor med consent 
should be recorded on the Medical History page of the CRF.  Adverse event monitoring should 
be continued for at least [ADDRESS_1253220] dose of study treatment .  Adverse events (including 
laboratory abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described using a diagnosi s whenever 
possible rather than  by [CONTACT_147108].  When a clear diagnosis 
cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be reported as a separate AE . 
Adverse events will be assessed according to the CTCAE version 4.0.  The CTCAE severity 
Grade 5 (death) will not be used in this study; rather, information about deaths will be collected as an outcome of the event.  The occurrence of AEs should be sought by [CONTACT_894478].  A dverse events may also  be detected when they are volunteered by [CONTACT_713864], or through physical examination, laboratory test, or other assessments.  As far as possible, each AE should be evaluated to determine: 
• The severity grade (CTCAE Grade 1 to  4). 
• Reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study treatment:  unrelated (no) or 
related (yes).  
NOTE:  Since this is a combination study of epacados tat with durvalumab, the 
relationship to study drug can be assessed for epacadostat  alone, durvalumab alone, 
the combination of epacadostat  with durvalumab, or not related to either epacadostat  
or durvalumab. 
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page 113 of 166 
Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 203 Amendment 7  Version 7  21 SEP 2018  
• Start and end dates, unless unresolved at final exam ination . 
• Action taken with respect to study drug  (eg, none, dose adjusted, temporarily 
interrupted, permanently discontinued, unknown, not applicable). 
• Outcome ( eg, not recovered/not resolved, recovered/resolved, recovering/resolving, 
recovered/resolv ed with sequelae, fatal, unknown). 
• Whether it is serious, as per SAE definition provided in Section  8.3.1. 
Unlike routine safety assessments, SAEs are monitored continuously and have special reporting 
requirements, see Section 8.3.2. 
All AEs should be treated appropriately.  If a concomitant medication or nondrug therapy is 
given, this action should be recorded on the AE and Prior/ Concomitant medications  pages of the 
CRF . 
Once an AE is detected, it should be followed until it ha s resolved  or until it is judged to be 
permanent;  assessment should be made at  each visit (or more frequently if necessary) of any 
changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to 
treat it, and the outcome. 
Disease progression should not be regarded or reported as an AE  itself , unless it is associated 
with a separate AE. 
8.2. Laboratory Test Abnormalities  
8.2.1. Definitions and Reporting  
Laboratory abnormalities that constitute an AE  in their own right (are considered clinically 
meaningful, induce clinical signs or symptoms, require concomitant therapy, or require changes 
in study drug ), should be recorded on the AE page of the CRF.  Whenever possible, a diagnosis 
rather than a symptom should be provided (eg, anemia instead of low hemoglobin).  Laboratory 
abnormalities that meet the criteria for AEs should be followed until they have returned to 
normal or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found.  When an  abnormal laboratory 
test result corresponds to a sign or symptom of a previously reported AE, it is not necessary to 
separately record the lab oratory test result as an additional event.  
Laboratory abnormalities  that do not meet the definition of an AE  should not be reported as AEs .  
A Grade 3 or 4 (severe) AE, as per CTCAE , does not automatically indicate an SAE unless it 
meets the definition of serious, as defined in Section 8.3.1, and/or per the investigator' s 
discretion.  A dose interruption or adjustment for the lab oratory abnormality may be required 
(see Section 5.6) and should not contribute to the designation of a laboratory test  abnormality as 
an SAE . 
8.2.2. Potential D rug-Induced Liver Injury ( or Hy’s Law) 
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver -related laboratory abnormalities should 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event (also known as Hy’s Law) .  All occurrences 
of potential DILIs, mee ting the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 8.3.2 for 
reporting details).

8.3. Serious Adverse Events  
8.3.1. Definitions  
A SAE is defined as an event that meets 1 of the following criteria : 
• Is fatal or life -threatening (ie, immediate risk of dying) . 
• Results in pe rsistent or significant disability  or incapacity . 
• Constitutes a congenital anomaly or birth defect . 
• Is clinically meaningful  (ie, defined as an event that jeopardizes the subject or 
require s potential medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed 
above).  Considered meaningful by [CONTACT_165937], be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may be 
considered a SAE  when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize 
the subject  or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], unless hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2138] a result of : 
− Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication  not associated with any 
deterioration in condition.  Elective or preplanned treatment for a pre -existing 
condition that is unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the  ICF. 
− Treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. 
− Social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594], in the absence of any deterioration in the subject 's 
general conditi on. 
− Any SAEs that are expected due to the condition being treated, including if the 
SAE is a primary outcome measure, or where  there has been a clear agreement 
with regulators not to consider these as SAEs, provided the information is 
collected elsewhere. 
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_1253223] be reported to the sponsor (or de signee ) within 24 hours of learning of its 
occurrence.  Any SAEs experienced after this period should be reported to the sponsor 
(or designee ) only if the investigator suspects a causal relationship to the study drug .  Recurrent 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], complications, or progression of the initial SAE must be reported as the follow-up to 
the original epi[INVESTIGATOR_5319] 24 hours of the investigator receiving the follow-up information.  An 
SAE occurring at a different time interval or otherwise considered completely unrelated to a 
previously reported one should be reported separately as a new event.   Previously planned 
(before providing informed consent) surgeries should not be reported as SAEs unless the 
underlying medical condition worsens over the course of the study. 
Informa tion about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the Serious Adverse Event Report 
Form.   The investigator must assess and record the relationship of each SAE to each specific 
study drug (if there is more than 1), complete the SAE Report Form in English, and send the 
completed, signed form by [CONTACT_87109] [ADDRESS_1253224] assess if there is a r easonable possibility that the SAE is r elated to the study treatment:  
unrelated ( no) or related  (yes). 
Serious AEs related to unblinded comparator drugs or concomitant medications /drug delivery 
systems are reported directly to the manufacturers of those drugs/devices in accordance with the 
package insert.  
The telephone and facsimile  number of the sponsor's contact [CONTACT_122473], s pecific to the study , are 
listed in the investigator folder provided to each site.  The original copy of the SAE Report Form and the fax confirmation sheet must be kept with the CRF  documentation at the study site.  
Follow-up information is sent to the same person to whom the original SAE Report Form was sent, using a new SAE Report Form stating that this is a follow -up to the previously reported 
SAE and giving the date of the original report.  Each recurrence, complication, or progression of 
the original ev ent should be reported as a follow-up to that event regardless of when it occurs.  
The follow-up information should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and 
how it was treated , and whether the subject continued or withdrew from study pa rticipation , or if 
study drug was interrupted or discontinued. 
If the SAE is not previously documented in the IBs for the study drug s (new occurrence) and is 
thought to be related to the sponsor' s study drug , a sponsor' s associate may urgently require 
further information from the investigator for reporting to health authorities . 
The sponsor or its designee may need to issue an IN to inform all investigators involved in any 
study with the same drug that this SAE has been reported.  Suspected Unexpected Serio us 
Adverse Reactions will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics 
committees in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC , or as per national regulatory requirements 
in participating countries.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hepatic Function Abnormalities ( Hepatotoxicity) 
As defined in Section 8.2.2, Hy's law cases must be reported as SAEs.  Additional information regarding hepatic function abnormalities is provided in Section  8.8.

pregnancy has been confirmed, the following procedures should occur: 
• The i nvestigator must notify the sponsor or its designee immediately . 
• The s tudy drug must be discontinued immediately . 
• The subject must be withdrawn from the study. 
• The EOT  visit evaluations  must be performed. 
• The i nvestigator must complete and submit the Pregnancy Initial and Follow -Up 
Report forms to the sponsor or its designee.  
• A serum pregnancy test must be performed to confirm the urine pregnancy test result.  
(The serum  test should be performed at the investigative site to ensure the test will be 
performed promptly and the result available immediately for review.) 
If a negative serum test does not confirm the urine pregnancy test result, then: 
• The investigator will use h is or her expert judgment, based on an assessment of the 
potential benefit/risk to the subject, to determine if it is in the subject' s best interest to 
resume study drug and continue participation in the study. 
To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy in a  subject during maternal or paternal 
exposures to study drug  must be reported within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.   
Data on fetal outcome and breastfeeding are collected for regulatory reporting and drug safety 
evaluation.  Follow-up to each pregnancy should be conducted to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any 
birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications, by [CONTACT_147109]- baby [CONTACT_765].  Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Study Preg nancy 
Form and reported by [CONTACT_89211].  Pregnancy follow-up 
should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the pos sible 
relationship to the sponsor' s study drug of any pregnancy outcome and follow-up to the first 
well-baby [CONTACT_765].  Any SAE experienced during pregnancy must be reported on the SAE 
Report Form and to the sponsor or its  designee. 
8.6. Warnings and Precautions  
No evidence available at the time of the approval of this study P rotocol indicated that special 
warnings or precautions were appropriate, other than those noted in the provided IBs.  Additional 
safety information collected between IB updates will be communicated in the form of INs.  Any 
important new safety information should be discussed with the subject during the study as needed.  If new, significant risks are identified, they will be added to the ICF.

order to review cohort-specific data, overall safety data from prior cohorts (if applicable), and to 
agree on dose escalation, de-escalation, and cohort expansion decisions. 
8.8. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Adverse events of special interest include irAEs that are seen with immunotherapy and any other observed autoimmune phenomenon.  Guidance for the assessment, diagnosis, and management 
of irAEs is provided in Section 5.6.3.  I mmune -related AEs will be monitored carefully at each 
cycle and during the safety follow-up period. 
Adverse events of special interest for durvalumab are events of scientific and medical interest 
specific to the further understanding of the durvalumab safety profile and require close 
monitoring and rapid communication by [CONTACT_68477].  Durvalumab AEs of special interest may be serious or nonserious.  The rapid reporting of these AEs of special 
interest  allows ongoing analysis of these events in order to characterize and understand them in 
association with the use of this investigational product.  Durvalumab, an anti −PD-L1 antibody, 
binds with high affinity and specificity to PD-L1 and blocks its binding to PD-1 and CD80, thus promoting antitumor immunity and tumor cell killing.  Potential risks based on this mechanism of action of durvalumab and related molecules include immun e-mediated reactions such as 
enterocolitis, dermatitis, hepatotoxicity or hepatitis, endocrinopathy, neuropathy, and 
pneumonitis.  The class including anti −PD-L1 drugs and other immune checkpoint antibodies 
such as anti −PD-1 or anti−CTLA -4, have a wide spe ctrum of immune -mediated reactions that 
have been considered inflammatory in nature and can affect any organs of the body. 
8.8.1. Pneumonitis  
Pneumonitis has been reported in association with use of anti −PD-L1/anti−PD-1 antibodies 
(Brahmer  et al 2012).  Initial work -up should include a high-resolution CT scan, ruling out 
infection, and pulse oximetry.  Pulmonary consultation is recommended.  Guidelines for the 
management of subjects with immune -mediated events including pneumonitis are outlined in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
8.8.2. Hypersensitivity Reactions  
Hypersensitivity reactions as well as infusion -related reactions have been reported with 
anti−PD-L1 and anti −PD-1 therapy ( Brahmer et al 2012 ).  As with the administration of any 
foreign protein and/or other biologic agents, reactions following the infusion of monoclonal antibodies can be caused by [CONTACT_62535], including acute anaphylactic (IgE- mediated) 
and anap hylactoid reactions against the monoclonal antibody, and serum sickness.  Acute 
allergic reactions may occur, may be severe, and may result in death.  Acute allergic reactions 
may include hypotension, dyspnea, cyanosis, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], urticaria, pruritus , angioedema, 
hypotonia, urticaria, arthralgia, bronchospasm, wheeze, cough, dizziness, fatigue, headache, 
hypertension, myalgia, vomiting, and unresponsiveness.

Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 203 Amendment 7  Version 7  21 SEP 2018  
Guidelines for management of subjects with hypersensitivity (including anaphylactic reaction) 
and infusion- related reactions are outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
8.8.3. Hepatic Function Abnormalities (Hepatotoxicity) 
Increased transaminases have been reported during treatment with anti −PD-L1 (Brahmer 
et al 2012).  Inflammatory hepatitis has been reported in 3% to 9% of subjects treated with 
anti−CTLA -4 monoclonal antibodies (eg, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]).  The clinical manifestations of 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -treated subjects included general weakness, fatigue, nausea and/or mild fever, and 
increased liver chemistry tests such as AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and/or total bilirubin.  
Hepatic function abnormality is defined as any increase in ALT or AST to > 3 × ULN and concurrent increase in bilirubin to > 2 × ULN (ie, Hy 's law cases).   Concurrent findings are those 
that derive from a single blood draw or from separate blood draws taken within 8 days of each 
other.  Follow- up investigations and inquiries will be initiated promptly by [CONTACT_894479]/or whether there is objective 
evidence that clearly supports causation by a disease (eg, cholelithiasis and bile duct obstruction 
with distended gallbladder) or an agent other than the investigational product.  If the underlying 
diagnosis for the hepatic function abnormality is known (including progression of pre- existing 
disease such as primary or metastatic malignancy), the diagnosis should be recorded as an 
AE/SAE.  If the underlying diagnosis for the hepatic function abnormality remains unknown, the 
term "hepatic function abnormal " should be used to report the AE/SAE.  Hepatic function 
abnormality of unknown etiology, or which is considered attributable to investigational product, 
is required to be reported as "hepatic function abnormal " within [ADDRESS_1253227] by 
[CONTACT_477813].  
8.8.4. Serotonin Syndrome  
As noted in Section  1.3.1, ther e is a theoretical chance that epacadostat  could cause an increase 
in serotonin levels in the brain that might trigger SS ( Boyer  and Shannon 2005) when 
administered in combination with other serotonergic agents.  This syndrome has been most 
closely associated with use of MAOIs, meperidine, linezolid, or methylene blue; all of these 
agents are prohibited during the study.  Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and SNRIs are permitted in the study.  Procedures listed in Section 5.6.4 will be implemented if subjects exhibit 
the signs/symptoms of SS , including tremor, hyperreflexia, and  spontaneous ocular or inducible 
clonus together with agitation, fever, diaphoresis, or muscle rigidity. 
8.9. Product Complaints  
The sponsor collects product complaints on study drugs and drug delivery systems used in clinical studies in order to ensure the safety of study participants, monitor quality, and facilitate 
process and product improvements. 
All product complaints associated with material packaged, labeled, and released by [CONTACT_165941].

Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 203 Amendment 7  Version 7  21 SEP 2018  
The investigator or his/her designee is responsible for reporting a complete description of the 
product complaint and any associated AEs via email or other written communication to the 
Incyte contact.  
If the investigator is asked to return the product for investigation, he/she will return a copy of the product complaint communication with the product. 
9. STATISTICS  
9.1. Study Population s 
Safety Evalua ble:  All subjects enrolled who take at least 1 dose of study drug. 
Pharmacokinetic  Evaluable:   Includes subjects who received at least 
1 dose of study drug(s) and provided at least [ADDRESS_1253228] dosing and sample records to identify subjects to be excluded from the analysis. 
Phase 1 Population:   All subjects enrolled in the Phase [ADDRESS_1253229] 
1 dose of study drug.  
9.2. Selection of Sample Size  
9.2.1. Cohort Size in Phase 1  
The primary objective of the open- label Phase 1 portion of the study is to determine the MTD or 
PAD and DLT of epacadostat  in combination with durvalumab.  The total number of subjects 
will de pend on the number of dose levels tested before the MTD or PAD is established.  Up to 
36 subjects (6 subjects per dose level for 6 dose levels) will be included based on the dose 
escalation.  Dose escalation will follow the 3  + 3 design algorithm as defined in Section 4.1.1.  
Based on this algorithm, which enrolls 3 evaluable subjects in each cohort with a maximum of 
6 subjects at any dose level, the probabilities of dose de-escalation from a given dose level for 
the various DLT rates are provided in Table 32. 
Table 32: Probability of Dose De-Escalation for Various DLT Rates 
True DLT Rate  Probability of Dose De -Escalation  
20% 23.6%  
30% 47.2%  
40% 68.3%  
50% 83.4%  
60% 92.4%  
For example, if the true DLT rate is 50% at a given dose level, there is a 17% chance that the 
dose would be escalated.  Further, if the true DLT rate is 20%, there is a 76% chance that the 
dose would be escalated.

9.2.2. Sample Size for Phase 2  
The sample size for the melanoma, TNBC, and gastric and GE junction cohorts will be guided by 
[CONTACT_144122] 2- stage  design (Simon  1989).  Let P 0 denote a clinically uninteresting response rate 
(eg, for melanoma P 0 = 30%).  In order to determine whether a target response rate ( eg, 55%) is 
likely, an initial number of subjects ( eg, 15) will be treated at first in a cohort (Stage 1).  For 
example, i n a group in which ≤ [ADDRESS_1253230] 6 responses among the Stage 1 subjects is observed, 25 additional subjects will be treated in Stage 2 to estimate the 
response rate.  At the end of Stage 2, if ≤ [ADDRESS_1253231] responded among a total of 
40 subjects, the drug will be declared nonpromising.  In othe r words, after the study is finished, 
if there is a sufficient number of responses in the 2 stages combined, the study compound is 
considered promising; otherwise it is considered nonpromising.  The detail is displayed in 
Table 33 using a Type I error of 0.05 and power of 90% for estimation.

9.3. Level of Significance  
No formal efficacy hypothes es will be tested.   All CIs will be 95%. 
9.4. Statistical Analyses  
9.4.1. Primary Analyses 
Phase 1:  The safety and tolerability of epacadostat  in combination with durvalumab will be 
evaluated.  See Section 9.4.3 for more de tails.  Descriptive statistics ( eg, mean, standard 
deviation, range) will be derived where appropriate.  Subject enrollment, disposition, 
demographics, and medical history will be summarized at baseline.  The rate of DLTs will be summarized for each cohort.  Dose exposure and density will be calculated for each cohort.  
Safety and disease response data will be compared over time to assess change from baseline, 
during treatment, and follow-up.  Pharmacokinetic  data will be analyzed 
with a ppropriate standard nonlinear analytic software.  
Phases 1 and 2:  The proportion of subjects with objective response by [CONTACT_143900] v1.[ADDRESS_1253239] v1.1 if he 
or she has an overall  response of CR or PR at any postbaseline visit.  The proportion of 
responders within each treatment group will be estimated with 95% CI s by [CONTACT_1570].  
Confidence intervals will be calculated based on the exact method for binomial distributions. 
9.4.2. Secondary Analyses 
For objective responders, the duration of response is the time from the first overall response 
contributing to an objective response, to the first overall response of PD (by m RECIST v1.1) 
occurring after the first overall response contribut ing to the objective response.  Median duration 
of response and time to disease progression will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.  Confidence intervals for median survival time will be calculated using the method of 
Brookmeyer and Crawley ( 1982 ), which is the default method within SAS v9.1. 
Progression- free survival  data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_8761] -Meier method, treating subjects 
with no observed death or progression censored at their last date known to be alive and 
progression- free. 
9.4.3. Safety  Analyses 
The principal analysis will be based on the safety evaluable population, according to treatment 
assignment.  
Adverse events will be coded by [CONTACT_165942], and incidences will be tabulated by [CONTACT_894480], related events, and events ≥ Grade 3.  Severity of AEs 
will be based on the CTCAE scale as indicated in Section 8.1.1.  Quantitative safety variables 
and their changes from baseline (labo ratory, vital signs) will be summarized with descriptive 
statistics.  Clinically significant abnormal values will be flagged and tabulated based on 
predefined criteria.  
Exposure will be analyzed by [CONTACT_165944], which is defined as the dose re ceived , 
divided by [CONTACT_894481], over a given time interval.  This will be done by [CONTACT_894482] + epacadostat  and durvalumab alone.  For each cycle,

Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 203 Amendment 7  Version 7  21 SEP 2018  
incidences of dose reductions and cycle delays will also be tabulated by [CONTACT_894483].  The percentage of subjects with any delay and/or reduction will also be calculated. 
9.4.4. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
The clinical laboratory data will be analyzed using summary statistic s (eg, means and 
frequencies ).  In addition, distributions of key laboratory parameters (including hemoglobin, 
neutrophils, and platelets) will be plotted over time; these values will also be classified into 
CTC AE toxicity grades and tabulated.  Descriptive statistics and mean change  from baseline will 
be determined for vital signs at each assessment time.  Vital sign results will be reviewed for 
clinically notable abnormalities.  
9.5. Data Monitoring Committee  
Not applicable.  
9.6. Interim Analysis  
An interim safety analysis is planned for Phase  [ADDRESS_1253240] been enrolled and treated 
for 8 weeks, and then approximately every 3 months thereafter.  If the following is reported 
during these reviews, enrollment of subjects would be suspended until the sponsor determined

These records should include dates, quantities, batch or serial numbers (if available), and the 
unique code numbers (if available) assigned to the investigational product and study subjects. 
The investigational product must be used only in accordance with the Protocol.  The investigator 
will also maintain records adequately documenting that the subjects were provided the correct study drug specified.  
Completed accountability records will be archived by [CONTACT_779].  At the completion of the study, the investigator or designee will over see shipment of any remaining study drug back to the 
sponsor or its  designee for destruction according to institutional standard operating procedures.  
If local procedures mandate site destruction of investigational supply, prior written approval must be obtained from Incyte. 
11. STUDY ADMINISTRATION 
11.1. Data Management  
11.1.1. Data Collection 
The investigator will be provided with a CRF for each subject.  Entries made in the CRF must be 
verifiable against source documents ; any  discrepancies should be explained and documented .  
The investigator will be responsible for reviewing all data and CRF entries and will sign and date 
the designated pages in each subject 's CRF, verifying that the information is true and correct.  
The investigator is responsible for the review and approval of all responses. 
11.1.2. Data Management 
Data management will be performed from CRFs .  All CRF data will be entered into a validated 
database.  All data entry, verification , and validation will be performed in accordance with the 
current standard operating procedures of the Data Management Department at the sponsor or its 
designee.  The database will be authorized for lock once all defined procedures are completed.  
11.2. Study Monitoring  
Qualified representatives of the sponsor or its  designee, "study monitors," w ill monitor the study 
according to a predetermined monitoring plan.  Monitoring visits provide the sponsor with the 
opportunity to: 
• Evaluate the progress of the study.  
• Verify the accuracy and completeness of CRFs . 
• Assure that all Protocol requirements, applicable laws and/or regulations, and 
investigator' s obligations are being fulfilled . 
• Resolve any inconsistencies in the study records. 
The investigator must allow the study monitors to periodically review, at mutually convenient 
times during the study and after the study has been completed, all CRFs and office, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and 
laboratory records supporting the participation of each subject in the study.  The CRFs and other 
documentation supporting the study must be kept up- to-date by [CONTACT_894485] [ADDRESS_1253243] be available for review by [CONTACT_8760], and/or other qualified representatives of the sponsor or its designee , at each monitoring 
visit.  
The study monitor will review the various records of the study (CRFs, subject medical and laboratory records, and other pertinent data).  The study monitor will verify the CRF data against 
original source documentation for accuracy and completeness.  The study monitor will identify 
data discrepancies and collaborate with the investigator and research staff to resolve the 
discrepancies in a timely manner.  Protocol deviations will also be identified and recorded on a 
"Protocol Deviation Log."  The study monitor will follow an "Issue Escalation " plan in order to 
ensure that each issue identified during a monitoring visit is appropriately documented, reported, 
and resolved in a timely manner in accordance with the plan 's requirements.  
11.3. Protocol Adherence  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_713822].  Initial IRB or 
IEC approval and all materials approved by [CONTACT_713873]. 
Each investigator must adhere to the Protocol as described in this document and agree that 
changes to the Protocol, with the exception of medical emergencies, must be discussed and 
approved, firstly , by [CONTACT_89223] , secondly, by [CONTACT_4186].  Each 
investigator is responsible for enrolling subjects who have met the Protocol inclusion and 
exclusion criteria .  The IRB or IEC that granted o riginal approval, or the IRB or I EC currently 
responsible for overseeing the conduct of the study, must be notified of all changes in and deviations from the Protocol that may increase risk to the subject, and/or that may adversely affect the rights of the subject or validity of the investigation.  The investigator must send a copy 
of the approval letter from the  IRB or IEC to the sponsor or its designee  and retain the original in 
the site study regulatory file.  
Major eligibility deviatio ns must be reported to the IRB or IEC in accordance with the IRB or

Amendment 6 (28 JUN 2017) 
Overall Rationale for the Amendment:  
The primary purpose of this amendment is to revise the design and composition of the NSCLC, 
SCCHN, and TCC of the GU tract Phase 2 expansion cohorts.  Additional changes include removal of the optional epacadostat monotherapy treatment period of the study updating 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and including updated safety information for epacadostat and 
durvalumab. 
This amendment includes the changes to INCB  [ZIP_CODE]-203 Protocol Amendment 5 
(25 MAY 2016) summarized below. 
1. Synopsis; Section 4.1.2, Phase 2; Section 4.4, Number of Subjects; Section 9.2.2, 
Sample Size for Phase 2  
Description of change:   The Phase [ADDRESS_1253257]–treated subjects in each cohort was restricted to 10.  Table [ADDRESS_1253258] the new expansion cohort composition and statistical basis for the sample size.  
Rationale for change:   The design and composition of the NSCLC, SCCHN, and TCC 
cohorts were revised to allow for the full complement of Phase [ADDRESS_1253259]–treated and PD -[ADDRESS_1253260]–naive subjects within the  
respective tumor types.  Restricting the number of prior PD-[ADDRESS_1253261]–treated subjects 
within each cohort was instituted to preserve the predicted levels of baseline efficacy 
observed with PD-[ADDRESS_1253262] monotherapy.

due to a toxicity at tributed to epacadostat, but they completed 12 months of durvalumab 
and had a status of stable disease or better when they discontinued treatment. 
Rationale for change:   Based on emerging data with regard to epacadostat monotherapy 
as well as monotherapy d ata from other agents targeting the IDO pathway, there is no 
clear evidence of antitumor activity with IDO inhibitors as monotherapy in the tumors 
being evaluated in this study.  IDO1 is an interferon response gene and a resistance 
mechanism to PD -[ADDRESS_1253263] −targeting agents has been reported in tumor types where PD-[ADDRESS_1253264]−targeting agents have been approved by [CONTACT_12721].  Thus, 
responders who complete 12 months of treatment and discontinue study treatment may 
resume combination therapy. 
3. Synopsis; Section 3.3, Subject Exclusion Criteria  
Description of changes:  
a. Exclusion criteria 1e and 1f were revised to remove alkaline phosphatase and update 
requirements for aspa rtate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and total 
bilirubin. 
b. Criterion 7 was revised to exclude subjects with major surgical procedure within 28 days of starting study treatment OR inadequate recovery from toxicity and/or complications from major  surgery before starting study treatment.  
c. Criterion [ADDRESS_1253265] received prior immunotherapy.  
f. New criteria 26 and 27 added to exclude subjects with a history of primary immunodeficiency or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.

Amendment 5 (25 MAY 2016) 
Overall Rationale for the Amendment:  
The primary purpose of this amendment is to provide additional guidance for subjects continuing 
on monotherapy epacadostat and provide guidance for subjects who restart treatment with 
combination therapy after durvalumab has been stopped. 
This amendment includes the changes to the INCB [ZIP_CODE]-203 Protocol Amendment 4 
(12 JAN 2016) summarized be low. 
1. Synopsis; Section 3.3, Subject Exclusion Criteria (Criterion #5); Section [IP_ADDRESS], 
Procedures for Immune -Related Adverse Events Not Specifically Described 
Above; Section 5.10, Concomitant Medications and Measures 
Description of change:   The threshold for systemic steroids was changed from 
≥ 7.5 mg/day to ≥ 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent. 
Rationale for change:   Several recent studies evaluating immune- related adverse 
events (irAEs) and the need for systemic immunosuppression indicate that low doses 
of systemic steroids for the management of irAEs do not impact survival or time to 
treatment failure.  Although the threshold for the study was increased, a maximum dose of 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent is still considered a low dose.  
2. Section 1.1.6, Melanoma; Section 1.1.7, Non–Small Cell Lung Cancer; 
Section  1.1.9, Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck; Section 1.1.11, 
Gastric and Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer 
Description of change:   Updated background information on therapi[INVESTIGATOR_894431], non- small cell lung cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of 
the head and neck, and gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer.  
Rationale for change:   To provide up- to-date information. 
3. Section 3.2, Subject Inclusion Criteria  
Description of  change:   Inclusion criterion #[ADDRESS_1253266] dose of study drug. 
Rationale for change:   Male subjects were required to take appropriate precautions  
throughout the study not to father a child, which was inclusive of sperm donation.  
The language seeks to clarify the subject's responsibilities while participating in the 
study.  
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_1253267] Exclusion Criteria; Section 6, Study Assessments (Table  21) 
Description of change:   Exclusion criterion #[ADDRESS_1253268] completed treatment for hepatitis C intended to eradicate to 
the virus and hepatitis C RNA levels are undetectable.  
Rationale for change:   The availability of highly active treatments for HCV has 
transformed hepatitis C into a curable illness.  Subjects who have undergone antiviral 
therapy and have an undetectable viral load are an important population to consider 
for immunotherapy studies.  In the dose-escalation phase of the study, subjects underwent increased monitoring of liver chemist ry tests weekly for the first 8  weeks 
on study.  There were no cases of hepatitis reported, and no subjects experienced drug-induced liver injury while on study.  A recent case study of 2 HCV+ subjects treated with pembrolizumab alone and pembrolizumab + ipi[INVESTIGATOR_894432].
[ADDRESS_1253269] ive HBV are still excluded 
(http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hbv/hbvfaq.htm#general). 
5. Section 3.3, Subject Exclusion Criteria  
Description of change:   Exclusion criterion #[ADDRESS_1253270] is on anti-arrhythmic medication and is 
in sinus rhythm on the screening ECG. 
Rationale for change:   More than [ADDRESS_1253271] been noted.

Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 203 Amendment 7  Version 7  21 SEP 2018  
6. Section 4.1.2, Phase 2 
Description of change:  Revised to indicate that if more than 1 PAD is evaluated, the 
cohort may or may not be  repeated for the specified tumor type.  
Rationale for change:   A higher dose level may be explored based on PK/PD data 
from the Phase 1 portion of the study.  If target inhibition at the 300 mg BID dose 
level is greater than the 100 mg BID dose level, subjects may be enrolled at the 
higher dose level.  If the lower dose level does not meet the threshold for the number of responses required to expand the cohort, the cohort may be enrolled at the higher 
dose level.  
7. Section 5.6.2, Criteria and Procedures for Interruption or Dose Reduction  
Description of change:   In Table 7 (Dose Modification Guidelines of Epacadostat 
and Durvalumab for Non −Immune- Related Adverse Events), "Action with Respect to 
Durvalumab" was revised for infusion-related reactions:  For Grade 1 or 2,  the time 
limit of "up to 4 hours" for temporary interruption of durvalumab was deleted; for 
Grade ≥ 3, a note was added that severe infusion-related reactions should be managed 
per institutional standards (eg, IM epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], followed by [CONTACT_231257], and IV glucocorticoid). 
Rationale for change :  To provide additional guidance to investigators regarding the 
management of irAEs . 
8. Section 5.6.3, Criteria for Subjects Exhibiting Immune- Related Adverse Events  
Description of change:   Tables 9 through 15 (Recommended Approach for Handling 
Noninfectious Pneumonitis, Enterocolitis, Hepati tis, Dermatitis, Neuropathies, 
Endocrinopathies, and Nephritis or Renal Dysfunction, respectively) were updated, 
and precautions were added for any grade immune-mediated peripheral neuromotor 
syndromes, such as Guillain- Barré syndrome and myasthenia gravis.  
Rationale for change:  To provide additional guidance to investigators regarding the 
management of irAEs.  
9. Section 5.9, Beginning and End of Study  
Description of change:   Revised to define end of study as when all subje cts have 
discontinued the study drug and have completed applicable follow-up assessments, 
and to indicate that if ≤ 5 subjects are on study for more than 6 months, a database 
lock of the study may occur to allow the analysis of the study data.  Any remaini ng 
subjects may continue on study until a discontinuation criterion is met and/or written notification is provided to the sponsor. 
Rationale for change:   To clarify that the end of study will be declared when all 
subjects have been discontinued the study drug and completed all applicable 
follow-up visits.

14. Section [IP_ADDRESS], Pharmacokinetic Assessment for Epacadostat 
Description of change:   In T able 24 (Sample Collection Windows for 
Pharmacokinetic Assessments for Epacadostat), the window for the 6-hour and 
optional 8- to 10-hour samples was changed to ± 60 minutes (instead of ± 30 minutes).  
Rationale for change:  Visit windows were lengthened to allow greater flexibility.  
15. Section 9.6, Interim Analysis 
Description of change: The interim analysis was modified to evaluate all ≥ Grade 3 
adverse events attributable to the investigational agents in Phase 2 of the study. 
Rationale for change:   The revis ed criteria for evaluation allows for efficient 
monitoring of safety in a larger sample size.  
16. Section [IP_ADDRESS], Epacadostat 
Description of change:   The packaging/labeling statement was revised to:  All Incyte 
investigational product labels will be in the local language and will comply with the 
legal requirements of each country.  
Rationale for change:  The study will now include ex- US centers; therefore, the 
language was updated for global compliance.  
17. Appendix A, Information Regarding Effectiveness of Contraceptive Methods  
Description of change:   Appendix A was updated with Clinical Trial Facilitation 
Group's recommendations related to contraception in clinical studies.  
Rationale for change: The study will now include ex- US centers; therefore, the 
language wa s updated for global compliance.

4. Synopsis; Section 3.2, Subject Inclusion Criteria  
Description of change:   Inclusion criterion #[ADDRESS_1253272] received prior treatment with an anti–PD -1 targeted agent.  
Rationale for change:   The PD -[ADDRESS_1253273] 
received prior therapy with either of these agents.  
5. Synopsis; Section 3.3, Subject Exclusion Criteria  
Description of change:   Exclusion criterion #21 was revised to indicate that subjects 
with a screening QTc interval > 480 msec (instead of > 470 msec) are excluded.  
Rationale for change:   An analysis of QTc interval prolongation and the relationship 
between epacadostat plasma concentration and QTc intervals in Phase 1 and 2 
epacadostat studies was conducted, and no clinically meaningful change s or trends were 
noted. 
6. Section 1.1.5, Combined Immune Checkpoint Inhibition; Section 1.1.6, Melanoma; 
Section 1.1.7, Non −Small Cell Lung Cancer, Section 1.1.13, Preclinical and Clinical 
Study Data; Section 1.3, Potential Risks and Benefits of the Treatmen t Regimen; 
Section 1.4, Justification for Treatment Regimen 
Description of change:   In Section 1.1.5, additional background information was added 
from a study of nivolumab in combination with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_894433], and 
updated data were added from the ongoing Phase 1/2 study of epacadostat in combination 
with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  In Sections 1.1.6 and 1.1.7, information regarding recent approvals for 
the treatment of melanoma and NSCLC was added.  Preclinical and clinical study data 
were updated in Section  1.1.13.  Safety data were updated in Sections 1.3 and 1.4. 
Rationale for change:   To provide up- to-date information. 
7. Section 1.3.1, Risks from Epacadostat; Section 6, Study Assessments, Section 7.3.4, Assessment of Serotonin Syndrome Symptoms  
Descript ion of change:   Serotonin syndrome assessment was deleted from the schedule 
of assessments (Table 19) and corresponding sections. 
Rationale for change:  Of the [ADDRESS_1253274] exhibited serotonin syndrome.  Subjects and sites are informed of the signs and symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome; however, the separate serotonin 
syndrome assessment has been removed from the Protocol.

8. Section [IP_ADDRESS], Procedures and Guidance for Hepatitis; Section 6, Study 
Asse ssments, Section [IP_ADDRESS].1, Liver Chemistry Monitoring 
Description of change:   The requirement to conduct liver chemistry tests weekly for the 
first 8 weeks on study treatment was deleted.  
Rationale for change:   Because of the low incidence of Grade [ADDRESS_1253275] elevations seen on study, weekly monitoring of liver chemistry tests are not required.  Additional monitoring of liver chemistries will occur every cycle while epacadostat is administered as combination therapy.  
9. Section 5.10, Concomitant Medications and Measures  
Description of change:   Text updated to indicate that concomitant medications 
administered as treatment prophylaxis (eg, for the management of infusion reactions) 
should be recorded in the CRF.  A new table was added (Table 18) to provide warfarin 
dose modification guidance. 
Rationale for change:   In the INCB [ZIP_CODE]-102 study, PK  modeling 
showed that the observed extent of epacadostat interaction on multiple-dose warfarin PK 
is expected to cause greater INR increases  in subjects on warfarin therapy; therefore, 
detailed coadministration guidance has been provided. 
10. Section 6, Study Assessments, Section 7.3.7, Pulmonary Function Tests 
Description of change:   The requirement for pulmonary function testing was deleted 
from  Tables 20 and 21. 
Rationale for change:   Because of the low incidence of Grade 3 or greater pulmonary 
events, the requirement for pulmonary function testing has been removed.  
11. Section 6, Study Assessments; Section 7.3.5, Twelve- Lead Electrocardiograms  
Description of change:  Timing of ECGs was clarified in Table  19 (footnote c) and a 
new table was added to Section 7.3.5 (Table 22) providing the schedule and timing of 
ECG assessments.  
Rationale for change:   ECGs will be taken in conjunction with the updated timepoints 
for PK assessments.  
12. Section 6, Study Assessments; Section 7.6.1, Pharmacokinetics 
Description of change:   The PK sample collection timing for epacadostat and 
durvalumab PK was updated, and a new table was added (Table 25) providing sample 
collection windows for durvalumab PK assessments. 
Rationale for change:   Pharmacokinetic assessments for the INCB24360 program were 
aligned to collect additional information at predose, C
max, and steady state.

13. Section 7.4, Efficacy Assessments 
Description of change:   The tumor imaging sections were updated to indicate that 
imaging of the pelvis is only required for subjects with TCC of the GU tract but is 
strongly encouraged for all subjects. 
Rationale for change:   Pelvic imaging is considered standard of care fo r TCC of the GU 
tract.

3. Synopsis, Key Inclusion Criteria and Key Exclusion Criteria; Section 3.2, Subject 
Inclusion Criteria; Section 3.3, Subject Exclusion Criteria  
Description of change:   Inclusion criterion 5b and exclusion criterion [ADDRESS_1253276] been 
updated to allow prior anti–PD -[ADDRESS_1253277] targeted agent is approved. 
Rationale for change:   PD-[ADDRESS_1253278]-line treatment in melanoma.  Incyte anticipates additional approvals for anti–PD -1 
and anti–PD -L1 targeted agents in other tumor types during the conduct of this study. 
4. Synopsis, Key In clusion Criteria; Section 3.2, Subject Inclusion Criteria  
Description of change:   Inclusion criterion [ADDRESS_1253279] adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.  
Rationale for change:   The change was updated to allow for a broader population of 
pancreatic subjects to enroll in the study.  
5. Synopsis, Key Inclusion Criteria; Section 3.2, Subject Inclusion Criteria; Section  [IP_ADDRESS], Analysis of Tumor Samples 
Description of change:   Fresh tumor biopsies are still required for all subjects at 
screening; however, subjects may now be enrolled if the tumor tissue is deemed inaccessible by [CONTACT_894487]'s 
treating physician .  This exception requires medical monitor approval.  Archival tumor 
tissue should be submitted if available; however, if archival tumor tissue is not available 
and the subject is able to undergo a fresh biopsy, the subject will be considered eligible. 
Rationale for change:   Subjects with late -stage disease may have had any diagnostic 
archival specimens exhausted or have had their initial diagnosis made by [CONTACT_123494]- needle 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_894434].  Therefore, if these subjects  
are willing and able to submit fresh biopsy samples they will not be excluded from the 
study (Administrative Change 2 dated 31 MAR 2015). 
6. Synopsis, Key Inclusion Criteria; Section 3.3, Subject Exclusion Criteria; 
Section  7.3.6, Twelve- Lead Electrocardiograms  
Description of change:  The average QTc of the 3 ECGs may be used for enrollment if a 
single QTc is > 470 milliseconds.  In addition, subjects with an intraventricular conduction delay (eg, right bundle branch block), JTc < 340 milliseconds is acceptable; 
however, subjects with a left bundle branch block would be excluded. 
Rationale for change:   Additional guidance was requested for situations when one of the 
3 QTc measurements obtained at baseline exceeds > 470 milliseconds and for subjects 
with an intraventricular conduction delay.

7. Synopsis, Study Drugs, Dosages, and Modes of Administration; Section 5.1.1, 
Epacadostat 
Description of change:   Instructions for epacadostat administration have been updated to 
specify that an additional dose should not be t aken if a subject vomits.  
Rationale for change:   Language was added to inform sites how to manage dosing if this 
event occurs in subjects dosed with epacadostat. 
8. Section 1.1, Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background 
Description of change:   New subsections containing background information for 
epacadostat (Section 1.1.3) and durvalumab (Section 1.1.4) have been added.  
Section  1.1.6 (Melanoma) was updated to include NCCN guidance and CHMP approval 
of PD -1 inhibitors for the treatment of melanoma.  Section 1.1.10 (Preclinical and 
Clinical Trial Data) was updated to include a summary of epacadostat pharmacokinetic 
(PK)  data and durvalumab PK data in humans. 
Rational for change:  Therapeutic background section was updated for consistency with 
the most recent information from the Investigator Brochures (IBs) for epacadostat and durvalumab. 
9. Section 1.3.1, Risks From Epacadostat 
Description of change:   Updated to report that in Study INCB [ZIP_CODE]-201, [ADDRESS_1253280] 2014 received concomitant treatment with an MAOI 
and epacadostat, and that 0 of the 12 subjects exhibited serotonin syndrome. 
Rationale for change:   Theoretically, inhibition of IDO1 could cause an increase in 
serotonin levels that could precipi[INVESTIGATOR_047] a cluster of AEs termed serotonin syndrome (SS) 
when administered alone or in combination with other serotonergic agents.  This rare 
syndrome has been associated with some monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and combinations of serotonergic drugs.  MAOIs and sero tonergic drugs are prohibited while 
on study however, data from the INCB [ZIP_CODE]-201 study indicate that SS was not observed in 0 of 12 subjects who received concomitant treatment with an MAOI and 
epacadostat.  
10. Section 5.6.2, Criteria and Procedures for Inter ruption or Dose Reduction  
Description of change:   The infusion of durvalumab may be interrupted for up to 
4 hours if an infusion reaction occurs. 
Rationale for change:   Instructions in Table 7 were updated to make consistent with 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
11. Section 5 .6.3, Criteria for Subjects Exhibiting Immune- Related Adverse Events  
Description of change:  The recommended approach to managing immune- related 
adverse events was updated.  
Rationale for change:  The update provides additional guidance for supportive care 
measures for pneumonitis, enterocolitis, hepatitis, dermatitis, neuropathies, 
endocrinopathies other than hypothyroidism, and nephritis or renal dysfunction. 
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page [ADDRESS_1253281] v1.1 
Description of change:   Updated to indicate that tumor lesions located in a previously 
irradiated area or in an area subjected to other locoregional therapy should not be selected 
as target lesions.  In addition, tumor lesions that will be biopsied should not be selected as target lesions.  
Rationale for change:  Lesions locat ed in a previously irradiated area or in an area 
subjected to other locoregional therapy may confound the results of the overall response assessment for the subject.

Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 203 Amendment 7  Version 7  21 SEP 2018  
Amendment 2 (20 FEB 2015)  
Overall Rationale f or the Amendment:  
The primary purpose of this amendment is to allow for the option of intrasubject dose escalation 
to 10 mg/kg for subjects who enroll in the initial dose cohort at MEDI4736 3 mg/kg in 
combination with INCB024360.  This option will only be available when MEDI4736 10 mg/kg has been shown to be tolerable in combination with INCB024360 25 mg BID based on DLT 
rules.  
This amendment includes the changes to INCB [ZIP_CODE]-203 Protocol Amendment 1 
(29 SEP  2014) summarized below. 
1. Synopsis, Study Drugs, D osages, and Modes of Administration; Section 5.1.2, 
MEDI4736; Section 5.6.1, Planned Dose Increases  
Description:   Allow the option for subjects enrolled into the initial dose cohort of 
INCB024360 25 mg BID and MEDI4736 3 mg/kg to dose escalate to MEDI4736 
10 mg/kg in combination with INCB024360 25 mg BID if a number of conditions are met. 
Rationale:  MEDI4736 at a dose of 10 mg/kg has been shown to be well tolerated and is being carried forward as the dose in Phase 3 studies.  If 10 mg/kg is found to be tolerable in combination with INCB024360 25 mg BID based on DLT rules, subjects who start at a 
dose of 3 mg/kg will be given the opportunity to escalate the dose to 10 mg/kg at the 
discretion of the investigator. 
2. Synopsis, Key Inclusion Criteria; Section 3.2, Subject Inclusion Criteria  
Description of change to inclusion criterion #4:   Added language to allow 
investigational agents in combination with standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_894435] a line of therapy and also allow adjuvant, neoadjuvant, or chemoradiation regimens given within 
6 months of screening to be considered a line of therapy. 
Rationale:   Reorganization of inclusion criteria already present in the Protocol to clarify 
that these situations may apply to subjects of any disease indication. 
Description of change to inclusion criterion #5:   Clarified that melanoma subjects may 
be treatment -naïve or have received prior anti–CTLA -[ADDRESS_1253283] received prior treatment with a 
BRAF  inhibito r. 
Rationale:   A recent update to the NCCN guidelines for melanoma has listed anti–PD -[ADDRESS_1253284]-line treatment.  MEDI4736 is an anti- PD-L1 antibody and 
the mechanism of action is similar; therefore, it is reasonable to allow subjects  to 
consider treatment in this study as appropriate first- line treatment.  
CONFIDENTIAL  

Incyte Corporation  Page 162 of 166 
Protocol INCB [ZIP_CODE]- 203 Amendment 7  Version 7  21 SEP 2018  
Description of change to inclusion criterion #6:   Removed the requirement for prior 
treatment with a platinum- based therapy.  Clarified the requirement for subjects with 
driver mutations to have received and progressed or be intolerant to a targeted agent, if 
one is available.  
Rationale:   To allow NSCLC subjects who are not eligible for treatment with a 
platinum-based therapy the opportunity to enroll in the study and to clarify that subjects who have tumors with driver mutations should receive appropriate targeted therapy if one is available.  
3. Synopsis, Key Exclusion Criteria; Section 3.3, Subject Exclusion Criteria 
Description of change to exclusion criterion #1b:   Platelet count of <  75 × 10
9/L at 
baseline is now considered exclusionary. 
Rationale:  Heavily pretreated subjects may have persistent low -grade 
thrombocytopenia.  As the risk of myelosuppression with the combination treatment 
given in this study is low, it is reasonable to allow subjects with Grade 1 
thrombocytopenia to enroll. 
Description of change to exclusion criterion #21:   Subjects with a QTc interval of 
> 470 ms are excluded. 
Rationale:   Based on preclinical testing, there is no QTc liability for either INCB024360 
or M EDI4736.  The original QTc interval criterion was too strict in error and has been 
corrected to allow enrollment with a QTc interval of up to 470 msec. Description of change to exclusion criterion #25:   Addition of an exclusion criterion 
that would require a conversation with the medical monitor to determine eligibility for a 
subject requiring ongoing thorocentesis or paracentesis for palliation. Rationale:   Requirements for recurrent thorocentesis or paracentesis may be indicative of 
aggressive end -stage d isease, and cases should be reviewed with the medical monitor to 
determine if the subject is an appropriate candidate for the study. 
4. Section 1.1.4, Melanoma; Section [IP_ADDRESS], Possible Risks Based on Clinical Data 
Description:   Added information on the recent FDA approval of anti–PD -[ADDRESS_1253285] an IB update. 
Rationale:  To provide investigators with the most updated information. 
5. Section 4.1.2, Phase 2 
Description:   Requirement for at least 5 subjects with PD -L1–positive tumors in each 
expansion cohort has been removed from the Protocol. 
Rationale:   This requirement and the caveat to enroll additional subjects that express 
PD-L1 would have compromised the integrity of the Simon 2 -stage design planned for 
Phase 2 of the study.  Therefore, the requirement was removed.

12. Appendix F, Prohibited UGT -1A9 Inhibitors 
Description:   A new appendix was added listing prohibited UGT-1A9 inhibitors.   
Rationale:   The use of UGT -1A9 inhibitors is prohibited while subjects are on st udy 
treatment per Section 5.10.2.  A list of these agents was added as a reference for 
investigators.

to Phase 1 of the study. 
Rationale for change:   FDA requested changes to the dose-escalation phase of the study.  
2. Synopsis; Section 3.2, Subject Inclusion Criteria  
Description of change:   The inclusion criteria for melanoma have been revised to 
require subjects with a BRAF-mutation to have received prior treatment with a BRAF 
inhibitor with or without a MEK inhibitor.  The inclusion criteria have also been updated 
to clarify that subjects may not refuse standard treatment in Phase 1 of the study.  
Rationale for change:   FDA requested changes to the inclusion criteria.  
3. Section 5.5.1, Definition of Dose- Limiting Toxicities  
Description of change:   The following have been added to the definition of DLT:  Grade 
4 thrombocytopenia related to either drug, ≥ Grade 3 neutropenia lasting > 5 days related 
to either drug, Grade 4 anemia related to either drug, thrombotic thrombocytopenic 
purpura, hemolytic uremic syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, idiopathic 
thrombocytopenic purpura, ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_1253286] unable to receive 75% of INCB024360 or 3 doses of MEDI4736 during the 
DLT observation period.   
Rationale for change : The FDA requested modification of the criteria defining DLTs.  
4. Synopsis; Section 4.1.1, Phase 1 Dose Escalation; Section 5.5, Rationale for Dose 
Modification; Section 5.5.1, Definition of Dose- Limiting Toxicities  
Description of change:  The DLT observation period has been changed to 42 days 
(6 weeks) in the Phase 1 dose-escalation portion of the study.  Text has also been added 
to limit enrollment to 2 subjects per week in Phase 1 of the study.  Additionally, a 1- week 
interval will be required between subjects in successive weeks.  
Rationale for change : FDA requested change.

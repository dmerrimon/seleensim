lymphoma (MF-CTCL) and treated with V alchlor® 
ACRONYM  PROVe  
AUTHOR  Badri Rengara jan, Actelion  Pharmaceuticals  US, Inc.  
RATIONALE 
AND 
BACKGROUND  Due to the rarity of mycosis fungoides cutaneous T -cell lymphoma  
(MF-CTCL), there is a dearth of epi[INVESTIGATOR_626723].  While 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_626724] ( MCH) has  
been used since the 1950s, prospective data describing the clinical course of MF -CTCL is limited. Valchlor gel is a new formulation 
of MCH (or nitrogen mustard) that has been shown to be safe and 
effective in a clinical trial and has been approved for Stage I 
MF-CTCL patients   
Prospective data on Valchlor are currently only available from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], randomized, controlled clinical trial  
with strict inclusion 
and exclusion criteria. Understanding real -world patient safety and 
tolerability , as well as  compliance and discontinuation rates , will 
assist with the management of Valchlor -treated MF -CTCL patients. 
This study will build and extend on the data from the Valchlor 
clinical development program,  increase the understanding of the 
use of Valchlor in patients with MF -CTCL and, while limited to 
patients treated with Valchlor, will represent the largest prospective 
study with any given MF- CTCL treatment.  
This large, non -interventional study will provide information on the 
use of Valchlor in a ‘real -world’ clin ical practice setting, and 
increase understanding of the management and outcomes of 
Valchlor-treated MF -CTCL patients. Data collected includes, but is 
not limited to: outcomes (e.g. , clinical status and healthcare 
utilization [MF -CTCL-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626725]]), adverse events  (AEs; e.g., dermatitis), clinical 
characteristics, and treatment patterns. Finally, this study will 
document disease burden (e.g., pruritus) of MF -CTCL in a real -life 
MF-CTCL

 setting by [CONTACT_626752] -completed s ymptoms and quality of 
life (QOL) questionnaires for patients with skin disease. The QOL 
tools include VAS, Skindex -29 and a newly validated  Mycosis 
fungoides / Sézary syndrome -type cutaneous T -cell lymphoma  
(MF/SS-CTCL) questionnaires. 
RESEARCH 
QUESTION AND 
OBJECTIVES  The objectives of th is study are:  
• To describe clinical characteristics of patients treated with 
Valchlor at enrol lment and during the study observation period. 
• To describe treatment and response assessment patterns of 
patients with MF -CTCL treated with Valchlor at enrol lment and 
during the study observation period. 
• To assess outcomes (e.g., clinical status  and rates of healthcare 
utilization  [MF-CTCL-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626726]]) in patients with MF -CTCL treated with Valchlor 
during the study observation period. 
• To collect and describe the incidence of  AEs/serious adverse 
events (SAEs) in patients with MF -CTCL treated with Valchlor :  
o To estimate the incidence of dermatitis  in patients using 
Valchlor during the study observation period. 
o To describe the management of dermatitis in patients 
using Valchlor at enrol lment and during the study 
observation period.  
• To collect patient-completed  symptoms and QOL 
questionnaires. 
STUDY DESIGN  This is a multi -center, prospective, ob servational, U S-based drug 
study. 
All consecutive MF -CTCL patients being treated with Valchlor will 
be invited to enroll in this study. 
Patients will undergo clinical assessments and receive standard 
medical care, as determined by [CONTACT_102] s’ physician , in the 
real-world setting. With the e xception of protocol- required 
patient-completed  questionnaires for symptoms and QOL, there are 
no specific or mandated clinical assessments to be performed, and 
patients will not receive experimental intervention or tre atment as a 
consequence of the ir participation in this study.  
Patients will be followed p rospectively for a maximum of 2 years 
MF-CTCL

 from the date of signed informed consent (enrollment) until end of 
study, which includes withdrawal of consent, loss to follow -up, 
death, or  study completion. Continuation in the study is not 
contingent on continuation of Valchlor.    
Patients currently enrolled and ongoing or newly enrolled will be 
offered to participate in the 24-month study of this protocol 
Amendment 1. Patients who enrolled under the original protocol 
(prior to Amendment 1)  and are still ongoing in the study will be 
re-consented  and to follow data collection specified in Table [ADDRESS_835188] completed 1 year of the study under 
the original protocol will not be re -consented under Amendment 1.  
POPULATION 
(SETTING AND 
STUDY POPULATION)  This study will enroll approximately 300 consecutive patients 
diagnosed with MF -CTCL and being  treated with Valchlor, 
regardless of other MF -CTCL therapi[INVESTIGATOR_626727]. Patients will be enrolled from up to 50 participating 
centers/clinics in university -affiliated or community hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626728]. The participation of physicians  and patients in the study is on a 
voluntary basis.

• All adult patients (≥  18 years of age) diagnosed with MF -CTCL 
and being treated with Valchlor. This includes patients newly 
initiating Valchlor OR patients continuing treatment with 
Valchlor: 
o Patients newly initiating Valchlor are patients who have 
their first office visit after having initiated Valchlor.  
o Patients continuing treatment with Valchlor include s 
patients who are actively taking Valchlor on the day of  
enrollment. 
o Signed patient informed consent. 
Exclusion c riteria: 
• None

 Patient-completed questionnaires : 
o Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pruritus (scale 0 –10).  
o Skindex-29. 
o MF/SS CTCL . 
DATA SOURCES  Information will be collected per routine clinical practice. No 
specific clinical mandated assessments are to be performed as part 
of study participation. Patient -completed questionnaires, however, 
are a study requirement and will be collected at all clinic visits 
during the study observation period. These questionnaires will be 
administered on paper by [CONTACT_95002]. Patient clinical data 
(non-patient-completed) will be collected from the patient’s 
medical records at enrollment and throughout the study period. All 
data will be entered into electronic Case Report Forms (eCRF s) at 
the time of collection or on a quarterly basis by [CONTACT_95002]. 
AEs and SAEs whether or not related to Valchlor will be entered 
into the eCRF at every visit and upon notification by [CONTACT_102] 
(e.g., reported via phone call). 
For patients who do not have any visits, an affirmative response 
that the patient is still under care by [CONTACT_626753], so that the absence of reported assessments can be 
interpreted the same as the actual absence of actual assessments.  
Pre-treatment information will be collected at the time of 
enrollment  using the following variables: 
• Weight  
• TNMB classification  
• Use of Valchlor and  other MF- CTCL treatments  
• Assessmen ts used to define response ( whether or not the 
assessment was ever performed , and regardless of whether the 
assessment was used to assess response for a pre viously treated

Patients who enrolled under the original protocol and are still 
ongoing in the study will be contact[CONTACT_626754] 1 protocol. Patients prospective data 
will be collected up to  a total of 24 months  from the original 
enrollment date.  
STUDY SIZE  This study will enroll approxima tely 300 patients diagnosed with 
MF-CTCL who are being treated with Valchlor . 
A sample size of 270 evaluable patients is needed to estimate the percentage of patients with clinical status  and the rate of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], both with a margin of  error of 6 p ercentage points. 
Assuming that up to 10% of patients may be non- evaluable due to 
incomplete follow -up, the sample size target for enrollment should 
be 300. It is projected that approximately 200 evaluable patients 
currently enrolled will be re-consented a nd newly enrolled will be 
consented under Amendment 1 for a 2-year follow -up. The margin 
of error for 200 evaluable patients will be 7%. 
Additionally, it is important to be able to estimate these same

3 RATIONALE AND BACKGROUND 
Background  
Mycosis fungoides cutaneous T -cell lymphoma (MF -CTCL) can present as patches, 
plaques, or tumors on the skin, often in areas of the body that are not usually exposed to 
the sun [Lymphoma.org 2011] . While MF-CTCL is rare, it is the most common type of 
cutaneous T -cell lymphoma  (CTCL), accounting for 50–70% of all CTCLs [Imam 2013] . 
It is estimated that approximately 16,[ADDRESS_835196] the disease and 
that the 5-year incidence of MF -CTCL for all stages  was 0.56 per 100,000 person- years 
between 2005–2009 [Korgavkar 2013, Leukemia & Lymphoma Society  2011]. The 
prevalence and incidence of MF -CTCL are likely to be under -reported due to 
nomenclature variances and because the symptoms and skin biopsy findings can appear 
similar to other types of skin conditions [Lymphoma.org 2011, Criscione 2007] . Patients 
frequently presen t with early stage disease t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_19353] a favo rable prognosis 
and survival of 10–35 years, but over 25% progress to advanced disease with a median 
survival of less than [ADDRESS_835197] 13 months in those with nodal involvement 
[Scarisbrick 2014] . The most important clinical predictive factors for survival include 
patient age, T classification, and the presence of extracutaneous disease [Kim 2003a ]. 
Although there is currently no cure for the dis ease, patients diagnosed at early stages of 
MF-CTCL (Stages IA, IB, or II A) and receiving treatment for the disease have a median 
survival of 35.5, 21.5, and 15.8 years, respectively  [Agar 2010] . Topi[INVESTIGATOR_626733] ( MCH or nitrogen mustard) has been used to treat 
MF-CTCL

 MF-CTCL since the 1950s  [Lessin 2013] . The National Comprehensive Cancer Network  
[NCCN] Guidelines list topi[INVESTIGATOR_626734] a primary skin -directed treatment option for 
patients with MF -CTCL with limited/localized skin involvement or for generalized skin 
involvement [ NCCN 2014] . Topi[INVESTIGATOR_626735]- based forms. However, both forms have disadvantages that limit patient 
acceptance [Kim 2003b, Ramsay 1995] .  
Valchlor, approved by [CONTACT_243914] [ADDRESS_835198]-drying, greaseless gel formulation that has been shown to be effective and safe in a 
clinical trial [Lessin 2013] . Two hundred sixty (260) patients in the Valchlor clinical trial  
(Study 201)  received MF -CTCL specific treatment up to 12 months  [Lessin 2013] . In the 
open-label, single group extension trial, 98 patients who completed Study 201 without a 
complete response received treatment with a formulation identical to Valchlor but 
containing MCH HCl 0.04% for 7 months. Currently, Valchlor is the only FDA -approved 
formulation of topi[INVESTIGATOR_626736], and one of two FDA -approved topi[INVESTIGATOR_626737]-CTCL [Kim 2014] . The results of the randomized, controlled, multi -center trial 
confirmed the non- inferiority of Valchlor in the treatment of MF -CTCL when compared 
to ointment- based MCH. 
Rationale 
Prospective data on Valchlor are currently only available from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], randomized, 
controlled clinical trial with strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. Understanding 
real-world patient safety and tolerability , as well as  compliance and discontinuation rates , 
will assist with the future management of Valchlor -treated MF -CTCL patients. This study 
will build and extend on the data from the Valchlor clinical development program, 
increase the understanding of the use of Valchlor in patients with MF -CTCL and, while 
limited to patients treated with Valchlor, will represent the largest prospective study with 
any given MF -CTCL treatment.  
This large, non- interventional study will provide information on the use of Valchlor in a 
‘real-world’ clinical practice setting. This study will increase understanding of the 
management and outcomes of Valchlor-treated MF -CTCL patients by [CONTACT_626756], treatment patterns, outcomes (e.g., clinical status  and healthcare 
utilization [ MF-CTCL-related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_306134]]) , and adverse 
events (AEs). Additionally, a better understanding of the disease burden of MF -CTCL 
will be gained by [CONTACT_626752]- completed symptoms and quality of life  (QOL) 
questionnaires.

• To collect patient -completed symptoms and QOL questionnaires. 
[ADDRESS_835199] medical care as determined by [CONTACT_102]’s physician in a real -world setting.  
Patients will be followed prospectively for a maximum of 2 years from the date of signed 
informed consent until end of study (EOS), which includes withdrawa l of consent, loss to 
follow-up, death, or  study completion . Continuation in the study is not contingent on 
continuation of Valchlor. 
The study will end after all enrolled  patients have been  followed for 2 years, or 
discontinued from the study for any reason.  
5.2 Population (setting and study population) 
This study will enroll approximately 300 MF-CTCL patients being treated (newly 
initiated or continuing treatment) with Valchlor  [see Section 5.2.1 for details ] from up to 
50 participating center s/clinics in university -affiliated or community hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].

 Patients considered ‘being treated with Valchlor ’ is comprised of two distinct groups: 
1) Patients newly initiating Valchlor. These are patients who are enrolled at their first 
office visit after having initiated Valchlor; 2) Patients continuing treatment with Valc hlor. 
Patients must be actively taking Valchlor on the day of enrollment.  
All consecutive MF -CTCL patients being treated with Valchlor  [see Section 5.2.1 for 
details] seen at the participating centers are eligible for enrollment in the study , regardless 
of other MF- CTCL therapi[INVESTIGATOR_626738]. 
5.2.1 Inclusion criteria  
• All adult patients (≥  18 years of age) diagnosed with MF -CTCL and being treated 
with Valchlor. This includes patients newly initiating Valchlor OR patients continuing treatment with Valchlor : 
o Patients newly initiating Valchlor are patients who have their first office visit 
after having initiated Valchlor .  
o Patients continuing treatment with Valchlor includes patients who are actively taking Valchlor on the day of enrollment. 
• Signed patient informed consent. 
5.2.2 Exclusion criteria  
• None. 
5.[ADDRESS_835200] for this study include s clinical characteristics at enrollment  and 
during the study observation period, treatment patterns, clinical status , as assessed by [CONTACT_24201]  (including the methods used in practice to assess cli nical status), 
MF-CTCL-related healthcare utilization, as assessed by [CONTACT_099] (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626739]), AEs and SAEs, patient -completed symptoms and QOL 
questionnaires. 
Data elements to be collected from the patient’s medical reco rd at study enrollment and at 
post-enrollment follow -up visits are shown in Table 1. Additionally, pre -treatment data 
collection using specific variables wi ll be performed at enrollment. These variables 
include weight, tumor-node- metastasis -blood (TNMB) classification, use of Valchlor and 
other MF -CTCL treatments, and clinical status assessments. Drug holidays (temporary 
discontinuation) from Valchlor will be captured on the electronic Case Report Form 
(eCRF) by [CONTACT_626757] -CTCL treatments . Patient-completed 
questionnaires will be administered to patients who can read and understand English or 
Spanish and are able to self -complete the questionnaires based on the investigator’s 
assessment. Patients who are unable to read and understand English or Spanish will not 
be asked to complete the questionnaires and will be excluded from the study.

 New AEs and SAEs  that occur more than 30 days after discontinuation of Valchlor will be reported to 
Actelion US Drug Safety if investigator feels there is a possible cau sal relationship with Valchlor.  
Investigators are also expected to assess patients for AEs and SAEs and  follow the appropriate reporting 
procedures per Section 7. 
+All ongoing AEs and SAEs for patients being treated [see Section  5.2.1 for definition of “ being treated”] 
with Valchlor.  
^All reports of secondary exposures, as available,  will be counted on the eCRFs . Additional information 
regarding secondary exposures will be forwarded directly to Actelion US Drug Safety via the Secondary 
Exposure Form. Refer to Section 7.1.1 for definition of secondary exposure.

1Re-consent at the first follow up visit for subjects who are currently active in the study prior to 
Amendment 1.  
5.3.[ADDRESS_835203] for this study are clinical characteristics, 
treatment patterns, clinical status , as assessed by [CONTACT_941] p hysician (and the methods used in 
practice to assess clinical status), MF -CTCL-related healthcare utilization, as assessed by 
[CONTACT_099] (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_306134]), AEs and SAEs (e.g., 
dermatitis), and patient- completed symptoms and QO L questionnair es. Due to expected 
variability in practice patterns, no individual method of determining response , either at 
follow-up or in tandem with a prior assessment,  is mandated and a subjective categorical 
assessment of response will be included in addition to quantitative measures of response, but assessments that do occur must be captured prospectively. Additionally, it is 
important to capture which methods were used pre -study, even where results may not be 
available, so that it is clear which assessments have a prior assessment  that may have 
been considered in the physician’s evaluation of response.  
For patients who do not have any assessments, an affirmative response that the patient is 
still under care by [CONTACT_626759].  
The following specific outcomes and variables of interest will be evaluated:  
Clinical characteristics at enrollment  and during study observation period. 
Relevant medical history, including TNMB classification . 
Use of prior MF-CTCL treatments . 
Treatment patterns, including prescribing information, for the treatment of MF -CTCL 
(including dosing regimens, titration schemes, duration of time from initiatio n to 
discontinuation of therapy, and drug holidays for Valchlor).

 Medical history of previous and ongoing clinically significant underlying diseases and 
comorbid conditions. 
Prior exposure to Valchlor and other MF- CTCL specific therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . 
5.4 Data sources  
Data elements to be collected include the following: patient demographics , personal and 
family medical history , including MF -CTCL diagnosis date and etiology, c urrent and 
historical MF-CTCL treatments , clinical status  (as assessed by [CONTACT_099]), and which 
assessments were used to define response, MF -CTCL-related healthcare utilization (as 
assessed by [CONTACT_099]), AEs and SAEs whether or not related to Valchlor, deaths, 
patient-completed symptoms and QOL questionnaires. Table 1 provides an overview of 
the variables collected at enrollment and during the observation period [see Section  5.3.2 
for definition] . For patients who do not have any visits, an affirmative response that the 
patient is still under care by [CONTACT_626760], so that the absence of reported assessments  can be interpreted the same as the absence of actual assessments . 
Since this is a  real-world, observational study, there are a number of sources of bias that 
could potentially affect any conclusions that may be drawn. The methods used to minimize these sources of bias in this study are detailed below [see Section  5.9]. 
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_626740]-CTCL during the course of this study are under the direction of 
the participating physician and not the study protocol. As this study collects data on both 
incident patients and prevalent patients, it is necessary to include the date of diagnosis in the data collection forms, in order to minimize potential survivor bias effect. 
5.[ADDRESS_835205] a n approximate enrollment of 300 patients diagnosed with 
MF-CTCL who are being treated with Valchlor  (newly initiated or continuing treatment) .  
A sample size of 270 evaluable patients is needed to estimate the percentage of patients with clinical status  and the percentage of patients with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], both with a 
margin of  error of 6 percentage points. Assuming that up to 10% of patients may be 
non-evaluable due to incomplete follow -up, the sample size target for enrollment should 
be 300.  
It is projected that approximately 200 evaluable patients will be re -consented under 
Amendment 1. The margin of error for 200 evalua ble patients will be 7%.  
Additionally, it is important to be able to estimate these same percentages with a margin 
of error of [ADDRESS_835206] or more of the patient population (e.g., patients newly initi ating Valchlor) . A total of 100 patients are 
required to achieve a margin of error of 10 percentage poi nts per subgroup, so that a total 
enrollment of 300 patients is needed .

13 December  2016, page 26/[ADDRESS_835207] data on MF -CTCL patients being treated with Valchlor [see 
Section 5.2.1 for inclusion criteria ] under routine clinical care. This will include both data 
collected from assessments that are routinely perform ed for MF -CTCL patients being 
treated with Valchlor in clinical practice, and additional data from further assessments 
that may be performed.  
No specific clinical ly mandated assessments are to be performed as part of study 
participation. Patient- completed questionnaires, however, are a study requirement and 
will be collected at all clinic visits during  the study observation period. These 
questionnaires will be administered on paper by [CONTACT_95002]. Patient clinical data (non-patient-completed) will be  collected from the patient’s medical records at 
enrollment and throughout the study period. All data will be entered into an eCRF at the 
time of collection or on a quarterly basis by [CONTACT_95002]. AEs, reports of secondary exposure, and SAEs whether  or not related to Valchlor will be entered into the eCRF at 
every visit  and upon notification by [CONTACT_102] (e.g., reported via phone call). 
A secure, Internet -based electronic data collection (EDC) system will be used for data 
entry and hosting. An audi t trail will be maintained by [CONTACT_626761], indicating what entries/changes have been made, who made them, and when. Data will be encrypted when transferred over the Internet and will be stored in a secure database protected from unauthorized access.  
All data collected will be de-identified before transmission to the central study 
coordinating center. Patient names will not be collected. Other patient identifiers will be 
collected in order to allow identification of study patients when SAEs are received by [CONTACT_626762] [see Section  7.4].  
All SAE data entered into the Adverse Event (AE) /Adverse D rug Reaction (ADR) Form 
and all reports of secondary exposure will be transfe rred electronically and/or by [CONTACT_626763]. In addition, all AE  data, reports of secondary exposure , and SAE data will be 
entered into the study eCRF.

Epi[INVESTIGATOR_626720]-079A501  
Version  3 
13 December  2016, page 27/[ADDRESS_835208] methods of 
assessing response will be similarly analyzed separately for the two groups. The methods 
used for assessment of response (i.e., assessed with that method versus not assessed with that method, either at follow -up alone or in tandem with a prior assessment ) will be 
reported as cumulative percentages over time and also as a percentage of first visits, second visits, etc. To minimize the potential impact of missing data, analyses will focus 
on variables that are available for all patients, such as whether a particular type of assessment occurred, rather than focusing on the results of a particular assessment. Analyses of response, based on a particular measure of response, will be limited to patients for whom that measure was reported. Therefore, patients with reported data will 
be compared to patients without any reported data with respect to demographics and pre-treatment clinical status  to identify potential biases.  The summary of response rates 
will be tabulated and the definition of response will be detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan. 
5.7.2 Clinical characteristics  
Analyses of prior treatment, assessments, and relevant medical history  will be 
summarized for all patients enrolled and also grouped separately for  patients newly 
initiating Valchlor versus patients continuing on Valchlor . Percentages will generally be 
computed as a function of non- missing data; however, if a large amount of data are 
missing for some historical data, a comparison of patients with missing and non- missing 
data may be necessary to ensure generalizability based on non -missing data alone.  
5.7.3 Treatment and a ssessment patterns  
Because relatively little prospectively collected data is available on MF -CTCL treatment 
patterns, preliminary analysis will make use of patient listings to develop categories of treatment patterns. Categories will be developed without cross -referencing outcomes data 
to minimize bias (i.e., the focus will be the presence of specific assessments, not the test value associated with the assessment).  Treatments individually and in combination will 
be reported in percentage terms, by [CONTACT_765], stratified by [CONTACT_626764].  
Duration of time from first post-initiation of Valchlor  office visit to discontinuation of 
therapy will be assessed using Kaplan -Meier estimates of freedom from discontinuation. 
If short-term gaps in therapy are common, sensitivity analyses may be conducted in 
which these gaps do or do not count as treatment discontinuations, depending on the lengths of the gaps. These analyses will focus only on newly initiated patients .

 5.7.4 Clinical outcomes  
The main clinical outcomes that will be analyzed are clinical response, as assessed by [CONTACT_24201],  and MF-CTCL-related healthcare uti lization, as assessed by [CONTACT_099]  
(e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_306134]) . Rates of on -study hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626741]-study days.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] -free surviv al will be computed using Kaplan- Meier 
estimates.  
Because a wide variation in assessments of clinical response is expected, the clinician ’s 
subjective evaluation of response will be summarized in addition to reporting the 
proportion of responses among pati ents for whom specific tests were performed. The 
subjective response will be cross -classified by [CONTACT_626765]. Th e 
summary of response data  is primarily a descriptive analysis to better understand how 
and when physicians define response, and it does not represent an estimate of the efficacy 
of any MF -CTCL treatment.  
5.7.[ADDRESS_835209] (e.g. , dermatitis) will be summarized 
separately. SAEs will be displayed in patient listings , both including and excluding 
events that were not concurrent with Valchlor exposure. The definition of an on-study 
event is one that occurs on the day of enrollment or later, but before the date of study 
discontinuation or completion. 
5.7.6 Patient -completed  questionnaires  
The Skindex-29 is a questionnai re that results in three scales:  emotions, symptoms, and 
functioning [Chren 1996 , Chren 1997a , Chren 1997b, Chren 2001] . Appendix A  shows 
the items in the Skindex -[ADDRESS_835210] transformed to a 
linear 0–100 scale where responses of “Never”, “Rarely”, “Sometimes”, “Often”, and 
“All the time” are converted to values of 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100, respectively. Next, the mean of the non- missing items for each scale is computed to derive a scale score. 
Although missing data for individual items is allowed, no scale score will be computed if more than quarter  of the items in the scale are missing.  
The VAS for pruritus is a single value [Reich 2012 ] and is shown in Appendix C . 
The MF/SS-CTCL questionnaire  contains 12 questions [PatientsLikeMe 2016] and is 
shown in Appendix D . 
At each study visit (1
st, 2nd, etc.), the VAS for pruritus, the three scales of the Skindex -29 
and the MF/SS-CTCL will be computed for patients who are and are not responders , 
MF-CTCL

 based on clinician assessment,  at the time of that visit. These descriptive cross -sectional 
comparisons are intended to assess burden of disease in a Valc hlor-treated cohort over 
time. The data related to all three question naires (VAS, Skindex -29, MF/SS -CTCL) will 
be collected on the QOL ques tionnaires.  
5.[ADDRESS_835211] study data, patient medical records, and eCRFs.  
No source data verification is mandated . However, the data will be reviewed on a n 
ongoing basis for implausible data points, missing data points, assessments not 
conducted, and/or incomplete information. This review may result in queries to the sites. 
Centralized remote monitoring of patient data will be performed via the EDC tool. This approach will allow proactive monitoring and querying of data on an ongoing and regular 
basis with concentrated efforts on key data points (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], death, Valchlor interruption and discontinuation, AEs and SAEs, and secondary exposures) to enc ourage 
low rates of missing information. Communication with investigators and study coordinators will emphasize the importance of data entry completion. Analytical methods described in Section 5.[ADDRESS_835212] on inferential estimates.  
5.9 Discussion of the study methods (including limitations) 
This study is an observational, prospective study examining MF -CTCL patients being 
treated with Valchlor in a real -world clinical setting. Valchlor treatment will be based on 
prescriber decision and will not be influenced by [CONTACT_50568]. The patients will be followed by [CONTACT_626766]. The study protocol does not mandate any treatment, procedures or visits. Patient -completed 
questionnaires, however, are a study requirement and will be administered at all study visits for patients who can read and understand English, and are physically and mentally able to complete the questionnaire s based on the investigator’s assessment.  
Any interpretation of observational study results should consider limitations to observational real -world study designs, including potential sources of selection or 
information biases, and confounding factors . 
To minimize selection bias, participating centers will offer enrollment in the study to all 
consecutive MF -CTCL patients currently treated with Valchlor  [see Section 5.2.1 for 
inclusion criteria ], regardless of other MF -CTCL specific therapy received before or at 
MF-CTCL

information as described per Table 1 (enrollment visit). Thereafter, all data will be 
collected during the observation period. 
Patients who are enrolled under the original protocol  prior to protocol Amendment 1 and 
are still ongoing in the study  will be re -consented  under Amendment 1 and will continue 
to follow the schedule of Table 1 eCRF Data Collection specified in this protocol  up to 
end of study  (Month 24) . Patients who enrolled and have completed [ADDRESS_835214] a patient before she/he is considered 
lost to follow-up. 
 
[ADDRESS_835215]/Independent Ethics Committee approval 
Depending on local regulations and the physician’s institutional policies, and in 
compliance with local law, the physician may have to submit the study protocol, the form 
for the Patient Informed Consent, and other relevant information to an Institutional 
Review Board  (IRB) / Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) , local health authorities, data 
protection agency or others. Approval from the IRB/IEC must be obtained before going through a consent procedure with the patient and before entering data into the database. IRB/IEC information/approval must be documented in a letter to the physician, clearly 
identifying the study, the documents reviewed, and the date of approval.

therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product. 
AEs include: 
Recurrence or worsening of a pre -existing disease.  
Increase in frequency or intensity of symptoms of a pre -existing disease or medical 
condition. 
Continuous persistent disease or symptoms present at initiation of treatment or 
enrollment, which occurs first, that worsen following the start of the study. Lack of efficacy in the acute treatment of a life- threatening disease  Abnormal 
assessments, e.g., ECG, vital signs, or physical examination findings, if they represent a 
clinically significant finding that was not present at initiation of treatment or enrollment, 
which occurs first, or worsened during the course of the study  or led to dose reduction, 
interruption or permanent discontinuation of Valchlor. 
Laboratory test abnormalities if they represent a clinically significant finding, 
symptomatic or not, which were not present at initiation of treatment or enrollment, 
which occurs first, or worsened during the course of the study or led to dose reduction, 
interruption or permanent discontinuation of Valchlor. In addition to AEs, exposure during pregnancy or lactation, product complaints, 
medication errors, overdose, misuse, abuse, occupational exposure and transmission of an infectious agent via Valchlor and  the identification of a potential counterfeit medicinal 
product needs to be reported.  
Reports of off -label use without an associated AE collected within non-interventional 
studies shall be included in final study reports. Reports of inadvertent secondary  exposure to the skin, mucous membranes, and eyes of 
individuals other than the patient being treated (e.g., patient’s caregiver or family 
member).

 AEs do not include: 
Medical procedures such as surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction. However, the event that

Fatal. 
Life-threatening: refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event. It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death had it 
been more severe. 
Requiring inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Resulting in persistent or significant disability or incapacity . 
Congenital anomaly or birth defect. Medically significant: refers to important medical events that may not immediately result 
in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626743], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject, and may require medical or surgical inte rvention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the 
definitions above. 
The following reasons for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626744]:  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_78429], or social and/or convenience reasons. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626745]-planned (prior to enrollment) standard monitoring of a 
pre-existing disease (present at enrollment) or medical condition that did not worsen, e.g., 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_42865] a patient with stable angina pectoris. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626746] a pre- existing disease (present at enrollment) or 
medical condition that did not worsen, e.g., elective hip replacement for arthritis. New AEs and SAEs that occur >  30 days after the discontinuation of Valchlor  unless 
there is a reas onable possibility of causal relationship to Valchlor. 
However, complications that occur during such hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626747] (for 
example, if a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) and must be reported as described 
below.

possibility of causal relationship to Valchlor, and reported as either related or unrelated. 
The determination of the likelihood that Valchlor caused the A E will be provided by [CONTACT_26368] a qualified physician.  
Related to Valchlor 
This category applies to any AE (whether serious or not) that appears to have a 
reasonable possibility of causal relationship to the use of Valchlor (i.e., a relationsh ip 
cannot be ruled out). Guidelines to determine whether an event might be considered 
related include (but are not limited to) the following:  
There is temporal relationship between the occurrence of the event and the administration of Valchlor. 
The event abated (diminished) or disappeared when treatment with Valchlor was down-
titrated, interrupted, or discontinued.  
The event recurred when treatment was re-introduced.  
Unrelated to Valchlor  
This category applies to any AE  (whether serious or not)  that does not appear to have a 
reasonable relationship to the use of Valchlor (see above guidelines).  Environmental 
factors such as clinical state and other treatments could equally have caused the event.  
7.2 Secondary exposures, AE and SAE reporting to Actelion US Drug Safety 
All reports of secondary exposure s and all AEs will be recorded on the eCRFs and 
captured in the EDC clinical database. The AE data will be forwarded  to Actelion US 
Drug Safety at predetermined intervals.  
All SAEs  (including secondary exposures) which occur after initiation of Valchlor 
treatment until [ADDRESS_835219] be recorded on an AE/ADR Form. Cases of secondary 
exposure must recorded on the  Secondary Exposure F orm and submitted directly to 
Actelion US Drug Safety . The AE/ADR Form will be pre -populated with the information 
already entered in the eCRF, and it is the physician ’s responsibility to complete , print, 
and sign the form  and forward to Actelion US Drug Safety directly, within 1 working day

7.2.1 Follow- up of SAEs  
Actelion US Drug safety will evaluate and process all safety reports received. If follow-up information is required, Actelion US Drug Safety will send a Data 
Clarification Form (DCF) directly to the investigator.   
Follow-up information about a previously reported SAE must be reported directly to 
Actelion US Drug Safety via the AE/ADR Form within 1 working day of the 
investigato r’s first knowledge of the event.  
If the subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_42868] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_626748] n the study site, it is the investigator’s 
responsibility to contact [CONTACT_42933][INVESTIGATOR_269376].

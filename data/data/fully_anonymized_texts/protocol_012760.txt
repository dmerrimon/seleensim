1.0 BACKGROUND, RATIONALE  
 
Background:  Interlocking screw placement in intramedullary nailing of femoral and tibial shaft fractures 
improves rotational and length stability.  However, free -hand perfect circle techniques can be 
technically challenging and may take up to an hour with  increased radiation exposure to the surgeon 
and patient (Whatling et al, Injury 2006).  Newer technologies aimed at reducing fluoroscope use such as electromagnetically -based aiming devices may increase operative time (Maqungo et al, JOT 2014).  
Proximall y-based jigs have been shown to reduce fluoroscopy time in cadavers (Miclau et al, Arch 
Orthop Tr Surg 1998), however have not been studied clinically.   
We propose a prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing a modern proximally -based distal 
targe ting device and free -hand techniques for placement of interlocking screws in lower extremity 
nailing.

 2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
Outcomes:  
• Primary outcomes: radiation exposure, time, accuracy of placement (right angle to rod).  
o Each distal interlock will be c onsidered a separate outcome  
 The first fluoroscopy shot to localize the jig or obtain a perfect circle is considered start time . The surgeon will note the hour, minute, and seconds of 
the time based on the wall clock in the operating room.  
 The last shot to  confirm complete seating of the screw will be considered end 
time . The surgeon will note the hour, minute, and seconds of the time based on 
the wall clock in the operating room.   
• Secondary outcomes:  
o accuracy of placement (right angle to intramedullary n ail).  
o Number of complete misses of the nail with the drill or the screw  
o comparison of learning curve between distal targeter and freehand techniques stratified by [CONTACT_713882]  
 The level of training of the surgeon  
 Experience level of the surgeon  
• estim ated number total number of intramedullary nails placed  
• time since the last intramedullary nail placement  
• estimated number of nails placed per month over the last year  
• number of times the surgeon has used the distal targeting system  
o Comparison of tibia vs femur antegrade nails  
 
3.0 STUDY POPULATION  
 3.1 SELECTION OF THE STUDY POPULATION  
Patients for this study will be drawn from the orthopedic trauma service. The majority of 
patients with these injuries will be approached in the inpatient setting, as they present 
through the emergency department. A small subset does present through clinic . All patients 
will be recruited to participate in the study after their femoral or tibia fracture repair.  
 3.2 INCLUSION CRITERIA  
• 18 years old a nd above  
• Undergoing intramedullary fixation of femur or tibia shaft for acute fracture or nonunion  
3.3 EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
• Prior ipsilateral tibial or femoral nail  
• Patients who cannot have interlocking screws placed  
• Pregnant patients  
• For sub -study  only: r etrograde nails  
3.[ADDRESS_972284] RECRUITMENT  
Patients will be recruited from all full- time  orthopaedic  trauma faculty. The treating surgeon and/or 
clinical research associate will approach patients in person to recruit, enroll and consent them for the 
study. No advertisement will be used for this study.   
4.[ADDRESS_972285] of the following 
mont h. The method of screw placement will alternate each week until enrollment is complete. 
This method of enrollment for clinical modalities that are already in common use has previously 
been described with the PREP -IT trials. [ Slobogean et al, JAMA Netw Open  2020 ] 
2. Due to the nature of the distal targeting jig’s construction, there may be instances where its use 
is not possible due to interference with other surgical instrumentation, and an intraoperative 
decision must be made to place screws with the freehand  technique. Patients randomized to the 
jig-based placement arm but are ultimately treated with freehand placement will be 
documented and reported as crossover patients (per the CONSORT framework).  
3. Patients randomized to their respective groups will ultimat ely undergo intention -to-treat 
analysis.  
 
 
5.0 DATA COLLECTION AND  MANAGEMENT  
 5.1 DATA PROCUREMENT  
Data for this study will be procured from patient x -ray images retrieved from the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_713881] (PACS).   Deidentified x -ray 
measurements will be stored in a HIPAA compliant Cedars Box folder.    
 
 5.2 TIME PERIOD OF DATA UNDER REVIEW   
Data collection will proceed prospectively from the date of study initiation and continue 
for approximately 1 year.   
Information will be kept for a minimum of 2 years  
5.3 VARIABLES COLLECTED  
• The following data points/variables will be collected:  
o Patient  name 
o MRN  
o Date of surgery  
o Length of surgery  
o Type of injury  
Page 6 of 8 
HRP-652-Protocol Template_Investigator -Initiated Clinical Research_05 -17-19 
 o Type of procedure  
o Radiation exposure  
5.4 SOURCE DOCUMENTS  
Source documents for this study will be radiographic images which we will take 
measurements from using PACS software and incorporated into a deidentified, secure 
database.   
5.5 DATA COLLECTION AND STORAGE   
• Data will be collected and stored electronically    
• Stored data will be secured via REDCap    
• Only the members of the research team will have access to data   
• Patients will be deidentified at time of measurement  
5.6 CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY OF DATA  
Secure storage:  Data will be housed in a HIPAA -compliant secure storage system, 
like REDCap  or Box, within the Cedars -Sinai network with access restricted to app roved 
members of the research team.    
  
Limited Access:  Private identifiable information, will be accessible only to IRB approved study 
team members with current IRB training.   
  
Unique ID Numbers:  Each patient will be assigned a unique ID number.   
  
Removal of Identifiers:  Direct identifiers (like name [CONTACT_185486]) will be removed from the 
research records and destroyed as soon as scientifically possible and maintained only as long as 
necessary to abstract, analyze and verify data.   
6.[ADDRESS_972286] the study’s medical monitor. Adverse events will be assessed from the time of the start of the index surgery (first incision) and at all follow -up visits and will include a brief description of the event as well as the 
duration and the outcome. An event is considered a serious adverse event if it results in death or leads to serious deterioration of the health of the subject. Unanticipated adverse device effect will be defined as any serious adverse effect on health or safety caused by [CONTACT_1282] a device or software program. Both of these types of adverse events will be reported to the IRB within 24 hours.     
6.2 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
The clinical monitor will verify that appropriate data is recorded for all study subjects 
for whom informed consent is obtained; and that no study specific procedures or 
treatments are administered without informed  consent.

 7.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 7.1 STUDY OUTCOME MEASURES  
• Primary Outcome analysis: [ADDRESS_972287] for average length of surgery (skin to skin), average 
time to place 2 interlocks (start time when nail is seated and surgeon states s/he is ready to 
proceed with distal interlocking screw placement). Average radiation used in microGrays . Femur 
vs tibia average time to place [ADDRESS_972288] 
performed both DT and FH techniques more than 5 times will be included.  
• Secondary outcomes: t- test accuracy of screw placement (perpendicular to nail)  
o Multivariate regression evaluating predictors of time to placement  
 Level of training  
 Number of cases perf ormed  
 Number of interlocking screws placed  
 Time since last case  
o Learning curve assessment  
 Time of each interlocking screw placement will be correlated with number of 
interlocking screws placed  
 Time of procedure and accuracy of placement will be analyzed in  increments of 
5 cases to evaluate for number of cases required to reach plateau  
• Data will be stratified by [CONTACT_713882]  
 
 7.2 SAMPLE SIZE CONSIDERATIONS   
• Power: Based on a more recent  paper from Konda et al, the average time for distal interlocking 
screw placement was [ADDRESS_972289] a 44% decrease in the amount of time required for distal interlocking screw 
placement with the distal targeter with 9 0% power at 5% significance. (sealedenvelope.com 
power calculator on -line)  
o Estimating a 75% participation rate, we intend to enroll 60 patients ( 30 in each cohort – 
tibia and femur surgeries ) that meet the sub -study criteria 
o Given that 9% of the currently enrolled patients (included in the main study ) will not 
meet  the sub -study criteria (retrograde nails  instead of antegrade ), we intend to e nroll a 
total of 66 total patients  for this study  (includes patients for main study and sub study) .

Screening and Baseline  
All the Screening assessments should be performed within 30 days prior to randomization on Day 1 (Visit 
2, Baseline), except in patient s who require prophylaxis of latent tuberculosis or a washout of current anti -
TNF medic ation or other biologic and non-biologic disease -modifying anti -rheumatic drug (DMARD ) 
treatment (except methotrexate [ MTX ]).  For these patient s the Screening Period may be extended to allow 
for the washout required, but will not exceed [ADDRESS_181108] course which includes two intravenous (i.v.)  1,000  mg study drug infusions: 
one on Day  1 (Visit 2) and the second on Day  15 (Visit  5). Patient s will receive an anti -pyretic and an 
anti-histamine, e.g.,  paracetamol and diphenhydramine  or equivalent , 30 to 60  minutes before each 
infusion, plus 100  mg i.v. methyl prednisone  within  30 minutes prior to each infusion.  
Patient s with an inadequate response (<50% improvement from Baseline in both the swollen and tender 
joint counts) at Week 24 (Visit 12), will be eligible to receive the second  course of two 1,000  mg i.v. 
infusions (one at Week 2 4 and the second infusion  at Week 26 [14 days later ]) of study drug . 
On Day 1 and Day 15 (first and second infusion s) blood PK samples and PD (CD19+ B -cell) samples  will 
be collected before and 3 hours after the start of infusion and immediately  (within 10 minutes)  before and 
1 hour after the end of infusion , at 48 hours after the start of each infusion (Days 3 and 17 ). 
The PK /PD samples will also be taken at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 to estimate elimination.  
Blood PD samples will be  additionally  collected simultaneously at Weeks 36 and 52 . 
The main efficacy variable change from baseline in DAS 28 (Disease Activity Score) will be evaluated on 
completion of 2 4 weeks of study assessments.  
• All patient s will be followed up for up to [ADDRESS_181109] infusion . 
• Patient s will attend the study center  approximately every 12 weeks during Part B , from the start date 
of the second  course of infusions . Patient who are not eligible for the second course of study treatment  
will also attend all visits until week 52.  SAIT101 Arm (n = 94)

The PK analysis will be p erformed on the PK Analysis Set . The PK parameters, AUC 0-t, AUC 0-, AUC 0-
d15, Cmax after the second infusion on Day [ADDRESS_181115] squares means between each of the three pairs  (SAIT101  vs. MabThera®, 
SAIT101  vs. Rituxan®, and MabThera® vs. Rituxan® )  and the associated 90% confidenc e interval ( CI) 
will be determined.  Back transformation will provide the ratio of geometric means and 90% CI for this 
ratio. Equivalence will be concluded if the 90% CI for the ratio of geometric means of each of the three 
pairs  for primary endpoints  are completely contained within the accep tance interval of 0.8 to 1.25.  
Descriptive statistics (N, mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation (CV), minimum, median, and 
maximum) will be used to summarize serum concentration data by [CONTACT_156326].  Concentra tions that are below the lower limit of quantification will be assigned a value of 0 
for the purposes of computing descriptive statistics. Serum PK parameters calculated from the 
concentration -time data will also be summarized by [CONTACT_53431] e statistics.  
Plots of the mean and individual serum rituximab concentrations over time for SAIT101 and MabThera® 
or Rituxan® will be provided following i.v. infusion s.  
Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
Observed, change from Baseline, and percent change from Baseline in CD19+ B cell counts, depletion 
incidence for CD19+ B cell counts , time needed to B cell depletion , duration of CD19+ B cell depletion  
and IgG, IgM, IgA, CRP levels  will be summarized using descriptive statistics.   
Efficacy Analyses  
The change from Baseline in DAS28 at Week 24 will be considered the main  efficacy endpoint.  
Two-sided 95% CI for the difference between SAIT101 and MabThera® in DAS28 change from Baseline 
at Week 24 will be computed from an analysis of covariance using Bas eline DAS28 as covariate and 
treatment as model factors. Equivalence will be concluded if the 95% CI for the mean difference for main  
endpoint is completely contained with the equivalence margin of -0.6 to 0.6. Both of the per protocol (PP) 
set and full an alysis set (FAS) will be considered as the efficacy analysis  population and no missing data 
will be imputed for the efficacy analyses in FAS . 
Continuous variables will be summarized using N, mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, and 
maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized using frequency counts and percentages.  
Safety Analyses  
All reported terms for AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  
(MedDRA) . No statistical testing will be performed for AEs. For  all AE and SAE tables, patient s will be 
counted at most once for each Preferred T erm (PT) and each System Organ Class (SOC) . Adverse events 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_156327] s experiencing events by [CONTACT_2946] , PT and 
severity.  
Changes in vital signs and clinical laboratory measurements will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_765]. 
Other safety variables will be summarized and listed.  
Immunogenicity Analyses  
Incidence of HACA and neutralizing antibody and summary of c ounts of antibodies per patient  at prior 
first dose on Day 1 and at Week 1, 2, 4, 12, 16, 24, 36 and 52 will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_6490].  
Interim Analysis  
Interim Analyses of 10 patients per group ( 30 patients in total) of safety data collected up to Week 4 and 
20 patients per group ( 60 patients in total) of safety data collected up to Week 12 are planned.

The study will be unblinded at Week [ADDRESS_181116] 
Week 24 follow -up period .  
Sample Size 
A percentage co -efficient of variation (CV%) ranging from 26.3 to 37.3% for the five co -primary 
parameters is assumed for this study based on a recent study in RA patient s treated with rituximab.  
When the evaluable sample size in each group is 84, a three group design will have 81% power to reject 
both the null hypothesis that the ratio of test to standard geometrics means is below 0.800, and the null 
hypothesis that the ratio of test to standard geometrics means is above 1.250 (i.e., that the test and standard 
are not equivalent), in favor of the al ternative hypothesis, that the means of the two groups are equivalent, 
assuming that the expected ratio of means is 1.000, the CV% for the standard is 0.330, that data will be 
analyzed in the log scale using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and that each one s ided test is made at the 
5% level. Each of the 15 hypotheses tests (five co -primary endpoints × three pairwise  compar isons ) are 
powered at  98% to  99.0% to yield 81% study -wide power.  
Approximately 282 patient s (94 patient s per group) will be randomized in order to yield a minimum of 
84 patient s per group  to account for a presumed 10% withdraw al.  
This 94 patients in SAIT101 group and MabThera® group will provide 96% probability of declaring the 
equivalence in FAS  with each  one sided test at the 2.5% level , accounting for a presumed 1.[ADDRESS_181117] 
deviation of DAS28 from the REFLEX study, and the equivalence margin of -0.6 to 0.6 chosen as the half 
of a clinical meaningful improvement of 1.2 in DAS28. Considering 18% withdraw from the REFLEX 
study, approximately 77 patients per group will provide approximately 91% probability of declaring the 
equivalence in the PP set.

1.1 Background  
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)  is a chronic systemic inflammatory disorder characterized  by 
[CONTACT_156328], which is associated with progressive joint 
destruction, and depending on the severity, may be accompanied by [CONTACT_156329], rheumatoid nodules , and effect s on the 
cardiovascular s ystem.  If left untreated, RA may lead to severe functional disabilities, and 
therefore a considerable reduction in quality of life for the patient .1,2 The prevalence of RA 
is relatively constant in many populations, at 0.5  to 1%, but can vary with factors such as 
gender, race and smoking status .3 
B lymphocytes (B cells) are  thought to contribute considerably to the pathogenesis of RA. 
B cells contribute to the formation of immune complexes and complement activation in 
affected joints as they are the  primary source of rheumatoid factors (RFs)  and anti-cyclic 
citrullinated peptide (anti -CCP)  antibodies. They are highly efficient antigen -presenting 
cells and therefore contribute to the auto -immune response through downstream activation 
of T cells via co -stimulatory molecules. B cells respond to, and produce, chemokines and 
cytokines that promote lymphocyte infiltration into joints, formation of ectopic lymphoid 
structures, angiogenesis, and synovial hyperplasia that characterize  the pathology observed 
in the rheumatoid joint .4  
Traditionally, RA has been treated with a combination of anti -inflammatory agents and 
disease -modifying anti -rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). While therapeutic opt ions have 
improved  with the introduction of biologic  DMARDs,  neutralizing  cytokines such as tumor 
necrosis fac tor (TNF) and interleukin -1 (IL -1) which have been shown to both control signs 
and symptoms of joint inflammation and retard p rogression of joint destruction,  targeting 
other mediators and pathways might improve the overall response rate. Although TNF - 
antagonists and other biologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_156297] s with RA, there remains a significant unmet medical need fo r effective novel 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_156298] -responder rates and well -documented systemic 
toxicities of the traditional treatments.  
1.[ADDRESS_181131] rituximab  being developed by  [CONTACT_156330] . 
Similar  to rituximab,  SAIT101 has 1,328 amino acids with an approximate molecular weight of 
145 kDa with a similar glycan profile to rituximab , and is a  genetically engineered chimeric 
Protocol Number:  AGB 001    Version Amendment 04 , 27APR 2017 
27APR2017  22 Confidential  human/mouse glycosylated monoclonal antibody specific to  the human antigen CD20 
expressed on lymphocytes. SAIT101 consists of human IgG1 heavy  and kappa light chain 
constant regions, and murine heavy and light chain variable regions,  which is similar  to 
rituximab .4,5,6,7 It is produced by [CONTACT_156331] (CHO)  cell suspension culture and 
purified by [CONTACT_156332].  
SAIT101 has been demonstrated to be similar to MabThera® (rituximab licensed in the 
European Union) and Rituxan® (rituximab licensed in the [LOCATION_002]) in the extensive 
similarity studies using state -of-art techniques. Quality and in vitro characterization studie s 
have been performed to date.  
An in vitro stu dy confirmed that SAIT101 has similar pharmacological actions to rituximab , 
resulting from its binding to CD20 -positive antigen. In vivo efficacy studies using murine 
xenograft models confirmed similar profiles of tumor suppression activity for SAIT101, 
MabThera® and Rituxan®. 
Pharmacokinetics  (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) studies in cynomolgus monkeys have 
also shown similarity of PK/PD profiles between SAIT101 and rituximab . Furthermore, 
the single - and repeat -dose toxicity studies confirmed that SAIT101  did not show any 
toxicity at dose levels  up to 10 times higher than the clinical dose (~10 mg/kg). The single -
dose toxicity, repeat -dose toxicity, toxicokinetics and immunogenicity profiles of  SAIT101 
were similar to MabThera® and Rituxan®. 
Clinical Data of SAIT101  
The first clinical study with SAIT101 began in May 2011. S101 -NKR -[ADDRESS_181132]-in-human Phase I study conducted in 14 centers in Korea aimed to compare and assess 
PK and PD profiles, and preliminary efficacy and safety of SAIT101 compared to 
MabThera®, after intravenous (i.v.)  infusion of MabThera® or SAIT101. As of 
26 September 2011, a total of 24 diffuse large B  cell ly mphoma patient s had been 
randomized  to receive either SAIT101 ( proposed rituximab biosimilar) or MabThera® 
(rituximab, [COMPANY_002]) in combination with the chemotherapy regimen, CHOP 
(cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, v incristine, and prednisone ). 
Kim et al reporte d that t he ratio of geometric least square (GLS) mean (90% confidence 
interval, CI) of SAIT101 versus MabThera® were 0.92 (0.78  to 1.09) for AUC last and 0.93 
(0.78  to 1.13) for C max. The LS means change from baseline of B -cell (%) in SATI101 and 
MabThera® group were -7.7% and -8.0% respectively and the difference between two 
groups was 0.3% (90%CI, -0.9 to 1.4). The safety and efficacy profile of SAIT101 were 
not significantly differ ent from  MabThera®.9

27APR2017  23 Confidential  1.3 Comparator drug: Rituximab  
Rituximab is a genetically engineered recombinant chimeric human/murine antibody 
directed against the CD20 antigen. Following binding of CD20, rituximab triggers a 
cytotoxic immune response against CD20 -positive cells.  
Rituximab was initially developed by [CONTACT_41231].  Based on its safety and 
effectiveness in clinical studies , rituximab  was approved under the trade name [CONTACT_156396]® 
by [CONTACT_3133]  (FDA ) in 1997 to treat B  cell non -Hodgkin’s  
lymphomas  (NHL)  resistant to other chemotherapy regimens.  Rituximab, in combination 
with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristi ne and prednisone  (CHOP ) chemotherapy, 
is now a standard therapy in the initi al treatment of diffuse large B cell lymphoma and 
many other B cell lymphomas.  It has been approved as a therapeutic agent for patient s with 
NHL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and  RA.10, 11 
Rituxan® was co -developed and marketed in the US (under the brand name [CONTACT_156396]®) by 
[CONTACT_156333] (now a part of [COMPANY_002]). It is marketed outside the US by [CONTACT_156334]®. 
Antigen CD20 is a hydrophobic transmembrane protein with a m olecular weight of 
approximately 35 kDa located on pre -B and mature B lymphocytes.  The antigen is 
expressed on more than 90% of B cell NHL, but is not found on hematopoietic  system 
cells, pro -B cells, normal plasma cells , or other normal tissues. CD20 regu lates early step s 
in the activation process for cell cycle initiation and differentiation, and possibly functions 
as a calcium ion channel. CD20 is not shed from the cell surface and does not internalize  
upon antibody binding.  Free CD20 antigen is not found in the circulation.  
B cells are believed to play a role in the pathog enesis of RA and associated chronic 
synovitis.  In this setting, B cells may be acting at multiple sites in the 
autoimmune/inflammatory process, including through production of RF an d other 
autoanti bodies, antigen presentation, T -cell activation and/or pro -inflammatory  cytokine 
production.  
The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes, and the Fc  
domain recruits immune effector functions to mediate B cell lysis.  Possible mechanisms of  
cell lysis include complement -dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody -dependent  cell-
mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).

27APR2017  24 Confidential  1.3.1  Clinical Pharmacokinetics of Rituximab  
In one of the Phase IIa double bl ind studies  conducted in RA patient s to evaluate the PK 
of rituximab, it was found that the mean areas under the plasma concentration –time curves 
for rituximab were si milar across treatment groups (rituximab alone, r ituximab in 
combina tion with cyclophosphamide and r ituximab in combination with methotrexate  
[MTX] ). The mean terminal half -life (t1/2) of 19 to 22 days was observed in r ituximab after 
the second infusion. Systemic clearance of rituximab was slow at 242, 226, and 221  mL/d 
in all 3 tre atment groups . The volume of distribution  (VD) of rituximab at steady state was 
low at 4.28 to 4.74 L and similar to normal plasma volume in all treatment group s. These 
data indicate that the PK characteristics of rituximab are not discernibly altered when  it is 
administered in combination with either cyclophosphamide or MTX . This observation is 
supportive of the contention that rituximab does not require dose adjustment s when 
administered  with either cyclo phosphamide or MTX .12 
1.3.2  Clinical Data of Rituximab  
In one  of the recent (2006) RA studies  conducted in 520 patient s to determine  the efficacy 
and safety of rituximab alo ng with MTX  in patients with active RA who had an inadequate 
response to anti -tumor necrosis factor (anti -TNF) therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , it was found that patient s who 
received two 1,000 mg infusions of rituximab the Disease Activity Score (DAS)  improved 
-1.9 when compared with MTX alone ( -0.4%; p <0.0001 ) and met the American College 
of Rheumatology  (ACR)  20% improvement criteria ( achieved an ACR20 response) at 
Week 24, 51% when  compared with placebo  (18%; p <0.0001) .13, 14 
In another long-term safety study (2010) , it was observed that rituximab was well tolerated  
over time and multiple courses. Overall, the findings indicate d that there was no evidence 
of an increased safety risk or increased reporting rates of any types of AEs with prolonged 
exposure to rituximab .15

2.1 Study  Rationale  
SAIT101, as a proposed biosimilar of rituximab in pharmaceutical form, strength and 
administration route, is expected to play an importan t role in the treatment of RA. The 
substitution of rituximab by [CONTACT_156335]101 is expected to provide similar  efficacy, PK, PD, 
safety, tolerability, and immunogenici ty in patient s with  RA. The dose selected for this 
study is based on the clinically e ffective dose of rituximab.  
This study is to evaluate similarity in terms  of PK, PD, safety , efficacy, tolerability , and 
immunogenicity  between SAIT101 and rituximab and also to provide a benefit and risk 
profile of SAIT101.

3.1 Summary of Study Design  
This is a multi cente r, randomized , double -blind, parallel group study to compare the  PK, 
PD, safety , efficacy, tolerability , and immunogenicity of SAIT101 versus  MabThera® 
versus  Rituxan® in patient s with  RA. This study will take place globally across 
approximately [ADDRESS_181133] 3  months’ treatment 
(according to the approved treatment and dosage) or intolerance ( at Investigator's 
discretion and/or experience of severe adverse event [AE] or toxicity  such as infusion 
related reaction, hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis or severe toxicity ) to anti -TNF therapy . All 
the Screening assessments should be performed within 30 da ys prior to randomization  on 
Day 1 (Visit 2, Baseline) , except in patient s who require prophylaxis of latent tuberculosis 
or a washout of current anti -TNF medication or other biologic and non -biologic DMARD 
treatment except MTX. For these patient s the Screening period may be extended to allow 
for the washout required, but will not exceed [ADDRESS_181134] X -ray (see Section  3.2.5). 
In Part A , patient s will be randomized  in a 1:1:1 ratio  to receive one course of SAIT101 
(n=94) versus Rituxan® (n=94) versus MabThera® (n=94).  
At Week 24, patient s will be evaluated for a second course of the infusion.    
In Part B, e ligible patient s in the SAIT101 arm will receive the second course of  SAIT101 
treatment at Week s 24 and 26. Eligible patient s in the MabThera® arm will receive the 
second course of  MabThera® treatment at Week 24 and 26 . Eligible patient s in the Rituxan® 
arm will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive SAIT101  or Rituxan® treatment at Week s 
24 and 26 . Patient s will be followed up  for safety till Week  52. 
For each course of infusion, patient s will receive  two infusions of  1,000 mg (10 mg/mL) 
SAIT101 or Rituxan® or MabThera® for i.v. infusion  for the treatment.  
Patient s will continue to take their usual prescribed concomitant medications as allowed

3.[ADDRESS_181139] and Comparator , Dose and Mode of Administration  
SAIT101 is a sterile, clear to opalescent and colorless  or a pale yellow, preservative -free 
solution for i.v. infusion . The formulation of SAIT101 is  similar  to MabThera® or 
Rituxan®.  
Each patient  will be randomized  on Day  1 to receive one of three possible treatments ( study 
drug): 
• SAIT101:  1,000 mg (10 mg/mL) -Test product ; 
• Rituxan®: 1,000 mg (10 mg/mL) -Comparator ; 
• MabThera®: 1,000 mg (10 mg/mL) -Comparator . 
All patients received premedication with 100 mg i.v. methylprednisolone (or its 
equivalent), an antipyretic and an antihistaminic (e.g. acetaminophen and 
diphenhydramine) per the accepted infusion protocols for rituximab  prior to study drug 
infusions to de crease incidence rate and severity of acute infusion -related reactions . 
Protocol Number:  AGB 001    Version Amendment 04 , 27APR 2017 
27APR2017  32 Confidential  Since hypotension may occur during rituximab infusion, consideration should be given to 
withholding anti -hypertensive medications 12 hours prior to the infusion.  
The Day 1 infusion  rate (both week 0 and week 24 ) of SAIT101 or MabThera® or Rituxan® 
will start at 50 mg/hour; after the first 30 minutes, it can be escalated in 50 mg/hour 
increments every 30 minutes, to a maximum of 400 mg/ hour. If there has been no infusion 
related reaction on Day 1, t he Day 15 infusion  (both  first and second  course s) can be 
infused at 100 mg/hour and increased by 100 mg/hour increments at 30 minute intervals, 
to a maximum of 400  mg/hour.  
The recommended infusion rates are presented in Table 1.

In the event that a patient  experiences an infusion -related react ion or an adverse drug 
reaction (ADR ), the infusion rate should be reduced to half the rate (e.g., from 100  mg/hour 
to 50 mg/hour). Once the infusion -related reaction or ADR has resolved, the Investigator 
should wait an additional [ADDRESS_181140] rate on the patient ’s infusion 
schedule. Please refer to the following examples : 
(Example 1) An infusion -related react ion or an ADR  at a rate of 50 mg/h  → change rate 
to 25 mg/h  → reaction resolved → additional 30 minutes  at a rate of 25 mg/h → change 
back to 50 mg/h .

Any drugs that are used to manage hypersensitivity reaction s or ADRs, including  but not 
limited to epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], antihistamine , and corticosteroid, should be immediately available 
in case of emergency.  
Attention should be given to the development of anaphylaxis during infusion  of the study 
drug. When an anaphylactic reaction is suspected during infusion of the study drug:  
• Discontinue the study drug.  
• Apply a tourniquet close to the infusion site in order to slow systemic absorption of 
the study drug.  Do not block artery flow.  
• Perform appropriate airway ma nagement.  
• If required, administer antihistamine, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], or other drugs.  
• Closely monitor the patient  and document the observations.  
Patient s who experience a moderate to severe infusion -related reaction (fever, chills or 
hypotension), should have thei r infusion interrupted immediately and should receive 
aggressive symptomatic treatment, such as glucocorticoids, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], bronchodilators 
or oxygen, as per local practice. Depending on the severity of the infusion reaction and the 
required intervention s, patient s should either have their infusion temporarily interrupted or 
be discontinued from the study  treatment . The infusion should not be restarted before all 
the symptoms have disappeared, and then it should be restarted at half the rate. If the patie nt 
tolerates the reduced rate for [ADDRESS_181141] rate on the patient ’s infusion schedule. If the subject does not tolerate the reduced

immunodeficiency  syndrome  (AIDS)  
 
3.4.4  Patient  Withdrawal  
All patient s are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time, for any reason, 
specified or unspecified, and without prejudice to further treatment. If the withdrawn 
patients meet the PK data set, then those patients can be included in the PK analysis .  
Patient s will be withdrawn from the study in the following circumstances:  
• The patient  withdraw s consent to contribute additional outcome information or is lost 
to follow -up despi[INVESTIGATOR_156306]  5.10. Investigators are 
encouraged to discuss the patient ’s case with the Sponsor p hysician or rep resentative to 
agree upon appropriate action.  
3.5 Measures to Minimize /Avoid Bias  
The treatment groups will be blinded to minimize  any bias that could be introduced  by 
[CONTACT_156340] I nvestigator or patient , which is especially important 
given that many of the efficacy and safety measures are subjective. Potential bias will be 
further minimized  by [CONTACT_156341], blinded, jo int assessor at each 
study center  who will be independent of the rest of the study team. This person will perform 
the swollen and tender joint counts without access to any other study -related outcomes. 
The parallel group design takes into account the progressive nature of RA.

27APR2017  43 Confidential  The interactive voice / web response system ( IXRS) will be used to manage randomization  
to treatment groups in a blinded manner. This includes maintaining the blind for those 
patient s who are eligible to receive a furt her course of study drug . 
To ensure blinding of the treatments, the SAIT101, Rituxan® and MabThera® should only 
be managed by  [CONTACT_156342].  
The SAIT101 , Rituxan® and MabThera® solutions will be provided in a blinded manner to 
the blinded Investigator’s  team.  Patient s will receive the i.v. drug infusions in the same 
manner regardless of the treatment group they are randomized  to. All details will be 
provided in the Pharmacy Manual.  
3.5.2  Randomizatio n 
Patient s will be assigned a unique patient  number at Screening. The patient  number will be 
used to re gister the patient  using the IXRS and the patient  will then be randomized  (in a 
1:1:1 ratio) to either  SAIT101, Rituxan® or MabThera®.  
Eligible patient s in the SAIT101 arm will receive the second course of  SAIT101 treatment 
at Week s 24 and 26. Eligible patient s in the MabThera® arm will receive the second course 
of MabThera® treatment at Week s 24 and 26 . Eligible patient s in the Rituxan® arm will be 
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive SAIT101  or Rituxan® treatment at Week s [ADDRESS_181164] be notified immediately if a patient  and/or

treatment code must be documented in the patient ’s source documents and IXRS . This 
includes who performed the unblinding, the patient (s) affected, the reason for the 
unblinding,  the date of the unblinding and the relevant study drug  information.  The 
Investigator should ensure that the appropriate measurements are taken at the study center  
to maintain the blinding of the study.  
3.5.4  Unblinding for Interim Analysis  
An interim analysis o f 10 patients per arm ( 30 patients in total) of safety data collected up  
to Week 4 and 20 patients per arm (60 patients in total) of safety data collected up  to 
Week 12 are planned. Safety data will be handled by [CONTACT_156343] (see Section 6.9).  The study wi ll be unblinded at W eek [ADDRESS_181165] Week 24 fol low-up

5.1 Adverse Event  (AE) 
An AE is defined as “any untoward medical occurrence in a patient  or clinical investigation 
patient  administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have 
a causal relationship with this treatment. ” 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable  and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or d isease temporally associated with the use 
of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
5.2 Serious Adverse Events  (SAE)  
A SAE  is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
• results in death;  
• is life-threatening.  The term “life -threatening event” refers to an event in which the

An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is defined as a noxious and unintended response to a 
medicinal product related to any dose.  
AEs which meet all of the following criteria:  
• Serious  
• Unexpected (i.e. is not consistent with the cu rrently applicable Investigator Brochure 
list of AEs)  
• There is at least a reasonable possibility that there is a causal relationship between 
the event and the medicinal product  
will be classified as Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) and 
should be reported to the relevant ethics committee and to the relevant Health Authorities 
for expedited reporting in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC or as per national 
regulatory requirements in participating countries.  
5.[ADDRESS_181190]  (AESI)  
An AE of special interest (AESI) is one of scientific and medical interest specific to 
understanding of the study drug and may require close monitoring and rapid 
communication by [CONTACT_737] t o the Sponsor and/or Quintiles IMS. An AESI may be 
serious or non -serious.  The rapid reporting of AESIs allows ongoing surveillance of these 
events in order to characterize and understand them in association wi th the use of this study 
drug. All AESIs must be reported in an expedited manner s imilar to SAEs (i .e., non -serious 
AESIs also must follow serious timelines).  
The following will be considered AESIs in this study:  PML , hepatitis reactivation, 
mucocutaneous reactions, infusion reactions, anaphylactic reactions, and serious infections.  
5.4.1  Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy  
The Investigator is required to monitor the patients throughout the study for any new or 
worsening neurological symptoms or signs that may be suggestive of PML. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_156316], and include cognitive or  visual disorders, hemiparesis, confus ion, 
and behavioral disorders. If a patient develops new or worsening neurological signs or 
symptoms, he/ she will be evaluated for PML. Neurological warning signs include:  
• Major changes in vision, unusual eye movements.  
• Loss of balance or coordination.  
Protocol Number:  AGB 001   Version Amendment 04 , 27APR 2017 
27APR2017  76 Confidential  • Disorientation or confusion.  
If PML is suspected, further dosing must be suspended until PML has been excluded.  
Consultation with a neurologist should be consi dered as clinically indicated. If any doubt 
exists, f urther evaluation, including an MRI scan (preferably with contrast), cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_156317] (DNA), and repeat 
neurological assessments, should be considered.  
The Sponsor must be notified of any suspected PML cases within [ADDRESS_181191] infusion with time to onset of 30  to 120 minutes. Rituximab -
induced infusion reactions and sequelae include urticaria, hypotension, angioedema, 
hypoxia, bronchospasm, pulmonary infiltrates, acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], 
Protocol Number:  AGB 001   Version Amendment 04 , 27APR 2017 
27APR2017  77 Confidential  myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, cardiogenic shock, an aphylactoid events, or 
death.  
Medical management (e.g. , glucocorticoids, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], bronchodilators, or oxygen) for 
infusion reactions must be instituted as needed. Depending on the severity of the infusion 
reaction and the required interventions, rituxi mab may be temporarily or permanently 
discontinue d. Resume infusion at a minimum 50% reduction in rate after symptoms have 
resolved. Closely monitor patient s with pre -existing cardiac or pulmonary conditions . 
Infusion reactions should be reported in the eC RF as AEs, or SAEs if it meets the 
seriousness criteria, with the event ter m “infusion -related reaction”. The signs and 
symptoms of the infusion reaction should be described in the  appropriate part of the eCRF. 
Please refer also to Section 5.4.6 (Anaphyla xis). 
5.4.6  Anaphylaxis  
Anaphylaxis is a serious  allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death . 
Diagnostic criteria are outlined in Table  7.  
Table  7 Clinical Criteria for Diagnosing Anaphylaxis  
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following 3 criteria are fulfilled:  
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both 
(e.g., generalized hives, pruritus or  flushing, swollen lips /tongue /uvula)  
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING  
a. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (e .g., dyspnea, wheeze/ bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_17175] ( PEF), hypoxemia)  
b. Reduced blood pressure  or associated symptoms of end -organ dysfunction (e .g., hypotonia 
[collapse], syncope, incontinence)  
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_17176] a likely allergen for that patient  
(minutes to several hours):  
a. Involvement of the skin /mucosal tissue (e .g., generalized hives, itch /flush, swollen 
lips/tongue /uvula)  
b. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze /bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia)  
c. Reduced blood pressure  or associated symptoms (e .g., hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence)  
d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e .g., crampy abdominal pain, vomiting)  
3. Reduced blood pressure  after exposure to known allergen for that patient  (minutes  to several hours):  
a. Infants and children: low systolic blood pressure  (age specific) or greater t han 30% decrease in 
systolic blood pressure  
b. Adults: systolic blood pressure  of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that 
person’s baseline  
 
As with the treatment of any critically ill patient , the treatment of anaphylaxis begins with 
a rapid assessment  and maintenance of airway, breathing, and circulation.  When a patient  
fulfills any of the 3 criteria of anaphylaxis  outlined above, the patient  should receive 
Protocol Number:  AGB 001   Version Amendment 04 , 27APR 2017 
27APR2017  78 Confidential  epi[INVESTIGATOR_156318]. 
There undoubtedly will be  patient s who present with symptoms not yet fulfilling  the criteria 
of anaphylaxis yet in whom it would be  appropriate to initiate therapy with epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], 
such as a  patient  with a history of near -fatal anaphylaxis to peanut  who ingested peanut 
and within minutes is experiencing  urticaria and generalized flushing. Subsequent 
interventions  are determined on the basis of the clinical course and  response to epi[INVESTIGATOR_238].  
Anaphylaxis  should be reported in the eCRF as AE or SAE if it meets the seriousness 
criteria, with th e event term “ anaphylaxis ”. The signs and symptoms of the anaphylaxis  
should be described in the appropriate part of the eCRF.  
5.[ADDRESS_181192] infusion of study drug . Pregnancy 
reports should be submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours of awareness of the 
pregnancy by [CONTACT_156361].  
Pregnancy occurring in the partner of a male patient participating in the study should be 
reported to the Investigator and the Sponsor following the same procedure for p regnancy 
in the female patient. The partner should be counseled, the risks of continuing the 
pregnancy discussed, as well as the possible effects on the fetus. Monitoring of the 
pregnant female should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy. The pregnan t partner 
will need to sign an Authorization for “Use and Disclosure of Pregnancy Health 
Information” (a sort of specific consent form) to allow for follow -up of her pregnancy.  
Although pregnancy is not an AE, all pregnancies must be followed until 6 to 8 weeks 
after the estimated date of delivery to determine their outcome. The pregnancy outcome 
will be notified to the Sponsor by [CONTACT_17258] a follow -up pregnancy report form. If the 
outcome of the pregnancy meets the SAE criteria then the Investigator shoul d report this 
case according to the SAE reporting process (Section 5. 9). 
5.6 Overdose  
An overdose of SAIT101 or MabThera® or Rituxan® is defined as an infusion of >1,[ADDRESS_181193] of care at the site or symptomatically and the case discussed with the Clinical 
Research Organization and Sponsor medical advisor for decision on treatment 
discontinuation of the patient.  
Protocol Number:  AGB 001   Version Amendment 04 , 27APR 2017 
27APR2017  79 Confidential  When an overdose is  reported during the course of the study, the patient should be 
monitored closely and evaluated by [CONTACT_156362] a result of the overdose.  
Overdoses will be reported as protocol deviations. I f the overdose is associated with an 
AE/SAE, the site should follow the AE/SAE reporting procedures described in Section [ADDRESS_181194] result, the 
Investigator or Sub -investigator needs to ascertain if this is an abnormal (i.e., clinically 
significant) change from Baseline for that individual patient. This determination, 
however, does not necessarily need to be made the first time an abnormal value is 
observed. The Investigator or Sub -investigator may repeat the laboratory test or conduct 
addit ional tests to verify the results of the original clinical laboratory tests. If this 
laboratory value is determined by [CONTACT_91564] -investigator to be a clinically 
significant change from Baseline for that patient, it is considered to be an AE.  
5.8 Recording of Adverse Events  
Relationship  
The causal relationship of the study drug  to all AEs occurring after the start of study drug  
infusion  will be assessed as one of the following two categories.  
1. Unrelated (AE f or which relationship to the study drug can be ruled out) . A reasonable 
possibility of the AE occurring is considered highly unlikely f or one of the following 
reasons:  
• Occurrence of the event can be expected based on the patient ’s underlying disease, 
concurrent illness, or medical history.  
• Occurrence of the event can be expected based on the patient ’s age, gender , or other 
characteristics.  
• There is no apparent temporal relationship between study drug  infusion  and 
occurrence of the event.  Example: Occurrence of an AE after a considerable leng th 
of time has elapsed since comp letion or discontinuation of study drug  infusion . 
Protocol Number:  AGB 001   Version Amendment 04 , 27APR 2017 
27APR2017  80 Confidential  • A causal relationship is considered highly unlikely from the status of study drug  
infusion  and the course of the event.  Example: An AE that recovers without  
treatment while continuing study drug infusion  (excluding cases in which the 
patient  becomes accustomed to the  condition through continued study drug  
infusion ). 
• The event is considered to be the effect of a concomitant drug.  
• The event is considered to be  incidental (accident, incidental symptom, etc).  
Example: Occurrence of a femoral fracture resulting from a traffic accident . 
• A causal relationship of study drug  infusion  can be medically ruled out for some 
other reason.  
2. Related (AE for which relationship to the study drug  cannot be ruled out) . A reasonable 
possibility of the AE occurring is considered likely f or one of the following reasons:  
• Occurrence of the event can be expected from the pharmacological or  toxicological 
action of the study drug . Examples : Occurrence of pancytopenia when an effect on 
the hematopoietic system has been observed in non -clinical studies, or occur rence 
of dehydration with a  study drug  that has a diuretic action.   
• The same event was previously observed in non -clinical studies or clinical studies. 
Example: Occurrence of an event that was observe d at a high incidence in P hase I  
studies.  
• A temporal relationship between study drug  infusion  and occurrence of the event is  
suspected.  Example: Occurrence of allergic dermatitis se veral days after the start of 
study drug  infusion . 
• A causal relationship is suspected from the outcome of the event following 
discontinuat ion or dose reduction of the study drug . Example: Rapid recov ery of 
nausea following discontinuation o f study drug infusion . 
• A causal relationship of study drug  infusion  cannot be medically ruled out for some 
other reason.  
Severity  
Protocol Number:  AGB 001   Version Amendment 04 , 27APR 2017 
27APR2017  81 Confidential  AEs will be graded on a 3 -point scale. The intensity of an adverse experience is defi ned as 
follows.  
1 = Mild: Discomfort noticed, but no disruption to daily activity.  
2 = Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity.  
3 = Severe: Inability to work or perform normal daily activity.  
 
5.9 Eliciting and Reporting Adverse Events  
After the patient has signed the ICF, but prior to initiation of study drug, only SAEs caused 
by a protocol -mandated procedure should be reported (e.g., SAEs related to invasive 
procedures such as biopsies).  The I nvestigator or Sub-investigator  will periodically assess 
patient s for the occurrence of AEs and record AE information offe red spontaneously by 
[CONTACT_4676] s. To avoid bias in eliciting AEs, patient s should be asked the following non -leading 
question:  "How have you felt since yo ur last visit?"   
The Quintiles IMS must be notified of any SAEs within [ADDRESS_181195] any further improvement 
or worsening of the AE.  
5.11 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to Regulatory Au thorities 
and Investigators  
Investigators will be notified by [CONTACT_156363].  Investigators should provide written 
documentation of IRB/IEC notification for each report to the Spo nsor or Quintiles IMS.  
The Sponsor or Quintiles IMS will ensure that SAEs are reported to the appropriate 
regulatory authorities in accordance with the local regulations.

power to reject both the null hypothesis that the ratio of test to standard geometrics means 
is below 0.800, and the null hypothesis that the ratio of test to standa rd geometrics means 
is above 1.250 (i.e., that the test and standard are not equivalent), in favor of the 
alternative hypothesis, that the means of the two groups are equivalent, assuming that the 
expected ratio of means is 1.000, that data will be analyze d in the log scale using analysis 
of variance (ANOVA) and that each one sided test is made at the 5% level. Each of the 
15 hypotheses tests (five co -primary endpoints × three pairwise compar isons (i.e., 
SAIT101 vs. MabThera®, SAIT101 vs. Rituxan®, MabThera® vs. Rituxan®)) are powered 
at 98% to 99.0% to yield 81% study -wide power.  
Approximately 282 patients (94 patients per group) will be randomized in order to yield a 
minimum of 84 patients per group to account for a presumed 10% withdrawal.  
This 94  patients in SAIT101 group and MabThera® group will provide 96% probability of 
declaring the equivalence in FAS  with each one sided test at the 2.5% level , accounting for 
a presumed 1.[ADDRESS_181197] deviation of DAS28 from the REFLEX study13, 14, and the 
equiv alence margin of -0.6 to 0.6 chosen as the half of a clinical meaningful improvement 
of 1.2 in DAS28 .16 Considering 18% withdraw from the REFLEX study, approximately 77

27APR2017  90 Confidential  6.12 Proc edure for Reporting Deviations  
A protocol deviation is any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or  
procedure that is under the I nvestigator’s responsibility and oversight (as defined by  
[CONTACT_19124]) without prior written IRB/IEC approval or favorable  opi[INVESTIGATOR_156320], and that does not  have a major impact on the patient ’s rights, safety, or  well-
being, or on the integrity and authenticity of the study data.  
All deviations from the approved protocol must be documented and notified to the Sponsor 
or CRO  at the earliest. The Investigator s hould not deviate from the protocol, except for 
patient  safety reasons, in which case the deviation mus t be reported to the Sponsor or CRO  
immediately. The Sponsor will not assume any resulting responsibility or liability from  
unapproved deviations. The In vestigator, according to applicable regulations and the IEC 
established procedures, will inform the IEC of protocol deviations.  
All instances where the requirements of the study protocol are not complied with will be 
captured in the clinical trial manageme nt system (CTMS)  and the study monitor will 
prepare a Protocol Deviation/Violation Log.  Corresponding patient s may be discontinued  
from the study  treatment  at the discretion of the  Sponsor/designee. Deviations from the 
study protocol should not be made oth er than as part  of a protocol amendment. An 
amendment must be agreed upon by [CONTACT_1034], but not  implemented until written 
IRB/IEC approval is obtained, except where necessary to eliminate  an immediate hazard 
to study patient s or when the change(s) involves only logistical or  administrative aspects. 
Protocol deviations/violations and the reason why they occurred will  be documented in the 
clinical study report ( CSR ).

SAIT101, Rituxan® and MabThera® will be provided in sterile, preservative -free, 
non-pyrogenic, single -use vials containing 500 mg of rituximab per 50 mL. Two vials will 
be used per infusion (1 ,000 mg per 100  mL) with each carton of study drug  containing two 
50 mL vials of either SAIT101 , Rituxan® or MabThera®.  
The SAIT101, Rituxan® and MabThera® vials will be different in size. Therefore, site staff 
managing medication preparation will be unblinded.  
7.2 Packaging and Labeling  
Each carton and medication vial will be labelled with all the required information according 
to local regulations, including the Protocol Number ( AGB001 ) and a unique identifier 
(Med ID)  in a blinded manner. This will be programmed into the IXRS. At each  infusion  
visit, the IXRS will assign the correct vial for the allocated treatment group and visit  and 
the Med ID will be linked to an individual patient . The Med ID is assigned by [CONTACT_4150].  
Any used and unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with 
local requirements, when certificates of destruction are available, or in c ase not possible, 
centrally as per Sponsor guidance.  
7.3 Storage  
Study drugs  will be stored in a secure  area according to local regulations.  Access should 
be strictly limited to unblinded s tudy personnel (e.g ., pharmacist) . It is the responsibility 
of the Investigator , Sub-investigator , or authorized  person to ensure that study drugs  are 
only administered to study  patient s.  
All study drug s must be kept in a secure place under a ppropriate storage conditions. The 
medication vi als must be stored in a refrigerator at a controlled temperature (2 to 8°C) and 
handled acco rding to GCP . Vials should be kept in the outer carton i n order to protect it

Arthritis of hand joints  At least 1 area swollen (as defined above) in a wrist, MCP, or PIP joint.  
Symmetric arthritis  Simultaneous involvement of the same joint areas (as defined in 2) on both 
sides of the body (bilateral involvement of PI[INVESTIGATOR_18246], MCPs, or MTPs is 
acceptable without absolute symmetry).  
Rheumatoid nodules  Subcutaneous nodules, over bony prominences, or extensor surfaces, or in

patients.  
Radiographic changes  Radiographic changes typi[INVESTIGATOR_156324], which must include erosions or unequivocal 
bony decalcification localized in or most marked adjacent to the involved 
joints (osteoarthritis changes alone do not qualify).  
*For classification purposes, a patient shall be said to have rheumatoid arthritis if he/she has satisfied at 
least [ADDRESS_181221] 6  weeks. Patients with

27APR2017  113 Confidential    Appendix 5 DAS28 and EULAR Response Criteria   
DAS28  is a formula combining:  
• Tender Joint Count (28 joints)  
• Swollen Joint Count (28 joints)  
• ESR (mm/ hour)  or CRP (mg/L)  
• General Health - Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity (VAS)  
DAS28 -CRP = [0.56 x √(TJC28) + 0.28*√(SJC28) + 0.36* log nat(CRP+1)] x 1.10 + 1.15  
A calculator is available online at the following website:

A representation and example is given below:
Protocol Number:  AGB  001  Version Amendment 04 , 27APR 2017 
27APR2017  114 Confidential    Based on the DAS28 score, disease activity is classified as : 
≤ 2.6 Remission  
>2.6 ≤ 3.2 Low disease activity  
>3.2 ≤ 5.1 Moderate disease activity  
>5.1 High disease activity  
 
EULAR response Criteria:  
Based on the DAS, response criteria have been developed, the EULAR response criteria. 
The EULAR response criteria include not only change in disease activity but also current 
disease activity.  To be cl assified as responders, patie nts should have a significant change 
in DAS (at least >0.6 from Baseline ) and also low current disease activity. Three categories 
are defined: good, moderate, and non -responders.

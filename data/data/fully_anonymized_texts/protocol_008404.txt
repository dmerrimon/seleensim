2.1 Objectives & 
Hypotheses 1.0 Amendment 1 – Dated May 14, 2020
1. Imipenem-relebactam changed to imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam 
throughout the protocol to document inclusion of cilastatin.  This maintains 
consistency with the package insert for the drug and also clarifies the 
dosage.
2. The dosage has been changed to 1.25 grams throughout the protocol.  This 
total dose is consistent with the package insert and contains 500mg of 
imipenem, 500mg of cilastatin, and 250mg of relebactam.  Note, the total 
amount of imipenem and relebactam administered to the patient is not 
different from the original protocol.
3. Section 2.1: correct misspelling
4. Section 2.2: Background updated to indicate approval of imipenem-
cilastatin-relebactam for complicated urinary tract and intra-abdominal 
infections.
5. Section 2.5 modified to indicate collection of blood in K2EDTA lavender 
tubes instead of sodium heparin tubes.  The assay to be used requires 
K2EDTA tubes for collection.  As a result, the maximum blood volume per 
sample has been reduced from 7 mL to 4 mL, since the latter is the 
maximum volume of a lavender top tube.  Additional details provided on 
processing of plasma with MES stabilizer.
6. Section 2.5 modified to add free drug assessments of imipenem and 
relebactam.
7. Section 2.7 modified to provide details of analytical service by Q2 Solutions, 
Ithaca NY.
8. Section 2.7 modified to incorporate fraction unbound estimates into Monte 
Carlo simulations.
1.1 Amendment 2 – Dated July 31, 2020
1. Section 2.5 modified to indicate collection of additional pre-dose blood 
sample within 30 minutes of infusion start time.
1.2 Amendment 3 – Dated December 22, 2020
1. Section 2.5 inclusion criteria #3 modified to lower creatinine clearance 
(CrCL) from 150 mL/min to 130 mL/min. This has been changed throughout 
protocol accordingly. This will increase the target population while still 
limiting patients to those with augmented renal clearance.
2. Section 2.5 inclusion criteria #4 modified to include only antibiotic use as a 
method for determining whether or not a patient has a documented or 
presumed infection, and removing other criteria related to infection 
(temperature, elevated WBC). 
3. Section 2.5 inclusion criteria #10 modified to reduce minimum APACHE II 
score from >12 to ≥10.  The threshold of 12 was arbitrary, while the intent is 
to include relatively sick patients in the study, which will still be the case.
4. Section 2.5 exclusion criteria #9 modified to remove valproic acid.
5. Section 2.5 addition of criteria #10 excluding patients currently receiving or 
anticipated to receive valproic acid. The change in criteria 9 and 10 will allow 
for patients to receive imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a prior recent 
history of valproic acid use.

1. Determine the single-dose pharmacokinetics of intravenous imipenem (when 
administered as imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam 1.25 grams as a 30 minute 
infusion) in adult critically ill patients with known or suspected sepsis and 
ARC 
2. Determine the single-dose pharmacokinetics of intravenous relebactam 
(when administered as imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam 1.25 grams as a 30 
minute infusion) in adult critically ill patients with known or suspected sepsis 
and ARC
3. Determine a dose of imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam that achieves greater 
than 90% probability of pharmacodynamic target attainment using the 
imipenem P. aeruginosa susceptibility breakpoint of 2 µg/mL and the MIC 
distribution of a contemporary P. aeruginosa and KPC producing K. 
pneumoniae population
4. Assess the safety and tolerability of single-dose imipenem-cilastatin-
relebactam in adult critically ill patients with known or suspected sepsis and 
ARC
2.1.1 Null Hypotheses
The pharmacokinetics of imipenem and relebactam will not be affected by [CONTACT_881689].
2.2 Background & 
Rationale, 
Significance of 
Selected Topic & 
Preliminary Data The continuous rise of bacterial resistance to antibiotics is among the most 
challenging concerns in contemporary clinical medicine. Imipenem-relebactam 
([COMPANY_006]&Co, Inc., Kenilworth, NJ) is an investigational broad-spectrum antibiotic that 
combines the known carbapenem, imipenem, with the novel beta-lactamase 
inhibitor, relebactam (1).  The addition of relebactam provides imipenem protection 
against serine based carbapenemases, including the Klebsiella pneumoniae 
carbapenemase (KPC), as well as improved activity against imipenem non-
susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2).  Imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam is 
approved in the [LOCATION_002] for complicated urinary tract infections and 
complicated intra-abdominal infections; it is under investigation for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-acquired 
and ventilator-associated pneumonia, and specifically for multidrug resistant Gram-
negative infections when it retains activity (1).  
Given its potent activity against KPC producing Enterobacteriaceae and 
imipenem non-susceptible P. aeruginosa, it is reasonable to consider that imipenem-
cilastatin-relebactam will be used in patients who are critically ill in the intensive care 
unit (ICU).  Critically ill patients may have varied kidney dysfunction as a result of 
acute infection.  Most clinicians are familiar with acute and chronic kidney 
impairment, which results in decreased elimination of drugs that are cleared by 
[CONTACT_575225].  Both imipenem and relebactam are predominantly excreted via 
the kidneys (3); therefore, dosage adjustments will be required based on calculated 
creatinine clearance.  Sepsis in ICU patients, however, may also produce a 
syndrome called Augmented Renal Clearance (ARC), whereby [CONTACT_881690] (4).  This 
enhanced clearance is typi[INVESTIGATOR_881686] 8 hour urine creatinine clearance ≥ 
130 ml/min/1.73 m2 and has been observed in as many as 65% of ICU patients on at 
least one day during their ICU admission (4,5).  ARC has been directly linked to sub-
therapeutic concentrations of β-lactam antibiotics, including imipenem (6,7,8,9).   
Furthermore, simulation of another carbapenem, meropenem, based on 
pharmacokinetics observed in patients with ARC resulted in regrowth of a 
susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa in hollow-fiber experiments (10).  
HHC-IRB
IRB NUMBER: HHC-2019-0237
IRB APPROVAL DATE: 12/22/2020
      MISP Template: Protocol 4 Final Version: 8/13/2010To our knowledge, the pharmacokinetics of relebactam, with or without 
imipenem, have not been studied in critically ill patients with ARC.  If ARC affects 
relebactam clearance to a similar degree as imipenem and other renally eliminated 
β-lactams, larger doses or prolonged infusion may be required to maintain optimized 
pharmacodynamic exposure.  Importantly, the effect of ARC on beta-lactam 
exposure is highly dependent on the MIC of the causative organism.  Therefore, it is 
also possible that the lower MICs observed with imipenem when combined with 
relebactam may mean that ARC has little effect on achievable time above the MIC 
exposure.
2.3 Study DesignThis will be a single center, observational, pharmacokinetic study. Eligible 
patients will be evaluated for inclusion/exclusion criteria.  Following consent by [CONTACT_4677], legal authorized representative (LAR), or next of kin, participants will receive 
a single dose of imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam 1.25 grams administered as a 30 
minute infusion.  Blood samples will be collected over the following 6 hours 
(consistent with proposed dosing interval) for characterization of imipenem and 
relebactam concentrations.  Pharmacokinetic analyses will be conducted to describe 
parameter estimates in patients with ARC.  We aim to enroll up to 12 patients so that 
complete data for 8 patients with ARC can be collected.

increase likelihood that enrolled participants have a urine CrCL ≥ 130 
ml/min/1.73 m2 and thus qualify as ARC);
4. Documented infection or presumed infection by [CONTACT_881691].
Exclusion Criteria
Patients will be considered ineligible if they meet any of the following criteria:
1. If female, currently pregnant or breast feeding;
2. History of any moderate or severe hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to any 
β-lactam antibiotic (Note: mild rash or erythema to penicillin or cephalosporin 
antibiotics would not disqualify a patient if they have received a carbapenem 
without problem);

over IBW, use adjusted body weight (ABW, kg): IBW + 0.4*(TBW-
IBW)
c If TBW is less than IBW, use TBW in equation
Study Medication Administration
All participants will receive a single dose of imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam 
1.25 grams as a 30 minute (+/- 5 minutes) infusion.  Imipenem-cilastatin-
relebactam vials will be supplied by [CONTACT_4530].  The dose will be 
prepared according to manufacturer recommendations in precisely 100 ml of 
0.9% sodium chloride.  Imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam must be administered 
through a peripheral intravenous catheter, peripherally inserted central catheter 
(PI[INVESTIGATOR_6875]), central line, or port-a-catheter, whichever is determined to be most 
appropriate by [CONTACT_881692].  
Participants will also receive standard intravenous antibiotic therapy (excluding 
generic or branded intravenous imipenem) to treat their suspected infection, as 
determined by [CONTACT_399935].  No other intravenous medications will 
be co-administered with imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam.
Study Day 1 
•Within 8 hours of beginning study medication infusion, a pre-dose SCr will be 
collected to confirm calculated CrCL remains ≥130 mL/min and that no 
change in SCr was observed to be ≥ 0.3 mg/dL from the baseline SCr used 
qualifying for enrollment.
•An 8 hour (± 1 hour) urine creatinine collection will be initiated within 4 hours 
prior to study medication infusion.  The results of the measured urine CrCL 
will be used to confirm ARC in the patient over the time period that blood 
samples for imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam are collected.

•Blood samples will be immediately stored on ice and centrifuged within 30 
minutes of collection at 1000-1300 x g (rcf) for 10 minutes at 4°C to separate 
the plasma.
•Immediately after centrifugation of whole blood, use a 1.0 mL pi[INVESTIGATOR_881687] 1.0 mL of plasma to labeled, cryovials containing 1.0 mL of 
plasma stabilizer (2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES)).  Add a 
second 1.0 mL of plasma to a second cryovial to serve as a back-up sample.
•Cap the cryovials and mix the plasma with the preservative stabilizer by

minutes should elapse between the blood draw and freezing of plasma 
sample.
•An additional 8ml blood sample will be collected for imipenem and 
relebactam protein binding determination at 0.5 hours (end of infusion). 
Plasma will be separated by [CONTACT_399936]. 
Approximately 0.9 mL of plasma will be loaded in an ultrafiltration device 
(Centrifree®, [COMPANY_006] Millipore Ltd., Ireland) and centrifuged for 45 minutes at 
10º C at 2,000 x g to obtain an ultrafiltrate containing only free-drug 
concentrations. Protein binding will be conducted in triplicate.  The protein-
free ultrafiltrate volume will be measured, transferred to a cryovial and then, 
an equal volume of the stabilizer will be added (confirmation of processing 
instructions for protein-free imipenem and relebactam will be provided by Q2 
Solutions, Ithaca, NY). The cryovials will be stored at -80º C until 
concentration determination. The final protein percentage will be calculated 
by [CONTACT_881694] 100 (%).

Data Collection
Patient demographics, medical/surgical history, concomitant medications, 
and adverse event data will be collected throughout the study on a provided 
case report form.  Protected Health Information (PHI) will be maintained at 
CAIRD.  
Analysis Populations
All patients enrolled will be included in the safety population.  However, only 
the [ADDRESS_1232659] imipenem and relebactam concentrations 
determined for informational purposes.  These patients will not be included in the 
summary pharmacokinetic analyses.  
Analytical
Cryovials containing plasma and protein free filtrate will be overnight shipped 
on dry ice to Q2 Solutions (Ithaca, NY) for imipenem and relebactam 
concentration determination.  The back-up vial will be shipped separately.  
Imipenem and relebactam concentrations will be determined by a liquid 
chromatography mass spectrometry assay.  
Pharmacokinetic Analyses
Non-compartmental
Non-compartmental modeling will be conducted using WinNonlin (Pharsight 
Corporation, Cary, NC) using the latest version licensed for the laboratory.  All 
concentration time curves will be plotted for visual inspection.  The following 
pharmacokinetic parameters will be estimated for imipenem and relebactam in 
each of the 8 participants.  The maximum concentration (C max) will be the highest 
concentration observed for the concentration time profile of each participant.  
The time to maximum concentration (T max) will be the observed sampling time of 
the C max.  The minimum concentration (C min) will be the lowest concentration 
observed for the concentration time profile of each participant that occurs after 
the observed C max.  Lambda ( z) will be the resulting slope of the regression line

the dosing interval (AUC 0-) will  be calculated by [CONTACT_1690]/log trapezoidal rule 
(linear during increasing concentrations, log during decreasing concentrations), 
where   is the dosing interval for the drug studied. The AUC to infinity (AUC INF) 
will be calculated as the AUC extrapolated to infinity by [CONTACT_8028]: AUC + 
Clast/z. Clearance (CL) will be estimated by [CONTACT_50726]/AUC 0-.  The volume of 
distribution based on the terminal elimination phase (V z) will be estimated by 
[CONTACT_50726]/( z*AUC 0-).  
Population Pharmacokinetic Analyses
Imipenem and relebactam concentrations will be modeled using the non-
parametric adaptive grid program (NPAG) with adaptive gamma in the Pmetrics 
package for R (Laboratory of Applied Pharmacokinetics and Bioinformatics, Los 
Angeles, CA) using either a one or two compartment model.  Appropriate model 
selection will be based on visual inspection, observed versus predicted plots, 
and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The effect of specific body size 
descriptors (actual body weight, ideal body weight, body mass index, body 
surface area) and both calculated and measured CrCL will be analyzed for 
correlation with pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., CL and volume of distribution).
Monte Carlo Simulation
Using the population pharmacokinetic model, a [ADDRESS_1232660] imipenem and relebactam dosing 
regimen to determine probability of achieving pharmacodynamic thresholds, as 
defined by [CONTACT_2728], at the imipenem susceptibility breakpoint of 2 µg/mL. 
Observed fraction unbound estimates from the protein-free ultrafiltrate studies in 
these patients will be incorporated into simulations.  In the scenario that the 
probability of target attainment (PTA) is less than 90%, a higher dose and longer 
infusion time (e.g., 2-3 hours) will be simulated to determine a dose that 
achieves at least 90% PTA.  Analyses will also be conducted using 
contemporary MIC distributions of P. aeruginosa and KPC producing K. 
pneumoniae.  
Power/Sample Size:
Based upon relebactam single dose pharmacokinetic data from healthy 
volunteers receiving the drug with or without imipenem (3), clearance across all 
doses was 8.6 L/h with a standard deviation of 1.2 L/h.  Eight in the ARC group 
would provide 80% power at an alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_1232661] a 40% difference in total 
body clearance from the historical healthy volunteer data; this also assumes an 
increase in coefficient of variability (CV) to 25%, which is expected in critically ill 
patients.  Since some patients with calculated CrCL via Cockcroft-Gault will not 
have [ADDRESS_1232662] 130 ml/min/1.[ADDRESS_1232663].

Experience 
ReportingParticipants will be monitored for any sign or symptom of adverse events 
throughout the course of the study. Unanticipated, life-threatening or fatal adverse 
events will be reported to the IRB, the manufacturer, and the Food and Drug 
Administration according to federal guidelines. All adverse events requiring medical 
attention will be treated by [CONTACT_399938].
For the purpose of this study, an adverse event will be defined as any pathologic 
or unintended change in the structure (signs), function (symptoms), or chemistry 
(laboratory values) of the body associated with the use of the study drug, whether or 
not considered drug related, and will be categorized as one of the following:  
MILD – present, but easily tolerated
MODERATE – discomfort that interferes with usual activities
SEVERE – incapacitating, inability to work or do usual activities
Relationship of the AE to the study medication (i.e., causality) will be evaluated 
according to the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], as one of the following:
Concurrent condition – unrelated to study drug
REMOTE adverse drug event – little or no temporal relationship to study 
drug
POSSIBLE adverse drug event – temporal relationship to study drug
PROBABLE adverse drug event – commonly associated with study drug
DEFINTE adverse drug event – reappeared on re-challenge of study drug
All SAEs will be reported to the Institutional Review Board, sponsor, and the Food 
and Drug Administration according to Federal and local guidelines. A serious 
adverse event will be defined as any adverse event that results in death, is 
immediately life-threatening, requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or is an important 
medical event that may jeopardize the participant or may require medical 
intervention to prevent one of the previously mentioned outcomes.

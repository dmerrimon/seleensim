10 Testing Sites  
The study will be conducted at three external collection and testing sites located in the U.S. (in 
different geographical locati ons).  
Testing sites may  be independent from sample collection sites – i.e., there can be multiple 
sample collection sites that feed into the three testing sites. If some non -U.S. testing/collection 
sites are chosen, the relevance of this patient populatio n to a U.S. population will be 
documented.

certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), 42 U.S.C. 
§263a, that meet requirements to perform high complexity or moderate complexity tests.  
Operators should be personnel currently employed in the selected intended use sites and 
testing should be integrated into the daily workflow of the facility.  
Education (including experience and training) and the occupation of each operator  will be 
recorded and tabulated for each operator enrolled in the study. Study sit es will be required to 
provide CVs and a filled in information form for potential operators prior to approval for their 
inclusion in the study. This wil l ensure that the  participants meet the definition of intended 
operators.  
The operators who participate in the study will be provided with the test kit in the form that 
will be made available in the actual intended use settings when the test is marketed. The 
operators should also be provided with the instructions  for use and the training that is intended 
for such operators.

Ideally, Category II samples should be limited to no more than 30% of the total prospective 
samples enrolled in the clinical study . 
Please note that Category I and II samples must be collected sequentially from all patients 
meeting study inclusion criteria and representing the assay’s intended use population (i.e., not 
pre-selected) presenting at a clinical facility between two pre -determined dates. This minimizes 
bias and prevalence of infection in the population can be evaluated. The Category II samples 
should be appropriately stored (e.g., frozen at -70˚C to -80˚C ). 
It is anticipated that within this clinical study both the compara tor and candidate samples will 
be tested under the Category I conditions.

The comparator RT -PCR a ssay, [COMPANY_002] cobas® SARS -CoV-2, uses two SARS -CoV-2 nucleocapsid 
targets. Target 1 is specific to the SARS -CoV-2 virus, but Target 2 is a pan -Sarbecovirus region 
of the nucleocapsid that is conserved and detects both SARS -CoV-1 and SARS -CoV-2. This 
comparat or RT -PCR assay considers samples which are positive for Target 1 as positive for 
SARS -CoV-2 virus regardless of the status of Target 2 which can be invalid, negative, or positive

and the sample is still SARS -CoV-2 positive if Target 1 is positive. If Targ et 2 is positive and 
Target 1 is either negative or invalid, then the result is a presumptive positive due to Target 2’s

presumptive positive results as invalid for this cli nical performance  study . Only the result of 
“SARS -CoV-2 RNA detected”, according to the manufacturer’s instructions for use, will be 
counted as  positive in the clinical performance evaluation data analysis.

Study data will be captured in the case report forms (CRFs) by [CONTACT_5984].  Paper forms will 
be filled in during the study and transcribed into electronic forms (smartsheet) whi ch will feed 
into a spreadsheet. The paper forms will  also be scanned and uploaded to the spreadsheet.  
Access  to the data collection system will be provided to members of the study site who have 
been delegated data collection and entry responsibilities by [CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_598212].  
The data recorded in the CRFs will be source -verified from study -related source documents. 
Quality Control checks will take place to verify that the smartsheet MDF matches the scans of 
the pape r source CRFs. The investigator shall ensure that all data on the CRFs are complete, 
accurate, and consistent with source documentation. A monitor from the Sponsor (or designee) 
will review the  CRFs for completeness and accuracy.  
The investigator will anon ymise patient data so that no identifiable information is kept. Data 
arising from the administration of the index and reference tests, e.g. graphs and other outputs 
will be collected. All data related to the evaluation will be stored; raw and unanalysed da ta files 
will be shared with QuantuMDx.  
15 Statistical Considerations  
The diagnostic performance of the Q -POC SARS -CoV-2 Assay  (in terms of PPA and NPA) will be 
determined using the [COMPANY_002] Cobas [ADDRESS_791091] -banding (Ct≤25, 25<Ct≤30, Ct>30) for SARS -CoV-2. Diagnostic 
performance will be assessed as follows:  
• Positiv e Percent Agreement (PPA) will be calculated as 100% × (TP/(TP + FN)).  
• Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) will be calculated as 100% × (TN/(TN + FP)).  
• PPA and NPA will include 95% CI.  
Where :  
• True Positive (TP) indicates that both the Q -POC  SARS-CoV-2 Assa y and comparator 
assay returned a positive result for the target.  
• False Negative (FN) indicates that the Q -POC  SARS -CoV-2 Assay returned a negative 
result for the target, while the comparator assay returned a positive result.  
• True Negative (TN) indicates t hat both the Q -POC SARS -CoV-2 Assay and comparator 
assay returned a negative result for the target.  
• False Positive (FP) indicates that the Q -POC SARS -CoV-2 Assay returned a positive r esult 
for the target, while the comparator assay returned a negative result.  
The performance of the Q -POC SARS -CoV-2 Assay will be presented based on the overall study 
(all specimens of a claimed specimen type combined) as well as stratified by [CONTACT_598216] .

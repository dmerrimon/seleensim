1.0 Background 
 
1.1 Colorectal Cancer  
 
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the second leading cause 
of cancer death in the U.S. In 2013, an estimated 142,820 cases of CRC will be diagnosed 
and 50,830 people will die from the disease (American Cancer Society, 2013). Fifteen to 
25% of patients with CRC have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, and a 
significant proportion of patients who are initially diagnosed with localized  disease 
ultimately develop metastases (Kindler and Shulman, 2001). While there have been 
substantive advances in the treatment of metastatic CRC (mCRC) over the past few years, 
median survival for these patients remains at two years, and less than 6% surv ive for 
more than five years (American Joint Committee on Cancer, 2010). Clearly, there is a critical need for new effective treatment regimens to further prolong  survival. 
 
1.2 5-Fluorouracil- Based  Chemotherapy 
 
Historically, treatment for CRC was limited to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin 
(LV), with response rates (RRs) of 23% and median survival time of approximately 10 to 
12 months (Advanced Colorectal Cancer Meta-Analysis Project, 1992). 5- FU is 
incorporated into RNA and DNA and inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase (TS), thus interfering with the formation of new strands of DNA during replication. LV is a reduced folate which, when combined with 5-FU, augments 5-FU cytotoxicity by 
[CONTACT_895226] 5 -FU active metabolite FdUMP.  Because 5 -FU has 
a short half -life, continuous infusion regimens appear to offer a pharmacological benefit, 
with the maximal dose intensity of 5 -FU delivery being achieved when the drug is 
administered over 24-48 hours. 
 
In the initial treatment of mCRC, 5- FU/LV is often administered with either irinotecan or 
oxaliplatin. Irinotecan is converted by [CONTACT_895227], SN-38, which binds and stabilizes topoisomerase I, leading to double -stranded DNA breaks and 
apoptosis. Randomized controlled trials have shown that irinotecan is active both in refractory mCRC as a single agent (Cunningham, et al, 1998) and in the first- line setting 
when combined with bolus 5-FU/LV (IFL) (Saltz, et al, 2000) or infusional 5- FU/LV 
(FOLFIRI) (Douillard, et al, 2000). Oxaliplatin is a platinum derivative that leads to the formation of DNA adducts, and has been evaluated in combination with both bolus (i.e., 
FLOX) and infusional forms of 5- FU/LV (FOLFOX), as well as capecitabine 
(CAPEOX). All of these studie s have found that combination chemotherapy is superior to 
5-FU/LV alone. Indeed, FOLFOX has been shown to be superior to IFL in the first- line 
setting (Goldberg, et al, 2004), but equivalent to FOLFIRI (Tournigand, et al, 2004). 
 
1.3 Cetuximab  
 
Cetuximab is a chimeric human -murine monoclonal antibody that binds selectively to the 
extracellular region of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR). Binding inhibits 
ligand -induced, tyrosine kinase -dependent phosphorylation of EGFR and leads to 
internalization and degradation of the receptor. A reduction in available EGFR at the cell 
surface subsequently results in reduced activation of downstream signaling pathways.  
 
Cetuximab has been extensively studied in mCRC, with antitumor activity demonstrated 
both as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy in multiple lines of therapy. 
RU021302I  5 Addendum 3   
 
The BOND -1 trial randomized 329 patients with EGFR+ mCRC who had progressed 
within three months of an irinotecan- based therapy in a 2:1 ratio to irinotecan + 
cetuximab or cetuximab alone (Cunningham, et al, 2004). Response rate (RR) was 
significantly higher with the combination (23% versus 11%), as were median time- to- 
progression (TTP; 4.1 versus 1.5 months) and median overall survival (OS; 8.6 versus 6.9 months). Cetuximab monotherapy was compared to best supportive care in the CO.17 
phase III trial, and RR, PFS, and OS were all statistically higher in the treatment arm (Jonker, et al, 2007). Cetuximab also demonstrated efficacy in the second- line setting in 
the EPIC study, which randomized 1,298 patients with EGFR+ mCRC who had been previously treated with 5- FU- and oxaliplatin-based therapy to irinotecan + cetuximab or 
irinotecan alone (Sobrero, et al, 2008). Although the primary endpoint of OS was not statis tically different between the arms, both median progression -free survival (PFS) and 
RR were significantly higher in the combination arm ( P<0.0001 for both). Finally, the 
CRYSTAL trial randomized 1,198 previously untreated mCRC patients to FOLFIRI + cetuxim ab or FOLFIRI alone, and found a statistically improved median PFS with the 
addition of cetuximab (8.9 versus 8.0 months, P =0.048) (Van Cutsem, et al, 2009). RR 
was also significantly higher in the cetuximab -containing arm (46.9% versus 38.7%, 
P=0.004), but there was no difference in median OS (19.9 versus 18.6 months, P =0.31). 
EGFR positivity was not an inclusion criterion for this trial due to further research that concluded that it was not, in fact, a predictive marker of cetuximab efficacy.  
 
Following t he discovery that EGFR positivity was not predictive of response to anti - 
EGFR therapy, KRAS exon 2 (codons 12 and 13) mutation status emerged as a true biomarker of cetuximab activity. A meta -analysis of 281 irinotecan -refractory patients 
treated with iri notecan -based therapy in combination with cetuximab across seven studies 
showed that among the 35% of patients whose tumors harbored a KRAS mutation in codon 12 or 13, there were no complete (CR) or partial responses (PR) compared to 2% 
CR and 41% PR rates among KRAS wild -type patients (Di Fiore, et al, 2008). Moreover, 
median PFS and median OS were significantly worse among KRAS -mutated patients (2.7 
versus 5.4 months and 8.0 versus 13.2 months, respectively). Subsequently, multiple subgroup analyses of la rge phase III trials of first -line mCRC demonstrated the same 
findings, with KRAS wild type status predicting superior efficacy outcomes to anti -EGFR 
therapy, and worse outcomes among KRAS -mutated patients (Tveit, et al, 2012; Adams, 
et al, 2011; Bokemeyer, et al, 2011; Douillard, et al, 2010; Van Cutsem, et al, 2009). 
 
However, not all tumors with wild type KRAS codon 12 and 13 respond to anti- EGFR 
antibodies, and it has now been reported that this resistance could be explained by [CONTACT_895228]. For example, in a re- analysis of the PRIME 
phase III trial of FOLFOX +/ - panitumumab in first- line metastatic colorectal cancer, 
17% of patients without mutations in exon 2 had other mutations in exons 3 and 4 of 
KRAS and in NRAS exons 2, 3, and 4 (Douilliard, et al, 2013). The presence of these other 
RAS mutations predicted a lack of response to panitumumab, as well as inferior PFS and overall survival in patients receiving FOLFOX + panitumumab compared to FOLFOX 
alone. Consequently, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) updated 
their guidelines to restrict use of anti-EGFR antibodies to patients with all- RAS wild type 
tumors only. 
 
 
1.[ADDRESS_1254866] the vascular endoth elial 
growth factor (VEGF). Although bevacizumab has limited activity as a single agent for  
RU021302I  6 Addendum 3   
 
treatment of mCRC, the addition of the agent to chemotherapy significantly improves 
patient outcome. The phase III trial that won bevacizumab its FDA approval randomized 
815 patients with previously-untreated mCRC to IFL + bevacizumab versus IFL alone, 
and found statistically significantly superior RR (44.8% versus 34.8%, P =0.004), median 
PFS (10.6 versus 6.2 months, P <0.001), and median OS (20.3 versus 15.6 months, 
P<0.001) in the bevacizumab-containing arm (Hurwitz, et al, 2004). The NO16966 trial 
subsequently confirmed the superiority of adding bevacizumab to an oxaliplatin- based 
chemotherapy backbone such as CAPEOX and FOLFOX in the first- line setting (Saltz, et 
al, 2008). Finally, the E3200 trial reported improved median PFS (7.3 versus 4.7 months) 
and OS (12.9 versus 10.8 months) for previously treated mCRC patients randomized to 
FOLFOX + bevacizumab versus FOLFOX alone (Giantonio, et al, 2007). 
 
1.[ADDRESS_1254867] no benefit for the combination of chemotherapy with both an anti -EGFR 
antibody and bevacizumab (Hecht, et al, 2009; Tol, et al, 2009). 
 
Nonetheless, in patients with irinotecan- refractory mCRC, a randomized trial does 
suggest a benefit for the combination of irinotecan, cetuximab, and bevacizumab (Saltz, et al, 2007). That randomized phase II trial, BOND -2 (N = 83), evaluated the safety and 
efficacy of cetuximab and bevacizumab with or without irinotecan in patients with irinotecan -refractory mCRC. The patient population enrolled in the trial had received 
extensive previous treatment with a median number of prior chemotherapy regimens of three. Patients in Arm A (n = 43) of the study received cetuximab, bevacizumab, and 
irinotecan. Patients in Arm B (n = 40) received only cetuximab plus bevacizumab. Patients receiving cetuximab, bevacizumab,  and irinotecan had a TTP of 7.3 months, RR 
of 37%, and an OS of 14.5 months. In comparison, patients receiving cetuximab and 
bevacizumab without irinotecan had a TTP of 4.9 months, RR of 20%, and an OS of 11.4 
months. Of note, BOND-2 only enrolled patient s with bevacizumab -naive mCRC.  
 
These response rates compare favorably with those from other studies in patients with refractory mCRC (see Table 1 below). In the BOND -1 study described above, patients 
with irinotecan -refractory mCRC treated with cetuximab and irinotecan (n = 218) had a 
median TTP of 4.1 months and a RR of 23% (Cunningham, et al, 2004). These results suggest that, in patients with irinotecan -refractory mCRC, the combination of irinotecan, 
cetuximab, and bevacizumab may offer superior efficacy when compared to irinotecan and cetuximab. Moreover, the results suggest that, in contrast to first-line therapy, the 
combination of cetuximab and bevacizumab may offer synergy in later lines of therapy. More recently, other studies suggest a benefit for continuation of bevacizumab into later lines of therapy following progression on first -line chemotherapy and bevacizumab 
(Arnold, et al, 2012).

6.0 Registration/Randomization Procedures  
 
6.1 Registration  
 
6.11 To register a patient, access the ACCRU web page   
go to the Application section and click on "Registration" an d  enter the 
registration/randomization application. The registration/randomization 
application is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Back up and/or system 
support contact [CONTACT_15920]. If unable to access the 
Web site, call the Academic and Community Cancer Research United (ACCRU) 
Registration Office at  between the hours of 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. 
Central Time (Monday through Friday).  
 
The instructions for the registration/randomization application are availa ble on 
the above web page under the Study Resources section, "Application Training." Prior to initiation of protocol treatment, this process must be completed in its 
entirety and an ACCRU subject ID number must be available as noted in the instructions. It is the responsibility of the individual and institution registering 
the patient to confirm the process has been successfully completed prior to 
release of the study agent. Patient registration via the registration/randomization 
application can be confirmed in any of the following ways: 
 
• Contact [CONTACT_15921] . If the patient was 
fully registered, the ACCRU Registration Office staff can access the 
information from the centralized database and confirm the registration.  
• Refer to "Application Training" at : click on 
"Registration, Installation & Entry Instructions".  
 
6.12 Cor
relative  Research  
 
A mandatory correlative research component is part of this study, the patient will be automatically registered onto this component (see Sections 3.19e and 14.11).  
 
6.[ADDRESS_1254877] be on file in the Registration Office before an investigator may register any  patients.  Approvals should be 
uploaded using online ACCRU Regulatory Management System (ARMS).  
 
In addition to submitting initial IRB approval documents, ongoing IRB approval documentation must be on file (no less than annually) with ACCRU. Approvals should be uploaded using online ACCRU Regulatory Management Systems 

RU021302I  15 Addendum 3   
(ARMS). If the necessary documentation is not submitted in advance of 
attempting patient registration, the registration will not be accepted and the 
patient may not be enrolled in the protocol until the situation is resolved.  
  Submission of annual IRB approvals is required until the study has been closed   
through your IRB. 
 
6.14 Prior to accepting the registration/randomization, the registration/randomization application will verify the  following: 
 
• IRB approval at the registering  institution  
• Patient  eligibility  
• Existence of a signed consent form  
• Existence of a signed authorization for use and disclosure of protected health 
information  
 
6.15 At the time of registration, the following will be recorded:  
 
• Patient has given permission to store and use his/her blood and tissue sample(s) for future research to learn about, prevent, or treat cancer.  
• Patient has given permission to store and use his/her blood and tissue sample(s) for future research to learn, prevent, or treat other health problems (for example: diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, or heart  disease).  
• Patient has/has not given permission for ACCRU to give his/her blood and tissue sample(s) to outside researchers.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_1254878] begin ≤ 14 days  after 
registration.  
 
6.18 Pretreatment tests/procedures (see Section 4.0) must be completed within the guidelines specified on the test  schedule.  
 
6.19 a All required baseline symptoms (see Section 10.5) must be documented and 
graded. 
 
6.19b Study drug is available  on site. 
6.19c Cryovials available on  site. 
6.2 Randomization Procedures 
 
6.21 The factors defined in Section 5.0, together with the registering membership, will 
be used as stratification  factors.  
 
6.22 After the patient has been registered into the study, the values of the stratification 
factors will be recorded, and the patient will be assigned to one of the  following 
treatment groups using the Pocock and Simon (Pocock and Simon, et al, 1975) dynamic allocation procedure which balances the marginal distributions of the 
stratification factors between the treatment groups. 
 
• Bevacizumab + irinotecan +  cetuximab  
• Placebo + irinotecan + cetuximab  
 
 
RU021302I  16 Addendum 3   
6.3 Procedures for Double- Blinding the Treatment Assignment  
 
6.31 After the treatment assignment has been ascertained by [CONTACT_376518]/randomization application, the registration specialist will notify the 
designated data manager/nurse/pharmacist at the patient’s  institution.  
 
The name [CONTACT_895268] [CONTACT_895231]. Make sure this contact [CONTACT_895232] a call from the registration specialist if 
necessary. This contact [CONTACT_895233]. The last 
page of the Eligibility Checklist Form should provide the sources of 
communication, either fax or e -mail, and the appropriate contact [CONTACT_3031]. 
The registration specialist will then communicate the treatment assignment 
“active or placebo” to the designated contact [CONTACT_669093]’s institution.  
 
6.32 The treatment assignment will be to bevacizumab + irinotecan + cetuximab or placebo + irino tecan + cetuximab. The bevacizumab/placebo solution will be 
prepared and labeled by [CONTACT_895234] “Bevacizumab OR Placebo” 
so that the contents are not discernible to the person administering the treatment.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_1254879] of care. Suggestions for pretreatment include 
ondansetron 16 mg (or similar agent) and dexamethasone 12 mg PO or IV, and consideration of fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_895212]-fold pack. 
Other anti -emetics may be administered as clinically  indicated.  
 
7.112  Diphenhydramine 50 mg (or similar agent) IV should be administered prior to each dose of cetuximab in an effort to prevent an infusion or 
hypersensitivity reaction. Premedication is recomme nded prior to 
subsequent doses, but a lower dose may be used based on patient tolerance to the previous dose and investigator discretion. Pretreatment with acetaminophen may also be used. 
RU021302I  17 Addendum 3   
 
7.2 Drug/Placebo Administration 
 
7.[ADDRESS_1254880] of care, but the following 
procedure may be considered: 
 
• The first dose of cetuximab  should be administered after 
diphenhydramine premedication (see above) and infused over 120 minutes. 
• If well -tolerated, subsequent infusions may be administered over 
approximately 90 minutes (not to exceed 10 mg/minute).  
• Cetuximab should be administered w ith the use of a low protein - 
binding 0.22 micron in-line filter, and 0.9% normal saline should be used to flush the IV line at the end of the infusion. 
 
7.212  Following cetuximab infusion, bevacizumab/placebo should be given 
according to institutional standard of care, but the following procedure 
may be  considered: 
 
• The initial dose of bevacizumab/placebo should be infused over 90 minutes, the second dose over 60 minutes, and all subsequent doses 
over 30 minutes if prior infusions are tolerated without infusion- 
associated adverse events.  
• For patients in whom elective surgery is contemplated, bevacizumab/placebo should be discontinued for at least 8 weeks prior to  surgery.  
• Bevacizumab/placebo may be resumed after at least 8 weeks following surgery. For patients in whom non- elective surgery is 
required, bevacizumab/placebo should be held as long as possible prior to surgery and for at least 8 weeks following surgery. Other 
protocol treatment may be given while bevacizumab/placebo is held 
at the discretion of the treating  physician. 
 
7.213  Lastly, irinotecan infusion should follow bevacizumab/placebo and should be given over [ADDRESS_1254881] of care.

The site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_895216]/all serious adverse events to the 
sponsor as described within the protocol, regardless of attribution to study agent or treatment 
procedure. 
 
The sponsor/sponsor- investigator is responsible for notifying FDA and all participating 
investigators in  a written safety report of any of the following: 
 
• Any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and  unexpected. 
• Any findings from laboratory animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for 
human subjects, including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or  carcinogenicity.  
• Any findings from epi[INVESTIGATOR_9037], pooled analysis of multiple studies, or 
clinical studies, whether or not conducted under an IND and whether or not conducted by 
[CONTACT_456], that suggest a signifi cant risk in humans exposed to the  drug. 
• Any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over the rate stated in the protocol or Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
 
Definitions  
 
Adverse Event  
Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered drug related. 
 
Suspected Adverse Reaction  
Any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event.  
RU021302I  [ADDRESS_1254890]

10.12  Identify and grade the severity of the event using the CTCAE version  4.0. 
 
10.13  Determine whether the event is expected or unexpected (see Section  10.2). 
 
10.14  Determine if the adverse event is related to the study intervention (agent, medical 
treatment, or procedure) (see Section  10.3). 
 
10.[ADDRESS_1254892] be reported as an expedited report. If yes, 
determine the timeframe/mechanism  (see Section  10.4). 
 
10.[ADDRESS_1254893] also be reported via the routine 
data reporting mechanisms defined by [CONTACT_760] (see Sections 10.5 and 18.0). 
 
Each CTCAE term in the current version is a unique representation of a specific event 
used for medical documentation and scientific analysis and is a single MedDRA Lowest 
Level Term (LLT).  
 
NOTE: A severe AE, as defined by [CONTACT_15928], is NOT  the same as serious 
AE which is defined in the table in Section 10.4. 
 
10.2 Expected vs. Unexpected  Events  
 
Expected events - are those described within the Section 15.0 of the protocol, the study specific consent form, package insert (if applicable), and/or the investigator brochure, (if an investigator brochure is not required, otherwise described in the general 
investigational plan).  

RU021302I  38 Addendum 3   
 
 
Unexpected adverse events or suspected adverse reactions are those not listed in Section  
15.0 of the protocol, the study specific consent form, package insert (if applicable), or in 
the investigator brochure (or are not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed); if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with 
the risk information described in the general investigational plan. 
 
Unexpected also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are 
mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs but have not been observed with the drug under investigation. 
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Event (UADE) 
Any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death 
caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan 
or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated 
serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of 
subjects.  
 
10.3 Assessment of  Attribution  
 
When assessing whether an adverse event is related to a medical treatment or procedure, the following attribution categories are utilized: 
 
Definite - The adverse event is clearly related to the agent(s). 
Probable - The adverse event is likely related to the agent(s). 
Possible - Th e adverse event may be related to the agent(s). 
Unlikely - The adverse event is doubtfully related to the agent(s). 
Unrelated - The adverse event is clearly NOT related to the agent(s).  
 
Events determined to be possibly, probably or definitely attributed to a medical 
treatment suggest there is evidence to indicate a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  
 
10.31  AEs Experienced Utilizing Investigational Agent(s) and Commercial Agent(s) on 
SEPARATE  Arms  
 
• An AE that occurs on an arm using an investigational agent /intervention 
under an IND/IDE must be assessed in accordance with the guidelines in the 
appropriate IND/IDE Reporting Table in Section  10.4. 
 
• An AE that occurs  on an arm using  a commercial  agent  on a separate 
treatment  arm must be assessed  as specified  in the protocol . Refer  to 
Commercial Reporting Table in Section  10.4. 
 
10.32  AEs Experienced Utilizing Investigational Agents and Commercial Agent(s) on 
the SAME  Arm  
 
When a commercial agent is used on the same treatment arm as the 
investigational agent/intervention (also, investigational drug, biologic, 
cellular product, or other investigational therapy under an IND), the 
entire combination (arm) is then considered an investigational 
RU021302I  39 Addendum 3   
 
 
intervention for reporting . These AEs should be assessed as specified 
in the appropriate IND/IDE reporting guidelines in Section 10.4.

* Report any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected 
adverse reaction (at your study site) over that which is listed in the protocol or investigator brochure as an expedited  event.  
 
* Report an expected event that is greater in severity or specificity than expected as an expedited  event.  
 
* An investig ational agent/intervention might exacerbate the expected AEs 
associated with a commercial agent.  Therefore, if an expected AE (for the 
RU021302I  40 Addendum 3   
 
 
commercial agent) occurs with a higher degree of severity or specificity, 
expedited reporting is required. 
 
A list of known/expected AEs is reported in the investigator brochure, package 
insert or the literature, including AEs resulting from a drug overdose. 
 
10.331  Death  
 
• Any death occurring within [ADDRESS_1254894] dose, regardless of 
attribution to an a gent/intervention under an IND/IDE requires 
expedited  reporting  within 24-hours. 
 
• Any death occurring greater than 30 days with an attribution of possible, probable, or definite to an agent/intervention under an 
IND/IDE requires  expedited  reporting wit hin 24-hours. 
 
• Reportable categories of  Death  
 
• Death attributable to a CTCAE  term.  
 
• Death NOS: A cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a 
CTCAE term associated with Grade  5. 
 
• Sudden death NOS: A sudden (defined as instant or within one hour of the onset of symptoms) or an unobserved 
cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE term 
associated with Grade  5. 
 
• Death due to progressive disease should be reported as 
Grade  5 “Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified 
(including cysts and polyps) – Other (Progressive 
Disease)” under the system organ class (SOC) of the same 
name. Evidence that the death was a manifestation of 
underlying disease (e.g., radiological changes s uggesting 
tumor growth or progression: clinical deterioration associated  with a disease  process)  should be submitted. 
 
10.332  Secondary  Malignancy 
 
• A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a 
previous malignancy (e.g., treatment with investigatio nal 
agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary 
malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial  neoplasm. 
 
• All secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an 
agent under an IND/IDE to be reported. Three options are available 
to describe the event:  
RU021302I  41 Addendum 3   
 
 
o Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., Acute 
Myeloctyic Leukemia  [AML])  
 
o Myelodysplastic syndrome  (MDS)  
 
o Treatment -related  secondary  malignancy  
• Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including 
AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting 
mechanisms outlined in each protocol.  
 
10.333  Second Malignancy  
 
• A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior 
malignancy (and is NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy). 
Second malignancies require ONLY routine  reporting.

obtained, no information may be collected. 
 
In cases of fetal death, miscarriage, or abortion the mother is the patient. In cases where the child/fetus experiences a serious adverse 
event other than fetal death, the child/fetus is the patient.  
 
NOTE: When submitting ACCRU Adverse Event Report rep orts for 
“Pregnancy”, “Pregnancy loss”, or “Neonatal loss”, the potential risk 
of exposure of the fetus to the investigational agent(s) or chemotherapy

an adverse event was reported,  
 
 
10.[ADDRESS_1254900] dose of study drug, a report 
should be completed and expeditiously submitted to Genentech, Inc. Follow-up to obtain the outcome of the pregnancy should also occur. 
 
Abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous, should 
always be classified as serious, and expeditiously reported as an 
SAE.  
 
Simila rly, any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to 
a female subject exposed to the bevacizumab should be reported as an SAE.  
 
 10.[ADDRESS_1254901] has co mpleted or discontinued study participation 
if attributed to prior {study drug} exposure. If the investigator 
should become aware of the development of cancer or a 
congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived offspring of a 
female subject , including, pre gnancy occurring in the partner of 
a male study subject] who participated in the study, the should 
be reported as an SAE adequately to Genentech drug Safety 
during follow up period.

Note: This study uses protocol RECIST v1.1 template dated 2/16/2011. See the footnote 
for the table regarding measureable disease in Section 11.44, as it pertains to data collection and analysis.  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international 
criteria proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST) 
guidelines (version 1.1) (Eisenhauer, et al, 2009) . Changes in the largest diameter 
(unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the short axis measurements in the case 
of lymph nodes are used in the RECIST guideline . 
 
11.1 Schedule of  Evaluations 
 
For the purposes of this study, patients sh ould be reevaluated every 8 weeks (e.g. 4 
cycles).  
 
11.[ADDRESS_1254905] diameter can 
be accurately measured as ≥2.[ADDRESS_1254906] x- ray, or as ≥1.[ADDRESS_1254907] component of a PET/CT, or MRI.

CT/Chest X -ray/physical examination must be measured on re- 
evaluation at evaluation times specified in Section 11.1. Specifically, a 
change in objective status to either a PR or CR cannot be done without 
re-measuring target l esions and target lymph nodes. 
 
NOTE : Non -target lesions and non-target lymph nodes should be 
evaluated at each assessment, especially in the case of first response or 
confirmation of response. In selected circumstances, certain non- target 
organs may be evaluated less frequently. For example, bone scans may need to be repeated only when complete response is identified in target 
disease or when progression in bone is suspected. 
 
11.432 Evaluation of Target  Lesions  
 
• Complete Response (CR):  
 
All of the following must be true: 
 
a. Disappearance of all target lesions. 
 
b. Each target lymph node must have reduction in short axis to 
<1.0 cm. 
 
c. Normalization of tumor biomarkers (i.e., CEA).  
 
• Partial Response  (PR):  
 
At least a 30% decrease in PBSD (sum of the longest  diameter for 
all target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes at current evaluation) taking as reference the BSD 
(see Section 11.41). 
 
• Progression (PD):  
 
At least one of the following must be true: 
 
a. At least one new malignan t lesion, which also includes any 
lymph node that was normal at baseline (< 1.0 cm short axis) 
and increased to ≥ 1.[ADDRESS_1254913] a 20% increase in PBSD (sum of the longest diameter 
for all target lesions plus the sum of the s hort axis of all the 
target lymph nodes at current evaluation) taking as reference 
the MSD (Section 11.41). In addition, the PBSD must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 0.5 cm from the 
MSD.  
 
c. See Section 11.32 for details in regards to the requirements for 
PD via FDG -PET imaging.  
 
• Stable Disease (SD):  
 
Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR, nor sufficient 
RU021302I  51 Addendum 3   
increase to qualify for PD taking as reference the MSD  
 
11.433 Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions & Non -target Lymph  Nodes 
 
• Complete Response (CR):  
 
All of the following must be true:  
 
a. Disappearance of all non -target  lesions. 
 
b. Each non-target lymph node must have a reduction in short 
axis to <1.0 cm. 
 
• Non-CR/Non -PD: 
 
Persistence of one or more non-target lesions or non- target lymph 
nodes. 
 
• Progression (PD):  
 
At least one of the following must be true: 
 
a. At least one new malignant lesion, which also includes any 
lymph node that was normal at baseline (<1.0 cm short axis) 
and increased to ≥1.0 cm short axis during  follow-up. 
 
b. Uneq uivocal progression of existing non- target lesions and 
non-target lymph nodes. (NOTE: Unequivocal progression 
should not normally trump target lesion and target lymph node 
status. It must be representative of overall disease status 
change.). 
 
c. See Section 1 1.32 for details in regards to the requirements for 
PD via FDG -PET imaging.  
 
11.44  Overall Objective  Status  
 
The overall objective status for an evaluation is determined by [CONTACT_177109]’s status on target lesions, target lymph nodes, non- target lesions,

14.3 Study Methodology and Storage Information 
 
14.31  Blood/blood product samples will be collected for future biomarker studies. 
Analysis will be completed when funding is secured.  
 
We will address the following questions as part of the hypothesis generation stage:  
 
14.311  Identify predictive and prognostic markers (DNA, cfDNA, RNA, 
cfRNA) and assess their associations with toxicity, prognostic value, 
and response to  treatment.  
 
14.312  Define key molecular subtypes and assess their associations with toxicity, prognostic value, and response to treatment.  
 
14.313  Determine the prognostic and predictive values of immune signatures.  
 
13.314 Investigate stem cell signatures and their association wit h RR,  PFS,  OS 
and dependent on location/Braf/MSI.  
 
14.32  Use of Circulating Cell- Free DNA (cfDNA) to Monitor Response and Determine 
Mechanisms of Resistance to  Cetuximab  
 
Predictors of clinical benefit from and markers of resistance to EGFR antibodies are urgently needed in order to better select patients for treatment and identify 
those unlikely to respond. In addition, mechanisms of acquired resistance remain 
unclear and need to be understood if effective new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_895220]. Given the procedural risks, cost, and patient 
inconvenience of post -treatment tumor biopsies, the analysis of cfDNA obtained 
from plasma may provide a non- invasive means of interrogating the biology 
underlying response and resistance to EGFR inhibition. Indeed, recent years have witnessed several high profile publications demonstrating the potential power of 

RU021302I  57 Addendum 3   
 
 
cfDNA genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Studies on cfDNA specimens from 24 colon cancer patients 
demonstrated that resistance arose via point mut ations in KRAS . (Diaz LA, Jr., 
Williams RT, Wu J, et al. The molecular evolution of acquired resistance to targeted EGFR blockade in colorectal cancers. Nature 2012;486:537-40.) In a 
second study, these same mutations were found in two of two patient biops y 
samples after progression on EGFR inhibitors and cfDNA detection appeared to predict resistance to treatment up to 10 months prior to radiographic progression. (Misale S, Yaeger R, Hobor S, et al. Emergence of KRAS mutations and 
acquired resistance to an ti-EGFR therapy in colorectal cancer. Nature 
2012;486:532-6.) 
 
We have developed a new technology for non- invasive quantification of specific 
tumor mutations in cfDNA isolated from plasma specimens by [CONTACT_325200] (ddPCR). ddPCR emulsifies input DNA into ~20,000 droplets that are PCR 
amplified and fluorescently labeled, and then read in an automated droplet flow 
cytometer. Each droplet is individually assigned a positive or negative value 
based on the fluorescent intensity. The number of positive and negative droplets is read by a flow cytometer and is used to calculate the concentration of an allele. 
To gauge feasibility, we studied serial plasma specimens from patients with 
genotype-defined lung cancer or melanoma to determine whether changes in 
cfDNA were representative of tumor biology ( Figure 1 ). In a patient with EGFR- 
mutant NSCLC receiving chemotherapy after failing erlotinib ( Figure 1A ), an 
increase in plasma L858R and T790M was seen with development of new brain metastases, followed by [CONTACT_895244] a clinical 
trial was initiated. In a second case of EGFR- mutant NSCLC receiving 
chemotherapy ( Figure 1B ), plas ma L858R decreased as the patient’s pleural 
drainage resolved, though CT imaging of the non- measurable disease showed 
disease stability. In a patient with KRAS- mutant NSCLC and bone metastases 
(Figure 1C ), chemotherapy caused a decrease in plasma G12C levels concordant 
with improved pain control and decreased opi[INVESTIGATOR_895221]. Lastly, a patient 
with BRAF-mutant melanoma had progression on experimental immune therapy 
followed by [CONTACT_895245] ( Figure 1D ), seen in the rise and fall of 
plasma V600E levels. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_895222], even in patients without objectively measurable disease on  CT. 
 
This data also suggests that such a non -invasive assay could be used to 
characterize the biology of resistance. For the colorectal cancer patients enrolled 
in this study, genotype concentrations of KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF mutations will 
be evaluated initially . As more ddPCR assays are validated and new knowledge 
about resistance mechanisms emerges, the mutations to be studied can be broadened to include genes such as PIK3CA, PTEN, EGFR, among others. 
Remaining plasma will be banked for this purpose of future r esearch.

Figure 1. Serial measurement of plasma genotype for disease monitoring. A wide dynamic range 
is seen in some cases (A, B). Decreases in plasma genotype can be seen both in cases of objective tumor shrinkage (A, D) and in cases of symptomatic response with no measurable disease (B, C). 
Concurrent EGFR L858R (A, solid line) and T790M (A, dashed line) mutations trend in parallel.  
 
 
14.33  Droplet Digital PCR  (ddPCR) 
 
ddPCR involves dilution of DNA molecules into an aqueous/oil suspension 
containing the necessary reagents for PCR. After disturbance of the suspension, thousands of aqueous compartments (or “droplets”) within the oil emulsion are 
formed, and PCR reactions are cycled and quantified using a flow cytometer. We 
have built our ddPCR so that standard TaqMan reagents can be used. In brief, 
TaqMan PCR reaction mixtures will be assembled from a 2× ddPCR Mastermix 
(Bio-Rad) and custom 40x TaqMan probes/primers made specific for each assay. 
Nineteen uL of assembled ddPCR reaction mixture p lus 6 μL of ultra pure 
distilled water will be loaded into sample wells of an eight- channel disposable 
droplet generator cartridge (Bio-Rad). An additional seventy uL of droplet 
generation oil (Bio -Rad) will be loaded into the oil well for each channel.  
Droplets will be transferred to a 96 -well PCR plate and amplified to end- point by 
[CONTACT_895246] .After PCR, the 96- well PCR plate will be read on the QX -100 
droplet reader (Bio- Rad) and analyzed by [CONTACT_895247] 
(Bio-Rad) that acc ompanies the droplet reader. Each plasma sample will be 
analyzed in triplicate with an increasing quantity of input DNA (e.g. 1 μL , 2 μL , and 4 μL ). Results will be normalized to the mean concentration of mutant 
alleles per μL DNA input, and reported as  copi[INVESTIGATOR_895223] [ADDRESS_1254922] been validated by [CONTACT_427951]-approved la boratories.  
 
15.0 Drug  Information 
 
15.1 Bevacizumab (Avastin ) 
 
Investigator brochure will be available on the ACCRU website.  
 
15.11  Background : Bevacizumab is classified as an Anti -VEGF Monoclonal Antibody 
and a Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) Inhibitor. Bevacizumab is a recombinant, humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody which 
binds to, and neutralizes, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), preventing its association with endothelial receptors, Flt-[ADDRESS_1254923]. VEGF binding initiates 
angiogenesis (endothelial proliferation and the formation of new blood vessels). 
The inhibition of microvascular growth is believed to retard the growth of all tissues (including metastatic tissue).  
 
15.12  Formulation : Bevacizumab is manufactured by [CONTACT_12060], 
using a genetically engineered Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line. The 
protein is purified from the cell culture medium by [CONTACT_853458]. The final product is tested for quality, identity, 
safety , purity, potency, strength, and excipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]/chemical composition according 
to International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines. The purity of bevacizumab is >95%. 
 
Bevacizumab is supplied in 100 mg (4 mL) and 400 mg (16 mL) glass vials, each with a concentration of 25 mg/mL. Vials contain bevacizumab with phosphate, 
trehalose, polysorbate 20, and sterile water for injection (SWFI), USP. Vials 
contain no preservative and are suitable for single use only.  
 
15.13  Preparation and storage : Bevacizumab vials s hould be stored in a refrigerator 
at 2°C -8°C. Keep vial in the outer carton due to light sensitivity. DO NOT 
FREEZE. DO NOT  SHAKE.  
 
Chemical and physical in -use stability has been demonstrated for 48 hours at 
2°C-30°C in 0.9% sodium chloride solution. Do n ot administer or mix with 
dextrose solution. From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions 
are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours 
RU021302I  60 Addendum 3   
 
 
at 2°C to 8°C, unless dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic 
conditions. 
 
Withdraw the necessary amount of bevacizumab and dilute to the required 
administration volume with 0.9% sodium chloride solution. The concentration of 
the final bevacizumab solution should be kept within the range of 1.4 - 16.5 
mg/mL. Discard any unused portion left in a vial, as the product contains no preservatives. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for 
particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. 
 
15.14  Administration : Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus. Administer 
only as an intravenous (IV) infusion. Do not initiate bevacizumab for [ADDRESS_1254924] infusion: Administer infusion over 90 minutes. Subsequent infusions: Administer second inf usion over [ADDRESS_1254925] infusion is tolerated; 
administer all subsequent infusions over 30 minutes if infusion over 60 minutes is tolerated.  
 
15.15  Pharmacokinetic  information : 
Distribution: Vd: 46 mL/kg (limited extravascular distribution)  
Half -life elimination: ~20 days (range: 11-50 days) 
Clearance: 2.75-5 mL/kg/day. A low serum albumin and high tumor burden 
increase clearance by 30% and 7% respectively. Clearance increases with increasing body weight, and is 15% slower in women than men. 
Time to steady state: 100 days  
 
15.16  Potential Drug Interactions: 
Overall the results from the drug- drug PK interaction investigations 
showed no interaction between bevacizumab and the anti- cancer agents 
tested. Co-administration of bevacizumab with various che motherapeutic 
and other anti -cancer agents resulted in similar values of CL and Vc for 
bevacizumab, suggesting that the exposure of bevacizumab are not 
affected by [CONTACT_131696], capecitabine, 
capecitabine/oxaliplatin (XELOX), 5- FU/le ucovorin, 5 - 
FU/leucovorin/irinotecan (IFL), 5- FU/leucovorin/oxaliplatin (FOLFOX4), 
erlotinib, carboplatin, cisplatin, oxaliplatin, paclitaxel, gemcitabine, 
temozolomide or interferon -α2a. 
 
The effect of bevacizumab on the disposition of several agents 
(doxorubicin, 5-FU, irinotecan [and its active metabolite SN38], 
capecitabine, oxaliplatin, carboplatin, cisplatin, paclitaxel, gemcitabine, erlotinib, temozolomide and interferon alfa- 2a) has been investigated. 
Accumulating data do not suggest that bevacizumab affects disposition of anti-neoplastic agents.  
 
Increased Effect/Toxicity: Bevacizumab may enhance the cardiotoxic effect of Antineoplastic Agents (Anthracycline, Systemic). Bevacizumab may also  
RU021302I  61 Addendum 3   
 
 
enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Irinotecan, Sorafenib, and Sunitinib. Sunitinib 
may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Bevacizumab. Specifically, the risk for a 
specific form of anemia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), may be 
increased.

Monitor these patients especially close.  
 
15.[ADDRESS_1254927] patien t to report to  MD. 
 
15.198  Monitor blood pressure. Administer antihypertensives as ordered by [CONTACT_28839]. 
 
15.199a Monitor for signs and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or 
pulmonary embolism (PE), or myocardial infarction (MI) including 
new or worsening angina. These have been reported with therapy. 
Instruct patient to report any calf pain, chest pain or shortness of breath to MD immediately.  
 
15.199b Asthenia and headache were reported commonly during therapy (in up 
to 70% and 50% of patients respectively). Admi nister acetaminophen 
as needed. Monitor for its effectiveness. Avoid the use of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], or ibuprofen as this may interfere with the coagulation cascade and 
further add to the risk of  bleeding. 
 
15.199c Monitor CBC, including platelets. Instruct patient to report signs and 
symptoms of infection, unusual bruising or bleeding to the MD. 
 
15.199d Patients receiving warfarin therapy for thrombosis should have their 
PT or INR monitored weekly until two stable therapeutic levels are attained. For patients on warf arin for venous access prophylaxis, 
routine monitoring is satisfactory.

15.2 Irinotecan (Camptosar®,  CPT11) 
 
15.21  Background : Irinotecan and its active metabolite (SN -38) bind reversibly 
to topoisomerase I -DNA complex preventing relegation of the cleaved 
DNA strand. This results in the accumulation of cleavable complexes and 
double-strand DNA breaks. As mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair 
these breaks, cell death consistent with S -phase cell cycle specificity 
occurs, leading to termination of cellular replication.  
 
15.22  Formulation : Commercially available for injection 20 mg/mL (2 mL, 5 
mL, 25 mL) [contains sorbitol 45 mg/mL; do not use in patients with 
hereditary fructose intolerance].  
 
15.23  Preparation, storage, and stability : Store intact vials at room 
temperature (15 to 30ºC or 59 to 86ºF) and protect from light. Doses should be diluted in 250-500 mL D5W or 0.9% NaCl to a final 
concentration of 0.12-2.8 mg/mL. Solutions diluted in D5W are stable for 
24 hours at room temperature or 48 hours under refrigeration at 2ºC to 
8ºC. Solutions diluted in 0.9% NaCl may precipi[INVESTIGATOR_391882]. Do not 
freeze.  
 
15.24  Administration : Administer b y I.V. infusion, usually over 90 minutes. 
 
15.25  Pharmacokinetic 
information : 
Distribution: Vd: 33-150 
L/m2 
 
Protein binding, plasma: Predominantly albumin; Parent drug: 30% to 68%, 
SN-38 (active metabolite): ~95% 
Metabolism: Primarily hepatic to SN -38 (active metabolite) by [CONTACT_391912]; SN -38 undergoes conjugation by [CONTACT_31672]- glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 
(UGT1A1) to form a glucuronide metabolite. Conversion of Irinotecan to SN-38 
RU021302I  65 Addendum 3   
 
 
is decreased and glucoronidation of SN -38 is increased in patients who smoke 
cigarettes, resulting in lower levels of the metabolite and overall decreased 
systemic exposure. SN -38 is increased by [CONTACT_15924]1A1*28 polymorphism (10% of 
North Americans are homozygous for UGT1A1*28 allele). Patients homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele are at increased risk of neutropenia; initial one- level 
dose reduction should be considered for both single-agent and combination regimens. The lactones of both Irinotecan and SN-38 undergo hydrolysis to inactive hydroxyl acid forms. 
Half -life elimination: SN-38: Mean terminal: 10-20 hours 
Time to peak: SN-38: Following 90-minute infusion: ~1 hour 
Excretion: Within 24 hours: urine: Irinotecan (11% to 20%), metabolites (SN-38 
<1%, SN-38 glucuronide, 3%) 
 
15.26  Potential Drug  Interactions: 
 
Cytochrome P450 Effect: Substrate (major) of CYP2B6, 3A4, P- 
glycoprotein, SLCO1B1 and UGT1A1 
Increased Effect/Toxicity: CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase the levels/effects of irinotecan. Bevacizumab may increase the a dverse effects of 
irinotecan (e.g., diarrhea, neutropenia). Ketoconazole increases the levels/effects 
of Irinotecan and active metabolite; discontinue ketoconzaole 1 week prior to 
irinotecan therapy; concurrent use is contraindicated.  
Decreased Effect: CYP 2B6 and CYP3A4 inducers may decrease the 
levels/effects of irinotecan.  
Ethanol/Nutrition/Herb Interactions Herb/Nutraceutical: St John’s wort 
decreases therapeutic effect of irinotecan; discontinue ≥2 weeks prior to 
irinotecan therapy; concurrent use is co ntraindicated.

15.[ADDRESS_1254929] CPT -11 infusion. If diarrhea 
occurs within one hour of infusion, refer to Section 9.2 or 15.16 for 
management.  
 
15.293  Patient education is extremely important. Impress on the patient the 
importance of compliance with treatment of diarrhea management (see Section 9.4). Stress the need for prompt recognition and early 
intervention. Motivate the patient to report any complications 
immediately. The cholera-like syndrome can be unresponsive to 
conventional antidiarrheals and can result in severe dehydration. 
 
15.294  Ondanestron and diphenhydramine should provide good relief from the 
nausea/vomiting/crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Avoid prochlorperazine on the day of 
RU021302I  67 Addendum 3   
 
 
treatment  due to its association with akathisia (motor restlessness). 
Prochlorperazine may be taken between treatments.  
 
15.295  Advise avoidance of excess caffeine, a GI stimulant. Avoid 
magnesium- based antacids such as Mylanta, Maalox, Rolaids, MOM, 
Mag-Ox 400, and Tylenol with  antacid.  
 
15.296  The pulmonary toxicity seen is usually manifested by [CONTACT_391913] 42- 175 days after treatment and occurs at a cumulative dose 
ranging from 400-1000 mg/m (median 750). Instruct patient to report 
any cough or SOB.

15.3 Cetuximab  (Erbitux®)  
 
15.31  Background : Cetuximab is a recombinant human/mouse chimeric monoclonal 
antibody which binds specifically to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR, HER1, c -ErbB -1) and competitively inhibits the binding of epi[INVESTIGATOR_610131] (EGF) and other ligands. Binding to the EGFR blocks phosphorylation and activation of receptor- associated kinases, resulting in 
inhibition of cell growth, induction of apoptosis, and decreased matrix 
metalloproteinase and vascular endothelial growth factor production. EGFR 
signal transduct ion results in KRAS wild -type activation; cells with KRAS 
mutations appear to be unaffected by [CONTACT_821841].  
 
15.32  Formulation : Commercially available for injection 2 mg/mL (50 mL, 100 mL).  
 
15.33  Preparation, storage, and stability : Refer to package insert for complete 
preparation and dispensing instructions. Store intact vials at refrigeration 
temperature (2 to 8ºC 38 to 46ºF), do not freeze or shake. Reconstitution is not 
required. Appropriate dose should be added to empty sterile container; do not

15.[ADDRESS_1254931] resuscitative medications should be available 
during and for one hour following the cetuximab infusion. 
 
CAUTION: Infusion reactions may occur during or following cetuximab administration. Most infusion reactions occur with the first 
infusion of cetuximab, but some patients’ first infusion reactions have 
been reported following subsequent doses (as far out as the 8th dose). The infusion reaction may occur during the infusion, or be delayed 
until any time after the infusion. A nurse should be present in the 
immediate treatment area throughout the infusion and observation 
period. A physician should be in close proximity to the patient 
treatment area. Should an infusi on reaction occur, the patient should be 
treated according to institutional guidelines. Patient should be 
instructed to report any delayed reactions to the investigator immediately. Patients who have had severe reactions should not 
receive further doses of Cetuximab.

16.0 Statistical Considerations and Methodology 
 
16.1 Study Design  Overview  
 
This randomized Phase II trial is designed to primarily compare progression- free survival 
(PFS) in patients with RAS wild-type, irinotecan- refractory metastatic colorectal cancer 
who have also previously received bevacizumab in at least one prior line of t herapy, who 
receive irinotecan and cetuximab plus bevacizumab (experimental arm) versus irinotecan 
and cetuximab plus placebo (control arm). The BOND-1 study (Cunningham, et al, 2004) 
reported a median time to progression of 4.1 months in patients with iri notecan -refractory 
metastatic colorectal cancer who received irinotecan plus cetuximab. The BOND -2 study 
(Saltz, et al, 2007) randomized irinotecan-refractory mCRC patients to bevacizumab and cetuximab with or without irinotecan. They reported a median time to progression of 7.3 
in patients who received irinotecan, cetuximab and bevacizumab. Therefore, to design the 
current trial, we assumed median PFS of 4.1 months in the control arm. 
RU021302I  71 Addendum 3   
 
 
16.2 Sample Size, Accrual Rate, and Study Duration 
 
16.21  Sample Size: The study design to be utilized is fully described in Section 16.3. 
There will be 30 patients randomized to each treatment group of the study (total 
of 60 patients).  
 
16.22  Accrual Rate and Accrual Duration: We anticipate a ccruing 4 patients per month. 
With a minimal follow -up of 6 months, we anticipate that the study will take 
approximately 15 months to accrue if there are no major issues of patient safety.  
 
16.23  Primary Endpoint Completion Date for Clinical Trials.gov Reporting : For 
purpose of ClinicalTrial.gov reporting, the primary endpoint completion date for 
this study is the time the last patient registered has been followed for at least 6 
months. 
 
16.3 Statistical Design and Analysis for the Primary  Endpoint 
 
16.31  Primary  Endpoint: 
 
The primary endpoint is progression- free survival (PFS), defined as time from 
the date of randomization to the date of 1st documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. For patients who died without 
documented progressive disease, if the date of last disease evaluation which 
shows progression-free status is within [ADDRESS_1254934] disease evaluation date.  
 
For patients who are alive and progression- free at the time of primary efficacy 
analysis, the following censoring rules will be implemented:  
 
• Primary rule – PFS will be censored at the date of last disease evaluation which shows progression- free status.  
• Secondary rule for sensitivity analysis – PFS will be censored at the  earlier 
date of  
 
o Last disease evaluation which shows progression -free status 
o Protocol- specified treatment discontinuation due to severe toxicity  
o Start of alternative treatment due to rea sons other than progressive 
disease or severe toxicity  
 
The primary endpoint analysis will be conducted based on the intent- to-treat 
(ITT) population. Sensitivity analysis will be conducted based on the per- 
protocol (PP) population and applying the secondary rule for determining the 
censoring time.  
 
The followings are the definitions of the various analysis populations: 
 
• Intent- to-Treat (ITT) population: All randomized patients regardless of 
whether they received any treatment and regardless of their final  eligibility 
status. Patients will be analyzed in the group to which they were randomized. 
RU021302I  72 Addendum 3   
 
 
• Per-Protocol (PP) population: All randomized patients meeting the eligibility 
criteria who received  at least one dose of the treatment and did not have any 
major treatment violations. Patients will be included in the analysis in the 
group closest in principle to the initial treatment they actually  received.  
• Safety Analysis (SA) population: All patients who received any quantity of study treatment. Patients will be grouped according to treatment  received.  
 
16.32  Statistical  Design:  
 
A total of 55 events will provide 80% power to detect a treatment effect of 
hazard ratio (HR) = 0.562 (corresponding to median PFS of 4.1 and 7.3months in 
control and experimental arm, respectively) with a one-sided log- rank test, at the 
significance level of 0.10. With the assumptions of accruing 4 patients per month 
and minimal follow up of 6 months, total of 60 patients (30 per ar m) will be 
randomized. The sample size calculation was conducted using EAST v6.4. There is no interim analysis is  planned. 
 
Decision Rules: The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted when there are at least 55 events observed for PFS (approximately [ADDRESS_1254935] 
patient has accrued). At the conclusion of the trial, the experimental regimen will be concluded to be superior to the control regimen, if the p- value of log -rank test 
is less than 0.1 (equivalent to HR < 0.708). 
 
16.33  Study Operating Characteristics:  
 
The table below shows the study operating characteristics assuming the time -to- 
event endpoint of PFS follows exponential survival function. The proportion of times that the study would conclude that the experimental regimen is superior to 
the control regimen is tabulated by [CONTACT_895248].

16.4 Supplementary Analysis Plans (Secondary  Endpoints): 
 
All analyses of secondary e ndpoints will be conducted in the ITT population, with the 
exception of safety endpoints, which will be conducted in the Safety population, or 
otherwise specified. 
 
16.41  Adverse events: Adverse events: The maximum grade of each adverse event and its attribution  will be recorded for each patient. The frequency tables will be 
reviewed to evaluate for patterns of toxicity. The overall adverse event rates for Grade [ADDRESS_1254936] (or  Fisher’s exact test if the data in the contingency

with adjusting for baseline clinical/pathological factors.  
 
16.43  Disease control rate (DCR): Disease control status will be determined using tumor assessment data collected from date of initiation of the treatment to the 
date of treatment discontinuation. Disease control is defined as maintaining CR 
or PR or SD as the tumor assessment result during the defined time window. DCR is defined as number of patients with success of disease control divided by 
[CONTACT_895255], excluding patients who refuse treatment before the initiation of any treatment. DCR will be compared between 
two treatment groups using Chi- square test (or Fisher’s exact test if the data in 
the contingency table is sparse). Logistic regressi on models will be used to 
estimate the odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval without and with adjusting 
for baseline clinical/pathological factors.  
 
16.44  Overall response rate (ORR): Overall response rate (ORR): Overall response 
status will be determined using tumor assessment data collected from date of initiation of the treatment to the date of treatment discontinuation. Overall 
response is defined as achieving CR or PR as the best tumor assessment result during the defined time window. ORR is defined as number of patients with CR 
or PR as the best overall response divided by [CONTACT_895256], excluding patients who refuse treatment before the initiation 
of any treatment. ORR will be compared between the two treatmen t groups using 
Chi-square test (or Fisher’s exact test if the data in the contingency table is 
sparse). Logistic regression models will be used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval without and with adjusting for baseline 
clinical/patholo gical  factors.  
 
16.45  Duration of response (DOR): DOR is defined as time from the date of first tumor assessment with the response status being CR or PR to the date of 1st 
documented progressive disease. If a patient never achieves CR or PR during 
treatment, the  DOR will be censored with zero DOR time. If a patient is off 
protocol treatment due to severe AE or other non-PD reasons, the DOR time will

month durable response (i.e. maintaining CR or PR without PD) rates by [CONTACT_895253] - 
Meier curves. The HR with confidence interval will be estimated based on stratified Cox models (stratified by [CONTACT_895254]), without and 
with adjusting for baseline clinical/pathological factors.  
 
16.46  Time to treatment failure (TTF): TTF is defined as time from the date of randomization to the date of treatment discontinuation due to PD, death, or 
severe AE. If a patient discontinues protocol treatment for reasons other than PD, 
he/she will be censored at the date of treatment discontinuation. The distribution of TTF by [CONTACT_895258]- Meier. 
Six month event- free rates by [CONTACT_895259] -Meier curves. The HR with confidence interval will 
be estimated based on stratified Cox models (stratified by [CONTACT_895254]), without and with adjusting for baseline clinical/pathological factors.  
 
16.47  Relative dose intensity (RDI): RDI is defined as the total dose of protocol 
therapy a patient actually received (i.e., summation of actually received dose at each cycle) divided by [CONTACT_895260] (i.e., summation of planned dose 
level at each cycle). Separate RDIs will be calculated for irinotecan and cetuximab. Agent- specific RDI will be summarized by [CONTACT_3163], 25th  percentiles,  
median s, 75th percentiles, and min and max values, all of which will be 
compared between the two treatment groups by [CONTACT_895261]. 
 
16.48  Correlative: One of the objectives of this correlative study is to determine the change in genotype concentrations of pre -specified gene mutations in circulating 
cfDNA collected serially from baseline to treatment with cetuximab to progression. We plan to estimate the mean and median change in mutation 
concentration for each pre-specified gene, and provide the corresponding 95% 
confidence intervals. With a total of [ADDRESS_1254937] 80% power to detect an average change in the concentration of RAS mutations equaling at least 0.[ADDRESS_1254938] and 5% type I error.  
 
We plan to estimate the distribution of progression- free survival (PFS) and 
overall survival (OS) using the Kaplan -Meier method and calculate confidence 
limits using the Greenwood formula. We will apply Cox proportional hazards models to explore the predictive value of pretreatment mutation status for 
cetuximab sensitivity and resistance, using PFS and OS as the outcome variables.  
 
We will also explore the dynamic change in mutation concentration while the patient is receiving cetuximab treatment. We will use scatter pl ots and box plots 
to illustrate such change.

Accrual will be temporarily suspended to this study if at any time we observe events considered to be clinically relevant and at least possibly related to study 
treatment (i.e., an adverse event with attribute specified as “possible”, 
“probable”, or “definite”), in either treatment group, that satisfy the following: 
 
If [ADDRESS_1254939] 20 treated patients ( or 25% of all patients after 20

We note that we will review grade 4 and 5 adverse events deemed “unrelated” or “unlikely to be related”, to verify their attribution and to monitor the emergence 
of a previously unrecognized treatment- related adverse event.

16.62  Results Reporting on ClinicalTrials.gov: At study activation, this study will have been registered within the “ClincialTrails.gov” web site. The Primary and 
Secondary Endpoints (i.e., “Outcome Measures”) along with other required information for this study will be reported on ClinicalTrials.gov.  
 
16.7 Minorities Distributions (sex, race,  ethnicity):  
 
This study will be  available to all eligible patients, regardless of race, gender, or ethnic 
origin. 
 
There is no information currently available regarding differential effects of this regimen in subsets defined by [CONTACT_545], gender, or ethnicity, and there is no reason to expect such differences to exist. Therefore, although the planned analysis will, as always, look for 
differences in treatment effect based on racial and gender groupi[INVESTIGATOR_14839], the sample size is 
not increased in order to provide additional power for subset analyses. 
 
We expect about 8% of patients will be classified as minorities by [CONTACT_31961] 40% of 
patients will be women. Expected sizes of racial by [CONTACT_895262].

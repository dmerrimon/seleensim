12. REFERENCES …………………………………………………………………….. 24-[ADDRESS_1018442] on the tooth surface 
when the or thodontic hardware is removed. This discoloration halo (white spot les ion) is due 
to acidic demineralization of the tooth surfac e beneath the adherent dental plaque. The tooth 
surface beneath the bracket is protected from plaque development and resultant acidic 
leaching of dental minerals. Upon bracket remova l, the discrepan cy in tooth mineralization 
between these adjacent areas is  now exposed creating  the unaesthetic  white spots. 
Unfortunately,  many orthodontic patients  to some degree,  develop  these unaesthetic white 
spots on their teeth . 
 
The purpose of this research study  is to determine if utilizing a proteolytic oral pre-rinse can 
hydrolyze the glycoprotein bond s which adheres  the dental plaque  to the dental pellicle  (tooth 
surface in vivo).  It is proposed here that the proteolytic enzyme may  loosen the bond enough  to 
allow for  dislodge ment by [CONTACT_744453], and further reduction in oral plaque with subsequent 
water  jet propulsion .  
 
The question to be answered is thu s: in an adolescent patient with orthodontic appliances and poor 
oral hygiene, can the water jet  more easily  reach those areas protected from the bristles of the 
toothbrush (created by [CONTACT_744454]) and dislodge  the enzymatically  loosened  
plaque?  If so, an enzyme pre -rinse may have a place in orthodontic hygiene 
procedures.   
 
The findings of this study may lead to future research studies investigating whether the addition of 
proteolytic enzymes can also enhance the overall oral hygiene in the general population . Possibly  
removing plaque between teeth and other areas where brush ing alone can’t reach.  
 
It is well known that u pon initiation of fixed orthodontic appliance therapy there is a 
significant increase in dental plaque accumulation, in which patient education and oral 
hygiene instruction alone has proven insufficient to overcome (1). Poor oral hygiene durin g 
orthodontic treatment results in  a high prevalence of whit e spot lesions on anterior tooth 
surfaces surrounding brackets. Martignon et al showed 96% of patients had one or more white 
spot lesions following orthodontic treatment (2). 
[ADDRESS_1018443] and abrasive  function of the toothbrush bristles  to 
dislodge  adherent  dental  plaque  from the  tooth  surface. R esidual plaque following brushing in 
orthod ontic patients has been found along the gum line,  around brackets and beneath wires (3). 
 
The orthodontic wires make flossing an arduous task, which is why many patients give up and 
never adequately remove dental plaque from orthodontic hardware and dental  contact [CONTACT_360222].  
Numerous studies have correlated fixed orthodontic treatment with less than optimal oral hygiene (4). 
Orthodontic induced gingivitis (5) (7) typi[INVESTIGATOR_744435] (6). Following the placement of the orthodontic fixed appliance, the resultant 
change in oral hygiene creates an environment favorable to Streptococcus mutans (8) and an 
increase in gram negative bacteria which are associated with periodontal disease (9). Improved  
oral hygiene would likely prevent many  adverse sequelae commonly associated  with 
orthodontic treatment (2). 
 
Previous studies have used pre -rinsing agents as an oral hygiene adjunct and demonstrated 
mixed results.  Boyd found  Hydrogen peroxide -sodium fluoride rinse is more effective than 
sodiu m fluoride rinse alone in preventing gingivitis and decalcification in adolescent 
orthodontic patients (10). Miranda, conducted a trial using water, Listerine, or Plax, as pre -
rinse agents and concluded that pre -rinsing in children demonstrated no difference in plaque 
removal (11). However, Tufekci showed the addition  of Listerine rinse to an oral hygiene 
protocol significantly reduced plaque (more than just brushing and flossing alone in 
orthodontic patients ). He concluded that the addition of Listerine was helpful for fixed 
orthodontic patients to reduce their risk o f white spots development and gingivitis (12).  
Pontier’s study concluded there was  no difference between pre -rinse (Plax TM versus 
placebo) for plaque removal in orthodontic patients (13). 
 
Water irriga tion (pulsating water jet therapy), another adjunct to oral hygiene, has 
demonstrated a significant difference in biofilm (14) and plaque removal - especially in 
difficult to reach dental plaque retention areas , such as  around the orthodontic brackets and 
wires (6). The plaque removal was also increased utilizing  a specialized orthodontic water jet 
tip as compared to a standard water jet tip (15). 
 
Surprisingly little has been investigated concerning proteolytic hydrolysis (to loosen the 
dental biofilm) influence on  oral hygiene (16). No published studies could be located 
(PubMed) that involve use of prot eases as a plaque removal aid  in the orthodontic patient . 
Literature search revealed a study of Krillase (enzym e obtained from ocean krill) included in a 
chewing gum to reduce gingivitis and plaque acumination (17). Published articles utilizing the  
plant  enzym e papain in orthodontics include:  orthodontic bonding and sheer bond strength  
study  (18) and the effect of different concentrations of papain gel have on orthodontic bracket 
adhesion  study  (19). 
 
Papain and Bromelain are naturally occurring serine proteases. Papain is derived from the 
latex from green papaya fruit ( Carica papaya ) while bromelain is obtained from p ineapple 
stalks ( Ananas comosus ). Because of their innate proteolytic activity, papain and bromelain 
have been used extensively in the food and medical industries. Both enzymes are included on 
the FDA’s “Generally Re cognized as Safe” (GRAS) list. Both bromelain and pap ain are used 
commercially for tenderizing meat  and producing protein hydrolysates  (20). These  proteolytic 
enzymes have  a broad range of substrate  specificity , which ea sily and efficiently hydrolyze 
[ADDRESS_1018444] soluble protein s, yielding peptides and amino aci ds by[CONTACT_133294].  
 
Other uses of these enzymes are in t oothpaste  (papain/b romelain combi nation as the active 
ingredient) for  extrinsic enamel stain removal (21, 22) (23). These enzymes have also been 
used for wound debridement for of damaged collagen and necrotic tissue in humans (24). 
Finally, h ealth food enthusiasts clai m dietary supplementation with papain and bromelain may 
be useful in alleviating joint pain and inflammation and supplementing natural digestive 
proteases.  
 
1.3.  Potential Risks and Benefits  
 
1.3.1.   Potential Risks      
 
Product Risks  
 
Irritation of the  oral cavity can occur, (also known as stomatitis or angular chelitis), and has 
occurred among those individuals who eat extraordinary amounts of fresh pi[INVESTIGATOR_70945].  The use of an 
active protease in an oral rinse may cause stomatitis or angular chelitis and p ossibly irritate  an 
undetected oral ulcer and cause the subject discomfort.  
 
Adverse reactions  
 
Hypersensitivity/allergic reactions have been reported in individuals who have supplement ed their 
diet with bromelain and are allergic to pi[INVESTIGATOR_70945]. Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea were reported in 
such instances  following ingestion.  
 
Contraindications   
  
Use of bromelain is contraindicated in those who are hypersensitive or allergic to pi[INVESTIGATOR_744436].  Gastrointestinal or oral ulcers, use of anticoagulant/blood thinner medication, antibiotics 
or anticipating  surgery would also be contraindications to ingestion of active proteases.  
 
Precautions  
 
Bromelain has a long history of being used in the food indust ry and no serious side effects or 
deaths have been reported. Nevertheless, certain precautions will be taken in using this natural 
protease.  
 
Rinses will be  expectorate d. Only a negligible amount of enzyme may be ingested unless the test 
subject inadverten tly swallows the solution. Even in this scenario, this should not be a problem 
since quantities in greater amounts are frequently ingested by [CONTACT_744455].  
 
Interactions  
 
Since bromelain  is an active serine protease, it is susceptible to inactivation or denaturation by 
[CONTACT_744456], chemicals or ions. Therefore, the oral rinse test solution s will not have alcohol or 
fluorine compounded within the solution tested.   
  
Over dosage  
 
11 
 Bromela in has been shown to be safe when ingested in less than 130,000 FCC papain units per day 
(approximately 1.5 g of enzyme preparation). Symptoms of over dosage  using bromelain as an oral 
rinse would include development of oral ulcers, stomatitis or angular c helitis.  This would produce 
mild discomfort for a few days while the oral mucosa regenerates.  
 
Additional Risks  
 
Additional potential risk  to the subjects include  cross contamination. This risk  will be managed  by 
[CONTACT_744457],  whom will follow  strict 
infection control guidelines outlined by [CONTACT_744458].  This includes h andwashing 
between subjects, use of single use  nitrile gloves , and face masks (for researchers)  during the 
intraoral exam.  Vials and cheek retractors will be single use . 
 
Loss of confidentiality of private informa tion collected is another  risk. To counter this risk, all data 
collected on paper w ill be stored in a locked area a nd limited to study perso nnel. Electronic data 
will be stored in an encrypted, password protected computer file with access limited to study 
personnel.  All records will be identified by [CONTACT_34161]. A master  list will be maintained  
which will  match  the subject to their study number and this list will be stored in a secured area.  
 
1.4.     Adequacy of Protection against Risks  
 
To limit the potential risks of ingestion of the active ingredients, persons with the following 
conditions will be excluded from participation in the study:  
1. gastrointestinal or oral ulcer  
2. taking an anticoagulant/blood thinner medication or antibiotic s  
3. anticipating surgery  in the next six months   
4. allergic to proteolytic enzymes , pi[INVESTIGATOR_744437]  
5. pregnant, breastfeeding or intending to become pregnant in the next six months  
 
1.5. Known Potential Benefit s 
 
There is no known benefit for the subject.  
  
2. STUDY DESIGN  
 
This will be a single site, c ross-over, double -blind  study with up to [ADDRESS_1018445] a week 
time interval between the two arms of the study  (length of wash out phase: one week). The study 
will be completed over the course of two  weeks. Each  step in the protocol  will be timed  to 
reduce  inter- and intra -subject  variability. Toothbrushes used in the study will be uniform, a 
new tooth brush will be used at each arm of the study. All oral hygiene aids will be of the 
same brand to eliminate variability (eg: all toothbrushes will be of the same brand, all 
disclosing t ablets of the same brand, etc).  For standardization and optimal photography, the same 
type of cheek retractor and digi tal camera will be used for all  subject s. 
 
Hypothesis  
 
Null: There is no statistically significant difference in visual plaque scores with  or without use 
of a proteolytic enzyme rinse aid.  
 
12 
 Alternative: There is a statistically significant difference in visual plaque scores with use of 
proteolytic enzyme rinse aid.  
Product Description  
 
This study will use bromelain as the proteolytic enzyme in the oral rinse. Bromelain is an  enzyme 
naturally found in hig h concentration in the stem of pi[INVESTIGATOR_384252]. This proteolytic, protein -
digesting enzyme breaks down (hydrolyzes) proteins by [CONTACT_744459]  (25). For this reason, bromelain is commonly used 
as a digestive aid, (in pi[INVESTIGATOR_135808]) or (in powder form) as a meat tenderizer.   
 
2.1. Study S chedule  
 
In both arms of the study, the steps will be exactly the same to isolate the effect of the enzyme.  
Data (digital  photograph) will be obtained after each oral hygiene step to prevent confounding 
variables.  
 
First Visit  
 
a. Describe study and obtain informed consent , if not previously consented by [CONTACT_648] (see 
attachment) .  
b. An oral soft tissue exam will be completed (see section 7.4).  
c. Randomize subject and  select a subject kit  (test box)    Patient writes name [CONTACT_744481].  The patient name [CONTACT_744482].  
d. Stain oral plaque with two-tone plaque disclosing tablet  (individually packaged disclosing 
tab). Instructions for test subject using oral disclosing agent: “chew tablet  completely, then 
swish  around  in your mouth  and between your teeth . I will time you for 30 seconds and tell 
you when to spi t it out in the sink.” Rinse with 15ml of tap water to remove unbound stain.  
e. First photograph  (base line  plaque  before  oral hygiene procedures ) obtained  with unique  
identifying number  (see 9.4). 
f. Subject chooses one of the test vials from their box and the serial number on the vial is 
recorded (placebo rinse or enzymatic rinse ). (The second vial will be used on the second 
testing visit.)  
g. The student investigator will r econstitute oral rinse powder  in vial with 15 mL  warm 
(50°C ) pi[INVESTIGATOR_744438].  Stir into solution with disposable 
swizzle stick.  
h. Hand the vial with th e dissolved oral rinse solution  to the subject . The subject  will then 
place the entire contents at once into their mouth and swish it between their teeth and side

3.[ADDRESS_1018447] Recruitment  
 
14 
 Potential subjects will be recruited from patients at the Indiana University School of Dentistry 
Orthodontic Department. Recruitment methods will include the following:  
 
1) An IRB approved flyer will be hung in the waiting room and various locations within th e 
clinic.   
2) The student investigator will call patients who are her patients in the clinic to determine 
interest . 
3) All residents and faculty will assist in distributing an IRB approved flyer that contains a 
section with contact [CONTACT_744461]. Potential subjects will be able to place  completed interest  
forms  with their contact [CONTACT_744462] a secured drop box in the clinic for the student 
investigator to access. The student in vestigator will then call the potential subjects to 
discuss the study . 
 
In all cases, the stud ent investigator will use an IRB approved telephone script to review the study 
with the potential subjects. If the potential subject is interested in participatin g, and if time allows, 
the consent and assent will be sent to the potential subject by [CONTACT_744463]. Consenting and assenting, as 
applicable, will occur in the clinic prior to any  study procedures being performed. Consenting may 
also occur by [CONTACT_648], using the consent documents sent by [CONTACT_2319]. Test s ubjects will attend two 
testing  visits approximately one week apart. These visits will be outside  from their normal 
orthodontic visits.  
 
Subjects will be compensated for their time in the study by [CONTACT_744464] $50 ($25 per visit) for participating  in the study. Payment will be in 
the form of Visa gift cards.  
 
4. TEST TREATMENTS  
 
4.1.      Administration of Study Investigational Product  
 
The components of each treatment will be formulated prior to treatment and placed in a plastic vial. 
Each of the vials for the oral rinse treatments will be labeled with a unique set of n umbers for  subject 
and stage of treatment (only decoded by [CONTACT_744465]).  
 
4.2. Blinding/Unblinding Procedur es 
 
To eliminate potential human bias, photos will be graded  independently  by [CONTACT_744466] . The examiner will be  
blind ed with regard  to the stage  and visit  of the  oral hygiene procedur es. The identification on the 
photos will not allow the examiner to know which photos came from the same subject, which 
series they are evaluating (baseline staining, post -rinse, post -brush, post -Waterpik) and which 
treatment.  
 
Each photo will be independently  reviewed  and scored assessing  the degree of plaque  staining  
from  one to five. An example  photograph  of each degree  (1-5) will be given  to the examiner  
for standardization.   
 
The researchers  and subjects  will be  blinded  to knowing which  vial has the proteolytic  enzyme 
treatment.  The subsequent visit the subject will receive the second vial. The study records  will be 
maintained by [CONTACT_744467]  (DR. KS) .  
[ADDRESS_1018448] eight randomly assigned serial numbers corresponding to each 
testing step and visit (two different study visits with four photographs each).  
 
4.3     Photo Labeling  
 
A photographic sequence identifier (A -D) will be added to the patient’s random subject ID to 
properly log and sequence the obtained photographs. The following codes will be utilized in the 
study:  
A: After use of the disclosing tablet  
B: Af ter 2 minute rinse with provided solution  
C: After brushing  
D: After the use of the WaterPik   
 
4.4. Treatment Compliance  
  
It is expected most subject s enrolling in the study will complete both  treatment visits . Since the 
treatments are to be administered to the subject  and supervised , compliance with the protocol is 
expected.  
 
4.5. Randomization Procedures  
 
Subjects will be stratified  randomly by [CONTACT_290947].  Subjects will be allocated random sets 
of serial numbers kept on a master list which will be retained in a secured location. The faculty 
member grading the photographs will be given the [ADDRESS_1018449] to identify which vial (A or B) 
the patient will receive at the first and second visits, r espectively.  
 
Prior to beginning the study, the dry powdered components for  each treatment  rinse will be 
weighed and place d into clean 20 mL vials, (for both  the enzymatic and placebo  rinse) and sealed 
with plastic caps. This will prevent contamination or  spi[INVESTIGATOR_4598]. All vials will be prepared at one 
time in a clean room prior to the study.  
 
Selected committee member s will measure out one gram of enzyme and one gram of placebo 
(powdered sugar) for each subject. Both the placebo and the proteolytic rinse comp ounds will be 
weighed, formulated and placed into darkened 20 mL vials with a plastic top. Each vial will  then 
be assigned the appropriate code (Product A or Product B) by [CONTACT_22888] -investigator K.S.  Only this 
investigator (K.S.) will know the identity of the  vial contents and will share this information with 
the statistician at the time of statistical analysis.  The formulated compounds placed in the clean 
vials will be stored in a locked secured location.   
 
Manufacture of Bromelain R inse:  
 
16 
 The bromelain enzyme will be obtained (donated) in bulk powder form from Ultra Bio -logics Inc. 
(Chateauguay, Quebec, Canada). The Ultra Bio -logic bulk bromelain concentrated supplement is 
standardized (by [CONTACT_4657]) to 2400 Gelatin Digesting Units ( GDU )/gram.  The strength of an 
enzyme  is quantified in GDU/gram units. GDU/gram tells us how much protein a  gram of 
bromelain can digest. The proteolytic rinse will contain  one gram of bromelain  brought  into 
solution with 15ml of pi[INVESTIGATOR_744440] . One gram of br omelain is within the recommended daily 
dosage  for oral consumption by [CONTACT_3455] . 
 
Bromelain is stable at room temperature for more than a year in its dry form. It is active when 
reconstituted with warm water.  (In this study - warm pi[INVESTIGATOR_744441]). Since bromelain is active in the liquid form, the rinse will be constituted with  canned  
pi[INVESTIGATOR_744442].  Bromelain’s 
enzymatic activity is des troyed by [CONTACT_744468]. Thus, the canned 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_744443].  
 
 Bromelain’s optimal activity is at 55°C. This is approximat ely the temperature of very warm 
coffee. To achieve optimal results a temperature controlled hot plate will be used to k eep a pot of 
warm pi[INVESTIGATOR_744444] 50°C available to mix with the powdered mixture just prior to 
administration.  
 
Manufacture of Plac ebo Rinse:  
 
The placebo rinse will consist of powdered sugar and pi[INVESTIGATOR_713927].  Powdered sugar has the 
same color and consistency as the bromelain powder.  This placebo will not be discernible once 
weighed and placed in sealed vials. Canned pi[INVESTIGATOR_744445], which is 
destroyed in the pasteurization process.  
 
The components of the two study rinses  are as follows : 
 
TREATMENT A: Placebo   TREATMENT B: Proteolytic Rinse  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_713927]  (15 mL ) Pi[INVESTIGATOR_713927]  (15 mL ) 
Powdered sugar (1.0 gm)  Bromelain powder  (1.0 g ) 
 
5.2. Clinical Procedures  
 
All study materials needed for each test subject will be contained in a new cardboard box.  Each box 
will contain:  
• Vial of enzyme powder with attached set of assigned random numbers  
• Vial of placebo powder with attached set of assigned random numbers  
• 10 disposable cheek retractors  
• Two disclosing tablets for staining  
• Waterpik device  
• Two toothbrushes (pre -pasted and individually sealed by [CONTACT_4657])  
 
After explaining the experiment in obtaining consent  (either by [CONTACT_48052]) , the subject will 
be randomized and given their assigned study box. The subject will then put their name [CONTACT_744483]. The name [CONTACT_744484]. The student researcher will the n record the first serial number with the 
name [CONTACT_744485]. This will be entered on the master list. The master list will then have been 
[ADDRESS_1018450] box containing the Waterpik and the remaining mater ials will be sealed with adhesive 
tape and secured in a locked room. When the patient returns for their next testing visit, that subjects’ 
box will be retrieved and the second vial labeled with the subject’s second set of number s will then 
be used.  The te st procedure will be repeated as with the first visit as described in 2.1.  
 
5.3. Informed Consent Process  
 
Informed consent will be obtained from subject s and two parent s (if the subject is a minor  <18 yrs  
and if 2nd parent is reasonably available within the CFR regulations ) prior to participation in study  
either in person or by [CONTACT_648]  (see 10.2) . Assent will be obtained from all children under age 18. For 
children 14 to 17, the adult consent will be used as the assent form.   
 
5.4. Oral Photography Process  
 
Standardization of photographs: a ll photographs will be taken from the same angle  (frontal) , to 
include only th e teeth and lips of the subject, with  a single use,  hands -free cheek retractor.  Subject 
will be partially open so that  the lower dentition is fully visible for photography.  Each photograph 
will be at the same magnification (s ee 10.4).  The adhesive label with the corresponding serial 
number will be placed on the subject’s chin and will be included in the photograph.  
 
6. EFFICACY MEASUREMENTS AND EVALUATIONS  
 
6.1      Tra ining & Calibration of Examiner : 
 
One examiner  from the Department of Periodontics and Allied Dental Programs or Cariology, 
Operative Dentistry and Dental Public Health, will be recruited to assess the plaque index  of the 
digital photographs . An example of five oral photographs with varying degrees of  stained adherent 
dental plaque will be graded  according to the Orthodontic Plaque Index and use d as a reference in 
grading the study pho tographs.  The examiner will independently grade the residual plaque in each 
photograph.  
 
The examiner will first be ca librated by [CONTACT_88687] 10 randomly selected images and re -score the 
same images  after a one week washout period . Once reliability testing of the examiner is at 0.8 or 
higher  as measured by [CONTACT_554577] -class correlation coefficient , the examiner will  proceed to  judge 
each photograph of the study .  
 
6.2. Dental Plaque Evaluation  and Data M anagement  
 
Teeth will be disclosed and the facial tooth surfaces will be graded for visual plaque.  
Incisors (#s: 7 -10 and 23 -26) will be visually evaluated on digital photographs and assigned a 
score (0 -4) according to the orthodontic plaque index  (see figure 1 belo w). Examiner will be given 
a visual scale of comparison, which corresponds with the Orthodontic Plaque Index (OPI) for 
diagnosing dental plaque around orthodontic brackets. Each  tooth  will each receive a n individual  
score , in addition  all tooth scores will  be added together to calculate a composite score  for upper 
incisor and lower incisor segments .  All recorded plaque scores will be  recorded in an excel 
document on a password protected laptop computer by [CONTACT_488659].  
 
To eliminate potential human bias, a s ingle examiner from the Indiana University School of 
Dentistry with clinical dental experience, will judge each photograph. This examiner will be 
[ADDRESS_1018451] to the stage of the oral hygiene procedure as described above.  
 
Data/digital photographs will be viewed on the same computer and will be backed up daily onto a 
secure box.iu.edu health account, which will only be accessible to researchers and by [CONTACT_744469].  Research laptop will remain in secure location and locked 
whenever not in use.  
 
Plaque scoring:  
 
 
Figure 1: Orthodontic Plaque index scoring system( Beberhold ).  
 
6.3. Retention of Photograp hs 
 
Digital photographs and  any study material will be maintained for seven years following the 
completion of this study, as per Indiana law. Paper records will be stored in locked cabinets that only 
study personnel can access . Electronic records will be stored in encrypted, password protected files 
only accessible by [CONTACT_3462].  
 
7. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
 
7.1. Study Safety Ma nagement  
 

19 
 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_415881] a serious adverse event occurs. An adverse event will be 
considered any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom or disease associated with the use of the 
bromelain (investigational product) or t he conduct of the study.  
 
All adverse events will be reported to  the IRB during annual review.  
All serious adverse events will be reported immediately to the IRB. Se rious adverse even ts include:  
any event resulting  in death, is life-threatening, requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], results in 
disability/permanent damage, congenital anomaly/birth defect, or require s intervention to prevent 
permanent impairment or damage, and/or other medical events (31). 
7.2. Medical/Dental Monitor  
 
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_744446].  
 
7.3.  Specification of Safety Parameters  
 
The temperature of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_713927]  (to reconstitute the solutions ) will be monitored  to make 
sure it is 50°C plus or -1°C. The formulated compounds placed in the clean vials will be stored in a 
locked secured location.   
 
7.4. Methods for Assessing Safe ty Parameter s 
 
Each subject  will be given the student  investigator ’s phone number to call if they should experience 
any discomfort or unusual symptoms. On the second visit each subject  will be questioned as to 
whether they experienced any discomfort or symptoms from the treatment at the first visit  and an 
oral soft tissue  exam will be completed.   
 
7.5. Safety Oversight Pla n 
 
All subjects will receive a follow - up phone call the night of the study and  reminded of the contact 
[CONTACT_744470] -effects. Subject will 
be instructed to make contact, should  they experience any discomfort or unusual symptoms.  
This is part of the study’s s afety plan to assure the subjects are not rea cting negatively to the 
product.  
 
On the second visit each subject  will be questioned as to whether they experienced any discomfort 
or symptoms from the treatment (symptoms of over dosage using bromelain as an oral rinse may  
include development of oral ulcers, stomatitis or angular chelitis) at the first visit & an oral soft 
tissue exam will be completed.  
 
If a subject  experiences unusual side effects or appears to be experiencing an allergic reaction the 
subject  will immediately be excluded from the study and will seek medical care if indicated.  
 
8. DATA ANALY SIS  
8.1.      Sample Size Determination  
 
[ADDRESS_1018452] 9 0% power to detect a difference of 0.5 between 
the aver age plaque scores with and without enzyme after waterjet, assuming a two -sided paired t -
tests conducted at a two -sided 5% significance level.  
 
8.2. Statistical Analysis  
 
Intra -examiner repeatability of the individual surface scores will be evaluated using weighted kappa 
statistics and repeatability of the subject -level index scores will be evaluated using intra -class 
correlation coefficients (ICCs) and Bland -Altman plots. Subject -level plaque scores will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_3148] (with or without enzyme) and stage (baseline, post -rinse, pos t-brushing, 
post-waterjet). The effects of the treatment will be evaluated using a repeated measures ANOVA 
suitable for a crossover stu dy. The ANOVA will include fixed effects for treatment, stage, and their 
interaction, will treat stage as a repeated factor w ithin subject for each study arm , and will i nclude a 
factor for study arm . Age and sex groups will be included as covariates due to  the stratified 
randomization. The ANOVA will also include an effect for treatment sequence to evaluate the model 
for a carry -over effect. If the treatment sequence effect is significant, the full analysis may need to 
be interpreted cautiously or the analy sis may need to be limited to using only the res ults from the 
first study arm . A 5% significance lev el will be used for all tests. Statistical analyses will be 
performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).   
 
9. OBLIGATION OF THE INVESTIGATOR  
 
9.[ADDRESS_1018453] Assent  
 
Informed assent will be obtained from subjects  (who are minors)  prior to participation in study.   
 
9.[ADDRESS_1018454] Consent  
 
Informed consent will be obtained from subjects (and both parents of minors  unless, per CFR 
regulations, only one parent signature [CONTACT_137672] ) prior to participation in study.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_1018455] -for evaluation of facial surfaces of anterior incisors (upper and 
lower) . An intraoral dental plaque disclosing agent  will be used to stain  the oral plaque  present,  
which will be documented via digital photography.  
This study involves two separate visits. At each visit there will be a total of four photographs 
obtained.  Each time the subject’s teeth are photographed it will involve a frontal photograph  to 
include only the fac ial surfaces of the teeth of each subject.  Lingual surfaces of teeth will not be 
taken into account as the focus of this study relates to oral hygiene procedures around fixed 
appliances - all fixed appliances in this study will be on facial  surfaces.  
[ADDRESS_1018456] 
throughout the study.  
The same type of camera (Canon Rebel EOS with 100mm macro lens) and camera settings (f -stop: 
32, shutter speed: 1/60, ISO: 200) will be used for each sub ject at every data collection.  
Photographs will be taken at the same magnification and focus. The student investigator will 
review all photos immediately following to ensure that they are of diagnostic quality.  
 
Diagnostic quality of data (digital photos of dentition) will be defined as non -blurry digital photos 
of dentition of upper and lower incisors with orthodontic fixed appliances in place . The dentition 
visualized will be the same in each subject and for both study visits.  Facial surfaces of upper and 
lower incisors will be clearly and completely visualized in the digital photos.  No lips will obstruct 
the tooth in the photo.  Orthodontic appliance will remain on the teeth which are photographed and 
plaque sur rounding the b racket and wire will be graded according to visual plaque index.  
 
Data/photo collection will be standardized so that all photos are taken at the same step in the 
hygiene process/step of protocol  (in this way, a photo is taken after each oral hygiene procedure to 
evaluate any change in amount of dental plaque)  (See Flow Chart in Appendix , page 22 ).  
  
1) Baseline  plaque  photograph following chewing/spi[INVESTIGATOR_744447].  
2) Post-treatment rinse  (enzyme or placebo) photograph . 
3) Post- brushing photograph.  
4) Post-Waterpik  photograph.  
 
Each photograph will be independently  reviewed  using the same computer and scored assessing 
the degree of plaque  according to the Orthodontic Plaque  index method  by a single examiner.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_1018457] adherence to the protocol is essential to eliminate variables which would invalidate the study 
design. Subjects  unwilling or unable to follow the protocol will be eliminated from the study.  
 
9.6 Records Retention  
 
A digital copy of all the photographs and scoring will be retained by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_744448] , as per Indiana law . 
 
9.7 Investigator’s Final Report  
 
The data and scoring from each subject  will be compared with respect to eac h arm of the study. A 
report will be written with the results and statistical analysis of the study results. A paper will be 
written and submitted for publication with  the summation of the findings.

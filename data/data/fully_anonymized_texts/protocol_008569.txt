CHOP   The Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65412] :   
Complications related to infant (< 1 year)  airway management are under- appreciated 
because of few rigorous and targeted studies. We have recently shown that multiple tracheal 
intubation (TI)  attempts are a key risk factor for intubation -related complications in small 
children1. Tracheal Intubation using Video laryngoscopy (VL) has become popular in 
anesthesiology practice because of several advantages over conventional direct 
laryngoscopy (DL) . Studies show that VL improves the view of the airway compared to DL , 
requires fewer intubation attempts,  but may take  more time to intubate the trachea. Our 
multicenter quality improvement project of children with difficult intubations  demonstrated 
that using VL instead of DL was associated with fewer TI attempts and fewer  complications.  
 
Objectives :  
• Primary Objective  
To compare the tracheal intubation (TI) first attempt success rate using VL vs. DL in 
children < 12 months old. 
• Secondary Objectives  
 Number of attempts for successful intubation 
 Frequency of failure to intubate with assigned device 
 Frequency of complications such as hypoxemia related to intubation with the two 
study devices 
 
Study Design :  
Prospective, randomized, multi- center  parallel group  trial 
 
Setting/Participants: 
This will be a multi- center study with  a minimum of four participating centers.  The target 
population will be children < 12 months age scheduled for elective surgery requirin g general 
anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.  
Study Interventions and Measures :  
The study intervention will be  a 1:1 randomization to perform tracheal intubation with the 
Storz  C-Mac Video Videolaryngoscopy ( VL) or the Standard  Direct Laryngoscope (DL) . 
 Main study outcome measures are as follows: 
o The first intubation attempt success rate with each device  
o The number of attempts for successful intubation with each device 
o Complications  associated with intubation

Number Of Subjects  
 It is expected that approximately 650 subjects will be enrolled to 
produce 550 evaluable subjects.  Single site enrollment will be 
capped at 250 subjects or 200 evaluable subjects.  
 
It’s expected approximately [ADDRESS_71221]’s participation will last  up to [ADDRESS_71222] to  complete the enrollment in about two years.  
Study Phases  
Screening Study Treatment  
Follow -Up    (1) Screening : identifying potential subjects  and obtaining consent  
 (2) Intervention: randomization  
 (3) Follow-up: Chart review for intubation related adverse events 
up to [ADDRESS_71223]-intubation  
 
For clinician participants  
(1) Screening:  identifying anesthesia clinicians from the department 
list 
(2) Consent: verbal consent will be obtained 
(3) Clinical experience data will be collected   
(4)  
Efficacy Evaluations  The primary efficacy endpoint will be successful tracheal intubation  
Safety Evaluations  Tracheal intubation  by [CONTACT_65418]. Other than randomization, there is no 
study intervention that will be intro duced to the subjects. Subjects 
will be monitored per institutional standard practice . Any procedure 
related AEs will be treated per institutional standard practice.  
Statistical And 
Analytic Plan  We will consider a 10% improvement in first attempt success  rate 
for VL compared to DL to be indicative of a significant clinical effect. The statistical analysis of this change will be based on a logistic regression model where an odds ratio greater than 2.[ADDRESS_71224] attempt will be compared for VL 
and DL using conditional logistic regression with alpha = 0.029 
    
   
   ix 
used for significance.  This more stringent criteria for significance 
(0.029 instead of 0.05) is Pocock’s method of correction for 
maintaining overall study significance level at 0.[ADDRESS_71225] clinical risks 
associated with intubation. There is n o DSMB for this study.

   [ADDRESS_71226] laryngoscopy and multiple tracheal intubation attempts. Our previous multicenter study showed that 20% of children experienced a complication and 
children who weighed less than 10kg had 2x the complication rate OR(95% CI) 2.09(1.51-2.88) p < 0.0001. In both our difficult airway and normal airway populations more than [ADDRESS_71227] attempt success rates of DL and 
VL2. This meta -analysis had significant weaknesses  because of marked heterogeneity in 
patient characteristics;  the clinician’s  experience, the type of VLs used and varied  
definitions of outcomes.  The authors included fourteen trials in this me ta-analysis, but only 
two studies specified  the same age range of patients .  Age is  an important factor when 
   
   [ADDRESS_71228] been associated with severe complications in 
diverse clinical settings4-7.   
• Souza et al. found in a study of 147 children in the ICU that 14.3% required 5 or more attempts and that attempts were associated with more trauma, hypoxemia and bradycardia
8.   
• Another study examined the impact of introducing non-angulated video laryngoscopy on advanced airway management success by [CONTACT_65419][INVESTIGATOR_6885]. After the introduction of videolaryngoscopy, first pass success rates increased from 75.4% to 94.9% 
(significant at CI 99%, chi square = 35.12, Fisher’s exact test), combined first and 
second pass success rates increased from 89.2% to 97.4% (significant at CI 99%, chi square = 12.44, Fisher’s exact test).  
• We conducted a prospective multicenter study (PeDI Registry)  examining our 
tracheal intubation practice in children with difficult airways and found that hypoxemia was common and hypoxemic cardiac arrest occurred in 1:80 patients. We associated multiple attempts >2 with more complications and every attempt was 
associated with more complications odds ratio 1.5 per attempt (95% CI 1.4-1.6; 
p<0.0001). In a large comparative retrospective analysis of VL to DL using the National Emergen cy Airway Registry for Children’s ICU database , our team found 
that using videolaryngoscopy was independently associated with a lower occurrence 
of tracheal intubation adverse events (adjusted odds ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.42-0.77; 
p< 0.001) but not severe tracheal intubation adverse events (adjusted odds ratio, 0.86 CI, 0.56-1.32; p =0.49) or fewer multiple attempts at tracheal intubation (adjusted odds ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.71-1.22; p= 0.59). Videolaryngoscopy was associated with lower odds of bronchial intubation (OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.22-0.74; p= 0.003), 
esophageal intubation with immediate recognition (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.34-0.69; p < 
0.001) and dysrhythmia (OR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.15-0.88; p = 0.019)
9. Although in this 
study videolaryngoscopy did not reduce multiple attempts, we believe this result is not applicable to our proposed study for a few reasons. Firstly, there was 
heterogeneity in the type of videolaryngoscopy being used i.e. non-angulated and 
angulated videolaryngoscopy were used and the type was not noted on all the data collection forms.  Angulated videolaryngoscopes have been shown to prolong 
intubation time and are associated with more difficulty with inserting the breathing 
tube. Secondly, the population studied was  primarily older children in ICU’s, and 
   
   3 
finally, there was a selection bias in the study, with videolaryngoscopy being 
disproportionately chosen for children with difficult airways.  
• A recent Cochrane review of videolaryngoscopy vs direct laryngoscopy for tracheal 
intubation in children (excluding neonates) further highlights the urgent need for 
high quality prospective randomized studies. In that review the authors had difficulty reaching conclusions because of “very low quality evidence due to imprecision, 
inconsistency and study limitations”
10.  
• We performed a retrospective cohort analysis (data pending publication) using our 
electronic medical records to rigorously analyze our experience with infants with 
normal airways presenting for elective surgery between January 24, [ADDRESS_71229] laryngoscopy without comorbidities presenting 
for elective surgery. We analyzed the final dataset of 1343 cases and found that 15.6% of cases required more than [ADDRESS_71230] 
data logs to determine epi[INVESTIGATOR_65413] (sp02 <90% for more than 1 
minute) occurring around the time of intubation (from anesthesia start to anesthesia ready). We found that the number of laryngoscopy attempts was significantly associated with hypoxemic events (Univariate - Poisson: RR 1.4257 (95% CI 1.2576 
- 1.6164) p <.0001 , Negative Binomial: RR 1.4421 (95% CI 1.2289 - 1.6922) p <.0001, GEE:  RR 1.4421 (95% CI 1.2596 - 1.6510)) p <.0001), (Multivariate - Poisson: RR 1.3256 (95% CI 1.1363 - 1.5463) p= 0.0003, Negative Binomial: RR 1.3707 (95% CI 1.1327 - 1.6585) p= 0.0012 ,  GEE: RR 1.3707 (95% CI 1.1302 - 
1.6623) p=0.0014)). Our analysis showed that the (371 of 1134) 32.7% of children 
with one attempt experienced severe hypoxemia while (101 of 210) 48.1% of those with multiple attempts experienced severe hypoxemia. These results are likely an over estimation of the true incidence of severe hypoxemia since there was no way for 
us to exclude low oxygen saturation readings related to tourniquets applied during 
intravenous access. Nevertheless, the differences between the two conditions (multiple vs. single attempt) are likely accurate since it is unlikely there was a disproportionate application of tourniquets in one group versus the other.  
 Taken together these preliminary data and prior studies demonstrate the significance of the problem and the feasibility and validity of our intervention to reduce complications.  A prospective randomized trial is the only way to eliminate these issues.

3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 General Schema of Study Design  
This study is a p rospective, randomized, multi- centered  controlled trial.  
 3.1.1 Screening Phase  
Potential subjects will be identified from patients scheduled for elective surgery  or 
procedure per protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria. Parental/guardian permission 
(informed consent) will be obtained prior to any study related procedures being performed. 
 
Potential clinician participants will be identified from departmental anesthesia clinician  lists 
including attending anesthesiologists, anesthesia fellow s, and anesthesia residents.  
 
3.1.2 Study Intervention Phase  
[IP_ADDRESS] Randomization: 
The only research procedure is randomization to TI device as VL or DL for the first 
intubation attempt.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Intubation:  
Tracheal  intubation using VL or DL are clinical standard s of care devices at all participating 
centers .   
  
   
   5 
[IP_ADDRESS] Follow-up (Up to 24 hours after intubation ) 
Chart review to collect information regarding  any intubation related AE s. 
 
3.2 Allocation to Treatment Groups and Blinding 
CHOP will be the Data Coordinate Center ( DCC ). The DCC  will generate the randomization 
sequence by [CONTACT_657] . The randomization sequence will be maintained in  study EDC, a 
CHOP REDCap  registry , by [CONTACT_65420].  
 
Randomization will be stratified  by [CONTACT_65421] ’s role at each site with random block 
sizes of [ADDRESS_71232] 
intubation attempt. Any subsequent attempts will be at the supervising clinician’ s discretion 
either with the  randomized device or an alternate device  
 Blinding of study device and study staff is not feasible  in this  study. However, the 
statistician s will be blinded at the time of data analysis.  
 
3.[ADDRESS_71233]-intubation.  
The study duration for clinician participants could be up to the study enrollment duration.  
3.3.2 Total Number of Study Sites/Total Number of Subjects Projected  
The study will be conducted at 4-10 centers in the [LOCATION_002], [LOCATION_008] and 
Australia. It is expected that approximately 650 subjects will be enrolle d to produce 550 
evaluable subjects.  Single s ite enrollment will be capped at 250 subjects or 200 evaluable 
subjects .   
 
It’s expected approximately 500 qualified anesthesia clinician participants will be enrolled. 
The n umber of qualified anesthesia clinicians varies  across  the sites. We estimate about 20-
200 per site. There is  no maximal allowed participating anesthesia clinicians at each  site.   
 
3.4 Study Population 
 
3.4.1 Inclusion Criteria  
1) Males or females age 0 to <12 months.   
2) Scheduled for non- cardiac surgery  or procedure last ing longer than 30 minutes under 
general anesthesia where  oral endotracheal intubation will be performed by [CONTACT_65422].  
3) Parental/guardian permission (informed consent). 
   
   6 
 
For clinician participants:  
1) Anesthesia attending, anesthesia fellows, or anesthesia resident  
  
3.4.2 Exclusion Criteria  
1) History of difficult intubation  
2) History with abnormal airway  
3) Predictive of difficult intubation  upon physical examination  
4) Parents/guardians who, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], may  be unable to understand 
or give informed consent 
 
Subjects that do not meet all of the enrollment criteria may not be enrolled. Any violations of these criteria must be reported in accordance with IRB Policies and Procedures.  
 
[ADDRESS_71234]’s parent(s) or guardian(s) will be approached by [CONTACT_65423]/or 
study staff prior to surgery. Parent(s) or guardian(s) will be provided a written 
informed  consent before any study spe cific procedures are performed . Following 
activities will be conducted at this visit: 
• Medical Record Review  
• Informed Consent 
• Data collection  
 
4.2 Study Procedure  
4.2.1 Clinician qualification:  
Since the study procedure is standard c linical care at all centers, anyone who is 
licensed to perform the tracheal intubation at the participating center is allowed to 
conduct the intubation on the subjects. The se clinicians include attending 
anesthesiologists, anesthesia fellow s, or anesthesia resident s.    
 
All clinicians who are caring for a VISI trial patient will be consented . In clinical 
emergency situations , the attending anesthesiologist may request subsequent 
intubation attempts assistance from an other attending anesthesiologists  who may not 
be consented. This will not be considered as protocol violation nor deviation. We 
will request consent from these clinicians after the intubation. If they decline 
consent, none of their study information will be collected. No study procedure will 
be performed till consent is obtained.     
   
   7 
4.2.2 Randomization:  
To ensure balance in treatment assignment, a permuted -block randomization 
approach will be applied. The block size will be varying (among 2, 4, 6) to avoid the 
predictability of device assignment. To further balance device assignment against 
potential predictors on the outcome, we’ll stratify the randomization by [CONTACT_3885] (5 -
10 sites) and clinician’s  experience (anesthesia attending, anesthesia fellow & 
anesthesia resident). There will be 15 -30 (Site number*3) strata in t otal. Separate 
randomization schedule will be generated for each stratum.  
 
Randomization will be conducted through the study REDCap EDC after the consent 
is obtained. T he subject is required to be registered in REDCap via a computer or 
mobile device per in stitutional policy prior to randomization. To avoid protocol 
deviation, only eligible subjects and study allowed anesthesia clinician s are able to 
be randomized in REDCap by a designated site study staff. Then the clinician will be 
notified of the randomiz ed device.  
 
4.2.3 Intubation:  
Anesthesia induction will be left to the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist per institution standard practice. However, it’s strongly recommended  that all 
subjects should receive a neuromuscular blocking drug and confirmed train of four ≤ 1 twitch at the adductor pollicis muscle prior to attempting intubation. It’s strongly 
recommended  that the use of a malleable stylet for all intubations and use usual 
cuffed tracheal tubes per institutional standard  of care. It’s strongl y recommend to 
follow below guidelines:  
• ID 3.0mm cuffed (birth to < 1 month; >3kg body weight);  
• ID 3.5mm cuffed (1 month to < 8 months);  
• ID 4.0mm cuffed (8 to 12 months).   
 If the first attempt at tracheal intubation attempt fails , the device used for subsequent 
attempts will be at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist.   A member of the research staff  is required to observe the intubation and record the 
study information. 
 
4.2.4 Follow- Up (Post intubation chart review)  
Subject records will be reviewed up to 24 hours after intubation or upon discharge from PACU for intubation related AEs  
 
The following data elements will be collected :  
   
   8 
• Demographics including MRN, name, gender, weight, and elements of dates 
including date of birth et al 
• Birth history including post menstrual age et al  
• Medical history and surgical history including diagnosis and any other intubation history et al 
• Physical exam including ASA physical status and airway abnormality et al  
• Surgical information inclu ding procedure date, type of surgical procedure, surgery 
length et al.  
• Anesthesia records including number of TI attempts, oxygen saturation, TI device used, clinician’s name s, medications, and associated complications et al  
• Subject records will be review ed up to [ADDRESS_71235] Completion/Withdrawal  
The subject  may be discontinued from the study procedure at the discretion of the 
Investigator due to AEs  or to protect the subject for reasons of safety or for administrative 
reasons.  It will be documented whether or not each subject completes the clinical study. If 
the Investigator becomes aware of any serious, related adverse events after the subject 
completes or withdraws from the study, they will be recorded and reported to institutional 
IRB.  
 Clinician participates maybe withdraw from participating in the study at the first intubation  
attempt. If this occurs, their names will removed from the eligible clinicians list in REDCap.  
 
4.3.[ADDRESS_71236] withdraws prior to being intubated, no further data 
will be collected and no study procedure will be performed.

intubation will b e recorded on the study Case Report Form (CRF) .  
 
[ADDRESS_71239]-attempt success of intubation will be coded as a dichotomous variable 
(success=1, nonsuccess=0). As a comparative effectiveness study, the treatment procedure 
will be ra ndomly assigned to participants after consent is obtained in a two- arm, parallel 
design. If warranted, we will use a logistic regression model in the mixed model framework 
to allow for the inclusion of multi- level effects for individuals nested within site s and site-
specific effects such as staffing, caseload, experience of staff, etc. In this analysis , we can 
address  systematic effects that possibly lead to different success rates between sites , and/or 
clinicians, without compromising the integrity of the randomization procedure. Although the 
main interest is in successful intubation, secondary aims can also be investigated through the logistic regression mixed models approach.

summaries (e.g. means and standard deviations for continuous variables such as age and percentages for categorical variables such as gender).  To test the difference of demographic 
variables between treatment groups, student’s t- test or Wilcoxon test will be used for 
continuous variables, while Chi- square test, or Fisher’s exact test will be used for categorical 
variables.  Comparisons of demographic characteristics between the sites will be 
accomplished by [CONTACT_65424] (i.e., Cohen’s d, phi-coefficient, odds ratios) between each site as a descriptive analysis of differences at baseline.  
 
6.3.2 Statistical Analysis  
The study is powered for the primary outcome: successful tracheal intubation on first 
attempt.  Assuming that a 10% increase in successful tracheal intubation (i.e., intubation on 
first attempt) is clinically meaningful, and that a reasonable rate for baseline suc cess is 
(84%) ( Based  on our single center data) an overall sample size of 540 randomly assigned to 
VL or DL, will provide approximately 80 % power at the nominal two sided 5% level of 
significance.  This calculation accounts for approximately 10% withdrawal, dropout, 
missing data and other data quality issues. We assume the success rate will be similar across 
sites.  The statistical package SAS’s module: PROC SEQDESIGN, was used for the sample size determination.  The order of assignment of intubation method (VL vs. DL) for patients intubated by [CONTACT_65425] 2, [ADDRESS_71241] for clinician- level 
clustering of outcome variable, we will apply generalized estimating equations (GEE) method to the logistic regression model to get the marginal odds ratio for first- attempt 
success comparing VL and DL. . We will include the  patient characteristics: ASA status, 
thyromental distance and weight (less than 10kg, & more than 10kg) as covariates in  the 
logistic regression  model . Since there will be an interim analysis the p -value is considered 
significant if it is less than 0.029 to maintain the overall significance level of the study (Type 
I error rate) at 0.[ADDRESS_71242] modification we will include class of clinician s with intervention (DL vs 
VL) as an interaction term in the logistic regression. In addition, we will analyze the number (not dichotomizing) of intubation attempts using a generalized linear model with the 
negative binomial distribution . Difference in complications, such as lowest oxygen 
saturation during tracheal, between  treatment  groups will be analyzed  in multivariate linear 
models or generalized linear models as appropriate. G eneral linear mod els and GEE

The primary efficacy endpoint will be a successful tracheal intubation following the 
procedure. We will consider a 10% improvement between VL compared to DL to be 
indicative of a significant clinical effect. The statistical analysis of this change will be based on a logistic regression model where an odds ratio greater than 2.98 will be considered 
evidence of efficacy of VL compared to DL. Marginal o dds ratios with 95% confidence 
intervals will be reported  for the sample overall, as well as each site,  if appropriate.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_71244] tracheal intubation  in children < [ADDRESS_71245]- attempt success rate will not be different between VL and DL for children < [ADDRESS_71246]- attempt success rate will be different 
between VL and DL for children < 12 month. The mathematical formula are: 
H
0: pVL = p DL 
H1: pVL≠ pDL 
An interim analysis will be done, and Pocock’s method will be used to adjust for this 2- stage 
sequential analysis. According to CHOP ’s recordings, first tracheal intubation success 
proportion was 84% for DL, and we expect a difference in the success proportion of 10% to 
be clinically meaningful. Using SAS PROC SEQDESIGN procedure, a sample size of 167 
per treatment group (334 in total) will provide approximately 80% power at the nominal two 
sided 5% level of significance. To adjust for 10% extra protocol devi ation, the sample size 
adds up to 186 per treatment group (372 in total). 
 We’re also aware that the outcome variable will be clustering on each physician since 
different physician perform differently in tracheal intubation. The following inflation factor 
formula will be used to adjust for this clustering:  
DE=1+(m -1)*𝜌𝜌 
[ADDRESS_71247], m stands for the average clustering size, and 𝜌𝜌 stands for 
intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC).  Since there is no reported ICC of the tracheal  
intubation success rate among clinicians, we assume it to be 0.05, which means 5% of the variance in success rate is explained by [CONTACT_65426]. We also assume that every clinician will intubate 10 patients on average in the current stu dy. Thus, the 
   
   12 
inflation factor is 1.45. Thus, the sample size is inflated to 270 per treatment group (540 in 
total).  
 
6.[ADDRESS_71248] attempt will be compared for VL and DL 
using logistic regression with alpha = 0.029 for significance.  This more stringent criteria for 
significance (0.029 instead of 0.05) is Pocock’s method of correction for m aintaining overall 
study significance level at .05 when there is one interim analysis . We will include  ASA 
status, thyromental distance and weight less than 10kg as covariates  in the logistic 
regression . The probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_65414] (mid -point) is 46.4%, if the 
true improvement in intubation first attempt success rate is 10.0% (i.e.  84% true first 
attempt success rate for DL vs. 94% true success rate for VL). However, if the true improvement in first attempt intubation success rate is 12.0% (i.e. 84% vs 96% for DL and VL respectively), then the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_30493] 83.0%.

10.1.1 Risk Assessment  
Both devices are approved and used in accordance with their labeling, both approaches are 
currently used as part of routine clinical care at the institution; experienced clinicians will 
oversee the procedure and the protocol allows for cross-overs. The main risk of the study is 
due to randomization (to an intubation approach the subjects may not have undergone if their clinician had made the decision). Additionally VL may take longer  however t his has 
been shown to be clinically insignificant in all studies. The risks are no greater than 
minimal.

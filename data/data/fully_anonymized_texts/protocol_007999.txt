 1 PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
1.1 SYNOPSIS   
Title:  Automated Reinforcement Management System (ARMS)   
Grant Number:  R41 AA0267993   
Study Description:    
Alcohol abuse remains a significant cause of preventable morbidity 
and mortality in the US , yet only 15% of those with alcohol use 
disorders receive treatment. Contingency Management (CM) is a 
cost-effective intervention for drug addiction where individuals are 
rewarded when they submit biological verification of drug abstinence. 
We propose to develop an integrated CM system capable of 
incorporating mobile device input and Electronic Medical Record 
(EMR) integration , that would allow us to deliver a CM intervention 
for problematic drinking to anyone who owns a sm artphone. The 
mobile device input will incorporate ecological momentary 
assessments (EMA), geospatial mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and biomarker -based 
feedback from a portable measuring device. This novel approach will 
enable personalized CM goal setting and a new platform fo r clinician 
feedback and progress monitoring. The goal of the system will be to 
provide an end -to-end CM platform, which can aggregate and inform 
the understanding of mechanisms underlying the initiation, 
maintenance, and recovery from problematic drinking  in both 
treatment and naturalistic settings with little to no required clinician 
involvement.  
Objectives*: 
 Primary Objective:  To develop a nd  combine  mobile technology, 
geospatial mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and biomarker measurement, with individual 
goal setting and EMA feedback to launch behavioral modification 
strategies and progress monitoring.  
Secondary Objectives:  To develop and consumer -test the mobile 
application component to help the patient alcohol -related treatment 
goals at home.

 2  INTRODUCTION  
2.1 STUDY R ATIONALE   
Alcohol abuse remains a significant cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the US , yet only 15% of 
those with alcohol use disorders receive treatment. Contingency Management (CM) is a cost -effective 
intervention for drug addiction where individuals are rewarded when they submit biological verification of drug 
abstinence.1-[ADDRESS_948581] (EMR) integration, that would allow us to deliver a CM intervention for 
problematic drinking to anyone who owns a smartphone. The mobil e device input will incorporate ecological 
momentary assessments (EMA), geospatial mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and biomarker -based  feedback from a portable 
measuring device. This novel approach will enable personalized CM goal setting and a new platform for 
clinician feedbac k and progress monitoring. The goal of the system will be to provide an end -to-end CM 
platform, which can aggregate and inform the understanding of mechanisms underlying the initiation, 
maintenance, and recovery from problematic drinking in both treatment and naturalistic settings with little to 
no required clinician involvement.  
2.2 BACKGROUND   
In a recently completed randomized controlled trial (RCT; n=79) we used ethyl glucuronide (EtG), a urine -
based  biomarker capable of detecting heavy drinking for up to five days, as the basis for a CM intervention 
for alcohol  use disorders in outpatients who suffered from comorbid mental illness (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_698656], Co -I: 
McPherson; Am J  Psychiatry). We found that participants randomized to CM were 3.13 times more likely 
than controls  CI=2.18 -4.50, p<0.01) to submit alcohol -negative urine samples during the 12 -week treatment 
period . They  also achieved longer duration of alcohol abstinence: 2.9 weeks (SD=3.30) versus 1.4 weeks in 
the control  group (SD=2.10; p<.02). The CM group also had significantly :  
1) lower average EtG levels,  
2) fewer days of any  drinking or heavy drinking during treatment, and  
3) fewer days of drinking during the [ADDRESS_948582] an alcohol use 
disorder . 
 
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT   
2.3.1  KNOWN  POTENTIAL RISKS  
The risk to patients from digital intervention is negligible. However, as in all trials of this nature, there is the 
possibility of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information; discomfort, or embarrassment related to 
biologic sample collection or a dministration of questionnaires or assessments dealing with sensitive 
information. There may be unforeseen and unpreventable risks to participants of encountering friends or 
associates at the research laboratory study visits. These are acknowledged and wil l be reduced as much as 
possible.  
 
Automated Reinforcement Management System (ARMS)                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_948583] as possible.  
Questions about the participant's habits and history may make them feel uncomfortable. There may be 
discomfort, social stigmatization, or embarrassment related to giving a urine sample or being seen at the 
research lab. Our research team will take the utmo st caution to avoid creating distress, stigmatization, 
offending, or degrading participants and their families.  
 
We anticipate that the intervention will lower the average alcohol levels, reduce the number of days of any 
drinking or heavy drinking during treatment, and decrease the number of days  of drinking during the study.   
 
3 OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS

Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_948584] design with the intent of recruiting twenty  (n=20) 
total participants. During the first A phase, participants will receive reinforcement for simply submitting breath 
samples three times per day between [ADDRESS_948585] 
with any alcohol monitoring device, such as B ACtrack Skyn. During the B phase, the delivery of reinforcers 
will be contingent upon the submission of an alcohol negative breath sample  on an escalating schedule. The 
second A phase  (i.e., return to the baseline phase ) will involve the delivery of reinforcers for simply submitting 
a sample during the designated windows of time. We will also collect EMA data on stress, anxiety, depression,  
and other brief measures daily through their smartphone. Each phase will last a total of four weeks (i.e., two 
weeks of the first A phase, four weeks of the B phase, and then two more weeks of the A -phase) each for a 
total of [ADDRESS_948586] area  in cooperation with the Community Health 
Association of Spokane (CHAS) and other outpatient entities, community recruitment, etc. under the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_698657] 
(APPL) . 
 
We will recruit n=[ADDRESS_948587] information for technical 
support to be used during the study.   
 
During the A -B-A phase (2 -4-2 weeks) , participants will be asked to submit thee breath samples daily for 8 
weeks. They will also be  asked to  fill out a weekly timeline follow back for alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis use 
during that period. At the end of the 8 weeks participation period, participants will bring back the phone and 
fill out the exit questionnaire.

assigned to the study intervention or entered in the study. Individuals who do not meet the criteria for 
participation in this trial (screen failure) because of meeting one or more exclusion criteria that are likely to 
chang e over time may be rescreened. Examples include the successful treatment of a previous affective  
DSM -[ADDRESS_948589] 12 months and expression of 
concern by [CONTACT_698675].  Rescreened participants will be assigned the same 
participant number as for the initial screening.  
5.5 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  
We anticipate a 5 -month recruitment period, necessitating n=4 recruited per month which is far below our 
normal recruitment rates. Flyers will advertise the study, and staff and providers will be aware of the study 
and will be asked to refer potentially in terested participants to our investigation. As noted elsewhere, while 
Automated Reinforcement Management System (ARMS)                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_948590] a compatible  iPhone Operating System  (iOS) smart phone will be provided one 
for this study. The phones will be supplied from a testing inventory maintained by [CONTACT_698676].  
Participant set -up instructions will also describe the time window for reporting  the definition of zones of use 
and will be provided contact [CONTACT_698677].  During the baseline 
visit participants will receive a $ [ADDRESS_948591] A phase, participants will receive $2 per sample (regardless of being positive or negative for 
breath alcohol) submitted instantly , for a maximum payout of $6 per day.  
During the B phase, participants will begin by [CONTACT_26777] $2 per alcohol negative breath sample submitted, 
escalating by $0.25 per alcohol negative breath sample submission until a maximum value of $3.50 per 
sample is reached. Once this value is reached based on negative breath sample submissions, participants 
will cont inue to receive $3.50 per alcohol -negative breath sample submission. If a participant submits an 
alcohol positive breath sample, they will be reset to $2.00 per sample and will need to work up to receive 
$3.50 per sample again. Final onetime payment of $ [ADDRESS_948592] weekly.  
6 STUDY INTERVENTION(S) OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION(S)  
We will use the first A phase of data collection to define personalized 'cold' (i.e., lower than 50% probability 
of drinking) and 'hot' (i.e. greater than 50% probability of drinking) spots using the participant's geospatial 
location data (via smartphone). As part of  this CM system, participants will have the capability to receive 
multi -modal message reminders when they enter a new window of needed biochemical sample submission 
and additional reminders when the window of sample submission is about to close. While part icipants will 
receive information messages to this effect during the A phase, participants will receive additional 
personalized multi -modal message reminders once our CM platform can detect that they have entered a cold 
or hot zone. This will be based on t he participant entering a 2/10s (i.e., approximately 1,000 feet) of a mile 
radius near a cold or hot zone. For example, upon entering a hot zone radius during the B phase wherein 
they had 50% or greater likelihood of drinking in that zone during the A phas e, they will receive a text message 
encouraging them to change surroundings in order better promote abstinence. Also, if the participant is within 
a window of time where they are eligible to submit a sample and receive a dose of reinforcement, this is 
another action that the individual can take to help bolster their attempt to remain abstinent. All of these data 
(e.g., biochemical results, location of sample submission, time of submission) will be warehoused in the 
individual's EMR to be presented in summar y form on their primary care provider's dashboard. This will help 
the provider give counsel or otherwise devise an action plan if the patient's drinking behavior is proving 
impervious to intervention or if the patient's goals are being met, this is somethi ng the provider can encourage.

 7 STUDY INTERVENTION /EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  DISCONTINUATION  AND PARTICIPANT  
DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL  
7.1 PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY  
Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon  their request.  
An investigator may discontinue a participant from the study for the following reasons:  
• Significant study intervention non-compliance unless  varying compliance is an aspect of the study 
objectives.  
• Lost-to-follow up; unable to contact [CONTACT_1130].  
• Any event , medical condition or situation occurs such that continued collection of follow -up study data 
would not be in the best interest of the participant or might require an additional treatment that would 
confound the interpretation of the study.  
• The participant meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously recognized) that 
precludes further study participation.  
 
The reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be recorded on REDCap .  
In this situation , participants will be asked to bring back the phone, fill out the exit questionnaire and received  
a $[ADDRESS_948593] be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit:  
 
• The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_2299], reschedule the missed visit, counsel the participant on 
the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain if the participant wishes to 
and/or should continue in the study.  
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will make every effort to 
regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter 
to the participant’s last known mailing ad dress or local equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_334768]’s study file.  
• Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have withdrawn from 
the study with a primary reason for loss to follow -up. 
• Study phone provided at baseline will be disable remotely.

Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_948594]. Research staff will also use this interview to assess for possible exclusionary cognitive or psychotic 
disorders using the MINI Neuropsychiat ric Interview (M .I.N.I.). At baseline data collection, potential 
participants will complete a medical history form.  
 
Secondary outcomes will include self -reported alcohol use measured by [CONTACT_698678] -modal EMA data collection. The Addiction Severity Index 
and the quality of life in several domains  (e.g., psychiatric, legal, medical) will be assessed at baseline. The 
EMA application will also collect data to assess craving and withdrawal for alcohol and tobacco by [CONTACT_2329] a [ADDRESS_948595] to measure the severity of alcohol use disorder.

8.2 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
Qualified personnel will perform the study according to the WSU IRB -approved application.  
The equipment, facilities, and procedures to be used in this research meet recognized standards for safety.  
We will assess participants alcohol use three  times daily through t he Automated  Reinforcement  Management 
System (A RMS) which  will provide the following functions: Breathalyzer recording , EMA responses , and 
eventually geospatial mappi[INVESTIGATOR_698658] , and a Clinician Dashboard. The participant  will be 
provided with a B ACtrack breathalyzer device. The setup process will pair their phone with the breathalyzer 
device and establish a profile including locations and time of day for reporting.   
The mobile application will provide the pa rticipant  user with the ability to input EMA information and control 
the breathalyzer function. It will utilize a hybrid iOS/mobile web application architecture  for phase [ADDRESS_948596] EMA and breathalyzer samples based on the ir profile information and 
prior reporting. During a reporting window, the pa rticipant  will receive a promp t to initiate breathalyzer 
measurement within the  thirty (30) minute  time window . The application will automatically record the location 
of the breathalyzer sample and categorize it as a "hot" or "non -hot" zone  for future analysis . Following the 
breathalyzer report, the pa rticipant  will be prompted to respond to EMA questions. Following the data entry, 
the pa rticipant  will receive a multimedia message describing their progress and sample tailored messaging 
offering resources for additional information.  
To support compliance, if a pa rticipant  does not record substance use in real -time and does not respond to 
the daily check -in, the system will send reminders. The reminders are multi -modal as they can reach the user 
through different means based on user preference. For the study , we will rely on application delivered PUSH 
messages for the assigned smartphones with text message back up and the option for voice calls from 
Research Coordinator.  
If the pa rticipant  does not respond to the application and does not respond to reminders, their name [CONTACT_698695]. The research coordinator could place a personal 
call to the pa rticipant  to follow up.   
The application provides a dashboard for each patient to show how the EMA answers are related to  
substance use outcomes. It informs the patient of progress toward CM rewards and provides suggestions 
regarding which factors are most likely to be associated with craving and substance use.   
Responses to EMA -assessed factors will provide the basis for creating a menu of customizable strategies to 
improve goal adherence for individuals and/or modify incentives. Certain patterns of responses will trigger 
the app to employ specific strategies to help the pa rticipant  achieve his goal.

 All AEs, whether volunteered, elicited, or noted on physical examination, will be recorded throughout the 
study (i.e., from signing of the ICF until completion).  
All AEs will be collected in a proper case  report form and recorded in REDCap.  
8.3.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life -threatening adverse event, 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of e xisting hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a persistent or significant 
incapacity/substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth 
defect .  
Important medical events that may not result in death, though life -threatening or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34502], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardize the life or require 
medical or surgical intervention to preve nt one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse. SAEs are life -threatening adverse events or life -threatening suspected 
adverse reactions. An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered "life -threatening" if, in the 
view of either the inv estigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient at immediate risk of death. It does 
not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death.  
8.3.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
 
Each AE will be assigned a category by [CONTACT_73951]:  
Mild: An AE that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], require minimal or no treatment and does not interfere 
with the participant’s daily activities.  
 
Moderate: An AE that results in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. 
Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning. Intervention may be needed.  
 
Severe: An AE that prevents everyday activities and may require systemic drug therapy or other treatment. 
Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or incapacitating.  
If there is a change in the severity of an AE, it must be recorded as a separate event.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION /EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  
The investigator will make every effort to assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the study intervention. 
The investigator should use their knowledge of the subject, the circumstances surrounding the event, and 
Automated Reinforcement Management System (ARMS)

 an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether an AE is related to the study 
treatment. Causality should be assessed using the categories presented below:  
Related: The AE is known to occur with the study intervention, there is a reasonable possibility that the 
study intervention caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study intervention and 
event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evid ence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
study intervention and the AE.  
Not Related: There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study intervention caused 
the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention and event onset, or an alternate 
etiology has been established.  
 
Action Taken  
The investigator will describe the action taken in the proper section  of the CRF, as follows:  
- None  
- Study procedure or the medication stopped  
- Study medication temporarily interrupted  
- Concomitant medication  
- Other, specify.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS   
A provider  with expertise  in alcohol withdrawal syndrome  will be responsible for determining whether an 
adverse event (AE) is expected or unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, 
or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study 
procedures . 
8.3.[ADDRESS_948598] events with start dates occurring any time after informed consent is obtained 
until seven  (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation. At each study 
visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit. Events will be followed 
for outcome information until resolutio n or stabilization . 
  
8.3.[ADDRESS_948599] report to the IRB as soon as possible, but in all cases within seven (7) working days after 
the reportable event had been made known to the investigator . All AEs occurring during the study must be 
documented on the relevant CRF pages.  The following information should be documented for each AE:  
- Description of the symptom  event  
- Classification of ‘’serious ’’ or ‘’not serious’’  
- Severity  
- Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable)  
- Action was taken  
- Causal relationship  
- The outcome of the event (unknown, recovered, not yet recovered, recovered with sequelae, death)

by [CONTACT_093] (or appropriately qualified designee), and emailed or faxed to medical monitor within [ADDRESS_948601] of all enrolled subjects. This excludes all pa tients  who failed the screening for this 
study or those who are eligible but uninterested in study participation.  
 
9.3 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
9.3.1  GENERAL APPROACH  
Raw data will be entered directly into the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system on a secure 
server by [CONTACT_698679].  
 
First, we will perform generalized estimating equations  for the repeated binary outcome  of alcohol abstinence. 
This model  will include the variables of 1) Time ( individually varying  timestamp from when the breath sample 
was submitted) and  2) Phase (A, B, A).   
Second , we will analyze the outcome  of 1) self-reported heavy drinking days (4+ standard drinks per drinking 
day for women, 5+ standard drinks per drinking day for men) , 2) self -reported craving, and 3) self -reported 
craving, all over time.  
   
9.3.2  ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT(S)  
Our primary outcome is biochemically confirmed alcohol abstinence, measured thrice daily throughout the [ADDRESS_948602].27  Research staff will also use this interview to assess for possible exclusionary cognitive or 
psychotic disorders using the MINI Neuropsychiatric Interview (M .I.N.I.). This variable will be analyzed as a 
repeated dichotomous variable.   
Automated Reinforcement Management System (ARMS)                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_948603] been established by [CONTACT_595839].20,22,24,38 -43  Our approach emphasizes 1) either 
maximum likelihood or multiple imputations, and 2) extensive sensitivity analyses, including missing not at 
random approaches, to examine the robustness of treatment effects across varying assumptions. Maximum 
likelihood and multiple imputations have both shown exceptional performance compared to other, more 
common methods of handling missing data when the assumption of "missing at random" can be safely 
satisfied.39      
9.3.3  ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S)  
Secondary outcomes will include mobile usage, EMA bout completions , and  self-reported alcohol use 
measured by [CONTACT_698680]  28  to assess  the frequency and amount of daily drinking  via multi -
modal EMA data collection  by [CONTACT_5586], date and location . The Addiction Severity  Index and quality of life in 
several domains (e.g., psychiatric, legal, medical)  will be assessed at baseline .  
9.3.4  SAFETY ANALYSES  
Medical coding will use MedDRA for the concomitant diseases (Medical History) and AEs and  the World 
Health Organization  (WHO ) Drug Dictionary for medications.  
Each AE will be counted once only for a given participant. The AEs expectedness, severity, frequency, and 
their relationship to the study intervention will be presented by [CONTACT_1196] (SOC) and preferred 
term groupi[INVESTIGATOR_14839].  Adverse events leading to premature discontinuation from the study intervention and serious 
treatment -emergent AEs will be presented either in a table or a listing . 
 
9.3.5  BASELINE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS  
We will initially run descriptive statistics across baseline variables to characterize the sample. All inferential 
results will be presented as point estimates with 95% confidence intervals, and we will use an alpha error 
rate of 0.05 as the threshold for statistical significance . Our approach is consistent with that of several similar 
RCTs involving tobacco smoking and alcohol use disorders .12,13,24,34 -37

2- Web-based consent with an electronic signature  
3- HIPAA Authorization form 
   
[IP_ADDRESS]  CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION  
The consenting process will be conducted consistently for every participant.  
If a participant is eligible, the iPad that was used for screening will display the consent form.  The research 
assistant ( RA) or research coordinator ( RC) will explain that this document will explain the details of the 
study they are being asked to take part in. Allow the participant plenty of time to read . 
When the participant is done reading the consent, they will be asked if they have any questions about the 
study. If the answer to  a question is not immediately obvious, the research coordinator or an investigator 
will be asked for their opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649] , which must also be documented. The consent form will then be thoroughly 
reviewed to ensure that the participant understands what they are agreeing to.  
Eligibility for the study is determined by [CONTACT_57219]. Signing the consent does not ensure eligibility to 
participate. That said, it will be made clear to the prospective participant that participation will not impact 
their care.  
The key point to stress in the consenting process is that PARTICIPATION IS  VOLUNTARY. Participants 
can choose not to consent to the study or discontinue at any time for any reason. They can choose not to 
answer any questions that make them feel uncomfortable.  
The RA/RC will s how the participant where to type their name [CONTACT_698696]. The participant 
must date and place their signature [CONTACT_698697] . The RA/RC will give  a paper copy of the consent 
to the participant for their records.  
Remember that consenting is an ongoing process.  
 
10.1.2  STUDY DISCONTINUATION AND CLOSURE  
This study may be suspended  or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable cause. Written 
notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be provided by [CONTACT_206092],  
or terminating party to study participants, investigators, funding agencies, and regulatory authorities. If the 
study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Principal Investigator (PI) will promptly inform study 
participants, the Institutional Review  Board (IRB), and sponsor/funding agency and will provide the reason(s)  
for the termination or suspension. Study participants will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], as applicable, and be informed of 
changes to the study visit schedule.  
 
Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to:  
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants . 
• Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] . 
• Insufficient compliance with protocol requirements . 
• Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable . 
• The determination that the primary endpoint has been met . 
• Determination of futility .

Protocol Version 1.[ADDRESS_948606] participant privacy. The consent process, administration 
of questionnaires, assessment and biologic sampling, medication dispensing, and CM draws will occur in a 
restricted area . To reduce the risk of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information all personal 
identifiers will be kept separate from participant files and a study -specific research identification number (key) 
will be assigned to each participant. Data will be col lected, entered, and ac cessed by [CONTACT_698681]. The key will be kept separate and not  in the 
same enclave component of  the network. Data will be entered into a password -protected database that is 
encrypted and firewalled. All information provided by [CONTACT_698682]. In that case, the Investigator would 
release information to keep the participan t or another person safe. If the i nvestigator learns about abuse to 
a child or an elder, that information must be reported to the proper authorities.  
10.1.4  FUTURE USE OF STORED SPECIMENS  AND DATA   
No specimen s will be stored for this study.  All paper records be shredded, physical tapes are erased, and 
physically destroyed, and electronic media be scrubbed after the files are deleted. (Entirely de -identified 
data where all links to individual identity including any information that could identify p articipants will be 
retained.) See: WSU BPPM 90.01 - https://policies.wsu.edu/prf/index/manuals/90 -00-records/[ADDRESS_948607] -records/  
All research materials (consent forms, surveys, digital) will be kept for a minimum of three years after 
completion of the study. See: WSU BPPM 90.01 - https://policies.wsu.edu/prf/index/manuals/90 -00-

[IP_ADDRESS]  DATA COLLECTION AND  MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES  
Washington State University will oversee  activities with the data management of this study. This includes  
setting up a relevant database and data transfer mechanism, along with the proper validation  of data and 
resolution of queries.  
Study data will be collected directly at the study site into REDCap. Any data recorded directly on REDCap 
should be considered as a source document. Any changes in the data entered REDCap will be recorded 
and available for audit by [CONTACT_698684] (FDA) (CFR 21 part 11 compliant). Medical 
coding will use MedDRA for the concomitant diseases (Medical History) and AEs and  the World Health 
Organization  (WHO ) Drug Dictionary for medications. Missing or inconsistent data will be queried within th e 
REDCap system in writing to the Investigator for clarification. Any modification of the database will be 
documented.

NIH Clinical Trial Protocol

 10.1.8  PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS   
This protocol defines a protocol deviation as any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol, International 
Council on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP). Noncompliance may be either on the part of 
the participant, the investigator, or the study site staff. As a result of deviations, corrective actions will be 
developed by [CONTACT_3483].  
 
These practices are consistent with ICH GCP:  
• Section 4.5 Compliance with Protocol, subsections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3  
• Section 5.1 Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control, subsection 5.1.1  
• Section 5.[ADDRESS_948615] of a  
research participant will cause a deviation from an IRB approved protocol. The cause may be  
emergent (e.g. like present concerns involving the potential spread of a disease) or non -emergent  
(a chance occurrence). Potential issues that may be met in emergent situations include  
but are not limited to insufficient staff to conduct safely/effectively research or the research  
location becomes unsafe for the participants.  Regardless of the cause, the IRB expectation is the same: 
always act (using your best  judgment) to avoid unnecessary harm to research participants and staff. If  
doing so causes (or will cause) a deviation from the approved protocol, the following actions  
are recommended:  
1.  If deviation  from the protocol is expected and became necessary and the investigators have  time to 
submit an amendment to the IRB to address the expected  deviation, they should  do 
so. The IRB office will expedite the review of amendments intended to minimize (or  
decrease) risks to subjects.  
2.  If deviation from the protocol  is expected  but the investigators do not have time to submit  
the amendment, they should consider at least informing the IRB (phone or e -mail) that they anticipate  
they will need to deviate from the protocol. The IRB can provide guidance and  
document that notification was made in advance of the deviation and a reporting form  
can be submitted later (as soon as practicable).  
3. If a deviation is required to avoid harming a participant and there is insufficient time to  
either submit an amendment or inform the IRB via other means, the expectation of the  
IRB is that the investigator  will report the deviation as soon as it is practicable.  
4.  If deviation is  expected to repeat, the IRB office will work  
with them to determine the best approach (including potentially amending your protocol)  
to address these potential exceptions.  
5. Deviations from a protocol that are made, in good faith, solely for  protecting research participants or 
others will rarely be considered non -compliance (e.g.  only if the above guidance is not followed), these 
deviations will be classified as  exceptions and the IRB office will collaborate with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_698661]/deviation.  
 
To simplify this process, the IR B /HRPP ( Human Research Protection Program)  has implemented a new 
consolidated  IRB reporting . The form  that can be used to report any  protocol related event including 
Automated Reinforcement Management System (ARMS)

 deviations, exceptions,  adverse events and UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865] (unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects 
and others).  This form can be used to report any type of event, even if you are unsure how to classify the  
event, simply describe the event and IRB staff will assist you in classifying and handling of the  
event. To access the reporting form, please go to http://irb.wsu.edu/forms.asp  and select the "IRB

Revised - 06/02/99 DC/TRJ  CONFIDENCE RATINGS: ⇒ Last two items in each section.  
⇒ Do not over interpret.  
⇒ Denial does not warrant 
misrepresentation.  
⇒ Misrepresentation = overt contradiction in 
information.  
Probe and make plenty of comments!  If a question asks the number of months, 
round up periods of 14 days or more to 1 
month. Round up 6 months or more to 1 
year.  HALF TIME RULE:  INTERVIEWER INSTRUCTIONS:  
1. Leave no  blanks.  
2. Make plenty of Comments (if another person reads this ASI, they s hould 
have a relatively complete pi[INVESTIGATOR_698669]'s perceptions ofhis/her 
problems).  
3.X = Question not answered. 
N = Question not applicable.  
4.Terminate interview if client misrepresents two or more sections. 
5.When noting comments, please write the  question number.  
6.Tutorial/clarification notes are preceded with " •". ALCOHOL/DRUG USE INSTRUCTIONS:  
The following questions look at two time periods: the past [ADDRESS_948634] 30 days. However if th e client has been 
incarcerated for more than 1 year, you would only gather lifetime information, unless 
the client admits to significant alcohol /drug use during incarceration. This guideline 
only applies to the Alcohol/Drug Section.  
⇒30 day questions only  require the number of days used.  
⇒Lifetime use is asked to determine extended periods of use.  
⇒Regular use = 3+ times per week, binges, or problematic irregular use 
in which normal activities are compromised.  
⇒Alcohol to intoxication does not necessarily mean "drunk", use the 
words felt the effects", “got a buzz”, “high”, etc. instead of intoxicatio n. 
As a rule of thumb, 5+ drinks in one setting, or within a brief period of 
time defines “intoxication".  
⇒ “How to ask these questions:  
→ "How many days in the past [ADDRESS_948635] you used....?  
→ "How many years in your life have you regularly used....?"  LIST OF COMMONLY USED DRUGS:

                                                                                                                                                                                Version 0.[ADDRESS_948648].  
 
What is the purpose of this study?  
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a phone application when 
paired with a behavioral method in increasing alcohol abstinence. This behavioral 
approach, known as contingency management, means that a person is rewarded for not 
using alcohol or reducing their alcohol use. In this study, we will ask you to provide urine 
and breath samples at study visits to assess whether you are drinking. The breath 
sample measures recent alcohol use. We will ask you to fill out questionnaires during  
the study.  
 
You are being asked to take part because during our screening interview you indicated 
that you are between [ADDRESS_948649] a psychotic disorder or severe 
alcohol use disorder, or if the researchers determine that your safety may be in danger.  
 
What will I be asked to do if I am in this study?  
If you take part in the study, you will be asked to do the following:  
• Complete the baseline interview after you fill out this consent form. This will take 
about [ADDRESS_948650], ethyl glucuronide (EtG), will be used to detect 
the pre sence of alcohol. We will ask that you supply about half a cup of urine into 
a cup. The sample will be labeled with a unique study ID number to protect your 
privacy and we will evaluate your urine at our lab. Providing samples is a 
condition of taking part  in the study.  
You will be asked to sign a release of health information that allows us to get 
information about your substance use. The locations of frequently used 
resources, and your physical and mental health. You will be asked to fill out 
questionnaires about your a lcohol, tobacco, and drug use.  
You will be provided with instruction on the phone application and how to use the 
breathalyzer. The application works only on iPhone 7 or newer version with an 
 Automated Reinforcement Management System (ARMS)  
                                                                                                                                                                                Version 0.1

After the baseline interview, you will be asked to log into the phone application 
every 4 -6 hours and provide a breath sample via the BACtrack breathalyzer. This 
takes 2 to 3 minutes each time.  
 
• Complete 2 weeks of introduction period. You will be asked to provide 3 breath 
samples a day, 4 -6 hours apart via your BACtrack breathalyzer, and the phone 
application. You will receive $2.00 for each sample submitted, regardless of what 
if that sample is positive or not, for a total of $6.00 a day.  
 
• Complete 4 weeks of the contingency management period. You will be asked to 
submit 3 samples a day, 4 -6 hours apart. You will be rewarded for submitting 
negative samples (a breathalyzer of 0.00). You will begin at $2.00, but rewards 
will escalate  by $0.25 per alcohol negative breath sample submission until a 
maximum value of $3.50 per sample is reached.  
o If you submit a positive sample your rewards will reset back to $2.00.  
 
• Complete the 2 weeks follow up phase. You will be asked to provide 3 breath 
samples a day, 4 -6 hours apart via your BACtrack breathalyzer, and the phone 
application. You will receive $2.00 for each sample submitted, regardless of if it is 
positive or not, for a total of $6.00 a day.

cannabis use and your sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008].  
 
• Follow study safety procedures. For safety purposes, we ask that you do not 
attempt to drive to your appointment if you are intoxicated or under the influence. 
If you provide a breath sample greater than .08, or team members observe overt 
behaviors of into xication, you will be asked to remain in our laboratory or office 
until your blood alcohol level returns to below legal limit. If your blood alcohol 
level is above the legal limit one hour before our office closes you will be asked

which would result in a loss of your confidentiality. We will attempt to schedule 
participants at times that would prevent this from occurring.  
 
• You may be asked some questions about your habits and history that make you 
feel uncomfortable. Likewise, you may feel uncomfortable providing urine or 
breath samples. We selected questionnaires and sample collection procedures 
that are like those that you  might encounter if you went to a medical or treatment 
facility.  
 
• You may experience alcohol withdrawal symptoms if your drinking decreases 
during the study. Examples of withdrawal symptoms are feeling like you need 
another drink to make you feel better. Delirium Tremens, shakes, and other 
physiological symptoms. We will  try to lower this risk by [CONTACT_698693] (ARMS)

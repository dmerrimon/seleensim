2. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
 
2.1. Type 1 D iabetes (T1DM)  
 
2.1.1.  Definition and metabolic characteristics of T ype 1 diabetes mellitus  
 
Type 1 diabetes mellitus  (T1DM)  is an immune- mediated disease in which insulin- producing beta 
cells are completely or near completely destroyed,  resulting in life -long dependenc e on exogenous 
insulin .  It is a chronic and potentially disabling disease that represents a major public health and 
clinical concern.  The number of patients being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes is increasing each 
year and is approaching an epi[INVESTIGATOR_48939] (1; 2) . 
 
Compared to individuals with the more common form of diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, ( where individuals 
retain some endogenous insulin production which is  inadequate to maintain normal glucose and lipid 
metabolism), the metabolic impairment in T1DM is much more severe and the loss of insulin 
production mo re complete. Continuous exogenous insulin therapy is needed to prevent ketoacidosis 
and allow assimilation of food and to maintain life. Most likely as a consequence of the absolute deficiency of insulin, glucose counterregulation (i.e. the hormonal response to insulin induced 
hypoglycemia) is impaired, and therefore, hypoglycemia is a frequent complication of the disease. 
The occurrence of hypoglycemia limits the ability to achieve near normal glucose control. The 
Diabetes Control and Complications study ( DCCT) showed that the long term complications could be 
reduced with near normal control of glucose levels but at the cost of an increased frequency of severe 
hypoglycemia (3). While there have been significant improvements in insulin delivery systems, such 
as continuous subcutaneous insulin infusions with insulin pumps, normal glucose control, particularly in children, is rarely achieved.  Therefore, individuals with Type 1 diabetes remain at risk for 
secondary end- organ complications including visual impairment and blindness, renal failure, vascular 
disease and limb amputation, peripheral neuropathy, stroke, acute risk for  severe hypoglycemia, and 
others. Moreover, at the time of diagnosis, many individuals, and children in particular, suffer 
significant morbidity frequently requiring ICU admission.  As described below, virtually all the 
individuals identified for enrollment into this prevention trial will develop diabetes.  Clearly, prevention 
of the onset of the disease itself would represent a significant advancement.   
 
2.1.2.  Natural History of Type 1 D iabetes  
 
Much is known about the natural history of the type 1 diabetes dis ease process  (4). Although all 
people are susceptible, relatives of individuals with T1DM are at much greater risk for development of 
the disease.   In the general population, approximately 0.3 % of individuals will develop T1DM . In 
contrast, those with a relative with T1DM have a 5% incidence of disease – a 15 fold increase (5).  
Further risk stratification among family members depends upon genetic, immune and metabolic data 
(6).   
 
Beta cell destruction generall y begins in genetically susceptible individuals years before clinical 
onset (7). The autoimmune process that causes beta cell destruction is clinically silent and can only 
be identified by [CONTACT_48956] (ICA) , anti-glutamic acid 
decarboxylase (GAD)65 ab, anti -ICA512ab, anti -insulin autoantibodies  (mIAA) (5), and the recently 
descr ibed antibodies to a zinc transporter (ZnT8) (8). Continued immune mediated beta cell

 destruction occurs until physiologic insulin demand cannot be met by [CONTACT_48957] , 
resulting in hyperglycemia and clinical diagnosis of T1DM  (9)(10).   
 
Based on data from the Diabetes Prevention Trial, type 1 diabetes ( DPT-1), the risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_48940]  (11-13).  The DPT -[ADDRESS_51375] large- scale prevention 
trials  of T1DM.  The aim of this trial, which tested >100,000 relatives of individuals with T1DM, was to 
study whether either low dose par enteral insulin or oral insulin administration would prevent the 
development of T1DM. The results of the DPT- 1 study showed that neither parenteral nor oral insulin 
prevented the development of T1DM, (although a secondary analysis of the data suggested som e 
effect of oral insulin in delaying the onset of diabetes in a subgroup of subjects defined by [CONTACT_48958] -
insulin antibodies and normal glucose tolerance) (13).  
 Autoantibody positive s ubjects enrolled in the DPT -1 study who had impaired or indeterminate 
glucose tolerance (any glucose level after ingestion of oral glucose of > 200 mg/ dL and/or a glucose 
level 2 hours after ingestion of oral glucose of 140- 200 mg/ dL and/or fasting glucose between 110 – 
126 mg/ dL during a standard oral glucose tolerance test were at very high risk (78% over 5 years) of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] T1DM over a 5 – 6 year follow up.  The risk was particularly high for indiv iduals under the 
age of 18 (Figure 1).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Similar results confirming the very high risk of those with abnormal glucose were found in the ENDIT 
(European Nicotinamide Diabetes Intervention Trial) study in which Nicotinamide failed to prevent the 
onset  of diabetes in relatives at risk for the disease (14).  
  Figure 1 : Risk of diabetes among individuals recruited for 
the DPT -1 study with abnormal glucose tolerance, stratified 
by [CONTACT_654]≤  18 or >  18 yrs.  
 TrialNet Protocol: TN10 Anti -CD3 Prevention         Protocol Version:  25Jun [ADDRESS_51376] been published (10; 15; 16) . These studies have 
identified the progressive loss of stimulated C -peptide responses to a mixed meal over time in high 
risk individuals. The differences between the responses in the pr ediabetic period and after the 
diagnosis of diabetes are modest but statistically significant. These studies describe a progressive 
predictable loss of beta cell function rather than a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_48941]. In addition, they also suggest 
that once metabolic impairment has occurred, the risk is extremely high. These combined immunologic and metabolic studies suggest to us that those individuals differ from those in whom the 
diagnosis of T1DM has been made only in the time of progression.  
 
There have been no therapi[INVESTIGATOR_48942] T 1DM (~80% as described above). The previous DPT -[ADDRESS_51377] range of risk –  the overall 5- year risk in the target population w as between 50-
60%. However, in newly diagnosed subjects, there is reason to believe that individuals with more beta 
cell function may show a better response to interventions. Earlier studies with Cyclosporine A 
suggested that response to immune therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] i s greatest in those with higher levels of insulin 
secretion at the time of diagnosis of T1DM  (17). In a recently published study of another non- FcR 
binding anti -CD3 mAb, Keymeulen et al found that clinical responses to drug were greatest in those in 
the upper half  of C-peptide responses at the time of study entry  (18). 
 
Therefore, the rationale for this study is that individuals with immunologic markers of T1DM and 
abnormal glucose tolerance are at very high risk for p rogression to overt disease. They have a 
condition that differs from overt diabetes only in the duration of the autoimmune process that results in beta cell destruction. Intervention at the “prediabetic” stage is likely to be more effective than 
interventi on in those in whom frank hyperglycemia has developed and beta cell function has 
deteriorated further because insulin production is greater before compared to after the diagnosis.  
 
2.2. Development of Teplizumab 
 
The Fc -engineered teplizumab [ hOKT3γ1 (Ala -Ala)] was developed as an approach to mitigate the 
adverse effects of OKT®3 resulting from Fc/FcR engagement  (19).  OKT®3 produces profound, 
transient T- cell depletion in vivo.  It also activates T cells, is strongly mitogenic, and its use in vivo is 
associated with severe cytokine- release syndrome (incidence >90%).  The cytokine- release 
syndrome induced by [CONTACT_48959]®3 is characterized by [CONTACT_411], chills, nausea, vomiting and other symptoms, 
and usually requi res corticosteroid therapy to suppress.  OKT®3 also is associated with a small 
incidence of EBV lymphomas (~1% -2%).  T -cell activation is strongly facilitated by [CONTACT_48960]®3 with Fc receptors on lymphocytes (Fc/FcR engagement).    
 
Teplizumab is a 150 -KD humanized mAb that binds the CD3 -e epi[INVESTIGATOR_48943] T cell receptor (TCR) 
complex with affinity equal to OKT®3, but it differs  from OKT®3 in two properties:  
 
1. The humanization process has resulted in the generation of a mAb that  used less than 10% of the 
original murine amino acids in the antibody construction.  The clinical consequence of this property is reduced immunogenicity or formation of anti -idiotypic antibodies.  
 
2. Two amino acids have been changed (leucine
234 to an alanine and leucine 235 to an alanine) in the 
Fc portion of the immunoglobulin that disrupt Fc receptor and complement component C1q 
 TrialNet Protocol: TN10 Anti -CD3 Prevention         Protocol Version:  25Jun 14 
 
Page 8 of 50 
 binding.  These two amino acid changes were aimed at eliminating the majority of cytokine -
mediated toxicity observed during in fusions of OKT®3.  
 
The modified Fc component of teplizumab minimizes the activating capacity of the antibody 
compared with unmodified murine OKT®3.  Although the primary mechanism of action of the antibody 
involves binding the CD3 antigen target on T cell s, subsequent mechanisms involved in the 
therapeutic effects are incompletely understood.  These mechanisms of action appear to involve 
weak agonistic activity on T cells as well as the generation of regulatory cytokines and regulatory T 
cells leading to t he development of tolerance (20; 21) . 
 
2.3. Clinical Studies  
 
As of March 2009, over [ADDRESS_51378] been completed using teplizumab in participants 
with recent onset T1DM; Study 1 (a phase I/II trial); Study 2 (protocol ITN007AI [NDB01]), as well as 
one PK/safety study (protocol ITN017AI).  In addition, four clinical studies to preserve beta cell 
function in those with T1DM are underway.  These studies are described below.  Further information 
about these studies and other clinical experience with teplizumab are in the I nvestigator’s Brochure.  
 
2.3.1.  Study 1: A Phase I/II Trial  
Study 1 was a randomized, controlled, phase I/II, three -center trial that enrolled a total of 43 
participants and tested two dosing regimens with hOKT3γ1(Ala- Ala)(23; 30) .  The clinical efficacy 
outcome tested was change in C -peptide response to MMTT in treated as compared to control 
groups.  
 
The results of these studies suggest that treatment with the anti -CD3 mAb hOKT3γ1 (Ala -Ala) 
reduces the loss of insulin production over the first year in individuals with T1DM ( Table 1)(23; 30) . 
 
Table 1 .  Changes in C -peptide response to an MMTT among participants in study 1  
 
At 1 year, the mean area under the curve (AUC) of the C -peptide response was 97+ 9.6% of the 
response at baseline in the drug- treated group (vs. 53 +7.6% in the control group, p=0.001) .

In the patients with diabetes, the drug treatment was associated with improvement in the hemoglobin 
A1C (HbA 1C) levels (p =0.004) and reduced use of insulin (p=0.001) over the 2- year period.  
 
2.3.2.  Study 2: A Phase II Multiple -Dose Trial , [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
Protocol ITN007AI [NDB01]) started in June 2002 to assess the ability of the regimen to prolong the 
duration of the clinical response and to increase the number of responders  (31). In study 2, the drug 
was to be administered soon after clinical diagnosis and at [ADDRESS_51381] 2002, 10 patients were enrolled in study 2 (6 were randomized to the drug treatment 
group and 4 to the control group) and those assigned to the drug treatment group received one 
course of hOKT3γ1 (Ala -Ala) treatment.  Further enrollment  and hOKT3γ1 (Ala- Ala) treatment s were 
stopped based on adverse event findings.  Further investigation into the potential differences of the 
drug products and their preparations indicated that the absolute amount of drug that was 
administered to the six ex perimental patients in study 2 was greater than had been used in study 1.Month0 6 12 18 24AUC (pmol/ml/240min)

2.3.3.  ITN 017: A Phase I dosing study  
Following discontinuation of Protocol ITN007, protocol ITN017 was conducted to determine a safe 
dose to be used for studies of teplizumab in subjects  with Type [ADDRESS_51382] in the higher dosing cohort developed 
hyperbilirubi nemia. The current dosing regimen is based on the findings from ITN017.  
 
2.3.4.   “ABATE Trial” ITN027 [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
This Phase II randomized open label study will test whether two courses of treatment (each for 14 
days) within [ADDRESS_51383] been 6 serious adverse events in this trial. Three of these were judged to be study drug related. Two of the 3 were lymphopenia that was not unexpected, and one was cytokine 
release syndrom e. This study showed reduced decline in C -peptide in the drug- treated vs control 
group (p=0.001 , manuscript in preparation).  
 
2.3.5.   “Delay Trial” [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
This randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial will test the ability of a single 14 day cours e of 
treatment with teplizumab to prevent the loss of C -peptide 1 year after study enrollment. The “Delay 
Trial” offers optional retreatment for all subjects who retain detectable levels of insulin production, 1 
year after study entry. The inclusion criter ia for the Delay Trial differs from other studies in its 
enrollment of individuals with Type 1 diabetes of duration of 4 –  [ADDRESS_51384] been two 
serious adverse events in this trial, neither of which was judged to be study drug related. The analys is 
of the primary endpoint (difference in C -peptide responses to a mixed meal test at 12 mos adjusted 
for baseline C -peptide response and duration stratum) showed significantly greater responses in the 
teplizumab treated group (p=0.03, manuscript submitted). However, because of an imbalance in 
HgbA1c levels at baseline, an additional analysis was performed correcting for the baseline HgbA1c 
level, C- peptide AUC, and duration stratum, and difference in the primary endpoint was 17.7% 
(p=0.09). Nonetheless, the drug treated group lost significantly less of the baseline C -peptide AUC 
level (20.6%) compared to placebo treated subjects (37%)(p=0.04) after correction for baseline C -
peptide AUC, baseline HgbA1c, and duration stratum, and a greater proportion of subj ects lost 
detectable C -peptide in the placebo group (p=0.02). In a post -hoc analysis subjects with HgbA1c 
levels < 6.5% and younger (< age 15 yrs) subjects showed significant responses to teplizumab after correction for duration strata and baseline C -pepti de and baseline HgbA1c levels (as a covariate in 
the analysis of age strata). 
 
 
2.3.6.   “Protégé Trial” [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
This is a Phase II/III multicenter study to compare efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 3 dose levels of 
teplizumab relative to placebo, in subjects within 12 weeks of T1DM diagnosis.   Segment 1 was an 
open label study of 30 subjects which has completed enrollment.   
The results from the analysis of the primary endpoint were announced in October 2010 and published 
in 2011. The primary endpoint (a c omparison of the proportion of subjects with hemoglobin 
A1C< 6.5% who were using < 0.5U/kg/d of exogenous) was not met. However, a posthoc analysis of 
the effects of full dose of drug treatment showed that the C -peptide levels in the teplizumab treatment 
group were significantly greater than in placebo treated control subjects 12 months after enrollment 
(Sherry et al, 2011).

 2.3.7.  “Protégé Encore Trial” [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
This is a Phase II/III multicenter study to compare efficacy, safety, and tolerability of [ADDRESS_51385] 6 days of drug treatment, in about 
10% of subjects.  The 2006 safety  evaluation noted that study drug was discontinued in 6/60 
individuals due to adverse events characterized by [CONTACT_48961].  Specifically, the signs that identified this complex included any of the following: a) 
fever (of grade 3), b) an increase in the PT and/or PTT and an increase in the level of D -dimers, c) an 
increase in the total bilirubin level, d) hypotension, and e) an increase in liver enzymes.  In each case, the abnormal findings began within the first [ADDRESS_51386] 
dose of drug. In all 6 cases, drug administration was stopped prior to administration to a complete 
course of protocol -defined treatment. The laboratory abnormalities  were self -limited, did not progress, 
and completely resolved without sequelae.  
 
Based on these analyses, additional laboratory studies to evaluate the presence of cytokine release 
were recommended, and more stringent criteria for withholding drug were dev eloped. With the 
modified criteria, all subjects who discontinued drug administration because of adverse events were 
identified by [CONTACT_48962]. These new evaluations are incorporated into this and other 
ongoing protocols. More information is av ailable in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
 
2.5. Use of Teplizumab in Children  
 
The majority of new cases of T1DM  occur  in children under the age of 18.  Moreover, given that the 
duration of diabetes is a significant risk factor for the development of diabetes com plications and the 
clearly recognized difficulty in attaining excellent metabolic control of diabetes during adolescence  (3; 
32), it is critical that children are included in studies of the prevention of type [ADDRESS_51387] participated in clinical trials of teplizumab: 100 in open- label studies (all treated 
with teplizumab) and approximately 500 in randomized, blinded studies (approximately 80% treated 
with teplizumab). See Table 2 shown below which displays enrollment by [CONTACT_551].

[CONTACT_49020] and colleagues reviewed the adverse event experience of the completed trials and 
concluded that although the number of subjects was small, there was no apparent relationship of age 
to the number or severity of adverse events.   
 
In addition to the possibility of delaying or preventing the onset of T1DM, which is unpr oven, there are 
other prospects for direct benefit to children by [CONTACT_47361].  These include the recognized benefits of being in a clinical study, and of close monitoring for development of diabetes 
which significantly prevents morbidity associated with onset of the disease in the community including 
ICU admissions.  The intervention has the prospect of direct benefit to the individual subject and in 
addition, is likely to yield general knowledge about T1DM which is of importance for t he 
understanding and amelioration of T1DM in children.  
 
The study procedures, while greater than minimal risk, offers the possibility of benefit due to the close 
monitoring for all participants, including children.  Assent of children along with consent of  the parents 
will be obtained prior to any study procedures.  This research proposal in children is therefore 
consistent with [LOCATION_002] Department of Health and Human Services, Protection of Human 
Subjects, 45CFR46.405 (research involving greater than minimal risk but presenting the prospect of 
direct benefit to individual subjects) and with 21CFR50.52 (Clinical investigations involving greater 
than minimal risk but presenting the prospect of direct benefit to individual subjects).

 3. STUDY DESIGN 
 
3.1. Overview  
 
This is a mult icenter, double masked , randomized, placebo-  controlled study to determine whether 
treatme nt of subjects at high risk for diabetes with teplizumab results in delay or prevention of clinical 
T1DM.  
3.2. Objectives 
 
3.2.1.  Primary Objective  
 
The primary objective of the study is to determine whether treatment of at -risk subjects with 
teplizumab results in a delay or prevention of T1DM .  
 
3.2.2.  Secondary Objectives 
 
• to determine whether treatment with teplizumab is superior to placebo  with respect to C-
peptide responses to oral glucose, as obtained from timed collections during longitudinal 
tests  
• to compare the saf ety and tolerability of teplizumab to placebo  
• to assess the effects of treatment on mechanistic outcomes  
 
3.3. Summary of Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
 
Participants must meet all entry criteria for the protocol as outlined below.  
 
3.3.1.  Inclusion Criteria:  
Study subjects must be or have:  
 
1. Participant in TrialNet Natural History Study (TN01) and thus a relative of a proband** with T1D M. 
2. Between the ages of 1 -45 years  at the time of enrollment in TN01  and age ≥ [ADDRESS_51388] (or parent or legal guardian if the subject  is a minor ) is w illing to provide Informed Consent.

conducted OGTT’s demonstrating abnormal glucose tolerance, the most recent of which must have 
been within 7 weeks (52 days) of the baseline visit  (visit 0).   
 
6. The participant must be positive for two or more diabetes -related autoantibodies on two occasions. 
 TrialNet Protocol: TN10 Anti -CD3 Prevention         Protocol Version:  25Jun [ADDRESS_51391] occasion. The 
autoantibodies that are to be confirmed are anti -GAD65, anti -ICA512, anti -insulin (MIAA), ZnT8 
and/or ICA . 
7. Weigh at least [ADDRESS_51392] one year from 
randomization.  
10. Willing and medically acceptable to postpone live vaccine immunizations for one y ear after treatment.

3.4. Enrollment  
Potential study subjects will be identified through the ongoing TrialNet Natural History /Pathway to 
Prevention study. In this study, first and second degree relatives of patients with T1DM are screened 
for biochemical autoantibodies and ICA. Those individuals who test  positive are then further staged 
with the performance of an OGTT. The results of this OGTT  performed in a TrialNet study  will be 
used to determine eligibilit y for this protocol.  
The TrialNet Natural History /Pathway to Prevention study screens participants at over 200 clinical 
sites.  The infusion of teplizumab or placebo will occur at a limited number of designated TrialNet 
infusion sites, whereas the initial  screening  visit and follow -up testing, as described in the Schedule of 
Assessments, may occur at other (non- infusion) TrialNet sites.  
3.5. Double -Masking and Description of Treatment Groups  
 
The intervention will be conducted only amongst those who consent to participate.  Subjects  will be 
randomized to receive either teplizumab or placebo.  All subjects will undergo close monitoring for the 
development of diabetes. Subjects and clinical investigators will be masked as to treatment 
assignment.  The intervention protocol will be conducted at approved TrialNet clinical sites with 
appropriate facilit ies. All blood and serum samples for the primary and secondary outcome 
determinations will be sent to the TrialNet Core Laboratories for analysis.  Clinical laborat ory studies 
that will be used for determining eligibility for study drug infusion will be performed at the local sites.  
 
Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio (within the two strata defined by [CONTACT_48965]: <18 and 18 or older) to the following 2 groups:  
 
• to receive teplizumab (14 day IV infusion)  followed by [CONTACT_48966] 
T1DM  development  
• to receive placebo (14 day IV infusion) followed by [CONTACT_48966] T1DM  
development  
 
 
3.6. Treatment Assignment  
 
After participants provide informed consent , complete the screening visit(s), and meets  all of the 
inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, participants will be randomized to receive either 
teplizumab or placebo.   
 
Participants will be randomized in equal allocations to each group. The randomization method will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_48967] 18 years of age or 18 years 
and older. This approach ensures that study site will not be a potential confounder.  The TNCC will 
generate the randomization numbers and tables.

3.6.1.  Procedures for Unmasking  
 
Emergency unmasking will occur upon notification of  the TrialNet Central Pharmacy and TNCC via 
the 24 hour emergency number and approval by [CONTACT_48968], NIDDK TrialNet program officer , or 
TrialNet Medical Monitor. Non- emergent unmasking will occur upon notification of the  TNCC and 
approval by [CONTACT_48969]. If unmasking is approved, the study 
sponsor and appropriate TrialNet committees (e.g. Safety M onitoring) will be notified of the event as 
soon as reasonably possible; however, they will not be unmasked.   
 
3.7. Study Assessments  
 
During the course of the study, participants will frequently undergo assessments of their glucose 
tolerance status, insulin production, immunologic status, and overall health and well -being (see 
Schedule of Assessments).   
 
Samples will be drawn for storage in the National Institute for Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney 
Disease (NIDDK) Repository and at TrialNet Laboratory Sites f or future analysis .  
3.8. Quality Assurance  
 
During the study, duplicate collections of blood samples for assays will be obtained in a small sample 
of subjects for the purpose of external quality surveillance of the performance of the TrialNet Central 
Laborator ies.  
3.9. Study Timeline  
 
 
3.9.1.  Study Duration 
The study is designed to provide 80% statistical power to detect a 6 0% risk reduction with a one-
sided test at the 0.02 5 significance level.  This risk reduction is expected to result in a delay in the 
median time to onset of diabetes of 7.52, 8.93, and 10.6 yrs. for the age cohorts < 18 and ≥ [ADDRESS_51397] rate and the rate of loss -to-follow -up.   
 TrialNet Protocol: TN10 Anti -CD3 Prevention         Protocol Version:  25Jun [ADDRESS_51398] not developed 
diabetes by [CONTACT_48970] /Pathway to 
Prevention study protocol.   
 
Individuals who develop T1DM may be eligible for interventional studies sponsored by [CONTACT_48971]. In the event that a subject wishes to participate in another 
investigational study that has, as an exclusion, treatment with experimental or immune modulatory 
drugs, the subject may request and be told of their treatment group assignment for the anti -CD3 
prevention study.  Every attempt will be made to minimize potential bias that this may introduce.  T he 
TNCC will make treatment assign ment information available to the site investigator  of the new study 
after the subject is determined to be willing to participate and not otherwise excluded from  the new 
study.  Other study group members will not be informed of the treatment assignment info rmation.  
Mitigation of bias issues must be balanced against safety and interests of participants.

4. PATIENT MANAGEMENT  
 
4.1. Screening Visit and Eligibility Assessment  
 
This study will draw participants fro m the TrialNet Natural History /Pathway to Prevention Study.   
 The initial testing for autoantibodies, HLA type, and Oral Glucose Tolerance Test ( OGTT ) will be done 
as part of Natural History /Pathway to Prevention.  Those individuals with two confirmed diabetes -
related autoantibodies  and abnormal glucose tolerance on the OGTT, will then be eligible for 
additional tests and possible enrollment into this study . 
 Appendi ces 1 and 2  summarize  the flow of subjects from the Natural History /Pathway to Prevention 
Study into this study . 
 
4.2. Anti-CD3 mAb Trial for At -risk S ubjects Initial Visit  
 
Prior to  the initial visit, this study  will be described to the potential participant.  The 
participant /parent/guardian will be asked to sign an informed consent document describing the 
purpose, risks, and benefits of screening  for the trial.  A participant’s signature [CONTACT_49018]/she 
understands the potential risks and benefits of study participation. Subjects less than age 18 , qualify 
for the study with a single OGTT with abnormal glucose tolerance. Those age 18 or older , require two 
consecutive OGTTs with abnormal glucose tolerance. Qualifying OGTTs may occur under the 
auspi[INVESTIGATOR_48944] a part of this visit if needed.  During these visits, other clinical 
tests will also be performed to determine eligibility.  
 
Any participant either not eligible or not willing to be randomized into this study  is eligible for 
continued follow -up as part of the TrialNet Natural History /Pathway to Prevention Study.   
 
4.3. Randomizat ion and Baseline V isits 
 
Review will be made to be certain the subject meets study eligibility criteria.  Prior to randomization, 
the intervention and follow -up phases of the study will be described to the participant.  The 
participant /parent/guardian will be asked to sign an informed consent document indicating that he/she 
understands the study as well as the potential risks and benefits of study participation.   
 
Participants will be randomized to either the treatment arm or the control arm.  The randomi zation 
and the baseline visit must occur within [ADDRESS_51399] the visit postponed up to five 
days outside the 7 week window if needed  because of intercurrent illness . At or p rior to the baseline 
visit (visit 0) , subjects < age [ADDRESS_51400] udy period, all participants will receive close monitoring for development of diabetes.  
OGTT tests will be performed at 3 and 6 months and every 6 months  thereafter .  In addition, at three 
 TrialNet Protocol: TN10 Anti -CD3 Prevention         Protocol Version:  25Jun 14 
 
Page 20 of 50 
 month intervals (where there is no OGTT scheduled) , a random ( non-fasting ) glucose level will be 
measured . At each visit and via routine contact  [CONTACT_48972] , participants  will be asked directed 
questions about the presence or absence of symptoms associated with diabetes such as blurry 
vision, unintended weight loss of more than [ADDRESS_51401] -prandial glucose values are greater than 
200 mg/dL, further evaluation,  including fasting glu cose or an OGTT,  will be performed.  Individuals in 
both of the study arms will have laboratory and mechanistic studies performed as detailed in the 
Schedule of A ssessments.  
 
4.5. Administration of Teplizumab  
 
4.5.1.  Drug Administration 
 
Teplizumab or saline will be a dministered via IV infusion over [ADDRESS_51402] 
commence within  7 weeks of the qualifying  OGTT , except in the case of interim illness as noted 
above (Section 4.3) .   
 Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 tre atment arms and will receive a  14-day course of 
teplizumab and/or placebo. T he treatment course will be administered on Study Days 0– 13. The 2 
treatme nt arms are described below.  
 
• Arm #1:  Subjects will receive a 14- day course of teplizumab consisting of daily IV doses 
of 51 micrograms/meter squared (µg/m
2), 103 µg/m2, 207 µg/m2, and 413 µg/m2 on Study 
Days 0 –3, respectively, and one dose of 826 µg/m2 on each of Study Days 4– 13. The total 
dose for a 14 -day course is approximately 9034 µg/m2. For subjects weighing 70 kg and 
having a body surface area (BSA) of 1.92 m2, this dosing schedule delivers ~18  milligrams 
(mg) of teplizumab.  
• Arm #2:  Subjects will r eceive a 14- day course of IV placebo only.  
 
The subject’s BSA will be calculated by [CONTACT_48973]. The BSA will 
be calculated on Study Day 0, and will be based on the subject’s height and weight on that day. 
This calculation wi ll be used for dosing over the entire 14 days. For dosing purposes the 
participant’s BSA should be rounded up to the nearest tenth place regardless of the number in the 
hundredth position. For example, if the BSA is 1.61, it will be rounded up to 1.[ADDRESS_51403] whole number.  For example if the participant’s BSA is 1.722, on Day 0 the participant would receive 92μg.  
 
 
The Mosteller formula  
BSA (m²) = ( [Height(cm) x Weight(kg) ]/ 3600 )½ 
 
 
Teplizumab or saline is administer ed via  an IV infusion over a minimum of 30 minutes  in the 
research or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885]. This infusion should be given at the same time each day +/ - [ADDRESS_51404] -infusion monitoring if 
they remain within approximately one hour  (driving time)  of the treatment center.   
 TrialNet Protocol: TN10 Anti -CD3 Prevention         Protocol Version:  25Jun [ADDRESS_51405] of:  
• 10 mM sodium phosphate 
• 150 mM sodium chloride 
• 0.05 mg/mL Tween 80  
• pH 6.[ADDRESS_51406] will be provided at a concentration of 1 mg/mL for a total of [ADDRESS_51407] per vial.  
 
The vials should be stored upright at 2° –8° C and must not be frozen.  Because there is no 
preservative and drug loss occurs over time, administration of study drug should begin as soon as 
possible and no later than [ADDRESS_51408] During the 14 Day Treatment Period  
Chemistries, liver function studies, CBC and differentials, and INR studies will be evaluated before 
drug is administered on eac h day that these studies are drawn as described in the attached Schedule 
of Assessments.  
 The following situations, laboratory abnormalities , or adverse events will lead to withholding of drug 
treatment  during the treatment course : (Note: Day 0 is the firs t day of infusion)  
 
1. Withdrawal of consent  
2. Pregnancy for a female subject  
3. Anaphylaxis requiring hemodynamic support (i.e., epi[INVESTIGATOR_13027]/or blood pressure 
medications) or mechanical ventilation.  
4. Hepatic abnormalities*:   
a. Defined as total bilirubin >1.3 mg/ dL on Day 1, ≥2.0 mg/ dL on other days.  
i. The exception will be for subjects diagnosed prior to randomization with Gilbert ’s syndrome. These subjects will be monitored with GGT levels. They 
may receive drug if the total bilirubin exceeds these levels provided the GGT is 
≤ [ADDRESS_51409] level >[ADDRESS_51410], ALT or LDH ≥3.[ADDRESS_51411] on other days  
5. Thrombocytopenia*:  Defined as a platelet count < 140,000 on Day 1 and < 100,000 on other 
days.   
6. Neutropeni a*:  Defined as <1000 cells/mm
3 (grade 3).  
7. Anemia*:  Defined as hemoglobin ≤ 8.5 g/dL or a drop in ≥2g/dL compared with prior to 
infusion to a value < 10.0 g/dL.  
8. Coagulopathy*:  INR > 0.1 above the upper limit of normal at the laboratory.    
9. Fever:  Grade 3  pyrexia on Day 0 or 1.  
10. Other adverse events:  Defined as a grade 3 or higher adverse event, regardless of 
relatedness to study drug, except for: lymphopenia, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia,

Page 22 of 50 
 fatigue/malaise, insomnia, chei litis, dry skin, nail changes, hot fl ushes/flashes, headache, 
myalgia, flu -like symptoms.   
11. Any medically important event such as a concurrent illness, complications or abnormal 
laboratory test result that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], contraindicates continued dosing 
of study drug.  
A laboratory test result meeting any of the above abnormalities noted by (*) should be confirmed on 
the same day as the initial test. Drug dosing will not occur while awaiting confirmation of the laboratory abnormality. If laboratory abnormalities are confir med, or if any of the other situations listed 
above occur, the drug infusions will be discontinued in that participant  and the procedures listed 
below will be followed. The drug infusions may not be resumed.  Depending on the severity of the 
event, further  reporting may be required as outlined below.  
If the laboratory test is not confirmed when tested on the same day, drug dosing may be continued at 
the discretion of the site investigator.  
 
The Study Chair, TNCC, and Medical Monitor will be notified within [ADDRESS_51412] who is 
discontinued from study drug dosing.  Participants  who are discontinued from teplizumab dosing will 
continue to receive follow -up care and evaluation as scheduled.  
 
4.5.3.  Further Evaluation after Withholding Infusions  
 
The followin g are minimal assessments to be performed for those participants in whom an infusion is 
withheld (as described above):  
 
1. LIVER TESTS :  Total and direct bilirubin, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase the day the adverse 
event occurs and followed with frequent laboratory studies in order to establish the day that the 
event resolves. Additional studies may include an abdominal ultrasound to assess liver status and 
GI consult when necessary.  If GGT, AST or ALT is > [ADDRESS_51413] and bilirubin >[ADDRESS_51414], evaluation 
should be done to determine if there is a cause other than study drug for these abnormalities 
(e.g., acute viral hepatitis, alcoholic and autoimmune hepatitis, biliary tract disorders, 
cardiovascular causes such as right heart failure or concomitant medications ). 
2. HEMATOLOGIC TESTS :  CBC, differential, INR, D- dimer, and fibrinogen the day the adverse event 
occurs. The peripheral blood smear will be studied for evidence of RBC fragmentation.  The CBC 
and differential  and I NR, will be frequently repeated in order to establish the day that the event 
resolves.   
3. DRUG LEVELS :  Teplizumab levels  
4. ADDITIONAL SAMPLES :  Serum samples for storage and potential future analysis . 
 
4.6. Interruption of Enrollment/Trial Cessation 
 
Sections 4.5.2 and 4.5.3 describe monitoring and procedu res for withholding drug treatment in 
individual patients.  This section lists clinical and laboratory adverse events that will necessitate 
interruption of enrollment in the trial as a whole.  As part of their ongoing safety review, the DSMB will 
make independent judgments regarding other adverse events requiring trial interruption.   
 
1. Any drug related death * 
 TrialNet Protocol: TN10 Anti -CD3 Prevention         Protocol Version:  25Jun [ADDRESS_51415] 10 
enrolled subjects or in more than 2 0% of the total number of  teplizumab treated subjects.  
4. Grade 3 cytokine release syndrome (accordi ng to CTCAE criteria) at any time in more 
than [ADDRESS_51416] 10 or more than 20% of the total number of teplizumab treated subjects.  
5. The occurrence of ALT or AST ≥3x ULN and bilirubin >2x ULN  at any time in any one 
subject , with the exception of those who have been diagnosed with Gilbert’s syndrome 
prior to randomization and have met  the criteria listed in section  4.5.[ADDRESS_51417] 10 or more than 20% of the 
total number of teplizumab treated subjects.  
7. Grade [ADDRESS_51418] 10 or more than 20% of 
the total number of teplizumab treated subjects.  
8. Clinical mononucleosis syndrome which may include: Grade [ADDRESS_51419] 10 or more than 25% of the total number of teplizumab  treated subjects.  
9. Severe adverse event: defined by [CONTACT_48974] [ADDRESS_51420] 30 days of drug treatment . In addition, severe adverse event 
of grade 3 or greater in more th an 20% of the total number of teplizumab treated subjects.  
10. Failure of the absolute number of lymphocytes to recover to 80% of the pretreatment level [ADDRESS_51421] 10 or 20% of the total number of 
teplizumab treated subjects.  
 
In the event that these criteria are met, study enrollment will be suspended and the Institutional 
Review Boards /Ethics Committees/Research Ethics Board (IRB/EC/REB),  and FDA and other 
applicable regulatory authorities will be notified that enr ollment has been interrupted in order to 
perform a safety review of the enrolled subjects. The safety review will include a comprehensive evaluation of the safety experience from this trial as well as data from other ongoing studies with 
teplizumab in other disease settings. Before enrollment will resume, a satisfactory report of the safety 
review will be provided to the FDA,  other applicable regulatory authorities,  Institutional Review 
Boards /Ethics Committees/Research Ethics Boards (IRB/EC/REB) , and the D SMB.  
 
*During this trial, any death event will be temporarily considered unexpected and potentially drug-
related until the event is adjudicated by [CONTACT_4318]. In this event, the trial will be interrupted, including 
dosing of subjects already enrolled and enr ollment of new subjects, until the death event is 
adjudicated by [CONTACT_48975] “unlikely to be related to study drug.”

5.5. Laboratory Measures Related to Teplizumab Administration 
 
Laboratory tests to measure drug level and immune response to the drug:  
• Trough drug levels of teplizumab will be measured during the last 4 days  of mAb 
administration in 12 subjects of each of the age strata: ≥  16 yrs, 12 -15 yrs, and 8 -11 yrs.  
• Antibodies against teplizumab will be measured at month 3 in 12 subjects from each age 
strata: ≥ [ADDRESS_51423] occur within 7 weeks after  qualifying  OGTT (with the exception that 
individuals who are febrile at the time of the scheduled baseline visit, may have up to an additional 5 
days).  Visit [ADDRESS_51424] be +/ - 2 days.  Visit 15 is to be +/ - 4 days.  All other visits described in the 
Schedule of As sessments  can be ± 3 weeks.  
 
 TrialNet Protocol: TN10 Anti -CD3 Prevention         Protocol Version:  25Jun [ADDRESS_51425] all adverse events on source documents.  Events 
not related to diabetes onset, hypoglycemia, or hyperglycemia which are Grade 2 or greater  per the 
NCI CTCAE (see Section 6.1.4. Grading Event Severity below) must be reported to TNCC.  The 
investigator should treat participants with adverse events appropriately and observe them at suitable 
intervals until the events resolve or stabilize.  
 
Adve rse events may be discovered through:  
• observation of the participant;  
• questioning the participant;  
• unsolicited complaint by [CONTACT_48976].  
6.1.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) or reaction is defined as “any adverse event occurring at any dose that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution.”  This includes but is 
not limited to any of the following events:  
1. Death.  A death that o ccurs during the study or that comes to the attention of the 
investigator during the protocol -defined follow -up after the completion of therapy must be 
reported whether it is considered to be treatment related or not.  
2. A life -threatening event.  A life -threatening event is any adverse therapy experience that, 
in the view of the investigator, places the participant at immediate risk of death from the 
reaction as it occurred.  
3. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
4. Persistent or significant disability.  
5. An event that required intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage.  An 
important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based on appropr iate medical 
judgment, it may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
6. Congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
7. Grade [ADDRESS_51426] 30 days after the 
start of the teplizumab/placebo infusion . 
8. Grade [ADDRESS_51427] 30 days after the 
start of the teplizumab/placebo infusion . 
 TrialNet Protocol: TN10 Anti -CD3 Prevention         Protocol Version:  25Jun [ADDRESS_51428] be reported as a 
serious adverse event if it meets any of the above definitions.  
 
6.1.3.  Unexpected Adverse Event  
 
An adverse event is considered unexpected when the nature (specificity) or severity of the event is 
not consistent with the risks described in the Investigator’s Brochure or the informed consent 
document.  
 
6.1.4.  Grading Event Severity and Causality  
 
TrialNet has adopted usage of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Technology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) and/or study -specific criteria for classification to describe the severity of 
adverse events .  Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia will be reported as adverse events only in the 
case of requiring the assistance of others due to loss of consciousness or DKA . TN Investigators will 
also provide an assessment of relationship of AE to study drug as not, unlikely, possibly, probably, or 
definitely related.  
 
6.2. Adverse Event Reporting and Monitoring 
 
Adverse events will be reported to the TrialNet Coordinating Center.  The  investigator  will grade their 
severity according to common toxicity criteria or study -specific criteria and will make a determination 
of their relation to therapy.  Events will be assessed and reported consistent  with the ICH Guideline 
for Good Clinical Practice and per the guidance of the DHHS Office for Human Research Protections 
(OHRP).    
The adverse event case report form for the protocol must be completed for all reportable adverse 
events (AE).  For reporting serious adverse events (SAE), the TrialNet MedWatch Form should also be completed and faxed to the TNCC within [ADDRESS_51429] regular 
safety reviews approximately every three to six months (and otherwise as needed) of adverse events 
by [CONTACT_48977].  Serious adverse events as well as adverse events leading to study discontinuation will be reviewed by [CONTACT_4318]. All adverse events will also be reported to 
MacroGenics  by [CONTACT_48978] .

be withdrawn from analysis if this occurs.  
Participants who receive teplizumab/placebo will be instructed not to receive live vaccinations for [ADDRESS_51431] izumab is in the 
Investigator’s Brochure.  The descriptions below highlight the most common drug related events and 
potential adverse events.  
 
7.2.1.  Hematologic  
The drug causes a reduction i n the number of circulating lymphocytes. Grade 3 or higher 
lymphopenia has been seen during drug administration in 15% of subjects. However, i n more than 
85% of individuals , circulating lymphocytes return to ≥ 80% of baseline values by 2 months after 
initiation of treatment .  A single SAE (i.e., prolonged CD4 cytopenia) has occurred in a subject  who 
was given [ADDRESS_51432] occurred in < 5% of subjects but have been up to grade 3 in < 2% 
of individuals. They have resolved spontaneously or with withholding of drug in all cases. This risk will 
be mitigated by [CONTACT_48979]: TN10 Anti -CD3 Prevention         Protocol Version:  25Jun 14

 teplizumab/placebo as indicated in the SOE. No specific therapy for the eosinophila is planned. 
Specific treatment stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_48946] 4.5.2.  
 
Mild a nemia has been seen in 21.9% of subjects.  This risk will be mitigated by [CONTACT_48980]/placebo as indicated in the SO A.   
 
7.2.2.  Cytokine Release Syndrome  
Cytokine release s yndrome (CRS) has been described in 5.7% of drug treated subjects –  the 
syndrome was mild or moderate in 5/6 reported subjects. Compared to FcR binding anti -CD3 
antibodies like OKT3, the CRS that has occurred with Teplizumab is reduced in frequency and 
severity. The clinical experience to date suggests that the occurrence of CRS may be seen with the 
initial doses of the drug and is dose related. The single reported case of moderate disseminated 
intravascular coagulation was related to the occurrence of cyto kine release syndrome.  In a previous 
phase II trial   (using a drug dose that is 2 times higher than the proposed dose) , symptoms of CRS —
including headache, nausea, vomiting, fever, myalgias, arthralgias, and shaking —occurred over the 
first [ADDRESS_51433] also included hyperbilirubinemia and increased liver function tests . In the 
PK/safety trial (ITN017AI), a grade [ADDRESS_51434] been a manifestation 
of a cytokine release syndrome, was observed.   
Transient increases in the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
up to 5 times normal (grades 1 and 2) levels have been seen in all trials.  These abnormalities have 
been transient.  Grade [ADDRESS_51435] ant rejection.  
This risk will be mitigated by [CONTACT_48981] , including bilirubin , reviewed before 
administration of teplizumab/placebo as described in the SOE  and the specific drug withholding rules 
listed in Section 4.5.2.   
 
7.2.3.  Lymphopr oliferative Disease  
Although not raised as an issue in the single- dose studies of hOKT 3γ1 (Ala -Ala), immunosuppression 
of any sort may predispose participants to additional risks such as infection or lymphoproliferative disease.  On a theoretical basis, this risk is minimal  since the total duration of immunosuppression is 
short.  Clinical e xperience in transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] , treated with other biologic agents,  suggests that 
the risk of lymphoproliferative disease is highest in participants who develop infections with EBV 
around the time of immunosuppression.   Nonetheless, the lymphoprolifera tive syndrome associated 
with reactivation of EBV infection that was seen in an islet transplant patient treated with teplizumab 
and other immunosuppressive drugs occurred in a subject who was EBV IgG+ before study entry.  
Therefore, a careful history will  be taken regarding development of mononucleosis -like illnesses 
during the period preceding and after study enrollment. Subjects will be screened for CMV viral load.  Subjects will be screened for EBV infection with serology (VCA IgG, VCA IgM, and EBNA) and EBV 
viral loads as indicated.  T he finding of a positive viral load will preclude enrollment for at least [ADDRESS_51436] will need to repeat OGTT assessments to ensure continued elig ibility for the trial.  Samples for EBV and CMV viral will 
be obtained after drug treatment as described in the SOE.  These will be routinely measured in 
symptomatic subjects.  This aggressive monitoring scheme will allow us to determine whether 
changes in lymphocyte subsets are associated with reactivation of latent viruses.
 TrialNet Protocol: TN10 Anti -CD3 Prevention         Protocol Version:  25Jun [ADDRESS_51437] been detected in up to 50% of patients administered teplizumab.  The 
presence of these antibodies may diminish efficacy of future  cycles of study drug and/or lead to 
manifestations of antigen- antibody complexes such as serum -sickness illness or hypersensitivity 
reactions. The titer of these anti -idiotype antibodies has been < 1:[ADDRESS_51438] been reported as a result of these antibodies.   
 
7.2.5.  Infection  
As with any therapy that suppresses the immune system, the re is a risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_48947].  On 
a theoretical basis, this risk is minimal, as the total duration of immunosuppression is short.  Overall, in open labeled trials with teplizumab, 49.5% of subjects have experienced infections of any kind. Of these, 48.6% were classified as mild or moderate. There have been two cases of TB reported in 
Protégé trial participants in India and Ukraine respectively.  However, trial remains blinded so 
relatedness is not known at this time.  
An increase in herpes virus infections has occurred with teplizumab administration. Specifically, up to 
10% of subjects have had a transient increase in EBV viral load, but this was not necessarily 
associated with an increase in mononucleosis  like syndrome. There have been case reports of 
herpes zoster in the Protégé study. Some occurred during dosing and others were over 270 days 
after commencing dosing. All subjects recovered and none of the cases were serious.  
 
This risk will be mitigated by [CONTACT_48982].  They will 
be specifically asked about infectious adverse events during the study visit, and they will be 
monitored regularly for infections and appropriate anti -infective therapy will be instituted if indicated. 
Consultation with Trial Net infectious disease team will be available.  All infectious adverse events will 
be reviewed by [CONTACT_48983], Medical Monitor and DSMB if serious.  
 
7.2.6.  Rash  
Rash has been seen in 42- 62% of subjects  treated with drug.  The rashes that have been observed 
include a macular rash on the face, neck, and trunk, as well as a maculopapular rash on the extremities.  The latter rash has occurred on the hands and feet and has resolved spontaneously but 
with peeling of the skin.  Biopsies of the rash performed in t wo subjects showed histologic findings of 
spongiosis consistent with eczematous dermatitis.  A severe rash occurred in one subject, receiving 
hOKT3γ1(Ala -Ala) for prevention of islet allograft rejection on the 3rd day of drug administration. It 
was classif ied as severe and the patient was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  A biopsy of the rash showed a moderate 
mixed perivascular dermal infiltrate consistent with a drug reaction.  Supportive care was given, the 
drug dosage was reduced, and the rash resolved.

 childbearing potential will also be required to undergo urine pregnancy tests at regular intervals 
including prior to teplizumab/placebo administration.  A positive pregnancy  test will result in holding of 
scheduled drug infusion.  
 
All pregnancies that are identified during the study must be followed to conclusion and the outcome of 
each must be reported.  The investigator should be informed immediately of any pregnancy  whether 
occurring in a female participant or the female partner of a male participant .  The investigator should 
report all pregnancies to TrialNet within the same timeframe (24 hours) as SAEs, using the SAE 
report form.  Monitoring of the participant should cont inue until the conclusion of the pregnancy, and a 
follow -up SAE report form detailing the outcome of the pregnancy should be submitted to TrialNet.

Primary analysis of treat ment effect will be conducted under the intention- to-treat principle whereby 
[CONTACT_48985].
  
8.[ADDRESS_51441] among those randomized.  
Criteria for diabetes onset ( T1DM ) are, based on glucose testing, or the presence of unequivocal 
hyperglycemia with acute metabolic decompensation (diabetic ketoacidosis ).  One of the following 
criteria must be met on two occasions as soon as possible but no less than one day apart for 
diabetes to be defined:  
1. Symptoms of diabetes plus casual plasma glucose concentration >  200 mg/dL (11.1 
mmol/l). Casual is defined as any time of day without regard to time since last meal. 
The classic symptoms of diabetes include polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight 
loss.  
 
2. Fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/l).  Fasting is defined as no caloric 
intake for at least 8 hours.  
 
3. 2 hour plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/l). The test should be performed using 
a glucose load containing the equivalent of 1.75g/kg body weight to a maximum of [ADDRESS_51442] one of the two testing occasions involve an OGTT.   
Cases identified will be confirmed as having diabetes if the glucose values to make these 
determinations w ere obtained in a TrialNet laboratory as part of an OGTT.   Cases diagnosed with 
diabetes by [CONTACT_48986] >200mg/ dL or by [CONTACT_48987].  
8.[ADDRESS_51443] of teplizumab versus control on the risk of diabetes 
onset in the target population as defined by [CONTACT_48988].    
The cumulative incidence of diabetes onset over time since randomization within each treatment 
group will be estimated using the Kaplan- Meier method (proportion surviving diabetes -free as a 
function of time).  The difference between groups in the cumulative incidence functions, and the 
 TrialNet Protocol: TN10 Anti -CD3 Prevention         Protocol Version:  25Jun [ADDRESS_51444] functions, will be tested at the 0.025 level, one- sided, using the Cox Proportional 
Hazards (PH) model , stratified by [CONTACT_48989] (confirmed abnormal or not) at prior to 
randomization  (35, 36).  The estimates of cumulative incidence of diabetes and the test will be 
adjusted for age at enrollment.  The relative risk of diabetes onset between groups will be estimated 
from the PH model.  The critical values will be determined by [CONTACT_48990]- sequential procedure outlined 
in the section entitled Interim Monitoring Plan below.  
 
8.3  Secondary Outcomes and Analyses  
 
A variety of secondary analyses are planned, some of which will include the following.  
 
1. Subgroup analyses will be conducted comparing the effects of teplizumab versus control on 
the risk of diabetes within subsets of the study cohort . Subgroups of the populat ion will be classified 
by [CONTACT_654] ( stratum ) gender, race/ethnicity, specific antibody status at baseline, and presence or absence 
of HLA DQB1*0602. Differences in the treatment effect between subgroups will be tested using a 
covariate by  [CONTACT_48991] a PH model .  
 
Similar analyses will be conducted using the values of quantitative baseline factors including 
weight, BMI, a nd the immunologic and metabolic factors described in Section 5 that include the 
autoantibody titers, basal C -peptide, OGTT stimulated C -peptide (peak and AUC mean), and 
measures of insulin resistance modeled from the OGTT. The treatment effect  within  the quantitative 
levels of each factor will be assessed through a covariate by [CONTACT_48992] a PH 
model. Such an analysis will also be conducted to assess the effects of age as quantitative covariate.  
 
Additional covariates may be defined during the conduct of the study. The reporting of the 
analyses will distinguish between factors specified prior to primary analysis and those identified post -
hoc during analysis.  
2. Longitudinal analyses will assess the effects of tepli zumab versus control treatment on 
immunologic and metabolic markers over time up to the onset of diabetes. Differences between 
groups in the mean levels of quantitative factors over time will be assessed using a normal errors 
linear model for repeated meas ures. Differences between groups in the prevalence of qualitative 
factors over time will be assessed using generalized estimating equations for categorical measures. Generalized estimating equations may also be employed for the analysis of quantitative fac tors when 
the normal errors assumptions are violated ( 37).   
  
Once a subject develops diabetes, the subject will have reached the primary outcome of the 
study. However, the subject may still be followed for assessment of other outcomes that will permit continued longitudinal assessment of metabolic and immunologic parameters. This requirement may 
be satis fied through participation in another study in TrialNet.  
 
3.  The association of demographic, genetic, immunologic, metabolic, and lifestyle factors, amon g 
others, both at baseline and over time, with the risk of diabetes onset will be assessed in Cox PH 
Models over time. The effects of changes in longitudinal factors on diabetes risk will be assessed 
using time -dependent covariates for these factors. Analy ses will be conducted separately within the 
treatment and control groups, and differences between groups in covariate effects (group by 
[CONTACT_48993]) will be assessed.

 8.4  Study Power and Sample Size  
 
Applying the eligibility criteria for this s tudy to the data from the Natural History Study (TN -01), h azard 
and accrual rates were estimated from the TrialNet Natural History/ Pathway to Prevention Study 
(PTP; TN -01) for the three eligible strat a: 1) ages 8 -17 with a confirmed abnormal OGTT , 2) ages 8 -
17 with an abnormal OGTT that is not confirmed, (expanded eligibility criteria), and 3) 18 or older with 
a confirmed abnormal OGTT.  Assum ptions  included a constant risk over time and 25% probability of 
agreeing to participate .  For those subjects that never received a confirmatory OGTT in the PTP study 
we presumed they are divided by [CONTACT_48994] [ADDRESS_51445] rates from the PTP data. That is, for the 8 -
17 age groups the 3 strata: a) Abnormal OGTT confirmed: HR=0.1771 and accrual rate: 14.6 (35% by 
[CONTACT_48995]) b) Abnorm al but no confirmatory test: HR =0.3370 and accrual rate: 14.1 (33% by [CONTACT_48995]) c) 
Abnormal OGTT followed by [CONTACT_48996]: HR=0.1222 and accrual rate: 13.5 (32% by [CONTACT_48995]) were 
weighted to derive the hazard rates for strata 1 and 2. In a similar manner the accrual for 8- 17 age 
groups was determi ned yielding: 22.0 and 20.3 (multiplied by 0.25, probability of agreeing to 
participate) for strata [ADDRESS_51446] size for this trial is a 6 0% reduction in 
the risk of T1DM  (i.e., hazard ratio of experi mental to control  equals  0.4). This reduction in risk 
translates into a median time to T1DM  of 7.52, 8.93,  and 10.6 years for the teplizumab group for 
strata 1, 2 , and 3 , respectively  (the increase is 4.51, 5.36,  and 6.34 years , respectively) .  These 
design characteristics are displayed in the graph below.

 TrialNet Protocol: TN10 Anti -CD3 Prevention         Protocol Version:  25Jun [ADDRESS_51449] may be conducted.  
Although group sequential testing will be employed, the me thod of Lan and DeMets maintains the 
power while controlling the type I error used in determining the fixed sample size.   
 
Participants <18yo will undergo an OGTT prior to the first infusion. The results of this study will be 
incorporated into the analysi s of the primary outcome variable but will not be used to determine 
eligibility for the study . The study sample size and duration are variable when fixing the “event” 
sample size. In the absence of any safety concerns and evoking any stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], closin g accrual 
should not occur until sufficient participants are accrued so that projections (based on the observed 
T1DM rates and the actual accrual pattern) indicate that within a reasonable follow -up period the 
event sample size will be achieved.  The const ant hazard rate assumption is retained to compute the 
initial projection.  The projected a nnual accrual i s 5.5, 5.1  and 1.6 for strata 1, 2 and 3,  respectively.   
Allowing for a 5% per year drop -out rate and the approximately [ADDRESS_51450] to achieve a statistical power of 80%  (39). 
 
 
 
 
 
Note the accrual period and the study sample size are only projections since the actual accrual rate, the control hazard rate and the loss to follow -up rate are estimates from the PTP Study or other  
similar trials .  Furthermore, the over -all hazard rate is sensitive to the age distribution of the  enrolled 
study population which is also an approximation. As the study progresses, projections of the study 
duration will be com puted based on the observed data (noncomparative treatment analysis)  and if in 
conflict, will be brought to the attention of  the DSMB and the TrialNet governing body  to determine 
the best course of action.  
 
 
  
8.5 Interim Monitoring Plan 
 
Interim analyses will be conducted when 50% of the expected number of cases of T1DM have been 
observed and will be reviewed by [CONTACT_48997] (DSMB) for 
assessment of effectiveness and safety. The same primary endpoint analysis described above will be 
used to evaluate the evidence of a treatment group effect during interim analyses.  The Wald test 
from the PH model will be transformed to a z -score (with neg ative values indicating a reduction in risk 
in the teplizumab treated group).  If a group sequential stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_48948], the DSMB may terminate the trial early.   The Lan and DeMets ( 40) spending function with an O’Brien- Fleming 
boundary will be used to protect the type I error probability for the primary outcome analyses, and to 
assess the significance of the interim results periodically during the trial.  The spending function (
1α) 
that approximates the O’Brien- Fleming boundaries is:

 where *t is the information fraction (*01t<≤ ) and α is the fixed- sample type I error (i.e., 0.025).  
 
The DSMB will also be informed if t here is a serious lack of evidence of a treatment effect (i.e. futility 
analysis). The boundaries are based on the paper by [CONTACT_48998] ( 41).  The study should be stopped 
based on the futility of rejecting the null hypothesis at the completion of the trial if: *() 0HRZt≥ when 
*0.5  0.8 t≤<  or if *( ) 0.8HRZt≥−  when *0.8t≥ .   
 Using Lachin’s formulas  a onetime use of either boundary for the design parameters above 
(11 2.8 ZZαβθ−−≡+= ) raises  the type II error  to approximately 0.204 and 0.202, respectively.  For  
larger values of *t the increase to the error probability is even less.  Furthermore,  by [CONTACT_48999]  a single use of each rule will increase the type II error no more than  the sum of the 
increase (i.e., 0.15[PHONE_859][PHONE_860] = 0.156 ).   
 
Additional analysis will assess potential adverse outcomes of treatment and will assess the incidence 
of all severe adverse events.  
 
8.6. Withdrawal Criteria - Individual Subjects  
 An intent –to-treat approach will be used. Subjects will not be replaced.  All data acquired pri or to 
termination for the reasons outlined below will be included in the primary analysis unless patient 
withdraws consent. Every effort will be made to conduct a final study visit with the participant and 
participants will be followed clinically until, if  applicable, all adverse events resolve.  
 
• Withdrawal of consent  
• Withdrawal by [CONTACT_2299]  
• Withdrawal by [CONTACT_093]   
• Intercurrent illness or event that precludes further visits to the study site or ability to evaluate 
disease

9. ETHICAL CONSIDERA TIONS AND COMPLIANCE WITH GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICE  
 
9.1. Statement of Compliance  
 
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol and consistent with current Good Clinical 
Practices (GCP), adopting the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and all applicable regulatory 
requirements ( ICH E6, 45CFR46, and FDA 21CFR sections 11, 50, 56, 312) . 
 
Prior to study initiation, the protocol and the informed consent documents will be reviewed and 
approved by [CONTACT_49000] /Resear ch Ethics Board (IEC/REB ) or 
Institutional Review Board (IRB).  Any amendments to the protocol or consent materials must also be approved before they are implemented.  
 
9.2. Participating Centers  
 
Participating TrialNet clinical sites must have an appropriate as surance, such as a Federal -wide 
Assurance (FWA) or an Unaffiliated Investigators Agreement (UIA), with the Office for Human 
Research Protections (OHRP), since they are actively engaged in research and provide informed 
consent.  The protocol and consent for ms will be approved by [CONTACT_49001] /Research Ethics Boards  at each of the participating clinical sites.  HIPAA  and applicable 
local regulations will be followed by [CONTACT_49002] i nstitution’s 
requirements.  The participating international sites will obtain approval from their corresponding 
review boards in accordance with their local procedures and institutional requirements.  
 The investigator is required to keep accurate records t o ensure the conduct of the study is fully 
documented.  The investigator is required to ensure that all source documentation is legibly 
completed for every participant entered in the trial.  
 
The investigational sites participating in this study will maintain the highest degree of confidentiality 
permitted for the clinical and research information obtained from participants participating in this 
study.  When a subject participates in this study at more than one TrialNet site, sharing of t his 
information is required. Medical and research records will  be maintained at each site in the strictest 
confidence.  However, as a part of the quality assurance and legal responsibilities of an investigation, 
the investigational site must permit authori zed representatives of the sponsor(s) and regulatory 
agencies to examine (and when required by [CONTACT_1289], to copy) records for the purposes of quality assurance reviews, audits and evaluation of the study safety and progress.  Unless required 
by [CONTACT_941] l aws permitting copying of records, only the coded identity associated with documents or other 
participant data may be copi[INVESTIGATOR_530] (obscuring any personally identifying information).  Authorized 
representatives , as noted above,  are bound to maintain the strict c onfidentiality of medical and 
research information that may be linked to identify individuals.  The investigational site will normally be notified in advance of auditing visits.

 9.3. Informed Consent  
 
The process of assuring that individuals (and parent/g uardian if less than 18 years of age) are making 
an informed decision about participating in this study includes both verbal and written communication.  Written material s include a Pa rticipant  Handbook and written consent forms.  There are several  
consent forms for this study.  One is a S creening consent form that describes the procedures, risks, 
and benefits, and eligibility requirements for the study.  The second is the I ntervention consent form, 
which describes the procedures, risks, and benefits for the remainder of the study.  A third consent 
form is for use at clinical sites that will be performing the post -treatment visits, but not the treatment 
visits.  The consent form s will be reviewed with participants (and their guardian in the case of 
participants under 18 years of age) and the participant will be given time to review the written consent 
form and ask questions.  An assent form has also been developed for participants less than 18 years of age (unless local IRB requirements diff er in procedure).  
 As part of the informed consent process, the participant and/or parent or guardian (if the participant is 
less than 18 years of age) will also be required to complete a short, written Volunteer Understanding 
Quiz that is designed to ens ure that the subject understands the study, as well as what is being asked 
of him/her. The participant will be given a copy of their signed consent/assent forms.   
 The consent process will be conducted by [CONTACT_9260] (the Trial or Study Coor dinator 
and/or Investigator or other designee).  All participants (or their legally acceptable representative) must read, sign and date a consent form prior to participation in the study, and/or undergoing any 
study -specific procedures.  
 
The informed consent form must be updated or revised whenever there is new, clinically significant  
information applicable to the safety of the participants,  when indicated for a protocol amendment, 
and/or whenever any new information becomes available that may affect a patient’s participation in 
the study.    
 
Subjects will be re- consented if they reach the age of [ADDRESS_51451]’s information for internal use at the clinical sites wi ll be secured 
at the study site during the study. Identifying study subject information may be shared between TrialNet clinical sites that are involved in study procedures and/or oversight of the participant. At the 
end of the study, all records will conti nue to be kept in a secure location. There are no plans to 
destroy the records.  
 
Study subject data, which is for reporting purposes, will be stored at The TrialNet  Coordinating 
Center.  Data sent to the Coordinating Center will identify participants by [CONTACT_3433] e unique TrialNet 
Identification Num ber. The data entry system at the Coordinating Center is a secured, password 
protected computer system.  At the end of the study, all study databases will be archived at the 
Coordinating Center  for long- term storage.  De-identified safety data will be shared  with MacroGenics 
during the course of the study so the company may meet its regulatory reporting requirements as the drug manufacturer and IND sponsor.  Additional de- identified data will be shared with MacroGenics at 
the end of the study.

 Stored samples including genetic samples could be utilized to learn more about causes of type 1 
diabetes, its complications (such as eye, nerve, and kidney damage) and other conditions for which 
individuals with diabetes are at increased risk, and how to improve treatm ent.  The results of these 
future analyses , and any mechanistic studies  will not be made known to the participant.

9.5. Risks and Benefits  
 
The risks of this study are presented in this protocol, the Investigator’s Brochure and informed 
consent form.  There i s no guaranteed benefit to subjects for their participation in the study.  This 
study will examine whether intervention with teplizumab will delay or prevent the onset of diabetes , 
but there is no guarantee that this will occur.   However, all subjects will benefit from close monitoring 
for the development of diabetes.  This close monitoring significantly reduces the morbidity typi[INVESTIGATOR_48949].  
 Special consideration regarding risks and benefits for children is described in section 2.5. 
 
9.6. Ethics  
 
The study protocol, along with the required informed consent forms, will be approved by [CONTACT_49003]’s Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Committee/Research Ethics Board  
(EC/REB ) at international sites  prior to the initiation of any research procedures (at the site) . In 
addition to details described in the sections above (informed consent, confidentiality, and risks and 
benefits) the investigators have reviewed and considered ethical ramifications in the desi gn and 
development of this protocol. The investigators have made every effort to minimize and monitor risks 
and discomforts to participants throughout the course of the study.

10.    STUDY ADMINISTRATION  
 
10.1.  Organizational Structure  
 
This study is part of Type 1 Diabetes TrialNet, which is funded by [CONTACT_7681].  
Funding will cover the costs of administration and laboratory tests associated with this study during the participant’s period of follow -up.  
 
10.2.  Role of Industry  
 
The IND holder is M acroGenics, Inc.  MacroGenics will provide teplizumab and placebo for the study 
and financial support for clinical trial monitoring supplemental to standard TrialNet procedures.  Eli 
Lilly and Company holds an exclusive license from MacroGenics to develop and commercialize 
teplizumab. Under TrialNet’s direction, MacroGenics will perform measurements such as PK and anti -
teplizumab antibodies as indicated on coded samples.  Data and data analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_49004].  
 
10.3.  Groups and Commit tees 
 
10.3.1.  Anti-CD3 Prevention Study Chair  
 
The Study Chair and TrialNet executive committee will receive periodic reports from the TNCC on the 
progress of the study.  These will include accrual rates and baseline demographic characteristics. 
Interim data summaries provided to others (except those that could lead to unmasking of the 
treatment arms) will first be supplied to the Study Chair for review. Criteria and results of ongoing 
monitoring of the TrialNet labs in terms of reproducibility  will also be provided on a routine basis and 
reported on during Anti -CD3 Prevention Study Committee meetings, as scheduled. As appropriate, 
abstracts and manuscripts dealing with the progress of the trial shall be directed by [CONTACT_49005].  
 
10.3.2.  TrialNet Chairman’s Office and TrialNet Coordinating Center  
 
The TrialNet Chairman’s Office and TNCC will work together in providing leadership to the TrialNet 
study group to include protocol and manual preparation, training for clinical sites, development of statistical design for each study, and analysis of study results.  The TNCC will also coordinate 
interactions among the participating TrialNet clinical centers, test laboratories including TrialNet core 
laboratories and other subcontract laboratories, NIDDK, and other sponsoring  agencies.  
 
10.3.3.  Clinical Sites  
 
Each Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_48950].  The clinical sites will forward all laboratory and data collection form information to the TNCC for 
analysis.  Co nference calls and site visits, as needed, will facilitate evaluation of the trial 
management.   Certain TrialNet sites will be involved in recruitment and follow up of subjects and 
some sites will also administer study drug.  
 
 TrialNet Protocol: TN10 Anti -CD3 Prevention         Protocol Version:  25Jun [ADDRESS_51452].  All sites will be monitored by [CONTACT_49006], compliance with protocol procedures, 
completeness and accuracy of data entered on the case report forms (CRFs), and the occurrence 
and reporting of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs).   
 
10.4.  Medical Monitor and Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB)  
 
All adverse events will be recorded on the adverse event forms, which will be sent to the local IRBs, 
per their reporting requirements, and to the TNCC  according to repor ting guidelines .  
 
An independent physician will be designated to serve as the medical monitor for this study who will 
maintain regular contact [CONTACT_49007].   (S)he will review all adverse event 
reports, masked to treatment assignment , and will file event reports with regulatory authorities as 
appropriate.    
 The DSMB will meet approximately every [ADDRESS_51453] eering Committee and the NIDDK would be required before such linkage 
could occur.  Researchers from outside of TrialNet will not be permitted to identify samples.  
 
Data collected for this study will be sent to the TNCC.  After the study is completed, the safety study 
data will be sent to MacroGenics  by [CONTACT_49008].   
 TrialNet Protocol: TN10 Anti -CD3 Prevention         Protocol Version:  25Jun 14 
 
Page 44 of 50 
 De-identified data will be stored at the NIDDK Repository, under the supervision of the NIDDK/NIH, 
for use by [CONTACT_49009].  
 
When TrialNet is completed, samples will continue to be stored at the NIDDK Repository Sites.  Since 
the stored data will be fully de- identified upon the completion of TrialNet, it will no longer be possible 
to identify samples.  Thus, whereas a sample can be destroyed upon a participant’s request during 
the existence of the TrialNet, it can no longer be destroyed once TrialNet is completed.  However, 
there will still be the potential to link data derived from the samples with data that had been derived 
from TrialNet studies.  Once TrialNet is completed, researchers will only obtain access to samples 
through grant proposals approved by [CONTACT_49010].  The NIDDK will convene an external panel of experts to review requests for access to samples.  
 
10.6.  Preservation of the Integrity of the Study  
 
The scientific integrity of the trial dictates that results be reported on a study -wide basis; thus, an 
individual Center will not report the data collected from its site alone.  All presentations and 
publications using TrialNet trial data must protect the main objectives of the trial.  Data that could be 
perceived as threatening the study outcome will not be presented prior to release of the primary study 
outcomes.  Approval as to the timing of presentations of data and the meetings at which they might 
be presented will be g ranted by [CONTACT_49011].  Study results should be discussed 
with the news media only upon authorization of the Steering Committee, and never before the results are presented.   Any written statements about this study that are shared with national media must  be 
approved by [CONTACT_49012].  
 
10.7.  Participant Reimbursement and Compensation 
 
Participants will be compensated for each visit attended in the study.

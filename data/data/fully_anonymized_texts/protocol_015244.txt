1.1 Synopsis  
Protocol Title:  Phase 2 , Randomized, 3-Period , Placebo -Controlled Crossover Study to Evaluate 
the Efficacy and Safety in Obstructive Sleep Apnea of AD036  versus Placebo or Atomoxetine  
Sponsor Stu dy No.:  APN -006 
Phase : 2 
Sponsor:  Apnimed, Inc.  
Rationale : 
AD036 is a new fixed -dose combination of atomoxetine and oxybutynin being deve loped for the 
treatment of obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ). Study APN -006 is designed to confirm and extend 
safety and efficacy findings from the Study APN -002, a Phase 2  study  of AD036 in OSA .  
Overall Design : 
Patients who participated in Study APN -[ADDRESS_1145889] increased 
responsiveness to AD036  (based on Study APN -002 findings) , will be planned for enrollment .  
The study is a three -period single -dose randomized crossover design in which patients will 
undergo overnight home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) with dosing of one of the following 3 
treatments:   
• Atomoxetine 80 mg + oxybutyni n 5 mg  
• Atomoxetine 80 mg + placebo  
• Placebo + placebo  
A 1-week minimum washout period will occur between each of the 3 crossover HSAT nights. 
The primary hypothesis is that the AD036 combination of atomoxetine and oxybutynin is 
superior to placebo  on apnea hypopnea index (AHI).  Superiority of the AD036 combination to 
atomoxetine  is a key secondary efficacy endpoint.  
Number of Participant s: 
A total of 54 participants are planned for enroll ment .  
Study Duration : 
The overall study duration will be  up to 10 weeks , as follows :  
• Screening , up to 4 weeks ;  
• 3-period crossover, approximately 5 weeks ; 
• End of study evaluation,  1 week after  end of crossover period

15 September  2020  7 of 45 V3.0 2 Introduction  
2.1 Study Rationale  
AD036 is a new fixed -dose combination of atomoxetine and oxybutynin being developed for the 
treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Study APN -006 is designed to confirm and extend 
safety and efficacy findings from the Phase 2 Study APN -002 of AD036 in OSA, as follows:   
• In Study APN -002 efficacy of AD036 in reducing key measures of OSA severity 
including apnea -hypopnea index (AHI) and oxygen desaturation index (ODI) was 
correlated with certain patient baseline characteristics including those assessed by  
[CONTACT_25899] (PSG). Study APN -[ADDRESS_1145893] increased 
responsiveness to AD036. New patients not previously screened in Study APN -002 who 
meet these criteria can also be enrolled in Study APN -006.  
• There was evidence that the higher -dose formulation of AD036 (atomoxetine 75 
mg/oxybutynin 5 mg) in Study APN -002 was superior to formulations of AD036 
composed of lower dose combinations of atomoxetine and oxybutynin. However, 
comparison was not made of the combination of atomoxetine and oxybutynin to the 
individual components (i.e. atomoxetine alone or oxybutynin alone) which would more 
clearly establish the contribution of each component drug to the effica cy of the 
combination. Study APN -006 will compare the efficacy of AD036 (composed of 
commercially available formulations of atomoxetine 80 mg and oxybutynin 5 mg) in 
OSA to the efficacy of atomoxetine [ADDRESS_1145894] common  and serious of these sleep disorders and affects 
approximately 20 million people in the  [LOCATION_002] ( US), with approximately 13% of men and 
6% of women affected (Peppard et al, 2013) . OSA is characterized  by [CONTACT_203781] 
‘obstruction’ of the pharyngeal airway during sleep, manifesting  as repe titive epi[INVESTIGATOR_203751] (i.e., shallow breathing) or apnea (i.e., paused  breathing).  These epi[INVESTIGATOR_203752],  sleep fragmentation, excessive daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], 
and/or neuropsychological  impairment.  

Apnimed, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol APN -006/IND  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
15 September  2020  8 of 45 V3.0 Research h as shown that a number of pathogenic factors, or traits, contribute to  the development 
of OSA (Eckert et al, 2013; Wellman et al, 2011; Wellman et al, 2013;Younes, 2003) . The most 
important factors are the presence of  an anatomically small, collapsible upp er airway and a loss 
of pharyngeal muscle tone  or responsiveness during  sleep.  
Long -term, OSA is associated with increased mortality and a number of  adverse cardiovascular , 
neurocognitive, metabolic, and daytime functional consequences  (Somers  et al, 1995 ; Nieto  et al, 
2000; Brooks  et al, 1997 ; Peppard  et al, 2000 ; Hung  et al, 1990 ; Wessendorf  et al, 2000 ; Hoffstein, 1994 ; 
Shahar et al, 2001 ; Redline et al, 1997 ; Findley  et al, 1988) . 
2.2.[ADDRESS_1145895] pressure (CPAP), provided by a machine that  mechanically maintains an open airway. 
Other treatments, such as pharyngeal surgery,  mandibular advancement devices, and implantable 
nerve stimulators, were developed to address  the anatomical predisposition to collapse; however, 
they have shown limited efficacy  for niche  populations.  
While CPAP and related therapi[INVESTIGATOR_77221] e effective in improving sleep characteristics  and 
oxygenation, many, perhaps most, patients find these devices uncomfortable or intolerable, and 
most estimates indicate that fewer than 50% of patients prescribed  CPAP  use it more than 4 hours 
per night, if  at all (Weaver and Sawyer, 2010) . Efforts to develop  pharmacologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such 
as antidepressants, stimulants, and hormonal agents, for the treatment  of OSA have been ongoing 
for at least 20 years, with no success thus  far. 
As many patients cannot use  CPAP because they find it intolerable, this represents  a significant 
health concern, as OSA is associated with numerous co -morbidities  and increased mortality. 
Alternative options, such as drugs that activate the  pharyngeal muscles are  needed.  
2.2.3 Biological Rationale  
AD036 is a new fixed dose drug combination of atomoxetine and oxybutynin being developed for 
OSA. Atomoxetine is a pre -synaptic norepi[INVESTIGATOR_826151]. Oxybutynin is an antispasmodic 
drug that inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle and is indicated for the 
treatment of symptoms of bladder instability associated with voiding in patients with uninhibited 
neurogenic or reflex neurogenic bladder such as urgency, frequency, urinary leakage, urge 
incontinence  and dysuria.   
Efficacy and safety of AD036 for the signs and symptoms of OSA was recently evaluated in 
Apnimed’s Phase 2 Study APN -002. There was evidence fr om this study that the high -dose 

Apnimed, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol APN -006/IND  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
15 September  2020  9 of 45 V3.0 formulation of AD036 (atomoxetine 75 mg/oxybutynin 5 mg) was superior to formulations of 
AD036 composed of lower dose combinations of atomoxetine and oxybutynin, and to placebo. 
Efficacy of AD036 in OSA was correlated with certain patient baseline characteristics including 
those assessed by [CONTACT_63175]. Study APN -[ADDRESS_1145896] increased responsiveness to AD036, will be planned for enrollment.  
Objective OSA inclusion criteria for patients who participated in Study APN -002 will be 
determined based on the  Study APN -002 baseline PSG exam  (applies also to patients who were 
screen ed but did not meet the study PSG criteria ).  Objective OSA inclusion criteria for new 
patients can be based  on a previous full night PSG or  HSAT conducted  at the site within 4 
month s prior  to enrollment . If such results are not available, a screening HSAT may be conducted 
during the screening period, but  such testing  generally should be limited to patients with  Endpoints

[ADDRESS_1145897] results  (e.g. previous sleep study o utside 4 -month window ) 
indicating the patient is still likely to meet objective OSA study enrollment criteria.   
There are 3 randomized crossover HSAT nights. Each HSAT night is followed by a 1 -week 
washout period. Dosing of the study treatment will occur immediately prior to bedtime.  Patients 
will be randomized to treatment sequence with one of the following experimental treatments on 
each HSAT  night:  
• Atomoxetine 80 mg + oxybutynin 5 mg  
• Atomoxetine 80 mg + placebo  
• Placebo + placebo  
Site personnel will contact [CONTACT_826160] -call each HSAT night to 
assist with HSAT equipment use and to confirm study drug dosing.  
Participants will b e contact[CONTACT_826161] -call during each washout period 
to collect  AE/SAE and concomitant medication information.  
Overall study duration will be up to 10 weeks. Participants who withdraw from the study will not 
be replaced. No subsequent open -label extension is planned following the study.

drug.  
4.3 Justification for Dose  
The dose of AD036 in this study is the same or similar to the doses used in previous clinical 
studies that provided support for both the safety and efficacy of AD036 in OSA.   
The study uses a dose of 80 mg atomoxetine (either alone or in combination with 5 mg 
oxybutynin). Previous single -dose crossover studies of the PK, safety, and efficacy of AD03 [ADDRESS_1145899] demonstrated that this dosing is safe and well tolerated in the single -dose crossover setting.  
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of AD036  is 
provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.

15 September  2020  21 of 45 V3.0 8.1.1 Home Sleep Apnea Testing (HSAT)  
• Methods : Standard HSAT recording and data interpretation will be performed in accordance 
with the American Academy of Sleep Medicine  (AASM) scoring manual  for respi[INVESTIGATOR_826152] . EEG activity will be estimated from frontal derivations. Screening HSAT for new 
patients may be conducted without estimation of EEG activity.  
• Time of lights out will be according to the participant s’ habitual schedule and kept constant 
across the HSAT study nights.  
• Sites will instruct participants on proper use of HSAT device at screening visit.  
• Sites will contact [CONTACT_826165] . 
• Scoring: For uses other than establishing that the patients meets study enrollment  criteria , all 
HSATs will be scored by [CONTACT_826166] s who are separate from the clinical  care 
team.  
8.2 Safety Assessments  
• Planned time points for all adverse events assessments are provided in the SoA.  
• Safety monitoring will be guided by [CONTACT_203787] , and by [CONTACT_7609] 1  and 2  safety data for the combi nation , and will include 
monitoring and recording of AEs , SAEs , and recording of study or treatment 
discontinuations. Effects on  OSA will also be monitored by [CONTACT_826167] . 
8.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
The definitions of AEs and SAEs can be found in Appendix  3. 
Adverse event s will be reported by [CONTACT_2299] (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, 
surrogate, or the participant's legally authorized representative).  
The Investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following 
up on AEs that are serious, considered related to the study treatment  or the study, or that caused 
the participant to discontinue the study and/or study treatment  (see Section  7). 
8.3.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collectin g AE and SAE Information  
All AEs and SAEs will be collected from the signing of informed consent form ( ICF) until the 
end of the study .  

Apnimed, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol APN -006/IND  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
15 September  2020  22 of 45 V3.0 All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the S ponsor or designee within 24 hours . The 
Investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24  hours of it being 
available.  
Investigators are not obligated  to actively seek AEs or SAEs after the conclusion of study 
participation. However, if the Investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after 
a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably 
related to the study treatment  or study participation, the Investigator must promptly notify the 
Sponsor . 
The method of recording, evaluating, and asses sing causality of AEs and SAEs and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix  3. 
8.3.2 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE  
occurrence.  
8.3.3 Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactively follow each participant 
at subsequent contacts. All SAEs  will be followed until resolution, stabilization, until the event is 
otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up. Further information on follo w-up 
procedures is given in Appendix  3. 
8.3.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAE s 
• Prompt notification (within 24 hours, see Appendix  3) by [CONTACT_203789] a study treatment  under clinic al investigation are met.  
• The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study treatment  under clinical investigation. The 
Sponsor will comply with country -specific r egulatory requirements relating to safety 
reporting to the regulatory authority, IRB/Independent Ethics Committees (IEC), and 
Investigators.  
• Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) according t o local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and 
forwarded to Investigators as necessary.  

Apnimed, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol

15 September  2020  24 of 45 V3.0 9 Statistical Considerations  and Sample Size Determination  
The efficacy of AD036 in OSA was investigated in Apnimed Study APN -002. Patients in Study 
APN -006 will be selected based on baseline objective OSA criteria that, from the results of Study 
APN -002, are thought to enrich for patients more likely to be responders . A total of 54 patients ( 9 
per sequence) will enter th e 3-treatment crossover study. The study will have 90% power to 
detect a t reatment difference at a two -sided 0.[ADDRESS_1145912] deviation is 12, 
estimated from Study APN -002 using a subset of 92 subjects with baseline Fhypopnea  ≥65%.  
Subjects will be randomized to one of the following 6 sequences:  A – B – C, B – C – A, C – B – 
A, A – C – B, B – A – C, C – A – B.  This design is both uniform within sequences (each 
treatment appears the same number of times within each sequence) and uniform within periods 
(each treatment appears the same number of times within each period).  These properties result in 
neither the sequence nor the period effects being aliased with the treatment effect. Furthermore, 
the inclusion of a  washout period is believed to minimize any carryover effect, or at the 
minimum, the carryover effect is believed to be equal among all treatments and therefore would 
not be aliased with the estimation of the treatment effect. The above design also assures  that each 
treatment is preceded by [CONTACT_826168].

review protocol compliance, com pare EDC/eCRF entries and individual participant ’s medical 
records, assess drug accountability, and ensure that the study is being conducted according to 
pertinent regulatory requirements. The EDC/eCRF entries will be verified with source 
documentation. The review of medical records will be performed in a manner to ensure that 
participant confidentiality is maintained.  
Checking of the EDC/eCRF entries for completeness and clarity, and cross -checking with source 
documents, will be required to monitor the progress of the study. Moreover, regulatory 
authorities of certain countries, IRBs, IECs, and/or the Sponsor’s Clinical Quality Assurance 
Group may wish to carry out such source data checks and/or  on-site audit inspections. Direct 
access to source data will be required for these inspections and audits; they will be carried out 
giving due consideration to data protection and medical confidentiality. The Investigator assures 
the CRO and the Sponsor o f the necessary support at all times.

15 September  2020  32 of 45 V3.0 10.3 Appendix  3: AE Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, 
Follow -up, and Reporting  
Definition of AE  
AE Definition  
• An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant  or clinical study participant, 
temporally associated with the use of a study treatment , whether or not considered related 
to the medicinal product.  
• NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding) , symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a study treatment . 
 
Events Meeting  the AE Definition  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments ( e.g., ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical 
and scientific judgment of the Investigator (i .e., not related to progression of underlying 
disease).  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment  administration even though it 
may have been pr esent before the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment  
or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se wi ll not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it 
is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -harming intent. Such overdoses 
should be reported regardless of sequelae.  
• "Lack of efficacy" or "failure of expected pharmacological action" per se will not be 
reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. 
However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will 
be reported as an AE or SAE if they fulfil l the definition of an AE or  SAE.  
 

Apnimed, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol APN -006/IND  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
15 September  2020  33 of 45 V3.0 Events NOT  Meeting the AE Definition  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_13142]’s condition.  
• The disease/di sorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s 
condition.  
• Medical or surgical procedure ( e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that lead s to 
the procedure is the AE.  
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the st art of the study that do not worsen.  
 
Definition of SAE  
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions 
are met ( e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1080]/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to 
progression of disease).  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
Results in death  
Is life -threatening  
The term 'life-threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the 
participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
Requires inpa tient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12993], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19949] (usually involving at 
least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or treatment  that 
would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient  setting. Complications 
that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_42244]. If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_97193], the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” 
occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE.  
Results in persistent disability/incapacity  

Apnimed, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol APN -006/IND  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
15 September  2020  34 of 45 V3.0 • The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal 
life functions.  
• This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicate d headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and 
accidental trauma ( e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life 
functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Other situati ons 
• Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is 
appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_826153]. These events should usually be considered serious.  
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias , or convulsions that 
do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Recording and Follow -up of AE and SAE  
AE and SAE Record ing 
• When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the  Investigator to review all 
documentation ( e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory, and diagnostics reports) related to 
the event.  
• The Investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the eCRF.  
• It is not acceptable for the Investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914]’s medical 
records in lieu of completion of the AE/SAE eCRF page.  
• There may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_826154]’s . In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant 
number, will be blinded on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_826155]’s  Clinical Studies Safety Center . 

Apnimed, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol APN -006/IND  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
15 September  2020  35 of 45 V3.0 • The I nvestigator will attempt to establish a diag nosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.  
Assessment of Intensity  
The I nvestigator will make an assessment of intensi ty for each AE and SAE reported during 
the study and assign it to one of the following categories:  
• Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_2299], causing minimal discomfort and 
not interfering with everyday activities.  
• Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal everyday 
activities.  
• Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as severe 
should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the intens ity 
of an event; and both AE and SAE can be assessed as severe.  
An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least one of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.  
 
Assessment of Causality  
• The I nvestigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study treatment  and each 
occurrence of each AE/SAE.  
• A "reasona ble possibility" of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out.  
• The I nvestigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
• Alterna tive causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment  administration 
will be considered and investigated.  
• The I nvestigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure and/or Product Information, 
for marketed products, in his/her assessment.  
• For each AE/SAE, the I nvestigator must  document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  

Apnimed, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol APN -006/IND  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
15 September  2020  36 of 45 V3.0 • There may be situations in whi ch an SAE has occurred and the I nvestigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the CRO . However, it is very important that 
the I nvestigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before  the 
initial transmission of the SAE data to the CRO . 
• The I nvestigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up information 
and send an SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment.  
• The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements.  
 
Follow -up of AE and SAE  
• The I nvestigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_941] C RO to 
elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may 
include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or 
consultation with other health care professionals.  
• If a participant dies d uring participation in the study the Investigator will provide the CRO  
with a copy of any post -mortem findings including histopathology . 
• New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed eCRF.  
• The I nvestigator will submit any updated SAE data to the CRO within 24 hours of receipt 
of the information.  
 
Reporting of SAE to CRO   
SAE Reporting to CRO   
Via EDC  Tool 
• The Investigator must report any SAEs to the CRO  within 24 hours of becoming aware of 
the event.  
• When calling to report an SAE, state that you are reporting an SAE and give the 
Investigator’s name, your name, the telephone number where you can be reached, and the 
protocol number and title . 

Apnimed, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol APN -006/IND  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
15 September  2020  37 of 45 V3.0 • The Investigator and the Sponsor (or Sponsor’s designated agent) will review each SAE 
report and the Sponsor/ CRO  will evaluate the seriousness and the causal relationship of the 
event to study treatment . In addition, the Sponsor (or Sponsor’s designated agent) will 
evaluate the expectedness according to the reference document s (Investigator ’s Brochure 
or US product labeling for atomoxetine or oxybutynin ). Based on the Investigator and 
Sponsor’s assessment of the event, a d ecision will be made concerning the need for further 
action . 
• If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data 
on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been taken off -
line, then the  site can report this information on a paper SAE form (see next section) or by 
[CONTACT_756].  
• Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the Study Reference Manual.  
 
All SAEs will be recorded from signing of informed consent until the end of the study  as defined 
in Section 4.4. Serious adverse events occurring after the end of the study and coming to the 
attention of the Investigator must be reported only if they  are considered (in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_684]) causally -related to study treatment . 
 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs)  
Any AE that is serious, associated with the use of the study treatment , and unexpected 
(S[LOCATION_003]R) has additional reporting requirements, as described below.  
• If the S[LOCATION_003]R is fatal or life -threatening, associated with study treatment , and unexpected, 
regulatory  authorities and IECs will be notified within 7 calendar days after th e Sponsor 
learns of the event. Additional follow -up (cause of death, autopsy report, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_490034]) information should be reported within an additional 8 days (15 days total).  
• If the S[LOCATION_003]R is not fatal or life -threatening but is otherwise serious, associated with study 
treatment , and unexpected, regulatory authorities and IECs will be notified within [ADDRESS_1145917] the safety of participants.  Follow -up information may be 
submitted if necessary.  

Apnimed, Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol APN -006/IND  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
15 September  2020  38 of 45 V3.0 The Sponsor will also provide annual safety updates to the regulatory authorities and I ECs 
responsible for the study. These updates will include information on S[LOCATION_003]Rs and other 
relevant safety findings.  
 
10.4 Appendix  4: Contraceptive Guidance and Collection of Pregnancy 
Information  
Definitions  
WOCBP  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal unless 
permanently sterile (see below).  
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP:  
1. Premenarchal  
2. Premenopausal female with one of the following:  
• Documented hysterectomy  
• Documente d bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]  
• Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
NOTE: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
3. Post-menopausal female  
• A post -menopausal stat e is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the post -
menopausal range may be used to confirm a post -menopausal state in women not 
using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in 
the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.  
• Females on HRT  and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one 
of the non -estrogen hormonal highly effective contra ception methods if they wish to 
continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow 
confirmation of post -menopausal status before study enrollment.

agree to ONE of the following during the protocol -defined time frame in Section  5.1: 
• Are abstinent from penile -vaginal intercourse as their usual and preferred lifestyle 
(abstinent on a long -term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent.  
• Agree to use a contracepti ve method with a fail ure rate of <1% per year as described 
in the table below when having penile -vaginal intercourse with a WOCBP who is not 
currently pregnant.  
In addition, male participants must refrain from donating sperm for the duration of the study a nd 
for [ADDRESS_1145918] agree to remain abstinent from 
penile -vaginal intercourse or to use a male condom during each epi[INVESTIGATOR_826156] p rotocol -defined time frame.

Implantable progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation 
• IUD 
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
Vasectomized partner  
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is 
the sole male sexual part ner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If 
not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used.  
Sexual abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment . 
The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relati on to the duration of the 
study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.  
NOTES:  
1 Typi[INVESTIGATOR_35818]. Use should be consistent with 
local regulations regarding the use of c ontraceptive methods for participants participating in clinical studies.  
 
 
Pregnancy Testing  
• WOCBP should only be included after a confirmed menstrual period . and a negative highly 
sensitive serum pregnancy test.  
• Pregnancy testing will be performed wheneve r a menstrual cycle is missed or when 
pregnancy is otherwise suspected.

Female participants who become pregnant  
• The Investigator will  collect pregnancy information on any female participant who becomes 
pregnant while participating in this study. Information will be recorded on the appropriate 
form and submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours  of learning of a participant’s pregnancy. 
The participant will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The Investigator 
will collect any follow up information on the participant and the neonate and the information 
will be forwarded to the Sponsor. Generally, follow up will not be requi red for longer than 6 
to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be 
reported, regardless of fetal state (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the 
procedure.  
• While pregnancy itself is not considered t o be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
elective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or SAE. A spontaneous 
abortion is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such. Any post -study 
pregnancy -related SAE considered re asonably related to the study treatment  by [CONTACT_115032] 8.3.4 . While the 
Investigator i s not obligated to actively seek this information in former study participants, he 
or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.  
• Any female participant who becomes pregnant while participating in the study will be 
withdrawn from the study.

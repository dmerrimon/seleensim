 1  Protocol Synopsis 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Phase II Study of Ofatumumab in Combination with High Dose 
Methylprednisolone followed by [CONTACT_892093]/SLL: The HiLOG trial.  
DATE PROTOCOL FINAL:  June 20, 2011  
INDICATION:  Relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL  
STUDY PHASE:  Phase II 
BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE : Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) , the most 
common leukemia in the Western countries,  is characterized by a progressive 
accumulation of functionally incompetent monoclonal B lymphocytes . CLL is considered 
to be identical (same disease at different stages) to the mature B -cell small lymphocytic 
lymphoma (SLL).(1) CLL is typi[INVESTIGATOR_56388] a disease of the elderly, with a median 
age at diagnosis of 72 years.(2, 3) The disease remains non curab le by [CONTACT_496426]. 
In addition, t he vast majority of patients diagnosed with CLL are older than [ADDRESS_1249327] patients with CLL 
to tolerate traditional chemotherapy regimens due to the associated toxicities.  A non-
chemotherapeutic regimen that provides high efficacy with less toxicity than 
conventional regimens  would be desirable in this popu lation. We are proposing a 
combination regimen consisting of high dose methylprednisolone combined with 
ofatumumab , followed by [CONTACT_496427]. (See Table 1 for dosing and d etails of treatment regimen). The rationale for 
exploring this combination regimen is based on the following previously published trials:  
 
Results of a phase II study combining Rituximab, an anti CD20 monoclonal antibody, 
with high dose methylprednisolone as a salvage regimen for th e treatment of patient s 
with fludarabine refractory CLL showed an overall response rate (ORR) of 93% with a 
complete remission rate (CR) of 36%. The regimen was well tolerated, and serious 
adverse events were rare. All patients were able to complete the sc heduled treatment 
without delays or dosage reductions.  (4) Another recent paper from the same group 
 Confidential  Page 7 of 90  
 
Amendment 6 Dated 03/03/2016 
 showed similar efficacy in the front line setting using a reduced dose of steroids.  They 
showed an ORR of 96% with a CR rate of 32%.  (5) 
 
Ofatumumab (Arzerra®) is a human monoclonal antibody that targets a unique small -
loop epi[INVESTIGATOR_83825]20 and elicits potent in vitro complement -dependent cytotoxicity, even 
in malignant B cells with low levels of CD20 expression . Ofatumumab is currently 
approved by [CONTACT_892094] .  It is also under 
development b y [COMPANY_001] for the treatment of untreated, relapsed or refractory B -cell 
follicular lymphoma, for the treatment of untreated CLL, for the treatment of active 
rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune diseases.  
 
Ofatumumab has been studied in patients with  fludarabine and alemtuzumab refractory 
CLL (FA-ref) or refractory to fludarabine with bulky (>5cm) lymphadenopathy (BF-ref). 
(6) Ofatumuma b was given weekly x 8 doses followed by [CONTACT_496430] x 4. Results 
of a planned interim analysis included 138 treated patients with FA -ref (n = 59) and BF -
ref (n = 79) CLL. The overall response rates (primary end point) were 58% [corrected] 
and 47% in  the FA-ref and BF -ref groups, respectively. Complete resolution of 
constitutional symptoms and improved performance status occurred in 57% and 48% of 
patients, respectively. Median progression -free survival and overall survival times were 
5.[ADDRESS_1249328] antitumor 
mechanism remai ns elusive. However, its antitumor activity seems to be mediated 
through its ability to modulate production of various key survival cytokines such as TNF -
 Confidential  Page 8 of 90  
 
Amendment 6 Dated 03/03/[ADDRESS_1249329] other  component s of the tumor microenvironment, including the immune 
cellular compartment. Preclinical studies demonstrated that lenalidomide enhances NK -
cell mediated and monocyte -mediated tumor cell ADCC for a variety of rituximab treated 
NHL cell lines in vi tro. (7) A Phase II trial of single agent lenalidomide in patients with 
relapsed or ref ractory CLL revealed an ORR of 47% with a CR rate of 9%.  (8) Another 
phase II trial of single agent lenalidomide for the treatment of relapsed or re fractory CLL 
revealed an ORR of 32% with 7% CR, 25% stable disease. The most common toxicity 
was myelosuppression, and the median daily dose of lenalidomide tolerated was 10 mg.  
(9) More recently two combina tion trials of lenalidomide and rituximab have  been 
reported in abstract form from our center  (10) and the MDACC. (11) Both of these studies 
evaluated patients with relapsed disease and showed an overall response rate of 60%.  
 
Our hypothesis is that ofatumumab will produce higher rates of CR in this setting. The 
consolidation with lenalidomide is based  on the fact that this drug has  activity in C LL but 
is not immunosuppress ive. In addition , there is evidence that lenalidomide c an improve 
the immune system of patient s with CLL as well as increase the rates of CR in this  
population. The reason for incorporating lenalidomide after debulking patients with high 
dose steroids and ofatumumab is based on the experience with lenalidomide as a single 
agent in the relapsed and front line setting .  In this setting tumor lysis syndrome and 
tumor flare  were observed. We believe that th is sequence of drugs will carry less toxicity 
and will be better tolerated.

Amendment 6 Dated 03/03/2016 
 STUDY DESIGN:  
This is a phase II, single institution, and non -randomized study of patients with relapsed 
or refractory CLL/SLL, utilizing a two -stage trial design. The primary endpoint for this 
trial is the combined complete and partial response rate (at 3 months , after the end of 
cycle 3) to the protocol therapy. We anticipate this trial will have a CR+PR respon se rate 
of at least 55%.  
 
A two-stage design is employed for this trial. The null/unacceptable CR+PR response 
rate is ≤35% while the anticipated true response rate to the protocol treatment is at least 
55% for each disease cohort. At the first stage, 25 p atients will be accrued to the trial. If 9 
or fewer of these patients respond, then the trial will be terminated early and the response 
rate to the protocol treatment will be deemed unacceptable (≤35%). Otherwise, if more 
than [ADDRESS_1249330] stage, an additional 31 patients will be enrolled to 
this trial during stage 2 for a total of 56 patients. If 25 or fewer of these 56 patients 
respond to the protocol treatment at the end of stage 2, no further investigation of the 
protocol treatmen t is considered warranted. On the other hand, if more than 25 patients 
out of the 56 enrolled patients respond, the protocol treatment will be considered 
promising. If the true response rate is ≤35%, the probability of ending the trial at stage [ADDRESS_1249331] 55%, then the probability of ending 
the trial at stage 1 is only 0.04. This two -stage design has an overall alpha level of 0.047 
and a power of 0.90.  
 
For the purpose of interim analysis at the end of stage 1 , the objective response will be 
measured by [CONTACT_5638] 3 months (or end of cycle 3) from the start of the protocol 
treatment prior to the initiation of the combination of ofatumumab with lenalidomide. 
The accrual will not be suspended while waiting for th e results of the interim analysis 
unless the observed objective response rate among those patients whose objective 
response data are available is below 30 %.

 3 Background and Rationale 
3.1 Introduction: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia / Small lymphocytic lymphoma 
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a monoclonal B-cell malignancy with a low level 
of proliferation, is characterized by a progressive accumulation of mature-appearing but 
functionally incompetent, malignant B lymphocytes. CLL is the most common form of 
leukemia diagnosed in the Western countries. (1) It accounts for over 15,000 new 
diagnoses (almost 40% of all leukemias) and over 4,000 deaths per year in the United 
States. CLL is a disease of the elderly with a median age at diagnosis of 72 years and 
more than two-thirds of patients are over 65 years of age. (2, 3) 
 
The cells are characterized by [CONTACT_496433] B-cell markers such as CD19, CD20, and 
CD22 but also express CD5 which is a T-cell marker. (2) The spectrum of this disease 
varies from a simple lymphocytosis to splenomegaly and/or cytopenias.  Some patients 
have an indolent course while others have a more accelerated course.  In either case, the 
disease relapses frequently once treatment is initiated, and there is considerable morbidity 
from the disease and the treatments themselves.  (12) 
 
Several predictive factors have been identified in CLL In addition to clinical staging, 
traditional prognostic factors for identifying high risk of disease progression have 
included elevated serum levels of beta-2 microglobulin, soluble CD23, diffuse bone 
marrow infiltration,  short lymphocyte doubling time, and high levels of zeta-associated 
protein (ZAP-70) on the surface of malignant cells.  (13, 14) More recently, the presence of 
certain cytogenetic abnormalities identified by [CONTACT_26707] (FISH) 
analysis and mutational status of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgHV) have become a 
more meaningful predictor of disease progression and duration of response to therapy.  (15) 
 
CLL remains non curable by [CONTACT_892096]. Previously, when the need for 
treatment was established, chlorambucil with or without corticosteroids was often used as 
first line treatment and purine analogues such as fludarabine as second line treatment.

Amendment 6 Dated 03/03/[ADDRESS_1249346] line combination regimen of fludarabine, 
cyclophosphamide and rituximab with an excellent complete response rate of 44%, these 
patients do relapse and require further treatments. Patients without a complete response 
also progress and require further therapy. Considering that the vast majority of patients 
diagnosed with CLL are older than 65 years of age, there is a need to search for a non-
chemotherapeutic regimen that provides high efficacy with less toxicity than 
conventional regimens. We are proposing a combination regimen consisting of high dose 
methylprednisolone combined with ofatumumab, followed by [CONTACT_496435] (See Section 1 Table 1 for dosing schema 
and details of regimen). 
3.2 Ofatumumab 
Ofatumumab (Arzerra®) is a human monoclonal antibody that targets a unique small-
loop epi[INVESTIGATOR_83825]20 and elicits potent in vitro complement-dependent cytotoxicity, even 
in malignant B cells with low levels of CD20 expression. Ofatumumab is currently 
approved by [CONTACT_496436]. It is also under 
development by [CONTACT_892097], relapsed or refractory B-cell 
follicular lymphoma, for the treatment of untreated  CLL, for the treatment of active 
rheumatoid arthritis,  and other autoimmune diseases. 
3.2.1 Ofatumumab Indications 
Ofatumumab was approved by [CONTACT_362128] 27th, 2009 for the treatment of 
patients with CLL whose cancer is no longer being controlled by [CONTACT_496437]. It has also shown potential in treating follicular non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma 
(FL), diffuse large B cell lymphoma, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and relapsing remitting 
multiple sclerosis.

Amendment 6 Dated 03/03/[ADDRESS_1249347] been reported. The following reactions 
should be regarded as expected infusion-related adverse reactions in connection with the 
use of ofatumumab probably as a consequence of B cell depletion and cytokine release: 
pruritus, dyspnea, bronchospasm, throat irritation, cough, pharyngolaryngeal pain, 
flushing, hyperhidrosis, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, hypotension, 
rash/urticaria, influenza-like-illness, fatigue, fever, chills, headache, dizziness, myalgia 
and arthralgia.  
 
The incidence of infusion-related symptoms was highest during the first infusion and 
decreased substantially with subsequent infusions. Implementation of pre-medication 
before infusions has reduced the number as well as the severity of infusion related 
adverse events. One serious case of cytokine release complicated with laryngeal edema 
and one case of anaphylactoid-like reaction have been observed; both events were fully 
reversible after cessation of the infusion and proper treatment. It should be noted that 
none of these subjects received premedication with prednisolone. 
 
During the ongoing study in subjects with CLL refractory to alemtuzumab and 
fludarabine,  infusion related adverse events have been reported in approximately 30% of 
subjects. Only 2-3 % were serious adverse events. All subjects received pre-medication 
with prednisolone, acetaminophen and antihistamine. In the completed CLL trial 402 in 
patients with relapsed or refractory CLL, 15% of the subjects had serious infections. In 
the ongoing CLL 406 trial in subjects refractory to both alemtuzumab and fludarabine an 
increased frequency of serious infections (25-30%) have been reported.  
 
One case of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) has been reported in a 
very ill CLL subject previously treated with alemtuzumab and fludarabine and with a 
very low CD4 cell count. Leukopenia, including neutropenia, anemia, and 
thrombocytopenia have been reported in CLL subjects. These events are most likely

Amendment 6 Dated 03/03/2016 
 related to the patients’ baseline disease; however, a causal relationship to ofatumumab 
cannot be excluded. 
3.3 High Dose Methylprednisolone 
Methylprednisolone is a corticosteroid that has been on the market for several years and 
is available in generic form. 
 
Results of a phase II study combining Rituximab, an anti CD20 monoclonal antibody, 
with high dose methylprednisolone as salvage regimen for the treatment of patient with 
fludarabine refractory CLL showed an overall response rate (ORR) of 93% with a 
complete remission rate (CR) of 36%. The regimen was well tolerated and serious 
adverse events were rare. All patients were able to complete the scheduled treatment 
without delays or dosage reductions. (4) Another recent paper from the same group 
showed a similar efficacy in the front line setting using a reduced dose of steroids.  They 
showed an ORR of 96% with a CR rate of 32%. (5)

3.4 Lenalidomide 
Lenalidomide (Revlimid®) is a proprietary IMiD® compound of Celgene Corporation.  
IMiD® compounds have both immunomodulatory and anti-angiogenic properties which 
could confer antitumor and antimetastatic effects.  Lenalidomide has been demonstrated 
to possess anti-angiogenic activity through inhibition of bFGF, VEGF and TNF-α 
induced endothelial cell migration, due at least in part to inhibition of Akt 
phosphorylation response to bFGF (16).  In addition, lenalidomide has a variety of 
immunomodulatory effects.  Lenalidomide stimulates T cell proliferation, stimulates the 
production of IL-2, IL-10 and IFN-gamma, inhibits IL-1 beta and IL-6 , and modulates 
IL-12 production.(17) Up regulation of T cell derived IL-[ADDRESS_1249349] 
in part through increased AP-1 activity. (18) 
Although the exact antitumor mechanism of action of lenalidomide is unknown, a 
number of mechanisms are postulated to be responsible for lenalidomide’s activity 
against multiple myeloma.  Lenalidomide has been shown to increase T cell proliferation, 
which leads to an increase in IL-2 and IFN-γ secretion.  The increased level of these 
circulating cytokines augment natural killer cell number and function, and enhance 
natural killer cell activity to yield an increase in multiple myeloma cell lysis. (19)  In 
 Confidential Page 20 of 90  
         
 
Amendment 6 Dated 03/03/[ADDRESS_1249350] in multiple myeloma cell lines and in multiple myeloma 
cells of patients resistant to melphalan, doxorubicin and dexamethasone.  (20) 
Lenalidomide Indications and Usage: 
 Lenalidomide is indicated for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent 
anemia due to Low- or Intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated with a 
deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities.  
Revlimid® is also approved in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of 
patients with multiple myeloma that have received at least one prior therapy.  
Lenalidomide Adverse Events 
Most frequently reported adverse events reported during clinical studies with 
lenalidomide in oncologic and non-oncologic indications, regardless of presumed 
relationship to study medication include: anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and 
pancytopenia, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, dehydration, rash, itching, 
infections, sepsis, pneumonia, UTI, u pper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416], atrial fibrillation, 
congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, chest pain, weakness, hypotension, 
hypercalcemia, hyperglycemia, back pain, bone pain, generalized pain, dizziness, mental 
status changes, syncope, renal failure, dyspnea, pleural effusion, pulmonary embolism, 
deep vein thrombosis, CVA, convulsions, dizziness, spi[INVESTIGATOR_13377], syncope, 
disease progression, death not specified and fractures.  Tumor flare reactions (TFR) have 
been reported frequently in CLL patients treated with lenalidomide.  Tumor lysis 
syndrome (TLS) has been reported in CLL patients treated with lenalidomide.  
Precautions must be taken to prevent TLS including proper selection of patients with 
regard to renal function, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and TLS prophylaxis and 
monitoring. 
Complete and updated adverse events are available in the Investigational Drug Brochure 
and the IND Safety Letters.

Amendment 6 Dated 03/03/2016 
 3.5  Rationale for Combination Regimen in CLL/SLL 
The rationale for exploring this combination regimen is based on the following 
previously published trials. Results of a phase II study combining Rituximab, an anti 
CD20 monoclonal antibody, with high dose methylprednisolone as salvage regimen for 
the treatment of patient with fludarabine refractory CLL showed an overall response rate 
(ORR) of 93% with a complete remission rate (CR) of 36%. The regimen was well 
tolerated and serious adverse events were rare. All patients were able to complete the 
scheduled treatment without delays or dosage reductions. (4)  
 
Ofatumumab single agent has been studied in patients with fludarabine and alemtuzumab 
refractory CLL (FA-ref) or refractory to fludarabine with bulky (>5cm) lymphadenopathy 
(BF-ref). (6) Ofatumumab was given weekly x 8 doses followed by [CONTACT_496430] x 4. 
Results of a planned interim analysis included 138 treated patients with FA-ref (n = 59) 
and BF-ref (n = 79) CLL. The overall response rates (primary end point) were 58% 
[corrected] and 47% in the FA-ref and BF-ref groups, respectively. Complete resolution 
of constitutional symptoms and improved performance status occurred in 57% and 48% 
of patients, respectively. Median progression-free survival and overall survival times 
were 5.[ADDRESS_1249351] common adverse events during treatment were 
infusion reactions and infections, which were primarily, grade 1 or 2 events. Hematologic 
events during treatment included anemia and neutropenia. These encouraging results in 
patients with refractory CLL warrant further investigation of ofatumumab in combination 
with other agents and as maintenance for the treatment of patients with CLL.  
 
 
A Phase II trial of single agent lenalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL 
revealed an ORR of 47% with a CR rate of 9%.  (8) Another phase II trial of single agent 
lenalidomide for the treatment of relapsed or refractory CLL revealed an ORR of 32% 
with 7% CR, 25% stable disease. The most common toxicity was myelosuppression, and 
the median daily dose of lenalidomide tolerated was 10 mg. (9) More recently two 
combination trials of lenalidomide and rituximab have been reported in abstract form 
 Confidential Page 22 of 90  
         
 
Amendment 6 Dated 03/03/2016 
 from our center  (10) and MDACC.(11) Both these studies evaluated patients in the relapsed 
setting and had an overall response rate of 60%.  
 
Our hypothesis is that ofatumumab will produce higher rates of CR when combined with 
lenalidomide and high dose steroids. The consolidation with lenalidomide is based on the 
fact that this drug has activity in CLL but is not immunosuppressive. In addition,  there is 
evidence that lenalidomide c an improve the immune system of patients with CLL as well 
as increase the rates of CR in this population. The reason for incorporating lenalidomide 
after debulking patients with high dose steroids and ofatumumab is based on the 
experience with lenalidomide as a single agent in the relapsed and front line setting.  In 
this setting tumor lysis syndrome and tumor flare were observed. We believe that this 
sequence of drugs will carry less toxicity and will be better tolerated.

5.1 Overall design 
This is a phase II study, single institution, non randomized study involving patients with 
relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL receiving a combination treatment of ofatumumab and 
high dose methylprednisolone, followed by [CONTACT_496439]. 
The study has 2 stages (see study schema in section 1).  Stage 1 is an induction phase and 
incorporates cycles 1-3 (see table1 for drug dosing).  Stage 2 is a consolidation phase and 
incorporates cycles 4-12.  After stage 1 (cycle 3) all patients will be assessed for response 
(see section 7, Response criteria).  Patients with a CR, PR, or SD will then proceed to the

 5.2 Protocol Therapy  
5.2.1 Lenalidomide  
REVLIMID® (lenalidomide), a thalidomide analogue, is an immunomodulatory agent 
with anti-angiogenic properties.  The chemical name [CONTACT_832] 3- (4-amino-1-oxo 1,3-dihydro -
2H-isoindol-2-yl) pi[INVESTIGATOR_119510]-2,6 -dione and it has the following chemical structure:

The empi[INVESTIGATOR_193038] C 13H13N3O3, and the gram molecular weight is 
259.3.  
Lenalidomide is off-white to pale-yellow solid powder. It is soluble in organic 
solvent/water mixtures, and buffered aqueous solvents. Lenalidomide is more soluble in 
organic solvents and low pH solutions. Solubility was significantly lower in less acidic 
buffers, ranging from about 0.4 to 0.5 mg/ml. Lenalidomide has an asymmetric carbon 
atom and can exist as the optically active forms S(-) and R(+), and is produced as a 
racemic mixture with a net optical rotation of zero. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Pharmacology 
Mechanism of Action:  
The mechanism of action of lenalidomide remains to be fully characterized. 
Lenalidomide possesses immunomodulatory and antiangiogenic properties.  
Lenalidomide inhibited the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased the 
secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines from peripheral blood mononuclear cells.  
Lenalidomide inhibited cell proliferation with varying effectiveness (IC50s) in some but 
not all cell lines.  Of cell lines tested, lenalidomide was effective in inhibiting growth of 
Namalwa cells (a human B cell lymphoma cell line with a deletion of one chromosome 5)

Amendment 6 Dated 03/03/2016 
 but was much less effective in inhibiting growth of KG-1 cells (human myeloblastic cell 
line, also with a deletion of one chromosome 5) and other cell lines without chromosome 
5 deletions.  Lenalidomide inhibited the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) but not 
COX-1 in vitro.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism: 
Absorption: 
Lenalidomide, in healthy volunteers, is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_210801] 0.[ADDRESS_1249353]-dose. 
Co-administration with food does not alter the extent of absorption (AUC) but does 
reduce the maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) by 36%. The pharmacokinetic 
disposition of lenalidomide is linear. Cmax and AUC increase proportionately with 
increases in dose. Multiple dosing at the recommended dose-regimen does not result in 
drug accumulation. 
Pharmacokinetic analyses were performed on 15 multiple myeloma patients treated in the 
phase I studies.  Absorption was found to be rapid on both Day 1 and Day 28 with time to 
maximum blood levels ranging from 0.7 to 2.0 hours at all dose levels (5mg, 10mg, 
25mg, and 50mg).  No plasma accumulation was observed with multiple daily dosing.  
Plasma lenalidomide declined in a monophasic manner with elimination half-life ranging 
from 2.8 to 6.1 hours on both Day 1 and 28 at all 4 doses.  Peak and overall plasma 
concentrations were dose proportional over the dosing range of 5mg to 50mg.  Exposure 
(AUC) in multiple myeloma patients is 57% higher than in healthy male volunteers.  
Pharmacokinetic Parameters: 
Distribution: 
In vitro (14C)-lenalidomide binding to plasma proteins is approximately 30%. 
  
 Confidential Page 26 of 90  
         
 
Amendment 6 Dated 03/03/2016 
 Metabolism and Excretion: 
The metabolic profile of lenalidomide in humans has not been studied. In healthy 
volunteers, approximately two-thirds of lenalidomide is eliminated unchanged through 
urinary excretion. The process exceeds the glomerular filtration rate and therefore is 
partially or entirely active.  Half-life of elimination is approximately 3 hours.

5.2.2 Ofatumumab  
Ofatumumab (ARZERRA) is an IgG1ĸ human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that 
specifically recognizes epi[INVESTIGATOR_370304]20 molecule on B cells. The antibody is 
generated via transgenic mouse and hybridoma technology and produced in a 
recombinant murine cell line (NS0) using standard mammalian cell cultivation and 
purification technologies.  
 
Ofatumumab represents a novel anti-CD20 mAb, as it binds to a CD20 epi[INVESTIGATOR_892087]. Ofatumumab is superior in CDC and its ability 
to kill rituximab resistant tumors as compared to rituximab. Based on the data from the 
non-clinical investigations of ofatumumab it is suggested that ofatumumab may deplete B 
cells for a longer period of time than rituximab, which may lead to a longer duration of 
treatment response and could potentially result in less dose needed. Ofatumumab is a 
human mAb with an anticipated very low immunogenicity. Therefore, subjects are not 
expected to produce human anti-human antibodies (HAHA) to the same degree as to the 
human anti- chimeric antibodies (HACA) seen in some subjects following rituximab 
treatment.

Amendment 6 Dated 03/03/2016 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Pharmacology 
Mechanism of Action: 
Ofatumumab binds specifically to epi[INVESTIGATOR_892088] [ADDRESS_1249354] ability to 
induce relocation of the CD20 molecules within the lipid rafts. The binding of 
ofatumumab induces cell death, primarily through CDC and ADCC and not by [CONTACT_20983]. 
Thus, depletion of B cells by [CONTACT_496440]20-expressing cell tumors. In the treatment of FL and CLL, the goal is 
to achieve a complete B-cell depletion in blood and to induce an objective tumor 
response in lymph nodes.  
 
In patients with CLL refractory to fludarabine and alemtuzumab, the median decrease in 
circulating CD19-positive B cells was 91% (n = 50) with the 8th infusion and 85% (n = 
32) with the 12th 
infusion. The time to recovery of lymphocytes to normal levels has not 
been determined. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetic and Drug Metabolism  
Pharmacokinetic data were obtained from 146 patients with refractory CLL who received 
a 300-mg initial dose followed by 7 weekly and 4 monthly infusions of 2,000 mg. The 
C
max and AUC
(0-∞) after the 8th 
infusion in Study 1 were approximately 40% and 60% 
higher than after the 4th 
infusion in Study 2. The mean volume of distribution at steady-
state (V
ss) values ranged from 1.7 to 5.1 L.  
 
Ofatumumab is eliminated through both a target-independent route and a B cell-mediated 
route. Ofatumumab exhibited dose-dependent clearance in the dose range of 100 to 2,000 
mg. Due to the depletion of B cells, the clearance of ofatumumab decreased substantially 
 Confidential Page 29 of 90  
         
 
Amendment 6 Dated 03/03/[ADDRESS_1249355] infusion. The mean clearance between 
the 4th 
and 12th 
infusions was approximately 0.01 L/hr and exhibited large inter-subject 
variability with CV% greater than 50%. The mean t
1/2 between the 4th 
and 12th 
infusions 
was approximately 14 days (range: 2.3 to 61.5 days).  
 
Special Populations : Cross-study analyses were performed on data from patients with a 
variety of conditions, including 162 patients with CLL, who received multiple infusions 
of ofatumumab as a single agent at doses ranging from 100 to 2,000 mg. The effects of 
various covariates (e.g., body size [weight, height, and body surface area], age, gender, 
baseline creatinine clearance) on ofatumumab pharmacokinetics were assessed in a 
population pharmacokinetic analysis.  
Body Weight: Volume of distribution and clearance increased with body weight. 
However, this increase was not clinically significant. No dosage adjustment is 
recommended based on body weight.  
Age: Age did not significantly influence ofatumumab pharmacokinetics in patients 
ranging from 21 to 86 years of age.  
Gender: Gender had a modest effect on ofatumumab pharmacokinetics (14% to 25% 
lower clearance and volume of distribution in female patients compared to male patients) 
in a cross-study population analysis (41% of the patients in this analysis were male and 
59% were female). These effects are not considered clinically important, and no dosage 
adjustment is recommended.  
Renal Impairment: Creatinine clearance at baseline did not have a clinically important 
effect on ofatumumab pharmacokinetics in patients with calculated creatinine clearance 
values ranging from 33 to 287 mL/min.

[IP_ADDRESS] Instructions for lenalidomide dose modifications or interruption  
Dose delay and dose reduction rules are as follows and in the table below. 
 Lenalidomide dose reduction steps are outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]   
 For treatment interruptions during a cycle, the 28-day schedule of each cycle will 
continue to be followed.  Missed doses of lenalidomide are not made up.   
 For treatment interruptions that delay the scheduled start of a new cycle, when 
toxicity has resolved as required to allow the start of a new cycle (Section 
[IP_ADDRESS]), the restart day of therapy becomes Day 1 of the next cycle. 
Dose re-escalation following dose reductions due to neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, 
tumor lysis syndrome, or tumor flare: 
 If the dose of lenalidomide has been reduced for neutropenia or 
thrombocytopenia, lenalidomide dose re-escalation is permitted if the subject

Amendment 6 Dated 03/03/2016 
 completes one full cycle without experiencing any toxicity that requires dose 
interruption or reduction.   
 If the dose of lenalidomide has been dose reduced for tumor lysis syndrome, 
lenalidomide dose re-escalation is permitted if the subject completes one full 
cycle without experiencing a laboratory TLS or ≥ Grade 1 TLS (see Appendix H: 
Cairo-Bishop Definition of Tumor Lysis Syndrome), unless the subject requires a 
dose interruption/reduction for other toxicity.   
 If the dose of lenalidomide has been dose reduced for tumor flare, lenalidomide 
dose re-escalation is permitted if the subject completes one full cycle without 
experiencing ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_1249380] requires a dose 
interruption/reduction for other toxicity.   
 If any of the above conditions are met, the lenalidomide dose may be increased by 
[CONTACT_496445] a new cycle of therapy up to the maximum 
allowable target dose (see Section 5.5.3  for the maximum allowable target dose 
and Section [IP_ADDRESS], Table 1, for appropriate dose escalation steps [reverse of the 
dose reduction steps in Table 1 
 Serum chemistry and uric acid should be closely monitored for signs of laboratory 
or clinical TLS (see Appendix H: Cairo-Bishop Definition of Tumor Lysis 
Syndrome) following lenalidomide dose re-escalation (see Section 2, Schedule of 
Study Assessments, for details regarding serum chemistry and uric acid 
monitoring).   
 TLS prophylaxis with allopurinol and hydration as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS] 
should be considered with each dose re-escalation.

[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment adherence 
Research center personnel will review the dosing instructions with subjects. Subjects will 
be asked to maintain a diary to record lenalidomide administration. Subjects will be asked 
to bring any unused lenalidomide and empty drug containers to the research center at 
their next visit.  Research personnel will count and record the number of used and unused 
drug at each visit and reconcile with the patient diary.   
Any unused Revlimid® (lenalidomide) should be returned to the patient for disposition in 
accordance with the RevAssist® program. 
5.6 Concomitant therapy    
5.6.1 Recommended concomitant therapy   
Subjects should receive full supportive care, including transfusions of blood and blood 
products, antibiotics, hematopoietic growth factors, analgesics, and antiemetics when 
appropriate.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) Prophylaxis (allopurinol and hydration)  
Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), characterized by [CONTACT_496446], hyperuricemia, and 
hyperphosphatemia resulting from the rapid release of potassium, uric acid, and 
phosphate, has been reported in CLL patients treated with lenalidomide necessitating

Amendment 6 Dated 03/03/[ADDRESS_1249381]’s cardiovascular status 
indicates the possibility of volume overload.  Based on clinical and laboratory 
parameters, TLS prophylaxis may be continued or restarted as needed at the 
Investigator’s discretion. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Anticoagulation Consideration   
Lenalidomide increases the risk of thrombotic events in patients who are at high risk or 
with a history a thrombosis, in particular when combined with other drugs known to 
cause thrombosis. When lenalidomide is combined with other agents such as steroids 
(e.g. dexamethasone, prednisone), anthracyclines (Doxil, Adriamycin) and erythropoietin 
the risk of thrombosis is increased.  For information on the risk of venous 
thromboembolism with combined oral contraception see Appendix: Risks of Fetal 
Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and Acceptable Birth Control Methods. 
All patients should receive prophylactic anti-coagulation.  Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (81 or 325 mg) is th e 
recommended agent for anti-coagulation prophylaxis.  Low molecular weight heparin 
may be utilized in patients that are intolerant to ASA. Coumadin should be used with 
caution and close monitoring of INR. 
Patients with a history of venous thromboembolism should be closely monitored 
throughout the study, especially during periods of fluctuating platelet counts. 
Prophylactic anti-coagulation should be held for platelet counts < 50,000/mm³ 
and then restarted when platelet counts are above this level.

venous thromboembolism.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment and Dose Modification for Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
All subjects meeting criteria of laboratory TLS or ≥ Grade 1 TLS according to the Cairo-
Bishop Definition of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (see Appendix) should receive vigorous 
intravenous hydration and should be considered for rasburicase therapy as needed to 
reduce hyperuricemia, until correction of electrolyte abnormalities.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Flare Reaction (TFR):  
Prophylaxis for (TFR) is not recommended.  Grade 1 TFR may be treated with NSAIDs 
(i.e. ibuprofen 400-600 mg orally every 4-6 hours as needed).  TFR ≥ Grade 2 may be 
treated with corticosteroids.  Narcotic analgesics may be added as needed for pain control 
in subjects experiencing ≥ Grade 2 tumor flare.  If corticosteroids are used, the following 
dosage schedule is recommended; prednisone 20mg PO QD x [ADDRESS_1249383] 2 weeks of Cycle 4 of treatment protocol should be 
recorded as an adverse event and not as progressive disease (PD).  For tumor flare 
occurring after the first 2 weeks of Cycle 4 of treatment protocol, differentiate tumor flare 
from progression.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Prophylaxis of infections 
Patients will receive prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carini pneumonia with trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole or equivalent, prophylaxis for herpes virus with acyclovir 400mg twice 
per day or equivalent and antifungal prophylaxis with fluconazole 100mg daily or 
equivalent. Prophylaxis will be administered throughout the treatment period until end of 
cycle 5.

factor (G-CSF), granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), or 
erythropoietin at the discretion of the treating physician. 
 
5.6.2 Prohibited concomitant therapy 
Concomitant use of other anti-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including radiation, thalidomide, or other 
investigational agents is not permitted while subjects are receiving protocol therapy 
during the treatment phase of the study. 
5.7 Discontinuation of Study Treatment (See Also Section [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS]) 
Treatment will continue as per dosing schema. Treatment will be discontinued at the 
occurrence of any of the following events.   
 Disease progression  
 Adverse event(s) that, in the judgment of the Investigator, may cause severe or 
permanent harm or which rule out continuation of the treatment regimen. 
 Discontinuation of treatment protocol for any reason. 
 Major violation of the study protocol. 
 Withdrawal of consent 
 Lost to follow up 
 Death 
 Pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test  
5.8 Lenalidomide Maintenance Therapy (MT)  
 At the discretion of the investigator, any subject completing 12 cycles of protocol 
therapy who has achieved a complete response, partial response or stable disease may 
begin Lenalidomide Maintenance Therapy (MT). 
 
During MT the following study procedures will be initiated:

Amendment 6 Dated 03/03/[ADDRESS_1249384] two years. After that these tests will be performed at the discretion of the 
treating physician.  
 
At the discretion of the investigator: 
1. Lenalidomide dose may be maintained at the subject’s current dose or if 
previously dose reduced, may be escalated to the maximum of 10 mg daily.  
2. Lenalidomide dose reductions may be initiated to 5 mg daily or 5 mg every other 
day.

definition. A serious adverse event is one that at any dose (including overdose): 
    Results in death 
 Is life-threatening1 
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity2 
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 Is an important medical event3 
 Pregnancy

 1“Life-threatening” means that the subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the serious adverse event; it 
does not refer to a serious adverse event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
2“Persistent or significant disability or incapacity” means that there is a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
carry out normal life functions. 
3Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in 
situations where none of the outcomes listed above occurred.  Important medical events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_496418].  Examples 
of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.  A new diagnosis of cancer during the course of a treatment should be considered as medically important.  
6.1.1 Adverse Event Reporting 
Toxicity will be scored using CTCAE Version 4.0 for toxicity and adverse event 
reporting.  A copy of the CTCAE Version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP 
homepage (HTTP://CTEP.INFO.NIH. GOV).  All appropriate treatment areas should 
have access to a copy of the CTCAE Version 4.0.  All adverse clinical experiences, 
whether observed by [CONTACT_56313], must be recorded, with 
details about the duration and intensity of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], the action taken with respect to 
the test drug, and the patient’s outcome.  The investigator must evaluate each adverse 
experience for its relationship to the test drug and for its seriousness. 
 
The investigator must appraise all abnormal laboratory results for their clinical 
significance.  If any abnormal laboratory result is considered clinically significant, the 
investigator must provide details about the action taken with respect to the test drug and 
about the patient’s outcome. 
6.1.[ADDRESS_1249389]’s last dose of lenalidomide 
are considered expedited reportable events.  If the subject is on lenalidomide, it is to be 
discontinued immediately and the subject is to be instructed to return any unused portion 
of lenalidomide to the Investigator.  The pregnancy must be reported to Celgene and

Amendment 6 Dated 03/03/2016 
 [COMPANY_001] Drug Safety within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the pregnancy 
by [CONTACT_202158]. 
 
The Investigator will follow the pregnant female until completion of the pregnancy, and 
must notify Celgene and [COMPANY_001] Drug Safety of the outcome as specified below.  The 
Investigator will provide this information as a follow-up to the initial SAE. 
 
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as a SAE 
(i.e., spontaneous abortion [any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be 
documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator should 
follow the procedures for Expedited Reporting of SAEs to Celgene and [COMPANY_001] (i.e., 
report the event to Celgene and [COMPANY_001] Drug Safety by [CONTACT_31950] 24 hours of the 
Investigator’s knowledge of the event). 
 
Any suspected fetal exposure to lenalidomide must be reported to Celgene and [COMPANY_001] 
within 24 hours of being made aware of the event.  The pregnant female should be 
referred to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further 
evaluation and counseling. 
 
All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_1249390] 
to causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant death after 30 days that the Investigator 
suspects is related to the in utero exposure to lenalidomide should also be reported. 
 
In the case of a live “normal” birth, Celgene and [COMPANY_001] Drug Safety should be advised 
as soon as the information is available.

Adverse Events: 
Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject, 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered 
related to the medicinal product. 
Events meeting the definition of an AE include: 
 Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) 
or other safety assessments e.g., ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, and felt to be clinically 
significant in the medial and scientific judgment of the investigator 
 Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition 
 Confidential Page 63 of 90  
         
 
Amendment 6 Dated 03/03/2016 
  New conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational product administration 
even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study 
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction 
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either 
investigational product or a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be 
reported as an AE/SAE) 
“Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” per se will not be 
reported as an AE or SAE. However, the signs and symptoms and/or clinical sequelae 
resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported if they fulfill the definition of an AE or 
SAE. 
Events that do not meet the definition of an AE include: 
 Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal safety 
assessments that is associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_99479]’s condition.  
 The disease/disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of 
the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the subject’s 
condition 
 Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE 
 Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) 
 Anticipated day- to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen 
 B cell depletion and hypogammaglobulinemia due to ofatumumab treatment 
6.2.1 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
A SAE is  an Adverse Event,  that, at any dose: 
a. Results in death 
 Confidential Page 64 of 90  
         
 
Amendment 6 Dated 03/03/2016 
 b. Is life-threatening 
NOTE:  The term 'life-threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. 
c. Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256357]:  In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5184] 
(usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1083]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s 
office or out-patient setting.  Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23918].  If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], 
the event is serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was 
necessary, the AE should be considered serious. 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre-existing condition that did not worsen 
from baseline is not considered an AE. 
An overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_376770] a Serious 
Adverse Event. 
d. Results in disability/incapacity, or 
NOTE:  The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may 
interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial 
disruption.

SAEs 
An event which is part of the natural course of the disease under study (i.e., disease 
progression) does not need to be reported as an SAE.  However, if the progression of the 
underlying disease is greater than that which would normally be expected for the subject, 
or if the investigator considers that there was a causal relationship between treatment

(minimum of 6 months or until the end of the follow-up period which ever is longer). All 
SAEs regardless of causality will be collected until the end of the follow-up period.   
 
From the time a subject consents to participate in and completes the study all SAEs 
assessed as related to study participation (e.g., protocol-mandated procedures, invasive 
tests, or change in existing therapy) or related to NOVARTIS concomitant medication, 
will be reported promptly to NOVARTIS. 
 
Any SAE brought to the investigator’s attention after the subject has completed the study

 Follow-up information is sent to the same fax number as the original SAE Report Form 
was sent, using a new fax cover sheet, stating that this is a follow-up to the previously 
reported SAE, and giving the date of the original report. Each re-occurrence, 
complication, or progression of the original event should be reported as a follow-up to 
that event regardless of when it occurs. The follow-up information should describe 
whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated and whether the 
patient continued or withdrew from study participation. 
If the SAE is not previously documented in the Ofatumumab Investigator Brochure or

the facilities where the study took place, to source documents, to CRFs, and to all other 
study documents. 
 
9.2.2  Internal Monitoring 
Data will be captured in Oncore, Moffitt’s Clinical Trials Database.  The Case Report 
Forms will be reviewed by [CONTACT_38061]’s Internal Monitors, periodically, approximately every 
[ADDRESS_1249410] of the trial.  The monitoring will include source data 
verification utilizing research subjects’ medical records.  
 
10   Statistical Considerations 
10.1 Study Design/Endpoints 
This is a phase II, single institution, and non-randomized study of patients with Relapsed 
or Refractory CLL/SLL, utilizing a two-stage trial design. The primary endpoint for this 
trial is the combined complete and partial response rate (at 3 months-the end of cycle 3) 
to the protocol therapy. We anticipate this trial will have a CR+PR response rate of at 
least 55%.  
A two-stage design is employed for this trial. The null/unacceptable CR+PR response 
rate is ≤35% while the anticipated true response rate to the protocol treatment is at least 
55% for each disease cohort. At the first stage, 25 patients will be accrued to the trial. If 9 
or fewer of these patients respond, then the trial will be terminated early and the response 
rate to the protocol treatment will be deemed unacceptable (≤35%). Otherwise, if more 
than [ADDRESS_1249411] stage, an additional 31 patients will be enrolled to 
this trial during stage 2 for a total of 56 patients. If 25 or fewer of these 56 patients 
respond to the protocol treatment at the end of stage 2, no further investigation of the 
protocol treatment is considered warranted. On the other hand, if more than 25 patients 
 Confidential Page 72 of 90  
         
 
Amendment 6 Dated 03/03/2016 
 out of the 56 enrolled patients respond, the protocol treatment will be considered 
promising. If the true response rate is ≤35%, the probability of ending the trial at stage [ADDRESS_1249412] 55%, then the probability of ending 
the trial at stage 1 is only 0.04. This two-stage design has an overall alpha level of 0.047 
and a power of 0.90. 
10.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
Up to 56 patients will be enrolled into this study. During the interim analysis at the end of 
stage 1, the patient accrual to the trial will be not suspended while pending the interim 
analysis results unless the observed objective response rate among those patients whose 
objective response data are available is below 30%. The accrual rate will be 
approximately 2-3 patients per month. The entire accrual for this trial should be 
completed in about 1.5 years.  
10.3 Stratification Factors  
There are no stratification factors planned for this study. 
10.4 Data Analysis, Reporting and Exclusions Regarding Efficacy Endpoints 
The objective response (CR+PR) rate and clinical benefit rate (CR +PR +SD) will be 
summarized using both a point estimate and its exact confidence interval based on the 
binomial distribution.  
Progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from study entry to disease 
progression, relapse or death due to any cause, whichever is earlier, will be summarized 
with the Kaplan-Meier curve. Confidence intervals for the median and survival rates at 
different time points will be constructed if needed. The other secondary endpoint, overall 
survival (OS), will be analyzed similarly. Both of these two secondary endpoints will be 
reported descriptively. 
The intent- to-treat approach will be used for data analysis of this trial. That means all 
patients who receive at least one dose of the protocol treatment will be included in the 
interim and final data analyses. Patients who are lost to follow-up or drop out of study 
prior to their scheduled response evaluation time due to any reason will be treated as non-
responders for response determination and censored for time- to-event type of endpoints

Amendment 6 Dated 03/03/[ADDRESS_1249413] assessment/follow-up if no relevant event has occurred by [CONTACT_221774]. A 
secondary analysis that includes only all eligible patients may be conducted in addition to 
the primary analysis described above at the discretion of the trial PI [INVESTIGATOR_196054]. Other subanalyses may also be considered on the basis of a subset of 
patients, excluding those for whom major protocol deviations have been identified (e.g., 
early discontinuation of treatment, major protocol violations, etc.).  However, these 
subanalyses may not serve as the basis for drawing conclusions concerning treatment 
efficacy, and the reasons for excluding patients from the analysis should be clearly 
reported.   
10.[ADDRESS_1249414] be assessed for response to treatment, even if there 
are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible.  Each patient will be 
assigned one of the following categories: 1) complete response, 2) partial response, 3) 
stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5) early death from malignant disease, 6) early 
death from toxicity, 7) early death because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, 
insufficient data).  [Note: By [CONTACT_480], category 9 usually designates the 
“unknown” status of any type of data in a clinical database.]  
 Confidential Page 74 of 90  
         
 
Amendment 6 Dated 03/03/2016 
 Patients in response categories 4-9 should be considered as failing to respond to treatment 
(disease progression).  Thus, an incorrect treatment schedule or drug administration does 
not result in exclusion from the analysis of the response rate.

 12 Appendices  
Appendix  A: Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and Acceptable 
Birth Control Methods  
Risks Associated with Pregnancy 
The use of lenalidomide in pregnant females and nursing mothers has not been studied 
nor has the effect of the lenalidomide on human eggs and sperm.  Lenalidomide is 
structurally related to thalidomide.  Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic active 
substance that causes severe life-threatening birth defects.  An embryofetal development 
study in animals indicates that lenalidomide produced malformations in the offspring of 
female monkeys who received the drug during pregnancy.  The teratogenic effect of 
lenalidomide in humans cannot be ruled out.  Therefore, a risk minimization plan to 
prevent pregnancy must be observed. 
All study participants must be registered into the mandatory RevAssist® program, and be 
willing and able to comply with the requirements of RevAssist®. 
Criteria for females of childbearing potential (FCBP) 
This protocol defines a female of childbearing potential as a sexually mature female who: 
1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 2) has not been 
naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any 
time in the preceding 24 consecutive months). 
The investigator must ensure that: 
 Females of childbearing potential comply with the conditions for pregnancy risk 
minimization, including confirmation that she has an adequate level of 
understanding 
 Females NOT of childbearing potential acknowledge that she understands the 
hazards and necessary precautions associated with the use of lenalidomide 
 Male patients taking lenalidomide acknowledge that he understands that traces of 
lenalidomide have been found in semen, that he understands the potential 
 Confidential Page 78 of 90  
         
 
Amendment 6 Dated 03/03/2016 
 teratogenic risk if engaged in sexual activity with a female of childbearing 
potential, and that he understands the need for the use of a condom even if he has 
had a vasectomy, if engaged in sexual activity with a female of childbearing 
potential.   
Contraception 
Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) enrolled in this protocol must agree to use two 
reliable forms of contraception simultaneously or to practice complete abstinence from 
heterosexual intercourse during the following time periods related to this study: 1) for at 
least 28 days before starting lenalidomide; 2) throughout the entire duration of 
lenalidomide treatment; 3) during dose interruptions; and 4) for at least [ADDRESS_1249422] include one highly effective method and 
one additional effective (barrier) method. FCBP must be referred to a qualified provider 
of contraceptive methods if needed. The following are examples of highly effective and 
additional effective methods of contraception:   
o Highly effective methods: 
 Intrauterine device (IUD) 
 Hormonal (birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], injections, implants) 
 Tubal ligation 
 Partner’s vasectomy 
o Additional effective methods: 
 Male condom 
 Diaphragm 
 Cervical Cap 
Because of the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with multiple 
myeloma taking lenalidomide and dexamethasone, combined oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_196989].  If a patient is currently using combined oral contraception the patient 
 Confidential Page 79 of 90  
         
 
Amendment 6 Dated 03/03/2016 
 should switch to one of the effective method listed above.  The risk of venous 
thromboembolism continues for 4−6 weeks after discontinuing combined oral 
contraception. The efficacy of contraceptive steroids may be reduced during co-treatment 
with dexamethasone. 
Implants and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems are associated with an 
increased risk of infection at the time of insertion and irregular vaginal bleeding. 
Prophylactic antibiotics should be considered particularly in patients with neutropenia.  
Pregnancy testing 
Medically supervised pregnancy tests with a minimum sensitivity of 50 mIU/mL must be 
performed for females of childbearing potential, including females of childbearing 
potential who commit to complete abstinence, as outlined below. 
Before starting lenalidomide 
Female Patients: 
FCBP must have two negative pregnancy tests (sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL) prior to 
prescribing lenalidomide.  The first pregnancy test must be performed within 10-[ADDRESS_1249423] be performed 
within 24 hours prior to prescribing lenalidomide.  The patient may not receive 
lenalidomide until the Investigator has verified that the results of these pregnancy tests 
are negative. 
Male Patients : 
Must agree to practice complete abstinence or agree to use a condom during sexual 
contact [CONTACT_197013], during dose interruptions and for at least 28 day s 
following lenalidomide discontinuation, even if he has undergone a successful 
vasectomy.

Female Patients: 
 Confidential Page 80 of 90  
         
 
Amendment 6 Dated 03/03/2016 
  FCBP with regular or no menstrual cycles must agree to have pregnancy tests 
weekly for the first [ADDRESS_1249424] 28 days of lenalidomide treatment, including dose interruptions, and then 
every 14 days throughout the remaining duration of lenalidomide treatment, 
including dose interruptions, at lenalidomide discontinuation, and at Day 14 and 
Day 28 following lenalidomide discontinuation.   
 At each visit, the Investigator must confirm with the FCBP that she is continuing 
to use two reliable methods of birth control at each visit during the time that birth 
control is required.   
 If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does occur in a study patient, 
lenalidomide must be immediately discontinued. 
 Pregnancy testing and counseling must be performed if a patient misses her period 
or if her pregnancy test or her menstrual bleeding is abnormal.  Lenalidomide 
treatment must be temporarily discontinued during this evaluation. 
 Females must agree to abstain from breastfeeding during study participation and 
for at least 28 days after lenalidomide discontinuation. 
Male Patients: 
 Must practice complete abstinence or use a condom during sexual contact [CONTACT_197014], during dose interruptions and for at least 28 
days following lenalidomide discontinuation, even if he has undergone a 
successful vasectomy.   
 If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does occur in the partner of a male study 
patient during study participation, the investigator must be notified immediately.

Amendment 6 Dated 03/03/2016 
 Additional precautions 
 Patients should be instructed never to give lenalidomide to another person. 
 Female patients should not donate blood during therapy and for at least 28 days 
following discontinuation of lenalidomide. 
 Male patients should not donate blood, semen or sperm during therapy or for at 
least 28 days following discontinuation of lenalidomide. 
 Only enough lenalidomide for one cycle of therapy may be prescribed with each 
cycle of therapy.

 Appendix F: NCIWG 2008 Response Criteria  
 
 
 
 Group A criteria define the tumor load, Group B criteria define the functions of the hematopoietic system (or marrow). 
*CR (complete remission): all of the criteria have to be met, and patients have the lack disease-related constitutional 
symptoms: PR (partial remission): at least two of the criteria of Group A plus one of the criteria of group B have to be met; SD 
is the absence of progressive disease (PD) and failure to achieve at lease a PR; PD: at least one of the above criteria of Gr oup 
A or Group B has to be met.

 APPENDIX H:   Cairo-Bishop Definition of Tumor Lysis Syndrome  
(Cairo MS et al. Br J Haematol 2004) 
Table:  Cairo-Bishop Definition of Laboratory Tumor Lysis Syndrome (LTLS) 
Uric Acid  ≥ 476 μmol/l  (≥ 8.0 mg/dl) or 25% increase from baseline  
Potassium  ≥ 6.0 mmol/l (≥ 6.0 mEq/l) or 25% increase from baseline  
Phosphorous  ≥1.45 mmol/l  (≥ 4.5 mg/dl) or 25 % increase from baseline  
Calcium ≤ 1.75 mmol/l (≤ 7.0 mg/dl) or 25% decrease from baseline  
Laboratory tumor lysis syndrome (LTLS) is defined as either a 25% change or level above or below normal, as 
defined above, for any two or more serum values of uric acid, potassium, phosphate, and calcium within 3 days 
before or 7 days after the initiation of chemotherapy.  This assessment assumes that a patient has or will receive 
adequate hydration (± alkalinization) and a hypouricemic agent(s).

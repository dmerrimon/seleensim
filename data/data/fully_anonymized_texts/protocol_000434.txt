Title:  A Phase 2 Trial of Bortezomib in KRAS -Mutant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in Never 
Smokers or Those  with KRAS G12D 
 
Objectives 
 
The primary objective of this study is: 
 
to determine the efficacy of single-agent subc utaneous  bortezomib in patients with 
advanced  (stage IIIB/IV) KRAS -mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in never- 
smokers (<100 lifetime cigarettes) or pa tients with a G12D mutation. The primary 
endpo int will be best ob jectiveresponse  rate (CR+PR) at any time prior to progression by 
[CONTACT_393] v1.1. 
 
The seconda ry objectives of this study are to evaluate: 
 
1.  progression-free survival 
2.  overall survival 
3.  8-week stable disease  
4.  toxicity (NCI-CTCAE v4.0) 
 
Patient Population: patients with advanced  (stage IIIB/IV) KRAS-mutant non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) who either are never-smokers (<100 lifetime cigarettes) or have a G12D 
mutation 
 
Number  of Patients:  25 patients evaluable for response.  
 
Study Design and Methodology:  This will be a single-institution, open  label, two-stage, 
single agent trial of subcutaneous  bortezomib in patients with advanced  (stage IIIB/IV) 
KRAS-mutant NSCLC with a never-smoking history or a G12D mutation. 
 
Treatments Administered:  Bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2/dose)  will be administered by 
[CONTACT_442198] 1, 4, 8, and  11 of a 21-day cycle.  Cycles will be repea ted 
until disease  progression or unaccep table toxicity. 
 
Efficacy  Data Collected: The following evaluations will be conduc ted to assess the efficacy 
of bortezomib - radiographic response  rate by [CONTACT_393] v1.1, progression-free survival, and 
overall survival. 
 
Safety Data Collected: The following evaluations will be conduc ted to assess the safety of 
bortezomib - toxicity assess ments by [CONTACT_12134]-CTCAE v4.0. 
 
Statistical Design: Stage II minimax design testing the null hypothesis of 10%  objective 
response  rate (ORR) against alternative of 30% ORR. In the first stage, 16 evaluable 
patients will be accrued- if 2/[ADDRESS_561803] a response,  9 additional pa tients will be accrued in the 
second  stage. Bortezomib will be cons idered worthy of further study if 5/25 patients respond.

3.0 BACKGROUND  AND RATIONALE 
 
3.1 Proteasome Inhibition in KRA S-Mutant Lung C ancer 
Lung  Cancer and  KRAS Mutations:  Lung canc er is the most common cause of canc er death in the 
U.S. and worldwide. Approximately 215,020 new lung cancer cases  are diagnosed  in the U.S. each 
year,1 and approximately 1.44 million new lung cancer cases are diagnosed worldwide. 2 Of patients 
who are diagnosed  with lung cance r, more than 80% eventually succu mb to the disease. 
Histologically, the vast majority of patients with lung cancer ha ve non-small cell lung canc er 
(NSCLC). Platinum doublet chemotherapy is the standa rd first-line treatment for NSCLC, and single 
agent chemotherapy or erlotinib provides clinical benefit in second -line patients.[ADDRESS_561804] line therapy is 
approximately 12 months with an overall survival of 2% and 13% at [ADDRESS_561805] common oncogene driver mutations in NSCLC, and occur in 
approximately 25% of adenoca rcinomas of the lung.  In the [LOCATION_002] alone, this molecularly 
selected cohort accou nts for an approximate incidence  of 22,[ADDRESS_561806] been  shown to confer resistance  to epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR)-targeted 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_442186]4 and emerging data suggest that lung cancer pa tients with mutations 
of the KRAS oncogene are similarly resistant to the EGFR-tyrosine kinase  inhibitors (TKIs), erlotinib 
and gefitinib.[ADDRESS_561807] shown that the presence  of KRAS mutations represents a 
negative prognostic factor for pa tients with NSCLC.7 Taken together, there is a need  for new  
medical treatments for patients with KRAS -mutant NSCLC.

sepa rate trials. We conjectured that the individuals might harbor a  similar genetic signature [CONTACT_442214]:  2/7/14 Page 8 of 48  
 
Never-smokers and KRAS  G12D:  Although KRAS mutations were classically thought to occur in 
smokers, an  evaluation of nearly 500 patients from Memorial Sloan Kettering noted a 15% incidence 
of KRAS mutations in lung adenoca rcinomas from ne ver-smokers.[ADDRESS_561808] tumors that a re genetically less complex than tumors in smokers9, 
making the use of targeted therapy in the former more attractive. 
 
KRAS  Mutants Rely on NF-kB: NF-kB forms a 
family of transcription factors that participates in 
a number of essential biological processes such 
as inflammation, the immune respons e, 
development, cell growth, and survival.[ADDRESS_561809].  Barbie et al11 employed a 
systematic RNA interference (RNAi ) screen to 
detect synthetic lethal p artners of oncogenic 
KRAS .  Knockdown of the non-canon ical IkB 
kinase, TKB1, resulted in apop tosis in KRAS 
mutant human cell lines. TKB1 was found  to 
activate NF-kB signaling and subs equent pro- 
survival signals such  as BCL-XL and cREL. In a 
sepa rate pape r, Meylan et al demonstrated that 
the introduc tion of a nonphospho rylatable NF-kB 
super repressor, IkB, in KRAS G12D-mutant 
murine tumors resulted in loss of cell viability 
seconda ry to apop tosis.12 
 
Proteasome Inhibition Downregulates NF-kB and  Induces  KRAS -Mutant Tu mor Regression: The 
fact that KRAS mutant tumors are depende nt on NF-kB signaling provides a strong rationale for the 
use of targeted therapy with proteaso me inhibitors. These  drugs have been  shown to result in 
downregulation of the NF-kB pathway via prevention of the degradation of NF-kB inhibitory proteins 
such  as IkB.[ADDRESS_561810] 
small molecule inhibitors of the proteasome, bo rtezomib and MG132 exhibited synthetic lethality in 
RAS mutant cells in the study, again seconda ry to a profound  prometaphase block.14   In KRASLSL- 
G12D/wt;p53flox/flox mice (G12D-mutant), bortezomib induced  in-vivo tumor regression of lung 
adenoca rcinoma. Taken together, these  observations provide a strong biologic rationale for the use 
of proteasome inhibition with bortezomib in the treatment of KRAS -mutant NSCLC. 
 
Our clinical experience  at MSKCC suppo rts the hypothesis that p roteasome inhibition results in 
synthetic lethality in KRAS -mutant lung canc ers. We have seen  impressive reductions in tumor 
volume (near co mplete responses) with bortezomib in two patients at our center, one in each  of two

been  identified at MSKCC as of 2011. The target accrual for this protocol is 25 patients. Based  on 
our KRAS G12D volume alone (not taking into account our never-smoker KRAS-mutant popu lation 
which represents 15% of all KRAS mutations), we expect to fully accrue within 12-18 months of 
study initiation. 
 
3.2  Bortezomi b: Mechanism of Action 
 
Bortezomib for Injection is a small-molecule proteasome inhibitor de veloped  by [CONTACT_149615], Inc., (Millennium) as a novel agent to treat human malignanc ies.  Bortezomib is 
currently approved by [CONTACT_442200] (US FDA) for the treatment of 
patients with multiple myeloma (MM).  It is also indicated for the treatment of patients with mantle 
cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least [ADDRESS_561812] is critical to the inhibition of tumor growth could also differ. 
Bortezomib has a novel pattern of cytotoxicity in National Cancer Institute (NCI) in vitro and in vivo 
assa ys.[ADDRESS_561813]/indirect effects on various molecular targets 
including cell cycle control proteins p27 and p21, cyclins, signal transdu ction molecules, transcription 
factors c-jun and HIF1-α, tumor supp ressor p rotein p53, a ngiogenesis factors, and  many others. 
Bortezomib is thought to be efficacious in multiple myeloma via its inhibition of nuclear factor κB 
(NF-κB) activation, its attenua tion of interleukin-6 (IL-6)-mediated cell growth, a direct apop totic 
effect, and  possibly anti-angiogenic and other effects.30,31, 32,33, 34,35, 36,37

including patients treated through Millennium-sponsored clinical trials, Investigator-Initiated Studies, 
the US NCI Cancer  Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), and  with commercially available drug.

 3.3.1 Intravenous  Administration 
 
In a phase  1 trial in patients with refractory hematologic malignanc ies, the MTD for a twice weekly 
dosing for 4 weeks  of a 42-day cycle was 1.04 mg/m2/dose, with DLTs of thrombocytopen ia, 
hypona tremia, hypokalemia, fatigue, and malaise.[ADDRESS_561815] and 
fourth weeks of therapy.  In the 3-week schedu le of bortezomib monotherapy (4 dose s, given on 
Days 1, 4, 8, and  11 of a 21-day treatment cycle), the DLT occurred at 1.56 mg/m2/dose (3 subjects 
with Grade 3 diarrhea and 1 with peripheral sens ory neuropathy). Therefore, the MTD at this 
schedu le was 1.3 mg/m2/dose.  Antitumor activity was reported in subjects with Non-Hodgkin’s 
Lymphoma (NHL), MM, Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia, squamous cell carcinoma of the 
nasopha rynx, bronchoa lveolar carcinoma of the lung, renal ce ll carcinoma, and prostate 
cance r.39,40, 41,42 
 
The safety and efficacy of bortezomib in subjects with MM were investigated in two phase  2 clinical 
studies, studies M34100 -024 (subjects with first relapse )43 and M34100 -025 (subjects with second  or 
greater relapse  and refractory to their last prior therapy).[ADDRESS_561816] 2  previous treatments received bortezomib, 1.3 mg/m2 on 
Days 1, 4, 8, and  11 of a 21-day treatment cycle.  Complete respo nses (CRs) were obse rved in 4% 
of subjects, with an additional 6%  of patients meeting all criteria for CR but ha ving a positive 
immunofixation test.  Partial response  (PR) or be tter was obse rved in 27% of subjects, and  the 
overall response  rate (CR, PR, and  minor respo nse [MR] combined) was 35%.  Seventy percent of 
subjects experienced  stable disease  or be tter. 
 
The phase  3 study (M34101-039)45, also referred to as the APEX study, was designed to determine 
whether bortezomib provided benefit (time to progression [TTP], response  rate, and survival) to 
patients with relapsed  or refractory MM relative to treatment with high-dose  dexamethason e. The 
study was also designed to determine the safety and tolerability of bortezomib relative to high-dose 
dexamethasone, and  whether treatment with bortezomib was assoc iated with supe rior clinical 
benefit and quality of life relative to high-dose  dexamethason e.  A total of 669 patients were enrolled 
and 663 patients received study drug (bortezomib:  331; de xamethason e: 332).  Bortezomib 
resulted in an increase in respon se rates, TTP, and OS. Updated response  rates and survival da ta 
were reported for M34101 -039.46   The phase 3 study (MMY 3002) known as the VISTA study, 
evaluated the safety and efficacy of the combination of bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone  in 
previously untreated multiple myeloma patients who were not cand idates for stem ce ll transp lant.47 
The study was designed to determine the benefit of adding bortezomib to melphalan and prednisone 
as assessed  by [CONTACT_91826]. The addition of bortezomib resulted in improvements in response  rate, TTP, 
time to next therapy, treatment-free interval, and OS with a higher incidence  of peripheral senso ry 
neuropathy and GI symptoms in the VMP group despi[INVESTIGATOR_442187]. 
 
3.3.2. Subcutaneous Administration 
 
After a randomized Phase  1 trial demonstrated similar drug exposu re, proteaso me inhibition, and 
efficacy and safety profiles between VELCADE IV and SC, a Phase  3 study compared the efficacy 
and safety of subc utaneous versus intravenous  bortezomib at the approved 1.3 mg/m2 dose  and 
twice per week schedu le in patients with relapsed  multiple myeloma.[ADDRESS_561817] intravenous  administration, with an improved 
safety profile.

 222 patients were randomly assigned to receive subcu taneous  (n=148) or intravenous  (n=74) 
bortezomib. The respon se-evaluable popu lation cons isted of 145 patients in the subc utaneous 
group and 73 in the intravenous  group. Patients received a median of eight cycles in both groups. 
ORR after four cycles was 42% in both groups  showing non-inferiority (p=0·002). After a median 
follow-up of 11.8 months in the subc utaneous  group and 12.0 months in the intravenous  group, 
there were no significant differences in time to progression and 1-year overall survival. 
 
Grade 3 or worse adverse events were reported in 84 (57%) patients in the subcu taneous group 
versus 52 (70%) in the intravenous  group; the most common were thrombocytopen ia (19 [13%] vs 
14 [19%]), neu tropen ia (26 [18%] vs 13 [18%]), and anae mia (18 [12%] vs six [8%]). Peripheral 
neuropathy of any grade (56 [38%] vs 39 [53%]; p=0.044), grade 2 or worse (35 [24%] vs 30 [41%]; 
p=0.012), and  grade 3 or worse (nine [6%] vs 12 [16%]; p=0.026) was significantly less common 
with subcu taneo us than with intravenous  administration. Subcutaneous  administration was locally 
well tolerated. In conc lusion, the SC administration of VELCADE has  good local tolerance. The 
systemic safety profile for the SC administration of VELCADE was assoc iated with a lower incidence 
of Grade ≥3 adverse events, and  treatment modifications (discon tinuations and dose  reductions). In 
particular, there was a lower incidence  of peripheral neu ropathy reported. Additional information 
regarding bortezomib is available in the current Investigator’s Brochure.

4, 8, and 11) at 1 .3 mg/m2/dose  followed by a 10-day rest pe riod for a 21 day cycle.  Dose 
modifications are permitted as per a prescribed algorithm.  Acyclovir at 400mg daily is 
recommended  as prophylaxis for he rpes zoster. 
 
Restaging scan s, with evaluation of respons e, will be done  every 2 cycles (6 weeks of 
treatment ± 7 days). Treatment will continue until clinical disease  progression, unacce ptable 
toxicity, treatment delay > 2 weeks, or at the discretion of the treating physician or patient. 
 
5.0 THERAPEUTIC/D IAGNOSTIC AGENTS 
 
5.1. Preparation, Handling,  Storage, and Destruction 
 
Bortezomib (VELCADE ) is available in sterile, single use vials containing 3.5 mg of 
VELCADE with a 1:10 ratio of bortezomib to mannitol. 
 
SUBCU TANEOUS: Each vial of VELCADE for Injection shou ld be recon stituted under 
a laminar flow biological cab inet (hood) within eight hours before dosing with 1.4 mL 
of normal (0.9%) sa line, Sodium Chloride Injection USP, so that the reconstituted 
solution contains VELCADE at a conce ntration of 2.5 mg/mL for subc utaneous 
administration. For injection site reactions, a  more dilute conce ntration of 1 mg/mL 
can be used. 
 
Vials containing lyophilized VELCADE® (bortezomib) for Injection shou ld be stored 
acco rding to the label requirements.  For the [LOCATION_002], store at USP Controlled 
Room Temperature which is 25ºC (77ºF); for Europe, do not s tore above 30ºC (86ºF); 
excursions permitted from 15 to 30ºC (59-86ºF). To date, stability data indicate that 
the lyophilized drug product is stable for at least [ADDRESS_561820] of the study. 
 
INTRAVEN OUS (used  ONLY in the event of intolerable subc utaneous  toxicity e.g. 
injection site reactions, see Section 5.3): Prior to IV administration, the contents of 
each  vial must be  recon stituted with 3.5 mL of normal (0.9%) saline (sodium chloride 
injection). The reconstituted product shou ld be a clear and colorless solution. 
Parenteral drug products shou ld be inspe cted visually for pa rticulate matter and 
discoloration prior to administration whene ver solution and container permit. If any 
discoloration or pa rticulate matter is obse rved, the recon stituted product s hould not 
be used.  
 
Bortezomib contains no antimicrobial preservative. When recons tituted as directed, 
bortezomib may be stored at 25 ºC (77ºF). Recon stituted VELCADE shou ld be 
administered within 8 hours of preparation. The recons tituted material may be stored 
in the original vial and /or the syringe prior to administration. The product may be 
stored for up to 8 hours in a syringe; ho wever, total storage time for the reconstituted 
material must not exceed 8 hours when exposed  to normal indoor lighting.

Amended:  2/7/[ADDRESS_561821] them from light. 
Dissolution is completed in approximately 10 seconds. The recon stituted solution is clear 
and colorless, with a final pH of 5 to 6.  Recon stituted bortezomib shou ld be administered 
promptly and in no case more than 8 hours after recons titution. 
 
5.2. Dispensing and Administration 
 
Drug will be administered only to eligible patients under the supe rvision of the investigator or 
identified subinvestigator(s).  Patients may be treated on an outpatient basis, if poss ible.The 
drug will be prepared under the supervision of a pharmacist, or appropriately qualified and 
trained personne l. The amount (in mg) of drug to be administered will be determined based 
on body  surface area.  Body surface area is to be calculated based  on body weight using a 
standa rd nomogram or calculation (Append ix D). The dose  shou ld be calculated prior to 
Cycle 1 Day 1 based  on weight measured at screening. Dose shou ld be recalculated at the 
start of a cycle only if a significant cha nge in weight has occurred (>10%). If a patient 
experiences  a notable change in weight within a cycle, as determined by [CONTACT_442202], then the patient’s dose  shou ld be recalculated at that time based on 
clinical judgment.  There must be  at least 72 hours between each  dose of bortezomib. 
 
IMPORTANT NOTE: Intravenous  and subcu taneous route of administration have different 
recons tituted conce ntrations.  Caution should be used  when calculating the volume to be 
administered. For administration: 
 
SUBCU TANEOUS: Administer subc utaneous ly – for subs equent dose s, administer at 
least 1 inch from an  old site and never ad minister to tende r, bruised, e rythematous, or 
indurated sites. If injection site reaction occurs, the more dilute 1 mg/mL 
concen tration may be used subcu taneous ly (Section 5.1). 
 
INTRAVEN OUS (used  ONLY in the event of intolerable subc utaneous  toxicity e.g. 
injection site reactions, see Section 5.3): Administer the appropriate dose  via rapid 
I.V. push  (approximately 3-5 secon ds). 
 
5.3. Precautions for Subcutaneous Admin istration 
 
• The drug quantity contained in one vial (3.5 mg) may exceed  the usual d ose 
required.  Caution shou ld be used  in calculating the dose  to prevent overdose. 
 
• When administered subcutaneous ly, sites for each injection (thigh or abd omen) shou ld 
be rotated. If local injection site reactions occur following VELCADE administration 
MEMORIAL SLOAN-KETTERING  CANCER CENTER 
IRB PROTOCOL  
IRB#: 12-222 A(5) 
Amended:  2/7/14 Page  14 of 48  
 subcu taneous ly, a less concen trated VELCADE solution (1 mg/mL instead of 2.5 mg/mL) 
may be administered subcutaneous ly.  Alternatively, the IV route of administration can be 
cons idered at the investigator’s discretion. In clinical trials of VELCADE IV, local skin 
irritation was reported in 5% of patients, but extravasation of VELCADE was not 
assoc iated with tissue  damage. In a clinical trial of subcu taneous VELCADE , a local 
reaction was reported in 6% of patients as an adverse event, mostly redness. Should IV 
bortezomib be used, the dosing and monitoring schedu le for pa tients is identical to that of 
SQ administration (Section 9.1 and Section 9.2.1 for dose  reduc tions) 
 
5.4. Binding,  Packaging, Labeling 
 
Bortezomib will be supp lied in vials as open -label stock.  Both the box label and  vial label will 
fulfill all requirements specified by [CONTACT_20556]. 
 
5.5. Drug D estruction

 9.0 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  PLAN 
 
9.1 Schedule and D ose Admini stration 
 
 
Bortezomib is to be administered subcu taneo usly in 21-day cycles at a dose of 1.3 
mg/m2/dose  on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment will only be initiated once  eligibility criteria 
have been  met and the appropriate pretreatment evaluations performed. 
 
 
Antiviral prophylaxis with 400 mg of acyclovir daily is recommended  for all patients as herpes 
zoster can occur c ommonly in patients who receive bortezomib without prophylaxis.  For 
sexually-active patients, it is recommended  that either 1  highly effective method of 
contraception or 2 effective methods  of contraception be used  as detailed in  Append ix F. 
Bortezomib will be continued  until: 
(1) disease  progression 
(2) unaccep table toxicity 
(3) treatment delay >2 weeks,  or 
(4) at the discretion of the patient or treating physician 
 
All drug will be administered to eligible patients under the supervision of the investigator or 
identified subinvestigator(s). The pharmacist will maintain records of drug receipt (if 
applicable), drug preparation, and dispens ing, including the applicable lot numbers, patients’ 
height, body  weight, and body  surface area, total drug administered in milliliters and 
milligrams, and  date and time of administration. Any discrepancy  between the calculated 
dose  and dose administered and the reason  for the discrepancy  must be  recorded in the 
source documents.

occu rred after the previous dose (s). Toxicities are to be assessed  according to the NCI 
Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.0, Append ix B). Should significant 
local reaction occur due  to subcu taneous administration, a  switch to the IV formulation at the 
same dose and schedu le can be considered but only at the investigator’s discretion. 
 
9.2.1. General Algori thm 
 
 
In general, all previously established  or new  toxicities observed any time are to be managed 
as described in the following table:

Starting dose  1.3 mg/m2 
Dose Level -1 1.0 mg/m2 
Dose Level -2 0.7 mg/m2 
 
 
If bortezomib has been  held: 
 
 
i) If the toxicity does  not resolve within ≤ [ADDRESS_561828] be  discontinued  
ii)   If the toxicity resolves as desc ribed in the table above, bortezomib can be restarted, 
however dose  must be  reduced  by [CONTACT_3450] 25% as follows: 
(1) If the patient was receiving 1.3 mg/m2, reduce  to Dose Level -1. 
(2) If the patient was receiving 1 mg/m2, reduce  to Dose Level -2 
(3) if the patient was receiving 0.7 mg/m2, discontinue drug unless patient is respond ing, 
in which case,  drug continuation at the discretion of the principal investigator. 
 
If the drug is discon tinued, every effort will be made to have patients evaluated for respo nse at 
the planned  time. If this is not poss ible, the patient will be cons idred a non-responde r. Please 
refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for information regarding the rationale behind the dose for 
each  dose  modification level as based  on previous experience  with bortezomib. 
 
Once bortezomib is reduced for any toxicity, the dose may not be re-esca lated. 
 
9.2.2.  Neurolo gic Toxicities 
  
Patients who experience  bortezomib-related neuropathic pain or peripheral senso ry

11.1. Anticipated To xicities 
 
 
A detailed list of anticipated side-effects from bo rtezomib treatment are included  in  Append ix 
A and discussed  in the Investigator’s Brochure. In general, the risks and side-effects of 
bortezomib as detailed in the informed consent include those  which are:

 11.2. Adverse and Serious  Adverse Event Definitions 
Adverse event (AE): any untoward medical occ urrence  in a patient or su bject administered 
subcu taneous  bortezomib. 
• The untoward medical occurrence  does  not nec essarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended  sign, symptom, 
or disease  temporally assoc iated with the use of bortezomib whether or not it is related to 
the bortezomib. 
• This includes  any newly occu rring event, or a previous cond ition that has  increased  in 
severity or frequency  since the administration of study drug. 
• For this protocol an  abnormal laboratory value will not be  assessed  as an AE unless that 
value leads  to discon tinuation or de lay in treatment, dose  modification, therapeu tic 
intervention, or is cons idered by [CONTACT_2418] a clinically significant change from 
base line. 
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE): any untoward medical occu rrence  that at any dose:  
• Results in death. 
• Is life-threatening 
o refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of dea th at the time of the event 
o does  not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused  death if it were 
more severe 
• Requires inpatient hosp italization or prolongation of an existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• Results in persistent or significant d isability or incapac ity 
o Disability is defined as a subs tantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal 
life functions 
• Is a congenital an omaly/birth defect. 
• Is a medically important event. 
o refers to an AE that may not result in death, be immediately life threatening, or 
require hosp italization, but may be cons idered serious when, based  on appropriate 
medical judgment 
▪ may jeopardize the patient 
▪ require medical or su rgical intervention to prevent one  of the outcomes listed 
above, or 
▪ involves suspec ted transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent 
(any organism, virus, or infectious particle e.g., prion protein transmitting 
Transmissible Spongiform Encepha lopathy, whether pathogenic or no n- 
pathogenic) 
o examples include allergic bronch ospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency  room or at home, blood dyscrasias or con vulsions that do  not result in 
inpatient hosp italization, or the development of drug dependency  or drug abuse  
 
 
As far as poss ible, each  adverse event shou ld be evaluated to determine: 
• severity grade via CTCAE v4.0 
• relationsh ip to study drug 
• duration (start and  end dates) 
action taken 
• whether or not it constitutes an SAE

who choose  to receive further care at an outside facility, every attempt to contact [CONTACT_264029]/or his/her treating physician will be made on a biannual bas is as well. OS will be 
measu red from the time of study treatment initiation. Patients who discon tinue treatment 
seconda ry to toxicity will continue to be followed on study until evidence  of resolution of 
toxicity to grade [ADDRESS_561832] v1.1 criteria. 
 
Complete Response  (CR): Disappea rance  of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph 
nodes  (whether target or non -target) must have reduc tion in short axis to <10 mm. 
 
Partial Response  (PR): At least a  30% decrease  in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference  the baseline sum diameters. 
 
Progressive Disease  (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference  the smallest sum on  study (this includes  the base line sum if that is the 
smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also 
demonstrate an abso lute increase  of at least 5  mm. (Note: the appea rance of one or more 
new lesions is also cons idered progression). 
 
 
Stable Disease  (SD): Neither s ufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor s ufficient increase  to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference  the smallest sum diameters while on study. 
 
12.2. “Best” Response 
 
The Best Objective Response  is recorded from the start of treatment until disease 
progression. In general, the patient’s best respon se assignment will depend  on the 
achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria. Note that Objective Response 
and progression free survival (PFS) are clinical endpo ints.

(ORR) to Bortezomib (partial+complete response s) by [CONTACT_13407] v1.1, evaluated at any 
time between treatment initiation and documented progression of diseas e. A Simon two- 
stage minimax design will be used  to test the null hypothesis of 10% response rate against 
the desired alternative of a 30% ORR, with a one-sided type I error (probability of falsely 
accep ting a non-promising therapy) of 10% and power of 90%. The null hypothesis is based 
on historical data of best  objective respo nse of non-small cell lung carcinomas to cytotoxic 
chemotherapy after failure of first-line chemotherapy (range from 8-10%). In the first stage of 
this design, [ADDRESS_561835] 2 responses  are obse rved, then an 
additional 9 patients will be accrued to the seco nd stage. At the end of the study, if 5 or more 
patients respond  out of a total of 25 patients enrolled, the treatment will be cons idered worthy 
of further investigation in this patient popu lation. Under this design, the expected sample size 
is 25, and the probab ility of early termination is 51%. 
 
Patients who receive at least one dose  of the drug will be evaluable for response.  For 
patients who discon tinue the drug before the documented progression via RECIST v1.1, 
every effort will be made to have a final e valuation scan. If this is not poss ible, they will be 
cons idered non-respon ders. 
 
With an expected accrual rate at MSKCC of 1-[ADDRESS_561836] to complete accrual within 8 months (if study will be stopped  after the first stage) or 
12-18 months (if patients will be accrued for both stages). 
 
Progression-Free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) will be calculated using Kaplan-Meier 
estimators starting from the time of treatment initation. Patients will be followed-up until 
progression of disease  or death (for PFS) or un til death (for OS). Patients who do not 
experience  the event of interest during the study time will be censo red at the time of the last 
available follow-up.

 Pharmacovigilance  (or designee).  Planned  hosp ital ad missions or su rgical procedu res for an 
illness  or disease  that e xisted before the patient was enrolled in the trial are not to be 
cons idered AEs unless the cond ition deteriorated in an unexpected manner during the trial 
(e.g., surgery was performed earlier or later than planned ).  All SAEs should be monitored 
until they are resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic 
cond ition or intercurrent illness (es). 
 
This is an investigator-initiated study. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_442192] J. Riely, MD, PhD 
(who may also sometimes be referred to as the sponso r-investigator), is conduc ting the study 
and acting as the sponsor. Therefore, the legal/ethical ob ligations of the principal investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_442193] a sponsor  and those of an investigator. 
 
Sponso r-investigator must report all SAEs, regardless of expectedness  or relationsh ip with 
any study drug, to Millennium Pharmacovigilance  (or des ignee) as  soon  as poss ible, but no 
later than 5 calendar da ys of the spons or-investigator’s observation or awareness  of the 
event.  Subinvestigators must report all SAEs to the sponso r-investigator so that the 
sponso r-investigator can meet his/her foregoing reporting obligations to Millennium 
Pharmacovigilance, un less otherwise agreed between the sponso r-investigator and 
subinvestigator(s).  Millennium Pharmacovigilance  (or designee) may request follow-up 
information to a reported SAE, which the sponsor -investigator will be responsible for 
providing to Millennium Pharmacovigilance  (or designee). 
 
The SAE report must include event term(s), serious criteria, and  the investigator’s or sub - 
investigator’s determination of both the intensity of the event(s) and  the relationship of the 
event(s) to study drug administration. Intensity for each  SAE, including any lab abno rmality, 
will be determined by [CONTACT_149629], version used  at your institution, as a guideline, 
whenever poss ible.  The criteria are available online at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html.  Relationship to all study drugs for each  SAE will be 
determined by [CONTACT_9940] -investigator by [CONTACT_442211]: Is 
there a reasonab le possibility that the AE is associated with the study drug(s)? 
 
Sponso r-investigator must also provide Millennium Pharmacovigilance with a copy  of all 
communications with applicable regulatory authorities related to the study or study drug(s), 
including, but not limited to, telephone  conversation logs, as soon  as possible but no later 
than [ADDRESS_561841] Information:

b Acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary disease  is a MedDRA Lower Level Term 
which correspo nds to a Preferred Term of Interstitial lung diseas e. 
 
ADDITIONAL NOTES: 
 
Other medical events of interest that a re cons idered not causa lly related to bortezomib 
include hepa tic failure and QT prolongation.  Fatal outcomes have been  reported. 
 
Women of childbea ring potential shou ld avoid becoming pregnant while being treated with 
bortezomib. Genotoxicity testing has shown that bortezomib is negative in the in vitro Ames 
assay  and in the in vivo micronuc leus assay, but it is a clastogen in the in vitro chromosomal 
aberration assa y. 
 
Additional de tails on the potential risks of bortezomib may be found  in the current 
Investigator’s Brochu re.

 APPENDIX D: Body Surface Area and Creatinine Clearance  Calculations 
 
 
 
 
 
Body surface area (BSA) shou ld be calculated using a standa rd nomogram that yields the 
following results in meters squared (m2): 
 
BSA = (W 0.425 x H 0.725) x 0.007184 
where the weight is in kilograms and the height is in centimeters. 
DuBois D, DuBois EF. A formula to estimate the approximate surface area if height 
and weight be known. Arch Intern Medicine. 1916;  17:863-71 
 
 
 
Creatinine clearance  (CrCl) can be calculated using the Cockroft-Gault equation as follows: 
CrCl (ml/min) = (140 - age) (actual wt in kg) 
 
72 × serum creatinine (mg/dl) 
 
For females, use 85% of calculated CrCl value. 
 
Note:  In markedly obese  patients, the Cockroft-Gault formula will tend to overestimate 
the creatinine clearance. (Adipose  tissue  tends to contribute little creatinine requiring 
renal c learance.)

The following table presents the NYHA classification of cardiac disease. 
 
Class  Functional Capacity Objective 
Assessment 
I Patients with cardiac disease but without resulting limitations of 
physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue 
fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea, or anginal pain. No objective evidence 
of cardiovascular 
disease. 
II Patients with cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of physical 
activity. They are comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity 
results in fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea, or anginal pain. Objective evidence of 
minimal cardiovascular 
disease. 
III Patients with cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of physical 
activity. They are comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity 
causes fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea, or anginal pain. Objective evidence of 
moderately severe 
cardiovascular 
disease. 
IV Patients with cardiac disease resulting in inability to carry on any 
physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of hea rt failure or the 
anginal syndrome may be present even at rest. If any physical 
activity is undertaken, discomfort is increased. Objective evidence of 
severe cardiovascular 
disease.

 APPENDIX F:  Pregna ncy and Effective Methods of Contraception 
 
 
It is not known what effects bortezomib has on human pregnancy  or de velopment of the 
embryo or fetus. Therefore, female patients participating in this study should avoid beco ming 
pregnant, and male patients shou ld avoid impregnating a female partner.  Non sterilized 
female patients of reproductive age and male patients shou ld use effective methods  of 
contraception through defined periods during and after study treatment as  spec ified below. 
Female patients must meet 1 of the following: 
• Postmenopausal  for at least 1 year before the screening visit, or 
• Surgically sterile, or 
• If they are of childbea ring potential, agree to practice [ADDRESS_561855] 1 of these 2 methods  be highly effective (see 
examples below). 
 
Highly effective methods  Other effective methods  
(barrier methods) 
Intra-uterine devices (IUD) Latex condom  
Hormonal co ntraceptives (birth control 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]/oral con traceptives, injectable 
contraceptives, contraceptive patches, or 
contraceptive implants) Diaphragm with spermicide 
Cervical cap  
Sponge 
If one of the highly effective methods  cannot be  used, using 2 effective methods  at 
the same time is recommended.  
 
 
Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status post vasectomy) must agree to 1 of the 
following: 
• Practice effective barrier con traception during the entire study treatment p eriod and 
through a minimum of [ADDRESS_561856] dose of study drug, or completely abstain 
from heterosexual intercourse.

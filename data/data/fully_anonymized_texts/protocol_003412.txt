 1 Introduction  
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted 
according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 
312 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable governm ent 
regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures.  
1.1 Background  
It is estimated that 241,740 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2012. From 
2005 -2009 the median age at diagnosis for cancer of the prostate was 67 years of age; 
approximately 9.5% between the ages of 45 and 54, 31.6% between 55 and 64, and 
35.5% between 65 and 74 years old. (1).  
For most cancer patients, the most common side effects of cancer as a disease, and cancer 
treatment are pain, depression and fatigue (2). Can cer –related Fatigue (CRF) is defined 
as “a common, persistent, and subjective sense of tiredness related to cancer or to 
treatment of cancer that interferes with usual functioning (3). CRF differs from everyday 
life fatigue, which is usually temporary and  can be reli eved by [CONTACT_59608]. The impact 
of CRF on a patient‟s ability to function in daily life is considerable and has been found 
to adversely affect patients‟ quality of life even more than pain (4 -8).  Fatigue is reported 
in 40 -75% of cancer pati ents. The prevalence of CRF increased to 60 -93% in patients 
receiving radiotherapy (RT) (4 -6), and when Visual Analogue Fatigue Scales were used, 
the percentage rose up to 99% (9).  
However too many cancer patients suffering from fatigue receive inadequate treatment 
for their symptoms (2). The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines 
recommend that integrative non -pharmacologic interventions be implemented for 
managing CRF. Various studies demonstrated positive effect from physical activity 
intervent ions during and after cancer treatment. These studies also showed that exercise 
is safe and well tolerated by [CONTACT_190104] (10 -13).  
Specifically, prostate cancer patients report high levels of urina ry and sexual adverse 
effects with more than half of the patients report ing poor sexual drive (14). Erectile 
[Yoga For Prostate Cancer]    
Version: 09/ 24/2014

 dysfunction (ED) is defined by [CONTACT_190105] “the inability to achieve 
or maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory se xual performance ” (15). ED is 
reported in 21% to 85% of patients (16 -19). The etiology of ED after RT is still 
debatable, with studies demonstrating occlusive vascular disease and hemodynamics 
interferences, nerve damage and or damage to the proximal penile structures, suc h as the 
penile bulb, the neurovascular bundle, and the local vascular structures (16 , 18). Urinary 
incontinence (UI) is loss of bladder control. There are several forms of UI. The most 
common type is stress incontinence, which is caused by a loss of outle t resistance at the 
bladder neck. UI occurs when the bladder detrusor  muscle contracts involuntarily during 
bladder filling, and is a more common side effect of RT. The prevalence of UI after RT is 
24% and may take years to develop (14, 16).  
The popularity  of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has been growing 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_190092] 69% of American s now using some modality 
of CAM (20). Among cancer patients the prevalence of CAM use has increased two to 
threefold in the last two decades (21 -23). Most cancer patients use CAM hopi[INVESTIGATOR_190093], relieve pain and control cancer and cancer treatment‟s side effects 
(24). The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) 
defines CAM as “a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices and 
products that are not presently considered to be part of conventional medicine ” 
(http://nccam.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/ ). Research on the use of yoga as a modality for 
alleviating prostate cancer patients‟ side effects has been minimal (25).  
“The primary aim of yoga is to restore the mind to simplicity and peace, and free it from 
confusion and distress. This sense of calm comes from the practice of  yogic asanas and 
pranayama.” B.S. K. Iyengar.  Yoga rejuvenates the body, restor es natural energy, 
decreases pain, reduces stress, as well as increases muscular strength and flexibility. 
Nevertheless, most research done in the past using yoga as a treatme nt modality used 
women and breast cancer patients as the treatment groups. Participation of men in yoga 
may be a challenge . The first goal of our study is to evaluate the feasibility of using yoga 
as a treatment modality in prostate cancer patients. If suc cessful, we will continue 
seamlessly to a randomized study to determine the effects of yoga on fatigue as measured 
by [CONTACT_190106] (BFI). We will also ascertain the effects of yoga on overall

 QOL as measured by [CONTACT_190107] C ancer Therapy -General (FACT -G) 
instrument, E.D. and U.I by [CONTACT_190108]. The 
long-term goal of our study is to determine the approximate effect of yoga on fatigue and 
QOL to inform a subsequent larger randomized study  of yoga compared to a control 
group of patients receiving standard supportive care.  QOL instruments will be 
administered pretreatment, during  treatment, and within a week of the last yoga class or

and patients‟ quality of life , in addition to standard of care,  during active radiation 
therapy.

radiation therapy.  
4. To examine the effect of yoga intervention on caregiver quality of life during 
patient‟s active ra diation therapy  as measured by [CONTACT_92349] -G 
 
[Yoga For Prostate Cancer]    
Version: 09/ 24/[ADDRESS_225222] of a prelim inary study of 
feasibility , and a two -arm, phase 2 randomized study of efficacy, with a go/ no -go 
decision for phase 2 based on feasibility .  
2. Those enrolled in the feasibility study will be part of the yoga treatment arm at 
analysis time.  
3.2 Study Measures  
1. Baseline information will be collected prior to start of yoga therapy . (age, 
race/ethnicity, marital/partner status, educational history, income, residence 
location, travel time to facility, method of travel, details regarding co -morbidities, 
disease stage , detail of their current radiotherapy).  
2. The Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) questionnaire is a 9 –item scale that will be used 
to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_190094]. The first three questions rate the severity of the 
patient‟s fatigue at its “worst”, “usual” a nd “now” levels over the last 24 hours, 
with 0 meaning “no fatigue” and 10 being “fatigue as bad as you can imagine”. Six 
questions assess the amount that fatigue has interfered with different aspects of the 
patient‟s life during the past 24 hours. The interference items include general 
activity, mode, walking ability, normal work (inc ludes both work outside the home 
and housework), relations with others, and enjoyment of life. The interference 
questions are measured on a 0 -10 scale, with 0 being “does not interfere” and 10 
being “completely interferes”. Scores on this scale range from  0-10, with a mean 
score of 4.7 and S.D of 2.8.  The BFI questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_190110]:  
a. Prior to start of radiotherapy i.e. on the day of consultation or on the day of 
simulation  or setup .  
b.  Bi-weekly while receiv ing radiotherapy  
[Yoga For Prostate Cancer]    
Version: 09/ 24/[ADDRESS_225223] -G is a commonly used instrument measuring general QOL reflecting 
symptoms or problems associated with malignancies across 4 scales: physical 
well-being (7 items); social/family well -being (7 items); emotional well -being (6 
items); and functional well -being (7 items).   Patients rate all items using a five -
point rating scale ranging from “not at all” to “very much.”   The measure yields 
information about total QOL, as well as information about the dimensions of 
physical well -being, and disease -specific concer ns.  Six additional experimental 
items request information regarding how each dimension affects QOL, using a 
“0” (not at all) to “10” (very much so) rating scale.    FACT -G is a 27 item 
compi[INVESTIGATOR_190095] 4 primary QOL domains: ph ysical

i. A treatment week is defined as [ADDRESS_225226] yoga class or by [CONTACT_190109].  
5. The International Prostate Symptom Score Sheet (IPSS) will be used to determine 
the severity of enlarge d prostate conditions and measures UI symptoms. Scores on 
this scale range from 0 to 35, where a score of 8 -19 indicate moderately 
symptomatic, and 20 -35 – severely sympto matic. The 8th question on this scale is 
on QOL and is assigned a score of 1 to 6 , where 6 indicates terrible. The IPSS 
will be completed by [CONTACT_190112]:

modified based on each subjects specific needs and restrictions.  Not all yoga 
poses will be performed each session. Each session will begin with breathing and 
centering techniques (taking inventory of the levels of energy, posture, stres s, 
emotions, and breath). Yoga poses will consist of the following:  
 Sitting on chair: neck and shoulder series (neck and shoulders side, fr ont 
and back movements, shoulder rolls, and arms movement), table pose with 
opposite arm and leg movement, side bend (seated Parighasana), simple 
chair twist (Bharadvajasana).  
 Standing poses:  mountain pose (Tadasana Samasthithi), warrior II series 
(Virab hadrasana II), half moon (Ardha Chandrasana) variation at the wall, 
front warrior series, forward stretch/ bend variation (Uttanasana).  
 Recline poses will include: inverted lake pose (Viparita Karani), bridge 
pose variation (Setubandha Sarvangasana), recl ine/ sited bound angle pose 
(Supta Baddhakonasana), camel pose (Ustrasana) at the wall, modified 
shoulder stand (salamba sarvangasana), reclining big toe posture with a belt

their eligibility and interest in enrollment.  This survey would be offered to all prostate 
cancer patients seen in the department of radiation oncology during both the feasibility 
and randomized phases of the trial. The questionnaires from all patients who complete 
one will be analyzed as a separate, smaller part of the overall study  to better understand 
barriers  and promoters  to enrollment.  Patients  and caregivers  will be officially enrolled in 
the study only after eligibility is confirmed, the informed consent process is performed 
and relevant signatures are obtained.

    Feasibility and Yoga Treatment Arm  
Subjects will participate in two 75 minute sessions per week for  the duration of radiation 
treatment  with a yoga instructor  offered for free by [CONTACT_190115] . Numerous sessions will be offered each week. 
Each session will begin with breathing and centering techniques (taking invento ry of the 
levels of energy, posture, stress level, emotions, and breath). Yoga poses will consist of 
the following  and can be modified based on patient needs : Sitting on chair: neck and 
shoulder series (neck and shoulders side, front and back movements, sh oulder rolls, and

asked to complete all study -related questionnaires at the same time points as the patients 
in the yoga treatment arm.   
7 Statistical Plan  
7.1 Design  
This is a feasibility study followed by a seamless transition to a randomized phase II 
study.  
7.1.1 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_190096] (aim 1) will be declared if we successfully accrue [ADDRESS_225237] 75 approached.  Patients participating in the feasibility portion of the study will move 
seamlessly into the phase II study. The data from these patients will be included in the 
phase II trial portion of this study.  Given the number of prostate cancer patients 
historically treated in the Radiation Oncology department, we anticipate that this rate of 
enrollment would allow completion of the ph ase II trial within <3 years.  
7.1.2  Randomized phase II trial  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Sample size determination  
Our goal is to estimate effect sizes for a larger study. We are setting our recruitment aim 
for phase 2 up to 48 subjects , a 20% increase from our target enrollment in order to 
account for potential subject drop out and arrive at N = 40. Inclusion of subject data from 
[Yoga For Prostate Cancer]    
Version: 09/ 24/2014  
14 
 the feasibility portion results in N = 55 up to N = [ADDRESS_225238] attrition levels prove 
lower than expe cted. Two groups (35 v 20) give us power to estimate an effect size for 
yoga participation with a 95% confidence interval that is approximately 1.[ADDRESS_225239] -
deviations wide (compared to the SD of the raw measure). For the corresponding care -
givers, two gro ups (20 v 20) give power to estimate a CI that is 1.[ADDRESS_225240] 
will be measured as a time x treatment interaction (difference of difference scores).  From 
our own preliminary data, and from Hwang et al. (2008), we know that the within subject 
correlation for fatigue measures is approximately 0.5, and that the SD for the difference 
score will be similar to that of the raw measure at individual time points.  For the time x 
treatment interaction, we will be able to detect a standardized effect size  of d=0.7  (0.8 for 
caregivers)  at α=0.05 (one -sided) with 80% power.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Statistical Methods  
This randomized study is a two -arm longitudinal controlled trial of yoga as a means of 
reducing fatigue over the course of radiation therapy for prostate cancer, with  measures 
taken prior to treatment, during treatment, and in follow -up. The analysis will include the 
initial subjects from the feasibility study as an addition to the treatment arm, and we will 
control for any differences between the feasibility group and  the randomized treatment 
arm using indicators.  The primary measure, and most secondary measures, are Likert -
style summary scores on a [ADDRESS_225241] data cleaning procedures will be applied (e.g., 
checking for outliers and data entry errors, creating summary scores for analysis, and 
checking that analysis assumptions are met).  The assumption s underlying the statistical 
methods will be examined through the use of standard tests of normality, and graphical 
displays (27).  All analyses will be conducted using Stata software (Stata Corporation, 
College Station, TX).   
 
[Yoga For Prostate Cancer]    
Version: 09/ 24/2014  
15 
 We will calculate descripti ve statistics for all variables in the study.  For outcome 
variables, we will summarize by [CONTACT_1570] (Yoga versus control) and by [CONTACT_190116].  We will also estimate correlations within subject for each of the study measures 
taken at different times.   
 
The primary outcome for the randomized, phase II study will be the difference score of 
BFI fatigue while undergoing radiation therapy minu s BFI fatigue prior to radiation.  The 
primary hypothesis will be tested using a two -group t -test to compare difference scores 
between Yoga and control groups.  This will be a one -sided test with type -1 error at 
a=0.05.  Similar analysis will be conducted using BFI fatigue at follow -up versus pre -
radiation, and for all of the FACT -G fatigue measures. We will test the difference using a 
one-sided z-test. The FACT -G analysis will be repeated for caregivers (Aim 4).  
 
Effect sizes will be reported for all outco me measures as standardized differences.  The 
effect size will reflect the time x treatment interaction, and the standard deviations will be 
adjusted for within -subject correlation to aid in designing a larger study.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Subject Population(s) for Analysis  
Statistically e valuable subjects  are those who have attended at least 50% of the available 
yoga sessions  offered on the days they receive radiation treatment .

8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Assessing and Reporting of AE/ SAE’s  
Although we do not anticipate any a dverse and serious adverse events  occurring from 
participation  in this trial, should  any AE‟s or Serious Adverse Events (SAE) occur and  are 
determined by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_190097] l be reported to the IRB and Data Safety and 
Monitoring Committee (DSMC) in accordance with the specific procedures of each entity.  
Should any SAE‟s or AE‟s occur they will be assessed using NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 (CTCAE 4.0)   
 
8.[ADDRESS_225242] (IRB) Notification by [CONTACT_190117]:  
 
Unanticipa ted problems are:  
(1) Unforeseen; and (2) indicate that participants are at increased risk of harm.  The IRB 
requires investigators to submit reports of the following problems within 10 working days 
with one exception : an Adverse Event (regardless of whet her the event is serious or non -
serious, on -site or off -site) that occurs any time during or after the research study, which 
in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_190098].  
 
Note:  An event is “unexpected ” when its specificity and severity are not accurately 
reflected in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol, 
[Yoga For Prostate Cancer]    
Version: 09/ 24/2014  
17 
 any applicable investigator brochure, and the current IRB -approved informed consent 
document, and (b) other rele vant sources of information, such as product labeling and 
package inserts; an event is “related to the research procedures” if the event is deemed 
probably or definitely related.  
 
The one exception  for prompt reporting within 10 days applies to death of a research 
participant.  If the adverse event involved death as unforeseen and indicates participants 
or others are at increased risk of harm, a submitted  report will be required within three 
working days.  
 
All non -serious adverse events will be reported to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_190099].  Further reporting details can be found in the accompanying 
manual of operating procedures.  
 
8.3 Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) Notification by [CONTACT_190118], unrelated event that is a Grade 3 or higher should be reported to the 
DSMC within 10 days.  All unexpected deaths or deaths related to the study agent or 
device need to be reported to the DSMC within 24 hours.  Al l other AEs should be 
reported within 30 days of knowledge. Any SAEs, regardless of site, are to be reported to 
the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_874] 24 hours via telephone or email.    
 
8.4 Abramson Cancer Center’s Internal Data and Safety Monitoring  
Data and  Safety Monitoring Committee  
The Abramson Cancer Center DSMC is charged with the responsibility of reviewing all 
SAEs, deviations, and Medical/Safety Monitoring reports for all cancer -based protocols 
conducted at the University of Pennsylvania.  The DSMC r eviews these document and 
data on a monthly basis and makes recommendation necessary to ensure subject safety 
and study integrity.  The Department of Compliance and Monitoring (DOCM) will 
[Yoga For Prostate Cancer]    
Version: 09/ 24/[ADDRESS_225243] of all cancer -based studi es in accordance with 
their National Cancer Institute -approved Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Plan.   
 
Protocol Exceptions / Deviations  
Occasionally, the investigator may need to deviate from the approved protocol.  
Deviations are categorized as reportable and non -reportable.  Reportable deviations may 
be urgent or not.  Urgent deviations may occur on the spot as necessary to protect the 
safety of a study subject and do not allow enough time for reporting in advance.  
However, they must be reported as soon as possible.  
All exceptions/ deviations from the study protocol will be handled as follows:  
 
An exception is a  one time, intentional  action or process that departs from the IRB and 
CTSRMC approved study protocol, intended for one occurrence. If the action disrupts the 
study progress, such that the study design or outcome (endpoints) may be compromised, 
or the action compromises the safety  and welfare of study subjects, advance  documented 
IRB and DSMC approval is required  
 
A deviation is a  one time, unintentional  action or process that departs from the IRB and 
DSMC approved study protocol, involving one incident and identified retrospective ly, 
after the event occurred. If the impact on the protocol disrupts the study design, may 
affect the outcome (endpoints) or compromises the safety and welfare of the subjects, the 
deviation must be reported to the DSMC within 5 business days and the IRB w ithin 10 
business days.  
 
 Non-Reportable - During the course of a study, there may be times 
when deviations are outside of the control of the investigator (i.e. a 
subject not showing up for a study visit, laboratory errors, subject 
confusion, etc.).  These types of deviations are not reportable (u nless 
they occur at a level that impacts any of the reportable categories), but 
they must be documented in a timely manner to show the impact of the 
deviation and corrective/follow -up actions that are being  taken.  
[Yoga For Prostate Cancer]    
Version: 09/ 24/2014  
19 
 Documentation can be in clinic/progress n otes or in notes/memos to 
file.  Notes/memos should be signed and dated.  
 
 Reporting Deviations/Exceptions  - Reports to the IRB and DSMC 
will be done via the DSMC website at www.ctsrmc.org .  Reportable 
deviations must also be sent to the study MM (if applicable). Please 
reference above section.   
 
[ADDRESS_225244] of 1996 
(HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject 
of the following:  
 What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in t his 
study  
 Who will have access to that information and why  
 Who will use or disclose that information  
 The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
[CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of 
subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, 
attempts will be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the 
subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
9.2 Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other 
activities in a clinical trial necessa ry for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  
Source data are contained in source documents.  Examples of these original documents 
[Yoga For Prostate Cancer]    
Version: 09/ 24/2014

 and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, 
memoranda, subjects‟ diar ies or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, 
recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_14848], microfiches, photographic negatives, 
microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at 
the laboratories, and at medico -technical departments involved in the clinical trial.  
9.3 Case Report Forms  
Electronic case report forms will be developed and completed in Velos in lieu of paper 
case rep ort forms with the exception of Eligibility and AE/SAE form s which will be 
printed out to be signed by [CONTACT_978].  
 
9.4 Records Retention  
HIPAA Retention Period (45 CFR164.530(j):  
Protected Health Information (PHI) Research Requests (HIPAA1 -008): Records 
documenting research requests, privacy board review or privacy officer expedited review, 
background material, and acceptance or denial of request. Retain 15 years after research 
completed.  
 
Protected Health Information Disclosure Records (HIPAA1 -009): Docu menting the 
release of PHI, including both authorized and unauthorized  releases. Should include 
the date of release, to whom the information was released, and the circumstances of the 
release. Retain 15 years after research completed.  
 
Maintenance of HIPAA  records is independent of the regulations for clinical study 
records.  All records of PHI research requests and any type of release will maintained for 
15 years after the research is fully terminated.

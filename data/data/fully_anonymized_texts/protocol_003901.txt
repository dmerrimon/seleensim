Version 7. 2 
• The overall protocol now matches the specific LUS protocol.  
• The time window for blood draws was clarified. The first draw needs to occur during the ER stay.  The 
final pre -discharge draw needs to occurs as soon as possible prior to discharge.  
• The reassessments have been modified. Rather than every [ADDRESS_865168].   The protocol figure has thus been modified 
accordingly, as well as the LUS imaging times and other places within the protocol.  
• The schedule of events has also been updated to reflect the aforementioned changes  
Versio n 7.6 
• Changed the time stamp to reflect first recorded time stamp patient was placed in a room to be seen 
by a physician  or the first time AHF treatment is given, whichever comes first.  The second part was 
added in case treatment is given by a triage physician . 
• Clarified dosing of Lasix in protocol to a maximum dose of 200mg at any one time.  
• Estimated urine output is accep table.  
• Clarifications to the protocol re: treatment per the usual care arm.  
• Windows for follow up calls clarified.  
Version 7. 8 
1. Clarified the name [CONTACT_646186] (T24 changed to HD2) to ensure Image Nomenclature protocol 
and the Study protocol are the  same  
- Dropped urine output guidance from treatment protocol  
- Extended the time window of the study to [ADDRESS_865169] treatment.  We did this b/c time of order of treatment and 
actual receipt of treatment were potentially large time windows.  We wanted to avoid repeating US before 
any treatment was received.  Unfortunately,this has led to more confusion as occasionally, patients receive 
treatment BEFORE the first US. How to account for this time h as been challenging.  As a result, we will revert 
to the original protocol; time of first US as the benchmark.

2  INTRODUCTION: BAC KGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE   
 
2.1 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON  
Over one million hospi[INVESTIGATOR_646086]. Within 30 days after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], over 25% of 
AHF patients will be dead or re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].25 By [CONTACT_646142][INVESTIGATOR_059], up to 67% of patients will be re -
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_82800] 36% will be dead.[ADDRESS_865176] expensive reason for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].28 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_646087], considerably less progress has been seen in AHF.29-31  
The emergency department (ED) initiates diagnosis and management for the vast majority of AHF patients.  Nearly 80% 
of all admissions originate from the ED. Delays in diagnosis, misdiagnosis, and delayed or improper treatme nt are costly, 
associated with greater morbidity and mortality .32,[ADDRESS_865177] expensive decisions in healthcare is made routinely 
from the ED; who gets hospi[INVESTIGATOR_646088]. discharged. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_646089], ED AHF pharmacological 
management today is largely the same as [ADDRESS_865178], guidelines state: “the treatment of AHF remains 
largely opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]- based with little good evidence to guide therapy.”35  Consensus statements from the American Heart 
Association as well as a working group from the NHLBI on ED AHF managemen t further corroborate this lack of 
evidence: “the evidence base on which this foundation of acute care is built is astonishly thin.”9,[ADDRESS_865179] 
by [CONTACT_646143] (HF) —  for example, dyspnea, orthopnea, edema, and weight gain.  Yet how to 
best assess, grade, and manage congestion is not well established.39,41  Only recently has t he dosing of IV loop diuretics 
been studied; however patients were enrolled up to [ADDRESS_865180], therapeutic recommendations from the ACCF/AHA begin with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_646090], 
highlighting the absence of ED based evidence.[ADDRESS_865181] yet to 
be updated.42  We argue this lack of evidence leads to tremendous variation in  ED care. Combined, this contributes to 
worse outcomes.  
Targeting Congestion in AHF  
Freedom from congestion is associated with improved outcomes;43-[ADDRESS_865182]: “…no method to assess congestion prior to discharge has 
been validated.”39 While physical exam is currently the cornerstone of 
congestion assessment, it lacks sensitivity and inter -rater reliability.53,54 The ED 
is the beginning of AHF management for >75% of admitted patients;55,[ADDRESS_865183] been considered ‘off -limits’ to ultrasound: with 
aerated lungs, the ultrasound beam is reflected and scattered due to acoustic 
mismatch.57,58 However, in the setting of pulmonary congestion, extra vascular 
lung water (EVLW) can be directly visualized and quantitated.58-60 Lung ultrasound measurement of B -lines are an 
objective, semi -quantitative measure of extra vascular lung water (EVLW).60 B-lines are well- defined, vertical echogenic 
lines, originating from water- thickened interlobular septa.60 (Figure 1) They are a marker of congestion.  
LUS improves diagnostic accuracy and is highly reproducible.61-[ADDRESS_865184]  been reported as low as 5.1% and 7.4%, respectively.[ADDRESS_865185] to affirm the diagnosis of AHF, more t han natriuretic peptide (NP) (likelihood ratio positive for the diagnosis of AHF 
by [CONTACT_646144] 7.4 (95% CI 4.2- 12.8) and LR negative 0.16, (95% CI 0.05- 0.51)).[ADDRESS_865186] chronically elevated NP levels.  Recent guideli ne and consensus statements also support the use of 
LUS for diagnosis.69-73   

10 
 Importantly, B- lines are a dynamic marker. In dialysis patients, B- lines decrease markedly pre/post dialysis.[ADDRESS_865187] ECHO platform or US machines.63,82 The ease 
of LUS will facilitate its generalizability and dissemination. Non -physicians may be future users of bedside LUS 
assessment, further supporting its generalizability.  
We will also perform serial measures of LUS during h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_646091].75,76,83  By [CONTACT_646145][INVESTIGATOR_059], we will better understand the 
trajectory of LUS B- line resolution, and determine whether futur e 
studies should continue to target LUS B -lines during inpatient 
therapy. We will also track physical exam, NTproBNP levels, eGFR, 
and hemoglobin/hematocrit levels as other measures of 
decongestion, to better understand the downstream impact of ED 
care.50,84,85 This will allow us to better discriminate the value of LUS 
compared to other measures.  
Prior Studies  
Sonographic evidence of pulmonary congestion is associated with 
worse outcomes.  
We performed a single center pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] 44 patients who presented to the ED with dyspnea, evidence of B lines by 
[CONTACT_646146], and were admitted for AHF.  Patients underwent LUS imaging during the ED (T0), within 24 hours (T1) and at 
discharge (Td).  Vital status was determined by [CONTACT_646147] 90 days.  Using a pre -specified cut -off of 15 B-
lines as a marker of persistent pulmonary congestion, 50% of patients had evidence of EVLW at Td.  The 28 sector 
scoring method was utilized.60,64 The average number of  B-lines at T0 was 78±47 with a statistically significant reduction 
at T1 (44±33, p<.001) and Td (26±26, p<.05). (See Figure 2) Thirty -two patients (73%) were successfully contact[CONTACT_190620] -up.   
During the follow -up period (median: 58 days, interquartile range: 
44-82 days) 15 events occurred: 2 deaths and 12 all -cause re -
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. In the subset of patients who experienced events 
during follow -up, 93% were discharged with persistent presence 
of pulmonary congestion (> 15 B -lines) as measured by [CONTACT_646146].   
Another  pi[INVESTIGATOR_529132] (n=100) admitted to a cardiology 
ward for shortness of breath and clinical concern for AHF 
demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in B lines at 
discharge (20+/ - 23) vs. admission (48+/ -48, p<.0001).  At 6 -month 
follow up, patients with ≥ 15 B -lines at discharge were significantly 
more likely to be re- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. (HR 11.7 (95% CI 1.3 -106.6) (See 
Figure 3).76 In 27% of patients wit h >30 B -lines, no rales were 
reported by [CONTACT_162014].  
Additional work  performed by [CONTACT_646148], Vicki 
Noble, demonstrated a strong correlation between LUS B -lines and patients undergoing dialysis. This proof of concept 
supports B -lines as r esponsive to the removal of fluid.74  Coiro et.al. recently published a study of LUS performed 
throughout hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], demonstrating the prognostic significance of resid ual congestion, as measured by B -lines.

Importantly, these pi[INVESTIGATOR_646092].  What has not been tested however, is the use of LUS to guide therapy.  
2.3 POTENTI AL RISKS AND BENEFIT S  
 
2.3.1  KNOWN  POTENTIAL RISKS  
Overview . Current ED AHF treatment involves the use of non -invasive ventilation (NIV), IV loop diuretics, and IV, SL, or 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_646093].  Each of these are highlighted in guidelines.  However, the level of evidence supporting these 
treatments is relatively weak, with the strongest evidence supporting the use of IV loop diuretics.  The evidence is even 
weaker for ED AHF treatment; for example, the AHA/ACC guidelines begin with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], highlighting the lack of 
evidence for ED AHF care. Although the evidence is weak, these medications are the current standard of care for AHF.  In 
patients receiving strategy -of-care, only therapi[INVESTIGATOR_646094]. There are NO novel therapie s or 
unapproved treatments.  
Common Risks . The greatest risks are not necessarily different than those already associated with these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
However, the risk may or may not be increased due to use of these treatments in a guided protocol strategy.  For  IV loop 
diuretics, commonly encountered risks include potential acute kidney injury (AKI) and over diuresis leading to 
hypovolemia.  Electrolyte abnormalities may also occur.  Per routine standard of care at each of the sites, electrolytes 
are routinely c hecked during the initial [ADDRESS_865188] is associated with greater risk for adverse outcomes than transient AKI.  
To add a margin of safety, only patients with an eGFR ≥45 will be enrolled.  Finally, we will assess eGFR prior to discharge 
(if measured as part of standard of care)  to better understand whether our proposed strategy -of-care is associated with 
worsening renal function.  For nitrates, the greatest risk is hypotension.  All patients will have IV access for fluids, if 
needed.  Of note, the ESC guidelines allow for the potential u se of IV nitrates in patients with a SBP > 110mmHg and only 
recommend avoiding them if the SBP is < [ADDRESS_865189] accordingly will be made. 
Anecdotally, patients feel significantly better and usually the improvement outweighs the discomfort.  Other i ssues such 
as skin necrosis from long -term  use of NIV does not apply to the short -term  use of NIV.  
An unknown risk is whether or not our treatment strategy is associated with myocardial injury.  Thus, we will measure 
hsTnT at both baseline and pre -discharg e to ascertain the incidence of myocardial injury.  
Such measurements of hsTnT as potential electrolytes, eGFR, and pre- specified NTproBNP and Hgb/Hct will require 
additional blood draws, however, these will be limited in volume.  No more than [ADDRESS_865190] of ineffective ED AHF 
management, and spared  the potential for any possible side effects.  
3 OBJECTIVES AND  PURPOSE  
Objectives:  
1: To determine whether a strategy of care –  early LUS guided, protocol- driven ED AHF therapy –  leads to more rapid 
resolution of congestion.  
2. To demonstrate feasibility of recruitment and compliance with study protocol to inform future study design and 
enrollment projections  
Purpose:  
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_646095] a larger, definitive trial.    
Our overarching hypothesis:  A protocol -driven ED AHF strategy -of-care, guided by [CONTACT_646149] (LUS), will lead to 
improved 30 and 90 -day outcomes. Importantly, this strategy -of-care will utilize only currently available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] –  non-
invasive vent ilation, vasodilators (sublingual, topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], and/or IV), and IV loop diuretics.  Successful completion of our 
specific aims will provide the necessary and sufficient information to determine whether a LUS guided ED strategy leads 
to more rapid and sustained  decongestion.  A subsequent multi -center, randomized, simple, strategy -of-care trial, will 
test whether LUS guided, protocol -driven ED AHF management reduces [ADDRESS_865191] -discharge days alive and out 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (DAOOH).  
We focus on a subset of AHF  patients.6,86 If successful, we may expand the patient population in future studies. 
However, the following critical issue needs to be addressed prior  to initiation of a large, simple, efficacy study: does ED 
AHF management, guided by [CONTACT_646146], lead to rapid and sustained decongestion above and beyond usual care?  Although this 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_646096], we will assess patients throughout hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], carefully following 
management to inform subsequent trial design. To minimize heterogeneity of treatment, we exclude patients in 
cardiogenic shock or hypertensive emergency.6,[ADDRESS_865192] to patients. It is not 
frequ ently used however , either for diagnosis, prognosis, or to guide clinical therapy. However, treating clinicians will be 
blinded to these results to minimize contamination of the usual care arm. If clinicians choose to perform their own LUS, 
those patients will not be excluded.  Patients who provide written informed consent and meet all inclusion and no 
exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 to our LUS -guided strategy -of-care vs. usual care.  While no further LUS guided 
intervention will occur for usual c are patients, similar to our LUS -guided arm, serial LUS assessments will occur 
throughout hospi[INVESTIGATOR_646097] -specified biomarkers and physical exam.  For patients randomized to the 
strategy -of-care arm, the LUS guided protocol will be initiated  and continued until there is a decrease in B -lines to ≤ [ADDRESS_865193]. Trained research personnel will 
acquire LUS images. All images will be stored and overread by [CONTACT_165562] t, expert ultrasonographer blinded to 
treatment arm.  
13 
 Safety of patients are paramount.  If a potential life threatening etiology is identified, the clinical team will be made 
aware immediately, irrespective of randomization arm.  These occurrences will be  recorded in the eCRF.  While this will 
be a rare event, we will a priori establish that an additional patient will be accrued into the study and an additional 
modified intent to treat population for analysis will be performed, excluding these patients whe re a life -threatening 
etiology was identified (i.e. pericardial tamponade).  
For patients who do NOT meet eligibility criteria, the results of their LUS will be provided to the clinical team as 
requested, as these patients are no longer at risk for contamin ation of the usual care arm.

 5.2 PARTICIPANT  EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
1) Chronic renal dysfunction, incl uding ESRD or eGFR < 45 ml//min/1.73m2.     
2) Shock of any kind. Any requirement for vasopressors or inotropes.  
3) SBP < 100 or  > 175mmHg  
4) Need for immediate intubation

11) Pregnant or recently pregnant within the last [ADDRESS_865197] a lead PI  [INVESTIGATOR_646099], along with a dedicated study team.  This study team, comprised of research 
assistants and coordinators, will perform both electronic screening (via tracking boards) and maintain a continuous 
physical presence in the ED to identify patient s. All sites currently screen patients at minimum 16 hours each day, 5 days 
per week.  Additionally, Detroit has a 24/[ADDRESS_865198] AHF.  
As we aim to design a pragmatic, ED -based study  our inclusion/exclusion criteria are relatively broad compared to other 
therapeutic clinical trials.   
Screen Failures:  
Patients who sign an informed consent but who are not randomized will be considered Screen Failures. Only data for 
randomized patients will be entered into the CRF.  Serious adverse events should be reported for these patients from 
the time the ICF is signed through the time that the patient is declar ed a screen failure.   One expected reason for screen 
failure will be the absence of > 15 B- lines at baseline.  
5.4 PARTICIPANT  WITHDRAWAL  OR TERMINATION  
 
5.4.1 REASONS FOR WITHDRAW AL OR TERMINATION  
In accordance with the guiding principles of the Declaratio n of Helsinki, any patient is free to withdraw from 
participating in this study at any time and for whatever reason, specified or unspecified, and without prejudice. 
Investigators should attempt to determine the cause of withdrawal and, if desired by [CONTACT_941] p atient, to make it possible for 
the patient to continue to participate in the study.  The extent of a patient's withdrawal from the study (i.e. withdrawal 
from further study treatment, withdrawal from any further contact, etc.) should be documented.  Every  effort should be 
taken to follow all randomized patients, to the extent that the patient will allow, for the full follow -up period.  
Investigators may discontinue study  treatment for any other reasons concerning the health or well -being of the patient . 
[ADDRESS_865199] result, evaluatio ns will continue until the event has resolved or stabilized or until a determination of a cause 
unrelated to the study procedure is made.  The specific event or laboratory finding(s) must be documented.  All 
evaluations should be performed, according to th e protocol.   
5.4.2 HANDLING OF PARTICIPANT  WITHDRAWALS OR TERMINATION  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will include all randomized patients. In accordance with the intent -to-treat principle, patients 
will be analyzed by [CONTACT_646150].  Misrandomized patients (patients randomized in error 
who did not receive any study intervention) will be excluded. Analyses in the FAS will constitute the main efficacy results 
for the primary and secondary study efficacy endpoints.  
The Per Protocol Set (PPS) will be a subset of the FAS and will exclude patients with major protocol violations.   The 
major protocol violations that will result in exclusion from the PPS will be identified prior to unblinding the treatment 
assignments for final analysis. Pati ents will be analyzed in the treatment group to which they were randomized. Results 
of analyses in this analysis population will support the primary efficacy analyses in the FAS.  
5.5 PREMATURE TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION OF S TUDY  
The study is overseen by a D SMB.  They may terminate the study at any time if the safety of patients is at jeopardy.  
6 STUDY AGENT  
 
6.1 STUDY AGENT (S) AND CONTROL DESCRIPTION  
This study will test a strategy -of-care vs. usual care for ED AHF management.  Only therapi[INVESTIGATOR_646100].  For example, NIV, IV loop diuretics, and nitrovasodilators.   The usual care arm will also follow the treatment 
protocol, unless the clinician explicitly states no further treatment is warranted based on their clinical assessment to 
better  reflect real- world conditions.   No drugs or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_646101].  
6.1.1  DOSING & DOSE ESCALATION  
The algorithm below outlines the treatment protocol.  
16 
  
• All enrolled patients should receive IV furosemide per the protocol box.  
o IF patients already received furosemide prior to the time of enrollment, BRANCH point.  
 Patients in usual care arm will NOT receive any further diuretic.  
 Patients in LUS arm will receive further diuretic to equal 2x single oral dose. For examp le, if the patient 
usually takes 80 BID at home, but then already received 40mg at arrival to the ED, if in the LUS arm, would 
receive an extra 120mg.  (200 is the maximum single time dose.)  
• Clinical assessments should be recorded irrespective of treatment  arm.  However, the initial ED LUS assessment will be 
considered Time 0.  

17 
  
*IMPORTANT – the clinical assessment alone arm will ALSO have LUS performed –  however, these results will NOT be shared with 
clinical caregiving team  
** ALL enrolled patients will be  re-assessed at least twice during their ED stay.  First re -assessment will occur within [ADDRESS_865200] OR prior to discharge.  IF the pre -discharge assessment is missed in 
the ER, this should occurs ASAP after arrival to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13334].  
NOTE: the maximum dose allowed at any one timeof IV Lasix is 200mgIV.   
NOTE: For additional IV loop diuretic doses, the options under Restart Algorithm are three options.  Clinical/Research team m ay 
choose one of the three loop diuretic dose options.  
NOTE: for both arms : After each reassessment, the clinical physician will b e asked:  
 1. “In your clinical opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], is the patient still volume overloaded?”   (Yes, No, Not sure)  
 2. If Yes, then the following question will be asked: “Do you think the patient warrants additional treatment now?”  
 3. If Yes, then FOR THE CLINICAL AS SESSMENT ARM ONLY: treatment will occur per the algorithm.   (Patients in the LUS 
intervention arm will ONLY receive further therapy guided by [CONTACT_646146])  
NOTE: The protocol is not optional.  Of course, patient safety comes first, similar to all other intervention al trials.  However, similar 
to other interventional studies, once randomized, the study protocol should continue forward.   If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], 
continuing treatment is potentially unsafe (i.e. SBP has decreased significantly, very brisk  diuresis) uptitration per protocol may be 
held.  
The protocol continues until [ADDRESS_865201] one round of treatment.   The protocol continues even 
if patients reach the floor. However, if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_646102], the protocol should not be continued once on the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13334], this is allowed and should be marked on the case report form.  
7 STUDY PROCEDURES AND  SCHEDULE  
 
7.1 STUDY PROCEDURES/EVA LUATIONS  
7.1.[ADDRESS_865202] of care procedures for either 
treatment arm. Patients will continue to be assessed however, during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
7.2 LABORATORY PROCEDURES/EVALUATIONS  
 
7.2.1  CLINICAL LABORA TORY EVALUATIONS  
Lab testing  will be analyzed by [CONTACT_646151]/hematocrit values. This reflects our pragmatic approach.  If routine labs are performed clinically within 6 
hours of the follow up time -point, these results will be used for study purposes (Table 2).  If rout ine lab work is not 
drawn, the closest clinical lab draw will be recorded in the eCRF unless already recorded (i.e. the baseline value).  NO 
labs, other than for NTproBNP and hsTnT will be drawn for study purposes. Samples will be stored and shipped to 
Indiana University  at the Clinical and Translational Sciences Laboratory.  At quarterly intervals, samples will be analyzed  
in our core lab, with expertise in clinical lab sampling.   
All clinical laboratory test results outside of the reference range will be interpreted in the context of the patient 
underlying disease state by [CONTACT_646152]:  
• abnormal but not a clinically -significant worsening  
• abnormal and a clinically -significant worsening  
A laboratory test result that has  significantly worsened (according to medical judgment) compared with the baseline 
result will be recorded on the CRF as an adverse event and monitored. An adverse event includes a laboratory or 
diagnostic test abnormality (once confirmed by [CONTACT_646153]) that results in the temporary or permanent 
cessa tion of treatment, or requires medical treatment or further diagnostic work -up. The AE and SAE reporting period 
extends to day [ADDRESS_865203] sample will be taken if the catheter was flushed 
with saline.  
2 aliquots per sample type per collection = 6 total aliquots  
Time Point  Tube Type  Blood Volume  
T0 = 0 hour (Baseline)  Serum Separator  One tube, ~ 4cc  
Lithium Heparin  One tube, ~ 4cc

EDTA Plasma  One tube, ~ 4cc  
Samples will be collected in the following order:   
1. Serum separator  
2. Lithium heparin  
3. EDTA plasma  
Every attempt to collect both samples should be made.  
Specimens must be processed within [ADDRESS_865204] b e in 
accordance with institutional standards, policies, guidelines, recommendations, and requirements.  
After collection, please use the following instructions for guidance.  If there is doubt, the tube manufacturer instructions 
are the final arbiter for an y disputes.  
Serum:  After collection, let sit at room temperature for ~30 minutes to allowing clotting to occur.  Then centrifuge at 
1000- 1300 g for 10 -15 minutes at room temperature.  
Lithium Heparin plasma:  After collection, invert tube gently 10 times to ensure mixing with anti -coagulant.  Then 
centrifuge at 1000 -1300 g for 10- 15 minutes at room temperature.  
EDTA: After collection, invert tube gently [ADDRESS_865205] temperature logs available for review.  
7.2.4  SPECIMEN SHIPME NT 
Frozen biomarker specimens will be batch shipped on a quarterly enrollment basis on Dry Ice. A specimen shippi[INVESTIGATOR_646103] a copy kept at the site. All samples should be stored at - 20C or lower until the sample 
is shipped.  Who le blood will be collected, processed (centrifuged locally) and stored appropriately for shipment to 
Indiana University (IU) for central processing.    
All personnel responsible for shippi[INVESTIGATOR_646104].  IU will provide the 
minimum required procedures.  Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_646105].   Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_646106] , if required, will include documentation, QC, manifest creation and dry ice (if required).  
Detailed ship pi[INVESTIGATOR_646107] . 
7.[ADDRESS_865206] of the protocol -specified evaluations.  Patients will acknowledge and agree to 
the use of this information for the study by [CONTACT_28499].  
At the Baseline Visit, patients will be assigned by [CONTACT_646154] -based Randomization System ( IWRS ) a unique 
permanent identification number (referred to as the patient identification number) such that all randomized patients 
from each center are given consecutive identification numbers by [CONTACT_646155].  We will 
utilize the REDCap randomization module.   (NOTE: thus each patient will have two ID’s –  1) generated by [CONTACT_646156] 2) 
blood specimen label)  
Prospective study patients will have presented to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_646108].  Potential patients will be 
identified either en route to or upon arriving at the ED/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Routine assessments associated with usual patient care 
may be used for the purposes of screening a nd may be completed in any order. Study specific procedures must be 
completed only after Informed Consent is obtained.  
Randomization will occur within three hours of patient’s  arrival to a room within the ED where they can be seen by a 
physician  or the fi rst time AHF treatment is given . Waiting room time does not count against these three hours.   
The following procedures will be performed prior to or during Screening:  
• Obtain written informed consent (must be performed as the first study -specific procedure)  
• Review of prior medical history  
• Review of prior and concomitant medications  
• Physical examination (including height and weight when reasonably possible)  
• Vital signs measurements (includes systolic and diastolic blood pressures, heart rate, body temperature , oxygen 
saturation reading and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697])  
• 12-Lead Electrocardiogram  
• Chest X -Ray (this is not a requirement however, for inclusion)  
• Blood collection for local laboratory tests, including BNP or NT -proBNP, and pregnancy test if applicable.  
• Inquiry a bout Adverse events  
7.3.2  ENROLLMENT/BASELINE 
Patients who continue to fulfill all of the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized no later than [ADDRESS_865207] recorded  time stamp  when patient placed in a room to be seen by a provider .  Waiting room time does not count.  
Randomization will occur via central IWRS system.  
7.3.3  FOLLOW -UP & FINAL STUDY VISIT  
Patients will be followed for a maximum of [ADDRESS_865208] -discharge ((+) 30 business days  or at the discretion of

8.1 SPECIFICATION OF SAFETY PARAMETERS  
Mortality, re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and ED visits through 90  days will be assessed for safety as well as efficacy  
Hypotension, defined as a  SBP < 100mmHg, will be assessed as a safety endpoint.  SBP Decrease Safety Margin: Patients 
whose SBP decreases to < 100mmHg at any time (measurement must be repeated twice, 15 minutes apart, unless 
symptomatic) or who dev elop evidence of clinical hypotension (i.e. weakness, dizziness, faint, chest discomfort) despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] 
a SBP > 100mmHg will be immediately assessed and treated as needed, and all further strategy of care interventions will 
be halted.   Patient safety and care is  paramount and takes precedence over all other considerations.  The clinical team 
may halt the study at any time.  If there are any questions, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_646111].   
8.1.1  DEFINITION OF A DVERSE EVENTS  (AE)  
The Investigator and study staff are responsible for detecting and recording AEs and SAEs during scheduled safety 
evaluations and whenever such information is brought to their attention. This section of the protocol provides 
definitions and detailed proced ures to be followed. During each visit, the Investigator will question the patient about 
adverse events using an open question, taking care not to influence the patient’s answers, e.g. “Have you had any 
unusual symptoms or medical problems since the last visit?  If yes, please describe.”  
An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an 
investigational (medicinal) product or other protocol- imposed intervention, regardless of attribution.  
This includ es the following:  
• AEs not previously observed in the subject that emerge during the protocol -specified AE reporting period.  
• Complications that occur as a result of protocol- mandated interventions (e.g., invasive procedures such as cardiac 
catheterizations).  
• If applicable, AEs that occur prior to assignment of study treatment associated with medication washout, no treatment 
run-in, or other protocol -mandated intervention.  
• Preexisting medical conditions (other than the condition being studied) jud ged by [CONTACT_646158]- specified AE reporting period.  
• Abnormal laboratory values that fall into an abnormal range based upon the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s laboratory standards, the 
abnormality was not preexisting prior to enrollment, and the abnormality leads to a new treatment within the AE time 
frame  
The AE and SAE reporting period extends to day [ADDRESS_865212], unless 
otherwise specified.  
8.1.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOU S ADVERSE EVENTS  (SAE)  
An AE will be classified as an SAE if:  
• It results in death (i.e., the AE actually causes or leads to death).  
• It is life threatening (i.e., the AE, in the view of the investigator, places the subject a t immediate risk of death. It does 
not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death).  
• It requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• It results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE  results in substantial disruption of the subject’s 
ability to conduct normal life functions).  
24 
 • It is considered a significant medical event by [CONTACT_13656] (e.g., may jeopardize the 
subject or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above).  
 
8.[ADDRESS_865213] be recorded as 1 of the choices on the following scale:  
Mild   No limitation of usual activities  
Moderate  Some limitation of usual activities  
Severe  Inability to carry out usual activities  
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with a SAE.  
8.2.2  RELATIONSHIP TO STUD Y AGENT  
Each reported AE will be described by [CONTACT_13662] (i.e., start and end dates), regulatory seriousness criteria if applicable , 
and suspected relationship to study drug in accordance with definitions set forth at each IRB. In general, these 
relationships are categorized as likely, possible, unlikely and not related. Experience teaches that gray zone instances 
will arise, and the site coordinators and PIs will be trained to adjudicate possible SAEs in a systematic fashion. To ensure 
consistency of SAE causality assessments, investigators will apply the following general guideline:  
Yes - There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the AE and administration of the study drug and 
the AE cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical st ate, inter -current illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or 
the AE follows a known pattern of response to study drug or the AE abates or resolves upon discontinuation of study 
drug;  
No - Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the study dr ug (e.g., preexisting medical condition, 
underlying disease, inter -current illness, or concomitant medication); and/or the AE has no plausible temporal 
relationship to the study drug.  
Adjudication of each AE will proceed as follows: First, the coordinator will consult the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_646112]. Next, 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_646113]. Third, 
if the PI [INVESTIGATOR_646114], he or she will have the option of sending a personal 
health identifier- stripped, written narrative of the event to the other site PIs who will vote up or down as to whether the 
event constituted an AE or SAE.  
8.2.3  EXPECTEDNESS  
The following signs, symptoms, observati ons and events are frequently observed in association with acute heart failure: 
dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, chest pain, fever, hypoxemia, rapid pulse, rapid respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], 
dizziness, syncope, altered mental status, confusion, anxie ty, generalized weakness, anorexia, nausea, abdominal pain, 
back pain, early satiety, vomiting, pneumonia, acute renal failure, skin infection, cancer, surgery not related to 
treatment of pulmonary embolism, electrocardiography abnormalities (atrial arrhyt hmias, ventricular dysrhythmias, 
right bundle branch block, and ST and T wave changes), elevated troponin level, elevated BNP or NT ProBNP level, high 
white blood cell count,  pulmonary infiltrate, pleural effusion, cardiomegaly, electrolyte imbalances, ne ed for oxygen 
therapy, need for vasopressor support, need for blood product transfusion, need for mechanical ventilation (invasive or 
non-invasive), need for physical or occupational therapy, need for analgesia, need for skilled nursing facility upon 
[ADDRESS_865214]’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_646115] -exempt AEs will be investigated by [CONTACT_646159].  
8.4.2  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN T REPORTING  
All SAE’s will be revie wed within 48 hours and all AE’s within 7 days of discovery by [CONTACT_39613] (also known as 
the medical monitor).  Any SAE discovery will be reported to the DCC who will then report to the DSMB, who will be 
unblinded.  If placebo treated patient, stand ard reporting to the IRB will occur.  If active treated patient, and deemed to 
be related to drug, the SAE will be reported to the DSMB chair within 7 business days by [CONTACT_6968], fax, or phone of any fatal 
or life -threatening adverse event that is unexpected.  
15 Calendar Day Written Report  
The Investigator will also be required to notify the IRBs and all participating investigators, in a written Safety Report, of 
any serious, unexpected AE that is considered reasonably or possibly related to the strategy -of-care arm  
72 hour reporting  
For the discovery of an unexpected serious adverse event thought to be related to study drug, the Investigator(s) will 
notify the Chair of the DSMB by [CONTACT_49907] [ADDRESS_865215] once per year for meeting with study staff and random surveillance.  
10 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS   
26 
 10.1 STATISTICAL AND A NALYTICAL PLANS  
Previous work demonstrates the value of B -lines to improve both diagnosis and prognosis in AHF.  Whether targeting B-
lines to guide therapy results in improved outcomes, is unknown.  Prior to examining outcomes however, a key step is 
required:  does LUS guided, protocol -driven treatment result in less B -lines than usual care?  In other words, can B -lines 
be actively targeted as a treatment endpoint?  
10.2 STATISTICAL HYPOT HESES  
• Hypothesis 1: LUS guided patients will have less congestion, defined by [CONTACT_646146] B -lines <15, than usual care patients 
at 6 hours after start of treatment.  Other measures of congestion, such as serial LUS during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
physical exam, NTproBNP, and hemoglobin/hematocrit levels will be assessed to determine the superiority or 
addi tive value of LUS.  
• Exploratory Hypothesis: Strategy -of-care patients will have more days alive and out of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  (DAOOH)  at [ADDRESS_865216] more days alive and out of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (DAOOH) at 9 0 days.  
 
• Hypothesis 2: Each site (n=4) will enroll ~2 patient per month for 18 months.  
10.3 ANALYSIS DATASETS  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will include all randomized patients. In accordance with the intent -to-treat principle, patients 
will be analyzed by [CONTACT_646160]. Misrandomized patients (patients randomized in error 
who did not receive any study intervention ) will be excluded. Analyses in the FAS will constitute the main efficacy results 
for the primary and secondary study efficacy endpoints.  
The Per Protocol  Set (PPS) will be a subset of the FAS and will exclude patients with major protocol violations.   The 
major protocol violations that will result in exclusion from the PPS will be identified prior to unblinding the treatment 
assignments for final analysis.  Patients will be analyzed in the treatment group to which they were randomized. Results 
of analyses in this analysis population will support the primary efficacy analyses in the FAS.  
10.[ADDRESS_865217] ATISTICAL METHODS  
10.4.1  GENERAL APPROAC H 
Unless stated otherwise, two -sided p values < 0.[ADDRESS_865218] to multiple 
comparisons. Statistical tables and listings and analyses will be produced using SAS  release 9.1 or later (SAS Institute, 
Inc, Cary, NC, US A) or other validated statistical software.  
10.4.[ADDRESS_865219] (if the normality assumption holds) or Wilcoxon rank -sum test (if the normality assumption does not hold). 
Normality of distribution will be determined using the Kolmogorov -Smirnov goo dness -of-fit test. Categorical data will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_646161] -square or Fishers exact test, as appropriate.  
The use of prior and concomitant medications will be summarized.  The use and doses of IV and oral loop diuretics in 
furosemide equivalents will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  Other concomitant medications will be coded using 
WHO Drug and summarized by [CONTACT_646162].

10.4.3  ANALY SIS OF THE PRIMARY E FFICACY ENDPOINT(S)  
The comparison of binary endpoints  (B-lines < 15)  will be performed using Chi- square or Fishers exact test, as 
appropriate.  
Potential covariates  will also be considered in a logistic regression setting to improve precision, which include s baseline 
co-morbidities, baseline medications (in particular guideline recommended therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_219305], baseline 
renal function, serum sodium, nat riuretic peptide levels, troponin levels, renal function, baseline blood pressure, and 
discharge medications. Variables such as physical exam, other vital signs, and hemoconcentration may also be included. 
For NT -proBNP, a percent change greater than 30% a nd its association with the primary endpoint will be analyzed.  This 
is based on previous work suggesting a 30% change was a key discriminatory threshold for mortality.88-[ADDRESS_865220] majority of AHF 
admissions. Covariates with univariately significant association with the outcome will be included together with the 
treatment indicator in a logistic regression model. Due to limited sample size, we will limit the number of covariates 
(including treatment indicator) such that there is 10 events per covariate.  
 
10.4.4  ANALYSIS OF THE EXPLORATORY  ENDPOINT(S)  
DAOOH: Will be compared using T test or Wilcoxon rank -sum test, as appropriate.  
If the distribution of [ADDRESS_865221] may not perform satisfactorily. An alternative approach 
to evaluat e the robustness of the analysis, is to treat DAOOH as an ordinal outcome and use the proportional odds (PO) 
regression model to compare the two arms. The PO model is a generalization of the Wilcoxon (Mann -Whitney) test to 
estimate the shift in the underly ing distribution of DAOOH by [CONTACT_25234]. The PO regression allows for adjustment 
of baseline covariates to enhance power.  
We will examine the distribution of B- lines measurements for the groups with and without events separately. Both 
absolute number  and relative change will be evaluated.  Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves will be plotted 
together with area under the curve (AUC) calculated to understand the prediction performance of the B -line 
measurements. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values will be computed at a number of 
thresholds of B -line measurements to understand the trade- off between false positive and false negative. Confidence 
intervals of statistical measures will be constructed using the bootstrap  method.[ADDRESS_865222] been 
previously identified as a valid threshold, an alternat ive number may be more useful in the ED setting.    
For reproducibility analysis, generalized linear mixed -effects models will be fitted to estimate the inter - and intra -
observer variability, where both patients and observers are treated as random effects.  
We will compare parameters used to identify congestion. This will include a comparison between B- lines measurements 
and other markers, such as physical exam, NTproBNP, eGFR, and hemoglobin/hematocrit. Bootstrap method will be 
used for the comparison to acc ount for correlations between the markers and the B -line measurements. We will 
consider two strategies to explore potential multivariate models:  
1. Logistic regression models:  We will consider three different models.  First, we include all markers together with 
B-line measurements in the model (Model 1). Second, we will explore all main effects models that can be built 
using the B -line measurements along with the other markers and select the one with the best  model fitting 
characteristic (e.g. Akaike Informat ion Criterion or Bayesian Information Criterion) (Model 2).  Third, we will 
explore all main effects models that can be built using only the other markers (Model 3). These models will allow 
us to create a discriminating score for the prediction of 30  or 90 -day outcomes.  
28 
 2. Tree based nonparametric method:  We will employ the classification tree92 to build a nonparametric prediction 
model using B -lines measurements and the seven other markers. (Model 4). We will build a similar classification 
tree without the involvement of the B -lines measurements (Model 5).  
Models 1 -5 will b e evaluated using data from the testing set in terms of prediction accuracy. In particular, Models 2 and 
3, 4 and 5 will be compared (if there is a difference between models 2 and 3, and between 4 and 5) to understand the 
net reclassification rate.93,[ADDRESS_865223] (if the normality assumption holds) or Wilcoxon rank -sum test (i f the normality 
assumption does not hold). Normality of distribution will be determined using the Kolmogorov -Smirnov goodness -of-fit 
test. Categorical data will be summarized by [CONTACT_646161]- square or Fishers 
exact test, as appropriate.  
As all cause mortality and re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_646116], these 
will also be highlighted as safety analyses.  
10.4.6  ADHERENCE AND RETENTION ANALY SES 
Missing data:  We will compare relevant patient characteristics between those who stay in the study and those who drop 
out to examine whether there are characteristics that discriminate between the two groups. It is possible that the 
dropout mechanism does not depend on unobserved ou tcomes (Missing At Random, or MAR),95 where no bias will be 
introduced by [CONTACT_646163]- data mechanism. We can simply use all observed outcomes for the analysis. Under 
circumstances where power loss is of c oncern, we will use a multiple imputation96 procedure to make use of all relevant 
observed variables to  enhance power. The SAS procedure MI and MIANALYZE will be used for implementation of this 
procedure.  
In case the dropouts are Missing Not At Random (MNAR), which means the likelihood of drop -out depends on an un -
observed outcome, potential bias can be int roduced if the miss -data mechanism is ignored. We will make various 
assumptions regarding the missing -data process. With these assumptions, we will fit proper models, either in the form 
of selection model 97, pattern mixture model 95, or latent variable model 98 to account for the missing- data process. A 
sensitivity analysis will be conducted to compare the results based on different assumptions and models and assess the 
robustness of the inference.  
10.4.7  PLANNED INTERIM  ANALYSES  
• Per the DSMB charter, there is a single, formal interim analysis planned after 50 % patients are accrued.  NO 
formal stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_646117], given the small sample size.  Rather, the DSMB will issue recommendations on 
halting the trial early, only for safety reasons, based on the totality of data revie wed.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_865224] that 25% of patients in the usual care arm will have < [ADDRESS_865225] 81% power to detect an effect size of 2 (i.e. 
25% in the usual care versus 50% in the strategy care), where the type I error rate is controlled at 0.05 (two -sided). 
Considering a conservative 10% drop -out rate, we will need a total of 130 subjects.  
10.6 MEASURES TO MINIM IZE BIAS  
10.6.1  ENROLLMEN T/ RANDOMIZATION/ MA SKING PROCEDURES  
29 
 Each site will be provided a block randomization table with variable block  sizes of  2,  4, and 6 . The data coordinating 
center will continuously monitor the recruitment until the targeted sample size is reached. We will  utilize the REDCap 
Randomization module for web -based randomization . 
Due the nature of the intervention and the clinical setting, this is an unblinded trial.  
11 SOURCE DOCUMENTS AN D ACCESS TO SOURCE D ATA/DOCUMENTS  
The medical experts, study monitors, audi tors, and health authority inspectors (or their agents) will be given direct 
access to source data and documentation (e.g., medical charts/records, laboratory test results, printouts, videotapes) for 
source data verification, provided that patient confiden tiality is maintained in accordance with local requirements.  
Each Investigator must maintain, at all times, the primary records (i.e., source documents) of each patient’s data.  
Examples of source documents are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], office visit records; examining physician’s finding or notes, 
consultant’s written opi[INVESTIGATOR_72447], laboratory reports, drug inventory, study drug label records, and CRFs that are 
used as the source.  
Each Investigator will maintain a confidential patient identification list that allows the unambiguous identification of 
each patient.  All study -related documents must be kept for a minimum of 5 years.  A publically available dataset will be 
released per NIH guidelines.  
12 QUALITY ASSURANCE AN D QUALITY CONTROL  
Protocol Amendments: No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be initiated without the prior written 
approval or favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1101] a written amendment by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB, except when necessary to eliminate immediate

Protocol Deviations, Violations, and Excepti ons:  A protocol deviation  is non -adherence to protocol -specific study 
procedures or schedules that does not involve inclusion/exclusion criteria, primary objective variable criteria, and/or 
GCP guidelines.  Deviations are considered minor and do not impac t the study.  
A protocol violation  is any significant divergence from the protocol, i.e., non -adherence on the part of the patient, the 
Investigator, or the sponsor to protocol -specific inclusion/exclusion criteria, primary objective variable criteria, and/ or 
GCP guidelines .  Protocol violations will be identified and recorded, by [CONTACT_223060].  
No exceptions  to pro tocol -specific entry criteria will be granted to  allow patients to enter a study.   
Information to Study Personnel: Each Investigator is  responsible for giving information about the study to all staff 
members involved in the study or in any element of patient management, both before starting the practical 
performance of the study and during the course of the study (e.g.,  when new staff bec ome involved).  Each Investigator 
must assure that all study staff members are qualified by [CONTACT_8640], experience, and training to perform their specific 
responsibilities.  These study staff members must be listed on the study center authorization form,  (if required)  which 
includes a clear description of each staff member’s responsibilities.  This list must be updated throughout the study, as 
necessary.  
The study monitor is responsible for explaining the protocol to all study staff, including each Investigator, and for 
ensuring their compliance with the protocol.  Additional information will be made available during the study when new 
staff become involved in the study and as otherwise agreed upon with either the Investigator or the study monitor.  
The handli ng of data, including data quality assurance, will comply with regulatory guidelines (e.g.,  ICH and GCP) and the 
sponsor’s or its designee’s SOPs and working instructions.  Data management and control processes specific to this study

database quality assurance including, but not limited to, review of data entered into the CRFs by [CONTACT_646164].  
Data management at Indiana University will implement edit checks on the eCRF to enforce data integrity and 
compliance to the protocol an d regulatory requirements.  Study center personnel will be responsible for entering study 
data on the eCRFs.  Data management will track eCRFs and review them for completeness, the presence of mandatory 
values, consistency, and dated electronic signatures.   Queries identified during data discrepancy review will be sent to 
the study center personnel to be reviewed and resolved in a timely manner.  
Adverse Events will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary.  Concomitant medications will be coded using the WHO 
Drug dictionary.  Adverse Events and Concomitant Medications will be reviewed for coding consistency and 
completeness.

A protocol violation  is any significant divergence from the protocol, i.e., non -adherence on the part of the patient, the 
Investigator, or the sponsor to protocol -specific inclusion/exclusion criteria, primary objective variable criteria, and/or 
GCP guidelines .  Protocol violations will b e identified and recorded, by [CONTACT_223060].  
No exceptions  to protocol -specific entry criteria will be granted to allow patients to enter a study.   
14.4 PUBLICATION AND DAT A SHARING POLICY  
RESOURCE SHARING PLAN  
This includes the following activities:  
 Publicizing the study as it is initiated, to trial investigators and other interested researchers  
 Identifying and supporting proposals, (funding sources, implementation, analyses) for feasible salient ancillary 
studies;  
 Providing a fully anonym ized data set for future analyses/studies by [CONTACT_646169], once the trial 
funding has ended.  
Each of these activities is discussed below.  
Publicizing the Study  
The key methods for publicizing the trial are:  
 ClinicalTrials.gov – the government website that registers all initiated trials with trial protocol descriptions and 
contact [CONTACT_3031];  
 The trial site PI's and involved leadership group  
 Design and rationale paper will be submitted for publication  
 A final manuscript will be submitted after conclusion of the study.  
Providing Access to Linked, Anonymized Data  
Once trial funding ends, two options will be:  
 Provide the anonymized data set to NHLBI.  
 Maintain the linked, anonymized data set via the IU Data Coordinating Center.  
Regardless of which  option is implemented, information on availability of data will be accessible on ClinicalTrials.gov 
and will be linked to other appropriate sites, including Indiana University websites.  
PREPARATION OF THE ANONYMIZED, LIMITED ACCESS DATASET  
33 
 To comply with NHLBI requirements for an adequately anonymized dataset, we propose the following activities for the 
data set:  
1. Subject identifiers : 
a. New random identification numbers without site identifiers will replace the original identification 
numbers, once data acqui sition is complete.  
b. The key linking the original and new ID numbers will NOT be provided to users of the anonymized data 
set, nor to site investigators and staff.  
2. Variables that might lead to the identification of participants : 
a. Interviewer or technician identification numbers or codes will be recoded or deleted.  
b. Regional variables with little or no variation within a center because they could be used to identify the 
center will be deleted.  
c. Unedited, verbatim responses that are stored as text data (e.g., s pecified in “other” category) will be 
deleted.  
3. Dates : All dates will be coded relative to a specific reference point (e.g., date of randomization). This provides 
privacy protection for individuals known to be in a study who are known to have had some signi ficant event 
(e.g., myocardial infarction) on a particular date. Birth and other milestone dates will also be recoded relative to 
a specific reference date.  
4. Variables with low frequencies for some values , that might be used to identify participants, may be  recoded. 
These might include:  
a. Socioeconomic and demographic data (e.g., marital status, occupation, income, education, language, 
number of years married).  
b. Household and family composition (e.g., number in household, number of siblings or children, ages of  
children or step -children, number of brothers and sisters, relationships, spouse in study).  
c. Numbers of pregnancies, births, or multiple children within a birth.  
d. Anthropometry measures (e.g., height, weight, waist girth, hip girth, body mass index).  
e. Physic al characteristics that are distinctive (e.g., blindness).  
f. Prior medical conditions with low frequency (e.g., group specific cancers into broader categories) and 
related questions such as age at diagnosis and current status.  
5. Race/ethnicity and gender infor mation  when very few subjects are in certain groups or cells.  
a. Polychotomous variables: values or groups will be collapsed so as to ensure a minimum number of 
subjects (e.g., at least 20) for each value within each race- gender cell.  
b. Continuous variables: distributions will be truncated if needed to ensure that a minimum number of 
subjects (e.g., at least 20) have the same highest and lowest values in each race- gender cell.  
c. Dichotomous variables: data should either be grouped with other related variables so as to ensure a 
minimum number of subjects (e.g., at least 20) in each race -gender cell or deleted.  
CLINICAL TRIALS.GOV  
This study will be registered at the appropriate and required time by [CONTACT_978], in conjunction with the DCC, to the 
government -operated clin ical trial registry data bank, which contains registration, results, and other information about 
registered clinical trials at ClinicalTrials.gov. Federal law under FDAAA requires clinical trial information for certain 
34 
 clinical trials to be submitted to th e data bank and this study will comply with all reporting requirements for clinical 
trials.

15.1  STUDY LEADERSHIP  
This study will be conducted at 3 sites in the [LOCATION_002], with 4 total hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].  Site 1) Indianapolis, IN at both the 
Eskenazi and Methodist hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] (abbreviated as IU, Peter S. Pang, PI), Site 2) Nashville, TN at the University of 
Vanderbilt hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (abbreviated as Vanderbilt, Sean P. Collins, PI), Site 3) Detroit, MI at the Detroit Receiving Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_74506] (abbreviated as DRC, Philip D. Levy.  Each site PI [INVESTIGATOR_1317] a member of the steering committee.  Dr. O’Connor at 
INOVA will serve as Chair of the Steering Committee.  
The following diagram illustrates the relationship between the DSMB and other entities in t his study.   
 
 
 
Communication with DSMB members will be primarily through the NHLBI Program Office and the Data Coordinating 
Center (DCC) housed at IU.  The primary coordinator of data transfer between the research team and the DSMB will be 
the DCC workin g with the DSMB statistician, who will also be at IU (TBD).   It is expected that study investigators will not 
communicate with DSMB members about the study directly, except when making presentations or responding to 
questions at DSMB meetings or during co nference calls.   The Steering Committee will be comprised of the Site PI [INVESTIGATOR_646119].

17  ADDITIONAL TRAINING MATERIALS   
17.1 LUNG ULTRASOUND  TRAINING OVERVIEW  
 
 
 
Lung Ultrasound Training Overview  
 
Each clinical site already has expertise in LUS (lung ultrasound).   Howe ver, to minimize variation, a 
standardized teaching format will be utilized, emphasizing the [ADDRESS_865234] document or PDF. Videos will be utilized for training purposes, however, 
a doc ument representation is listed below.  
Why use lung ultrasound?  For all of the following reasons:  
a. It is fast  
b. No radiation  
c. Non invasive  
d. Repeatable 
 
Ultrasound has been used at the bedside for years. Machines continue to get smaller and smaller and easier to  
move around.  
What is the difference between focused ultrasound and formal echocardiography or radiology studies?  
Focused ultrasound does not replace formal echocardiography or formal radiology studies. It is meant to 
answer a binary clinical question.  For the purpose of our study, it is meant to guide AHF management.  [The 
figure below with red arrows shows examples of B -lines]  
 
36 
  
 
Lung (or pulmonary ultrasound) is one of the easiest 
ultrasound assessments to learn and perform. Even in 
patients with a high BMI, the lung can be evaluated. 
Additionally, lung ultrasound has high inter -rater 
agreement.  
 
In this figure to the left, we are seeing B lines –  vertical 
echogenic artifacts originating from the pleural line, 
extending to the bottom of the ultrasound screen and 
moving with lung sliding. In AHF patients, B -line 
assessment aids in diagnosis, prognosis and may guide 
acute management.  
 
 
 
Below is the curvilinear probe used for the images .  
 
 
 
 
 

37 
 Below is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_646120] 8- zone scoring system.  
 
 
The eight zone protocol breaks each hemi -thorax into 4 zones, divided by [CONTACT_646170] (PS) Line, Ant 
axillary line  (AAL) , posterior axillary line (PAL) and anatomic nipple line (ANL). In the clinical setting of 
suspected AHF, pulmonary edema is determined sonographically as greater than three B -lines in a rib space in 
at least two lung zones bilaterally.  For scoring purpos es, a B line cut off of 10 has been described previously 
in the literature. This allows for a more precise quantification of pulmonary edema. B lines will be counted as 
the number seen per acoustic window.    
Machine settings  
• Enter patient data  
• Select curv ilinear  probe  
• Select thorax exam  
• Set depth  to 18 cm  
• Set clip length to 6 seconds  
• Turn off tissue harmonics and multi -beam former  
• Adjust gain so that the rib shadow is black and pleural line is distinct  
 

38 
  
Image acquisition  
• Patient supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]  
• 45 degrees of bed elevation (as possible, if not possible please note on CRF)  
  
 
• Starting off on the Right in Zone 1: you want the indicator towards the patient’s head. Identify ribs by 
[CONTACT_646171] a rib space (see image below)  
• Label R1 
• Then turn 90 degrees with indicator towards patient’s right  so you are still in a rib space but the probe 
is HORIZONTAL  
• Scan within the zone until you see the area of most B lines  
• Record 6 second clip (this should include both inspi[INVESTIGATOR_32715])  
• Repeat the above for R ight zones 2- 4 and Left zones 1- 4 
• Obtain VERTICAL R4 and L4 zones  
• 10 TOTAL videos  
• After you leave the bedside, record the number of B lines on a standardized data collection form or in 
REDCap  
 
 
 
 

39 
 COUNTING B LINES  
 
 
 
• B lines are vertical echogenic artifacts that originate from the pleural line and extend to the bottom of 
the ultrasound screen  
• Below image is an example of how to count individual B lines  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

40 
 • In the situation where the whole footprint is ‘white out’ (see below image) count as 20 B lines  
• The maximum number of B lines per sector is 20  
• Count the maximum number of B lines you see  
• If half of the footprint is a ‘white out’ count as 10 B lines  
• Estimate percentage of white out  
• Count up and down from there  
 
 
 
 
PLEURAL EFFUSION  
• Document pleural effusion as yes or no  
• Note the size (small, medium or large)  
• If pleural effusion and no lung is seen in the zone = 0 B lines  
• If pleural effusion and lung is seen = count number of B lines seen in lung 
 
 
 
For lung ultrasound we rely on the imaging of artifacts to interpret our scans.  The main artifact in the lung we 
see is called reverberation artifact.  The physics behind this artifact is briefly explained below.  
The ultrasound probe is constantly sendin g ultrasound waves towards whatever tissue is being imaged. When 
these sound waves get caught between [ADDRESS_865235] < 3 B lines per rib space  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
44 
 B lines may be seen outside of AHF.  Clinical context is crucial!  The table below shows other reasons why B 
lines may be present.  
FOCAL  DIFFUSE  
Infarct  Pulmonary Edema  
Contusion ARDS  
Cancer  Pulmonary Fibrosis  
Pneumonia/Pneumonitis  
 
45 
 Beware if you do NOT see A lines!  Below are coalesced B lines.  So many B -lines blend together, it could look  
like normal lung but you note no A lines.  (This appears better in video).  This is, in fact, diffuse B lines.
 
 
17.[ADDRESS_865236] supervision of 
Indiana University data stewards, we continue to utilize BOX HEALTH. Such accounts can only be set up via application to 
the IU data stewards for storage of critical health data.  Access to these secure storage sites are then shared w ith vetted 
users.  Two dedicated BOX HEALTH accounts will be set up for BLUSHED AHF.  
All sites currently use Q Path, a vendor based Ultrasound storage system. All sites plus the Core Lab use Q Path in their 
day to day storage and review of US images.  Imag es are securely transferred via wireless transmission from US 
machines to Q Path with PHI.   All images are stored securely under HIPAA grade security systems.  From Q Path, images 
are then exported to individual computers.  During this transfer, PHI is NO T transferred.   The only identifying cues left 
are date/time stamp, which may also be removed.  Additional, non -identifiable labels will be added for study purposes.  
These will then be uploaded into BOX HEALTH.   

46 
 Two BOX HEALTH folders will be created, o ne for the investigators and the other for the Core Lab.  Prior to uploading to 
the Core Lab, the images will be de- identified to site by [CONTACT_253977].  Furthermore, the images will be 
scrambled to avoid interpretation by [CONTACT_646172]. This fu rther minimizes bias by [CONTACT_646173].  The de -identified images (both by [CONTACT_646174]) will then be uploaded to the Core Lab BOX HEALTH

17.3 CORE LAB PROCED URE AND LUNG ULTRASO UND PROTOCOL  
Introduction 
The B-lines Lung Ultrasound Guided ED Management of Acute Heart Failure (BLUSHED -AHF) – is designed to assess the 
short -term effectiveness of early LUS guided,  protocolized, ED AHF management compared to usual care.  ED patients 
with AHF, who meet all other eligibility criteria, will be randomized within 3 hours of presentation.  To achieve this goal, 
a randomized, controlled, multi -site, strategy -of-care, pi[INVESTIGATOR_646121].  
The correlation between B -lines on lung ultrasound and AHF has been well -established. B -lines are an assessment of 
extra vascular lung water (EVLW).  Past studies demonstrate correlation of B- line artifacts with the following: (1) 
natiu retic peptide levels, (2) invasive hemodynamics, (3) chest xray, (4) clinical assessments, and (5) computed 
tomography.1-5  Moreover, B -lines may resolve after treatment.6 Lung ultrasound has an additional advantage: it 
measures patient’s clinical status in re al time. Finally, lung ultrasound is easily reproducible and does not carry any 
radiation exposure risk; thus, it can be repeated at regular intervals without increased risk to the patient.  
Lung Ultrasound (LUS) Protocol   
To best determine the potential va lue of EVLW measurements using LUS, we will assess patients at multiple timepoints 
throughout hopsitalization.  (See Figure 1 –  Trial design flow below)

well- studied.  
Each LUS scan consists of 8 sectors as seen in figure 2. (Figure reproduced from 
Volpi[INVESTIGATOR_646122].al. 7) Trained research personnel will record and count B- lines in 
each sector as visualized through on e respi[INVESTIGATOR_646123].  At minimum, each stored video clip will be [ADDRESS_865238] B -lines, patients will be placed at 
approximately 45 degrees for all scanning.  The CRF will be marked if 
patients are unable to lie at this angle.  
 
• An 8 zone LUS scan will be done at the following times:  
o T00:  initial LUS scan (in ED  for screening and eligibility ) 
o T02: 2- 4 hours after initial treatment  (in ED) (+/ - 30 minutes)  
o T06: 2-[ADDRESS_865239]  (+/- 60 minutes)  
o HD2 : 24 hours after initial scan (Day 2) (+/ - 6 hours)  
o HD3 : 48 hours after initial scan (Day 3) (+/ - 8 hours)  
o HD4: Day 4 (anytime during day)  
o HD5: Day 5 (anytime during day)  
o HD6: Day 6 (anytime during day)  
o HD7: Day 7 (anytime during day)

Materials  
Each site will have an ultrasound machine capable of performing video image recording as well as a low frequency 
curivilinear or abdominal (2 -5MHz) probe. B -lines are US  artifacts and machine software may attempt to ‘clean up’ 
images, thereby [CONTACT_646178] B- lines  Therefore, machine settings at each site will be optimized for B -
line visulization.  To ensure consistency, the same machine with the same setti ngs will be used for serial exams.  
To the extent possible, it is preferable that sites use the same machine to facilitate standardization.  For example, if the 
emergency department has a Sonosite Micromaxx or later model, we can standardize the protocol so that the depth is 
set at [ADDRESS_865241] scanning protocol will be established for each specific machine, with the followin g 
requirements:  
1) A low frequency curvilinear probe will be used for all image acquisition (2 -5MHz)  
2) The depth will be set to 18cm  
3) The gain settings will be standardized for all scans at each specific site.  If equipment is the same, the gain will be  
standardized.  
Training  
All physicians and research staff will undergo in -person training sessions led by [CONTACT_646179] [INVESTIGATOR_646124] a standard 
protocol . Both didactics and proctored bedside scans will occur.  This will ensure technique and equipment settings are 
standardized.  Published literature provides strong evidence that LUS can be learned with minimal training: as little as 30 
minutes yields excell ent correlation with expert sonographers.40,48 In addition, established protocols will be utilized for 
transfer and storage of images.  
49 
 To ensure ongoing quality assurance, feedback will be provided to each site for every 10 patients, or more frequently as 
needed if initial review su ggests inconsistency.  An independent, blinded, expert ultrasonographer will review the 
images.  Concordance with clinical site interpretations will be provided.  Additional training will be provided by [CONTACT_646180]. Inter -
rater agreement  on B -line counts 
will be reported at the end of the 
study.   
The CORE lab is led by [CONTACT_646181]: she is an internationally 
recognized expert in LUS.  She has 
a proven record of training, both 
for research and clinical purposes. 
She has substantial expe rience in 
the collation, interpretation, and 
reporting of LUS images.  
Counting of B -lines: (Figures 
courtesy of Luna Gargani MD)  
B lines will be counted as the 
number seen per acoustic 
windown.   See Figure 3.  
In the situation where there is 
‘white out’ or  diffuse B lines in a rib 
space, this will be counted as [ADDRESS_865242] enrollment.  All images will also be date/time stamped, which will be recorded in the local site  CRF.  Investigators or 
study staff will fill out a table of their count of B- lines, which will be compared to the Core Lab review.  If a rib space is 
completely whited out with B -lines, this will count as [ADDRESS_865243] -processing will occur.  However, prior to upload to the Core Lab, images will 
be deliberately mixed with oth er study patients. This is being done to avoid readers from having ‘before and after’ 
images.  Images will be then uploaded in batches of [ADDRESS_865244] access to this data until database lock.  Applicable back  up and 
secondary stor age will occur on a daily basis

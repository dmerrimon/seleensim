As	more	and	more	procedures	are	planned	on	an	outpatient	basis,	the	pain	associated	with	hip	arthroscopy	can	result	in	unplanned	admission	of	a	patient	who	expected	to	be	discharged	home	after	their	procedure.	Currently,	opi[INVESTIGATOR_392820].	 Various	 adjuncts	 have	 been	 tried	 in	 the	 past	 including	 multimodal	analgesia,	hip	joint	injections,	and	peripheral	nerve	blocks	typi[INVESTIGATOR_392821].	Studies	of	blocks	of	the	lumbar	plexus	using	the	posterior	approach	have	shown	good	results	 with	 reduction	 in	 patients’	 pain	 scores	 and	 opi[INVESTIGATOR_392822].	However,	 because	 of	 the	invasiveness	 and	 possible	 complications	 of	 the	 posterior	 approach	 to	 the	 lumbar	 plexus,	 the	 anterior	approach	called	the	fascia	iliaca	(FI)	block	is	an	attractive	alternative.	Furthermore,	earlier	studies	of	the	FI	block	were	performed	without	benefit	of	visual	guidance	for	needle	insertion.		With	the	advent	of	ultrasound	guidance,	the	FI	block	may	be	placed	with	a	greater	degree	of	success	than	in	previous	years	when	 ultrasound	 guidance	 was	 not	 utilized	 during	 the	 placement	 of	 FI	 block.	 The	 aim	 of	 the	 present	study	is	to	determine	if	ultrasound	guided	FI	blocks	can	reduce	the	pain	scores	and	opi[INVESTIGATOR_392823]-only	regimen	using	a	randomized	controlled	trial	comparing	these	outcomes	in	patients	getting	preoperatively	placed	FI	blocks	versus	patients	not	receiving	a	block.	A	significant	improvement	in	pain	control	and	opi[INVESTIGATOR_392824]	a	basis	for	increased	utilization	of	FI	blocks	for	this	procedure	with	the	attendant	benefits.	Other	 outcomes	 assessed	 include	 unplanned	 admission,	 PONV	 and	 PDNV	 from	 decreased	 narcotic	usage,	and	decreased	time	in	the	PACU.		• Primary	 objectives:	Quantify	the	 difference	 in	 pain	 score	 and	 opi[INVESTIGATOR_392825]	 a	 pre-operative	 FI	 block	 versus	 those	receiving	no	 block	(local	 anesthetic	joint	injection	only).	• Secondary	objectives:	Assess	differences	in	epi[INVESTIGATOR_392819],	time	in	PACU,	and	proportion	of	unplanned	admissions	compared	to	patients	with	joint	injection	only	• Hypothesis:	 Pre-operative	 placement	 of	 an	 ultrasound-guided	 fascia	 iliaca	 block	 in	 patients	undergoing	hip	arthroscopy	will	result	in	reduced	pain	scores	and	opi[INVESTIGATOR_392826]-only	regimen.	• Secondary	hypothesis:	Pre-operative	placement	of	an	ultrasound-guided	fascia	iliaca	block	in	patients	undergoing	hip	arthroscopy	will	result	in	fewer	epi[INVESTIGATOR_392819],	reduced	time	in	 PACU,	 and	lower	 rates	 of	 unplanned	 admissions	 compared	 to	 patients	 receiving	 an	opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-only	regimen.

Using	a	fixed	effects,	special,	main	and	interactions,	analysis	of	variance	testing	(ANOVA)	with	 a	 power	 of	 0.80	 and	 an	 alpha	 of	 0.05,	 we	 estimate	 the	 need	 for	 86	 subjects	 to	achieve	statistical	significance.	To	account	for	loss	of	follow	up,	we	will	target	10%	more	subjects,	thus	95	total	participants.	 	 		• Study	population	• Subjects	 		• Recruitment:	 Consecutive	 patients	 undergoing	 hip	 arthroscopy	 will	 be	 enrolled	 in	 the	study		• Inclusion	criteria:	• Scheduled	for	outpatient	hip	arthroscopy	by	[INVESTIGATOR_124].

Version	1/29/2015	5	• Study	procedure		At	the	pre-operative	clinic	appointment,	patients	will	be	recruited	into	the	study.		Informed	consent	will	be	obtained	from	the	patient	by	[CONTACT_392839].	 	 The	nature	of	the	experiment	will	be	explained,	specifically	 that	 the	patient	 agrees	 to	 be	 randomized	 to	 receive	 a	 block	prior	 to	 the	 operation	or	 to	receive	the	joint	injection	at	the	conclusion	of	the	surgery	as	an	adjunct	to	general	anesthesia.	 	 If	the	patient	agrees	to	enter	into	the	study,	the	patient	will	be	randomized	by	[CONTACT_392840]	a	computer	generated	randomization	program	at	the	time	of	enrollment	in	the	clinic.		Currently,	the	standard	of	care	at	the	Steadman	Hawkins	Clinic	of	the	Carolinas	is	to	offer	surgical	patients	a	block	as	an	analgesic	option.	 	 FI	blocks	are	not	ordered	by	[CONTACT_392841]	a	request	by	[CONTACT_392842].		If	patients	do	not	receive	a	FI	block,	they	will	receive	a	local	anesthetic	intraoperatively	by	[CONTACT_392843],	which	is	also	currently	the	standard	of	care	for	hip	surgery.			On	the	day	of	surgery,	all	patients	will	receive	multimodal	analgesia	with	an	oral	preoperative	cocktail	consisting	of	acetaminophen	15mg/kg	up	to	a	maximum	of	1000mg,	celebrex	400mg,	lyrica	75mg,	and	oxycontin	10mg	unless	they	are	allergic	to	any	of	the	components.	Both	block	(B)	and	non-block	(NB)	patients	 will	 receive	 pre-operative	 midazolam	 1-5	 mg	 as	 needed	 for	 procedural	 sedation	 (B)	 or	pre-operative	anxiety	(NB)	respectively.		Patients	to	be	blocked	will	receive	not	less	than	50	ml	and	up	to	60	mL	of	0.35%	ropi[INVESTIGATOR_392829]	a	dose	of	3	mg/kg	(with	adjuvants	of	100	mcg	clonidine	[per	60	mL]	and	epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]	1:400,000)	placed	using	a	17	gauge	3.2”	B-Braun	Tuohy	needle	under	ultrasound	guidance	using	a	SonoSite	S-Nerve	machine	with	a	15-[ADDRESS_493040]	approach.	(A	70kg	patient	would	receive	all	60	mL	of	the	block	solution	and	210mg	of	ropi[INVESTIGATOR_392830]).		The	blocks	will	be	placed	exclusively	by	a	selected	group	of	anesthesiologists,	who	have	been	trained	in	the	technique.		Patients	who	are	randomized	to	no-block	will	receive	a	single	injection	of	Noropin	in	the	joint	space.		General	anesthesia	will	be	conducted	in	a	standard	fashion	for	all	patients.	General	anesthesia	with	an	endotracheal	 tube	 will	 be	 induced	 with	 IV	 fentanyl	 2	 mcg/kg,	 lidocaine	 50mg,	 propofol	 2	 mg/kg,	 and	rocuronium	0.6	mg/kg	unless	another	plan	is	chosen	at	the	discretion	of	the	attending	anesthesiologist.	Maintenance	 of	 anesthesia	 will	 be	 done	 with	 O2:air	 FIO2	 50%,	 isoflurane	 end-tidal	 concentration	 of	0.7-1.4%,	 and	 tidal	 volumes	 of	 7-10	 mL/kg	 with	 a	 respi[INVESTIGATOR_392831]-tidal	 carbon	dioxide	 concentration	 of	 30-40	 mmHg.	 Fentanyl	 will	 be	 given	 in	 25-50	 mcg	 increments	 for	 HR	 or	 BP	greater	 than	 20%	 over	baseline.	 No	 long	 acting	 intra-operative	 opi[INVESTIGATOR_392832].	Ephedrine	in	5-[ADDRESS_493041]'s	 discretion.	 A	 minimum	 of	 20mL/kg	 of	 IV	crystalloid	 will	 be	 administered	 during	 the	 surgery.	 Ondansetron	 [ADDRESS_493042]	dose,	followed	by	[CONTACT_392844]	6.25	mg	IV	15	minutes	later	PRN.	Pain	scores	will	be	recorded	initially	upon	arrival	to	the	PACU	and	thereafter	until	the	patient	is	discharged	from	the	PACU.	 All	 epi[INVESTIGATOR_392833].	 Total	 recovery	 time	 in	 the	 PACU	 will	 be	recorded.	If	a	patient	is	otherwise	ready	for	discharge	but	remains	in	the	PACU	due	to	a	non-medical	issue	 (i.e.	 bed	 hold),	 the	 time	 at	 which	 the	 patient	 could	 have	 otherwise	 been	 discharged	 will	 be	
Version	1/29/2015	6	recorded	as	the	PACU	end	time	for	the	purposes	of	the	study.	Any	unplanned	admissions	will	be	noted.	All	opi[INVESTIGATOR_392834].		Patients	 will	 be	 followed	 in	 the	study	 surgeon’s	clinic	 office	 per	 his	 standard	 protocol	 at	 [ADDRESS_493043]-operatively.	 	 Pain	scores	will	be	evaluated	at	this	time.	 	 Clinical	outcome	measures	and	range	of	motion	of	the	patients’	hips	will	be	collected	at	this	time	as	well.	 	 Any	adverse	reaction	from	the	block	will	be	noted	and	recorded	at	all	times	from	the	administration	of	the	block	and	at	 each	 clinic	 follow	 up.	 	 Any	 signs	 or	 symptoms	 of	 numbness	 in	 the	 distribution	 of	 the	 fascia	 iliaca	block	will	be	noted.	 			• Primary	endpoint:	Quantify	the	difference	in	pain	in	patients	who	have	received	a	pre-operative	FI	block	versus	those	receiving	no	block.	• Secondary	 endpoint:	 Quantify	 the	 difference	 in	 opi[INVESTIGATOR_392835]	a	pre-operative	FI	block	versus	those	receiving	no	block.	• Tertiary	 endpoints:	 Assess	 differences	 in	 epi[INVESTIGATOR_392836],	 time	 in	 PACU,	 and	 proportion	 of	unplanned	admissions			• Risks	/	benefit	• Risks	associated	with	FI	blocks	are	the	following:	Overall	the	procedure	has	a	very	low	risk	profile.	The	location	of	the	injection	means	the	risk	of intravascular	 injection,	 local	 anaesthetic	 toxicity,	 and	 mechanical	 nerve	 damage	 is	 extremely	low. Good	 aseptic	 technique	 will	 minimize	 the	 risk	 of	 infection.	 The	 injection	 of	 a	 large	 volume	 of	local anaesthetic	ensures	 good	 spread	 and	 reduces	 the	 risk	 of	 failure.	 The	 risk	 of	 local	anaesthetic	 toxicity	 is highest	 within	 the	 first	 15	 minutes	 after	 injection,	 which	 makes	 close	monitoring	mandatory. 	• The	 potential	 benefit	 is	improvement	 in	 pain	 control	 and	 opi[INVESTIGATOR_392837].	 	The	knowledge	gained	from	this	study	will	also	be	used	in	future	patients	with	this	condition.	
Version	1/29/2015	7	• Statistical	Analysis		The	study	incorporates	four	dedicated	follow	up	points	beyond	baseline:	a)	perioperative	(1	to	5	days),	b)	2	weeks,	c)	6	weeks,	and	d)	3	months.	The	primary	outcome	measure	(pain)	will	be	analyzed	using	a	fixed	effects,	special,	main	and	interactions,	analysis	of	variance	testing	(ANOVA).	Opi[INVESTIGATOR_392838]	 a	 Pearson	 chi	 square	 or	 parametric	 equivalent	 (depending	 on	 final	 coding).	Tertiary	end	points	will	be	captured	using	an	ANOVA	for	continuous	measures	(once	tests	of	normality	are	completed),	 or	 Kruskal	 Wallis,	 whereas	 re-admission	 rates	 will	 be	 analyzed	 using	 a	 Pearson	Chi-square.	A	p	value	of	0.[ADDRESS_493044]	will	be	integrated	for	all	analyses.	 	 				References	Abdelmawgoud	A,	Rashwan	S.	(2012).

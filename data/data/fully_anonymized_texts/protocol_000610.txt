STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 A Simon’s 2-stage design will  be applied. The null hypothesis t hat the 
true response rate is 2% will be tested against a one-sided alt ernative. In 
the first stage, 18 subjects will be accrued. If there are 0 re sponses in these 
18 subjects, enrollment will be stopped. Otherwise, 10 addition al subjects 
will be accrued for a total of  28. The null hypothesis will be rejected if 3 
or more responses (complete/p artial) are observed in [ADDRESS_670009] s and 
further investigation will be w arranted. This design yields a t ype I error 
rate of 0.02 and power of 80% when the  true response rate is 15 % or

Version Date: 28MAR2019 Confidential Page [ADDRESS_670022] r api[INVESTIGATOR_516947]-1/PD-L1 blocka de in advanced urothelial cancer  leading to integration into 
standard treatment, CTLA-4 blocka de has been understudied in th is disease. Blocking the 
interaction between CTLA-4 e xpressed on T lymphocytes, and B7 f amily molecules expressed 
on antigen-presenting cells, has  been shown to augment T cell a ctivation, prolif eration, and anti-
tumor immunity. In a syngeneic m urine bladder cancer model, CTL A-4 blockade induced tumor 
regression, improved survival, and increased levels of tumor-re active T cells.9   
 A “window of opportunity” study ex plored the pharmacodynamic ef fects of the CTLA-[ADDRESS_670023] study to explore single-agent CTLA-4 blockade in patients with 
metastatic urothelial cancer wer e reported at the Society for I mmunotherapy of Cancer 2017 
meeting. Sharma et al reported the results of a phase 2 multice nter study exploring 
tremelimumab monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors , including patients with 
advanced urothelial cancer ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).
[ADDRESS_670024] ive response rate was 18.8 % (95% CI 7.2-36.4) with 2 
complete responses and 4 partial responses; the median duration  of response was not estimable 
and all patients with confirmed C R or PR had disease control at  12 months.  
 
1.2.3 CLTA-4 blockade may be non-cross resistant with single ag ent PD-1/PD-L1 
blockade in advanced urothelial cancer Given non-overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_516948], and potential syner gy, emerging data suggest that 
single agent CTLA-4 blockade ma y be active in patients with dis ease progression d espi[INVESTIGATOR_516949]-agent PD-1/PD-L1 blockade . Such findings are critical as  only 15-25% of patients with 
metastatic urothelia l cancer respond to singl e-agent PD-1/PD-L1  blockade and the development 
of additional regimens with the  potential to induce durable res ponses in this disease is urgently 
needed.   Preliminary results of a phase 2 study of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_516950] n ivolumab, in patients with 
metastatic urothelia l cancer progressing desp ite single-agent n ivolumab, were presented at the 
2017 ASCO Genitourinary Cancer Symposium.
13 Ten patients who were refractory to nivolumab 
monotherapy were treated with t he combination of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (1 mg/kg) and nivolumab (3 
mg/kg). Among these [ADDRESS_670025] t he potential role

 1.4 Rationale 
A prospective trial to assess the activity of tremelimumab in p atients with metastatic urothelial 
cancer progressive despi[INVESTIGATOR_516952] -1/PD-L1 blockade is support ed by [CONTACT_516972]: 
 
1. Immune checkpoint blockade has changed the landscape of treatme nt for metastatic 
urothelial cancer, a d isease without prior t reatment advances i n decades. 
2. Single-agent PD-1/PD-L1 blocka de results in durable responses i n ~15-20% of patients with 
metastatic urothelial cancer.  
3. Single-agent tremelimumab has shown similar response proportion s to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade 
in metastatic urothelial ca ncer in a small phase 2 study. 
4. The mechanism of action of CTL A-4 blockade and PD-1/PD-L1 block ade are non-
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_516953].  
5. Treatment of patients with metasta tic urothelial cancer progres sing despi[INVESTIGATOR_516952]-1/PD-L1 
blockade is a major unmet need.  
1.5 Rationale for dose/schedule 
An extensive program of non-clinic al and clinical studies has b een conducted for tremelimumab 
both as monotherapy and combina tion therapy with conventional a nticancer agents to support 
various cancer indications usi ng different dose schedules. A to tal of [ADDRESS_670027] been 
completed and 3 are ongoing. As of t he data cutoff date of 24 J anuary 2016, 962 patients 
received tremelimumab in com pleted monotherapy studies and 380 patients in the Phase IIb 
Clinical Study Protocol 
HCRN GU17-294 
Version Date: 28MAR2019 C onfidential Page 11 of 69 monotherapy study (D4880C00003;  DETERMINE). Study D4881C00024 i s an ongoing rollover 
study, which provides continued a ccess to treatment to [ADDRESS_670028] ongoi ng monotherapy study (D4884C00001), [ADDRESS_670029] r eceived tremelimumab in 
combination with other anticancer  agents in these studies. 
 In patients, tremelimumab exhi bits linear (dose-proportional) P K following IV infusion. The 
estimate of clearance (CL), volum e of distribution at steady st ate (Vss), and terminal-phase half-
life is 0.132 mL/h/kg, 81.2 mL/kg and 22.[ADDRESS_670030] what is perceived to be 
progression of their disease i n advance of deve lopi[INVESTIGATOR_516954] s tabilization or a tumor response.  
 The target trough concentration of t remelimumab is estimated to  be approximately 30 μg/mL, 
based on enhanced interleukin (IL )-2 release (in vitro) and ant itumor activity (in vivo) in 
preclinical studies. PK simulati ons indicate that, following a dose of 10 mg/kg q4w for 6 months, 
approximately 90% of patients are expected to be above this tar get level of 30 μg/mL during the 
induction phase. Tremelimuma b at a dose of 10 mg/kg q4w for 6 m onths followed by 10 mg/kg 
every 90 days is expected to yield P K exposures similar to thos e of the related anti-CTLA-4 
mAb ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], given at a dose of 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks (q3w)  for 4 cycles (12 weeks) 
followed by 10 mg/kg every 3 months  (beginning on Week 24), the  dosing regimen that was 
tested in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_118354]-line melanoma trial.  Retrospective analyses of the Phase I and II tremelimumab melan oma studies show an 
improvement in OS for patients w ho were able to achieve a highe r tremelimumab exposure, as 
measured by [CONTACT_255701]-time c urve (AUC). The median OS 
was significantly longer in t he high-AUC group (15.3 months; N= 164) versus the low- AUC 
group (6.0 months; N=163) (based on the median value of AUC [10 3570 μ.h /mL]). This 
difference in OS corresponds t o a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.41 (p< 0.001), and the estimated survival 
rates in these 2 groups were 59% v ersus 29%, respectively, at 1  year. Additionally, a 
retrospective exposure and sur vival analysis of 293 patients tr eated with tremelimumab in a 
Phase III study in patients with m elanoma showed better OS in p atients with higher exposure. 
The median OS was 18.4 months  for the high-AUC group (≥123665 μ g.h /mL) compared to 9.0 
months for the low-AUC gr oup (<123665 μ.h/mL) (HR 0.5; p<0.001) . Tremelimumab 
monotherapy at a dose of 750 mg q4 w for 7 doses (cycles) follow ed by 750 mg q12w for 2 
additional doses (cycles) is equivalent to 10 mg/kg tremelimuma b monotherapy with the same 
dosing schedule. Therefore, the c urrent study will utilize the following dosing regimen: 
Tremelimumab 750 mg once every 4 weeks for up to 7 doses.

tubal ligation, bilate ral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectom y) or post-menopausal. Females 
of childbearing potential who are  sexually active with a non-st erilized male partner must use at 
least 1 highly  effective method of contraception (Table 2) from the time of s creening and must 
agree to continue using such precautions for [ADDRESS_670060] use male cond om plus spermicide throughout 
this period. Cessation of birth cont rol after this  point should  be discussed with a responsible 
physician. Not engaging in sexual activity for the total durati on of the drug treatment and the 
drug washout period is an acceptable practice; however, periodi c abstinence, the rhythm method, 
and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth c ontrol.  
 Female subjects should also re frain from breastfeeding througho ut this period. 
Women will be considered post-me nopausal if they have been amen orrheic for 12 months 
without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specifi c requirements apply:  
 Women < [ADDRESS_670061]-menopausal range for  the institution or underwent s urgical sterilization 
(bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).  
 Women ≥ [ADDRESS_670062] menses >[ADDRESS_670063] menses >1 year ago, or  underwent surgical 
sterilization (bilat eral oophorectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_49838]). 
 5.3.[ADDRESS_670064] use a male condom plus spermicide from screening through 9 0 days after receipt of the 
final dose of tremelimumab. Not engaging in sexual activity is an acceptable practice; however, 
occasional abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal me thod are not acceptable 
methods of contraception. Male subj ects should refrain from spe rm donation throughout this 
period.  Female partners (of childbeari ng potential) of male subjects mu st also use a highly effective 
method of contraception throughout  this period (Table 2).  High ly effective methods of 
contraception, defined as one tha t results in a low failure rat e (ie, less than 1% per year) when

Version Date: 28MAR2019 C onfidential Page 24 of 69 6.2 Dose Delays/Dose Modifications 
The following general guidance should be followed for managemen t of tremelimumab-related 
toxicities. 
 Treat each of the toxicities w ith maximum supportive care (incl uding holding the 
agent suspected of causing t he toxicity if required). 
 If the symptoms promptly resolve with supportive care, consider ation should be 
given to continuing study drug along  with appropriate continuin g supportive 
care. 
 If medically appropriate, dose modifications are permitted (App endix 1) 
 All dose modifications should be do cumented with clear reasonin g and documentation of 
the approach taken. 
 Guidelines for the management  of immune-mediate d reactions, inf usion-related reactions, and 
non-immune-mediated reactions a re provided in Appendix 1, Dosin g Modification and Toxicity 
Management Guidelines. In additi on, there are certain circumsta nces in which tremelimumab 
should be permanently discontin ued (see Section 6.4 and Appendi x 1). 
 Following the first dose of st udy drug, subsequent administrati on tremelimumab can be modified 
based on toxicities observed as  described in Appendix 1, the Do sing Modification and Toxicity 
Management Guidelines. These  guidelines apply to adverse events  considered by [CONTACT_516976]. In ca se of doubt, the site investigator 
should consult with the sponsor-investigator.  6.[ADDRESS_670068] or ALT ≥ [ADDRESS_670069] together with total bilirubin ≥ [ADDRESS_670070], refer to

staging. Prior genomic or molecu lar testing results are require d if available. 
 
2: Vital signs to include: blood pressure, pulse, temperature, res pi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], weight, height (screening only) and ECOG perform ance status.  
Please see Section 5 for guidelines regarding vital signs durin g study drug infusion. 
 3: Resting 12-lead ECGs will be recorded at screening and as cl inically indicated throughout the study. ECGs should be obtaine d after the patient 
has been in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_19636] 5 minutes and recorded while the patient remains in that position. In case of clinically sig nificant ECG 
abnormalities, including a QTcF value >470 ms, 2 additional 12- lead ECGs should be obtained over a brief period (eg, 30 minute s) to confirm. 
 
4: Thyroid Function (TSH, T4 and T3) will be done prior to trea tment C1D1 then C3D1, C5D1, and C7 D1 or more often if clinicall y indicated per 
site investigator discretion. For T4 and T3, free versus total is at the discretion of the site investigator. 
 5: For women of childbearing potential (WOCBP): urine or serum βhCG if clinically appropriate. If a urine test is done and it is positive or cannot 
be confirmed as negative, a serum  pregnancy test will be requir ed.   
 6: Active infection, including tu berculosis (clinical evaluatio n that includes clinical history, physical examination and radi ographic findings, and 
tuberculosis testing in line with  local practice), hepatitis B,  hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, positive HI V 1 or 2 antibodies). 
Active hepatitis B virus (HBV) i nfection is defined by a positi ve HBV surface antigen (HBsAg)  result. Subjects with a past or resolved HBV 
infection (defined as the presen ce of hepatitis B core IgG anti body and the absence of HBsAg, deo xyribonucleic acid [DNA] nega tive) are eligible. 
Subjects positive for hepatitis C v irus (HCV) antibody are elig ible only if polymerase chain r eaction is negative for HCV ribo nucleic acid (RNA). 
 7: Urinalysis for bilirubin, bl ood, glucose, ketones, pH, prote in, specific gravity to be perfo rmed at screening and as clinic ally indicated throughout 
the study per site inves tigator’s discretion. 
 
8: Radiology imaging to include: CT of the chest, CT or MRI of the abdomen/pelvis and bone scan  (in subjects with bone metasta sis). Scans 
should be performed at screening then every 2 months (± 7 days)  during Cycles 1-7 (e.g., after C 2, C4, etc.) and then every 3 months (± 7 days) 
until the time of progression. Imaging for the D30 safety visit  may be omitted if already performed within [ADDRESS_670076] months.

site investigator) and should b e performed ~30 days (+7 days) a fter the last dose of treatment. Subjects who have an ongoing G rade ≥ 2 or serious 
AE (SAE) at this visit will con tinue to be followed until the A E resolves to ≤ Grade 1 or baselin e, deemed clinically insignif icant, and/or until a 
new anti-cancer treatment starts, whichever is earlier. 
 15: Subjects completing study treatment without evidence of dis ease progression will be followed every 3 months for progressio n. Subjects with 
disease progression within 1 year o f completing initial treatme nt with tremelimumab may be eligible for re-treatment with trem elimumab. After 
progression for subjects who are not candidates for tremelimuma b retreatment or who initiate other anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], patie nts will be followed 
for survival which may be accomp lished via clinic visit, phone call, or other avenues as appropriate. Subjects who decline to return to the site for

analyses including but not lim ited to DNA sequencing, RNA seque ncing, and tissue 
imaging/multiplex staining.  8.1.[ADDRESS_670082] of care procedu res (e.g., metastatic biopsies) will 
be collected during this study. S ubjects may have tumor tissue obtained during the course of the 
study or at the time of disease  progression for clinical purpos es (e.g., confirmation of disease 
progression, management of com plication of disease progression,  etc.). Specimens obtained in 
these settings may be accessed by t he research team to facilita te an understanding of the 
pharmacodynamic effects of treatme nt at the level of the tumor and microenvironment including 
mechanisms of treatment resista nce.  Subjects will have the opt ion of whether samples obtained 
during standard of care procedur es may be used for research pur poses. 
 8.2 Blood Samples For blood samples, the volume  of blood and type of tube to be u sed for each collection is 
specified in Table 3 and CLM.  C ollection of whole blood sample s is mandatory for participation 
in this study. Blood samples for r esearch will also be collecte d for subjects receiving re-
treatment after progression.  8.2.1 Blood for Immune cell subsets The quantity and composition of imm une cells in the peripheral blood will be analyzed by [CONTACT_516981]. Antigen specific T cell responses will be detected as described 
above.    8.2.2 Peripheral blood for DNA and RNA Plasma will be stored for futur e ctDNA isolation and quantitati ve expression using sequence 
specific primers and/or for exo me sequencing. DNA from whole bl ood may be used to germline 
sequencing to facilitate analysi s of somatic tumor DNA sequenci ng. Whole blood will be stored 
for gene expression profiling from RNA.   8.3 Stool for microbiome analysis Prior to treatment, patients will provide a stool sample from a  single bowel movement for 
microbiome analysis as per the CLM. Stool samples will be analy zed to assess microbiome 
diversity and composition. Explorat ory analyses correlating cli nical outcomes and 
diversity/composition as well as ass essment of metabolomics and  metagenomic whole genome

See section 5.1.[ADDRESS_670084] one measurable lesion. If the measurab le disease is res tricted to a 
solitary lesion, its neoplastic  nature should be confirmed by c ytology/histology.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Measurable lesions 
Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least one 
dimension (longest diameter to be  recorded) as >[ADDRESS_670085] x-ray, as >[ADDRESS_670086] 
scan, or >[ADDRESS_670087] be recorded in 
millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Non- Measurable lesions 
All other lesions (or sites of di sease), including small lesion s (longest diameter <10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with ≥  10 to <15 mm short axis), are c onsidered non-measurable 
disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleura l/pericardial effusions, 
lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and  abdominal masses (not followed 
by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non-measurable.  NOTE:   Cystic lesions that meet the c riteria for radiographically de fined simple cysts should not 
be considered as malignant lesi ons (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to repre sent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, 
if they meet the definition of m easurability described above. H owever, if non-cystic lesions are 
present in the same subject, the se are preferred for selection as target lesions.

To be considered pathologically e nlarged and measurable, a lymp h node must be >[ADDRESS_670088] s can (CT scan slice thickness re commended to be no greater 
than 5 mm).  At baseline and i n follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Baseline documentation of “T arget” and “Non-Target” les ions 
 
Target lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a m aximum of 2 lesions per organ a nd 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involve d organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and 
measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the  basis of their size (lesions with 
the longest diameter), be represe ntative of all involved organs , but in addition should be those 
that lend themselves to reproduc ible repeated measurements.  It  may be the case that, on 
occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducib le measurement in which 
circumstance the next largest les ion which can be measured repr oducibly should be selected.  A 
sum of the diameters (longest  for non-nodal le sions, short axis  for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and re ported as the baseline sum dia meters.  If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then only the s hort axis is added into the  sum.  The baseline sum diameters 
will be used as reference to fur ther characterize any objective  tumor regression in the measurable 
dimension of the disease.  Non-target lesions   
All other lesions (or sites of di sease) including any measurabl e lesions over and above the 5 
target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be reco rded at baseline.  
Measurements of these lesions a re not required, but the presenc e, absence, or in rare cases 
unequivocal progression of eac h should be noted throughout foll ow-up. 
 9.2 Response Criteria 
 
Evaluation of target lesions 
Complete Response (CR) Disappear ance of all target lesions.  An y pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.
Partial Response (PR) At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the  diameters of 
target lesions, taking as r eference the baseline sum 
diameters
Progressive Disease (PD) At leas t a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as r eference the smallest sum on 
study (this includes the base line sum if that is the 
smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  t he appearance of one or more 
new lesions is also considered pro
gressions). 
Stable Disease (SD) Neither su fficient shrink age to qualify for  PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify f or PD, taking as reference 
the smallest sum diameters while on stud y. 
Clinical Study Protocol 
HCRN GU17-294 
Version Date: 28MAR2019 C onfidential Page 34 of 69 Evaluation of non-target lesions 
Complete Response (CR) Disappear ance of all non-target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis)  NOTE:   If tumor markers are initially above the 
upper normal limit, they must normalize for a subject to be considered in complete clinical response.
Non-CR/ Non-PD Persistence of one  or more non-target lesion(s) 
and/or maintenance of tum or marker level above 
the normal limits
Progressive Disease (PD) Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of  existing non-target 
lesions.  Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesi on status.  It must be 
representative of overall di sease status change, not 
a sin

 11.1.1  Adverse Event (AE) 
An AE is any untoward medical occu rrence whether or not conside red related to the study drug 
that appears to change in inte nsity during the course of the st udy. The following are examples of 
AEs:  
 Unintended or unfavorab le sign or symptom 
 A disease temporally associate d with participa tion in the proto col 
 An intercurrent illnes s or injury that impairs the well-being o f the subject 
 Abnormal laboratory values or diag nostic test results constitut e AEs only if they induce clinical 
signs or symptoms or require tre atment or further diagnostic te sts   
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_516957]

such as administration of chemot herapy, central line insertion,  metastasis interventional 
therapy, resection of primary tum or, or elective surgery, will not be considered serious 
adverse events. 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 Is an important medical event ( defined as a medical event(s) th at may not be immediately 
life-threatening or r esult in death or ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_313], bas ed upon appropriate medical 
and scientific judgment, may jeopa rdize the subject or may requ ire intervention (e.g.,

11.1.[ADDRESS_670096] (AESI) is one of scientifi c and medical interest specific to 
understanding of the study drug(s)  and may require close monito ring and rapid communication 
by [CONTACT_516984]-investigator. An AESI m ay be serious or non-serious. The 
rapid reporting of AESIs allows ongo ing surveillance of these e vents in order to characterize and 
understand them in association w ith the use of the study drug(s ). If any AESI occurs in the 
course of the study, then the site  investigators or other site personnel should report to Hoosier 
Cancer Research Network (HCRN) within 1 business day  of becoming aware of the event. 
HCRN will report to [COMPANY_008] within 1 business day  of becoming aware of the event. AESIs 
for tremelimumab include, but a re not limited to, events with a  potential inflammatory or 
immune-mediated mechanism and that may require more frequent mo nitoring and/or 
interventions such as steroids , immunosuppressant s, and/or horm one replacement therapy. These 
AESIs are being closely monitore d in clinical studies with trem elimumab therapy.  
 An imAE is defined as an AE th at is associated with drug exposu re and is consistent with an 
immune-mediated mechanism of ac tion and where there is no clear  alternate etiolo gy. Serologic, 
immunologic, and histologic (biops y) data, as appropriate, shou ld be used to support an imAE 
diagnosis. Appropriate efforts s hould be made to rule out neopl astic, infectious, metabolic, toxin, 
or other etiologic causes of th e imAE. In the event of imAE or suspected imAE, the sponsor-
investigator may request relevan t clinical infor mation (includi ng images) for those subjects who 
demonstrate the event and may r equest the independent review by  [CONTACT_516985].

11.1.4  Unexpected Adverse Event 
For this study, an AE is consider ed unexpected when it varies i n nature, intensity or frequency 
from information provided in the c urrent IB, pres cribing inform ation or when it is not included in 
the informed consent document as a potential risk. Unexpected a lso refers to AEs that are 
mentioned in the IB as occurri ng with a class of drugs or are a nticipated from the 
pharmacological properties of t he drug, but are not specificall y mentioned as occurring with the 
particular drug under investigation.    11.1.5  Relatedness 
AEs will be categorized according to the likelihood that they a re related to the study drug(s). 
Specifically, they will be categorized using the following term s:  
 
Unrelated Adverse Event is not related  to the study drug(s)  
Unlikely Adverse Event is doubtfully related  to the study drug(s)  
Possible Adverse Event may be related  to the study drug(s)

All pregnancies and outcomes of  pregnancy should be reported to  [COMPANY_008] except for: 
 Pregnancy discovered before the s tudy subject has received any study drugs. 
 Pregnancy of a female partner of  male subject, providing there is no restriction of male 
subject fathering a child. 
 
11.6.3 Maternal exposure If a patient becomes pregnant dur ing the course of the study, t he study drug(s) should be 
discontinued immediately. Pregnanc y itself is not regarded as a n AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_516959](s) may have i nterfered with the effectivene ss of a contraceptive medication. 
Congenital abnormalities or birth defects and spontaneous misca rriages should be reported and 
handled as SAEs. Elective aborti ons without complications shoul d not be handled as AEs.
 The 
outcome of all pregnancies (sponta neous miscarriage, elective t ermination, ectopic pregnancy, 
normal birth, or congenital abnormality) should be followed up and documented even if the 
patient was discontinued from the study.   If any pregnancy occurs in the cou rse of the study, then the si te investigator or other site 
personnel will inform HCRN within [ADDRESS_670099] dose of t remelimumab.  Pregnancy of the patient’s partner is not considered 
to be an AE. However, the outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneo us miscarriage, elective 
termination, ectopic pregnanc y, normal birth, or congenital abn ormality) occurring from the date 
of the first dose until [ADDRESS_670100] be reported to AstraZ eneca as follows: 
 Death that is clearly the res ult of disease progression should be documented but should 
not be reported as an SAE. 
 Where death is not due (or not c learly due) to progression of t he disease under study, the 
AE causing the death mus t be reported to HCRN within 24 hours  and HCRN will report 
to [COMPANY_008] as a SAE within  24 hours . The report should  contain a comment 
regarding the co-involvement  of progression of disease, if appr opriate, and should assign 
main and contributory causes of death.  
 Deaths with an unknown cause should always be reported as a SAE .

 12.1 Study Design 
This is a phase II trial designe d to estimate the activity of s ingle agent tremelimumab in subjects 
with metastatic uroth elial cancer with dis ease progression desp ite prior treatment with PD-1/PD-
L1 blockade. There is currentl y no standard treatment for such subjects. Therefore, given the 
durability of responses observed w ith immune checkpoint blockad e, even a relatively low 
response proportion could be clin ically meaningful. A Simon’s 2 -stage design will be applied.    
 12.2 Endpoints 
 12.2.1  Definition of Primary Endpoint 
The primary endpoint is to determ ine the response rate by [CONTACT_174583] T 1.1 
 12.2.2  Definition of Secondary Endpoints 
 Safety will be determined according to the NCI Common Terminolo gy Criteria for 
Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.03 
 Duration of response will be the time from the first documentat ion of response to the time 
of progression as per RECIST 1.1 or death  
 Progression-free survival which i s defined as the time from tre atment initiation to death 
or progression, depending on which occurs first 
 Overall survival is defined as the time from treatment initiati on to death  
 12.3 Sample Size and Accrual 
A Simon’s 2-stage design
14 will be applied. Patients who do not receive drug or who do no t 
complete 1 cycle of therapy for non- treatment related causes (e g, traffic accidents, trauma etc) 
will be replaced.   The null hypothesis that the true response rate is 2% will be t ested against a one-sided 
alternative. In the first sta ge, 18 subjects will be accrued. I f there are 0 responses in these 18 
subjects, enrollment will be stopped. Otherwise, 10 additional subjects will be accrued for a total 
of 28. The null hypothesis will be rejected if 3 or more respon ses are observed in 28 subjects. 
This design yields a type I  error rate of 0.02 and power of 80%  when the true response rate is 
15% or larger.  12.[ADDRESS_670101] one dose of 
tremelimumab and will be used in the assessment of toxicity. Sa fety will be determined

frequency tables. Progression fr ee survival and overall surviva l curves will be based on the 
Kaplan-Meier method.   12.6.3  Analysis Plans for Exploratory Objectives 
To explore the relationship betw een PD-L1 expression and respon se to treatment, Fisher's exact 
test will be used. To explore th e relationship between molecula r subtype of bladder cancer and 
response to treatment, frequency tables will be constructed and  Fisher's exact test will be used. 
 
To explore the relationship betw een genomic alterations, includ ing mutational load, and changes 
in circulating immune biomarkers  and response to treatment both  Fisher's exact test and T-test 
will be used. Exploratory analys es correlating clinical outcome s and adverse events with stool 
microbiome diversity/composition a s well as assessment of metab olomics and metagenomic 
whole genome sequencing may also be performed.   12.7 Interim Analysis/Crite ria for Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_516960] -4 blockade in metastatic

confidence intervals (CIs) of t hese treatment-related Grade ≥ 3  adverse event rates will be 
constructed. If their lower  bounds exceed 33%, the study drug w ill be considered unacceptably 
toxic for this patient population and enrollment will be halted . This corresponds to ≥ 5 out of 6 
patients with grade ≥ 3 adverse events, ≥ 8 out of 12 patients with grade ≥ 3 adverse events, ≥ 10 
out of 18 patients with grade ≥  3 adverse events , and ≥ 13 out  of 24 subjects with grade ≥ [ADDRESS_670107] 17 patients respond and

Dosing Modification and Toxic ity Management Guidelines for Immu ne-Mediated, Infusion -Related, and  
Non-Immune –Mediated Reactions   
General Considerations 
Dose Modifications Toxicity Management 
Drug administration m odifications of study drug/study regimen 
will be made to manage potential immune-related AEs based on 
severity of treatment-emergent toxicities graded per NCI CTCAE 
v4.03. 
In addition to the criteria for permanent discontinuation of st udy 
drug/study regimen based on CTC g rade/severity (table below), 
permanently discontinue study  drug/study regimen for the 
following conditions: 
 Inability to reduce corticoste roid to a dose of ≤10 mg of 
prednisone per day (or equivalent) within [ADDRESS_670117] 
dose of study drug/study regimen 
 Recurrence of a previously expe rienced Grade 3 treatment-
related AE following resumption of dosing 
Grade 1  No dose modification 
Grade 2  Hold study drug/study regi men dose until Grade 2 
resolution to Grade ≤1. 
If toxicity worsens, then tr eat as Grade 3 or Grade 4. 
Study drug/study regimen can be resumed once eve nt stabilizes t o 
Grade ≤1 after comple tion of steroid taper. 
Patients with endocrinopathies who may require prolonged or 
continued steroid replacement can be retreated with study 
drug/study regimen on th e following conditions: 
1. The event stabilizes and is controlled. 
2. The patient is clinically stable as per Investigator or treatin g 
physician’s clinical judgement. 
3. Doses of prednisone are at ≤10 mg/day or equivalent. It is recommended that management of immune-mediated adverse ev ents (imAEs) follows the 
guidelines presented in this table: 
− It is possible that events with an inflammatory or immune media ted mechanism could occur 
in nearly all organs, s ome of them not noted specifically in th ese guidelines. 
− Whether specific immune -mediated events (and/or laboratory indi cators of such events) are 
noted in these guidelines or not, patients should be thoroughly  evaluated to rule out any 
alternative etiology (e.g., disease progression, concomitant me dications, and in fections) to a 
possible immune-mediated event. In the absence of a clear alter native etiology, all such 
events should be manag ed as if they were i mmune related. Genera l recommendations 
follow. 
− Symptomatic and topi[INVESTIGATOR_8588] s hould be considered for low-gr ade (Grade 1 or 2, unless 
otherwise specified) events.  
− For persistent (>3 to 5 days) lo w-grade (Grade 2) or severe (Gr ade ≥3) events, promptly 
start prednisone 1 to 2 mg/ kg/day PO or IV equivalent. 
− Some events with high likelihood for morbidity and/or mortality  – e.g., myo-carditis, or 
other similar events even if the y are not currently noted in th e guidelines – should progress 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_516963] (methylprednisolone at 2 to 4 mg/kg/day) even if the 
event is Grade 2, and if clinical  suspi[INVESTIGATOR_27551]/or ther e has been clinical 
confirmation. Consider, as necessary, discussing with the study  physician, and promptly 
pursue specialist consultation. 
− If symptoms recur or worsen during corticosteroid tapering (28 days of taper), increase the 
corticosteroid dose (prednisone d ose [e.g., up to 2 to 4 mg/kg/ day PO or IV equivalent]) 
until stabilization or improvement of symptoms, then resume cor ticosteroid tapering at a 
slower rate (>28 days of taper). 
− More potent immunosuppressives su ch as TNF inhibitors (e.g., in fliximab) (also refer to the 
individual sections of the imAE s for specific type of immunosup pressive) should be 
considered for events not respon ding to systemic steroids. Prog ression to use of more potent 
immunosuppressives should proceed m ore rapi[INVESTIGATOR_516964] h igh likelihood for 
morbidity and/or mortality – e.g ., myocarditis, o r other simila r events even if they are not 
currently noted in the guidelines – when these events are not r esponding to systemic 
steroids. 
− With long-term steroid and other immunosuppressive use, conside r need for Pneumocystis 
jirovecii pneumonia (PJP, formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii  pneumonia) 
prophylaxis, gastrointestinal pro tection, and gluc ose monitorin g.

Dose Modifications Toxicity Management 
Grade 3  Depending on the indiv idual toxicity, study 
drug/study regimen ma y be permanently 
discontinued. Please refe r to guidelines below. 
Grade 4  Permanently discontinue study drug/study regimen. 
Note: For Grade ≥3 asymptomatic amylase or lipase levels, hold 
study drug/study regimen, and  if complete work up shows no 
evidence of pancreatitis, study drug/study regimen may be 
continued or resumed. 
Note: Study drug/study regimen should be permanently 
discontinued in Grade 3 events with high likelihood for morbidi ty 
and/or mortality – e.g., myocardi tis, or other similar events e ven if 
they are not currently noted i n the guidelines. Similarly, cons ider 
whether study drug/study regi men should be permanently 
discontinued in Grade 2 events with high likelihood for morbidi ty 
and/or mortality – e.g., myocardi tis, or other similar events e ven if 
they are not currently noted in the guidelines – when they do n ot

and following full taper 
Note: There are some exceptions  to permanent discontinuation of  
study drug for Grade 4 events (i.e., hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, Type 1 diabetes mellitus).  
 − Discontinuation of study drug/st udy regimen is not mandated for  Grade 3/Grade 4 
inflammatory reactions attributed  to local tumor response (e.g. , inflammatory reaction at 
sites of metasta tic disease and lymph nodes). Continuation of s tudy drug/study regimen in 
this situation should be  based upon a benefit-risk analysis for  that patient.

Pneumonitis/Interstitial 
Lung Disease (ILD) Any Grade General Guid ance For Any Grade: 
− Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis or 
ILD (new onset or worsening sh ortness of breath or cough). 
Patients should be evaluated w ith imaging and pulmonary 
function tests, including other diagnostic procedures as 
described below. 
− Initial work-up may include clinical evaluation, monitoring of 
oxygenation via pulse oxime try (resting and exertion), 
laboratory work-up, and high- resolution CT scan. 
Grade 1 
(asymptomatic, clinical 
or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not 
indicated) No dose modifications  required. However, 
consider holding study drug/study 
regimen dose as clinic ally appropriate and 
during diagnostic work-up for other etiologies. For Grade 1 (radiogra phic changes only): 
− Monitor and closely follow up in 2 to 4 days for clinical 
symptoms, pulse oximetry (re sting and exertion), and 
laboratory work-up and then  as clinically indicated. 
− Consider Pulmonary and Inf ectious disease consult. 
Grade 2 
(symptomatic; medical 
intervention indicated; limiting instrumental 
ADL) Hold study drug/study regimen dose until 
Grade 2 resolution to Grade ≤1. 
 If toxicity worsens, then treat as 
Grade 3 or Grade 4. 
 If toxicity improves to Grade ≤1, 
then the decision to reinitiate study 
drug/study regimen will be based 
upon treating physician’s clinical judgment and after completion of 
steroid taper. For Grade 2 (mild to mo derate new symptoms): 
− Monitor symptoms daily and  consider hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
− Promptly start systemic ster oids (e.g., prednisone 1 to 
2 mg/kg/day PO or IV equivalent). 
− Reimage as clinically indicated. 
− If no improvement within 3 to 5 days, additional workup 
should be considered and pr ompt treatment with IV 
methylprednisolone 2 t o 4 mg/kg/day started 
− If still no improvement with in 3 to 5 days despi[INVESTIGATOR_27554] 2 to 4  mg/kg/day, promptly start

syndromes 
(such as Guillain-Barre

− The prompt diagnosis of i mmune-mediated peripheral 
neuromotor syndromes is importa nt, since certain patients may 
unpredictably experien ce acute decompensati ons that can result 
in substantial morbidity or in th e worst case, death. Special c are 
should be taken for certain senti nel symptoms that may predict 
a more severe outcome, such as  prominent dysphagia, rapi[INVESTIGATOR_118392], and signs o f respi[INVESTIGATOR_516965]. 
− Patients should be evaluated to rule out any alternative etiolo gy 
(e.g., disease progression, infec tions, metabolic  syndromes or 
medications). It should be noted  that the diagnos is of immune-
mediated peripheral neuromotor s yndromes can be particularly 
challenging in patients with underlying cancer, due to the 
multiple potential confounding effects of cancer (and its 
treatments) throughout the neuraxi s. Given the importance of 
prompt and accurate diagnosis, it is essential to have a low 
threshold to obtain a neurological consult. 
− Neurophysiologic dia gnostic testing (e .g., electromyogram and 
nerve conduction invest igations, and “repe titive stimulation” i f 
myasthenia is suspected) are ro utinely indicated upon suspi[INVESTIGATOR_516966] b est facilitated by [CONTACT_3553] a

MYASTHENIA GRAVIS: 
o Steroids may be successfully  used to treat myasthenia 
gravis. It is importa nt to consider that steroid therapy 
(especially with high doses) may result in transient 
worsening of myasthenia and should typi[INVESTIGATOR_83742] a monitore d setting under supervision

o Patients unable to tolerate steroids may be candidates 
for treatment with plasmapheresis or IV IG. Such 
decisions are best made i n consultation with a 
neurologist, taking into account the unique needs of 
each patient. 
o If myasthenia gravis-like neurotoxicity is present, 
consider starting AChE inhibitor therapy in addition 
to steroids. Such therapy, if successful, can also serve 
to reinforce the diagnosis.

Myocarditis  Any Grade General Guidance 
Discontinue drug permanently if 
biopsy-proven immune-mediated 
myocarditis. For Any Grade: 
− The prompt diagnosis of immune-mediated myocarditis is 
important, particularly in patients with baseline 
cardiopulmonary disease and reduced cardiac function.  
− Consider, as necessary, discussing with the study physician. 
− Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myocarditis (new 
onset or worsening chest pain, arrhythmia, shortness of breath,  
peripheral edema). As some sym ptoms can overlap with lung 
toxicities, simultaneously evaluat e for and rule out pulmonary 
toxicity as well as other causes (e.g., pulmonary embolism, 
congestive heart failure, maligna nt pericardial effusion). A 
Cardiology consultation should be  obtained early, with prompt 
assessment of whether and when to complete a cardiac biopsy, 
including any other diagnostic procedures. 
− Initial work-up should include  clinical evaluation, BNP, 
cardiac enzymes, ECG, echocar diogram (ECHO), monitoring 
of oxygenation via pulse oximetr y (resting and exertion), and 
additional laboratory work-up as indicated. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_118396].

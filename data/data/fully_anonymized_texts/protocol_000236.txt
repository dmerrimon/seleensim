The Effect of Loop Diuretics on Severity and Outcome of Acute Kidney Injury  
 
 
RESEARCH PLAN  
 
A. Specific Aims  
The goal of the study is to determine the severity of acute kidney injury (AKI) early in the clinical course of 
the disease.  Patients who su ffer from acute kidney injury can have one of four potential outcomes (1) 
recovery of kidney function without  need for dialysis (2) recovery of kidney function with need for dialysis 
(3) need for dialysis without renal recovery, and (4) death.  The goal of  the study is to determine if we can 
identify which clinical course will occur early in the course of the disease.  5) We seek to determine how 
well physicians caring for those with AKI can predict the clinical course compared to novel biomarkers of 
AKI. 6)   we seek to determine the association between this clinical course and 3 year patient outcomes.  
 
B. Background and Significance  
AKI is a very common disease in patient admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_354165], patients with AKI carry a high mortality rate (50% to 70%). [1]  AKI affects nearly 5 percent of all 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_354166] 15 percent of critically ill patients.  [1, 2]  Curren tly, there are no FDA 
approved therapeutic agents for the treatment or prevention of AKI.    
Recently, at a large international consensus meeting held in Vancouver, BC, [3] the single most important 
question that was  raised by [CONTACT_354173] (e.g dialysis). 
Retrospective studies suggest that the early initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT) improves 
outcome.  [4-7] 
Howev er, a significant subset of patients with AKI recovers without the need for RRT. Many clinicians tend 
to take a “wait and see” approach because they do not want to dialyze a patient who is destined to recover 
renal function without the need for RRT. Theref ore, it is vitally important to know early in the course which 
patients with AKI are likely to progress to RRT.  
 
C. Preliminary Studies  
The majority of studies on the timing of initiation of dialysis have been case series with historical controls 
or retros pective case -control series that were performed early after the routine clinical use of dialysis was 
first introduced. For this reason, the BUN at the initiation of dialysis in the "early" treatment group in these 
previous studies were high by [CONTACT_33366]’s stan dards.  
 
More recently, Gettings et al. [8] conducted a retrospe ctive study of patients with posttraumatic AKI and 
stratified patients on the basis of timing of the initiation of dialysis into "low" and "high" degree of azotemia 
groups using a BUN cutoff of 60 mg/dl. Mortality rates among patients who initiated dialysi s at the lower 
BUN cutoff was 61%, compared with 80% among those who started dialysis with higher BUN levels (P = 
0.04).  
 
Additional studies [9, 10]  examined the timing of initiation of dialysis for AKI after cardia c surgery and 
demonstrated a benefit to earlier initiation of dialysis. These studies used a definition of AKI to justify the 
provision of early dialysis of a urine output <[ADDRESS_441125] 8 h after by[CONTACT_354174]. De mirkilic et al. [9]studied a total of 61 patients; the overall mortality rate in those who 
were treated with early dialysis was 24%, compared with 56% in control subjects (P = 0.016). Elahi et al.  
[10] reported the results of their analysis of 64 patients with postby[CONTACT_354175]; the overall mortality rate in

 those who were treated with early dialysis was 22%, compared with 43% in control subjects (P<0.05). 
However, the relevance of these data to nonpostoperative patients or to patients with nonoliguric AKI is 
uncle ar.  
 
Liu et al. [3] showed that even with adjustment for confounding and selection effects, patients with higher 
BUN concentrations at the start of dialysis had worse outcomes as compared to those patients with lowe r 
BUNs.  
 
Since the initiation of this protocol, we have recruited subjects with early 
Stage 1 AKI (a 0.3 mg/dL absolute or 50% relative increase in serum 
creatinine or 0.5 ml/kg/hr of urine output for 12 hours – AKIN Stage 1 ) to 
prospectively receive a one-time furosemide bolus. We have recently 
published our preliminary data describing patient outcomes following the 
Furosemide challenge [11]This Renal Stress test was prospectively 
administered to 54 ICU patients (across 2 centers)  in the setting of early  
AKI and was dosed at Fu rosemide 1 mg/kg for loop diuretic naïve patients 
(1.5 mg/kg for those who had previous loop exposu re). Over the first [ADDRESS_441126] the development of 
Stage 3 AKI (AUC s 0.82-0.87) as well as a composite endpo int of Stage 3

were noted to have previously received an FST in the setting of Stage 1

Figure  1 demonstrates the UOP in progressors (those reaching Stage 3, 
n=25) and  non-progressors (n=52) in the first [ADDRESS_441128]

specific (84.1%) ma rker for the progression to Stage 3 AKI.[11] This 
cutoff of 200 mls remained extremely sensitive for the composite 
endpo int of AKIN-3 and death (90%) although the specificity did drop 
(74.2%). Finally and most importantly, the FST was extremely well 
tolerated with no epi[INVESTIGATOR_354168].  This stems from the pre-enrollment 
selection of patients who were euvolemic and stable for FST as deemed 
by [CONTACT_191499]. Additionally, treating teams were given the 
option to replace urinary losses  after FST with the IV fluid of their 
choos ing.  Figure 1: Urine Output following FST in Progressors (n=25,

Future studies are needed to validate our preliminary data as well as assess the post -
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_354169]. Once the fu rosemide challenge is validated   
and we have a method to  identify severe early AKI then and only then can we focus on 
randomized prospective studies on early versus late RRT in patients with AKI.  
 
D. Research Design and Methods  
We plan to enroll up to  [ADDRESS_441131] tubular 
injury and therefore renal tubular dysfunction. We hypothesize that patients with severe 
AKI (AKI tha t will require RRT) will have more severe tubular dysfunction than patients 
with less severe AKI (AKI that improves without the need for RRT). Because patients 
with AKI are often treated with furosemide we plan to test the hypothesis that a poor 
response t o furosemide will identify patients with severe AKI. Furosemide works in the 
renal tubules, and the ability of furosemide to cause an effective diuresis is contingent on 
a functioning renal tubule.  
 
Study Design  
Patients who are suffering from AKI will be eligible. For purposes of this study, AKI will 
be defined using the Acute Renal Injury Network(AKIN) criteria [12]: an increase in 
serum creatinine of greater than or equal to 0.3 mg/dL over 48 hours or increase to greater 
than or equa l to 150 to 200 percent from baseline or sustained oliguria (mean output of 
<0.5 cc/kg/hr for 6 hours).. For patients who meet entry criteria based on serum 
creatinine, those subjects must be enrolled within [ADDRESS_441132] -
renal AKI will be excluded.  
 
Intervention  
Once patients are identified and consented,  at the time of study entry 7 cc of whole blood 
and 50 cc of urine will be collected. The reafter, a single bolus of furosemide will be given 
to the patient.    
 
Furosemide - If the patient is furosemide naive, they will receive a dose of 1.0 mg/kg. If 
patient takes a loop diuretic at home, or has been receiving furosemide previous to study 
entry, the dose of furosemide will be 1.5 mg/kg.  The patient will be assessed for 6 hours  
following the furosemide administration  (with a second blood draw/urine collection  at 2 
hours ). All blood draws / urine col lections will be 1 tube of blood (5 -7 ccs) a nd 25 -50 
ccs of urine (when possible)  
 
Baseline urine output and post -furosemide urine output will be recorded.  Urinary 
sediment will also be assessed at both 0 and 2 hours .  
   
Blood Studies  -  Blood samples (plasma)  will be spun down ( 15 minutes at 1,6 00 x g ) 
and aliquoted (0.5 ml for plasma )  and placed in -80 freezer.  These samples will be 
IRB# 10 -503-B  4 
CRSO Version:  16Mar2015  
 
  assessed for plasma levels of neutrophil gelatinase lipocalin  (NGAL)  and potentially  for 
other AKI biomarkers.  
 
Urine Studies   -  Urine will be spun ( 1,000 x g a t 4°C.  for 10 minutes ) )   and aliquoted. 
Urine will be assessed for Tissue Inhibitor Metalloprotease -2 (TIMP2), insulin -like 
growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) NGAL  potentially other biomarkers AKI 
biomarkers .  All of these proteins are evolving po tential AKI biomarkers.  
  
Long Term Follow -up 
Subjects will be contact[CONTACT_354176] [ADDRESS_441133]  their outside physicians for 
any / all relevant lab work collected (complete blood counts , comprehensive metabolic 
panel and any urine studies). T hey will also be asked questions to ascertain the incidence 
of any Major Adverse Renal –Cardiac Events (MARCE) – these include death, new 
dialysis, worsening of kidney function (CKD), myocardial infarction, stroke or heart 
failure. [13]   Finally, subjects will be  providing consent for linkage with administrative 
database such as the Social Securit y Death Index (SSDI) and the [LOCATION_002] Renal 
Data System (USRDS).  
 
Physician Assessment:  
At the study enrollment, 24 hour, ICU discharge and hosp ital discharge timepoints we will 
ask members of the treating  team (attending, fellows, residents and nu rses) a simple 8 
question survey (with only questions 5-7 being asked at hosp ital discharge) All answers 
(accept question 1 will be given on a 5-point Likert scale (strongly disagree, disagree, neu tral, 
agree, and  strongly agree). : 
 
1) What is the source of the patients AKI? (Multiple choices: Pre-renal azotemia, Acute 
tubular necrosis acute interstitial nephritis, athero -emboli, glomerulonephritis, multi -
factorial or other Ischemia, Sepsis, Hypotension, Contrast, Other Nephrotoxin)? 
1b) Contributing causes of A KI (circling all that apply) – decreased perfusion pressure , 
inflammation, contrast, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2517](myo/hemoglobin), aminogylcosides, NSAIDs, 
amphotericin, other)   
2)  This patient’s AKI will progress from Stage 1 to Stage 3 (200% increase in serum 
creatinine)  
3)  This patient will require renal replacement therapy during this hosp ital stay 
4)  This patient will die during this hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
5)  This patient will require renal replacement therapy in the next 3 months 
6)  This patient will return to living at ho me, indepen dently, over the next 3 months 
7)  This patient will be readmitted to the hosp ital in the next 3 months 
8)  This patient will die during the next 3 months

300 45% [ADDRESS_441134] this matched replacement for six 
hours after the furosemide bolus. Since furosemide induces the production of hypotonic 
urine, a milliliter for milliliter matched repletion of nor mal saline guarantees that the 
patient cannot become volume depleted.    
Furosemide is routinely given to patients with AKI, particularly those with acute tubular 
necrosis.  Furosemide has not been shown to be harmful nor helpful in patients suffering 
from  AKI despi[INVESTIGATOR_354170].  
Because we are excluding patients who are pre -renal, we are minimizing the risk of 
volume depletion.  
 
Sample Size:  
The study team aims to enroll  [ADDRESS_441135] we are looking to determine if we can replicate the success of our  pi[INVESTIGATOR_354171] a larger multi-center investigation. In powering the overall validation study we assumed 
80% po wer and 5% alpha with this analysis being performed using SAS, Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003]. [14] 
We used a conse rvative approximation to the variance that assumes independence  of the 
binary variables to calculate power. To investigate the utility of the FST to predict the 
progression from Stage [ADDRESS_441136] p rovided a Table 6 which demonstrates the 
change in the True Positive Rate (ΔTPR) based on the event rate and the risk threshold for 
defining high risk. Recall that the TPR is equivalent to the number of True Positives divided 
by [CONTACT_354178] (TPR= ((TP)/(TP+FN)) and that this is the 
equivalent of McNemar’s test. [15] Moreover it is important to note that ΔTPR is the 
equivalent of the Net Reclassification 
Index  (NRI) for those with the event (Progression to Stage 3 AKI). Practically, this same Table 
demonstrates the 
minimum de tectable 
chan ge in the False 
Positive Rate (ΔFPR). 
The FPR is the number 
of False Positives 
divided 
by [CONTACT_354179] (FPR = 
((FP)/(FP+TN)). 
Additionally, the FPR= 
1-Specificity and 
perhaps more 
importantly, ΔFPR is 
IRB# 10 -503-B  6 
CRSO Version:  16Mar2015  
 
  equivalent to the NRI 
Non Event (non- 
progression to Stage 3). 
Thus one could look at 
Table [ADDRESS_441137] 
varied the cohort 
sample size as well as 
the event rate 
(progression). Event 
rate variation accounts 
for the limited data on 
progressive AKI in the 
existing literature. While our pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299] (n=77) demonstrated an event rate 32% [11], previously 
published s tudies have had varied rates from TRIBE AKI’s (13%) [16], EAR LY-ARF’s (33%) 
[17]and Siew’s et al (29%) [18]. As such a rate progression rate of 30% seems appropriate. To 
interpret Table [ADDRESS_441138] 200 individuals with a 30% AKI progression rate (60 
cases  /AKI progressors) we will be able to detect improvements of 0.15-0.25 in the % of cases  
classified as high risk (∆TPR=NRI events). Inversely, for the sa me coho rt and event rate we 
would be able to detect identical improvements in the ΔFPR (= NRI for non-events). Thus 
with 200 subjects and a 30%  event rate we would be able to detect sm all to medium sized 
impro vemen ts in reclassification (NRI events + NRI non -events =Total NRI 0.30-0.50)[19] 
 
Endpoints and Definitions  
AKI  – an increase in serum creatinine of >0.3 mg/dL or 50% incre ase from baseline over 
48 hours  or an increase to greater than or equal to 150 to 200 percent from baseline or 
sustained oliguria (mean output of <0.5 cc/kg/hr for 6 hours).  
 
Non-renal recovery  
(1) Patients who require RRT within 14d of enrollment  
(2) Patients wh o die before 14d, and whose serum creatinine remains >2.0 mg/dl 
over baseline creatinine at the time of death  
(3) Patients who die before 14d and whose urine output is less than 400cc/24 
hours at the time of death  
 
Renal Recovery  
(1) Patients who do not require RR T and survive 14d or are discharged prior to 14 
days 
(2) Patients who die before 14d with a serum creatinine>2.0 mg/dl above their 
baseline AND with a urine output >400cc/24 hours

  Statistical Analysis  
Patients will be followed for [ADDRESS_441139]. 
Need for dialysis, serum creatinine, urine output, medication   regimens, and mortality 
will be assessed. Primary analysis will be  based on the net reclassification index as 
discussed in the sample size section above, addi tionally we will look at the more 
traditional   receiver operating characteristics (ROC) of urine output and urinary sediment 
score  and biomarkers  after furosemide challenge to predict AKI progression.  
Additionally, time to AKI progression and renal reco very/non -recovery will be assessed. 
Patient outcomes will be stratified by [CONTACT_354180].  We will 
be looking at the long term, (3 year)  outcomes in this cohort as well. However given the 
focus of this study is to identify seve re AKI early in the clinical course and that rates of 
morbidity and mortality  in our ICU - AKI cohort are extremely high, we are not 
sufficiently powered to look at long term outcomes and this aspect of the study is 
somewhat exploratory and will serve as p ilot data for future studies.

 Gender and Minority Inclusions  
AKI affects men and women approximately equally, and there is no known racial 
susceptibility to AKI. Thus, the study is expected to include both male and female 
subjects, and a significant numb er of minority subjects.  
 
F. Human Subjects  
The study aims to enroll [ADDRESS_441142] to gender or racial/ethnical origin. Subjects will be 
initially selected for  the study based upon their medical histories and laboratory studies 
IRB# 10 -503-B  9 
CRSO Version:  16Mar2015  
 
  obtained prior to the study, according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria enumerated in 
Section E of the protocol.  
 
During the subject recruitment, the investigator will explain the  study in detail to the 
patient or their representative (e.g.. power of attorney), and provide a copy of the informed 
consent to the subject for review. If the patient agrees to participate, the IRB approved 
consent form will be signed. Each patient will r eceive a copy of the signed consent form. 
The original consent forms will be stored in the research office at the ICU for record 
review from authorized parties if needed.  
 
When consent is obtained from a legally authorized representative, a subject’s inca pacity to 
consent will first be verified and documented by [CONTACT_253982], one of whom will be 
independent of the study team for patients who are unconscious or have documented 
diagnosis of delirium. In the case of conscious, non -delirious patients, docume ntation of 
incapacity to consent will include evaluation by a psychiatrist or psychologist.   When 
subjects who were decisionally impaired at the time of enrollment are informed of study 
participation the subject will be consented is he/she wishes to contin ue on the study.  The 
PI, research nurse or member of the research team will consent the subject.  
  
 There are no direct benefits for study participation.  
 
G. Risks and Side Effects:  
During this study, patients will be given a single dose of furosemide. F urosemide is a 
diuretic commonly given to patients with AKI. Furosemide has a favorable safety profile. 
The risks of furosemide administration are as follows: hypersensitivity reactions, volume 
depletion, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and ototoxicity. In or der to mitigate any risk 
of hypovolemia, patients will be given isotonic saline milliliter for milliliter after the 
furosemide bolus.     
The patient may be exposed to some risks related to blood drawing. We will collect only 
five  (pre-furosemide, [ADDRESS_441143] two samples 
of urine samples for all patients in the study. Each urine sample will be 50 milliliter (10 
teaspoons of urine over 24 hours). Collection of urine samples does not carry additional 
risks for the patient because all patients will have an indwelling bladder catheter as part of 
their study eligibility.     
  
In addition to specimen samples, clinical and laboratory data will be collected from the 
medical records. . Patients will sign a release of information form at the time of consent 
that will permit the study team to contact  [CONTACT_354184] / all relevant lab 
work collected (comprehensive metabolic panel and any urine studies) – this will be done 
IRB# 10 -503-B  10 
CRSO Version:  16Mar2015  
 
  to allow for determination of post -discharge kidney function to determine if there was any 
loss of kidney function  following the epi[INVESTIGATOR_354172].  All data will be held confidential 
to the investigator in the study. All names and individual identifiers will be separated 
from the collected data. If and when the data is published, it will be presented in an 
anonymous fas hion to avoid any violation of patient’s confidentiality.  
 
Adverse Events  
Adverse Events are negative reactions associated with furosemide not present at baseline: 
hyper -sensitivity reactions (allergic reactions, e.g. rash), dehydration, electrolyte deplet ion 
and tinnitus occurring within [ADDRESS_441144] dose administration. Non -serious AEs will be 
reported at the time of continuing review.  
 
A study -treatment related adverse event  which fits any of the criteria below, is 
considered a serious adverse event (S AE):  
 Results in death  
 Is life -threatening (meaning that the patient was at risk of death at the time of the 
event; this does not refer to an event which might have caused death if it had 
occurred in a more severe form)  
 Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] o r prolongs the existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
 Is a persistent disability/incapacity  
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 Is considered an important medical event by [CONTACT_737] (e.g., surgery, return 
to ICU, emergency procedures, etc.)  
 
SAEs will be repo rted to the IRB within 24 hours of awareness and followed until 
resolved.  
 
H. Benefits:   
There are no direct benefits to the patient in the study.  The patient will receive an 
assessment of renal function that might not otherwise occur but for this study (urine 
sediment, and renal history and physical assessment). The risks for this study are slightly 
more than minimal risk.  
 
I. Multi -Institutional Collaborat ion 
The following sites are conducting this study in parallel, with the University of C hicago as 
the coordinating site:  
 George Washington University (PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_124].  Lakhmir Chawla)  
 University of [LOCATION_004] -San Francisco (PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kathleen D. Liu) 
  
 Each site is responsible for study conduct and monitoring independently.  
 
Samples and dat a from both of all site s will be shared and sent to the University of Chicago . 
 All exchanged samples and data will be de -identified .  We will not send or receive data

  and/or samples until IRB approval has been granted and subcontracts  have been  fully 
executed at respective sites.  
 
J. Outside Consultants/Collaborators  (for future research)    
 Samples of plasma and urine will be stored at UCMC laboratory after initial analysis has 
been completed per protocol and could be shared in the f uture with other researchers after 
they have gained approval by [CONTACT_354185].  These samples will be 
de-identified prior to sharing for the purposes of future research.    
  
K. Costs To Subjects:  
The Section of Nephrology  will pro vide the medicine used in this study free of charge to the 
patient. The patient will not be charged for anything that is part of the study.  
 
L. Conflicts Of Interest:  
 There is no conflict of interest.  
 
M. Confidentiality:  
In addition to specimen samples,  clinical and laboratory data will be collected from the 
medical records .  All data will be held confidential to the investigator in the study. All 
names and individual identifiers will be separated from the collected data.  If and when the 
data is publish ed, it will be presented in an anonymous fashion to avoid any violation of 
patient’s confidentiality.  
 
N. Subject Compensation:                                                                   
There is no compensation for being in the study.  The medicine  and the diagnostic 
evaluation that are part of the study will be conducted at no charge to the subject.  
O. Facilities and Equipment :                                                                              
 All procedures will take place in the UCMC h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].   
 
P. Monitoring Plan:  
 The data collected will be monitored by [CONTACT_978].

  V2.3  24 Apr 2020  
1.0 BACKGROUND  
Severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is an under treated disease state associated with significant morbidity 
and mortality.  Nath and colleagues showed a 1 -year mortality of 33.1% in patients diagnosed with 
severe tricuspid regurgitation1.  In the [LOCATION_002] alone , 1,600,000 patients are diagnosed with severe 
tricuspid regurgitation each year, while only 8,000 (less than 1%) are treated with tricuspid valve 
surgery2.  The reasons for this are varied, however, many of these patients who are not treated go on to 
exhibit signs of central and peripheral venous congestion, including irreversible hepatic cirrhosis and 
chronic kidney disease.  This creates a vicious spi[INVESTIGATOR_23585],  in which those patients who are initially good 
operative candidates may become high risk or inoperable for conventional tricuspid valve surgery.  Additional therapeutic options are therefore needed for these patients and their treating physicians.  
 
Curren tly, there are no specifically designed devices for the transcatheter treatment of tricuspid valve 
disease.  As a result, the treatment of these patients to date has relied on the off -label use of 
transcatheter aortic valve technology.  Multiple case reports have shown the feasibility of percutaneous transcatheter aortic valve impantation  within degenerated tricuspid valve bioprostheses or “valve -in-
valve ” 
3,4.   The experience is less robust for transcatheter tricuspid rep lacement within a native tricuspid 
valve5 and is likely limited in part to the annular dilatation which is present in patients with severe TR6.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_314412], long term data is lacking, and recent reports have demonstrated ea rly valve failure in patients 
using this technique
7. 
 Recently, caval valve implant of the Edwards  Sapi[INVESTIGATOR_314413] n promise as an additional therapy for patients with severe TR who are 
high risk or inoperable.  Placement of a valve in the right atrial (RA)/caval junction would in theory prevent the massive reflux of blood into the IVC, thereby [CONTACT_314461], renal, and lower 
extremity veins from volume overload.  Santhanakrishnan and colleagues evaluated the effects of 
placing a unidirectional valve in the IVC in a bench model simulating a Fontan procedure, in which the SVC and IVC are directly anastomosed to the right and left pulmonary artery in those patients with one 
ventricle.  Although short term effects of this procedure are favorable, long term patients go on to 
develop elevation in the systemic venous pressure from retrograde flow in expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], partic ularly to the 
hepatic veins.  In their study, the authors created a flexible wall model to simulate the IVC/SVC/PA 
connections.  Using a Medtronic melody valve placed in the IVC in a sub -diaphragmatic position, they 
demonstrated a significant decrease in h epatic venous pressure through 20% of the cardiac cycle, with 
minimal gradient across the valve.  They concluded this therapy may have potential for lowering hepatic 
venous pressure by [CONTACT_314462] 
8. 
 
The first in -vivo animal experience of this procedure was by [CONTACT_314463] [ZIP_CODE].  In their 
study, bovine j ugular xenografts were mounted on self- expanding nitinol stents and placed in the IVC of 
5 adult pi[INVESTIGATOR_14107].  Animals were anesthe tized and the diameter and length of the IVC was measured using 
Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS).  After placement of the valve, pres sures were measured proximal and 
distal to assess for any gradients.  IVUS showed partial opening and closing of the valve, with complete closure occurring during deep breaths.  Autopsy showed adequate positioning of the valve stent without any deformation , with the proximal most portion of the valve 2cm proximal to the right atrial junction 
without any deformation of the valved stent.   Sochmann et al performed twin valve caval stenting in a 
series of studies of three sheep and one swine.  In their series,  severe TR and reflux into the SVC and IVC 
was induced through papi[INVESTIGATOR_314414], while the swine served as a control.  Self-
designed stents were placed in the  caval veins through a 12 -French sheath.  5 -French pi[INVESTIGATOR_314415] 
12 
  V2.3  24 Apr 2020 were introd uced into the femoral and jugular veins so that bicaval venography could be performed.  In 
the swine, the valve functioned well for 3 hours without a position change and remained stable on 
necropsy.  In 3 sheep, after placement of the stents, right ventric ular (RV) angiography demonstrated 
retrograde filling of the SVC and IVC to the valves but not beyond10.  At necropsy, the valve position 
remained stable.    
Contemporary animal models have confirmed and expounded on these early results.  Lauten and 
colleagues created acute severe TR in a sheep model via papi[INVESTIGATOR_314416]
11.  
Successful creation of TR was verified by a prominent ventricular (v) wave wh ich was present in the 
central venous pressure tracing.  Self- expanding nitinol stents containing a porcine pulmonary valve 
were placed in the superior vena cava (SVC) and inferior vena cava (IVC).  In both an acute group (n=9) 
and chronic group (n=4), a s ignificant decrease in the v -wave was demonstrated post- implant with an 
accompanying increase in cardiac output.  At autopsy in the chronic group, the stents were covered with 
fibrous tissue and adhered strongly to the vessel wall.  In one animal in the ac ute group, the SVC valve 
embolized into the right atrium with resultant hemodynamic instability.  This did not cause immediate 
death.  Autopsy showed correct device position in all successfully treated animals.   
 The effectiveness of this therapy in animal s has also translated to humans.  In the first -in-man report, a 
79 year old woman with a history of severe TR who was declined for traditional tricuspid valve surgery had been experiencing worsening symptoms of right ventricular (RV) congestion for several years.  After 
institutional review board (IRB) approval the patient underwent the procedure.  Reflux into the caval and hepatic veins were confirmed by [CONTACT_89320].  After careful position guiding by [CONTACT_314464], the valve, a self- mad e nitinol stent frame porcine pericardial valve, was placed in the 
IVC.  Transesophagehal echo (TEE) performed immediately after the procedure and repeated every [ADDRESS_386944] -angiogra m 
confirmed the absence of regurgitation into the IVC.  The patient had clinical improvements in [LOCATION_001] 
Heart Association Functional Class (NYHA), and improvement in both peripheral edema and ascites.  Sadly, 3 months later, the patient was admitted with  an intracranial hemorrhage and expi[INVESTIGATOR_5697].  Autopsy 
revealed stable position of the valve, with fibrous tissue covering the valve helpi[INVESTIGATOR_314417] 
12.  The same authors describe a second case of an 83 year -old woman with severe TR also with 
symptoms of chronic right heart failure.  Caval valve implant was performed as part of a compassionate treatment.  Valves were again individually designed with the upper segment of the IVC valve to lay in the right atrium  above the diaphragm to avoid backflow into the IVC, with a funnel shape to the SVC valve.   
After deployment of both valves, both the IVC and SVC mean pressures decreased with a stable mean 
right atrial (RA) pressure.  Clinical follow up of the patient de monstrated complete resolution of ascites 
and peripheral edema, with normalization of synthetic liver function.  Echo and CT confirmed stable 
valve position without paravalvular regurgitation
13.  In the largest series to date, Laule et al report on 
three patients who underwent caval valve implant for severe TR.  Each of these patients had recurrent 
right heart failure despi[INVESTIGATOR_51495].  2 of these patients underwent stenting to the IVC alone.  These investigators employed a novel technique of pre -stenting the IVC with placement of an 
Edwards -Sapi[INVESTIGATOR_314418] (2 9mm) valve within the stent.  Follow up at 30 -days showed no adverse events 
according to valve academic research consortium criterium (VARC).  In addition, all patients improved by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_386945] 
not clearly excluded TR that can occur with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH.)  As 2/[ADDRESS_386946] degree of TR and indices of right ventricular (RV) function.  Finally, the durability of the procedure b eyond the intermediate term (6 
months) is not well characterized.  To help clarify these issues, we have created the Heterotopic 
Implantation Of the Edwards  Sapi[INVESTIGATOR_109685] 3 Transcatheter Aortic Valve in the Inferior VEna cava for the 
treatment of severe Tricuspid  Regurgitation study.  
 
2.2 Design:  
This is a prospective multi- center, non -blinded (open label), non -randomized safety and feasibility study 
of the heterotopic implantation of the Edwards  Sapi[INVESTIGATOR_109685] [ADDRESS_386947] severe TR and cardiac symptoms of right 
heart congestion in whom conventional tricuspid valve surgery (TVR) would be associated with high risk.  
Severe TR is defined by a vena contracta width > 7mm OR evidence of systolic hepatic vein flow reversal OR visible tricuspid valve coaptation defect + dense/ triangular continuous wave with early peaking as 
assessed by [CONTACT_314465]  a very large central jet or eccentric wall impi[INVESTIGATOR_314419]. 
16.  All patients must be on diuretics with documented evidence of continued 
venous congestion, such as lower extremity or abdominal wall edema.   
 
[ADDRESS_386948] agree that 
based on his assessment the patient is high risk or inoperable for TVR  as per the surgical office note and 
attached (appendix E).    Most inoperable patients have elevated STS risk scores including one  or more 
STS risk elements that exceed thresholds considered safe for operation. A common example is 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_3765], for which the STS risk -scoring threshold usually signals increased risk in operable 
patients, but which may be severe enough in a give n pa tient to explain inoperability.  In trials of TAVR, 
oxygen dependency in particular, has been independently associated with increased one -year mortality  
17.  Other "inoperable" patients, regardless of STS score, are rendered inoperable by [CONTACT_314466] -
morbidities of the low -prevalence, high -heterogeneity variety that are difficult to represent statistically 
and are not part of the STS  risk model. Common examples include liver disease, porcelain aorta, chest 
wall abnormalities, and frailty.  Chest wall abnormalities may include prior chest irradiation, a graft close 
to the sternum, or an absent or reconstructed sternum  18,19.  It must be acknowledged that "inoperable" 
is frequently an integration of multiple dimensions of an individual patient in whom no simple, single -
factor quantifiable line can be drawn between operable and "inoperable."  Factors which make a patient 
high risk or inoperable will be clearly de -lineated in the patient’s surgical evaluation.    The “operable” 
patient will have characteristics which include a normal RVEF, normal creatinine, no previous open heart 
surgeries, preserved left ventricular ejection fraction.  As the STS is undefined for these patients, should a patient have n o other characteristics which make them high risk, an STS score for a simulated mitral 
valve procedure of <[ADDRESS_386949] will be 
referred  to the site heart team.   The goal of the heart team is to optimize patient selection and improve 
procedural success.  Originally intended for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) decision 
making, the concept of the heart team has expanded to involve patients with structural or complex coronary artery disease in whom the participation of multiple physicians from differing areas of 
expertise is beneficial 
[ADDRESS_386950] and cardiac 
surgeon at the core , with other expertise from advanced imaging , cardiac anesthesia, and heart failure 
as important adjuncts.   Patients are seen individually by [CONTACT_13922], or, as part of a dedicated visit to 
multiple specialties in the form of a valve “clinic.”  After patients are evaluated, the members of the 
heart team will discuss the patient’s case at a weekly conference.  Here, a patient’s clinical history and 
clinical data are reviewed, and a group recommendation is made.  If after evaluation by [CONTACT_314467], heart failure specialist, and cardiac surgeo n, as well as presentation at the 
local heart team conference, a patient is deemed a suitable candidate for the trial, they will be 
presented to the executive committee of the trial.   The credentialing of heart team members will be the 
responsibility of th e local heart team site.  
 
2.2.[ADDRESS_386951] scans will be reviewed by [CONTACT_434] ( Henry 
Ford Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) to confirm severe TR and anatomic suitability  for implant.  
 2.2.3  The Executive Committee  
The purpose of presentation of patients to the executive committee is to provide additional consultation 
from experts to further review and approve the selection prior to the patient  being enrolled in the trial .  
The executive team will be comprised of the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_146105].  The presentation will occur in the 
form of a conference call which is open to any member of the individual site s included in the HOVER 
trial.  During the executive committee conference call, the local site will verify that the patient meets the 
15 
  V2.3  24 Apr 2020 inclusion, and is free from ex clusion criteria for the trial.  The local site will present the patient’s case for 
committee review.  Any questions the executive committee may have regarding the c ase will be 
addressed during this call.    If after the case presentation,  2/3 of the executive committee agree the 
patient is suitable for CAVI, the patient will be enrolled in the trial and an implantation date will be set.   
Documentation of approval for the trial of the patient by [CONTACT_314468]’s chart.  If all members of the executive committee are unable to convene on one conference 
call, the case will be presented individually to members of the committee in separate phone calls.  
 
2.2.4  Use of Edwards -Sapi[INVESTIGATOR_314420] -label use of an approved medical device.  The on -label indications are as 
follows:   
 The Edwards SAPI[CONTACT_42377] 3 transcatheter heart valve (THV), model 9600TFX, and accessories are indicated 
for relief of aortic stenosis in patients with symptomatic heart disease due to severe native calcific aortic 
stenosis who are judged by a heart team, includ ing a cardiac surgeon, to be appropriate for the 
transcatheter heart valve replacement therapy.  
 
 2.[ADDRESS_386952] to screen 
approximately 45 patients to enroll up to 15 eligible patients into  this trial.  
 All clinically relevant baseline and follow -up data  will be tabulated. Means  (SDs) , medians  (ranges),  and 
95% confidence intervals will be reported  for continuous variables and frequencies, percentages,  and 
95% confidence intervals  for categorical variables . Specifically, each of t he two primary endpoints (the 
procedural success at 30 -days  and the composite binary  response variable at 6 -months ) will be 
summarized using both a point estimate and its exact confidence interval based on a  binomial 
distribution. Other binary safety and efficacy secondary endpoint s will be analyzed similarly. Continuous  
secondary endpoint s (e.g., hemodynamics data) will be reported using  descriptive summary statistics as 
well as  a point estimate and its confidence interval based on a  normal  distribution  assumption . The 
changes from baseline to each follow -up timepoint will addition ally be evaluated using the McNemar 
matched pairs test for dichotomous variables and the t- test for continuous variables. In the presence of 
distributional non -normality, the Wilcoxon signed rank test will be used instead of the t -test. Data 
transformation s such as log or square -root may also be considered. The analys es of NYHA functional 
classification will involve comparison of the baseline and post -operative (at each timepoint) functional 
class and  determination of  the percentages  of patients improving, not changing, or worsening at each 
postoperative timepoint. The same principle will be appl ied to quality of life score (KCCQ) and 6 -minute 
walk distance.   Although this is an exploratory analysis , we anticipate 50% of patients will demonstrate 
improvement  in one of the three pre -specified components of the primary efficacy outcome.  
 
The time- to-event approach may be considered to analyze some of safety and efficacy  endpoints (e.g., 
time to treatment failure, event -free survival, and overall survival) while  taking censoring into account in 
data analyses. Such endpoints will be summarized using the Kaplan -Meier method . Confidence intervals 
for the median s and survival rates at different time points will be constructed , when  appropriate . For a 
continuous endpo int measured repeatedly over time, a mixed -effects regression model may be 
employed to study its over -time trajectory or change patterns.  All these results  will be reported 
descriptively.  
[ADDRESS_386953] follow -up if no relevant event has occurred 
by [CONTACT_221774]. A secondary analysis that includes only all eligible patients may be conducted in addition to the 
primary analysis described above at the discretion of the trial PI [INVESTIGATOR_314421].  However, such 
analysis may not serve as the basis for drawing conclusions concerning treatment safety or efficacy, and 
the reasons for excluding patients from the analysis should be clearly reported.  
 
All enrolled  patients will be evaluable for adverse ev ents  from the time of their protocol treatment. 
Adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_314469] (CTCAE)  version 4.0.  
 
During the entire study period, adverse events  will be closely m onitored by [CONTACT_314470] [INVESTIGATOR_314422] , working along with the study DSMB . In particular, formal stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_314423] 
6-month  mortality are stipulated in this protocol ( please refer to section 4.1 “Efforts to minimize 
proced ure risks” ).  In addition, i n the event that  other  adverse events  (e.g., surgical complications) are  
thought to be excessive for the study patient population at any point of the trial, the patient accrual to 
the trial will be suspended immediately, pending a review of all adverse events  data. A final decision will 
be made by [CONTACT_28831] [INVESTIGATOR_314424] w hether the trial should be amended, terminated or continue 
accrual. Such decision should be filed with and pre -approved by [CONTACT_314471]. 
  2.4 Study Endpoints:  
The primary safety endpoint  is pr ocedural success at 30 -days.  Procedural success will include : 
• Successful vascular access without unplanned major vascular complication as defined by [CONTACT_44248] -
2, delivery and retrieval of the transcatheter valve delivery system, correct position of both the vascular stent(s) and transcatheter valve in the IVC, a single valve placed within the IVC, and no need for additional surgery or re -intervention (including drainage of pericardial effusion) with 
the patient being alive at 30 -days.  
   
The primary efficacy endpoint  will be improvement in one  of three variables  assessed from baseline to 
6-months .     
• Improvement  of KCCQ score  >15.  This has been shown to correlate with improvement in quality 
of life with heart failure patients
22.   
• Improvement in  6-minute walk test (6MWT)> 70 meters .  This has been show n to provide 
prognostic information in patients with congestive heart failure after an intervention23.   
• Improvement of greater than 6% of peak Vo2 in cardiopulmonary exercise testing .  In a heart 
failure population, this has been shown to help assess prognosis in patients who were instituted 
in an exercise progr am 24.   
 
Secondary endpoints  will be evaluated at several time points  and will be divided into safety and efficacy :  
The first in the acute setting which will be out to 30 days or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_314425]; 
additional time points will be at midterm ([ADDRESS_386954] -procedure) , long term ( [ADDRESS_386955] -procedurally.)   
Secondary safety endpoints  include:  
17 
  V2.3  24 Apr 2020 • All stroke and TIA (VARC -2) 
• Mortality (VARC -2) 
• Myocardial infarction (VARC -2) 
• Acute Kidney Injury (VARC -2) 
• Major Vascular Complication (VARC -2) 
Secondary efficacy endpoints include: 
• Asse ssment of improvement of LE edema by [CONTACT_314472]25.  A 3.1 point improvement 
in this scale was associated with improved quality of life26.   
 
Besides the above formal secondary  endpoints, we will monitor for the following throughout the trial:   
• Deep Vein/IVC thrombosis or pulmonary embolism  
• Improvement in grades of tricuspid regurgitation  as assessed by [CONTACT_6751]   
• Changes in TAPSE by [CONTACT_314473]  
• Pleural effusions    
• Additiona l quality questionnaires to assess for changes in ascites (EORTC QLQ -C30 27 and ESAS -
AM 28).  A 10 -point change in mean score in the QLQ -C30 has been shown to be a meaningful 
response  (O’Connor R. Measuring Quality of Life in Health Churchill Livingstone: Philadelphia; 
2004).  A decrease of 1.25  points  in the ESAS -AM has been shown to correlate with symptom 
improvement after paracentesis28. 
 
3.0 STUDY ENROLLMENT AND WITHDRAWAL 
 3.1. Baseline  
The screening phase of the trial is designed to meet two objectives:  
1. Patient Consent.  
2. Determ ine study patient eligibility and access site for the procedure.  
 3.2. Informed Consent  
Informed Consent will be obtained from all prospective subjects prior to beginning any study activities. All aspects of the  trial including that participation is voluntary, will be explained and the patient will 
have the opportunity to have their questions answered before deciding whether to participate.   Patients 
who agree to participate and sign the informed consent document will be given a copy of their signed 
consent to take home with them.  
 Upon completion of the screening process, the patient’s case will be presented to the site heart team.   If 
after presentation to the site heart team it is agreed by [CONTACT_314474] a suitable cand idate, 
the patient will be presented to the executive committee of the trial.  If after the conference call 2/[ADDRESS_386956] all inclusion criteria,  and be free from all exclusion

4.0 RISK AND BENEFIT ANALYSIS 
 
There are potential risks associated with transcatheter heart valve implantation. There are risks related to the overall procedures (complications associated with standard cardiac catheterization which include bleeding, infectio n, stroke, death, cardiac arrest, pacemaker implantation, allergic reactions, emergency 
open heart surgery, and emergency blood transfusion, prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], renal failure, groin 
lymphocele, limb ischemia, myocardial infarction, injury to adjacent structures including nerves, blood 
vessels, or other structures.)  In addition, there are also risks associated with the valve itself which include valve embolization  and/or migration  and the emergent need for open heart surgery and possibly 
death , as well as valve thrombosis which can lead to death, stroke, pulmonary embolism, or venous 
thrombosis.  Structural valve deterioration may also occur in the form of wear, fracture, calcification, 
leaflet tear/tearing from the stent posts, leaflet retract ion, suture line disruption of components of a 
prosthetic valve, thickening, stenosis.   
 
There are risks associated with stenting of the IVC for valve implantation.  These include migration of the stent and injury to the vessels of the heart or the heart i tself, as well as venous thrombosis and stroke.   
Although these risks are present, the potential of a new therapy which improves the quality of life in those patients who are otherwise ineligible for surgery outweighs these potential risks.  
 Pleural effusions may occur either immediately post- operatively, or at follow up.  It is recommended 
that a trial of diuretic therapy, as well as attempts at diagnosis of the effusion (exudative vs. 
transudative) be attempted if the patient becomes symptomatic.  If diur etic therapy fails, a 
thoracentesis should be considered for symptomatic relief.  If the effusion reoccurs, additional 
thoracenteses may be considered.  Alternatively, the placement of a permanent drainage catheter, or pleuredesis  may be another option in patients with continued fluid accumulation who remain 
symptomatic.  
 4.[ADDRESS_386959] (DSMB)  
A DMSB will be established.  The DSMB is independent from the Sponsor, the investigators, or anyone 
involved in the medical care of the study subjects. Members will not have scientific, financial, or other 
conflict of interest related to the Sponsor or the investigators. The committee will be selected by [CONTACT_314476] [INVESTIGATOR_314427].  
The members must have the following characteristics:  
• working professionally as physicians or statisticians;  
• at least one member with specific  expertise in cardiothoracic surgery clinical trials;  
• no relevant conflicts of interest;  
• they will not be involved in the conduct of this trial in any other capacity, such as principal investigators, sub -principal investigators;  
• they will not be enga ged in any simultaneously occurring competitive trials;  
• they should not be on the NIDPOE or debarred list of investigators.  
Members will not serve on the DSMB, Clinical Event Adjudication Committee (CEC) or Operating Committee of a competing device trial. Members will not have any affiliation with the core laboratories, the data coordinating center, or the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_95917]. The DSMB committee will review all safety data from the HOVER Trial and make recommendations based upon the safety  analyses. The 
frequency of the DSMB meetings will be determined prior to study commencement; however, the DSMB 
may call a meeting at any time if there is reason to suspect safety is an issue. DSMB oversight for this trial is expected to be rigorous with frequent review of all essential safety data. The DSMB chairperson will notify the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_314428]. They will also provide 
confidential recommendations, when necessary, of study termination. All DSMB reports will re main 
strictly confidential, but will be made available to regulatory authorities. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_314429].  
  4.1.3.  Interim Monitoring and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10020] s 
The interim monitoring and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_314430] [ADDRESS_386960] 30% for the high risk patients 
targeted in this clinical trial  
31.   For the purpose of this trial, we will focus on device -related mortality.  
  The interim monitoring will be implemented with stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_314431] 3, 6, and [ADDRESS_386961] been 
enrolled and treated with the protocol device. The proposed stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877] s are:  
Number of patients on 
trial:  When number of 6 -month  
deaths ≥: Probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_314432] 6-month  mortality is 30%:  
3 2 0.216  
6 3 0.105  
9 4 0.064  
15 6 0.064  
 
As it can be seen from the above table, the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_314433] (≤10.5%) assuming the true 6 -month mortality rate is no more than 30% when there are at least 6 patients 
21 
  V2.3  24 Apr 2020 enrolled and treated on the clinical trial. When ther e are only 3 patients enrolled, we are only stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_314434] (or more) out of the first three patients died within 6 months on trial  due to a 
device -related death . This probability is reasonably small as well (21.6%).  
In addition to mortal ity, should valve thrombosis occur in ≥ 30% of patients at 6 -months, the trial will be 
paused to evaluate if any additional precautions are required.  
 
The trial PI ([CONTACT_314506] O’Neill, MD), working along with the study DSMB, will monitor other safety 
parameters such as significant surgery complications, one -year mortality, overall survival, and event -free 
survival at least biannually (every 6 months) as well in an effort to make certain that the patients on trial 
are not inadvertently harmed by [CONTACT_314477].

Procedure Assessments  
The following tests and assessments will be performed on the day of or during the procedure:  
Total procedure time is defined as the time from skin incision to the time of skin incision access closure. The following invasive hemodynamic data must be collected pre and post implant:  
 
• Echo assessments of severity of tricuspid regurgitation and RV function  
• Fluoroscopic imaging of the implanted valve  
• Medications given for cardiovascular effect including anti- platelet/anti- thrombins  
• Event assessment  
 
5.2.1 Placement of percutaneous aortic valve in the inferior vena cava  
 The procedure will be performed in the cath lab/ hybrid Cath Lab/OR under general anesthesia and transesophageal echocardiographic as well as fluoroscopic guidance.  
 Measurements obtained p rior to the procedure  
The diameter of the IVC at the RA/IVC junction will be measured prior to the procedure by [CONTACT_314479].  In order 
to avoid compromise of th e hepatic veins with the valve skirt, distances from the RA/IVC junction to the 
hepatic veins will be measured by [CONTACT_314480].  
 Procedure  
The procedure will be performed through the right or left femoral vein using standard technique.  We will use fluorosc opic and ultrasonographic landmarks to locate the right femoral vein and using a 
micropuncture needle for initial access, and then will place an  8F sheath in the right Common Femoral 
vein. We will than perform a cavogram using a Omniflush catheter.  The Ed wards expandable sheath and 
delivery system will be placed into the right femoral vein.  A 5 -French sheath will be placed in the right 
or left radial femoral artery to monitor arterial pressure and secure arterial access throughout the procedure, and a cat heter may or may not be placed in the right internal jugular vein.  Heparin will be 
administered to achieve an activated clotting time (ACT) between [ADDRESS_386963] technique.  A repeat cavogram with an Omniflush catheter 
will be done to delineate the takeoff of the hepatic veins prior to valve implantation.    When positioning is confirm ed the Edwards or balloon in balloon (BIB) delivery system will be deployed into the 
suprahepatic segment of the IVC by [CONTACT_314481].  Right ventricular (RV) angiography from IJ access and echocardiogram will be performed to confirm intact valve func tion and any evidence of 
regurgitation.  At the end of the procedure, the venous sheath will be removed and perclose devices will 
be deployed or a figure of [ADDRESS_386964] manual pressure.  
 
Anticoagulation Regimen:  
Pre-procedure: Patients in atrial fibrillation on warfarin may be bridged with LMW or UF heparin prior to 
the procedure.  During the procedure: IV heparin will be given to maintain ACT > [ADDRESS_386965]- procedurally.

  V2.3  24 Apr 2020 Recommended Antiplat elet/Anticoagulation Regimen  
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] [ADDRESS_386966] elevated INR at baseline, ASA 81mg will be 
continued and the level of additional anti -coagulation will be decided on a case by [CONTACT_413].  
 Radiation precautions:  
Radiation exposure will be documented at each study visit in the CRF, with options to record whether 
chest x- ray, including additional plain x -rays, CT scans and all fluoroscopy procedures were performed. 
In the ev ent that a dose isn’t recorded; such as a plain X -ray, an average dose will be assigned for each 
applicable test. A trigger will be applied in the database such that when the cumulative estimated 
radiation exposure calculation exceeds 150 to 250 Gy/cm2.  
Additional precautions: for any study patient, the site coordinator and investigator will be notified and a 
follow -up visit advised to assess patient for skin reaction. Substantial radiation dose level (SRDL) -  The 
operator should be notified promptly if SRD L was exceeded. The SRDL is a trigger level to initiate follow -
up of a radiation dose that might produce a clinically relevant injury in an average patient. Some suggested values for the SRDL are a skin dose of 3 Gy, a KAP of 500 Gy/cm2, or an air kerma at  the 
interventional reference point of 5 Gy (NCRP 2010). For cardiology procedures, a level greater than 2Gy will be noted and close follow up will be performed to evaluate for skin toxicity.  
 The operator should write an appropriate note in the patient's medical record, stating that a substantial 
radiation dose has been administered, and indicating the reason. This information may be included in the post procedure notes. Patients with reported KAP between 150 and 250 Gy/cm2 must be further evaluated for radiation injury and the event must be reported as a serious adverse event in the case report form.  
Acute evaluation -  When the SRDL has been exceeded, clinical follow- up essential for early detection 
and management of skin injuries. The patient should be a dvised of the possibility of a skin injury due to 
a tissue reaction, and should be told to examine the beam entrance site at [ADDRESS_386967] should see the patient at an 
office visit, and should arrange for appropriate follow -up care. The physician responsible for the 
patient's care should be informed of the possibility of radiation effects.

  V2.3  24 Apr 2020 7.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
 
7.1  Adverse events:  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical event in a patient and does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the use of the device.   Symptoms or medically significant laboratory or instrumental 
abnormalities of a preexisting disease, such as hypertension or ot her disease, should not be considered 
adverse events but must be documented in the medical history if clinically significant. New symptoms or 
laboratory abnormalities, however, as well as worsening of existing ones, are considered adverse 
events.   Study de vice causality for adverse events will be graded as unlikely, possible or probably.  
 
7.2  Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
• results in death  
• is life -threatening, i.e., an event that, in the v iew of the investigator, places the subject at immediate 
risk of death from the event as it occurred (it does not include an event that could have caused death if it had been more severe)  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_314436]  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, where disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions, either reported or defined as per clinical judgment  
• is a congenital anomaly or birth defect (if exposure to product just before conception or during 
pregnancy resulted in an adverse outcome in the child)  
 All investigators will be responsible for reporting serious adverse events to the sponsor and their reviewing IRBs in accordance with local guidelines. In addition, all SAEs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_314485] (DSMB) in accordance with their charter. (An SAE will be 
reported to the Sponsor and DSMB Chair within 24 hours from when the event was discovered and the 
SAE CRF will be submitted no later than ten (10) days after the SAE was discovered)   Study device 
causality for SAE’s will be graded as unlikely, possible or probably.  
 7.3  Non -Serious Adverse Events  
A non -serious adverse event is any AE that does not meet the criteria listed above for a serious adverse 
event, or the outcome (subject treatment, life- threatening condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], recovery) cannot 
be determined with the information provided. Non -serious AEs will be documented on  the AE log and 
will be reported to IRB per local regulations.  
 7.[ADDRESS_386975] information (refer to IFU and on -label use) .  Unanticipated adverse events are to be 
reported to the study sponsor, each reviewing IRB, and the FDA, no later than ten (10) days after the date the adverse event was discovered. The coordinating center will be responsible for the communication wit h the regulatory bodies.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_386976] information (e.g. Package insert/summary of product characteristics for an approved 
product). This term relates only to the treatment, not the patient’s underlying condition.  
 
30 
  V2.3  24 Apr 2020 7.6  Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects  
Unanticipated adverse device effects (UADE) are defined as any serious adverse effect on health or 
safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, 
problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the 
investigational plan or application (including a supplementary  plan or application), or any other 
unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of 
study patients.  
 
All UADEs must be reported to the FDA immediately upon the Investigator’s awareness of the event. The AE Forms of the CRF must be completed with 7 working days for all UADEs. The Investigator is also responsible for notifying his/her IRB of all UADEs occurring at his/her site no later than [ADDRESS_386977] (and any additional information as required by [CONTACT_177479]/IRB or local regulations). All UADE adverse events must be followed until resolution or until a stable clinical endpoint 
is reached. All required treatments and outcomes of the UADE adverse event must be recorded.  
 
 7.7  Adverse Event Follow -up 
All adverse events occurring within the follow -up period (whether serious, non -serious, unanticipated, 
or anticipated) will be monitored and documented according to the follow -up. To be compliant with 
ethical and regulator y principles, treatment -related SAEs that occur after follow -up is completed 
(outside the protocol) and are assessed by [CONTACT_1694] “unanticipated” must be updated to the FDA via the MAUDE reporting system in accordance with FDA regulations  
  
8.0 DATA MONITORING AND QUALITY CONTROL  
 
8.1 Case Report Forms (CRFs)  
Case report forms (CRFs , see addendum ) will be generated , based on the investigational plan. An 
electronic clinical trial management system (RedCap, Vanderbilt U, TN) will be used to collect all patient 
data during the trial by [CONTACT_314486].  Data will be collected in a paper form  or 
in electronic format  and entered into the electronic clinical trial management  system .  Paper forms will 
be kept in a secure location and only accessible to the data coordinator or investigator.  
 8.2 Data Reporting  
The Investigator or his/her designee is re sponsible for recording all data from the trial onto the CRFs. 
Completed CRFs will be reviewed at regular intervals throughout the trial. To this end, the Investigator 
must permit inspection of the trial paper files and patient CRFs by [CONTACT_314487]/or 
responsible government agencies including the FDA or DMSB.

 Why you are being invited to take part in a research study  
Your tricuspid valve is very leaky. This leakiness is causing symptoms, such as shortness of breath, and swelling in your legs or stomach. This leakiness may be affecting the other organs in your body. If the 
valve is not fixed, you will continue to have these problems.  
 
The current standard treatment is to repair or replace the leaking valve with an artificial val ve using 
open heart surgery. However, you are at a very high risk of experiencing serious complications from this treatment. Because of this, we invite you to take part in a research study investigating a way to replace the function of the tricuspid valve without using open heart surgery. Instead, the valve is replaced 
during a cardiac catheterization where an artificial valve is inserted through a large vein in your body. 
Your old tricuspid valve will not be replaced as is the normal practice with su rgery.  Instead, a valve will 
be inserted into your body which will assist your leaky valve with its function.  The valve used in this 
research study is FDA -approved to replace the aortic valve. It is designed to replace the aortic valve, not 
the tricuspid  valve. It is also designed to be inserted through an artery, not a vein. It is not FDA approved 
to use as a replacement for function of the tricuspid valve. Therefore, use of this valve in this research is experimental and investigational.

  V2.3  24 Apr 2020 Why are we doing this research?  
Blood that flows between different chambers of your heart must flow through a heart valve. These 
valves open up enough so that blood can flow through. They then close, keepi[INVESTIGATOR_314442].  
 The tricuspid valve separates the right lower heart chamber (the right ventricle) from the right upper 
heart chamber ( right atrium).  
 
Tricuspid regurgitation is a disorder in which this valve does not close tightly enough. This problem causes blood to flow backward into the right upper heart chamber (atrium) when the right lower heart chamber (ventricle) contracts.  
  
 
 
The current standard treatment is to repair or replace the leaking valve with an artificial value using 
open heart surgery. However, some patients are too sick to undergo surgery.  

42 
  V2.3  24 Apr 2020  
A few  years ago , the FDA approved a new method to treat seriously diseased aortic valves. This 
procedure repairs the aortic valve without removing the old, damaged valve. Instead, it wedges a replacement valve into the aortic valve’s place. The procedure is called a transcatheter aortic valve 
replacement (TAVR) or transcatheter a ortic valve implantation (TAVI).  
 
Transcatheter aortic valve replacement involves threading a catheter through an artery into the heart 
and then threading a collapsed replacement valve to the valve site through a catheter. Once the new 
valve is expanded, i t pushes the old valve out of the way and the replacement valve takes over the job of 
regulating blood flow.  
 The Edwards SAPI[CONTACT_42377] 3
TM (S3) Transcatheter Heart Valve are valves that are FDA- approved for 
transcatheter aortic valve replacement. The Edwards SAP IEN 3TM Transcatheter  Heart Valve is not FDA 
approved to surgically implant to replace the function of the tricuspid valve.  Therefore, use of the The 
Edwards SAPI[CONTACT_42377] 3TM Transcatheter Heart Valve in this research is experimental and investigational.  
 The p urpose of this research is to try using the The Edwards SAPI[CONTACT_42377] [ADDRESS_386996] the valve at the junction of the inferior vena cava (large vein that drains the lower body) and the heart to prevent blood from the heart from flowing backwards to the lower body. This research will be the first time the safety and effectiveness of using the The Edwards SAPI[CONTACT_42377] 3
TM Transcatheter Heart Valve as a replacement for the function of the 
tricuspid valve is tested in humans as part of a clinical trial.  
    
 
     
 
There is very limited experience with surgically implanting the The Edwards SAPI[CONTACT_42377] 3
TM (S3) 
Transcatheter Heart Valve to replace the function of the tricuspid  valve with fewer than thirty  patients 
reported in the literature. The research team at the lead investigative site has used this valve to replace 
the aortic valve. However, before starting this research study , Dr. O’Neill, who is also the lead principal 
investigator, has performed research into the field of transcatheter valve replacement.  In preparation 
for this research protocol, Dr. O’Neill performed extensive research into the field including a review of all the literature available.  He has spoken with physicians who are performing this procedure in 
[LOCATION_013], and also participated in the first procedure which was performed in the [LOCATION_002].  Dr. O’Neill has worked closely with your doctors  participating  in this study along with an  excellent team of 
cardiothoracic surgeons who have performed hundreds of tricuspid valve replacements over the years, and who will be involved in all parts of your workup and procedure.

• if it is in your best int erest;  
• If you do not consent to continue in the study after being told of changes in the research that may affect you.  
 What happens if I say yes, I want to be in this research?  
If you choose to be included in the study, you will have the following studies  performed if they have not 
already been done as part of your regular clinical care, to determine if you would meet the criteria for

• Finally, you will have doctors’ visits during enrollment with a heart failure specialist, an 
interventional cardiologist, and a cardiothoracic surgeon. You will see some, if not all of these 
doctors at subsequent follow up visits.  
• During the procedure you will be put to sleep by [CONTACT_314494]. You will also be given heparin which is a 
medication that will thin your blood during the procedure.  
• A metal stent will be placed in the vein leading to your heart which will allow the heart valve to remain implant ed. After the procedure you will remain in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_314443].  
• After you leave the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_314444] 30 -days, 6 months, 1 -year, and then annually up 
to 5 years. I f you are not feeling well you may be seen on a more frequent basis by [CONTACT_314495].  
• These doctor visits should only take up to 1 hour based on how you are feeling.  
• A total of up to 50mL of blood will be drawn fr om you at your follow up visits, but most likely 
less than this.  
• At your visits you will speak with the members of the study team and research coo rdina tor. 
• It is important to understand that although studies have shown this is a safe procedure to perform in humans, it has not been studied extensively in a large trial which is why at this time the procedure is experimental. The valve which will be im planted has been studied in large scale 
clinical trials which have proved it is safe, although it has not been implanted in the position in which we plan for you.  
• After the invasive procedure  is performed there are no additional invasive planned procedures 
as part of the study protocol. You will undergo routine lab testing and ultrasound as part of the 
protoco l. However, if any additional invasive procedures are required, they will be explained to 
you and your consent for them will be obtained on a different form.  
• As there currently are no long term studies to tell us how you will improve with this procedure, 
as well as how the valve will function in the part of your body in which it will be placed, we will 
45 
  V2.3  24 Apr 2020 be performing laboratory testing, ultrasound, and q uestionnaires to see how you are feeling, to 
see how your body responds to the valve, and to ensure the va lve functions properly in its 
position.  
• If you choose not to be included in the procedure, you will continue to have follow up 
appointments with your doctors which will likely include blood testing and ultrasound, although 
this will be decided between you and your doctor.  
 Once you decide to participate in this trial, and if you qualify, you will be treated with the valve. If there are any unexpected findings from this procedure, for example a change in the way the valve functions, you will be notified in a timely manner and counseled regarding any additional procedures which may or 
may not need to be performed.  
 
What are my responsibilities if I take part in this research?  
If you take part in this research:  
1. You will need to follow up with the study doctors as outlined in the consent form.  
2. You will need to agree to have the follow up blood testing and other follow up testing 
performed.  
3. You will need to notify your study doctors if there is a change in how you feel to determine if this is due to the pl acement of the valve.    
4. You will need to notify the doctors if you are admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_179881].  
 This valve can form blood clots that can lead to serious life -threatening side effects. During the 
procedure you will be given drugs that will stop your blood from clotting. After the procedure you will 
need to take medicine to prevent blood clots for the rest of your life.  
 If you expi[INVESTIGATOR_314445], your family/next -of-kin will be asked to allow an autopsy.  
 
What happens if I say no, I do not want to be in this research?  
You may decide not to take part in the research and it will not be he ld against you. It will in no way 
affect your relationship with the study doctor. Instead of being in this research study, your choices may 
include: The continuation of your medicines for your condition, finding a surgeon who would agree to valve surgery and re -consideration of valve surgery if your condition should improve in the future.  
 
What happens if I say yes, but I change my mind later?  
If you agree to take part in the research now and if you decide to  stop at any time, it will not be held 
against yo u. Again, it will in no way affect your relationship with the study doctor.  
 
If you decide to leave the research, then you may not undergo the recommended follow up to make 
sure that your body is functioning properly with the device in place. In addition, any changes in the valve 
that may affect your health may not be noticed.  
 If you decide to leave the research, contact [CONTACT_314496].  
 
If you stop being in the research, already collected data may not be removed from the study database. You will be asked whether the investigator can collect data from your routine medical care. If you agree, this data will be handled the sa me as research data.  
 
[ADDRESS_387002] being in this study could be bad for me?  
We have limited knowledge about the risks of using the SAPI[CONTACT_42377] [ADDRESS_387003], pacemaker implantation, allergic reactions, emergency open heart surgery,  
emergency blood transfusion, prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], rena l failure, groin lymphocele, limb ischemia, 
myocardial infarction, and injury to adjacent structures including nerves, blood vessels, or other 
structures.  
 
Pleural effusions ( excess fluid that accumulates in the space that surrounds the lungs ) may occur ei ther 
immediately post -operatively, or at follow up.  
 
There are risks associated with stenting of the vessel for valve implantation. These include migration of 
the stent and injury to the vessels of the heart or the heart itself, as well as venous thrombosi s and 
stroke.  
 
You may need surgery to remove the valve.  
 Although it is impossible to predict which, if any, of the above risks may occur with your procedure, based on our experience of using the Edwards  SAPI[CONTACT_42377] [ADDRESS_387004] estimated as follows:  
 Occasional:  Bleeding, infection, pacemaker implantation, allergic reactions, prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], 
renal failure  
 Rare: Emergency blood transfusion, groin lymphocele, limb  ischemia, myocardial infarction, injury to 
adjacent structures including nerves, blood vessels, stroke, death, cardiac arrest, emergency open heart surgery . 
   
The risks of using the Edwards  SAPI[CONTACT_42377] [ADDRESS_387005] will be explained to you . . The risks may include but are not limited t o: 
bleeding, infection, stroke, death, cardiac arrest, pacemaker implantation, allergic reactions, emergency 
open heart surgery, emergency blood transfusion, prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], renal failure, groin 
47 
  V2.3  24 Apr 2020 lymphocele, limb ischemia, myocardial infarction, in jury to adjacent structures including nerves, blood 
vessels, or other structures.  
 
In addition to the risks which may occur during the procedure, the following risks may be encountered 
during your workup for the procedure.  
 
• CT scan : There is a small risk you may have an allergic reaction with the contrast which is given 
to you during this test. This reaction can be very serious in some cases and cause death. In 
addition, there is also a risk that the contrast given to you may cause problems to your kidneys and you may require dialysis.  
• Cardiopulmonary exercise stress test : You will be monitored closely during this procedure. 
However, in rare circumstances you may suffer abnormal beating of the heart which may 
threaten your life and cau se death or permanent disability.  
• Echocardiogram : In certain circumstances, a contrast agent may be required to evaluate your 
heart function. In rare circumstances, yo u may develop an allergic reaction to this contrast 
which could cause death or perma nent disability.  
• Right and left heart catheterization : You may experience bleeding, infection, stroke, death, 
cardiac arrest, pacemaker implantation, allergic reactions, emergency open heart surgery,  
emergency blood transfusion, prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], renal failure, groin lymphocele, limb 
ischemia, myocardial infarction, and injury to adjacent structures including nerves, blood 
vessels, or other structures.  
 
Although it is impossible to predict which, if any, of the aforementioned risks may occur with your procedure, the likelihood of each of these risks can be best estimated as follows.  
 Being a part of this study while pregnant may expose the unborn child to significant risks as you will be 
exposed to radiation during the initial procedure, CT scan of the ch est and body and chest x -ray. If you 
are a woman capable of having children, you must use a medically acceptable form of birth control. 
Medically acceptable contraceptives include: surgical sterilization (such as a tubal ligation or 
hysterectomy), approved  hormonal contraceptives (such as birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], patches, implants or 
injections), barrier methods (such as a condom or diaphragm) used with a spermicide, or an intrauterine 
device (IUD). Contraceptive measures such as Plan B sold for emergency use after unprotected sex is not 
an acceptable method for routine use. If you do become pregnant or have unprotected sex any time 
after signing the consent form, you must notify the study physician immediately.  
 If you take part in this research, you will be ex posed to radiation from fluoroscopy needed for the 
implantation of the experimental Edwards  SAPI[CONTACT_42377] [ADDRESS_387006] received or will receive from other tests or treatments.  The additional radiation exposure is a minimal risk except for the 
fluoroscopy guidance placement where skin injury could result.

I. Study Information 
 
Protocol Title:  Heterotopic Implantation Of the Edwards -Sapi[INVESTIGATOR_109685]  3 Transcatheter 
Aortic Valve in the Inferior Vena cava for the treatment of severe 
tricuspid Regurgitation  
IRB Number:   
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_6085] O’Neill, MD  
 
 II. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
 
Inclusion Criteria  
(From IRB -approved protocol)  Yes No Supporting 
Documentation * 
1. Patients must be at least [ADDRESS_387009] severe, 
symptomatic (ACC/AHA Stage D symptoms) tricuspid regurgitation (TR) 
as assessed by 2D echocardiogram with 
evidence of peripheral and central venous congestion (specifically lower extremity edema and abdominal 
ascites requiring  diuretics.)            
3. The patient must be evaluated by a 
“heart team” of physicians including an interventional cardiologist, cardiothoracic surgeon, heart failure 
specialist, and imaging specialist, and 
presented for review at a local multi -
disciplinary conference.  By [CONTACT_314499], 
the heart team must agree (and verify in the case review process) that valve implantation will likely benefit the 
patient.          
[ADDRESS_387010] agree that 
medical factors preclude operation, 
based on a conclusion that the probability of death or serious, 
irreversible morbidity exceeds the 
probability of meaningful 
improvement.  Also, other factors 
which may increase the patients perceived surgical risk for inclusion in the trial will be clearly delineated if 
they are present.  These include, but 
are not limited to the following as defined by [CONTACT_44248] 2:  Frailty, Hostile chest, porcelain aorta, IMA or other critical conduit crossing the midline or adherent to the posterior table of 
sternum, severe right ventricular (RV) 
dysfunction.  The surgeons' 
consultation notes shall specify the medical or anatomic factors leading to that conclusion.  At least one of the cardiac surgeon assessors must have 
interviewed and examined the patient.          
  
 
5. The study patient provides informed 
consent and agrees to comply with all required post -procedure follow -up 
visits, including annual visits up to 5  
years          
Exclusion Criteria  
(From IRB -approved protocol)   
1. Heart Team assessment of operability 
(the heart team considers the patient 
to be a good surgical candidate)          
2. Evidence of an acute myocardial 
infarction ≤ 1 month (30 days) before the intended treatment [defined as: Q wave MI, or non -Q wave MI with total 
CK elevation of CK- MB ≥ twice normal 
in the presence of MB elevation and/or 
troponin level elevation (WHO 
definition)]          
3. Untreated, severe, left sided valvular 
heart disease including mitral 
regurgitation or stenosis, and aortic 
regurgitation or stenosis          
69 
  V2.3  24 Apr 2020 4. Mean pulmonary artery pressures 
≥40m mHG and PVR >4 woods units as 
assessed by [CONTACT_314475]               
5. Any therapeutic invasive cardiac 
procedure resulting in a permanent 
implant that is performed within 30 days of the index procedure.  Examples 
of permanent implant would include 
any new heart valve.  Implantation of a 
permanent pacemaker is excluded.          
6. Patients with planned concomitant 
surgical or transcatheter ablation for 
Atrial Fibrillation          
7. Leukopenia (WBC < 3000 cell/mL), 
acute anemia (Hgb < 9 g/dL), Thrombocytopenia (Plt < 50,000 
cell/mL)          
8. Hemodynamic or respi[INVESTIGATOR_314452], mechanical ventilation or mechanical heart assistance within 30 days of screening 
evaluation               
9. Need for emergency surgery for any 
reason     
10. Left ventricular ejection fraction <40%     
11. Echocardiographic evidence of intra-
cardiac mass, thrombus or vegetation     
12. Active upper GI bleeding within 3 
months (90 days) prior to procedure     
13. A known contraindication or 
hypersensitivity to all anticoagulation regimens, or inability to be 
anticoagulated for the study procedure     
14. Recent CVA clinically confirmed (by 
[CONTACT_34358]) or neuroimaging confirmed stroke or transient ischemic 
attack (TIA) within 6 months (180 days) 
of the procedure     
15. Estimated life expect ancy < 1 year

  V2.3  24 Apr 2020 16. Expectation that patient will not 
improve despi[INVESTIGATOR_314453]     
17. Currently participating in another 
investigational cardiac device study or 
any other clinical trial, including drugs 
or biologics. Note: Trials requiring 
extended follow- up for products that 
were investi gational, but have since 
become commercially available, are not 
considered investigational trials     
18. Active bacterial endocarditis within 6 
months (180 days) of procedure     
19. Patients with signs or symptoms of SVC 
syndrome, or hepatic cirrhosis not felt 
due to passive congestion from TR

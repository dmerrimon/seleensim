5. LAY LANGUAGE SUMMARY OR SYNOPSIS (no more than one paragraph)  
Following painful surgical procedures  of the breast , postoperative analgesia is often provided with a 
paravertebral nerve block  (PVB) .  For intense, but shorter -duration acute pain, a single -injection of 
local anesthetic is used with a duration of approximately 12 hours.  Recently an alternative  block has 
been reported:  the serratus  plane block.[ADDRESS_746548] superficial to the PVB and therefore easier to identify and target with ultrasound  
(therefore increasing success rate) ; and an increased  safety margin  as there are few er anatomic 
structures in the immediate area which could be injured with the needle; and, the target plane is 
much further from the intrathecal/epi[INVESTIGATOR_569394] , therefore leakage of 
cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_381256] i njury to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_569395] .[ADDRESS_746549] versus paravertebral blocks  for single -injection local anesthetic administration . 
 
Hypothesis 1 :  Following breast surgery, analgesia  will be non -inferior in the recovery room  with a 
serratus  plane block  compared with a paravertebral block  as measured with th e Numeric Rating 
Scale . 
 
Hypothesis 2 :  For breast surgery, opi[INVESTIGATOR_569396] -inferior in the operating and 
recovery room s with a serratus  plane block compared with a paravertebral block (primary:  
cumulative intravenous morphine equivalents ).

Page 2 paravertebral nerve block  (PVB) .  For intense, but shorter -duration acute pain, a single -injection of 
local anesthetic is used with a duration of approximately 12 hours.   The PVB has several limitations:  
it can decrease blood pressure, and very rare —but serious —complications have occurred, including 
neuraxial injection, neuraxial hematoma, and pleural puncture.1  An alternative block has been 
described :  the serratus  plane block.[ADDRESS_746551] superficial to the PVB and therefore easier to identify and target with ultrasound (therefore 
increasing success rate); and an increased safety margin:  there are few anatomic structures in the 
immediate area which could be injured with the needle; and, the target plane is much further from the 
intrathecal/epi[INVESTIGATOR_569394].  Lastly, the plane may be easier to catheterize for 
continuous peripheral nerve blocks relative to the relatively -small volume PVB.[ADDRESS_746552] the 
decision between which anatomic block location determined randomly, as opposed to the physician 
simply choosing him/herself.  
 
Enrollment.  Consenting adults undergoing breast surgery with a planned single -injection regional 
analgesic  will be offered enrollment.  Patient s undergoing breast surgery with a planned perineural 
catheter r egional analgesic will be exclud ed.  Study inclusion will be proposed to eligible patients 
prior to surgery.  If a patient desires study participation, written, informed consent will be obtaine d 
using a current UCSD IRB -approved ICF.  Selection for inclusion will not be based on gender, race, 
or socioeconomic status.  The study population of interest includes men and women of all races and 
socioeconomic status.  Inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in section #[ADDRESS_746553] baseline 
anthropomorphic information ( e.g., age, sex, height, and weight).  All subjects will have a peripheral 
intravenous (IV) catheter insert ed, standard noninvasive monitors applied, supplemental oxygen 
administered via a nasal cannula or face mask, and placed  in the sitting position .  Midazolam and 
fentanyl (IV) will be titrated for patient comfort, while ensuring that patients remain respons ive to 
verbal cues.  Both possible block locations will be viewed with ultrasound.  If one or both of the 
locations is unacceptable for block placement in the clinician’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the subject will not be 
randomized and will not proceed further with the stu dy. 
 
Subjects will then be randomized using a computer -generated list and opaque, sealed envelopes to

Page 3 one of two treatment groups: (blocks of 4, stratified for unilateral vs. bilateral surgery): (1) serratus  
plane or (2) paravertebral block.  All blocks will be placed by a regional anesthesia fellow or resident 
under the direct supervision and guidance of a regional anesthesia attending (or by [CONTACT_569405] ). 
 
The area of needle insertion will be c leaned with chlorhexidine gluconate and isopropyl alcohol .  All 
blocks will be placed using standard UCSD ultrasound -guided techniques as previously described.2,3 
 
Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.5% (20 mL for unilateral surgery; 16 mL each side for bilateral surgery)  will be 
administered via the needle into the target plane (s).  For PVBs without axillary involvement, this will 
be at the T3 and T5 levels.  For PVBs with axillary involvement, this will be at the T2 and T4 levels.  
For unilateral PVBs, [ADDRESS_746554] experiences 
decreased sensation to cold temperat ure with an alcohol pad over the approximate level of the 
ipsilateral 4th thoracic dermatome.  Misplaced blocks will be replaced successfully, or the patient 
excluded from further study participation.  For subjects undergoing bilateral surgical procedures,  a 
block using the same protocol will be administered on the contralateral side.  
 
Intraoperatively, all subjects will receive a general anesthetic using inhaled and intravenous 
anesthetic and oxygen.  Intravenous fentanyl will be administered for cardiovascular responsiveness 
to noxious stimuli at the discretion of the anesthesia provider.  
 
Postop:  Subjects will be discharged with a prescription for oxycodone [ADDRESS_746555] opi[INVESTIGATOR_569397] . 
 
Outcome measurements (end points).   Pain scores  will be recorded using the NRS .  Within the 
recovery room, pain scores, opi[INVESTIGATOR_4965], and antieme tic administration will be recorded  by 
[CONTACT_569406] .  The morning following surgery, all subjects will be 
contact[CONTACT_569407] [ if hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]] to record lowest, average, highest, and current pain 
scores ; sleep disturbances , and nausea using a 0 -10 Likert scale (0 = no nausea; 10 = vomiting) .  
For outpatients, opi[INVESTIGATOR_569398].  In addition, we will extract antiemetic use  from the 
electronic record .  We will collect the time s at which subjects felt their block resolve and they 
consumed their first opi[INVESTIGATOR_569399].

Statistical methods.  Descriptive statistics will be provided by [CONTACT_569408]. Baseline 
characteristics of arms will be compared using the Wilcoxon -Mann -Whitney and Fisher’s Exact tests. 
Key characteristics that are significantly different (p<0.05) will be included as covariates in the 
analysis models.  
 
Primary aim.  We will test the noninferiority of the serratus  nerve block compared to the 
paravertebral nerve block.  The 95% confidence interval (CI) associated with the Wilcoxon -Mann -
Whitney test will be derived for the group difference (paravertebral minus serratus ) in median pain 
scores  within the recovery room . If the lower limit of the 95% CI is greater than -1.25, we will 
conclude noninferiority.   If there are significant differences between the groups in any key 
characteristics, these characteristics will be included as covariates in  a linear model. The same 
noninferiority margin ( -1.25) will be applied to the 95% CI for the covariate adjusted group difference 
in mean pain derived from the linear model.  
 
The noninferiority of the serratus  nerve block with regard to total opi[INVESTIGATOR_569400], i.e. comparing the limits of 
a 95% CI associated with the Wilcoxon -Mann -Whitney test to a predefined noninferiority margin (in 
this case 2 mg). Covariate adjusted line ar models will again be applied in the event that key 
characteristics are significantly different between the groups.  
 
Sample size justification.    Power for the Wilcoxon -Mann -Whitney derived noninferiority testing is 
based on 10,000 simulated trials. We simulated pain scores from a discrete distribution with median 
(interquartile range) 3 (2-5).5  Between the quartiles, the probability of each score was assumed 
constant.  The distribution for each group was assumed to be the same.  The sample size of n= 50 
per group provides 8 2% power to detect noninferiority in pain  with a margin of 1.[ADDRESS_746557] 
deviation 2 mg, and minimum value 0 mg.  The sample size of n = [ADDRESS_746558] 
95% power to detect noninferiority with margin [ADDRESS_746559], and if significant, noninferiority in opi[INVESTIGATOR_569401].  Under this 
hierarchical testing framework, no adjustment in alpha is necessary to control Type 1 error.6 
 
 
10. HUMAN SUBJECTS  
Inclusion criteria  for the trial will be:  (1) undergoing unilateral or bilateral breast surgery with at 
least moderate postoperative pain anticipated ; (2) analgesic plan includes a single -injection 
peripheral  nerve block(s); and (3)  age 18 years or older.  
 
Exclusion criteria for the trial will be:  (1) morbid obesity as defined by a body mass index > 40 
(BMI=weight in kg / [height in meters]2); (2) renal insufficiency (preoperative creatinine > 1.5 mg/dL); 
(3) chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (daily use within the 2 weeks prior to surgery and duration of use > 4 weeks); 
(4) history of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2554]; (5) any comorbidity which results in moderate or severe function al 
limitation ; (6) inability to communicate with the investigators or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33717]; (7) pregnancy; (8) 
planned regional analgesic with perineural catheter placement; and ( 9) incarceration.  We will recruit 
a maximum of [ADDRESS_746560] prior to surgery —
regardless of study participation.  Pregnant patients will be excluded from study participation.  
 
12. INFORMED CONSENT  
If a patient desires study participation, written, informed consent will be obtained.  An investigator or 
research assistant/coordinator (including regional anesthesia fellows) specifically trained in both 
study details and appropriate consenting procedures will attain verbal and written informed subject 
consent.  The method of documenting consent will be using written informed consent form (including 
a written HIPAA consent form and UCSD Experimental Subjects’ Bill of Rights ).  Due to the fact that 
nearly all qualifying patients will be relatively healthy and all will be undergoing relatively minor 
ambulatory surgical procedures, the overwhelming majority will not be seen in preoperative clinic on 
a day prior to the day of su rgery.  Therefore, the study will be proposed the day of surgery in the 
preoperative area of the outpatient center (KOP) after  patients present for their procedure.   Patients 
will not be rushed into making a decision regarding the study, and this is possib le since (a) patients 
are brought to the center with far more time than necessary to ensure no surgical delays and (b) this 
is a relatively simple, straight -forward study with no medical/health risks and therefore should not be 
a particular burden on prosp ective subjects.  
 
Following informed consent and the signing of the UCSD IRB -approved ICF and HIPAA documents, 
these documents will be copi[INVESTIGATOR_569402]’s medical record.  The subject will 
be provide a copy along with the Subjects’ Bill of Rights.  
 
13. ALTERNATIVES TO STUDY PARTICIPATION  
If a patient declines enrollment, they will receive their perioperative analgesic with the choice of which 
anatomic location to use ( serratus  plane or paravertebral block) determined by [CONTACT_569409].  
 
14. POTENTIAL RISKS  
The risks for both block locations include bleeding, infection, damage to nerves, inadequate  pain 
relief, an d injection into nearby [CONTACT_569410], near or into spi[INVESTIGATOR_158470], and the 
lining of the lung.  Currently, it remains unknown whether or not there are relative ly higher risks with 
one anatomic location  over the other.   Given the proximity to the paravertebral, neuraxial, and pleural 
spaces, the risks of serratus  plane blocks are felt to be similar.  However, due to the increased 
distance between the serratus  plane and the pleura and neuraxis, these risks are thought to b e 
decreased  with an improved safety margin .  Although this speculation is  hypothetical as no large 
series of ultrasound -guided serratus plane blocks have been published , there is the possibility that a 
patient’s risk might be affected by [CONTACT_569411] n if the attending physician would have chosen 
one of the two possible blocks, while the randomization indicates the other be used .  There is , 
however,  the risk of loss of confidentiality  with study participation.  
 
15. RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES AND ADEQUACY OF RESOURCES

radiography and subsequent interventions (such as tube thoracostomy) will be guided by [CONTACT_569412] .  Inadvertent intravascular injection will 
be managed according to the degree of cardiovasc ular compromise with intralipid readil y available 
during all blocks.  Bleeding, neurologic, and infectious complications will be managed according to 
the degree of neurologic sequelae in consultation with surgery. Horner’s syndrome will be managed 
expectan tly as it recedes with the resolution of the block.  
 
The following study procedures will be done to maintain confidentiality of this study: hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_86650] a locked medical office and the patients’ own medical charts.  Any digitized records wil l be 
stored in encrypted files on password -protected computers.  
 
16. PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY CONSIDERATIONS INCLUDING DATA ACCESS AND MANAGEMENT  
Following study participation, all hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_569403] -page CRF  will be kept in a locked 
office.  Digitized records will be de -identified using subjects’ randomization numbers —only the single -
page hardcopy CRF will contain identifiable personal health information  as well as the randomization 
number .  As such, subject research records will only be identified by a study n umber.  
 
Prospective subjects will be approached in their own “cubical” in the preoperative area prior to 
surgery —these have 3 solid walls and a curtain to provide privacy to patients waiting for surgery.  
With the curtain closed, the study will be describe d to the patient who will be provided with an 
informed consent and HIPAA form to review, subsequently having all questions and concerns 
addressed.  
 
17. POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
There are no known immediate medical benefits to study participation for the individual.  However, 
future patients may benefit if we determine that one anatomic location  provides greater relative 
benefits or fewer relative risks .  In addition, current subj ects may themselves benefit if they require 
future surgery and a postoperative analgesic . 
 
18. RISK/BENEFIT RATIO  
There is no known direct benefit to the subjects.  
 
19. EXPENSE TO PARTICIPANT  
None .  
 
20. COMPENSATION FOR PARTICIPATION  
None.

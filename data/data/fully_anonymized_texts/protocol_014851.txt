1.0  Background 
 
 Recurrent glioblastoma remains a problem despi[INVESTIGATOR_658425];  glioblastoma continues to portend a dismal prognosis . In modern 
 trials, median progression -free sur vival remains short at around 7 months, with nearly all 
 patients experiencing tumor progression by 36 months. [1, 2]  
1.1 Many recurrences occur outside the high -dose radiotherapy v olume : 
The current standard for tumor delineation includes T1 contrast -enhanced and T2 FLAIR 
MRI. It is well established that high -grade gliomas infiltrate into peritumoral edema. [3] 
In a major prospective trial from the European Organization  for Research and Treatment 
of Cancer (EORTC), the clinical target volume (CTV) included any residual tumor and 
resection cavity plus 2 -cm ma rgins. [1] Current Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 
(RTOG) protocols include the addition of postoperative edema plus 2 -cm margins for 
CTV.[ 4] With  these volumes, at least 75% of recurrences occur within the 95% isodose 
line of the 60 Gy volume. [5, 6] In add ition, up to 20% of failures  are located completely 
outside of the 95% isodose line. [6]   
1.2 18F-DOPA -PET offers better localization of primary tumor than MRI alone : 
While it is well established that regions of contrast enhancement and edema are likely 
to contain tumor, it is thought that infiltration of tumor may additionally occur along neuronal tracts. [7] Given that up to 20% of patients may experience progression outside 
the aforementioned MRI changes, a need exists to develop a complementary imaging 
modality. While standard 18 -fluoro -deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (
18F-
FDG -PET) is generally insufficient in visualizing brain tumors, a mino acid PET tracers, 
such as 3,4 -dihydroxy -6-[18F] fluoro -L-phenylalanine (18F-DOPA) offer several 
advanta ges.[8]  18F-DOPA -PET shows  high uptake in tumor tissue and low uptake in 
normal tissue.  Unlike contrast enhancement, 18F-DOPA -PET crosses the intact blood 
brain barrier freely via an amino acid transporter. [9] In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_658426], 
increased 18F-DOPA -PET uptake was seen in [ADDRESS_888041] enhancement was only present in 6 of the 16 specimens. [10] With this 
knowledge, Mayo Clinic is currently enrolling patients with newly -diagnosed high -grade 
gliomas in a radiotherapy trial where dose -escalation is planned for regions of high 18F-
FDOPA uptake.  
1.3 Pseudoprogression can be difficult t o differentiate from true tumor progression :  
Following treatment with radiotherapy, inflammatory changes are often seen on MRI. 
Thus, strict criteria are used to categorize the nature of the tumor’s response. The 
historical standard criteria were publishe d by [CONTACT_658440]. and required >=25% 
increase in the sum of the products of perpendicular diameters of enhancing lesions, 
any new lesion, or clinical deterioration in order to declare progression. [11] These 
 [ADDRESS_888042] enhancement may be caused by 
[CONTACT_658441], anti- angiogenic agents and radiation 
necrosis. [12]  Pseudoprogression, defined as an increase in contrast enhancement that 
subsides without anti -neoplastic therapy, is  common after standard treatment with 
radiotherapy and temozolomide. [13] This process is thought to be driven by [CONTACT_54615] -
induced increased  permeability of the blood brain barrier. Because pseudoprogression 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_40645] 12 weeks of radiotherapy inside the high -dose region, the 
updated Response Assessment in Neuro -Oncology (RANO) criteria require new 
enhancement outside the 80% isodose line or  viable tu mor on histopathologic sampling 
for progression to be declared less than 12 weeks after radiotherapy. [14]  These criteria 
help differentiate pseudoprogression from true progression, though challenges in 
interpreting changes in imaging after 12 weeks still remain.   
 
1.4 Bevacizumab produces a moderately high response rate in gl ioblastoma :  
 
While angiogenesis is common among a spectrum of tumors, it is particularly frequent  
in glioblastoma. Commonly, the tumor parenchyma produces vascular endothelial 
growth factor A (VEGF -A), which in turn up -regulates the VEGF pathway. [4] 
Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody with activity against the VEGF -A 
ligand, which in turn reduces VEGF pathway up -regulation. [15] A randomized study 
comparing bevacizumab with or without irinotecan in patients with recurre nt 
glioblastoma demons trated moderately high response rates in the 30 -35% range as 
determined by [CONTACT_9268]. [16] A sin gle-arm phase II study treating recurrent glioblastoma with 
bevacizumab followed by [CONTACT_658442] a response rate of 35% as defined by [CONTACT_212567]. [17] These trials led 
to FDA approval for bevacizumab use in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma. This 
led to RTOG 0825, a randomized placebo -controlled trial comparing standard 
radiotherapy and temozolomide with or without adjuvant bevacizumab. This study revealed an improvement in progression -free survival but not overall survival. [4] A 
subsequent study compared concurrent radiotherapy, temoz olomide and bevacizumab 
to radiotherapy and temoz olomide alone, demonstrating a similar improv ement in 
progression -free but not overall survival. [18] Responses were often measured 
radiographically, which may not  be the most reliable indicator of respo nse to anti -
angiogenic agents.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_888043] tumor response :  
 
While rapid responses in MRI contrast enhancement after initiation of treatment with 
VEGF pathway inhibitors are relatively common, it is not cl ear whether these changes 
truly reflect tumor regression or simply restoration of the blood- brain barrier.[ 19] 
Furthermore, increasing non -enhancing T2 FLAIR regions have been reported and may 
potentially represent tumor progression after bevacizumab.[ 20] This has driven 
 8 MC167B  
 
spec ulation that the improvement in progression -free but not overall survival with 
bevacizumab may be primarily driven by [CONTACT_658443].   
 1.6 Reirradiation is often used for treatment of progression :  
 
Repeat courses of radiotherapy are often considered for progressive disease refractory to systemic therapy.  Conventionally fractionated doses between [ADDRESS_888044] 
been used with minimal neurologic toxicity.[ 21-23] Hypofractionated doses of [ADDRESS_888045] also been used  with mini mal toxicity when limiting doses to 
<40 Gy .[22, 24-29] Mayer and colleagues  proposed a cumulative normal tissue dose 
limit (2 Gy per fraction equivalent) of <10 0 Gy to limit the risk of radionecrosis. [30] In 
general, the target volume includes a minimal expansion beyond MRI contrast enhancement. [21, 24-27, 29] Median  survival after reirradiation ranges from 7 to 10 
months. [21-27, 29] The best outcomes are seen when more time elapses  between 
primary radiation and reirradiation and in patien ts with lower- grade histology .[24-26, 
31]  In an analysis of patterns of recurre nce after reirradiation, 60 -70% recurrences 
were  located in -field with the remainder located out of field. [25, 32] Thus, MRI contrast 
enhancement may not accurately reflect tumor location potentially resulting in imprecise targetin g of radiation target volumes.  
 
1.7 
18F-DOPA -PET may allow better localization of recurrent disease than MRI :  
 
Because of the shortcomings of MRI in accurately differentiating tumor progression 
from pseudoprogression, in addition to the difficulty in tru ly assessing the response to 
bevacizumab, a novel imaging modality would prove useful in accurately classifying responses to treatment. In addition, more precise target delineation in the re-irradiation setting is particularly attractive; so as to allow fo r not only better target coverage but 
potentially reduced unnecessary coverage of normal tissue.  The lack of dependence of 
18-FDOPA- PET uptake on blood -brain barrier breakdown  is enticing,  as many of these 
patients are currently receiving or recently received bevacizumab and may have alterations in the blood -brain barrier.  
 
1.71 Preliminary results – 
18F-DOPA -PET identifies glioma outside conventional MRI in 
patients with imaging findings consistent with recurrent disease . In our two 
studies (MC1078 and MC1373), 13 patients with suspected recurrent disease had an 
18F-DOPA -PET/CT scan and MRI performed prior to stereotactic resection 
or biopsy. The PET scan  was rigidly reg istered to the T1 -weight scan using MIM 
Maestro (MIM Software Inc, Cleveland,  OH). The registered PET 
images  were transferred to the 
Stealth Station  Neuronavigation 
System (Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Memphis, TN) and stereotactic biopsy locations were plan ned based on the 
PET SUVmax and locations of PET and MRI discordance (Figure 1).  Of [ADDRESS_888046] enhance ment (M -P+). Of these, 
14 (93%) contained tumor and 10 (66%) were high -grade. Of t he 33 specimens 
containing high -grade glioma, 20 (61%) were from regions of MRI contrast 
enhancement  and 26 (79%) were from regions of 18F-DOPA avidity.

  For patients with PET uptake outside of the MR volume, the percentage of PET   
  uptake encompassed by [CONTACT_658445] e MR defined   
  volume will be determined, and the maximal distance (in millimeters) between   
  the margin of the MR volume and the margin encompassing 100% of the PET   
  uptake will be quantified. Both  PET T/N ratio >2.0 and T/N ratio > 1.5 will be   
  used to defin e the PET volume.  
     7.41  Exploratory analysis for other T/N thresholds and SUV levels will be investigated

10.0 Adverse Event (AE) Reporting and Monitoring  
 
10.1  Definitions /18F-DOPA  
Adverse Event - An untoward or undesirable experience associated with the use of a 
medical product (i.e. drug, device, biologic) in a patient or research subject.  
Serious Adverse Event - Adverse events are classified as serious or non- serious.  Serious 
problems/events can be well defined and include;  
• death  
• life threatening adverse experience  
• hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• inpatient, new, or prolonged; disability/incapacity  
• persistent or s ignificant birth defect/anomaly  
 and/or per protocol may be problems/events that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_658427], safety , or welfare of the subjects or 
others, or substantially compromised the research data. 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious, should be regarded as 
non- serious adverse events .  
 
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845]) - Any 
unanticipated problem or adverse event that meets the fol lowing three criteria:  
• Serious : Serious problems or events that results in significant harm, (which 
may be physical, psychological, financial, social, economic, or legal) or increased risk for the subject or others (including individuals who are not resea rch subjects). These include: (1) death; (2) life threatening adverse 
experience; (3) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] - inpatient, new, or prolonged; (4) 
disability/incapacity - persistent or significant; (5) birth defect/anomaly; (6) 
breach of confidentiality and (7) other problems, events, or new information (i.e. publications, DSMB reports, interim findings, product labeling change) 
that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_14846], 
safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or substantially compromise the research data, AND  
• Unanticipated : (i.e. unexpected) problems or events are those that are not 
already described as potential risks in the protocol, consent document, not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure, or not part of an underlying disease. A problem or event is "unanticipated" when it was unforeseeable at the time of its occurrence. A problem or event is "unanticipated" when it occurs at an increased frequency or at an increased severity than expected, AND  
• Related : A problem or event is "related" if it is possibly related to the research 
procedures.  
• Preexisting Condition - A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start 
of the study.  A preexisting condition should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period. At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically 
 24 MC167B  
 
significant findings/abnormalities th at meet the definition of an adverse event 
must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.

18F-DOPA injection by [CONTACT_658448]. If AE is observed a second AE assessment is required <  
 [ADDRESS_888077] injection which will be performed by [CONTACT_464].  
      10.22 1 When assessing whether an advers e event is related to the 
18FDOPA  
    injection, the following attribution categories are utilized:  
 
PET adverse events  
Definite  - The adverse event is clearly related to the PET scanning and 18F-DOPA  
 injection  
Probable - The adverse event is likely related to the PET scanning and 18F-DOPA  
 injection  
Possible  - The adverse event may be related to PET scanning and 18F-DOPA  
 injection  
Unlikely - The adverse event is doubtfully related to the PET scanning and 18F-
 DOPA in jection  
Unrelated - The adverse event is clearly NOT related to the PET scanning and 
 18F-DOPA injection  
  
 [ADDRESS_888078] there is evidence to indicate a causal relationshi p 
between the agent  and the adverse event.  
  10.3   Expected vs. Unexpected / 
18F-DOPA  
  
• The determination of whether an AE is expected is based on agent- specific 
adverse event information provided in Section 15.0 of the protocol.  
  
• Unexpected AEs are those not listed in the agent-specific adverse event information provided in section 15.0 of the protocol.  
  NOTE: “Unexpected adverse experiences” mean any adverse experience that is neither  
  identified in nature, severity, or frequency of risk, in the information neither  
  provided for IRB review nor mentioned in the consent form.

• Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) – Other (Progressive Disease)” u nder the system organ 
class (SOC) of the same name. Evidence that the death was a 
manifestation of underlying disease (e.g., radiological changes 
suggesting tumor growth or progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease process) should be su bmitted.  
    10.6  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Unanticipated Problems / 
18F-DOPA 
  When an adverse event has been identif ied, the study team will take appropriated 
action necessary to protect t he study participant and then complete the Study Adverse 
Event Worksheet and log.  The investigator will evaluate the event and determine the 
necessary follow -up and reporting required.  
 10.61  Serious Adverse Events will be reported as part of regular adverse event 
 reporting mechanisms via the data capture system and logged for review 
 reporting.  
 10.62  Investigator Reporting: Notifying the Mayo IRB/
18F-DOPA:  
 The IRB requirements reflect the guidance documents released by [CONTACT_658450] (OHRP), and the Food and Drug Administration 
 28 MC167B  
 
 (FDA) in early 2007 and are respectively entitled “Guidance on Reviewing and 
 Reporting Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others and 
 Adverse Events” and “Guidance  for Clinical Investigators, Sponsors, and IRBs: 
 Adverse Event Reporting – Improving Human Subject Protection.” 
 
10.621 According to Mayo IRB Policy any serious adverse event (SAE) 
which the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_205274] a UPI[INVESTIGATOR_658430] [ADDRESS_888083] learns of the problem/event.  
 10.62 2 Non -UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845] – the investigator reports problems or events that 
do NOT meet criteria of an UPI[INVESTIGATOR_658431]. The investigator monitors the severity and frequency of subsequent non -UPI[INVESTIGATOR_16104].  
  Consider the following information to collect when developi[INVESTIGATOR_658432].  
  Example  
  Information collected on the adverse event worksheet (and  
  entered in the research database):  
• Subject’s name:  
• Medical record number:  
• Disease/histology (if applicable):  
• The date the adverse event occurred:  
• Description of the adverse event:  
• Relations hip of the adverse event to the research (drug, 
procedure, or intervention):  
• If the adverse event was expected:  
• The severity of the adverse event: (use a table to define severity scale 1 -5) 
• If any intervention was necessary:  
• Resolution: (was the incident resolved spontaneously, or after discontinuing treatment)  
• Date of Resolution:  
 The investigator will review all adverse event reports to determine if specific reports need to be made to the IRB and FDA.  The investigator will sign and date the adverse e vent 
report when it is reviewed  (if applicable).  For this protocol, only

   Second malignancies require ONLY routine reporting.  
   All secondary malignanc ies that occur following treatment will be reported.  
   Three options are available to describe the event:  
 
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., Acute Myeloctyic 
Leukemia [AML])  
• Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
• Treatment- related secondary malignancy  
    Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS)

   require ONLY routine reporting.   
 
 10.13 Monitoring and Auditing  
  The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by [CONTACT_1201], 
the sponsor, and government regulatory agencies, of all study related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data etc.).  
The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study -related 
facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  Participation as an investigator in 
this study implies acceptance of potential inspection by [CONTACT_658452]  
 10.131 Medical Monitoring  
  It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_658433]/her site.  This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and   
 appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted above, as well as the    
 construction and implementation of a site data and safety -monitoring plan (see   
 section 10.7  “Monitoring and Auditing”).  Medical monitoring will include a   
 regular assessment of the number and  type of  serious adverse events.  “Any   
 serious adve rse events will be followed up by [CONTACT_658453]”

  resonance imaging (MRI) with assessment based on the RANO criteria, until progression  
  of disease (up to 2 years).  
   11.2  Definitions :  
   
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the international criteria  
 proposed by [CONTACT_246493] -Oncology (RANO) Working Group. [14]  
   
  Note: Lesions are eith er measurable or non -measurable using the criteria provided  
  below. The term “evaluable” in reference to measurability will not be used because it  
  does  not provide additional meaning or accuracy.  
     11.[ADDRESS_888097] be recorded in millimeters (or decim al  
   fractions of centimeters).  
     11.22  Non-measurable Disease  
 
This is defined as either uni -dimensionally measurable lesions, masses with 
margins not clearly defined, or lesions with maximal perpendicular diameters 
<10 mm.  
 
11.23  Target Lesions  
 All measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured (sum of the products of the  
perpendicular diameters) at baseline. Target le sions should be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameters) and their suitability for 
accurate repeated measurements by [CONTACT_340738] g techniques. Occasionally, the 
largest lesions may not be suitable for reproducible measurements and the next 
largest lesions which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  
 [ADDRESS_888098] -enhancing lesion may occur even in the setting of stable disease 
(SD) or partial response (PR) in th e target lesions. These changes would qualify 
as progression. Non -target lesions also include measurable lesions that exceed 
the maximum number of 5. Measurements of these lesions are not required but the presence or absence of each should be noted through out follow -up. 
 
11.3  Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
   All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
 calipers. Baseline evaluations should ideally be performed within 21 days before the 
 beginning of tr eatment. These techniques should be performed with  cuts of 4 mm or 
 less in slice thickness contiguously. The MRIs will be evaluated both locally and centrally 
 by a core lab. 
 11.4  Response Criteria  
 11.41   Evaluation of Target Lesions  
   11.411 Complete Response (CR): Requires all of the following:  
• Complete disappearance of all enhancing measurable and non -
measurable disease sustained for at least 4 weeks  
• No new lesions  
• Stable or improved non -enhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions  
• Patients must be off corticosteroids  
• Stable or improved clinically  
• Patients with non -measurable disease cannot have a complete 
response. The best response possible is stable disease.  
 11.412 Partial Response (PR): Requires all of the following:  
• ≥50% decrease compared to baseline in the sum of products of perpendicular diameters of all measurable enhancing lesions sustained for at least 4 weeks  
• No progression of non -measurable disease  
• No new lesions  
• Stable or improved non -enhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same or 
lower dose of cortic osteroids compared to baseline scan  
• The corticosteroid dose at the time of the scan evaluation should be no greater than the dose at time of the baseline scan  
• Stable or improved clinically  
 37 MC167B  
 
 
11.413 Stable Disease (SD): Requires all of the following:   
• Does n ot qualify for complete  response, partial response, or 
progression  
• Minimum 4 weeks duration  
• Stable non -enhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same or lower dose of 
corticosteroids compared to baseline scan. In the event that the 
corticosteroid dose has been increased, the last scan considered to show stable disease will be the scan obtained when the corticosteroid dose was equivalent to the baseline dose  
• Stable clinically  
 
11.414 Progression: Defined by [CONTACT_39132]:

• Significant increase in T2/FLAIR non -enhancing lesion  on stable or 
increasing doses of corticosteroids compared to baseline scan or best response following initiation of therapy, not due to co -morbid

• Clear clinical deterioration not attributable to other causes apart 
from the tumor (e.g. seizures, medication side effects, 
complications of therapy, cerebrovascular events, infection, etc.) or changes in corticosteroid dose. The definition of clinical deterioration is left to the discretion of the investigator but it is recommended that a decrease in 20% of KPS or from any baseline to 50% or less be considered, unless attributable to co -morbid 
events.

18F-DOPA is an investigational PET tracer utilized for the study under a Mayo physician -sponsor 
IND #[ADDRESS_888100] is guaranteed given the toxicity data of the 
variou s potential impurities. 18F-DOPA -PET is currently in production at this institution, and is 
used to image  malignant gliomas for research studies MC 1373 (IRB 13 -005102) and MC 1374 
(IRB 13 -005106).  
 44 MC167B  
 
16.0 Statistical Considerations and Methodology  
  
 16.1  Study Overview  
 
This is a single -arm, single -stage phase II Simon’s Optimum study with an analysis that 
will compare progression- free survival (PFS)  at [ADDRESS_888101] not progressed within 3 
months. A success will be a patient who is a live and without evidence of 
progressive disease within 3 months  from registration . Media n PFS after 
bevacizumab failure ranges between 1 -2 months. [17, 34] Thus, the largest 
success proportion where the proposed treatment would be considered 
ineffective in this population is 20 %. The followin g Simon’s Optimum design 
uses [ADDRESS_888102] 20% with an overall significance level (alpha) of 0.186 , and a power of 
85.9 % to detec t a true success proportion of 40%.  
 
16.[ADDRESS_888103] 20 patients to 
 become evaluable, unless undue toxicity is observed.  
 16.3  Sample Size  
  The design to be utilized is fully described in section 0. A maximum of 20 
 evaluable patients will be accrued to this pi[INVESTIGATOR_658434] 
 45 MC167B  
 
 encountered. We anticipate accruing an additional 2 patients to account for 
 ineligibility, cancellation, major treatment violation or other reasons. Maximum 
 projected accrual is therefore 22 patients. We anticipate screening 30 patients to 
 register a total of 22 patients necessary for study design.  
 
16.4  Accrual Time and Study Duration  
 
Based on institutional experience, we deliver RT to an average of 25  recurrent glioma 
patients annually. Our plan to accrue 10  patients per year is based on including less than 
50% of our recurrent glioma RT population, which is readily achievable. We  plan to 
accrue patients for years 1 -2, leaving years 3 -4 for follow -up and analysis. Therefore, the 
overall study duration is expected to be  48 months.  
 16.5  Power and Significance Levels  
  
Assuming the number of successes is binomially distributed, the s ignifican ce level is 
0.186 and probability of declaring that this regimen warrants fu rther studies (i.e. 
statistical power) under various success proportions and the probab ility of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_362210] a function of the true  success proportion 
as shown in the following table.   
 16.6  Other considerations:  
   Adverse events and patterns or fa ilure observed in this study as well as scientific 
 discoveries or changes in standard care will be taken into account in any decision to 
 terminate the study.  
 16.7  Analysis plan  
  
The analysis for this trial will commence at the planned time  points (see Section  4.0) and 
at the time patients have become evaluable for the primary endpoint. Such decisions will be made by [CONTACT_658454], in accord with the Cancer Center Statistics (CCS) Standard Operating Procedures, availability of data for secondary endpoints, and level of data maturity. The earliest date anticipated in which results will be available for manuscript, abstract or presentation format is when [ADDRESS_888104] 3 months. Subgroup analyses will be 
included for this primary endpoint to assess known prognostic factors such as MGMT 
status, age, and time from prior RT to reirradiation.  
 16.71  Primary Endpoint:  
  
16.711 Definition: the primary endpoint of this trial is proportion of patients 
experiencing progression -free survival at [ADDRESS_888105] day of therapy.  
 16.712 Estimation: the proportion of suc cesses will be estimated  by [CONTACT_658455].  
 Confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated 
 according to the approach of Duffy and Santner. [37] 
 16.713 Over Accrual: if more than the target number of patients are 
 accrued, the additional patients will not be used for evaluation  of  
 stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_658435]. The will be  
 included in the final point estimates and confidence limits.  
 16.8   Definitions and Analysis of Secondary and Correlative Endpoints  
   Subgroup analyses will be included as appropriate for these secondary 
 endpoints to assess known prognostic factors.  
   16.81  Overall Survival: compare overall survival (OS) at [ADDRESS_888106] enhancement with historical controls.   
  Survival time will be determined from the time of initial diagnosis to   
  deat h from any cause. Survival from reirradiation will be determined   
  from the time of study registration to the ti me of death from any cause.   
  The distributions of the survival time will be estimated using the Kaplan -  
  Meier method. [38] 
   16.82  Volumetric Comparison: to differences in the 
18F-DOPA -PET avid region   
  with abnormalities on MRI, the treating radiation oncologists will first   
  define treatment volumes for GTV_MRI using the T1 -post contrast  MRI   
  scans while blinded to the PET study. A volume named T2_FLAIR _NCET  will be  
  defined by [CONTACT_658456] T2 hyperintensity on T2 FLAIR MRI sequences. Then  
  the PET study will be fused with the contouring software to allow   
  automated contouring of GTV_PET defined by [CONTACT_941] T/N ratio > 2.0 (and   
  T/N > 1.5). These contours will be reviewed by [CONTACT_658457]. The volume of overlap   
  and non -overlap between the GTV_MRI, T2 _FLAIR _NCET  and GTV_PET will be  
  calculated. Paired t -test statistical analysis will be performed to    
  determine if any differences exist and the level of statistical significance   
  between treatment volumes defined by [CONTACT_658458]. The analysis of volumes from [ADDRESS_888107] 80% power to detect differences in volumes with an   
  effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_888108] with 0.05 two -sided signif icance level.  
  Alternate metrics for comparison will also be assessed including  spatial overlap,  
  distance, correlations, and 3D shape comparisons.  
 47 MC167B  
 
  
 16.83  Patterns of Failure: observe patterns of failure after reirradiation using   
  18F-DOPA -PET to guide treatment volumes. The MRI scan in dicating   
  progressive disease will be fused with our treatment planning scan and   
  the region of progression will be contoured by [CONTACT_658459]_MRI, T2_FLAIR _NCET , GTV_PET, PTV_high, and isodose lines. A   
  volumetric analysis  will then be performed to define the doses delivered  
  to the absolute and relative volume of the region where recurrence is   
  defined.  
  16.84  Adverse Events: determine acute and late toxicity after radiotherapy   
  treatment using 
18F-DOPA -PET to delineate treatment volumes. The rate  
  of acute and late treatment -related toxicities for recurrent high -grade   
  glioma patients treated with 18F-DOPA -PET image -guided radiotherapy   
  will be determined, with acute RT toxicities graded using Common   
  Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 (available   
  at http://ctep.cancer.gov ), and late toxicities reported using    
  RTOG/ EORTC late toxicity criteria. [39]  
   16.85  Reoperation Rates: determine the rate of  reoperation for patients   
  undergoing reirradiation for recurrent high -grade gliomas treated using   
  
18F-DOPA -PET guided volumes. When available, pathologic information   
  detailing the presence of necrosis and/or tumor progression will be   
  record ed.  
  
 16.86  Quality of Life: estimate quality of life (QOL) after radiotherapy using   
  18F-DOPA -PET to establish treatment volumes. QOL will be evaluated   
  using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory Brain Tumor Module   
  (MDASI -BT) and fatigue will be evaluated using the MD Anderson Brief   
  Fatigue Inventory. These questionnaires will be administered at baseline  
  and at each MRI evaluation up to [ADDRESS_888109]   
 twice a year to identify accrual, adverse event, and any endpoint   
 problems that might be developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. The Mayo Clinic Cancer Center   
 (MCCC) Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) is responsible for   
 reviewing the accrual and safety for this trial at least twice a year, based  
 on reports provided by [CONTACT_31959].  
  
16.91  Adverse Event Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10020] s: As no reactions to 
18F-DOPA have been reported 
within the i nstitution, toxicity testing reported in the literature revealed no 
deleterious effects (section 0), and there have been no allergic reactions in all 
 48 MC167B  
 
patients accrued to date on multiple studies MC1078, MC1373, and MC1374, no 
reactions are anticipated. As such, if either of the two scenarios below occur, enrollment will be suspended so that details of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_258772] a trial recommend ation will be formulated and presented to the MCCC 
DSMB:  
• At any point during the AE evaluation of the first 9 AE -evaluable patients,  
one or more patients is unable to complete PET scanning due to allergic 
reactions to the tracer . 
Or, after 10 or more patie nts are evaluable for AEs , more than 10% of these patients are 
unable to complete PET scanning due to allergic reactions to the tracer.   There have been no reports in the literature of the occurrence of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in patients with  normal renal function. Additionally, we 
will use the contrast agent gadobenate dimeglumine, which has been shown to 
have a high safety profile (lower incidence of NSF in patients with renal 
failure/insufficiency) compared with many other available Gd -base d contrast 
agents. Therefore no reactions are anticipated. As such, if at any time a patient develops NSF enrollment will be suspended so that details of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_258772] a trial recommendation will be formulated and presented to the MCCC DSMB . 
  Using the radiation treatment dosing, fractionation and normal tissue  
constraints outlined in Section [ADDRESS_888110] been performed in several studies without significant adverse effects. While radiation -induced brain necrosis is 
rare, a cumulative normal brain dose of < 100 Gy in 2 Gy equivalents has been suggested as a constraint to minimize the risk of necrosis. [30] Two large studies 
reported no grade 3 or higher toxicity and no radionecrosis using the same dosing and fractionation as our  protocol. [26, 27] In fact, studies using larger 
fraction sizes (5 Gy/fraction) reported very low rates of radionecrosis when keepi[INVESTIGATOR_658436] 40 Gy. [28, 29] However, tumor progression is 
expected in the majority of patients and commonly results in severe neurologic symptoms near the end of life.  Both acute (available at  http://ctep.cancer.gov
) 
and late [ 39] toxicity will be monitored continuously as eac h patient is accrued 
and follow -up data are accumulated. If at any time, 1) [ADDRESS_888111] 9 
AE-evaluable patients; or, 2) after 10 or more patients are AE-evaluable , more 
than 30% experience any of the following adverse effects considered to be at 
least possibly related to radiation treatment up to and including the three-
month timepoint ; enrollment will be suspended so the details of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_658437] a trial recommendation will be formulated and presented 
to the MCCC DSMB , adjustin g the dose, fraction size or volumes as needed.   
• Grade 3 or 4 irreversible CNS toxicity  
• Grade 4 non -hematologic, non -CNS toxicity  
• Any Grade 5 toxicity

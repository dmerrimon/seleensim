PROTOCOL TITLE: Tolerability, Safety, and Efficacy of Tedizolid as Oral Treatment for Bone and Joint 
Infection 
Revised: 8/10/18   Version 1.6
 Page 2 of 29The objective  of our study  is to quantify  the tolerability  and safety  of tedizolid  for bone  and joint 
infections,  both hardware  and non-hardware  associated.  The study  will focus  on tolerability  (e.g.,  
gastrointestinal),  hematologic  toxicities,  and neurologic  toxicities.   
 
Tedizolid  is a FDA  approved  antibiotic  with an indication  for skin and soft tissue  infection.  It’s 
spectrum  of activity  is nearly  all gram  positive  cocci,  i.e., the primary  causes  of osteomyelitis.  Unlike  
the other  commercially  available  medication  in its class,  linezolid,  tedizolid  does not appear  to be 
associated  with hematologic  and neurologic  toxicities  in short  term and animal  studies.  However,  longer  
term studies  with tedizolid  have  not been  performed.  
 
This study  is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  We realize  that efficacy  is of primary  concern  for treatment  of bone  and joint 
infection,  but the purpose  of this study  is more  exploratory  and will focus  primary  on the 
tolerability/toxicity  issues  outlined  above.   
 
Additional  outcomes  will be measured,  but these  are not primary  outcomes.  We will measure  efficacy  of 
tedizolid,  but comparative  efficacy  (e.g.,  compared  to non-tedizolid  based  regimens)  will not be 
measured  based  on small  sample  size and funding  limitations.  Of great  importance  to highlight  is that 
clinical  trials,  even  non-comparative  ones,  are extremely  rare for bone  and joint infection.  Randomized  
clinical  trials  comparing  one antibiotic  to another  for bone  and joint infection  are almost  never  
performed  in the current  era. 
 
Hypotheses:   
1. Tedizolid  is well tolerated  for prolonged  (> 4 weeks)  courses  of antibiotic  therapy  for patients  
with bone  and joint infection  
2. Tedizolid  is safe for prolonged  (> 4 weeks)  courses  of antibiotic  therapy  for patients  with bone  
and joint infection  
3. Tedizolid  is effective  for the treatment  of bone  and joint infection  
 
5) Background*

Describe  any relevant  preliminary  data.   
Provide  the scientific  or scholarly  background  for, rationale  for, and significance  of the Human  
Research  based  on the existing  literature  and how will it add to existing  knowledge.

PROTOCOL TITLE: Tolerability, Safety, and Efficacy of Tedizolid as Oral Treatment for Bone and Joint 
Infection 
Revised: 8/10/[ADDRESS_837335]  the incidence  of bone  and joint infection  is increasing  
dramatically.  More  specifically,  population-based  U.S. data from  Olmstead  County  showed  that the 
incidence  of bone  and joint infection  has doubled  from  rates  30 years  prior.  The reasons  for this 
dramatic  increase  are unclear  but believed  to stem  from  the increased  prevalence  of co-morbidities,  such 
as diabetes,  in the general  population.  Bone  and joint infection  treatment  is particularly  problematic  
because  it requires  prolonged  therapy  for weeks  or months,  which  incurs  risk of treatment-related  
adverse  side effects.  
 
Treatment  for bone  and joint infection  is not standardized,  which  allows  a wide  range  of antibiotic  
therapy  to potentially  be given.  Treatments  include  medications  from  many  different  antibiotic  classes,  
which  may be administered  through  intravenous  (IV) therapy  or oral therapy.  Oral therapy  is 
increasingly  popular,  as recent  data suggest  that oral therapy  for bone  and joint infection  achieves  
similar  cure rates  to traditional  intravenous  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_628368],  clogged  catheters,  and catheter-associated  infections.  Oral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_628369].   
 
S. aureus  is the most  common  cause  of bone  and joint infection.  Methicillin  resistant  S. aureus  (MRSA)  
are increasingly  common  and currently  over half of all S. aureus  are MRSA  in most  U.S. and non-U.S.  
medical  centers.  Treatment  of S. aureus , MRSA,  and other  Gram-positive  bone  and joint infection  with 
oral therapy  has been  difficult,  as many  of these  organisms  are not susceptible  to oral antibiotics,  with 
the exception  of linezolid.  However,  linezolid  is used to treat bone  and joint infection  with great  
trepi[INVESTIGATOR_628370],  as prolonged  linezolid  therapy  is associated  with hematologic  toxicity  and neurologic  
toxicity  such as peripheral  and optic  neuropathy.  Most  concerningly,  these  neurologic  toxicities  may be 
irreversible.  Thus  many  patients  receive  IV therapy  to treat bone  and joint infection,  which  carries  risk 
of nephrotoxicity  (vancomycin),  requires  regular  monitoring  of renal  functions  and serum  levels  
(vancomycin),  and/or  has high associated  drug costs  (daptomycin,  ceftaroline).   
 
Trauma-associated  bone  and joint infection  is also a common  problem.  Victims  of major  trauma  often  
suffer  bone  fractures,  which  require  temporary  or permanent  use of orthopedic  devices  such as external-
fixation  pi[INVESTIGATOR_2115],  plates,  and screws.  Approximately  5% of these  internal  fixation  devices  become  infected.  
Medical  and surgical  treatment  of these  infections  incur  significant  costs.  Coagulase  negative  
Staphylococci  are a common  cause  of these  infections,  and oral treatment  options  are similarly  limited  to 
linezolid,  which  again,  is highly  problematic  to use as a prolonged  therapy  that is required  for these  
infections.  
 
Tedizolid  is a new FDA-approved  oxazolidinone  antibiotic,  available  both intravenously  and orally.  
Tedizolid  has a favorable  adverse  event  profile  and low thrombocytopenia  rates  compared  to linezolid,  
due to its potency  against  Gram-positive  bacteria  that allows  it to be given  as a significantly  lower  daily  
drug dose compared  to linezolid,  its lower  systemic  free drug exposure  compared  to linezolid,  and its 
lower  duration  of treatment  compared  to linezolid . Further,  the lower  incidence  of thrombocytopenia  
rates  with tedizolid  compared  to linezolid  may be due to its differential  potential  to inhibit  mitochondrial  
protein  synthesis,  as shown  in pre-clinical  studies  (Flanagan  S, et al. Antimicrob  Agents  Chemother  
2014  58:6462-70).   At FDA-approved  doses,  tedizolid  has hematologic  side effects  similar  to that of 
placebo.  Additionally,  unlike  linezolid,  interactions  with SSRIs  appear  unlikely.  Drug-mitochondrial  
binding,  which  is believed  to be the mechanism  to which  mid-  and long-term  toxicities  of linezolid  such 
as neuropathy  are acquired,  is not seen with tedizolid,  suggesting  that the side effects  associated  with 
long-term  therapy  of linezolid  may not be found  with tedizolid.

a) Recruitment  Methods  
Describe  when,  where,  and how potential  subjects  will be recruited.   
[CONTACT_628412],  the primary  investigator,  and his team  will inform  select  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_161065] (e.g.,  
Orthopedic  Surgery,  Infectious  Diseases,  Trauma  Surgery/Limb  Salvage  Service)  of the study  
and seek their assistance  in identifying  and notifying  the study  staff of possible  subjects  who 
have  presented  to the Emergency  Department,  Inpatient  Units,  or Outpatient  Clinic  with bone  
and joint infection.   
The Investigator  and study  staff will also use the Harbor-UCLA  Medical  Center’s  Electronic  
Medical  Records  to screen  for potential  subjects.  Additionally,  the Investigator  and study  staff 
will review  clinical  cultures  from  the Harbor-UCLA  Microbiological  Laboratory  to identify  
wound  cultures  growing  gram  positive  organism   and review  the Electronic  Medical  Record  to 
identify  those  cultures  that were  taken  from  bone  and joint infections.  
After  identifying  a potential  patient,  the Investigator  or study  staff will approach  the subject’s  
primary  treatment  team  and ask for their permission  to introduce  the study  and the study  staff to 
the patient.  Study  staff will then present  information  about  the study  (See Recruitment  Script  
V1.0)  to see if they are interested.  Permission  will be sought  from  the subject  by [CONTACT_628389]’s  primary  treating  team  approaches  them  about  
the study.

No materials  will be used to directly  recruit  patients.  Flyers  will be given  to select  Inpatient  and 
Outpatient  Clinic  staff.  Flyers  will also be given  to physicians  outside  Harbor  UCLA  Medical  
Center.  Once  the physician  identifies  a potential  patient  and receives  verbal  consent  from  the 
patient,  the physician  will call the study  staff.  At that point  the study  staff will screen  the patient  
via phone  and a waiver  of written  consent  will be utilized  for screening  purposes  only.  
 
Describe  the amount  and timing  of any payments  to subjects.  
The subjects  will be paid in cash for their follow  up visits.  They  will be paid $30 for the visit on

g) Procedures  Involved  in the Human  Research*  
Describe  and explain  the study  design.   
The design  of this study  is a prospective,  open-label,  non-comparative  clinical  trial of tedizolid  for the 
treatment  of bone  and joint infection.  We will follow  patients  for between  16 and 24 weeks,  depending  
on the length  of their antibiotic  treatment,  for the purpose  of determining  tolerability,  safety,  and 
efficacy  of prolonged  use (> 4 weeks)  of tedizolid  in the treatment  of bone  and joint infection.  
Participants  will be enrolled  regardless  of race,  ethnicity,  or gender  (as long as they are within  18-85  
years  of age).   
 
Subjects  will be given  tedizolid  orally  [ADDRESS_837348]’s  treating  physician.  In 
other  words,  the primary/consulting  physician  who is managing  the treatment  of the patient’s  bone  and 
joint infection  will be the one who decides  the length  of the tedizolid  treatment.   
 
Safety  and tolerability  of tedizolid  through  this study  will be guaranteed  for [ADDRESS_837349] (e.g.,  subject  payments,  laboratory  tests,  clinic  
utilization  costs).  If patients  require  greater  than 12 weeks  of therapy  for Gram-positive  pathogens,  study

will be provided  by [CONTACT_628394]  (IDS)  on the LA BioMed/Harbor-UCLA  campus,  
which  supplies  all research  related  medications  to study  subjects  at our center.  
 
Subjects  will be enrolled  as outpatients  or as inpatients  when  discharge  is expected  in the near future  (< 
1 week).  [CONTACT_628412],  the primary  investigator,  and his team  will advise  the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_628375],  Inpatient  Floors,  or Outpatient  Clinic  with bone  and joint 
infection.  The Investigator  or study  staff will approach  the subject’s  primary  treatment  team  and ask for 
their permission  to introduce  the study  and the study  staff to the patient.  Study  staff will then present  
information  about  the study  (See Recruitment  Script  V1.0)  to see if they are interested.  Permission  will 
be sought  from  the subject  by [CONTACT_628395]’s  primary  
treating  team  approaches  them  about  the study.   
 
 
Once  an interested  patient  is identified,  study  staff will explain  the details  of the study  to the 
subject.  If the patient  is interested  in participating,  study  staff will complete  the informed  consent  
process  in a private  setting  in the patient’s  preferred  language  (English  or Spanish).   
 
Once  informed  consent  is obtained,  we will collect  data on all subjects’  demographics,  co-morbidities,  
surgical  history,  pertinent  microbiology  results,  and all concomitant  medications  using  standardized  
forms.  For exclusion  criteria  e) and f) regarding  cytopenias  and liver function,  CBC/CMPs  from  the past 
[ADDRESS_837351] 14 days,  a CBC  will be performed  on the day of enrollment  prior  to any study  drug being  
administered  to ensure  the patient  does not meet  exclusion  criteria  (see exclusion  criteria  e) and f)). 
 
Upon  confirmation  of eligibility,  the study  coordinators  will call the pharmacy,  which  will be the LA 
BioMed  Investigational  Drug  Service  (IDS).  The research  pharmacists  at the LABioMed  Investigational  
Drug  Service  (IDS)  will dispense  the medication  to the subject.  Subjects  will be given  detailed  verbal  
instructions  on the use of the medication  in either  English  or Spanish  as preferred  by [CONTACT_423].  The 
subject  will be given  a medication  diary  and asked  to record  the time of day when  they take each pi[INVESTIGATOR_628376].  The subject  will be given  a small  card to keep  on their person  with 
information  about  the study  and study  staff and emergency  contact  [CONTACT_3031].  The study  staff will 
answer  any questions  that the subject  has at this time and will encourage  the subject  to contact  [CONTACT_628396].  
 
The subject  will present  to the Clinical  and Translational  Research  Unit (CTRU),  the clinical  site of the 
UCLA  Clinical  and Translational  Science  Institute  (CTSI)  on the Harbor-UCLA  campus  for follow  up 
visits.  These  follow  up visits  will occur  at week  1, week  2, week  3, week  4, week  5, week  6, week  7, 
week  8, week  9, week  10, week  11, week  12 and week  13. All subjects  will return  for follow  up visitson  
weeks  1 – 5 and 12, and subjects  still taking  the study  drug after week  5 will continue  to return  for 
weekly  follow  up visits  until they complete  the course  or until they reach  12 weeks.  Once  subjects  
complete  the course  of the study  drug,  they will return  for one additional  weekly  follow  up visit (e.g. if a 
patient  completes  the study  drug at 7 weeks,  they will return  for visits  on weeks  1-8 and week  12). If 
subjects  take the study  drug for 12 weeks,  they will return  for a final follow  up visit on week  13. 
 
At each follow  up visit,  CBC  and CMP  (comprehensive  chemistry  panel  including  liver function  tests)  
will be collected  via a blood  draw.  This blood  sample  will be sent to Quest  Diagnostics  by [CONTACT_628397]: [ZIP_CODE]-01

Additionally,  standardized  surveys  (See Data  Collection  Fields  V 1.0, Neuropathy  Scale  V 1.0, attached)  
will be administered  about  drug side effects  and tolerability,  and adverse  events  will be measured  using  
the Medical  Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities  Terminology  (MedDRA)  version  18.1 (or the most  
current  version).  At these  follow  up visits,  we will also record  data points  relevant  to defining  the 
efficacy  of the treatment,  such as the duration  of the antibiotic  treatment,  any unplanned  surgical  
procedures  prompted  by [CONTACT_628398],  recurrence  of signs  or symptoms  of bone  and joint 
infection,  and any other  relevant  comments  or observations  from  the subject.  The subject  will also be 
asked  to bring  their study  drug medication  bottle  and medication  diary  in order  to assess  compliance.  If a 
subject  suspects  pregnancy  during  a follow  up visit,  they will be given  a pregnancy  test and the study  
team  will track  their reported  menstrual  cycle.  If the subject  does become  pregnant,  they will be 
discontinued  from  the study  drug.  Study  staff will follow  and collect  data on the course  of the pregnancy  
and the health  of the child  for at least 6-[ADDRESS_837352]  weekly  CBCs  performed  until 
resolution  of the myelosuppression.  
 
Subjects  who are concurrently  taking  serotenergic  agents  while  receiving  the study  drug will be 
monitored  for signs  and symptoms  of serotonin  syndrome  at each scheduled  follow-up  visit.  Symptoms  
of serotonin  syndrome  include  agitation  or restlessness,  confusion,  rapid  heartbeat  and high blood  
pressure,  dilated  (big)  pupi[INVESTIGATOR_8324],  loss of muscle  coordination  or twitching  muscles,  muscle  rigidity  
(stiffness),  heavy  sweating,  diarrhea,  headache,  shivering  and goose  bumps.  
 
The subjects  will be paid in cash for their follow  up visits.  They  will be paid $30 for the visit on

and the procedures  performed  solely  for the research.   
All procedures  will be performed  either  in the Emergency  Department,  Inpatient  Wards  and 
Critical  Care  Units  (ICU,  MICU,  SICU,  CCU,  PCU)  or Outpatient  Clinics  during  study  Visit  1

Outpatient  Clinic  in building  RB-3.  Laboratory  procedures  are performed  in RB-3,  room  235. 
 
Describe  procedures  taken  to lessen  the probability  or magnitude  of risks.   
We have  provided  access  to study  staff 24/[ADDRESS_837355]  Gram-positive  bacteria  that allows  it to be given  as a significantly  
lower  daily  drug dose compared  to linezolid,  its lower  systemic  free drug exposure  compared  to 
linezolid,  and its lower  duration  of treatment  compared  to linezolid . Further,  the lower  incidence  of 
thrombocytopenia  rates  with tedizolid  compared  to linezolid  may be due to its differential  potential  to 
inhibit  mitochondrial  protein  synthesis,  as shown  in pre-clinical  studies  (Flanagan  S, et al. Antimicrob  
Agents  Chemother  2014  58:6462-70).  At FDA-approved  doses,  tedizolid  has hematologic  side effects  
similar  to that of placebo.  Additionally,  unlike  linezolid,  interactions  with SSRIs  appear  unlikely.  Drug-
mitochondrial  binding,  which  is believed  to be the mechanism  to which  mid-  and long-term  toxicities  of 
linezolid  such as neuropathy  are acquired,  is not seen with tedizolid,  suggesting  that the side effects  
associated  with long-term  therapy  of linezolid  may not be found  with tedizolid.  Tedizolid  will be used in 
this research  to treat bone  and joint infection  in patients  who need  prolonged  antibiotic  treatment  for 4-
12 weeks.   
 
Because  the use of tedizolid  as prolonged  antibiotic  therapy  (4-12  weeks)  has not been  approved  by [CONTACT_1556],  it is unknown  whether  this dosage  level  will significantly  increase  the risks  associated  with the use 
of the drug product.  Therefore,  we have  obtained  an IND from  the FDA.  We were  notified  that this IND,  
no. 133495  may proceed  on 1/12/17.  
 
Please  note that while  we are seeking  an IND,  this study  does not meet  the following  IND criteria:  
 - Tedizolid  is lawfully  marked  in the United  States  under  the brand  name  [CONTACT_628410]  
- This research  is not intended  to be reported  to the FDA  as a well-controlled  study  in support  of a new 
indication  for use nor intended  to be used to support  any other  significant  change  in the labeling  for 
tedizolid  (Sivextro).  This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_628377].

their IRB and provide  a copy  of the approval  to LABioMed  study  staff and HSC  before  any data 
is shared.  
 
i) Data  Management  * 
Describe  the data analysis  plan,  including  any statistical  procedures.  
The study  is descriptive  and thus no formal  statistical  analysis  plan has been  performed.  The number  of 
subjects  chosen  (n=50)  is based  on a sample  size believed  to have  sufficient  power  to reassure  clinicians  
that tedizolid  is safe, tolerable,  and efficacious  for the treatment  of native  bone  and hardware-associated  
bone  and joint infection.  
Of note,  confidence  intervals  for safety  and efficacy  will be calculated.  Confidence  intervals  for 
outcomes  of low incidence  (e.g.,  thrombocytopenia)  will be approximately  +/-3 - 7%. E.g., assuming  
n=50  subjects,  a low incidence  outcome  with a probability  of 2.5%  will have  95% confidence  intervals  
of <0.1%-6.8%.  Outcomes  with probabilities  farther  from  0% or 100%  will have  wider  confidence  
intervals.  For example,  we anticipate  cure rate will be 80%,  in which  assuming  n=50,  95% confidence  
intervals  will be 69%-91%.

According  to the package  insert  for tedizolid  (Sivextro),  adverse  reactions  were  evaluated  for 
1050  patients  treated  with tedizolid  (200 mg oral/intravenous  once  daily  for 6 days)  in two Phase  
2 and two Phase  3 ABSSSI  (acute  bacterial  skin and soft structure  infection)  clinical  trials.  The 
median  age of patients  treated  with tedizolid  (200 mg oral/intravenous  once  daily  for 6 days)  in 
the Phase  2 and Phase  3 ABSSSI  trials  was 42 years,  ranging  between  17 and 86 years  old. 
Patients  treated  with tedizolid  (200 mg oral/intravenous  once  daily  for 6 days)  were  
predominantly  male  (65%)  and white  (82%).  
 
Serious  adverse  reactions  occurred  in 12/662  (1.8%)  of patients  treated  with tedizolid  (200 mg 
oral/intravenous  once  daily  for 6 days).  Tedizolid  (200 mg oral/intravenous  once  daily  for 6 
days)  was discontinued  due to an adverse  reaction  in 3/662  (0.5%)  of patients.  
 
The most  common  adverse  reactions  in patients  treated  with tedizolid  (200 mg oral/intravenous  
once  daily  for 6 days)  were  nausea  (8%),  headache  (6%),  diarrhea  (4%),  vomiting  (3%),  and 
dizziness  (2%).  The median  time of onset  of adverse  reactions  was 5 days for both tedizolid(200  
mg oral/intravenous  once  daily  for 6 days)  with 12% occurring  on the second  day of treatment.  
 
The following  selected  adverse  reactions  were  reported  in tedizolid-treated  patients  at a rate of 
less than 2% in the pooled  Phase  3 ABSSSI  clinical  trials:  
Blood  and Lymphatic  System  Disorders:  anemia  
Cardiovascular:  palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814],  tachycardia

Safety  Monitor  ([CONTACT_628415])  will review  all safety  data (including  labs, vital signs,  results  of 
peripheral  neuropathy  scales,  and all reported  adverse  events,  side effects,  complications,  or 
other  patient  feedback)  every  three  months  or after [ADDRESS_837366]. 
If there  is a statistically  significant  side effects,  the Principal  Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or  the Data  and 
Safety  Monitor  for the study,  will consider  reporting  this to the IRB if the side effects  are felt to

be or become  pregnant.  
Per the [COMPANY_006]  Package  Insert,  there  are no adequate  and well-controlled  studies  of tedizolid  in 
pregnant  women.  In embryo-fetal  studies,  tedizolid  phosphate  was shown  to produce  fetal 
developmental  toxicities  in mice,  rats, and rabbits.  Fetal  developmental  effects  occurring  in mice  
in the absence  of maternal  toxicity  included  reduced  fetal weights  and an increased  incidence  of 
costal  cartilage  anomalies  at the high dose of 25 mg/kg/day  (4-fold  the estimated  human  
exposure  level  based  on AUCs).  In rats, decreased  fetal weights  and increased  skeletal  variations  
including  reduced  ossification  of the sternebrae,  vertebrae,  and skull  were  observed  at the high 
dose of 15 mg/kg/day  (6-fold  the estimated  human  exposure  based  on AUCs)  and were  
associated  with maternal  toxicity  (reduced  maternal  body  weights).  In rabbits,  reduced  fetal 
weights  but no malformations  or variations  were  observed  at doses  associated  with maternal  
toxicity.  The no observed  adverse  effect  levels  (NOAELs)  for fetal toxicity  in mice  (5 
mg/kg/day),  maternal  and fetal toxicity  in rats (2.5 mg/kg/day),  and rabbits  (1 mg/kg/day)  were  
associated  with tedizolid  plasma  area under  the curve  (AUC)  values  approximately  equivalent  to 
(mice  and rats) or 0.04-fold  (rabbit)  the tedizolid  AUC  value  associated  with the oral human  
therapeutic  dose.  In a pre-postnatal  study,  there  were  no adverse  maternal  or offspring  effects  
when  female  rats were  treated  during  pregnancy  and lactation  with tedizolid  phosphate  at the 
highest  tested  dose of 3.75 mg/kg/day,  with plasma  tedizolid  exposure  (AUC)  approximately  
equivalent  to the human  plasma  AUC  exposure  at the clinical  dose of 200 mg/day.

Tedizolid  is excreted  in the breast  milk of rats. It is not known  whether  tedizolid  is excreted  in 
human  milk.  Because  many  drugs  are excreted  in human  milk,  caution  should  be exercised  when  
tedizolid  is administered  to a nursing  woman.  In this study,  nursing  mothers  will be excluded.  
 
11) Potential  Benefits  to Subjects*  
Describe  the potential  benefits  that individual  subjects  may experience  from  taking  part in the 
research.  Include  as may be useful  for the HSC’s  consideration,  the probability,  magnitude,  and 
duration  of the potential  benefits.   
 
Given  the large  and increasing  burden  of disease  of bone  and joint infection  and the increasing  
acceptability  of oral antibiotics  for its management,  tedizolid  holds  promise  as a well-tolerated  
oral therapy  that can be used for patients  with bone  and joint infection  when  intravenous  options  
are not pursued  and other  oral options  are problematic.  Tedizolid  has been  shown  to have  less 
hematologic  and neurologic  side effects  in animals  compared  to similar  drugs  in its class,  
specifically  linezolid.  However,  these  advantages  have  not been  evaluated  in humans  and may 
not occur.   
Indicate  if there  is no direct  benefit.  Do not include  benefits  to society  or others.

12) Provisions  to Protect  the Privacy  Interests  of Subjects  
Describe  the steps  that will be taken  to protect  subjects’  privacy  interests.  “Privacy  interest”  
refers  to a person’s  desire  to place  limits  on whom  they interact  or whom  they provide  personal  
information.   
Every  effort  will be taken  to make  subjects  feel at ease with the research,  and all interactions  
with subjects  will take place  in a private  setting.  
Describe  what  steps  you will take to make  the subjects  feel at ease with the research  situation  in 
terms  of the questions  being  asked  and the procedures  being  performed.  “At ease”  does not refer  
to physical  discomfort,  but the sense  of intrusiveness  a subject  might  experience  in response  to 
questions,  examinations,  and procedures.  
In an effort  to make  subjects  feel at ease with the research,  all interactions  with subjects  will take 
place  in a private  setting.  The study  procedures  (obtaining  health  information,  collection  of blood  
samples,  etc.) will be performed  in a private  setting,  such as an exam  room.  
 
Indicate  how the research  team  is permitted  to access  any sources  of information  about  the 
subjects.  
Only  study  team  members  and the study  investigator  will have  access  to the subjects’  
information  with permission  from  the subject  (See Protected  Health  Information  Form,  V1.0).

patients  with limited  or no treatment  options,  socially  and economically  disadvantaged).  
 Lack  comprehension  of the research  and its risks  (e.g.,  educationally  disadvantaged,  
dementia,  schizophrenia,  or depression).  
 Are at risk for economic,  social,  or legal  consequences  from  the study  (e.g.,  individuals  who 
would  have  to answer  study  survey  questions  about  their  drug  use or HIV status).  
Indicate  specifically  whether  you will include  or exclude  each  of the following  special  
populations:  
 Adults  unable  to consent-EXCLUDED  
 Individuals  who are not yet adults  (infants,  children,  teenagers)-EXCLUDED  
 Pregnant  women-EXCLUDED  
 Prisoners-EXCLUDED  
(You  may not include  members  of the above  populations  as subjects  in your  research  unless  
you indicate  this in your  inclusion  criteria.)  
If the Human  Research  involves  cognitively  impaired  adults,  review  the “CHECKLIST:  Criteria  
for Research  Involving  Cognitively  Impaired  Adults”  to ensure  that you have  provided  sufficient  
information.

PROTOCOL TITLE: Tolerability, Safety, and Efficacy of Tedizolid as Oral Treatment for Bone and Joint 
Infection 
Revised: 8/10/[ADDRESS_837369]  not attained  the legal  age for consent  to 
treatments  or procedures  involved  in the research  (“children”),  review  the “CHECKLIST:  
Criteria  for Research  Involving  Children”  to ensure  that you have  provided  sufficient  
information.  
If the Human  Research  involves  pregnant  women,  review  the “CHECKLIST:  Criteria  for 
Research  Involving  Pregnant  Women”  to ensure  that you have  provided  sufficient  information.  
If the Human  Research  involves  neonates  of uncertain  viability  or non-viable  neonates,  review  
the “CHECKLIST:  Criteria  for Research  Involving  Neonates”  to ensure  that you have  provided  
sufficient  information.  
18) Drugs  or Devices  
If the Human  Research  involves  drugs  or device,  describe  your plans  to store,  handle,  and 
administer  those  drugs  or devices  so that they will be used only on subjects  and be used only by 
[CONTACT_441424].  
Tedizolid  200 mg oral tablets  will be stored  at and dispensed  by [CONTACT_628406]  (IDS)  by [CONTACT_628407].  The IDS will maintain  a drug dispensation  log and provide  to the investigator  at the 
end of the study.   
 
Because  this study  is using  tedizolid  for longer  than the FDA  approved  duration,  we have  
received  an IND (133495)  which  was approved  to proceed  on 1/12/17.  The study  drug will be 
prescribed/administered  as prolonged  antibiotic  therapy  for a duration  of time based  on the 
judgment  of the primary/consulting  physician  who is treating  the subject’s  bone  and joint 
infection.  
 
19) Multi-Site  Human  Research*  
 
Not Applicable  – not a multi-site  study.  
 
If this is a multi-site  study  where  you are the lead investigator,  describe  the processes  to ensure  
communication  among  sites,  such as: 
 All sites have  the most  current  version  of the protocol,  consent  document,  and HIPAA  
authorization.  
 All required  approvals  have  been  obtained  at each  site (including  approval  by [CONTACT_779]’s  
HSC  of record).   
 All modifications  have  been  communicated  to sites,  and approved  (including  approval  by 
[CONTACT_779]’s  HSC  of record)  before  the modification  is implemented.  
 All engaged  participating  sites will safeguard  data as required  by [CONTACT_628408].  
 All local  site investigators  conduct  the study  appropriately.  
 All non-compliance  with the study  protocol  or applicable  requirements  will reported  in 
accordance  with local  policy.  
Describe  the method  for communicating  to engaged  participating  sites:

20) Community-Based  Participatory  Research  
Describe  involvement  of the community  in the design  and conduct  of the research.   
Note:  “Community-based  Participatory  Research”  is a collaborative  approach  to research  that 
equitably  involves  all partners  in the research  process  and recognizes  the unique  strengths  that 
each  brings.  Community-based  Participatory  Research  begins  with a research  topic  of 
importance  to the community,  has the aim of combining  knowledge  with action  and achieving  
social  change  to improve  health  outcomes  and eliminate  health  disparities.  
Not Applicable  
21) Sharing  of Results  with  Subjects  
Describe  whether  results  (study  results  or individual  subject  results,  such as results  of 
investigational  diagnostic  tests,  genetic  tests,  or incidental  findings)  will be shared  with subjects  
or others  (e.g.,  the subject’s  primary  care physicians)  and if so, describe  how it will be shared.  
Any clinically  significant  (as determined  by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Loren  Miller  or [CONTACT_628416])  lab, 
culture,  or survey  results  (See Data  Collection  Fields,  V1.[ADDRESS_837370])  or other  
incidental  findings  will be shared  with the subject  and their primary  care providers  if clinically  
indicated.

3.4 Interventions and Duration  
One-time telehealth ACP visit with a primary care provider team member, the patient, and their care 
partner (optional). The visit will focus on disease understanding, prognosis (if ap propriate), eliciting 
overall health -related goals and values, identification of meaning in life, unacceptable care states, the 
role of surrogate decision -maker, and end -of-life wishes.  
3.5 Sample Size and Population  
A sample size of 300 patients and their ca re partner (optional) with recognized or probable MCI or mild 
dementia . 
In addition, up to 50 primary care providers who participated in our intervention will be approached to 
complete a RedCap survey at the end of the intervention.

6. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
6.1 Primary Objective  
Evaluate the reach and adoption of a telehealth ACP intervention among patients with  either  mild 
cognitive impairment, mild dementia,  or unrecognized dementia.  
H1: We hypothesize that at least 50% of 300 participants (N=100) will agree to participate and at least 
90% of those who agree to participate (N=80) will complete the telehealth ACP intervention.  
6.2 Secondary Objectives  
To evaluate the implementation of the telehealth ACP intervention by [CONTACT_319965].  
H2: We hypothesize that at least 80% of the completed telehealth ACP visits will be  
high-quality in nature. Discussion quality wi ll be operationalized using a scoring system  
derived from the ACPWise documentation program.36 High -quality ACP discussions will  
be defined as addressing ≥4 of the 9 core components in the ACP discussion: Disease understanding, 
health -related goals, what matters most in their life, important  
milestones, health -related worries, named surrogate decision -maker, unacceptable states  
at the end -of-life (e.g. being in a coma, etc.), goals if their health was to worsen, and documentation of 
code status.

Version 2  7. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
7.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus  
Dementia is a prevalent cause of death, despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] l ow recognition as a terminal disease, is characterized by 
[CONTACT_319966].6 Given the limited prognostic awareness and compromised capacity that occurs as 
the disease progresses, persons living with dementia (PLWD) often undergo aggressive and burdensome 
treatments at the end  of life.7-13 This makes PLWD an ideal population for early participation in 
Advance Care Planning (ACP) .[ADDRESS_394824] 
limited capacity.14 Thus there is a critical need for ACP interventions that target PLWD early in the 
disease course and that involve their surrogate decision -maker/caregiver to enhance goal -concordant 
care.  
7.2 Rationale:   
The COVID -[ADDRESS_394825] of dementia care.27-31 Telehealth 
has the potential to overcome barriers related to timing and travel r estraints and to provide patients and 
their caregivers with an opportunity to discuss their goals, values , and priorities for their healthcare 
within their home setting; prioritizing “aging in place”.33 Telehealth has been proven to improve patient 
safety through the use of medication reminders, caregiver education support, and wandering -prevention 
tracking; and has led to decrease caregiver burden.33-[ADDRESS_394826] a telehealth ACP 
intervention among patient -care partner dyads in those with either mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or 
unrecognized dementia. The goal is to evaluate the reach and adoption of ACP Telehealth intervention 
among those with either mild cognitive impairment, mild dementia, or unrecogniz ed dementia.  
 
8. STUDY DESIGN  
8.1 Design:  
This is a pragmatic pi[INVESTIGATOR_319954] 300 patients with either mild cognitive impairment, mild dementia,  
or unrecognized dementia and their care partner will be approached to participate in a telehealth ACP 
visit with a member of their primary care team. Patients are still eligible to participate in the study even 
if a care partner/loved one does not attend the ACP visit with them. Our goal is to pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -test and evaluate 
a pragmatic Telehealth ACP intervention among patien ts with either unrecognized dementia or with the 
diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia.  
 
8.2 Outcomes:  
Primary outcomes : will be reach and adoption.  
 
1. Reach will be defined as the proportion of eligible patient or patient -care partner dyads who agree 
12 
Version 2  to participate.  
 
2. Adoption  will be defined as the proportion of patients or patient -care partner dyads who complete 
the ACP telehealth intervention.  
 
Secondary outcomes :  
 
1) Documented advance care planning discussion rates  
a) Documented in the ACPwise documentation template within the electronic health record.  
b) Reported as the number of discussed documented within the electronic health record. Completed 
determines better outcome.  
 
2) Advance Care Planning Billing code usage  
a) ACP billing codes: [ZIP_CODE] and [ZIP_CODE] usages will be recorded.  
b) Usage of ACP Billing codes determines better outcome.  
 
3) Quality of APC documentation  
a) Documented in the ACPwise documentation templat e within the electronic health record.  
b) Score of 0 (indicates no advance care planning questions answered) to 9 (indicates nine advance 
care planning questions answered)  
c) High -quality ACP discussions will be defined as addressing ≥4 of the 9 core components in the 
ACP discussion , with 1 point assigned if the following factors were addressed as part of the 
ACP discussion:  Disease understanding, health -related goals, what matters most in their life, 
important milestones, health -related worries, named surrogate decision -maker, unacceptable 
states at the end -of-life (e.g. being in a coma, etc.), goals if their health was to w orsen, and 
documentation of code status.  
  
Exploratory Outcomes  will include the estimated cost of delivering the intervention, the number of 
ACP visits completed with a care partner/loved one vs those without a care partner/loved one, the 
number of advanc e directives (AD) completed and uploaded into the EHR, and the rates of emergency 
room and inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. We will also survey PCPs and patient adopters to assess 
acceptability, appropriateness, and satisfaction with the intervention. F idelity to the model will also be 
assessed by [CONTACT_7458] a patient had to be contact[CONTACT_319967], number of 
patients or patient -care partner dyads who do not show up to their Telehealth visit, the number of visits 
completed by [CONTACT_162520], and by [CONTACT_98991], the number of patients or patient -care partner dyads who have 
technological difficulty and are unable to be contact[CONTACT_319968], number of visits in which 
the ACPWise documentation tool was used by [CONTACT_21122], and time lag be tween agreeing to participate 
and actually conducting their telehealth ACP visit. We will also examine the percentage that eRADAR 
identifies patients within the EHR who  do or do not  also have diagnostic codes for cognitive 
impairment.  
8.3 Sample:  
300 patients and their care partners  (if available)  will be approach ed for the study.  
 
In addition, up to 50 primary care providers who participated in the study will be approached to 
complete a RedCap survey at the end of the intervention.  
8.4 Setting:  
Wake Forest Baptist Health, in collaboration with a physician -led group focused on value -based care 
13 
Version 2  (CHESS Health Solutions), is affiliated with an ACO program that incorporates more than [ADDRESS_394827], participants will be 
recruited from 7 primary care clinics and an additional clinic will be added if needed to meet recruitme nt 
numbers  
 
8.5 Study Duration:  
One-time telehealth ACP visit with a member of the patient’s primary care team.  
 
8.6 Intervention and Interactions  
Patients  
This is a pragmatic pi[INVESTIGATOR_43297]  300 patients with either mild cognitive impairment, mild dementia,  
or unrecognized dementia and their care partners  (if available) will be approached to participate in a 
telehealth ACP visit with a member of the patient’s primary care team. Patients without willing or 
available care partners are still eligible to participate in the study. A list of eligible patients will be 
identified from the EHR using a combination of diagnosis codes and a novel risk prediction model for 
unrecognized dementia. The list will be provided to each corresponding site for the primar y care 
physician to advise on the patient’s capacity. Patients in which PCPs confirmed capacity will be 
approached first by [CONTACT_319969]. 
Patients will be asked if they have a care p artner to join them in the visit. Depending on the patients’ 
response, care partners’ will be approached for participation. For patients and care partners that agree to 
participate, a dyad telehealth ACP visit will be scheduled. For patients who agree to p articipate but their 
care partners refused or patients who cannot identify a care partner to participate in the telehealth ACP 
visit, the visit will be scheduled only with the patient. Appointment information and reminders will be 
provided to the patient a nd care partner by [CONTACT_2319], email, portal, telephone , and/or text messaging.  Patients 
will be either be mailed  (if we don’t have a current email address or if patients prefer mail)  or sent via 
email through RedCap an after -visit survey to assess patient’s acc eptability and appropriateness using 
the validated Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM)40 and Inte rvention Appropriateness Measure 
(IAM)40, and overall satisfaction with the intervention. For patients who either don’t have current email 
address or prefer mail, a self-addressed stamped envelope will be provided for patients to mail back their 
survey.  All patients who complete the survey will be entered into a raffle for a $[ADDRESS_394828].  
 
 
Providers  
Once telehealth ACP visits are completed, we will reach out up to 50 providers via email who 
participated in the intervention and invite them to complete a one -time RedCap survey that assesses 
acceptability and appropriateness using the validated Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM)40 and 
Interv ention Appropriateness Measure (IAM)40, and overall satisfaction with the intervention. Providers 
will receive an email  with a link to complete the survey. Completion of the survey will signify consent. 
If incomplete, providers will be sent a reminder email 2 weeks later to complete the survey. If still 
incomplete, providers will be contact[CONTACT_5143] 2 weeks later. Al l providers who complete the 
survey will be entered into a raffle for a $[ADDRESS_394829] recognized or probable MCI or mild dementia AND retain the 
decisional capacity to complete ACP. Patients will be identified through the EHR in one of two ways: 
(a) diagnosis codes (ICD -10) for MCI/Dementia or (b) the EHR Risk of Alzheimer's  and Dementia 
Assessment Rule  (eRADAR41) prediction model. The use of eRADAR will help to circumvent the 
reality that diagnostic codes for cognitive impairment are vastly underutilized;42 eRADAR utilizes 
dementia -related symptoms and risk factors as well as healthcare utilization from the EHR to identify 
patients with probable unrecognized dementia (a high likelihood of dementia/cognitive impairment in 
the absenc e of diagnosis codes).[ADDRESS_394830] of care. However, w e are modifying this process by 
[CONTACT_67940] a telehealth option to enhance documentation of the ACP visit. Therefore, we will obtain 
clinical consent for the telehealth visit from patients and care partners; patients and care partners are free 
to decline a telehealth visit for an ACP discussion.  
A list of eligible patients at participating sites will be generated and will be distributed to each patient’s 
PCP to advise on the patient’s decision -making capacity.   
 
If lack of capacity is assessed when patien ts are approached or after con sent, we will call the patient 
back and use the following language: “when talking with your primary care provider, they thought 
actually it would be best to discuss  advance care planning at your upcoming in -person visit instea d of 
through an extra telehealth visit.”   
 
A recruitment letter/postcard will be sent to patients whose PCPs confirm capacity. The research team 
will approach patients via telephone for participation with a waiver of informed consent. Patients will be 
asked if they have a care partner /loved one  to join them in the visit. Depending on the patients’ response, 
care partners /loved ones ’ will be approached for participation. Upon participant agreement, a telehealth 
15 
Version 2  ACP visit will be scheduled. For patients whos e care partner /loved one  agrees to participate, a dyad 
telehealth ACP visit will be scheduled. For patients who agreed to participate but care partner/loved one  
refuse s or patients who cannot identify a care partner /loved one  to participate in the teleheal th ACP visit, 
the visit will be scheduled only with the patient. Appointment information will be sent to patients and 
care partners through a variety of communication channels  per patient’s preference  (email, mailing, 
portal, telephone, and/or text messagi ng). The research staff will give a telephone call reminder  and 
ensure understanding on how to set up the telehealth visit  to the patient and care partner/loved one day 
before the appointment  (except for Monday appointments and then the reminder call will occur the 
Friday prior to the appointment)  in addition to sending reminders through a variety of communication 
channels per patient’s preference (email, mailing, portal, and /or text messaging ). We will document 
reasons for ineligibility and non -participation of eligible candidates in a study tracking log.  We will also 
record the date of acceptance or non -acceptance for the telehealth ACP visit participation. Participants 
will not be compensat ed for participating in the telehealth ACP visit. After completion of the visit, 
patients will be either be mailed (if we don’t have a current email address or if patients prefer mail) or 
sent via email through RedCap an after -visit survey to assess patien t’s acceptability and appropriateness 
using the validated Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM)40 and Intervention Appropriateness 
Measure (IAM)40, and overall satisfaction with the intervention. For patie nts who either don’t have 
current email address or prefer USPS mail, a self -addressed , stamped envelope will be provided for 
patients to mail back their survey. All patients who complete the survey will be entered into a raffle for a 
$[ADDRESS_394831].  
 
There are special informed consent considerations for individuals in this pragmatic study.  We will seek 
a waiver of individual informed consent as set forth by [CONTACT_319970] 45 CFR 46:116:  
(i) the research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects;  
(ii)  the research could not practicably be carried out without the reques ted waiver or alteration;  
(iii) if the research involves using identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, the 
research could not practicably be carried out without using such information or biospecimens in 
an identifiable format;  
(iv) (the waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare o f the subjects; and  
(v) whenever appropriate, the subjects  or legally authorized representatives will be provided with 
additional pertinent information after participation.  
We will also request a full HIPAA waiver  of individual authorization as set forth by [CONTACT_319971]:  
(1) Use or disclosure involve s no more than minimal risk to the privacy of individuals because of the 
presence of at least the following elements:  
• An adequate plan to protect health information identifiers from improper use or disclosure,  
• An adequate plan to destroy identifiers at the  earliest opportunity absent a health or research 
justification or legal requirement to retain them, and  
• Adequate written assurances that the PHI will not be used or disclosed to a third party except as 
required by [CONTACT_2371], for authorized oversight of the rese arch study, or for other research uses and 
disclosures permitted by [CONTACT_72383];  
(2) Research could not practicably be conducted without the waiver  or alteration; and  
(3) Research could not practicably be conducted without access to and use of PHI.  
[ADDRESS_394832] study participants for 
clinical consent.  As part of the pragmatic nature of the study, sample eligibility relies on a review of the 
PHI, and study outcomes will be retrieved from electronic health records as well.  
 
Patient after -visit survey  
A waiver of signed informed consent is also requested for a dopters, those patients who complete the 
telemedicine ACP visit with a member of their primary care team  since the survey  poses no more than 
minimal risk of harm to par ticipants and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally 
required outside of the research context, we are requesting a waiver of informed consent.  After a patient 
completes their telehealth ACP visit , they will be asked to complete a one -time survey to assess 
acceptability and appropriateness using 2 validated surveys, the Acceptability of Intervention Measure 
(AIM)40 and the Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM)40, as well as overall satisfaction with the 
intervention. P atients will be either be mailed (if we don’t have a current email address or if patients 
prefer mail) or sent via email through RedCap the survey. For patients who are mailed  the survey,  a self -
addressed , stamped envelope will be provided for patients to mail back their survey. All patients who 
complete the survey will be entered into a raffle for a $[ADDRESS_394833].  
 
We will seek a waiver of signed informed consent as set forth by [CONTACT_319972] 45 CFR 46:116:

be carried out without the requested waiver or alteration; (iii) if the research involves using identifiable 
private i nformation or identifiable biospecimens, the research could not practicably be carried out 
without using such information or biospecimens in an identifiable format; (iv) the waiver or alteration 
will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subje cts; and (v) whenever appropriate, the 
subjects or legally authorized representatives will be provided with additional pertinent information after 
participation.  
 
Providers  
A waiver of signed informed consent is also requested for primary care providers facilitating the 
intervention. Once the telehealth ACP visits are completed, PCPs will be asked to complete a one -time 
REDCap survey to assess acceptability and appropriateness using 2 validated surveys, the Acceptability 
of Intervention Measure (AIM)40 and the Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM)40, as well as 
overall satisfaction with the intervention. Providers will receive an email with a link to complete the 
survey. Completion of the survey w ill signify consent. If incomplete, providers will be sent a reminder 
email 2 weeks later to complete the survey. If still incomplete, providers will be contact[CONTACT_5143] 
2 weeks later. All providers who complete the survey will be entered into a raff le for a $[ADDRESS_394834].

[ADDRESS_394835] of eligible patients at participating sites will be generated and will be distributed to each patient’s 
PCP to advise on the patient’s decision -making capacity. A recruitment postcard will be sent to patients 
whose PCPs confirm capacity. The researc h team will approach patients via telephone using a script to 
describe the purpose of the ACP visit and inquire about their willingness to participate. Patients will be 
asked if they have a care partner /loved one  to join them in the visit. Depending on the  patients’ response, 
care partners /loved ones ’ will be approached for participation. Upon participant agreement, a telehealth 
ACP visit will be scheduled. For patients whose care partner/loved one agrees to participate, a dyad 
telehealth ACP visit will be scheduled. For patients who agreed to participate but care partner /loved 
ones refuse or patients who cannot identify a care partner /loved one  to participate in the telehealth ACP 
visit, the visit will be scheduled only with the patient.  
 
We will send the p atient and care partner /loved one  appointment information through a variety of 
communication channels per the patient’s pre ference (email, mailing, or portal/mychart ) that will 
include the date of the visit and what to expect during the visit. Patients and  care partners will receive a 
telephone call to reminder them of the appointment and to ensure understanding on how to set up the 
telehealth visit to the patient and care partner/loved one day before the appointment (except for Monday 
appointments and then  the reminder call will occur the F riday prior to the appointment). I n addition , we 
will text patients a reminder message if they have phone with texting capabilities . The telehealth ACP 
visit will consist of a member from the patient’s primary care team ( physician assistant, nurse 
practitioner, physician) discussing ACP with the patient and if they have one, their care partner /loved 
one. The visit will focus on disease understanding, prognosis (if appropriate), eliciting overall health -
related goals and va lues, identification of meaning in life, unacceptable care states, the role of surrogate 
decision -maker, and end -of-life wishes. The sites will utilize our ACPWise documentation tool to help 
facilitate, document, and bill for these visits. The primary care  provider team will use clinical judgment 
to determine capacity to make clinical decisions, and if they feel the patient lacks capacity, they will rely 
on the patient’s care partner /loved one  for any clinical decisions. Participants will not be compensated  
for participation in the telehealth ACP visit . After a patient completes their telehealth ACP visit , they 
will be asked to complete a one -time survey to assess acceptability and appropriateness using 2 
validated surveys, the Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM)40 and the Intervention 
Appropriateness Measure (IAM)40, as well as overall satisfaction with the intervention. P atients will be 
either be mailed (if we don’t have a current email address or if patients prefer mail) or sent via email 
through RedCap the survey. For patients who are mailed the survey, a self -addressed , stamped envelope 
will be provided for patients to mail back their survey. All patients who complete the survey will be 
entere d into a raffle for a $[ADDRESS_394836].  
 
 
Providers  
Once the Telehealth ACP visits are completed, we will reach out via email to all the providers who 
participated in the intervention and invite them to complete a one -time RedCap sur vey that assesses 
acceptability, appropriateness , and overall satisfaction with the intervention. Completion of the survey 
will signify consent. If incomplete, providers will be sent a reminder email 2 weeks later to complete the 
survey. If still incomplet e, providers will be contact[CONTACT_5143] 2 weeks later. All providers who 
complete the survey will be entered into a raffle for a $[ADDRESS_394837] facilitated the intervention will be asked to complete a REDCap survey  and patient 
adopters will be asked to complete a survey  to assess acceptability and appropriateness using 2 validated 
surveys: Acceptabilit y of Intervention Measure (AIM) and Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM) 
along with overall satisfaction with the intervention.  
 
12. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
Potential risks include that some individuals may find ACP discussion to be uncomfortable, stressful , 
and/or depressing. This is expected to be temporary. All study staff and providers will be trained to deal 
with these situations and every effort will be made to address each participant’s concerns or problems in 
the most supporti ve, empathic, and therapeutic manner. The potential benefits of this intervention may 
include overcoming barriers to ACP related to timing and travel restraints and providing  patients and 
their care partners with an expanded opportunity to discuss their go als, values, and priorities for 
healthcare at the comfort of their home. We foresee that the potential benefits outweigh the potential 
risks of the intervention.  
All study staff and/or providers will be trained to identify cues for discomfort, stress , and anxiety during 
the discussion of advance care planning, paying special attention to body language. Once cues have been 
identified, staff and/or providers will point out discomfort and ask the participant if they do not feel 
comfortable pursuing the discus sion any longer and that they have the right to skip or end the advance 
care planning discussion at any time. We will make every effort to address each participant’s concerns 
or problems in the most supportive, empathic, and therapeutic manner. If the part icipant wishes to skip 
or discontinue the advance care planning discussion, the staff and/or provider will send a message 
describing the event to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_319955]. However, we do not foresee having  AEs and SAEs as 
this study presents no more than m inimal risk of harm.  
12.1 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
We do not foresee having  SAEs as this study presents no more than minimal risk of harm.  
 
Definitions for adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) to be used for this trial:  
AE De finition: AE is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human study participant, 
including any abnormal sign of increased stress/anxiety or discomfort, temporally associated with the 
participants’ involvement in the research, whether or not con sidered related to participation in the 
research.  
 
AEs for this study include : Discomfort with ACP discussion, increased stress/anxiety. These events are 
no more than minimal risk of harm.  
 
SAE Definition: SAEs consist of any adverse event that results in death; is life -threatening or places the 
participant at immediate risk of deat h from the event as it occurred; requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
causes persistent or significant disability or incapacity; results in congenital anomalies or birth defects; 
is another condition which investigators judge to represent significant haza rds 
19 
Version 2   
SAEs for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_101656]: We do not foresee having  SAEs as this study presents no more than 
minimal risk of harm.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_394838] 
Collaboratory will be notified within 24 hours.  
12.3 Safety Monitoring  
The Principal Investigator (PI) will be responsible for ensuring participants’ safety daily . In addition, the 
NIA IMPACT Collaboratory has assigned a  Project Safety Officer to oversee all data and safety 
monitoring activities for this study. The Project Safety Officer will act in an advisory capacity to the 
NIA Director to monitor participant safety, evaluate the progress of the study, and review proce dures for 
maintaining the confidentiality of data, the quality of data collection, management, and analyses.  
Refer to the NIA IMPACT Collaboratory Omnibus DSMB Charter for details.  
 
13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Sample Size and Randomization  
Two hundred individuals with either mild cognitive impairment (MCI), mild dementia,  or unrecognized 
dementia will be approached to participate in a Telehealth ACP visit. In addition, if eligible patients have 
a care partner, we will approach them for parti cipation in a dyad ACP visit (patient + care partner). In our 
previous randomized trial of a nurse -navigator ACP pathway (IMPACT),43 139 of 294 patients consented 
and completed the ACP intervention. If we assume a conservative Beta((139/10)+0.5,(155/10)+0.5) prior 
distri bution for this rate, this presumes a prior mean rate of adoption = 47% (min=17%, 25th 
percentile=41%, 75th percentile = 53%, max=83%). Based on simulations, if we approach [ADDRESS_394839] that a median of 94 participants will consent to p articipate and complete the telehealth 
intervention (25th percentile = 81, 75th percentile = 108). In >70% of our simulations, the posterior 
probability that the estimated intervention completion (adoption) rate is ≥40% was >0.70, thus we believe 
our propo sed sample size will be adequate to judge whether an appropriate number of persons with 
unrecognized dementia or MCI will complete the ACP telehealth intervention. We do plan to oversample 
to have at least 20% of our population from racial/ethnic minority population.  If we have issues obtaining 
20%, we will try and use the area deprivation index to target at least 20% from a socioeconomic 
disadvantage group.  
 
13.2 Outcomes  
Primary outcomes : will be reach and adoption.  
 
1. Reach will be defined as the proportion of eligible patient or patient -care partner dyads who agree to 
participate.  
 
2. Adoption  will be defined as the proportion of patients or patient -care partner dyads who complete the 
20 
Version 2  ACP telehealth intervention.  
 
Secondary outcomes:  
1) Documented advance care planning discussion rates  
a) Documented in the ACPwise documentation template within the electronic health record.  
b) Reported as the number of discussed documented within the electronic health record. Completed 
determines better outcome.  
 
2) Advance Care Plan ning Billing code usage  
a) ACP billing codes: [ZIP_CODE] and [ZIP_CODE] usages will be recorded.  
b) Usage of ACP Billing codes determines better outcome.  
 
3) Quality of APC documentation  
a) Documented in the ACPwise documentation template within the electronic health record.  
b) Score of 0 (indicates no advance care planning questions answered) to 9 (indicates nine advance 
care planning questions answered)  
c) High -quality ACP discussions will be defined as addressing ≥4 of the 9 core components in the 
ACP discussion, with 1 p oint assigned if the following factors were addressed as part of the 
ACP discussion: Disease understanding, health -related goals, what matters most in their life, 
important milestones, health -related worries, named surrogate decision -maker, unacceptable 
states at the end -of-life (e.g. being in a coma, etc.), goals if their health was to worsen, and 
documentation of code status.  
 
Exploratory Outcomes  will include the estimated cost of delivering the intervention, the number of 
ACP visits completed with a car e partner /loved one  vs those without a care partner /loved one , the 
number of advance directives (AD) completed and uploaded into the EHR, and the rates of emergency 
room and inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]. We will also survey PCPs and patient adopters to asses s 
acceptability, appropriateness, and satisfaction with the intervention. Fidelity to the model will also be 
assessed by [CONTACT_7458] a patient had to be contact[CONTACT_319967], number of 
patients or patient -care partner dyads who do not show up to their Telehealth visit, the number of visits 
completed by [CONTACT_756] , and by [CONTACT_98991], the number of patients or patient -care partner dyads who have 
technological difficulty and are unable to be contact[CONTACT_319968], nu mber of visits in which 
the ACPWise documentation tool was used by [CONTACT_21122], and time lag between agreeing to participate 
and actually conduc ting their telehealth ACP visit . We will also examine the percentage that eRADAR 
identifies patients within the EHR who also have diagnostic code s for cognitive impairment.  
 
13.[ADDRESS_394840] will be largely descriptive and focus on the estimation of key 
parameters for designing a subsequent embedded pragmatic clinical trial (ePCT).  We’ve chosen to 
approach the primary outcomes for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_319956] a Bayesian paradigm, as it more naturally permits 
making probability statements concerning our criteria for adoption and the quality of ACP discussions 
(i.e. that at least 40% of approached patients will complete the telehealth ACP intervention, and that 
≥80% of ACP discussion will be of high quality). Given that the primary endpoints are binary outcomes, 
we plan to use a standard conjugate Beta -Binomial hierarchical regression framework, whi ch can 
accommodate covariates as needed. We expect that we will minimally evaluate variability in adoption by 
[CONTACT_654], primary care practice / primary care provider, and by [CONTACT_319973] A lzheimer's and Dementia Assessment Rule  (eRADAR)41 or 
via diagnosis codes for MCI /ADRD .   
[ADDRESS_394841] 80% of the completed telehealth ACP visits will be high -quality in nature. 
Discussion quality will be operationalized using a scoring system  
derived from th e ACPWise documentation program.43 High -quality ACP discussions will  
be defined as addressing ≥4 of the 9 core components in the ACP discussion: Disease understanding, 
health -related goals, what matters most in their life, important milestones, health -related worries, named 
surrogate decision -maker, unacceptable states at the end -of-life (e.g. being in a coma, etc.), goals if their 
health was to worsen, and documentation of code status. A nalyses of the use of ACP billing codes and 
ACP documentati on scanned into the EHR will be based on Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) 
approaches to binary outcomes. A focus of these models, beyond estimating event frequencies, will be the 
estimation of intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) by [CONTACT_319974]/primary care provider.[ADDRESS_394842]. In o rder to 
obtain reliable estimates,45 note that analyses of utilization and burdensome treatment will be based on the 
entire population of individuals within Accountable Care Organizations affiliated with our health system 
identified by [CONTACT_319975]. Data on emergency department visits and 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_319957], discharge, and transfer data 
from a national transitional care network (PatientPi[INVESTIGATOR_007], www.patientpi[INVESTIGATOR_007].com ) in order to capture 
utilization out side of our health system. Analyses will utilize time -to-event approaches that can 
accommodate recurrent events and the competing risk of death.46,[ADDRESS_394843] (IRB) Review  
This protocol and any subsequent modifications will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_319976].  
15.[ADDRESS_394844] a waiver of informed consent for research purposes, noting that a waiver of 
individua l informed consent is set forth by [CONTACT_319970] 45 CFR 46:116:  
(i) the research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects;  
the activities in our protocol involve subjects meeting with their PCP through Telehealth to discuss 
[ADDRESS_394845] a 
conversation with their PCP in the comfort of their home, therefore, our research involves no more than 
minimal risk to subjects; ACP , in general,  is standard of care and the addition of a Telehealth option 
does not increase risk;  
(ii) the research could not practicably be carried out without the requested waiver or alteration;  
we are modifying a standard of care process. This is a pragmatic trial aimed primarily a t determining 
reach and adoption of a telehealth approach to ACP in a real -world setting. Requiring informed consent 
for research purposes would undermine this goal as the process must stay as close to the standard 
process as possible and could introduce i mportant selection biases greatly reducing the knowledge 
generated;  
(iii) if the research involves using identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens, the 
research could not practicably be carried out without using such information or bios pecimens in an 
identifiable format;  
the research has access to identifiable information through the electronic medical record for identifying 
eligible patients. The study cannot be carried out without suing such information;  
(iv) the waiver or alteration w ill not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects;  
being that we also will be getting clinical consent for the Telehealth visits for subjects ( patients and 
their care partners (if they have one) are free to decline a Telehealth visit for an ACP discussion), we do 
not consider the waiver to adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects;  
(v) whenever appropriate, the subjects or legally authorized representatives will be provided with 
additional pertinent information after participati on; an effort will be made to share results of the study 
(such as published manuscripts) with the clinicians that have facilitated the intervention that could then 
share with their patients.  
 
Although a waiver of individual informed consent will be request ed for those who will be participating 
in the telehealth ACP visits, we will obtain clinical consent for the telehealth visits as would occur as 
part of the standard of care —patients and care partners are free to decline a Telehealth visit for an ACP 
discu ssion.  The study staff will verbally explain the purpose and what will take place in a Telehealth 
ACP visit to prospective participants in simple and easy to understand language. The potential 
participant will be asked if they have any questions. Study st aff will make note of the date and decision 
of patient and care partner participation in the study tracking log. Once the patient agrees to participate 
in the Telehealth ACP visit, the visit will be scheduled.  
 
This process of the waiver of inform consent and clinical consent also applies to patients who are unable 
to consent on their own behalf. The surrogate decision maker will be reached to provide participation for 
themselves and the patient in the Telehealth ACP visit.  
 
Patient after -visit survey  
A wai ver of signed informed consent is also requested for a dopters, those patients who complete the 
telemedicine ACP visit with a member of their primary care team .  Since the survey  poses no more than 
minimal risk of harm to participants and involves no proced ures for which written consent is normally 
required outside of the research context, we are requesting a waiver of informed consent.  After a patient 
completes their telehealth ACP visit , they will be asked to complete a one -time survey to assess 
acceptabil ity and appropriateness using 2 validated surveys, the Acceptability of Intervention Measure 
(AIM)40 and the Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM)40, as well as overall satisfaction with the 
intervention. P atients will be either be mailed (if we don’t have a current email address or if patients 
prefer mail) or sent via email through RedCap the survey. For patients who are mailed the survey,  a self -
23 
Version 2  addressed , stamped envelope will be provided for patien ts to mail back their survey. All patients who 
complete the survey will be entered into a raffle for a $[ADDRESS_394846].  
 
We will seek a waiver of signed informed consent as set forth by [CONTACT_319972] 45 CFR 46:116: 
(i) the research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects; (ii) the research could not practicably 
be carried out without the requested waiver or alteration; (iii) if the research involves using identifiable 
private i nformation or identifiable biospecimens, the research could not practicably be carried out 
without using such information or biospecimens in an identifiable format; (iv) the waiver or alteration 
will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subje cts; and (v) whenever appropriate, the 
subjects or legally authorized representatives will be provided with additional pertinent information after 
participation.  
 
Providers  
In addition, a waiver of sign consent is requested for primary care providers that have participated in  the 
intervention. Providers will be asked to complete a one -time REDCap survey to assess acceptability and 
appropriateness using 2 validated surveys: Ac ceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM) and 
Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM) and overall satisfaction  with the intervention . 
 
15.[ADDRESS_394847] for a full HIPAA waiver of individual aut horization as set forth by [CONTACT_319971]:  
(1) Use or disclosure involves no more than minimal risk to the privacy of individuals because of the 
presence of at least the following elements:  
•An adequate plan to protect health information identifi ers from improper use or disclosure,  
•An adequate plan to destroy identifiers at the earliest opportunity absent a health or research 
justification or legal requirement to retain them, and  
•Adequate written assurances that the PHI will not be used or discl osed to a third party except as 
required by [CONTACT_2371], for authorized oversight of the research study, or for other research uses and 
disclosures permitted by [CONTACT_72383];  
(2) Research could not practicably be conducted without the waiver or alteration; and  
(3) Research could not practicably be conducted without access to and use of PHI.  
Confidentiality will be protected by [CONTACT_117689], 
minimizing to the fullest extent possible the collection of any information  that could directly identify 
subjects, and maintaining all study information in a secure manner. To help ensure subject privacy and 
confidentiality, only a unique study identifier will appear on the data collection form. Any collected 
patient identifying information corresponding to the unique study identifier will be maintained on a 
linkage file, store separately from the data. The linkage file will be kept secure, with access limited to 
designated study personnel. Following data collection subject identi fying information will be destroyed 
three years after closure of the study , consistent with data validation and study design, producing an 
anonymous analytical data set. Data access will be limited to study staff. Data and records will be kept 
locked and s ecured, with any computer data password protected. No reference to any individual 
participant will appear in reports, presentations, or publications that may arise from the study.  
 
Patient after -visit survey  
A waiver of signed informed consent is also requ ested for adopters, those patients who complete the 
telemedicine ACP visit with a member of their primary care team .  Since the survey poses no more than 
24 
Version 2  minimal risk of harm to participants and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally 
required outside of the research context, we are requesting a waiver of informed consent. After a patient 
completes their telehealth ACP visit , they will be asked to complete a one -time survey to assess 
acceptability and appropriateness using 2 validated s urveys, the Acceptability of Intervention Measure 
(AIM)40 and the Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM)40, as well as overall satisfaction with the 
intervention. Patients will be mailed  the survey with a self -addressed , stamped envelope. Completion of 
the survey will signify consent.  
 
Providers  
We are only requesting a waiver of sign consent for p roviders that have facilitated the intervention. 
Providers will be asked to complete a one -time REDCap survey to assess acceptability and 
appropriateness using 2 validated surveys: Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM) and 
Intervention Appropriatenes s Measure (IAM) and overall satisfaction. A HIPAA waiver is not necessary 
as we will not collect any provider specific information other than acceptability and appropriateness of 
the intervention.

name]. Are you [patient’s name] ? Thank you for taking my call. We are calling because [provider’s name]  
would like to schedule a visit with you t o further discuss your current health -related goals and medical prefer-
ences.  Is this a good time for us to talk? It will take about 10 minutes. If it isn’t, I can call you at another time. 
If yes, proceeded below. If no, asked when would be a good time to  call back.  
 
Is there a loved one or care partner at home with you that you would like to hear this call? If yes, ask if they can 
put the call on speaker so that they both can hear.  
 
We are in the process of scheduling visits for [provider’s name] to tal k with his/her  patients about their current 
health -related goals and medical preferences. Specifically, [provider’s name]  wants to talk with you about your 
current health -related goals, any worries you may have about your health, and about any future medic al prefer-
ences related to the type of care you would or would not want to receive. This type of visit is called an Advance 
Care Planning visit. This visit can help your provider and others be aware of what matters most to you and helps 
them better align ca re to your goals. Our goal is to really empower patients to have a voice in what matters most 
to them to ensure they receive the type of care they want and deserve.  
 
This visit typi[INVESTIGATOR_241095] [ADDRESS_394848] already 
had a video or telephone visit with [provider’s name] or one of your other providers. We are doing these visits 
this way to make it easier on patients and their loved ones since the visits can be done in the comfort of their 
home.  
 
This Advance Care Planning visit is optional. You may choose not to schedule this visit and it will NOT affect 
the care you get from [provider’s name] . This type of visit will have the normal co -pay that you would have 
when you see your primary care provider . (The co -pay is the same whether the visit is in person or by [CONTACT_319979].) Is this something you would be interested in doing with [provider’s name] ?

BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE : 
Migraine is a chronic neurologic disorder characterized by [CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_910520], vomiti ng, photophobia and phonophobia  
(Headache Classification Committee, 2004) .  Migraine is a headache disorder often with 
unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate to severe intensity and aggravation by 
[CONTACT_238960]. Migraine prevalence is approximately 18% in women and 6% in 
men (Lipton and Silberstein, 2001; Lipton et al., 2001; Lipton et al., 2007) .  About 90%

Version: 7/31/[ADDRESS_1278496] during their migraine attacks 
(Lipton et al., 2001; Lipton et al., 2007).  Therefore, effective treatments and treatment 
strategies play a critical part in reducing the disability, burden, and cost of care for these 
patien ts (Matchar et al., 2000) .  
 
Patients that present to an ambulatory acute care setting or emergency  room with a severe 
migrain e have a limited number of treatment  options . NSAIDS, including ibuprofen, have 
been shown to be efficacious in the acute treatment of migraine. However, the use of oral 
NSAIDS is sometimes not an option, such as after abdominal surgery, or in a patient wi th 
a severe migraine, that may have emesis and digestion abnormalities such as 
gastroparesis.  IV opi[INVESTIGATOR_910521], but have the risk of respi[INVESTIGATOR_910522], as well as a high propensity for addiction. For those patients who receive 
treatme nt in the ER, opi[INVESTIGATOR_910523] 64%  of patients , despi[INVESTIGATOR_910524]  (Gupta et al., 2007).  
 
NSAIDs are not addict ive, do not cause urinary retention, constipation or ileus, in 
contrast to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. IV ibuprofen (Caldolor) has been approved by [CONTACT_910530]. Besides ibuprofen, Ketorolac (Toradol) is the only other 
NSAID available in an inj ectable form. However, ketorolac  may result in severe 
gastrointestinal side effects. Thus, IV ibuprofen may offer  another option. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_910525].  
 
 
OBJECTIVE:     
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_910526] (IVIb) 
in the treatment of an acute migraine attack .  Data will be collected on the efficacy of 
IVIb in subject s who are treated with study medication between 2 and 72 hours from time 
of onset of headache.  
 
Periodic safety and efficacy  assessments will be performed pr ior to and after study drug 
administration .  
 
 
STUDY DESIGN:  
This is a 3 visit trial : screening visit, trea tment visit, and final visit.  Screening visit  and a 
treatment visit  may occur on the same day.   Additionally, there will be one follow -up 
phone call at [ADDRESS_1278497]’s cognition is intact and the subject is able to 
understand and sign the informed consent at that time. If the potential subject’s cognition

headache -free at the time of screening.  
 
Those subjects who meet the qualifying criteria wi ll be eligible for treatment in the study. 
Subjects who qualify will be asked to come to the Jefferson Headache Center within  2 to 
72 hours following  the onset of  pain.   
 
IVIb or placebo will be administered intravenously as  the study  treatment .  For acti ve 
treatment, 800 mg of injectable  ibuprofen will be placed in 250 ml of normal saline, and 
infused over 7 -10 minutes .  (Infusion time may be increased up to 1 hour if necessary due 
to possible anatomical restrictions).   The placebo group will receive 250 ml of normal 
saline, infused over 7 -10 minutes . (Infusion time may be increased up to 1 hour if 
necessary due to possible anatomical restrictions).   Safety and efficacy assessments will 
be made periodically just prior to and after administration of study d rug.   Migra ine pain 
and associated symptom  assessments will be measured by [CONTACT_910531] [ADDRESS_1278499] study

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:  
150 subjects will be screened in or der to obtain 120 completers (60 subjects for each 
treatment group, placebo: active drug 1:1).  This should provide a power of 0.8, assuming 
an alpha of 0.05, a placebo response rate of 43%, and a response rate difference of 25% 
between placebo and active treatment.  
 
Primary end -point:  
 Comparison of p roportion of subjects in each treatment group (active treatment and 
placebo) who have pain relief at 2 hours after the completion of the double -blind 
treatment infusion. Pain relief is defined as a reduction i n headache pain level from 
severe or moderate decreased to mild or headache -free, respectively.  
 
Secondary end -points:  
 Comparison of the p roportion of subjects in each treatment group (active treatment 
and placebo) who are pain -free after the completion of  the double -blind treatment 
infusion.  
 Pain and associated symptom  assessments as measured at pre -dose, [ADDRESS_1278506] in both treatment group s. 
 Sustained pain relief over 24 hours.  
 Subject ’s historical response to NSAID therapy  compared to response to IV 
ibuprofen.  
 Occurrence of adverse events . 
 Use of rescue therapy.  
 
INTERRUPTION OR DISCONTINUATION OF TREATMENT:  
A subject may be withdrawn from  the study because of an adverse event, unsatisfactory 
therapeutic effect, protocol violation, subject’s withdrawal of consent, lost to follow -up, 
or other reason deemed medically indicated by [CONTACT_70852].

TREATMENT COMPLIANCE : 
Detailed records of st udy medication used by [CONTACT_910535]. 
Compliance to treatment will be checked by [CONTACT_910536]’s diary . 
The investigator and the study coordinator will also review drug accountability  on a 
regular basis, as each vi al is dispensed and at the completion of the trial.  The investigator 
and the clinical coordinator must maintain an accurate record of the dispensing and return 
of the study drug in a drug accountability ledger.  An accurate record of the date and 
amount o f study drug dispensed to each subject must be available for inspection at any 
time.  
 
 
SAFETY MEASURES:  
 Physical Examinations:  
Physical and neurological examinations will be performed by a study physician at the 
Screening Visit.  Weight and height will b e recorded at Visit 1. Subjects with 
clinically significant medical/psychological abnormalities, as determined by [CONTACT_1275], will be excluded from the study.  
 Vital Signs:  
Blood Pressure and pulse rate will b e recorded at Screening Visit, Treatment  Visit , 
and Fina l Visit. During Treatment Visit , vital signs will be monitored prior to study 
drug administration, [ADDRESS_1278507] -dosing.  Additional vital 
signs will be taken if clinically indicated.  
 Urine Pregnancy Tests:  
All women of childbearing potential will have pregnancy tests done at the Screening 
Visit. A negative result is required for participation.  Additional urine pregnancy tests 
will be performed at each follow -up visit.  
 Adverse Events:  
Throughout the course of the st udy, subjects will monitor any adverse effects or 
events experienced.  They will record start and stop times, intensity, and 
characteristics of these events.  This information will be collected at follow -up visits 
and Final Visit.  Subjects will be provide d a number that they may contact 24 hours a 
day to report any serious adverse events.  All adverse effects or events will be 
monitored and appropriate intervention will be applied as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1275].  Adverse events will be collected f ollowing signing of informed consent.  
 
 
Reporting of Adverse Events:   
Reporting of all adverse events will be in accordance with Good Clinical Practice.  
Information about all adverse events, whether volunteered by [CONTACT_423], discovered by 
[CONTACT_424], or detected through physical examination, laboratory test or 
other means, will be collected and recorded on the Adverse Event Form and followed up 
as appropriate.  An adverse event is any undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition 
occurri ng after starting study drug, even if the event is not considered to be related to

trial. 
Medical conditions/diseases present before starting study treatment are only c onsidered 
adverse events if they worsen after starting study treatment.  Abnormal laboratory values 
or test results constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, or 
indicate underlying pathology or require therapy.  These will b e recorded on the Adverse 
Events Form.  
As far as possible, each adverse event will also be described by:  
1. duration (start and end dates),  
2. severity grade (mild, moderate, severe)  
3. relationship to the study drug (suspected/not suspected),  
4. action(s) taken and,  as relevant, the outcome.  
 
Serious Adverse Events:  
A serious adverse event is an undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition that:  
 is fatal or life -threatening  
 requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
 is significantly or permanently disabling or incapaci tating  
 constitutes a congenital anomaly or a birth defect  
 is medically significant, may jeopardize the subject, and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
Events not considered to be serious adverse event s are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23741]:  
 treatment, which was elective or pre -planned, for a pre -existing condition that did 
not worsen;  
 treatment on an emergency, out subject basis for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of serious given abo ve and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].  
 
The Jefferson Headache Center will notify Thomas Jefferson University Institutional 
Review Board immediately in the event of a serious adverse event.  Additionally, the 
Jefferson Headache Center will notify Cum berland Pharmaceutical  of any SAE deemed

 2  INTRODUCTION 
 
OVERVIEW  
On April 18th, 2019, The Policy & Research Group reviewed the registry page for the Evaluation of Peer 
Group Connection on clinicaltrials.gov and found a few  inaccuracies in language and content. Updates 
were made to the registry to reflect the study design documented in our Evaluation Abstract (see 
Appendix B), submitted to the Office of Adolescent Health on September 18, [ADDRESS_632449] 
Analysis Plan (included below), submitted to OAH on January 31, 2019.  
 
We also outline below notable events that have affected o ur ability to implement the study as originally 
designed. Although no substantive changes have been made to the study design, we were not able to meet 
our original target sample size of 2,[ADDRESS_632450] cohort of students.

 3  1) Research Questions that Address Program Effec tiveness on Behavioral Outcomes  
 
a. Primary research question s 
 
1. What is the impact of the offer to participate in Peer Group Connection (treatment)  in ninth 
grade  relative to the offer to participate in class as usual  (control) in ninth grade on 
participants’ reported sexual initiation at the beginning of tenth grade ? 
 
2. What is the impact of the offer to participate in Peer Group Connection (treatment)  in ninth 
grade  relative to the offer to participate in class as usual  (control ) in ninth grade  on 
participants’ reported  number of sexual partners  at the beginning of tenth grade ? 
 
3. What is the impact of the offer to participate in Peer Group Connection (treatment)  in ninth 
grade  relative to the offer to participate in class as usual  (control) in ninth grade on 
participants’ reported sexual intercourse frequency at the beginning of tenth grade ? 
 
b. Exploratory research questions  
 
Exploratory  research questions will investigate mediating factors, subgroup effects, longer term 
outcomes , and other  behavioral  outcomes.  
 
2) Description of the Intervention  and Counterfactual Condition  
 
The Freshman Focus Study  is a randomized controlled trial (RCT)  in which eligible, consenting 
participants are randomly assigned to a treatment or control group at study schools  located in two  
states – North Carolina and [LOCATION_001] . 
 
The study  is offered  to youth who are enrolled and entering ninth grade for the first time at one of the 
study schools , provide parental consent as well as personal assent to participate in the study , and are 
able to complete the  self-administered questionnaire in English or Spanish, unassisted, in a classroom 
setting in 60 minutes or less .  
 
Students assigned to t he treatment group receiv e Peer Group Connection (PGC ), a school -based, 
cross -age, group peer mentoring program for ninth grade students designed to facilitate the transition 
into high school and improve non- cognitive abilities ( e.g., grit, decision- making skills, goal -setting 
skills), student engagement, and educational outcomes.  Although PGC  is not explicitly a sexual 
health or teen pregnancy prevention program, the belief is that by [CONTACT_491731], building connectedness among peers, and building students’ decision- making and goal -setting 
skills, PGC  will encourage students to make healthier decisions, including reducing sexual risk- taking 
and increasing protective behaviors. As such, th e primary behavioral goals of this analysis are to 
delay sexual initiation, reduce frequency of sexual intercourse, and reduce sexual acti vity with 
multiple partners.   
 
Students assigned to t he control (count erfactual) group receive  class as usual; that is , the normally 
scheduled classes or activities into which co ntrol  participants are scheduled during the period when 
PGC  outreach sessions occur . Control group  participants will therefore receive more time in the 
regularly scheduled classes than treatment participants , but there will be no alternative program or 
additional activities offered to the c ontrol  participants.[ADDRESS_632451] 
confirmed that PGC  outreach sessions will occur in classes and on days only when no sexual or reproductive health components are 
taught. Therefore, exposure to sexual health content should be equal between treatment and comparison group participants.  
 4  a. Intervention condition: PGC  is a school -based , positive youth development program  for ninth  
grade students designed to improve  peer and  school attachment and social and emotional learning 
skills that support educational outcomes by [CONTACT_491732], supportive groups led by 
[CONTACT_491733]. PGC  was developed by [CONTACT_491734] (CSS). CSS staff 
train select school faculty to prepare high school juniors/seniors to mentor and educate freshmen 
during regular outreach sessions and create a positive school environment.  
 
i. Intended program components : PGC  includes regular , weekly , 45-minute  group 
outreach  sessions implemented either over the course of a semester or over the course of 
an entire school -year.  
 
ii. Intended program dosage: To implement  PGC  as intended, schools must hold at least 
[ADDRESS_632452] of 13 outreaches that are selected by [CONTACT_52721], along 
with three specific outreaches: Family Night; Activity Day; and at least one of the two 
possible Service Learning  projects , which may take  place over one to three separate 
outreach sessions.  
 
iii. Intended program content:  Peer leaders work in pairs to co -lead groups of [ADDRESS_632453], using a structured framework to support meaningful, youth- led 
community i nvolvement through a multi -layered action research model. PGC  also 
includes a parental involvement component. Peer leaders organize and facilitate Family 
Night events for freshmen and their parents/guardians that are focused on increasing 
parent -teen commu nication and showcasing community service projects.  
 
iv. Intended program delivery:  The intervention is delivered weekly by [CONTACT_491735]/or 
seniors who are selected by [CONTACT_491736]. Faculty 
advisors participate in an [ADDRESS_632454] ication materials, faculty recommendations, interviews, school 
performance, and criteria such as clear commitment to the role of being a peer mentor 
and self -confidence. C areful attention  is taken  to ensure that the peer leader group reflects 
the racial/ethnic composition, neighborhood affiliation, and socio- economic status of the 
school community, along with an equal number of girls and boys. Peer leaders receive 
training to conduct weekly outreach sessions as part of their regular school schedule in a 
daily 45 -minute leadership development class, typi[INVESTIGATOR_491720].   
 
b. Counterfactual condition:  Students in the control group receive “ class as usual”, meaning 
students continue to attend classes or activities that are normally offered to ninth  grade students 
when intervention students attend PGC  outreach sessions. The research team has worked with 
school schedulers to ensure that no student w as prevented from taking a class due to their study 
assignment and that intervention and comparison students had equal access to the same classes. In 
addition, the research team has worked with schools to confirm students would not miss regularly 
offered s exual or reproductive health lessons. Schools were encouraged to schedule study 
students into elective, PE, or advisory classes during PGC  periods, so that PGC  students would 
not miss core material when they were pulled for PGC . Study participants assigned to the control 
 5  condition remained in classes such as PE, Health, Art, Music, study hall, and club meetings, 
while students assigned to the intervention condition attended PGC  outreach sessions.  
i. Intended program components : The program components of the control condition will 
vary depending  on which course the comparison students are enrolled during the PGC  
outreach session period.  
 
ii. Intended program dosage : The control condition dosage of course content will be 
equivalent to the total amount of outreach s essions delivered to intervention group 
participants at a particular school. In other words, if thirteen 45- minute outreach sessions 
are delivered to intervention group participants at school A, control group students will 
receive 9.75 hours more content i n the course during which the PGC  outreach occurs at 
school A.  
 
iii. Intended program content : The control condition content will vary depending on which 
course  the co ntrol  students are enrolled during the PGC  outreach session period.  
 
iv. Intended program delivery : The control condition  is intended to be delivered in a 
classroom by a teacher at a study  school.  
3) Study Design  
 
a. Sample formation : Participants were enrolled during the 2016- 2017 (Cohort 1) and 2017- 2018 
(Cohort 2) school year. Cohort 1 participants were recruited from two high schools in North 
Carolina and four in [LOCATION_001]; Cohort 2 participants were recruited from nine high schools in 
North Carolina and six in [LOCATION_001]. Participants were recruited from three of the same New 
York schools during both the 2016- 2017 and 2017- 2018 school years; thus, a total of 18 schools 
are participating in the study (11 from North Carolina and 7 from N ew York).  
 
Potential study participants were identified through a consent /assent  and eligibility screening 
process. Parental consent and student assent forms asked students and parents to confirm whether 
the student was planning to attend ninth grade at a participating study school during the upcoming 
academic year and to review and sign the form, indicating whether they agreed for the student to 
participa te in the study. Consent/assent  procedures differ ed depending on whether the school was 
located in North Carolina or [LOCATION_001]. Within North Carolina, i n the spring prior to enrollment 
at a study school,  eighth grade students who attend ed feeder middle schools  received copi[INVESTIGATOR_491721] . For some schools , 
where randomization was scheduled to take place several weeks into students’ ninth grade year, 
additional forms were passed out to students in their freshman homeroom classes in the fall . 
Within [LOCATION_001], where a clear system of feeder middle schools does not exist, ninth grade 
students were not contact[CONTACT_491737] (began) high school . Parental consent and 
student assent materials were  distributed during the first two weeks  of the school year and 
students were asked to return the signed forms to school by a specific date.  In both locations, 
additional opportunities to recruit rising ninth grade students included high school orientation 
events held in the spring or summer bef ore students’ ninth grade year and via communication 
methods that were approved by [CONTACT_491738], such as postcards that shared instructions 
on how to consent using an online version of the consent form or mailing consent packets directly 
to studen ts and parents.  
 
Study schools shared their rosters of ninth grade students when they became available. This list of 
students was compi[INVESTIGATOR_491722]. The tool include d the students’ f irst and last names and had five columns 
that school staff were asked to complete with the following data for each student: 1) whether or 
 6  not the student was eligible for the study (based on the eligibility criteria defined below); 2) if not 
eligible, reas on why (selected from a drop- down menu); 3) whether or not the student also had a 
sibling in ninth grade; 4) person performing the screening; and 5) dat e eligibility determined.  
  
To enroll in the study , the individual  had to provide both parental  consent  and personal assent  to 
participate  and me et all of the remaining study eligibility criteria. The se students were  then 
randomized into the treatment or control condition and considered enrolled in the study . This set 
of participants , who were randomized into the study and offered the opportunity to receive PGC , 
constitutes the full in tent-to-treat (ITT) sample. The offer to receive the PGC  intervention i s the 
ITT treatment that we investigate in the primary and exploratory research questions.  
 
i. Eligibility criteria for target population: a number of  criteria were  established for 
participation in the study.  
 
To be eligible, participants must:  
1. Provide parental c onsent  and personal assent  to participate ; 
2. Be entering ninth grade for the first time at a participating study school;  
3. Be able to complete the questionnaire  in English or Spanish, unassisted, in a 
classroom setting, in [ADDRESS_632455] not:  
1. Be intending to enroll in a non- study school in ninth grade;  
2. Be repeating ninth grade;  
3. Be unable to complete the questionnaire without assistance.  
 
ii. Purposeful Sampling:  Any individual who provided both written parental consent and 
personal assent and met the remaining  eligibility criteria was  randomized into a condition and 
considered part of the ITT study sample.  
 
b. Random assignment process  
 
i. Unit of randomization: Random assignment occur red at the individual participant level.  
 
ii. Random assignment procedure:  Random assignment wa s conducted prior to the 
administration of the baseline Participant Q uestionnaire  at each school. A lead research 
analyst used an existing algorithm available in Stata (random allocation command, ralloc) 
to generate a list of random assignments based on the total number of students who met 
eligibility criteria and were  enrolled in the study. The list of eligible and enrolled students 
was alphabetized by [CONTACT_491739]. The alphabetized student list was then 
paired with the random assignment list. This is when random assignment occur red – 
when a  student  name  [CONTACT_491755] a treatment condition.  Random assignment 
blocks of varying sizes assign ed participants to the treatment or control condition at an 
equal (i.e., 1:1) assignment ratio within each participating school . The allocation lists  are 
password -protected and stored  on a secure PRG server  and were also shared w ith each 
individual school so that administrators could  ensure that students assigned to the 
treatment condition were  pulled out of class during each PGC  outreach session to receive 
the intervention.  
 
The research analyst for the study prepare d a Study Roster  for each school, which list ed 
the full name [CONTACT_491756], the condition to which the student wa s assigned, and 
associated a unique five -digit study ID with each student.  
 
 7  For both baseline and follow -up data collection, t he study team prep ares paper 
questionnaires  pre-printed with each unique study ID number and organize s them 
according to school. During questionnaire administration, the study team ensures that 
each individual student receives the instrument with his or her assigned unique ID 
number. T his number is associated with the participant’s questionnaire data.2  
 
iii. Blocking procedures: Blocking occurs  at the school  level. Participants are enrolled and 
randomized at the individual level within each participating study school . 
 
iv. Probability of assignment to treatment group : The probability of assignment to the 
treatment group is intended to be equal to the probability of assignment to the cont rol 
condition; that is , p (assignment to treatment ) =.5. 
 
v. Potential for crossover/contamination: To mitigate potential for both crossover  and 
contamination , the research team conducted several planning phone calls with each 
school involved in the study to ensure that the study procedures and expectations 
regarding randomization were clear before implementation. School leadership were asked 
to sign a Study Agreement , in which they committed to ensuring that students randomly 
assigned to participate in PGC  would participate in PGC  outreach sessions, and students 
randomly assigned to control would remain in class during the time that PGC  outreach 
sessions were h eld. However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_120502], there still remains the possibility that 
PGC  students may not receive some or all of the PGC  outreach sessions, and control 
students may receive PGC  if study procedures are not followed by [CONTACT_491740].  
 
c. Consent /assent  process: There was  no difference in the consent /assent  process for the treatment 
or control groups. E valuation parental consent  and student assent  was a condition of eligibility for 
the study, so no individual was randomized to a condition until after informed consent and assent 
were  obtained.  
 
During in- person student orientation s and beginning- of-school year events and via approved 
communication methods (e.g. online postcards and mailed consent form packets ), students and 
their parents who anticipate d or we re already enrolled at participating study schools received a 
detailed information sheet about the study, a Parental Informed Consent Form, and a Student 
Informed Assent Form . These materials provide d families with  information about the study, 
outline d why they were  being invited  to participate, and provide d conta ct information for study 
staff to address any questions. After reviewing the forms, they we re asked to indicate if they d id 
or did  not consent /assent  to participate in the study  and then return /submit the forms . Whe n 
applicable, forms were provided in Spanish and other languages spoken by [CONTACT_491741]. 
All individual students who returned forms were provided with small gift card incentives  ranging 
from $5 to $15 in value; in some  schools , homerooms with the highest form return rate s were 
provided with a pi[INVESTIGATOR_491723] . All incentives were 
provided based on form returns, regardless of if parents/ student s agreed  to participate in the 
study. In some Nort h Carolina study schools, teachers received small incentives to assist with the 
consent/assent form distribution and collection process. 
 
                                                 
[ADDRESS_632456] er. 
ID numbers and assignments from the Study Roster  dataset were  then matched to PRG’s randomization allocation dataset  so that 
we could monitor the integrity of the randomization process. This ensured , at a minimum, that the condition a particular partic ipant 
was assigned is the one that indicated in the assignment records. This is to say that the ITT “point of offer” treatment, at a minimum, 
formally retained  all the properties of random assignment even if a school  wrongly administer ed the incorrect condition . 
 8  d. Data collection : Data used for investigating  both  our primary and exploratory research questions 
are obtained  from the Participant  Questionnaire  administered at the beginning of ninth grade, 
beginning of tenth grade, and beginning of eleventh grade . The questionnaire is used to collect 
data on study participants’ self -reported sexual behavior and experiences ; intentions , thoughts, 
and feelings related to sexual behaviors ; peer influence on sexual decision  making; educational 
and career -related goals; intentions and feelings related to school; and social -emotional skills.  It is 
administered three  times at the following time points:  
a. Baseline – at the beginning of ninth grade  just prior to the participant receiving their 
assigned intervention  
b. 10th grade  – at the beginning of tenth grade3  
c. 11th grade  – at the beginning of eleventh grade   
 
While we collect data at three  time s over a period of two years, our analysis of primary research 
questions is  concerned only with data gathered at baseline and tenth grade .[ADDRESS_632457] hypothesis testing statistics (t -test). 
However, we propose to use regression- adjusted means as the primary estimate of PGC  program effects to improve the precision of 
our estimates. Refer to subsection 4f below  for a more detailed description of our proposed analytic approach.  
 [ADDRESS_632458] administration date at the student’s 
original school. Research staff attempt to have all questionnaires administered in person; 
however, if after  two weeks a participant is unwilling or unable to complete a follow -up 
questionnaire in person, the participant is given the option to complete it online on a personal 
device (computer or tablet) using a survey link provided via email. Two months after a follow -up 
window has opened, if the research team has not been successful in getting a participant to 
complete the questionnaire online , a paper questionnaire is mailed to the participant. Three 
months after a follow -up window has opened, if the te am has not been successful in getting a 
participant to complete the questionnaire online  or via mail , the final option offered is to complete 
a shorter version of the questionnaire over the phone, in an interview format, with the participant. 
We will run s ensitivity analyses that exclude participants who were surveyed by [CONTACT_491742].   
 
Research staff  make every attempt to collect outcome data as soon as possible after  each data 
collection window ( beginning of 10th grade and 11th grade ) opens; however, the data collection 
window remains  open for four months to allow sufficient time for participants to complete their 
questionnaires . Any questionnaires completed after a data collection window closes will not be 
included in the final analytic sample.   
 
e. Data  collection related to additional  analyses :  
 
Questionnaire Completion Database  
The Excel -based Questionnaire Completion Database  is completed by [CONTACT_491743] -up data collection points. One row is maintained for each enrolled 
participant. The spreadsheet  collect s administrative participant information, questionnaire 
completion data, incentive tracking data, and notes on issues/concerns with questionnaire 
administration session s. Data in the Questionnaire Completion Database  will be used to measure 
timing of follow -up data collection relative to baseline, overall attrition, and differential attr ition.  
 
Attendance Tracking Database  
School personnel at participating study schools tracked attendance at PGC outreach sessions by 
[CONTACT_491744] . The CSS evaluation 
team monitor ed attendance tracking monthly and provide d updates to schools. CSS staff  
follow ed-up with school personnel  regarding attendance submissions, as necessary. The CSS 
evaluation team sen t out monthly emails using MailChimp to remind school personnel  to submit 
attendance data . CSS staff then aggregate d attendance data into the Peer Group Connection 
Attendance Tracking Database  and submit ted it to PRG on a bi -annual basis. The attendance 
tracking database will be used to measure dosage of PGC  received and determine whether there 
has been any contamination where control students received PGC  outreach session content.  
 
4)  Analysis  
 
a. Outcome measures:  Our primary research questions ask to what extent the offer to participate in 
PGC  in ninth grade  relative to the offer to participate in class -as-usual in ninth grade  impacts 
participants’ reported: 1 ) sexual initiation; 2)  times having sex; and 3 ) number of sexual partners 
 10  at the beginning of tenth grade . We describe below the specific operationalization of these three  
outcome measures (see Table 1 in Appendix for additional detail) . 
 
Sexual initiation  
Sexual initiation is  constructed as a dichotomous  variable – participants are either coded 
as having ever had sex  or not  having ever had sex.  Data used to assess the impact of the treatment 
(PGC ) on sexual initiation  are obtained from the following  item on the Participant 
Questionnaire , which is administered to both treatment and control groups at baseline  and the 
beginning of tenth grade:   
  
• Have you ever had any type of sex (oral, vaginal, or anal)? 
  
Persons who select  Yes to the question are  coded as 1, indicating that they have had sex. Persons 
who select  No to the question are considered to not have ever had sex and are  coded as [ADDRESS_632459] on  sexual initiation  if, as compared to 
participants who are assigned to  the control group, a smaller  proportion of participants who are 
offered  PGC  report  sexual initiation  at the beginning of tenth grade and the difference between 
groups is statically significant.  
 
Times hav ing sex 
Times having sex is constructed as a continuous variable – the number of times in the past three 
months a participant engages in any type of sex (vaginal, oral, or anal) .[ADDRESS_632460] of the treatment ( PGC ) on frequency of sex are obtained from the following item on the 
Participant Questionnaire, which is administered to both the treatment and control groups at 
baseline and the beginning of tenth grade:   
 
• In the past three months, how many times have you had any type of  sex? 
 
Persons who indicate that  they have never had any  particular type of sex (vaginal, oral, or anal) or 
have not had any type of sex in the past three months are coded as having sex zero  times. [ADDRESS_632461] on times having sex if , at the beginning of the 
tenth grade,  participants assigned to PGC  report having sex fewer times than participants  
assigned to the control condition and the difference between groups is statically significant.  
 
Number of s exual p artners 
Number of sexual partners is constructed as a continuous  variable – the number of sexual partners 
the participant reports that they h ave had in the past three months.  Data used to assess the impact 
of the treatment ( PGC ) on number of sexual partners  are obtained from the following two items  
on the Participan t Questionnaire, which is administered to both the treatment and control groups 
at baseline  and the beginning of tenth grade:   
 
• The first question asks: During your life, with whom have you had sexual contact? 
                                                 
[ADDRESS_632462] (i.e., vaginal, anal, or oral), our meas ure of times having sex is not limited to sexual intercourse but includes all self -reported 
sexual activity.  
6 The Participant  Questionnaire contains sexual behavior questions that use a three- month recall period. As research has 
consistently found that me mory of behaviors/events decreases over time and accuracy of recall is negatively associated with length 
of recall period (Clarke et al. 2008; Schwarz and Oyserman 2001), we use items with three- month recall periods to construct our 
measures of sexual behaviors since these should elicit more accurate responses than a longer recall period (e.g., six -month).  
 
 11  • If respondents select Females, Males, or  Females and males to the first question, they 
are then asked this second quest ion: How many sexual partners have you had in the 
past 3 months?[ADDRESS_632463] three 
months if  participants assigned to PGC  report fewer sexual partners at the beginning of tenth 
grade than participants  assigned to the control condition and the dif ference between groups is 
statically significant.  
 
b. Analytic sample: In [LOCATION_001] and North Carolina , [ADDRESS_632464] supported the consent/assent, eligibility assessment, and enrollment processes for 
incoming ninth gr ade students (as described in section 3a above ). 
 
The analytic sample is defined as all participants who were randomized into either the treatment 
or control conditions (as described in section 3 b above) and who have reported sufficient outcome 
and covariate data.8 Missing data procedures are outlined  in subsection 4c v below .  
 
c. Data cleaning: P rior to analysis, PRG staff will systematically screen or review the analytic 
variables ( baseline  and outcome ) to identify errors, inconsistencies, missingness, and unreliable 
data.9 New variables are created in which data that are deemed unusable (i.e., invalid or 
unreliable) are coded as missing and flagged according to missing data type; all other data are 
retained, unchanged. 10 The steps taken in this data cleaning  process are outlined below. 
 
i. Identify and flag unreliable cases : The first step in the data screening process is to 
identify and flag  entire  cases (i.e., entire questionnaires) that are unreliable. By 
[CONTACT_78338], we mean that we have sufficient reason to believe that the respondent’s 
answers are not honest representations of their behaviors, knowledge, and beliefs. These 
cases are treated as m issing and excluded from our benchmark analyses.  
 
Cases are flagged as unreliable when responses follow a clear, deliberate pattern. This 
data cleaning procedure is informed by [CONTACT_491745] D rug Health (NSDUDH) and for the Youth Risk 
Behavior Survey (YRBS), which treat records that follow defined patterns of responses  
                                                 
[ADDRESS_632465] 3 months ? 
8 As outlined in subsection 4cv, our benchmark  approach is to impute baseline/covariate data. As such, suf ficient baseline/ covariate 
data means all cases where data are not unit missing.  We do not anticipate that we will have different analytic samples for our 
outcomes of interest; data are expected to be missing entirely for any given respondent at any observation point or not. If f or whatever 
reason analytic samples are different for di fferent outcomes, we will assess baseline equivalence separately for each analytic sample.  
[ADDRESS_632466] report. Along with our presentation of sensitivity analyses, we will present tables that present the prevalence of unit and 
item missing (which result from nonresponse) as well as inconsistent, unreliable, and invalid data for both treatment and control 
samples. Regarding incons istencies specifically, for each sexual behavior variable included in our model specifications (which could 
therefore influence the constitution of the analytic sample) we will include the following: sample size (the number of observ ations prior 
to recoding of inconsistencies) and the number of observations that are inconsistent over -time. If paper questionnaires lead to 
internally inconsistent data , we will also report on this . 
10 A note on missing values : Stata  provides a series of missing value codes that  allow us to “flag” missing data according to why 
they are missing. Data that are missing due to unit nonresponse (a questionnaire was not completed) are coded using the “syst em 
missing” value (“.”). All other types of missing data are coded using “extended missing” values (e.g.,“.a”, “.b”).  
 
 12  as missing .11 PRG flags the following cases as unreliable: a) the same response option is 
chosen for all multiple choice questio ns; b) responses alternate between only two 
response options; or c) responses alternate systematically, starting with one response 
option, alternating through all options in order until exhausted then beginning again (in 
the same or in reverse order). If o ther response patterns are observed over the course of 
the evaluation, they will be added to PRG’s list of unreliable response patterns.  
 
Data for cases that are deemed unreliable are treated as unit missing  and excluded from 
benchmark analyses. However, sensitivity analyses that include the unreliable data will 
be conducted and results will be reported in an appendix of the report.  
 
ii. Identify and flag invalid responses : The second step in the data screening process is to 
inspect the data for instances in wh ich responses are invalid because they are outside of a 
pre-determined range of plausible or acceptable values. Each questionnaire type (e.g., 
baseline, post -program ) has a codebook, which is prepared by a PRG staff, that contains 
variable names, valid var iable values or ranges of values, and when applicable value 
labels.[ADDRESS_632467] performs diagnostics 
in Stata  to ensure that responses to all analytic measures are valid (i.e., data are within 
ranges specified in the codebook). A data analyst inspects the data using two commands 
in Stata . First the analyst uses the command sum variable_name, which provides 
summary statistics (mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation) for all numeric 
variables. The an alyst checks that the minimum and maximum values are valid. If this 
command reveals there are values out of range, the analyst then inspects the data using 
the command, tab variable_name, missing, which provides a frequency table of all values 
(including m issing values) so the analyst can identify and flag all values that are out of 
range as invalid and recode these values to missing (code as “.i”).  
 
Data that are recoded to missing are treated according to our missing data approach. 
Briefly, our benchmark  approach is to adjust missing baseline data and include in 
analysis; we exclude observations with missing outcome data from analysis.  
 
iii. Identify and flag outliers : The third step is to identify and flag severe outliers. Outliers  
(operationally defined below)  are values that are extreme compared to other observations 
but are not  plainly invalid. In the data cleaning process,  we inspect outliers so that we can 
try to ascertain whether they are in fact true (or plausible) values or potentially a result of 
measurement error. The only variables for which we inspect outliers are those used in the 
construction of our outcome variab les (times having vaginal sex, times having oral sex, 
times having anal sex, and number of sexual partners ) because they have no upper limit 
(all other variable s used in analysis are either categorical or have predicated upper and 
lower bounds). Our approa ch to identifying and flagging outliers  is as follows.13 
 
• First, in Stata  we use the lv (letter -value display) command to identify severe 
outliers. We define values as severe outliers according their relation to the 
interquartile range (IQR). Severe outlier s are defined as values outside of the outer 
fences of the population distribution.  
o IQR= Q3(3rd quartile or 75th percentile) – Q 1(1st quartile or 25th percentile)

2018 from https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/NSDUH -M9-Youth- 2012/NSDUH -M9-Youth- 2012.pdf.  
12Regardless as to whether data are nominal, ordinal, or continuous, all response options are coded in Stata  as numeric values; 
values are labeled according to corresponding category names when data are nominal or ordinal. As an example, the variable 
gender is a nominal variable;  however , it is treated as a dummy variable where females are coded as “1” and males are coded as 
“0”. The only acceptable values for this variable then are 0 and 1;  any other values are out of range.  
13 Rules for identifying outliers are informed by [CONTACT_716]:  Hamilton, Lawrence C. 2006. Statistics with Stata : Updated for Version 
[ADDRESS_632468]/SEMATECH e -Handbook of Statistical Methods , http://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/.  
 13  o Upper outer fence: Q3 + 3*IQ  
o Lower outer fence: Q1 -  3*IQ  
• Second, we create an outlier indicator variable, where observations deemed severe 
outliers are coded as 1, all others are coded as 0.  
 
Our benchmark analytic approach is to include data flagged as outliers  in analysis, 
because we do not know for certain w hether the values are true or invalid. However, we 
also run sensitivity analyses that exclude these data and report substantive differences in 
the results section of the report.  
 
iv. Identify and flag inconsistencies in reporting of sexual behaviors : The fourth  step in 
the data review process is to inspect the data and identify inconsistencies in sexual 
behavior outcome data. With repeated measures of sexual behaviors, two primary types 
of inconsistencies may occur – internal inconsistences and over-time inconsistencies.14 
Internal inconsistencies refer to discrepancies in responses (to related questions) in the 
same survey administration. For instance, a respondent might say that they have  not had 
sex in the past three months, but then indicate s that they used condoms three of the times 
they had sex in the past three months. Over -time inconsistencies refer to instances in 
which lifetime reported behaviors decline or are completely recanted over time. For 
example, at baseline a respondent might say  that they have  had vaginal sex in their  life, 
but on a subsequent administration of the survey say that they have  never had vaginal 
sex.  
 
In order to minimize internal inconsistencies in our primary outcomes, we have  skip 
patterns in  the paper questionna ire – if participants indicate they have not had a particular 
type of sex they are  instructed to skip out of more specific questions related to that type 
of sex ; and if they state they have never had sexual contact, they are instructed to skip  out 
of questions asking about how many sexual partners they have had over certain periods of 
time. However, it is possible for participants to provide responses to questions that they 
should not have answered or that do not make sense given their responses to previous 
questions. If and when such inconsistencies are observed, the participant’s responses to 
the two or more items where inconsistencies are noted are recoded to system missing and 
will not be used in our primary outcome analysis .[ADDRESS_632469] primary outcome measures, as well as any variables that may be used to 
logically impute values for primary outcome measures. If over -time inconsistencies are 
ident ified, both the baseline and follow -up values are flagged as inconsistent over time 
and recoded to missing (coded as “.k.”). Data that are recoded to missing are treated 
according to our missing data approach. Briefly, our benchmark approach is to adjust 
missing baseline data and include in analysis; we exclude observations with missing 
outcome data from analysis.  
 
                                                 
14 Inconsistencies can occur for a number of reasons including social desirability bias and memory or recall issues on the part of the 
respondent and misunderstanding on the part of either the respondent or interviewer (Alexander et al 1993; Clarke, Fiebig, and 
Gerdtham 2008; Del Boca and Noll 2000; Harris et al 2008; Schroeder et al 2003; Schwarz and Oyserman 2001). These issues are 
especially common in self -reports of sexual behaviors where questions are of a sensitive nature and often respondents are asked  to 
indicate the frequency and/or recency of behaviors over differing lengths of time (e.g., 30 days, 3 months, 6 months).   
[ADDRESS_632470] in data collected through the online instrument.  
 
 14  v. Missing data approach:  Assuming that our study design and procedures are sound, 
missing data pose perhaps the greatest threat to the internal validity of our RCT study and 
the ITT framework ( Puma et al. 2009; Moher et al., 2010).[ADDRESS_632471] remain 
equal in expectation at the point of analysis . When the  analytic sample is diminished by 
[CONTACT_78341]- response, non- random differences (i.e., self -selecting) between the 
treatment and comparison groups may be introduced into the  sample and estimates of 
program impacts may become biased. Although there is no consensus on how to resolve 
this, practical guidance on how to address and mitigate the problems associated with 
missing data have been published in education ( Puma et al., 2009 ). 
 
Our six -step decision process for addressing this problem, as detailed below, is  informed 
by [CONTACT_78342]. These steps articulate how we will deal with missing outcome or 
baseline/ covariate data (that is variables outlined in the M odel specification and 
covariates section  and are necessary for the estimation of impacts). The benchmark 
approach that we have selected aims to mitigate the introduction of bias into our impact 
and maximize the use of available data by [CONTACT_491746]/covariate data. To 
test the robustness of this approach, and to verify these findings, we will rep ort 
comparative findings using sensitivity analyses that also employ an alternative method 
which includes no adjustment  (as outlined in step 6).  
 
1. Using data cleaning procedures outlined in the Data cleaning section, identify  
inconsistent , outlying,  unreliable , and invalid data in any analytic (i.e. , outcome, 
baseline, or covariate) variables, recode inconsistent and invalid data as missing , 
and flag unreliable and outl ier data for analysis.17  
 
2. Report prevalence of unit and item missing ness (which result from nonresponse) 
as well as inconsistent, unreliable , and invalid data for both treatment and control 
samples .[ADDRESS_632472] missing values (due to nonresponse) and logically impute where this is the 
case. We will not logically impute where the missing values are previously 
inconsistent , unreliable, or invalid.  
 
4. Determine if any individuals who are in the randomiz ed sample (for each 
outcome) do not have outcome data  at the 10th grade  follow -up time point . If this 
is the case, our proposed benchmark approach is to use case deletion, as we feel it 
is the most straightforward and prudent approach for missing follow -up data 
recommended in Puma et al. (2009) . These cases will be deleted from the analytic 
sample and attrition statistics will be reported.

17 We will code missing responses with a unique missing code that identifies or flags these missing values according to the reason 
they are missing (i.e., nonresponse, invalid, inconsistent). Unreliable data are not recoded to missing, rather cases deemed 
unreliable are coded as 1 in an indicator variable, treated as unit missing, and excluded from analysis. See the Data cleaning 
section or Table 3 in the Appendix for details on how missing data are coded.  
18 For item missing values, we will only report prevalence of missing and inconsistent data for variables that are included in our 
model specifications and could therefore influence the constitution of the analytic sample.  
 15  5. Determine if any individuals who are in the randomized sample (for each 
outcome) are missing baseline covaria tes or the baseline measure of the outcome 
variable. If this is the case, our proposed benchmark approach is to use dummy 
variable adjustment procedures, as we feel it is the most straightforward and 
prudent approach for missing baseline /covariate data recommended in Puma et al. 
(2009) . 
 
6. Conduct sensitivity analys es by [CONTACT_491747] w ith missing baseline data 
excluded from the analysis (i.e., use case- wise deletion for all cases with missing 
baseline and outcome data). In an appendix, we will report our benchmark results 
next to the sensitivity analysis results to verify findings.  
 
d. Assessment of baseline equivalence: Baseline equivalence will be reported for all baseline 
measures of each outcome variable as well as relevant  demographic  and sexual behavioral  
measures. We first list and describe the measures we will  use to examine the equivalence of our 
treatment and control group at baseline. After we identify the measures, we provide details on the 
diagnostic methods that we will use to  assess any baseline difference that may exist between the 
treatment and control groups in the measures outlined below.  
 
Demographic  and Sexual Behavior Measures  
Baseline equivalence will be assessed for four demographic  variables ( identified below ). Age, 
race, ethnicity  and education  are constructed  using participant  self-responses to questions in the  
baseline Participant Questionnaire . For the race variables, categorical responses to a single 
question are used to create multiple dichotomous variables. We provide details on variable coding 
below; details on variable construction can be found in Table 2 in the Appendix.  
 
Demographic:  
• Age (continuous)19 
• Gender20  
• Race21 
• Hispanic/Latino  
 
Baseline Outcome Measures 
In addition to the demographic measures, we will assess baseline equivalency of the  outcome 
measures. We provide details on variable coding below; details on variable construction can be 
found in Table 2 in the Appendix.  
  
• Sexual initiation  at baseline (dichotomous; where 0=has never had sex and 1=has had sex)  
                                                 
19 Age is calculated using the baseline questionnaire completion date minus the participant ’s reported date of birth.  
20 At baseline, participants are asked “Which of the following best describes you?” and provided with a list of the following response 
options: Female, Male, Transgender, Unknown, Other ( please specify ). Responses are recoded into the following categories: Female , 
Male, Other  (which includes individuals who report Transgender , Unknown , or Other ). For analysis, dummy variables are created for 
each category in the recoded variable.  
21 At baseline, participants are asked “What is your race?” and are provided with a list of the following response options: White ; Black 
or African American ; Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin;  American Indian or Alaskan Native;  Asian ; Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific 
Islander ; Unknown ; or Some other race/ethnicity . Participants  can select more than one category  and they can also specify some 
other race/ethnicity. This item is used to create two separate categorical variables. Hispanic/Latino is a dummy variable that indicates 
whether someone identifies as Hispanic, Latino, or of Spanish origin or not. Race is a categorical variable that indicates a person’s 
self-identified race; responses are recoded into the following mutually exclusive categories: White only, Black only, Other race only  
(which includes American Indian/Alaskan Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander , Other ), Race not selected (individ uals 
who selected no racial category), and Multiracial  (which includes individuals who selected more than one racial category). For analysis, 
dummy variables are created for each category in the recoded variable.  
 
 16  • Times having sex in the past 3 months at baseline (continuous; values range 0 to k , where 0= 
has had sex [ADDRESS_632473] 3 months and k = number of times having sex in past 3 months ) 
• Number of sexual partners in the past 3 months at baseline (continuous; values range 0 to k , 
where 0= has [ADDRESS_632474] 3 months and k = number of sexual partners in past 3 
months ) 
 
Balance Assessment Methods  
We propose to assess baseline equivalence of the treatment and control groups according to a 
multi- step procedure. Baseline equivalence statistics will be produced for each analytic sample.22 
Only participants who provide baseline data to an outcome measure will be included in the 
analytic sample for that same outcome measure; thus the analytic sample used for each research 
question may vary slightly because of the exclusion of non -responders. As required by [CONTACT_941]  
“Identifying Programs that Impact Teen Pregnancy, Sexually T ransmitted Infections, and 
Associated Sexual Risk Behaviors”  review protocol , we will r eport the adjusted means and p-
values of the differences in the baseline variable of interest for the treatment and control groups.[ADDRESS_632475], we generate a model -based estimate of the difference between treatment 
and comparison groups on the pre -intervention measures identified above . Separate 
models will be run for each of the variables. The empi[INVESTIGATOR_193952] (using Stata). If the measure is dichotomous, we propose to use a linear probability  
model to estimate the predicted probability of group membership. The model is a 
reduced- form variation of the model that we use to estimate program impact (as detailed  
in the Model specification and covariates  section, below ).26 
 
𝑌𝑌𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏 = 𝛽𝛽0 + 𝛽𝛽1𝑇𝑇 +�(𝛽𝛽𝑃𝑃𝑋𝑋𝑃𝑃)+𝜀𝜀 
where:  
𝑌𝑌𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏  – is the baseline measure of the variable that we use to establish baseline 
equivalency (identified in the Appendix – Table 2  above ). This variable is included as a 
covariate in the analytic model (see Table 2 in the Appendix for details on variable 
coding). Separate models will be estimated for each baseline equivalency measure  
specified above.  
𝑇𝑇 – A dummy treatment indicator variable whose value equals [ADDRESS_632476] there may be slight differences in analytic samples for each research question.  
23 Goesling, B., & Trenholm, C. (2016). Identifying Programs that Impact Teen Pregnancy, Sexually Transmitted Infections, and 
Associated Sexual Risk Behaviors. Mathematica P olicy Research.  
24 The literature on balance statistics argues that significance testing is inappropriate for this diagnostic task (Austin, 2007; Imai et al., 
2008; Austin, 2009; Stuart, 2010). Hypothesis tests can be misleading diagnostic measures of basel ine equivalence because they 
conflate balance with statistical power . 
[ADDRESS_632477] same samples of observations that we will use 
in our primary analysis. In other words, we will apply  the missing data approach outlined in section 4 cv prior to  producing estimates 
of baseline equivalency on the pre -intervention measures.  
26 It is a reduced-  form because individual -level, demographic covariates are omitted. It is a variation because the dependent 
variable is the baseline equivalence variable, not the outcome measure.  
 17  𝑋𝑋 – School  (blocking variable) – An n -1 vector of school  indicator dummy variables that 
are coded  one if the intervention was delivered at school  n and coded zero otherwise.  
𝛽𝛽0 – The intercept term, which represents the adjusted mean value of the baseline 
equivalency measure for participants in the control sample, with all other variables in 
the model held constant at zero. 
𝛽𝛽1 – This represents the adjusted (but not standardized) mean difference in the baseline 
equivalency variable between treatment and control participants.  
𝜀𝜀− The residual or random variation that remains for each observation after the 
structural components of the model are estimated. It is the difference between the 
observed and the predicted values at the individual level.  
 
step 2. Report  the adjusted means and p -values of the differences in the baseline variable 
of interest for the treatment and control groups . 
 
step 3. If the pre-intervention measures  is continuous, we propose to use the following 
formula  to calculate the pooled within -group standard deviation of the outcome 
measure:  
𝑆𝑆𝑝𝑝=�(𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡−1)𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑡2+(𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐−1)𝑆𝑆𝑐𝑐2
(𝑛𝑛𝑡𝑡+ 𝑛𝑛𝑐𝑐−2) 
 
where: n t and n c are the sample sizes, and S t and S c are the participant -level standard 
deviations for the pre -intervention measures for the analytic treatment and comparison 
groups, respectively. We will produce separate calculations of the pooled standardized 
deviation for each variable used to establish baseline equivalence (as noted above).  
 
step 4 . Produce the standardized difference of means. If the pre -intervention measure  is 
continuous, we will use Hedges’ g as the formula to compute the standardized difference 
of means for the treatment and comparison groups : 
 
𝑔𝑔= 𝛽𝛽1
𝑆𝑆𝑝𝑝 
 
Where:  𝛽𝛽1 is the adjusted mean difference in the variable selected to establish baseline 
equivalence for the treatment and comparison groups (calculated in Step 1) , and S p is the 
pooled standard deviation (produced in Step 2) . 
 
For dichotomous baseline variables we will use the Cox index, which yields effect size 
values similar to the values of Hedges’ g that one would obtain if group means, standard 
deviations, and sample sizes were available, assuming the dichotomous outcome 
measure is based on any underlying normal distribution.” Following this guidance, we 
propose to use the Cox index to estimate baseline equivalence for dichotomous baseline 
covariates. The formula is as follows:  
 
𝑑𝑑𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶= �𝑙𝑙𝑛𝑛�𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡
1−𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡�−𝑙𝑙𝑛𝑛�𝑝𝑝𝑐𝑐
1−𝑝𝑝𝑐𝑐��
1.65� 
 
Where: 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝  and 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 represent the probability of occurrence of the event (or characteristic) 
within the treatment and comparison groups, respectively.  
 
e. Condition crossover and contamination : Crossover will be defined as study participants 
assigned to the treatment condition who remained in class- as-usual and did not participate in any 
 18  PGC  outreach sessions during the course of the program implementation period.27 This will be 
determined from at tendance records within the Attendance Tracking  Database . We will calculate 
crossover using the following formula:  
 
        𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑝𝑝𝑠𝑠𝑑𝑑𝐶𝐶𝑛𝑛𝑝𝑝  𝑇𝑇=�𝑁𝑁𝐶𝐶𝑝𝑝  𝑅𝑅𝐶𝐶𝑝𝑝𝐶𝐶𝑅𝑅𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑑𝑑𝐶𝐶𝑝𝑝𝑠𝑠𝑑𝑑𝐶𝐶𝑛𝑛𝑝𝑝𝑇𝑇

Contamination will be defined as study participants assigned to the control condition who 
received any amount of PGC  programming during the course of the program implementation 
period.28 This will be determined from attendance records within the Attendance Tracking 
Database . We will calculate contamination using the following formula:  
 
        𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑛𝑛𝑝𝑝𝐵𝐵𝐶𝐶𝑅𝑅𝑛𝑛𝐵𝐵𝑝𝑝𝑅𝑅𝐶𝐶𝑛𝑛𝐶𝐶𝑝𝑝𝑠𝑠𝑑𝑑𝐶𝐶𝑛𝑛𝑝𝑝  𝐶𝐶=�𝑅𝑅𝐶𝐶𝑝𝑝𝐶𝐶𝑅𝑅𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑑𝑑𝐶𝐶𝑝𝑝𝑠𝑠𝑑𝑑𝐶𝐶𝑛𝑛𝑝𝑝𝐶𝐶

Levels of crossover and contamination will be reported in the findings section of our final impact 
report.  
 
f. Analytic approach for primary research questions:  As detailed in our primary research 
question s, this study  investigates whether offering PGC  to participants impacts their reported 
sexual initiation, number of times having sex , and number of sexual partners . We do this within 
the intent to treat (ITT) framework, which does not measure the effect of the particip ant’s 
exposure to the treatment itself but rather the effect of the offer of the treatment relative to the 
offer of receiving the control condition. This framework maintains the integrity of the 
experimental structure by [CONTACT_491748] (except those who 
attrite) in the analytic  sample, thereby [CONTACT_491749]. Bias can be insinuated, however, through self -selection if any participant 
who is randomized fails to prov ide outcome  data .  
                                                 
[ADDRESS_632478] Analysis Plan guidance for Cohort 2 Tier 2B grantees, crossover is described as occurring “ when individuals 
randomly assigned to the intervention or counterfactual conditions are later found to be receiving the services intended to be offered 
to the other condition.” Given this, we calculate crossover in our sample as participants assigned to the treatment condition who only 
received class-as-usual and did not receive any PGC outreach sessions, as this is the intended counterfactual condition.  
[ADDRESS_632479] Analysis Plan guidance for Cohort 2 Tier 2B grantees, contamination is described as occurring “ when individuals 
assigned to the counterfactual condition end up receiving all or portions of the conditions intended only as part of the intervention.” 
Given this, we calculate contamination in our sample as participants assigned to the control condition who received any amount of 
PGC programming , as this is the intended treatment condition.  
 
 19   
i. Model specification  and covariates : The primary research questions under investigation in 
this study are  whether offering PGC  to participants impacts their : (1) reported sexual 
initiation; ( 2) reported  times having sex ; and (3) reported number of sexual partners  (see 
Table 1 in Appendix for variable constructions) . We propose to estimate these impacts 
using a regression that will model intervention effects as a function of assignment to PGC  
(i.e., Treatment), relevant baseline covariates, a baseline measure of the outcome variable, 
and school -level (blocking) indicat ors (see Table 2 in Appendix for variable 
constructions) .[ADDRESS_632480] of the treatment, we propose a model -based approach because it will 
increase the precision of those estimates. The empi[INVESTIGATOR_491724] (using Stata).30 We present the empi[INVESTIGATOR_78294]:

Where:  
YPost – The outcome variable  of interest , either: 1) sexual initiation; 2) times 
having sex in the past 3 months (continuous; values range 0 to k , where 0= has 
had no sex in past 3 months , and k = number of times having sex in past 3 
months) ; or 3) number of sexual partners in the past 3 months (continuous; 
values range 0 to k, where 0= has [ADDRESS_632481] 3 months , and k = 
number of sexual partners  in past 3 months)  reported by [CONTACT_3445] i at the 10th 
grade  follow -up. (see Table 1  for full details on the variable construction).  
 
YPre – The baseline measure of the outcome variable of interest repor ted by 
[CONTACT_3445] i at baseline (see Table 2  for full details on the variable 
construction) ; variable will be re- centered at  the grand mean for analysis.  
 
T –A dummy treatment indicator variable whose value equals 1 if the 
participant is randomized into the treatment group and zero otherwise.  
 
X – A p vector of baseline (i.e. , measured prior to receiving intervention or 
exogenous to treatment) participant -level covariates as well as blocking 
variables to account for the variation in outcomes associated with these groups. 
These covariates, listed in detail in Table 2 in the appe ndix, will include:  
a) Age – age (based on date of birth) reported by [CONTACT_491750]  
(continuous); variable will be re -centered at the grand mean for 
analysis.  
                                                 
[ADDRESS_632482] hypothesis testing statistics (t -test). With that said, we propose a 
regression- based model that includes covariates, because randomization should ensure covariates are uncorrelated with the 
treatment variable (i.e., they should not affect the estimate of the treatment effect) , and in the instance they are significant predictors 
of the outcome, their inclusion in a regression model will decrease the standard error of the estimates, making them more precise.

the count variables (times having sex and number of partners) we will test the robustness of OLS results against a statistical count 
model that fits the distribution characteristics well (Poisson, negative binomial family). If OLS and the count models offer substantively 
different es timates we will report results for the appropriate model with the best fit statistics (based on log- likelihood statistics).

be coded as a set of 3 -1 = 2 dummy variables (each coded as 1 if they 
are of the specified gender and coded as 0 otherwise) ; variable will be 
re-centered at the grand mean for analysis.  
c) Race – race of participant as self -reported at baseline . Race will be 
coded as a set  of 4- 1 = 3 dummy variables (each coded as 1 if they are 
of the specified race and coded as 0 otherwise); each of the variables 
will be re -centered at the grand mean for analysis.  
d) Hispanic/Latino  – self -report ed as Hispanic , Latino, or of Spanish 
origin at baseline  (0=do not identify as Hispanic/Latino /Spanish origin ; 
1=identify as Hispanic, Latin o, of Spanish origin) ; variable will be re-
centered at the grand mean for analysis.  
e) School  – An n- 1 vector of school  indicator dum my variables that are 
coded one if the intervention was delivered at school  n and coded zero 
otherwise. School  1 is the reference category and is excluded from 
analysis. The dummy variables will be mean -centered for analysis to 
facilitate interpretation.  
 
𝛽𝛽0 – The intercept term, which represents , depending on the outcome measure 
of interest in the analysis , the outcome for the average control participant  with 
all other variables in the model held constant at their mean . 
𝛽𝛽1 – This is the parameter estimate of substantive interest. 𝛽𝛽 [ADDRESS_632484] in the analysis, either: 1) the 
adjusted mean difference in treatment and control participants’ self -reported 
sexual initiation at the 10th follow -up; 2) the adjusted mean difference in 
treatment and contro l participants’ self -reported times having sex in the past 
three months at the 10th grade  follow -up; or 3 ) the adjusted  mean difference in 
treatment and control participants’ self -reported number of sexual partners in 
the past three months at the 10th follow -up. 
𝜀𝜀− The error term or unexplained individual -level variance  that remains for 
each observation after the structural components of the model are estimated. It 
is the difference between the observed and the predicted values at the 
individual level.  
 
We will report model -estimated effects and the results of significance tests in 
the findings section of the final impact report. Statistical significance will be 
based on test statistics produced by [CONTACT_78358] 𝛽𝛽1 using a two-
tailed test, with p < .05.

Overall and differential attrition will be reported in the findings section of our final 
impact report.  
 
iii. Adjustments for multiple comparisons: Following guidance provided under the grant for 
our impact analysis plan31, we will adjust for multiple comparisons in all of our primary 
outcome s analyses, regardless of outcome domains. We propose to use the Benjamini -
Hochberg method.32 This method controls for the false discovery rate (FDR), which is the 
expected value of the number of false positive tests divided by [CONTACT_491751] a family of tests. The following procedures will be used to implement this 
adjustment:  
                                                 
[ADDRESS_632485] estimates of primary outcome measures.  
32 This method has been selected because it helps to control the Type 1 error rate without also increasing the Type 2 error rate, which 
in our view is a serious consideration in preliminary efforts to identify evidence of effectiveness of new approaches. Benjamini, Y., & 
Hochberg, Y. (1995). Controlling the false discovery rate: a practical and powerful approach to multiple testing. Journal of the royal 
statistical soci ety. Series B (Methodological), 289- 300. 
 [ADDRESS_632486], indexed by i (where i 
= [ADDRESS_632487] p -value and i  = k for the largest p -value).  
2. Beginning with the largest p -value ( pk1), we will assess if pk1 < ((i/m)a*), where m  = the 
total number of tests conducted, and a* = the initial significance value at which we would 
reject the null hypothesis and the level of false discovery we are willing to accept (in this 
case, 0.05). The null hypothesis will be rejected and the test will be consider ed 
statistically significant if p k1 < ((i/m)a*). If p k1 < ((i/m)a*), all smaller p -values in the list 
will also be considered statistically significant and the null hypothesis will be rejected for 
each test. If pk1 ≥ ((i/m)a*), the null hypothesis will hold, the test will not be considered 
statistically significant, and the next largest p -value in the ranked list will be assessed.   
3. If the 1st p-value is not statistically significant, the 2nd largest p -value in the list ( pk2) will 
be compared against ( i/m)a*. The null hypothesis will be rejected and the test will be 
considered statistically significant if p k2 < ((i/m)a*). If p k2 < ((i/m)a*), all smaller p -values 
in the list will also be considered statistically significant and the null hypothesis will be 
rejected for each test. If pk2 ≥ ((i/m)a*), the null hypothesis will h old, the test will not be 
considered statistically significant, and the next largest p -value in the ranked list will be 
assessed.  
4. If the 2nd p-value is not statistically significant, the 3rd largest p -value in the list ( pk3) will 
be compared against ( i/m)a*. The null hypothesis will be rejected and the test will be 
considered statistically significant if p k3 < ((i/m)a*), If p k3 ≥ ((i/m)a*), the null hypothesis 
will hold and the test will not be considered statistically significant.  
  
iv. Sensitivity analyses:  We will conduct sensitivity analyses to test the robustness and 
validity of our benchmark approaches outlined above. These include: (1) excluding 
covariates ; (2) not adjusting for missing  baseline  data; (3) excluding unreliable data;  (4) 
excluding  outliers ; (5) condensing data collection windows to exclude late responders ; and 
(6) using an alternative model specification  to estimate program effects.  
 
1. Without baseline covariates.  Our benchmark approach is to include baseline 
covariates in our model to improve the precision of our estimates. To test this, we will 
conduct  sensitivity analys es that involve running identical empi[INVESTIGATOR_491725]. Analytic findings for both approaches will be presented alongside 
each other in an appendix of the impact report.  
 
2. Without adjusted baseline  data. As outlined in the Missing data approach section , 
our benchmark approach is to adjust  baseline  data as  published guidance suggests that 
this may produce unbiased impact estimates  and maximize the use of available data. We 
will test this by [CONTACT_193985][INVESTIGATOR_491726]. Analytic findings for both approaches will be 
presented alongside each other in an appendi x of the impact report.  
 
As outlined in the B aseline equivalency  section, we will also produce diagnostic 
estimates of baseline equivalency on the pre- intervention outcome variables according 
to our benchmark approach and the sensitivity study alongside each other in an 
appendix of the report.  
 
3. With unreliable data. As  discussed in the Data cleaning section, data for cases that are 
deemed unreliable are treated as unit missing  and excluded from benchmark analyses. 
To test this, we will conduct  sensitivity analyses that involve running identical 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_491727]. Analytic findings for both 
approaches will be presented alongside each other in an appendix of the impact report.  
 23   
4. With out outliers . As discussed in the Data cleaning section, extreme data values are 
investigated and flagged as outliers. Our benchmark analytic approach is to include data 
flagged as outliers (i.e., extreme values that are not considered invalid) in analysis. We 
will also conduct sensitivity analyses that  exclude these data and report substantive 
differences in the results section of the report.  
 
5. Condensed d ata collection w indows . Our benchmark approach is to include follow -up 
data from all participants who completed a questionnaire during their open data  
collection window, regardless of the time point in that window when it was completed. 
Data collection windows are broad to minimize attrition from the analytic sample. To 
examine whether or not this influences our results – and, in particular , whether or not 
study participants who respond later report different outcomes from those who respond 
earlier – we will conduct an analysis that  examines the difference , if any, in response 
time between treatment and control participants and  compares impact estimates for 
analytic samples without late responders. Late responders will be defined as those 
participants who complete their 10th grade  questionnaire more than one month after the 
initiation of the 10th grade  data collection window.  
 
6. Statistical Modeling.  We have proposed using OLS regression as the benchmark 
statistical model we intend to use to estimate the program’s effect on the primary 
outcomes. OLS is robust in large samples to misspecification. OLS is also a 
conventional approach to modeling dichotomous and count outcomes in evaluation 
because it produces estimates that are more immediately and readily interpretable, and 
because it tends to produce results that are substantively identical to the models that 
technically fit the data better. We will conduct tests that test the validity of this 
assumption and if there is a substantive difference in point estimates of interest 
produced by [CONTACT_193986] (or variant of – e.g. Firth logit) or statistical count models 
(e.g. Poisson and neg ative binomial families), we will report results of the models that 
fit the distributional characteristics of the data better (based on diagnostics and log -
likelihood statistics).

Table 1. Behavioral outcomes used for primary impact analyses research questions  
Outcome name  [CONTACT_193992], including how it is operationalized  Source of the measure  Timing of measure  
Sexual initiation The risk outcome is operationalized as a dichotomous variable indicating 
whether a person reports having ever had sex or not having ever had sex.   
  
The measure is calculated from the following item:   
• Have you ever had any type of sex (oral, vaginal, or anal)? 
  
A person who selects either  Yes is given a value of 1 for the measure. A 
person who selects  No is given a value of 0 for the measure.   
  
The resulting variable is dichotomous with values 0 or 1, where 0 indicates a 
person who has never had any type of sex  and 1 indicates a person who has 
had sex .  
  
Note: The analytic sample will include all respondents who have tenth 
grade follow -up data.  Participant 
Questionnaire Beginning of tenth

Times having sex  
 
 The risk outcome is operationalized as the number of times in the past three 
months a person reports having any type of sex.  
 
The measure is calculated from the following items:  
• In the past [ADDRESS_632488] you had vaginal sex?  
• In the past [ADDRESS_632489] you had oral sex?  
• In the past [ADDRESS_632490] you had anal sex?

Sexual 
initiation  The risk outcome is operationalized as a dichotomous variable indicating 
whether a person reports having ever had sex or not having ever had sex.   
  
The measure is calculated from the following item:   
• Have you ever had any type of sex (oral, vaginal, or anal)? 
  
A person who selects either  Yes is given a value of [ADDRESS_632495] 
analysis as the pre- intervention or baseline 
measure of the behavioral outcome; it is included 
in the models so that individual -level change or 
difference can be assessed at the 10th grade 
follow -up. 
Times having 
sex  The risk outcome is operationalized as the number of times in the past three 
months a person reports having any type of sex.  
 
The measure is calculated from the following items:  
• In the past [ADDRESS_632496] you had vaginal s ex? 
• In the past [ADDRESS_632497] you had oral sex?  
• In the past [ADDRESS_632498] you had anal sex?  
 
The measure is calculated by [CONTACT_193987] a person

The measure is calculated from the following item:  
• How many sexual partners have you had in the past 3 months? 
 Number of sexual partners  is included in the 
primary  impact analysis as the pre- intervention or 
baseline measure of the behavioral outcome; it is 
included in the models so that individual -level 
change or difference can be assessed at the 10th 
grade follow -up. 
 [ADDRESS_632500] three months.  
Individual level covariates   
Age The variable is measured as the respondent’s age in years at baseline.  
 
The measure is constructed from the following item on the Participant 
Questionnaire: 
 
• Date of birth  
 
The variable is calculated by [CONTACT_491754].  
 
The resulting variable is continuous.  Research has shown that likelihood of engaging in 
sex increases with age, while number  of sexual 
partners increases (Brewster 1999; Kirby 2007; 
Miller et al 1998; Scott -Jones and White 1990)  
Gender  The measure is operationalized a set of n- 1 dummy variables, where n refers to 
the categorized gender . 
 
The measure is taken from the following item on the baseline Participant 
Questionnaire:  
 
• Which of the following best describes you?  
o Female  
o Male  
o Transgender  
o Unknown 
o Other  
 
Responses are recoded into the following categories  and dummy variables are 
created for each : Female , Male , Other  (which includes individuals who report Research has shown t hat males report a greater 
number of sexual partners and earlier sexual 
initiation ( Miller et al 1998; Santelli et al 2000).

Transgender , Unknown , or Other ). Each dummy will be coded as 1 if the 
individual is coded as that  particular gender and 0 otherwise.   
Race  The measure is operationalized a set of n- 1 dummy variables, where n refers to 
the categorized race . 
 
The measure is taken from the following item on the baseline Participant 
Questionnaire:  
 
• What is your race? (Participants can select more than one respons e) 
o White 
o Black or African American 
o Hispanic, Latino, or of Spanish origin  
o American Indian or Alaska Native 
o Asian  
o Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander  
o Some other race (specify)  
 
The category Hispanic, Latino, or of Spanish Origin is not considered in the 
operationalization of the race variable (it is used to create a separate 
Hispanic/Latino indicator variable). Remaining r esponses are recoded into the 
following mutually exclusive categories  and dummy variables are created for 
each: White only, Black only, Other race only  (which includes American 
Indian/Alaskan Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, and 
Other ), Race not selected (individual did not select any racial category),  and 
Multiracial  (which includes individuals who selected more than one racial 
category).   
 
Each dummy will be coded as 1 if the individual is coded as that particular race 
and 0 otherwise.   Research has shown that Black/African American 
and Hispanic adolesc ents are more likely to 
engage in sex during adolescence and initiate 
sexual activity at a younger age (Blum 2000; 
Brewster 1999; Hogan et al 2000; Kirby 2007; 
Scott Jones and White 1990)  
 
Hispanic, 
Latino or of 
Spanish 
origin The measure is operationalized  as a dummy variable, where 0 = identify as 
another ethnicity /do not identify ethnicity ; 1 = identify as Hispanic, Latino or of 
Spanish origin.   
The measure is taken from the following item on the baseline Participant 
Questionnaire:  Research has shown that Black/African American 
and Hispanic adolescents are more likely to 
engage in sex during adolescence and initiate 
sexual activity at a younger age (Blum 2000; 
Brewster 1999; Hogan et al 2000; Kirby 2007;

o Black or African American 
o Hispanic, Latino, or of Spanish origin  
o American Indian or Alaska Native 
o Asian  
o Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander  
o Some other race (specify)  
 
Variable will be coded as 1 if participant self -identified as Hispanic, Latino or of 
Spanish origin, regardless as to whether other races/ethnicities are specified; 
Hispanic, Latino or of Spanish origin is not selected, the response will be coded 
as 0.

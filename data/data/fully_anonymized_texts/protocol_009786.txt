October, [ADDRESS_918347] in reducing the rate of sacral fractures.  
 
Figure 1:  Phase Transition into Clinical Trials  
 
 
 
Based on the data published in animal models, we hypothesized that bone degradation after irradiation is 
associated with clinically detectable changes in serum markers, bone density, and bone architecture. This 
study is a step towards better characterizing  those changes in humans, and understanding the mechanism 
of the underlying pathology. The results of this research may ultimately lead to the development of 
interventions aimed at reducing the burden of radiation -induced fractures, as outlined in Figure 1:

12 months following treatment with high doses of radiation  
1.3.2 To analyze the effects of high doses of radiation on the structure and mechanical properties 
of bone by [CONTACT_678796] (micro -CT), and nanoindentation

2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Rationale  
 
External beam radiation plays an important role in the management of bone malignancies. In combination 
with surgical resection, high dose radiation  was shown to significantly improve survival in historically 
difficult to treat tumors [4, 6, 15, 22]. The de trimental effects of radiation increase proportionally with the 
dose delivered. Even at relatively low doses of radiation (30 to 40 Gy), skeletal complications such as 
radiation -induced osteoporosis, insufficiency fractures (see  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3), physeal arrest, and non -union are common [2, 14, 21, 29, 33]. At high doses (70 Gy and 
above), the rate of bone -related complications increases dramatically. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] t he high rate of 
complications, high -dose radiation is becoming increasingly more utilized because of its positive effects 
on patient survival and prevention of recurrence. For example, combination of surgery and adjuvant 
radiation doses of greater than 70 Gy achieves meaningful control of locally aggressive tumors (like 
sacral chordomas), that otherwise have a very high rate of recurrence [6].

Figure 3: Bilateral Sacral Fractures  
 
 
Given its growing significance in the tre atment of malignant bone tumors, we propose to investigate the 
impact of high dose radiation (over 70 Gy) on human bone metabolism, architecture, and mechanical 
properties. It is presently unknown what biological mechanisms and structural changes occur in human 
bone in response to high doses of radiation. Local effects on bone may differ for different parts of the 
body. To minimize the variability in bone properties, we have chosen to focus this study on one type of 
bone - the sacrum. Still, our results are  likely to be generalizable to other bones because of the common 
physiology. Sacrum is a particularly good target for this study because 1) tumors affecting the sacrum are 
often treated with high doses of radiation and 2) sacrum is one of the bones maximal ly affected by [CONTACT_447] -
radiation complications .  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure [ADDRESS_918352] ures as high as 
64% in patients treated with high dose radiation and surgery  (submitted) . Thus, for the purposes of this 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_678772].  
 
Most MGH patients with sacral tumors are treated w ith combination of surgery and adjuvant radiation.  
They receive 50.4 Gy of photon/ proton beam radiation before surgery, in accordance with the protocol 
summarized in  Figure 9 (A). After the tumor is surgically removed, patients receive another 19.8 Gy  of 
radiation, for a total dose of 70. 2 Gy. We plan to enroll 20 patients treated in this fashion into the 
“Surgical Arm” of the study. It has been previou sly suggested that in patients treated with combination of 
surgery and radiation, the high rate of sacral fractures may be partially attributable to surgery. Yet, sacral 
fractures have been reported in patients who were treated with radiation alone. There is no data to date 
that can account for these observations. To explore this question, we plan to enroll 10 patients treated 
with radiation alone into the “Non -surgical Arm” of our study. These patients receive between [ADDRESS_918353] of High Doses of Radiation on Bone Structure and Metabolism

  (osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma ) to 77.4  Gy (for chordoma) of radiation over the course of 7  to 8.5  
weeks, as outlined in Figure 9 (B).  
 
The long term goal of this research is to improve treatment outcomes and quality of life in patients with 
tumors of any origin, who undergo treatment with radiation. We hope that the results of this translational 
research may ultimately enable the predication of patients at risk of fracture and al low intervention before 
fracture occurs.

including metastatic disease.  
 
2.3 Bone Labeling Drugs  
 
2.3.1 Tetracycline  
 
Tetracycline is an FDA -approved anti -microbial drug, available in the US in generic form. It has minimal, 
well-documented adverse effects. Tetracycline can be safely self -administered by [CONTACT_89410] a form of 
oral pi[INVESTIGATOR_678773]. In this study, it will be used as a fluorescent label for dynamic bone 
histomorphom etry studies, in accordance with a well -established protocol. Manufacturer: Varies  
2.3.2 Demeclocycline (Declomycin)  
 
Demeclocycline is an FDA -approved anti -microbial drug, available in the US in generic form. It is a 
tetracycline derivative, and has a similar safety profile. All associated adverse effects are minimal and 
well-documented. Demeclocycline can be safely self -administered by [CONTACT_89410] a form of oral pi[INVESTIGATOR_678774]. In this study, it will be used as an accessory fluorescent lab el (in addition to tetracycline) 
for dynamic histomorphometry studies, in accordance with a well -established  protocol. Manufacturer:

  2.4.1 Serum Markers  
 
A number o f circulating serum molecules are used clinically as markers of bone turnover rate and bone 
remodeling. N -Telopeptide (NTX) is a breakdown products of Type I collagen molecule, which is 
particularly abundant in bone. It has  been shown to be useful in predi cting the risk of fractures [32] and 
other skeletal complications in cancer patients [17].  We will als test serum tartrate -resistant acid 
phosphatase 5b (TRAP5b). TRAP 5b may reflect defferent aspects of osteoclast function; osteoclast 
adhesion, osteoclast  number and degradation  of non -collagenous proteins [37 , 38]. We will use these 
measurements as markers of bone resorption . In addition, we will measure several markers of bone 
formation : osteocalcin (OC) and  type 1 procollagen N-terminal  (P1NP ). 
In additi on to bone -specific markers, we will measure calcium  (as part of s atandard metabolic panel) , 
phosphate, parathyroid hormone levels (PTH), and [ADDRESS_918356]  
 
Quantitative computer tomography analysis (QCT) is a high resolution imaging technique that can detect 
changes in bone mineralization density and trabecular bone density [20, 33]. Figure 5 (E) shows the 
difference between two bone types. Cortical bone is thick and solid, and provides the weight -bearing 
strength of bone. Trabecular bone is porous, and has a woven -like structure. Radiation causes sclerosi s of 
the trabecular bone, rendering it solid and dense, like cortical bone. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_678775], 
irradiated bone becomes brittle and prone to fractures. Traditional method of measuring bone density by 
[CONTACT_751]-energy X -ray absorptiometry (DEXA) me asures an average density of cortical and trabecular bone. 
It cannot differentiate between normal bone and fragile, irradiated bone affected by [CONTACT_678799]. QCT can 
measure the density of trabecular bone directly. Figure 5(A-C) shows the axial, coronal and sagittal scans 
of the lumbar vertebral body by [CONTACT_678800]. A three -dimensional reconstruction of a slice through the vertebral 
body allows determination of the architecture of the trabecular bone, as illustrated in Figure 5(D).

through the anterior aspect of the L4, the sacral alae, and midline of S 1, avoiding any areas of abnormal 
anatomy or sclerosis due to fractures or degenerative c hanges. The Hounsfield unit values are then 
entered into software to calculate values for the trabecular bone mineral density (Tb. BMD) in the region 
of interest.

2.4.3 Bone Histomo rphometry  
 
Histomorphometry is broadly defined as the measurement of the shape or form of a tissue. Bone 
histomorphometry is a quantitative analysis of bone structure and bone remodeling.  It provides valuable 
information on the amount of bone and its cell ular activity. Static histomorphometry allows quantitative 
evaluation of bone structure and cellular content at any particular time point. Undecalcified bone samples 
embedded in plastic resin are used for this purpose. Cellular content of is evaluated by 
[CONTACT_678801]. Changes in bone structure and the volume of mineralized tissue 
are assessed by [CONTACT_84798] -computed tomography, quantitative back scatter electron imaging, and 
nanoindentation.  
 
Dynamic histomorphometry  provides a quantitati ve assessment of the extent of bone formation over a 
specific period of time (usually 10 -14 days). If a fluorescent label, such as tetracycline, is present, it 
becomes incorporated into the newly formed bone, leaving a clear linear record of the site where  
mineralization was occurring (see Figure 7). If a second label is given [ADDRESS_918358] one, one 
can calculate the mineral apposition rate  (MAR, mm/day) as the distance between the midpoints of the 
two consecutive labels, divided by [CONTACT_678802]. The bone formation 
rate (BFR/BS, mm3/mm2/day) is the amount of newly formed bone seen under the fluorescent microscope 
divided by [CONTACT_678803]. We will use a quadruple labeling  
scheduele, u sing two sets of double tetracycline labels witch differ  in color und er fluorescent light. This 
way we will be able to distinguish the first and second label set. This technique has the great advantage 
that the patient can serve as his or her own pretreatment control, eliminating problems caused by [CONTACT_678804]  [39].

2.4.4 Micro -computed tomography (micro -CT) 
 
Microtomography (micro -CT) is used for in vitro bone studies. It uses a similar technique to conventional 
X-ray tomography systems (regular CT scans),  but with much finer resolution.   Morphological parameters 
of any object can be analyzed with very high precision using three -dimensional reconstructions. The 
process is non -destructive and requires no special preparation of the specimen.  Micro -CT can measure 
static morphological parameters of bone microscopic architecture. The bone volume fraction (BV/TV), 
trabecular thickness (Tb. Th.), trabecular separation ( Tb. Sp.), trabecular number (Tb. N.), Connectivity 
density (Conn.D), structure model index (SMI), and trabecular bone pattern factor (TBPf) provide 
information about the characteristics of the trabecular bone structure. In networks of trabecular bone, 
conn ectivity density provides an estimation of the number of trabecular connections per unit volume. The 
structure model index determines the geometry o f the intertrabecular network.  
2.4.[ADDRESS_918359] with a 
known amount of force. Traditional indentation methods measured hardness of materials from the  area of 
the “footprint” left in the sample by [CONTACT_678806]. Nanoindentation creates “footprints”  in the 
submicrometer range , much too small to examine without a powerful microscope. Instead, it uses 
specialized depth sensing equipment to  make  tiny indentations in  the surface. At the same time it records 
the load and displacement of the indenter with very high accuracy and precision . A load -displacement 
curve is constructed from the recorded values ( Figure 8). Experimental data can be interpreted using 
analytical models to obtain hardness, the elastic modulus, and other mechanical properties.

  Figure 8: Schematic Representation of a Typi[INVESTIGATOR_678778] -Displ acement Curve  
 
 
We will measure the elastic modulus of bone from the unloading segment of the load -displacement curve 
using the Oliver -Pharr method. The elastic modulus is a measurement of bone’s ability to resist 
mechanical stress. Healthy bone is strong and it effectively resists the outsi de forces exerted on it. When 
the body is in the upright position, gravity exerts a significant force on the bones of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_678779]. Healthy bone resists deformation: it returns to its original form when the force is 
removed. In contrast, bone weakened by [CONTACT_678807], like walking. Gravity causes it to deform permanently; even when the force is removed or 
reduced, the deformation remains. This is the mechanism propose d to explain the development of sacral 
insufficiency fractures after radiation. We want to measure the elastic modulus of bone in the sacrum 
before and after radiation to characterize the effect of radiation on the elastic properties. It is exceedingly 
likely that the pathogenesis of radiation -induced sacral insufficiency fractures is multifactorial. Given this 
complexity, the ability to isolate the effect of radiation on elastic property makes nanoindentation a 
uniquely valuable tool for our study.

imaging  is determined by [CONTACT_678808].   Patients planned for surgery 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_678780] -operative  MRI of their pelvis and/or sacrum.  In addition, patients often receive a 
pelvic or sacral computed tomographic image.  A CT of the chest is performed to evaluate for pulmonary 
metastasis. Figure [ADDRESS_918367] treatment 
includes p re-operative radiation of 5 0.4 Gy, followed by a recovery period of approximately 4 to 5 weeks .  
Surgery involves removing the malignant tumor in the sacrum in one pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959], preferably with a cuff of 
normal tissue around the tumor. After approximately  6 week s of recovery , to allow the surgical incision to 
heal, the patient is treated with another 19.8 Gy up to 27 Gy of radiation postoperatively depending  on the 
final margin status (higher for gross residual disease) , as outlined in Figure 9(A).  If the wound is not 
healed or there is another medical reason to delay adjuvant radiation, then radiation may begin later . The 
patients are typi[INVESTIGATOR_678781] 3 months with an MRI of the pelvis/sacrum to evaluate for a local 
recurrence. A CT scan is often ordered if there is a concern for a fracture.  In addition, patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_508336] a chest x -ray at [ADDRESS_918368] is ordered at 6 months and 12 
months after surgery.  The same protocol is used during the second year of follow up.  Non -surgical 
candidates receive 7 2 up to 77.4 Gy of radiation depending  on the histology (72 Gy for osteosarcoma and 
chondrosarcoma and 77.4 Gy for chordoma) as outli ned in Figure 9 (B).

Biopsies will be done at the time of the scheduled tumor surgery. Sacral tumors are removed in stages. 
The first stage is done via anterior exposure, allowing access to the iliac crest. We will collect these 
samples first. Using a 7,5mm [COMPANY_002]ster trephine  two bone samples will be removed f rom the superior 
apex of the iliac wing in the midline (as defined as a point midway between the anterior superior and 
posterior superior iliac crests. In most cases, the biopsy site will be accessible through the incision made 
for the anterior approach. H owever, in those rare cases when the biopsy site is not accessible via the 
incision made as part of the standard of care, then a separate small incision (at most 3 cm long) will have 
to be made.  
 
The second stage is done via posterior approach, providing access to the sacrum. We will collect the 
second biopsy samples during the second stage procedure. Using the same 7,5mm [COMPANY_002]ster trephine , 
two bone samples will be removed from bone within one centimeter of the resection margin. To avoid 
unnecessary damag e to healthy bone, we will attempt to collect the bone samples from the part of sacrum 
removed in surgery. After the tumor has been resected, it is normally brought to surgical pathology by [CONTACT_37040].  There the specimen is examined by [CONTACT_10063]. I f there is enough normal bone remaining 
on the resected specimen, and the pathologist feels that using the normal bone will not interfere with his

11. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
11.1 Definitions  
11.1.1  Adverse Event (AE)  
 
An adverse event (AE) is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition or 
experience that develops or worsens in severity after starting any study procedure 
specified in the protocol . 
 
Effect of High Doses of Radiation on Bone Structure and Metabolism  
October, 5, [ADDRESS_918399] results constitute a dverse events only if 
they induce clinical signs or symptoms or require treatment or further diagnostic tests.  
 
 
 
11.1.2  Serious adverse event (SAE)  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event, occurring as a result of one of the 
study procedures :  
• Resul ts in death  
• Is life -threatening. Life -threatening means that the person was at immediate risk 
of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which 
hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more sever form.  
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (i.e., the event required at least a 
24-hour hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57891] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_176253]). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6930]/or surgical operations scheduled 
to occur during  the study period, but planned prior to study entry are not 
considered SAEs if the illness or disease existed before the person was enrolled 
in the trial, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected manner during 
the trial (e.g., surgery performe d earlier than planned).  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is defined as a 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or  
• Is an important medical event when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it 
may jeopardize the participant and require medical  or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events 
include allergic bronchospasm  requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
Events not considered to be serious adverse events are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]:  
• routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any 
deterioration in condition, or for elective procedures  
• elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that did not worsen  
• emergency out patient treatment for an event not fulfilling the serious criteria 
outlined above and not resulting in inpatient admission  
• respi[INVESTIGATOR_4594]  
 
11.1.3  Expectedness  
 
Adverse events can be 'Expected' or 'Unexpected.'  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Expected adverse event  
 
Expected adverse events are those that have been previously identified as 
resulting from administration of the bone labeling drug . For the purposes of this 
Effect of High Doses of Radiation on Bone Structure and Metabolism  
October, 5, [ADDRESS_918400], th e Investigator’s Brochure, the package insert or is included 
in the informed consent document as a potential risk.    
 
Refer to Section 6.1 for a listing of expected adverse events associated with 
the bone labeling drugs.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Unexpected adverse event  
  
For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered unexpected  when 
it varies in nature, intensity or frequency from information provided in the 
current adverse event list, the Investigator’s Brochure, the package insert or 
when it is not included in th e informed consent document as a potential risk.   
11.1.4  Attribution  
 
Attribution is the relationship between an adverse event or serious adverse event and the 
study treatment. Attribution will be assigned as follows:  
 
• Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the  study treatment.  
• Probable – The AE is likely related  to the study treatment.  
• Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
• Unlikely - The AE is doubtfully related  to the study treatment.  
• Unrelated - The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
11.[ADDRESS_918401] or other means, will be recorded 
in the participant’s medical record and on the appropriate study -specific case report forms.

14.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
 
Berthold and Haras published a range of normal reference values for the trabecular bone mineral density 
measured by [CONTACT_678821][INVESTIGATOR_678791]. In healthy males and females the mean 
trabecular bone mineral density was 150mg /mL with a standard deviation of 20mg/mL at the start of 
puberty. In contrast, we expect our patients to be considerably older, to have one or many systemic 
illnesses, and to have tumors in the sacrum that can compromise bone quality. We expect that mean bone 
density at the start of the treatment in our population will be considerably lower. Assuming that it’s at 
least [ADDRESS_918418] deviation less that of a normal young adult, we get an estim ate of 130mg/dL at the start of 
treatment in all study patients. It is likely that our population will exhibit significant differences by [CONTACT_678822]. In absence of prior studies, it 
is very  difficult to estimate this difference. In fact, the purpose of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_678792]. At present, we must carry our sample size calculations 
keepi[INVESTIGATOR_678793].  
 
The “ event of interest” in this study is a change in trabecular bone density. Our hypothesis is that 
radiation induces loss of trabecular bone density in surgical and non -surgical patients.  We would like to 
be able to detect a change in the average bone densit y of 10 mg/mL (approximately 5%) before and after 
radiation treatment. Assuming the standard deviation of the change we hope to observe is 15mg/dL, we 
get the following estimates.  
 
Size = 30, Power = 0.942, alpha = 0.05  
Size = 20, Power = 0.807, alpha = 0 .05  
Size = 10, Power = 0.469, alpha = 0.[ADDRESS_918419] majority of our patients receive surgery,  the time it would take to enroll 20 patients into the non -
surgical arm would undermine the purpose of doing an exploratory study to begin with.    
 
The Kolmogorov –Smirnov test on the normality of the distribution of bone mineral density and trabecular 
bone mineral density values will be carried out in each group. To evaluate the effects of radiation, we will

14.[ADDRESS_918422] will be performed on the differences between the two groups 
in the average values of PROMIS T scores . A P -value of 0.05 will be considered  to be statistically 
signiﬁcant. Spearman and Kendall rank correlations will be used to measure the strength of dependence 
between the bone mineral density and exploratory variables whenever possible .

This descriptive study is intended to provide feedback from participant s about their 
experience using the lebrikizumab  pen when delivering a simulated injection into an injection 
pad. The participant ’s experience will be evaluated based on their responses to the modified 
Subcutaneous Administration Assessment Questionnaire ( mSQAAQ) , a PRO questionnaire  
for evaluating one’s experience (e.g., ease of use and confidence in using)  with a device to 
administer a SC injection.9,10 
 
Participant s will perform a simulated injection and provide their feedback on the experience.  
The participants  will perform the tasks independently after training by [CONTACT_3476]. Since 
there is active drug in the pen , the site staff will remain in the room with the participant  
during their simulated injection into the injection pad. After the simulated injection, a trained 
study site staff  will distribute  the mSQAAQ for the participant to complete independently 
onsite .

Lebrikizumab (LY3650150) is an IgG4 mAb that binds with high affinity and slow off -rate 
to IL -13 and selectively inhibits IL -13 signaling through the IL -4Rα/IL -13Rα1 pathway, 
thereby [CONTACT_786461] -13 with high potency. Lebrikizumab- bound 
IL-13 can still bind IL -13Rα2, allowing subsequent internalization and natural clearance of 
IL-13. Blockade of IL -13 signaling is expected to be of benefit in diseases in which IL -13 is 
a central cytokine to the disease pathogenesis, such as  atopic dermatitis ( AD). 
Lebrikizumab has been investigated for the treatment of AD, asthma, COPD, IPF, and RHL. 
Currently, lebrikizumab is being actively developed for the treatment of AD. Lebrikizumab is also being investigated for the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis (P AR) and chronic 
rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) . 
An Investigator’s  Brochure  for the drug provides a summary of the clinical studies conducted 
for lebrikizumab  and the associated findings .  
5.[ADDRESS_1081831] container assembled inside the pen  (Figure 1 ). The 
combined container and pen  form a prefilled, single -use, injection device that delivers a fixed 
dose of drug product subcutaneously. The drug will remain in the container until the drug is injected. The pen  uses a fixed needle injection depth that is inserted perpendicular to the skin 
without the need to raise a skinfold (i.e., a flat -surface injection) to deliver an SC injection.  
 To facilitate understanding of the operation of the pen, refer to Figure 1
 and the J2T-MC-
KGBY [CONTACT_786462]  (IFU). Further guidance and information for the final disposition 
of unused study interventions are provided in the Pharmacy Manual7 and Dose Preparation  
Instructions8. 
 The solution in the pen requires storage under refrigerated conditions (2
oC to 8oC). Prior to 
use, the pen is removed from the refrigerator and allowed to warm to room temperature for 
[ADDRESS_1081832] -off Cap that pulls the syringe needle shield off.  
The pen base is placed flat and firmly onto the patient’s skin at the injection site. The base of 
the device helps to orient the needle perpendicular to the skin.  After placement on the skin, 
Protocol #[ZIP_CODE]/J2T -MC-KGBY    
 
12APR 2024_v1.0  15 Concentrics Research,  
 CONFIDENTIAL  an IQVIA Business  the device is unlocked by [CONTACT_786463] (lock 
indicator) to the Unlock Symbol. The device can be activated only when the lock indicator is aligned with the Unlock Symbol.  The user activates the device by [CONTACT_786464]. This generates an audible and tactile click and the device automatically performs the following steps:  
 
1. Inserts needle into the skin  
2. Injects the solution  
3. Delays needle retraction to ensure complete delivery  
4. Retracts the needle.  
 The user must hold the device firmly against the skin during the injection cycle but is not required to maintain pressure on the Injection Button. The device generates an audible and tactile click at the end of the needle retraction process. The device locks the retracted needle in place for disposal of the used pen  into a sharp container.  
 The pen was developed according to the requirements established by [CONTACT_786465] -based injection systems for medical use (ISO [ZIP_CODE]- 1 and ISO [ZIP_CODE]- 5). An 
Investigator’s Brochure for the device outlines the testing and associated findings for the device.

5.4 Rationale for Study Design  
Autoinjectors ( AI) and prefilled syringes ( PFS)  are commonly accepted as safe and effective 
for their intended use.  Thus, the development of the AI  to deliver  lebrikizumab is based on 
the evidence of benefit, as observed in similar approved AIs.  Whereas other commercially 
available A Is are designed to deliver [ADDRESS_1081834] , the lebrikizumab AI is 
designed to deliver 2 mL of the study drug.  The 2 -mL AI has been used in the lebrikizumab 
clinical development program in  Studies J2T-DM-KGAA (KGAA) and J2T -MC-KGBG 
(KGBG).4  The results of these studies demonstrate that the 2- mL AI is a viable device for 
the SC administration of lebrikizumab.  The 2-mL AI for delivering lebrikizumab will be 
referred to as the lebrikizumab pen for the purposes of this study.  
The study design for the current ease of use study is  descriptive in nature ( 51 participant s) 
and intended to provide relevant information about the participant  experience with the 
lebrikizumab  pen. The population will be comprised of individuals with AD with no prior AI  
or pen experience, although those with experience with other injectables will be permitted .  
Evaluation of the participant ’s experience will be based on  the mSQAAQ9,10, an instrument 
for assessing ease of use and confidence in use  of a subcutaneous device .    
5.[ADDRESS_1081835] therapeutic benefits to participant s participating in this study, the 
results from this study will offer valuable insights into the participant ’s experience with the  
lebrik izumab  pen as related to ease of use and confidence in injection . The risk s associated 
with participation in this study will be minimized because the simulated  injections will be 
performed into injection  pads and participants will be under the direct supervision of study 
staff when handling the injection devices. Participants are not injecting themselves in this 
study.   
5.6  Risks and Foreseeable Adverse Events/Device Effects  
The following is a list of potential risks associated with participation in this study:   
• Accidental needle stick injury   
• Accidental exposure to drug product (accidental self -injection)   
Protocol #[ZIP_CODE]/J2T -MC-KGBY    
 
12APR 2024_v1.0  18 Concentrics Research,  
 CONFIDENTIAL  an IQVIA Business  • Injection site reaction or hypersensitivity event associated with exposure to drug 
product via accidental injection   
The following is a list of potential risks associated with the study devices:   
• Improper functioning and/or mechanical failure of the device or its components (for example, no injection, slow injection into injection  pad, partial injection into injection  
pad, cracked syringes, high force to operate device, damaged needle)   
• Skin reaction due to exposure of drug product on skin   
5.[ADDRESS_1081836] sharps handling/disposal is part of the study training, and no cross contamination is expected due to each partic ipant receiving 
their own device, as well as injecting drug into a n injection  pad. Participants will be 
instructed to place the base  cap in the sharps container once it is removed from the device,  so 
they do not have the temptation to recap. Study staff wi ll monitor the participants at all times 
in the room and intervene should a dangerous situation occur.   
Participants will be under direct supervision of the study staff when handling the device.    
The following controls will be in place to prevent an accidental  dose of drug product :  
1. The participants will only handle the devices under direct supervision of study staff 
after receiving training.   
2. Participants will be told that they should not inject themselves, and these devices will only be used for simulated injections into an injection pad.   
3. If a participant appears to begin injecting themselves rather than the injection pad, the 
site staff will immediately interrupt the process and stop the participant from 
completing this self -injection.   
4. In the unlikely circumstance that a participant does have an accidental needle stick or 
accidental injection, it is not likely the participant would receive a full dose since a full dose takes up to 15 seconds for delivery.     
If a needlestick injury occurs or if a patient is exposed to drug, medical personnel will be 
available to address any potential medical issues or concerns. Clinical staff members will follow (monitor) the participant as per clinical judgment for a potentia l adverse event (AE) 
and follow the appropriate device -reporting procedures for 7 days following  the visit.   
 More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks of lebrikizumab 
may be found in the lebrikizumab investigator’s brochure  (IB)

 CONFIDENTIAL  an IQVIA Business  6 DESCRIPTION OF DESIGN AND TRIAL POPULATION  
6.1 Overall Trial and Design and Plan  
This study is an open- label, single site , ease of use study of the lebrikizumab pen and consists 
of a single study visit for approximately 56 adult participants. All participants will receive 
training and perform simulated  injections on a practice pad using the pen .  Participants will 
be under the supervision of a study interviewer when handling the pen and will complete the 
mSQAAQ9,10 following the simulated  injection.  
No treatment will be administered to the participants.  
6.2 Administrative Structure of the Trial 
This is a n ease- of-use study (with a simulated injection ) with a planned analysis population 
of [ADDRESS_1081837] mirror and cameras. The setting is a non- clinical setting arranged similar to a 
home environment with similar lighting and sound.  
The participant  will be given training on the use of the pen and then given an opportunity to 
simulate administration of a dose into an injection pad.  Following the injection experience, 
the participant  will self -administer the m SQAAQ9,10.  
6.3 Selection of Participant Population  
The participant s will be recruited from the site database. A log of all participant s enrolled 
into the study (i.e. having signed the Informed Consent Form) will be maintained by [CONTACT_195765]. Minimal personal health information (PHI) will be gathered which will include  
the approximate dat e of their AD diagnosis, any previous or current treatments , any known 
experience with  administering drugs by [CONTACT_786466] , and if the individual is of 
child -bearing potential  (see Section 9.2.1 ) , they will be tested to rule out pregnancy give n 
the risk of accidental  exposure to drug.

10.1 Data Collection 
Case Report Form (CRF) d ata will be collected using a 21 CFR Part 11 compliant electronic 
data capture system  (EDC) , the IQVIA Research Management Platform  (RMP)  v2.6. Data 
from recruitment and pre -screening  will be captured separately  and not entered into the RMP 
EDC system . Since the study is being conducted in person, a paper informed consent and a 
paper 24- hour SAE report form will be used.  
CRF data will include:  
• Confirmation of inclusion and exclusion criteria  
• Participant demographics  
• REALM2 score  
• Confirmation of pen /AI experience (i.e., pen /AI naïve, any other experience with 
injectables)  
• Pregnancy test results for participants AFAB unless considered I NOCBP   
• Brief medical history (approximate date of AD diagnosis and previous or current 
treatments)  
• Responses to the 10 questions in the m SQAAQ9,10 
• Adverse events (AE)  
• Serious adverse events (SAE)  
10.2 Sample Size 
The planned final  sample size of 51 is sufficient to provide descriptive insights about the 
study population. Given the nature of the study it is expected that %+ of participants 
enrolled will complete the study and provide full analyzable data.  
 Under the assumption that % of the participants will respond “agreed” or “strongly 
agreed” to the device being “easy to use” and  “they are confident they can use the device” we 
will have 95% confidence that the response rate is located in this range of proportions : [% 
- %]. Table 3 shows a variety of possible sample sizes . For the purpose of the intended 
claims the 95% CI lower bound should remain above %, preferably above %, and the parameters for the calculation of sample size have been selected for that.

12.9 Unexpected Adverse Event  
As defined by 21 CFR 312.32 (a), an unexpected adverse drug experience is:  
“An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not 
listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been 
observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available , is not consistent with 
the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amended. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14213]) if the  investigator brochure referred 
only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14214]) if the investigator brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents. “Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the

design elements of the product.  
Product complaints related to study interventions used in clinical trials are collected to ensure 
the safety of participants, monitor quality, and to facilitate process and product 
improvements.  
If the participant identifies a product complaint or a problem with the study intervention, 
investigators will instruct participants to contact [CONTACT_786474].  
An event may meet the definition of both a product complaint and an AE/SAE. In such cases, it should be reported as both a product complaint and as an AE/SAE.  
Device deficiencies are product complaints.  
12.9.3  Recording and Follow-Up of AE and/or SAE and Product Complaints  
When an AE/SAE /product complaint occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to 
review all documentation (for example, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory reports, and 
diagnostics reports) related to the event.  
The investigator will then record all relevant AE/ SAE/product complaint information in the 
participant’s medical records, in accordance with the investigator’s normal clinical practice. 
AE/SAE information is reported on the appropriate CRF page and product complaint 
information is reported on the Product Complaint Form.  
Note: An event may meet the definition of both a product complaint and an AE/SAE. In such cases, it should be reported as both a product complaint and as an AE/SAE.  
It is not  acceptable for the investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914]’s medical 
records to the sponsor or designee in lieu of completion of the CRF page for AE/SAE and the 
Product Complaint Form for product complaints.  
There may be instances when copi[INVESTIGATOR_786454]. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the 
participant number, will be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_786455].  
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.

1. BACKGROUND AND JUSTIFICATION 
Echocardiography, or ultrasound imaging of the heart, provides real time imaging of the blood flow and heart 
functioning. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is a form of non-invasive imaging where a sonographer uses 
an ultrasound probe on the ch est to view the heart. While this type of echocardiography has only minor risks, 
such as discomfort, and does no t require extensive preparation,  body tissues and organs  may prevent clear or 
complete visualization of the target area. 
To avoid obstructions to imagi ng associated with TTE, transesop hageal echocardiography (TEE) may be used 
to better image the heart. This ty pe of ultrasound places the t ransducer in the esophagus, close to the heart. 
TEE has been shown to outperform TTE1,2 and change patient management wh en used to evaluate cardiac 
etiology.2 Beyond regular two-di mensional (2D) TEE imaging, three-/four-d imensional (3D/4D) TEE allows the 
user to see better see the depth o f image and change over time.  Imaging for mitral valve3,4, aortic valve5, 
tricuspid valve4, left and right ventricles6, and masses7 have shown to be equal to or improved compared to 
regular 2D imaging strategies. 
The current study will investigate a small TEE probe, called th e 9VT-D TEE (4D Micro T EE) probe, intended for 
use on smaller patients, such as  children. Currently, the only post-market 4D TEE pr obes available are 
designed for adult patients and ar e only approved for use in ad ults. This is considered a semi-invasive imaging 
application and is typi[INVESTIGATOR_246305]. To optimize live or moving 
images, simulation data and phant om images may not be adequate.  Porcine (pig) and canine (dog) models 
have similar anatomical structu res to humans, making porcine an d canine models optimal for pre-clinical 
testing.8,[ADDRESS_299632] user  feedback an d de-ident ified images from investigational Vivid E95 v206 
system and probes during TTE and TEE exams. The results of this  study are intended primarily for use in 
engineering evaluation and optim ization of the device and may b e used for augmenting design verification and 
design validation. This evaluati on may generate reference image s/data to support regulat ory filings but will not 
generate clinical evidence to sup port regulatory claims. Result s may be used to help comm ercialize the product 
in other global regi ons in the future, at t he discretion of the  Sponsor. Funding for this stu dy will be provided by 
[CONTACT_55256].

components/accessories used in this study will be retained by t he Sponsor as part of the clini cal history file (CHF), 
as required by [CONTACT_774]. 
The Vivid E95 v206 is a pre-mark et diagnostic ultrasound system  that provides digital acquisition, processing, 
analysis and display capability. It consists  of a mobile consol e with a control panel, touch panel, and display 
monitor. The system includes el ectronics for transmit and recei ve of ultrasound data, ultrasound signal 
processing, software computing, hardware for image storage, har d copy printing, and network access to the 
facility. The Vivid E95 v206 emp loys the same fundamental scien tific technology as the commercially available 
predicate Vivid E95. 
The 9VT-D TEE probe is  a pre-market probe that functions primar ily by [CONTACT_246322] 3D imaging for 
pediatric use cases. Currently approved 4D TEE probes are avail able for adult patients, which are too large to 
use for pediatrics. Only 2D TEE probes are available for pediat ric patients. The 9VT-D TEE probe will be used 
with the pre-market Vivid E95 v2 06 cardiovascular ultrasound sy stem. Commercially available probes may also 
be provided for use with the Vivi d E95 v206 system for TTE exam s in this study. 
The research device, instruction s for use, or packaging shall i ndicate that the research d evice is for use in a 
research investigation, per FDA  21 CFR §812.[ADDRESS_299633] processing of images. Results of 
this study may be used in curre nt and future technology develop ment and scientific evaluation. 
 Intended Use 
The Vivid E95 ultras ound system is intended to be used for a va riety of diagnostic cardiovascular procedures on 
pediatric and adult patients. Viv id E95 is a general purpose ul trasound system, specialized for use in cardiac 
imaging. It is intended for use by , or under the direction of a  qualified physician for ultrasound imaging, 
measurement, display and analysis  of the human body and fluid. The  9VT-D TEE probe is int ended for use by a 
duly licensed physician who has r eceived appropriate training i n endoscopic techniques as  dictated by [CONTACT_246323]. It i s intended to be used on pediat rics; the minimum reco mmended patient weight 
limit is 5kg. It may also be used on smaller patients, based up on the physician’s clinical judgement of benefit/risk 
for the individual patient. 
The procedures conducted in this  study are intended for device development purposes.

 Concomitant / Ancillary Administrations 
 Medications and Biologic Products 
No medications or biologic produ cts will be admin istered as par t of study procedures. A s part of the standard of 
care at the site, subjects may rec eive anesthesia. Clinically n ecessary medications for the subjects’ prescribed 
medical procedure shall be admin istered per the site standard c are and participation in th is study will not alter 
their standard care. 
 Laboratory Tests and Sample Processing 
No laboratory tests or sample processing is planned as part of the study procedures . 
 Accountability 
Accurate and adequ ate records will be main tained for all device s, from time of shipment to t he site until return or 
disposal of all devices issued by [CONTACT_246324] s tudy, as required by [CONTACT_198990]. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_246307] h devices at the 
investigational site  during the study. 
 Issuance 
The research  device will be provided by [CONTACT_1034]. No calibra tion/maintenance procedures are planned for 
this study. Software updates m ay be made during the study. 
 Disposition 
The device will be dispositioned after the study and returned t o the Sponsor, per applicable laws and 
regulations. 
 Anticipated Risks and Benefits 
The device  under study has undergone risk a ssessment, per International St andards Organization (ISO) [ZIP_CODE], 
and risks have been mitigated to l evels as far as possible (AFA P). Verification of the system will be completed, 
including mitigation of hazards and functional changes impactin g the study, and that the system device features 
operate as expected. Additionally, e lectromagnetic interference  testing will have been co mpleted to ensure the 
investigational device does not i mpact other electronic medical  devices, and acoustic output verification testing 
will be completed to ensure tha t the energy output from the sys tem is within acceptable ranges. The measures 
ensure that the devices used in  the study are equivalent to sys tems that already meet the requirements for CE 
mark and are used for diagnosis outside of the [LOCATION_003]. Validation of user requirements an d expectations will be 
completed for the device. 
The risks associated with the in vestigational device are not ex pected to be greater than those of similar 
procedures routinely conducted in clinical practice. Subjects w ill undergo procedures wit h both the standard of 
care device and the investigati onal device, so there may be an incremental risk asso ciated with the double 
procedure. Post-trial care or  follow-up is not required by [CONTACT_246325]. 
Subjects are not expected to benef it directly from study partic ipation. The results may ben efit future patients by 
[CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_246308], accessories, and software. This  may provide better imagi ng for pediatric patients 
in the future. 
 Risk Category and Rationale 
The 9VT-D TEE probe, as used in  this study, is considered a sig nificant risk device per 21 CFR §812.3(m) 
because it does present a potent ial for serious risk to the hea lth, safety, or welfare of a subject.

4. STUDY DESIGN 
 Summary of Study Design 
This is a pre-market, open label, prospective, non-randomized c linical research study c onducted at one site in 
the [LOCATION_002]. The study will be considered co mplete when s ubject enrollment requirements are met per the 
Sponsor’s determination. The dur ation of subject participation is the time it takes to complete the ultrasound 
exam(s) (less than one day). 
This study is not intended to sup port a comparative claim or te st any hypotheses, such as superiority or non-
inferiority, so no control gro up is necessary. All reasonable a ttempts will be made to cont rol and minimize bias 
during the study. The study w ill not impact the clinically indi cated scan used for clinic al care. Subjects will be 
consecutively enrolled in this s tudy as they present at the sit e for standard of care procedures. This type of 
sampling reduces, but does not e liminate, some risks of samplin g bias. Additionally, site and Sponsor 
responsibilities are clearly defined to reduce additional biase s during the conduct of study procedures. 
 Study Population 
Subjects will be enrolled who mee t all of the inclusion criteri a and none of the ex clusion criteria  and are 
prescribed a standard of care pr ocedure using an ultrasound dev ice for a TEE exam, including either diagnostic 
or perioperative TEE, and/or a T ransthoracic Echocardiography ( TTE) exam. This population is representative 
of the general population that is expected for the device in cl inical practice. 
 Number of Subjects 
Up to [ADDRESS_299634]

 Protection of Vulnerable Subjects 
Vulnerable subjects are individu als whose willingness to volunt eer in a clinical investigation could be unduly 
influenced by [CONTACT_246326], whether justified or not, of ben efits associated with parti cipation or of retaliatory 
response from senior members of a  hierarchy in case of refusal to participate. 
The Sponsor shall avoid improper  influence on, or inducement of , the subject, monitor, any investigator(s), or 
other parties participating in, o r contributing to, the clinica l investigation. 
All investigators shall avoid im proper influence on, or inducem ent of, the subject, Spons or, monitor, other 
investigator(s), or other parti es participating in, or contribu ting to, the clinical investigation. 
Neonates, children, or minor subjects : Neonates, children, and minor s ubjects under the age of 18 ye ars old 
will be subjects in th is study. These subjec ts are considered m embers of a vulnerable research population who 
are not legally competent to prov ide valid informed consent. Th is research will be appr oved by [CONTACT_76467], and  two 
parents or legally authorized re presentatives (LARs), such as h ealth care surrogate, attorney in fact, judicially 
appointed guardian, or proxy, mus t provide written informed con sent for the child’s part icipation. Assent will be 
obtained from minor subjec ts aged 7-[ADDRESS_299635] 
and move differently than adults during scans, which introduces  additional challenges and variables. It is 
important to evaluate the device ’s performance in the intended population so it can be optimized for actual 
clinical use.

8. SAFETY 
 Anticipated Adverse Events 
 Non-invasive, or transcutaneous, ultrasound exams 
Non-invasive diagnostic ultrasound involves minimal risk becaus e it does not utilize X -rays or other types of 
ionizing radiation. Even though manifestation of risks during d iagnostic ultrasound is rare, diagnostic ultrasound 
can produce effects on the body, such as: 
Risk Description Likelihood 
Tissue warming In transcutaneous ultrasound, t he probe may heat up slightly, 
causing sensation of warmness or heat of the skin at the site o f the 
contact [CONTACT_246331]. Rare. 
Cavitation Formation of small po ckets of gas in body fluids or tissues.  Rare.  
Skin/tissue irritation 
or injury  Reddening, scrapi[INVESTIGATOR_007], stretching , pulling, or other sensations o f the 
skin/tissue that may cau se minor discomfort. 
Contact [CONTACT_246332]. Uncommon.  
Bruising or Abrasion 
(tears) in skin or 
tissue Skin bruising or abrasion/tearing caused by [CONTACT_246333].  Uncommon. 
Infection There is a very low risk of infection from cross cont amination of 
probe surface or gel, which is mo stly theoretical in case of in tact 
skin. Rare. 
The risk of these adverse effect s is not expected to be greater  for subjects in this study than those encountered 
during routine diagnostic ultra sound procedures  conducted outsi de of the study. 
The formation of an ultrasound im age necessarily requires the e xposure of regions of i nterest to ultrasonic 
energy, part of which is absorbed in the tissue through which i t propagates, and part is reflected back to the 
transducer (probe) and forms the image. Biological effects of d iagnostic ultrasound include heating of the 
tissues by [CONTACT_246334] e nergy and the risk of cavitatio n from pressure gradient passing through the 
tissue (such as lung tissue and bo wels with gas that may enter the ultrasound field of view during cardiac 
exams). The cavitation effects of acoustic energy are most pron ounced at lower than diagnostic ultrasound

frequencies (in kHz range, not M Hz range) and the human tissues  have less nucleati on sites and higher 
viscosity than water and the negat ive pressures from diagnostic  ultrasound are lower t han most testing done to 
evaluate cavitation. 
 TEE Ultrasound Imaging 
TEE probes are optimized to ensur e acceptable safety in terms o f external atraumatic sm oothness, probe size, 
trackability, steerab ility and maneuverabilit y-stiffness while allowing adequate diagnostic  imaging performance. 
The probes are also designed fo r robustness to foreseeable mish aps and reprocessing th roughout their service 
life. User attentiveness is st ill essential for safe operation of the TEE probes. 
Invasive ultrasound scans carry i nherent risks associated with invasive nature of the procedure, such as: 
Risk Description Likelihood 
Perforation Injury to the esophag us, throat and mouth could occ ur if the users are not 
appropriately trained in  endoscopic procedur es and familiar wit h the probe at 
hand. There are varied mechanisms for an esophageal perforation  during a 
TEE exam. Direct mechanical trauma can cause an esophageal perf oration; 
from a blind insertion and advan cement of the probe; size discr epancy of the 
probe tip relative to the eso phagus, and from a wide range of p robe tip 
flexion and manipulation require d to obtain certain images. Mec hanical injury 
to esophageal tract is therefor e an inherent risk due to the na ture of the TEE 
procedure. The incidence, nature and severity of esophageal tears/perforations associated wi th endoscopic procedures are we ll 
characterized. 
10Injuries vary from self-resolv ing (local minor bleeding), to 
life-threatening (perforation, m ajor bleeding, infection or dea th) requiring 
surgery or medical treatment. Si gnificant injuries are uncommon  when 
patient is low-risk, underlying t he importance of careful asses sment of 
suitability of the TEE procedur e for a particular patient. 
Indirect trauma of the GI tract may  be related to excessive or prolonged, 
continuous pressure at the TEE pr obe-mucosal interface, resulti ng in tissue 
ischemia and necrosis. The risk can be minimized by [CONTACT_246335] e pressure 
and moving the probe tip to a les s sensitive area. This may occ ur particularly 
during cardiac surgical procedures, when the TEE probe is stati oned in the 
thoracic esophagus, fo r long durations.  Rare. 
Bleeding Overstimulation of muc osa by [CONTACT_246336]. 
The external surface of the pr obe could be damaged through impa ct, which 
could expose sharp edges and lead  to bleeding. Pre-procedure in spection of 
the probe for defects is essentia l to minimize this risk, as th ese conditions 
are easily noticeable by [CONTACT_45907]. Rare. 
Infection Cross contamination c ould occur if the probe is not p roperly reprocessed or 
is damaged or worn in such a way  that micro-organisms or disinf ection 
chemicals could collect inside t he probe to be released when in tubated. 
Requirements for high-level dis infection must be met for patien t contact 
[CONTACT_95557]. 
Note, there is no adequate means to  disinfect a probe that has been 
contaminated b y prions, such as Creutzfeldt J acob’s disease. In such case, Rare.

the contaminated device/probe MU ST BE discarded in accordance w ith local 
biologic waste haz ard procedures. 
Bruising Irritation and discomfo rt of the throa t due to placeme nt and movement of the 
probe. Uncommon. 
Tissue 
warming In case of invasive ultrasound , the probe may heat internal tis sue (e.g. 
esophageal wall), but this would not be detectable to the subje ct. The 
system continuously monitors pro be temperature and shuts the pr obe down 
automatically if unsafe temperat ure is detected well before a b urn is 
expected. Rare. 
Chemical 
burns Chemical burns can occur if the probe is not completely rinsed from residue 
of harsh disinfectants. Rare. 
Electric 
shock There are electric currents pr esent inside the TEE probe. In ex tremely rare 
cases of loss of int egrity of the probe the patient may get exp osed to the risk 
of electric shock. Structural in tegrity check us ing leakage cur rent are 
incorporated as par t of reprocessing, thus  this risk is minimiz ed. Rare. 
Damage to 
dental 
fixtures Damage to teeth and dental prosthe tics is also a concern when r emoving the 
probe or using bite guards. Uncommon. 
 
The investigational device is being used in addition to the sta ndard of care device, so t here is an increased risk 
of AEs associated with this ext ended procedure. The additional scan does not have risk s beyond the standard 
of care procedure, but the seco ndary intubation may increase th e overall likelihood o f events occurring. 
The Vivid E95 v206 ultrasound sy stem is investigational and has  not been cleared by [CONTACT_1622]. However, it has 
been developed based on technologie s that are well understood a nd used in commercial ultrasound systems 
developed and marketed by [CONTACT_246337]. 
There is always a chance of unexpected risks. Throughout the st udy, the Sponsor will evaluate and update 
safety information in study documents.

NOTE: In  this consent form, “you” always refers to the research participant. 
ABOUT THIS  CONSENT FORM
You are  being invited to participate in a research study. It is important that you carefully think 
about whether being in this study is right for you and your situation.
This consent  form is meant to assist you in thinking about whether or not you want to be in this 
study. Please ask the study doctor or the study staff to explain any information in this consent 
document that is not clear to you. You may take home an unsigned copy of this consent form 
to think about or discuss with family or friends before making your decision.
Your participation  is voluntary. You may decide to not participate in this study. If you do 
participate, you may withdraw from the study at any time. Your decision not to take part or to 
withdraw will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. 
AN OVERVIEW  OF THE STUDY AND KEY INFORMATION
The purpose of  this research study is to test the safety, tolerability, and the effect of vibration 
(delivered by [CONTACT_746024]) on parkinsonian tremor. The RMBand was 
developed by [CONTACT_746025], LLC (RF). This RMBand was designed to administer a vibration 
to the wearer to decrease or stop tremor in persons with Parkinson's disease (PD) while 
wearing the device. We hypothesize that the RMBand will be safe, comfortable to wear, easy to 
apply, will decrease your tremor, and that the effects of vibration on tremor will be obvious and 
related to the dose of vibration. You are being asked to participate in this study because you 
have been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease with a tremor and may meet the study entry 
requirements.
People with Parkinson’s  disease often experience tremor that can interfere with the person’s 
ability to conduct daily activities. Drug treatments can help but over time, some people 
experience an increasingly shorter period of symptom relief. Researchers have found that 
vibration therapy can help improve tremor symptoms. This study will test the RMBand, a light-
weight, portable device that delivers vibration to the arm. The localized vibration therapy has 
the potential to decrease tremors.  The RMBand is an investigational device which means it has 
not been approved by [CONTACT_941] U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

During the  visit you will:
1. visit  a single time for the study 
2. have  the vibration device (RMBand) placed on the bicep of the arm that is most affected 
by [CONTACT_742211] 
3. have  a device placed on each wrist to measure the amount of tremor you are 
experiencing in each arm
4. be  randomized to receive either a low dose frequency (80Hz) or higher dose frequency 
(160Hz) of vibration therapy. Note: Randomization means that you are put into a group 
by [CONTACT_3364]. A computer program will place you in one of the study groups. Neither you 
nor your study doctor can choose the group you will be in. You will have an equal 
chance of being placed in either group. 
5. complete a  brief survey
6. have  a brief neurological exam performed before, during, and after vibration therapy 
has been applied
7. be  videotaped to record your tremors before, during and after vibration therapy
8. answer  questions about your medical history 
9. answer  questions about the vibration therapy.
Your participation  in this study will last up to 2 hours.  Approximately 38 people will participate 
in this study.
If you  decide not to enter this study, you can receive the usual care that you would receive even 
if you were not in the study. This includes the medications used to treat your  Parkinson’s 
tremor such as levodopa (dopamine replacement), dopamine agonists (class of drugs that 
activate your brain to produce dopamine), and anticholinergics (class of drug used to treat 
tremor).  The study doctor will discuss these options with you. You do not have to participate in 
this study to be treated for tremors related to Parkinson’s disease. 
In general,  we will not give you any individual results from the study. If we find something of 
medical importance to you, we will inform you, although we expect that this will be a very rare 
occurrence. 
Please read,  or have someone read to you, the rest of this document. If there is anything you 
don’t understand, be sure to ask the study staff.

Page 3  of 7WHAT ARE  THE BENEFITS FROM BEING IN THE STUDY?
There is  some evidence that vibration therapy is effective in reducing tremors. However, it is 
unlikely that it will work with everyone, and we cannot promise that it will help you. This study 
may help the study team learn things that may help other people in the future. 
WHAT RISKS  AND DISCOMFORTS COULD I EXPERIENCE FROM BEING IN THE STUDY?
Your condition  may not get better or may become worse while you are in this study.
Possible Risks  and Discomforts
Rare (Less  than a 1% chance that this will happen)
If  you have a deep brain stimulator, there is a chance that the RMBand may turn it 
off. As a result, you may feel a brief increase in your Parkinson’s symptoms. If that 
occurs the study doctor will be there to return it to normal working status for you. 
Occasional (Between 1-10%  chance that this will happen)
You  may feel some discomfort such as a tingling sensation from the vibration and/or 
discomfort from the straps that the device is attached. We will adjust the device to 
your comfort level.
Completing  the surveys and assessments may be somewhat tiring for you. You can 
take breaks at any time.
Non-Physical Risks
Participation in  research might involve some loss of privacy. There is a small risk that someone 
outside the research study could see and misuse information about you.
Unknown or  Unforeseeable Risks
The researchers  will let you know about any significant new findings (such as additional risks or 
discomforts) that might make you change your mind about participating in the study.
The RMBand involves risks that  are currently unknown or unforeseeable. 
WHAT ARE  THE COSTS?
The vibration  device will be provided by [CONTACT_746026]. You will not be charged 
for any study visits, tests, or procedures. 
WILL I  BE PAID TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY?
You will  not be paid for your participation in this study. 
Please be aware  that the investigative team and the University may receive money for the 
conduct of this study.

Page 4  of 7WHAT HAPPENS  IF I AM INJURED OR BECOME SICK BECAUSE I TOOK PART IN THE 
STUDY?
If you  are injured by, or become ill, from participating in this study, please contact [CONTACT_559170]. Medical treatment is available at the Virginia Commonwealth University 
Health System (VCU Health System). Your study doctor will arrange for short-term emergency

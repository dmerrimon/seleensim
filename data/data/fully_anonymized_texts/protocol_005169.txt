2 LAY SUMMARY  
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the US, however African American 
residents of rural areas in the south and southeast regions have the highest prevalence of CVD of 
any group. African  Americans carry a significant burden of CVD risk factors that often co -occur; 
this burden is amplified in rural communities. CVD disparities at the intersection of race and 
geography are driven by [CONTACT_650354] a s limited 
access to quality healthcare, socio -economic inequities, limited healthcare infrastructure and 
environmental barriers to behavior change. Interventions to ameliorate CVD burden in rural 
African American communities will require placing the indivi dual in the context of the larger 
community and taking advantage of new technologies to support behavior change. However, how 
best to integrate mobile technology into existing evidenced based interventions (EBIs) is still an 
emerging field and social and p hysical environmental factors important in rural communities are 
rarely considered in existing EBIs. The proposed study will address this gap in the literature by 
[CONTACT_650355]. The proposed study is built on the 
strong foundation of Project GRACE’s 8 -year history of designing and te sting interventions using 
a community -based participatory research (CBPR) approach, and individual and collaborative 
expertise in community -based CVD outreach, service and research. We have developed a 
phased CBPR study with a long -term goal to reduce rate s of CVD in Eastern NC. The overall 
objective of this proposal is to assess feasibility of implementing an EBI, adapted to the needs 
and interests of a rural community in order to plan a large scale study. To that end our specific 
aims are to 1) expand and  sustain a Project GRACE CVD coalition of community and academic 
stakeholders to develop successful CVD risk prevention strategies in rural communities; 2) 
conduct a mixed -method community needs and assets assessment based on: a) assemble, 
review and asses s existing sources of CVD data; b) identification of community strengths and 
resources using a web -based survey of community, faith based, social service and healthcare 
organizations; c) determine the acceptability of components of CVD risk reduction EBIs and 
community members’ perceptions of possible targets for intervention using focus group 
interviews; d) determine specific family influences (barriers and facilitators) on acceptability of EBI 
acceptability; 3) adapt PREMIER, a multi -component EBI using i ntervention mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]; and 4) 
conduct a small -scale randomized control trial to assess a) efficacy; and, b) feasibility and 
adaption of implementing adapted PREMIER in rural settings.

5 BACKGROUND AND RA TIONALE  
Purpose:  To determine the effect of an adapted intervention, Heart Matters, on cardiovascular 
clinical outcomes.  
Background:  African Americans in the rural southeast are disproportionately affected by 
[CONTACT_650356]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_45373] -based cardiovascular 
interventions targeting clinical or behavioral risk factors, geographic and racial dispar ities persist 
and continue to widen.  Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United 
States (US) with an estimated 50%  of individuals in the US expected to have CVD by 2030. 
African American residents in rural areas of the south an d southeast (also called the “stroke belt”) 
have the highest prevalence of CVD compared to other populations. Furthermore, CVD 
prevalence rates for residents of rural areas (13.1%) are higher compared to those in urban areas 
(11.2%) of the US. In the setti ng of geographic disparities, striking racial disparities in CVD risk 
factors, morbidity and mortality are exacerbated. African Americans are disproportionately 
affected by a higher burden of CVD risk factors: high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, high 
cholesterol, and physical inactivity. This heightened risk is prevalent in both youth and older age 
groups and has increased over time. While CVD disparities at the intersection of race and 
geography are driven by a disproportionate burden of individual ris k factors, racial disparities in 
rural settings are amplified by [CONTACT_650357], such as limited access to quality healthcare 
services, socio -economic burden, dwindling resources, insufficient health infrastructure, and 
physical barriers to access to c are. There are numerous evidence based interventions (EBIs) that 
have focused on reduction in CVD risk factors. These interventions have often focused on primary 
prevention of individual risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], physical activit y, and 
diet quality. Many of these have been developed in urban centers, and only a few have included 
participants that are reflective of geographic and racial disparities in CVD risk.  
 
Given the burden of co -morbidities in rural African American populatio ns, interventions targeting 
only one behavior or risk factor are likely to be less successful than those using intervention 
components and concepts impacting multiple behaviors. There is a need for culturally adapted 
interventions that address multiple beh avioral risk factors for CVD. Using a Community -Based 
Participatory Research (CBPR) approach, our team adapted and will implement an EBI to 
improve cardiovascular risk in African Americans living in a rural underserved setting.  
 
Participants:  African Ameri cans who reside in Edgecombe and Nash  counties, aged [ADDRESS_871969] one self -reported cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor.   
Potential benefits for study participants include participation in long -term lifestyle modifications 
that may result in improved diet, nutrition, and physical activity patterns , which in turn should 
decrease blood pressure and lead to an overall reduction in cardiovascular and cancer morbidity.  
 
Heart Matters Intervention:  Heart Matters will use a  lifestyle modification to reduce CVD risk 
factors and includes 26 interactive group sessions and  7 individual visit sessions over 12 months . 
Heart Matters lifestyle goals include: 1) reducing weight by 15 lbs. or another agreed upon goal, 
2) limiti ng fat intake by [CONTACT_144059] 20 –50% or less of total calories from fat, 3) limiting daily 
sodium intake to 2300 mg or less, 4) accumulating 150 min of moderate -intensity exercise each 
week, 5) limiting alcohol intake; women are advised to consume no more tha n one alcoholic drink 
per day and men are advised to consume no more than two alcoholic drinks per day, and 6) diet 
and physical activity tracking.  
 
Trained facilitators and co -facilitators will conduct 26 90 -minute group sessions at each 
organizational site with 15 –[ADDRESS_871970] seven 60 -min individual sessions throughout the intervention. Individual 
sessions will be pre -scheduled and conducted via phone by [CONTACT_287890]. Using motivational 
interviewing techniques, facilitators will discuss participant’s p rogress and challenges to making 
behavior changes. Participants develop an individualized action plan at the first individual visit and 
this plan is revisited in subsequent individual visit sessions in an effort to track individual progress.  
6 OBJECTIVES AND  OUTCOME MEASURES  
Objectives  Outcome Measures  Timepoint(s) of 
evaluation of 
this outcome 
measure (if 
applicable)  
Primary Objective  
To determine the effect of an 
adapted intervention, Heart 
Matters, on body weight . 
 
 Body weight measured by [CONTACT_650358] -
[ADDRESS_871971] art times: Time 1 Heart Matters Intervention Group (immediately after 
baseline data collection) and Time 2 6 month -delay Heart Matters Intervention Group  (6 months  
after baseline data collection) . Randomization by [CONTACT_650359].  
 
The flow of the participant is: 1. Screening at community organization and pre -intervention data 
collection. 2. Randomization of organizations to treatment group or [ADDRESS_871972] ion procedures : After the consent process, eligible individuals will complete the 
baseline data collection in a community setting. All data collection will be  completed by [CONTACT_650360], James McFarlin Comm unity 
Development, Inc  and Project Momentum, Inc . Data collection will include biometric and 
biomarker data as well as self -report behavioral data. Trained research staff will collect biometrics 
such as weight, height, grip strength, and balance. Trained research staff who are registered 
nurses will collect blood pressure  and hemoglobin A1c. Study staff will record the biometric data 
on paper forms which will be entered into REDCap, a secure web -based application for data 
management. For participan ts with life -threatening A1c levels, they will be immediately 
transported to emergency services, and adverse event data will be documented by [CONTACT_3647]. 
The baseline questionnaire will include behavioral measures and structured questions on 
demographi cs (e.g. age, race, marital status, SES), health history, medications, CVD risk factors. 
Data collectors will enter data from the paper questionnaire forms into REDCap.  
 
[ADDRESS_871973] one risk f actor for cardiovascular disease , living in one of two 
rural counties in eastern North Carolina , aged 21 years and older.  
8.2 Inclusion Criteria  
• Participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the trial.  
• African American adults  aged 21  years or above.  
• Self-reported with at least one cardiovascular disease risk factor  of pre-diabetes or 
diabetes, hypertension, obesity, family history of early CVD, or prior diagnosis of CVD  
8.3 Exclusion Criteria  
The participant may not enter th e trial if ANY of the following apply:  
• Individuals who had significant cognitive impairment or unstable cardiovascular 
disease   
• Cognitive impairment that limits informed consent  
9 TRIAL PROCEDURES  
 
9.1 Recruitment  
 
9.1.1 Organizational Recruitment  
We will recruit  organizations to serve as recruitment and intervention sites from both 
counties (Edgecombe and Nash). We will invite  potential organizations based on: (a)  
existing relationships through the Project GRACE consortium, (b) and a list of 
organizations beyond existing networks generated by [CONTACT_650361], Inc and Project Momentum, Inc  collaborators. Knowing that CVD risk is 
high in older adult populations, the extended list will include  senior health and civic 
organizations. His torically, faith based organizations reach a large segment of the 
minority community and are a trusted leader in the community. As a result, many 
organizations may be  faith-based.  
In addition to partnering for participant recruitment, organizations will be host sites for  
intervention delivery . We will use  the following inclusion criteria to evaluate each 
organization: kitchen space with refrigerator, stove and/or microwave, contact [CONTACT_650362], and layout of how the 
used space should look at the conclusion of use. We will base  final inclusion criteria on 
if the site could host the intervention for all [ADDRESS_871974] outreach and information sessions at 
each organization, distributing written materials/flyers, recruiting at organizational 
events an d exploring the social networks of initial recruits.  
 
 
9.2 Screening and Eligibility Assessment  
We will obtain verbal informed consent from potentially eligible participants for the initial 
screening during which individuals will provide identifiable informati on (e.g. contact 
[CONTACT_3031])  and provide medical history to determine if eligible or excluded. No re -
screening or protocol waivers will be  permitted.  Medical history interview will ask  about 
cardiovascular disease risk factors ( pre-diabetes or diabetes, hypertension, obesity, 
family history of early CVD, or prior diagnosis of CVD) and cognitive impairment.  
9.[ADDRESS_871975] Momentum, Inc  will be responsible for enrolling 
participants into the study.  
9.4 Randomiz ation  
Participants in organizations will be  randomized by a statistician into Time  1 (immediate 
intervention delivery  after baseline data collection ) and Time  2 (6 month delayed 
intervention delivery) under a matched pair in order to balance the sample size betw een 
Arm [ADDRESS_871976] the structured survey . The baseline questionna ire will 
include behavioral measures and structured questions on demographics  (e.g. age, race, 
marital status, SES), health history, medications, CVD risk factors. Data collectors will 
enter data from the paper questionnaire forms into REDCap.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_871977] material immediately after collection, 
reading, and recording is complete.  
9.9 Early Discontinuation/Withdrawal of Participants  
During the course of the trial a  participant may choose to withdraw early from t he trial  at 
any time. This may happen for a number of reasons, including  but not limited to :   
• The occurrence of what the participant perceives as an intolerable adverse event .   
• Inability to comply with trial procedures  
• Participant decision due to circumstances outside of trial.  
 
Participants  may have th e following  two options for withdrawal;  
 
1) Participants can withdraw from the study but permit data and samples obtained up until  
the point of withdrawal to be retained for use in the study analysis.  No further data or 
samples would be collected after withdrawal.  
 
2) Participants can withdraw completely  from the study and withdraw the data and 
samples collected up until the point of withdrawal. The data and samples already 
collected would not be used in the final study analysis . (Any limits to this type of 
withdrawal where, for example analysis  of their data or samples  has already been 
integrated into interim results  or dose escalation decisions  etc. should be explained in 
the participant information sheet).   
 
In addition, the Investigator may discontinue a participant from the trial treatment at any 
time if the Investi gator considers it necessary for any reason including , but not limited to : 
• Ineligibility (either arising during the trial or retrospectively having been overlooked at 
screening)  
• An adverse event which requires discontinuation of the trial or results in ina bility to 
continue to comply with trial procedures  
9.[ADDRESS_871978] annually, or as requested.  All 
unanticipated problems or serious adverse events involving risk to human subjects will be 
reported.  All collaborators, students, and employees assistin g in this research study will be  
informed about these obligations.    
 
10.1 Adverse Event Definitions  
Adverse Event (AE)  Any untoward medical occurrence in a participant to whom  a 
medicinal product  has been administered, including occurrences 
which are not necessarily caused by [CONTACT_587828].  
Serious Adverse Event 
(SAE)  A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence 
that: 
• results in death  
• is life -threatening  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_650343]  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• consists of  a congenital anomaly or birth defect *. 
Other ‘important medical events ’ may also be considered a 
serious  adverse event when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgement, the event may  jeopardise the participant and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the  
outcomes listed  above.  
 
10.2  Adverse Events  
In the event of an adverse event, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_650344] a  protocol for handling AE that may occur during the course of data collection 
and the intervention. Facilitators and data collectors will be trained to follow protoco l 
procedures and report any AE to the primary investigator immediately.  
11 STATISTICS  
 
11.1  Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP)  
The plan for the statistical analysis of the trial are outlined below. There is not a separate 
SAP document in use for the trial . 
11.[ADDRESS_871979] square means differences will be  used 
by [CONTACT_650363] 6 -month outcomes, as well as differences 
in groups with corresponding 95% confidence intervals.  Models will be  adjusted for age, 
blood pressure medications, and cluster.  All of the analysis w ill be implemented using SAS 
9.4 (Cary, NC).  
 
11.3 Sample Size Determi nation  
Sample size for Heart Matters was calculated on the basis of observing a 1.8 kg difference 
(SD = 3.2) in the primary outcome – weight change – between two intervention groups 
from baseline to [ADDRESS_871980] a 1.8 
kg difference (SD = 3.2) in weight change between intervention and control groups, with 
80% power and an α of 0.05.  Accounting for attrition and intra -class correlation, due to a 
clustered randomized delayed intervention design, we plan to enroll 120 participants . 
11.4  Analysis P opulation s  
We will implement Heart Matters in Edgecombe and Nash counties; two counties in 
eastern North Carolina that are considered rural by [CONTACT_650364] 54,[ADDRESS_871981] had a large prevalence of African  Americans (56.7 and 
40% of population, respectively) that experience significant health disparities with respect 
to cardiovascular disease.  The sample is recruited through community organizations and 
thus not considered a randomly selected sample representative of populations.  
11.[ADDRESS_871982] 60% of the 
items  of a given measure .  If an individual answered less than 60% of items, the  data will 
be treated as missing for that measure only.  
11.7  Procedures for Reporting any Deviation(s) from the Original Statistical Plan  
Any deviations from the original statistical analysis plan will be reported in publications.  
[ADDRESS_871983] copy files will be stored at UNC. The participants will be identified by a unique trial 
specific number and/or code in any database.  The name [CONTACT_650368]. Informed consent documents and a 
document linking file that links participant ID to  their name [CONTACT_650369].  
[ADDRESS_871984] will discuss an d make recommendations to 
support completion of scientific aims. As this will be a minimal risk study, this oversight is 
sufficient.  
14 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
A trial related deviation is a departure from the ethically approved trial protocol or other trial 
document or process (e.g. consent process) or any applicable regulatory requirements. Any 
deviations from the protocol will be documented in a protocol deviation form and filed in the trial 
master file.  The protocol deviation s and completed forms will be pre sented to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_650345]. The review will ensure any repetitive or 
single, but significant deviations be escalated to the IRB for assessment of whether a non -
compliance /deviation may be a potential Serious Breach  and determine any necessary response.  
15 ETHICAL AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
 
15.1  Participant Confi dentiality  
To track participant outcomes across time while maintaining confidentiality,  ID numbers 
will be used. A separate linking file will be  maintained linking the IDs to the respondents' 
names. The surveys will be conducted using the mobile REDCap dat abase, a password 
protected, firewalled database only accessible to the research team. Data will be collected 
using RedCap app. In case of computer problems, we will have paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_650346]. All paper documentation will be maintained in lock ed files at UNC . 
15.2  Expenses and Benefits  
Participants will receive $195 in compensation  for participation in data collection and 
intervention session attendance : $5 eligibility screening, $25 for baseline data collection, 
$15 for 6 month data collection, $20 for 12 month data collection, and $20 for 18 month 
data collection. Throughout the intervention, participants will receive a $15 cash incentive 
for attendance  at Group Sessions 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and $20 at session 26.  
16 PUBLICATION POLICY  
The study PI [INVESTIGATOR_650347]. Study PI [INVESTIGATOR_650348]. Institutional and funder policies should be adhered to. NHLBI should be 
acknowledged in all publications.  
17 ARCHIVIN G 
6 months after the main study outcomes paper is published, de -identified dataset will be available 
per institutional and federal guidelines. Data will be destroyed five years after the study 
publications are complete . For electronic data, we will follow accepted techniques to permanently 
delete files. This will include destruction of linkage files, transcriptions, data files, web -based 
database files, digital interviews and all other electronic files. All paper files will be shredded at 
that time.

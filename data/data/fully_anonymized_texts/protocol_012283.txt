Background and 
Significance  
/Preliminary 
Studies  Hemostatic, biomarker, and inflammatory changes are common in severe 
manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) (1-3). Such 
factors, as well as the bedridden status and critical illness may constitute 
a prothrombotic milieu, predisposing to venous and arterial thrombosis. 
However, the optimal antithrombotic regimen for patients with COVID -19, 
especially those with severe disease, remains uncertain and is currently 
an area of activ e clinical interest  (4-6). Prophylactic -dose anticoagulation 
is generally recommended for acutely ill hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643]. However, 
given the hemostatic abnormalities of severe COVID -19 illness, it is 
unknown whether more intensive anticoagulation is preferred to reduce 
the risk of thrombotic events, potentially mitigating microvascular and 
macrovascular thrombi  and even disseminated intravascular coagulation 
(DIC). Further, the risks of therapeutic dose anticoagulation must be 
weighed against the bleeding risks inherent to this a pproach. To address 
this critical gap in knowledge in an area of clinical equipoise, we plan to 
conduct a cluster -randomized trial in patients admitted to a large volume 
academic medical center  to select the best anticoagulation intervention . [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

Version date: 2/20/[ADDRESS_154539] of intermediate -dose anticoagulation compared with 
prophylactic anticoagulation of critically ill patients with COVID -19 with 
regards to the composite primary endpoint of being alive and without 
clinically -relevant venous or arterial  thrombotic events at discharge from 
the ICU (without transfer to palliative care unit/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125]) or at ICU duration  
(if ICU stay lasted 30 days or longer ). 
 
Clinically relevant venous or arterial thrombotic events will all be 
adjudicated and are defined as any of the following:  
• Confirmed or treated d eep venous thrombosis  or pulmonary 
embolism  
• Type I myocardial infarction (MI) as confirmed by a combination of  
biomarkers, electrocardiogram a nd angiogram  
• New i schemic stroke  
• Acute limb ischemia  
• Actionable  line thrombosis requiring escalation of  anticoagulation  
or removal or replacement of the line  
• CVVH Filter thrombosis requiring escalation of anticoagulation  
• Other thrombotic events requiring anticoagulation (e.g., 
intracardiac thrombosis )  
Secondary Aims:  1. To determine the impact of intermediate -dose anticoagulation 
compared with prophylactic anticoagulation on the individual 
components of the primary outcome  in the ICU.  
2. To determine the impact of intermediate -dose anticoagulation 
compared with prophylactic anticoagulation on ICU length of stay.  
3. To determine the impact of intermediate -dose anticoagulation 
compared with prophylactic anticoagulation on ra tes of acute kidney 
injury and renal recovery  in the ICU.  
4. To determine the safety of intermediate -dose anticoagulation 
compared with prophylactic anticoagulation with respect to major 
bleeding (assessed by [CONTACT_136050], also explored by [CONTACT_136051]) in the ICU.  
5. To determine the impact of intermediate -dose anticoagulation 
compared with prophylactic anticoagulation on the individual 
components of the primary outcome until hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]  
6. To determine the impact of intermediate -dose anticoagulat ion 
compared with prophylactic anticoagulation on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577].  
 
Design  To avoid bias in statistical inference due to bias in sampling, only the first 
[ADDRESS_154540] the statistical inference can also be 
found in the supplemental appe ndix. We will use the data from these 60 
patients to generate the proportions of patients with the events specified 
as primary and secondary outcomes. We will also report the descriptive 
statistics (mean, median, interquartile range) for the time to ICU 
discharge. Graphical display of the data will be done as well. To compare 
the intervention effect between the two study groups on the primary and 
secondary outcomes, we will use generalized linear model with identity 
link function for continuous variables an d logit link function for

Version date: 2/20/20  dichotomous variables following the intent -to-treat principle. Covariates in 
these models include intervention group indicator, ICU indicators, and the 
potential confounding factors. The pre -spectified potential confounders 
are ag e, sex, weight, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), 
concomitant treatment with an IL -[ADDRESS_154541] of 
intermediate -dose anticoagulation compared with that of prophylactic 
anticoagulation. To report the trial findings, we will present the mean 
difference and odds ratio when appropriate and their corresponding p -
values  and 95% confidence intervals. Several pre -specified sensitivity 
analyses will be conducted: (1) excluding the patients who undergo 
CRRT during the study period; (2) excluding patients who experienced 
deviation in anticoagulation from randomized treatment arm; (3) 
analyzing the patients as the treatment they actually received. Additional 
sensitivity analysis will also be conducted to include covariates found 
imbalanced between the two intervention groups.

Screening 
procedures  All patients in participating CUIMC  ICUs will be screened by [CONTACT_3476] . 
Study eligibility criteria (described above) will be implemented to identify the 
modified intention -to-treat cohort.  
Randomization 
procedures  Patients, when eligible, will be enrolled to the study at the “first -come -first-
serve” basis. All the participating ICUs can have 2 possible “room type”: 
negative pre ssure rooms and non -negative pressure rooms. Each of the 
participating ICUs will be divided into either two or four clusters as follows. 
Any ICU with only one room type (i.e., it only has negative pressure rooms 
or only has non -negative pressure rooms) wil l be divided into 2 clusters. For 
ICUs that contain both room types (i.e., it has negative pressure rooms and 
non-negative pressure rooms), we will divide that ICU into [ADDRESS_154546] been observed. As the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_136038] (e.g., some negative 
Version #: 3  Page 7 
Version date: 2/20/20  pressure rooms were changed to non -negative pressure rooms), we 
currently recruitment included more patients in the prophylactic dose group 
than those of the intermediate dose group.  At the recommendation of the 
DSMB,  in each ICU and each room type, we will randomize “intermediate 
dose rooms” and “prophylactic dose roo ms” in a 3:1 ratio until we reach 
enrollment of 30 patients for one group and we will then only assign patients 
to the other group until we achieve the recruitment of 30 patients that group 
as well. After we recruit 30 patients for each arm, the ratio of t he rooms will 
be changed back to 1:1 (intermediate vs. prophylactic) for the subsequent 
recruitment.  
 
Study 
intervention  • Each cluster will be randomized to one of the two antithrombotic 
regimens: prophylactic -dose  or intermediate dose  as described above  
The choice of agents will be dependent upon the renal function (at the 
time of enrollment and every subsequent day).  
• At the onset of study enrollment, clusters including patients admitted 
within the past 5 days will be randomized.  
• Patie nts who meet eligibility by [CONTACT_136055]. Patient is 
considered en rolled after a co -investigator has confirmed all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria have been met.  Assessment of 
appropriateness of anticoagulation dose will occur daily based on the 
renal function , progressive thrombocytopenia or anemia, or development 
of another indication for  anticoagulation such as new-onset atrial 
fibrillation,  
• Patients’ treatment course will be followed from randomization to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_136039] 30  days, whichever happen s earlier.  
• Patients will continue with randomization therapy until discharged from 
the ICU, except in the setting of an adverse event attributed to 
anticoagulation , developi[INVESTIGATOR_136040], or change in code status to comfort measures . 
• Patients transferred between participating ICUs will remain in the 
treatment arm assigned at initial randomization.  Recommendation will be 
to continue study treatment if patient transferred to ICUs  not participating 
in the present trial . If the study treatment is changed  by [CONTACT_136056] , then patient will be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_136057] t principle .

III. Endpoint  Definition  
 
a) Endpoint  Reporting Requirements  
Safety surveillance and reporting starts as soon as the patient is enrolled  in the clinical 
investigation  and will continue until the subject is deceased, the subject concludes participation in 
the clinical investigation or the subject withdraws from the clinical investigation.  
Endpoint  data will be collected throughout the time period defined above and will be entered  on 
a CRF.  
 
For the purposes of this investigation the following are reportable endpoints : 
Death   
Deep venous thrombosis  
 
 Diagnosed on duplex ultrasonography including 
upper (internal jugular, subclavian, 
axillary/brachial) and lower extremity (iliac, 
femoral/popliteal, gastrocnemius, peroneal, 
posterior tibial) thrombosis  
 
Pulmonary emboli sm  
 Diagnosed on CT angiography, V/Q scan, or 
invasive pulmonary angiography  
 
Type I myocardial infarction  
 
 Detection of a rise and/or fall of cTn  values with 
at least one value above the 99th percentile URL 
and at least one of the following:: symptoms of 
ischemia, new or presumed new significant ST -
segment –T wave (ST –T) changes or new left 
bundle branch block (LBBB); development of o 50-120 kg: Unfractionated heparin 5000 units SC q8h  
o > 120 kg: Unfractionated heparin 7500 units SC q8h

Study 
assessment and 
activities  All anticoagulation medications are standard of care  according to 
discussions between clinician  leadership  in multiple disc iplines and review of 
treatment p rotocols from institutions in the region and internationally. 
Anticoagulants  will be ordered through the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4601].  
 
Patient receiving any anticoagulation are at risk for development of 
hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, and in rare cases ( overall rate of 0.2%) 
heparin induced thrombocytopeni a (7). Patients who have a bleeding event 
may have cessation of the administered drug  per clinical standard of care , 
and in some cases may require transfusion of blood products, and additional 
testing and therapy to identify and treat the source of bleeding. Patients who 
develop a thrombotic event may have intensification of anticoagulation per 
clinical s tandard of care . 
We will collect all clinical, laboratory and imaging data generated per 
standard of care throughout the patient’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].   Primary and 
Secondary endpoints will be assessed at ICU discharge, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_136041] 30 days if the patient is still hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].

IV. Event Adjudication  
A clinical events committee will be formed for adjudication of clinical endpoints. S uspected 
components of the primary endpoint as well as the secondary  endpoints, including the  bleeding 
endpoint  as documented in case report forms will be adjudicated  based on pre-defined clinical 
definitions of venous thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, acute limb ischemia, 
clinically -actionable line thrombosis, and major bleeding. All suspected e vents will be independently 
reviewed by [CONTACT_136059] . If there is disagreement on 
whether an endpoint event has occurred, the case will be reviewed by [CONTACT_136060].  
 
V. Safety Monit oring Plan  
All events outlined above  will be reported to the Clincial Events Committee (CEC) and Data and 
Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and reviewed on a regular basis. The DSMB may request 
additional information as needed. Based on safety data, the DSMB may recommend to the Study 
Chairman to  stop or otherwise modify the study. The Study Chairman  will make the final decision 
after weighing the recommendation of the DSMB whether the study should then be stopped, 
modified or continued without change. The DSMB procedures will be described in the DSMB 
Charter.

Version date: 2/20/20  VIII. Study Design and Analysis Plan (include timing and primary and secondary 
endpoint analysis)  
 
In order to assess event rates and appropriately adjust study measures as part of adaptive trial 
design, a blinded interim analysis at the combined event rate of both study arms will be performed. 
Once the trial is completed, analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_118067].  
 
General Design  
This is a cluster randomized -controlled clinical selection trial of interventions for anticoagulation for 
COVID -19 patients in the ICU. ICU subunits will be randomly assigned to give patients intermediate  
(higher)  dose or prophylactic (lower) dose of anticoagulation. The primary goal of the trial is to 
select the best intervention  with a high probability of correct  selection if one intervention is truly 
superior by a pre -specified effect size.  Up to 1 00 patients (with e xpected sample sizes between [ADDRESS_154548] likely scenarios) will be enrolled in the study, using a novel sequential 
design.  Each time an outcome is observed for a patient, those outcomes are added to a running 
tally of successes for each intervention.  There is a pre -specified criterion in terms of the success 
tallies for selecting arm as evidence of apparent superiority accumulates. With this sequential 
procedure, the preferred intervention can be selected during the ongoing enrollment as soon as the 
pre-specified selection criteria are met, and further enrollment will cease.  To ensure that there will 
be some unbiased estimates of the proportion of patients with a good outcome available for each 
intervention arm, the selection crit eria will  not be applied until [ADDRESS_154549] been observed.  This 
novel approach based on the Levin -Robbins -Leu family of sequential selection procedures [18 -23]. 
 
Study Implementation  
The identification of a preferred treatment will be done using an innovative s equential selection 
procedure, which will substantially reduce the number of patients in comparison to a hypothesis test 
procedure.  The data will be examined each time a pair of patients complet es follow -up after [ADDRESS_154550] selection with high probability.  The procedure follows 
the preference zone / indifference zone approach, wherein we require the selection procedure to 
guarantee a probability of at least 90% correct  selection (of the t ruly best intervention), assuming 
that one is truly superior to the other by a pre -specified amount.  This pre -specification defines a 
region in the parameter space called the preference zone . If the best intervention does not exceed 
the next best by [CONTACT_39548] e-specified amount, the success probabilities are said to lie in the 
indifference zone , where we shall be indifferent to the fact that the probability of correct selection 
may be less than 90%.  For this trial, the preference zone consists of all parameter vectors ( p1, p2) of 
success probabilities where the odds ratio comparing the largest to the next largest is greater than 
or equal to 2.15 ( p1=0.35, p2=0.20).  
 
The selection procedure is specified by [CONTACT_136061], the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877], and the terminal 
decision rule, as follows.  
 
Sampling rule : Patients, when eligible, will be enrolled to the study at the “first -come -first-serve” 
basis. All the participating ICUs can have 2 possible “room type”: negative pressure rooms and non -
negative pressure rooms.  Each of the p articipati ng ICUs will be divided into either two or four 
clusters as follows. Any ICU with only one room type (i.e., it only has negative pressure rooms or 
only has non -negative pressure rooms) will be divided into 2 clusters. For ICUs  that contain both 
room types (i.e., it has negative pressure rooms and non -negative pressure rooms), we will divide 
that ICU into 4 clusters with two clusters for each room type.  Two c lusters within each ICU and 
each room type will then be randomized to either of the study arms . . Enrolled patients will receive 
Version #: 3  Page 13 
Version date: 2/20/[ADDRESS_154551] been observed. As the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_136042] (e.g., some negative pressure rooms were changed 
to non -negative pressure rooms), we currently recruitment included more pat ients in the 
prophylactic dose group than those of the intermediate dose group.  Pending the approval of 
DSMB, in each ICU and each room type, we will randomize “ intermediate dose  rooms” and  
“prophylactic dose rooms” in a 3:1 ratio until we reach enrollmen t of 30 patients for one group and 
we will then only assign patients to the other  group until we achieve the recruitment of 30 patients 
that group as well. After we recruit 30 patients for each arm, the ratio of the rooms will be changed 
back to 1:1 ( intermediate vs. prophylactic) for the subsequent recruitment.  
 
Success tallies : 
Each time the follow -up for each patient in a pair is complete and a “good” or “poor” outcome is 
determined for each based on the composite primary outcome, the pair becomes “obser ved” and is 
available for sequential monitoring by [CONTACT_124436] a running tally of the “good” outcomes for each 
intervention.  These success tallies  are used for the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877].  
 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_136043] : The criterion for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_8169] a difference of 4 or more between the 
tallies if this occurs at or before 6 0 patients’ outcomes have been observed.  At that time, 
intervention with the largest success tally is selected as the preferred intervention.  However,  we will 
not stop the procedure and make a decision before the outcomes of the first [ADDRESS_154552] the intervention according to  
other considerations (safety, better secondary outcomes, etc.).  
 
Incomplete pairs:  
If at the time of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_136044], we will allow each patient in each such pair to 
complete their follow -up even if the arm to which they were randomized is eliminated.   
 
Operating characteristics : In Appendix, we calculate  the operating characteristics for various

Analysis of the Primary Endpoint  with the Full Sample  
In general, a selection procedure, unlike a hypothesis test procedure, is not specifically designed to 
provide a p-value below a conventional level of significance.  Indeed, we will not be declaring any 
differences statistically significant, as that is expl icitly not the goal of the present selection trial, i.e., 
we are explicitly not interested  in testing the null hypothesis of no differences between the 
interventions.  Instead, because the adaptive sequential selection procedure can be described as a 
proced ure that samples until there is a pre -specified weight of evidence  for making correct 
selections, assuming there is a minimum true degree of superiority as measured by [CONTACT_136062] #: 3  Page 14 
Version date: 2/20/20  ratio, we will quote the likelihood ratio (LR) measure of weight of evid ence  in various ways . Details 
regarding how the LR was calculated and examples to illustrate their interpretations can be found in 
the supplemental appendix.    
 
Endpoint Evaluation  
All patients will be evaluable for ischemic outcomes and bleeding from the time of their first 
treatment with the anticoagulant.   
 
Analysis of Primary Endpoint and Sec ondary Endpoints for the first [ADDRESS_154553] the statistical 
inference can also be found in the supplemental appe ndix. We will use the data from these 60 
patients to generate the p roportions of patien ts with the events specified as primary and secondary 
outcomes. W e will also report the descriptive statistics (mean, median, interquartile range) for the 
time to ICU di scharge. Graphica l display of the data will be done  as well. To compare the 
intervention effect between the two study groups  on the primary and secondary outcomes , we will 
use generalized linear model with identity link function for continuous variables an d logit link 
function for dichotomous variables  following the intent -to-treat principle . Covariates in these models 
include intervention group indicator, ICU indicators, and the potential confounding factors. The pre -
spectified potential confounders are  age, sex, weight , estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), 
concomitant treatment with an IL -[ADDRESS_154554] of intermediate -dose anticoagulation compared with that of prophylactic 
anticoagulation. To report the trial findings,  we will present the mean difference and odds ratio when 
appropriate and their corresponding p -values and 95% confidence intervals. Several  pre-specified 
sensitivity analyses will be conducted: (1) e xcluding the patients who undergo CRRT during the 
study p eriod ; (2) excluding patients who experienced deviation in anticoagulation from randomized 
treatment arm;  (3) analyzing the patients as the treatment they actually received. Additional 
sensitivity analysis will also be conducted to include  covariate s found  imbalanced between the two 
intervention groups.  
 
Operating characteristics of the Study Design  
The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_136045] a lead of at least [ADDRESS_154555] 90% for any true success probabilities 
lying in the preference zone characterized by [CONTACT_136063] 2.15 or greater between the true 
success probabilities of the two interventions.  For example, true success probabilities of 0.35 and 
0.20 with an od ds ratio of 2.15 is lying on the boundary between the preference and indifference 
zones.  For any such configuration with { p1/(1− p1)}/{p2/(1− p2)} = 2.15, the selection procedure will 
result in a correct selection with at least 90% probability.  Table 1 sho ws the operating 
characteristics of the selection procedure under various scenarios of true success probability 
configurations for the two arms.

The first scenario corresponds to the abovementioned design alternative which we believe is 
minimal clinically meaningful and worthwhile.  The second scenario describe  the operating 
characteristics of the selection procedure inside the indifference zone, assuming smaller differences 
in the success rates for the two interventions.  The third scenario illustrates a case where there is no 
true difference in the rates for th e two arms.   
 
In scenarios 1 and 2 where there is a superior arm, the design chooses the superior arm over 87% 
of the time across these scenarios with average sample sizes between 68.4 and 74.0. Under the 
design alternative, there is 82.5% probability that  we will stop the trial with 30 patients per arm.  The 
probability of having to truncate the study ranges from 3.5% to 10.6%, with the lowest probability for 
our design alternative.  The probability of selecting the superior arm at exactly 100 patients are 
enrolled is between 63.7% and 81.9% in these scenarios, which explains the need to continue 
enrollment to ensure that the correct dose is selected with high probability. Nevertheless, the 
conditional probability that correct selection is made given that exa ctly [ADDRESS_154556] been 
randomized is very high (between 96.4% and 99.2%).  
 
In scenario 3, there is no difference between the two arms.  Thus, the design randomly selects one 
of them with a probability of 0.50.  However, given that they are all the same,  it is acceptable to 
select any of them and thus the probability of selecting an acceptable intervention is 100%.  
Because there is no superior intervention in this scenario, evidence of an apparent advantage 
accumulates more slowly than under other scenari os and thus the procedure incurs a larger 
average sample size and probability of truncation.

i  and 
) 1 ( ) 5 . 0 () (+ +nXn
j . 
The values of success tallies used in LR are those used in the selection criteria, i.e., without data 
from incomplete pairs.  However, for the values of pi [INVESTIGATOR_136048], we will use the 
corresponding sample proportions using all of the available outcome data including data from 
incomplete pairs.  The LR may offer strong evidence of correct selection (if LR>10) or only weak 
evidence, and the LR weight of evidence will be t aken account of in evaluating whether or not to 
mount a subs equent phase 3  trial.  
 
For in stance, suppose we stop after 6 0 patients.  If the difference between the two groups’ success 
tallies is exactly equal to 4 (the minimum given the design), the likelih ood ratio (LR) in favor of 
having selected the truly better treatment as opposed to having made a mistaken selection equals 
the odds ratio (OR) raised to the 4th power.  Thus, at the design alternative p1=0.35, p2=0.20, the LR 
would be 21.5.  This is usually considered “very strong” evidence.  Likelihood ratios in excess of 8 or 
10 are generally considered to be moderate to strong evidence [Royall R. Statistical Evidence: A 
likelihood paradigm. 1997 Chapman and Hall/CRC  ]. For comparison, the usual “sig nificant at 
p<0.05” corresponds to a LR of only 6.8 in large samples. Furthermore, if the design alternative 
holds, it is highly probable the difference between success tallies will be greater than 4.  For 
example , if the tallies are 11 (about 30×0.35) and 6 (=3 0×0.20), the LR under the design alternative 
is much large r (46), very  strong evidence in favor of a correct selection.  
 
To address the weight of evidence in favor of the maximum likelihood estimate ( mle) being the true 
parameters as opposed to the null hypothesis p1=p2 being the true parameters, the generalized LR 
is 11.2 for the case T=60, X1=20, X2=10, which would again be moderate to strong evidence.  On 
the other hand, if X1=14, X2=10, LR=1.55, very weak evidence against the null hypothesis. 
Assuming the trial does not stop at T=60, the above LR’s will be assessed with the data at the time 
of selection at the observed mle’s for weight of evidence in favor of correct selection and fo r weight 
of evidence against the null hypothesis.  The assessments will be repeated when all data have been 
observed, including overrun data coming in after the time of selection.

and thereaft er will not be necessary unless we don’t have sufficient evidence (i.e., the difference in 
number of “good” outcomes is less than 4) to demonstrate one intervention is better than the other 
from the outcomes obtained from the first  [ADDRESS_154558] to continue sampling 
(after the first 3 0 pairs ) until a winner appears  and use the entire sample to construct the analysis , 
two consequences will occur: (1)  from point estimation standpoint, the probability of “good” outcome 
for the winner will b e over -estimated (and for the loser will be under -estimated); and (2) from 
hypothesis testing standpoint, as sampling plan  “enforces” the data to support the alternative 
hypothesis , bias then introduced against the null.  
 
Nevertheless, to prevent any bias  due to sampling, we propose to recruit the first 30 pairs without 
any look and/or comparison of their primary and secondary efficacy outcomes (unless the early 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_136049]). In such case, the 
recruitment of first 30 pairs of patients is independent of their outcome as we usually do for any 
fixed sample size design. Thus, conducting point estimation (together with a 95% confidence 
interval) and hypothesis testing with those 60 patients is entire ly appropriate (i.e., can be done 
unbiasedly).

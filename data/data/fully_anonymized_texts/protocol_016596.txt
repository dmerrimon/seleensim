Protocol Title: A Phase 2, Randomized, Double -Blind, Comparator -Controlled, 
Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of CRS3123 Compared w ith Oral 
Vancomycin in Adults with Clostridioides difficile  Infection  
Short Title: A Randomized, Double -blind Evaluation of CRS3123 Versus Oral 
Vancomycin in Adult Patients with Clostridioides difficile  Infection  
Rationale:  
Clostridioides difficile  (C. difficile) infection (CDI ) is currently classified as an urgent 
threat by [CONTACT_78477] ( CDC, 2015; CDC, 2019; 
McDonald et al, 2018 ), and is the most common cause of healthcare -associated infections 
in the US ( Magill et al, 2014). Over approximately the last decade , the incidence of C. 
difficile  in the US has ranged from approximately 200,000 to 500,000 cases per year  and 
mortality rate has ranged from a pproximately 13,000 to 29,000 deaths per year ( Lessa et 
al, 2015;  CDC, 2019).  Because C. difficile  is more common and more severe in older 
patients ( CDC, 2019) as the US population ages, the total numbers of patients may be 
expected to rise.  
CRS3123 is a novel narrow -spectrum small molecule antibiotic that selectively inhibits 
methionyl -tRNA synthetase of C. difficile . As a protein synthesis inhibitor, CRS3123 
inhibits C. difficile  toxin production and spore formation with no cross -resistance to 
existing antibiotics. CRS3123 exhibited minimal disruption of commensal 
gastrointestinal microbiota, blocking toxin and spore formation and exhibiting low 
recurrence rates compared to vancomycin in preclinical studies.  
CRS3123 has been evaluated in Phase 1 trials to determine its safety and tolerability in 
healthy subjects following a single oral dose of 100, 200, 400, 800 and 1200 mg 
(Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases [ DMID]  10-0008), or multiple 
ascending doses of 200, 400 and 600 mg orally twice  daily (bid) for 10 days (DMID 10 -
0009). CRS3123 was generally safe and well tolerated with no significant treatment -
emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported. CRS3123 showed very limited systemic 
absorption in humans and the majority of the oral dose remained intraluminal. F ecal 
concentrations reached levels above 1000 μg/g, substantially above the minimum 
inhibitory concentration necessary for 90% inhibition ( MIC 90, 1 μg/ml) at all dosages 
tested , and more than 10- fold above mutation prevention concentration (MPC) . CRS3123 
exhibited minimal perturbation of normal intestinal microbiota and had no effects against 
important commensal anaerobes including Bacteroides , Bifidobacteria , and commensal 
Clostridia . The results demonstrate the differentiating profile of CRS3123 from other 
agents and support its further development as an oral agent for the treatment of CDI. In 
this Phase 2, randomized, double -blind, comparator -controlled clinical study, CRS3123 
  
Protocol 19-[ADDRESS_85694] recurrence of CDI.  
Objectives and Endpoints : 
This is the first study in which CRS3123 is administered to participants with a primary 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_78473]. The primary objectives of the study are  the evaluation 
of safety and efficacy (rate of clinical cure at the test of cure  [TOC]  visit in the 
intent -to-treat [ITT] population). The secondary and exploratory objectives are additional 
evaluation of efficacy , assessment of plasma concentrations of CRS3123 , outcomes  of 
health -related quality of life (HR QoL), the effect of CRS3123 on the microbiology, fecal 
microbiome, fecal markers of inflammation, and metabolomics;  and the assessment of 
fecal concentration of CRS3 123. 
The study objectives and endpoints are presented in  Table 1.  Detailed schedules of study 
assessments are provided in Section  1.3.

Overall Design:  
This Phase 2, randomized, double -blind, comparator -controlled, multicenter study will be 
conducted to evaluate the primary objectives of safety  and efficacy  (rate of clinical cure) 
of 2 dosages of CRS3123 (200 mg and 400 mg) administered orally ( po) twice daily (bid)  
and vancomycin administered 125 mg po 4 times daily ( qid) in adults ≥ [ADDRESS_85697]  2023 
   
     The duration of the treatment period for all study  treatment arms is 10 days  (40 doses; 
administration of last dose may occur  on Day 11) . 
The Schedule of Activities is presented in Table 3  (Section  1.3). 
Participants must meet the entry criteria, including the diagnosis of CDI by [CONTACT_7661] 
≥ 3 diarrheal (Bristol Stool Scale scores 5, 6, or 7) stools/day in [ADDRESS_85698] be positive for C. difficile  Toxin A and/or B  antigen  
using an FDA or Health Canada approved/cleared EIA or ELISA laboratory test (e.g., 
Abbott/Alere QUIK CHEK COMPLETE®, Premier® Toxins A&B, etc.) .  A non- CLIA 
certified  site may perform a n Abbott /Alere QUIK CHEK COMPLETE® stool test 
provided by [CONTACT_78480], and if the test is positive for toxin A and/or B  antigen , the subject 
may randomize while the local standard of care test is pending ( i.e., NAAT, PCR, other 
toxin testing via EIA or ELISA).  
Participants will be randomized (1:1:1) to 1 of 3 treatment arms as shown below. The 
treatment period for each arm  will be 10 days. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_78481] (first epi[INVESTIGATOR_78474]) to ensure proper balance among 
treatment arms.  
• Treatment Arm A (n = 30 -36): CRS3123 200 mg po bid ( i.e., 400 mg/day)  
• Treatment Arm B (n = 30 -36): CRS3123 400 mg po bid ( i.e., 800 mg/day)  
• Treatment Arm C (n = 30 -36): Vancomycin 125 mg po qid ( i.e., 500 mg/day)  
Study procedures will be completed at the following visits:  
Screening Visit, Day -3 to Day 1: This is the pretreatment screening/ baseline visit to 
determine study eligibility.  
Treatment Period: Day 1 t hrough EOT: Participants will receive study treatment qid at 
approximately 6- hour intervals for a total of 4 doses per day. During the treatment period , 
in Treatment Arm C, v ancomycin comparator will be given as 125 mg capsules po qid; in 
Treatment Arms A and B, CRS3123 ( 200 mg and 400 mg, respectively) will be given po 
bid as doses 1 and 3, with placebos being given as doses 2 and 4. All study treatment 
(CRS3123, vancomycin, and placebo)  will have an identical appearance. Study treatment 
will be administered for a total of [ADDRESS_85699] dose of study treatment  may occur on the same calendar day as the screening 
visit. The participants will be instructed to take all study treatment  doses with water . 
Participants, regardless of treatment arm, should make every attempt to maintain the qid 
(approximately every 6 hours (q6h) [± 1.5 h]) schedule. If they slip outside of this 
schedule, the participants should take their dose as soon as possible and should not skip 
the dose. On the Participant Daily Diary , the participants should record any missed doses. 
  
Protocol 19-[ADDRESS_85700] which dose 
of study treatment they missed in the Participant Daily Diary.  
The end of treatment ( EOT ) assessments (described in Section  1.3) will be performed on 
the last calendar day that the participants receive the 40th dose of study treatment . For 
participants who prematurely discontinue study treatment, the EOT visit should occur as 
soon as possible after discontinuation  of study treatment; these participants  should 
continue to follow the Schedule of Activities for all subsequent planned visits . 
Participants may be either inpatient (at the clinical site) or outpatient ( this group may also 
include patients residing at skilled nursing facilities and rehabilitation facilities) based on 
investigator’s discretion, but regardless of status, all must comply with all study 
requirements, including visits , follow -up visits , and suspected recurrence visits during the 
follow -up period . 
Telephone contact [CONTACT_78482] t reatment period will occur on Days 3 and 6 as described in 
Schedule of Activities ( Section  1.3) to assess symptoms of clinical response or new or 
ongoing adverse events ( AEs)/serious adverse events ( SAEs ) and will comprise a scripted 
interview with a questionnaire capturing the severity of GI symptoms/resolution of 
symptoms.  
Participants will complete the Participant Daily Diary from Day - 1 (≤24 hours prior to 
randomization)  through the test of cure /Follow -up Visit 1 (TOC/ FUV1 , described 
below ), as well as for epi[INVESTIGATOR_78475] -up period, as specified in 
the Schedule of Activities ( Section  1.3). The Participant Daily Diary will include the 
date, time, and the Bristol Stool Scale score of each bowel movement  and concomitant 
medications  through TOC/FUV1 and at suspected recurrence , and adherence to study 
treatment through the EOT  visit. The Participant Daily D iary will also include the 
patient -reported outcome (PRO) questionnaire (CDI- DaySyms), which will  be used to 
assess CDI symptoms as well as  quality of life parameters from screening through 
TOC/FUV1 (Kleinman et al, 2018 ; Talbot et al, 2019).   The Daily Diary must be 
reconciled by [CONTACT_78483] , the Investigator’s assessment of clinical response, or diagnosis of recurrence.  
Safety assessments will be performed at each visit from screening to FUV 2 as indicated 
in the Schedule of Activities ( Section  1.3).  Safety will be assessed by A es, physical 
examinations, vital signs, laboratory evaluations (hematology, chemistry, and/or 
urinalysis  at most visits and coagulation at screening and EOT visit only ), and 
electrocardiogram (ECG ) parameters. Plasma concentration s will be assessed  by 
[CONTACT_78484] 1 and the EOT visit  (Section  1.3).  Exploratory 
pharmacokinetic ( PK) fecal concentration analysis will be assessed by [CONTACT_78485] 1  and EOT  visit.   
Follow -up Period : There will be a total of 3 Follow -up Visits (FUVs). The TOC/ FUV1 
will be  at least [ADDRESS_85701] dose,  FUV2 (early recurrence visit ), and FUV3 (late 
recurrence visit) . The TOC/FUV1 and FUV2 follow -up visits  will be conducted as direct 
  
Protocol 19-[ADDRESS_85702] , using a scripted interview , 
will occur on Day 20 (± 3 days) , Day 27 (± 3 days) , and FUV3 (± 3 days)  of the f ollow -
up period to assess symptoms of clinical recurrence and new or ongoing A es/SAEs, and 
capture the severity of gastrointestinal (GI ) symptoms/resolution of symptoms.  
If signs and symptoms of CDI recurrence are suspected, participants must come in for an 
unscheduled  Suspected  Recurrence Visit earlier than the next planned visit, as applicable. 
Following the Suspected Recurrence Visit, participants will be treated per standard of 
care and continue to follow the Schedule of A ctivities  for all subsequent planned visits 
and telephone calls. A  test for C. difficile  Toxin A and/or B  antigen using an FDA or 
Health Canada approved/cleared EIA or ELISA laboratory test must be performed at the 
unscheduled Recurrence Visit.    
The study participant is expected to complete all study visits unless the participant dies or  
withdraws consent.  
A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be established and managed in this study 
by [CONTACT_50722] (NIAID) to analyze aEs and 
other safety data.  
Number of Participants:  
This protocol plans to enroll approximately 90 to 108 participants who meet study entry 
criteria, who will be randomly assigned to treatment in 1 of 3 treatment arms in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_85703] 95% confidence interval for the 
treatment of cure rate is (0.67, 0.94). Alternatively, if 30 participants  are enrolled in each 
CRS3123 treatment arm and true rate of clinical cure at TOC is 0.83, then the 95% CI for 
the rate is (0.65, 0.94). 
Number of Sites and Duration of Study : 
Up to  50 sites will be used to recruit participants, based on published CDI enrollment rate 
of 2.4 participants per site per year for fidaxomicin Phase 3 study ( Cornely et al , 2012 ). 
The study will be conducted in [LOCATION_002] and Canada. 
The duration of study will be approximately [ADDRESS_85704]  2023 
   
     Treatment  Arm s and Duration:  
The estimated  duration of study participation is approximately 70 days from the 
screening visit to FUV3; see Table 3 Schedule of Activities  footnote ‘a’.  
The screening period will be up to [ADDRESS_85705] dose  or as soon as 
possible after early study treatment discontinuation, and 3 follow -up visits (FUV1, 
FUV2 , and FUV3) . Additionally, phone calls during the treatment period ( on Day s 3 and 
6) and during the f ollow -up period ( Day 20, Day 27, and FUV3) will be conducted, as 
described above and shown in Figure 1.

Summary of Statistical Methods  
Baseline data including demographic information (age, sex, race), medical history, and 
baseline signs and symptoms will be summarized by [CONTACT_78486].  
Safety will be assessed in the Safety population. The number and percentage of 
participants with TEAEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, and 
treatment arm . TEAEs will also be summarized by [CONTACT_78487], system 
  
Protocol 19-[ADDRESS_85706] confidence intervals will be created to compare the difference in rates in the each of 
the CRS3123 groups versus the vancomycin group:  
• Clinical cure at TOC (primary endpoint in ITT population)   
• Clinical cure at TOC (secondary endpoints  in Micro -ITT, PP, and ME populations ) 
• Clinical cure at TOC as assessed by [CONTACT_093]  
• Total relief of symptoms of CDI at TOC  
• Early recurrence of CDI through FUV2 
• Late recurrence of CDI through FUV3 
• Recurrence of CDI though FUV3  
• Global cure ( clinical cure at TOC) and no recurrence through FUV2  
Kaplan -Meier analyses of time to resolution of diarrhea through TOC as well as time to 
recurrence through FUV [ADDRESS_85707]-baseline visit will also be summarized by [CONTACT_78488].  
If feasible, primary parameters will be estimated from concentration versus time data 
using a population PK approach (plasma PK only) . Plasma PK parameters may include 
maximum concentration ( Cmax), time to maximum  concentration  (tmax), terminal half -life 
(t1/2), area under the concentration -time curve from 0 to 24 hours ( AUC 0-24) and apparent 
clearance ( CL/F), and accumulation ratio calculated using the  estimated  AUC 0-[ADDRESS_85708]  2023

a Screening and Day 1: Screening assessments for study eligibility can occur within [ADDRESS_85712] dose of study treatment . 
Screening and Day 1 can occur on the same calendar day.   For instances when the  study run- in period for study eligibility may be delayed (e.g., weekends, 
holidays, etc.), the screening period can be extended up to 72 hours  (all eligibility criteria still apply including the requirement for ≥3 diarrheal (Bristol Stool 
Scale scores 5, 6, or 7) stools/day within in a 24-hour period prior to randomization) .  
  
Protocol 19-[ADDRESS_85713]  2023 
   
     b Mandatory clinic al site  visits occur on Day 1, EOT,  TOC/FUV1, and FUV2 , and at suspected recurrence , as shown in the Table of Activities . For 
participants who are inpatient  at the clinical site , all safety assessments during the treatment period are performed in person daily. Participants will attend 
EOT, TOC/FUV1, and FUV [ADDRESS_85714] biomarkers of inflammation , 
and/or metabolome testing will occur at all in-person visits  based on the Schedule of Activities . If signs and symptoms of CDI recur at any point in the study 
between TOC/ FUV1  and FUV [ADDRESS_85715] calendar day  that the participants receive the 40th dose of study treatment  (ostensibly Day  10; with a + [ADDRESS_85716] e. TOC /FUV1  assessments will occur  at least [ADDRESS_85717] administered study drug . Note: Participants who discontinue study treatment prematurely should come in for an EOT visit as 
soon as possible after  study treatment  discontinuation , and then continue to follow the Schedule of Activities for all subsequent planned visits  and telephone 
calls, including TOC/FUV1 through FUV 3 (telephone contact [CONTACT_78491] [ADDRESS_85718]) . 
d Telephone contact [CONTACT_78492] 3 and 6 during the treatment period  to assess clinical response as well as on Day 20 , Day 27, and FUV3  of the follow -
up period to assess symptoms of clinical recurrence, or new or ongoing AEs/SAEs. A scripted interview  capturing the severity of  gastrointestinal 
symptoms/resolution of symptoms, including resolution of diarrhea, will be administered during the call  and participants will be reminded of any upcoming 
clinic al site  visits. If signs and symptoms of CDI recurrence are suspected at any point between FUV1/TOC and  FUV 3, participants must come in for an 
unscheduled Suspected  Recurrence Visit.  Note: In the event a participant is an inpatient at the clinical  site at the time of a scheduled Telephone Contact, the 
Telephone Contact [CONTACT_78493] -person visit during the treatment period .  
e Participants who have a recurrence after TOC/ FUV1 should be treated per standard of care and continue to follow the Schedule of Activities for FUV2  and 
FUV3 . C. difficile  culture as well as a stool evaluation for Toxin A and/or B antigen should be performed at suspected recurrence . A non-CLIA certified site 
may also perform a n Abbott/Alere QUIK CHEK COMPLETE® test according to the package insert with results verified by a second individual and a 
photograph of the result recorded with the date and time of the result .  
f Written informed consent must be obtained before any nonstandard of care screening assessments are performed. All inclusion and exclusion criteria need to 
be met before randomization on Day 1.  
g A complete physical examination evaluation will be performed at screening and include evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, nos e, and throat (HEENT), neck, 
lungs, heart, chest, abdomen, extremities, neurological status, and skin, as well as height, and wei ght. A focused physical examination and measurement of 
weight will be performed on subsequent indicated visits and at Suspected Recurrence Visit (if applicable) . 
h Vital signs include temperature, pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and blood pressure.  
i 12-lead ECG will be performed in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547].  
j CBC with differential, chemistry (including sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, chloride, BUN, serum creatinine, glucose, total prote in, albumin, alkaline 
phosphatase, total bilirubin, ALT, AST , lipase,  amylase,  and CPK), coagulation, and CRP will be performed in the local laboratory at screening  with a 
subset of tests used to evaluate eligibility.  It is not necessary for all labs to be resulted prior to randomization except those that would affect eligibility . 
Results that affect eligibility are confirmation of C. difficile  toxin A and/or B  antigen  in stool , pregnancy test.  Labs drawn within [ADDRESS_85719] received a nti-CDI therapy for longer than 24 hours.   When the turn-
around time of laboratory results affecting study eligibility may be delayed (e.g., weekends, holidays, etc.), the screening period is up to 72 hours  (all 
eligibility criteria still apply including the requirement for ≥3 diarrheal (Bristol Stool Scale scores 5, 6, or 7) stools/day in 24 hours prior to randomization) . 
k Female participants of childbearing potential must have a urine pregnancy test (β -HCG) at screening and FUV 2 performed at the local laboratory. Women of 
non-childbearing potential include women who are postmenopausal as demonstrated by [CONTACT_78494] ≥ 12 months or surgical sterili zation (ie., tubal 
  
Protocol 19-[ADDRESS_85720]  2023 
   
     ligation, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy). Provision of documentation is not required for f emale sterilization; verbal 
confirmation is adequate.  
l All inclusion and exclusion criteria need to be met before randomization on Day 1. All participants will be centrally assigne d to randomized study treatment  
via IRT. 
m Day [ADDRESS_85721] day for administration of study treatment  and subsequent days are calendar days. Blister packs  (each containing 20 doses ) will be dispensed 
on Day 1. Participants will receive study treatment  on Days 1 through 10, qid, at approximately 6 -hour intervals  (± 1.5 h), for a total of [ADDRESS_85722] dose of study treatment  should be administered as quickly as 
possible after eligibility criteria are met. If the participant discontinues study treatment  prematurely, an EOT visit should occur as soon as possible after 
study treatment discontinuation . NOTE: All doses should be taken with water . Participants, regardless of treatment arm, should make every attempt to 
maintain the qid (approximately every 6 hours (q6h) [± 1.5 h]) schedule. If they slip outside of this schedule, the participa nts should take their dose as soon 
as possible and should n ot skip the dose. On the Participant Daily Diary , the participants should record any missed doses . Dose 1 will be administered on site 
to facilitate plasma PK sample collection . 
n All medications taken within 30 -days prior to screening as well as medications taken during the study period (randomization through FUV3 ) should be 
recorded.  
o All adverse events, including serious adverse events, will be collected from randomization  through FUV 3 at the timepoints indicated in the Schedule of 
Activities, above . 
p Safety laboratory assessments performed by [CONTACT_78495], chemistry, CRP,  coagulation parameters , and 
urinalysis  at the indicated timepoints . Coagulation will be assessed  only at screening  (local laboratory) and EOT  visit (central laboratory) .  
q The Participant Daily Diary will be completed from D -1 (≤24h prior to randomization) daily  through  TOC /FUV1  and at suspected recurrence and reviewed 
by [CONTACT_78496] . The Participant Daily Diary includes details for each bowel movement  and concomitant medications  through TOC/FUV 1 and at 
suspected recurrence; any missed doses of study treatment  through EOT , and the CDI-DaySyms PRO questionnaire  through TOC /FUV1 . For participants 
treated as outpatients, the Participant Daily Diary  will be reviewed during visits at the clinical site  and phone call days during the treatment period ( i.e., Days 
3 and 6 ). For participants treated in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], Participant Daily Diary review will occur daily.   
r Patients that are clinical failures at TOC or at any subsequent visit do not need to complete further investigator’s assessments beyond that visit; however, 
patients will continue visits per the Schedule of Activities for  all other assessments . 
s Blood and fecal samples for assessment of plasma and fecal concentrations  will be collected at the clinical site  and provided  to the bioanalytical laboratory  
for CRS3123 concentration analysis .  The date and time of each study treatment  dose for each respective PK sampling, and the date and time of each sample 
collection (not processing), must be captured in the clinic.    
t Fecal s amples for microbiology, microbiome, and host biomarkers of inflammation testing must be collected at the clinical site prior to  first dose of study 
treatment (as described in footnote “v”)  and at subsequent post-Day 1 visits shown in the Schedule of Activities, including at time of suspected recurrence if 
applicable.  Of note, the culturing of toxigenic C. difficile  and microbial susceptibility testing will be performed only from the initial, TOC, and recurrence 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_78476] (including early discontinuation due to clinical failure) . 
u A portion of the collected fecal sample will also be used for metabolomics analysis  prior to first dose of study treatment (as described in footnote “v”) and 
subsequent post-Day [ADDRESS_85723]  2023 
   
     v Fecal sample collection:  Fecal samples of ≥ [ADDRESS_85724] dose of study treatment.  This sample can be 
collected at Screening or on Day 1 (predose). For  fecal  PK analysis only, a n additional  fecal sample will be taken on Day 1 postdose (first bowel movement 
after dose).  Fecal samples collected on subsequent visits will be used only for the analyses planned for that specific visit as indicated in the Schedule of 
Activities.  (Note: The date and time of each study treatment dose and the date and time of each sample collection (not processing) must b e captured in the 
clinic. Fecal samples will be processed by [CONTACT_78497] t o the relevant designated laboratories for 
analysis .  Stool samples may be collected as early as 24 -hours prior to each study visit and up to 24 -hours after each study visit.  Stool samples collected 
within 24 -hours of the desired collection day will not constitute a protocol deviation.  
w    Microbiology samples should be collected at both the EOT visit and TOC /FUV1  visit; however, the EOT visit sample will be analyzed if the TOC/FUV1  
sample is missing  or if the participant discontinues study treatment prematurely.

Background : Russia  has a high prevalence  of (human  immunodeficiency  virus)  HIV infections . In 2018,  over 
one million  persons  were  living  with HIV (PLWH);  over a third were  women.  A high proportion  of HIV-infected  
women  are co-infected  with Hepatitis  C virus  (HCV) , and many  consume  alcohol,  which  adversely  affects  
HIV and HCV  treatment  and prognosis.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_183820], HIV and HCV,  and the 
need  for interventions  to reduce  alcohol  use among  HIV/HCV  co-infected  women,  evidence -based  alcohol  
reduction  interventions  for this vulnerable  population  are limited.  To address  this gap, we developed  a 
clinical  trial to evaluate  the efficacy  of a computer -based  intervention  to reduce  alcohol  consumption  among  
HIV/HCV  co-infected  women  in clinical  care.   
 
Methods : In this two-arm parallel  randomized  clinical  trial, we propose  to evaluate  the efficacy  of a culturally -
adapted  alcohol  reduction  intervention  delivered  via a computer  for HIV/HCV  co-infected  Russian  women.  
The study  population  consists  of women  21-45 years  old with confirmed  HIV/HCV  co-infection  who currently  
use alcohol.  Intervention  efficacy  is assessed  by a novel  alcohol  biomarker,  ethyl  glucuronide  (EtG) , and 
biomarkers  of HIV and HCV  disease  progression.  Women  are randomized  to trial conditions  in a 1:1 
allocation  ratio,  using  a computer -generated  algorithm  to develop  the assignment  sequence  and 
concealment  of allocation  techniques  to minimize  assignment  bias.  Women  are randomized  to either:  (1) 
standard -of-care,  clinician -delivered  MET,  plus a computer -based  MET  intervention , or (2) standard -of-care 
plus clinician -delivered  motivational  enhancement  therapy  (MET) . We will use an intent -to-treat analysis  and 
logistic  and linear  generalized  estimating  equations  to evaluate  intervention  efficacy,  relative  to the standard -
of-care,  in enhancing  the proportion  of women  with a laboratory -confirmed  negative  EtG at each  research  
study  visit over the 9-month  follow -up period.  Additional  analyses  will evaluate  intervention  effec ts on HIV 
(viral  load and CD4+  levels)  and HCV  markers  of disease  progression  (FibroScan).  
 
Discussion : The proposed  trial design  and analysis  provides  an appropriate  conceptual  and methodological  
framework  to assess  the efficacy  of the computer -based  intervention.  We propose  to recruit  [ADDRESS_217047]-effective  alcohol  reduction  strategy  that is 
scalable  and can be readily  disseminated  and integrated  into clinical  care in Russia  to reduce  women’s  
alcohol  consumption  and enhance  HIV/HCV  prognosis.

Background  and rationale  
The human  immunodeficiency  virus  (HIV) and hepatitis  C virus  (HCV)  epi[INVESTIGATOR_183821].  As of 2018,  over one million  persons  were  living  with HIV (PLWH)  in the 
Russian  Federation  (Russia).2 Women  made  up 37% of new HIV diagnoses,  almost  tripling  the [ADDRESS_217048]  proportion  of PLWH  with serological  evidence  of HCV  infection  (27%).3 The prevalence  of HIV/HCV  
co-infection  is markedly  higher  among  individuals  with a history  of injection  drug use (PWID).  A recent  review  
estimated  an HCV  prevalence  of 69% among  PWID  compared  to 4.6%  among  PLWH  without  a history  of 
injection  drug use in Russia.4 Among  HIV-infected  women  in Saint  Petersburg,  Russia,  a study  by [CONTACT_183835] 57.1%  were  HCV  co-infected.[ADDRESS_217049]  contributed  to the rapid  spread  of HIV/HCV  co-infection  among  PWID  globally,6 including  in 
Saint  Petersburg,  Russia.7-9  
 
Alcohol  use poses  a significant  and persistent  health  threat  to women  living  with HIV/HCV  co-infection.  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_183822],10 problem  alcohol  use is prevalent  
in Russia  and adversely  impacts  the treatment  and prognosis  of women  living  with HIV/HCV  by [CONTACT_183836].11 A recent  meta -analysis  estimated  that 55% [95%  confidence  interval  (CI): 16%-
88%]  of Russian  participants  engaged  in heavy  epi[INVESTIGATOR_183823] 58% (95%  CI: 49%-67%)  met 
diagnostic  criteria  for alcohol  use disorder.12 A World  Health  Organization  study  estimated  that among  
Russian  women,  43.7%  of those  who drank  were  heavy  epi[INVESTIGATOR_183824] 19.9%  in Europe  as a 
whole.13 A recent  study  among  PLWH  in Saint  Petersburg  found  that, overall,  45.3%  of women  reported  
drinking  in the past week . Of those , 21.6%  reported  at least  one heavy  epi[INVESTIGATOR_183825]  (4 or more  
drinks).14 
 
Among  HIV/HCV  co-infected  individuals,  alcohol  use may also lead to various  adverse  health  outcomes.  
HIV/HCV  co-infected  individuals  develop  liver disease  earlier  and are diagnosed  with more  severe  liver 
disease  than those  who are HIV mono -infected.15-17 Excessive  alcohol  consumption  is a significant  
contributor  to liver-related  mortality  among  persons  with HIV/HCV  co-infection.[ADDRESS_217050]  health  complications,  alcohol  may heighten  health  risks to PLWH  by [CONTACT_183837]  (ARV)  therapy.  For example,  alcohol  and ARV interactions  may contribute  to hepatoxicity  
and liver disease,15,17 which  may be accelerated  by [CONTACT_3252]-morbid  HCV  infection.20 Furthermore,  a history  of 
alcohol  use may impede  persons  with HIV/HCV  co-infection  from benefiting  from the new generation  of HCV  
treatments,  such  as direct acting  anti-HCV  drugs .21 Current  recommendations  are for individuals  with 
HIV/HCV  co-infection  to abstain  from alcohol  use given  that safe drinking  levels  have  not been  defined  for 
Page  4 of 21 this population.22 There  is conflicting  evidence  concerning  the health  effects  of moderate  alcohol  
consumption  among  HCV  mono -infected  and HCV/HIV  co-infected  persons,  with some  studies  finding  that 
even  moderate  amounts  of alcohol  may accelerate  disease  progression,  while  other  studies  identify  no such  
association.23,24 
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_183826]/HCV  co-infected  women,  few evidence -
based  interventions  are available .25,[ADDRESS_217051]  of the interventions  did not target  alcohol  use 
exclusively,  but addressed  other  high-risk behaviours  (e.g.,  reducing  sexual  risk behaviours ) or focus ed on 
substance  use more  broadly.  In addition,  the majority  of interventions  were  conducted  in the U.S.;  to our 
knowledge,  none  were  implemented  and evaluated  in Russia.25 
 
In this two-arm parallel  randomized  clinical  trial, we propose  to evaluate  the efficacy  of a brief,  culturally -
adapted,  computer -delivered  alcohol  reduction  intervention  for Russian  women  with HIV/HCV  co-infection.  
The intervention  includes  modules  utilizing  cognitive  behavioural  and motivational  enhancement  principles  to 
reduce  alcohol  consumption.  Brief interventions  based  on cognitive  behavioural  therapy  that include  
personalized  feedback  about  alcohol  use, the establishment  of personal  drinking  goals , and tracking  of goal 
progress  coupled  with behavioural  strategies  to reduce  alcohol  use are efficacious.27,[ADDRESS_217052]-effective  strategy  to reduce  alcohol  use among  women  with HIV/HCV  co-infection  within  
the framework  of comprehensive  HIV care,  in line with current  strategies  to strengthen  HIV-care delivery.  
 
Objectives  
The study  objectives  are: 
1. To evaluate  the efficacy  of a standard -of-care,  clinician -delivered  MET,  plus a computer -based  MET  
intervention , relative  to the standard  of care plus clinician -delivered  MET  condition,  in enhancing  the 
proportion  of HIV/HCV  co-infected  women  detected  with laboratory -confirmed  negative  alcohol  
biomarker  over a 9-month  follow -up period.  
2. To evaluate  the efficacy  of a computer -based  MET  intervention  condition,  relative  to the standard  of 
care plus clinician -delivered  MET  condition,  in reducing  HIV/HCV  co-infected  women’s  HIV and HCV  
biomarkers  of disease  progression  over a 9-month  follow -up period.  
 
Trial  design  
Page  5 of 21 The proposed  study  is a parallel  two-arm randomized  control  trial to evaluate  the efficacy  of a culturally -
adapted  computer -based  alcohol  reduction  intervention  for HIV/HCV  co-infected  Russian  women  in clinical  
care.   
 
Following  receipt  of informed  consent  and enrolment  in the study,  200 women  are randomized  to one of two 
conditions  following  a 1:1 allocation  ratio:  (1) standard -of-care, the clinician -delivered  MET , plus the adapted  
computer -based  intervention  condition  (n=100),  or (2) the standard -of-care plus clinician -delivered  MET  
(n=100).   
 
Data  are collected  at baseline,  before  randomization,  and at 3-, 6- and 9-month  follow -up during  scheduled  
research  visits  via self-report  surveys.  In addition,  biological  markers  are collected  at baseline  and at each  
follow -up assessment  to obtain  objective  and quantifiable  measures  of alcohol  use and HIV and HCV  
disease  status . The proposed  trial design  provides  an appropriate  conceptual  and methodological  framework  
to determine  the intervention’s  efficacy  in reducing  alcohol  use and HIV and HCV  disease  progression  (see 
Figure  1). 
 
Methods:  Participants,  interventions  and outcomes  
Study  setting  
The intervention  is implemented  in HIV clinical  care facilities  in Saint  Petersburg,  Russia.  Saint  Petersburg  is 
the second  largest  city in Russia,  with a population  of approximately  5 million . It has a high concentration  of 
PWID , a critical  risk behaviour  associated  with HIV/HCV  acquisition.[ADDRESS_217053]:  1) be women  ages  21-45 years;  2) have  chart -documented  HIV and HCV  
infection;  3) be currently  prescribed  ARV therapy;  4) have  a positive  point -of-care ethyl  glucuronide  (EtG)  or 
self-report  alcohol  use in the past 30 days.  Women  who are medically,  cognitively,  or psychologically  
incapable  of study  participation,  as assessed  by a research  clinician,  are excluded,  as those  who do not 
provide  written  informed  consent  to participate.  
 
Who  will take informed  consent?  
A research  staff member  explains  the study,  reviews  the consent  form with participants,  and answers  any 
questions  before  women  provide  written  consent  to participate  in the study.  All eligible  participants  must  
complete  consent  procedures  before  enrolment  and randomi sation.  Measures  are being  implemented  to 
protect  study  participants.  Study  staff are instructed  to highlight  confidentiality  and assure  participants  that 
their responses  would  not be shared  with clinic  staff or adversely  affect  service  provision.

Compensation  
Participants  receive  a 1000 -ruble  (~16 United  States  Dollars,  USD ) valued  gift card at baseline  and at the 9-
month  follow -up visit and a 500-ruble  (~8 USD)  valued  gift card for each  completed  intermediary  
assessments  (3- and 6-month  research  visits).  
 
Additional  consent  provisions  for collection  and use of participant  data and 
biological  specimens  
The consent  form explains  to participants  that de-identified  data will be part of a general  dataset  that may be 
shared  with other  researchers.  In terms  of biological  specimens,  the consent  form explains  that if participants  
choose  to join the study,  they will be donating  their samples  and study  information.  If they withdraw  from the 
study,  data and samples  collected  may still be used  for this study.  Participants  are informed  that study  
records  can be opened  by [CONTACT_183838] a subpoena  or a request  for the 
production  of documents.  Further  study  records  may be shared  with regulatory  authorities,  such  as the IRB, 
government  agencies  and study  funders.  
 
Interventions  
Explanation  for the choice  of comparators  
This trial compares  the efficacy  of clinician -delivered  alcohol  reduction  MET  counselling  to a computer -
delivered  MET -based  alcohol  use reduction  intervention . We hypothesize  that the computer -delivered  
intervention  may be less costly , less demanding  on human  resources  and more  feasible  to integrate  into 
clinical  care than the current  standard -of-care, with comparable  results.  
 
Intervention  description  
 
Standard -of-care condition  plus clinician -delivered  MET  plus computer -based  MET  counseling  
 
Women  in the intervention  condition  receive  a brief computer -based  intervention  to reduce  alcohol  use 
guided  by [CONTACT_183839].  The computerized  intervention  includes  modules  to: (a) provide  
an overview  of the intervention  and information  regarding  the impact  of alcohol  use on disease  progression;  
(b) assess  current  levels  of drinking  and provide  feedback  on alcohol  use; (c) set alcohol  reduction  goals  and 
enhance  motivation  to modify  drinking  behaviours ; (d) address  challenges  associated  with achieving  drinking  
goals;  and (e) provide  strategies  to reduce  alcohol  use. The computerized  intervention  was adapted  to be 
culturally  appropriate  and incorporates  vignettes  to illustrate  intervention  content.  After  each  computer -based  
session,  a study  clinician  meets  with participants  to establish  drinking  goals  and discuss  strategies  to 
achieve  these  goals  during  a brief one-on-one motivational  enhancement  session.  Participants  randomized  
to the intervention  condition  also continue  to receive  the standard  of care for alcohol  use provided  in the 
clinic  plus clinician -delivered  MET . 
 
Page  [ADDRESS_217054] -of-care condition  plus clinician -delivered  MET  
 
Women  receiving  treatment  for HIV/HCV  at the two clinical  care sites are routinely  asked  about  their alcohol  
and other  substance  use and counselled  using  MET  approaches  to avoid  alcohol  and other  substances  by 
[CONTACT_183840].  When  the treating  clinician  deems  it appropriate,  women  are referred  to community -based  care 
for substance  use treatment.  In addition,  all women  receive  an educational  brochure  with information  
describing  the adverse  effects  of alcohol  use for persons  with HIV/HCV  co-infection  and a list of community -
based  resources  to seek  further  help.   
 
Criteria  for discontinuing  or modifying  allocated  interventions  
A staff psychiatrist  assesses  women’s  mental  health  as part of routine  care and as requested  by a treating  
clinician  and refers  women  diagnosed  with alcohol  dependence  to substance  use treatment . The psychiatrist  
may recommend  discontinuing  participation  in the trial if a participant  is deemed  psychologically  incapable  of 
continued  participation.  
 
Strategies  to improve  adherence  to interventions  
The intervention  consists  of taking  a brief computer -based  program;  therefore,  the key strategy  to promote  
adherence  is the outreach  efforts  to invite  women  back  to the clinic  to complete  the first and follow -up 
sessions.  To improve  adherence,  research  staff will call participants  to schedule  visits,  using  the contact  
[CONTACT_183841].   
 
Relevant  concomitant  care permitted  or prohibited  during  the trial 
All routine  treatment  procedures  for women  in care for HIV and HCV , as deemed  appropriate  by [CONTACT_102]’s  
treating  clinicians,  are permitted  during  the trial. 
 
Provisions  for post -trial care 
Trial participation  does  not present  more  than minimal  risk to subjects  beyond  those  encountered  as part of 
routine  care.  Therefore,  no special  provisions  for post-trial care were  included.  
 
Outcomes  
Biomarkers  (EtG and phosphatidylethanol,  PEth)  are used  to assess  the efficacy  of the intervention  on 
alcohol  use patterns  and two associated  health  outcomes,  HIV and HCV,  as described  below.   
 
The primary  outcome  measure  used  to evaluate  the efficacy  of the adapted  computer -based  alcohol  
reduction  intervention  condition  plus the clinician -delivered  MET , relative  to the standard  of care plus 
clinician -delivered  MET  condition  alone , will be the proportion  of women  who test EtG negative  at each  of the 
follow -up assessments  over 9-month s. 
 
Page  8 of 21 HIV disease  progression  is evaluated  based  on changes  in HIV viral load and CD4+  count  over the 9-month  
follow -up period  in the intervention  arm relative  to the control  arm. HCV  disease  progression  is assessed  
using  two non-invasive  biomarkers  collected  routinely  as part of ongoing  HCV  care.  The first is FibroTest  
which  uses  six different  biomarkers  (α2-macroglobulin,  haptoglobin,  γ-glutamyl  transpeptidase , 
apolipoprotein  A1, alanine  transaminase,  and total bilirubin)  to generate  a score  that is correlated  with the 
degree  of liver damage.33 The second  is FibroScan , a specialized  ultrasound  that measure s the degree  of 
fibrosis  and steatosis  in the liver,  providing  objective  and quantifiable  measures  of HCV -associated  liver 
damage .34 The procedure  is painless  and performed  at point -of-care.  
 
Sample  size 
The sample  size of 200 women  (1:1 allocation  ratio)  was arrived  at based  on a power  analysis.  The most  
conservative  hypothesis  compares  differences  between  trial conditions  in the proportion  of participants  
detected  with a negative  EtG test over the 9-month  follow -up. EtG was selected  for the power  analysis  
because  it is a sensitive  biological  test of alcohol  use and has a broad  alcohol detection  window  (5 days).  
The power  calculations  for the negative  EtG test were  based on our previous  pi[INVESTIGATOR_183827]  30% of 
HIV/HCV -infected  Russian  wom en were  identified  with a negative  alcohol  use biomarker .[ADDRESS_217055]  (delta  = -0.2; odds  ratio = 0.3) in the number  of women  testing  EtG negative  
under  a repeated  measures  logistic  regression  analysis  framework,  assuming  an intra-cluster  correlation  of 
0.10 and 10% loss-to-follow -up. Analyses  were  conducted  in Stata  15.1 (Stata  Corporation  LP, College  
Station,  TX). 
 
Recruitment   
Recruitment  is conducted  at two affiliated  clinical  sites that provide  comprehensive  HIV care.  The study  
coordinator  in Russia,  a medical  doctor  with specialization  in infectious  diseases,  reviews  medical  records  to 
assess  potential  eligibility.  A clinician  at each  clinic  then invites  participants  to the study  and schedules  a 
follow -up visit with a research  staff member.   
 
Assignment  of interventions:  allocation  
Sequence  generation   
A computer  algorithm  is used  to generate  a random  allocation  sequence  prior to the study  initiation.   
 
Concealment  mechanism   
We use concealment  of allocation  techniques  to promote  unbiased  randomization.[ADDRESS_217056] of allocations  generated  in the U.S. and informs  other  
researchers  of the allocation  following  participant  screening  and enrolment . 
 
Assignment  of interventions:  Blinding  
Who  will be blinded   
Because  the intervention  entails  completing  a computer -based  program , neither  providers  nor participants  
are blinded  to the intervention  assignment;  however,  the statisticians  conducting  the efficacy  analyses  will be 
blinded  to allocation . Research  members  in Russia  will assign  a code  to each  of the two arms,  which will be 
undisclosed  to U.S.-based  data analysts.  
 
Procedure  for unblinding  if needed   
The design  is an open  label , so unblinding  will not occur.  
 
Data  collection  and management  
Plans  for assessment  and collection  of outcomes   
Data  for efficacy  assessment  is collected  at baseline  and 3-, 6- and 9-months  post-intervention  initiation  
using  multiple  data-capture  modalities.  Participants  complete  a brief self-report  survey  assessing  basic  
demographics,  and history  of alcohol  and other  substance  use. In addition  to basic  demographics,  such  as 
age, education  and income,  the brief survey  includes  validated  self-report  measures  of alcohol  use (e.g.,  
alcohol  use frequency  and quantity , and heavy  epi[INVESTIGATOR_183828] ).[ADDRESS_217057]  two biomarkers:  1) a urine  sample  from each  woman  at each  study  visit for EtG analysis , 
which  assess es recent  alcohol  use; and 2) a dried  blood  spot at the 9-month  follow -up for PEth  analysis,  
which  measures  alcohol  use over the past 21-days.  A research  staff member  abstracts  via medical  record  
review  the following  data:  (a) length  of HIV and HCV  infection,  (b) HIV viral load,  (c) cluster  of differentiation  
4 cells (CD4+ ) count,  (d) FibroTest  score  (based  on liver function  biomarkers,  such  as apolipoprotein  A1, 
alanine  transaminase,  and total bilirubin,  etc.),  (e) prescribed  ARV regime,  and (f) HCV  treatment.  Research  
staff consisted  of clinicians  experienced  in the care of PLWH  who received  training  on implementation  of 
study  procedures,  including  on EtG administration  at point -of-care.   
 
EtG is an ethanol  metabolite  widely  used  to detect  any alcohol  consumption  in the past [ADDRESS_217058]  a sensitivity  of 100%  and a specificity  of 97%.[ADDRESS_217059] 3-week  alcohol  use,40 including  among  PLWH.41,42  Among  PLWH,  
the sensitivity  for any detectable  PEth  has been  estimated  at 88% and the specificity  at 89%.42 Collecting  
three  different  alcohol  use measures  –EtG, PEth , and self-reported  use– will allow  us to triage  the 
information  and assess  measurement  errors  and reporting  biases.  Fibro Test is a scoring system  based  on 
Page  [ADDRESS_217060]  has satisfactory  predictive  validity  of fibrosis  staging,  
with Areas  Under  the Curve  ranging  from 73% to 80% depending  on liver disease  progression  compared  to 
biopsy  results .[ADDRESS_217061]  loss-to-follow -up to be minimal  and not to exceed  10%.  Factors  to improve  
intervention  adherence  and prevent  loss-to-follow -up over the 9-month  follow -up period  are that all research  
personnel  and clinical  staff are highly  qualified  and trained  in working  with PLWH;  that most  patients  have  a 
trusting  relationship  with study  clinicians;  and that all research  staff is from Saint  Petersburg.  In addition,  staff 
will call participants  to schedule  subsequent  research  visits.  Participants’  contact  [CONTACT_183842].  
 
Data  management   
In accordance  with the National  Institutes  of Health  (NIH)  requirements,  the clinical  trial established  a data 
and safety  monitoring  plan to ensure  participant s’ privacy  and confidentiality  during  the trial and as part of 
data collection  and storage.  The plan is overseen  by a four-member  committee  composed  of the principal  
investigators  and a study  coordinator  in Russia.   
 
The data safety and monitoring plan stipulates that a ll records pertaining to the study and all original and 
electronic data files are to be securely stored off -site, in a locked metal file cabinet, accessible only to one of 
the Russian -based principal investigators . This is also true for completed and signed consent forms. To 
ensure participants’ safety and the data’s validity and integrity, only staff with extensive experience in the 
area of HI V/HCV treatment will be hired. All research  staff will receive  training on  data collection , 
management and storage  procedures ( including of survey data and biomarkers ), maintaining  confidentiality , 
and research ethics.  On an ongoing basis, the Russian -based study coordinator will review the data to 
ensure data quality, including checking the range of values, and identifying any inconsistencies in the data. 
No names or other identifying information appears on data documents or in data files. Pen and pencil 
surveys will also contain no identifiers. Only designated staff  will have access to the data at each site. 
Presentations and publications will not disclose the name s of the clinical sites where the research was 
implemented . When the final dataset is made publicl y available, data will not contain identifying information.  
 
The data safety and monitoring plan stipulate s the following data management procedures, as described in 
this protocol: data entry is the responsibility of the study coordinator , who enter s all data onto an Excel 
worksheet. The Excel worksheet includes screening information but not randomi sation information, which is 
kept in a separate password -protected file. Research personnel at two sites in Russia are in charge of 
screening procedures and  administering the paper -based surveys and of collecting the bioma rkers for 
analysis  after randomization . The study coordinator is responsible for  assigning allocations based on trial 
Page  11 of 21 condition assignments  generated in the U.S. All surveys and biomarkers are marked with a  trial identification 
number, assigned by [CONTACT_9137], to ensure anonymity. One person at each study site is 
responsible for  personally delivering the surveys and the biomarkers to the study coordinator. The study 
coordinator extracts information from the paper -based surveys, from medical records , and from lab reports to 
populate the database. The coding used on the general dataset for data entry is based on th e survey: each 
survey item include s numeric codes, and these are used for data entry. The de -identified general database 
will be password protected and shared periodically with researchers in the U.S. for a range of data value 
checks.  
 
 
Confidentiality {27}  
All data collected during the study will be kept strictly confidential and only accessed by [CONTACT_3647], 
unless requested by [CONTACT_183843]’  IRB members  or by [CONTACT_456]. Participants are assigned  a trial 
identification number. Only the study coordinator has the list linking identifying information with the 
identification number; this list is password -protected and stored on her personal computer, also password -
protected. The de -identified dataset will be available to the rest of the research staff,  and after analyses and 
publication of primary findings will be made available to other researchers upon request.  
 
Plans  for collection,  laboratory  evaluation  and storage  of biological  specimens  for 
genetic  or molecular  analysis  in this trial/future  use {33} 
At baseline  and each  follow -up assessment,  women  provide  a urine  sample,  which  is analysed  for EtG at the 
[redacted].  The limit of detection  is >500  nanograms/millilitre  (ng/mL ). In addition,  at the 9-month  follow -up, 
clinicians  collect  dried  blood  spot samples,  which  will be analysed  for PEth  using  U.S. Drug  Testing  
Laboratory  standardized  procedures  (USDTL,  Des Plaines,  IL). The PEth  samples  are analysed  at the 
[redacted]  in Irkutsk,  Russia.  The limit of detection  is 8 ng/mL;  any result  above  this threshold  is considered  
positive  for alcohol  consumption  within  the last [ADDRESS_217062]  the participants’  identity  and stored  at -30 degrees  Celsius  at the main  clinical  site until shipped  to

Statistical  methods  for primary  and secondary  outcomes  {20a}  
We will use an intent -to-treat analysis  and logistic  and linear  generalized  estimating  equations  to evaluate  
intervention  efficacy,  relative  to the standard -of-care,  in enhancing  the proportion  of women  with a 
laboratory -confirmed  negative  EtG over the follow -up period,  thus assessing  whether  there  was a significant  
reduction  in alcohol  use in the intervention  group,  compared  to the control  group.  Given  that there  is no 
consensus  regarding  safe levels  of alcohol  use among  HIV/HCV -infected  individuals46,[ADDRESS_217063] EtG 
negative  (<500 ng/mL)  over the 9-month  follow -up in each  trial condition.  To triage  results  with self-reported  
patterns  of alcohol  use patterns  and EtG, we will also use a novel  alcohol  use biomarker,  PEth  collected  
once  at follow -up. We will conduct  multilevel  regression  analyses  to account  for clustering  effects  at the two 
clinical  sites,  and between - and within -subject  variation.  Following  the conventions  in most  trials,  we will 
model  treatment  differences  as a fixed -effect  and use random  effects  for modelling  the clustering  effects  of 
cohort  and repeated  measures  data.  
 
We will utilize  a similar  analysis  to assess  whether  the intervention  resulted  in differences  in liver disease  
progression  by [CONTACT_183844],  FibroScan,  and whether  the intervention  affected  HIV 
disease  progre ssion  by [CONTACT_183845]4+  levels  between  the two conditions.  
 
Oversight  and monitoring  
Composition  of the coordinating  centre  and trial steering  committee  {5d} 
 
A five-member  steering  committee  was formed , composed  of the principal  investigators  in the U.S. (RJD,  
JLB) and in Russia  (NB, VR) and the Russian -based  study  coordinator  (EB).  The committee’s  role is to 
assess  progress  and ensure  quality  and compliance  with recruitment  and study  procedures.  The committee  
meets  virtually  monthly  to evaluate  project  progress,  review  modifications,  and monitor  compliance  with 
guidelines  from the relevant  institutional  ethics  committees  and The Office  for Human  Research  Protections  
of the U.S. Department  of Health  and Human  Services.  VR supervises  the trial operations  in Russia.  EB is 
the project  coordinator  and oversees  all aspects  of screening,  recruitment,  consent,  and study  protocols  
implementation  at the two study  sites.  EB and LVG are in charge  of the identification,  screening  of potential  
participants  and recruitment.  NBK,  a psychiatrist  with expertise  in treating  patients  with chronic  infectious  
diseases,  interviews  and administers  the survey  to participants . EB and LVG are in charge  of collecting  the 
biomarkers.  The Russian  team  (NB, VR, EB, LVG and NKB)  hold coordination  meetings  weekly.   
 
Composition  of the data monitoring  committee,  its role and reporting  structure  {21a}  
 
The data monitoring  committee  is composed  of EB, JLB and AC. The role of the committee  is to conduct  
quarterly  data checks  to identify  potential  errors . In addition,  the committee  routinely  assess es if proper  
procedures  are in place  to ensure  that data remain  confidential  and that there  are no data breaches.  If any 
problems  are identified,  the data monitoring  committee  informs  members  of the trial steering  committee,  who 
depending  on the type of problem,  file a report  to the respective  IRBs  and/or  the sponsor.  The committee  is 
independent  of the sponsor  and none  of the members  have  competing  interests  to declare.   
 
Adverse  event  reporting  and harms  {22} 
Page  [ADDRESS_217064]  their observations  on comment  cards  that will be reviewed  by [CONTACT_183846].  Should  a serious  adverse  event  occur,  the study  coordinator  will immediately  inform  the 
principal  investigators  who,  in turn, will immediately  notify  [LOCATION_001] University’s  Institutional  Review  Board  
(IRB) . If an adverse  event  appears  to be research -related,  it will be reported  to the Office  for Human  
Research  Protections  of the U.S. Department  of Health  and Human  Services  and the funding  institution  
project  officer,  along  with summaries  of discussions  concerning  the event.  The funding  institution  project  
officer  will be informed  of any IRB action  taken  concerning  any adverse  event.  Research  staff will be 
monitored  closely  by [CONTACT_183847].  Staff deficit s will be addressed  via 
additional  training,  close  monitoring  for proficiency,  and if not adhering  to established  protocols  and 
procedures,  will be terminated.   
 
Frequency  and plans  for auditing  trial conduct  {23} 
The principal  investigators  will conduct  semi -annual  field visits  to assess  that procedures  are being  
implemented  as planned  at all sites.  These  audits  are independent  of the sponsor  and will entail  observation  
of data collection  efforts.  The trial steering  committee  meets  monthly  to assess  progress.  Any issues  
identified  during  semi -annual  field visits  or during  weekly  meeting s of the Russian -based  field team  will be 
immediately  reported  to the trial steering  committee  for a full investigation.  In addition,  members  of the data 
monitoring  committee  will meet  every  six-months  to conduct  data checks.  Ad hoc emergency  meetings  of the 
committee  will be called  if a data breach  or data errors  are identified.  
 
Plans  for communicating  important  protocol  amendments  to relevant  parties  (e.g., 
trial participants,  ethical  committees)  {25} 
Changes  to the proposed  protocol  will require  a re-submission  to the IRB of both institutions  and updates  to 
the trial registry.  If changes  to the protocol  are different  from what  was explain  to participants  during  consent,  
participants  will be duly informed  of the modifications  and re-consented  by [CONTACT_183848].   
 
Dissemination  plans  {31a}  
Trial results  will be shared  in peer-reviewed , open -access  publications  and at national  and international  
research  and policy  conferences.  The final data set will be available  through  an open  access  data repository.  
 
Discussion  
If efficacious  in reducing  alcohol  use, this brief computer -delivered  intervention  for alcohol  using  HIV/HCV  
co-infected  women  in Russia  would  have  several  advantages.  First,  the computer -based  platform  affords  
Page  14 of 21 participants  greater  confidentiality,  thus encouraging  participants  to set realistic  goals  without  perceiving  
pressure  from healthcare  providers.  The digital  platform  offers  greater  flexibility  of administration,  for 
example,  participants  can go through  the program  at their own pace.  Importantly,  the participants’  ability  to 
replay  segments  of the intervention  as needed  may reinforce  risk reduction  by [CONTACT_183849].  
 
The proposed  intervention  is novel  in several  ways.  First,  it is delivered  through  a computer -based  platform.  
Computer -delivered  alcohol  reduction  interventions  effectively  reduce  problematic  alcohol  use, albeit  with 
small  effect  sizes,29,[ADDRESS_217065],  the study  collects  two alcohol  use biomarkers  to assess  intervention  efficacy,  rather  than 
relying  on self-report,  which  is prone  to reporting  biases.  Data  from a previous  study  with this population  
indicated  that alcohol  use was often  underreported.49 It will also utilize  objective  markers  of liver function  and 
HIV and HCV  disease  progression.   
 
As the HIV and HCV  epi[INVESTIGATOR_183829],  increasing  the number  of people  in care,  the computerized  
intervention  program  may allow  for more  patients  to receive  critical  messages  related  to alcohol  use while  
reducing  the burden  on trained  healthcare  providers  in an already  heavily  demanding  clinical  care setting.  A 
computer -based  intervention  may be as or more  efficacious  (the objective  of this trial is to assess  efficacy  
relative  to the standard  of care)  than other  service  delivery  modalities  but less labour  intensive  and less 
costly  to implement  and sustain.  Because  of the ubiquity  and affordability  of Wi-Fi and portable  technology  in 
clinical  care settings  in Russia  and the limited  demand  of the intervention  on healthcare  providers’  time,  this 
computer -based  intervention  may be a feasible  and cost-effective  option  for scale -up and dissemination  to 
other  HIV centres  in Russia,  and even  to different  clinical  settings  where  alcohol  use may be problematic,  
such  as at obstetrician -gynaecologist  clinics  and maternity  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].  If efficacious,  the intervention  may be a 
feasible  and cost-effective  way to reach  women  with problematic  drinking  patterns  at point -of-care and to 
integrate  an alcohol  use intervention  into comprehensive  HIV-delivery  services.  
 
Trial  status  
All women  have  completed  the baseline  assessment  and we are currently  working  on scheduling  women  for 
follow -up assessments . The protocol  is version  number  6, dated  October  29, 2019.  Recruitment  began  in 
January  [ADDRESS_217066] patient  visit. No significant  modifications  were  made  to the protocol  following  
the end of recruitment.

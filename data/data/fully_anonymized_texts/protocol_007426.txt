 1 OBJECTIVES 
1.1 Primary Objective 
• To examine the safety and tolerability  profile of the combination of rintatolimod, celecoxib 
± interferon alpha -2b, when given as CKM along with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant 
setting in early stage triple negative breast cancer  
• To identify the appropriate dose level of CKM and paclitaxel for future clinical exploration.  
1.2 Secondary Objectives  
• Evaluate  the effect of neoadjuvant CKM + paclitaxel on pathological response and breast 
MRI response  in early stage triple negative breast cancer patients .  
• Evaluate the  overall and recurrence -free survival in  early stage triple negative breast cancer  
patients that received neoadjuvant CKM + paclitaxel . 
1.3 Exploratory Objectives  
• To evaluate longitudinal changes of blood biomarkers such as peripheral T -cell subsets, 
myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC), expression of chemokine  and other immune 
genes, circulating immune mediators  and correlate them with the clinical course post -
surgery. 
• Comparison of response assessment criteria for a prospective analysis  using RECIST 1.1 . 
(Appendix F) and irRECIST (Appendix G) 
• Evalua te changes in the intratumoral levels of biomarkers, such as, peripheral T -cell 
subsets, myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC), chemokines, and immune -regulatory 
factors (pre - vs post -CKM + paclitaxel treatment).  
[ADDRESS_727146] cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer -related morbidity worldwide (1). 
Approximately 20% of women diagnosed with early breast cancer ( EBC ) will experience 
recurre nce at a distant site  within 10  years (2). One key challenge is that breast cancer is a 
heterogeneous disease that is categorized clinically by [CONTACT_246115] (IHC) staining of the 
three receptors:  estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and the human epi[INVESTIGATOR_33927] -2 (ERBB2/HER2) (3 ). Seminal studies in the early 2000s demonstrated that 
gene expression signatures could classify breast cancers into distinct and reproducible molecular 
subgroups (4). In essence, breast cancer can be molecularly classified into luminal A and luminal 
B subgroups that are mostly comprised of hormone -receptor positive (HR+) breast cancers; a 
basal -like subgroup that is mostly comprised of triple -negative breast cancers (TNBC); a HER2 -
enriched subgroup that is mostly comprised of HER2 + breast cancers and a normal -like subgroup 
that has been proposed to be mostly comprised of the contaminating tumor -surrounding stroma 
(5).

 expression (6 ). Although it is generally more chemosensitive than other types of breast cancer, it 
is also characterized  to harbor  the most aggressive behavior  with the front -loaded risk of relapse 
within the first 3 –5 years after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy and its prevalence in young er 
women (7). Once metastasized , TNBC has a high predisposition to involve the critical visceral 
organs such as lung, liver and brain, eventually leading to a significantly shorter median overall 
survival than in other subtypes (8). Therefore, developi[INVESTIGATOR_553341] t herapeutic strategies for the 
treatment of early TNBC is crucial to alleviate the burden of TNBC.  
Neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy remains a key component of systemic treatment in early TNBC, which is determined primarily by [CONTACT_553362] (9). Neoadjuvant and 
adjuvant chemotherapy are the standard systemic treatment for early TNBC, and anthracycline and taxane-based chemotherapy regimens compris e the current standard of care (10). In previous 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_553342], patients with TNBC showed significantly higher response rates to anthracycline and taxane-based chemotherapy than those of other subtypes . The pathological 
complete response (pCR) observed in triple negative breast cancer after anthracycline and taxane 
based chemotherapy is around 26%  (11). Moreover, as pCR showed a significant correlation with 
therapeutic benefits, it has been established as a robust surrogate biomarker for long -term survival 
outcomes (8). Although the guideline for adjuvant che motherapy is generally similar for each 
breast cancer subtype, adjuvant chemotherapy in TNBC is recommended for primary tumor s larger 
than 0.5 cm due to their aggressive behavior (12). Regarding the paradox that TNBC carries both 
higher chemosensitivity and the risk of early r elapse, efforts have been continued to develop more 
effective chemotherapeutic regimens for both responders and non-responders. Clinical trials of 
newer combinations and dose -determination studies that evaluated metronomic or dose -dense 
regimens suggested the feasibility of refining conventional chemotherapy (13). 
More re cently, patients with an initially high tumor  burden or residual disease after neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy were identified as compelling candidates for intensive systemic treatment, as they 
carry higher chance of relapse and metastatic spread. The CREATE -X tr ial demonstrated the 
potential survival benefit of adding capecitabine to the standard adjuvant chemotherapy regimen 
in early TNBC with a residual tumor  burden after neoadjuvant treatment (14). A meta -analysis 
also provided a rationale for adding capecitabine to either neoadjuvant or adjuvant standard 
chemotherapy in patients with TNBC (15). The role of platinum based chemotherapy has also been 
suggested in the neoadjuvant setting in early stage triple negative breast cancer. In the CALGB  
[ZIP_CODE] trial (16), the pCR rate was significantly improved from 41% to 54%, in patients who 
received neoadjuvant chemotherapy combining carboplatin and/or bevacizumab with paclit axel 
followed by [CONTACT_2715] -dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (ddAC). The GeparSixto trial (17 ) 
similarly showed significantly enhanced pCR rates from 36.9% to 53.2% by [CONTACT_553363] -based chemotherapy with bevacizumab. In their recent 
secondary analysis, treatment benefit was  consistently maintained even in patients without  
BRCA1/2 mutations (18). There has been recent interest in immunotherapy in triple negative 
breast cancer. Due to its genomic instability and high mutational burden, tumour microenvironment of TNBC is considered to be ‘hot’ with abundant infiltrating immune cells, 
which are acti vely engaged in the process of ‘immunoediting’ (19). TILs, mainly the CD8
+ T cells, 
are the most famous immune -related player in breast cancer (20). In TNBC treated with 
neoadjuvant treatment, TILs was identified as a robust predictive biomarker of long -term survival 
and its significance in remn ant disease was subsequently validated (21) revealing an active 
communication between immune system and cytotoxic agents. Correlation between TILs and

 programmed cell death 1/ligand 1 (PD -1/PD -L1) expression was suggested in recent experiments, 
which assumed the existence of a feedback loop regulat ing PD -L1 expression as a means of 
immune homeostasis. Several retrospective studies of early TNBC demonstrated significantly 
worse survival outcomes in patients harboring high PD -L1 expression and a low number of TILs 
or a high ratio of PD -L1/CD8 expressi on (22). TILs play a significant role in orchestrating the 
immune microenvironment and vigorously interact with cytotoxic signals including both 
chemotherapy and immunotherapy (23). 
Clinical trials have shown the efficacy of immunotherapy in the neoadjuvant se tting. In early 
TNBC, preliminary results from the neoadjuvant I -SPY 2 trial demonstrated that pCR rates 
increased from 22.3% to 62.4% by [CONTACT_553364]-based chemotherapy, which represents an appro ximately 40% improvement in pCR 
compared with standard chemotherapy alone (24). The KEYNOTE -173 trial also showed a 
remarkably increased pCR rate from 60% to 90% in high-risk patients by [CONTACT_553365]’s discretion (25). Since improvement in pathological CR is a surrogate marker for efficacy, hence, 
there is increasing interest in performing clinical trials combining novel agents in the neoadjuvant setting in triple  negative breast cancer  in order to attain a higher pathological complete response . 
2.1 Pre-clinical Studies with Chemokine Modulation 
The chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR5 are typi[INVESTIGATOR_553343]. 
High tumor production of CCL5/RA NTES (ligand for CCR5) and CXCL9/MIG, CXCL10/IP10, 
and CXCL11/ITAC (three known ligands for CXCR3) is associated with high CTL infiltration in 
different cancer types (26-28). Our previous correlative and mechanistic studies in other cancer 
types (29-31) showed the critical roles of intratumoral production of CCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10 
in local infiltration with CD8
+ GrB+ CTLs, while CCL22 was found responsible for the attraction 
of FOXP3+ Tregs.  
Combinatorial adjuvants: Synergistic and selective induction of CTL -attracting chemokines 
and suppression of Treg attractants:  In an attempt to correct the deficit in local produc tion of 
CXCR3 and CCR5 ligands seen in many cancer lesions, we compared the ability of toll like receptor (TLR) ligands and cytokines to induce different classes of chemokines. Although TLR3 
ligands, such as poly-I: C  were relatively ineffective when used alone and induced a significant 
production of Treg -attracting CCL22 (MDC; CCR4 ligand; Fig. 1), the combination TLR3 -L with 
IFNα (and especially with IFNα and COX2 blockers), resulted in a strong synergy in selective 
induction of CXCR3 and CCR5 ligands, with concomitant suppression of CCL22.

Studies completed within our NCI -funded program 1P01CA132714 “Directing Tumor -Specific T 
Cells to Tumors” identified TLR3 ligands, poly -I:C (double -stranded RNA; a molecular mimic of 
viral infections and activator TLR3 and RIG -I/MDA5 helicases) and its der ivative,  rintatolimod, 
a selective TLR3 ligand, which does not activate helicases and shows improved pattern of TME 
activation, with enhanced safety profile for systemic (i.v.) use, as preferred adjuvants which 
preferentially induce the CTL-/Th1/NK cells -attracting chemokines (29-33) and direct selective 
CTL accumulation in TMEs (29-31 ).  Furthermore, the combination of rintatolimod (or poly -I: C) 
with IFNα and COX2 blockers (to enhance TLR3 signals and abrogate negative aspects of 
inflammation) are 10 - to 100 -fold more effective than each of these factors alone in inducing CTL 
attractants, and eliminates Treg attraction (29-31). Such combinatorial chemokine -modulating 
regimen (CKM) acts in tumor -selective fashion, avoiding activation of healthy tissues (29), and 
abrogates the heterogeneity of different tumor lesions (29), converting all “cold” tumors into 
inflamed ones (29 -31). 
2.2 Pre-clinical Studies with Chemokine Modula tion and Chemotherapy  
As discussed in the previous section, high tumor production of CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 is associated with cytotoxic T-cell infiltration into the different cancer types. Thus, 
intratumoral production of CCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10  is necessary for infiltration with CD8+ 
cytotoxic T cells, while, CCL22 production is responsible for attraction of FOXP3+ Tregs. 
Treatment of perfused liver tumors with chemotherapy (melphalan) results in production of Treg 
chemokines CCL22 which attracts  the T regulatory cells, however, when melanoma models are 
treated ex -vivo with combination of celecoxib, IFN -alpha and po ly-I:C, the production of CCL22 
is significantly decreased, hence, supporting the hypothesis that combination of chemokine 
modulation with chemotherapy will result in reversal of the immunosuppressive effects of 
chemotherapy and potentiation of tumor infiltration with cytotoxic T-lymphocytes.

2.4 Clinical Studies with Chemokine Modulation and Chemotherapy  
In addition to the evaluation of rintatolimod, interferon a lpha-2b and celecoxib administered i.v. 
for one course over 5 days, as a stand-alone treatmen t, the same combinations (but different 
administration regimens) are being evaluated as a part of combinatorial regimens in additional 
patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis  treated with HIPEC  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] / UPCI 12-110) and 
recurrent ovarian cancer (NCT0 2432378 / UPCI 11-128). Clinical trial [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] (over 50 
de-bulked and HIPEC -pretreated patients evaluated so far) involve multiple cycles of DC vaccines 
follow ed by 4 day long cycles of IFN - α /celecoxib regimen, with rintatolimod administere d on 
days 2 and 4 of each cycle. Clinical trial [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] (5 patients evaluated so far) involve 
multiple cycles of intraperitoneal (i.p.) chemotherapy followed (with 1 day delay) by [CONTACT_25505] i.p. 
doses of rintatolimod with increasing i.p. doses of IFN -α and a standard dose of celecoxib (orally).

uniformly well tolerated . 
2.[ADDRESS_727148] cancer, with pCR of about 30%. CKM will result in production of chemokines which would attract CD8+ T 
cells and decrease production of chemokines which favor immunosuppressive T regulatory cells, and hence, result in increased local infiltration of CD8+ T cells and hence, create an immu nogenic 
environment as show in Figure 1. We hypothesize that higher number of CD8+ T -cells will result 
in increased efficacy of paclitaxel. Chemokine modulation, which we hypothesize from prior 
preclinical and clinical data, stimulates infiltration of the tumor by T -cells resulting in anti-tumor 
efficacy. Our hypothesis is that the combination will result in higher tumor infiltration with cytotoxic T -cells, resulting in an improvement in pCR which is considered a surrogate marker for 
survival . 
2.6 Planned Corre lative Studies  
Tumor tissue, blood and serum samples will be evaluated for evidence of immune modulation and 
anti-cancer activi ty. Cytokine panel will be compared to pre -treatment samples and we will 
evaluate the T cell circulating component.  
In addition, to identify responders vs. non-responders, we will also perform a biopsy after the 
patient has received 3 doses of CKM + paclitaxel combination therapy .

 • Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival ( OS) will also be assessed. RFS is 
defined as local/regional invasive recurrence, invasive ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence, 
distant recurrence, inoperable (meaning no surgery because of progression), and/or death 
from breast cancer  (per standard of care according to physician discretion) . RFS will be 
calculated from the time of treatment to event. OS is defined by [CONTACT_553367], non-breast cancer, unknown, or any other cause and will be calculated from the time of study entry to event.  
8.3 Exploratory Endpoints  
• To evaluate longitudinal changes of blood biomarkers such as peripheral T -cell subsets, 
myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC), expression of chemokine and other immune genes  and, circulating immune mediators . 
• Correlate each of the above markers and their change over treatment with the clinical course of the disease post -surgery.  
• Comparison of response assessment criteria for a prospective analysis using RECIST 1.1. (Appendix F) and irRECIST (Appendix G). 
• Comparing the effect of the neoadjuvant treatment (pre vs post -3 doses of CKM + 
paclitaxel treatment) on immune cells [tumor -infiltrating T cell subtypes, Teff/Treg ratios, 
CD11b+ MDSC; the expression of chemokine receptors (CCR2, CCR5, CCR4, CCR6, CXCR3, and CXCR4) and immune checkpoint molecules (PD -1, PD -L1/2, VISTA, 
CTLA -4, LAG3 and TIM3)] using RT -PCR, immunofluorescence (IF) and 
immunohistochemistry (IHC); local expression of Teff -attracting chemokines (CCR5, 
CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11) and Treg/MDSC -favoring chemokines (CCL2, CCL22 
and CXCL12) using IF and RT -PCR; RNA assays and micr oscopy, RT -PCR for COX -2 
expression, IDO, IL -10, arginase and iNOS and, RNA signatures of groups of immune -
regulatory genes that are modulated by [CONTACT_553368]. Similar markers and additional soluble and cell -associated mediators may be evaluated in the circulating immune cells and 
in patients’ sera. Exact scope of the above testing depends on available funding.  Fresh or 
archival tissue from pre -, post -treatment biopsies and surgery could be used for additional 
correlative studies. The correlative studies  would include multispectral IHC/IF analysis of 
the immune cell phenotypes and their activation /exhaustion status as well as gene expression based methods (using e.g., RNA seq) to define genes and pathways significantly altered upon CKM regiment and  multi-gene  signatures of the response and resistance.    
9 DESIGN 
Depending on the patient’s clinical course, active treatment is expected to be approximately 22 -27 
weeks.  Based on the I -SPY (investigation of serial studies to predict your therapeutic response 
with imaging and molecular analysis) design where new investigational agents are studied in combination with paclitaxel in the neoadjuvant setting, in our study, pati ents will be treated with 
weekly doses of paclitaxel first.  
In this Phase I study design each eligible patient will receive breast MRI per standard of care. 
Eligible patients will be treated with paclitaxel, TLR3 agonist ( rintatolimod) 200 mg IV for days 
1-3 and COX -2 inhibitor (celecoxib) 200 mg oral twice daily for days 1-3 at fixed doses and

diameter and volume will be measured at each time point and will be used for early evaluation of response. This will be followed by 4 cycles of dose -dense doxorubicin/cyclophosph amide 
treatment every 2 weeks. The current study design to reverse the sequence of chemotherap y is 
based on the I -SPY tr ial (Investigation of Serial Studies to Pre dict Your Therapeutic Response 
with Imaging a nd Molecular Analysis) where novel agents are studied in addition to paclitaxel 
followed by [CONTACT_553370]. Surgery will occur 3-6 weeks after completion of chemotherapy.  Pathological CR is assessed at surgery about 6 months after the 
treatment is initiated. Waiting until each participant’s outcome has been assessed is less than ideal. Hence, to obtain earlier information about the response , MRI measurements will be performed 
longitudinally starting at baseline, end of treatment with paclitaxel, and end of anthracycline treatment  for D ose Level 4.  These measurements are not predictive of pCR, but they do correlate 
with it as shown in I -SPY 1 . 
Patients will be monitored for dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) throughout the dose – escalation 
portion of the study. Refer to Section 10.5.

 10 TREATMENT 
10.1 Dosing and Administration 
Treatment is intended for an outpatient setting. However, at the investigator’s/physician’s 
discretion , the participant may receive treatment as an inpatient, if deemed necessary . 
10.2 Dose Escalation  
A dose escalation phase will be carried out to assess the safety and tolerability of CKM when given 
in combination with paclitaxel. During the dose escalation phase, subjects will receive p aclitaxel 
in combination with CKM (CKM to be given during weeks 1-3), followed by [CONTACT_553371].  Refer to  Figure 5. 
Escalation will proceed according to the rules described in Section 19.4.

10.5 Dose Modifications and Treatment Delays  
Day 1 of each CKM dose may be delayed by 1 day for any reason (i.e.  patient tolerance, etc.). In 
this instance, CKM doses will be moved to days 2-4 instead of days 1-3.  
For patient tolerance and toxicities, if dose modifications are needed during the DLT period, this 
will be discussed with the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_44200]. With the exception of delaying day 1 of each CKM dose by 1 day, any other dose delays if needed for toxicity m anagement will need 
to be discussed with the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_30496]. After the DLT period, chemotherapy 
(paclitaxel, doxorubicin or cyclophosphamide) may be dose modified  or delayed  per physician 
discretion . If toxicities are observed, based on investigator discretion and the common side 
effects of the study drug and standard of care, attribution will be made to the study drug or 
paclitaxel. Dose reductions for study drugs are mentioned in Section 10.5.2. Study drug will be 
dose -reduced first if attrib ution unclear between study drug and paclitaxel. If study drugs are 
dose -reduced, one drug will be dose reduced first  depending on which drug is most likely 
associated with the toxicity . We are considering DLT period as the first [ADDRESS_727172] the DLT period. The toxicities for all the patients will 
be monitored for additional 3 months after completing the combination treatment with special 
attention to immune related toxicities.   
 If a DLT attributa ble to CKM causing delay in paclitaxel or AC dosing greater than 21 days or a 
cumula tive delay of >[ADDRESS_727173] 3 weeks , patients will be 
permanently discontinued from protocol therapy. Any of the above situations would cause a hold 
to the trial and reassessment of trial continuation.

10.5.3  CKM Toxicity Management  
The toxicity of high dose interferon (20 million units/ m²/d) has been established by [CONTACT_553372] a number of trials. Most notable was the E1684 trial (34) where high dose interferon 
(20 million units/ m²/d) was administered daily for 5 days x 4 weeks. In that trial (n=143), grade 3 
toxicities were 67%, grade 4 toxicities were 9% (mainly constitutional and neurologic), and there 
were 2 treatment related mortalities (grade 5) due to hepato toxicity. The proportion of Grade 3 and 
4 toxicities in that trial were 48.2% for constitutional toxicities (defined as ‘worst grade of any 
constitutional toxicity, including fever, chills, flu -like symptoms, fatigue, malaise, and 
diaphoresis), and 66% for non-constitutional toxicities (23.8% for myelosuppre ssion, 13.9% for 
hepatotoxicity, 28% for neurological toxicity).  
While the combination of high dose interferon  and rintatolimod may lead to synergistic additive 
side effects, we will monitor subject toxicities for unexpected increases in constitutional symptoms, myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity, and neurological toxicity. Moreover, the presence 
of celecoxib may improve the side effect profile. Our strategy is to continuously monitor treatment related occurrences of constitutional symptoms (including fever, chills, flu -like symptoms, fatigue, 
malaise, or diaphoresis) . 
These are suggestions for specific toxicities and may be modified for institutional guidelines and 
treating physician preference.  
Gastrointestinal Toxicity  
• Nausea and/or vomiting should be contr olled with adequate antiemetic therapy. 
Prophylactic antiemetic therapy can be used at the discretion of the investigator/sub -
investigator. Subjects are encouraged to take plenty of oral fluids.

 • Diarrhea should be managed with appropriate antidiarrheal therapy. Subjects should be 
encouraged to take plenty of oral fluids. If symptoms do not decrease to grade 1 or less 
with adequate antidiarrheal therapy, all protocol drugs should be held until resolved to < 
grade 1.  
Pain/Fever/Chills / Flu -like Symptoms  
• For chills and/or fever or mild local pain, acetaminophen will be utilized at the discretion 
of the investigator/sub -investigator or designee.  NSAIDs will be avoided.  
Note : Any patient developi[INVESTIGATOR_553346], cough, dyspnea, or other respi[INVESTIGATOR_553347] e a 
chest X -ray taken. If the chest X -ray shows pulmonary infiltrates or there is evidence of pulmonary 
function impairment, the patient should be closely monitored, and, if appropriate, interferon alpha treatment should be discontinued.  
While fever may be related to the flu -like syndrome reported commonly in patients treated with 
interferon, other causes of persistent fever should be ruled out.  
Hypersensitivity Reactions  
Caution: Subjects who had a mild to moderate hypersensitivity reaction have been succe ssfully re -
challenged, but careful attention to prophylaxis and bedside monitoring of vital signs is recommended. Hypersensitivity reactions to interferon a lpha-2b and/or rintatolimod will be 
managed as follows:  
• Mild symptoms (e.g., mild flushing, rash, pr uritus): Complete infusion. Supervise at 
bedside. No treatment required.  
• Moderate symptoms (e.g., moderate rash, flushing, mild dyspnea, chest discomfort): Stop infusion. Give intravenous diphenhydramine 50 mg and intravenous famotidine 20 mg. 
Resume infus ion after recovery of symptoms at a 66% slower rate, then, if no further 
symptoms, rat e can be titrated up every [ADDRESS_727175] infusion rate stop the infusion and no further interferon a lpha-
2b administered on that day. If symptoms recur after the rate has been increased, stop the 
infusion, treat reaction as per institutional guidelines, consider dexamethasone 20 mg IV 
and restart at 66% slower rate (over 1 hour) without up-titration . Futur e doses pre -treatment 
modifications and rate modification after discussion with the investigator. Record toxicity.  
• Severe life threatening symptoms (e.g., hypotension requiring pressor therapy, angioedema, respi[INVESTIGATOR_553348], generalized urticaria): 
Stop infusion. Treat as  per institutional guidelines. Subject should be removed from further 
protocol therapy. Report as serious adverse event.  
Ophthalmologic Disorders  
Decrease or loss of vision, retinopathy including macular  edema, retinal artery or vein thrombosis, 
retinal hemorrhages and cotton wool spots; optic neuritis, papi[INVESTIGATOR_044], and serous retinal detachment may be induced or aggravated by [CONTACT_553373] -2b or other alpha

12 WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS  
12.1 Treatment Discontinuation  
Upon treatment discontinuation , all end of treatment evaluations and tests will be conducted. The 
reason for treatment discontinuation will be documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF). 
All participants who discontinue due to an AE must be followed until the event resolves or 
stabilizes. Appropriate medical care should be provided until signs and symptoms have abated, 
stabilized, or until abnormal laboratory findings have returned to acceptable or pre -study limits. 
The final status of the AE will be reported in the participant’s medical records and the appropriate 
eCRF. 
Reasons for treatment discontinuation should be classified as follows: 
• Death  
• Toxicity; treatment related or unrelated  
• Investigator judgment  
o The Investigator may discontinue a participant if, in his/her judgment, it is in the 
best interest of the participant to do so.  
• Noncompliance  
• Participant voluntary withdrawal  
o A participant may withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason. If a 
participant discontinues treatment, an a ttempt should be made to obtain information 
regarding the reason for withdrawal.

 13.4 Celecoxib  
Prolonged use of celecoxib may cause dyspepsia, headaches (including migraines) and borderline 
elevated liver function tests (which could indicate liver damage). Recently, in formation from three 
long-term studies of celecoxib has become available. In the first study, a cancer prevention study, 
an increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, and/or deaths resulting from heart or blood vessel disease 
was reported among people taking celecoxib. Approximately [ADDRESS_727179] s taking celecoxib (between 400  and 800 mg daily) had one of these serious event s. 
Another clinical cancer prevention study found no increased risks i n subjects taking celecoxib 
[ADDRESS_727180] study, an Alzheimer's disease prevention study, did not find increased 
risks with celecoxib. Dosing has been suspended in all three of  these studies based on the finding s 
of the first cancer prevention study. As a result,  the FDA is now evaluating the possibility that 
celecoxib increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, and or death resulting from heart or blood vessel 
disease. Known in frequent side effects of celecoxib include nausea and/or vomiting, diarrhea, 
flatulence, abdominal and stomach pain, bleeding ulcer, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], 
pharyngitis, rhinitis, sinusitis, peripheral edema, back pain, dizziness, insomnia, and skin rash. Rare risks include sudden death (unexpected or instant death that occurs within minutes or hours 
from any cause other than violence), vasculitis, hepatitis, liver failure, kidney failure, blood 
dyscrasia, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, viral meningitis, severe allergic reaction, visual changes, and transient ischemic attack. Warnings/Precautions: Stomach problems may be more likely to occur if patients drink alcoholic beverages while taking this medicine. Taking two or more of the 
nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs together on a regular basis may increase the chance of 
unwanted effects. Also, taking acetaminophen, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_402662], or ketorolac (e.g., 
Toradol) regularly while taking a nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drug may increase the chance of 
unwanted effects. The risk will depend on how much of each medicine is taken every day and how 
long the medicines are taken together. Therefore, patients should not take acetaminophen or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_553354] (e.g., Toradol).  Clinical studies with celecoxib have identified 
potentially significant interactions with fluconazole and lithium. Experience with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) suggests the potential for interactions with furosemide and 
ACE inhibitors. Celecoxib is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to celecoxib. 
Celecoxib should not be given to patients who have demonstrated allergic -type reactions to 
sulfonamides. Celecoxib should not be given to patients who have experienced asthma,  urticaria, 
or allergic -type reactions after taking aspi[INVESTIGATOR_162882]. Severe, rarely fatal, anaphylactic -
like reactions to NSAIDs have been reported in such patients.  
For more risk information reference the Investigator’s Brochure or package insert.  
13.5 Interferon -α2b  
Interferon a lpha-2b may cause fever, chills and flu -like symptoms; loss of appetite; nausea; 
vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain; fatigue; lowered white blood count may increase risk of infection; lowered platelets may lead to an increase in bruising or bleeding; hair loss. Other risks 
which may be common in cases of prolonge d administration of interferon a lpha-2b include 
drowsiness; temporary confusion; anxiety, amnesia, irritability, confusion, delusions and 
depression which can be severe; numbness and/or tingling in the hands and/or feet, skin rashes and 
inflammation of the pancreas. Inflammation of the pancreas is swelling or irritation of the pancreas

50 patients up to two (2) years, and with 20 or more patients over two (2)  years at doses as high as 
1200 mg i.v. twice weekly. No evidence of dose -limiting organ toxicity, including hematologic, 
liver, or renal toxicity, has been observed.  
Adverse events related to infusion such as mild flu-like symptoms, transient headache, fever, 
myalgia, arthralgia, and fatigue/malaise which were seen, usually occur during the initial weeks of treatment and tend to subside on repeated administration. These side events were seen in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome patients, cancer patients, chronic hepatitis B infected patients  and individuals 
infected with HIV at doses of [ADDRESS_727182], which has been 
observed in approximately 10% of patients treated in various studies. Usually the flushing is both 
mild an d transient and disappears with repeated dosing. Occasionally, it can be accompanied by a 
tightness of the chest, tachycardia, anxiety, shortness of breath, subjective reports of "feeling hot", diaphoresis and nausea. The reaction is usually infusion-rate dependent and may generally be 
controlled by [CONTACT_1743]. An antihistamine (diphenhydramine hydrochloride) can be helpful in controlling and reducing the response in the occasional patient for whom the symptom persists. Other less frequently occurring adverse effects include nausea, diarrhea, itching, urticaria, bronchospasm, transient hypotension, photophobia, rash, bradycardia and transient visual 
disturbances. A severe unexpected local reaction to extravasation of rintatolimod (Ampligen
®, 
Poly I: Poly  C12U) at the infusion site in the dorsum of the left hand was reported in a Chronic 
Fatigue Syndrome patient with chilblains. Several patients experienced liver enzyme level

17 SAFETY EVALUATION 
17.1 Adverse Events  
An adverse event or adverse experience (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with 
the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. Therefore, an AE can be ANY 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or diseas e 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product (attribution of ‘unrelated’, ‘unlikely’, 
‘possible’, ‘probable’, or ‘definite’).  
An AE is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at 
the specificity or severity that has been observed; or if an investigator brochure is not required or 
available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan in other study-related documents.  
• Diagnosis Versus Signs and Symptoms  
If known, a diagnosis should be recorded on the CRF rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g.,  record only liver failure or hepatitis rather  than jaundice, asterixis, and 
elevated transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be clinically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each 
individual event should be recorded as an AE or  SAE on the CRF. If a diagnosis is 
subsequently established, it should be reported as follow -up information.  
• Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events  
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g.,  cascade events or clinical 
sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_5252]. For example, if severe diarrhea is 
known to have resulted in dehydration, it is sufficient to record only diarrhea as an AE or SAE on the CRF.   
However, clinically significant AEs occurring secondary to an initiating event that are separated in time should be recorded as independent events on the CRF. For example, if a 
severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be recorded 
separately on the CRF.  
• Abnormal Laboratory Values  
Only clinically significant laboratory abnormalities that require active management will be recorded as AEs or SAEs on the CRF (e.g.,  abnormalities that require study  drug dose 
modification, discontinuation of study treatment, more frequent follow -up assessments, 
further diagnostic investigation, etc.).  
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase a nd bilirubin 5 x the upper limit of normal associated with

 Page 36 of 75 V12 11/05/2020  
 cholecystitis), only the diagnosis (e.g.,  cholecystitis) needs to be recorded on the Adverse 
Event CRF.  
If the clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded as an AE or SAE on the CRF. If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term, the clinical term should be 
recorded as the AE or SAE. For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7  mEq/L 
should be recorded as “hyperkalemia”.  
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should not be repeatedly recorded as AEs or SAEs on the CRF, unless their severity, seriousness, or etiology changes.  
• Preexisting Medical Conditions (Baseline Conditions)  
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study. When recording such events on an Adverse Event CRF , it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting 
condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] (e.g.,  “more frequent 
headaches”).  
17.2  Grading and Reporting Adverse Events  
• Grading and Relationship to Drug  
The descriptions and grading sc ales found in the CTEP Version 5 of the NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) will be utilized for AE reporting. CTEP Version  5 of the CTCAE is identified and located at: 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm
  
AEs not covered by [CONTACT_553379], and documented according to the grading scales  provide d in the CTCAE 
Version 5.  
The relationship of event to study drug will be documented by [CONTACT_73951]:  
Unrelated:  The event is clearly related to other factors such as the participant’s clinical 
state, other therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs administered to the participant.  
Unlikely:  The event is doubtfully related to investigational agent(s). The event was most 
likely related to other factors such as the participant’s clinical state, other therapeutic interventions, or concomitant drugs.  
Possible:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, but could have been produced by [CONTACT_248290]’s clinical state, other therapeutic interventions or concomitant drugs.  
Probable:  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, and follows a known response pattern to the study drug. The event cannot 
be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_248290]’s clinical state, therapeutic 
interventions or concomitant drugs.

 18 DATA MANAGEMENT  AND CONFIDENTIALITY 
18.1 Data Collection  
Full build studies are managed by [CONTACT_404165]. All electronic case report fo rm (eCRF) data are captured for these studies.  
Data management activities are performed using a CTMS system that enables the collection, cleaning and viewing of clinical trial data. CRS data management designs the study -specific 
database and facilitates development by [CONTACT_404166]. Once the database 
design is approved by [CONTACT_737], Statistician, and Clinical Research Coordinator, the 
database is put into production and data entry can begin. Data can be entered and changed only by [CONTACT_356709].  
18.2 Maintenance of Study Documents  
Essential documents will be retained per Roswell Park’s policy for 6  years from the study 
termination date. These documents could be retained for a longer period, however, if required by 
[CONTACT_553380].  
18.3 Revisions to the Protocol  
Roswell Park may make such changes to the protocol as it deems necessary for safety reasons or 
as may be required by [CONTACT_941] U.S. FDA or other regulatory agencies. Revisions will be submitted to the IRB/ERC for written approval before implementation.  
18.4 Termination of the Study  
It is agreed that, for reasonable cause, either the Roswell Park Investigators or the Sponsor, may terminate this stu dy, provided a written notice is submitted within the time period provided for in 
the Clinical Trial Agreement. In addition, Roswell Park may terminate the study at any time upon immediate notice if it believes termination is necessary for the safety of participants enrolled in the study.  Any deaths on the clinical trial deemed related to the study drugs will necessitate trial 
suspension, review and possible termination .

 19.2 Analysis Cohorts 
Analysi s Cohorts:  
Safety Cohort:  All subjects that receive any study treatment will be included in the safety summary.  
Dose Escalation Cohort:  Any subjects who receive study treatment and complete the DLT period 
(or fail to complete the DLT period due to toxicity ) will be included in the dose escalation cohort.  
Patient Replacement : Patients who are unevaluable for DLT (i.e. disease progression prior to 
completion of CKM or patient refusal will be replaced for the primary safety analysis (i.e. 
identification of the  MTD) and efficacy analyses. Patients who fail to complete at least 6 out of 
the 9 planned CKM doses (due to non-DLT related reasons) are not considered evaluable for the 
primary safety analysis and will be replaced. Data from patients who received only a part of the experimental regimen (<6 doses of CKM) may be evaluated in the exploratory manner for 
secondary/exploratory outcomes.  
19.3 Sample Size Determination  
The sample size determination is based on the primary analysis; which evaluates the safety of the 
treatment combination using an accelerated titration design. The exact sample size depends on the 
unknown dose -toxicity relationship. However, based on the number of dose -levels and decision 
rules, no more than [ADDRESS_727191] no more than 6 -9 evaluable subjects to be enrolled.  
19.4 Primary Analysis: Dose Escalation  
The primary objective of this study  is to evaluate safety and identify the appropriate dose level of 
Interfero n alpha -2b in combination with celecoxib, rintatolimod, and p aclitaxel.  
An accelerated titration design will be utilized to identify the appropriate dose -level for a future 
study. A single patient will be enrolled at dose level 1  (no Interferon alpha -2b). If a DLT is 
observed, then the standard 3+[ADDRESS_727192] 3+ [ADDRESS_727193] 3+ [ADDRESS_727194] 3+ 3 
design will be triggered. Otherwise, the study will be deemed complete.  
3+3 Dose Escalation  
As of Amendment 10, the 3+3 dos e escalation design has been triggered at dose level 3 due to a 
treatment delay and dose reduction. An additional n=2 patients will be enrolled at dose level 3. If 1 DLT is observed, then an additional n=3 patients will be enrolled at dose level 3. If DLTs  are 
observed in 0 of 2 or 1 of 5, then n=3 patients will be enrolled at dose level 4 (and standard 3+3 rules will apply). If 2 or more DLTs are observed, then n=2 patients will be enrolled at dose level 2 (and standard 3+3 rules will apply).

19.5 Secondary  and Exploratory Analysis  
The secondary objectives are to evaluate: 1) the immunomodulatory effect of CKM and paclitaxel 
in the tumor microenvironment ; 2) safety of the combination, 3) complete pathological response 
(pCR) and complete breast MRI response after 12 weeks  and, 4) overall and recurrence -free

evaluated using a one -sided, permutation paired t-test abo ut the following hypotheses:  
 𝐻𝐻0: 𝜇𝜇𝑑𝑑= 0 versus 𝐻𝐻𝐴𝐴: 𝜇𝜇𝑑𝑑> 0, 
where 𝜇𝜇𝑑𝑑 is the true mean change in tumor infiltrating CD8+ CTLs. A 90% confidence interval 
about the mean change will be obtained using standard methods. Transformations or non -
parametric methods (i.e. sig test) will be used as appropriate.  
Safety  
All adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), and toxicities will be summarized by [CONTACT_125095] ( overall and related/ unrelated to treatment) and grade using frequencies and relative frequencies.   
Response Assessments 
The response data will be summarized using frequencies and relative frequencies. A 90% 
confidence interval about the true pCR rate will be obtained using Jeffrey’s prior method. The pCR 
rate will be compared to the historic pCR for sta ndard neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone

Additional details on the procedures for receiving, storing and using rintatolimod (Ampligen® ) 
can be found in a separate document entitled “Procedures for Receiving, Storing, and Using Ampligen® (Poly I:Poly C12U) Liquid Solution”.  
The initial administration should begin at a slow rate of infusion (approximately 20 cc/ hour) and 
increase to 40  cc/hour after 30  minutes. Tubing  should be flushed with 30 to 50 mL of normal 
saline solution upon completion.  
32.4.6  Drug Storage and accountability  
Rintatolimod should be stored at 2 to 8°C (36-46°F). 
Drug storage temperature will be maintained and recorded, as applicable.  
32.4.[ADDRESS_727206] be handled as cytotoxic agents and appropriate precautions taken per the institution’s environmentally safe handling procedures. All investigational drugs will be dispensed in accordance with the Investigator’s prescription or written order.  
All products dispensed will be recorded on a product accountability record. Records of product lot numbers and dates received will be entered on a product accountability form. This record will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_1034]’s staff or representative during periodic monitoring visits. It is the 
Investigator’s resp onsibility to ensure that an accurate record of investigational drug issued and 
returned is maintained.  
Used vials (excess drug) will be destroyed according to standard practices after properly accounting for the dispensing. Partially used vials of study drug will not be re -used for other 
participants.  
Under no circumstances will the Investigator supply investigational drug to a third party or allow the investigational drug to be used in a manner other than as directed by [CONTACT_3181].  
In regards to drug r eceipt, accountability and storage, SOP IDS -601 will be followed.

Cytology and Histology 
These techniques can be used to differentiate between parti al responses (PR) and complete 
responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors), where 
known residual benign tumors can remain).  
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appear s or worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is 
mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
Evaluation  of Response  
Response assessments will be performed at the following time points: 
• Prior to start of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide combination, after completion of last 
paclitaxel  treatment  
• Prior to surgery, af ter completion of last dose of doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide

The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of study treatment until the 
end of treatment  or disease progression/recurrence , whichever occurs earlier , taking into account 
any requirement for confirmation. In general, the participant’s best response assignment will 
depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria and will be determined 
by [CONTACT_356703]’s status of target lesions, non -target lesions, and new lesions.  
• Symptomatic Deterioration: Participants with global deterioration of health status requ iring 
discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time, and not related to study treatment or other medical conditions should be reported as progressive disease due to “symptomatic deterioration.” Every effort should be made to 
document objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment due to

treatment include, but is not limited to, symptoms such as:  
• Weight loss >  10% of body weight.  
• Worsening of disease -related symptoms (e.g.,  worsening dyspnea, increasing 
pain/increasing requirement for narcotic analgesics).  
• Decline in performance status of >  1 level on ECOG scale.  
Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation. All baseline evaluations should 
be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than  before the beginning of the treatment.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being followed cannot be  
imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
Clinical Lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥  10 mm diameter as 
assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by 
[CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
Chest x -ray: Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by  [CONTACT_6776]. However, CT is preferable.  
Conventional CT and MRI: This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan 
based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_727216] slice 
thickness greater than 5  mm, the minim um size for a measurable lesion should be twice the 
slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g., for body scans).  
Use of MRI remains a complex issue. MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; however, there are m any image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image 
quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement. Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable 
globally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the sca nning 
sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease. Furthermore, 
as with CT, the modality used at follow -up should be the same as was used at baseline and the 
lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. It is beyond the scope of the 
RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans should be performed with breath -hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a 
method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety 
for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot 
be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next. If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_12153],

 Page 66 of 75 V11 10/19/ [ADDRESS_727217] in selected instances.  
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy: The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation 
is not advised. However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
Tumor Markers: Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a participant to be 
considered in complete clinical response.  
Cytology, Histology: The se techniques can be used to differentiate between partial responses 
(PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such 
as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effec t of 
the treatment) and progressive disease.  
FDG -PET: While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm: 
Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of PD based 
on a new lesion.  
No FDG-PET at baseline and a p ositive FDG -PET at follow -up: If the positive FDG -PET at 
follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD. If the positive 
FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional follow -
up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan). If the positive 
FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT that is not 
progre ssing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in cases 
where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring . The use of FDG-PET  in this circumstance should be prospectively described in the protocol 
and supported by [CONTACT_4623] -specific medical literature for the indication. However, it must 
be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.  
Note: A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater 
than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.

Response Criteria: irRECIST, Ann Oncol, 25 (suppl 4): iv369  doi:10.1093/annonc/mdu342.23 
(35). 
1. Baseline  
A. Measurable Lesion Definitions and Target Lesion Selection  
• Follow the definitions from RECIST 1.1  
• Measurable lesions must be accurately measured in at least one dimension with a 
minimum size of: 
o [ADDRESS_727218] or MRI scan (or no less than double the slice thickness) for non- nodal lesions and ≥ [ADDRESS_727219] X -ray 
B. Non-measurable Lesion Definitions  
• Follow the definitions from RECIST 1.1  
• Non-target lesions will include  
o Measurable lesions not selected as target lesions  
o All sites of non -measurable disease, such as neoplastic masses that are too small 
to measure because their longest uninterrupted diameter is <  10 mm (or <  two 
times the axial slice thickness), i.e., the longest perpendicular diameter is ≥  10 
and <  [ADDRESS_727220] disease, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, cystic lesions, ill-defined abdominal masses , skin lesions, etc.  
C. Target and Non -target Lymph Node Lesion Definitions

 Page 68 of 75 V11 10/19/ 2020 • All lesions or sites of disease not recorded as target lesions should be recorded as non -
target lesions at bas eline. There is no limit to the number of non -target lesions that can 
be recorded at baseline.  
E. Bone Lesions  
• Follow the definitions from RECIST 1.1  
• Regardless of the imaging modality blastic bone lesions will not be selected as target 
lesions. Lytic or mixed lytic -blastic lesions with a measurable soft tissue component 
≥ 10 mm can be selected as target lesions.  
F. Brain Lesions  
• Brain Lesions detected on brain scans can be considered as both target or non-target lesions.  
G. Cystic and Necrotic Lesions as T arget Lesions  
• Lesions that are partially cystic or necrotic can be selected as target lesions.  
• The longest diameter of such a lesion will be added to the Total Measured Tumor Burden (TMTB) of all target lesions at baseline.  
• If other lesions with a non-liquid/non -necrotic component are present, those should be 
preferred. 
H. Lesions with Prior Local Treatment  
• During target lesion selection the radiologist will consider information on the anatomical sites of previous intervention (e.g. previous irradiation, RF -ablation, TACE, 
surgery, etc.).  
• Lesions undergoing prior intervention will not be selected as  target lesions unless there 
has been a demonstration of progress in the lesion.  
I. No Disease at Baseline  
• If a patient has no measurable and no non-measurable disease at baseline the radiologist 
will assign ‘No Disease’ (irND) as the overall tumor assessm ent for any available 
follow -up time -points unless new measurable lesions are identified and contribute to 
the TMTB.

 Page 69 of 75 V11 10/19/ 2020 • The longest diameters of non-nodal target and new non-nodal meas urable lesions, and 
short axes of nodal target and new nodal measurable lesions will be recorded. Together 
they determine the Total Measured Tumor Burden (TMTB) at follow -up. 
B. Definition of New Measurable Lesions  
• In order to be selected as new measurable lesions (≤  2 lesions per organ, ≤  5 lesions 
total, per time -point), new lesions must meet criteria as defined for baseline target 
lesion selection and meet the same minimum size requirements of [ADDRESS_727221] lesions shall be selected as new measured lesions.  
C. Non -target Lesion Assessment  
• The RECIST 1.1 definitions for the assessment of non -target lesions apply.  
• The response of non-target lesions primarily contributes to the overall response assessments of irCR and irNon -CR/Non-PD (irNN).  
• Non-target lesions do not affect irPR and irSD assessments.  
• Only a massive and unequivocal worsening of non-target lesions alone, even without progress in the TMTB is indicative of irPD.  
D. New Non -Measurable Lesions Definition and Assessment  
• All new lesions not selected as new measurable lesions are considered new non -
measurable lesions and are followed qualitatively.  
• Only a massive and unequivocal progression of new non-measurable lesions leads to 
an overall assessment of irPD for the time -point.  
• Persisting new non- measurable lesions prevent irCR.  
3. irRECIST Overall Tumor Assessments 
• irCR : complete disappearance of all measurable and non -measurable lesions. Lymph 
nodes must decrease to < 10 mm in short axis. Confirmation of response is not mandatory.  
• irPR : decrease of ≥ 30% in TMTB relative to baseline, non -target lesions are irNN, and 
no unequivocal  progression of new non -measurable lesions.  
• irSD : failure to meet criteria for irCR or irPR in the absence of irPD.  
• irNN : no target disease was identified at baseline and at follow -up the patient fails to meet 
criteria for irCR or irPD.

12 Day 1 , 2, or 3  of each CKM dose may be delayed by 1 day for any reason (i.e. patient tolerance, etc. ) In this instance, all 
CKM doses and corresponding assessments will be moved to days 2-4 instead of days 1-3 . In the event that an assessment  
or labs  was already performed on day 1 of that week, it does not need to be repeated on day 2 unless specifically indicated 
by [CONTACT_093] . For example, if physical exam or labs was completed on day 1 and CKM start was delayed to day 2, the 
physical exam or labs does not need to be repeated.

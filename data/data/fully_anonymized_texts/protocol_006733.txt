2. Background a. 
Scientific Background  
Patients are Increasingly Complex: The aging of the US population coupled with better disease 
prevention and treatment efficacy means that more patients are living with multiple comorbidities that 
require complicated medical regimens.1,[ADDRESS_410101] lower health -related quality of life.

KPNC IRB  Version: 06/22/[ADDRESS_410102] More to Do: In parallel with increasing patient complexity, there has been a substantial 
rise in guidelines and quality metrics that primary care providers (PCPs) must address at each visit.12,13 
For example, the number of tasks addressed during a typi[INVESTIGATOR_331490] 5.4 in 1997 to 7.1 in 2005 (p<0.001).
12 Ostbye et al estimated it would require up to 10.6 hours per day for a primary 
care physician (PCP) to deliver high quality care for a typi[INVESTIGATOR_331491].
14 This confluence of increasing pat ient complexity and increasing primary 
care tasks despi[INVESTIGATOR_331492] (or even decreasing) visit lengths places significant stress on the traditional primary care visit and creates barriers to productive interactions. 
Without new tools to improve the 
primary care of complex patients, millions of Americans will continue to receive sub- optimal care despi[INVESTIGATOR_331493] .15 
Optimizing care for this growing patient population is a national priority.15,16   
The Solution to Competing Demands is Effective Prioritization: While team care and non -visit based 
interactions are increasingly common for managing complex patients, the primary care visit remains a critical opportunity for patients and providers to directly engage in shared decision making. For patients with multiple concurrent conditions, however, a critical and often underappreciated first step in this process is the decision about which issues to discuss first
. Prior research using videotaped encounter s has 
shown that the first item addressed during the primary care visit receives the bulk of the attention (5 
minutes vs. 1.1 minutes for the next 5 of six total topi[INVESTIGATOR_331494] 15 minute visit).[ADDRESS_410103] important 
negative consequences for complex patients with multiple health -related (and non- health-related) 
concerns. Indeed, other visit content analyses have found that more complex patients are less likely to 
have medication changes compared to less complex patients,[ADDRESS_410104] been associated with a 3 -fold greater difficulty taking medications pres cribed for other 
chronic conditions, and thus addressing a patient’s pain would likely lead to more effective medication 
management for these other conditions.
23 Research by [CONTACT_331496], but the influence of behavioral, emotional, and social factors 
that create substantial barriers to effective clinical care.24,25 
Defining and Aligning Priorities: While it is certain that health issues need to be prioritized, it is less 
clear how to align the potentially different priorities of patient and provider. Physicians are trained to address disease prevention  and risk reduction and evidence suggests that their priorities may be 
influenced by [CONTACT_331497]. For example, one study found that PCPs may place relatively higher 
priority on lower impact interventions (e.g. microalbuminuria screening) when these are used as performance measures,
[ADDRESS_410105] a high priority on

KPNC IRB  Version: 06/22/[ADDRESS_410106] shown that PCPs can substantially 
improve their assessments when patients more effectively and pro -
actively communicate their preferences.
32,33 Indeed, current 
research suggests that patient -provider 
interactions could become more 
effective if providers better understood 
the patient’s current priorities34-38 and 
were more aware of “unvoiced” agendas.
39,40 This supports the 
hypothesis that supporting patients in identifying and articulating their care priorities will improve 
provider knowledge and lead to more productive visit interactions .  
System-level change: The key conceptual innovation of this study is to focus on creating an effective, 
easy-to-use tool for patients with multiple concurrent conditions to identify and discuss their top care 
priorities for their upcoming primary care visit. We will conduct foundational work to better understand 
the different goals and values of patient and providers as they relate to setting priorities ( Aim 1); apply 
this knowledge to design a simple web -based tool that can be used in the waiting room ( Aim 2); and then 
test the impact of this approach in a rigorous randomized trial that will measure both patient-relevant and 
clinical care outcomes (Aim 3 ). The intervention follows the framework of the Chronic C are Model 
(CCM), with a specific focus on creating “informed, activated patients” through delivery system re-design that enables patients preparing for primary care visits to identify which items are of greatest priority for them at that time.

investigate how each physician would seek to balance any differences between the two sets of priorities. Finally, in

survey data and assembly of analytic datasets is masked to randomization status.  For Aim 3, we enroll 
PCPs and the ir patients from KPNC primary care practices in Oakland and San Francisco. PCPs are 
recruited via their weekly practice meetings and through individual in -person contacts.  
Intervention 
Intervention patients are provided the Visit Planner on a tablet tool in the waiting room. The tool starts  off with a 
video that explained the purpose of the application and educated patients about the importance of bringing up 
their concerns early rather than later in the visit.  Then, the tool prompts them to choose their top 1 or 2 concerns 
for the visit from 6 categories (New Problem, Medicines, Need something from the doctor, Old Problem, Stress at home or at work, A personal concern or other). Wi thin each category, patients have the option of choosing 3-4 
sub-categories and of inputting additional comments in a free- text field. After identifying their top visit priorities, 
patients are then prompted to identify how they would use their time during or after the visit to stay involved with 
their care (e.g., Take notes during the visit, Ask my doctor questions during the visit, Review with a friend or 
loved one, Check online patient portal after the visit). All patient responses are subsequently printed out as a Visit 
Planner Summary for the patient to bring into their visit.  
 
Control 
Control patients are  also met in the waiting room before eligible visits . Control patients are given a 1 -page healthy 
lifestyle education handout.   Patients in bo th study arms otherwise receive  usual care throughout the clinical trial period.

b. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 
 
PCP Eligibility : Providers are eligible for inclusion if they have at least 5 potentially study -eligible 
patients within their patient panel and plan to remain at their current practice for the following year. 
Patient Eligibility : We use the KPNC electronic clinical data repository to identify a broad spectrum of 
potentially  eligible patients within each participating PCP’s patient panel. Patient eligibility is defined as 
having 2 or more chronic conditions  (defined using our validated clinical data algorithms for the 
following common chronic conditions: type 2 diabetes, hype rtension, cardiovascular disease, 
dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/asthma, depression, renal insufficiency, cancer, and 
symptomatic arthritis) and 1 or more Quantitative Clinical Care gaps  defined using KPNC -
implemented quality metric algorithms (e.g. preventive cancer screening  for breast, cervical, and/or 
colorectal cancer screening among screen -eligible patients; and to chronic disease management  including 
annual HbA1c testing and result < 8.0%  for patients with diabetes; annual blood pressure measurement 
and systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 140 mg Hg for patients with diabetes, hypertension, or cardiovascular disease (CVD); annual cholesterol measurement and LDL < 100 mg/dL for patients with diabetes or 
CVD). We exclude patients with ps ychosis or dementia or other deficits that significantly impair 
communication or use of computers. Screening is conducted via electronic record review and patient 
phone calls. We retain information from decliners so that subjects are not re- contact[CONTACT_331498].  
 
c. Vulnerable Populations 
 
  We do not make any special effort to include or exclude vulnerable populations, however our study only 
includes adult members with at least two complex conditions who can participate in an English or Spanish 
language interview.  Each subject, including those in a vulnerable population listed above who may be randomly selected into our study sample, have the opportunity to decline participation and avoid further contact [CONTACT_331499]. Given 
the very low -risk nature of study participation, i.e. survey completion on a PC tablet or interview 
participation, no additional safeguards, beyond standard confidentiality safeguards, are employed. T PMG 
physicians are  assured that no individual identifiable responses gathered during interviews will be shared 
with others outside of the study team.  
Decisionally Impaired Adults   
a. If you will obtain surrogate consent, describe detailed research plan to the surrogate, including present

Recruitment Methods  
On 1/22/16, the IRB approved the “Aligning Patient and Providers” clinical trial. Intervention arm patients have 
the opportunity to use the Align Waiting Room Tool (an iPad based application that helps them prepare for their visit) while control patients receive a KP -designed handout on healthy lifestyle advice.  
We have the following research protocol for our clinical trial: 
1) As with our procedure for our similar ongoing clinical trial (CN -13-1579 – Pre -Visit Prioritization for 
Complex Patients with Diabetes), [CONTACT_126825] contacts Primary Care Practice Leaders (via e- mail or in -person) 
to request permission to present the “Aligning Patient and Providers” clinical trial at a weekly practice meeting. At this meeting, [CONTACT_126825] explains the purpose for his visit, describes the study, and identifies  
providers willing to participate. With help from research staff, [CONTACT_126825] then obtains written  informed 
consent from willing physicians. Consenting physicians also review a list of their own potentially el igible 
patients to approve contacts and complete the 5 -item baseline questionnaire at this time. This entire process 
takes 20-30 minutes. 
2) PCP-approved patients are then sent a letter explaining the study. The letter include s a phone number and e-
mail address for patients who wish to participate or opt out of the study. After [ADDRESS_410113] not yet responded and – using our phone script – invite patients to participate in our study. 
3) We obtain verbal informed consent during this phone ca ll to administer a brief patient baseline questionnaire 
and arrange with patients to meet ahead of time at their primary care practice on the day of their next scheduled visit. For visits that occur > [ADDRESS_410114] 
scheduled an appointment with their primary care physician. 
4) At the primary care practice prior to their visit, the research assistant obtain s written informed consent. 
Patients allocated to the intervention arm are then given the pre -loaded iPad with the Visit Plan ner Waiting 
Room Tool that help s them prepare for their visit. This tool takes approximately 4 minutes to complete. On 
completion of the program, the research assistant print s out the patient’s answers and the patient can bring this 
page into the exam room to remind themselves of their visit priorities and plans. As is clearly explained to the 
patient, none of the answers entered by [CONTACT_331500]’s own use. Control patients receive the “Healthy Living/Physical Activity - Every Move Matters” KP -
designed 2-page pamphlet. 
5) Patients are called within [ADDRESS_410115] -
visit survey. All patients completing these surveys receive a $[ADDRESS_410116] manager review s and present s the consent form before the scheduled 
interview  in the waiting room .  We ask if the individual has any questions, provide answers, and obtain 
signed informed consent prior to the interview beginning.

 Procedures performed to lessen the probability or magnitude of risks
. The main risk is loss of confidentiality. 
KPNC DOR researchers are accustomed to maintaining processes to ensure conf identiality.  No notations are 
made in the participant’s medical chart.  Subjects are advised that some of the interview questions are of a 
personal nature, but that all data are handled with confidentiality.  Subjects are further assured of their right to  
refuse to answer any questions.  Participant privacy and confidentiality is  ensured by:  
1. Securing storage of physical data (e.g., papers) in locked files, and securing storage of digital data 
(computer files, digital audio) in password-protected files on pa ssword protected computers.  
2. Making data that may contain identifying features accessible only to members of the research team working under the direction of the investigators during the duration of the project. 
3. Use of a study ID on all audio files and tran scripts. The transcriptionist do not transcribe any identifying 
information.  Study staff review hard copy transcripts and remove any remaining identifying information (such as names, place names, etc.).  All audio files are destroyed after transcription.

Data Analysis  
Study outcomes 
Our primary clinical outcome is the closing of quality care gaps within 6 months of study visits. Individual care 
gaps are measured at baseline and 6 -month follow-up as a total count of any care gap at both time periods. 
Change in aggregated care gaps from baseline to follow -up is also assessed in four ways: closure of all baseline 
gaps, closure of any baseline gaps, opening of new care gaps, and presence of no gaps at the end of the study.  
 
Our primary patient- reported outcomes regarding their care experiences are obtained during post- visit telephone 
calls using questions drawn from validated survey instruments. Surveys are conducted within [ADDRESS_410120]- visit with friends

Potential Benefits to Subjects  
The effective primary care of complex patients remains an important and increasing challenge both for KP and nation-wide. There are a wide range of treatments that reduce risk for morbidity and mortality, 
but translating these benefits for all patients has been difficult to achieve. We hypothesize that 
understanding and addressing the issue of prioritization prior to the primary care visit may represent one 
innovative approach to addressing these challenges by [CONTACT_331506]- limited primary care visit

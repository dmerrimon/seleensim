ABSTRACT  
In response to DNA damage or replication stress, cells initiate a DNA damage response (DDR) that 
activates cell cycle checkpoints to halt progress through the cell cycle to allow for DNA repair. DNA 
damage can arise from normal metabolic processes within the cell (e.g. replication stress) as well as from 
external sources such as environmental insults (e.g. UV radiation) and DNA-damaging agents.  
Checkpoint kinase proteins 1 (CHK1) and 2 (CHK2) are conserved serine/threonine kinases that are key effectors of  multiple checkpoint responses in eukaryotic cells exposed to genotoxic stress. CHK1 has also 
been determined to directly affect repair of DNA, confirming its role in maintaining genomic integrity. 
Inhibition of CHK1 abrogates the DDR checkpoint, allowing cells that have sustained DNA damage to 
prematurely enter mitosis and undergo mitotic catastrophe due to incompletely replicated chromosomes. LY2606368 is a novel, second generation selective, dual inhibitor of CHK1/2. In vitro studies focused in 
cell line s derived from human pediatric tumors (ALL, Ewing’s sarcoma, medulloblastoma, neuroblastoma, 
osteosarcoma, retinoblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma) indicate that LY2606368 is a potent inhibitor of cell 
proliferation. Additionally, the antitumor activity of LY2606368 has been evaluated in 14 pediatric tumor 
xenograft models. LY2606368 was well tolerated and an objective response was noted in 6 of 14 (43%) 
solid tumor xenografts including neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma (n=3), Ewing sarcoma, and 
desmoplastic smal l round cell tumor (DSRCT). An adult phase I trial in women with breast or ovarian 
cancer and patients with advanced solid tumors showed that LY2606368 is generally well -tolerated with 
common side effects of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, nausea, headache, diarrhea, and anorexia. We will conduct a phase 1 trial of LY2606368 in children with relapsed/refractory solid tumors, including 
CNS, using the rolling six design. The primary aims of this trial will be to establish the maximum tolerated 
dose of  LY2606368 and to characterize the toxicities and pharmacokinetics of LY2606368 in children with 
these tumors. Our secondary aims will be to preliminarily define the anti -tumor efficacy of LY2606368 
within the confines of a phase I trial and to examine CHK1/2 expression status in archival tumor tissue. Additional exploratory aims will seek to define new pharmacodynamic markers of LY2606368 activity by 
[CONTACT_628760]/or mutation of TP53  and peripheral blood mononuclear cells for 
autophosphorylation of Chk1 and H2AX.

2.0 BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Introduction/Rationale for Development  
Genetic material within a cell is exposed to endogenous as well as exogenous sources of 
stress. Continuous monitoring and maintenance of genetic structure is essential for cell 
survival and proliferation. In response to DNA damage or replication stress, cells initiate a 
DNA damage response (DDR) that activates cell cycle checkpoints to halt progress through 
the cell cycle to allow for DNA repair.
1 DNA damage can arise from normal metabolic 
processes within the cell (e.g. replication stress) as well as from external sources such as 
environmental insults (e.g. UV radiation) and DNA -damaging agents.2 There are primary 
checkpoints that mediate cell cycle progression – G1/S, S and G2/M that induce cell cycle 
arrest and allow for DNA damage repair pri or to replication or mitosis.3-5 
 
Checkpoint kinase proteins 1 (CHK1) and 2 (CHK2) are conserved serine/threonine 
kinases and are key effectors of multiple checkpoint responses in eukaryotic cells exposed 
to genotoxic stress. CHK1 is activated by [CONTACT_628761] a key role in the intra- S and G2/M DNA damage checkpoints that slow DNA 
replication and limit mitotic entry, respectively.6,7 CHK1 is also critical to enforcing the 
S/M checkpoint when DNA synthesis is blocked and replication is incomplete.8,[ADDRESS_837837] sustained DNA damage to prem aturely enter mitosis and undergo 
mitotic catastrophe due to incompletely replicated chromosome.3,10 While the mechanism

Version Date: 01/31/[ADDRESS_837838] a level of DNA damage and/or replication stress.2,[ADDRESS_837839] increased spontaneous 
chromosome missegregation. These cells lose the ability to recruit spi[INVESTIGATOR_628748].
5 This finding suggests that CHK1 is essential for stable 
attachment of mitotic spi[INVESTIGATOR_628749]. Thus, i t is postulated that 
CHK1 inhibition alone can generate DNA damage and induce mitotic catastrophe.  
 
 
2.2 Preclinical Studies  
 
2.2.1 Antitumor Activity  
LY2606368 is a novel, second generation ATP -competitive, selective, dual 
inhibitor of CHK1/2 that has shown activity in xenograft models of ovarian and 
prostate cancer as a single agent, as well as in combination with cisplatin or 
paclitaxel.15,16 CHK1 inhibition has been reported potentiate the activity of DNA -
damaging agents such as cisplatin by [CONTACT_628762]’s capacity to repair the damage.17,[ADDRESS_837840], CHK1 functions as a negative 
regulator of replication origin activation; specifically,  keepi[INVESTIGATOR_628750] S phase. When CHK1 protein is depleted, more replication origins are activated in early S phase than the replication apparatus can tolerate, resulting 
in slowed and arrested DNA replication forks and DNA doubl e-strand breakage. 
Treatment with LY2606368 causes a cellular phenotype identical to that reported in ribonucleic acid (RNA) interference (RNAi) knockdown experiments such that 
HeLa cells treated with LY2606368 show a clear defect in chromatin condensation  
and failure of the mitotic spi[INVESTIGATOR_628751].
[ADDRESS_837841] 
that as a single agent in vitro, LY2606368 behaves mechanistically as a DNA - 
damaging agent, a checkpoint inhibitor, and as an inhibitor of DNA replication and 
mitosis.  
 Additional in vitro  studies focused in cell lines derived from human pediatric 
tumors (ALL, Ewing’s sarcoma, medulloblastoma, neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma,

retinoblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma) indicate that LY2606368 is a potent 
inhibitor of cell proliferation. In particular, all of t he [ADDRESS_837842] other 
agents evaluated which included vincristine, ci splatin, doxorubicin and 
gemcitabine. There were only 3 situations wherein LY2606368 did not show greater potency that the other single agents and, in these cases LY2606368 showed 
equivalent, but not lower potency to one of the other 4 agents tested. 
 
The antitumor activity of LY2606368 has been evaluated in 14 pediatric tumor 
xenograft models.
22 LY2606368 was well tolerated and all models were considered 
evaluable; an objective response was noted in 6 of 14 (43%) solid tumor xenografts. The models showing regression include neuroblastoma and 
rhabdomyosarcoma (n=3), Ewing sarcoma and desmoplastic small round cell 
tumor (DSRCT). Xenograft models showing either disease stabilization or no antitumor effect include osteosarcoma (n=4), retinoblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma 
and Ewing sarcoma. Neuroblastoma cells are more sensitive to depletion or 
inhibition o f CHK1 as compared to normal controls, and sensitivity correlates with 
expression of the oncogene N- MYC and elevated levels of phospho -CHK1.

function consisting of increased heart rate and decreased blood pressure were 
attributed to LY2606368 in dogs. On the basis of these collective studies in 
animals, the dose- limiting to xicity in humans was expected to be 1 or more of the 
following: myelosuppression, gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity, tachycardia, and hypotension. Patients receiving LY2606368 were closely monitored for these 
potential effects.

2.2.3 Preclinical Pharmacokinetic Studies  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Single dose studies in dogs. 
The PK of LY2606368 and LY2606368- derived radioactivity were

[14C]LY2606368. Concentrations of LY2606368 declined rapi[INVESTIGATOR_91590] a 
monoexponential fashion following a single 1- hour IV infusion of 
[14C]LY2606368 in both rats and dogs. At C max, LY2606368 accounted for 
approximately 37% and 69% of the plasma radioactivity in rats and dogs, respectively. However, the exposure (area under th e plasma concentration -
time curve [AUC] from time 0 to infinite time [AUC(0 -∝)]) of 
LY2606368 accounted for approximately 16% and 2% of the radioactivity exposure in plasma in rats and dogs, respectively, indicating the presence

half- life (t 1/2) for the residual low levels of radioacti vity. Metabolites 
appear to contribute to the longer t 1/2 of radioactivity when compared with 
that of LY2606368. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Repeated -dose studies in dogs. 
 
LY2606368 was administered as a 1-hour IV infusion to male and female 
dogs in doses ranging from 1 to 10 mg/kg/day and as a 2- hour IV infusion 
to male and female dogs at a dose of 40 mg/kg/day on 3 consecutive days 
per week for 3 weeks (dosed on Days 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 15, 16, and 17). 
Systemic exposures to LY2606368 were similar for male and female 
animals. No accumulation of LY2606368 in plasma was observed 
following multiple dosing. The increase in C max and AUC (0-24) was roughly 
dose proportional on Days 1 and 17. 
 
2.3 Adult Studies  
 
2.3.1 Phase 1 Studies  
LY2606368 is a novel, second generation, ATP -competitive selective inhibitor of 
Chk1/[ADDRESS_837846] cancer or ovarian cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and in patients with 
advanced solid tumors. As of [ADDRESS_837847] been exposed to 
LY2606368 with PK data available from 194 patients from 3 ongoing clinical trial s 
(Study JTJA , Study JTJF and Study JTJK ). Study JTJA is the first -in-human Phase 
[ADDRESS_837848], ovarian or prostate cancer 
(NCT0220351). 
 
Neutropenia and febrile neutropenia are  the most frequent toxicit ies in these 
studies and have  been observed at all doses and schedules of LY2606368. 
Neutrophils counts reached their nadir on day 8 of a cycle and resulted in transient 
grade 4 neutropenia that was less than 5 days. (IB) Grade 4 neutropenia was observed in 66% of the adult patients treated at 105 mg/m
2 every 2 weeks, and a 
total of 11% of patients experienced febrile neutropenia  that was felt by 
[CONTACT_628763]2606368 therapy. None of the febrile neutropenia 
events required discontinuation of the study and none were associated with an 
outcome of death.  Other hematologic toxicities included anemia (Grade 4: 0%) and thrombocytopenia (Grade 4: 6%). 
 
The most common non -hematologic treatment related adverse events (AEs) and 
occurring in >5% of patients treated at 105 mg/m
2 every 14 days were fatigue 
(25%), nausea (12%), headache (11%), diarrhea (9%) and anorexia (8%).  The 
majority of these events were Grade 1 in severity.  
 
In non -clinical studies, LY2606368 elicited effects on the cardiovascular system 
of dogs consisting of moderate -to-severe increases in heart rate and minimal 
decreases in blood pressure. Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities were also 
observed in dogs and prolongation of the QRS duration and QT intervals were

observed at doses above the nonclinical MTD (> 80 mg/m2). A total of 7 patients 
(6.9%) had a QT change of >30 msec from baseline. No statistically significant 
changes from baseline were observed.  
  
2.3.2 Pharmacology/Pharmacokinetics/Correlative and Biological Studies  
LY2606368 infused over 1 hour had a half -life (t 1/2) of 10.5 hours in adults with 
advanced cancer. The major route of metabolism was by [CONTACT_097]450 and 75% of the 
metabolite was excreted in the feces and 11% in urine.21 The LY2606368 exposure 
increased in a dose -dependent manner across the dose range of 10 to 130 mg/m2 
on Day 1 of Cycle 1 across both schedules of administration. The mean t1/2 (range: 8.30 to 18.3 hours) varied across days and cycles of treatment after administration 
of the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of 105 mg/ m
2. Moderate - to-large 
degree of inter -patient PK variability in LY2606368 systemic clearance has also 
been observed. However, the linear relationship between LY2606368 PK 
parameters and body surface area (BSA) from Study JTJA indicates that 
administration  of LY2606368 based on BSA is an appropriate dosing paradigm. 
This is the approach we propose to use in pediatric patients.  
 While in vitro  data suggested that drug -drug interactions may be possible when 
LY62606368 is co- administered with cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A2 and CYP2D6 
substrates, minimal potential for drug- drug interactions with either substrates was 
predicted.  
 While overexpression of Chk1 in adult non- small cell lung cancer tumor tissue has 
been correlated with poor prognosis
24, phosphorylation of pChk1(S296) has been 
proposed as a potential predictive biomarker of CHk1 inhibito r sensitivity in breast 
cancer.[ADDRESS_837849] been no pediatric studies of LY2606368. 
  
2.4.2 Pharmacology/Pharmacokinetics/Correlative Biological Studies  
 There have been no pediatric studies of LY2606368.  
 
2.5 Overview of Proposed Pediatric Study  
We propose a phase 1 study of LY2606368 in pediatric patients with recurrent/refractory 
solid tumors using a rolling 6 design.
26 Based upon the published preclinical data on the 
importance of cell cycle checkpoint perturbation in tumor types carrying a variety of molecular  lesions, we propose this phase 1 study to establish the maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of LY2606368. The starting dose selection 
is based on data from the adult study and RP2D of 105 mg/m
2 once daily on Days 1 and 
15, eve ry 28 days. The initial dose level in pediatric patients will be 80 mg/m2, which is 
approximately 80% of the adult RP2D, with one dose de -escalation for toxicity and 3 dose 
escalations to define the dose in children with refractory/recurrent solid tumors.

THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY   
 
23 
Version Date: 01/31/2019 
The starting dose of LY2606368 will be 80 mg/m2 (dose level 1) with dose levels 
for subsequent groups of patients as follows.  
 
Dose Level  LY2606368  (mg/m2) 
0 60 
1* 80 
2 100 
3 125 
4 150 
* Starting Dose Level  
 
There will be no escalations beyond dose level 4 (150 mg/m2), as previous pediatric 
Phase [ADDRESS_837882] rarely defined a MTD greater than 160% of the adult MTD.  
 If the MTD has been exceeded at the first dose level, then the subsequent cohort 
of patients will be treated at a dose of 60 mg/m
2 (dose level 0). If dose level 0 is 
not well tolerated, further de -escalation will not occur. The study will be closed to 
accrual.  
 
5.3.2 Intra -Patient Escalation  
There will not be intra -patient dose escalation.  
 
5.4 Grading of Adverse Events  
Adverse events (toxicities) will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. All appropriate treatment areas should 
have access to a copy of the CTCAE versi on 5.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be 
downloaded from the CTEP website (http://ctep.cancer.gov). Any suspected or confirmed dose- limiting toxicity should be reported immediately (within 24 hours) to the Study Chair.  
 
5.5 Definition of Dose -Limiting To xicity (DLT)  
DLT will be defined as any of the following events that are possibly, probably or definitely 
attributable to protocol therapy. The DLT observation period for the purposes of dose -
escalation will be the first cycle of therapy.  
 
Dose limiting he matological and non- hematological toxicities are defined differently.  
 
5.5.1 Non-hematological dose -limiting toxicity  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Any Grade 3 or greater non -hematological toxicity attributable to the 
investigational drug with the specific exclusion of:  
• Grade 3 nausea and vomiting < 3 days duration 
• Grade 3 liver enzyme elevation, including ALT/AST/GGT, that 
returns to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline prior to the time for the next 
treatment cycle. Note:  For the purposes of this study the ULN for 
ALT is defined as 45 U/L  and the ULN for AST is defined as 50 
U/L. Adverse event grades will be based on increases above the 
upper limit of normal, regardless of the subject’s baseline. See 
Appendix IX  for values that represent thresholds between CTCAE 
grades. 
• Grade 3 fever  
• Grade 3 infection

• Grade 3 hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia or 
hypomagnesemia responsive to supplementation. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Non-hematological toxicity that causes a delay of ≥ 14 days between 
treatment cycles.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Note: Allergic reactions that necessitate discontinuation of study drug will 
not be considered a dose -limiting toxicity.  
 
5.5.2 Hematological dose limiting toxicity  
[IP_ADDRESS]  In patients evaluable for hematological toxicity (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), 
hematological dose limiting toxicity is defined as: 
• Day 15 :  
o Grade 4 neutropenia or Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (platelets 
< 50,000/mm3) that does not resolve to ANC ≥ 500/mm3 and 
platelets ≥ 50,000/mm3 (transfusion independent) by [CONTACT_2006] 18 will 
be co nsidered dose -limiting (See Section 6.1 ). 
• Grade 4 neutropenia for > 7 days 
• Platelet count < 20,000/mm3 on 2 separate days, or requiring a platelet 
transfusion on 2 separate days, within a 7-day period  
• Myelosuppression that causes a delay of > 14 days between treatment cycles.

6.1 Dose Modifications for Day 15 Dosing due to Toxicity on Day 15 
 
6.1.1 Hematologic Toxicity  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Patients who have Grade 4 neutropenia or Grade 3 thrombocytopenia 
(platelets <  50,000/mm3) on Day [ADDRESS_837884] their dose withheld. If the 
toxicit y  r e s o l v e s  t o  A N C  ≥  5 0 0 / m m3 and platelets ≥ 50,000/mm3 
(transfusion independent) by [CONTACT_2006] 18, the dose may be given. If the toxicity 
does not resolve to ANC ≥ 500/mm3 and platelets ≥ 50,000/mm3 by [CONTACT_2006] 
18, the dose will be omitted and this will be considered a DLT. Patients 
should receive subsequent cycles of drug per Section 6.2 . Patients who 
require that their Day 15 dose be omitted for Grade 4 neutropenia or Grade 
3 platelets (< 50,000/mm3) after two dose reductions must be removed 
from protocol therapy.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Patients who meet hematological DLT criteria as defined in Section 
[IP_ADDRESS]  on Day [ADDRESS_837885] their Day 15 dose omitted. Patients should

defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  after two dose reductions must be removed from 
protocol therapy. 
 
6.1.2 Non-Hematologic Toxicity 
    
[IP_ADDRESS]  Patients who have Grade 3 or Grade 4 non- hematological toxicity 
attributable to the study drug prior to  the Day 15 dose (with the exception 
of the DL T exclusions in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) will be considered to have had 
a DLT. If the toxicity resolves to meet eligibility or ≤ Grade 2 (if not part  
of eligibility criteria) by [CONTACT_2006] 15, the dose may be given but at the next lower dose level.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Patients who have Grade 3 or Grade 4 non- hematological toxicity 
attributable to the study drug on Day 15 prior to dosing (with the exception 
of the DLT exclusions in Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) will have their dose withh eld 
and this will be considered a DLT. If the toxicity resolves to meet 
eligibility or ≤ Grade 2 (if not part of eligibility criteria) by [CONTACT_2006] [ADDRESS_837886] dose- limiting neutropenia with no other dose -limiting toxicity 
should receive the same dose in the next cycle with myeloid growth factor support. 
[Note: Patients MUST NOT receive pr ophylactic myeloid growth factor in the first 
cycle of therapy (See Section 7.4
).] If dose -limiting neutropenia recurs after myeloid 
growth factor is added, then the patient should be given the next lower dose level for subseq uent cycles. If dose- limiting neutropenia recurs in a patient that has received 
a dose level reduction but has not received myeloid growth factor, then myeloid growth factor should be administered. Patients who experience dose -limiting 
neutropenia after the addition of myeloid growth factor and one dose reduction must 
be removed from protocol therapy. 
 
6.2.3 Patients who meet hematological DLT criteria as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  on Day 
[ADDRESS_837887] be removed from protocol therapy.

Version Date: 01/31/[ADDRESS_837888] any dose- limiting non -hematological toxicity (as defined in 
Section 5.5.1 ) may continue on protocol therapy upon meeting eligibility lab 
requirements or baseline but should receive subsequent doses at the next lower dose 
level.  
 
6.3.[ADDRESS_837889] be removed from protocol therapy. 
 
6.3.4 No dose reduction beyond dose level 0 is allowed. 
 
6.3.5 Infusion Reactions:  Patients experiencing an infusion reaction should be treated as 
per institutional guidelines. For subsequent infusions, premedication with 
diphenhydramine 0.5- 1 mg/kg (max 50 mg) and/or other premedications may be 
considered at investigators discretion. The infusion rate may also be decreased by 50%. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infusion reactions with 
subsequent infusions. 
 
 
7.0 SUPPORTIVE CARE AND OTHER CONCOMITANT THERAPY 
 
7.1 Concurrent Anticancer Therapy  
Concurrent cancer therapy, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, or 
biologic therapy may NOT be administered to patients receiving study drug. If these 
treatments are administered the patient will be remove d from protocol therapy. 
7.2 Investigational Agents 
No other investigational agents may be given while the patient is on study.  
 
7.3 Supportive Care  
Appropriate antibiotics, blood products, antiemetics, fluids, electrolytes and general 
supportive care are to be us ed as necessary.  See Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for drugs that should not be 
used concomitantly due to potential interactions with LY2606368. Drugs that prolong the QTc 
may be used only if the drug is necessary and no alternatives ar e available. See Appendix IV  
for drugs that may prolong the QTc.

Version Date: 01/31/2019 
Patients who are off protocol therapy are to be followed until they meet the criteria for Off 
Study (see below). Ongoing adverse events, or adverse events that emerge after the patient 
is removed from protocol therapy, but within [ADDRESS_837906] and CTEP -AERS (if applicable).  Follow -
up data will be required unless consent is withdrawn.

a) Thirty days after the last dose of the investigational agent.  
b) Deat h 
c) Lost to follow -up 
d) Withdrawal of consent for any required observations or data submission.

11.0 STATISTICAL AND ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
11.1 Sample Size and Study Duration  
 
A minimum of 4 patients will be enrolled in this study. The expected maximum number of 
evaluable patients required to estimate the MTD/RP2D is 24. Once the MTD or 
recommended Phase 2 dose has been defined, up to 6 additional patients with recurrent or 
refractory solid tumors without r estrictions on heme evaluability may be enrolled to acquire 
PK data in a representative number of young patients (i.e. patients < 12 years old). 
Therefore, a maximum of 36 patients are expected to be enrolled which allows for 6 
patients at each of 4 dose l evels, 6 additional patients enrolled at the MTD/RP2D for PK 
analysis, and a 20% inevaluable rate. Review of the enrollment rate into previous COG new agent studies indicates that 1 -2 patients per month are available, which will permit 
completion of the study within 18- 36 months. An absolute maximum of 65 patients is 
anticipated in the unlikely scenario that each of 4 dose levels is expanded to 12 patients due to different classes of AEs, 6 additional patients are enrolled at the MTD for PK 
analysis, and a 20% inevaluable rate. The absolute maximum would require about 33- [ADDRESS_837907] one dose of the study drug(s) and/or who 
experiences a dose- limiting toxicity is considered evaluable for Adverse Events. 
In addition, for the dose -escalation portion during Cycle 1, patients must receive 
at least 85% of the prescribed dose per protocol guidelines and must have the 
appropriate toxicity monitoring studies performed to be considered evaluable for 
dose limiting toxicity. Patients who do not have DLT and are not considered 
evaluable for toxicity will be replaced.  
 
11.2.2  Maximum Tolerated Dose 
• The MTD will be the maximum dose at which fewer than one- third of patients 
experience DLT (See Section 5.5 ) during Cycle 1 of therapy.  
 
 
                              
ADVL1515  
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY   
 
38 
Version Date: 01/31/2019 
• In the unlikely event that two DLTs observed out of 6 evaluable patients are 
different classes of Adverse Effects (e.g. hepatotoxicity and 
myelosuppression), AND all of the following conditions are met, expansion 
of the cohort to 12 patients will be considered:  
 
•  One of the DLTs does not appear to be dose- related  
•  The Adverse Effects are readily reversible  
•  The study chair, DVL statistician, DVL committee chair or vice  chair, and 
IND sponsor all agree that expansion of the cohort is acceptable  
 
If fewer than 1/3 of patients in the expanded cohort experience dose -limiting 
toxicities, the dose escalation can proceed.  
 
• The DLTs observed in the pharmacokinetic (PK) expansion cohort will be 
counted towards the total number of DLTs observed at the MTD during the 
dose escalation portion of the study. If ≥ 1/3 of the cohort of patients at the 
MTD (during the dose escalation plus the PK expansion) experience DLT then 
the MTD will be exceeded.  
 
 
11.[ADDRESS_837908] of this study.26 Two to six 
patients can be concurrently enrolled onto a dose level, dependent upon (1) the number of patients enrolled at the cu rrent dose level, (2) the number of patients who have experienced 
DLT at the current dose level, and (3) the number of patients entered but with tolerability 
data pending at the current dose level. Accrual is suspended when a cohort of six has 
enrolled or when the study endpoints have been met.  
 
Dose level assignment is based on the number of participants currently enrolled in the cohort, the number of DLTs observed, and the number of participants at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 
a DLT (i.e., participants enrolled but who are not yet assessable for toxicity). For example, 
when three participants are enrolled onto a dose cohort, if toxicity data is available for all 
three when the fourth participant entered and there are no DLTs, the dose is escalated and 
the fourth participant is enrolled to the subsequent dose level. If data is not yet available for one or more of the first three participants and no DLT has been observed, or if one DLT 
has been observed, the new participant is entered at the same dose level. Lastly, if two or 
more DLTs have been observed, the dose level is de- escalated. This process is repeated for 
participants five and six. In place of suspending accrual after every three participants, 
accrual is only suspended when a cohort of six is filled. When participants are inevaluable for toxicity, they are replaced with the next available participant if escalation or de-
escalation rules have not been fulfilled at the time the next available participant is enrolled 
onto the study.  
 
The following table provides  the decision rules for enrolling a patient at (i) the current dose 
level (ii) at an escalated dose level, (iii) at a de- escalated dose level, or whether the study 
is suspended to accrual:

11.5 Pharmacokinetic and Correlative Studies and Response Analysis  
 
A descriptive analysis of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of LY2606368 will be performed to define systemic exposure, drug clearance, and other pharmacokinetic parameters. The PK parameters will be summarized with simple summary statistics, 
including means , medians, ranges, and standard deviations (if numbers and distribution 
permit).    
While the primary aim of this study is to evaluate the toxicity of LY2606368, patients will 
have disease evaluations performed as indicated in Section 8.[ADDRESS_837910] criteria for patients with solid tumors, and will be reported descriptively.  
 All these analyses will be descriptive and exploratory and hypotheses generating in nature.

Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.[ADDRESS_837911] access to a copy of the CTCAE version 5.0.  A 
copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm ). 
 
12.2 Response Criteria for Patients with Solid Tumors  
See the table in Section 8.0  for the schedule of tumor evaluations. In addition to the 
scheduled scans, a confirmatory scan should be obtained on the next consecutive cycle following initial documentation of objective response. 
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the revised Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1).[ADDRESS_837912] diameter (unidimensional 
measurement) of the tumor lesions but the shortest  diameter of malignant lymph nodes are 
used in the RECIST v 1.1 criteria. 
 
12.2.1  Definitions  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluable for objective response: Patients who exhibit objective disease 
progression prior to the end of cycle [ADDRESS_837913] had their disease re- evalu ated will be considered evaluable for 
response.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluable Non- Target Disease Response: Patients who have lesions 
present at baseline that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least one cycle of th erapy, and have 
had their disease re -evaluated will be considered evaluable for non -
target disease. The response assessment is based on the presence, absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
 
12.2.2  Disease Parameters  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Measurable disease: Mea surable lesions are defined as those that can be 
accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be 
recorded) as ≥ [ADDRESS_837914] x -ray, as ≥ [ADDRESS_837915] scan, or ≥ [ADDRESS_837916] be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Note :  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area 
must show definitive evidence of progression to be considered 
measurable.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Malignant lymph nodes : To be considere d pathologically enlarged and 
measurable, a lymph node must be ≥ 15 mm in short axis when assessed 
 
                              
ADVL1515  
THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY   
 
42 
Version Date: 01/31/[ADDRESS_837917] scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline 
and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-measurable disease: All other lesions (or sites of disease), including 
small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis), are considered non- measurable 
disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites , 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_13191]), are considered as non- measurable.  
 
Note:   Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined 
simp le cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions 
(neither measurable nor non- measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts. ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent 
cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they 
meet the de finition of measurability described above. However, 
if non -cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are 
preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Target lesions : All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per 
organ and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should 
be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with 
the longest diameter), be representative of all  involved organs, but in 
addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion 
does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest l esion that can be measured reproducibly should be 
selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short 
axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and 
reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize 
any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the 
disease.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Non-target lesions : All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any 
measurable lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be 
identified as non -target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  
Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence , 
absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be 
noted throughout follow -up.  
 
12.2.3  Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers.  
 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up.

Version Date: 01/31/2019 
Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_99237](s) being  followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical lesions : Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable 
when they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) 
and ≥ 10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules). In 
the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including 
a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Chest x -ray: Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions 
when th ey are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  
However, CT is preferable.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Conventional CT and MRI: This guideline has defined measurability of 
lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_837918] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice 
thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body 
scans). Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image 
acqu isition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior 
scans.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] PET-CT: At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion 
of a combined PET -CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality 
for use with RECIST measurements. However, if the site can document 
that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of identical diagnostic 
quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT 
portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can 
be used interchan geably with conventional CT in accurately measuring 
cancer lesions over time. Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT 
introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not 
routinely or serially performed.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor markers : Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response. 
If markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Cytology, Histology:  These techniques can be used to differentiate 
between partial responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare 
cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, 
where known residual benign tumors can remain). 
  Cytology should be o btained if an effusion appears or worsens during 
treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or 
stable disease.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] FDG -PET:  While FDG -PET response assessments need additional 
study, it is sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET 
scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG -
PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:

Version Date: 01/31/2019 
 
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with  a positive FDG- PET at follow -
up is a sign of PD based on a new lesion. 
b. No FDG- PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If 
the positive FDG -PET at follow- up corresponds to a new site of 
disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.  If the positive FDG- PET at 
follow- up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additional 
follow- up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly 
progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date 
of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If  the positive FDG -PET at 
follow- up corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT that is 
not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD. 
 
 Note :  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one that is FDG avid 
with an uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue 
on the attenuation corrected image.  
  
12.2.4  Response Criteria for Patients with Solid Tumor and Measurable Disease  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target and non -target 
lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether 
target or non -target) must have reduction in short 
axis to <[ADDRESS_837919] be detected by [CONTACT_6777]. 
Normalization of urinary catecholamines or other 
tumor markers if elevated at study enrollment (for 
patients with neuroblastoma).  
 
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
baseline sum diameters  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the 
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition 
to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. 
(Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions 
is also considered progressions). Note:  in 
presence of SD or PR in target disease but unequivocal progression in non- target or non-
measurable disease, the patient has PD  if there is 
an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that the overall tumor burden 
has increased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy

THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY   
 
45 
Version Date: 01/31/2019 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as 
reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph 
nodes must be non- pathological in size (<10 mm 
short axis) 
 
Note: If tumor markers are initially above the 
upper normal limit, they must normalize for a 
patient to be considered in complete clinical 
response.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non- target lesion(s) 
and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above 
the normal limits  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression  of existing non -target 
lesions. Unequivocal progression  should not 
normally trump target lesion status. It must be 
representative of overall disease status change, 
not a single lesion increase.

12.4.2  The following criteria will be used to report MIBG response by [CONTACT_6778]:  
 
Complete response :  Complete resolution of all MIBG positive lesions  
Parti al Response :  Resolution of at least one MIBG positive lesion, with 
persistence of other MIBG positive lesions  
Stable disease :  No change in MIBG scan in number of positive lesions 
Progressive disease: Development of new MIBG positive lesions 
 
12.4.3  The response  of MIBG lesions will be assessed on central review using the Curie 
scale14 as outlined below. Central review responses will be used to assess efficacy 
for study endpoint. See Section 8.2  for details on transferring images to the Imaging 
Research Center.  
 
NOTE: This scoring should also be done by [CONTACT_6779].  
 
The body is divided into 9 anatomic sectors for osteomedullary lesions, with a 10th 
general sector allocated for any extra- osseous lesion visible on MIBG scan . In each 
region, the lesions are scored as follows. The absolute extension score is graded 
as:  
0 = no site per segment,  1 = 1 site per segment,  
2 = more than one site per segment,  
3 = massive involvement (>50% of the segment).  
 
The absolute score is obtained by [CONTACT_6780]. See 
diagram of sectors below:

48 
Version Date: 01/31/2019 
 
 
The relative score is calculated by [CONTACT_99239] -treatment absolute score. The relative score of each 
patient is calculated at each response assessment compared to baseline and 
classified as below:  
1. Complete response: all areas of uptake on MIBG scan completely resolved.  
If morphological evidence of tumor cells in bone marrow biopsy or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_431649], no tumor cells can be detected by [CONTACT_6783][INVESTIGATOR_6714] 21 days apart to be considered a Complete Respo nse. 
2. Partial response : Relative score ≤ 0.2 (lesions almost disappeared) to ≤ 0.5 
(lesions strongly reduced). 
3. Stable disease : Relative score > 0.5 (lesions weakly but significantly reduced) 
to 1.0 (lesions not reduced).  
4. Progressive disease : New lesions on MIBG scan.

Each patient will be classified according to his “best response” for the purposes of 
analysis of treatment effect. Best response is determined from the sequence of the 
overall response assessments as described in Table 3 in Section 12. 7. 
 
12.5 Response Criteria for Neuroblastoma Patients with Bone Marrow Involvement  
 
12.5.1  Bone Marrow Involvement 
Bone marrow obtained within 14 days prior to study enrollment with tumor cells 
seen on routine morphology (not by [CONTACT_442837]) of 
bilateral aspi[INVESTIGATOR_99203]. 
 
Bone Marrow responses are determined by H&E Staining of bilateral bone marrow 
biopsies and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026].  
 
Complete Response :  No tumor cells detectable by [CONTACT_6785] [ADDRESS_837925] 21 days apart. Normalization of urinary catecholamines or other tumor markers if elevated at 
study enrollment. 
 
Progressive Disease :  In patients who enroll with neuroblastoma in bone 
marrow by [CONTACT_6786] a doubling in the amount of tumor in the marrow AND a minimum of 25% tumor in bone marrow by 
[CONTACT_5293]. (For example, a patient entering with 5% 
tumor in marrow by [CONTACT_6787] ≥ 25% 
tumor to have progressive disease; a patient entering with 
30% tumor must increase to > 60%). 
 
In patients who enroll without evidence of neuroblastoma 
in bone marrow will be defined as progressive disease if 
tumor is detected in [ADDRESS_837926] 21 days apart. 
 
Stable Disease: Persistence of tumor in bone marrow that does not meet 
the criteria for either complete response or progressive disease.  
 
12.5.[ADDRESS_837927] Response Assessment

[CONTACT_458383], immunocytochemistry techniques, tumor markers, 
CSF cytology, or other reliable measures.  
 
12.6.3  Selection of Target and Non -Target Lesions  
For mos t CNS tumors, only one lesion/mass is present and therefore is considered 
a “target” for measurement/follow up to assess for tumor progression/response. If multiple measurable lesions are present, up to 5 should be selected as “target” 
lesions. Target lesi ons should be selected on the basis of size and suitability for 
accurate repeated measurements. All other lesions will be followed as non -target 
lesions. The lower size limit of the target lesion(s) should be at least twice the thickness of the slices show ing the tumor to decrease the partial volume effect 
(e.g., 8 mm lesion for a 4 mm slice). 
 
Any change in size of non- target lesions should be noted, though does not need to be 
measured.  
 
12.6.[ADDRESS_837930] perpendicular diameter. Development of new disease or progression in any established lesions is considered progressive disease, regardless of response in other lesions – e.g., when multiple lesions show opposite responses, the 
progressive disease takes precedence. Response Criteria for target lesions:  
 
• Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions.  
 
• Partial response (PR):  ≥ 50% decrease in the sum of the products of the two 
perpendicular diameters of all target lesions (up to 5), taking as reference the initial baseline measurements.  
 
• Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient decrease in the sum of the products of 
the two pe rpendicular diameters of all target lesions to qualify for PR, nor 
sufficient increase in a single target lesion to qualify for PD.  
 
• Progressive Disease (PD):  25% or more increase in the sum of the products 
of the perpendicular diameters of the target lesions, taking as reference the 
smallest sum of the products observed since the start of treatment, or the 
appearance of one or more new lesions.  
 
12.6.5  Response Criteria for Non- Target Lesions:  
 
• Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non -target lesions.  
 
• Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (IR/SD):  The persistence of one or 
more non- target lesions.  
 
• Progressive Disease (PD):  The appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions.

12.6.6  Response criteria for tumor markers (if available):  
Tumor markers will be classified simply as being at normal levels or at abnormally 
high levels.  
 
12.6.7  Overall Response Assessment  
The overall response assessment takes into account response in both target and 
non-target lesions, the appearance of new lesions and normalization of markers 
(where applicable), according to the criteria described in the table below. The overall response assessment is shown in the last column, and depends on the 
assessments of target, non -target, marker and new  lesions in the preceding 
columns.

 Each patient will be classified according to his “best response” for the purposes of 
analysis of treatment effect.  Best response is determined as outlined in 
Section 
12.[ADDRESS_837931] response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The 
patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both 
measurement and confirmation criteria.

12.7.2  Duration of Response 
 
Duration of overall response: The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) 
until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented 
(taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started).  
 The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement crite ria are 
first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively 
documented.   
 
Duration of stable disease: Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
 
13.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
Adverse event data collection and reporting which are required as part of every clinical trial, are 
done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in future 
studies using similar agents.  Adverse events are reported in a routine manner at scheduled times during a trial.  (Please follow directions for routine reporting provided in the Case Report Forms 
for this protocol).  Additionally, certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner to 
allow for optimal monitoring of patient safety and care.  The following sections provide information about expedited reporting. 
  
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) whether the patient has received an investigational or commercial agent; 2) whether the adverse event is considered serious; 
3) the grade (severity); and 4) whether or not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6716].  
 
An investigational agent  is a protocol drug administered under an Investigational New Drug 
Application (IND). In some instances, the investigational agent may be available commercially, 
but is actually being tested for indications not included in the approved package label. 
 
Commercial agents are those agents not provided under an IND but obtained instead from a 
commercial source. The NCI, rather than a commercial distributor, may on some occasions 
distribute commercial agents for a trial.  
 
13.1 Steps to Determine If an Adverse Event Is To Be Reported In an Expedited Manner  
 
Step 1 : Identify the type of adverse event using the NCI CTCAE version 5.0. The 
descriptions and grading scales found in the revised CTCAE version 5.[ADDRESS_837933] access to a copy 
of the CTCAE version 5.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be downloaded

THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR [LOCATION_003]GE POLICY   
 
53 
Version Date: 01/31/2019 
from the CTEP website 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm ). 
 
Step 2 :  Grade the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE  version 5.0. 
 
Step 3 :  Review Table A in this section to determine if:  
• the adverse event is considered serious;  
• there are any protocol- specific requirements for expedited reporting of specific 
adverse events that require special monitoring ; and/or  
• There are any protocol- specific exceptions to the reporting requirements.  
 
Note :  This includes all events that occur within [ADDRESS_837934] dose of 
treatment and is attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent(s) must also be reported according to the instructions in th e table 
below. Attribution categories are as follows: Unrelated, Unlikely, Possible, Probable, and Definite.

NOTE:   Investigators MUST  immediately report to the sponsor ANY Serious Adverse Events, whether or not they 
are considered related to the investigational agent(s)/intervention (21 CFR 312.64)  
An adverse event is con sidered serious if it results in ANY  of the following outcomes:   
1) Death  
2) A life -threatening adverse event  
3) An adverse event that results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1328] ≥ 24 
hours  
4) A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
5) A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
6) Important Medical Events (IME) that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. (FDA,

As referenced in the CTEP Adverse Events Reporting Requirements, an AE that resolves and then recurs 
during a subsequent cycle does not require CTEP -AERS reporting unless (1) the Grade increases; or (2) 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_99205].  
 
13.2 When to Report an Event in an Expedited Manner  
 
• Some adverse events require notification within 24 hours  (refer to Table A) to NCI via 
the web at http://ctep.cancer.gov (telephone CTEP at: [PHONE_101] within 24 hours of 
becoming aware of the event if the CTEP -AERS 24 -Hour Notification web -based 
application is unavailable) and by [CONTACT_99243]. Once internet 
connectivity is restored, a [ADDRESS_837939] be entered electronically 
into CTEP- AERS by [CONTACT_433].  
 
• When the adverse event re quires expedited reporting, submit the report within 5 or 7 
calendar days  of learning of the event (refer to Table A).  
 
• Expedited AE reporting for this study must only use CTEP -AERS (Adverse Event 
Expedited Reporting System), accessed via the CTEP home page https://eapps-
ctep.nci.nih.gov/ctepaers.  
13.3 Expedited Reporting Methods  
 
13.3.1  CTEP -AERS Reporting 
To report adverse events in an expedited fashion use the CTEP Adverse Event  
Reporting System (CTEP-AERS) that can be found at http://ctep.cancer.gov. 
A CTEP -AERS report must be submitted electronically via the CTEP- AERS 
Web -based application located at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protoc olDevelopment/adverse_effects.htm.

13.4 Definition of Onset and Resolution of Adverse Events  
  
Note:  These guidelines below are for reporting adverse events on the COG case report 
forms and do not alter the guidelines for CTEP- AERS reporting.  
 
13.4.1  If an adverse event occurs more than once in a course (cycle) of therapy only the most severe grade of the event should be reported.  
 
13.4.[ADDRESS_837940] (most severe) grade 
of the Adverse Effects.  
 
13.4.4  The resolution date of the AE is defined as the date at which the A E returns to 
baseline or less than or equal to Grade 1, whichever level is higher (note that the 
resolution date may therefore be different from the date at which the grade of the AE 
decreased from its highest grade).  If the AE does not return to baseline  the resolution 
date should be recorded as "ongoing."   
 
13.4.[ADDRESS_837941] be reported each 
course it recurs.  
 
13.5 Other Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_6681]  
 
13.5.1  Events that do not meet the criteria for CTEP- AERS reporting ( Section 13.2
) should 
be reported at the end of each cycle using the forms provided in the CRF packet (See 
Section 14.1 ). 
 
13.5.[ADDRESS_837942] reports and supporting documentation to the Study Chair, to the FDA (when COG holds the IND) and to the pharmaceutical company (for industry-
sponsored trials).

oversight of the patient.  
 
13.6 Reporting Secondary AML/MDS  
All cases of  acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) that 
occur in patients following their chemotherapy for cancer must be reported to the 
Investigational Drug Branch (IDB) of the NCI Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) via CTEP- AERS and included as part of the second malignant neoplasm reporting 
requirements for this protocol (see data submission packet).  Submit the completed CTEP -
AERS report within 14 days of an AML/MDS diagnosis occurring after protocol treatment 
for cancer.

Version Date: 01/31/2019 
 Seconda ry Malignancy :  
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy ( e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary 
malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.  
CTEP requires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an NCI IND/IDE be reported via CTEP -AERS. Three options are available to 
describe the event:  
1) Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., acute myelocytic leukemia [AML])  
2) Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
3) Treatment -related secondary malignancy.  
 
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol. 
Second Malignancy :  
A second malignancy  is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT 
a metastasis from the initial malignancy).  Second malignancies require ONLY routine 
reporting via CDUS unless otherwise specified. 
 
13.7 Reporting Pregnancy, Pregnancy Loss , and Death Neonatal  
When submitting CTEP -AERS reports for “Pregnancy”, “Pregnancy loss”, or “Neonatal 
loss”, the Pregnancy Information Form should be completed and emailed to the ADVL1515 COG Study Assigned Research Coordinator along with any additional medical information ( Appendix III
). The potential risk of exposure of the fetus to the investigational 
agent should be documented in the “Description of Event” section of the CTEP -AERS 
report. 
 
13.7.1  Pregnancy  
• Patients who become pregnant on study risk intrauterine exposure of the 
fetus to agents which may be teratogenic. For this reason, pregnancy occurring on study or within [ADDRESS_837944] dose of study 
therapy should be reported in an expedited manner via CTEP -AERS as  
Grade 3 “Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions - Other 
(Pregnancy)” under the “Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions ” 
System Organ Class ( SOC ). 
 
• Pregnancy should be followed until the outcome is known.
 If the baby [CONTACT_6796] a birth defect or anomaly, then a second CTEP -AERS report is 
required. 
 
13.7.2  Pregnancy Loss (Fetal Death)  
• Pregnancy loss is defined in CTCAE as “Death in utero.” 
 
•  Any pregnancy loss  should be reported expeditiously, as Grade 4  
“Pregnancy loss” under the “Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal 
conditions ” SOC . Do NOT report a pregnancy loss as a Grade 5 event 
since CTEP -AERS recognizes any Grade 5 even t as a patient death.

Version Date: 01/31/2019 
 
13.7.3  Death Neonatal  
• Neonatal death, defined in CTCAE as  “Newborn deaths occurring 
during the first 28 days after birth ” that is felt by [CONTACT_628766]/intervention, should be 
reported expeditiously. 
 
• A neonatal death should be reported expeditiously as Grade 4 “Death 
neonatal” under the “General disorders and administration” SOC when 
the death is the result of a patient pregnancy or pregnancy in partners 
of men on study . 
 
• Do NOT report a neonatal death resulting from a pregnancy or pregnancy 
in partners as a Grade 5 event since CTEP -AERS recognizes any Grade 5 
event as a patient death.  
 
Pregnancy should be followed up until the outcome of the pregnancy is known at intervals deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_6795]. The “Pregnancy Information Form” should be used 
for all necessary follow-ups. This form is available at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/PregnancyRepo

Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations and National Cancer Institute (NCI) policy require all 
individuals contributing to NCI -sponsored trials to register and to renew their registration annually.  To 
register, all ind ividuals must obtain a Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) Identity and Access 
Management (IAM) account ( https://ctepcore.nci.nih.gov/iam ).  In addition, persons with a registration 
type of Investigator (IVR), Non- Physician Investigator (NPI[INVESTIGATOR_6731]), or Associate Plus (AP) (i.e., clinical site 
staff requiring write access to OPEN, RAVE, or TRIAD or acting as a primary site contact) must complete 
their annual re gistration using CTEP’s web -based Registration and Credential Repository (RCR) 
(https://ctepcore.nci.nih.gov/rcr).  Documentation requirements per registration type are outlined in the table below.

CTSU Registration Procedures  
 
This study is supported by [CONTACT_6818] (CTSU).  
 IRB Approval:   
Each investigator or group of investigators at a clinical site must obtain IRB approval for this protocol 
and submit IRB approval and supporting documentation to the CTSU Regulatory Office before they can 
be approved to enroll patients.  Assignment of site registration status in the CTSU Regulatory Support 
System (RSS) uses extensive data to make a determination of whether a site has fulfilled all regulatory 
criteria including but not limited to the following: 
• An active Federal Wide Assurance (FWA) number  
• An active roster affiliation with the Lead Network or a participating organization 
• A valid IRB approval 
• Compliance with all protocol specific requirements. 
 
In addition, the site- protocol Principal Investigator (PI) must meet the following criteria:  
• Active registration status  
• The IRB number of the site IRB of record listed on their Form FDA 1572 
• An active status on a participating roster at the registering site.  
 Sites participating on the NCI CIRB initiative that are  approved by [CONTACT_110693]. For sites using the CIRB, IRB approval information is received from the CIRB and applied to the RSS in an automated 
process. Signatory Institutions must submit a Study Specific Worksheet for Local Context (SSW) to the CIRB via IRBManager to indicate their intent to open the study locally.  The CIRB’s approval of the 
SSW is then communicated to the CTSU Regulatory Office.  In order for the SSW approval to be 
processed, the Signatory Institution must inform the CTSU which CIRB-approved institutions aligned 
with the Signatory Institution are participating in the study. 
 
Requirements for ADVL151 5 Site Registration:  
 
• IRB approval (For sites not participating via the NCI CIRB; local IRB documentation, an IRB-signed 
CTSU IRB Certification Form, Protocol of Human Subjects Assurance Identification/IRB 
Certification/Declaration of Exemption Form, or combination is accepted ) 
• For applicable studies with a radiation and/or imaging (RTI) component, the enrolling site must be aligned to a RTI provider.  To manage provider associations access the Provider Association tab on 
the CTSU website at https://www.ctsu.org/RSS/RTFProviderAssociation
, to add or remove 
associated providers.  Sites must be linked to at least one IROC credentialed provider to participate on trials with an RT component. Enrolling sites are responsible for ensuring that the appropriate 
agreements are in place with their RT I provider, and that appropriate IRB approvals are in place.

6 1. Introduction  
1.1 Demographics, Natural History and Previous Treatments  
B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is one of the most common types of 
leukemia diagnosed in the [LOCATION_002] (1). The median age at diagnosis is 60 
years old with a 2:1 male to female sex ratio (82,83). Most patients are 
diagnosed incidentally during routine blood work. For protocol study purposes, 
the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Working Group on CLL recommends an 
absolute lymphocyte count threshold value of >  5,000/ µl (2). Laboratory 
diagnosis is achieved through demonstration in the blood smear of “mature” 
appearing small lymphocytes and immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_546582]- expression of CD5 and B cell markers with dim expression of surface 
immunoglobulin. (2)  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_546583] 10- year life expectancy in early stage patients, CLL 
remains an incurable illness (3 -6). Patients progressing onto or diagnosed with 
more advanced stage CLL have a median survival between 18 months to 3 years. Patients with low -risk, early stage CLL can be followed closely, as there is 
no survival benefit associated with early intervention (6). With disease symptoms or progressive cytopenias, patients previously were treated with oral alkylating agents with or without prednisone (7- 11). Responses to alkylating agents are not 
durable, and only rarely are associated with morphologic complete remission. With the clinical introduction of the purine analogs (pentostatin, cladribine and 
fludarabine), treatment of CLL has changed from primary alkylators as front line 
treatment to purine analogs as front line treatment ( 12,13).  
1.2 Biochemistry of Purine Nucleosides  
2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2- CDA) and pentostatin (deoxycoformycin, DCF), 
analogs of the naturally occurring deoxypurine nucleoside, deoxyadenosine 
(dAdo), are effective for the treatment of CLL (13,14,15,24,87). Their primary 
mechanism of action is promoting the intracellular accumulation of 
deoxynucleotides by [CONTACT_546620] (ADA), an 
enzyme that normally degrades deoxypurine nucleotides. Inhibition of adenosine deaminase leads to the accumulation of metabolites inhibiting ribonucleotide 
reductase. This leads to a depletion of the nucleotide pool with resultant inhibition 
of DNA synthesis.  
1.2.[ADDRESS_715118] 
purine analog to enter clinical trials in CLL (13,14).  Cladribine (15) 
and fludarabine (16- 19) were introduced in the clinic soon after and 
yielded impressive clinical results in alkylator -refractory CLL.  
Specifically, treatment with fludarabine yields a 31 -57% response rate 
in alkylator -resistant CLL patients, and a 63- 79% response rate in 
untreated patients (88).  The addition of prednisone did not add significant benefit (19).  These data have elevated fludarabine to an 
acceptable front -line therapeutic option in the treatment of 
symptomatic CLL.  Monoallelic p53 gene deletion (detected in 12% of CLL patients) is predictive for nonresponse to therapy with purine analogs (fludarabine) and poor survival (96).  Likewise, 17p deletion Rev. 1/14  
ECOG -ACRIN  E2903 
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: April 25, 2014 
 NCI Update Date: May 25, 2011 
7 (17% of patients) is also associated with resistance to purine analogs, 
which may be overcome with alemtuzumab therapy (97).  
1.2.2  Pentostatin trials were not subjected to extensive schedule 
optimization despi[INVESTIGATOR_546584].  Extensive 
phase I evaluation was performed (20) and these early studies were notable for remarkable inter -patient variability in toxicity, especially at 
high doses given for five days.  Significant renal, pulmonary, and central nervous system (CNS) toxicity was encountered (21 -24).  
Patients with indolent lymphoid malignancies developed 
lymphocytopenia at doses producing little toxicity, such as 5 mg/m
2/d 
for 2 days or 4 mg/m2 every 1 or 2 weeks. In addition renal 
insufficiency and poor performance status were predictive of toxicity, 
even at lower doses of pentostatin (4 mg/m2).  In the phase II studies 
using 4 mg/m2 weekly or less frequently, the incidence of mild, 
reversible creatinine elevation was less than 5%, and no patient 
developed overt renal failure.  CNS toxicity appeared to be schedule-
dependent, and could develop with repeated low doses in patients 
with normal renal function (21).  Early clinical trials also revealed 
adenosine deaminase inhibition resulted in immunosuppression, and may increase the patient’s risk of infection during the treatment period 
(89).  Additional side effects include reversible hepatitis, 
keratoconjunctivitis, nausea, and vomiting (24- 26).  
1.2.[ADDRESS_715119] study, conducted by [CONTACT_27746] B (CALGB) 
(24), 36 evaluable patients were treated with pentostatin at a dose of 
4mg/m
2 three times per week, and then every other week.  Among 
these patients, ten (26%) demonstrated a response: 1 complete response and 9 partial responses. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) phase II study (25) 
showed 7 of 26 patients (27%) developed a partial response.  In a 
study of 17 CLL patients at the Royal Marsden Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 35% 
achieved a response (26). Toxicities documented in these phase II 
studies with pentostatin show most patients tolerated the treatment 
well, with mild nausea and vomiting and minor skin rashes being the 
most common complaint.  The most significant toxicity was infection.  These included bacterial as well as opportunistic infections that are 
known to occur in patients receiving purine analog therapy.  Virtually 
all infec tious complications occurred within six weeks of initiating 
therapy with pentostatin. There was worsening of anemia and thrombocytopenia in 23% and 26% of patients, respectively.  This was more frequent in those patients who had very low hemoglobin levels 
and platelet counts when they started treatment. Neither of the two 
large multicenter trials reported any nephrotoxicity. Three patients 
(7%) developed grade 3 -4 CNS toxicity in the CALGB study, while no 
such adverse events were reported in the other studi es.

8 1.3 Purine Analogs in Combination Chemotherapy of CLL 
Preclinical justification of combining pentostatin and cyclophosphamide comes 
from a report by [CONTACT_546621] (27) where CLL cells  were incubated in 
vitro with an alkylating agent and a nucleoside analog. The cyclophosphamide 
analog, 4- hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4 -HC), which does not require 
microsomal activation and is converted to the same alkylating agent was utilized.  
This study demonstrated that combination therapy with 4- HC, pentostatin,  and 
deoxyadenosine produces at least additive cell kill in vitro . Preclinical data 
demonstrated that a combination of a DNA damaging agent (cyclophosphamide) 
can synergize with the nucleoside analogs fludarabine, pentostatin, or cladribine.  Recent report s demonstrated significant activity of a combined pentostatin-
cyclophosphamide regimen (28 -31). Previously treated patients were required to 
have “high- risk” or “active intermediate risk” disease. Weiss et al. recently 
published the results of a Phase II study of pentostatin (4mg/m
2) and 
cyclophosphamide (600- 900 mg/m2) in twenty -three previously treated patients 
with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Therapy was administered every three 
weeks. The response rate was 77% in fludarabine- refractory patients. There 
were four complete responses. Grade 3/4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were seen in 35% and 30% respectively. There was relative sparing of 
thrombopoiesis (1/23 patients with a platelet count > 20,000 x 10
6/L required 
platelets). All patients received filgastrim, sulfamethioxazole/trimethaprim, and 
acyclovir prophylactically (31). Fludarabine and cyclophosphamide combinations 
have been developed with similar efficacy (32- 34). Previous combinations of 
fludarabine and chlorambucil demonstrated efficacy but  significant toxicity 
(35,36).  
1.[ADDRESS_715120] the highes t reported success 
rates to date (37 -49). In contrast, rituximab is directed at a B- cell 
specific antigen and therefore is associated with much less immunosuppression. While initial studies of the chimeric anti -CD20 
antibody rituximab demonstrated disappointing results in small -cell 
lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) and CLL (41 -43), subsequent studies 
directed at overcoming the adverse pharmacokinetic parameters have led to improving efficacy in this disease (40).  Down- regulation of mcl -
[ADDRESS_715121] patients irrespective of response (49).  
As pre -treatment mcl -[ADDRESS_715122] therapy (e.g. alkylator and purine analog -based therapy), 
combination approaches with rituximab appear warranted.

9 1.4.2  CAMPATH- 1H Therapy with CLL 
CAMPATH- 1H is a humanized antilymphocyte monoclonal antibody 
(MAB) engi neered by [CONTACT_546622] (CDR) into a human 
immunoglobulin variable framework region (51).  It is one of a series 
of MABs directed against the CD52 surface antigen, expressed on 
lymphocytes at nearly all stages of differentiation.  
The Campath- 1 antigen (designated CD52 by [CONTACT_546623] 1989) is a 
heavily glycosylated, non -modulating glycoprotein of molecular weight 
21-28kD which in humans is predominantly expressed on peripheral 
blood lymphocytes, monocytes, and macrophages. It is estimated that peripheral blood lymphocytes have approximately 5x10
5 antibody 
binding sites per cell (52). Antibodies raised against this antigen efficiently ly se lymphocytes in the presence of human complement. 
However, they do not appear to lyse monocytes (53).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  In the three Phase I trials (001,002,003) by [CONTACT_546624] (BW), CAMPATH- 1H showed evidence of 
activity in patients with CLL, especially in reducing the number of circulating leukemia cells, splenomegaly and bone marrow infiltration. Many patients entering these trials 
had previously received treatment with alkylators and/or 
fludarabine. In two Phase II studies (005 and 009), 
CAMPATH- 1H produced a response rate (based on intent 
to treat analysis) of 33% in 76 patients, including 42 who 
were previously treated with fludarabine (91- 95). 
Of the 16 major responses (50% or greater reduction in disease), 8 occurred in patients with CLL or prolymphocytic 
leukemia (PLL). Forms of non -Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL) 
in which responses were observed included small 
lymphocytic lymphoma (2 cases), lymphoplasmacytoid 
follicular (1 case), small cleaved cell (1 case), diffuse small 
cleaved cell (2 cases), diffuse mixed cell (1 case), and 
mycosis fungoides (2 cases).  
The majority of patients experienced at least 50% reduction of high lymphocyte count. Clearance of bone 
marrow infiltration and reduction in splenomegaly was also achieved in a number of patients. CAMPATH -1H had l ess 
effect in reducing lymphadenopathy, particularly bulky areas, possibly due to poor access of the antibody to sites 
of bulky disease and inadequate effector mechanisms at 
such locations.  
Rawston et al reported on 10 patients with CLL who were 
refractor y to conventional therapy, including fludarabine, 
who were treated with CAMPATH -1H (54). The regimen 
was [ADDRESS_715123] rec eived a full 
ECOG -ACRIN  E2903 
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: April 25, 2014 
 NCI Update Date: May 25, [ADDRESS_715124] patients experienced some minor infusion-
related symptoms, such as rigors, during therapy. While 
Campath- 1H is active in the treatment of CLL, the 
immunosuppression produced by [CONTACT_546625] (47 -49). 
Osterborg et al have published efficacy and safety results for previously treated CLL patients (45). Twenty -nine 
patients who had relapsed after an initial response (n=8) or were refractory (n=21) to chemotherapy were treated with 
CAMPATH- 1H 30 mg administered as a 2- hour IV infusion 
three times weekly for a maximum of 12 weeks. Of them, 8 
had been previously treated with chlorambucil and 
prednisone only, 3 with prior fludarabine, 14 with CHOP or 
similar regimens, and 7 with various single- agents. There 
was 1 CR and 11 PRs,  for an overall 42% (95% CI: 23% -
61%) response rate. Three of the 8 patients (38%) with a relapse and 9 of 21 refractory patients (43%) responded to 
CAMPATH- 1H therapy. CLL cells were rapi[INVESTIGATOR_546585] 28 of 29 patients (97%). CR in the bone 
marrow was obtained in 36% and splenomegaly resolved completely in 32%. Lymphadenopathy was normalized in 
only 2 patients (7%).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Bowen et al reported on the subcutaneous administration of CAMPATH -1H in fludarabine- resistant/relapsed CLL and 
B-PLL (46).   Seven patients with B -cell leukemia (6 with 
CLL and 1 with B -PLL) were treated with CAMPATH -1H 
subcutaneously (SC) three times a week for 6- 12 weeks. 
The initial dose was 10 mg with further injections of 30 mg given on an outpatient basis. Previously, four of the 
patients were resistant to fludarabine and three had a PR before relapsing. The patient with B- PLL achieved a CR 
and three of the CLL patients achieved a PR (two of these patients were retreated). The three remaining patients 
were non- responders.  Three patients were transfusion 
dependent before CAMPATH- 1H, and all three became 
transfusion independent after treatment. Cytomegalovirus 
(CMV) reactivation occurred in 3/7(43%).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Lundin et al. recently updated the experience of the 
Karolinska group utili zing subcutaneous administration of 
CAMPATH- 1H for previously untreated patients with CLL 
(55).  CAMPATH -1H was administrated three times a week 
(TIW) subcutaneously for 12 -18 weeks to forty -one 
patients the majority of whom had advanced disease. The initial dose was 3 mg, but was escalated rapi[INVESTIGATOR_332936] 30 
mg/ml/TIW. The medication was self -administered at home 
after week 2. Acyclovir, fluconazole, co- trimoxazole, and 
allopurinol were given concomitantly. Responses were seen in 81% of the patients (17% CR, 64 % PR). Although 
overall response by [CONTACT_546626] -ACRIN  E2903 
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: April 25, 2014 
 NCI Update Date: May 25, 2011 
11 (79-97%), the medication was most successful in blood 
and least successful in lymph nodes.  The maximum 
response in blood was rapid, those in nodal, splenic, and marrow less rapid. Most side effects occurred as “first dose 
reactions”. Non- hematologic side effects, apart from fever, 
were significantly reduced by [CONTACT_546627]. Systemic reactions included rigors (17%), 
fever (68%), and fatigue (3 patients – grade II-III). No 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_546586]/urticaria, bronchospasm, hypotension, or nausea were observed. Local skin reactions (88% of patients) were grade 0- II and generally disappeared during 
continued CAMPATH -1H treatment. These consisted of 
erythema/edema, pruritis,  and slight pain. However, three 
patients were withdrawn from the study because of severe local reactions (pain) or systemic symptoms (fever, fatigue). Hematologic toxicity was still significant with 21% 
of patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_546587]. Five patients (13%) developed two or more epi[INVESTIGATOR_546588] a “few” injections 
of G-CSF.  No patients developed febrile neutropenia.

(MRD), suggested that CLL patients with higher levels of residual disease may require higher doses of CAMPATH-1H to eradicate disease and that detectable plasma levels 
of CAMPATH -1H may be necessary for achieving CR (98). 
The dose of CAMPATH -1H on the present study is 
considerably higher and, hopefully, will overcome 
resistance to eradication of MRD.

12 1.5 Combination of Chemotherapy and Immunotherapy of CLL  
1.5.1  CALGB performed a randomized phase I I trial of sequential versus 
concurrent rituximab (50). All patients fulfilled the NCI definition of B -
CLL and requirement for therapy. Patients on the sequential arm 
(fludarabine then rituximab) received fludarabine (25 mg/m2 dl-d5 
repeated monthly x6) induction followed by [CONTACT_4124] (375 mg/m2 
repeated weekly x4). Patients on the concurrent arm (fludarabine and 
rituximab) received therapy identical to the sequential arm except 
rituximab (375 mg/m2) was also administered (day 1 and 4 of cycle 1; 
day 1 of cycles 2 of 6) with fludarabine induction therapy. A total of 
[ADDRESS_715125] been enrolled. Fludarabine plus rituximab induction 
toxicity included neutropenia (grade 3 or 4, 77%), thrombocytopenia 
(grade 3 or 4, 20%) and infection (grade 3 or 4, 18%). Fl udarabine 
induction toxicity included neutropenia (grade 3 or 4, 41%), thrombocytopenia (grade 3 or 4, 12%), and infection (grade 3, 21%). There was no increase in the frequency of opportunistic infections 
noted in the concurrent (15%) versus the sequential arm (26%). 
Overall consolidation was tolerated well in both arms. Response data 
using the NCI criteria are:

The FCR combination (fludarabine 25 mg/m2/d x3), 
cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m2/d x3, rituximab 375 mg/m2/day 1) 
was recently reported to induce 67% CR, 19%nPR, and 18% PR in  
[ADDRESS_715126] was performed on bone marrow at the end of therapy 
(usually 6 cycles) using CD5+ 19+ coexpression. None of the 
MRD negative patients by [CONTACT_937] -PCR have had a clinical or flow 
relapse (57).  
1.5.[ADDRESS_715127] recently begun a study of pentostatin, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (PCR) as a collaborative effort with the James Cancer 
Center (Ohio State) for patients with untreated B -cell chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma. Toxicity has been modest. Weiss et al (personal communication) have treated 
approximately 23 previously treated patients (MSKCC; Cleveland Clinic). A full analysis of response and toxicity has not been 
published. However, one patient suffered grade 5 pulmonary toxicity 
(MSKCC) and several patients were removed from study at the 
Cleveland Clinic.  No further details are available.  Data on the use of 
pentostatin and rituximab have been published in abstract form.  
There were 19/60 patients (low grade (NHL)) with the diagnosis of 
small lymphocytic lymphoma. Specific responses in this group were not published. However, there was a 70% overall response 
percentage. There were two deaths on study (COPD, TTP). Toxicities 
ECOG -ACRIN  E2903

13 included neutropenia (6%), fever, shingles, headache (3.3%), anemia, 
atrial fibrillation, bronchospasm, chills, dehydration, febrile 
neutropenia, hypotension, mucositis, pneumonia, increased SGOT, and vertigo (1.7%)(93).  
 
 
1.6 Rationale For Current Clinical Study  
We wish to combine an effective combination chemotherapy regimen that is 
associated with a high complete response rate with immunotherapy (Rituximab 
and CAMPATH -1H) for chemosensitization and eradication of minimal residual 
disease (MRD). Multiparameter immunophenotypic analysis detecting aberrant phenotypes has been successful as a probe to detect MRD and will be used as 
part of this study (see Section 2
.0)(96). These results appear similar to 
quantitative molecular monitoring utilizing allele- specifi c oligonucleotide PCR 
(ASO -PCR) (97).  The combination of fludarabine and rituximab has 
demonstrated promising results, but a high rate of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia 
(56). Similarly, addition of rituximab to the fludarabine/cyclophosphamide 
combination pi[INVESTIGATOR_546589] (57,58).  CAMPATH- 1H in combination with 
fludarabine has shown significant activity in refractory CLL (59). Rituximab has been combined with pentostatin in a Phase 2 study (61). The results have been 
published in abstract form (61,93). Of 54 evaluable patients, 18 (33.3%) achieved 
an objective response 5.5% CR, 3.7% CRn, 16.7% PR, 7.4% nPR.  Response rates were similar in previously treated and untreated patients (33.4% and 33.3% 
respectively). Grade ≥ 3 toxicities occurred in 27 patients (neutropenia (29%), 
febrile neutropenia (1.6%), leukopenia (8.1%), thrombocytopenia (5.3%), 
pulmonary (3.2%), gastrointestinal (3.2%), and infection (3.2%)). One death was 
reported as “treatment -related pneumonia”. The preliminary results of the 
combination of pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab in previously treated patients have been communicated to us (Weiss, personal communication), but have not been officially analyzed. Toxicity is described in 
Section 
1.5.[ADDRESS_715128] been combined demonstrating significant activity (61,62). As discussed in 
Sections [IP_ADDRESS]  and [IP_ADDRESS] , the SC administration of CAMPATH- 1H would 
appear to have a better therapeutic index with less side effects.  Therefore, its incorporation in this study would likely result in less adverse events than might be expected with IV administration. For those patients who achieve a partial 
response or progress on therapy, a conventional course of CAMPATH -1H (18 
weeks) may offer a reasonable option for response and clinical benefit, as there are few treatment alternatives in the setting of third line options. In conjunction 
with this unique combination therapy, we hope to examine a variety of relevant correlative endpoints (detailed in the following sections) that will allow us to 
distinguish features of leukemic cell biology that relate to resistance and patient 
outcome to the chemoimmunotherapy of our clinical protocol. Rev. 7/07

14 1.7 Ratio nale for Ancillary Studies  
We intend to study critical biologic events in the CLL cells of patients entered 
onto this protocol. Cytogenetic analysis of CLL cells has been undertaken by [CONTACT_546628], overal l 
prognosis, and sensitivity to therapy (65- 67, 75- 81). 
We will also determine the Ig variable region sequence of the CLL B cells in 
order to determine if they are either germline or somatic mutation type clones. 
This is relevant since recent data (63- 66) demonstrates CLL patients with 
germline type clones have a worse clinical outcome compared to somatic mutation type clones. In addition to the apparent predictive value of lg V heavy chain region sequence to clinical outcome, the germline clones had geneti c 
defects that were dissimilar from the somatic type clones. A retrospective 
analysis on frozen CLL cells for patients entered on 3 North Central Cancer 
Treatment Group (NCCTG) clinical trials has shown a trend towards longer time 
to progression for CLL pa tients with somatic type clones compared to germline 
type clones (66). We will examine the presence of germline or somatic type 
clones and evaluate this combination of genetic data to clinical outcomes on this 
trial. Genetic analysis for determination of therapeutic efficacy of monoclonal 
antibodies (67,69) will be incorporated in these studies. The techniques for Ig V 
heavy chain region sequencing have been established at the Mayo Clinic (66).  
We have recently determined that abnormal angiogenesis exists in B -CLL (68).  
Increased marrow blood vessels appear to be positively associated with increasing stage of disease.  The mechanism for this abnormal angiogenesis is 
unclear but preliminary work by [CONTACT_546629]-
and anti -angiog enic factors. The balance of these two types of vascular growth 
factors are likely to be critical to the induction of tumor related angiogenesis. 
However we have also shown that CLL B cells express mRNA for VEGFR1 and 
VEGFR2 (vascular endothilial growth factor receptor) thus raising the possibility 
of an autocrine pathway for VEGF (vascular endothilial growth factor receptor) 
that could impact on CLL B cells. The levels of pro and anti- angiogenic factors in 
CLL patients progressing through this clinical protocol will be studied. The 
change in both the levels and ratios of angiogenesis factors will be compared to 
their clinical responses.  
Since CLL patients have deficient T cell repertoire with the expanded CLL B cell clone it is important to know if this immunodeficiency parameter can be restored 
with therapy. We are particularly interested in knowing if the extent of T cell 
repertoire deficiency and changes induced by [CONTACT_546630]/or toxicities of the treated CLL patients. Therefore we 
intend to study the T cell repertoire by [CONTACT_546631].  
Recent studies have been able to identify patients who are poorly responsive to CAMPATH- 1H (69) and these studies will be incorporated into the protocol.  
Theoretically, relapse of CLL after treatment evolves from the proliferation of 
“minimal residual disease (MRD)” progenitors. Techniques established for the 
detection of M RD (70 -74) will be incorporated into these studies. These will 
include flow cytometric and real- time PCR assays.

response rate of pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and 
rituximab (PCR) in patients with previously treated B- cell 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  To assess the presence of minimal residual dis ease (MRD) 
at the completion of the PCR regimen and after Campath-
1H in patients who achieve a CR or nPR.  
2.1.2  Secondary Objectives  
[IP_ADDRESS]  To evaluate the toxicity of the combined therapy, PCR with 
CAMPATH- 1H, in patients with previously treated B -CLL.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  To evaluate the  overall survival and progression- free 
survival of patients treated with pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab with CAMPATH -1H 
(PCR  CAMPATH- 1H). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  To evaluate the number of patients who after PCR (or 
during PCR for PD), only achieve a PR, SD, or PD and 
who subsequently convert to a higher response category after Campath- 1H. 
2.2 Laboratory Objectives  
2.2.1  To assess the angiogenic profile (i.e. secretion levels of pro versus anti-angiogenic molecules) (100) of CLL B cell clones as well as bone 
marrow angiogenesis (i.e. vascular density by [CONTACT_9064]) (68)
 at baseline, after PCR, after Campath- 1H, every six months 
(serum only), and at time of response assessment (marrow).  
2.2.2  To determine the V H gene mutation status and CD38 expression of 
the B -CLL clones at study entry and at the end of the therapy and 
assess the association between the VH gene mutation status and CD38 expression and clinical outcome.  
2.2.3  To acquire surface phenotype (by [CONTACT_4133]) and genetic defects 
(by [CONTACT_546633]) (99) information on CLL- B cell clones. This latter 
information will be studied for association with clinical outcome. 
2.2.4  The T cell status will also be monitored by [CONTACT_546634] T cell deficiency induced by [CONTACT_546635]. This latter information will be studied for association with

circulating lymphocytes is noted, close attention to the possibility of acute t umor 
lysis  should occur. As treatment with 
rituximab may result in acute but temporary 
reduction in platelets, patients with baseline 
platelet counts ≤ 20,000/ µL should receive 
platelet transfusion prior to rituximab 
therapy. Patients should be encouraged to drink abundant fluid prior to the first

There are no safe guidelines for administration of pentostatin in patients with 
a creatinine clearance of < 30 ml/min.  This 
will be the minimum clearance for patien ts 
on this study and so any patients whose 
clearance is < 30 ml/min will discontinue 
protocol therapy.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Patients who suffer grade 4 toxicity unrelated to the leukemia, using the CTCAE, will be removed from study. 
This may occur either during the PCR phase or during Campath- 1H consolidation (or treatment for PR, PD and 
SD patients). This includes allergic manifestations, blood and bone marrow suppression unrelated to the leukemia, 
and cardiovascular, dermatologic, renal, gastrointestinal 
and neurologic events. For grade 4 infection/febrile neutropenia, removal from study will be left to the 
discretion of the investigator. If a patient develops grade [ADDRESS_715170] been implicated. Myelosuppression and 
drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia should resolve 
once the CAMPATH -1H is stopped (up to four weeks for 
recovery). If immune- mediated thrombocytopenia (I TP) 
occurs, more aggressive measures are to be taken (as 
have been reported) and these are left to the discretion of 
the investigators. Once thrombocytopenia resolves, 
independent of the mechanism, further administration of 
CAMPATH- 1H will be decided upon by [CONTACT_546639]- Chair ([CONTACT_546671] and [CONTACT_546672]).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  The toxicity profile in the two studies (Weiss et al; Kay et 
al) in which PCR has been used has been modest (see 
1.5.2). There has been one grade 5 pulmonary toxicity in 
the Weiss study and several patients were removed from study ( no further details available). The maximum toxicities 
in the Kay study were grade [ADDRESS_715171] phase. Nonetheless, the study toxicity 
monitors will be notified of any grade 5 event who will then 
recommend either continuation or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_68660]. In the studies utilizing the subcutaneous administration of the 
drug, discontinuation during therapy has been reported. Rev. 12/05, 5/06  Rev. 1/09

30 Discontinuation, however, did not result from grade 4 
neutropenia (13%), but rather from severe local reactions 
(pain) or systemic symptoms (fever, fatigue). Therefore, it is unlikely that the consolidation phase will be prematurely 
stopped. The main concern on this study is that of microbial infection, particularly CMV reactivation. In view of 
this, surveillance for CMV will be undertaken at the 
beginning of each cycle of PCR and every two weeks 
during CAMPATH -1H. Discovery of reactivation, either 
because of a clinical syndrome or a laboratory finding, will 
result in cessation of therapy and treatment of the CMV. A 
decision to resume therapy after treatment of a CMV event 
is the responsibility of the principle investigators. If less 
than grade 4 toxicity has been documented, the protocol may be resumed. If grade 4 toxicity occurs the patient will be removed from study.  
5.1.4  Supportive Care Treatment  
[IP_ADDRESS]  All supportive measures consistent  with optimal patient 
care will be given throughout the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  For step 1:  All patients must receive daily allopurinol (300 
mg/day PO) unless they are allergic and should be well 
hydrated before the first cycle of PCR treatment is started. 
All patients will be given PO allopurinol 300 mg/day from 
day 0 to day 14 (a total of 15 days) for the first month of 
therapy. Use of allopurinol after this period is discouraged unless the patient has been on this medication chronically. 
The duration of allopurinol and the need for allopurinol 
beyond the first cycle is left to the discretion of the treating 
physician.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  For step 1 and step 2:  Bactrim DS 1 BID on 
Monday/Wednesday/Friday AND acyclovir 800 mg po BID (or equivalent, including gancyclovir and valgancyclovir) 
during chemoimmunotherapy (PCR) and immunotherapy 
(CAMPATH- 1H) and for 6 months after completion of this 
chemoimmunotherapy protocol. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  For step 1 and step 2:  During the induction phase (step 1), 
G-CSF 300 mcg for patients < 70 kg and 480 mcg for 
patients >  [ADDRESS_715172] chemo, Q 4 weeks. At the start of the consolidation (CR, nPR) phase, the absolute neutrophil number is expected to be > 1,000 x 10
6/L. Patients will not be given 
G-CSF or neulasta routinely unless neutropenia (< 1,000 x 
106/L) is documented during the weekly follow -up studies. 
G-CSF or neulasta may be started and maintained to 
achieve an absolute neutrophil number of > 1,000 x 106/L. 
In the case of G -CSF or neulasta it can be stopped with Rev. 12/05  
Rev. 5/06  Rev. 7/07

31 two consecutive neutrophil counts of > 1,000 x 106/L. For 
those patients receiving CAMPATH- 1H as salvage (PR or 
PD), the absolute neutrophil number at the start  of therapy 
may be less than 1,000 x 106/L and G -CSF or neulasta is 
recommended to maintain the absolute neutrophil number 
> 1,000 x 106/L during the CAMPATH -1H administration.(If 
neutropenia persists beyond day 12, G -CSF should be 
continued until the ANC is > 1 x109/L for 2 consecutive 
blood counts.  G-CSF may be discontinued prior to day 12 
if ANC is > 1x 109/L for 2 consecutive blood counts.)  
[IP_ADDRESS]  For step 2:  Although no fatal toxicity has been seen with 
SC administration of CAMPATH- 1H, life -threatening and 
fatal CMV disease has been reported with Campath- 1H 
therapy, especially when Campath- 1H was used following 
nucleoside analogs.  
Development of rapid methods to diagnose CMV infection 
before onset of clinical disease has been the main focus of 
attention in stem cell transplantation. The frequency of 
infection after cytotoxic therapy utilizing purine analogs 
and immunologic targets warrants a similar approach. In the transplant setting, older age, the use of purine analogs 
or monoclonal antibodies directed agai nst T -cells and 
seropositivity prior to transplantation, are important risk factors for CMV disease and are likely to be operative in 
the elderly prior -treated CLL population. Various 
methodologies have been used to diagnose infection. The 
shell vial cultu re technique coupled with 
immunofluorescence assays enables diagnosis within several days. Broncheoalveolar lavage has a sensitivity 
and specificity of 90%. Blood tests including CMV pp65 antigenemia and PCR techniques detect virus in the blood 
several weeks before onset of disease, but the former can 
be quite subjective.  
Attempts to prevent infection will depend upon the serologic status of the patient prior to immunosuppressive 
therapy. For seronegative patients, CMV negative blood 
products, if needed, are recommended. In seropositive patients, prophylactic use of gancyclovir in the transplant 
setting has been successful in preventing clinical infection. 
We do not propose to use this latter strategy in the present 
protocol. Rather, each patient will remain on acyclovir 
prophylaxis for the total treatment time and for six months thereafter. Pre- emptive therapy, by [CONTACT_546640]- 1H, will be used. For purposes of this study, 
testing will be pe rformed at the beginning of each cycle of 
PCR and every two weeks during CAMPATH -1H, utilizing 
the current methodology at each center (either pp65 
antigenemia or CMV DNA by [CONTACT_546641]). CMV serology must

duration of therapy. The protocol at each center will be 
used. Therapy will be interrupted during this period of time. Once monitoring determines absence of active infection, 
both therapy and continuing monitoring will be resumed.  
5.1.5  The potential for toxicity during the induction and consolidation/salvage phases demands prophylactic antibacterial, 
antifungal and antiviral therapy, monitoring for viral occurrence and provision for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_546592]. Prophylactic antibacterial 
and antiviral therapy are discussed in Sections 5.1.4
. CMV 
reactivation during both the induction and consolidation/salvage phase will be monitored and verified by [CONTACT_546642] (86).  
5.2 Step 2 (Arm B and Arm C): CAMPATH -1H

those patients who have achieved only a PR or SD (or PD) after the PCR regimen. The duration of allopurinol administration will be left to the discretion of the investigator.  
5.2.2  For those patients achieving a confirmed CR or nPR, they will be 
registered to receive CAMPATH -1H (Arm B). When the patient is 
registered to Arm B, the drug will be administered three times a week for four weeks. The dose will be 30 mg per dose. A twelve- week 
treatment -free period will elapse before CAMPATH -1H begins 
following completion of PCR for Arm B patients. Patients will be assessed with physical examination, CBC, chemistries, and CMV 
monitoring (see Section 7
). 
For those patients not achieving a CR or nPR (thus patients have either achieved PR, SD, or PD), CAMPATH -1H (Arm C) will be 
administered three times a week for eighteen weeks at a dose of [ADDRESS_715175] PD during treatment with PCR do not need to complete all 6 cycles of PCR to go on to Arm C, however, completing a minimum of

by [CONTACT_546643] (day 1).  The dose will be 
increased to 10 mg on day 3 and then raised to 30 mg on day 5. If >

be administered according to the discretion of the investigator. Additional therapy will be left to the discretion of the treating physician 
but should not include corticosteroids. 
5.2.5  During the period of CAMPATH -1H administration, anti -infective 
prophylaxis is essential. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim) DS 
1 (BID) Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and acyclovir 800 mg BID 
will be administered for the 4- week and 18 -week course of treatment 
and for six months after completion of treatment. For patients allergic 
to Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim), Dapsone may be used 
instead at a dose of 100 mg PO QD.  
5.2.6  F or those patients entering the consolidation phase in CR or nPR, the 
absolute neutrophil number is expected to be above 1,000 x10
6/L. 
Patients will not be given G -CSF (or neulasta) routinely unless 
neutropenia ( ≤ 1,000 x106/L) is documented during the week ly follow -
up studies. G -CSF (or neulasta) may be started and maintained to 
achieve a neutrophil number >  1,000 x106/L. For those patients 
receiving CAMPATH- 1H in PR, SD, or during PD (salvage phase), the 
absolute neutrophil number may be less than 1,000 x106/L and G -
CSF (or neulasta) is recommended to maintain the neutrophil number > 1,000 x10
6/L during the CAMPATH -1H administration.  
5.2.7  Although grade 4 toxicity, other than myelosuppression is not expected to occur during the CAMPATH -1H administration, the 
following side effects should be considered by [CONTACT_546644]:  prolonged neutropenia, severe febrile course, severe eczema and the appearance of 
autoimmune phenomena (thyroiditis, anemia, thrombocytopenia).  
5.2.8  There will be no dose modification for CAMPATH- 1H. However, if 
grade 4 non- hematologic  toxicity occurs due to CAMPATH -1H the 
investigator may remove the  patient from study if the risks outweigh 
the benefits (see 5.2.7). Grade  [ADDRESS_715177]

34 5.3 ADVERSE EVENT  REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
5.3.1  Purpose  
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as 
part of every clinical trial, are done to ensure the safety of patients 
enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in future studies 
using similar agents. Adverse events are reported in a routine manner 
at scheduled times during a trial (please refer to the E2903 Forms 
Packet for the list of forms with directions for routine adverse event 
reporting). Additionally, certain adverse events must be reported in an 
expedited manner for more timely monitoring of patient safety and care. The following sections provide information about expedited 
reporting.  
5.3.2  Determination of reporting requirements  
Reporting requirements may include the following considerati ons: 1) 
whether the patient has received an investigational or commercial agent; 2) the characteristics of the adverse event including the grade 
(severity), the relationship to the study therapy (attribution), and the 
prior experience (expectedness) of the  adverse event; 3) the phase 
(1, 2, or 3) of the trial; and 4) whether or not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_60778].  
Commercial agents are those agents not provided under an IND but 
obtained instead from a commercial source. The NCI, rather than a 
commercial distributor, may on some occasions distribute commercial 
agents for a trial.  
Steps to determine if an adverse event is to be reported in an 
expedited manner : 
Step 1:  Identify the type of event:  The descriptions and grading 
scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.[ADDRESS_715178] access to a copy of the CTCAE 
version 4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be 
downloaded from the CTEP web site 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
Step 2:  Grade the event using the NCI CTCAE  version 4.0 . 
Step 3:  Determine whether the adverse event is related to the

All cases of second primary cancers, including acute myeloid 
leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), that occur 
following treatment on NCI -sponsored trials must be reported to 
ECOG -ACRIN: 
• A second malignancy is a cancer that is UNRELATED to any 
prior anti -cancer treatment (including the treatment  on this 
protocol).  Second malignancies require ONLY routine reporting 
as follows:  
1. Submit a completed Second Primary Form within [ADDRESS_715186] 
[LOCATION_011], MA [ZIP_CODE] 
2. Submit a copy of the pathology report to ECOG -ACRIN 
confirming the diagnosis.  
3. If the patient has been diagnosed with AML/MDS, submit a 
copy of the cytogenetics report (if available) to ECOG -ACRIN  
• A secondary  malignancy is a cancer CAUSED BY [CONTACT_13127] -
cancer treatment (includ ing the treatment on this protocol). 
Secondary malignancies require both routine and expedited reporting as follows:  
1. Submit a completed Second Primary Form within [ADDRESS_715187] 
[LOCATION_011], MA [ZIP_CODE] 
2. Report the diagnosis via CTEP -AERS at http://ctep.cancer.gov

4. If the patient has been diagnosed with AML/MDS, submit a 
copy of the cytogenetics report (if available) to ECOG -ACRIN 
and NCI/CTEP.  
NOTE:  The Second Primary Form and the CTEP -AERS report 
should not  be used to report recurrence or development of 
metastatic disease.  
NOTE:  If a patient has been enrolled in more than one NCI -
sponsored study, the Second Primary Form must be 
submitted for the most  recent trial. ECOG -ACRIN must be 
provided with a copy of the form and the associated Rev. 1/14

6.1 Assessment of Clinical Response 
The major criteria for determination of the response to therapy in patients with B -
CLL include physical examination and evaluation of peripheral blood and bone 
marrow (if evaluating for CR). It is recommended that the laboratory and physical exam findings, which are abnormal prestudy, be repeated to document the 
degree of maximal response.  
Measurements of the largest palpable  lymph nodes  (provide measurements on a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_715195] nodes but no more than 5) should be selected at 
baseline to be followed for response. These lymph nodes should be clearly measurable in two perpendicular dimensions and should be selected from each 
of the following sites, if involved: cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, inguinal, 
femoral.

period, or if the bone marrow biopsy shows evidence of disease, the 
response will be PR.

8.1 Cyclophosphamide  
8.1.1  Other Names  
Cytoxan, Neosar, CTX, CPM  
8.1.2  Classification  
Cyclophosphamide is a prodrug biotransformed to active alkylating 
metabolites by a mixed function microsomal oxidase system.  
8.1.3  Mode of Action 
Cyclophosphamide metabolites are thought to disrupt cell division 
primarily by [CONTACT_12783] -linking DNA strands.  Cyclophosphamide is 
considered cell cycle phase non-specific. 
8.1.4  S torage and Stability  
Injectable powder are stored at room temperature 25°C (77°F). The 
temperature is not to exceed 30°C (90 F°). Reconstituted parenteral 
solutions are stable for 24 hours at room temperature for 6 -14 days if 
refrigerated.  
8.1.5  Dose Specifics  
600 mg/m2/day on day 1 of weeks 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, and 21.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dosage in Renal or Hepatic Failure  
Cyclophosphamide dosage adjustment for patients with 
renal or hepatic failure has not been adequately evaluated.  
8.1.6  Preparation  
Dissolve the 100 mg, 200 mg, 500 mg, 1 gm, and 2 gm vials in 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 ml of sterile water, respectively, resulting in a solution 
of 20 mg/ml.  Shake vials vigorously and warm slightly in lukewarm 
water to facilitate dissolution.  The lyophilized form is more easily 
solubilized.  
Reconstituituted solutions may be further diluted in D5W, D5W/NS, 
D5W/Ringer’s Injection, Lactated Ringer’s Injection, and ½ NS.

57 8.1.10  Side Effects  – Please refer to package insert.  
Side effects vary significantly based on the specific dose and duration 
of cyclophosphamide.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Incidence More Frequent (> 5%)  
1. Anemia, leukopenia (usually asymptomatic; less 
frequently fever and/or chills)  
2. Thrombocytopenia (usually asymptomatic; less 
frequently  unusual bleeding or bruising; black tarry 
stools; blood in urine or stools; pi[INVESTIGATOR_394741]). Nadir counts usually occur 7 to 12 days after 
administration and recovery usually compete by [CONTACT_4475] 17 to 21.  
3. Alopecia 
4. Anorexia, nausea and vomiting 
5. Gonadal suppression (azoospermia, missed menstrual periods) resulting in infertility. Return of normal gonadal 
function and fertility occurs with time in many younger 
men and women.  
6. Hemorrhagic cystitis  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Incidence Less Frequent (1- 5%) 
1. Stomatitis  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Incidence Rare (1%)  
1. Anaphylaxis (tachycardia, shortness of breath, wheezing, tightness in throat)  
2. Flushing or redness of face 
3. Diarrhea 
4. Skin rash 
5. Pneumonitis or interstitial pulmonary fibrosis  
6. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone  (siadh)  
7. Chemical phlebitis (redness, swelling or pain at site of injection)  
8. Secondary malignancies  
9. Blurred vision, cardiac toxicity presenting as congestive heart failure 
10. Hemorrhagic myocarditis  
11. Cardiac necrosis  
12. Pericarditis (seen wit h high dose regimens used with 
bone marrow transplantation)  
8.1.11  Drug Interactions  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Digoxin  
Several studies conducted in lymphoma patients receiving 
combination chemotherapy including cyclophosphamide 
revealed a 20–50% reduction in digoxin absorption when 
ECOG -ACRIN  E2903 
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: April 25, 2014 
 NCI Update Date: May 25, 2011 
58 digoxi n tablets were administered.  When digoxin capsules 
were administered no significant decrease in digoxin 
absorption occurred.  To avoid decreased serum digoxin 
levels the use of digoxin in liquid form (liquid or capsules 
containing liquid digoxin) instead of tablets is 
recommended.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pentostatin 
Two case reports describe fatal cardiac toxicity in patients 
receiving cyclophosphamide  6.4 g/m² over 4 days and 
pentostatin 4 mg/m² over 4 hours on day 3.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Succinylcholine  
Cyclophosphamide may prolong the effects o f 
succinylcholine by [CONTACT_546650].  Limited clinical observations and in 
vitro  studies suggest that prolonged apnea might result 
when  succinlycholine is administered to some patients 
also receiving cyclophosphamide. Management options 
include avoiding concurrent therapy or if concurrent therapy can not be avoided, to monitor for prolonged 
succinlycholine effect in patients receiving both drugs. If 
cyclophosphamide has been administered within [ADDRESS_715224] 
should be informed of the potential for succinylcholine-
induced apnea and appropriate precautions and 
monitoring should be implemented. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Trastuzumab  
In early clinical trials the concurrent administration of cyclophosphamide and trastuzumab increased the 
incidence and severity of cardiac dysfunction.  Until 
additional data from clinical trials demonstrate the safety of 
concurrent use of these drugs concurrent administration is 
not recommended.  
8.1.12  Nursing/Patient Implications  
1. Monitor CBC, platelet count.  Advise patients of increased risk of infection with absolute neutrophil count less than 500 cells/mm³ 
and increased risk of bleeding with platelet counts less than 
20,000 cells/ mm³.  Advise patients to call the clinic if they develop a fever above 101°F or notice any easy bruising,  petechiae 
(pi[INVESTIGATOR_394741]), or prolonged bleeding. 
2. Advise patient of possible alopecia.  Instruct how to obtain wig, hairpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959], etc.  
3. Assess hydration and fluid balance.  Patients receiving larger doses should force fluids up to [ADDRESS_715225] patients to void more

59 frequently to minimize occurrence of hemorrhag ic cystitis.  For 
high-dose therapy MESNA may be used.  
4. Premedicate with antiemetics.  
5. Observe for possible phlebitis at injection site.  
6. Administer antiemetics as indicated.

8.2.2  Classification  
Adenosine deaminase inhibitor (antimetabolite).  
8.2.3  Mode of Action 
Adenosine deaminase (ADA) is an enzyme that is essential for the 
metabolism of purine nucleosides. Pentostatin irreversibly inhibits 
ADA activity resulting in intracellular accumulation of adenosine and 
ECOG -ACRIN  E2903

 NCI Update Date: May 25, 2011 
60 deoxyadenosine, leading to cell death.  Other proposed mechanisms 
of cytotoxicity include depletion of adenosine triphosphate (reducing 
cellular  energy levels and cyclic adenosine monophosphate 
formation), incorporation of the triphosphate of pentostatin into DNA, and formation of DNA strand breaks.  
8.2.4  Storage and Stability  
Unreconstituted drug vials are stored in the refrigerator.  Reconstituted solutions (2 mg/ml) are chemically stable at room 
temperature for at least 72 hours.  Dilute solutions (10 mg/500 ml) are chemically stable at room temperature for 24 hours in 5% dextrose, 
48 hours in normal saline or lactated Ringer's.  Refrigerated solutions are chemically stable for at least 96 hours.  
8.2.5  Dose Specifics  
4 mg/m²/day on day 1 of weeks 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, and 21. 
8.2.6  Preparation  
The 10 mg vial is reconstituted with 5 ml of normal saline, resulting in 
a 2 mg/ml solution.  The desired dose is further diluted to 
concentrations of 1 mg/ml or less in normal saline, lactated Ringer's or 5% dextrose.  
8.2.7  Administration  
Pentostatin is usually administered by [CONTACT_375831], over 2 minutes or 
longer. Patients should be hydrated with 500- 1000 ml fluid (D5W, 
0.5NS, or equivalent), prior to administration, and another [ADDRESS_715227].

NSC# 687451.  
8.3.2  Classification  
Antibody.  
8.3.3  Mode of Action 
Rituximab is a chimeric murine/human gamma 1 kappa monoclonal 
antibody (Chinese hamster ovary [CHO] transfectoma).  It recognizes 
the CD20 antigen expressed on normal B cells and most malignant B -
cell lymphomas.  It binds with high affinity to CD20- positive cells, 
performs human effector functions in vitro , and depletes B cells in 
vivo.  The Fab domain of rituximab binds to the CD20 antigen on B-

cell depletion in peripheral blood, lymph nodes, and bone marrow.  
8.3.4  Storage And Stability  
Rituximab vials are stored at refrigerated temperatures 2Ε to 8Ε C 
(36Ε to 46Ε F). Protect vials from direct sunlight.  Diluted drug product 
at a concentration of 0.5 to 4 mg/ml in polyvinylchloride or polyolefin 
IV bags containing normal saline or dextrose 5% can be stored for up 
to 24 hours at 2Ε  to 8ΕC, and at room temperature for an additional 
12 hours.  
8.3.5  Dose Specifics  
375 mg/m2 on weeks 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, and 21. Cycle 1 (week 1) dose 
varies. Please see Section 5.1 for specific doses and dosing 
procedures for Cycle 1.  
8.3.6  Preparation  
Withdraw the necessary amount of rituximab and dilute to a final 
concentration of 1 to 4 mg/ml into an infusion bag containing either 
0.9% Sodium Chloride or 5% Dextrose in Water. Gently invert the bag 
to mix the solution. Caution should be taken during the preparation of the drug, as shaking can cause aggregation and precipi[INVESTIGATOR_394742].  
8.3.7  Administration  
Rituximab is administered intravenously. An in- line filter is not 
required. The initial rate is 50 mg/hr for the first hour. If no toxicity is 
seen, the rate may be escalated gradually in 50 mg/hour increments 
at 30 -minute intervals to a maximum of 300mg/hr.  If the first dose is 
well tolerated, the initial rate for subsequent dose is 100mg/hr, increased gradually in 100 mg/hr increments at 30 -minut e intervals, 
not to exceed 400 mg/hr. If the patient experiences fever and rigors, the antibody infusion is discontinued. The severity of the side effects 
should be evaluated. If the symptoms improve, the infusion is continued initially at one- half the previous rate. Following the antibody 
infusion, the intravenous line should be maintained for medications as needed. If there are no complications after one hour of observation, 
the intravenous line may be discontinued.  
Oral pre -medication (two 325 mg tablets  of acetaminophen and 50 to 
100 mg diphenhydramine) may be administered [ADDRESS_715229] available local practices and procedures.  
The use of dexamethasone or other glucocorticoids should be discouraged.

WARNINGS:  
General :  Rituximab is associated with hypersensitivity reactions 
which may respond to adjustments in the infusion rate. Hypotension, 
bronchospasm, and angioedema have occurred in association with 
rituximab infusion as part of an infusion- related symptom complex. 
Rituximab infusion should be interrupted for severe reactions and can be resumed at a 50% reduction in rate when symptoms have completely resolved. Medications for the treatment of hypersensitivity 
reactions, e.g., epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], antihistamines and corticosteroids should 
be available for immediate use in the event of a reaction during 
administration.  
Cardiovascular :  Infusio ns should be discontinued in the event of 
serious or life- threatening cardiac arrhythmias.  Patients who develop 
clinically significant arrhythmias should undergo cardiac monitoring 
during and after subsequent infusions of rituximab.  Patients with 
preexis ting cardiac conditions including arrhythmias and angina have 
had recurrences of these events during rituximab therapy and should be monitored throughout the infusion and immediate post -infusion 
period.

number of cases.  
Hepatitis B Virus:  Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation with fulminant 
hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death has been reported in some

Infections resulting from CAMPAT H-1H induced immunosuppression 
are the major type of adverse event occurring outside the CAMPATH -
1H administration period.  The most commonly reported infections are 
mucocutaneous herpes simplex, CMV, and candidiasis.  If a patient 
develops a serious infection while receiving CAMPATH -1H, therapy 
should not be administered until complete resolution of the infection. 
CAMPATH- 1H may then be reinstituted at the previous dose.  
CAMPATH- 1H is contraindicated in those patients who are 
hypersensitive to this drug or  its components.  CAMPATH -1H is 
contraindicated in patients who have serious infections. CAMPATH -

68 9. Statistical Considerations 
9.1 Primary Endpoints  
The primary endpoints of this Phase II trial of PCR followed by [CONTACT_503205] -1H in 
previously treated B- CLL patients are i) to determine the response (CR, nPR, 
PR) rate of PCR in all patients treated with PCR, and ii) to determine the rate of 
molecular complete remission (MCR) after the treatment of CAMPATH -1H in 
patients who achieve a CR or nPR.  
Patients who achieve a CR or nPR, minimal residual disease (MRD) will be 
assessed using both flow cytometry and real -time allele specific oligonucleotide 
polymerase chain reaction (RT -PCR), and response will be further categoriz ed 
as clinical CR or nPR (CCR) with flow positive, CCR with flow negative but RT -
PCR positive, or CCR with flow negative and RT -PCR negative (MCR).  
Response to PCR will be assessed prior to the administration of CAMPATH- 1H, 
and MCR will be assessed post PCR administration, post CAMPATH -1H 
administration, and at [ADDRESS_715238] status will be monitored every three months.  
The study is a two- stage design for the response endpoint. PCR will be 
considered promising in this patient population if a true response rate of 50% or greater and not worthy if less than a 30% response rate. A total of 100 eligible 
patients will be entered in this study: [ADDRESS_715239] stage, the study will be 
terminated. If 10 or more patients achieve a response, the study will proceed to 
the second stage, accruing an additional 74 patients to yield a total of 100. If 35 
or more responses are observed after the second stage, then PCR will be 
considered promising. Conversely, if less than 35 patients respond, then PCR 
will not be recommended for further investigation. 
With this design, the probability of terminating the study after 26 patients is 0.77 if 
the true but unknown response rate is 30%, but 0.08 if the true but unknown response rate is 50%. The probability of concluding the regimen effective is 0.92 
if the true response rate is 50% and 0.08 if the true response rate is 30%.

69 To investigate whether CAMPATH -1H eliminates minimal residual disease 
(MRD) in CR or nPR, MRD will be assessed by [CONTACT_546652] -PCR 
as described above. The proportion of pre- to-post treatment improvement in 
response will be estimated as (total number of samples with a MCR at [ADDRESS_715240] CAMPATH -1H) divided by (total number of samples  of any changes in 
response), and whether this proportion is different from the random chance improvement 0.5 will be tested using McNemar's test. Assuming the study 
proceeds to the second stage and at least [ADDRESS_715241] treatment improvement to MCR given any change in response.  
In the study of previously untreated B -CLL patients at Mayo clinic, about 50% of 
patients in the CR or nPR group presented a MCR after PCR and prior to 
CAMPATH- 1H. Based on this information, we assume that about 30% of 
previously treated B- CLL patients in the CR or nPR group will have a MCR prior 
to CAMPATH -1H, and an additional 30% or more patients will achieve a MCR at 
[ADDRESS_715242]

approximately 73% power. Alternatively, if there are [ADDRESS_715244] CAMPATH -1H, there will be approximately 91%

9.2 Accrual  
Accounting for 10% ineligibility, the overall accrual goal will be 110 patients. The 
previous ECOG study in this patient population (E4996) accrued poorly. 
However, the proposed chemoimmunotherapy, PCR+CAMPATH -1H, is very 
different from the regimen used in E4996 (VAD+PSC) and appears promising in 
literature. Mayo clinic, an ECOG -ACRIN member institution, sees 4 -5 previously 
treated B -CLL patients per month. Putting this together, we anticipate that the 
accrual rate will be approximately 60- 70 patients per year and the accrual will be 
completed in 1.5 years.  
Although the study is expected to encounter no accrual problem, the feasibility of achieving the accrual goal will be monitored closely. If accrual rate is slower (30 
or fewer patients per year) than anticipated, the study will be reviewed for early 
termination.

71 9.3 Early Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_546603] a cooperative setting, all toxicities 
will be monitored closely and reported usi ng ECOG -ACRIN's standard AE 
mechanism.  
The tolerability of the proposed regimen will be initially tested in the first [ADDRESS_715246] 50 patients for CAMPATH- 1H separately. Since 
there will be an 8 week treatment -free period between PCR and CAMPATH -1H 
treatment, we assume that PCR related toxicities and CAMPATH- 1H related 
toxicities will be independent.  
We will consider PCR or CAMPATH- 1H tolerable if 30% or less grade 3 or higher 
regimen related toxicity and intolerable if 50% or higher . If, in the first 30 patients 
treated with PCR, we observe 13 or more patients with grade 3 or higher PCR related toxicity, the study will be terminated to further accrual. With this design, 
the probability of terminating the study early is 0.08 if the true but unknown rate 
of grade 3 or higher toxicity is 30%, and the probability of terminating the study early is 0.82 if the true but unknown rate of grade 3 or higher toxicity is 50%.  
Toxicity profile for CAMPATH- 1H will be evaluated for CR or nPR and for  PR or 
less response separately since CAMPATH- 1H will be given for [ADDRESS_715247] a PR or less response. Of these 15 patients with CR or nPR, if we observe 8 or more patients with grade 
3 or higher CAMPATH -1H related toxicity, the study will be terminated to further 
accrual. With  this design, the probability of terminating the study early is 0.05 if 
the true but unknown rate of grade 3 or higher toxicity is 30%, and the probability of terminating the study early is 0.5 if the true but unknown rate of grade 3 or 
higher toxicity is 50%.  
Of the 35 patients with PR or less response, if we observe 16 or more patients with grade 3 or higher CAMPATH -1H related toxicity, the study will be terminated 
to further accrual. With this design, the probability of terminating the study early 
is 0.0 4 if the true but unknown rate of grade 3 or higher toxicity is 30%, and the 
probability of terminating the study early is 0.75 if the true but unknown rate of grade 3 or higher toxicity is 50%.  
9.4 Secondary Endpoints  
Overall survival (OS) and progression- free survival (PFS) will be assessed for all 
patients and by [CONTACT_115188]. OS is defined as the time from registration 
until death from any cause. PFS is defined as the time from registration until 
induction failure, institution of non- protocol therapy, relapse or death from any 
cause in the absence of relapse. OS and PFS will be calculated using the Kaplan- Meier method, and confidence limits will be calculated using the 
Greenwood formula.  
For about 70 patients who do not achieve CR or nPR, response will be re-assessed every three months to examine whether CAMPATH -1H improves their 
response and the rate of conversion to a higher response category (call it "improvement") at 1 -year from study entry will be estimated. With 70 eligible 
ECOG -ACRIN  E2903 
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: April 25, 2014 
 NCI Update Date: May 25, 2011 
72 patients, if we observe 12 or more patients with improvement, CAMPATH -1H will 
be considered promising in this patient population. Deaths without improvement 
of response prior to re -assessment will be regarded as no improvement. With this 
design, the probability of concluding CAMP ATH-1H promising is 0.96 if the true 
but unknown improvement rate is 25% and 0.04 if the true but unknown improvement rate is 10%. This decision rule is calculated using an exact binomial 
distribution.  
9.5 Laboratory Endpoints  
The goal of this laboratory study  is to investigate new biologic parameters with 
utility as risk stratification parameters (FISH, CD38 expression, IgVH mutational 
status and angiogenesis profiles). Statistical plans for all laboratory correlative 
studies are based on the assumption that t he study will proceed to the second 
stage and complete with 100 eligible patients. 
9.5.1  To investigate the association between angiogenesis profiles and 
clinical outcome, serum levels of VEGF and bFGF, secreted levels of both pro- and anti -angiogenic factors fr om purified CLL B cells and 
levels of bone marrow angiogenesis will be assessed at study entry and after treatment. Descriptive statistics (mean, STD, median, range, 
frequency) will be reported for each pro - (e.g., bFGF, VEGF) or anti -
angiogenic (e.g., Thr ombospondin- 1,) factor. In the report of Kay et al. 
(100), the mean VEGF levels were 6.6 pg/ml (+/ - 3.2) for high- risk B -
CLL patients (n=11, Rai stage 3 -4) and 2.4 pg/ml (+/ - 0.7) for low -risk 
B-CLL patients (n=18, Rai stage 0), and the mean bFGF levels were 
337.9 pg/ml (+/ - 254.5) for high- risk patients and 72.1 pg/ml (+/ - 25.6) 
for low -risk patients. However, there seem to be little difference in the 
median levels of these angiogenic factors between two patient cohorts (see Figure 2 in Kay et al, 2000). On the contrary, in the unpublished 
manuscript of Kay et al. (Angiogenic Status of Blood B Cells in B -
CLL), the mean VEGF levels were 3.9 (+/ - 3.8) for Rai stage 3 -4 
(previously treated patients), 3.2 (+/ - 3.4) for Rai stage 1 -2, and 12.4 
pg/ml (+/ - 14.8) f or Rai stage 0 (previously untreated patients), and 
the mean bFGF levels were 7.5 pg/ml (+/ - 2.6) for Rai stage 3 -4, 10.4 
pg/ml (+/ - 7.2) for Rai stage 1 -2, and 11.6 pg/ml (+/ - 3.9) for Rai  
stage 0.  
Having this information in mind, we will assess each pro - or anti -
angiogenic factor separately before and after the treatment and investigate in a cooperative setting whether the angiogenic factors are associated with clinical outcome and whether the treatment affects the 
level of each angiogenic factor. Assuming about 30 patients will be in 
the CR or nPR group and 70 in the PR or less response group, there 
will be approximately 84% power if the mean difference in VEGF level 
at baseline between these two groups is 2 pg/ml with standard deviation of the difference 3, and 92% power if the difference is 3 
pg/ml with standard deviation of the difference 4. This power 
calculation is based on the asymptotic power of the Wilcoxon- Rank -
Sum test for normal treatment difference alternative at two- sided 
significance level of 0.05.  
ECOG -ACRIN  E2903 
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: April 25, 2014 
 NCI Update Date: May 25, [ADDRESS_715248] treatment difference of each angiogenic factor will be 
evaluated in each response group. If the mean VEGF levels are 6 
pg/ml at baseline and 4 pg/ml post treatment for patients who achieve a CR or nPR, there will be approximately 93% power to detect this 
pre-to-post difference in VEGF level if the standard deviation of the 
difference is 3 and approximately 83% power if the standard deviation of the difference is 3.5. This power calculation is based on the 
Wilcoxon signed -rank test at  the two- sided 0.05 significance level, 
using PROC IML in SAS with 10,000 simulations.  
When data are available, correlation analysis will be performed to explore potential relationship between anti - and pro- angiogenic 
factors, the association between angiogenesis profiles and clinical outcome will be summarized descriptively, and logistic regression 
analysis and a survival model will be performed to assess the 
association further.  
9.5.2  The IgVH gene mutation status will be assessed at study entry and 
the relationship between IgVH mutation status and clinical outcome 
will be investigated. It is anticipated that approximately 40% of 
patients will have IgVH gene mutation (99) at study entry and these 
patients will show better prognosis. With 100 eligible patients, t here 
will be approximately 85% power for detecting a 32% difference in 
response rate if response rates are 69% for patients with mutation 
and 37% for patients without mutation, and 79% power if response 
rates are 68% and 38%, respectively. This power calculation is based 
on Fisher's exact test at a two- sided significance level of 0.05 and 
assumes 50% overall response rate. When data are available, 
whether IgVH gene mutation status is associated with CD38 
expression level will be examined using a 2x2 table analysis and a 
Wilcoxon- Rank -Sum test and whether IgVH gene mutation status and 
CD38 expression level are prognostic factors will be examined using a 
survival model, such as proportional hazards model or cure rate 
model.  
To explore whether CD38 expression level is an independent prognostic marker for B -CLL, CD38 expression will be measured at 
study entry.  The expression level will be analyzed on a continuous scale and will be dichotomized, i.e., CD38+ if CD38 > =30% and 
CD38 - if CD38 < 30% (66). Based on the study of Dewald, et al. (99), 
we assume that about 40% of patients will be CD38+ and 60% will be 
CD38 -. If response rates for these two groups are 31% and 63%, 
respectively, there will be approximately 85% power to detect this difference and 79% power if  32% and 62% response rates, 
respectively. This power calculation is based on Fisher's exact test at 
a two -sided significance level of 0.05 and assumes 50% overall 
response rate. Progression free and overall survival was also reported from small clinical t rials of previously untreated B CLL patients 
(60,86). Conservatively extrapolating their report to previously treated patients, there will be approximately 80% lower if the median progression free survival time is 23 months in the CD38- group and 12 
months  in the CD38+ group, assuming 60 and 40 patients in the 
ECOG -ACRIN  E2903 
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: April 25, 2014 
 NCI Update Date: May 25, 2011 
74 CD38 - and CD38+ group, respectively. This power calculation is 
based on the log- rank test at the two -sided significance level of 0.05 
and assumes exponential survival distribution. 
9.5.3  To investigate whether genetic defects seen in B- CLL patients are 
associated with clinical outcome, the percentage of abnormal nuclei 
with chromosome anomalies, the frequency of anomalies of 
chromosomes 6- , 11-, 12-, 13-, 14- and 17 will be estimated among 
responders and non- responders separately. As described in Dewald, 
et al.(74) a hierarchical risk model of FISH anomalies in B -CLL will be 
used to order anomalies from the most aggressive to the least 
aggressive, and the association between this ordered categorical 
variable and clinical response will be examined using the exact 
Wilcoxon test.  According to Dewald, et al., about 23% of patients with progressive disease falls into a high risk FISH category.  Thus, if 23 
out of 100 eligible patients fall into the high- risk categ ory and the 
clinical response rates are 23% in this high -risk category and 58% in 
the intermediate or low -risk group, there will be approximately 81% 
power to detect this difference.  This power calculation is based on 
Fisher's exact test at a two- sided significance level of 0.05 and 
assumes 50% overall response rate.  Kappa analysis will also be 
performed to assess the agreement between two technologists who 
analyze the interphase nuclei.  
9.5.4  To study whether patients with B -CLL present defects in the T cell 
repertoire (TCR) at study entry and to investigate the impact of the 
proposed chemoimmunotherapy on TCR, peripheral blood samples 
will be collected at pre and post treatment  (after PCR and after 
Campath- 1H for responders and after Campath- 1Hfor non-
responders) and CD3
+ blood lymphocytes will be analyzed by [CONTACT_1603] -
cytometric V β and V α repertoire analysis. The flow -cytometric Vβ and 
Vα analysis uses monoclonal antibodies directed against 18 specific 
Vβ and V α chains in two color flow with either CD4 or CD8 reactive 
monoclonal antibodies,  and it covers 70% of the human T cell 
repertoir e. In the report of a phase 2 trial for previously untreated CLL 
patients at Mayo clinic, dramatic elevations in blood T cell subsets for responding patients were observed and the percent CD3+ was from 
60-86%. Of 11 patients studied in their analysis, the major expansions 
(20-70%) occurred at Vβ3, 7.1, 9, and 17.  Based on this information, 
if there is a 20% difference in a specific V β subfamily or in the percent 
CD3+ between responders (CR+ nPR) and non- responders after 
treatment, there will be a 92% power  to detect this difference if its  
standard deviation is 15%. This power calculation assumes a 30% CR+ nPR rate and is based on Wilcoxon- Rank -Sum test for normal 
group difference alternative at the two- sided significance level of 0.05.

NOTE:  An informed consent MUST be signed prior to the submission of any material 
for any correlative study, including mandatory diagnostic reviews. Samples 
for optional correlative studies should be submitted only from patients who 
have given written consent for  the use of their samples for these purposes.  
NOTE:  Three sample submissions are described for these studies. The collection 
and submission requirements outlined in Section 11.1 are mandatory. 
Samples described in Sections 11.2, and 11.3 are to be submitted from 
patients participating in the optional studies.  
NOTE:  An E2903 Material Submission Form #[ADDRESS_715249] be submitted with each 
submission. All samples, sample treatments, and collection time points are to 
be indicated on the form(s). The original E2903 Material Submission Form 
#1847 should accompany the samples to the central laboratory(ies). Please 
forward a copy of the original form to the ECOG -ACRIN Operations Office - 
[LOCATION_011] (Attn: Translational Sciences) at the same time it is sent to the central 
laboratory.  
11.1 Immunophenotype and Molecular Genetics  
NOTE:  Samples are required for diagnostic review.  
Immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_546604] -up of 
all leukemia patients.  In fact, the diagnosis of leukemia without 
immunophenotypic characterization is no longer acceptable.  ECOG -ACRIN has, 
therefore, developed a model system for antigenic data collection that requests specimens from all patients entered on ECOG -ACRIN leukemia treatment trials 
be studied by [CONTACT_1345] -ACRIN’s Immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_546605]. In 
addition to establishing the leukemia subtype, this centralized testing and data collec tion has allowed that research questions of clinical relevance to be applied 
to a growing database (e.g., definition of prognostically significant antigen expression levels to eventually yield specific treatment subcategories).  
Depending on the study protocol and tissue availability, anti -coagulated (heparin, 
EDTA, ACD) peripheral blood or bone marrow or both are to be submitted to 
ECOG -ACRIN’s Immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_546605].  
In addition to the study of abnormal hematopoietic cells, the focus of research on circulating serum factors in patients with leukemia or myelodysplasia has 
increased. Two tubes of coagulated peripheral blood (red top tubes) are 
requested for future research studies that may aim at identifying pathogenetic, 
diagnostic, or prognostic factors associated with leukemia or myelodysplasia.   
Serum and cells from peripheral blood or bone marrow from patients entered on 
studies of hematologic malignancies are stored in ECOG -ACRIN’s Leukemia 
Tissue Bank for future laboratory studies. The bank provides the scientific 
community a source of leukemia specimens that are collected, processed, and 
maintained following quality control and quality assurance guidelines. The bank 
will accommodate requests from investigators within and outside ECOG -ACRIN 
in a timely and efficient manner, with respect to tissue type, tissue preparation, 
and most importantly, biologic characteristics of specimens.   Rev. 1/09

11.2 FISH Studies (99)  
Chromosomal anomalies detected by [CONTACT_546654]. We believe that these FISH 
detectable chromosome anomalies are associated with other biological features 
in CLL that also have prognostic value such as  antigen expression on leukemic 
B-lymphocytes. The interphase FISH results will be used to classify each patient 
to a FISH risk category for CLL based on 13q - and normal as favorable, and 6q -, 
11q- and/or 17 as unfavorable. We will establish the percentage of abnormal 
nuclei with chromosome anomalies before and after therapy to assess response to therapy. The results will help assess the efficacy of the treatments under 
evaluation in this clinical trial. At the end of the clinical trial, the results of FISH  
will be compared with other laboratory and clinical information in an effort to learn 
more about the biology of CLL. Results will be correlated with clinical 
assessments, outcome, gene expression profiles and other biological 
parameters.  
CLL B -c
ell FISH Analysis:  Analysis by a CLL FISH panel will be done in order to 
determine if the recurring genetic defects seen in B -CLL patients entered onto 
the companion clinical trial are predictive of clinical status and outcome. We will perform FISH studies on blood cells isolated from our patients with CLL. The  "panel FISH test" we have developed is used to detect common chromosome 
abnormalities associated with B -cell neoplasms including B -CLL (99,105). Thus, 
the FISH panel is designed to detect 1) 11;14 translocations that involve cyclin D1 (11q13) and IgH (14q32) loci; 2) deletions of MYB (6q21), ATM (11q23), 
D13S319 (13q14) and P53 (17p13.3); and 3) trisomy 12.  The 11;[ADDRESS_715254] -therapy specimen.  For each

80 interphase nuclei that meet the scoring criteria; thus, a total of [ADDRESS_715255] already determined the normal ranges for 
these probes from data from the normal  controls (99). The results of the panel 
FISH test will be correlated with treatment and all other biological and clinical 
aspects of patients enrolled in this study (see S ection 9.0).

Neupogen® Information  
Reimbursement Support for Neupogen® 
[COMPANY_010], the manufacturer of Neupogen® (Filgrastim), has agreed to provide Neupogen® 
reimbursement assistance through its [COMPANY_010] Reimbursement Hotline for E2903 Phase II 
Randomized Trial of Pentostatin, Cyclophosphamide, Rituximab and CAMPATH -1H for 
Previously Treated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.  
As indicated in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  of the protocol’s treatment plan, Neupogen® should be 
administered at 5 ug/kg/d SC at least 48 hours following the completion of chemotherapy (day 
3) and continued through day [ADDRESS_715265] -nadir ANC > 10,000/mm3. Filgrastim must be 
stopped 48 hours prior to next cycle of chemotherapy regardless of the ANC. The recommended day to start G -CSF is Day 3. These uses of Neupogen
® are within approved FDA 
labeling. However, it is anticipated that some insurers may be reluctant or unable to cover patients treated with Neupogen
® in this trial. [COMPANY_010]’s Reimbursement Hotline is prepared to 
assist in providing up- to-date claims advice for these situations. The Hotline’s services have 
been expanded specifically for this clinical trial and include:  
1. Reimbursement Support :  The Hotline prov ides assistance relating to claims filing and 
appeals, and identification of alternative sources of payment (secondary insurer, state programs, and charity programs).  
2. Claims Support :  The Hotline provides claims appeal support at several different level s, 
including investigating claims denials, preparing the claims appeal, assisting with letters of medical necessity, and providing necessary supporting literature.  
The schema on the following page outlines the options should reimbursement assistance be required.  
SHOULD THE HOTLINE VERIFY THE PATIENT HAS NO INSURANCE OR NEUPOGEN
® IS 
NOT COVERED, THEY WILL COORDINATE WITH AMGEN THE REPLACEMENT OF PRODUCT USED BUT NOT REIMBURSED BY [CONTACT_546666].

Patient Thank You Letter  
We ask that the physician use the template contained in this appendix to prepare a letter  
thanking the patient enrolling in this trial. The template is intended as a guide and can be 
downloaded from the ECOG web site at http://www.ecog.org . As this is a personal 
letter, physicians may elect to further tailor the text to their situation.  
This small gesture is a part of a broader program being undertaken by [CONTACT_1345] -ACRIN 
and the NCI to increase awareness of the importance of clinical trials and improve accrual and follow -through. We appreciate your help in this effort.

Dear [PATIENT SALUTATION],  
 
Thank you for agreeing to take part in this important clinical program. Programs like this 
offer a chance to get the best care while helpi[INVESTIGATOR_546615]. Many questions remain unanswered in cancer. With the help of people like you who participate in these programs, we will achieve our goal of effectively treating and ultimately curing cancer.  
We believe this program will provide you with high quality, thorough care. Your physicians and research staff will maintain very close contact [CONTACT_56150]. This is important 
to allow your physician to provide you with the best care while learning as much as 
possible to help you and other patients. 
On behalf o f [INSTITUTION] and the ECOG -ACRIN Cancer Research Group, we thank 
you again and look forward to helpi[INVESTIGATOR_56109].

1. A decrease in circulating granulocytes is not being considered since it is not a reliable index 
in CLL.  
2. Grades:  1- mild; 2 -moderate; 3- severe; 4- life-threatening. Grade 5 (fatal) toxicity can 
potentially occur at any level of decrease from pretreatment values and will be recorded as such.  
3. If, at any level of decrease the platelet count is ≤ 20,000/ µL, this will be considered grade 4, 
unless the initial platelet count was  ≤ 20,000/ µL in which case the patient is inevaluable for 
toxicity referable to platelet counts.  
4. Baseline and subsequent hemoglobin determinations must be immediately prior to any given transfusions.

Treatment Evaluation  
1. Complete remission (CR) requires fulfillment of all physical exam and peripheral blood criteria for a 
duration of > 2 months. A bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_546617] a complete ( ≤ 30% lymphocytes with no nodules).  
2. Nodular partial remission (NPR) is essentially a patient in who it appeared that CR had been obtained but nodules are present in the bone marrow. It requires fulfillment of all physical exam and peripheral 
blood criteria for CR; however, when the bone marrow is done to confirm CR, nodules  of malignant 
lymphocytes are found.  
3. Partial remission (PR) requires fulfillment of the above noted decrease in circulating lymphocytes, 
regression in adenopathy and/or hepatosplenomegaly, and one other parameter listed above for a duration of > 2 months.

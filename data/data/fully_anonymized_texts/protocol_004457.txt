STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Sample Size Calculation
For the sample size assessment the following assumptions were used :Approximately 40% of patients in 
BAX 855regimen targeting 1 -3% trough level are expected to be bleed free as shown in the ADVATE 
Prophylaxis study and the BAX 855pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397] 261201 . For the BAX 855regimen targeting 
approximately 10% ( 8-12%) trough level, there areno reliable data available. How ever, an increase of 30%
in bleed free patients is considered clinically relevant.
If the above assumptions hold true 48subjects per study group are needed to reject the null hypothesis of no 
difference between the study groups w ith86% pow er. Significance level of the test is targeted at 5% two -
sided level. Assumin g a drop -out rate of close to 10%, and 10 -15% of subjects being non -compliant, 
approximately 116subjects are planned to be randomized betw een the tw o BAX855regimen sin a ratio of 
1:1.

with an extended half -life in the proph ylaxis and treatment of bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] s in 
patients with severe hemophilia A. 
Since the half -life of current FVIII pr oducts is in the range of 1 0-14 hours ,1;2current 
prophy laxis regimens call for infusion of FVIII every  other day  or every  2-3 day s when 
based on each patient’s individual PK profile
.3PEGy lation of FVIII is designed to 
prolong the half -life of FVIII, with the intent of reducing the frequency  of administration 
while maintaining similar therapeutic benefit as existing FVIII products; improving 
patient co nvenience and compliance with therap y; and thereb y improving overall health 
outcomes. Prolongation of half- life of FVIII may  also increase efficacy  by [CONTACT_279506] . 
BAX 855consists of rFVIII protein molecules with covalentl y bound PEG chains linked 
to the protein using a stable linker. The product is reconstituted with sterile water for 
injection (SWFI ) and isadministered intravenously  (i.v.) as a solution by  [CONTACT_279507].
It uses the same stabilizing agents (mannitol, trehalose, histidine and glutathione) as the 
rFVIII product (octocog alfa, ADVATE) from which it is derived. Comprehensive 
preclinical studies as well as two successfull ycompleted stud ies(Baxter clinical study  
261101 and 261201) have shown that the PEGy lation extends both the in vivo half-life 
and the measurable circulating activity  of the product (as determined b y chromogenic and 
1-stage clotting assay s). Physiochemical characterization studies demonstrate that the 
functio
nal activity  of BAX 855is comparable to that of ADVATE. Additional details can 
be found in the BAX 855Investigator ’sBrochure (IB).
No comparator drug product will be used in this study  for prophy laxis or treatment of 
bleeding. Treatment regimens are based on individual PK parameters and FVIII trough 
levels with a target trough level of 1-3% given twice weekl y,orapproximately 10% (8 -
12%) FVIII given every  other day .

Clinical Condition/Indication 
Hemophilia A is an X -chromosome -linked recessive, congenital bleeding disorder caused 
by [CONTACT_279508]. The absence of FVIII 
leads to ‘spontaneous’ bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (occurring primarily  in joints, muscles, and less

Hemophilia A is currently treated with FVIII replacement using either plasma -derived 
(pdFVIII) or rFVIII concentrates.4;5
The intended indication for BAX 855is treatment and proph ylaxisof bleeding in subjects 
with hemophilia A. Theclinical program of BAX 855is in compliance with the

treatment reduced the number of break -through bleeds compared to on -demand 
treatment.9-12;13-16; 17; 18
Current management of severe hemophilia A includes on -demand treatment for bleeding 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_279433] .19; 20A prospective clinical study using 
individually  pharmacokinetic (PK) adjusted prop hylaxis dosing targeting a FVIII trough 
level of 1% can reduce the annualized bleed rate (ABR) from [ADDRESS_341159] proph ylaxis. The optimal prophy laxis regimen is still 
under scientific discussion but the frequency  of br eak through bleedings during 
prophy lactic treatment is assumed to depend on the time spent with a low FVIII level. 
Thus, dose recommendations used in prophy laxis are designed to keep the FVIII trough 
level above 1% of the normal level.21
However, the 1% level is not applicable to prevent bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_279434]. 
Especiall y patients with damaged joints often bleed in spi[INVESTIGATOR_279435] a 1% 
trough level, although this association is difficult to access in clinical practice .22A 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_279436] . has suggested that the annual number of 
bleeds is approaching zero when baseline levels of FVIII ≥ 10% are maintained.23
Although there are no established criteria for determining how man y joint bleeds can be 
tolerated before irreversible damage occurs, some studies reported that more than 2-5 
joint bleeds in total lead to impaired joint scores24-26whereas annual bleed rates between 
0.1 and 2.7 did not lead to joint damage .27-29

6.3Population T o Be Studied
Adolescent and adult subjects (aged 12 - 65 y ears) with severe hemophilia A (FVIII 
< 1%), of all races and ethnic groups, without history  of or currentl y confirmed FVIII 
inhibitors ( ≥ 0.6 BU) will be studied. All subjects will have been previous ly treated with 
pdFVIII or rFVIII concentrates with ≥150 documented exposure day s (EDs)(previous ly 
treated patients; PTP). Subjects receiving prop hylaxis and on -demand treatment will be 
included in this stud yand they  must have had at least 2 documented and treated bleeds within 
the 12 months prior to enrolment . 
Justification for enrollment of adolescent subjects is based on the nonclinical safet y
requirements outlined in the ICH M3 Guideline , Section 12 as well as the ICH E11 
Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the pediatric population. 
Hemophilia is a serious and potentially life-threatening disease. Adolescent subjects , in 
particular if they  are physically  active, are expected to benefit from a new treatment 
approach with target FVIII trough levels of approximately  10% using a new recombinant 
full-length rFVIII molecule with an extended hal f-life. Moreover, results from nonclinical 
repeated toxicology studies, the core safe ty pharmacology  package and the completed 
clinical phase 1 and phase 2/[ADDRESS_341160] not raised a ny safety or tolerability  
concerns. Furthermore, t he parent protein molecule ADVATE, has been used extensively
in the entire pediatric population with no unforeseen adverse events (AEs) (see ADVATE 
Company  Core data Sheet ).
6.4Findings f rom Nonclinical and Clinical Studies
6.4.1 Findings from Nonclinical Studies
BAX 855is manufactured by  [CONTACT_279509] y binding a branched PEG reagent with a 
molecular weight of 20 kDA to Baxter’s rFVIII (octocog alfa, ADVATE). Baxter’s 
octocog alfa is expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by  a plasma/albumin free 
cell culture method and is the active substance in Baxter’ s licensed product ADVATE. 
Thus, the viral safet y of BAX 855is ensured by  [CONTACT_279510] ( ADVATE )bulk drug

Preclinical studies have demonstrated BAX 855to have comparable activity  and other 
biochemical properties to ADVATE. The expec ted prolonged FVIII exposure by  
[CONTACT_279511] 855 was demonstrated in PK studies with a mean residence time (MRT) longer than 
ADVATE in FVIII knock-out- mice (1.6 fold), rats (1.2 fold) and cy nomolgus monkey s 
(1.5 fold). Prolonged efficacy  was shown for BAX [ADDRESS_341161] in human study  (Baxter clinical study  261101) to assess the safet y and 
PK of BAX 855in PTPs age d 18- 65 yearswith severe hemophilia A with ≥150 EDs to 
FVIII products was conducted in Europe and Japan. The study  investigated safet y and PK 
of single doses of 30 IU/kg and 60 IU/kg BAX 855compared to the same dose of 
ADVATE. Su bjects were followed for 28 day s after BAX 855administration for safety . 
Safety  assessments included AEs, changes in vital signs, clinical laboratory assessments, 
and immunogenicit y.
A total of 24 subjects were enrolled; 19 were treated and 18 were evalua ble for PK 
analysis. Nine were treated with 30 IU/kg (Cohort 1) and 10 were treated with 60 I U/kg 
(Cohort 2) of 
BAX 855, including [ADDRESS_341162] detectable titers (ie, 1:20 or 1:40); these 
results could not be anal yzed for specificit y and were therefore interpreted as “low -titer 
indete rminate” . Furthermore, no increases in preexisting antibody  titers were observed 
after BAX 855. There were no thrombosis - associated events or allergic reactions. No 
deaths or other serious adverse events ( SAEs )occurred, and none of the 11 non -serious 
AEs (all mild or moderate) were considered treatment- related. AEs reported following 
BAX 855administration included vomiting, nasophary ngitis, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_40947], influenza- like illness, arthralgia, headache, and localized swelling. No 
signific ant treatment-related changes in laboratory values or vital signs were recorded. 
There were no notable differences in the t ype or rate of AEs experienced by [CONTACT_279512] 855infusion.

on the one -stage clotting assay , the median elimination phase half -life ( T1/2; h) was 
longer for BAX 855than for ADVATE in both Cohort 1 (13.60 vs 9.90) and Cohort 2 
(16.64 vs 11.11). Other PK parameters also supported an improved PK profile for 
BAX 855compared to ADVATE. Refer to the ADVATE Company  Core Data Sheet for 
more details on the clinical experience to date with ADVATE.
Based on these data, BAX 855 appears to be safe and well tolerated after a single d ose 
administration. The mean T 1/2was 1.4 and 1.5- fold higher for BAX 855 compared to 
ADVATE in Cohorts 1 and 2, respectively, demonstrating prolonged circulation of 
BAX 855compared to ADVATE. These data support the use of the BAX 855dosing 
regimens planned in this study .
In phase 2/3 stud y 261201, BAX 855 was found to be safe and well tolerated in all 
137treated subjects, with an accumulated total of 6717 EDs to BAX 855 and 21,803,981 
IU of BAX 855 infused. None of the subjects developed inhibitory  antibodies to FVIII of 
≥0.6 BU/mL  or persistent binding antibodies to FVIII, PEG -FVIII or PEG. No subjects 
developed antibodies to CHO proteins. Binding antibodies that were detected prior to 
exposure to BAX 855 or that transiently  developed during the study  could not be 
correlated to an impaired treatment efficacy , altered PK parameter, or temporally  
associated AE. Based on these data, no increased risk for PTPs with ≥150 EDs to develop 
inhibitory  antibodies to FVIII, no immune responses with a clinical impac t, and no 
evidence of allergic or h ypersensitivity  reactions were observed in this study.
Seven adverse reactions including headache, diarrhea, nausea, and flushing occurred in 
6subjects. All adverse reactions were consistent with the pharmacology  of ADVA TE. 
There were no allergic reactions or deaths related to BAX 855 during the study . Although 
some changes were observed in laboratory
 assessments for liver enz ymes (alanine 
aminotransferase ( ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase ( AST )) these were attributed to 
preexisting disease, in particular to hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection. There were no

8.2Overall Study Design 
This study  is a Phase 3, prospective, randomized, open- label, multicenter study to 
compare the safet y and efficacy  of PK and FVIII trough level -guided BAX 855treatment 
targeting FVIII trough levels of 1-3% or approximately  10% (8 -12%) in a total of 96
evaluable ( 48in each of two study  arms) adolescent and adult PTPs with severe 
hemophilia A (<1% FVIII). Approximately  116 subjects will be enrolled for a total of 96
evaluable subjects (assuming a dropout rate of close to 10% and 10- 15% of subjects 
being non -compliant ). Subjects from the BAX 855continuation (261302) the BAX 855 
surgery  (261204) study , the BAX 855 pediatric (2 [ZIP_CODE]) studyvi, and newl y recruited 
subjects including BAX 855-naïve subjects will participate.
Subjects will be screened per protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria and ,following 
confirmation of eligibility , will undergo an initial PK assessment following a single 
administration of BAX 855 (60 ± 5 IU/kg) to determine PK parameters. Following the 
PK assessment subjects will be randomized to one of 2 dosing regimens: The standard
treatment arm with twice weekl y dosing will target FVIII trough level s
of 1-3% and the 
second , intensified treatment arm with dosing every  other day  will target trough level of 
approximately  10% (8 -12%) FVIII . The dose will be based on each subject’s individual 
PK.More frequent dosing should be consi dered if single doses of 80 IU/kg are required 
or regular FVIII peak levels of 200 % would be reached.

needleless transfer device (BAXJECT II high -flow (HF) or BAXJECT III, as available ) 
will be used for reconstitution and bolus i.v. delivery .The BAXJECT sy stem is a 
needleless liquid transfer device with the primary  function of transferring diluent from its 
vial into an evacuated vial containing product requiring reconstitution prior to infusion.
A minimum of 4 lots of BAX 855manufactured for this study  will be used. Four 
potencies of BAX 855may be used, depending upon availability : 250, 500, 1,000 and 
2,000 IU/vial. 
The recommended storage condition sfor BAX 855are2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) and it 
should not be allowed to freeze. BAX 855should be stored and protected from light. The 
reconstituted product should ideally  be used immediately  but no longer than 3 hours after 
reconstitution.
For additional information, such as reconstitu tion instructions, please refer to the 
BAX 855IB and/or other specific instructions provided by  [CONTACT_456].
8.7.2 Administration
Following reconstitution, BAX 855should be administered using plastic s yringes 
provided b y the sponsor since proteins such as BAX 855may adhere to the surface of 
glass s yringes. BAX 855will be administered i.v. using an appropriatel y sized sy ringe, as 
a bolus infusion with a maximum infusion rate of 10 mL/min, as described in the 
BAX 855IB. The reconstituted BAX 855must be admini stered at room temperature and 
within 3 hours .
BAX 855dose calculation will be based on the stated actual potency of each vial .
PK assessment and determination of IR
For the PK assessment in individual subjects (initial and at stead y state) , only  vials of the 
same lot with a nominal potency  of [ADDRESS_341179] ’s weight, the PK or I R infusion volume will exceed [ADDRESS_341180] whole vial in case 
500 IU potency  vials are used. However, in case vials with a nominal potency  of 1,000 
IU/vial are used, the total calculated dose should not be rounded up or down to the 
nearest whole vial to ensure accurate dosing (eg, 2.5 vials).

8.7.3 Description of Treatment
Subjects will be randomized to one of two PK-tailored proph ylacticdose regimens (see 
Section 8.5)each of them targeting : 
FVIII trough level sof 1-3% with twice we ekly dosing , or 
FVIII trough level sof approximately  10% (8- 12%) with dosing every  other day .
The individual subject’s dose will be calculated by  [CONTACT_279515]. More frequent dosing should be considered if single doses of 80 IU/kg are required 
or regular FVIII peak levels of 200 % would be reached or exceeded . 
[IP_ADDRESS] BAX 855Dosing for PK Assessment
Following a 72-96 h washout period, depending on the FVIII concentrate, subjects will 
undergo a n initial PK assessment with BAX 855vii:
At Visit 9 months, ie after 9 months of prophy lactic treatment with BAX855, a repeat PK 
at stead y state will be performed . No wash -out period will be required prior to the repeat 
PK determination, however, the PK infusion should preferabl y coincide with the 
prophy lactic treatment schedule to ensure that the baseline FVIII trough level is reached. 
The BAX 855dose to be used for the PK assessment is 60 ± 5 IU/kg.It must be 
administered in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic setting under medical supervision.
[IP_ADDRESS] BAX 855Proph ylaxis Dosing 
FVIII trough level of 1 -3%:
BAX 855 will be administered twice weekl y, with either:
Infusion with alternating 3 -days and 4- days infusion intervals; the doses will be 
different if a 3 or a 4 -days interval needs to be covered
an infusion ever y 3.5 days .
More frequent dosing should be considered if single doses of 80 IU/kg are 
required or regular FVIII peak levels of 200 % would be reached or exceeded . 
                                                
viiIn case a subject underwent a PK determination in any of the BAX855 studies, the PK assessment may 
have to be repeated based on the sponsor’s evaluation.

BAX 855 will be infused every  other day .
A daily  dosing may be considered to prevent regular high FVIII peak levels
The required dose and frequency  will be provided by  [CONTACT_456]. Subjects must adhere 
as closel y as possible to the dosing regimen. If a dose is missed, it must be documented 
andthe next dose will be taken as soon as possible. After this dose, the regularly

The day s of the week on which treatment is administered may  be selected by  [CONTACT_14426]/or his/her ph ysician and should provide maximum coverage for vigorous activities.
To provide some flexibility , the weekl y schedule in terms of the day s of the week may  be 
changed during the course of the stud y to best accommodate potential changes in the 
subject’s life sty le.However, the initially  calculated and adjusted, if applicable, dose 
regimen should be maintained. 
For each subject, the BAX [ADDRESS_341181] be administered in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic setting under medical supervision. All other 
treatments may  be self -administered, administered by  a parent or caregiver, or 
administered in the clinic or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885]. Each subject’s phy sician will determine the 
setting of treatment administration. I f the subject will self -administer BAX 855, the 
investigator will ensur e that the subject and/or his caregiver have been adequately  
trained.
The weight determined at screening will be the basis for dose calculation of BAX 855. If 
there is a ± 10% change in weight from the screening visit (as measured at a subsequent 
study  visit), the total dose in IU will be recalculated. Similarly , any additional ± 10% 
change in weight from this new baseline will result in a dose recalculation.
[IP_ADDRESS] BAX 855 Dose and/or Frequency Adjustments
In the first 6- month treatment period t he regimen may  be adjusted based on the FVIII 
trough level determined at each stud y visit . FVIII trough levels should alway s be 
determined immediatel y before the planned next scheduled proph ylactic infusion which 
may coincide with an infusion for determination of I R.

If the lower FVIII trough activity  level is < 1% and < 8% respectivel y;
If the upper FVIII trough activity  level exceeds 3% and 12% respectivel y. Given 
the assay  variations, fluctuations of approximately 3% are possible.
Dose adjustments in the second 6 -month per iod may only be performed ifFVIII trough 
levels are considerably  below the required FVIII trough levels of 1% and 8 %.Should the 
upper limit considerabl y exceed 3% and 12% respectivel y, a dose adjustment may be

9.3Withdrawal and Discontinuation
Any subject may  voluntarily  withdraw (ie, reduce the degree of participation in the study ) 
consent for continued participation and data collection. The reason for withdrawal will be 
recorded on the End of Study CRF. Assessments to be performed at the termination visit 
(including in cases of withdraw alor discontinuation) 
are described in Section 10.6 and 
Section 21.3.
Discontinuation (ie, complete withdrawal from study  participation) may  be due to 
dropout (ie, active discontinuation by
 [CONTACT_1130]) or loss to follow -up (ie, disconti nuation by  
[CONTACT_279520]). Additionally , the investigator and sponsor have the 
discretion to discontinue any  subject from the study  if, in their judgment, continued 
participation would pose an unac ceptable risk for the subject. 
Subjects also will be withdrawn from treatment or discontinued from further study  
participation for the following reasons:
The subject develops a confirmed high responder inhibitory  antibody  to FVIII 
(>5 BU by  [CONTACT_279521] ) or a low responder 
inhibitory  antibody  (≤ 5 BU but ≥ 0.6 BU) that cannot be managed by  [CONTACT_12695] -required proph ylactic dosing.
The subject experiences a severe anaph ylactic reaction to BAX 855.
The subject requires therapy  with another PEGy lated product (eg, PEG -

10.STU DY PROCEDURES
10.1 Informed Consent and Enrollment
Any patient, or their legal representatives, as required, who provides informed consent 
(ie, signs and dates the informed consent form and assent form, if applicable) is 
considered enrolled in the study .
10.2 Subjec t Identification Code
The following series of numbers will comprise the SI C: protocol identifier (ie, 261303) to 
be provided b y the sponsor, 3-digit number stud y site number (eg, 0 02) to be provided by  
[CONTACT_456], and 3- digit subject number (eg, 0 03) refl ecting the order of enrollment (ie, 
signing the informed consent form). For example, the third subject who signed an 
informed consent form at study  site [ADDRESS_341194] 261303-002003. All 
study  documents (eg, CRFs, clinical documentation, sample containers, drug 
accountability  logs, etc.) will be identified with the SI C. Additionall y, a uniquely coded 
SIC(s) is permitted as long as it does not contain a combination of information that 
allows identification of a subject (eg, collection of a 
subject’s initials and birth date
would not be permitted), in compliance with laws governing data privacy .
10.3 Screening and Study Visits
The study  site is responsible for maintaining an enrollment/screening log that includes all 
subjects enrolled. The log also will serve to document the reason for screening failure. If 
a subject does not satisfy all screening criteria, the same subject may  be re -screened at a 
later date. A complete or partial re -screen may  also become necessary  at the discretion of 
the investi gator or sponsor. All screening data will be collected and reported in eCRFs, 
regardless of screening outcome. For the purpose of anal ysis, only  the data from the most 
recent screening visit will be used. If a subje ct is re -screened, the End of Study  CRF 
should be completed, and a new ICF, new SIC and new CRF are required for that subject.
The screening procedures including laboratory  evaluations must be completed within [ADDRESS_341195] elapsed. Exemptions may  be granted for 
administrative reasons, eg, delay  in timely  availability  of laboratory  results.

investigator for:
Seriousness as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]
Severity  as defined in Section [IP_ADDRESS]
Causal relationship to I P exposure or study  procedure 
as defined in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]
For each AE, the outcome (ie, recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved, 
recovered/resolved with sequelae, not recovered/not resolved, fatal, unknown) and if 
applicable action taken (ie, dose increased, dose not changed, dose reduced, drug 
interrupted, drug withdrawn, not applicable, or unknown) will also be recorded on the AE 
CRF. Recovering/resol ving AEs will be followed until resolution, medically stabilized, or 
30 day s after the study  completion/termination visit, whichever comes first. If the 
severit y rating for an ongoing AE changes before the event resolves, the original AE 
report will be revised (ie, the event will not be reported as separate AE). During the 
course of an y AE, the highest severit y rating will be reported.
Deviations from the protocol- specified dosage (including overdosing, underdosing, 
abuse, and withdrawal, treatment errors (including incorrect route of administration, use 
of an incorrect product, and deviations from the protocol- defined dosing schedule), 
failures of expected pharmacological actions, and unexpected therapeutic or clinical

The investigator will assess the severit y of each AE using his/her clinical expertise and 
judgment based on the most appropriate description below:
 Mild
The AE is a transient discomfort and does not interfere in a significant 
manner with the subject’s normal functioning level.
The AE resolves spontaneously  or may  require minimal therapeutic 
intervention.
 Moderate
The AE produces limited impairment of function and may  require 
therapeutic intervention.
The AE produces no sequel a/sequelae.
 Severe
The AE results in a marked impairment of function and may  lead to 
temporary  inability  to resume usual life pattern.
The AE produces sequel a/sequelae , which require (prolonged) therapeutic 
intervention.
These severity  definitions will also be used to assess the severity of an AE with a study-
related procedure(s), if necessary .
[IP_ADDRESS] Causality
Causality  is a determination of whe ther there is a reasonable possibility  that the I P is 
etiologicall y related to/associated with the AE. Causality  assessment includes, eg, 
assessment of temporal relationships, dechallenge/rechallenge information, association 
(or lack of association) with underly ing disease, presence (or absence) of a more likely  
cause, and ph ysiological plausibility .For each AE, the investigator will assess the causal 
relationship between the IP and the AE using his/her clinical expertise and judgment 
according to the foll
owing most appropriate algorithm for the circumstances of the AE:
 Not related (both circumstances must be met)
Is due to underl ying or concurrent illness, complications, concurrent 
treatments, or effects of concurrent drugs
Is not associated with the IP (ie, does not follow a reasonable temporal 
relationship to the administration of I P or has a much more likel y 
alternative etiology ).

14.1 Sample Size and Power Calculations
14.1.1 Sample Size Calculation
For the sample size assessment the following assumptions were used. Approximately  
40% of patients in BAX 855 regimen targeting 1 -3% trough level are expected to be 
bleed -free as shown in the ADVATE Proph ylaxis study  and the BAX 855 pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397]  
261201. For the BAX 855 regimen targeting approximately  10% (8- 12%) trough level, an 
increase to 70% bleed -free patients is expected based on modeling the bleeding rates per 
factor VIII level in the BAX [ADDRESS_341228] a two- sided alternative at the 
5% level of statistical significance with 86% power. Assuming a drop- out rate of close to 
10%, and 10-15% of subjects being non- compliant, approximately  116 subjects are 
planned to be randomized between the two BAX 855 regimens in a ratio of 1:1.

21.5.1 Joint Bleeds
Features of an acute joint bleed include some or all of the following: ‘aura’, pain, 
swelling, warmth of the skin over the joint, decreased range of motion and difficulty  in 
using the limb compared with baseline or loss of function.
The earliest clinical signs of a joint bleed are increased warmth over the area and discomfort 
with movement, particularly at the ends of range. 
Later sy mptoms and signs include pain at rest, swelling, tenderness, and extreme loss of 
motion. 
In patients with advanced arthropath y itmay be difficult to distinguish pain -related 
arthritis from that associated with an acute bleed. Rapid resolution of pain following 
infusion of factor concentrates (t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_279496]) or improvement of pain 
associated with activity  soon after a period of rest (ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_279497]) can help 
distinguish between the two. 
In infants and young childr en, reluctance to use the limb alone may  be indicative of a 
joint/muscle bleed.
21.5.[ADDRESS_341281] blow or a 
sudden stretch. A muscle bleed is defined as an epi[INVESTIGATOR_279498] a musc le, 
determined clinically and/or by [CONTACT_20521], generall y associated with pain and/or
swelling and functional impair ment over baseline.

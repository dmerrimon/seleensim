Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan  
 
BACKGROUND 
Sleep Duration and Sleep Quality  in Spaceflight  
Adequate healthy sleep is essential in spaceflight to ensure astronauts maintain a high 
level of cognitive performance capability and do so without undue stress. However, studies have 
consistently found that chronic sleep restriction (i.e., sleep durations <6.5h) and astronauts’ 
perceptions of poor sleep qual ity were common in spaceflight shuttle missions (Barger et al., 
2014)  and in International  Space Station  (ISS)  missions  (Barger  et al., 2014;  Jones  et al., 2022 ). 
The latter study by [CONTACT_80952]. (2022) yielded N=2,[ADDRESS_718086] (RST) assessments 
(i.e., RST = brief psychomotor vigilance test [PVT- B] with subjective ratings) that included n=394 
evaluations pre- flight; n=2,109 evaluations in- flight; n=[ADDRESS_718087] -flight. This extensive 
study on N=24 astronauts on ISS for 6- month missions revealed that reductions in sleep duration 
and perceived poor sleep quality  on ISS were associated with decrements in astronauts’ 
performance on the brief psychomotor vigilance test (PVT- B) and increases in their perceptions 
of stress and physical exhaustion throughout the mission ( Jones et al., 2022 ). Nearly half of the 
astronauts reported sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 6h/day or less on any given day in spaceflight, which is consistent 
with the earlier findings of Barger et al. (2014). When sleep duration on ISS was 6h or less per 
day, statistically significant deficits in PVT- B performance occurred ( Jones et al., 2022 ). This 
result is consistent with Earth- based experiments showing that chronic restriction of sleep to 4h 
per night, 5h per night, or 6h per night resulted in sleep- dose- response cumulative psychomotor 
vigilance deficits, which involved statistically  reliable  decreases  in PVT response speed  and 
increases  in lapses  of attention,  as well as deficits in cognitive sp eed and working memory 
performance (Dinges et al., 1997; Van Dongen et al., 2003; Belenky et al., 2003; Lim & Dinges, 
2008; Mollicone et al., 2008), and increases in sleep propensity, evident in decreasing sleep 
latency (Carskadon & Dement, 1981). Importantly, these neurobehavioral performance deficits 
become progressively worse as sleep restriction to below 7h per day continued across 
consecutive days.  
Sleep Medication Use in Spaceflight  
Historically,  NASA physicians  have prescribed sleep medications  to address  sleep deficits  
in spaceflight, but among other concerns articulated by [CONTACT_548764]. (2014), the use of hypnotic 
medications in space can pose a risk to astronauts’ performance capability on awakening, 
especially in the event of an emergent awakening, that is, an emergency alarm requiring astronauts to perform at a high level within [ADDRESS_718088] been 
supported by a ground- based, double- blind, placebo- controlled study of zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_548752] -sleep to assess  their adverse effects on various cognitive tasks  in N=34  astronauts,  
astronaut  candidates,  and flight  controllers  at NASA JSC (Johnston et al., 2015; Dinges et al., 
2018). Results showed that pre- sleep ingestion of sleep medications, especially 10- mg zolpi[INVESTIGATOR_6730], 
posed a substantial risk to performance at emergent awakenings from sleep (Johnston et al., 2015; Dinges et al., 2018 ). 
SmartSleep Slow- Wave EEG  Enhancement  Could  Mitigate  Some  of the Effects  of Chronic Sleep 
Loss in Spaceflight  
There is a need for a technology that can improve sleep quality in space and biologically 
maximize  the performance benefits  of limited  sleep duration,  without  unduly  affecting  the ability of 
astronauts to awaken abruptly due to an in- flight emergency. Studies have found that 
enhancement of EEG slow waves during sleep increased subsequent cognitive performance 
 
2  (Bellesi et al., 2014; Bernardi et al., 2015; Ngo et al., 2013). Accumulating evidence suggests 
that many  of the benefits of sleep are associated with sleep EEG slow waves. Slow waves reflect 
the near -synchronous alternation by [CONTACT_548765], active up- states, 
and hyperpolarized, inactive down- states th at are thought to mediate the restorative effects of 
sleep on brain networks and cells (Tononi and Cirelli 2006). Sleep slow waves support system 
and synaptic consolidation by [CONTACT_548766].  Subjecti ve sleep quality  is also related to the size and number  of slow waves  that occur 
nightly (Kecklund and Åkerstedt 1997).  
Pharmacologic  approaches  to improve sleep by [CONTACT_548767]  (Feld et al. 2013). Moreover, pharmacological agents cannot be 
completely  washed out of the metabolic  cycle in cases  where an individual,  like an astronaut,  is 
unexpectedly awakened from sleep and needs to function quickly and accurately.  
SmartSleep is a new slow -wave enhancing technology that monitors and stages sleep 
electroencephalography  (EEG)  in real-time and delivers  auditory  stimulation during  non-REM  
sleep in a closed -loop fashion at a volume that is dynamically modulated by [CONTACT_548768].  
Stimulation is stopped if the likelihood of sleep disturbance exceeds a conservative threshold. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_548753] a majority  of individuals (Diep et al. 2020). Importantly, the 
increase in slow waves is correlated with the number of sub- awareness auditory tones played. 
SmartSleep consists of a sleep app and a headband worn during sleep that is comfortable and 
easily translatable for spaceflight.  
SmartSleep offers an alternative to the dilemma of risking the adverse effects of chronic 
sleep restriction and low sleep quality in spaceflight, versus risking the adverse effects of 
medications on sleep and waking in ever -longer duration spaceflight. If increased amounts of 
slow-wave activity in sleep via SmartSleep can translate to cognitive performance benefits and/or  
sleep quality  benefits,  even during  periods of  chronically  restricted  sleep  time to 5h/night, it will 
offer a significant advantage over the sleep medication alternative. If this is the case, it will also 
be essential to determine whether the enhanced slow -wave activity during sleep provided by 
[CONTACT_548769] t hereby [CONTACT_548770]. It is therefore imperative that the safety of increasing slow -
wave activity be demonstrated to benefit subsequent waking cognitive performance while not 
exacerbating sleep- inertia performance deficits at emergent awakening.  Operational safety 
needs to be demonstrated before the use of SmartSleep in the space program. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, a non- pharmacological slow -wave enhancing technology has  not been  
tested  in a chronic  sleep  restriction  paradigm,  despi[INVESTIGATOR_548754].  
OBJECTIVES  
For the above reasons, we designed a double- blind, placebo- controlled laboratory  study  
of SmartSleep to determine  what  effect  it has on daytime  cognitive  performance and on emergent 
awakenings from sleep in a chronic sleep restriction paradigm (i.e., 5h/night for 4 nights). This 
study is the first to evaluate slow -wave activity enhancement and its effects on performance and 
sleep inertia during sleep using a chronic sleep restriction paradigm to do the following:  
Objective 1: Evaluate whether slow wave sleep enhancement via the SmartSleep stimulus 
algorithms  benefits  daytime cognitive  performance during  a period of chronic  sleep restriction  as 
commonly observed during spaceflight. We assess ed cognitive performance with the Cognition 
test battery ( developed for NASA; Basner et al. , 2015) across a range of cognitive domains and 
across a number of high fidelity spatial cognition tasks and space- operationally relevant tasks 
including Robotic On -Board Trainer (ROBoT); Six Degrees of Freedom Docking Simulator 
(6DF); and Lunar Landing Simulation. 
Objective 2 : Investigate whether  SmartSleep slow-wave  enhancement  increases  
 
3  performance decrements induced by [CONTACT_548771].  
Objective 3: Identify the best modality of acoustic stimulation in terms of slow -wave 
enhancement and  cognitive performance among three different stimulation techniques: 
Continuous  Fixed Interval  (1 Hz, inter-tone interval  stimulation),  Block  (5 seconds  on versus  5 
seconds off), and In- Phase Adjustable (constant stimulation with tones to be delivered during 
each upstate of the slow wave).  
SPECIFIC AIMS  
The overarching goal of this project is to mitigate the effects of chronic sleep loss by  
[CONTACT_548772]. It has the 
following Specific Aims:  
Specific Aim 1: Determine whether slow -wave sleep can be enhanced via closed- loop 
auditory  stimulation of EEG  slow waves  in healthy  adult  subjects  using  SmartSleep Headband 
technology, when sleep is restricted in duration to 5h per night over 4  consecutive nights.  
Hypothesis 1: Slow wave sleep will be enhanced via closed- loop auditory stimulation of EEG 
slow waves  relative  to sham  stimulation, when sleep is restricted  in duration to 5h per night  over 
4 consecutive nights.  
Specific  Aim 2: Determine whether  post-sleep  cognitive  performance  functions  sensitive  to 
sleep restriction can be enhanced when SmartSleep closed- loop auditory  stimulation is used on 
sleep- restricted nights relative to a sham SmartSleep control condition. Hypothesis 2 : Daytime 
cognitive  performance  will be higher  after closed -loop auditory  stimulation of EEG  slow waves 
relative to sham stimulation, when sleep is restricted in duration to 5h per night over 4 
consecutive nights.  
Specific Aim 3: Identify the acoustic stimulation modality with maximal benefits for slow - 
wave  enhancement  and daytime cognitive  performance,  when sleep is restricted in duration to 5h 
per night over 4 consecutive nights. Hypothesis 3: One of the three acoustic stimulation 
modalities enhances EEG slow waves significantly better than the other two modalities, and is also associated with enhanced cognitive performance during the daytime, when sleep is 
restricted in duration to 5h per night over 4 consecutive nights.  
Specific Aim 4: Investigate systematic effects of consecutive nights of sleep restriction on 
slow-wave enhancement and daytime cognitive performance. Hypothesis 4: With increasing 
homoeostatic  sleep  drive  induced by [CONTACT_548773] e nights  of sleep restriction,  the observed slow- 
wave  enhancement  will mitigate  some  of the effects  of chronic  sleep loss on daytime cognitive 
performance.  
Specific Aim 5: Assess any potential adverse effects of SmartSleep utilization during sleep 
restriction, especially related to sleep inertia after emergent awakening. Hypothesis 5: Cognitive 
functioning  after emergent  awakenings  in the acoustic  stimulation conditions  will be non-inferior 
relative to sham stimulation based on a non -inferiority margin of [ADDRESS_718089]  the brain’s slow wave sleep (delta/theta frequency) in real time, and a closed -loop 
algorithm customizes the timing and volume of tones to optimize the sleep pattern. Thus, the device uses “quiet audio tones” (sub -awareness) to increase slow waves, which can enhance 
sleep quality/depth, thereby [CONTACT_548774]. 
Philips completed commercial development of the SmartSleep technology 
(https:// www.usa.philips.com/c -e/smartsleep -advocacy.html) . The Philips  SmartSleep website 
states  that SmartSleep is a, “ Wearable sleep headband and mobile app clinically proven to 
improve the  quality  of your  sleep”, and  that it “increases your  energy  in the same  sleep time”,  it is 
 
4  “for people who typi[INVESTIGATOR_548755] <7 hours per night”, and it is a “drug- free sleep enhancement 
technology. ” 
 There is evidence that it is possible to enhance slow waves through non- pharmacological  
means,  particularly  with auditory  stimulation  (Bellesi et al., 2014; Tononi  et al., 2010; Ngo et al., 
2015; Ngo et al., 2013; Papalambros  et al., 2017). The enhanced slow waves are 
indistinguishable from spontaneous ones in shape, origin, distribution, and propagation (Riedner 
et al., 2011).  
 
Figure 1. a) The presence of EEG patterns (high power in the alpha 8- 12 Hz and/or beta 15- 30 Hz 
bands) indicative of (micro) arousals is first evaluated. If arousal -like activity is detected in the EEG 
during stimulation,  the stimulation stops. If the arousal -like act ivity is detected outside the stimulation 
period, the onset of the next stimulation period is delayed. If no arousal -like activity is detected, then the 
system attempts to detect deep sleep based on slow wave activity (SWA) and the temporal density of 
detected slow -waves. On detection of sufficiently deep  sleep,  the auditory  stimulation  is delivered. b)  
Enhancement  of slow waves  when  stimulation is  delivered. c)  SWA enhancement due to stimulation. The 
green markers indicate the time at which the stimulation was delivered  
In the last few years, Philips in collaboration with the University of Wisconsin- Madison, have 
developed a closed loop, real -time, embedded, and sleep wearable system that monitors sleep 
EEG and delivers auditory stimulation during deep sleep (N3) at a volume that is dynamically 
modulated by [CONTACT_548768]. Sleep depth is estimated by [CONTACT_548775] 0.5 to 4 Hz band and the power in the 15 to 30 Hz band. The system consists of  a headset  

 
5  with a single  dry EEG  electrode placed  on the forehead and an integrated processing unit 
embedded in the  headband ( Figure  1a). The  reference electrode is positioned on the right 
mastoid with conductive gel to improve impedance. This system focuses on the detection of 
deep sleep (N3) and wakefulness such that  it targets the stimulation to periods where sleep is 
deep and stimulation related disturbance is prevented. The N3 (wake) detection sens itivity  and 
specificity are 73.5% (76.4%) and 96.9% (82.5%) , respectively . The stimulation is delivered 
through speakers  in a headset  in the form of 50-millisecond  audible tones  with a one-second  
inter-tone interval. As reported in several publications (Ngo et al., 2013; Papalambros et al., 
2017; Santostasi et al., 2015), the slow -wave activity (SWA)  enhancing effect is optimized by 
[CONTACT_548776]-phase of a detected  slow-wave. If the likelihood  of sleep 
disturbance exceeds a pre- established threshold, the stimulation is stopped. 
At this point, it is unclear which acoustic stimulation paradigm produces the best results in 
terms  of slow-wave  enhancement  and cognitive  performance  improvement. In this study,  we will 
systematically compare three acoustic stimulation modalities and sham. The four stimulation 
modalities will be provided by [CONTACT_548777]:  
• Continuous  Fixed Interval : 1 Hz inter-tone interval  stimulation  
• Block : 5 seconds  on versus  5 seconds  off, and 
• In-Phase Adjustable: constant  stimulation  with tones  to be delivered during  each upstate of 
the slow wave.  
• Sham : No auditory  stimulation while  wearing  the SmartSleep headband  
The slow wave amplitude enhancement produced by [CONTACT_548778] 1b. The amplitude of deep sleep EEG clearly increases when the auditory stimulation 
(indicated by [CONTACT_548779] 1b) is delivered. An illustration of SWA enhancement  is shown in Figure 1c where the black  curve  is the SWA  of a sham  sleep  session 
(without stimulation but while the device is worn) and the pi[INVESTIGATOR_548756] a sleep 
session with stimulation.  The green  markers  (i.e., tone location)  indicate  the periods  where the 
stimulation was delivered.  
A previous version of SmartSleep was tested in a study supported by [CONTACT_548780], safety and productivity. The results of this study 
(Diep et  al., 2020) demonstrated that >65% of participants exhibited enhanced slow wave energy  
in the stimulation condition (STIM) with an average of 28.4 % increase  with respect  to sham.  
Furthermore,  large  effect  sizes  were  observed for improved executive function (Verbal Fluency) 
and morning vigilance  (PVT)  following  stimulation relative to sham.  
 
STUDY  DESIGN  
 The study was conducted at the University of Pennsylvania. This placebo -controlled, 
double- blind, cross -over laboratory study  of SmartSleep stimulations included sleep restriction to 
5h time in bed for sleep on 4 consecutive nights,  preceded by [CONTACT_1629] 8h sleep  adaptation night, and 
followed by a 10h recovery night (Figure 2 ).  
 The proposed sample was a total of  12 subjects to be recruited and screened for  their 
ability  to engage  in the protocol and their similarities to astronauts (e.g., age 30- 55y, educational 
background, healthy, etc.). The protocol involved monitoring of sleep- wake behaviors by  
[CONTACT_548781]  2 weeks prior to and 1 week  following  the 7- day laboratory  protocol.  
Participants were required to remain  in the laboratory  for the entire 7- day and 6- night protocol for 
cognitive testing at alarm awakening from sleep (sleep inertia test battery) and throughout each 
19h waking period (full Cognition test battery every 4 hours). In addition, participants  completed 
a spatial cognition battery  and three tasks with operational relevance to spaceflight  (Six Degrees 
of Freedom, ROBoT, and the Lunar Lander Simulator) once a day. The [ADDRESS_718090] ed of a baseline night (8h time in bed [TIB]), 4 nights of 5h TIB  (each with one of the fou r 
SmartSleep stimulus conditions), and a  recovery  night  of 10h TIB at the end. Each of the 12 
subjects  received one of the SmartSleep stimulus conditions (Continuous Fixed Interval, Block, 
 
6  In-Phase Adjustable, and Sham) on one of  the 4 sleep restriction  nights,  according to a balanced  
orthogonal  Latin  Square design.  This was a fully  within -subjects design with high statistical power 
for th e given sample size. This allowed us to investigate how the methodology works across the 
build -up of chronic sleep restriction (Figure 2).

Figure 2: Overview of the study design. Each of the 12 subjects underwent  one adaptation night (8h TIB), 
four sleep- restriction nights (5h TIB), and one recovery night (10h TIB). Each subject was  exposed to all 
four SmartSleep acoustic stimulations on the four sleep restriction nights (Stim1: Continuous Fixed 
Interval; Stim2: B lock; Stim3: In -phase adjustable; and Sham) according to a balanced orthogonal Latin 
Square design. Subjects performed a sleep  inertia  test bout consisting  of a 3-min. Psychomotor  Vigilance  
Test (PVT -B) and a Digit-Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) after emergent awakenings. They also 
performed  cognitive and operational testing throughout the wake periods.  
The following  cognitive  and spaceflight -relevant  operational tasks were  administered  
throughout the waking period on all days of the protocol  (Figure 3) :

Test (DSST) after emergent awakenings.  
Sleep Inertia  Test Bout 
The Sleep Inertia Test Bout  was administered  at the time of emergent  awakenings,  and 
consist ed of two measures that were developed and validated to be sensitive to sleep inertia: the  
Brief Psychomotor  Vigilance  Test (PVT -B) to assess  behavioral alertness  and psychomotor 
speed (Basner et al ., 2011); and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST)  to assess cognitive 
processing throughput. In addition, we administer ed the Descending Subtraction Task (DST) , a 
validated measure of working memory sensitive the effects of sleep loss and sleep inertia 
(Ding es, 1990; Dinges et al., 1985), as well as Visual Analog Scales (VAS)  to assess  subjective 
ratings  of mental  fatigue,  tiredness,  physical  exhaustion,  level of stress, sleep  quality, and 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008].  
The PVT -B is a well- validated test based on vigilant attention and reaction time (Basner & 
Dinges, 2011; Lim & Dinges, 2008). Subjects are instructed to monitor a rectangular box on  the 
screen  and press  the space bar as quickly  as possible  each time a millisecond  counter  appears. 
Each PVT -B reaction time is displayed for one second as feedback. Subjects are asked to  
respond as quickly as possible without committing false starts in the absence of stimuli.  
The 1.5-minute Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) is validated to be sensitive to 
fatigue from sleep loss (Van Dongen et al., 2003; Dinges et al., 1985). The test is based on the original version in the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. Subjects are presented with a legend 
that pairs unique symbols to digits (1 through 9). Symbols are then sequentially  presented on the 
screen in random  order.  Subjects  are instructed  to press  the corresponding  number  key as soon 
as possible. On each test administration, the symbol and digit correspondence is randomly 
reassigned. The DSST measures cognitive throughput based on perception and memory.  
The Descending Subtraction Test (DST) is a measure of working memory that is sensitive 
to fatigue from sleep loss and sleep inertia (Dinges, 1990; Dinges et al., 1985). The DST requires 
particip ants to mentally subtract numbers in a sequential fashion as quickly as possible. For 
example, if the starting number is 987, the participant subtracts nine from 987, with the difference being 978, the participant then subtracts eight from 978, and so on subtracting by [CONTACT_284881], six, five, four, three, and two, from each difference at which point, the participant then recycles the 
subtraction sequence beginning at nine again. The DST was  two minutes in duration and 
responses were  entered on a keyboard.  
The Vis ual Analog Scales (VAS) measured subjective ratings with end points of “Mentally  
Sharp”  (0) and “Mentally  Fatigued”  (10); “Tired” (0) and “Fresh, Ready  to Go”  (10); “Energetic”  (0) 
and “Physically  Exhausted”  (10); “Not Stressed At All” (0) and “Very  Stressed” (10); “Low Sleep 
Quality” (0) and “High Sleep Quality” (10); and “Not Sleepy At All” (0) and “Very Sleepy” (10).  
Cognition Test Battery  
Cognition was developed for spaceflight by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Mathias Basner and his team at  the 
University of Pennsylvania (Basner  et al., 2015;  Moore et al., 2017).  It consists  of 10 brief 
neuropsychological tests that cover a range of cognitive domains that are relevant for spaceflight 
and go beyond what is measured with NASA’s standard WinSCAT test battery  (e.g., emotion 
recognition and risk decision- making). Fifteen unique versions of each test allow for repeated 
 
8  administration of the battery. Importantly, a ground- based study in N=[ADDRESS_718091] been established  with fMRI  (Roalf  et al., 2014).  The battery  was 
specifically designed for the high- performing astronaut population and was validated in both 
astronaut  and astronaut surrogate populations on the ground and on the ISS (Moore et al., 
2017). Overall, the battery has been administered 7,222 times in 720 unique subjects (mean age 
35.1 years, SD 9.0 years, range 20 -62 years; 71% male), including 5 astronauts on 6 -month ISS 
missions, 2 astronauts on 12- month ISS missions, 8 astronauts in a ground- based study  at 
Johnson Space Center (JSC), and 198 subjects in several space analog environments (including 
head- down tilt bed rest, HERA, and Antarctic research stations). The sensitivity of the battery to 
environmental stressors typi[INVESTIGATOR_548758] (e.g., sleep deprivation and high levels 
of CO2 [Basner et al., 2017]) has been established. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a subset 
of 3 Cognition tests (Digit Symbol Substitution, Abstract Matching, and Fractal 2- Back) was able 
to predict 30% of 6DF -docking performance variance on a task that is regularly used on the ISS 
(Johannes et al., 2016). Finally, Cognition is part of ISS Standard Measures. Therefore,  
Cognition constitutes a well -established and validated instrument for measuring spaceflight 
effects on cognitive performance.  
The Cognition battery (Basner et al., 2015; Moore et al., 2017) was  administered on 
calibrated laptop computers.  On average,  [ADDRESS_718092] generated software  that automatically  extracts  key Cognition accuracy  and speed  outcomes.  Facilitating  
our large database of Cognition tests, we determined loading and difficulty of individual stimuli via Item Response Theory  (Embretson and Reise, 2000), which increases the power for our 
analyses relative to analyses based on standard accuracy outcomes (e.g., percent correct). T he 
data analysis  process  was as follows:  (1) extract  one key  accuracy and speed outcome  for each 
test; (2) correct  outcomes  for practice  and stimulus  set difficulty  effects; and  (3) standardize 
outcomes based on baseline performance of all subjects (we will also generate speed, accuracy, and efficiency scores across cognitive domains). 
Spatial  Cognition Tasks 
Spatial cognition was  assessed using a variety of virtual 3D navigation tasks,  which  
probes similar  cognitive  functions  as real-world  navigation and recruit  similar neural  networks  
(Cushman  et al., 2008;  Ekstrom  et al., 2003;  Wolbers  et al., 2004).  These tasks specifically 
target the hippocampus and other areas that support the encoding and retrieval of spatial 
locations, show considerable connectivity to the hippocampus, and support visuospatial 
imagery, epi[INVESTIGATOR_548759] -processing operations. A subset of these tests has 
been specifically developed for in- flight assessments, which is currently prepared for flight 
certification in collaboration with Cadmos/ESA as part of the ISS experiment HypoCampus.  
This subset has been optimized relative to crew burden/compliance and scientific return, and  
with the respect  to the underlying  test constructs. Briefly, we employed a virtual  cognitive  map 
task to assess spatial memory formation (Craig et al., 2016); navigation strategies were  tested 
using a modified paradigm originally proposed by [CONTACT_548782]. (2013), which allow ed us to 
evaluate the selection and adoption between beacon,  response cue, and spatial  strategies.  We 
also employ ed a plus maze task to specifically assess switching capabilities between 
navigational strategies (Harris et al., 2012). This paradigm has been shown to be sensitive to navigational switching, which is likely to be attributed to decreased functional connectivity 
between the hippocampus  and pre-frontal  cortex  as well as dysregulation of the locus  coeruleus  
noradrenergic system. To specifically target topographical memory, a digital version of the Four 
Mountains Task was  performed (Chan et al., 2016; Hartley  & Harlow , 2012). Path integration 
was assessed using a triangle completion task (Goeke et al. , 2015). The task has been 
specifically adapted to  the needs of spaceflight with respect to directions (including pi[INVESTIGATOR_548760]), duration, velocity and complexity. In addition, a modified paradigm suggested by [CONTACT_548783]. (2008) was  employed to specifically assess spatial updating. Spatial orientation ability was  
 
9  determined using the Perspective Taking paradigm suggested by [CONTACT_548784] & Waller (2004). All 
tasks have been successfully established as part of various NASA/ESA and DLR studies (e.g. 
HERA C3, HERA C4, ESA Bed Rest ‘RSL’, ESA Bed Rest ‘Cocktail’). The frequency of tests 
administrations was optimized for each task and varied between single up to daily test 
administrations.  
Spaceflight  Relevant  Operational  Tasks  
 The Robotic  On-Board  Trainer  (ROBoT)  was used as an in-lab operational  task.  ROBoT  
is NASA’s platform for training astronauts to perform docking and grappling maneuvers using 
the Canada Arm. Proficiency with this system is mandatory for all astronauts who fly. The 
system is based on highly realistic 3D simulations of the arm and associa ted physics. The 
physical system involves a left -hand translational controller (x/y/z directions) and a right -hand 
rotational controller (pi[INVESTIGATOR_23025]/roll/yaw), plus two laptop computer screens. The key performance metrics include: (i) docking position accuracy,  (ii) docking orientation accuracy, (iii) total task  
time, and (iv) smoothness of approach trajectory.  
 The Six Degrees  of Freedom  Docking  Simulator  (6DF)  was used as an in- lab operational 
task. It is a high fidelity docking simulation task that has been used to investigate the 
performance of cosmonauts in the manual docking of a Soyuz spacecraft on the ISS. The 
experimental docking simulator consists of a  series of docking  flight tasks of varying  skill level 
that have dynamic and informational equivalence to real docking maneuvers, based on 
mathematical models for real- hand control of the Soyuz spacecraft. In the evaluation of flight 
quality,  there  are 12 physical/mathematical  parameters  that describe the  position and the motion 
of the spacecraft and space station with regard to each other.  
 The Lunar Landing Simulation was used as an in- lab operational task. It includes a 
sequence of activities from the Apollo Program and the Autonomous Landing and Hazard Avoidance Technology  (ALHAT)  Project. Subjects operate  the terminal  descent  phase  of a lunar 
landing.  To complete  the landing  there  is a primary  flight  display,  landing  display,  and automatic 
and manual control modes.  
STATISTICAL APPROACH  
We conduct ed a randomized, double- blind, cross -over laboratory study on the effects of  
the slow -wave enhancing smart sleep technology  on cognitive performance during  4 consecutive 
nights  of sleep restriction (5h time in bed).  We compared the four auditory  stimulation  modalities 
(continuous fixed interval, block, in- phase adjustable, and sham) relative to their slow -wave and 
performance enhancing properties. Each subject was expos ed to all 4 modalities (within- subject  
study  design).  We used a balanced orthogonal Latin S quare  design (i.e., each stimulus modality  
will appear  in each of the 4 sleep restriction  nights  exactly  once,  and each  modality  will be 
preceded by [CONTACT_548785]). 
Cognitive test data were  standardized to baseline performance . We use d linear mixed 
effect models (in SAS version 9.4, SAS Institute, Cary, NC) with random subject intercept to 
account  for the clustered  nature  of the data.  The model  included factors  for stimulus  modality (4 
levels), sleep restriction night (4 levels), and their interaction. We were both interested in the 
main effects (modality and sleep restriction) and their interaction, but acknowledge the limited 
power for detecting a significant interaction. I f the type -III fixed effect estimate indicates a 
significant difference between groups, we compared them in post -hoc tests. The primary 
outcome was be the number of lapses (errors of commission; response times >355 ms) on the 
brief Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT -B) after emergent awakenings and during the day. 
Performance on t he Digit S ymbol Substitution (DSST ), Descending Subtraction Task (DST), and 
spaceflight relevant task (R OBoT) were treated as secondary outcomes. The other cognitive 
tests (Cognition, Spatial Cognition, tasks with operational relevance for spaceflight) were  treated 
as tertiary  outcomes. Statistical tests for secondary  and tertiary  outcomes were  adjusted with the 
false discovery rate method (Curran- Everet, 2000).  
 
10  For the power calculations  (Figure 4), we assumed a correlation between measurements 
of 0.8, and varied the standard deviation of the difference between modalities/sleep restriction  
nights  from 0.[ADDRESS_718093] >80%  power  to find a medium  effect  size of 0.[ADDRESS_718094] deviations <0.9.

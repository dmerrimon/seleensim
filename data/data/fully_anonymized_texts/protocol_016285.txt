SYNOPSIS  
 
Protocol Title: 2D and [ADDRESS_402783] -enhanced Ultrasound Evaluation of Hepatocellular Carcinoma 
Chemoembolization  
 
Trial Objectives: The primary objective of this trial is to:  
- To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of 2D and 4D contrast enhanced ultrasound for 
monitoring transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) response [ADDRESS_402784] -enhanced magnetic resonance (MRI) or comput ed 
tomography (CT) imaging  
 
The secondary aim of this trial is to:  
- To develop quantitative biomarkers based on the ultrasound contrast agent kinetics for identifying patients requiring retreatment of residual disease.   
 
Trial Design:  This is an open -label, non- randomized trial that will be conducted at three  clinical site s.  The 
subject population will be patients undergoing transarterial chemoembolization for the treatment of 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at Thomas Jefferson University , The University of [LOCATION_004], San Diego, 
and The Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_326499] . Patients will receive a contrast -enhanced ultrasound 
(CEUS) exam the morning prior to embolization, approximately one week post -embolization, and at their 
one month MRI follow up (scheduled as part of their clinical standard of care).  
 Trial Population: This trial will consist of up to 210 adults ( with a maximum of up to 100 at any  institution ) 
undergoing transarterial chemoembolization for the treatment of HCC split between Thomas Jefferson 
University , The University of [LOCATION_004], San Diego, and The Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_111464] .  
 
Trial Procedures: Patients will be identified and consecutively approached from each institution’s 
Hepatology / Transplant Surgery and Interventional Radiology practices (by [CONTACT_25733]’s Hepatology or 
Interventional Radiology co- investigators). An investigator or research co ordinator will explain the study 
to the patient. The patient will be given time to consider the risks and benefits of the study and to ask 
questions about participation. A consent form will be reviewed with the patient. A full history and physical 
 5 examinat ion will be obtained from the patient’s referring physician .  If the subject is a woman of 
childbearing potential, she will have a urine pregnancy test prior to each CEUS study (the results of which 
will be made available to the subject prior to study init iation). In the event a patient presents with a lesion 
that is expected to be difficult to view on ultrasound (for example, smaller lesions located high on the liver dome), grayscale ultrasound imaging will quickly be performed to ensure the lesion is visi ble on ultrasound 
and that the patient is suitable for study inclusion.  
 
Patients will undergo a total of three separate CEUS exams. These exams will consist of the baseline study 
prior to TACE therapy, a study 1- [ADDRESS_402785]/MRI follow -up. If the patient fails to show up for the 1- [ADDRESS_402786] three cases at each institut ion (baseline and at least one follow -up) will be performed under the 
guidance of at least one of the study PIs to ensure standardization amongst all three sites. The ultrasound 
examinations will be performed by a qualified sonographer. Efforts will be made to have all CEUS scans 
performed by [CONTACT_326523], enabling us to evaluate operator dependence. During the ultrasound examination, the patient will be asked to lie in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_54904] a 20 -22 gauge cannula 
will be placed in a supe rficial vein (preferably an antecubital vein). Ultrasound imaging will be performed 
using a state of the art Logiq E9 scanner with C1- 5-D broad- spectrum convex transducer and a RAB2- 5-D 
broad- spectrum real -time 4D transducer (GE Healthcare, Wauwatosa, WI).  As part of this study, we have 
budgeted for the purchase of 3 4D probes (not routinely available in clinical practice) and the installation 
of GE’s ultrasound volumetric and contrast imaging packages that provide 2D and 4D CEUS capabilities. 
In the event the patient has multiple lesions scheduled for treatment, up to [ADDRESS_402787] power 
Doppler imaging (PDI). Following baseline imaging, patients will receive a bolus IV injection of up to 0.6 
ml of Definity, followed by a 10 cc saline flush. Since Definity is currently only approved for 
echocardiography, we will apply to the FDA for an investigational new drug application for CEUS 
evaluation of TACE (similar to our previous study [Shaw at el. 2014]).  
 
All CEUS imaging will be performed using the dual B -mode (used to locate anatomical features) and 
 [ADDRESS_402788] (to identify the ultrasound contrast agent) imaging mode. A low mechanical index (< 
0.1) will be used to minimize microbubble destruction during imaging. The standard nonlinear imaging 
frequency pairings in the contrast imaging software will be  used (transmitting at 2 MHz, receiving at the 4 
MHz harmonic), and gain settings will be adjusted to minimize nonlinear signals prior to contrast injection. Additionally, the focal zone will be placed at the approximate depth of the lesion to maximize the  generation 
of nonlinear signals during CEUS. During the first contrast injection, 2D CEUS will be performed using the coded harmonics nonlinear imaging package on the unit. The approximate tumor mid -line will be 
imaged until homogenous liver enhancement i s achieved (approximately [ADDRESS_402789] injection), 
followed by [CONTACT_326524]. Sweeps will then be acquired in the sagittal plane, before returning to the original plane. Imaging will be continued until contrast washout is observed (approximately 3-4 minutes), after which data will be digitally stored for later review. A ten to  fifteen minute wait period 
will be observed between injections to allow for complete ultrasound contrast agent clearance. A region of interest encompassing the entire tumor volume and margin will then be selected in 4D mode.  Baseline 
imaging of the tumor will be repeated in 4D mode in grayscale B -mode. A second bolus injection of up to 
0.6 ml Definity followed by 10 cc saline flush will again be administered dur ing continuous tumor imaging 
in 4D, which uses the machine’s coded harmonics package. Data will be obtained until contrast washout is observed and then digitally stored in digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) format for 
later review.  
 The proposed agent for the current study, Definity is a sterile non- pyrogenic suspension of liposome -
encapsulated perfluoropropane microbubbles [Goldberg et al 2001; Miller & Nanda 2004].  The contrast agent is composed of a blend of three phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_326500] a matrix of sodium chloride, propylene 
glycol, and glycerin in water.  The contrast agent is supplied in a vial that contains the phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_326501].  The microbubble agent is supplied in a standard- size 2 ml vial and is prepar ed by 
[CONTACT_326525] a shaking device (Vialmix: ESPE, Seefeld, [LOCATION_013]).  Definity will be 
stored in a secure cabinet, with only the study investigators and research personnel having access. Definity is currently only approved for use in echocardiography.  The agent will be used as an off -label indication 
for this study.  We intend to apply for an FDA investigator -instantiated IND for the off -label usage of 
Definity for the evaluation of chemoembolization using drug eluting beads.  
 
Statistical Methodology: Data analysis from this multi -center clinical trial will be performed to characterize 
2D and 4D CEUS as a follow -up imaging tool for the evaluation of residual tumoral blood flow in patients 
with HCC treated with TACE.  Our statistical an alysis will address three major questions:   
 [ADDRESS_402790] TACE yield sensitivity and specificity greater than 9 0%  
for identifying residual tumor blood flow, thereby [CONTACT_326526] (relative 
to the current clinical standard) of patients in  need of retreatment ? 
2. Does 2D and 4D CEUS [ADDRESS_402791] TACE yield sensitivity and specificity greater than 90% for 
identifying residual tumor blood flow ,thereby [CONTACT_326527], safe, and cost -effective 
imaging alter native for identifying TACE patients in need of retreatment?  
3. Are quantifiable biomarkers generated by [CONTACT_326528] 2D and 4D CEUS exams able to 
differentiate between fully treated and incompletely treated masses by [CONTACT_326529]?  
The first three cases at each institution will be used as reader training cases and will not be included in the 
final analysis. In the event of all cases showing identical response (i.e. all incompletely or completely treated), the first case with an altern ative outcome will be substituted for the 9
th case. Following reader 
training, each reader (all of whom have previous experience with CEUS and volumetric ultrasound) will be asked to evaluate all [ADDRESS_402792] be asked to review both the patient’s baseline CE -MRI/CT and CEUS 
exams to identify the size and location of the treated mass. Following baseline review, each reader will 
review the 1 -2 week and 1 month CEUS exam (in random order). Intratumoral blood flow will be assessed 
as present or not present. Readers will then be asked to interpret the patient’s 1 month follow -up CE -
MRI/CT images and again evaluate the need to retreat based on residual blood flow. Finally, when 
available, readers will review  subsequent CE -MRI/CT imaging studies (up to six months post TACE). 
MRI/CT evaluations will be based on mRECIST criteria.  All imaging studies will be read twice by [CONTACT_326530]. Studies will be presented in random order. The second round reads will be perf ormed at least one 
month after the first. Outcomes will be defined as incompletely treated (i.e. requiring retreatment) based on 
(in order of preference of reference standard): a) pathological examination of explanted livers 
demonstrating live tumors; b) t umor enhancement seen with CT or MR and confirmed via angiography 
during retreatment; c) tumor growth on [ADDRESS_402793]/MRI; or d) asymmetrical or nodular 
tumor enhancement on CE -MRI/CT on 6 month follow -up. Incomplete treatment on CEUS (2D or 4D)  will 
be evaluated by [CONTACT_326531].   
 For statistical questions  1-2, sensitivity (the ability to detect patients in need of retreatment) and specificity 
(the ability to identify patients who do not require retreatment) will first be calculated on a reader by [CONTACT_326532]. Four [ADDRESS_402794]. These values will also 
be calculated based on the majority decision (i.e. 4 or more readers in agreement). In the event of discordant 
readings during this analysis, tumor outcome will be decided by [CONTACT_326533].  
Differences between techniques (2D vs. 4D) and time points (1- [ADDRESS_402795] treatment) will 
be determined by [CONTACT_326534]/time 
point based on necessity of tumor retreatment. Intra -rater and inter -rater variability will be calculated using 
a Shrout and Fleiss Interclass Correlation [Shrout and Fleiss 1979]. Finally, a logistical r egression and 
analysis of variance will be performed to determine if significant variations exist between individual sites 
(to determine operator dependence), lesion size (tumor size dependency) or between patients treated with cTACE vs. DEB -TACE (treatmen t dependency).  
 For statistical question  3, all quantitative parameters will be compared between fully treated and 
incompletely treated masses using a Student’s t -test. Additionally, lesions that demonstrate lack of residual 
enhancement at [ADDRESS_402796] this lower level of residual disease. 
Statistical analysis will be performed with assistance from the biostatistician c o-investigator using Stata 
12.0 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX) with p values < 0.05 considered statistically significant after a Bonferroni -type adjustment for multiple tests. These statistical tests will answer our three major questions 
regarding the s ensitivity and specificity of 2D and 4D CEUS as an imaging tool for the follow -up of TACE 
at 1-2 weeks and 1 mont h, as well as the influence of operator, reader, tumor size, and embolization 
material.  
 
1. INTRODUCTION  
  
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide and the incidence 
is increasing. While surgical resection and transplantation offer the possibility of long -term cure, the 
majority of patients are not eligible for the se treatments. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is 
standard of care for patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B disease but may also be used as 
bridging therapy in patients who are potential transplant candidates. Current guidelines recom mend follow -
up imaging [ADDRESS_402797] -enhanced magnetic resonance 
imaging (CE -MRI) has been established as the clinical standard imaging modality for evaluating treatment 
 [ADDRESS_402798] -enhanced computed tomography (CE -CT) is used when CE -MRI is contraindicated. 
However, there are multiple reasons patients may not undergo cross- sectional imaging follow -up - metallic 
implants, renal impairment, allergies to contrast medium, and anxieties related to confined space or 
radiation exposure. Addit ionally, the cost and availability of these techniques are disadvantageous 
compared to ultrasound imaging.   
 
Contrast -enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is a well -established technique for enhancing echocardiograms in 
the [LOCATION_002] and is approved for a wide range of vascular and oncologic applications worldwide. These 
contrast agents function as blood pooling agents and unlike the contrast agents used in MRI/CT, are not nephrotoxic and have no renal contraindications, making them an exceptionally safe imaging agent.  
Additionally, CEUS imaging is not influenced by [CONTACT_326535] -surgical inflammation in the 
liver, potentially offering an earlier option for monitoring treatment response of TACE compared to the current clinical standard. In this study , we propose a multi -center clinical trial to determine the sensitivity 
and specificity of two and real time three- dimensional (2D and 4D, respectively) CEUS for evaluating 
TACE.  In addition, quantitative biomarkers based on parametric imaging will be def ined for identifying 
patients in need of retreatment. These techniques may provide a safer, more accurate imaging alternative for evaluating TACE effectiveness, as well as earlier identification of residual disease requiring retreatment. 
The multi -center n ature of this proposed study allows sufficient sample sizes to define the sensitivity and 
specificity of CEUS within an adequate confidence interval, as well as investigate its operator and reader dependencies. Once properly validated, this technique is ex pected to improve patient outcomes by [CONTACT_14659] 
a viable imaging alternative in cases where CE -MRI/CT is contraindicated and enabling earlier 
identification of residual disease in need of retreatment.  
 
1.1 Background 
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most prevalent cancer worldwide, with over half a million new 
cases reported per year [Alterkruse et al. 2009]. The rising incidence of HCC over the last 20 years is 
primarily attributed to the rise in hepatitis C virus infections [El- Serag and Mason 1999] .  Surgery offers 
the best chance for long term cure; however, only 30% of referred patients are eligible for surgical resection, 
and this group is still plagued by 5 year recurrence rates higher  than 70% [Bruix and Llovet 
2002]. Transplantation is another treatment option for HCC, with the 5 year survival rates for liver 
transplantation at 68%, [Watt et al. 2010] yetis severely limited by [CONTACT_326536] [Kim et al. 2013; Llovet et al. 1999].  
 
In patients with unresectable disease, locoregional treatment options include thermal ablation, 
 10 radioembolization and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). Since hepatocellular cancers are almost 
exclusively supplied by [CONTACT_326537] a dual blood supply (app roximately 
75% from the portal vein and 25% from the hepatic artery), trans -arterial treatment of tumors can be 
performed while limiting toxicity to the surrounding uninvolved parenchyma [Chapman et al. 2008; Gonsalves and Brown, 2009; Bruix and Sherman 2010]. While this technique is primarily used for the 
treatment of HCC, it has also been successful for a variety of hepatic malignancies [Burger et al. 2005; Herber et al. 2007; Giroux et al. 2004; Brown et al. 2012; Fiorentini et al. 2007; Patel et al. 200 5; Sato et 
al. 2005; Madoff et al 2006].   TACE involves the direct infusion of chemoembolic agents via a catheter placed in the tumor feeding artery [Yamada et al. 1995]. Conventional TACE (cTACE) uses chemotherapeutic agents mixed with Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_143753], followed by [CONTACT_326538]. Drug -eluting bead TACE (DEB -TACE) uses chemotherapeutic agents 
adsorbed onto poly -vinyl alcohol beads. The bead size is standardized and chosen based on tumor size and 
sub selective vascular access. Regardless of which embolic agen ts are used, the goal remains the same, to 
render the tumors ischemic while depositing high doses of chemotherapy in the tumor [Gonsalves and 
Brown 2009]. Tumor ischemia causes the disruption of intracellular glycoprotein pumps, which inhibits 
tumor cells from expelling chemotherapeutic agents, resulting in a six- fold increase in drug retention 
[Sasaki et al. 1987].  
 During cTACE, iodinated, ester derived poppy -seed oils serve as drug carriers, as temporary embolization 
material, and as imaging agents under fluoroscopy [Gonsalves and Brown, 2009]. The chemotherapeutic agents used may vary, but most frequently consist o f a cisplatin, adriamycin, and mitomyocin (CAM) 
mixture [Van Ha 2009].  Following delivery, more permanent embolization is achieved with materials such 
as poly -vinyl alcohol or gelfoam [Gonsalves and Brown, 2009]. While cTACE is an effective therapy for 
slowing disease progression, improved patient responses with less toxicity have been observed with the use 
of DEB -TACE [Vogl et al. 2011; Lammer et al. 2010; Gaba 2012]. Embolization with DEB -TACE results 
in occlusion of the tumor vasculature, combined with a sustained, intratumoral release of the 
chemotherapeutic [Lewis et al. 2006].  Compared with cTACE, DEB -TACE is associated with greater 
treatment tolerance and significantly less liver toxicity and doxorubicin- related side effects [Vogl et al. 
2011, Lamme r et al 2010].  
 
Both TACE procedures are performed under fluoroscopic guidance for catheter placement and infusion 
monitoring, with infusions continuing until near stasis in the tumor -feeding artery is observed [Van Ha 
2009]. Access to the tumor vasculatu re is achieved via a catheter placed in the hepatic artery. Technical 
 [ADDRESS_402799] catheter placement and drug administration, is achieved in approximately 98% 
of patients [Brown et al. 2012]. Residual tumoral viability at imaging post -embol ization is the primary 
criterion used in determining the need to re -treat. TACE is frequently iterative – up to 65- 75% of tumors 
will demonstrate residual blood flow and require repeat TACE or alternative treatments. The lack of efficacy on the initial tre atment may be due to reaching premature stasis because of slow flow conditions, 
vasospasm limiting delivery, or redistribution of flow to the lesion from an alternative hepatic branch after primary branch occlusion.    
 
Contrast -enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE -MRI) is the standard imaging modality used to assess 
response to TACE by [CONTACT_326539] [Brown et al. 2012; Hammerstingl et al. 2008; Akai et al. 2011]. The Society of Interventional Radiology guidelines recomm end imaging 
follow -up four weeks post treatment [Brown et al. 2012]. A lack of arterial phase enhancement is used to 
indicate the lack of residual tumoral blood flow due to complete embolization and tumor necrosis. This one month time point has been adopte d based on experience with the use of Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_326502] -up with 
contrast -enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scans; the non- tumor bearing liver requires 3- 4 weeks to 
eliminate the Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_326503] [Brown et al. 2012]. In CE -MRI, t he use of low 
molecular weight and water soluble contrast agents renders it difficult to differentiate granulation tissue 
and residual tumor perfusion and to differentiate peripheral viable tumors from inflammatory peritumoral infiltration if scanned within four weeks of treatment [Yan et al. 2002]. Differentiation between viable tumor and inflammation can be made in some cases by [CONTACT_326540]. Nevertheless, the cost of imaging and difficulty of inflammation in many cases has resu lted in follow -up 
imaging recommendation to remain at 1 month [Brown et al. 2012]. CECT is used in patients in whom MRI is contraindicated. Confluent, dense Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_326504], but may mask some residual tumor perfusion on CECT [Imaeda et al. 1993; Ito et al. 1995]. 
Following imaging, TACE or alternative treatment is repeated until a complete lack of arterial enhancement 
is achieved, after which tumoral response (evaluated by [CONTACT_326541] (mRECIST)) is assessed at [ADDRESS_402800]. CE -MRI may not be 
feasible in patients with metallic implants, renal contraindications (glomer ular filtration rates <30 mL/min/ 
1.73 m
2 [Shellock and Spi[INVESTIGATOR_326505] 2008]), the inability to breath hold or claustrophobia. CECT may be 
contraindicated in patients with severe allergy to iodinated contrast and renal impairment. The radiation 
exposure associat ed with repeated CT imaging (particularly in patients who undergo multiple TACE 
treatments) also renders CT a suboptimal imaging modality. Additionally, the costs and limited availability 
 [ADDRESS_402801] a significant, unnecessary burden on the h ealth system. A final limitation of 
existing imaging techniques is the required delay between treatment and imaging to evaluate response due 
to the inherent properties of the MRI/CT contrast media and the presence of Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_326506]. Conse quently, time to retreatment is prolonged and in patients where TACE is used to downstage 
disease, a decision regarding transplantation is delayed. Phase II efficacy and pharmacokinetic studies show 
liver function generally returns to normal within 7 days after DEB -TACE [Varela et al. 2007]; thus, 
retreatment before the standard [ADDRESS_402802] that provides earlier 
identification of tumoral blood flow after TACE would shorten the time between treatments and potentially 
improve patient outcomes. Once tumor avascularity is confirmed, patients could resume standardized CE -
MRI/CT long term follow -up protocols.  
 We propose the use of contrast -enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) as a potential solution. Ultrasound contrast 
agents are composed of a gas microbubble, encapsulated by [CONTACT_326542] [Goldberg et al. 
2001]. Ultrasound imaging is portable, provide s real time imaging, uses non -ionizing radiation, is less 
expensive than CT/MRI, and is more readily available than MRI/CT imaging [Lewin 2004]. While CEUS 
is currently only approved by [CONTACT_326543], the technique represents the primary ima ging 
modality for numerous hepatic and vascular applications worldwide [Claudon et al. 2012; Bouakaz and de Jong, 2007]. CEUS also offers significant cost savings relative to CE -MRI/CT in the characterization of 
liver lesions [Westwood et al. 2013]. After intravenous injection, ultrasound contrast agents permeate throughout the blood supply, including the neovascular tumor supply, thereby [CONTACT_326544] [Eisenbrey and Forsberg 2010]. The diameter of the contrast microbubbles (1 -8 µm) 
enables them to pass through the pulmonary capi[INVESTIGATOR_11037], but still restricts them to the vasculature, making 
them excellent intravascular blood pool agents [Correas et al. 2001]. Unlike the contrast agents used in 
MRI/CT, ultrasound contrast agents  are not nephrotoxic and have no renal contraindications, making them 
an exceptionally safe imaging test. The presence of Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_326507]. Unlike CT or MRI contrast agents, ultrasound contrast agents are co mpletely confined to the 
vascular space and thus enable clear visualization of the tumor vasculature, despi[INVESTIGATOR_326508]. Finally, the higher temporal resolution of ultrasound avoids motion artifacts in patients with 
poor breath holding c apability. Thus, CEUS is an attractive imaging alternative for identifying residual 
vascularity post -TACE.  
 
Recent technological advances in the field of medical ultrasound are expected to aid in these goals. 
Contrast -specific imaging techniques can isola te nonlinear microbubble signals from the surrounding tissue 
 13 to enhance visualization of vascularity [Philips 2004; Eisenbrey 2011a]. Additionally, the recent 
implementation of real- time 3D (i.e. 4D) transducers enables volumetric imaging at acceptable acq uisition 
rates (2 -6 volumes/second for 4D ultrasound vs. 20+ frames/ second for 2D ultrasound imaging) and image 
quality [Eisenbrey et al. 2012]. Finally, blood flow kinetics in tissue can be quantified using dynamic -CEUS 
(D-CEUS) or parametric imaging [Ei senbrey et al. 2011b] and these techniques have also been applied 
using 4D CEUS to enhance quantification of blood flow within a tissue volume [Sridharan et al. 2012].  
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_326509] 2D CEUS provides accurate and earlier identifi cation of residual 
tumoral blood flow (relative to current imaging guidelines [Brown et al. 2012]) in TACE patients treated 
with Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_143753] [Kono et al. 2007] and drug -eluting beads [Shaw et al. 2014]. Importantly, results from our 
CEUS study with c -TACE als o indicate that CEUS may be more accurate than CE -MRI/CT at 1 month for 
evaluating residual blood flow [Kono et al. 2007]. Other studies evaluating the use of 2D CEUS as a follow -
up imaging tool for TACE therapy reported that the lack of tumor enhancement correlates well with an avascular treatment response [Vallone et al. 2003; Salvaggio et al. 2010; Moschouris et al. 2010; Takizawa 
et al. 2013]. Xu et al. [2010] used static volumetric (3D) CEUS to monitor HCC response to local therapy 
and found the additi on of volumetric ultrasound provided improved diagnostic confidence relative to 2D 
CEUS. Nevertheless, in this study, static 3D CEUS was used (potentially missing important dynamic 
volumetric data), only 12 patients underwent TACE therapy (and the majority  of these TACE cases were 
treated in combination with ablation), effects of follow -up times were not investigated, and follow -up time 
ranged from [ADDRESS_402803] -treatment.  
 
The proposed agent for the curr ent study, Definity is a sterile non- pyrogenic suspension of liposome -
encapsulated perfluoropropane microbubbles [Goldberg et al 2001; Miller & Nanda 2004].  The contrast 
agent is composed of a blend of three phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_326510] a matrix of sodium c hloride, propylene 
glycol, and glycerin in water.  The contrast agent is supplied in a vial that contains the phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_1842] 
 [ADDRESS_402804]- size 2 ml vial and is prepared by 
[CONTACT_326525] a shaking device (Vialmix: ESPE, Seefeld, [LOCATION_013]).   
 Definity is currently only approved for use in echocardiography.  The agent will be used as an off -label 
indication for this study.  We intend to apply for an FDA investigator -instantiated I ND for the off- label 
usage of Definity for the evaluation of chemoembolization.

Definity is well tolerated and has been used extensively in echocardiography applications [Goldberg et al 2001].  In pre -market clinical trials, Defin ity was administered to 1716 patients.  In these patients 269 
(8.4%) reported at least one adverse event.  Of these events, 26 were classified as serious including 19 
(1.1%) patients experiencing serious cardiopulmonary symptoms including eight deaths.  Th e deaths 
occurred several days after activated Definity administration and appear to be related to the course of 
underlying disease.  Of the 11 other serious adverse events, which appeared within days of the drug 
administration (2- 15 days), all appeared to be a progression of underlying cardiac and non- cardiac disease.  
However, a role for Definity in the initiation or course of these adverse events can not be ruled out. Of the 
reported adverse reactions following the use of Definity the most frequently rep orted were headache (2.3%), 
back and renal pain (2.1%), flushing (1.1%), and nausea (1.0%).  Additional risks associated with the contrast material are described in the attached Definity Product insert (Appendix B). All of the non- serious 
reported side eff ects have been transient, usually lasting only a few minutes.

one month, this will reduce time to retreatment, potentially improving patient outcomes.    We propose a clinical trial to determine the accuracy of using CEUS for the evaluation of TACE of HCC .  
The purpose of this study is to compare ultrasound derived vascularity and blood flow measurements at 
varying time intervals to both the clinical evaluation standar d and patient outcomes.  
 
2.   TRIAL OBJECTIVES 
 
Trial Objectives: The primary objective of this trial is to:  
- To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of 2D and 4D contrast enhanced ultrasound for 
monitoring transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) response [ADDRESS_402806] -enhanced magnetic resonance (MRI) or computed 
tomography (CT) imaging  
 
The secondary aim of this trial is to:  
- To develop quantitative biomarkers based on the ultrasound contrast a gent kinetics for identifying 
patients requiring retreatment of residual disease.   
 
3. TRIAL DESIGN  
This is an open -label, non -randomized trial that will be conducted at three clinical sites.  The subject 
population will be patients undergoing transarterial chemoembolization for the treatment of hepatocellular 
carcinoma (HCC) at Thomas Jefferson University, The University of [LOCATION_004], San Diego, and The 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_326511] . Patients will receive a contrast -enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) 
exam the morning prior to embolization, approximately one week post -embolization, and at their one month 
 16 MRI follow up (scheduled as part of their clinical standard of care).

5. MEDICATIONS  
Definity will be provided by [CONTACT_326548], Billerica, MA.  An FDA Sponsor -Investigator 
IND will be obtained prior to beginning the trial.  
 
Definity is a sterile, non -pyrogenic suspension of liposome -encapsulated perfluoropropane microbubbles 
[Goldberg et al 2001; Miller & Nanda 2004].  The contrast agent is composed of a blend of three 
phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_326510] a matrix of sodium chloride, propylene glycol, and glycerin in water.  The contra st agent is supplied in a vial that contains the phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_326512].  The 
microbubble agent is supplied in a standard- size 2 ml vial and is prepared by [CONTACT_326549] 
 18 of a shaking device (Vialmix: ESPE, Seefeld, [LOCATION_013]) .  Detailed resuspension instructions are provided 
in the Definity Product Insert, found in Appendix B.  
 
Definity will be stored in a secure cabinet, with only the study investigators and research personnel having access.  Unused drug and empty vials will be properly disposed of after reconciling in the log of 
study drug. 
 
5.[ADDRESS_402812] agent.  Subjects will receive a bolus injection of up to 0.6 ml. All 
injections will be performed at a steady rate not to exceed 1 ml/sec. If contrast is not detected within the 
tumor, the injection may be repeated with the total cumulative dose not to exceed 1.5 ml. Each bolus 
injection of Definity will be followed with a very slow flush of 10 ml of normal saline.  
 
5.2 Contraindications  
Definity should not be administered to patients with known or suspected hypersensitivi ty to perflutren. The 
safety of Definity in patients with  1) severe emphysema, pulmonary vasculitis or a history of pulmonary 
emboli; 2) confirmed or suspected severe liver lesions; and 3 ) respi[INVESTIGATOR_326513].  Therefore, pat ients with any of these conditions will be excluded from participation.  
 
5.3  Randomization  
This is a non -randomized trial; therefore, no randomization procedure is required.  
 
5.4 Blinding and Unblinding Methods  
This is an open- label trial; therefore, no b linding or unblinding procedures for the trial drug are required.  
 
5.5  Storage  
Definity vials will be stored in a secure refrigerator, with only the study investigators and research personnel having access.  The study research nurse will be responsible f or drug suspension and inventory control.  
 
6.  TRIAL PROCEDURES  
 19 6.1 Patient Enrollment  
Patients will be identified and consecutively approached from each institution’s Hepatology / Transplant 
Surgery and Interventional Radiology practices (by [CONTACT_25733]’s Hepatology or Interventional Radiology co -
investigators). An investigator or research coordinator will explain the study to the patient. The patient will be given time to consider the risks and benefits of the study and to ask questions about participation. A 
consent form will be reviewed with the patient  
 
6.[ADDRESS_402813] the presence of inclusion criteria and absence of exclusion criteria verified by 
[CONTACT_1541] a medical history.  A full history and physical examination will be obtained from the patient’s 
referring physician .  If the subject is a woman of childbearing age as defined in the inclusion criteria (section 
4.1), she will have a urine pregnancy test prior to each CEUS study (the results of which will be made 
available to the subject prior to study initiation). In the event a patient presents with a lesion that is expected 
to be difficult to view on ultrasound (for example, smaller lesions located high on the liver dome), grayscale 
ultrasound imaging will quickl y be performed to ensure the lesion is visible on ultrasound and that the 
patient is suitable for study inclusion. Based on preliminary studies, approximately 10 -30% of TACE 
patients will present with lesions that are not detectable on baseline ultrasound (generally a smaller, 
nonvisible percentage compared to traditional liver mass ultrasound characterization studies). Part icular 
issues tend to arise in cirrhotic patients with smaller lesions at the dome of the liver [Kono et al. 2007]. 
Patients with masses not visible on B -mode ultrasound will be treated as failed cases and reported, but not 
followed with CEUS or counted towards our [ADDRESS_402814] power Doppler imaging (PDI). 
Following baseline imaging, patients will receive a bolus IV injection of up to 0.6 ml of Definity, followed 
by a 10 cc saline flush. Since Definity is currently only approved for echocardiography, we will apply to 
the FDA for an investigational new drug application for CEUS evaluation of TACE (similar to our previous 
study [Shaw at el. 2014]).  
 All CEUS imaging will be performed using the dual B -mode (used to locate anatomical features) and 
nonlinear contrast (to identify the ultrasound contrast agent) imaging mode. A low mechanical index (< 
0.1) will be used to minimize microbubble destr uction during imaging. The standard nonlinear imaging 
 [ADDRESS_402815] imaging software will be used (transmitting at 2 MHz, receiving at the 4 
MHz harmonic), and gain settings will be adjusted to minimize nonlinear signals prior to contr ast injection. 
Additionally, the focal zone will be placed at the approximate depth of the lesion to maximize the generation of nonlinear signals during CEUS. During the first contrast injection, 2D CEUS will be performed using the coded harmonics nonlinea r imaging package on the unit. The approximate tumor mid -line will be 
imaged until homogenous liver enhancement is achieved (approximately [ADDRESS_402816] injection), followed by [CONTACT_326524]. Sweeps will then be acquired in the sagitta l plane, before 
returning to the original plane. Imaging will be continued until contrast washout is observed (approximately 3-4 minutes), after which data will be digitally stored for later review. A ten to fifteen minute wait period 
will be observed betw een injections to allow for complete ultrasound contrast agent clearance. A region of 
interest encompassing the entire tumor volume and margin will then be selected in 4D mode.  Baseline imaging of the tumor will be repeated in 4D mode in grayscale B -mode. The line density (a measure of 
image quality) may also be adjusted to achieve adequate volume acquisition rates (>0.5 volumes/ second). A second bolus injection of up to 0.6 ml Definity followed by 10 cc saline flush will again be administered 
during cont inuous tumor imaging in 4D, which uses the machine’s coded harmonics package. If sufficient 
contrast is not detected in either mode , the injection may be repeated with the total cumulative study dose 
not to exceed 1.[ADDRESS_402817] washout is observed and then digitally stored in 
digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) format for later review.

6.5 Efficacy Assessments  
Following reader training, each reader (all of whom have previous experience with CEUS and volumetric 
ultrasound) will be asked to evaluate all [ADDRESS_402819] be asked to review both the patient’s baseline CE-MRI/CT and CEUS exams to identify the size and location of the treated mass. Following baseline 
review, each reader will review the 1 -2 week and 1 month CEUS exam (in random order). Intratumoral 
blood flow will be assessed as present or not present. Readers will then be asked to interpret the patient’s 
1 month follow -up CE -MRI/CT images and again evaluate the need to retreat base d on residual blood 
flow. Finally, when available, readers will review subsequent CE -MRI/CT imaging studies (up to six 
months post TACE). MRI/CT evaluations will be based on mRECIST criteria.  All imaging studies will 
be read twice by [CONTACT_30783]. Studies will be presented in random order. The second round reads will be 
 [ADDRESS_402820]. Outcomes will be defined as incompletely treated (i.e. 
requiring retreatment) based on (in order of preference of reference standard): a) pathol ogical 
examination of explanted livers demonstrating live tumors; b) tumor enhancement seen with CT or MR and confirmed via angiography during retreatment; c) tumor growth on [ADDRESS_402821]/MRI; 
or d) asymmetrical or nodular tumor enhancement on C E-MRI/CT on 6 month follow -up. Incomplete 
treatment on CEUS (2D or 4D) will be evaluated by [CONTACT_326531].  
 Quantitative analysis of 2D and 4D CEUS  datasets will be performed off -line using Matlab (Mathworks, 
Natick, MA). Motion compensation will first be performed using modified approaches of a either a kernel matching [Dave et al. 2009] or a dual mode registration [Bouhlel et al. 2014] motion compe nsation 
technique. Parametric images of both the mass and surrounding liver tissue will be generated using 2D [Eisenbrey et al. 2011b] and 4D [Sridharan et al. 2014] algorithms previously developed by [CONTACT_326550], perfusion, time to peak, and area under the time intensity curve.  Based on 
images or volumes from the arterial wash -in phase, images will be cropped to include the tumor and 
margins of 20% of the mass diameter. Vascular skeletonization of the mass and surrounding margins  will 
then be performed [Eisenbrey et al. 2011c] and fractal dimensionality of the skeletonized images 
calculated (another potential quantifiable indicator of malignancy [Taverna et al. 2009]). Differences in 
all quantified parameters between pre-  and post - treatment will then be calculated and compared between 
groups to determine if significant biomarkers exist in identifying patients in need of re -treatment.

 6.6.4 Safety Assessment and Follow -Up 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_326514] 7 (for non- serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation. At each study 
visit, the invest igator (or designee) will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit. 
Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  
 The subjects will be monitored for AEs during the entire procedure.  All AEs, including observed or volunteered problems, complaints, signs or symptoms, and diagnoses, occurring from the initiation of Definity dosing until [ADDRESS_402823] consider etiologies such as natural history of the underlying disease, concurrent illness, concomitant therapy, study -related procedures, accidents, and

7.[ADDRESS_402831] be sent to Thomas Jefferson University for inputting into the  database. Image data will be 
de-identified, transferred to Thomas Jefferson University, and placed on a secure server.  
 
7.2 Statistical Analyses  
Data analysis from this multi -center clinical trial will be performed to characterize 2D and 4D CEUS as a 
follow -up imaging tool for the evaluation of residual tumoral blood flow in patients with HCC treated with 
TACE.   
Our statistical analysis will address three major questions:   
1.  Does 2D and 4D CEUS 1- [ADDRESS_402832] TACE yield sensitivity and specificity greater than 90%  
for identifying residual tumor blood flow, thereby [CONTACT_326526] (relative 
to the current clinical standard) of patients in  need of ret reatment?  
2. Does 2D and 4D CEUS [ADDRESS_402833] TACE yield sensitivity and specificity greater than 90% for 
identifying residual tumor blood flow ,thereby [CONTACT_326527], safe, and cost -effective 
imaging alternative for identifying TACE patients in need of retreatment?  
3. Are quantifiable biomarkers generated by [CONTACT_326528] 2D and 4D CEUS exams able to differentiate between fully treated and incompletely treated masses by [CONTACT_326529]?  
 
The first three cases at each institution wil l be used as reader training cases and will not be included in the 
final analysis. In the event of all cases showing identical response (i.e. all incompletely or completely 
treated), the first case with an alternative outcome will be substituted for the 9
th case. Following reader 
training, each reader (all of whom have previous experience with CEUS and volumetric ultrasound) will be asked to evaluate all [ADDRESS_402834] DICOM viewer, while 4D cases will be viewed in 
GE’s 4D View software. Readers will first be asked to review both the patient’s baseline CE -MRI/CT and 
CEUS exams to identify the size and location of the treated mass. Following baseline review, each reader 
will review the 1 -2 week and 1 month CEUS exam (in random order). Intratumoral blood flow will be 
assessed as present or not present. Readers will then be asked to interpret the patient’s 1 month follow -up 
CE-MRI/CT images and again evaluate the need to retreat based on residual blood flow. Finally, when 
available, readers will review subsequent CE -MRI/CT imaging studies (up to six months post TACE). 
MRI/CT evaluations will be based on mRECIST criteria. All imaging studies will be read twice by [CONTACT_233963] 
 [ADDRESS_402835]. Outcomes will be defined as incompletely treated (i.e. requiring retreatment) based on (in order of preference of reference standard): a) pathological examination of explanted livers demonstrating live tumors; b) tumor enhancement seen with CT or MR and confirmed via angiography during retreatment; c) tumor growth on [ADDRESS_402836]/MRI; or d) asymmetr ical or nodular 
tumor enhancement on CE -MRI/CT on 6 month follow -up. Incomplete treatment on CEUS (2D or 4D) will 
be evaluated by [CONTACT_326554].   
 
For questions  1-2, sensitivity (the ability to detect patients in need of retreatment) and specificity (the ability 
to identify patients who do not require retreatment) will first be calculated on a reader by [CONTACT_326555]. Four  
[ADDRESS_402837].   These values will also be calculated based on the majority decision (i.e. 4 or more readers 
in agreement). In the event of discordant readings during this analysis, tumor outcome will be decided by [CONTACT_326533].  Differences between techniques (2D vs. 4D) and time points (1- [ADDRESS_402838] treatment) will be determined by [CONTACT_326534]/time point based on necessity of tumor retreatment. Intra -rater and 
inter-rater variability will be calculated using a Shrout and Fleiss Interclass Correlation [Shrout and Fleiss 
1979]. Finally, a logistical regression and analysis of variance will be performed to determine if significant 
variations exist between individual s ites (to determine operator dependence), lesion size (tumor size 
dependency) or between patients treated with cTACE vs. DEB -TACE (treatment dependency).  
 
 For statistical question  3, all quantitative parameters will be compared between fully treated and 
incompletely treated masses using a Student’s t -test. Additionally, lesions that demonstrate lack of residual 
enhancement at [ADDRESS_402839] this lower level of residual disease. 
Statistical analysis will be performed with assistance from the biostatistician co -investigator using Stata 
12.0 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX) with p values < 0.05 considered statistically signi ficant after a 
Bonferroni -type adjustment for multiple tests. These statistical tests will answer our three major questions 
regarding the sensitivity and specificity of 2D and 4D CEUS as an imaging tool for the follow -up of TACE 
 30 at 1-2 weeks and 1 month (s pecific aims 1 -2), as well as the influence of operator, reader, tumor size, and 
embolization material.  
 
7.2.[ADDRESS_402840] clinically important aims, aims 1 -2 will be used as the basis for the sample size analysis, where 
each patient represents an independent data point used to evaluate the technique’s sensitivity and specificity at both 1- 2 weeks and 1 month follow -up times. Based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_326517] 2D CEUS to evaluate 
TACE performed using Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_143753] [Kono et al. 2007] or drug- eluting- beads [Shaw et al. 2014], we expect to 
encounter a patient population in which up to 67% of patients require retreatment. A sample size  analysis 
was performed using a binomial test with On e-Sample Sensitivity and Specificity Analysis in NCSS/PASS 
2008 (NCSS, East Kaysville, UT) to estimate the number of cases required to produce a over 85%  power 
for this study. This analysis assumes  sensitivity and specificities of 98%, an alpha of 0.05, prevalence of 
disease of 66.7%, and null sensitivity and specificities of 90%. Results from this analysis are provided in 
tabular format below.

A total of 201 patients will be used in the final analysis for this study (the first 9 will be used as training 
cases and excluded), of which 135 (66.7%) will require retreatment .  A total sample size of 201 (which 
includes 133 subjects with the disease) achieves 99% power to reject the null hypothesis for sensitivity, 
and 85% power to reject the null hypothesis for specificity.

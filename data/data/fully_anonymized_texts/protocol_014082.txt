Feasibility of a Novel Systems Approach for Improving Utilization of Alzheimer's Disease Services 
Among Latinos Attending Primary Care Practices 
SPECIFIC AIMS  
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are a major cause of mortality and disability in later 
life and cost the US healthcare system more than cancer or heart disease .1,2 The National Alzheimer's Plan 
Act and the National Institutes of Health have identified ADRD disparities among ethnic minorities as a public 
health priority .3-[ADDRESS_421953] in clinics, patient and 
primary care provider (PCP) reduced ADRD knowledge, negative attitudes regarding ADRD, PCP’s lack of time, cultural and language barriers and health insurance status .
10-[ADDRESS_421954] services , as 93% of older Latinos have a usual source of healthcare. T he 
novel systems approach ( Alianza Latina/ Latino Alliance) will enhance timely ADRD diagnosis  and optimal care 
to minimize behavioral symptoms and cognitive decline among Latinos in a linguistically and culturally -
appropriate  way. Alianza Latina will use the C ollaborative Care Framework 21-24 that capi[INVESTIGATOR_340935] . 1) PCPs will undergo evidence -based training to enhance timely and culturally appropriate 
diagnosis and implement it in their work routine. 2) PCPs will detect, treat and refer Latino ADRD patients to a 
bilingual Health Navigator to provide chronic care management , which  will reduce PCP time burden .  
This proposal is a natural progression  of my work in  the Latino community throughout  my Diversity 
Supplement  [ADDRESS_421955] assessment and community -engaged research with Latino  community centers. This K01  will provide me with unique formal 
and hands -on training in 1)  evidence -based ADRD care, 2) health system s research and 3) qualitative  
research. I will address these gaps guided by [CONTACT_340948] s. Burns , Greiner  and Williams . This award 
will provide the necessary training to become an independent researcher  via mentored research, formal 
coursework, directed readings, seminars, conferences and other career development activities.  
Aim 1: Examine the current primary care models of ADRD care to identify what services are 
offered and how they are delivered  across a variety of settings . We will conduct semi- structured 
interviews among clinic staff, older Latinos with ADRD and their caregivers  in primary care clinics  from 
diverse regions . Our goal is to understand the barriers (and facilitators) that Latinos may encounter in 
primary care clin ics regarding ADRD detection and care including: 1) currently offered ADRD services, 
2) adherence to best practices , 
20,26 3) linguistic and cultural  barriers to ADRD service access  and 4) 
geographic differences in these services and barriers.  
Aim 2: Test the feasibility and acceptability of Alianza Latina.  Aim 2.a:  We will train P CPs from [ADDRESS_421956]. Aim 2.b. The Health Navigator  will provide  
100 patients/caregiver dyads referred by [CONTACT_340949] (e.g., flyers, online 
advertising) with care management, psychosocial support  and links to relevant community resources . 
We will assess the feasibility  and acceptability 27,28 of 1) PCP training and 2) patient and caregiver 
ADRD care . Feasibility outcomes will provide the necessary information to  further refine the intervention 
in preparation for a fully -powered R01 RCT comparing the efficacy  and cost -effectiveness of Alianza 
Latina vs Standard Care in the state of Kansas, a state where 11% of the population identifies as Latino 
and [ADDRESS_421957] a Latino population of more than 20% .[ADDRESS_421958] of Alzheimer’s disease 
 Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) pose a serious public health threat in the [LOCATION_003]. 
The share of American older adults is increasing and the risk of ADRD increases with age.39,[ADDRESS_421959] often experience disproportionate 
depression (~34%) and anxiety (~44%).[ADDRESS_421960] and is a 
priority for National Alzheimer’s Project Act (NAPA).[ADDRESS_421961] diagnosis and care among Latinos ? 
Addressing ADRD disparities among Latinos is a federal public health priority. Ethnic health and ADRD 
disparities are core targets of major [LOCATION_003] agencies including Healthy People 2020,[ADDRESS_421962] 
ethnoracial US minority (18%) [ADDRESS_421963] diagnosis  and care among Latinos include:  
• Lower detection of memory disorders by [CONTACT_39487] .6  
• Higher severity and duration of ADRD symptoms at time of first diagnosis .75-77  
• Higher risk of behavioral and psychological symptoms (BPSD)78 and more BPSD unmet needs.79 
• Higher risk of becoming an informal caregiver of a relative with ADRD and higher caregiver burden.80  
• Lower probability to use caregiver support services and anti -dementia medication. 7-9,81,[ADDRESS_421964] diagnosis and care do Latinos experience?  
Data from [ADDRESS_421965] older Latinos (93%) have a usual source of healthcare.[ADDRESS_421966] research with culturally diverse populations is critical;  however, most ADRD research among 
Latinos is observational.69,73,87,[ADDRESS_421967] diagnosis and care among Latinos is lacking. This proposal will implement a health systems intervention ( Alianza Latina- Latino Alliance) based on the C ollaborative Care Framework

effective in improving patient outcomes.89 The intervention capi[INVESTIGATOR_340936] ( PCPs ) to be the point of access to healthcare for Latino older adults , as most of them are insured

Collaborative Care Framework . Health Navigators will provide chronic care reliev ing PCP time burden and 
ensuring central Latino values  and barriers  are taken into account in the care process ( i.e. educating the family 
on ADRD, promoting  warm communication and tailoring messages in line with participants’ literacy levels ).[ADDRESS_421970], PCPs will be encouraged to use Medicare 
Annual Wellness visits to screen Latinos 65+. The Medicare Annual Wellness Visit is important as most Latinos 65+ have Medicare. T hese visits bring more revenue to clinics than the typi[INVESTIGATOR_340937] -based visit , 
and both the Annual Wellness Visit and problem -based visits can be billed concurrently.
86 Second, Alianza 
Latina will provide chronic care coordination services built around Medicare’s Chronic Care Management 
system , which will allow billing  services through Medicare.92,[ADDRESS_421971] in the community. This program is directed by [CONTACT_340950] (LSCSW) both appointed to the Kansas Governor’s Work Group to 
establish a statewide plan to address  ADRD. The goal of this program is to extend across Kansas. I will 
leverage this program’s connections, materials and staff to implement Alianza Latina.  
APPROACH  
The research proposal comprises two inter -related studies that aim to identify novel methods for 
improving diagnosis and care services among Latinos in primary care (See Figure 1). This project builds 
upon my connections with the Latino community and my mentors’ PCP connections, infrastr ucture , and Table 1. Barriers among  Latinos in  ADRD services addressed by [CONTACT_340951]:  
  Lack of clinics’ strategies to provide ADRD  detection &  care 
  Lack of PCP knowledge and nihilistic attitudes  
  Linguistic & cultural barriers  
  Fragmented community resources  
  Time constraints  Use of evidence -based recommendations  for timely ADRD 
detection and optimal care; PCP education in cultural proficiency 
and ADRD knowledge, detection and care skills and attitudes; 
linguistically and culturally proficient Health Navigators  who 
manage ADRD chronic care and refer to culturally appropriate 
community resources  
Individual barriers:  
  Lack of patient  and family  ADRD knowledge  PCPs and Health Navigators provide culturally appropriate patient 
and family ADRD education   
Insurance barriers:  
  Underinsurance  Health Navigators refer pati ents to  existing  financial assistance  
programs  for ADRD expenses if needed  
experiences in transforming healthcare systems. The project will be implemented over five years and will 
use mixed -methods spanning formative and intervention research. Results from Aim 1 will inform the 
logistics of the intervention proposed on Aim 2. Results from Aim 2 will help refine Alianza Latina and will 
inform the subsequent R01 study design proposal of a randomized clinical trial to assess its efficacy.     
Recruitment  Sites.  Aim 1 will be conducted in primary care clinics in the Kansas  City region  and other 
regions . Including clinics in different regions will increase generalizability of results as they vary in 
readiness to serve Latinos  and patient ancestry (i.e. Mexican/Caribbean) . Most clinics have already 
established a partnership with my mentors and are  committed to participate (see letters of support). Aim 2 
will include clinics (urban and rural) in the Kansas City  region. I will establish partnerships with additional  
clinics mee ting with administrators and highlighting the potential benefits  of Alianza Latina  to their clinic 
(i.e. PCP training and lower time burden in ADRD care) and their patients and relatives (i.e. improved care at no additional cost) . I will send clinics bi-weekly newsletters with information on key issues in ADRD 
management and program elements  to keep them engaged in our partnership. It is important to note that 
the role of all clinics -including those at the KU Medical Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] - is purely as recruitment  sites (of clinic 
staff and individuals with ADRD and their caregivers). No clinic will consent  or interview participants  or 
analyze data of any type for aims [ADDRESS_421972] ant (RA).

 Aim 1. Examine the current primary care models of ADRD care to identify what services are offered 
and how they are delivered across a variety of settings . 
Overview . This study will use mixed -methods, a methodology increasingly used by [CONTACT_340952]. 
Mixed -methods refers to collecting, analyzing and mixing quantitative and qualitative methodologies in a project.[ADDRESS_421973]: 
1. Focus groups with a Community Advisory Board  (CAB) to incorporate Latino , PCP  and ADRD care 
perspectives into existing ADRD care evidence- based recommendations .  
2. Semi- structured interviews with Latino ADRD patients and clinic staff to understand ADRD services 
currently used in clinics and how they could be tailored to address the needs of ADRD Latino patients .  
Community Advisory Board (CAB).  During my Diversity Supplement, I convened a CAB to incorporate their 
perspectives in our research. The CAB will include national and local leaders of the Latino community : Jason 
Resendez  (Director of the national advocacy group LatinosAgainstAlzheimer’s ), Diane Rojas  (Director of the 
Guadalupe Senior Center), Cielo Fernández (Director of Latino outreach at the Swope Clinic)  and Erica Andrade  
(Chief Program Officer of El Centro C ommunity Center ). The CAB will also include leaders in primary and ADRD 
care: [CONTACT_56777] (Primary Mentor), [CONTACT_340966] (Secondary Mentor)  and Natalia Loskutova, the Director of 
Evaluation at American Academy of Family Physicians, who has a special interest in the implementation of ADRD 
care in primary care clinics.  CAB members will receive $100 per meeting .

CAB members will be asked to participate in three focus groups in  Year [ADDRESS_421974] on 
Alzheimer’s evidence- based ADRD detection and care recommendations  that will be implemented in Aim 2  and 
identify gaps in the needs of Latino patients.20 The goal of the focus groups is to discuss the recommendations  
in hopes of understanding of the unique needs representative of Latino patients and modify the recommendations  
to include the CAB’s  suggestions.  The CAB will discuss  copi[INVESTIGATOR_340938]- based recommendations  syllabus, 
interactive course materials and themes. Semi -structure d discussion will include, but  will not be limited to, the 
following questions: What materials/content seems essential? What materials are missing to address the Latino 
patient  situation? What materials are useful but need to be changed to better address these needs? After this 
focus group, the RA and I (PI)  will revise the materials and curriculum and present them to the CAB who will 
evaluate revisions via semi -structured discussion and Likert scales. Year 2 and 4 will address how to optimize 
recruitment and retention. Years 3 and 5 will address how to refine Alianza Latina considering the study ’s findings . 
I will facilitate all focus groups b y asking clear , open- ended questions, balancing the participation of all participants 
avoiding few people to dominate the discussion, redirecting the discussion if it strays far off topic and checking 
with participants to ensure their message is understood. I will audiotape all focus groups.  
PCP and patient interviews.  These  60-minute semi -structured interviews will gather information about the 
ADRD care services currently in place and how they could be tailored to address the needs of ADRD Latino 
patients. We will recruit a purposive sample of PCPs  and Latino ADRD patients  from clinics in Kansas Cit y 
Metro , San Antonio, TX and Ft Meyers, FL. The RA and I will develop open- ended discussion guides  and 
conduct the interviews. A HIPAA- compliant company will transcribe the audiotaped interviews.  We will complete 
a checklist in all clinics  to assess adherence to ADRD evidence- based recommendations .[ADDRESS_421975] patients will receive a $ [ADDRESS_421976]  and PCPs will receive $ 40 for their time.  
Semi- s tructured discussion with clinic staff  will include, but will not be limited to , the following questions: 
1) Can you describe the typi[INVESTIGATOR_340939]  a patient 65 and older would receive in a yearly visit? 2) How are people 
with ADRD usually detected in this clinic? 3) What care do people with ADRD usually receive in this clinic? 4) 
Are there any particularities about that service with Latino patients?  5) What are some of the challenges to 
ADRD detection and care experienced with Latino patients?  
 Se mi- structured discussion with Latino ADRD patients and caregivers  will include, but will not be limited 
to, the following questions: 1) Can you describe the ADRD services received in this clinic? 2) What went well 
with these services  and w hat could be improved? 3) How relevant to your situation as a Latino patient were the 
services received? 4) What are some of  the additional challenges that should be considered in these services?   
Data Analysis and Dissemination.  M y mentor [CONTACT_69333]  has extensive expertise conducting mixed-
methods research. Sh e will assist me with analyses of findings on Aim 1. Focus groups  and interviews will be 
transcribed by a HIPAA- compliant professional transcription company. Central tendency estimates, frequencies 
and percentages will describe quantitative data on R Software.[ADDRESS_421977] diagnosis and care among Latinos. The intervention will be conducted at  the same 10 Kansas City clinics as Aim 1. Alianza Latina will use the Collaborative Care 
Framework (Table 1) and 
21-24 will partner  with primary care clinics  to 1) provide PCPs with  training and tools for 
timely ADRD diagnosis , optimal treatment  and cultural com petenc e and 2) incorporate Health Navigators to 
enhance ADRD care and reduce PCP burden (See Figure 2).  Feasibility  and acceptability outcomes will be 
obtained from metrics and surveys with PCPs, Latino patients with MCI and ADRD and their caregivers. Aim [ADDRESS_421978] types of study feasibility while focusing on the newly designed intervention.      
 Intervention.  The main components of Alianza Latina are 1) providing PCPs with education, training and tools 
for timely ADRD diagnosis and optimal treatment  and 2) providing Latino ADRD patients with enhanced chronic 
care through bilingual Health Navigators . These two components will be assessed in two separate sub- aims.  
Aim 2.a. Providin g P CPs with education, training and tools for timely ADRD diagnosis and optimal treatment. 
Alianza Latina will partner with [ADDRESS_421979] knowledge, skills 
and attitudes.104 For Cultural Competence Care, 
PCPs will complete an online course by [CONTACT_340953] & Human Services.
[ADDRESS_421980] knowledge, skills and attitudes, PCPs will 
receive a standardized online or in- person training 
modeled after Minnesota’s “ACT on Alzheimer’s“ ADRD Curriculum and a specific training developed 
by [CONTACT_37152].
[ADDRESS_421981] on 
Alzheimer’s ADRD Curriculum is free, self -directed 
and consists of 10 modules (understanding 
dementia; demographics; societal impact; early detection; screening; assessment and diagnosis; 
interventions; caregiver support; behavior as 
communication and philosophy of care). The in-
person training will take one day, will be delivered by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Burns’ ADRD collaborative care team and me and will cover the same topi[INVESTIGATOR_340940]. 
Both trainings will include specifics about ADRD 
detect ion and care among Latinos, including 
validated tools for Spanish speakers. All three courses provide Continuing Medical Education credits upon completion, which may incentivize PCP 
participation in Alianza Latina. In April, the KU ADC 
delivered a similar training event to [ADDRESS_421982] 
screener to all Latinos 65+. We will suggest using the Mini- Cog, as it is freely available, takes only three 
minutes to administer and has shown excellent psychometric properties in a multilingual US sample.[ADDRESS_421983] using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), as it is also freely available, short and has been 
shown to detect ADRD and MCI among US English and Spanish speaking individuals.107,108 Those screened 
positive will undergo a dementia work -up (i.e. family and medical history, physical exams, behavioral 
symptoms) which will use Latino- validated tools when possible. This information will inform ADRD diagnosis 
and prescription o f anti -dementia medication as needed. PCPs will be trained to refer ADRD patients to our 
bilingual  Health Navigator following diagnosis. Verbal consent to share PHI with the Health Navigator is 
acquired by [CONTACT_340954].   
Assessment Procedures and Measures.  Feasibility and acceptability assessments will include metrics and 
survey information from PCPs following  standard criteria for feasibility studies (Table 3 ).27,28 Metrics will assess 
PCP completion of training, assessments and referrals. PCPs will complete a baseline (BL)  survey  before 
training and a follow- up (FU) survey after they have detected and referred enough Latino ADRD patients to fill 
Aim 2.b’s enrollment in approximately seven months ( 100 Latino MCI/ ADRD patients  receiving chronic care 
services from the Health Navigators though Alianza Latina). FU surveys will assess implementation of 
screening in PCPs’ regular workflow and their satisfaction with the Alianza Latina training.      Figure 2. Flow chart of Alianza Latina  feasibility study design  

Aim 2. b. Providing Latino ADRD patients with enhanced ADRD chronic care through Health Navigators . The 
Health Navigator will be the single -point -of-contact  [CONTACT_340955] . The Health Navigator will 
be a Bachelor’s degree -level individual with experience working with the Latino community in health- related 
projects and will be trained and supervised closely by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Burns’ Social Worker  team. The training will include 
the ACT on Alzheimer’s online course for care managers, a Dementia Intensive one- day c ourse from the KU 
ADC and progressive shadowing to achieve independence supervised weekly by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Burns’ team. The KU ADC 
recently had a highly successful Dementia Intensive training for Social Workers drawing nearly [ADDRESS_421984] Health Navigator  visit will be in -person and will coincide with the BL assessment. The 
Health Navigator will perform a Clinical Intake Assessment using validated instruments when possible including 
the Brief Neuropsychiatry Inventory Questionnaire, Geriatric Depression Scale or the Functional Assessment 
Questionnaire.109 The initial Clinical Intake 
Assessment will result in a written “ Chronic Care  
Plan” that will be provided to the dyad and 
encour aged to be shared with their PCP. The Health 
Navigator will enroll the co- participant in CuidaTEXT a 
culturally tailored text message program to educate 
Latino caregivers on ADRD care.[ADDRESS_421985] stage.113 The Chronic Care Plan will use  evidence- and consensus -
based recommendations  to address those needs,20 including Gitlin’s non- pharmacologic management of 
behavioral symptoms protocol,46 the Reducing Disability in Alzheimer’s Disease community program to promote 
functioning and caregiver support,[ADDRESS_421986] by  [CONTACT_340956] , other clinicians,  or the research team . Outreach will include multiple in -
person (i.e., clinic referrals and health events) and remote methods (i.e., calls from research registries, online advertising and flyers). We will enroll  [ADDRESS_421987] person and staff will 
keep flexible hours and allow home visits. P articipants will receive $ 40 pre -paid cards for completing 
assessments at BL  and FU . All materials developed by [CONTACT_340957].
116  
Eligibility Criteria:  1 ) identify as Latino, 2) community dwelling, 3) diagnosed with MCI or ADRD by [CONTACT_340958] , other clinicians,  or the research team , 5) have a caregiver 18 years old or older and 6) access to 
a privately -owned cell phone with a flat rate fee for tex t messages .      
Recruitment Estimates.  B ased on the primary care population of our clinics, each serves an average of 12 
Latino individuals /day. We expect 12% to be 65 and older based on the Census.117 In 261 working days, they 
will serve  376 Latinos 65+. Because ADRD prevalence among Mexican- Americans is 10% , we expect 38 
Latinos 65+ with ADRD per year per clinic.72 In a conservative scenario, 66% of those with ADRD have never 
been diagnosed (28 per clinic) . Research shows that 74% of ADRD patients are willing to participate in Health 
Navigator services,[ADDRESS_421988] criteria for outcomes in feasibility studies (Table 3 ).27,28 
BL surveys will include sociodemographic data: age, gender, marital status, educational level, insurance type,

Data analysis and sample Size Justification.  Drs. Burns and Mahnken will guide me in the analysis of Aim 2. 
We will use R software to upload and analyze quantitative data.[ADDRESS_421990]- protected files at the KU ADC and will be accessible only to research staff. 
Alianza  Latina’s  primary outcomes will be assessed using simple descriptive statistics. The primary quantitative 
feasibility/process endpoints are dichotomous measures, so the proportions will be estimated as the main 
statistical results. Results will include 95% confidence intervals based on an exact binomial distribution. With an 
anticipated 50/100 PCPs integrating Alianza  Latina screenings to their regular workflow and 100 /[ADDRESS_421991] dyads who enroll in Health Navigator services, our confidence intervals will be within approximately ±11.0% and ± 7.4%, respectively, of thei r estimated proportions. These proportions  have been 
chosen based on clinically significant levels estimated in consensus between my mentors and I and from the 
literature.

allow a sufficiently accurate estimation of these important processes measures to inform the subsequent R01 
application. At the end of the study, my mentors, consultants and I will meet and review all results to make 
modifications to the intervention and study design and calculate the appropriate sample.

 CONSIDERATIONS, POTENTIAL PI[INVESTIGATOR_153019], AND LIMITATIONS  
This study aims to assess the feasibility of  Alianza Latina to inform the design and implementation of 
future, larger scale efficacy randomized controlled trials .[ADDRESS_421993] -intervention measures that will serve as efficacy outcomes in future randomized 
control trials (i.e. BPSD, quality of life). However, the main objective of those measurements in the current 
study is to evaluate assessment feasibility . If feasibility findings are favorable, we will conduct a fully -powered 
R01 RCT to assess efficacy  and cost -effectiveness. If not favorable, we will use the qualitative information 
gathered in the study and new research to refine the intervention and test its new feasibility before conducting an efficacy  trial. We have estimated that [ADDRESS_421994] participants in seven months. If 
recruitment is slow, we will identify Latino older adults in the community through our center’s recurrent ADRD 
educational events , the Latino community network  and the participant pool  I developed during my Diversity 
Supplement  and attempt to train their PCPs in the Alianza Latina services to speed up the process. A pre vious 
study trained and used abstracters to assess adherence to ADRD services recommendations at the clinics at 
all times.

with Latino patients? 5) What are some of the challenges to ADRD detection and care 
experienced with Latino patients?  
o  Se mi-structured discussion with Latino ADRD patients and caregivers  will include, but will 
not be limited to, the following questions: 1) Can you describe the ADRD services received in 
this clinic? 2) What went well with these services and what could be improved? 3) How relevant to your situation as a Latino patient were the services received? 4) What are some of the 
additional challenges that should be considered in these services?   
 
Data analysis . Interviews  and focus groups  will be recorded and analyzed employing content, domain, and 
taxonomic analysis. The Research Team  will code content using ATLAS -ti. They  will open -code transcripts by 
[CONTACT_340960], themes, and descriptions of behavior within the text. Later, they will group the themes into 
coding categories and develop a code map to categorize and retrieve comments on each theme. Two 
independent coders will code the transcripts and their agreement will be measured using kappa coefficient. Central tendency estimates, frequencies and percentages will describe quantitative data on R Software.   
 
Investigators/Ins titutions.  The team of investigators include Drs. Perales, Burns , Greiner, and Williams. The 
study will be conducted at KUMC and all source documents will be housed at KUMC. All investigators have completed the required human subjects training.

Risks to Human Subjects 
1.a. Human Subjects Involvement, Characteristics, and Design.  
Aim [ADDRESS_422000]. Alianza Latina will use the Collaborative Care Framework that 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_340944]. 1) PCPs will undergo training in evidence- based recommendations 
to enhance timely and culturally appropriate diagnosis and implement it in their work routine. 2) PCPs will 
detect, trea t and refer Latino ADRD patients to a bilingual Health Navigator to perform a Clinical Intake 
Assessment and subsequent ADRD Chronic Care Plan, which will reduce PCP time burden. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_340945], patients and Latino older adults.  
 
Eligibility criteria:  
• Latino patients: Eligible participants will  
o Identify as Latino,  
o Community dwelling,  
o Diagnosed with MCI or ADRD by [CONTACT_340961],  other clinicians, or the research team  
o Have a caregiver [ADDRESS_422001] access to a privately -owned cell phone. 
 
1.b. Study Procedures, Materials, and Potential Risks  
 
Treatment. The main components of Alianza Latina are 1) providing PCPs with education, training and tools for 
timely ADRD diagnosis and optimal treatment and 2) providing Latino ADRD patients with enhanced chronic 
care through bilingual Health Navigators. These two components will be assessed in two separate sub- aims.  
• P roviding PCPs with education, training and tools for timely ADRD diagnosis and optimal treatment.  
Alianza Latina will partner with [ADDRESS_422002] knowledge, skills and attitudes.104 For Cultural 
Competence Care, PCPs will complete an online course by [CONTACT_340953] & Human 
Services.[ADDRESS_422003] knowledge, skills and attitudes, PCPs will receive  a standardized online or in-
person training modeled after Minnesota’s “ACT on Alzheimer’s“ ADRD Curriculum and a specific 
training developed by [CONTACT_5051].[ADDRESS_422004] on Alzheimer’s ADRD Curriculum is free, 
self-directed and consists of 10 modules (understanding dementia; demographics; societal impact; early 
detection; screening; assessment and diagnosis; interventions; caregiver support; behavior as 
communication and philosophy of care). The in- person training will take one day, will be delivered by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Burns’ ADRD collaborative care team and me and will cover the same topi[INVESTIGATOR_340940]. Both 
trainings will include specifics about ADRD detection and care among Latinos, including validated tools 
for Spanish speakers. All three courses provide Continuing Medical Education credits upon completion, 
which may incentivize  PCP participation in Alianza Latina. In April, the KU ADC delivered a similar 
training event to [ADDRESS_422005] screener to all Latinos 65+. The Research team  
will suggest using the Mini- Cog, as it is freely available, takes only three minutes to administer and has 
shown excellent psychometric properties in a multilingual US sample.[ADDRESS_422006] using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), as it is also freely available, short and has been shown to detect ADRD and MCI among US English and Spanish speaking individuals.
107,108 Those 
screened positive will undergo a dementia work -up (i.e. family and medical history, physical exams, 
behavioral symptoms) which will use Latino- validated tools when possible. This information will inform 
ADRD diagnosis and prescription of anti- dementia medication as needed. PCPs will be trained to refer 
ADRD patients to the bilingual Health Navigator following diagnosis. Verbal consent to share PHI with 
the Health Navigator is acquired by [CONTACT_340954].  
• Providing Latino ADRD patients with enhanced ADRD chronic care through Health Navigators . The 
Health Navigator will be the single -point -of-contact  [CONTACT_340955] . The Health 
Navigator will be a Bachelor’s degree- level individual with experience working with the Latino community 
in health- related projects and will be trained and  supervised closely by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Burns’ Social Worker team. 
The training will include the ACT on Alzheimer’s online course for care managers, a Dementia Intensive 
one-day course from the KU ADC and progressive shadowing to achieve independence supervised 
weekly by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Burns’ team. The KU ADC recently had a highly successful Dementia Intensive training 
for Social Workers drawing nearly [ADDRESS_422007] ionnaire, Geriatric Depression Scale or the Functional Assessment 
Questionnaire.109 The initial Clinical Intake Assessment will r esult in a written “Chronic Care  Plan” that 
will be provided to the dyad and encouraged to be shared with their PCP. The Health Navigator will 
enroll the co- participant in CuidaTEXT a culturally tailored text message program to educate Latino 
caregivers on ADRD care.[ADDRESS_422008] stage.113 The Chronic Care Plan will use  evidence- and 
consensus -based recommendations  to address those needs,20 including Gitlin’s non- pharmacologic 
management of behavioral symptoms protocol,46 the Reducing Disability in Alzheimer’s Disease 
community program to promote functioning and caregiver support,[ADDRESS_422009] visit. Participants 
who sign the informed consent will be enrolled. Contacts can be either via KUMC -contracted Zoom videocalls, 
phone calls or in- person, depending on the participants’ preferences.   
 
Eligibility, consent, enrollment and baseline assessment . Eligibility criteria includes 1)  identify as Latino, 2) 
community dwelling, 3) diagnosed with MCI or ADRD by [CONTACT_340961] , other clinicians, or the research 
team , 4) have a caregiver 18 years  old or older and 5 ) access to a privately -owned cell phone. Based on the 
primary care population of our clinics, each serves an average of 12 Latino individuals/day. We expect 12% to be 65 and older based on the Census.
117 In 261 working days, they will serv e 376 Latinos 65+. Because ADRD 
prevalence among Mexican- Americans is 10%, we expect 38 Latinos 65+ with ADRD per year per clinic.72 In a 
conservative scenario, 66% of those with ADRD have never been diagnosed (28 per clinic). Research shows 
that 74% of ADRD patients are willing to participate in Health Navigator services,[ADDRESS_422010] criteria for outcomes in feasibility studies (Table 3 ).27,28 BL surveys will include sociodemographic 
data: age, gender, marital status, educational level, insurance type, household income, Latino origin and caregiver relationship 
118 and acculturation: English preference, place of birth and  years in the [LOCATION_003].119 Metrics 
will assess enrollment in Health Navigator services, six -month retention, completion of BL and FU assessments  
(i.e. BPSD and quality of life scales)  and adherence to Health Navigator visits. FU surveys will assess 
satisfaction with the Alianza Latina Health Navigator services.  
  
Retention and reimbursement . To reduce attrition, the Research Team  will collect contact [CONTACT_340962]. Participants will receive $20 
pre-paid cards for completing assessments at BL and FU. All materials developed by [CONTACT_340963].116 
 
Investigators/Institutions.  The team of investigators include Drs. Perales, Burns, Greiner, and Williams. The 
study will be conducted at KUMC and all source documents will be housed at KUMC. All investigators have 
completed the required human subjects training.  
 
Potential Risks. Pr ocedures in Aim [ADDRESS_422011] Risks  
2.a. Informed C onsent and Assent  
The Research Team will translate the informed consents from English to Spanish using translation- back 
translation guidelines from the World Health Organization. Informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_25755], trained staff. The informed consent will explain purposes of the study, its assessment procedures, and risks and benefits. The original signed consent form is kept with the participant’s confidential file and a copy is given to 
the participant.  
 
2.b. Protections Against Risk  
Regarding potential perception of boring, embarrassing or uncomfortable questions, interviewers are trained to 
be empathetic to minimize concerns, the consent will stress the voluntary nature of the study and of answering 
any questions as well as inform them of the risks of participating before signing the consent. The information collected cannot put participants at legal or physical risk of any kind. Although participants’ identifying information will be collected in the informed consent and for incentive purposes, this data will be kept separate 
from study data. All studies will undergo IRB approval. Identifiable information will be kept in secure file cabinets 
in a locked office and databases under password protection from the computer and the database. Digital audiotapes will be stored on secured university data servers. Audio files will be transcribed and all word processing files will be labeled with patient ID -codes only and stored in locked cabinets inside locked study 
offices. These databases will not be linked to interview information. Text messages will not contain personal identity information. Study participants will be advised to protect their phone and turn off preview features that allow a preview of the message to be automatically displayed on the screen. Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_340946] -
out of receiving text messages in a timely manner. We will hire a text message vendor with built- in security 
features that will protect information.  The Health Navigator will be comprehensively trained by [CONTACT_340964]. Burns’ experienced Health Navigators. The Health Navigator will follow specific guidelines for the management of ADRD and will be directly supervised by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Burns’ team.  
 Additionally, the following policies will be adopted to assure the safety of the participants in this study:  
1. Strict adherence to institutional regulations for conducting clinical research 
2. The involved support staff will be adequately trained to conduct human research and will have 
completed the necessary institutional web- based training prior to the study  
3. The Research Team  will comply with HIPPA regulation and commit to maintaining the patient 
confidentiality.  
4. Any research presentations or publications from the proposed studies will not disclose any personal 
identity information.  
 
 
 3. Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to Research Participants and Others  
ADRD Participants will be able to speak with a Health Navigator with experience in implementing evidence and 
consensus -based guidelines to address problems associated with ADRD. Clinical Intake Assessments will 
include behavioral symptoms, safety at home, driving, legal issues and others. Alianza Latina also has the 
potential to detect ADRD timely for early provision of care, which may improve patients’ and caregivers’ quality of life. In addition, participants will be given the opportunity to contribute to finding better ways of improving the 
quality of life among people with ADRD and their caregivers by [CONTACT_4907]. Participants will be 
compensated for assessments and will be informed that incentives are not contingent on any outcome.  
 4. Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained  
Society benefits from research advances in aging and the maintenance of cognitive and brain health through research that has adequate numbers of participants. This study will enhance our understanding on how to 
improve the delivery of ADRD services among Latinos in primary care clinics.  
5. Data Safety Monitoring Plan  
This Human Subjects Research meets the National Institutes of Health (NIH) definition of a clinical trial. An 
appropriate Data Safety Monitoring Plan has been developed. The purpose of the Data Safety Monitoring Plan 
is to ensure the safety of study participants and the validity of data, in compliance with NIH requirement for Data Safety Monitoring for Clinical Research.  
Data Monitoring Plan:  Data will be collected using laptop computers and directly entered into a password 
protec ted Microsoft Access Database that will be stored on study network folder at the University of Kansas 
Medical Center that is only accessible to study staff. The codes sheet that links the study identification number 
with participant names will be stored separately from data in a password protected Microsoft Excel

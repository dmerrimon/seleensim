COSMOS -Mind PROTOCOL  
 
1. BACKGROUND   
 
 This study will be conducted in partnership with a large funded randomized controlled trial , the COcoa 
Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study (COSMOS) ,1,[ADDRESS_899756] 
multivitamin  (MTV) in adults 65 years and older , concurrently with their evaluation  of cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) and cancer  endpoints .  
 
Cocoa Flavanol Effects on Cardiovascular Health  
 
 Cocoa, in its unprocessed form, contains high quantities of catechins and epi[INVESTIGATOR_40243], a subclass of 
flavonoids known as flavanols,3,[ADDRESS_899757] of 
Panama  – protections that were  lost with migration to urban areas. Extensive studies of the Kunas’ lifestyle  
identified their dietary exposure to large amount s of cocoa flavanols as the primary con tributing factor .[ADDRESS_899758] favorable effects on cardiovascular 
health ,11-15 influencing  endothelial function and flow -mediated dilation,16,17 blood pressure,18-20 platelet adhesion 
and aggregation,21,22 lipid profiles,20,23,24 antioxidant capacity,20,25,26 systemic inflammation,27 and insulin 
sens itivity and β -cell function.20,28,29 Pi[INVESTIGATOR_666285] 100 participants with 4 -12 weeks of varying doses of 
cocoa flavanols in different  patient groups provide consistent evidence for cardiovascular benefits at doses 
>700 mg/da y and without adverse events.20,29-[ADDRESS_899759] association between vascular and cognitive 
health.34-36 This association was the focus of a recent study of over 9,000 older adults drawn from the National 
Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center : increased vascular risk , which included history of CVD and atrial fibrillation , 
predicted faster rates of cognitive decline in cognitively normal adults and in individuals with mild cognitive 
impairment (MC I).[ADDRESS_899760] of flavanols in 
healthy older adults comes from observational studies , and a  few small but promising controlled trials.45,46 In 
one large prospective study  of 1640 older adults (≥65 yrs) followed for 10 years,47 dietary intake of flavonoid -
rich food (dark chocolate, wine, tea) was positively correlate d with cognitive performance at baseline and over 
time in a dose -dependent manner. At the end of follow -up, participants in the lowest quartile for flavonoid 
COSMOS -Mind Protocol, v0 5: 14Jun2017 
 
 intake had lower Mini -Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores vs. those in the highest quartile.  A favorable 
dose response of flavonoid intake on cognition was also reported in a large cross -sectional Norwegian study  
for a more extensive set of outcomes measuri ng attention and task -switching, verbal fluency, and spatial 
perception.[ADDRESS_899761] and possibly enhance cogn itive function ,20,54,55 a variability that likely reflects differences in 
methodology and/or extract formulation. In a small randomized, double -blind, [ADDRESS_899762] that is very similar to that administered in COSMOS, Brickman , et al.  reported increased 
blood flow in the dentate gyrus and an associated improvement on a validated dentate gyrus -dependent 
memory task  in older adults (50 -69 years) .[ADDRESS_899763] support for the prop osed study is provided by [CONTACT_666296], Cognition, and Aging Study, a double -blind, 8 -week randomized controlled  trial of cocoa 
flavanols in 90 cognitively healthy older adults20 and in 90 individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment  
(MCI)55 at high risk for AD dementia . Participants consume d a daily drink with a high (993  mg) or medium (520 
mg) dose , versus a low (45 mg) dose , of cocoa flavanols. Compliance exceeded 97% without adverse events. 
In both the healthy and MCI cohorts, p erformance on tests of  attention and processing speed,  task-switching 
and working memory, verbal fluency, and the global cognitive composite outcome improved for those in the 
high- and medium -dose groups  relative to the low-dose group. In these participants, cocoa flavanols als o 
lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressures, increased insulin sensitivity , and reduced a potent marker of 
oxidative stress . In both groups , a favorable treatment effect on insulin sensitivity was the primary determinant 
of cognitive respons e, consistent with a substantial body of work linking glucose regulation and cognitive 
function in older adults.56-[ADDRESS_899764] of cocoa flavanols , also reported by [CONTACT_2312],13 has 
importan t implicat ions for older adults  for whom  the combined prevalen ce rate of type 2 diabetes and 
prediabetes exceeds 75% nationwide.[ADDRESS_899765]’s  excellent tolerability  profile provides added translational value . 
 
Micronutrient Supplementation (Multivitamin) Effects on Cognit ion 
 
 COSMOS -Mind will also  test whether daily use of a standard multivitamin benefits cognition in older adults . 
Although essential nutrient deficiencies in older adults have been associated with a higher risk of cognitive 
decline and dementia,61 the results of other studies examining  MTV  use for cognitive benefit remain  
controversial.62 Multivitamin use alone or with other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_666286] (RCTs) .[ADDRESS_899766] 75 years old or with a possible micronutrient deficiency at baseline (as per a risk 
questionnaire).72 The Physician’s Health Study (N=5947 , ≥65 years old) reported no effect of m ultivitamin use 
on cognition  in older men .[ADDRESS_899767].

2. OBJECTIVES  
 
     COSMOS -Mind is an ancillary cognitive study to the large randomized double -blind, placebo -controlled 
COSMOS trial, coordinated through Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  (BWH). The parent trial will test whether 
high-potency cocoa extract supplement administered alone or in combination with  a standard multivitamin 
reduce risks of CVD and cancer in older adults.  COSMOS -Mind will test whether 3 years of treatment with 
these supplements improves cognitive function and reduce s risk of cognitive impairment, including AD and 
other  forms of dement ia.   
 
Primary Aim  
 
• Test whether random assignment to daily cocoa extract (capsule containing 750 mg/d flavanols, including 
75 mg ( -)-epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874] , and 90 mg theobromine), compared to placebo, has favorable effects on a 
composite measure  of cognitive function , over 3 year s of follow -up in men and women who are 65 years 
and older  
 
Secondary Aims  
 
• Examine the effects of MTV use over 3 years of follow -up, relative to placebo,  on a composite measure of 
cognitive function  
• Assess treatment effects on incident MCI, and AD and other related dementias  
• Compare  intervention effects on  cognitive domains of  executive function and epi[INVESTIGATOR_666287]  
 
• Examine consistency of treatment response  for subgroups defined by [CONTACT_654], sex, body mass index, baseline 
cognitive status, CVD, and type 2 diabetes  
• Examine treatment effects on measures of sleep quality, depressive symptoms, and subjective memory 
concerns   
• Share COSMOS -Mind data with the parent trial and its ancillary studies  to expand  its scientific impact  
 
3. DESCRIPTION OF PARENT TRIAL  (COSMOS)  
 
 COSMOS  is supported through an investigator -initiated award from Mars SymbioScience (PIs: Drs. 
Manson and Sesso of BWH ), and is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 2x2 factorial clinical trial in 
18,[ADDRESS_899768] supplement (capsules 
containing 750 mg/d flavanols, including 75 mg ( -)-epi[INVESTIGATOR_26874], and 90 mg theobromine) and a daily MTV  
(Centrum Silver ®, provided by [CONTACT_4618] ) in the prevention of CVD  and can cer. COSMOS participants will be 
recruited from 2 large national cohorts of older adults (Women’s Health Initiative Extension Study  
[observational; N=73,991];  VITamin D and OmegA -3 TriaL  [eligible but unenrolled candidates; N= 89,373 ]). The 
mean treatment a nd follow -up period in COSMOS  will be  [ADDRESS_899769] supplements while in the trial. Adherence  and dietary intake of non-study 
supplements  will be assessed  via self -report using semi -annual questionnaires and pi[INVESTIGATOR_666288] a subset. A 3-month placebo run -in will eliminate those with poor compliance 
before randomization.  
 
4. STUDY POPULATION  
 
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
 
COSMOS -Mind Protocol, v0 5: 14Jun2017 
 
  COSMOS -Mind will include  [ADDRESS_899770] 65 years of age , with 
approximately equal distribution of women and men .  
 The study will exclude  participants with insulin -dependent diabetes . Insulin therapy, often associated with 
chronic hyperinsulinemia, can worsen cognition74 and therefore potentially mask beneficial effects of the cocoa 
flavanols. COSMOS participants co-enrolled in the WHI Memory Study  (WHIMS) will be excluded given their 
prior expos ure to COSMOS -Mind cognitive test s. Also, participants who are unable to complete the baseline 
cognitive assessment  will not be permitted to continue in the study. Adults with dementia will likely self -select 
out of enrollment in COSMOS -Mind, or be excluded given the demands of the placebo run -in period required 
for COSMOS. For the few with mild dementia who may enroll in COSMOS -Mind, randomization will ensure 
equal d istribution by [CONTACT_15500] . Pre-enrollment cognitive assessments to identify dementia are not 
feasible for this large simple trial.  
 
Recruitment and Consenting  
 
 Eligible COSMOS participants will be approached for enrollment in COSMOS -Mind and a second cognitive 
ancillary study (“COSMOS -Web”: involves a brief online computer assessment) using a single approach letter 
and recruitment flyer during the placebo run -in phase  of the COSMOS trial . These materials provide 
information about COSMOS -Mind, expectations of participants, what is provided to participants, and how to 
enroll in the sub -study. Participants can choose to participate in one, both, or neither sub -study and will let the 
BWH Coordinating Center know of their decision by [CONTACT_666297] a provided form. Consent to 
participate will be implied when participants indicate their willingness to participate in COSMOS -Mind on this 
form or by [CONTACT_666298] . Implied consent  will be used given the low 
participant burden and low risk associated with study participation as per Wake Forest School of Medicine IRB 
accepted practices.  
 Once enrolled, the COSMOS team at BWH will provide contact [CONTACT_666299] -Mind participants to the Wake Forest COSMOS -Mind team using a secure web -based data 
transfer system. This seamless  exchange of information between sites will permit timely accounti ng to ensure 
that the targeted demographics for enrollment are achieved  (e.g. gender, age, race, ethnicity) . 
  
5. OUTCOMES   
 
     Face -to-face assessments of cognitive function ing are expensive in large multi -site studies and thus 
telephone -based protocols have been developed and validated . Telephone -based assessment s have  been 
used successfully in other studies and provide a  valid and cost -effective method for tracking changes in 
cognitive status, including the development of MCI and dementia.  
 COSMOS -Mind will administer a telephone  cognitive assessment  to all participants annually by [CONTACT_666300] -Mind team . On the initial COSMOS -Mind call, consent  to 
participate in the study will be confirmed  and a brief hearing  test will be administered to assess  the participant’s 
ability to successfully complete the interview. The interview will be 45 to 60 minutes  in duration , and will include 
social time to support  the relationship, and time to complete the hearing screening , cognitive tests, and 
questionnaire s. The assessment battery consists of  6 validated tests and 3 validated questionnaires . A fourth 
validated questionnaire may be administered to a  knowledgeable friend or family member ( informant ) identified 
by [CONTACT_2299] i f cognitive scores fall below pre-specified threshold s on a test of global cognition (i.e., 
TICSm) at any assessment .  
 A secure web -based call tracking system will be used  to monitor participant contact , assessment dates, 
and attempts to complete interviews . Standard administration procedures of the telephone cognitive 
assessment will be for examiners to first record p articipants’ responses  on paper versions of the tests and then 
at a later time , enter the data into a dedicated and secure web -based database management system. As a 
quality assurance measure, eac h administration of the cognitive battery will be electronically audio -recorded to 
assist the examiner in scoring and to allow data quality assurance checks. Examiners will be trained and 
certified before administering their first assessment to a participa nt. Annual re -certification will be required.  
COSMOS -Mind Protocol, v0 5: 14Jun2017 
 
    
Hearing Assessment  
 
 Before administration of the cognitive test battery, each participant will be asked a set of standardized 
questions: “Do you usually have trouble hearing when one person speaks to you?” “Do you usually have 
trouble hearing over the phone?” “Can you hear me well enough?” “Do you use a hearing device?” and “Is it in 
place? ” and asked to repeat, “I have a cat so all I need is a dog.” Based on the participant’s responses , the 
examiner will ad just his/her test administration as needed . If hearing acuity is deemed significant ly impair ed, 
the examiner will terminate the assessment and the participant will not be permitted to continue in the study .  
 
Cognitive Assessment   
 
 Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status -modified  (TICSm) measures global cognitive function .[ADDRESS_899771]. The TICSm  has been previously validated for administration in older 
adults75-79 and used in large -scale epi[INVESTIGATOR_666289] .80 The TICSm correlates 
highly with other measures of global cognitive function , including the Mini -Mental State Exam (r=0.86), the 
Clinical Dementia Rating scale (r= -0.75), and wi th comparable cognitive tests administered face -to-face.79,81-83 
The TICSm has excellent sensitivity (0.87) and specificity (0.89) to differentiate older pe rsons with and without 
dementia84 and to identify  amnestic MCI ,85 and scores are normally distributed in population studies .86  
 
 Immediate and Delayed Story Recall  (SRI & II) measures verbal memory.[ADDRESS_899772] elements , and are asked to recall as many elements as possible  immediately after hearing 
the story  (SRI) and again 15 -20 minutes later  (SRII) . Alternate  parallel forms  of Story Recall will be 
administered from one annual assessment to the next, in counterbalanced order across participants, to 
minimize practice effect s.  
 
 Oral Trail Making Test  (OTMT )88,[ADDRESS_899773] (TMT)90 that 
measures attention (Part A) and executive function (Part B). The OTMT is highly correlated with the original 
TMT.91 For Part A, participants are asked to count from 1 to 25 as quickly as possible . For Part B , participants 
recite numbers and letters in an alternating fashion (1 -A-2-B-3-C…13) as quickly as possible. Time to complete 
each task (seconds ) is recorded .  
 
 Verbal Fluency  is a measure of language accessibility  and will be assessed using  two tasks . Category 
Fluency  requires participants to name [CONTACT_666314] a semantic category  as possible in 1 minute ; two 
trials will be administered (categories  = animals , vegetables). Letter Fluency  requires participant s to name [CONTACT_666315] a specific letter  of the alphabet in 1 minute ; two trials will be administered (letters  = 
F, L).[ADDRESS_899774]  (NST)93 measures simple attention and working memory  (i.e., ability to m anipulate 
transitory  information in short -term memory ). This task requires the participa nt to repeat a series of single -digit 
numbers of increasing span length, first  in the same order  as presented  by [CONTACT_4921]  (Number Span  
Forward ) and subsequently in the reverse order ( Number Span  Backward ). Number of correct responses  is 
recorded . 
 
 Digit Ordering Test  (DOT)[ADDRESS_899775] (e.g., ‘2 -7-1’ would be reordered as 
‘1-2-7’). For each span length, [ADDRESS_899776] responses is recorded.  
COSMOS -Mind Protocol, v0 5: 14Jun2017 
 
  
Additional  Measures  
 
 Cognitive Change Index  (CCI)94 is a self -report questionnaire listing common experiences (e.g., “recalling 
conversations a few days later”, “remembering names and faces of new people”) and participants indicate 
amount of perceived change over a specif ied duration in the past (e.g., 5 years)  using a Likert scale. To reduce 
participant burden, o nly the first 12 questions that address subjective memory concerns will be  used to 
calculate the CCI  score . The same 12 -item subscale is used in the large multice nter Alzheimer’s Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative -2 study .  
 
 Geriatric Depression Scale -Short Form  (GDS -SF) measures depressive symptom severity ,95,[ADDRESS_899777] cognitive function. This 15 -item (Y es/No) questionnaire  can be administered orally, and has 
excellent psychometric properties and normative data .97,98 Participants who score >8 on this scale or whose 
general responses to examiners’ questions suggest significant emotional distress will also receive  the 
supplemental Emotional Distress Test, which includes standardized questions about depressive severity and 
suicidal ideation. If a participant indicates any suicidal inclination, a study clinician experienced in the 
assessment and treatment  of geriatric psychiatric disorders ([CONTACT_412472]) will be informed , and will contact [CONTACT_666301] -up. 
 
 Women’s Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale  measures sleep disturbance and insomnia, which are 
known to impact  cognitive function . This [ADDRESS_899778] 
validity , and is sensitive to change over time .99,100 
 
Adjudication of Cognitive Status to Identify MCI, AD and Other Dementias  
 
 COSMOS -Mind will use the same procedures for ascertaining MCI and probable dementia (including AD)  
that w ere developed for WHIMS . All participants will be asked to identify a reliable informant at the time of the 
first telephone contact [CONTACT_666302]’s cognitive and functional status . 
After each telephone cognitive assessment, suspected cases of cognitive impairment will be identified when 
TICSm <31, or, in follow -up Years [ADDRESS_899779] a structured interview to complete the Dementia Questionnaire (DQ). This interview  includes questions 
about current cognitive and behavioral functioning, and medical events and conditions that could impact 
cognition  (e.g., stroke, psychiatric disorder s).  
 In Year s [ADDRESS_899780] results 
and medical information for participants who triggered a DQ  at any time during the study will be provided to 2 
independent dementia experts. Th e information reviewed will include: cognitive data ; self-report questionnaires 
about  cogn itive concerns, depression, sleep disturbance s, and information on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], medications 
and disabilities; informant responses on the DQ ; and relevant health information availa ble through the parent 
trial (including cardiovascular events and cancers ). MCI classifications will include  amnestic single domain, 
amnestic multi -domain, non -amnestic single domain, or non -amnestic multi -domain. If the adjudicator dyad 
agrees on the primary classification (MCI, probable dementia), no further discussion  will occur ; if the dyad 
disagrees, the case will be discussed by [CONTACT_666303] . 
Disagreements regarding MCI sub-classifications will be  resolved within dyads  and, if not possible, by [CONTACT_666304] . For participants who receive a classification of ‘dementia,’ a  letter will be sent to 
notify them  that the test results indicated a possible cognitive impairment , and to encourage follow -up with a 
physician and further evaluation.  
 
 
6. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
COSMOS -Mind Protocol, v0 5: 14Jun2017 
 
  The primary outcome for COSMOS -Mind is a composite measure of cognitive function that combines 
individual assessments of global cognitive function (TICSm), memory ( SR), and executive function (OTMT, 
Verbal Fluency, N ST, DOT ). The composite provides a quantifiable measure of cognitive function across 
multiple domains and  greater statistical power than individual measures even if the intervention effect varies 
moderately from one individual measure to another. It consolidates type [ADDRESS_899781] estimated from a 
factorial study design, and a generalized linear model101 with the dependent variable consisting of all measured 
annual changes from baseline across years of follow -up on every participant, regardle ss of ad herence (i.e. 
intent -to-treat).  Data from the individual tests will be combined using a multivariate analysis of covariance 
(MANOVA) model within this framework with adjustment for sex, education , and age. In this model, all 
observed data can be included without special procedures for missing data, provided they are missing at 
random. The estimated differences will be combined using the ordinary least squares global test statistic .102,[ADDRESS_899782] scores  will be analyzed  – 
paralleling the strategy used to test the primary hypothesis – in supporting analyses. The randomization effects 
on tertiary outcomes including cognitive complaints, sleep quality, and depressive symptoms will be assessed 
similarly to the intervention models used in the primary and secondary aims, and further tests will determine 
whether the treatments interact with respect to tertiary outcomes. Linear contrasts will be used to estimate 
treatment e ffects at [ADDRESS_899783] of treatments 
among subgroups formed by [CONTACT_654] (< 70 or >70 years old), sex, BMI (<25, 25 -29, >30 kg/m2), baseline cognitive 
function (median split on TICSm), cognitive complaints (median split on CCI), depressive symptoms (median 
split on GDS -SF), hypertension, and diabetes; additionally, the preceding variables will also be assessed as 
continuous moderato rs of the intervention effects. The distribution of follow -up times to MCI and dementia will 
be assessed with proportional hazards regression. COSMOS -Mind will incorporate CVD and cancer events 
(from the parent trial)  as change -points in the primary analys es to assess their impact on post -event cognitive 
trajectories.  When needed , transformations (e.g. Box -Cox, rank, probit) will be used to improve the symmetry 
of residual distributions.  
 
Interim Testing  
 
     No interim monitoring of treatment effects on cognitive outcomes is planned. COSMOS -Mind investigators 
will remain masked to treatment assignment until the parent trial is completed.  Routine reports will assess 
retention, data completeness and qualit y, and cognitive trajectories over time. These reports will be sent to the 
COSMOS Coordinating Center for inclusion in DSMB reports.  
 
Statistical Power  
 
 Longitudinal sequences of cognitive test scores from the WHIMS -ECHO study (N=2,878; 1 -6 years of 
annual telephone assessments) were used to calculate the longitudinal covariance of measures  in a simulation 
analysis . Loss-to-follow -up was set to accumulate at 5% per year , as per rates observed in WHIMS .104 Based 
COSMOS -Mind Protocol, v0 5: 14Jun2017 
 
 on previous studies,20,[ADDRESS_899784] appears quickly and is sustained over time . Calculations are 
based on 2 -sided tests with type 1 error set to 0.05 and 90% power for the primary outcome of a composite 
across all cognitive tests. Based on these and other projections, the 2 500-person sample in COSMOS -Mind 
will provide  >90% power to de tect a sustained effect size  of 0.[ADDRESS_899785] size that initially is 
0.15 SD; it also provides some leeway should the assumptions made above be not fully realized. Limiting 
follow -up to [ADDRESS_899786] risk of disclosing confidential information. The data 
will be collected for research purposes only. All paper records of the telephone assessment s will be stored in 
locked cabinets in locked rooms, accessible only to the COSMOS -Mind investigators and staff. Participants will 
be assigned a unique study identifier code on all study questionnaires and forms. All electronic data – including 
the master list pairing participants’ names and codes, recordings of telephone assessments, personal health 
information, and study outcomes – will be stored in password -protected files on a secure network in a secured 
area. This network is protect ed with frequently -updated anti -virus and anti -Trojan software, limited file sharing 
and file permissions to approved users only, and automated monitoring of access attempts; these procedures 
have successfully maintained security for many multicenter clini cal trials  coordinated by [CONTACT_337239] . 
COSMOS -Mind and COSMOS will develop data transfer procedures and protocols using password protection 
and encryption, to permit seamless and secure exchange of information. Safety monitoring will be provided by 
[CONTACT_9288] B of the parent trial.  
 
8. SAFETY MANAGEMENT  
 
Potential Risks  
 
 The COSMOS -Mind  procedures pose minimal risk to participants , which are primarily related to possible 
emotional discomfort related to cognitive testing and answering questions relating to self-perceptions of 
memory and mood. Participants could experience distress when learning  that they may have a significant 
cognitive impairment , following adjudication by [CONTACT_666305] .  COSMOS -Mind will only be contact[CONTACT_666306] (i.e. not those with MCI), thus the letter will likely support preexisting suspi[INVESTIGATOR_666290]’s cognitive status.  
 
Cognitive and Mood Assessment  
 
 Examiners will be extensively trained to identify and appropriately respond to discomfort a ssociated with 
cognitive testing, or questions about self -perceptions of memory or mood, including discontinuing the 
assessment, if necessary.  A study clinician experienced in the assessment and treatment of geriatric 
psychiatric disorders (Rapp) will contact [CONTACT_666307] . Similar telephone -based testing protocols have been extensively used in other studies (e.g., 
WHIMS -ECHO, WHIMS -Y) with relatively fewer reports of participant discomf ort in telephone -based versus 
face-to-face assessments.  
 
Disclosure Regarding Suspected Cognitive Impairment  
 
 Participants with an adjudicated classification of probable dementia will receive a letter to alert them that 
the COSMOS -Mind test results sugges t a significant cognitive impairment and to advise them to follow -up with 
their personal physician. A Release of Information form will be included with the letter with instructions to sign 
and return this form to the COSMOS -Mind team to request a summary of the results be sent to his/her primary 
care provider. T he adjudication panel of dementia experts (Baker, Rapp, Sachs) will be available to these 
COSMOS -Mind Protocol, v0 5: 14Jun2017 
 
 participants by [CONTACT_666308]. This disclosure protocol , developed for WHIMS  has identifi ed over 400 
cases of probable dementia since WHIMS was initiated.  
 A ‘Cognitive A lert’ will be generated when an informant endorses items on the DQ that indicate impaired 
functional status (i.e.: ‘yes’ to any of Q1 -Q6 ~AND ~ ‘yes’ to any of Q14-16, Q18 ; ~OR~ answer to Q10 
indicates diagnosis of dementia or AD) . When this occurs, members of the adjudication team (Baker, Rapp) 
will review the available test results  to assess  whether a classification of dementia is warranted. If so, the 
participant will receive the alert letter informing them of a possible cognitive impairment and to encourage 
follow -up. 
 
Protection against Risk  
 
 The principles listed in the current edition of the Declaration of Helsinki will be implemented. Appropriate  
measures will be in place to protect against the risk of disclo sing confidential information. The data will be 
collected for research purposes only. All paper records of the telephone assessment will be stored in locked 
cabinets in locked rooms, accessible only to the COSMOS -Mind investigators and staff.  Participants will be 
assigned a unique study identifier code on all study questionn aires and forms.  All electronic data – including 
the master list pairing participants’ names and codes, recordings of telephone assessments, personal health 
information, and study outcomes – will be stored in password -protected files on a secure network i n a secured 
area. This netwo rk is protected with frequently updated anti -virus and anti -Trojan software, limited file sharing 
and file permissions to approved users only, and automated monitoring of access attempts . These procedures 
have successfully maint ained security for many multicenter clinical trials. COSMOS -Mind will work with the 
COSMOS team at BWH to develop data transfer procedures and protocols using password protection and 
encryption, to permit seamless and s ecure exchange of information. Safety  monitoring will be provided by [CONTACT_666309].  
 
Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to Human Subjects and Others  
 
 There is an urgent need to identify effective strategies to slow or prevent age -related cognitive decline.  
Although there may be no direct benefit to the participant for taking part in the study, COSMOS -Mind will 
provide a time - and cost -efficient assessment of whether a promising, safe, and widely translatable intervention 
can preserve cognitive function in older adult s. 
 
Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained  
 
 COSMOS -Mind will expand the scientific scope of the parent trial to include data about potential cognitive 
effects of the treatments that may reduce risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer in older adults. This 
intervention is inexpensive, easily accessible, and safe.  If daily use  of high -potency cocoa flavanol extract , 
with or without a multivitamin, attenuate age -related cognitive decline and impairment, this research  could have 
significant implic ations for standard of care to protect and preserve cognitive function in a fast-growing aging 
population in the US and worldwide.  
 
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
 
 As an ancillary study to COSMOS, COSMOS -Mind will adhere to the reporting procedures to be  
established by [CONTACT_666310]. The COSMOS DSMB is expected to include representatives from the 
established VITAL and WHI DSMBs, together with additional experts in epi[INVESTIGATOR_623], biostatistics, and other 
relevant clinical ar eas, including CVD and cancer. The possibility that an adverse event is reported during the 
telephone assessment is small; however, should this occur, staff will notify the COSMOS team to initiate their 
safety protocols.

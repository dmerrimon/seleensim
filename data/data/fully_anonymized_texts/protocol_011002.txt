Composition:  
 Route:  RabAvert® Rabies Vaccine  
RabAvert®: ≥2.5 units [contains albumin (human), amphotericin B (may have trace amounts), bovine 
gelatin, chicken egg protein, chlortetracycline (may have trace amounts), neomycin (may have trace 
amounts); PCEC; grown in chicken fibroblast culture; supplied with diluent] . 
 
RabAvert® (Rabies Vaccine) produced by [CONTACT_188827] a sterile 
freeze -dried vacci ne obtained by [CONTACT_188828] -virus strain Flury LEP in primary cultures of 
chicken fibroblasts.  The strain Flury LEP was obtained from American Type Culture Collection as the 
59th egg passage.  The growth medium for propagation of the virus is a synth etic cell culture medium 
with the addition of human albumin, polygeline (processed bovine gelatin) and antibiotics.    The virus 
is inactivated with β -propi[INVESTIGATOR_188811], and further processed by [CONTACT_188829] a sucrose density -
gradient.  The vaccine is lyophilized after addition of a stabilizer solution which consists of buffered 
polygeline and potassium glutamate.    One dose of reconstituted vaccine contains less than 12 mg 
polygeline (processed bovine gelatin), less than 0.[ADDRESS_222899]; ovalbumin content is 
less than 3 ng/dose (1 mL), based on ELI SA.  In the final vaccine, neomycin is present at < 1 μg, 
chlortetracycline at < 20 ng, and amphotericin B at < 2 ng per dose.    RabAvert® is intended for 
intramuscular (IM) injection.  The vaccine contains no preservative and should be used immediately 
after reconstitution with the supplied Sterile Diluent for RabAvert® (Water for Injection).    The 
potency of the final product is determined by [CONTACT_188830] (NIH) mouse potency 
test using the US reference standard . 
 
 
 
 
After reconsti tution  the vaccine should be administered  immediately. The potency of 1.0 ml of 
RabAvert  Rabies vaccine is equal to or greater than 2.5 international units of rabies antigen.  The 
Intramuscular (IM) dose is 1.0 ml and the  intradermal (ID) dose is 0.1 ml.  
 
 
Human  Serum Albumin (HSA) Saline  
 
 
Normal Saline with 0.03%. human serum albumin added.

Statistical  
Methods:   Immu nogenic ity –Secondary objectives:  
 
Immunoge nicity  will be asses sed desc riptiv ely using the  following para meters:  
 Time points : Baseline, 28 days and 365 days after initial vaccine dose 
 Percentage of subjects in each group with 
titer of IgG antibodies above the protective limits (≥ 
0.5 IU/ml) at [ADDRESS_222904].  
  
 
 
 Statistical 
Methods: This will be a descriptive study to assess immunogenicity of a licensed rabies vaccine using test dosage 
schedules and routes of administration. No formal statistical hypothesis tests will be conducted. 
Descriptive analyses will be based on the per -protocol analysis sets.  
Exploratory statistical analyses of final data may be conducted, if indicated by [CONTACT_188832]. 
Parametric, non -parametric and resampling (bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) methods for statistical inference may be us ed 
in exploratory analyses, based on data compliance with assumptions of methods.  P -values  ≤ 0.05 will be 
considered significant and p -values ≤ 0.10 will be considered a trend. Confidence intervals will be 
constructed at α=0.05 and α=0.10.  When necessa ry, p-value corrections for multiple comparisons will be 
applied.  
Descriptive and any inferential analyses will be carried out using SAS Version 9.2 (or more recent 
versions), which is licensed and supplied by [CONTACT_188833], Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003].  
 
Immu nogenic ity – Primary objectives:   
 
Immunoge nicity  against  rabies virus will  be assessed desc riptiv ely using the  following 
param eters:  
Timepoints:  Baseline, 28 days after initial dose of rabies vaccine and 7 days after a booster dose 
given at one year (372 days)   
 
 
• Numb er and percen tage of subjects with a titer  ≥ 0.5 IU/ml  against rabies virus.  
  
  
    
 
Statistical 
Methods: Calculation of Sam ple Size:  
 
  The planned sample size is 60 subjects, who will be randomly allocated ( 2:2:2:2:1:1) to four treatment 
groups  and two control groups  (i.e.  12 subjects in group s 1, 2, 3, and 4  and 6 subjects in groups 5 and 
6) The  sample size was chosen empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675], based on sample sizes of other exploratory studies of this 
general type.  The study is not powered to test non -inferiority or equivalency in immunogenicity 
among groups according to vaccination dosage and route of admin istration.

RABVAX Version 6.[ADDRESS_222917] rabies infection.  The goal of this study is to characterize the immune response and persistence of immunity  to a shortened dose schedule and intradermal (ID)  administration , 
relative  to the current licensed dosing schedule of the rabies vaccine (3 dose (0, 7, 21 days) IM).  
Rabies virus is endemic throughout the world due to high rates of both wild and domestic animal rabies  and the risk to deployed military in endemic areas is considerable. Currently the commonly 
supported pre-exposure prophylaxis regimen for rabies, in the [LOCATION_002] is comprised of three, 1.0 ml intramuscular (IM) injections of the human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV) or purified chick embryo cell (PCEC) rabies vaccine on days 0, 7, and 21 or 28.  Modified, two and three dose schedules of intradermal (ID) injections of 0.[ADDRESS_222918] associated with universal or even targeted coverage of deploying soldiers.  Evaluation of a shorter, smaller-dose, pre- exposure vaccinatio n 
series for rabies is the goal of this study.  
 
1.1 Backgro und of Rabies 
 
Rabies virus is a RNA virus, serotype 1 of 7 serotypes of the genus Lyssavirus, family Rhabdovirus (1). The lyssaviruses including rabies virus are found in a number of mammalian species and 
transmitted to humans as a zoonotic disease.  The primary animal vector varies geographically.  In   North America: skunks, raccoons, foxes, bats are the primary animal vector; Western Europe: foxes and bats; Eastern Euro pe: foxes and dogs; Latin America: dogs and bats; Caribbean: mongooses; 
Africa: dogs, jackals, mongooses, and foxes; Asia: dogs, cats, monkeys, mongooses, and arctic foxes.  The outer part of the virus protein contains the matrix protein and a glycoprotein on which are located the epi[INVESTIGATOR_188814], components of the current vaccine, and responsible for protection from infection.  Rabies is a global health problem with 55,000 deaths occurring every year ( 2).  It is highly endemic in most areas of the world (figure 1).  Considering 
that there is a highly effective pre and post-exposure prophylaxis regimen to rabies exposure, the global health problem is one of an access to care and effective rabies vaccines.

grown in and purified fromrabbit spi[INVESTIGATOR_188815].  T he rabies vaccine that is currently available  in the 
U.S. is derived from cell cultures, either a human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV)  or as a p urified 
chick embryo cell vaccine (PCECV)  (1).  Imovax Rabies (HDCV for pre or post-exposure) was 
developed by [CONTACT_188835] l icensed in 1980.  RabAvert (PCECV for pre or post -exposure) was 
developed by [CONTACT_64105] l icensed in  1997. Table [ADDRESS_222920]-exposure prophylaxis with the rabies vaccine.

RABVAX Version 6.[ADDRESS_222921]-exposure vaccination with rabies vaccines ( 1). 
 
The current rabies vaccines produce antibody response in 100% of individuals with durable 
immunity for years.  In a prospective study over 10 years of follow-up, an antibody titer of  130 IU 
following vaccination indicate d prolonged seropositivity with titers of 0.5 IU  or gre ater considered 
protective ( 3).  Pre -exposure vaccination is recommended for people who will be exposed to rabies 
virus either in the laboratory, environment or by [CONTACT_188836].  It is recommended for travelers or global health workers who may have potential exposure ( 1).  Reactions to the current rabies 
vaccines are mild with local pain, erythema, and swelling at the injection  site.  Systemic reactions 
are less frequent with headache and malaise ( 1).  Guillain -Barré syndrome has been reported as a 
rare event following vaccination but its association with vaccination is uncertain (1) .  Allergic 
reaction s were thought to result from the formation  of antibodies to the human albumin stabilizer 
that is chemi cally altered  by [CONTACT_57134]-propi[INVESTIGATOR_188811]. Systemic reactions to n ewer vaccines with 
significantly lower concentrations of human albumin are rare ( 11).  The current licensed delivery of 
the rabies vaccine is by [CONTACT_43015]. Due to the high cost of cell cultured  vaccines strategies have 
been investigated to reduce the number of vaccine doses at an equivalent immune response by [CONTACT_188837] ( 4). Intradermal vaccination  is thought to produce a better immune response as 
compared to IM delivery due to the antigen processing of Langerhans’ cells of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196] .  The 
ID dose is one- fifth of a dose of an IM delivery.

1.4 Potential Risks to Subjects  
 
Subjects Injected with Rabies Vaccine  
 
Reactions to the current rabies vaccines as previously noted are mild with local pain, erythema, and 
swelling at the injection site.  Systemic reactions are less frequent and include headache and malaise 
(1).

Potential risks m ay also include the unwanted effects  of blood sampling, which  may include 
tenderness  or bruising at the spot where  blood was drawn. Fainting or dizziness can occur after a 
blood draw, but this is uncommon. 
 
 
1.5 Rationale  
 
Antibody Assays:  The rabies virus envelope glycoprotein G is the correlate for protective 
immunity and by [CONTACT_78464] (WHO) guidelines, an antibody titer for protection should be greater than or equal to 0.5 IU/ml. Several studies have demonstrated the high sensitivity 
and specificity of the Bio -Rad, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), PLATELIA 
RABIES II® and correlation to the current reference method, rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test 
(RFFIT) ( 5, 6). The Bio- Rad Platelia Rabies II assay will be used to assess subjects’  immune 
response to rabies vaccine.  
Proteomics:  Proteomics is the analysis of the expression, localizations, functions, and interactions 
of a set of proteins expressed by [CONTACT_188838] a given set of environmental conditions.  This technique offers a novel met hod to evaluate clinical samples from 
experimental vaccination for identification of novel biomarkers and correlates of immunogenicity. 
For this protocol, the specific aim is to identify subtle changes in the immune response associated 
with rabies vaccinat ion given at various dosing intervals and both ID and IM. It is likely this 
analysis can better characterize the immune response in individuals whose titer drops below 0.5 IU/mL and help determine if they are still protected as indicated by [CONTACT_188839], robust return of high 
antibody titers with a single booster dose.  The iTRAQ (isobaric technique for relative and absolute 
quantitation) proteomic method allows the quantitative profiling of proteins from complex mixtures and is referred to as multi-dimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) (13-15) (7 -
9). 
Upstate Medical University P roteomics Core facility will be used to test samples and consists of an 
LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectromet er (16-18). The core proteomics facility employs both iTRAQ  
labeling and 2D DIGE methods of sample preparation for protein isolation and identification. Ettan Spot Pi[INVESTIGATOR_188817], Decyder 2D differential analysis software and Typhoon 9410 variable mode imager are available for the 2D DIGE samples. For this proposal, iTRAQ labeling will be conducted according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Applied Biosystems). Initially, samples will undergo 
immunodepletion, using eluting columns to remove high abundance proteins that may overwhelm 
unique peptide signatures.  Briefly, 100 µg of protein in 20 µl is denatured and reduced with denaturant (1µl) and reducing agent (2 µl) supplied with the kit. The samples are incubated for 1 hour at 60
o C and cysteine blocking agent is added (1µl) followed by [CONTACT_188840] 
10 min. The samples are digested with trypsin at 37o C overnight and then processed by [CONTACT_188841]. The samples are mixed and incubated another hour at room temp. The separation and mass spectral analysis will be conducted as described (19). The labeled 4 samples are pooled together, diluted 1:10 with a cation exchange buffer A and are fractionated by [CONTACT_188842]. The 
sample is loaded in buffer A and eluted with a gradient of 0-350 mM KCl over 40 min at 0.2 
ml/min. Twenty fractions are collected and then des alted with a C18 zip tip prior to LC -MS/MS. 
Samples will be processed with a Orbitrap XL FT LC -MS-MS system. The fractions are

Page 31 of 69 individually injected by [CONTACT_188843] a 5 µm C18 reverse phase column. The samples are 
eluted using a buffered gradient for 5 min. Nanospray data for MS and MS/MS are analyzed with ProQuant software as described (19) (10).  
Cell Mediated Immunity (CMI)  
We propose to monitor both the quality and quantity of immune activation immediately after 
vaccination as well the quality and quantity of the subsequently generated adaptive immunity in response to booster immunization with the RABVAX vaccine. Blood will be obtained for evaluation 
of cell -mediated immune responses to vaccination. At each time point blood will be collected in CPT 
tubes and PBMCs will be separated. The PBMCs will be stored fr ozen at -130C ° or below until 
analyzed at SUNY Upstate Medical University or shipped to WRAIR for analysis. CMI assays will include ELISPOT assays and flow cytometry intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). Cryopreserved PBMC will be tested in batched format to determine the presence and frequency of vaccine responders and the magnitude of the immune response using IFN-g spot- forming units as a read -out. 
Assays for T cell function will test at a minimum for IFN -γ production, however additional analysis 
for production of other cytokines such as TNF- α and IL -2, as well as the generation of short and long 
term effector and memory T cell populations can be performed in an identical manner  using 
multiparameter flow cytometry . Flow cytom etry will be used to comprehensively assess cellular 
activation and maturation in all lymphoid and myeloid cell lineages in PBMC, determine the 
functional profile of antigen- specific cells, and directly phenotype the antigen -specific cell s.

to evaluate the immune response to rabies vaccination . Additional biological samples (e.g. body 
fluids, tissue samples) may be collected in the event of an SAE.         .  
 
5.[ADDRESS_222927] a schedule of study procedures. These study 
procedures are describ ed for each  group separately  below. Although the schedule of visits  is 
different  for each  study group, the basic types  of visit are the same and the same procedures will 
be followed. 
 
VAC : vaccination  visit at which  the rabies vaccine is administered.  
 
BL: blood sample visit at which  a blood sample is obtained. These  BL visits  will occur  at 
designated  days or months after the previous admi nistration  of vaccine.  If vaccinati on occurs  on 
the same day, the blood sample will be obtained  before  vaccination. 
All screening assessm e nts must be completed within 60days prior to  vaccination.  
Screening numbers will be assigned when the subject  signs the consent document starting with 
screening #100, 101, 102, etc.  When the subject  has completed the screening visit and is eligible 
and willing to continue participation, they will be randomized according to the randomization 
process outlined in section 11.   Screen -fails will not be recorded in the data management system 
for the study. During the screening period, the following procedures and assessments will be carried out for each subject to det ermine their eligibility for participation in the study.  
• Obtain informed consent 
• Obtain medical history  
• Record concomitant medications  
• Record demographics  
• Complete physical examination  
• Review of inclusion and exclusion criteria  
• Vital signs  
• Urine pregnancy test (females of child bearing potential)  
 
On Day 0, when the subject  arrives for his /her first vaccination, the following events will occur 
before randomization:  
1) Review informed consent 
2) Review  inclusion and exclusion criteria  to confirm eligibility.  
3) Review pertinent  medical  history Section 6.[ADDRESS_222928] and  any changes in medical 
history since screening.   
4) Conduct a directed physical  examination, as required Section 6.6, m easure the subject’s

and ongoing. This assessment  will include a physi cal exam ination  that will include,  but not  be 
limited to, the following body syste ms: neurological, heart,  head, respi [INVESTIGATOR_696],  and abdom en. Any 
pre-existing  conditions and illnesses  will be docu mented  in the source docu ment.  Medical records 
will not be reviewed.  Significant m edical  history (reported  as diagnosis) including conditions for 
which  the subject  is or has been followed by a physician  or conditions that could resume during 
the course of the  study or lead to an SAE or to a repetitive  outpatient care will be collected  in the 
electronic case report form (eCRF).  
 
Dates , medications , and body systems will be record ed; the information collected will not be coded.  
 
For each  condition, the data co llected  will be limited  to: 
 
• Diagnosis with dates  (this is preferable to reporting signs and symptoms) 
 
• Presence  or absence of the  condition at enrollm ent 
 
Vitals  signs will include temperature, blood press ure, and pulse taken  while  the subject  is in a 
resting  position. 
 
At subsequent visits,  a history-driven  physical  exam ination  will inclu de, but not be limited  to, the 
following body syste ms: neurological, heart,  head,  respi[INVESTIGATOR_696],  and abdomen. The necessity  of this 
physical  exam ination  is deter mined through  conver sation  between  the study staff and the subject 
about the subject’s  current  medical  status.

Vaccine:  RabAvert® (Rabies Vaccine) produced by [CONTACT_188856] a sterile freeze-dried vaccine obtained by [CONTACT_188828]- virus strain Flury LEP in primary 
cultures of chicken fibroblasts.  The strain Flury LEP was obtained from American Type Culture 
Collection as the 59th egg passage.  The growth medium for propagation of the virus is a synthetic cell culture medium with the addition of human albumin, polygeline (processed bovine gelatin) and antibiotics.    The virus is inactivated with β -propi[INVESTIGATOR_188811], and further processed by 
[CONTACT_188857]-gradient.  The vaccine is lyophilized after addition of a stabilizer solution that consists of buffered polygeline and potassium glutamate.    One dose of reconstituted vaccine con tains less than 12 mg polygeline (processed bovine gelatin), less than 
0.[ADDRESS_222997]; ovalbumin content is less than 3 ng/dose (1 mL), based on ELISA.  In the final vaccine, neomycin is present at < 1 μg, chlortetracycli ne at < 20 ng, and 
amphotericin B at < 2 ng per dose.   RabAvert® is intended for intramuscular (IM) injection.  The vaccine contains no preservative and should be used immediately after reconstitution with the supplied Sterile Diluent for RabAvert® (Water for Injection).    The potency of the final product is determined by [CONTACT_188830] (NIH) mouse potency test using the US reference standard.  The potency of one dose (1.0 mL) RabAvert® is at least 2.5 IU of rabies antigen.   RabAvert ® is a white, freeze-dried vaccine for reconstitution with the water for 
injection diluent prior to use; the reconstituted vaccine is a clear to slightly opaque, colorless solution.

ensure their safety.  Any AE that  occurs during this period will be noted on the source 
docum ent and identified  as an  immediate  event  / reaction;  and will additionally be recor ded in 
the eCRF . 
 
 
  
[ADDRESS_223008] document all SAEs regardless  of causal  relationship, and notify the 
Sponsor within the notif ication timelines  stated in the following sections. The Investigator 
will give access  and provide the Sponsor and the local  clinical research associate ( CRA) with  
all necessary  information  to allow  the Sponsor to conduct a detailed  analysis  of the safety  of 
the investigational product. It is the responsibility of the Inv estigator  to request  all 
necessary docu mentation  (e.g.,  medical  records,  discharge  summary,  autopsy) in order  to 
provide comprehensive safety  information. All relevant  inform ation  must then be 
transcribed  into the SAE fo rm.   
 
  Timelines and process for SAE reporting    
Initial reports of SAEs should be sent by [CONTACT_188863] [INVESTIGATOR_874] 24 hours of the Investigator

according  to the local  regulatory requirem ents. Reporting to the health  authorities will 
be done according to the Sponsor’s SOPs. 
 
The Sponsor’s Responsible Medical Officer  will notify the Investi gators  in writing  of the 
occurrence of any  reportable SAEs. The  Investigators will be responsible for info rming 
the IRBs that  reviewed  the tr ial protocol of any  reportable SAEs.  
 
Per requirements of Department of Defense Instructions 3216.02, research funded with 
 
 Department of Defense funds requires a research monitor to be appointed.  [CONTACT_188881] will be the research monitor for this trial.  His duties will include reviewing and providing and unbiased assessment and written report of all: SAEs, Subject deaths, Unexpected AEs, Protocol deviations that are related to an adverse event impacting the subject, Annual reports and Unanticipated problems involving risks to subject and others 
involved in the trial.  The research monitor may observe recruitment and enr ollment 
procedures and the consent process for individuals, groups or units, review monitoring 
plans and data collection. 
The research monitor may discuss the research protocol with the investigators, interview 
human subjects, and consult with others outside of the study about the research.  He shall 
have authority to stop a research protocol in progress, remove individual human subjects from a research protocol, and take whatever steps are necessary to protect the safety and well-being of human subjects until the IRB can assess the monitor's report.  He shall have 
the responsibility to promptly report his observations and findings to the IRB or other designated official and the Human Research Protection Office.  
 
[ADDRESS_223012] information, and w ill attempt to clarify anything that  is incomplete or 
uncle ar. All clinic al trial inform ation  gathered by [CONTACT_188866] a web -based  eCRF.  The 
eCRF  has been  designed  specifical ly for this  trial using a validated  Electronic Records  / 
Electronic  Signature -compliant platform  (21CFR Part  11).   
Upon co mpletion  of training,  each user req uiring  access  to the EDC system  will be 
issued a unique username [CONTACT_2383]. In the  event of a change in trial personnel, each 
newly  assigned individual  will receive a unique username [CONTACT_2383]; the usern ame 
and password of a previous  user m ay not be reissued.   
The Investi gator is resp onsible for the timeliness, completeness,  and accuracy  of the 
information in  the eCRFs;  must provide explanations for all  missing  information; and 
must sign the eCRF using  an e-signature.  
 
 
19.2 Data Man agement  
 
Management of Clinical Data 
 
Data generated during the tr ial will be ma naged  following  two different processes:  
• Clinic al data, def ined as all  data reported  in the e CRF,  and laboratory data  will be 
entered in the database held at Frontier Science  in Amherst, NY . 
 
During the trial, clinic al data reported in the eCRFs will be integr ated into the clinic al 
 
 database under the responsibility  of Upstate.   Data  monitoring at the sites and quality 
control in the f orm of co mputeriz ed logic  and / or co nsiste ncy checks will b e 
syste matically  applied  in order to detect  errors  or omissions. Any questions pertaining 
to the reported clinical data will be subm itted to the Investig ator f or res olution  using 
the EDC syste m. Each  step of this process will  be monitored through the 
impleme ntation  of individual passwords to m aintain  appropriate database access  and to 
ensure database integrity.  
 
The validatio n of the immunog enicity data will be perfor med at the labora tory level 
followin g the laboratory’ s procedures . Inform ation from the laborator y will be checked 
for consistenc y bef ore integratio n into the clinica l database.  
 
After integratio n of all correction s in the complete set of data, the databas e will be released 
for statistica l analysis.  
 
19.[ADDRESS_223013] dosage schedules and routes of administration. No formal statistical hypothesis tests will 
be conducted.. Descriptive analyses for the primary endpoints will be based on per-protocol analysis data sets using the data from blood samples taken at baseline (0 days), 28 days, and 365 days after the initial dose and at 7 days after a booster at one year (372 days).. Separate descriptive analyses will be conducted for each per -protocol data set and group. 
 
Exploratory statistical analyses of final data may be conducted, if indicated by [CONTACT_188867]. Parametric, non- parametric and resampling (bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_007])  methods for 
statistical inference may be used in exploratory analyses, based on data compliance with assumptions of methods.  P - values  ≤ 0.05 will be considered significant and p- values ≤ 
0.10 will be considered a trend. Confidence intervals will be constructed at α=0.05 and α=0.10.  When necessary, p-value corrections for multiple comparisons will be applied. 
 
A descriptive summary of adverse events that were reported throughout the trial will be 
produced. Descriptive and inferential analyses (if any) will be carried out using SAS Version 
9.2 (or more recent versions), which is licensed and supplied by [CONTACT_188833], Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003].  
 
20.[ADDRESS_223014]  rabies  will be assessed  desc riptiv ely using the following 
 
 param eters:  
Timepoints:  At baseline, 28 days and 372 days.  
 
 • Number and percenta ge of subjects with a titer  ≥ 0.5 IU/ml  against rabies virus by 
[CONTACT_188868] 28 and 372. 
 
 
The descriptive statistics listed above will be calculated for each of the six groups for each 
blood draw.  Descriptive results will be reported in tabular and graphic formats.  A separate document, the statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed pri or to data analysis.  It will 
provide more detailed information about the specific descriptive statistics to be used and the format (tables, listings and figures) by [CONTACT_188869].  
 
 
20.2 Stati stical Methods f or Secondary Immuno genicity Objectives  
 Immunoge nicity  will be assessed  desc riptiv ely using the following param eters:  
 Timepoints:  Day 28 and day 365.  
 
The descriptive statistics listed above will be calculated for each of the six groups for the time points  stated above.  Specification of statistics and reporting formats will be provided in 
the SAP, as described above.  
 
20.3 Per-Protocol Analysis Set  
 
The Per-Protocol (PP) a nalysis  set will inclu de all subje cts who had no protocol 
deviations at the time that the data was collected. Three PP analysis sets will be 
produced for the primary objective that will contain separate data from blood 
drawn on day 0, day 28 and day 372, respectively. Descriptive analysis of the secondary endpoint will require a fourth per protocol analysis set for blood drawn on day 365.  Subjects will be excluded  from  the PPAS for the  following reasons: 
  1)  Subject  did not m eet all protocol- specified inclusion/exclusion criteria 
or   defi nitive contraindications (only for the second and third  
vaccinatio n). 
 
  2)  Subject  did not receive the correct  number of injectio ns.   
  3)  Ad ministration  of vacci ne was not done as per  protocol (site and route of 
administration) . 
 
   4)  Subject  did not receive vaccine in the proper time window defined in the tables  
of the         study procedures . 
 
 5)  Subject  did not provide a post-dose serology sample  in the proper time window 
defined  in  
         the tables  of the  study procedures . 
 
  
Subjects  will remain in this population as long as they do not m eet one of the  above criteria,  
except  for blood sampling  timing and validity of the serology  test result*. A PP set  will be 
defined for each  injection.  
 
*Note : For exa mple, a subject  whose time period  is outside the defined visit window 
only between  the first injecti on and the blood sample taken  after the first injection  will 
be excluded from PP1 but m ay be kept in PP2 or PP3.  
 
Subjects  will be analyzed  by [CONTACT_188870], subject to 
the exclusion criteria above 
 
  20.4  Full Analysis Set  
 
The full analysis  set (FAS) is  defined  as the subjects who received  at least one injection  of 
Rabies vaccine and had at least one blood sa mple drawn and valid  post- injection  serology 
result (i.e.  a result  different  from  “NR” or missing).  
 
Subjects  will be analyzed  by [CONTACT_188871].  
 
20.5 Populations Used in Analyses  
 
The immunogenicity analysis  will be perform ed on the PP.  The  kinetic  analysis  will be 
performed       on the FAS.  
 
 
 
21 Handling of Missing Data  and Outliers  
 
 
21.1 Immunogenicity  
 
For the computation of GMTs, a titer  reported  as < LLOQ w ill be converted  to a value of 
0.5 LLOQ.  
 
For calculating  fold-rise and titer ratio (GMTR), <  LLOQ wi ll be converted to 0.5 
LLOQ for a nu merator  and < LLOQ will  be converted  to LLOQ f or a denominator 
 
Any titer reported as > U LOQ (upper limit of quantizatio n) will be converted to 
ULOQ.  
 Missing data will not be imputed.  
 Potential outliers will be identified using histograms and modified box plots or normal probability plots, when appropriate.  Choice of subsequent tests for outliers (e.g. Grubbs, Tietjen -Moore and ESD) will depend on the number and nature of suspected outliers and 
may require data transformation.  Bootstrapped estimates of standard errors may also be 
reported. Sensitivity analysis of effect of outliers on descriptive statistics will be conducted, and if necessary descriptive statistics that include and exclude outliers will be reported.  
 
 22 Determination of Sample Siz e and Power Calcul ation  
 
  
The planned sample size is 60 subjects, who will be randomly allocated (2:2:2:2:1:1) to six  
treatment groups.  The sample size was chosen empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675], based on sample sizes of other 
exploratory studies of this general type.  This exploratory study is not powered to formally test equivalency or non-inferiority in immunogenicity among groups according to vaccinatio n dosage and route of administration.

Subjects will be considered as “relapsed” and withdrawn fro m the study  if the following cri teria 
are met: MADRS 22, or lack of efficacy as determined by [CONTACT_3170]. In addit ion, 
investigator judgment should be used to determine unsatisfactory  treatm ent response indicat ive 
of relapse to depression, such as subject hospi [INVESTIGATOR_490564], m edicat ion prescribed for 
MDD, electroconvulsive therapy , suicide attem pt, etc.
A safet y follow-up phone call will be made 30 days after completion of double -blind treatm ent.

5.0 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE
Assuming a cumulat ive relapse rate at 28 weeks of 15% for the vortioxetine group versus 30% 
for the pl acebo group, a total  of 600 subjects ( 150 per treatment group) will provide 85% power 
to find a statist ically significant difference between each dose of vortioxetine and placebo at a 
5% significance level (ie, alpha=0.05) .The total number of relapse events required in the 
placebo and three vortioxetine groups i s about 110.
It is ant icipated that approximately 55% of the patients enro lled into the open -label peri od will  
qualify  for the double -blind study  phase. Therefore, a total of about [ADDRESS_630744] ment will be considered. After approximately  75% of  planned 
subjects (825) are enrolled into the open -label period of the study , the total  number of relapse 
events, the numbers o f subjects who have completed or are still in the double -blind treatment 
period, and the numbers of subjects in the open -label phase will  be used to predi ct the final total 
number of relapse events. If the predicted total number of relapse events is far smaller than 110, 
with the pl anned [ADDRESS_630745] imated 1100.

6.0 METHODS OF ANALYSIS AND PRESENTATION
6.1 General Considerations
6.1.1 Statistical Software
Statistical analysis will be performed using the SAS System®, Versi on 9. 4 or greater , on a 
Windows platform.
6.1.2 Summary Statistics and Precision
All tabulat ions of analysis results will include summarie s for the foll owing treatm ent groups: 
placebo, vortioxetine5mg QD, vortioxetine10mg QD, and vortioxetine [ADDRESS_630746] ical tests, and resulting p -values will be reported as nominal 
2-sided and will be assessed at the 5% si gnificance level. No adjust ments will be made for 
multiplicit y aside from those for the primary  effica cy analyses (seesection 6.9.5 ).
For continuous variables, desc riptive stati stics will include the number of subjects (n), mean, SD 
or standard error (SE), as appropriate, minimum, median, and maximum . The number of decimal 
places displayed for each statist ic will be determined as fo llows:
Mean and median: 1 more than the number of decimal places allotted in the electronic case 
report form (eCRF) except for the CGI scales, where 2 decimal places will be reported.
SD and SE: 2 more than the number of decimal places allotted in the eCRF.
Minimum and maximum: equal to the number of decimal places allotted in the eCRF.
Confidence intervals will be presented using the same number of decimal places as the 
param eters (eg, m ean).
For categorical data, frequency counts and percentages will be presented. Percentages will be 
repor ted to [ADDRESS_630747] study  drug dose in the open label period or

6.6 Medical History and Concurrent Medical Conditions
Medical history  refers to the si gnificant condi tions/di seases that stopped at o r prior to Screening 
(time of informed consent). Concurrent medical condit ions are those significant ongoing 
condi tions/diseases present at Screening (time of informed consent).
For parti ally missing end dates, the following will be conducted:
Day missing: the minimum between last day  of the m onth and date of transfer will be used to 
impute the end date.
Month and day  missing: the minimum between last day  of the y ear and date of transfer will 
be used to impute the end date.
Medical history  and concurrent me dical  condi tions will be coded using the Medical Dict ionary 
for Regul atory  Activit ies (MedDRA) version 18.0 or hi gher and will be summarized by  
[CONTACT_490575] (SOC) and preferred term (PT). The table 
will include numbe r and percentages of subjects . SOC will be sorted i n alphabet ical order and 
the PT will be sorted in decreasing frequency  based on the total number of subjects . A subject 
will only be counted once within a part icular cl ass even if he/she has mult iple 
condi tions/symptoms. Summaries will be based on all enrolled subjects in open -label period and 
allrandomized subjects in double -blind period .Concurrent medical condit ions in the double -
blind period include significant ongoing condit ions or di seases present at the time of informed 
consent.
All medical history  and concurrent medical condit ion data will be listed by [CONTACT_3148], study  
center and subject number. The list ing will contain subject identifier, whether there was any

6.7 Medication History and Concomitant Medications
The m edicati on history  and conco mitant medicat ions are defined as fo llows:
Medicat ion history refers to the m edicat ion that the study  subjects stopped taking within 
90days prior to signing of informed consent .
Concomitant medicat ion is defined as medicat ion that the study  subjects conti nued taking or 
took fro m Screening through end of study :
–Conc omitant m edicat ion that started and stopped prior to baseline I (ie, stop date ≥ first 
screening visit date, and stop date ≤ first dose date).
–Concomitant medicat ion that started prior to Baseline I and was ongo ing in the open -

6.8 Study Drug Exposure and Compliance
The summary of study  drug exposure and com pliance will be based on the safet y set. Duration of 
exposure to study  medicati on is defined as (date of last dose –date of first dose +1 ). Since study  
medicat ion for the same subject in the open -label and double -blind periods may be different, the 
summary will be provided separately. Date of last dose is defined as the last dose in the treatment 
period.
Treatment duration will be summarized by [CONTACT_490577] (open -label period: 1 to 13 
days, 14 to 27 days, 28 to 41 days, 42 to 55 days, 56 to 69 day s, 70 to 83 days, 84 to 97 day s, 98

to 83 days, 84 to 111 days, 112 to 195 day s, and ≥196days) and the number of subjects in the 
doubl e-blind durat ion category  by [CONTACT_3227]. Treatment duration (weeks) will also be 
summarized using descript ive statist ics (n, m ean, SD, m edian, minimum, and maximum).
Percent of study  drug com pliance is defined as {(number of capsules dispensed –number of 
capsules returned)/(date of last dose –date of first dose +1)}x100%. If a value for the number of 
returned capsules is missing or the return date is missing, then 100% compliance will be assigned 
for each day up to the number of capsules dispensed or up to the date of return whichever is 
earlier.
For each treatment group, study  medicat ion compliance will be summarized by [CONTACT_345664]  (<80%, 80 to 120%, and ≥120%) and the number of subjects in each compliance 
category . Study  medicati on com pliance will  also be summarized as a continuous variable using

Relapse is defined as either:
a MADRS total score of 22 or more or
lack of efficacy  as determined by  [CONTACT_3170]
other unsat isfactory  treatm ent response j udged by [CONTACT_3170] .
The ‘Time to Relapse’ is in general defined as:
Date of Relapse –Date of Rando mizat ion (Vi sit 10) + [ADDRESS_630763] from study  visit discont inuat ion will be used. 
The time t o relapse will be analysed using two different convent ions:
Relapse Convention 1: Within 28 Weeks (primary):
This convent ion essent ially only considers data during the first 28 weeks of the 32- week double -
blind treatment, i.e., data up to week 44.
All wit hdrawals (relapses or other reasons) occurring after Visit 18/Week [ADDRESS_630764] will be used as censoring t ime.
The variables associated with these convent ions will be d efined as below,
Status_1: “0”indicat ing “Censoring”; “1” indicating “Relapse”
T_Rel apse_1: Time to Censoring or Relapse.
These variables will be the basis for the primary  analysis o f efficacy.
Relapse Convention 2: Complete double -blind period (Secondary):
All relapses occurring in the ent ire 32-week double -blind period will be considered. All 
withdrawals who did not relapse will be considered as non -relapse and will receive the date of 
study  drug wi thdrawal  as censoring time. If the date of study  drug wi thdrawal  is missing, the 
date of l ast contact [CONTACT_490578] t ime.
The variables associated with these convent ions will be defined as below,

6.9.2 Missing Items on Rating Scales
The general rule when individual items are missing fro m a multiple-item assessment i s as 
follows: the total  score will be calculated using a SAS funct ion CEIL, as CEIL[(sum o f 
nonmissing items)×(total number of items)/(number of nonmissing items)]. If more than 20% of 
the items are missing, the total score will be set to missing. The MADRS total score will be set to 
missing if the number of missing items is at least 3. The result ing calculated total scores will be 
used in all analyses.
6.9.[ADDRESS_630765] 28 weeks of the 32- week double -blind 
treatm ent will be the primary variable. Primary  analysis will com pare the efficacy  of vorti oxetine 
(5, 10, and 20 mg) versus placebo based on a Cox proporti onal hazards model using an exact 
method to handle ties, with treatm ent as the factor and baseline MADRS total score a s the 
covari ate of  the Cox m odel.
The SAS code for the time -to-relapse analysis will be as fo llows:
proc phreg;
–class treat;
–model T_Relapse_1*status_1(0) =treat baseline / ties=exact;
Here, baseline is the MADRS score at the double -blind baseline (Baseline II). The analysis will 
be supplemented with plots of Kaplan -Meier estimates of relapse. The tests will be [ADDRESS_630766] and

The primary  analyses (Cox m odel) will be also be repeated based on the PPS.
Some covari ates incl uding pool ed center, race, Baseline I and II MADRS scores, sex, baseline 
weight, BMI, and age with interaction terms may also be added to the Cox model of the primary  
efficacy  analysis for exploratory  analyses. 
For the primary  efficacy variable , subgroup analyses by:
age ( ≤median, >median).
sex (female, male).
race ( white, non -white).
Baseline IIMADRS ( ≤ median, > m edian).
and other variables, if necessary , will be perform ed if each of the subgroups con tains at l east

subgroup. Addit ional exploratory  analyses examining subgroup effect and treatment by  [CONTACT_490579].
6.9.4 Analysis of Secondary Variables
Change from double -blind Baseline II in MADRS total score will be analyzed using a mixed 
effects model for repeated m easurements (MMRM) analysis wit h treatment, week, baseline 
MADRS total score, treatm ent-by-week interacti onas fixed effects, center as ran dom effect, and 
acompletely  unstructured covari ance matrix .Study  visits wi th at least 50% of the subjects have 
non
-missing values will be included. Com parisons between the different doses of vortioxetine 
and placebo will be performed over all the assessment poi nts. 
The SAS code for the MMRM analysis will be as follows:
Proc mixed data=all;
–class week treat center subject;
–model Change = treat center week baseline week*treat /solution;
–repeated week/subject=subject ty pe=UN;
–rando m center;

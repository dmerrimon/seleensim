STUDY DESIGN  This Phase 2/3, multicenter, repeat -dose, clinical trial will be divided into 
2 consecutive major periods: 1) a randomized placebo -controlled, double -blind 
primary analysis period (PAP) from Day -60 to Week 52 to be followed by 2) 
an extensio n treatment period (ETP). Initially, the ETP will be double -blind as 
patients in the placebo arm cross over to active treatment.  
The PAP will include a screening/baseline period and a treatment period. 
During the screening/baseline period, from Day -[ADDRESS_1105024] 
infusion is administered. The visit schedule is calculated using Day  1 of the 
dose escalation period as the reference. Treatment assignment and 
randomization will be performed using an Interactive Vo ice Response 
System/Interactive Web Response System. Patients will be randomly and 
centrally assigned across sites and using blocks of fixed size to placebo 
(saline, 0.9% sodium chloride solution) or 3.0 mg/kg olipudase alfa in 
a 1:1 ratio.  
After completing the PAP, patients will enter the ETP and those who had been 
randomized to active arm will continue receiving the dose to which they were 
randomized during the PAP (or the highest tolerated dose [HTD], if the 
randomized dose was intolerable). Pat ients randomized to the placebo arm in 
the PAP will cross over to active treatment in the ETP and will undergo dose 
escalation to a target dose of 3.0 mg/kg of olipudase alfa. To maintain the 
double -blind, all patients will dose -escalate using the schedule  provided (ie, 
true dose escalation for patients who were in the placebo arm during the PAP 
and mock dose escalation for patients who were in the active arm during the 
PAP).  
Study drug will be defined during the PAP as olipudase alfa or placebo and 
during the ETP as olipudase alfa and will be administered intravenously once 
every 2 weeks. Dose escalation during the PAP and ETP will occur according 
to the following schedule: (True dose -escalation for patients in the active arm 
during the PAP or the placebo a rm during the ETP; mock dose -escalation for 
patients in the active arm during the ETP or placebo arm during the PAP).

Note: a Schedule does not account for rechallenge.  
Study drug includes olipudase alfa and placebo  
During the PAP, one rechallenge each will be allowed for doses administered 
at Week 0 (0.1 mg/kg or placebo) and at Week 4 (0.3 mg/kg or placebo). 
Patients who are unable to tolerate the rechallenge at those doses will be 
discontinued fro m the study. If a patient is discontinued due to inability to 
tolerate rechallenge (ie, a second dose of 0.3 mg/kg olipudase alfa), then an 
additional patient may be randomized. Any patient who successfully dose -
escalates through Week 4, but cannot tolerat e study drug infusions at later 
weeks, will continue in the trial at the Week 4 dose (ie,  0.3 mg/kg olipudase 
alfa or placebo) until the end of treatment; likewise, any patient unable to 
tolerate a dose administered during later weeks will receive the HTD even if 
that dose is less than the target randomized dose and will continue in the ETP 
at this dose. The minimum active dose administered will be 0.3 mg/kg 
olipudase alfa.  
The same dose -escalation schedule and conditions will apply for patients who 
cross o ver from the placebo arm during the PAP to the active arm in the ETP, 
except that patients unable to tolerate the one rechallenge each allowed for 
doses administered at Week 54 (0.1 mg/kg olipudase alfa) and Week 58 
(0.3 mg/kg olipudase alfa) will disconti nue from the study and will not be 
replaced.  
During the PAP and ETP, in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_800534] 24 hours after the end of infusion during dose escalation

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 Sample size determination  
The sample size calculations are based on the 2 primary efficacy endpoints of 
percentage change from baseline in spleen volume (expressed in MN) at 
Week  52 and the percentage change from baseline in DL CO (expressed as % 
predicted of normal) at Week 52. The assumptions for the spleen volume 
endpoint are the following:  
• An 11.8% common standard deviation based on data from previous 
ASMD and Gaucher disease type 1 studies  
• A 30% mean difference from baseline t o Week 52 between 
3.0 mg/kg olipudase alfa and placebo in percentage change in 
spleen volume MN  
• An expected exclusion rate from the modified intent -to-treat (mITT) 
population of 11%  
Based on the above assumptions, a comparison between 3.0  mg/kg olipudase

significance level with 36 patients randomized 1:1 to placebo or 3.0 mg/kg 
olipudase alfa. At a 2.5% significance level, the power would still be over 95%.  
The following assumptions  for the DL CO endpoint are based on results 
obtained from the olipudase alfa Phase 1b study DFI13412:  
• A 20% common standard deviation  
• A 25% mean difference from baseline to Week 52 between 
3.0 mg/kg olipudase alfa and placebo in percentage change in 
DLCO ( in % predicted)  
• An expected exclusion rate from the mITT population of 11%  
Based on these assumptions, a comparison between the 3.0  mg/kg treatment 
arm and the placebo arm will have 93% power using a t -test at a  2-sided 5.0% 
significance level and with 36 patients randomized 1:1 to placebo or 3.0 
mg/kg.  
The assumptions for the splenomegaly -related score endpoint came from the 
[COMPANY_011] -sponsored clinical trial in myelofibrosis (JAKARTA, NCT#  01437787). 
The assumptions for the power calculations are:  
• A common s tandard deviation of 9.4  
• A mean difference of 8.0 from baseline to Week 52 between 
3.0 mg/kg of olipudase alfa and placebo in the SRS  
• An expected exclusion rate from the mITT population of 11%  
Based on the above assumptions, a comparison between 3.0 mg/kg of 
olipudase alfa and placebo will have 82% power using a t -test to detect 
a statistical trend, defined as 2 -sided p -value ≤0.15, with 36 patients 
randomized 1:1 to placebo and 3.0 mg/kg of olipudase alfa.  
For the US protocol, in which a combination spleen  endpoint is used, using the 
simplifying assumption that the 2 components of the combination spleen 
endpoint (spleen volume and SRS) are independent, the likelihood that 
statistical significance (spleen volume significance based on Hochberg 
procedure and S RS p -value ≤0.15) will be declared for the combination spleen 
endpoint is greater than 80%.  
Analysis populations  
The randomized population  will include any patient who had been allocated 
to a randomized treatment arm regardless if study drug was administer ed. 
The safety population  is a subset of the randomized population and will 
include randomized patients who received at least 1 infusion (partial or total). 
This is the primary population for the safety analysis.  
The mITT population  is the same as the safety population, and is used as the 
primary population for the efficacy analysis.  
The per protocol population  will be a subset of the mITT population who 
have no major protocol deviations that are expected to interfere with 
assessment s of the [ADDRESS_1105030] of patients who completed 
the PAP and who continue into the extension treatment period.  
The pharmacokinetic  (PK) population  will consist of mITT patients who have 
evaluable drug concentration data.  
The pharmacodynamic  (PD) population  will consist of mITT patients who 
have at least [ADDRESS_1105031] rescue therapy

 Analysis of efficacy  
The 2 primary efficacy endpoints (percentage ch ange in spleen volume in MN 
from baseline to 52 weeks and percentage change in DL CO in % predicted 
from baseline to 52 weeks) will be analyzed in the mITT population using the 
mixed model for repeated measures. The secondary efficacy endpoints will 
also be  analyzed using this method. In the [LOCATION_002], spleen volume is 
combined with change in SRS from baseline to Week  52 and is referred to as 
the “combination spleen endpoint”.  
The primary and secondary endpoints will be tested using a 2 -stage 
gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_800539] 5% familywise error rate. A Hochberg 
method will be used to test the 2 primary endpoints. For the US only, if spleen 
volume is significant, change in SRS from baseline to Week  52 will be tested 
at the 0.15% level. The secondary en dpoints will be tested in a  closed, 
hierarchical fashion.  
 
Analysis of safety  
Safety analyses may be performed using the safety population. Additional 
summaries will be conducted using the most recent dose the patient received 
before the event of interest.  
All AEs will be coded using the most recent version of the Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Adverse event (AE) incidence tables will 
present by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) (sorted by [CONTACT_56496]) 
and preferred term (PT)  and the number and percentage of patients 
experiencing an AE. Multiple occurrences of the same event in the same 
patient will be counted only once in the tables within a treatment period. The 
denominator for computation of percentages is the safety popula tion within 
each treatment arm.  
All treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs), all TEAEs potentially related to study 
drug, all TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation and/or study 
discontinuation, all TEAEs that are IARs, all treatment -emergent SAEs 
(including tr eatment -related SAEs), and all AEs with fatal outcome will be 
summarized. The TEAE observation period will be defined as the time from 
the first infusion of study drug through the end of study visit or [ADDRESS_1105032] infusion of study drug wh ichever one occurs later.  
Detailed listings of TEAEs, SAEs, AESIs, related TEAEs, and discontinuations 
due to TEAEs will be provided and include the randomized treatment arm and 
olipudase alfa dose of the infusion or placebo before or during the occurrence  
of the TEAE, when applicable.  
The number of TEAEs and annualized rate, and the number and proportion of 
patients reporting specific TEAEs will be tabulated for the overall analyses of 
TEAEs.  
The ECG data will be analyzed using the Bazett’s and Fridericia ’s QT 
correction methods. All ECG variables will be summarized for each 
randomization dose group/dose and time point. Change from baseline will also 
be calculated and summarized using descriptive statistics.  
 Pharmacokinetics  
Plasma concentration -time data will be analyzed using actual dosing and 
sampling times by [CONTACT_105] -compartmental methods. Pharmacokinetic parameters 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_15994], study week as appropriate, and in relation to 
immunogenicity. If data do not lend to non -compartmental a nalysis, or for

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential  Page 15 additional analyses, model based approaches such as nonlinear mixed effects 
modeling may be used.  
Pharmacodynamics  
Concentration -time data for sphingomyelin and metabolites will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics. Individual and sum mary statistics will 
be presented.  
All other pharmacodynamic parameters will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics. Change from baseline will be calculated and summarized. 
Exploratory correlation analyses will be attempted to evaluate relationships 
between different pharmacodynamic markers and between sphingomyelin 
and/or lyso -sphingomyelin levels from different sources.  
Lyso -sphingomyelin and ceramide represent most informative readouts for 
pharmacodynamic response to treatment. Only these 2 parameter s will be 
assessed after the cutoff date for a planned second database lock of the study 
for purpose of regulatory submissions in 2021.  
 
Pharmacokinetics -pharmacodynamics  
Exploratory PK -PD analyses may be performed to elucidate dose -response 
and concentrat ion response relationships with biomarkers of safety and/or 
efficacy. The PK -PD relationships may be explored graphically and if 
a relationship is apparent, PK -PD modeling may be attempted and results 
reported, as appropriate.  
Interim analysis  No interim analysis is planned during PAP . However, during ETP, a formal 
summary of data or interim CSRs may be produced to support regulatory 
approval(s) and/or other submission/application requirement(s).  
DURATION OF STUDY PERIOD (per 
patient)  The longest study d uration per patient will be for at least 3 years and up to 
5 years and 3 months dependent upon continued regulatory approval of this 
protocol:  
• Screening/baseline: up to 60 days  
• Primary analysis period: approximately 52 weeks  
• Extension treatment period: until study completion (up to 4 years)  
• End of study visit within [ADDRESS_1105033] treatment

a Study drug infusions will occur once every 2 weeks (±3 days) in reference to the date of the first inf usion (Day 1). Assessments will be performed at the indicated visits ±7 days, unless otherwise specified. Unless 
specified otherwise, study procedures should preferably occur before infusion and during approximately the same time of day f or each visit (in reference to the screening/baseline visit). When multiple 
assessments are required, the order will be vital signs before ECG before blood draw.  
b Adverse events will be captured from the time the patient provides signed informed consent through the safety follow -up period (30 to 37 days after the patient’s last study infusion).  
c The complete physical examination will include a neurological examination (mental status, cranial nerves, muscle strength, se nsation, deep -tendon reflexes, and coordination); examina tions of lymph nodes, heart, 
lungs, abdomen, and extremities/joints; and an assessment of the general appearance, skin, and HEENT (head, eyes, ears, nose,  and throat).  
d The abbreviated examination of general appearance only will be carried out before and af ter each study drug infusion.  
e Vital sign measurements will include blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and temperature. At quarterly visits, coll ection times will be prior to the infusion (within 30 ±10 minutes of infusion start); halfway 
through  (ie, when half the expected time for infusion duration has elapsed); at the end of infusion (±10 minutes); 2 hours ±10 minute s, 4 hours ±10 minutes, and 6  hours ±10 minutes after the end of the infusion; 
and every 8 hours ±1 hour until the patient has bee n discharged. Vitals signs should also be measured at discharge ±[ADDRESS_1105042] 24 hours afte r the end of infusion. The investigator may decide that longer monitoring is required. At all visits except 
quarterly visits and dose escalation visits, vital sign collection times will be prior to the infusion (within 30 minutes ±[ADDRESS_1105043] art); halfway through (ie, when half the expected time for infusion 
duration has elapsed); at the end of infusion ±10 minutes; and at discharge ±10 minutes ([ADDRESS_1105044] -infusion). At any visit the investigator may decide that longer monitoring is required.  
f A single ECG will be administered each before infusion and 4  hours  ±10 minutes, 12  hours  ±1 hour, and 24  hours  ±3 hours after the end of infusion. Electrocardiograms will be performed before the blood draw 
scheduled at the same time point.  
g Samples will be  taken for liver function testing and coagulation within 24 hours before and 24 hours ±3 hours and 48 hours ±3 hours after the end of infusion. Samples will be taken for urinalysis and clinical 
chemistry within 24 hours before infusion.  
h For hematology at q uarterly visits, except yearly visits, 1 sample for complete blood count with differential will be taken within 24 hours befo re infusion and one 24 ±[ADDRESS_1105045] for complete blood count with differential and the second for hemoglobin and white blo od cell and platelet counts only. In 
addition, at yearly visits, 1  sample for complete blood count with differential will be taken 24 ±3 hours after the end of infusion.  
i Urine β -HCG up to 24 hours before infusion, once every 4 weeks; if positive, repeat test with serum.

o Patients will fill out the eDiary during the evening of the 7 consecutive days before each quarterly visit (see Section  1.3). If the patient does not fill out the eDiary on the day before infusion, (ie, missing the Day  7 
entry), then the patient  will be allowed to make the day [ADDRESS_1105048] 24 hours after the end of  infusion during quarterly visits during PAP. Blood will be collected and safety assessments 
(including vital signs [footnote e]) will be performed. For all other visits, patients will be observed after the end of infu sion for at least 3 hours. Study drug infusions will occur once every 2 weeks ( ±3 days) in 
reference to the date of the first infusion (Day 1) for each patient.

a Study drug infusions will occur once every 2 weeks (±3 days) at the study site or at home (during the Covid -19 pandemic) if agreed between the investigator and the sponsor,  for eligible patients), in reference to 
the date of the first infusion (Day 1). Assessments will be performed at the indicated visits ± 7 days , unless otherwise specified. Unless specified otherwise, study procedures should preferably occur before infusion  
and during approximately the same time of day for each visit (in reference to the screening/baseline visit). Quarterly visits  will occur at the site. During the COVID -19 pandemic, if site visits are not possible and 
home infusion is already approved for t he eligible patient, quarterly visits will be done at home, quarterly visit assessments will not be done, and home infusion v isits will continue with biweekly assessments. In 
such a case, some of the quarterly visit assessments can be done by [CONTACT_800596] (eg, Health -related quality of life instruments ) and the rest of missed quarterly visit assessments will be done as 
unscheduled, as soon as site visits become available. When multiple assessments are required, the order will be vital signs be fore ECG before blood draw. Telehealth visits are an acceptable alternative to site 
visits  during the COVID -19 pandemic , in accordance with institutional policy and with applicable country -specific regulations . 
b Adverse events will be captured from the time  the patient provides signed informed consent through the safety follow -up period (30 to 37 days after the patient’s last study infusion).  
c The complete physical examination will include a neurological examination (mental status, cranial nerves, muscle stre ngth, sensation, deep -tendon reflexes, and coordination); examinations of lymph nodes, heart, 
lungs, abdomen, and extremities/joints; and an assessment of the general appearance, skin, and HEENT (head, eyes, ears, nose,  and throat).  
d The abbreviated examina tion of general appearance only will be carried out before and after each study drug infusion.  
e Weight at previous on -site quarterly visit or home visit (during COVID -19 pandemic, if ≥[ADDRESS_1105052] on -site quarterly visit) may be used to calcul ate drug dosage at current visit.  
f Vital sign measurements will include blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and temperature. At quarterly visits, coll ection times will be prior to the infusion (within 30 ±10 minutes of infusion start); halfway 
through (ie, when half the expected time for infusion duration has elapsed); at the end of infusion ( ±10 minutes); 2 hours ±10 minutes, 4 hours ±10 minutes, and 6 hours ±10 minutes after the end of infusion; and 
every 8 hours ±1 hour until the patient has been discharged. Vital signs should also be measured at discharge ±[ADDRESS_1105053] 24 hours. T he investigator may decide that longer monitoring is required. At all visits except quarterly visits and dose escalation visi ts, 
vital sign collection times will be prior to the infusion (within 30 minutes ±10 minutes of infusion start); halfway through (ie, when half the expected time for infusion duration has elapsed); at the end of infusion 
±10 minutes; and at discharge ±10 minutes ([ADDRESS_1105054] -infusion). At any visit the investigator may decide that longer monitoring is required.  
g Electrocardiograms will  be performed before any blood draws. Single ECGs will be performed before infusion and 4  hours  ±10 minutes, 12  hours  ±1 hour, and 24  hours  ±3 hours after the end of infusion.  
h Samples will be taken for liver function testing and coagulation within 24 hours  before infusion and at 24 hours ±3 hours and 48 hours ±[ADDRESS_1105055] for complete bloo d count with differential and the second for hemoglobin and white blood cell and platelet counts only. In 
addition, at yearly visits, 1 sample for complete blood count with differential will be taken 24 hours ±3 hours after the end  of infusion. For the swi tch from Process C( ) IMP to the updated manufacturing process

k For the switch from Process C( ) IMP to the updated manufacturing Process C( ) IMP, collection will be monthly for the firs t 6 months after starting the new u pdate, and quarterly after that.  
l Sample will be taken within 24 hours before infusion and 24 hours ±3 hours and 48 hours ±3 hours after the end of infusion for metabolites in plasma and biomarkers including but not limited to: hsCRP, iron, 
ceramide, ferrit in, cardiac troponin -I, calcitonin, and multiplex assay (Meso Scale) for other biomarkers indicative of inflammation and vascular damage.  
m Spleen and liver volumes will be measured from the abdominal MRI. Patients will be required to fast from solid foods ( liquids such as water or juice will be permitted) for ≥[ADDRESS_1105057] X -ray will be performed in selected sites.  
p Patients will fill out the eDiary during the evening of the 7 consecutive days before each quarterly visit (see Section  1.3). If the patient does not fill out the eDiary on the day before infusion, (ie, missing the Day  7 
entry), then the patient will be allowed to make the day 7  eDiary entry in the clinic before study drug infusion.

date of the first i nfusion (Day 1). For the switch from Process C( ) IMP to the updated manufacturing process C( ) IMP, if the site visit is n ot possible during a regional or national emergency declared by a 
governmental agency such as the COVID -19 pandemic (refer to Appendix B  for [LOCATION_013]) due to site closure or extenuating circumstances that prevent an in -person site visit, to permit the first infusion of the 
Process C( ) IMP to be at  home for eligible patients in agreement between the Sponsor and the Investigator in compliance with appli cable country -specific regulations.  
Assessments will be performed at the indicated visits ±7 days, unless otherwise specified. Unless specified otherwise, study procedures should preferably occur before infusion and during approximately the same 
time of day for each visit (in reference to the screening/baseline visit). Quarterly visits will occur at the site. During th e COVID -19 pandemic, if site visits are not possible and home infusion is already approved for 
the eligible patient, quarterly visits will be done at home, quarterly visit assessments will not be done, and home infusion visit will continue with biweekly assessments. I n such a case, some of the quarterly visit 
assessments can be done by [CONTACT_282138] (eg, Health -related quality of life instruments). the rest of the missed quarterly visit assessments will be done as unscheduled, as soon  as site visits become  
available. When multiple assessments are required, the order will be vital signs before ECG before blood draw. Telehealth vis its are an acceptable alternative to site visits during the COVID -19 pandemic, in 
accordance with institutional policy and with ap plicable country -specific regulations. Patients who initiated home infusion during the COVID -19 pandemic, and continue to be on home infusion, may continue 
receiving home infusion by [CONTACT_800589] 2 weeks (±3 days) until the end of t he ETP (refer to  Appendix B  for [LOCATION_013])  and, i n such case , telehealth visits may continue until the end of the 
ETP (except quarterly visits as specified above).  
b The EOS visit will be completed within [ADDRESS_1105068] X -ray, pulmonary function tests, treadmill ergometry, and echocardiogram with Doppler will not be repeated if they had been 
done  within 3 months prior; DXA and bone MRI will not be repeated if they had been done within [ADDRESS_1105069] more 
limited assessments (see detail in Section  10.1). 
c Adverse events will be captured from the time the patient provides signed informed consent through the safety follow -up period (30 to 37 days after the  patient’s last study infusion).  
d The complete physical examination will include a neurological examination (mental status, cranial nerves, muscle strength, se nsation, deep -tendon reflexes, and coordination); examinations of lymph nodes, heart, 
lungs, abdom en, and extremities/joints; and an assessment of the general appearance, skin, and HEENT (head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat) . 
e The abbreviated examination of general appearance only will be carried out before and after each study drug infusion.  
f Weight at p revious on -site or home visit (during COVID -19 pandemic, if ≥[ADDRESS_1105070] on -site quarterly visit) may be used to calculate drug dosage at current visit.  
g Vital sign measurements will include blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and t emperature. At quarterly visits, collection times will be prior to the infusion (within 30 ±10 minutes of infusion start); halfway 
through (ie, when half the expected time for infusion duration has elapsed); at the end of infusion ( ±10 minutes); 2 hours ±10 minutes, 4 hours ±10 minutes, and 6 hours ±10 minutes after the end of the infusion; 
and every 8 hours ±1 hour until the patient has been discharged. Vital signs should also be measured at discharge ±[ADDRESS_1105071] 24 hours. The investigator may decide that  longer monitoring is required. At all visits except quarterly visits and dose escalation 
visits, vi tal sign collection times will be prior to the infusion (within 30 minutes ±10 minutes of infusion start); halfway through (i e, when half the expected time for infusion duration has elapsed); at the end of 
infusion ±10 minutes; and at discharge ±10 minutes  ([ADDRESS_1105072] -infusion). At any visit the investigator may decide that longer monitoring is required.  
h Electrocardiograms will be performed before any blood draws. Single ECGs will be performed before infusion and 4  hours  ±10 minutes, 12  hours  ±1 hour, and 24 hours  ±3 hours after the end of infusion.  
i Samples will be taken for liver function testing and coagulation within 24 hours before infusion and 24 hours ±3 hours after the end of infusion. Samples will be taken for urinalysis and clinical chemistry withi n 24 
hours before infusion.  
j For hematology at quarterly visits except yearly visits, 1 sample for complete blood count with differential will be taken wi thin 24 hours before infusion and one 24 hours ±[ADDRESS_1105073] for complete blood count with diff erential and the second for hemoglobin and white blood cell and platelet counts 
only. In addition, at yearly visits, 1 sample for c omplete blood count with differential will be taken 24 hours ±3 hours after the end of infusion. For the switch from Process C( ) IMP to the updated manufacturing

m For the switch from Process C(  IMP to the updated manufacturing Process C( ) IMP, collection will be monthly for the firs t 6 months after starting the new update, and quarterly after that.  
n Sample will be taken within 24 hours before infusion and 24 hours ±3 hours after the end of infusion for biomarkers including but not limited to h sCRP, iron, ferritin, cardiac troponin -I, calcitonin, and multiplex pro -

Human acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD ) is a serious, rare, and life -threatening 
lysosomal storage disorder for which only palliative treatment exists. Patients with ASMD are 
unable to metaboliz e sphingomyelin properly due to mutations in the gene sphingomyelin 
phosphodiesterase 1, acid lysosomal (SMPD1 ), whose transcription and translation results in 
a defective  enzyme acid sphingomyelinase (ASM ). Inactivity of ASM leads to the lysosomal 
accumulation of sphingomyelin and, secondarily, increases in cholesterol and other related lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], 
mostly in the spleen, li ver, lung, and bone marrow.  
Historically, ASMD has been diagnosed as Niemann -Pi[INVESTIGATOR_206336] (NPD ) and of either Types  A or 
B disease. Niemann -Pi[INVESTIGATOR_206307] A is characterized as the early -onset and ac ute 
neuronopathic form of NPD and results in failure to thrive, hepatosplenomegaly, rapi[INVESTIGATOR_800549], and death usually before the age of 3 years ( 1). 
Niemann -Pi[INVESTIGATOR_206307] B (NPD B ) is a much milder disease with no or little neurological 
involvement. Of the more common disease manifestations are hepatosplenomegaly a nd 
dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]; other, more variable features include liver dysfunction, pulmonary disease, skeletal 
involvement, retinal stigmata, and growth retardation. Niemann -Pi[INVESTIGATOR_206307] B is usually 
diagnosed in childhood after organomegaly is observed, typic ally after the age of [ADDRESS_1105092] been classified 
that are intermediate to the A and B extremes. Patients with this intermediate form, Niemann -Pi[INVESTIGATOR_285429] A/B, may develop neurologic symptoms during childhood and have a chronic 
neurodegenerative disease course.  
Genzyme has been developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a potential enzyme therapy, olipudase alf a, for the treatment of the 
non-neurological manifestations of ASMD. This recombinantly -derived enzyme is expressed in 
Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) transfected with olipudase alfa complementary DNA that 
encodes a [ADDRESS_1105093] retains the enzymatic activity and 
lysosomal targeting of the native protein.  
Proof of concept for olipudase alfa enzyme replacement therapy has been demonstrated in the acid 
sphingomyelinase knock out (ASMKO ) mouse model of ASMD ( 2), which exhibits both systemic 
and neurological features of ASMD. Repeat intravenous (IV ) bolus administration of olipudase 
alfa to ASMKO mice led to dose -dependent reductions of sphingomyelin in visceral organs and in 
the lungs, to a lesser extent, but was unable to prevent neurologic decline and prolon g survival 
(3, 4). Although chronic dosing in the ASMKO mouse model is limited because the animal 
succumbs to the neurologic disease resulting from the natural progression of complete ASMD and 
subsequent shortened lifespan of approximately 6 to 8 months.  
Pharmacodynamic (PD ), pharmacokinetic (PK ), and toxicological studies conducted in the 
ASMKO mouse found significant reductions of sphingomyelin in the liver, lung, kidney, and 
spleen at olipudase alfa doses ranging from 0.1 to 5.0 mg/kg in a time -dependent manner; 
however, ASMKO mice given single high bolus doses of olipudase alfa (≥10 mg/kg) showed 
evidence of toxicity. The same single high doses did not cause toxic effects in nor mal mice,

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential  Page 58 Sprague Dawley rats, or cynomolgus monkeys, which suggested that catabolites of 
sphingomyelin, and not olipudase alfa itself, were the cause of the toxic effects. Subsequent 
“debulking” studies in ASMKO mice demonstrated that a slow reduction in the sphingomyelin 
load over time using multiple low doses of olipudase alfa (4 doses of 3.0 mg/kg olipudase alfa 
administered over 8  days) followed by a high dose (20  mg/kg of olipudase alfa 3 days later) 
prevented the toxicity associated with the single i nitial high doses. These findings suggest that the 
observed toxicity is related to the rate of substrate degradation and that step -wise removal of 
substrate likely mitigates toxicity. Furthermore, repeat, high doses of olipudase alfa (30 mg/kg 
every 2 week s for 7 doses) administered after a 7 -day debulking period (3 mg/kg on Days 1, 3, 5, 
and 7) did not cause toxicity.  
In a Phase 1 study (SPHINGO -[ZIP_CODE]), the safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic 
profiles of single, ascending doses of olipudase alfa w ere evaluated ( 5). Single doses of 0.03, 0.1, 
0.3, 0.6, and 1.0  mg/kg olipudase alfa were infused sequentially by [CONTACT_282141] 11 adult 
patients with ASMD. Study results found dose -related increases in ceramide, bilirubin, high 
sensitivity C -reactive protein (hsCRP ), and other acute phase reactants in patients that peaked 
24 to 48 hours after dosing and resolved by [CONTACT_4475] 14. Reported adverse events (AEs ) involving 
constitutional symptoms (pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting) were consistent with 
first dose-related toxicity and occurr ed in a dose dependent fashion, as was previously observed in 
the ASMKO mouse. Serious adverse events (SAEs ) related to olipudase alfa treatment were not 
reported. The study was terminated by [CONTACT_800597] 1.0  mg/kg 
olipudase alfa presented with hyperbilirubinemia and an acute phase reaction (APR ) with clinical 
symptoms. Subsequently, the patient was confirmed to hav e Gilbert’s syndrome. Because no other 
signs of liver toxicity or hemolysis were evident, the observed hyperbilirubinemia may have been 
secondary to specific inhibition of bilirubin uptake into hepatocytes and/or glucuronide 
conjugation of bilirubin within  hepatocytes.  
In the completed Phase 1b, open -label, multicenter, ascending dose study (DFI13412) in 5  adult 
patients with ASMD, the safety and tolerability of olipudase alfa was evaluated during a 26 -week 
treatment period ( 6). After receiving an initial intravenous dose of 0.1 mg/kg olipudase alfa, 
patients dose -escalated in a step -wise manner to a target intravenous dose of 3.0 mg/kg. All 
patients remained at the 3.0 mg/kg olipudase alfa dose for the remainder of the treatment period. 
Upon study completion, patients enrolled into an open -label, long term treatment study 
(LTS13632) ( 7). 
The progressive, within -patient olipudase alfa dose escalation regimen was well tolerated in adult 
patients with ASMD. No serious or severe AEs or deaths were reported in the study. Related AEs 
consi sted predominantly of infusion -associated reactions (IARs ), the majority of which were mild 
in severity with all patients recovering without sequelae. At the end of the 26 week treatment 
perio d, improvements were observed in several individual efficacy parameters and included mean 
decreases in spleen and liver volumes by 25.3% and 17.1%, respectively; decreased interstitial 
lung disease scores; increased percent predicted diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon 
monoxide (DL CO); reduction in serum chitotriosidase, chemokine (C -C motif) ligand 18 (CCL18 ), 
and angiotensin -converting enzyme (ACE ), biomarkers indicative of disease burden; a positive 
trend towards a less pro -atherogenic lipid profile; and trends for improvement in quality of life 
assessments for fatigue and pain.

6.1 DESCRIPTION OF  THE PROTOCOL   
This Phase 2/3, multicenter, repeat -dose, clinical trial will be divided into 2 consecutive major 
periods: 1) a randomized placebo -controlled, double -blind primary analysis period (PAP ) from 
Day -60 to Week 52 to be followed by 2) an extension treatment period (ETP ). Initially, the ETP 
will be doub le-blind as patients in the placebo arm cross over to active treatment.  
The PAP will include a screening/baseline period and a treatment period. During the 
screening/baseline period, from Day -[ADDRESS_1105096] infusion is administered. The 
visit schedule is calculated using Day 1 of the dose escalation period as the reference. Treatment 
assignment and randomization will be performed using an Interactive Voice Response 
System/Interactive Web Response System (IXRS ). Patients will be randomly and centrally 
assigned in a 1:1 ratio across sites using blocks of fixed size into 1 of 2 arms, placebo, saline 0.9% 
sodium chloride solution, or 3.0 mg/kg olipudase alfa target dose. Dose -escalation during the PAP 
to the randomized target doses will occur according to the schedule provided in Section  8.1.3  and 
Table  1. To maintain the double -blind, all patients will dose -escalate using the schedule provided 
(true dose escalation for patients who were in the placebo arm during the PAP and mock dose 
escalation for patients in the active arm during the PAP).  
After completing the PAP, patients will enter the ETP. Those who were randomized to the active 
arm will con tinue receiving the dose to which they were randomized during the PAP (or the 
highest tolerated dose [HTD ], if the randomized dose was intolerable). Patients randomized to the 
placebo arm in the PAP w ill cross over to active treatment in the ETP and will undergo dose 
escalation to a target dose of 3.0 mg/kg olipudase alfa.  
Study drug will be defined during the PAP as olipudase alfa or placebo and during the ETP as 
olipudase alfa and will be administere d intravenously once every 2 weeks.  
During the PAP, one rechallenge each will be allowed for doses administered at Week  0 
(0.1 mg/kg olipudase alfa or placebo) and at Week 4 (0.3 mg/kg olipudase alfa or placebo). 
Patients who are unable to tolerate the rec hallenge at those doses will be discontinued from the 
study. If a patient is discontinued due to inability to tolerate rechallenge (ie, a second dose of 
0.3 mg/kg olipudase alfa), then an additional patient may be randomized. Any patient who 
successfully d ose-escalates through Week 4, but cannot tolerate study drug infusions at later 
weeks, will continue in the trial at the Week 4 dose (ie, 0.3 mg/kg olipudase alfa or placebo) until 
end of study; likewise, any patient unable to tolerate a dose administered during later weeks will 
receive the HTD even if that dose is less than the target randomized dose and will continue in the 
ETP at this dose. The minimum active dose administered will be 0.3 mg/kg olipudase alfa.

the placebo arm during the PAP to the active treatment arm, except that patients unable to tolerate 
the rechallenge allowed each at Week 54 (0.1 mg/kg olipudase alfa) and at Week 58 (0.3  mg/kg 
olipudase a lfa) will discontinue from the study and will not be replaced.  
During the PAP and ETP, in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_800550] 
24 hours after the infusion during dose escalation (ie, through Week 16 and Week 70,

Home infusion may be initiated during a regional or national emergency declared by a 
governmental agency such as the COVID -19 pandemic (refer to Appendix B  for [LOCATION_013]) in the 
ETP by [CONTACT_800600], in compliance 
with applicable country -specific regulations. Patients must meet specific eligi bility requirements 
(Section  10.1.1 ).  Patients who initiated home infusion during the COVID -19 pandemic, and 
continue to be on home infusion, may continue receiving home infusion by [CONTACT_800601] 2 weeks (±3 days) until the end of the ETP (refer to Appendix B  for [LOCATION_013]) . 
For treatment periods during the PAP and the ETP, dose -limiting toxicity (DLT ) criteria will 
apply. A rescue strategy will be implemented for patients who experience significant clinical 
decline. Se e Section  8.1. 
6.2 DURATION OF STUDY PA RTICIPATION   
6.2.1  Duration of study participation for each patient   
The length of a patient's participation will be defined from Day [ADDRESS_1105099] planned 
assessment/visit, for at least [ADDRESS_1105100] study duration per patient will be as 
follows:  
• Screening period will be up to 60 days  
• PAP treatment period will be approxima tely 52 weeks. A patient will be considered “PAP 
completed” when the patient has been administered study drug at the target randomized or 
HTD and has completed the Week 52 assessments.  
• After [ADDRESS_1105101] 2  years 
and up to 4 years dependent upon continued regulatory approval of this protocol. A patient 
will be considered ‘ETP completed’ when the patient completes the end of study visit 
(within [ADDRESS_1105102] treatment) or has responded to  the final safety follow -up 
phone call from the study site made 30 to 37 days after the patient’s final administration of 
study drug (as applicable).

6.3 INTERIM ANALYSIS   
No interim analysis is planned during PAP.  However , during ETP, a formal summary of data or 
interim CSR(s) may be produced to support regulatory approval(s) and/or other 
submission/application requirement(s).  
6.4 STUDY COMMITTEES   
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC ), composed of members independent from 
the sponsor and the study investigators, is implemented to monitor patient safety by [CONTACT_800602]. The DMC will provide the sponsor with appropriate 
recommendations on the conduct of the clinical trial to ensure the protection and safety of the 
patients enrolled in the study (ie, exposure to study drug). All activities a nd responsibilities of the 
DMC are described in the DMC charter, in compliance with applicable guidance ( 8). 
Data Monitoring Committee meeting s will occur at regular intervals as outlined in the DMC 
charter. The report of a potential DLT to the sponsor or the occurrence of any safety related issues 
identified by [CONTACT_456]'s medical monitor or global safety officer that pose a medical concern, 
for example a fatal event, will result in the DMC holding an ad hoc review of the safety data and 
providing its recommendations to the sponsor regarding further patient treatment. Additional 
responsibilities of the DMC will be contained in the DMC charter.  
The first formal meeting of the DMC will occur approximately [ADDRESS_1105103] patient has

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential  Page 73 8.1.4  Dose -limiting toxicities   
For the purpose of this study, the events listed below are considered indicative of a potential DLT 
for study drug at a given dose. If a potential DLT is observed, dosing will be temporarily stopped 
in an individual patient or in the entire study, and the DMC will review the safety data. The DMC 
will then provide recommendation(s) to the sponsor regarding further patient treatment 
(Section  6.4). Screening for eligible patients may continue during DMC review of patient or study 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_206319].  
If any of the following AEs occur, dosing will be temporarily stopped for the specific patient who 
experi enced the AE, pending DMC review and recommendation (taking into consideration the 
relatedness of the AE to study treatment):  
• Any SAE, not related to the patient's underlying condition and considered related to the 
study treatment.  
• Any increase in AST, ALT , total bilirubin, or alkaline phosphatase (AP) >3x baseline 
(prior to olipudase alfa therapy) and > the upper limit of normal (ULN ). 
• Any increase in total bilirubin or AP >1.5x baseline in the prese nce of AST or  
ALT >2x ULN.  
• Any increase in ALT or AST >3x the ULN combined with an increase in ALT or AST 
>2x baseline (prior to olipudase alfa therapy) with symptoms of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, 
right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, or e osinophilia (> ULN).  
• Any AE that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26335], raises significant concern 
regarding the safety of olipudase alfa at the administered dose.  
When study drug dosing is interrupted for a particular patient, safety monitoring o f the patient will 
continue. If the AE(s) is/are reversible and the clinical laboratory tests (including LFTs) have 
normalized, the patient will resume dosing and receive the previously -tolerated lower dose 
(ie, dose administered on a previous week without  incident). Depending on the patient's response, 
dose escalation will either continue (as described in Section  8.1.1 ) or the patient will remain at the 
previously tolerated dose (ie, the patient's HTD).  
The investigator is responsible for notifying the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics 
Committee  (IRB/IEC ) in writing when a potential DLT is being evaluated at an investigative site.  
8.1.5  Study interruption criteria   
If either of these criteria are met:  
• 2 patients develop the same severe AE that is not related to their underlying condition, or  
• A death occurs that is assessed as related or possibly related to olipudase alfa.  
An ad hoc DMC  meeting will be held to review the safety data and provide its recommendations 
to the sponsor regarding further patient treatment.

If during the course of the study, a patient satisfies one or more of the following criteria indicative 
of clinical decline due to ASMD progression and after excluding other possible causes, study drug 
will be unblinded and the patient will be switched to the 3.0 mg/kg olipudase alfa group; dose 
escalating procedures and caveats provided in Table  1 and Section  8.1.3  will apply. See the study 
manual and the IXRS manual for unblinding procedures.

Bioanalysts are excluded from the clinical trial team and a process will be set up to prevent any 
potential unblinding.  
8.3.2  Randomization code b reaking during the study   
In case of an AE, the code should only be broken in circumstances when knowledge of the 
identity of study drug is required for treating the patient and i n consultation with the sponsor.  
Code breaking can be performed at any time by [CONTACT_800605]/or by 
[CONTACT_800606]. If the blind is broken, 
including for rescue treatment ( Section  8.1.6 ), the investigator should document the date, the hour, 
and the reason for breaking the code. See the IX RS manual for the code breaking process.  
8.4 METHOD OF ASSIGNING PATIENTS TO TREATMEN T GROUP   
Upon confirmation by [CONTACT_800607], eligible patients will be randomized as

Compliance to the treatment regimen will b e monitored in terms of the percentage of scheduled 
infusions the patient receives through the treatment periods. Every effort should be made to 
ensure that no infusion is missed.  
Noncompliance is defined as missing 4 total infusions (not for cause, such a s when the missed 
doses are required by [CONTACT_206354] a DLT) per each 12 -month period. As they are 
identified, the investigator should discuss noncompliant patients on a case by [CONTACT_800611]’s medical monitor (or designee).  
8.7.2  Return and/ or destruction of treatments   
Reconciliation of study drug must be performed at the site by [CONTACT_800612].  
If appropriate, a written authorization for destruction will be provided by [CONTACT_282147]. Destruction of study drug may be performed at the site 
depending on the site and local requirements; alternatively, study drug may be returned to the 
sponsor for destruction.

Prior and Concomitant Medication field of the electronic case report form (eCRF ) as appropriate.  
Prior and concomitant medications will be coded according to the World Health Organization 
Drug Dictionary.  
• Prior medications will be defined as medications that are taken in the [ADDRESS_1105119] infusion of study drug.  
• Concomitant medications will be defined as medications that are taken after the first 
infusion of study drug.  
During the entire study, prohibited medications include those that may decrease olipudase alfa 
activity (eg, fluoxetin e, chlorpromazine, tricyclic antidepressants [eg, imipramine, or 
desipramine]). See the study manual for information on concomitant medications that may 
decrease olipudase alfa activity.  
Cationic amphiphilic antihistamines, such as loratadine, desloratadin e, astemizole, ebastine, 
terfenadine, and clemastine, may decrease olipudase alfa activity. Therefore, the need for their use 
in oral or IV administration should be carefully considered. There is no restriction on topi[INVESTIGATOR_206323].

prohibited from using medications or herbal supplements that are potentially hepatotoxic 
(eg, 3-hydroxy -3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, erythromycin, valproic a cid,

drugs or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248].  
Pretreatment for prophylactic management of IARs should not be used systematically. In patients 
who experience moder ate to severe or recurrent IARs with evidence of hypersensitivity (as 
defined in Section  10.4.4 ), pretreatment regimens (eg, antihistamines, antipyretics, 
glucocorticoids) may be prescribed by [CONTACT_282148]. In particular, the 
need for cationic amphiphilic antihistamines administered orally or IV should be carefully 
considered given the potential risk for functional inhibition of olipudase alfa activity by [CONTACT_800613].  
Treatment of infusion -associated reactions  
For management of mild IARs, infusion rate reductions (eg, reduced to half the rate) or temporary 
interruptions may mitigate the r eaction. For moderate to severe or recurrent IARs, the investigator 
may consider the use of pretreatment medications (eg, antihistamines, antipyretics, and/or 
glucocorticoids) if the symptoms are suggestive of hypersensitivity reaction, in addition to 
infusion rate reductions, interruptions, or discontinuations. In particular, the need for cationic 
amphiphilic antihistamines administered orally or IV should be carefully considered given the 
potential risk for functional inhibition of olipudase alfa activity  by [CONTACT_206358].  
Patients experiencing symptoms suggestive of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic 
or anaphylactoid reactions, during study drug infusion will be managed according to the general 
standards of care consistent with the treatment of such reactions. If anaphylaxis or other severe 
allergic reactions occur, the infusion will be discontinued immediately, and appropriate medical 
treatment will be initiated. Because of the potential for severe IARs, appropriate medical 
personnel and equi pment to perform resuscitation must be readily available in the event of a 
hypersensitivity reaction.

activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, and enjoyment 
of life) is assessed in 6 items. Item 3 of the BFI is also separately administered via eDiary 
(Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
• The BPI -SF is a validated, self -administered questionnaire designed to measure a patient’s 
perceived level of pain. The BPI -SF measures the patient’s intensity of pain (sensory 
dimension), the interference of pain in the patient’s life (reactive dimension), and asks the 
patient about pain relief, pain quality, and  the patient’s perception of the cause of pain 
(18, 19). The BPI -SF consists of [ADDRESS_1105131] week. Item 3 of the BPI -SF 
is also separa tely administered via eDiary ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
• The SRS rates 5 items: abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, early satiety, abdominal 
body image, and ability to bend down. The 5 items were selected from the Myelofibrosis 
Symptom Assessment Form (MF -SAF) (JAKARTA, NCT#  01437787). Using a numerical 
rating scale of 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable), these questions asse ss within the last 
[ADDRESS_1105132] of splenomegaly -related items that are common in patients with 
ASMD. The scores are collected via an eDiary over 7 days ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). Then, the

• The FACIT -dyspnea Short form is a 2 -part questionnaire: [ADDRESS_1105133] 7 days doing 
activities, such as dressing, walking, and common household chores; in Part 2, patients 
rate how functionally limiting the dyspnea experienced was while doing the activities 
presented in Part 1. This i nstrument is administered via eDiary ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
• The NPB -HAQ is a disease -specific questionnaire that covers  various aspects of fatigue, 
pain, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], abdominal complaints, and quality of life as well as questions specific to 
ASMD symptoms and physical activity. The questionnaire administered at baseline will 
consist of items to gather information on patien t background, diagnostic history, family 
history, medical/surgical history, resource utilization, current symptomatology and 
functional status. The questionnaire administered during subsequent visits will assess 
interval history and resource utilization, a s well as current symptomatology and functional

EuroQol 5 dimension, 5 level (EQ -5D-5L) health status measure consists of 5  dimensions: 
mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each 
dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe 
problems, and extreme problems. The respondent is asked to indicate his/her health state 
by [CONTACT_13158] (or placing a cross) in the bo x against the most appropriate statement in each of 
the 5 dimensions. This decision results in a 1 -digit number expressing the level selected 
for that dimension. The digits for 5 dimensions can be combined in a 5 -digit number 
describing the respondent’s he alth state. Index -based values (ie, utilities) are a major 
feature of the EQ -5D-5L instrument, facilitating the calculation of quality -adjusted life 
years that are used to inform economic evaluations of health care interventions.

9.2.10  Infusion -associated reactions   
In the event that a patient reports an IAR of moderate/severe intensity or recurrent that is 
suggestive of a hypersensitivity reaction (as defined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ), additional blood samples 
will be collected and sent to the sponsor for anti -olipudase alfa antibody (IgG and IgE), tryptase 
activity, and complement activation testing as described below. Skin testing may also be 
performed if a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected.  
• For IgE anti -olipudase alfa antibody testing the same pre -dose serum sample drawn for 
anti-olipudase alfa IgG testing may be used if the IAR occurs at that study visit. If 
a predose sample was not drawn on that day, the patient should return to the study site at 
least 3 days after the event for a serum sample to be drawn. Testing is conducted for 
research purposes to gain additional information as to individual patients’ responses to 
study t reatment and for aiding in the clinical management of patient safety  
• Blood samples will be drawn within 1 to 3 hours of an IAR for serum tryptase activity 
testing (serum) and complement activation testing (plasma), when clinically indicated  
• Refer to the st udy-specific IAR Sample Collection Process manual for guidelines on the 
collection and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_26172] (IgG and IgE, antidrug antibody, tryptase, and

• If necessary, skin testing may be performed in patients who experience an IAR that meets 
the following criteria following consultation between the investigator and the sponsor:  
- IAR has moderate or severe intensity or is r ecurrent  
and 
- The patient has persistent and intractable symptoms of hypersensitivity suggestive of 
an IgE -mediated hypersensitivity reaction as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  
See also study manual for skin testing procedures.  
Cytokine release syndrome: If a patient experiences an AE of moderate or severe intensity that is 
suggestive of CRS (as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ), an additional blood sample for the multiplex 
assay (Meso Scale) and calcitonin will be drawn immediately (if a sample had not been obtained 
already within the past 30 minutes).

9.7 APPROPRIATENESS OF MEAS UREMENTS   
Dose escalation is necessary to progressively reduce stores of accumulated sphingomyelin and to 
avoid a large release of ceramide. Clinical AEs and s afety biomarkers identified in the Phase  1 
single -dose and repeat -dose studies study will also be used to monitor treated patients for potential 
DLTs (as described in Section  8.1.4 ). 
If a patient experiences an IAR suggestive of a hypersensitivity reaction (as defined in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ), blood samples for anti -olipudase alfa antibody (IgG and IgE), tryptase activity, 
and complement activation testing will be collected. For patients in whom IgG antibodies 
develop, neutralizi ng antibody testing will also be performed.  
Efficacy parameters include improvements in spleen and liver volume (as measured by [CONTACT_800628]), pulmonary imaging and function (HRCT, X -ray, PFTs), cardiopulmonary function by 
[CONTACT_800595], bone diseas e infiltration, hematology parameters, and patient -reported 
health -related quality of life instruments.  
The DL CO was chosen as a primary efficacy endpoint because this PFT reflects the underlying 
pathophysiological infiltration manifested by [CONTACT_800629] c ells and changes in DLco can 
objectively show the effect of olipudase alfa treatment on lung function and reducing local 
inflammation. Pulmonary involvement is common and progressive, although the extent and 
severity of involvement varies widely among pati ents ( 21). Foam cell infiltrates of the pulmonary 
alveoli block oxygen uptake through the alveolar wall into the blood vessels. This abnormal 
diffusing capacity is consistent with ILD ( 9) which may manifest with coughing, shortness of 
breath, and recurrent respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073]. Wit h low partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) values, 
patients are affected by [CONTACT_800630]. In most patients with ASMD, decreased 
pulmonary diffusion secondary to alveolar infiltration becomes evident in childhood and 
progresses with age ( 22). Life -threatening bronchopneumonia may occur and cor pulmonale has 
been described; progressive pulmonary involvement is associated with higher morbidity  and 
mortality ( 21). Severely affected patients may experience significant pulmonary compromise by 
[CONTACT_654] 15 to 20 years. The excess sphingomyeli n and other lipi[INVESTIGATOR_800564] ( 23). Some patients develop chronic oxygen dependence with

assessed with the instruments listed in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
Changes from baseline in spleen volume and DL CO, separately, at Week 52 were selected as the 
primary efficacy endpoints in this Phase 2/[ADDRESS_1105144] enomegaly is a significant, consistently 
present manifestation of ASMD, and the degree of splenomegaly has been recognized as clinically 
relevant by [CONTACT_800631], and negati vely correlated with white blood cell count, hemoglobin, high 
density lipoprotein, percent predicted FVC, and height Z score ( 24). In both ASM D and a similar 
lysosomal storage disorder, Gaucher disease, splenomegaly is central to the underlying 
pathophysiology and is usually the first presenting clinical sign. Furthermore, reduction in spleen 
volume is recognized as a clinically meaningful endpo int in Gaucher disease ( 25, 26). 
Clinical manifestations common to both ASMD and Gaucher disease include 
hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Both diseases primarily affect the 
monocyte/macrophage lineage of cells and thus are diseases that affect the reticuloendothelial  
system. The main sphingolipi[INVESTIGATOR_800565] (glucosylceramide) and 
ASMD (sphingomyelin) are major components of the plasma membranes of red blood cells, white 
blood cells, and platelets, which cannot be broken down by [CONTACT_179968]. Ac cordingly, 
assessments have been planned to monitor changes in hematology.  
Due to the known association of sphingomyelin with cholesterol, patients with ASMD often 
accumulate cholesterol, and subsequently are affected by [CONTACT_90124][INVESTIGATOR_035], characterized by a high 
atherogenic cardiovascular risk profile. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_800566] ( 27, 28) and recent case 
reports have described the occurrence of premature coronary artery disease ( 27). Accordingly, the 
fasting lipid profile will be assessed as an efficacy parameter and the NMR spectrum of HDL will 
be characterized ( 12, 13, 29). NMR lipid profiles analyzed for all patients through [ADDRESS_1105145] been shown to be inversely  correlated with lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_727385] Z -scores ( 30), the severity of bone disease will be measured at baseline and once 
every year. A biomarker for bone resorption, C -telopeptide concentrations in serum have been 
shown to be decreased in patients with Gaucher disease.  
Although hemoglobin level, platelet count, and white blood cell count will comprise part of the 
standard safety l aboratory assessments, these parameters are often abnormal in patients with 
ASMD because many cells of the reticuloendothelial system originate in the bone marrow and it 
is one of the most extensively involved organs in ASMD ( 31, 32). Bone marrow involvement, 
combined with hypersplen ism, contributes to the thrombocytopenia, anemia, and to the 
neutropenia sometimes observed in patients with ASMD.  
Biomarkers will be measured that are known to be associated with macrophage proliferation 
(ACE), secreted by [CONTACT_93247] (NP cells) macrophages  (chitotriosidase and CCL18), and

10.1.1  Home infusions   
Home infusion may be given by [CONTACT_800632] a regional or national emergency 
declared by a governmental agency such as the COVID -19 pandemic (refer to Appendix B  for 
[LOCATION_013]) in the ETP every 2 weeks (±3 days), in compliance with applicable country -specific 
regulations. Patients must meet specific eligibility requirements outlined below.  In addition, the 
investigator and the sponsor must agree that home infusion is appropriate for each patient.  
Patients who initiated home infusion during the COVID -19 pandemic, and continue to be on 
home infusion, may continue receiving home infusion by [CONTACT_800589] 
2 weeks (±3 days ) until the end of the ETP (refer to Appendix B  for [LOCATION_013]).  
For a patient to  receive home infusions, the following criteria must be met.   
• The inves tigator must agree in writing that home infusion is appropriate for the patient.  
• The patient must be willing and able to comply with home infusion procedures.  
• The patient must, in the investigator’s (or designee’s) opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], have been clinically stable 
with no history of moderate or severe IARs for at least [ADDRESS_1105152] the patient’s ability to tolerate the infusion.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential  Page 102 • No infusion rate increases will be allowed while a patient is receiving home infusions.  
• The patient must have no ongoing (not yet recovered) SAEs that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], may affect the patient’s ability to tolerate the infusion.  
• Home infusion infrastructure, resources, and procedures must be established and available 
according t o applicable country -specific regulations.  
• In patients experiencing an IAR while being infused at home, the investigator should 
assess whether or not it is safe for the patient to continue to be treated via home infusion or 
return to the site for the subsequent visit and when the patient would be r eady to resume 
home infusion. In case home infusion continues, the investigator will guide the home 
infusion staff on the measures to be followed for subsequent infusion to manage the IAR 
(eg, infusion interruption, premedication, change the infusion rate,  etc. (See Treatment of 
infusion -associated reactions in Section  8.8). 
• If recurrent IARs or hypersensitivity reaction s occur, the investigator should assess 
whether or not it is safe for the patient to continue to be treated via home infusion.  
• If a severe hypersensitivity reaction or an anaphylaxis reaction occurs, during an infusion 
given at home, treatment will be disc ontinued immediately, and appropriate medical 
treatment will be initiated. The patient will return to the study site for further management 
until the investigator agrees with the sponsor that it is safe for the patient to continue to be 
treated via home in fusion. See Section  8.8 for details on severe hypersensitivity and 
anaphylaxis management.  
• Prior to beginning home inf usions, the home infusion staff, including new staff members, 
must have been appropriately trained and/or licensed, if applicable, on proper procedures 
to prepare and administer infusions, monitor patients, document procedures, and report to 
site on a time ly basis.  
• The home infusion staff must have access to and be trained on proper use of safety 
equipment, including, but not limited to, cardiopulmonary resuscitation equipment.  
• Home infusion staff must keep source documentation of the infusion, including 
documentation of any AEs, IARs, examinations/ assessments, sample collections and 
concomitant medication.  Home infusion staff must be amenable to providing specific 
source documentation to [COMPANY_011] Genzyme and agree to be monitored.  The Principal 
Investigato r is still responsible for all study procedures and patient’s safety even when 
delegating infusion responsibilities to the home care company.  
• An additional questionnaire about home infusion experience may be added any time 
before end of the study for patie nts who received home infusion treatment.  
• If the site visit is not possible during a regional or national emergency declared by a 
governmental agency such as the COVID -19 pandemic (refer to Appendix B  for [LOCATION_013]) 
due to site closure or extenuating circumstances that prevent an in -person site visit, and 
home infusion already approved for the eligible patient, the investigator can decide 
whether reintroduction should occur at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/study site or home visit.

10.2 DEFINITION OF SOURCE  DATA   
Source data are all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other 
activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the study. Source 
data are contained in source documents. Examples of  these original documents and data records 
include hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patients’ diaries 
or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_800569], microfiches, 
photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X -rays, patient files, and records kept at 
the pharmacy, the laboratories, and other departments involved in the clinic al study.  
All protocol -required information collected during the study must be recorded by [CONTACT_282158]. The source documentation 
will be used to enter the protocol -required information  into the eCRF. No data should therefore be 
directly entered into the eCRF.  
10.3 HANDLING OF PATIENT TEMPORARY OR PERMANE NT TREATMENT 
DISCONTINUATION AND OF PATIENT STUDY DIS CONTINUATION   
Study drug will be continued whenever possible; however, if study drug is stopped, it will be 
determined if the stop can be made temporarily as permanent discontinuation will be a last resort. 
Any discontinuation will be fully documented in the source and eCRF. In any case, the patient 
should remain in the study as long as possible.  
Pregnancy  
Pregnancy will lead to treatment discontinuation in all cases. No studies of olipudase alfa have 
been conducted in pregnant women. To ensure patient safety for thi s study, all female patients of 
childbearing potential must have a negative serum β -HCG pregnancy test at screening and before 
undergoing any further assessments and procedures. Urine β -HCG will be tested up to [ADDRESS_1105153] infusion of the stu dy; then once every [ADDRESS_1105154] dose of study drug. Every effort will be 
made to prevent pregnancy during this study.

patient’s medical record. If possible, all tests and evaluations listed for the end of study visit will 
be carried out. If a patient fai ls to return for the necessary visits, then every effort must be made to 
contact [CONTACT_282157](s), which will be recorded on the eCRF.  
Alcohol consumption  
Although blood alcohol testing will not be required, patients must be willing to abstain from the 
use of alcohol for 1 day before and 3 days after each study drug infusion ( Section  7.2). 
Patients will be counseled to limit alcohol consumption during the study:  
• Male patients to a maximum of 30  g alcohol per day (2 drinks/day)  
• Female patients to a maximum of 15  g alcohol per day (1 drink/day)  
Patients who do not limit alcohol can be discontinued from the study, according to investigator’s 
discretion.  
10.3.[ADDRESS_1105156](s)   
Temporary treatment discontinuation corresponds to more than 1 dose not administered to the 
patient as decided by [CONTACT_312351].  
Temporary treatment discontinuation (also referred to as tre atment interruption) may be 
considered by [CONTACT_151332].  
Re-initiation of study drug administration will be done under close and appropriate clinical/and or 
laboratory monitoring after the investigator has considered to his/her best medical judgment that 
the responsibility of study drug in the occurrence of the concerned event was unlikely and if the 
study selection criteria are still met ( Section  7.1 and Section  7.2). Before re -initiation of treatment , 
the sponsor must be consulted to determine the starting dose and if dose escalation will be 
required (see Section  8.1.3 ). 
For all patients who have missed two or more doses that require reintroduction of olipudase alfa, 
the dose reintroduction will take place at the site. During the COVID -19 pandemic, if site visits 
are not possible and home infusion is already appro ved for the eligible patient,  the investigator 
can decide whether reintroduction should occur at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/study site or home visit.   
Upon reintroduction of treatment, certain assessments will be repeated at infusions 
(Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). The investigator will decide if additional specific assessments may be required 
before the patient can begin the reintroduction regimen.  
For all temporary treatment discontinuations, the d uration will be recorded by [CONTACT_800633].

Permanent disco ntinuation of study drug is any discontinuation associated with the definitive 
decision from the investigator, sponsor, or the patient not to re -expose the patient to the study 
drug at any time.  
10.3.[ADDRESS_1105158] of criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation   
The patient may withdraw from treatment if he/she decides to do so, at any time and irrespective 
of the reason; withdrawal may be the decision of the investigator or sponsor. All eff orts will be 
made to document the reasons for discontinuation in the eCRF.  
Patients should discontinue from treatment for the following reasons:  
• The patient reported unacceptable toxicity (see Section  8.1.4 ) 
• The patient required intervention or therapy precluded by [CONTACT_800634]  
• The patient was unable to com ply with the requirements of the protocol  
• The patient was noncompliant with study activities or wished to be withdrawn from 
treatment  
• The patient was erroneously included in the study (failed to satisfy all study criteria in 
Section  7) 
• The patient participated in another interventional investigational study while in ASCEND 
study  
• Pregnancy  
In addition, the sponsor may decide to discontinue the study early for any other reason.  
Any relevant abnormal laboratory value or ECG parameter will be immediately rechecked for 
confirmation before making a decision of permanent discontinuation of the IMP for the concerned 
patient.  
Patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug and who are withdrawn from the study will be 
asked to complete all EOS/discontinuation assessments before withdrawal (as detailed in 
Section  1.2) and will receive a safety follow -up telephone call from the study site 30 to 37  days 
after the final administration of study drug.  
The investigato r will document the reason(s) for treatment discontinuation/study withdrawal on 
the eCRF.  
In all cases, the sponsor must be notified of all study terminations as soon as possible and the 
reason for and date of withdrawal from the study must be recorded in the eCRF and in the 
patient’s medical record. If possible, all tests and evaluations listed for the end of study visit will 
be carried out. If a patient fails to return for the necessary visits, then every effort must be made to 
contact [CONTACT_800635](s), which will be recorded on the eCRF.

Any patient who discontinues participating in the study w ill be contact[CONTACT_800636](s) for discontinuation and collection of any potential AEs.  
If possible, all tests and evaluations listed for the end of study/early discontinuation visit in 
Section  1.[ADDRESS_1105159] the patient, determine the 
reason(s) for discontinuation, and record the reason(s) on the e -CRF.  
In all cases, the sponsor must be notified of all study terminations as soon as possible and the 
reason for and  date of withdrawal from the study must be recorded in the e -CRF and in the 
patient’s medical record.  
In addition, since the primary study comparison is based on intent to treat principle using all 
randomized patients with any study treatment, missing data , especially the key study assessments 
during the PAP (12 months) may potentially lead to biased results and challenges in assessing the 
treatment effect of the study drug. Therefore, all efforts should be made to continue to follow the 
patients for primar y and key secondary endpoints, after the temporary or permanent 
discontinuation of treatment, in addition to the standard post study safety follow up. If possible, at 
the minimum, patients should be assessed at their regularly scheduled Week 52 visit (or a s close 
as possible to Week 52) if treatment discontinuation occurred prior to that visit.  
10.3.5  Procedure and consequence for patient withdrawal from study   
Patients may withdraw from the study before study completion if they decide to do so, at any time 
and irrespective of the reason. Patients requesting withdrawal should be informed that withdrawal 
of consent for follow -up may jeopardize the public health value of the study. Preferabl y the 
patient should withdraw consent in writing and, if the patient refuses or is physically unavailable, 
the site should document and sign the reason for the patient’s failure to withdraw consent in 
writing.  
The reason for withdrawal should be captured. Patients who withdraw should be explicitly asked 
about the contribution of possible AEs to their decision to withdraw consent, and any AE 
information elicited should be documented.  
Patients who withdraw should be asked to come back for the end of study vis it and will receive 
the safety follow phone call.  
For patients who fail to return to the site, the investigator should make the best effort to contact 
[CONTACT_102] (eg, contact[CONTACT_12531]’s family or private physician, reviewing available registries or 
health care databases), and to determine his/her health status, including at least his/her vital status. 
Attempts to contact [CONTACT_56480]’s records (eg, times and dates 
of attempted telephone contact, receipt for sending a re gistered letter).  
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will specify how these patients lost to follow -up for their 
primary endpoints will be considered.

10.4.1  Definitions of adverse events   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse event   
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
patient administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have 
a causal relationship with this treatment.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serio us adverse event   
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death, or  
• Is life -threatening, or  
Note: The term “life -threatening”  in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26109] p rolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is a medically important event  
• Medical and scientific judgment will be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_800570] (ie, specific measures or correctiv e treatment) to 
prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above  
Note: The following list of medically important events is intended to serve as a guideline 
for determining when a condition is to be considered a medically important event. Th e list 
is not intended to be exhaustive:  
- Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for:

[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse event of special interest   
An AESI is an AE (serious or non -serious) of scientific and medical concern specific to the 
sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by [CONTACT_206381]. Such events may re quire further investigation in 
order to characterize and understand them. Adverse events of special interest may be added or 
removed during a study by [CONTACT_12548]. Reporting guidelines and follow -up instructions 
are provided below.  
AESIs include the  following:  
• Pregnancy  of a female patient entered in the study as well as pregnancy occurring in 
a female partner of a male patient entered in this study  
• Symptomatic overdose (serious or non -serious) of study drug  
- An overdose (accidental or intentional) of  study drug defined as an increase of at least 
30% of the dose to be administered in the specified duration or if the dose is 
administered in less than half the recommended duration of administration  
- An asymptomatic overdose will be reported as a standard AE 
• Laboratory values: The following laboratory values and symptoms will be considered 
AESIs (see also Dose -limiting toxicities in Section  8.1.[ADDRESS_1105161] with immediate notification in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  and Summary of adverse 
event reporting instructions in Table  3), as follows:  
- Any increase in AST, ALT, total bilirubin, or AP >3x baseline (prior to olipudase alfa 
therapy) and > ULN  
-  Any increase in total bilirubin or AP >1.5x baseline in the presence o f AST or 
ALT  >2x ULN.  
- Any increase in ALT or AST >3x the ULN combined with an increase in ALT or

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential  Page 109 • Infusion -associated reactions:  Some AEs may be manifestations of IARs, including 
hypersensitivity reaction, APR, and CRS; however, the original signs and symptoms may 
be reported as AEs. In the eCRF, investigators will be asked to identify if  a specific AE 
represents a clinical manifestation of the IAR.  
Infusion -associated reactions are defined as AEs that occur during the infusion or within 
24 hours after the start of infusion and are considered as related or possibly related to the 
study tre atment by [CONTACT_8893]. An event occurring ≥24 hours after the 
start of an infusion may be judged by [CONTACT_800637]. For this 
study, IARs may present as hypersensitivity reactions, APRs, and CRS.  
- Hypersensitivi ty reactions  
Infusion -associated hypersensitivity reactions seen with other enzyme replacement 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_282118] -mediated (IgG/IgE) and occur after 
sensitization. After subsequent exposure to the antigen typi[INVESTIGATOR_800571], a “sensitized” patient may experience a broad range of allergic 
reactions that can be mild to severe or life threatening. Anaphylaxis (or anaphylactic 
reaction) is a serious, IgE mediated allergic reaction that is rapid in onset, and m ay 
cause death. Anaphylactoid, or non -immunologic anaphylaxis, reactions may present 
with similar serious clinical manifestations as anaphylaxis, but without prior exposure 
to the drug and are due to nonimmunologic -mediated mast cell degranulation. 
Althoug h mechanistically different, anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions are 
treated similarly.  
Common symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions seen with other enzyme replacement 
therapy include urticaria, rash, dyspnea, and less frequently, angioedema. Other 
symptoms of hypersensitivity IARs include fever, hypotension, tachycardia, nausea, 
vomiting, pain, and headache.  
- Acute phase reactions  
Considered a type of IAR and specific to infusion with olipudase alfa, APRs were 
observed in the Phase 1 single -dose study  and the Phase 1b repeat -dose study ( 6). 
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], APRs occurred within 12 to 72 hours after olipudase alfa infusion and were 
indicative of a n inflammatory response as they were associated with elevations in 
hsCRP and changes in acute phase reactants including, but not limited to, neutrophils, 
iron, ferritin, fibrinogen, D -dimer, transferrin, albumin, Protime, and partial 
thromboplastin time.  
Typi[INVESTIGATOR_282119], but were not limited to, 
pyrexia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and pain; and were concurrent with the changes in 
specific laboratory parameters. Accordingly, APRs will be determined based on 
combined sig nificant laboratory findings and clinical symptoms.  
- Cytokine release syndrome  
Cytokine release syndrome is another type of IAR, attributed to the release of 
excessive amounts of cytokines shortly after the intravenous administration of certain 
therapeutic agents. The severe form of CRS is a cytokine storm, which may be life 
threatening. Nonclinical studies of high -dose olipudase alfa have suggested the

olipudase alfa in the Phase 1, single -dose study in IL -8 and IL -6; macrophage 
inflammatory protein 1, alpha component (MIP -1α); macrophage inflammatory 
protein  1, beta component (MIP -1β); and other cytokines and biomarkers (based 
Myriad Rules -Based Medicine Human Multi -Analyte Profil e® antigen panel). Unlike 
immunoglobulin -mediated hypersensitivity reactions, no prior antigen exposure is 
required for the development of CRS.  
Symptoms of CRS develop soon after exposure and range from mild to severe. 
Although CRS shares some symptoms wit h other IARs (ie, hypersensitivity reactions 
and APRs), typi[INVESTIGATOR_800572], nausea, vomiting, fatigue, pain, 
myalgia, and in severe cases, multi -organ system dysfunction or failure, severe 
headache, and pulmonary edema. Cytokine release syndr ome will be determined based 
on combined significant laboratory findings and clinical symptoms.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definitions for criteria of adverse events   
Relationship to study treatment  
Assessment of the association between the AE and study exposure is important for regulatory 
reporting and will be made in blinded studies and also for known comparators. For each AE/SAE 
the investigator will determine if there is a reasonable possibility a nd demonstrated by [CONTACT_800638] a causal relationship between the study treatment and the AE according to the 
categories below:  
• Not Related: There is no suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884] a causal relationship between exposure and the AE.  
• Unlikely Related: No evidenc e exists for a causal relationship between exposure and the 
AE; however, such a relationship cannot be excluded.  
• Possibly Related: Some evidence exists that there is a possibility of a causal relationship 
between exposure and the AE.  
• Related: Strong eviden ce exists that there is a causal relationship between exposure and 
the AE.  
A relationship to the study drug must be assigned for each AE/SAE recorded, even if there is only 
limited information at the time. The investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_800573] -up information and amend the AE/SAE report accordingly.

and pharmacokinetic data.  
11.2 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE   
The sample size calculations are based on the 2 primary efficacy endpoints of percentage change 
from baseli ne in spleen volume (expressed in MN) at Week 52 and the percentage change from 
baseline in DL CO (expressed as % predicted of normal) at Week 52. The assumptions for the 
spleen volume endpoint are the following:  
• An 11.8% common standard deviation based on data from previous ASMD and Gaucher 
disease type 1 studies  
• A 30% mean difference from baseline to Week 52 between 3.0 mg/kg olipudase alfa and 
placebo in percentage change in spleen volume MN  
• An expected exclusion rate from the modified intent -to-treat (mI TT) population of 11%  
Based on the above assumptions, a comparison between 3.0 mg/kg olipudase alfa and placebo 
would have over 95% power using a t -test at a 2 -sided 5.0% significance level with 36  patients 
randomized 1:1 to placebo or 3.0 mg/kg olipudase alfa. At a 2.5% significance level, the power 
would still be over 95%.  
The following assumptions for the DL CO endpoint are based on results obtained from the 
olipudase alfa Phase 1b Study DFI13412:  
• A 20% common standard deviation  
• A 25% mean difference from baseline to Week 52 between 3.0 mg/kg olipudase alfa and 
placebo in percentage change in DL CO (in % predicted)  
• An expected exclusion rate from the mITT population of 11%  
Based on these assumptions , a comparison between the 3.0 mg/kg treatment arm and the placebo 
arm will have 93% power using a t -test at a 2 -sided 5.0% significance level and with 36  patients 
randomized 1:1 to placebo or 3.0 mg/kg.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential  Page 117 The assumptions for the splenomegaly -related score e ndpoint came from the [COMPANY_011] -sponsored 
clinical trial in myelofibrosis (JAKARTA, NCT# 01437787). The assumptions for the power 
calculations are:  
• A common standard deviation of 9.4  
• A mean difference of 8.0 from baseline to Week 52 between 3.0 mg/kg of olipu dase alfa 
and placebo in the splenomegaly -related score  
• An expected exclusion rate from the mITT population of 11%  
Based on the above assumptions, a comparison between 3.0 mg/kg of olipudase alfa and placebo 
will have 82% power using a t -test to detect a s tatistical trend, defined as 2 -sided p -value ≤0.15, 
with 36 patients randomized 1:1 to placebo and 3.0 mg/kg of olipudase alfa.  
For the US protocol, in which a combination spleen endpoint is used, using the simplifying 
assumption that the 2 components of t he combination spleen endpoint (spleen volume and SRS) 
are independent, the likelihood that statistical significance (spleen volume significance based on

11.5.2  Analyses of efficacy endpoints   
Efficacy endpoints and assessments are provided in Section  9.1. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary efficacy analysis   
The 2 primary efficacy endpoints (percentage change in spleen volume in MN from baseline to 
Week  52 [combined with change in SRS from baseline to Week 52 in the US only, and is referred 
to as the “combination spleen endpoint”]) and percentage change in DL CO in percent predicted 
from baseline to 52 weeks) will be analyzed in the mITT population using the mixed model for 
repeated measures.  
For percent change in DLco (% predicted) f rom baseline, the mixed model for repeated measures 
(MMRM) will include baseline DLco (% predicted), baseline age, treatment arm, study visit 
(Week 26, Week 52), and study visit by [CONTACT_800641]; have 
an unstructured variance -cova riance matrix; and be fit using restricted maximum likelihood 
estimation. Comparisons between treatment arms will be made using least -square mean contrasts 
at the [ADDRESS_1105168] 1 2 months of the study 
regardless of the treatment discontinuation status, with the exception that measurements made 
after the switch of treatment (eg, placebo patients switch to olipudase alfa after meeting the rescue 
criteria) will not be considered. For the primary analysis, missing data will not be imputed and 
will be assumed as Missing at Random (MAR).

symptom score (SRS), when baseline value of the spleen volume (or SRS) will be used as 
covariate.  
Descriptive assessment of MAR assumption and sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of 
missing data are described in the SAP.  
Hypothesis tests will be 2 -sided and adjusted for multiple comparisons to maintain a famil y-wise 
Type 1 error rate of 5%. The details of multiplicity adjustments are provided in Section  11.5.4 . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary efficacy analyses   
The secondary efficacy endpoints include the following:  
• Percentage change in liver volume (in MN) from baseline to Week 52  
• Percentage change in platelet counts from baseline to Week 52  
• Week 52 change from baseline in fatigue severity as measured by [CONTACT_145701] 3 of the BFI scale  
• Week 52 change from baseline in pain severity as measured by [CONTACT_145701] 3 of the BPI -SF scale  
• Week 52 change from baseline in dyspnea severity as mea sured by [CONTACT_800615] 
• Change in SRS from baseline to Week 52 (except US, where it is part of the primary 
"combination spleen endpoint") ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) 
The secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed in the mITT population using the mixed model 
for repeated measures and 2 sided hypothesis tests. The multiplicity adjustment for the secondary 
endpoints usi ng a hierarchical, closed testing principle is described in Section  11.5.4 . Handling of 
the missing data for secon dary efficacy endpoints will be described in the SAP.

Long -term efficacy will be summarized for all efficacy endpoints using data collected during the

11.5.4  Multiplicity considerations   
The hypothesis testing for the primary efficacy endpoints and secondary efficacy endpoints will 
be adjusted for multiplicity using a 2 -stage gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_800574] 5% familywise 
error rate. A Hochberg method will be used to test the 2 primary  endpoints followed by 
[CONTACT_112973], closed hypothesis testing for the secondary efficacy endpoints. The primary efficacy 
endpoint testing will proceed as follows:  
Compare olipudase alfa to placebo on DLco and spleen volume: The overall 5% significance leve l

higher of the 2 p -values will be compared to 0.05. If the higher p -value is ≤0.05, the 
primary efficacy testing stops, and both primary endpoints are considered statistically 
significant.  
• If the higher p -values is ≥0.05, the primary endpoint associated with the higher p -value is 
not signi ficant and the lower p -value is compared to 0.025. If the lower p -value is  ≤0.025, 
the primary endpoint associated with this p -value is considered statistically significant.  
• In the US, the combined spleen endpoint will be considered statistically significa nt if, 
from Steps 1 and 2, the spleen volume endpoint is significant and the SRS p -value  ≤0.15.  
The hypothesis testing for the secondary efficacy endpoints will proceed in a hierarchical fashion 
using the closed testing principle, and will stop if there is  a nonsignificant comparison. From 
sponsor perspective, the study is declared positive if either DLco or combination spleen endpoint 
is significant.  
For Europe and the rest of world, from sponsor perspective, the study is declared positive if at 
least one of the primary endpoints is statistically significant by [CONTACT_713080].  
If statistical significance is reached on both the DLco and spleen volume using the Hochberg 
method (and the trend in splenomegaly -related score is established in case of [LOCATION_003]), then  
hypothesis testing of the secondary efficacy endpoints will proceed using sequential testing at 
5% level with the order as specified below. At any step when the endpoint is not significant at 
5% level, the formal testing in subsequent steps will stop; the  p-values for the subsequent 
endpoints in the sequence will be considered exploratory and hence interpreted at the nominal 
level. This controls the overall type I error level at 5%, using the closed testing principle. If either 
of the primary endpoints is not significant, then hypothesis testing for the secondary endpoints 
will be considered exploratory, and p -values will be interpreted at the nominal level. Testing will 
proceed according to the following sequence:  
1. Percentage change in liver volume (in MN) from baseline to Week 52  
2. Percentage change in platelet counts from baseline to Week 52  
3. Week 52 change from baseline in fatigue severity as measured by [CONTACT_145701] 3 of the BFI scale  
4. Week 52 change from baseline in pain severity as measured by [CONTACT_145701] 3 of the BPI -SF scale

• The baseline value is defined generally as the last available value before randomization, 
except hematology and ECG parameters. Baseli ne for hematology parameters is derived as 
the mean of all available results before the start of first infusion. Baseline for ECG 
parameters is derived as the mean of all available results on the Day 1/Week [ADDRESS_1105169] infusion.  
• The f ollowing definitions will be applied to laboratory parameters, ECGs and vital signs.  
- The potentially clinically significant abnormality (PCSA ) values are defined as 
abnormal v alues considered medically important by [CONTACT_800642]/thresholds based on literature review and defined by [CONTACT_800643].  
- The PCSA criteria will determine which patients had at leas t 1 PCSA during the on -
treatment period, taking into account all evaluations performed during the on -treatment 
period, including unscheduled or repeated evaluations. The number of all such patients 
will be the numerator for the on -treatment PCSA percentage .

1. Premenopausal female with 1 of the  following:  
- Documented hysterectomy  
- Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]  
- Documented bilateral oophorectomy.  
2. Postmenopausal  
- A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal 
range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal 
contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 
12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insuffici ent.  
- Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in 
doubt will be required to use [ADDRESS_1105187] discontinue HRT to 
allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrolment.  
Reproductive potential  (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered of reproductive potential (WOCBP), ie, fertile, following menarche and 
until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile. Perman ent sterilization methods 
include hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_15559].  
CONTRACEPTIVE GUIDANCE  
Male subjects  
• Male subjects with heterosexual partners of reproductive potential (WOCBP) are eligible 
to participate if they agree to  use the following during the protocol defined timeline:  
- Refrain from donating sperm  
and 
- At least 1 of the following conditions applies:  
- Are and agree to remain abstinent from penile -vaginal intercourse on a long term 
and persistent basis, when this is th eir preferred and usual lifestyle.

COLLECTION OF PREGNANCY INFORMATION  
Male subjects with partners of reproductive potential who become pregnant  
• The Investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any female partner of 
a male study subject who becomes pregnant  while participating in this study. This applies 
only to subjects who receive study treatment . 
• After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant female partner 
directly, the Investigator will record pregnancy information on the approp riate form and 
submit it to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pregnancy.   
• Partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on 
the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the Sponsor.   
• Generally, follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery 
date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless of fetal status (presence 
or absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure

3. Liver function test (LFT) mo nitoring post infusion is already included in this protocol. 
However, review of the interim data from the clinical development program has identified 
"Transient elevation in transaminases associated with ceramide release during the dose 
escalation phase wi th olipudase alfa" as an important identified risk. Therefore, additional 
recommendations for the management of transaminase elevation during dose escalation 
have been added to the protocol.  
Other important changes include:  
1. The conduct of treatment experience interviews to understand patient’s experience living 
with acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD) and participating in this study has been 
added.  
2. The assessments have been streamlined to reduce patient burden in the extension phase of

process. The different processes  are referred to as  Process  B, 
C( ) and C( ).  
For the switch from Process C( ) IMP to the updated

of: 
For the fifth paragraph related to the “outside the dose 
escalation” the following change has been done:  
• [ADDRESS_1105191] -infusion: vital sign measurements, 
LFTs and hematology tests and safety biomarkers 
and if available during home infusion from the same 
blood sample, clinical chemistry, multiplex assay 
and pharmacodynamic biomarkers  
Addition of:  
Assessment of the transaminases obtained after infusion 
during the dose escalation period; if any AST or ALT value is > 
2x baseline and >ULN, the test should be repeated prior to the 
next scheduled infusion. Depending on the test results, the 
dose can be adjusted (repeated or reduced) or treatment can 
be withheld to allow additional transaminase  monitoring, based 
on the physician’s clinical judgment.  
Baseline is defined as the following:  
• For initial dose escalation: last values prior to first 
dose of olipudase alfa  
• For dose re -escalation: last values prior to the first 
re-escalation dose  The [ADDRESS_1105192] -infusion assessments will no 
longer be assessed after the cutoff date for a 
planned second database lock of the study for 
purpose of regulatory submissions in 2021; 
however, [ADDRESS_1105193] been streamlined to reduce 
patient burden in the extension phase of this trial.  
Given current knowledge about the study drug, 
assays can be replaced by [CONTACT_282187].  
Analysis of ACE through 52 weeks (PAP) of 
treatment has been completed for all patients. Initial 
objective to monitor for changes with treatment 
were achieved; no further longitudi nal analysis is 
required.  
Since the lipid profiles are informative efficacy 
biomarkers, the exploratory NMR of HDL will be 
removed from the protocol. This change is 
harmonized with the ongoing LTS13632 protocol

 In addition, since the primary study comparison is based on intent to treat principle 
using all randomized patients with any study treatment, missing data, especially 
the key study assessments during the PAP (12 months) may potentially lead to 
biased results and challenges in assessing the treatment effect of the study drug. 
Therefore, all efforts sh ould be made to continue to follow the patients for primary 
and key secondary endpoints, after the temporary or permanent discontinuation of 
treatment, in addition to the standard post study safety follow up. If possible, at the 
minimum, patients should be  assessed at their regularly scheduled Week 52 visit

repeated measures (MMRM) will include baseline DLco (% predicted), baseline 
age, treatment arm, study visit (week 26, week 52), and study visit by [CONTACT_800664]; have an unstructured variance -covariance matrix; 
and be fit using restricted maximum likelihood estimation. Comparisons between

of the study regardless of the treatment discontinuation status, with the exception 
that measurements made after the switch of treatment (eg, placebo patients 
switch to olipudase alfa after meeting the res cue criteria) will not be considered. 
For the primary analysis, missing data will not be imputed and will be assumed as 
Missing at Random (MAR).  
Similar analyses will be performed for the spleen volume (MN) and the 
splenomegaly -related symptom score (SRS) , when baseline value of the spleen

Protocol Amendment 10 Version number: 1 (electronic 1.0) Date: 
26-Jan-2018  
This amendment is associated with Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 08.  
Reason for Amendment:  
1. Change in patient selection criteria to remove cirrhosis from Exclusion Criteria  
In section(s) : Clinical Trial summary - Study Population - Main selection Criteria - (Exclusion 
criteria); [IP_ADDRESS] Schedule of assessments: year 1 - PAP screening to Week 16, Selection of 
Patients; 7.2 Exclusion Criteria  
Rationale : Cirrhosis was initially included as an exclusion criterion in olipudase alfa trials based 
on the spectrum of natural history of cirrhosis in ASMD patients.  
Liver biopsies were included in these trials to monitor the potential acceleration of inflammator y 
disease from fibrosis to cirrhosis upon exposure to olipudase alfa, since known biologically active 
intermediates, the direct catabolites of acid sphingomyelin are released upon treatment. This is 
also the key for the dose escalation process applied to a ll trials with olipudase alfa. However, 
unpublished data (on file) available from Year 3 biopsy of the long -term, open -label, treatment 
(extension study LTS13632, of phase 1b DFI13412 study) did not show evidence suggestive of 
a progressive worsening of fi brosis to cirrhosis in patients treated with olipudase alfa (see details 
in the table below).

The DMC is regularly consulted and present ed the updates results of the [ADDRESS_1105221] in April 2015.  
Currently there is one patient treated in the extension study LTS13632 whose liver biopsy fibrosis 
stage is 4 (cirrhosis) with no reported issues.  
As such, [COMPANY_011] Genzyme is proposing to remove the cirrhosis exclusion cr iterion from 
study  DFI12712.  
Removal of the cirrhosis exclusion criterion from this study will not impact the current schedule 
of safety assessments and liver biopsies will continue to be performed at baseline, Week 52, and 
Week [ADDRESS_1105222] to monitor patients’ safety, it is important to evaluate the 
benefit of olipudase alfa in  the population of ASMD patients with grade 4 fibrosis (cirrhosis) as 
part of the disease natural history in absence of safety risk.  
VV-CLIN-0254389 18.0

Amended Clinical Trial Pr otocol 15   01-Nov-2022  
GZ402665 -DFI12712  - olipudase alfa  Version numbe r: [ADDRESS_1105223] increased risk of adverse 
events from liver biopsy pro cedures versus patients without cirrhosis (Seeff et al, Clin 
Gastroenterol Hepatol. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 September 12). Therefore, 
patients diagnosed with cirrhosis during screening liver biopsy will go through the subsequent 
protocol s cheduled liver biopsy assessments at Week 52 and Week 104, unless there is other 
safety concern that can be discussed with the sponsor.  
DMC recommendation on this proposed change:  
This proposed change and rational was presented to DFI12712 DMC as it is pr esented in this 
document.  
DMC chairman and members unanimously approved removing of cirrhosis for exclusion criteria 
for the reasons mentioned above.  
2. Remove liver biopsy from assessments beyond Week 104  
In section(s) : [IP_ADDRESS]  Schedule of assessments: ETP - year 3 until end of study; 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Sphingomyelin in liver tissue  
Rationale : Liver biopsy assessment is scheduled at the main study time points; baseline, Week  52, 
and Week 104. Liver biopsy assessment in these time points is set to follow the changes at 
histopathological and histochemical levels comparing olipudase alfa and placebo in PAP and one 
year thereafter in ETP. Beyond Year 2 assessments, there would be no need for further biopsy 
assessments every year based on the recent long term study results ( LTS13632).  
DMC recommendation on this proposed change:  
This proposed change and rationale was presented to DFI12712 DMC as it is presented in this 
document.  
DMC chairman and members unanimously approved removing of liver biopsy assessments 
beyond Week 104  of study participation for the rational mentioned above.  
3. Change the secondary endpoints hierarchical order  
In section(s) : Clinical Trial summary - (Endpoints); 9.1.2 Efficacy Endpoints; [IP_ADDRESS] Secondary 
Efficacy Analysis; 11.5.4 Multiplicity Considerati ons 
Rationale : SRS is included as a co -primary endpoint for US. For the rest of the world, it is among 
the secondary endpoints. The hypothesis testing for the secondary efficacy endpoints will proceed 
in a hierarchical fashion using the closed testing prin ciple, and will stop if there is a nonsignificant 
comparison.  
The study design was based on clinically important and meaningful change in most of the ASMD 
manifestations. While spleen size is standing as a primary endpoint as an important clinical 
assessm ent, liver size could follow as the next important organ change. Listed thereafter, are the

GZ402665 -DFI12712  - olipudase alfa  Version numbe r: [ADDRESS_1105224] in organ size change.  
It is not expected that SRS change would be significant, but only rather expected to show (as per 
protocol) a “trend” (p  ≤0.15). While a significant change would be expected for liver size change, 
followed by [CONTACT_800665]. These important sig nificant changes should not be missed 
in case SRS is not significant. Therefore, hierarchy is accordingly rearranged.  
4. Clarify language of exclusion criteria  
In section(s) : Clinical Trial summary - Study Population - Main selection Criteria - (Exclusion 
criter ia); 7.2, Exclusion Criteria  
Rationale : correct previous omission of mentioning that cardiac valve dysfunction should be 
clinically significant to have the patient excluded.  
In addition, other minor changes are listed in the description of changes (next s ection).

In section(s): Synopsis: 11, Statistical considerations  
Rationale: Based on discus sions with FDA to include the splenomegaly -related score (SRS) in the 
combination spleen endpoint and to show the results as a “trend” when relevant. Therefore, the 
analysis was changed from truncated Hochberg to Hochberg.  
4. Clarification of time points at which vital signs should be taken  
In section(s): 1.2, Schedules of assessments  
Rationale: Correction of error in the previous version.  
5. Addition of rules on how to resume study drug administration in patients who have 
missed infusion  
In section(s) : 8.1.3. 2, Dosing delays or missed doses  
Rationale: Rules were omitted in the previous protocol version (but were provided in the 
Interactive [Voice or Web] Response System [IXRS] documents).  
6. Change in some of the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) conditions  
In section(s ): 8.1.4, Dose -limiting toxicities; [IP_ADDRESS], Reporting of adverse events of special 
interest with immediate notification  
Rationale : The new rules take into account that patients may enter the study with abnormal liver 
function tests (LFTs) due to their AS MD. As a result, these patients could meet a DLT condition 
due to normal fluctuation in LFTs that would not otherwise be indicative of DLT. The new rules 
have been approved by [CONTACT_1578].  
7. Change in assessments to be done before rescue tr eatment is applied  
In section(s) : 8.1.6, Rescue treatment  
Rationale : Correction of error in the previous version.  
8. Addition of recommendation on usage of cationic amphiphilic antihistamines in rules on 
concomitant medications  
In section(s) : 8.8, Concomitant  medication  
Rationale : These medications are commonly used.

Protocol Amendment 07 Version number: 02 (el ectronic 2.0) Date: 
01-Feb-2016  
This amendment is associated with Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 05 . 
Reasons for the Amendment:  
1. Remove 1.0 mg arm from the primary analysis period (PAP)  
In section(s) : Clinical trial summary (Study design, Statistical considerations), 6.1, [IP_ADDRESS], 8.4, 
11.2, 11.5.4  
Rationale:  The planned number of patients randomized to the 3mg/kg olipudase alfa and placebo 
arms was increased from 14 per arm to 18 per arm. To accommoda te this increase while not 
substantially enlarging the planned sample size, the 1mg/kg olipudase alfa arm was removed from 
the study design. The rationale for this change is to increase the likelihood that a clear 
demonstration of efficacy or lack of effic acy is achieved with respect to the primary and 
secondary efficacy endpoints and to avoid ambiguous results related to underpowered endpoints. 
The assumptions used to determine the sample size for the spleen volume endpoint were informed 
by [CONTACT_800666] m several clinical trials conducted in patients with lysosomal storage disorders 
(ie, Gaucher disease). This is in contrast to the assumptions used to determine the power of the 
other primary endpoint, DLco, and important secondary efficacy endpoints such as splenomegaly -
related symptoms where minimal information was available. In situations where insufficient 
information exists for robust sample size determination, an increase in sample size is warranted.  
While efficacy and safety information from the 1  mg/kg olipudase alfa arm is of interest, it does 
not outweigh the importance of enabling the study to achieve the primary efficacy objective 
should olipudase alfa be as effective as the results from the Phase 1b study suggest. In addition, 
the increase in t he number of patients treated with 3  mg/kg olipudase alfa in the primary analysis 
period and in the extension study will improve the understanding of the safety profile of the dose 
that is intended for use assuming regulatory approval.  
2. Remove 1.0 mg arm fr om the extended treatment period (ETP)  
In section(s) : Clinical trial summary (Study design, Statistical considerations), 6.1, [IP_ADDRESS], 8.4, 
11.2, 11.5.4  
Rationale: To maintain consistency with the PAP  
3. Remove “dose comparison.”

GZ402665 -DFI12712  - olipudase alfa  Version numbe r: 1 
Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential  Page 164 Rationale:  The 1.0 mg arm is no longer part of the study and hence the study is no longer designed 
to compare doses.  
4. Remove “of different doses.”  
In section(s) : Clinical trial summary (Study objectives, Primary objective), 5.1  
Rationale:  The 1.0 mg arm is no longer part of the study  
5. Change randomization ratio from 2:1:2 to 1:1 during the PAP.  
In section(s) : Clinical trial summary (Statistical considerations [sample size determination]), 6.1, 
8.4, 11.2  
Rationale:  Removing the 1 mg/kg arm in the PAP resulted in a necessary change in the 
randomization to 1:1. During the 4 year ETP, all patients will receive olipudase alfa.  
6. Add inclusion criterion for mean splenomegaly -related symptoms score  
In section(s) : Clinical trial summary (Study population [Inclusion criteria]), 7.1  
Rationale:  To increase the statistical power of the evaluation of the secondary endpoint, “Change 
in splenomegaly -related symptom score from baseline to week 52”.  
7. Add contraception requirements fol lowing the last olipudase alfa infusion.  
In section(s) : Clinical trial summary (Study population, Main selection criteria, Inclusion criteria), 
7.1, 10.3  
Rationale:  Conventionally, true abstinence or contraception is required during the treatment 
period an d following the last administration for at least [ADDRESS_1105227]’s 
half-life. Based upon the [ADDRESS_1105228] infusion. To be c onservative, the period of time that 
each patient will be required to either practice true abstinence or use 2  acceptable, effective 
methods of contraception was expanded to include 15  days after the patient’s last olipudase alfa 
infusion.  
8. Clarify that the  longest study duration per patient will be for at least 3 years and up to 
5 years and 3 months dependent upon continued regulatory approval of the protocol.  
In section(s) : Clinical trial summary (Duration of study period [per patient]), 6.2.1  
Rationale : Previous text can be interpreted as allowing patients to be in the study for only 3 years, 
so clarification was added.

Rationale:  An interim analysis was initially planned for when [ADDRESS_1105229] benefit risk determination, it was decided that 
an interim analysis strategy was not justified.  
10. Clarify patient stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_800584](s) : 8.1.5  
Rationale:  The role of the DMC in an emergency is to review safety data and recommend 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_282130]. However, this does not limit the ability of 
investigators to make an immediate decision to discontinue dosing in an indivi dual patient due to 
an any AE that raises significant concern regarding the safety of olipudase alfa, as described in 
Section 8.1.4 of the protocol.

In section(s) : Section 1.2.3  
Rationale : A PK sampling at 168  hours postinfusion has been added to more fully characterize 
AUC.  
• Increase the number of enrolled patients from approximately 24 to approximately 35  
In section(s) : Clinical trial summary, Section 1.1.1, Section 6.1, Section 8.4, Section 11.2  
Rationale : The sample size was increased to provide the power necessary to see a treatment effect 
for the DLCO primary endpoint  
- Remove the 0.3 mg/kg treatment arm.  
- Randomization ratio in the PAP changed from 1:1:1:1 (placebo, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0 mg/kg 
olipudase alfa) to 2:1: 2 (placebo, 1.0 mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg olipudase alfa)  
- Remove patient stratification by [CONTACT_800670]  
• Remove requirement to stratify patients based on baseline spleen volume  
In section(s) : Clinical trial summary, Section 6.1, Section 6.3, Section 8.4, S ection [IP_ADDRESS], 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]  
Rationale : Simplify statistical calculations.  
• Patients assigned to the placebo arm in the PAP will be rerandomized 1:1 in the ETP to 
1.0 mg/kg or 3.0 mg/kg olipudase alfa.  
In section(s) : Clinical trial summary, Section 1.1 .2, Section 6.1  
Rationale : To more fully characterize the safety and efficacy of the 1.0 mg/kg olipudase alfa dose.  
- Remove the olipudase alfa target dose selection in the ETP  
• Add an interim analysis of the primary endpoint after approximately 20 patients 
complete 52 weeks of treatment with study drug

This amendment is related to Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 01.  
• Modification of study title  
In section(s) : Title page; Synopsis; page headers.  
Rationale : The protocol title has been changed to reflect the new study design and objectives.  
• Modification of study organization  
In section(s) : All sections  
Rationale :  
- The 1 treatment period of 52 weeks in the original protocol has been increased to 
2 treatment periods in the amended protocol: a primary analysis period (PAP) of 52 weeks, 
which will be followed by [CONTACT_800671] (ETP) lasting for total study 
duration of up to 5 years.  
- The dose e scalation scheme has been updated to include a second 0.6 mg/kg dose to 
mitigate possible toxicity from sphingomyelin degradation that occurs too quickly. In the 
phase 1b study, DFI13412, infusion -associated reactions were more frequent when starting 
this dose and required dose -repetition or dose -reduction at next scheduled study infusions 
of higher doses. Accordingly, patients randomized to the 3.0 mg/kg treatment arm will not 
be fully dose escalated until study week 16. Consequently, study procedures sche duled for 
the week [ADDRESS_1105234] been shifted to week 14.  
- In the original protocol, patients were to be randomized to a target dose 0.3, 1.0, or 
3.0 mg/kg rhASM after the second 0.3 mg/kg infusion. In the amended protocol, patients 
will be random ized before the patient’s first infusion with study drug.  
• Modification of study design  
In section(s) : All sections  
Rationale : All sections have been updated to the new study design.  
- The original protocol was open -label. The amended protocol is double -blinded during the 
entire primary analysis period and initially during the extended treatment period.  
- The original protocol did not include a placebo arm and was to enroll at least 15 patients 
1:1:1 into 1 of 3 treatment arms: 0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 mg/kg  rhASM. The number of patients in 
the amended protocol has increased to approximately 24 patients who will be equally 
randomized to placebo, 0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 mg/kg rhASM.  
- The original protocol did not have a crossover feature. In the amended protocol, pati ents 
randomized to the placebo arm during the PAP will crossover to the 3.0 mg/kg treatment 
arm during the ETP.  
- Patients will be stratified based on baseline spleen volume into 1 of 2 groups before 
randomization in the amended protocol.  
- Rescue criteria hav e been included for patients who experience clinical decline.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential  Page 171 • Modification of study objectives  
In section(s) : tabulated clinical trial summary, Section 5 of the protocol  
Rationale : The primary objective has been changed to an efficacy objective. A key seco ndary 
objective has been added.  
• Changes to the assessments  
In section(s) : Section 1.2, Section 5, Section 9  
Rationale : Because no serious adverse events or adverse events with severe intensity were 
observed in a prior clinical trial (DFI13412), the intensi ve monitoring for safety has been reduced. 
Other assessments have been added and those not relevant to characterizing the effect of study 
drug treatment based on past experience have been eliminated:  
- The time spent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_800588] -patient was reduced from [ADDRESS_1105235] been added: Chronic 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_6015] - Self Administered - Standard Activitie s, Health -related 
productivity questionnaire, Short Form -[ADDRESS_1105236] a cycle ergometer.

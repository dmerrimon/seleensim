to Compare Both Active Treatments to a Vehicle Control in the Treatment of 
Secondarily Infected Traumatic Skin Lesions  
Study Period:  17 days  
Study Medication:  1. Mupi[INVESTIGATOR_258805], 2% , Perrigo  [LOCATION_006] FINCO  Limited Partnership , 
 
2. Mupi[INVESTIGATOR_258805], 2% , manufactured by [CONTACT_258822]  
3. Vehicle of test product, Perrigo [LOCATION_006] FINCO  Limited Partnership , 
 
Study Objectives:  To compare the safety and efficacy profiles of Perrigo [LOCATION_006] FINCO Limited 
Partnership’s  Mupi[INVESTIGATOR_258805], 2%  to Glenmark Pharmaceuticals  
Mupi[INVESTIGATOR_258805], 2% , and to demonstrate the superior efficacy of the 
two active formulations over that  of the vehi cle in the treatment of subjects 
with secondarily infected traumatic skin lesions . 
Study Design:  Subjects in this multi -center, double -blind, randomized, vehicle -controlled, 
parallel -group study will be admitted into the study only  after written 
informed consent/ assent (as applicable) has been obtained and after all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria have been met. Male and female subjects 
18 months or older , with a secondarily infected traumatic skin lesion such as 
a laceration, sutured wound, or abrasion  will be eligible for enrollment.  
Study Population:  Approximately  subjects  who meet the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, will be enrolled to obtain approximately  
 modified -Intent -To-Treat (mITT) and  
 per-protocol (PP) subjects.  
Dosing:  Subjects will be randomized  to the test product, reference 
product , or vehicle treatment group, and will apply   the study 
medication to the secondarily infected target lesion  3 times  daily for 1 0 days .  
Study Visits:  Clinical Evaluations will be performed at:  
1. Visit 1/Day 1 (Baseline)  
2. Visit 2/Day 3  (During treatment ) 
3. Visit 3/Day 10  (End of treatment ) 
4. Visit 4/Day 17  (Follow -up/Earl y Termination ) 
 
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_258823].  
Evaluations:  To evaluate the clinical response, t he Skin Infection Rating Scale (SIRS) will be 
used by [CONTACT_258824]/pus, crusting, 
erythema/inflammation, tissue warmth  and tissue edema , and by [CONTACT_258825]. Bacteriological response will also be 
assessed.

 Endpoints:  The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects in each treatment 
group with clinical cure, defined as a SIRS score of zero “ 0” or absent  for all 
signs and symptoms at Visit 4/Day 17 follow -up visit (7 days after the end of 
treatment).  
 
Secondary efficacy endpoints are the proportion of subjects with clinical cure 
at Visit 3/Day 10 (End of Treatment), bacteriological cure (defined as 
elimination of S. aureus  and S. pyogenes  or response was such that no culture 
material was available and t herefore evidence of pathogen eradication) at 
Visit 3/ Day 10 ( End of Treatment ), and bacteriological cure at Visit  4/Day 17 
(Follow -up).  
Safety:  The incidence of all adverse events reported during the study will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. Test and  reference product will be 
compared for safety by [CONTACT_258826], severity and frequency of treatment

To compare the safety and efficacy profiles of Perrigo [LOCATION_006] FINCO Limited Partnership’s  Mupi[INVESTIGATOR_258806], 2%  to Glenmark Pharmaceuticals  Mupi[INVESTIGATOR_258805], 2% , and to demonstrate the 
superior efficacy of the two active formulations over that of the vehicle in the treatment of 
subjects with secondarily infected traumatic skin lesions . 
 
2.1 Endpoints  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects in each treatment group with clinical 
cure, defined as a Skin Infection Rating Scale (SIRS) score of zero “ 0” or absent  for all signs and 
symptoms at Visit  4/Day 17 follow -up visit (7 days after t he end of treatment).  
 
Secondary efficacy endpoints are the proportion of subjects with clinical cure at Visit 3/ Day 10 (End 
of Treatment ), bacteriological cure (defined as elimination of S. aureus  and S. pyogenes  or response 
was such that no culture material was available and therefore evidence of pathogen eradication) at 
Visit 3/ Day 10 ( End of Treatment ), and bacteriological cure at Visit 4/ Day 17 ( Follow -up).

3. STUDY DESIGN  
 
3.1 Type/Design o f Study  
Subjects in this multi -center, double -blind, randomized, vehicle -controlled, parallel -group study will 
be assigned  to test product, reference product, or vehicle, respectively .  Subjects will 
apply  the assigned study medication topi[INVESTIGATOR_258807] 3 times per day for 10 consecutive days.  
 
Subjects will be males and females, 18 months or older, with a  secondarily infected traumatic skin 
lesion such as a laceration, sutured wound, or abrasion. Visits to the study site are scheduled at Day 
1 (screening/ baseline ), Day 3 (during treatment) , Day 10  (end of treatment) , and Day 17  (follow -up). 
 
At Visit 1/Screening/Baseline informed consent will be obtained.  The subject’s medical history will 
be recorded along with concomitant medications.  A urine pregnancy test will be performed for 
women of childbearing potential.  A brief physical examinatio n will be performed. The diagnosis  of a 
secondarily infected traumatic  skin lesion will be confirmed.   The dimensions of the  secondarily 
infected target lesion will be measured , location will be documented , and the Subject’s Skin Infection 
Rating Scale (SIRS)  total  score of the  secondarily infected  target lesion will be evaluated and 
recorded.  A specimen for culture will be prepared from exudates collected from the secondarily 
infected target lesion and a slide will be prepared for Wright stain/Gr am stain.  Subjects who meet 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will be dispensed study medication and the site staff will instruct the 
subject on medication application and completion of subject diar y.  The first application of study 
medication will be made at the site under supervision of site staff .  
Subjects will return to the office for Visit 2/During Treatment (Day 3  ), Visit 3/End of 
Treatment (Day 10  ) and Visit 4/Follow -up (Day 17  ).  During each visit, SIRS total 
score of  the secondarily infected target lesion will be completed , the subject’s concomitant 
medications will be reviewed , and a ny adverse events will be recorded.  Subjects will return at each 
appropriate visit with study med ication and their Subject Diary.   
  At Visit 3/End of Treatment  
 all study medication will be collected.   At Visit 3/End of Treatment  and 
Visit 4/Follow -up , bacteriological samples for culture will be obtained.  
If it is necessary to see a subject other than at a scheduled visit date, the Unscheduled Visit 
procedures will be followed  (Sections 5.11 and 5.12) .  If the investigator decides to discontinue a 
subject at any time during the study, a standard of care treatment may be advised at the 
Investigator’s discretion, and an Early Termination  Visit may be performed for this purpose.  If the 
investigator discon tinues a subject due to a negative baseline culture, the procedures for the 
Negative Baseline Culture Discontinuation Visit  (Sections 5.11 and 5.12)  should be performed.  
Early Observation of Subjects : At Visit 2/Day [ADDRESS_314550] from the study and prescr ibe appropriate  approved  treatment (e.g. Mupi[INVESTIGATOR_258808], 2%  or oral therapy) or refer the subject to another physician.  This treatment may be topi[INVESTIGATOR_258809]: PRG -NY-19-002

• Negative baseline culture . 
• The subject withdraws his or her consent for any reason.  
• The subject’s condition has worsened to the degree that the investigator feels it is unsafe for the 
subject to continue in the study  or requires an alternative therapy  for the treatment of their 
secondarily infected traumatic skin lesion . 
• The subject’s medication code is unblinded.  
• The s ubject did not meet or no longer meets the entry criteria.  
• An adverse event , including intercurrent illness, occurs for which the subject desires to 
discontinue treatment or the investigator determines that it is in the subject’s best inter est to be 
discontinued.  
• A concomitant therapy is reported or required that may interfere with the results of the study.  
• The subject is lost to follow -up. The investigator will document efforts to attempt to reach the 
subject twice by [CONTACT_258834] d a certified follow -up letter before considering that 
subject lost to follow -up. All attempts must be thoroughly recorded.  
• The subject becomes pregnant during the course of the trial.  
• A lack of treatment response,  
 
• Investigator discretion  (e.g., non -compliant with  study protocol requirements).  
 
After a subject has been discontinued, he/she will not be allowed to re -enroll in the study  at an y 
facility .  
 
The reasons for a subject being discontinued will be documented in the eCRFs and the enrollment 
log. 
 
If a subject is discontinued f rom the study for any reason, the Visit 4 /Day 17 (End of Study Visit/Early 
Term ination Visit ) procedures should be completed and any outstanding data and study medication 
should be collected.  Data, in addition to the reason for discontinuation and the date of removal, will 
be recorded on the Source Document and End of Study eCRF . 
 
If a subject disco ntinues from the study at any time due to an adverse event, the reason for 
discontinuation, the nature of the event , and its clinical course must be fully documented.   For such 
a subject, the investigator must strive to follow the subject until the adverse event has resolved, 
become clinically insignificant, is stabilized, or the subject is lost to follow -up.

LABELS SHOULD NOT  BE REMOVED FROM THE  SITE UNTIL PERRIGO HAS NOTIFIED THE SITES , IN WRITING . 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Retention Samples  
Each investigational site where study medication is dispensed to at least one subject will be required 
to randomly select one block of study medication  to be 
maintained as retain samples.  The investigator will mainta in one randomly selected block of study 
medication from each shipment  of study medication received. As per the Code of Federal Regulations 
Part 21, Section 320.38(e), “Each reserve sample shall be stored under conditions consistent with 
product labeling an d in an area segregated from the area where testing is conducted and with access 
limited to authorized personnel  (stored between 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F). ; even after the study has 
concluded .  Each reserve sample shall be retained for a period of at least five ( 5) years following the 
date on which the application or supplemental application is approved, or, if such application or 
supplemental application is not approved, at least five ( 5) years following the date of completion of 
the bioavailability study in which the sample from which the reserve sample was obtained  or was  
used.”  The investigator will store the retain sample study medication until such time as written 
notification is received f rom Perrigo that the samples are no longer required.  
 
Storage and Test Article Accountability  
Study articles used to conduct this study will be maintained under adequate security by [CONTACT_1294] .  Each investigator site will ensure that the temperature of study medication 
is monitored and recorded throughout the study.  The study medication should be  stored between 
20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F)  and should not be frozen, as recommended in the labeling fo r Mupi[INVESTIGATOR_258806], 2% .  The medication should be kept away from children  unless the subject is a child .  The 
investigator will not supply study medication to any person not enrolled in this study, or to any 
physician or scientist except those named as sub-investigators.  
 
The clinic personnel  at each investigator site  will keep a running inventory of study medication 
dispensed that will include subject numbers assigned and the date each  tube  of study medication  is 
dispensed and returned .  A study medication accountability form will be provided to the investigator 
to document all medications received, dispensed by [CONTACT_258835].   At the conclusion of 
the study all unused, partially used, and empty tubes  must be inventoried by [CONTACT_258836], or designee, for destruction , with the exception of retention samples which shall 
remain at the investigator site .

Procedure for Breaking the Blind  
The investigator, staff at the study site, study monitors, and data analysis/management personnel 
are blinded to the subject assignment.   In the event of an emergency, the specific subject treatment 
may be identified by [CONTACT_258837], which is attached to the study medication log; however, every effort should be made to maintain 
the blind.  The investigator must not scratch off the occluding layer of the label unless absolutely 
necessary to provide medical treatment to a subject in an emergency situation  only and should 
seek prior authorization by [CONTACT_258838].   The reason for breaking the blind 
must be clearly documented in the source documentation and eCRF and the subject must be 
discontinued from the study. Perrigo must be notified immediately upon all unblinding situations.  
 
7. ADVERSE REACTIONS  
The potential adver se reactions of generic  Mupi[INVESTIGATOR_258805], 2% , are anticipated to be similar 
to those observed with  Mupi[INVESTIGATOR_258805], 2% .   
 
The adverse reactions reported by [CONTACT_2669] 1% of 339 subjects in connection with the use of Mupi[INVESTIGATOR_258806], 2%  in clinica l trials  were  headache (1.7%), rash (1.1%), and nausea (1.1%).   Adverse 
reactions that occurred in less than 1% of subjects were abdominal pain, burning at application site, 
cellulitis, dermatitis, dizziness, pruritus, secondary wound infection, and ulcerative stomatitis.  
 
Systemic allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, urticaria, angio edema, and generalized rash , have 
been identified during postmarketing use of Mupi[INVESTIGATOR_258805], 2% . Because they are reported 
voluntarily from a population of unknown size, estimates of frequency cannot be made.  
 
Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhe a (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial 
agents and may range in severity from the mild diarrhea to fatal colitis.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_314571] the Medical Monitor or Perrigo by [CONTACT_258839] -up with a written description as 
soon as possible.  The o verseeing IRB should also be notified.  
 
7.2 Definitions  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a 
medicinal product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this 

Protocol  No: PRG -NY-19-002 
 
Page 27 of 45 
 
 treatment.   An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (for example, 
an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product, whether or not considered related to this medicinal product.  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE)  is an adverse event that results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening event (e. g., the subject was, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], at immediate 
risk of death from the event as it occurred. It does not include an event that, had it  occurred 
in a more severe form, might have caused death ) 
• Requires in-subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34908]  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions  
• Congenital  anomaly/birth defect  
• Other adverse events that may be considered serious based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above . 
 
Immediately Reportable Adverse Events (IRAE):  Any serious AE or any AE that necessitates 
discontinuation of study medication, including pregnancy.  
 
Unexpected Adverse Event : An unexpected event  is any adverse drug experience, the specificity or 
severity of which is no t consistent with the current approved product labeling (package insert) for 
the study medication, the Investigator’s Brochure, or as described in the clinical protocol and consent 
materials.  
 
Intensity of Adverse Events : The maximum intensity of an AE du ring a day should be recorded on the 
eCRF. If the intensity of an AE changes over a number of days, then separate entries should be made 
having distinct onset dates for the changes in severity.  
 
Mild - AEs are usually transient, requiring no special treatm ent, and do not interfere with 
subject’s daily activities.  
 
Moderate - AEs typi[INVESTIGATOR_258812] a low level of inconvenience or concern to the subject and 
may interfere with daily activities, but are usually ameliorated by [CONTACT_14212].  
 
Seve re - AEs interrupt a subject’s usual daily activity and traditionally require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment.  
 
Causal Relationship to Study Medication:  The following criteria should be used in assessing the 
apparent causal relationship of an AE to study medication.  
 
Definitely - The AE:  
• follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study medication administration  
• abates upon discontinuation of the study m edication (dechallenge)  

Protocol  No: PRG -NY-19-002 
 
Page 28 of 45 
 
 • is confirmed by [CONTACT_258840] - The AE:  
• follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study medication administration  
• abates upon discontinuation of the study medication (dechallenge)  
• cannot  be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s state.  
 
Possible - The AE:  
• follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study medication administration  
• but that could readily be produced by a number of other factors . 
 
Unlikely - The A E: 
• follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study medication administration.  
• could have been produced by [CONTACT_258841]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_258842].  
 
Not related - The AE:  
• does not have a reasonable temporal association with the administration of study 
medication  
• has some other obvious explanation for the event.  
 
7.3 Eliciting and Reporting of Adverse Events  
The investigator will periodically assess subjects for the occurrence of adverse events.   
 
 
 All adverse events (as defined in Section 7.2),  either observed by [CONTACT_258843]/her medical collaborators, or reported by [CONTACT_258844], or in response 
to direct questioning, will be reported and documented in the source document and the study 
reporting forms.   When reporting an adverse event, the investigato r must assign a severity grade to 
each event and declare an opi[INVESTIGATOR_258813].  Serious or unexpected adverse events must be reported to  within [ADDRESS_314572] assessment visit (or the early termination visit) 
must be recorded on the AE eCRF with the status of the AE noted.  
 
Adverse event reporting begins from the signing of informed consent/assent. Adverse events  should 
be followed until resolved or [ADDRESS_314573] be followed by [CONTACT_258845] y become resolved or are considered to be chronic 
(stabilized for at least 30 days).  All events that are ongoing at this time will be recorded as ongoing 
on the eCRF.  
 

Protocol  No: PRG -NY-19-[ADDRESS_314574] report for submission to Perrigo.  The adverse event term on 
the AE eCRF  and the S AE report should agree exactly. Special attention should be given to recording 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_258814].   
 
Subjects with unresolved adverse event(s) or serious adverse event(s) should be followed by [CONTACT_258846] e resolved, events determined to be chronic , or the subject is lost to 
follow -up.  Resolution means the subject has returned to the baseline state of health, or the 
investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the adverse event.  The 
investigator should continue to report any significant follow -up information to the sponsor up to the 
point that the event has resolved.  Any serious adverse event reported by [CONTACT_258847] [ADDRESS_314575] learns of the occurrence of the event.   
 
When reporting a n SAE the investigator (or the Study Coordinator) will promptly report any serious 
adverse event or pregnancy by [CONTACT_258848].  An SAE form should be 
completed and sent by [CONTACT_6791], email, or overnight courier to  within 24 hours of knowledge of 
the event by [CONTACT_779]. In many cases, only prel iminary information will be available.   Appropriate 
follow -up information should be sought (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8838], operative reports , etc.) and 
a follow -up SAE report form submitted.  A designation of causality from the study medication should 
alway s be included with a follow -up report. Assess and report the causality of the event.  
 
Submitting an Expedited Safety Report to the IRB  
Once  receives all supporting documentation for the reported event, the Medical Monitor, in 
conjunction with Perrig o, will determine if the safety report is eligible for expedited review.   
will log the initial event and will notify the sponsor that an event has been reported within 1  business 
day after initial receipt.   will complete the review of the eve nt.  This form, as well as other 
supporting documentation, will be forwarded to  Medical Monitor for review.   will 
finalize the report and distribute it to the sponsor within 1 day (one) after initial receipt.   When 
expedited safety reportin g to regulatory authorities is indeed required, the investigator should 
review and update any newly available materials at once. Follow -up queries may be sent to the study 
center to further clarify the event.  
 
Each expedited safety report will routinely include a brief cover memorandum, the completed 
report, and any additional pertinent information recommended by , Perrigo, or the study 
Medical Monitor.  Once the report is assembled, the Principal Investig ator must submit the expedited 
safety report to the IRB within the required reporting timeframe.  Follow -up reports should be 
submitted when requested or when pertinent information becomes available.  
 

Protocol  No: PRG -NY-19-[ADDRESS_314576] be promptly 
submitted to the study center’s IRB.  The Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_119072] a copy of such reports as 
submitted to his/her  IRB in the site’s study Regulatory Binder.  
 
7.4 SAE & AEs Requiring Discontinuation of Study Drug, including Pregnancies  
ANY SAE  THAT  OCCURS AFTER A SUBJECT HAS ENTERED THE STUDY, WHETHER OR NOT RELAT ED TO 
STUDY MEDICATION, MUST BE REPORTED TO  IMMEDIATELY (WITHIN 24  HOURS) VIA 
TELEPHONE OR FACSIMILE. IF INITIALLY REPORTED VIA TELEPHONE, THIS MUST BE FOLLOWED -UP 
BY A FACSIMILE OF THE WRITTEN SAE REPORT WITHIN 24 HOURS OF THE CALL TO .  
 
Non -serious events  that require discontinuation  of study medication (including laboratory 
abnormalities) should be reported to  immediately and within [ADDRESS_314577] who experiences a severe adverse ev ent related to study drug will be discontinued from 
the study.  
 
The notification about any serious adverse event should be directed to:

7.5 Pregnancy  
At the time the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_258815] a study participant 
became pregnant during  study participation, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_258816] t he 
pregnancy immediately by [CONTACT_17084]/or by [CONTACT_29658] a completed P regnancy Report to  within 
1 business  day of being notified of the pregnancy report.  
 
The report  will include the following elements:  
• Participant (mother’s) coded study identifier;  
• Date of participant’s last menstrual period;  
• Total accumulated dose of study treatment administered to date;  
• Date of study medication administration.  
 
The investigator will follow the subject until completion of the pregnancy and must assess the 
outcome in the shortest possible time but not more than [ADDRESS_314578] a follow -
up Pregnancy Report with any relevant information on the present condition of the fetus to the 
, including:  
• Mother’s coded study identifier(s);  
• Gesta tional age at delivery, miscarriage or abortion;  
• Birth weight, gender, length and head circumference, if available;  
• Apgar scores recorded after birth, if available;  
• Any abnormalities.  
 
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classi fication of an SAE  (e.g., 
spontaneous or therapeutic abortion [any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be 
documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the investigator will report the 
event by [CONTACT_80381] a com pleted SAE report form to  within [ADDRESS_314579] -delivery.  Upon awareness of 
the pregnancy outcome and known status of the infant following 8 weeks of delivery, the investigator 
will complete the applicable pregnancy report forms and fax to  within 1 day of being notified.   
 

Protocol  No: PRG -NY-19-[ADDRESS_314580] assessment visit (or the early termination visit) must be 
recorded on the AE eCRF with the status of the AE noted.  These adverse events must be followed 
by [CONTACT_1374], even ts determined to be chronic or the subject is 
lost to follow -up.  Resolution means the subject has returned to the baseline state of health or the 
investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the adverse event.  
 
Serious Adverse Even ts 
Serious adverse events that are identified on the last assessment visit (or the early termination visit) 
must be recorded on the AE eCRF page and reported to Perrigo according to the procedures outlined 
above.  Subjects with unresolved previously reported serious adverse events, or any new serious 
adverse events identified on the last assessment visit, should be followed by [CONTACT_118297], or the subject is lost to follow -up.  Resolution means the subject has 
returned to the baseline state of health or the investigator does not expect any further improvement 
or worsening of the adverse event.  The investigator should continue to report any significant follow -
up information to Perrigo up to the point that the event has resolved .  Any serious adverse event 
reported by [CONTACT_258849], should be reported 
to Perrigo.  
 
8. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
The sections that follow highlight sample size determination and the planned analyses for this study. 
A statist ical analysis plan (SAP) that describes  the statistical methods, models, hypotheses , and 
subject populations to be analyzed  will be prepared separately from this protocol .  The SAP will be 
completed and approved before locking the database and unblinding t he study and will serve as a 
companion to the protocol and the de facto  documentation of the proposed statistical evaluation. 
The SAP will be completed and finalized prior to breaking the blind.  
 
8.1 Statistical Methods  
 
Analysis Populations  
The following popu lations are defined for the purpose of analyses:  
 
• Intent -to-Treat (ITT)  (safety population) : Any subject who  was randomized , received and used 
study medication.   
 
• Modified Intent -to-Treat  (mITT) : Any subject who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria  
(including a positive baseline bacteriological culture) , was randomized, received and used the 
study medication, and returned for at least one post -baseline efficacy assessment.  
 
• Per Protocol  (PP): Any subject  who : 
• met inclusio n/exclusion criteria  (including a positive baseline bacteriological culture) ,

Efficacy Measures and Analysis  
Clinical Endpoints  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects in each treatment group with clinical 
cure, defined as a SIRS score  of 0 for all signs and symptoms at Visit  4/Follow -up (7 days after the 
end of treatment).   Secondary efficacy endpoints are the proportion of subjects with clinical cure at 
Visit 3/End of Treatment, bacteriological cure (defined as elimination of S. aureu s and S. pyogenes  or 
response was such that no culture material was available and therefore evidence of pathogen 
eradication) at Visit 3/End of Treatment, and bacteriological cure at Visit 4/Follow -up. 
 
Equivalent efficacy  
The clinical equivalence of the test and reference treatments will be based on the proportions of 
subjects with clinical cure at Visit 4/Day 17  (Follow -up, 7 days after end of treatment).  
 
The hypothesis tested for clinical equivalence between test and reference will be:  
H0: pT - pR < -0.20 or p T - pR > 0.20 versus  
HA: -0.20 ≤ p T – pR ≤ 0.20.  
Where p T and p R were the proportions of subjects with clinical cure at Visit 4/Day [ADDRESS_314581] if the 90% confidence interval (CI) of the difference between their 
proportions of subjects with clinical cure , calculated by [CONTACT_258850]’s method with Yates’ continuity 
correction, is contained within the limits -20.0% to +20.0%. Rejection of the null hypothesis would 
support the conclusion of therapeutic equivalence between the Test and Reference products for the 
prima ry efficacy variable.  
 
Analysis  in the PP population will be considered definitive and those in  the mITT population will be 
considered supportive.  
 
Superiority  
The test of superiority of each active treatment over vehicle will be based on the proportions of 
subjects in each treatment group with clinical cure at the Visit 4/Day 17    
 

Protocol  No: PRG -NY-19-[ADDRESS_314582] and reference products over Vehicle w ill be :  
H0: pT ≤ p V versus H A: pT > p V  
H0: pR ≤ p V versus H A: pR > p V 
Where p T, pR, and p V are the proportions of subjects with clinical cure at the Visit 4/Day [ADDRESS_314583] using  two-sided, α  = 0.05, continuity -corrected Z -tests. 
Superiority would be established if the proportion of subjects with clinical cure at the Visit 4/Day17  
in the active treatment group is significantly greater  (p < 0.05) than that in the Vehicle group. 
Rejection of the null hypothesis would support the conclusion of superiority of the Test and 
Reference products over the Vehicle for the primary efficacy variable.  
 
Superiority analyses in the mITT  population will be considered definitive and those in the PP 
population will be  
considered supportive . 
 
The same tests/methods , including the missing data imputation methods, as for the primary analyses 
will be conducted  for the secondary analyses .  
 
Safe ty and Adverse Events Analysis  
The frequency and percent of subjects with adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_258851].   
.  The comparable safety of the Test and Reference treatments will be evaluated 
by [CONTACT_258852].  Safety 
comparisons will be performed on the ITT ( safety ) population . 
 
8.[ADDRESS_314584] baseline characteristics. The 
significance of any obvious treatment group differences will be discussed in the clinical study report . 
 
9. CONSENT/A SSENT CONSIDERATIONS AND PROCEDURES  
It will be made clear to the subject that, for the purposes of the study, they are consenting only for 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_258817].  Investigators may discuss the availability of the study 
and the possibility for entry with a potential subje ct without first obtaining consent/assent.   
However, informed consent/assent must be obtained and documented prior to initiation of any 
procedures that are performed solely for the purpose of determining eligibility for research, 
including withdrawal from current medication(s).  When this is done in anticipation of, or in 
preparation for, the research, it is considered to be part of the research.  
 
The study must be approved in writing by [CONTACT_258853]. A copy 
of the Letter  of Approval from the IRB, which also contains specific identification of the documents 
approved, must be received by [CONTACT_258833], prior to study commencement.  

Protocol  No: PRG -NY-19-[ADDRESS_314585] annually as required by [CONTACT_779]’s IR B, 
as well as notification of completion of the study and a final report within three months of study 
completion or termination.  
 
The investigator(s) has both ethical and legal responsibility to ensure that each subject being 
considered for inclusion in t his study is given a full explanation of the protocol.  This shall be 
documented on a written informed consent/assent form, which shall be approved by [CONTACT_258854].   Each informed consent/assent form shall include the 
elements required by [CONTACT_235794] 21 CFR Part 50. The investigator agrees to obtain approval 
from Perrigo of any written informed consent/assent form used in the study, preferably prior to 
submission to the IRB.  
 
Once the appropriate essential in formation has been provided to the subject and fully explained by 
[CONTACT_473] (or a qualified designee) and it is felt that the subject understands the implications 
of participating, the IRB -approved written informed consent/assent form shall be sign ed by [CONTACT_1560] (or their parent/legally authorized representative) and the person obtaining consent/assent 
(investigator or designee).  The subject shall be given a copy of the signed informed consent/assent 
form and the investigator shall keep the original on file.  
 
If the subject fails to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria at the conclusion of the screening phase, 
the subject will be withdrawn from screening.   If the subject is re -screened for study participation, a 
new informed consent/assent f orm must be signed.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_314586]’s privacy and, therefore, all subject data will 
be identified only by a subject identification number and subject initials.   However, in compliance 
with federal guidelines regarding the monitoring of clinical studies and in fulfillment of his/her 
obligations to Perrigo, it is required that the investigator permit the study monitor, any Perrigo 
authorized representative, and/or FDA representative to review that portion of the subject’s medical 
record that is directly related to the study.  This shall include all study -relevant documentation 
including subject medical histories to verify eligibility, laboratory test result reports to verify 
transcription accur acy, admission/discharge summaries for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_258818] , and autopsy reports for deaths occurring during the study.  
 
As part of the required content of informed consent, the subject must be informed that h is/her 
medical chart may be reviewed by [CONTACT_258855], or a representative of 
the FDA.  If access to the medical record require s a separate waiver or authorization, it is the 
investigator’s responsibility to obtain such permiss ion from the subject in writing before the subject 
is entered into the study.  
 
To preserve the subject's confidentiality, the data collected will be available only to the investigators 
of the study, their support staff, Perrigo or their authorized represen tative and possibly the FDA.  
 

Protocol  No: PRG -NY-19-[ADDRESS_314587]’s initials and by [CONTACT_49252].  The investigator agrees to furnish Perrigo with 
complete subject identif ication, if necessary , on a confidential follow -up form  that will be used for 
the purpose of a long -term follow -up, if needed.  This will be treated with strict adherence to 
professional standards of confidentiality and will be filed at Perrigo under adequ ate security and 
restricted accessibility.  
 
10. CONDUCT OF STUDY  
The investigational site is to maintain complete documentation of all events and the times at which 
they occur.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_314588] be mutually agreed upon in writing by [CONTACT_258856] . 
 
10.2 Protocol Amendments  
The investigator will not make any changes to this protocol without prior written consent from 
Perrigo and subsequent approval by [CONTACT_1201].  Any permanent change to the protocol, whether it is 
an overall change or a change for specific study center(s), must be handled as a protocol amendment. 
Any amendment to the protocol t hat appears indicated as the study progresses will be fully discussed 
between  and Perrigo.  If agreement is reached regarding the need for an amendment, 
the amendment will be written by [CONTACT_258857] .  The written amendment must be submitted 
to the chairman of the IRB identified with this responsibility.   Except for “administrative 
amendments, ” investigators must await IRB approval of protocol amendments before implementing 
the change(s).   Administrative amendments are defined to hav e no effect on the safety of the 
research subjects, scope of the investigation, or quality of the trial. However, a protocol change 
intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to subjects should be implemented 
immediately, and the IRB notified withi n five days. Perrigo will submit protocol amendments to the 
FDA or other regulatory agencies.  
 
When, in the judgment of the reviewing IRB, the investigators and/or Perrigo, the amendment to the 
protocol substantially alters the study design and/or increase s the potential risk to the subject, the

 11.1 Data Collection  
 
Database set -up will be performed by  [CONTACT_258858] (EDC) 
vendor, using an appropriate fully validated, [ADDRESS_314589] will 
be recorded by [CONTACT_258859].  Only authorized site personnel will be able 
to enter/modify/correct data to the eCRF.  
 
Approved staff at  wi ll verify all data entered into eCRFs for completeness and accuracy with 
reference to the source documents and records and will issue manual data queries to correct missing 
data or discrepancies found against the source within the EDC system.  
 
Data validation will consist of automated and manual edit checks that are created directly into EDC. 
Automated edit checks will be executed on all data points defined and documented by [CONTACT_258860].  Study metrics will be reported fro m the EDC system.  
 
After all data have been verified by [CONTACT_258861] , an investigator or sub-investigator 
(listed on Form FDA 1572) is required to review and approve all eCRFs prior to database lock and 
breaking of the blind.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During each subject’s visit to the clinic, a designee participating in the study will record progress 
notes to document all significant observations.  At a minimum, these notes will contain:  
 
a) Documentation of the informe d consent process;  
b) The date of the visit and the corresponding Visit or Week in the study schedule;  
c) General subject status remarks, including any significant medical findings. The severity, 
frequency, and duration of any adverse events and the investigator 's assessment of 
relationship to study medication must also be recorded.  
d) Any changes in concomitant medications or dosages;  
e) A general reference to the procedures completed; and  
f) The signature (or initials) and date of all clinicians who made an entry in the  progress notes.  
 
In addition, any contact [CONTACT_258862].  
 
Any changes to information in the study progress note s and other source documents will be entered 
in black or blue ink, initialed , and dated by [CONTACT_258863]/addition. 
Changes will be made by [CONTACT_2724] a single line through erroneous data, and clearly entering the 

Protocol  No: PRG -NY-19-[ADDRESS_314590] da ta (e.g., wrong data  right data).  Entries may not be erased or masked with white -out fluid. 
If the reason for the change is not apparent, a brief explanation for the change will be written 
adjacent to the change by [CONTACT_15370].  
 
For transmission to Perrigo, information from the study progress notes and other source documents 
will be promptly en tered into the database.  The database also contains a complete audit trail to 
capture all regulatory components of data corrections (e.g. initial entry, new value, initials and date 
of the change).

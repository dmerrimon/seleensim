Study Design  
This is a prospective randomized clinical study that involves studying ketorolac as an adjuvant pain 
medication for arthroscopic meniscus surgery patients. All patients enrolled in this study will receive the 
standard pain control protocol before, during, and after surgery. This includes  1), IV Dexamethasone and 
IV Odansetron during surgery, and 2) analgesics (as direct ed by [CONTACT_101034]) in the PACU. Both 
groups will also receive the standard of care discharge pain medications for arthroscopic meniscus 
surgery: oxycodone -acetaminophen 5 -325 (1 -2 tablets PO q4 -6h PRN for moderate to severe pain #28 
tabs).  
 
Patie nts will be randomized into one of two groups. Group [ADDRESS_1209081] of care pain protocol before, during, and af ter surgery but will also receive an intraoperative 
dose of IV ketorolac at the completion of the procedure and oral ketorolac on discharge (10mg PO q6 x3 
days). Patients in this group will also be given omeprazole (20 mg PO, once per day x3 days). Patient s will 
record their pain levels, oxycodone -acetaminophen [ADDRESS_1209082] pos t-operative appointment. Participation in this study will not require 
any additional visits to the surgeon’s office or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_866682] - and post -operative 
appointments.  
 
 
Study Procedures  
1. All patients scheduled to undergo elective a rthroscopic meniscus surgery identified in the office of one 
of the orthopaedic investigations will undergo the process of obtaining consent prior to surgery.  The 
consent form will be reviewed in depth with an IRB approved -member of the research team, all  questions 
answered, and written consent obtained by [CONTACT_866692] a full understanding of the investigation and their role in the study. The patient’s 
home medications will be reviewed, and  any potential drug -drug interactions will be discussed with the 
patient.

utilizing no more of the patient’s time or blood than generally performed if the patient were not enrolled 
in the investigat ion. Before surgery patients will fill out the following patient reported outcome metrics: 
Visual Analogue Score (VAS), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), International Knee 
Documentation Committee (IKDC) evaluation, and the Lysholm knee score.  It is expected that it will take 
the subject about [ADDRESS_1209084] of care pain protocol for arth roscopic meniscus surgery, which consists of: 1) IV 
Dexamethasone and IV Odansetron during surgery, and 2) analgesics (as directed by [CONTACT_322766]) in the PACU. Both groups will also receive the standard of care discharge pain 
medications for arthr oscopic meniscus surgery: oxycodone -acetaminophen 5 -325 (1 -2 tablets PO q4 -6h 
PRN for moderate to severe pain #28 tabs). Group [ADDRESS_1209085] of care 
pain protocol on the day of surgery and an intraoperative dose of IV ketorolac at the completion of 
surgery (dosing individualized by [CONTACT_635460]). The operating surgeon will be responsible for 
directing the anesthesi ologist to administer the IV Ketorolac. Group [ADDRESS_1209086] of 
care discharge pain medications and scheduled oral ketorolac (10mg PO q6 x3 days). In addition, all 
Group 2 patients will receive a prescription for omeprazole (20 mg PO, onc e per day x3 days) to take for 
3 days after surgery to decrease their risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_453159]. Patients in Group 1 will not 
receive a prescription for omeprazole. A 1:1 randomization ratio will be used (an equal number of 
patients will be placed in each group). Patients will then undergo standard arthroscopic meniscus surgery 
with one of the surgical investigators. Prior to discharge, all patients will be provided a handout on safely 
using opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].   
 
4. Following discharge from the ambulatory sur gery center, patients in Group 1 and Group 2 will be 
asked to document their VAS pain scores at 6 hour intervals (morning, afternoon, and evening) for five 
days in a journal administered to them at the time of study enrollment. They will also be asked to r ecord 
the number of oxycodone -acetaminophen 5 -325 pi[INVESTIGATOR_866683]. 
At the end of each day, patients will be asked to document the following adverse effects: nausea, 
vomiting, somnolence, dizziness, headache, pain,  pruritis, other in their journal. All patients in Group [ADDRESS_1209087] the number of ketorolac pi[INVESTIGATOR_866684]. 
To ensure safety, all patients assigned to Group 2 will receive a form outlining the common and serious 
side effects of Ketorolac and specific instructions for when they should call their doctor or go to the 
emergency room. All patients who  receive meniscus surgery at UH are instructed to call their surgeon’s 
office if they feel their pain is not controlled at home after surgery.  
 
5. Patients in Group [ADDRESS_1209088] any questions and to ensure they are filling out their journal. Patients in 
Group 2 will also be asked if they are experiencing any of the side effects from ketorolac. Patients in 
Group 2 will be given an educational hando ut on the side effects of ketorolac when they are discharged 
from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].

knee, pain levels, strength and questioned regarding functionality of the operative knee.  In the setting of 
a complication ( wound breakdown, infection), patient information will be recorded and communicated 
using university password protected email to communicate with the primary investigator. At the first two 
follow -up clinic appointment after surgery, patients will fill out t he following patient reported outcome 
metrics: VAS, KOOS, IKDC, and Lysholm questionnaires. The first appointment is about [ADDRESS_1209090] received for their prescription for oxycodone -acetaminophen 5 -

Study Timeline  
Patients are evaluated in the orthopaedic investigators’ outpatient clinics for meniscus pathology. If a 
patient’s condition is amenab le to arthroscopic surgery and they elect to undergo the procedure they will 
be approached for participation in this study. This evaluation and discussion of the surgical procedure 
should take 10 -15 minutes. The time for enrolling a patient should take 10 minutes with 5 minutes for 
patients’ questions. Therefore, an outpatient visit for a patient enrolling this study would take [ADDRESS_1209091] -op visit.

following: 1) the patient’s past medical history in their electronic medical record and pre -operative 
history form will be evaluated for contraindications to ketorolac, and 2) the patient will be questioned 
prior to enrollment about havin g any of the conditions that are contraindications to Ketorolac using the 
patient enrollment form created for this study (see “Other Documents” in Sparta submission).  
Common non -serious side effects of Ketorolac:  
• Nausea, stomach pain, indigestion, diarrhea  
• Dizziness, drowsiness  
• Headache  
• Swelling  
 
Serious side effects of Ketorolac:  
• Gastrointestinal problems: ulcers, bleeding, or peforation  
• Hemorrhage  
• Impaired renal function  
• Impaired liver function  
• Allergic or anaphylactoi d reaction  
• Anemia  
• Ketorolac, like other NSAIDs, may cause serious cardiovascular side effects, such as 
myocardial infarction or stroke, which may result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_866688] U for side effects to Ketorolac after 
receiving an IV dose at the end of their surgery, and will be given an informative handout on ketorolac 
and its side effects (see “Other Documents” in Sparta submission). This handout also has instructions for 
when pat ients should call their surgeon’s office or seek immediate medical assistance. In addition, all 
patients enrolled in this study will receive a phone call on Day [ADDRESS_1209095] the Privacy Interests of Research Participants  
Privacy of the study subjects will be protected throughout all phases of the research study.  Consent will

Arthroscopic repair is a well -established treatment option for patients with meniscus pathology. 
Therefore, if their surgeon has recommended they receive arthroscopic repair, it will be because the 
surgeon believes it is the best treatment option f or their condition, not for research purposes. If a patient 
elects to withdraw from the Ketorolac arm, they will simply be asked to discontinue use of Ketorolac and 
continue with the use of oxycodone -acetaminophen [ADDRESS_1209097] of ketorolac and omeprazole for 
patients randomized into Group 2. As such, the patient’s insura nce company will be responsible for the 
cost of ketorolac and omeprazole. However, ketorolac is a generic drug that is commonly utilized both 
within and outside of Orthopaedics. Patients will ultimately be responsible if the insurance company does 
not pay,  and for any associated co -pay. Paying for Ketorolac and Omeprazole will be discussed with the 
patient in clinic during the consent process.

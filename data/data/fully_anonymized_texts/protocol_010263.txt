CEM -102 Tablets  Name [CONTACT_881174]:  An Open -Label, Non -Randomized, Single -Arm, Multi -Center Study to Evaluate Oral 
Sodium Fusidate (CEM -102) for the Treatment of Staphylococcal Bone or Joint Infections in Subjects for 
whom Chronic Antibiotic Suppressive Therapy is Indicated  
Study No:  CE06 -302 
Planned Number of Subjects: 30 subjects  
Planned Number of Investigational Sites:  Up to 20 (in the US)  
Planned Study Period : 3 years  
Objective:  
To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of oral sodium fusidate (CEM -102) as chronic antibiotic 
suppressive therapy in subjects with staphylococcal bone or joint infections.  
Rationale : 
Subjects with bone or joint infections (with or without prosthetic material), who are unable to undergo 
definitive surgery (i .e. removal of infected bone, sequestrations, or foreign material) because of poor 
health status, age, or comorbidities, generally undergo an initial course of intravenous ( IV) antibiotics 
followed by [CONTACT_881111], consisting of debridement and irriga tion. Often, chronic suppressive 
antibiotic therapy is utilized thereafter.  
Some subjects experience an infection relapse, as manifested by [CONTACT_881112], purulent discharge, wound 
dehiscence , or pain , at some point following cessation of antibiotic therapy. Often, t hese subjects need 
to be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_881077], irrigation, and antibiotics (IV followed by [CONTACT_881113] 3 -6 months or longer). In some cases, the suppressive oral antibiotic therapy is not 
able to elim inate/reduce the pain and/or the wound drainage or to improve the ability to ambulate due to 
decreased weight bearing or lack of joint function. In addition, dosing or duration of currently available 
oral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_881078]-limiting or treatment -related adverse events  
(such as renal toxicity , allergy, bone marrow suppression, paresthesias, or skin discoloration), 
comorbidities (such as renal insufficiency), or emergence of antimicrobial resistance. When any of these 
even ts happen, the oral antibiotic must be replaced.  
Every time the infection relapses, the subject may be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_881079] , 
debridement and antibiotic therapy (IV followed by [CONTACT_881114]). In some cases, amputati on of 
the infected limb may be considered as a last resort.  
There is clearly a need for additional effective oral antibiotics that can be safely administered and that 
will be well tolerated over extended treatment periods. Oral fusidic acid (CEM -102) has b een available 
for use outside the US for over [ADDRESS_1231596]  
CEM -102 Tablets  Name [CONTACT_881175] : 
This is a prospective, open -label, non -randomized, single -arm trial to evaluate the safety and 
effectiveness of CEM -[ADDRESS_1231597] may be suitable for chronic oral antibiotic suppressive 
therapy include, but are not limited to , the following : 1) having an infection that cannot be managed by 
[CONTACT_881115], 2) having a refractory infection not responding 
to previous treatment, and 3) not being  a candidate for long -term intravenous antibiotic therapy . 
Subjects must have  a bone or joint infection due to an inclu sionary pathogen, demonstrated from a 
positive culture from samples obtained during surgery, biopsy , or drainage procedures within 6 weeks 
prior to enrollment.  
Acceptable path ogens in this study include the following CEM -102-susceptible organisms: methici llin-
susceptible  S. aureus  (MSSA), methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA), and coagulase -
negative staphylococc i (CoNS) such as S. epi[INVESTIGATOR_77353] , S. hominis , or S. haemolyticus . Specifically 
excluded from this list of pathogens is S. saprophyticus . Prior to enrollment, sensitivity of the isolate(s) 
to CEM -[ADDRESS_1231598] be demonstrated.  
Co-infection  with Corynebacterium  spp., Propi[INVESTIGATOR_76494] , beta –hemolytic streptococci, and 
enterococci, or other bacteria susceptible to CEM -102 is permitted.  
Co-infection with bacteria known or expected not to be susceptible to CEM -102 (e.g. Gram -negatives or 
anaerobes) is permitted , provided these bacteria can be treated with an adjunctive antibiotic to which the 
inclusionary staphylococcus is not susceptible, an d there are no known drug -drug interactions with CEM -
102. 
CEM -[ADDRESS_1231599] be initiated with one or more additional antibiotics (either oral or IV), referred to as 
companion  antibiotics, for the first 1 -2 weeks of the study. Companion antibiotic(s) will be selected per 
the Investigator’s discretion on the basis of subject -specific antibiotic tolerability and pathogen 
susceptibilities. Because concomitant administration of rif ampin results in markedly reduced levels of 
CEM -[ADDRESS_1231600] mus t be a suitable candidate for CEM -102 monotherapy  after completion of 1 -2 weeks of the 
companion antibiotic , for chronic treatment of the orthopedic infection due to the inclusionary pathogen.   
This study comprises two parts: Part A (enrollment through the  6-month visit) and Part B ([ADDRESS_1231601]-enrollment). In Part A, a ll subjects will receive [ADDRESS_1231602]  completing Part A for clinical response at the 6 -month visit (primary endpoint). For 
Part B, a subject who completes Part A and, in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], requires continued suppressive 
therapy may continue to receive CEM -102. Alternatively, if the Investigator considers the infection 
resolved and that no further antibiotic therapy is required, study drug will be discontinued and the subject 
followed for evidence of relapse until End of Study (EOS).  
During  the first 6 months of treatment , study Part A, subjects will be monitored monthly (± 1 week) for 
safety and clinical response to CEM -102. During study  Part B, subjects will be monitored every 3 months 
(±2 weeks) until the End of Study Visit (24 months) . 
A subject who discontinues study drug  because of treatment failure will have an EOS visit  at that time.  
A subject who discontinues stud y drug due to an adverse event ( AE) will be followed until the AE is 
resolved or stabilized. A subject who discontinues study drug due to clinical cure will be followed for 
relapse until EOS. If a subject withdraws from the study at any time, for any reaso n, an EOS visit will be 
performed at that time.  
Duration of Subject Participation:  The a nticipated duration of  participation for each subject will be

CEM -102 may be taken while fasting or with food.  
CEM -102 will be supplied by [CONTACT_89077] -102 Pharmaceuticals  (a subsidiary of Cempra, Inc.) . 
Duration of Treatment:  
This study is designed to evaluate a minimum of [ADDRESS_1231611] i nto an expanded access protocol.  
Companion Antibiotic Therapy:  
CEM-[ADDRESS_1231612] be initiated with one  or more additional antibiotics (either oral or IV) for the first 1 -2 weeks 
of the study . Companion antibiotic(s) will be selected per the Investigator’s discretion on the basis of 
CEM -[ADDRESS_1231613] -specific antibiotic tolerability and pathogen susceptibilities.  Examples include, but are not limited 
to, the following: IV cefazolin, vancomycin, daptomyci n, or IV/PO linezolid  (rifampin must not be used as 
a concomitant antibiotic with CEM -102). The companion antibiotic will not be provided by [CONTACT_1034] , 
but will be supplied by [CONTACT_881116]. Starting an antibiotic due to sign s and 
symptoms of clinical failure (e .g., worsening redness, swelling, pain, purulent discharge, sinus tract 
formation, or bacteremia) will be classified as clinical failure.  
Adjunctive Antibiotic Therapy  for Co -infections : 
Treatment of co -infections due to bacteria known or expected to not be susceptible to fusidic acid is 
permitted, provided these pathogens can be treated with an adjunctive antibiotic to which the inclusionary 
pathogen is not susceptible (e.g. a ztreonam and metronidazole are permitted fo r treatment of Gram -
negative and anaerobic co -infections ).  
Concomitant Antibiotic Therapy for Unrelated Infections:  
Treatment of an unrelated infection with an antibiotic to which the inclusionary pathogen is susceptible 
is permitted only if the antibioti c is administered for ≤ 10 days on any single occasion, and ≤ 2 courses 
during any 6 -month period during the study (and provided there are no known drug -drug interactions with 
CEM -102).  
Primary Endpoint : 
The p rimary endpoint will be the proportion of sub jects in the intent to treat ( ITT) analysis set who meet 
all the criteria for clinical success at the 6 -Month Visit.  
Clinical success is defined to occur when subjects meet all of the following  criteria : 
• Subject was not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_881081] -qualifying orthopedic infection at 
any point between enrollment and the 6 -Month Visit  
• Subject did not undergo a definitive surgical procedure (such as amputation) at any point 
between enrollment and the 6 -Month Visit  
• No additional antibiotics (after  completion of companion antibiotics) are required for treatment 
of the orthopedic infection d ue to the inclusionary pathogen  
• Wound is closed, or the open area decreased in size (L x W) and, if a skin graft was done, the 
graft remains viable without eviden ce of infection  
• No purulent discharge from the surgical wound , or new or recurring sinus tract  
• No worsening of redness, tenderness , or swelling at the primary infection site  
• No bacteremia of the inclusionary pathogen at any point between e nrollment and the  6-Month 
Visit 
Clinical failure defined as  follows : 
• Failure to meet  all criteria for clinical success  
• Death ( due to the primary infection)  
• Discontinuation of study drug due to an AE and the requirement of additional antibiotics for 
treatment of the primar y infection  
• Use of a concomitant antibiotic to which the inclusionary pathogen is susceptible for > 10 days 
on any occasion, or for > 2 co urses during any 6 -month period  
Indeterminate:  
• Subject withdraws consent  
• Subject is lost to follow -up 
Investigators wi ll evaluate and provide documentation of each subject for a clinically meaningful 
difference in each subject’s response prior to making a determination of treatment failure  for the 
primary study endpoint.  
Secondary Endpoints:  
• The safety and tolerability of CEM -[ADDRESS_1231614] incidences of treatment emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ), serious adverse events 
(SAEs ), deaths, and discontinuations due to  AEs in the safety analysi s set

CEM -102 Tablets  Name [CONTACT_881177]  
• The proportion of subjects in the ITT analysis set who meet all the criteria for clinical success, 
as defined above, at the 9-Month, 12-Month, 15-Month, 18-Month, 21-Month, and 24-Month 
Visits  
• Pharmacokinetics of CEM -102 used chronically in subjects with o rthopedic infections  
Safety Evaluations:  
The 6-month history of all prior antibiotics used to treat the primary  infection  will be recorded in the 
electronic case report form ( eCRF ). All other medications taken during the period from  7 days prior to 
enrollment through the End of Study (EOS) will be recorded in the eCRF.  
AEs will be collected from the date of execution of the Informed Consent through [ADDRESS_1231616] dose 
of study drug  or until resolution /stabilization of all AEs. Safety assessments, including laboratory 
assessments (serum chemistry and pregnancy test), physical examination, and vital signs, will be 
obtained as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments  (Table 1). 
The number and percent of subjects with treatment -emergent graded laboratory abnormalities  (defined 
based on the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases ( DMID criteria) and vital s ign changes 
from Baseline  will be summarized.  
The incidence of treatment -related AEs from enrollment until the end of the study (6 -Month Visit or EOS 
Visit) will be tabulated by [CONTACT_1196], preferred term , and maximum severity (mild, moderate, 
or severe/life threatening).  
Statistical Methods and Data Analysis:  
As a non -randomized, single -arm study, there will be no formal statistical analyses. This study i s not 
powered for inferential statistical analyses , and no formal hypothesis testing will be c onducted. Safety 
and efficacy will be descriptive. Clinical outcome will be reported as the proportion of subjects meeting 
the criteria of clinical success.  
All safety data will be summarized using the Safety analysis set. Adverse events (AEs) will be code d with 
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®). The number and proportion of subjects 
having treatment -emergent AEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_7204] (SOC) and preferred 
term, severity , and relationship to study drug.  
Becaus e this is a non -randomized, open -label, single -arm study, interim data may be summarized and 
reported, as needed, prior to database lock.  
Details of the analysis will be provided in a separate S tatistical Analysis Plan (SAP).

c. Study Day [ADDRESS_1231618] day of dosing with CEM -102. 
d. Subjects who discontinue CEM -102 because of an adverse event (AE) or clinical failure should have a study visit around the time of drug discontinuation an d 
will continue to be followed, as needed, for appropriate observation of treatment -related AEs until  AEs have resolved or stabilized. If a subject withdraws from 
the study at any time, for any reason, the EOS visit will be performed around that time. Those subjects who continue CEM -102 until the Month 24 visit will 
undergo the assessme nts/procedures for the EOS visit.   At study closure, at the discretion of the Investigator, subjects may be rolled over into an expanded 
access protocol to receive chronic suppressive CEM -102 therapy.  
e. If clinically indicated, microbiological samples (tissue surrounding the foreign materia l, synovial fluid, bone, etc.) obtained during the study should be submitted 
to the local laboratory for aerobic and anaerobic culture  and susceptibility testing, including to CEM -102. All isolated bacteria are to be sub -cultured and shipped 
to the central  microbiology l aboratory  for organism confirmation and confirmatory susceptibility testing . 
f. Vital sign measurements include height, weight, temperature, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and blood pressure.  Results are t o be recorded in the eCRF.  
g. Limited physical examination may include HEENT, cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, skin, lymph nodes, musculoskeletal , and extremities , among 
others. Results are to be documented in source and recorded in the eCRF.  
h. Examination of the infected area will i nclude the following assessments: pain, erythema, mobility, joint stability, wound closure, wound drainage, and weight 
bearing [for back and  lower extremity infections]. The Investigator will state whether the infected area seems to have improved, deterior ated, or remained  
unchanged. Results are to be documented in the source and recorded in the eCRF.  
i. Safety laboratory assessments will be performed at the local laboratory and will include  the following : serum chemistry (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase [ALP],  
total and direct bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen [BUN], creatinine, albumin, total protein, sodium, total carbon dioxide, glucose, potassium, chloride, calcium, 
phosphorus, and CPK ).  For female subjects of child bearing potential, a urine or serum pregnan cy test will be performed at Screening and  will be repeated at 
subsequent visits per Investigator’s discretion.  . 
j. Laboratory measurements of markers of inflammation will be performed at the local laboratory and will include  the following:  hematology (compl ete blood count 
[CBC]  with differential ), erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR ], and C-reactive protein [CRP]). Laboratory measurements of markers of inflammation obtained on 
the day of a surgery or debridement should be performed before  the procedure when possible, because  levels of these markers are known to increase after 
surgery.

CEM-102 (sodium fusidate, fusidic acid) is the only member of a novel class of antibiotics, the 
fusidanes.  It inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by [CONTACT_881117]-G (EF-G). It 
has a unique mechanism of action, and there is little cross-resistance with other antibiotics in 
clinical use. Oral tablets and topi[INVESTIGATOR_881082] [ADDRESS_1231625] been 
developed by [CONTACT_881118] (Ballerup, Denmark), but their clinical use has been limited. Oral 
CEM-102 300 mg tablets 
are under development in the [LOCATION_002] (US) by [CONTACT_89077]-102 
Pharmaceuticals (a subsidiary of Cempra, Inc.) for treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin 
structure infection (ABSSSI).  
CEM-[ADDRESS_1231626], and skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) as part of international surveillance studies 
conducted between 2008 and 2014 showed that CEM-102 inhibited 99.7% of S. aureus  isolates 
(and 99.8% of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA) isolates) at a mi nimum 
inhibitory concentration (MIC) ≤ 1μg/mL. The majority of coagulase -negative staphylococci 
(CoNS) with or without oxacillin-resistance were similarly susceptible. Among other Gram-
positive bacteria, CEM-[ADDRESS_1231627] enterococci (MIC 90 4 mg/L), Corynebacterium  
spp. (MICs ≤  0.12 µg/mL), M icrococcus luteus  (MICs ≤  0.5 μg/mL) , and Streptococcus pyogenes  
(M
IC90 8 µg/mL). In addition, CEM-[ADDRESS_1231628] Propi[INVESTIGATOR_788555]. (MIC 90 1 
µg/mL). CEM-[ADDRESS_1231629] Gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic 
bacteria. 
Adkins and Gottlieb (Adkins
 1999 ) reviewed published experience with fusidic acid in the 
treatment of bone and joint infections (BJI), citing its utility in the treatment of acute and chronic 
osteomyelitis, vertebral infection, septic arthritis, and prosthetic and other device related 
infections. The authors considered achievement of effective bone and joint fusidic acid 
concentrations a key factor in its historical efficacy in the treatment of these conditions. 
Lautenbach and colleagues measured serum and bone fusidic acid concentrations (by [CONTACT_881119] a susceptible bacterial strain) in 36 patients with chronic osteomyelitis 
during the course of therapy; bone concentrations of active drug ranged from 1 to 15 µg/g, 
measured at approximately [ADDRESS_1231630] oral dose (in most cases, 20 to 40 mg/kg/day, divided 
three times daily (TID) (Lautenbach 1975 ). Hieholzer and colleagues measured bone and soft 
tissue concentrations at [ADDRESS_1231631] oral dose ([ADDRESS_1231632] 5 days) in 
a series of patients with osteomyelitis and found fusidic acid concentrations of 2 to 15 µg/g in bone 
and 4 to 17 µg/g in soft tissue (Hieholzer 1966 , Hieholzer 1974 ). A second group of patients 
studied by [CONTACT_881120] (500 mg TID, orally) for 5 to 13 
days prior to surgery for non-infected bone disease; bone fusidic acid concentrations were, on 
average, up to two-fold higher than those observed in patients with osteomyelitis, and mean 
concentrations ranged from 46% to 94% of those observed in serum. Chater reported fusidic acid 
concentrations in bone and serum from 7 adult patients treated with 500 mg TID oral fusidic acid 
for osteomyelitis; bone concentrations were similar to those described above, and ranged from 4% 
to 72% of serum concentrations, with consistently higher soft tissue concentrations (ranging from 
20% to >100% of serum concentrations) ( Chater 1972 ) . In summary, oral fusidic acid dosing was 
CEM-102 Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Protocol CE06-302 
07 July 2015 Confidential Page 18 of 70 found to achieve drug concentrations at the site of infection that were associated with effective 
treatment of osteomyelitis across a number of studies.   
Subjects with bone or joint infections (with or without prosthetic material), who are unable to 
undergo definitive surgery (i.e. removal of infected bone, sequestrations, or foreign material) 
because of poor health status, age, or comorb idities, generally undergo an initial course of 
intravenous (IV) an tibiotics followed by [CONTACT_881121], consisting of debridement and 
irrigation. Often, chronic suppressive antib iotic therapy is utilized thereafter. 
Some subjects experience an infection relapse, as manifested by [CONTACT_881122], purulent discharge, 
wound dehiscence, or pain, at some point following cessation of an tibiotic therapy. Often, these 
subjects need to be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_881083], irrigation, and antibiotics 
(IV followed by [CONTACT_881123] 3-6 months or longer).  In some cases, the suppressive 
oral antibiotic therapy is not able to eliminat e/reduce the pain and/or the wound drainage or to 
improve the ability to ambulate due to decreased weight bearing or lack  of joint function. In 
addition, dosing or duration of currently availabl e oral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_881084]-limiting or treatment-related adverse ev ents (TEAE) (such as renal toxicity, allergy, 
bone marrow suppression, paresthesias, or skin di scoloration), comorbidities (such as renal 
insufficiency), or emergence of antimicrobial re sistance. When any of these events happen, the 
oral antibiotic must be replaced. Every time the infection relapses, the subject may be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_881085], debridement, and antibi otic therapy (IV followed by [CONTACT_881114]). In some 
cases, amputation of the infected limb ma y be considered as a last resort. 
There is medical need for new oral agents with improved activity and good sa fety and tolerability 
over extended treatment periods against Gram-positive bacteria, including drug resistant 
pathogens.  The purpose of this study is to eval uate the safety and effectiveness of CEM-102 for 
chronic antibiotic suppressive ther apy of bone or joint infections. 
In addition to adults, this study wi ll also include adolescent subj ects between the ages of 12 and 
18 years who weigh greater than 60 kilogram s.  In a retrospective cohort study by (Olson 2014),  
the authors reviewed all patients in a children’s In fectious Disease clinic over a 2-year period who 
received ≥ [ADDRESS_1231633] commonly treated principal infections were septic arthritis, acute osteomyelitis, and chronic 
osteomyelitis in 18%, 15% and 8% of subject s, respectively. Furthermore, in a study by 
[CONTACT_881124] 1984, in [ADDRESS_1231634]- line antibiotic regimen.  Since 
pediatric patients with orthopedi c infections are not uncommon, th is study will attempt to obtain 
important safety information on CEM-102 use in this adolescent population.

through inhibition of bacterial replication, and is thus considered bacteriostatic. However, as with 
many bacterial protein synthesis inhibitors, CEM-102 may be bacteriostatic or bactericidal 
depending upon the inoculum size.  
CEM-102 inhibits bacterial protein synthesis through inhibition of the Elongation Factor G (EF-
G). Elongation Factor G is an essential bacterial protein that is involved in translocation on th e 
ribosome after peptide bond formation. Due to this novel mechanism of action, little cross-
resistance between fusidic acid and other antibiotics has been reported.

a. Determined according to published EUCAST (2015) breakpoint criteria (MIC ≤  1 μg/mL , susceptible).  For 
enterococci and streptococcal species, EUCAST breakpoints have not been established.  
High-level resistance to fusidic acid in staphylococcal species generally occurs through mutations 
in fusA, the 
gene encoding EF-G (Turnidge 1999 , Besier 2003 ). Low-level resistance is most 
c
ommonly caused by [CONTACT_881125], whic h 
encode proteins that bind EF-G on the ribosome, enabling resumption of translation that has been 
stalled by [CONTACT_881126]/EF-G interaction (O’Neill 2006 , O’Neill 2007, Guo 2012 ). Emergence 
of staphylococcal resistance to fusidic acid outside of the US has probably been facilitated by [CONTACT_881127] (both as a topi[INVESTIGATOR_881086] ( Rijinders 2012 ) and 
with oral non-loading dose strategies).  
However, even after decades of fusidic acid use outside the US, including topi[INVESTIGATOR_44785], in a 2011 
international surveillance, 93.4% of S. aureus  strains circulating in Eur ope were susceptible to 
fusidic acid using the EUCAST breakpoint of 1 µg/mL . Only 1.5% of European S. aureus strains  
carried high-level res istance to fusidic acid  (MIC ≥ 8 µg/mL) .  
F
urthermore, a new loading dose regimen will achieve high blood concentrations within 24 hours 
and likely will reduce the emergence of resistance. This dosing regimen consists of 1500 mg Q12h 
for two doses , followed by 600 mg Q12h thereafter.

.2 Nonclinical 
CEM-102 showed weak inhibition of the hERG current (3.1% at 100 µM) in vitro. No significant 
cardiovascular effects were observed in the micropig. There were no treatment-related central 
nervous system effects in rats following repeat dosing of up to 250 mg/kg/day for 28 days. No 
treatment-related respi[INVESTIGATOR_881087] 250 mg/kg/day for 
[ADDRESS_1231639] exami ned the excretion of CEM -102; however, literature reports of studies with 
14C-labeled fusidic acid in rats and rabbits have identified the compound as primarily excreted by 
[CONTACT_881128], with very little radioactivity in the urine.   
CEM -102 adminis tration to rats and dogs for 4 weeks was generally well tolerated at doses up to 
250 mg/kg/day; the major target toxicity at high doses consisted of gastrointestinal effects and 
adrenal gland changes in the dog. There were no serious adverse toxicities, wi th a no adverse effect 
level ( NOAEL ) of 100  mg/kg/day for rats and 40  mg/kg/day for dogs.   
CEM -102 was not mutagenic or clastogenic in genetic toxicity assays.  
No CEM -102 related effects on fertility parameters were noted in male or female rats. The 
NOAEL s for maternal toxicity and fetal development effects were 100 and 200 mg/kg in the rat 
and 115 and 175 mg/kg in the rabbit, respectively. Studies on prenatal and postnatal development 
and maternal function have not been conducted.  
5.3 Clinical  
Cempra has cond ucted three Phase 1 studies with CEM -102 in healthy adult subjects, one Phase 2 
clinical study in adults with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI), and one 
phase 2 trial in prosthetic joint infection (PJI). The PJI trial was terminat ed because of decreased 
fusidic acid blood concentrations secondary to concomitant rifampin administration (drug -drug 
interaction). A total of [ADDRESS_1231640] been conducted, and one intermediate -size 
expanded access trial is ongoing. Study CE06 -EA01 (single -patient expanded access) provided 
CEM -102 for a single patient with chronic MRSA bone and joint infection. Study CE06 -EA02 
(single -patient expanded a ccess) provided CEM -102 for chronic methicillin -resistant S. aureus 
(MRSA) pulmonary infection in a single patient with cystic fibrosis (CF), and two subject s, both 
with chronic MRSA infections of a hip prosthesis, have been treated with CEM -102 in Study 
CE06-EA03 (inte rmediate -size expanded access).  
5.3.1  Clinical Pharmacology  and Metabolism  
CEM -102 binds primarily to albumin in human plasma (96.3% to 96.8% bound); this binding is 
reversible.  
A food effect study showed that food had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics 
(PK) of CEM -102. Gastrointestinal side effects, primarily nausea and vomiting, appeared to be 
lessened by [CONTACT_881129].  
CEM -102 has a plasma half -life of  approximately 12 hours, and slowly accumulates to steady state 
levels when administered orally as 500 mg three times daily (TID) (the recommended European 
dose schedule). In a Phase 1 study with CEM -102 given 500 mg TID, trough levels rose steadily 
from D ay 1 through Day 5, attaining mean trough concentrations of 105 μg/mL prior to the final 
CEM-102 Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Protocol CE06-302 
07 July 2015 Confidential Page 22 of 70 dose on Day 5. However, by [CONTACT_18120] a loading dose strategy and twice daily (BID) 
administration, target therap eutic peak and tr ough plasma concentrations (>100 μg/mL) were 
achieved by 24 hours. With a loading dose of 1650 mg BID on Day 1 followed by 825 mg BID 
for 6.5 days, a mean trough plasma concentration of 146 μg/mL was achieved by [ADDRESS_1231641]-dose, and a mean trough plasma concentration of 204 μg/mL was reached after 7 days of 
dosing.  
Use of a loading dose (or ‘front-loading’) stra tegy is anticipated to reduce the exposure of 
pathogens to sub-therapeutic drug concentra tions. Pharmacokinetic st udies evaluating front-
loaded dosing regimens demonstrated that it wa s possible to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_881088] S. aureus  
(EUCAST criteria, ≤ 1.0 µg/mL). It had been previously dem onstrated that fusidic acid resistance 
emergence frequencies were low at high multiples of MIC ( O’Neill 2006 ), and this observation 
was confirmed in hollow-fiber culture models, in  which loading dose PK parameter fusidic acid 
exposure substantially reduced resistance emergence ( Tsuji 2011 ).  
CEM-[ADDRESS_1231642] with a variety of drugs through transporter inhibition 
and offer a mechanistic explanati on for the adverse inte raction between statins and fusidic acid 
that has been previously identified, and which appears to be mediated (at least in part) by 
[CONTACT_448662]1B1 and OATP1B3 inhibition.  Drug-drug interaction studies ha ve not been completed with CEM-102. Based on Fucidin® 
(sodium fusidate or fusi dic acid) product labeling ( Fucidin®1 2013 , Fucidin®2 2013, 
Fucidin® 2014 ), clinical Study CE06-200, and published reports, interactions may occur with the 
following: OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 s ubstrates (in particular, stat ins); CYP3A4 biotransformed 
drugs (including target specific oral anticoagulants principally metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 such as 
rivaroxaban and api[INVESTIGATOR_3822]), cyclosporine; hum an immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease 
inhibitors; statins; estrogens; and drugs that ha ve a similar biliary excretion pathway); CYP3A4 
inducers (such as dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], nafcillin, rifampin, phenobarbital); 
and CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as azole antifungals; erythromycin, clarithromycin; and grapefruit 
juice). 
5.3.2 Summary of Efficacy 
[IP_ADDRESS] Phase 2 ABSSSI Study 
Study CE06-300 was a Phase 2 randomized, double-b lind, multi-center efficacy and safety study 
to evaluate oral CEM-102 (a loading dose of  1500 mg BID on Day 1 followed by 600 mg BID) 
compared to oral linezolid [ADDRESS_1231643] of cure (TOC) visit such that no further antibiotic therapy was 
required. The primary efficacy endpoint was clinical success at the TOC f or the Intent to Treat 
(ITT) and clinically evaluable (CE) populations.  
Males and female subjects ≥18 years of age with a diagnosis of an ABSSSI (cellulitis, with or 
without focal abscess, or wound infection) suspected or confirmed to be caused by a Gram -positive 
pathogen ( staphylococci  or streptococci ), in whom 10 to 14 days of oral antibacterial therapy was 
appropriate, were evaluated for potential enrollment. Patients were randomized using a sequence 
that was stratified by [CONTACT_180890] (cellulitis or wound infection), and then randomized in a 
1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment arms within each stratum: conventional regimen (CEM -102 600 mg 
BID), loading dose regimen (CEM -102 1500 mg BID on Day 1, followed by 600 mg BID), or 
linezolid 600 mg BID, each ad ministered orally for 10 to 14 days.  
The study was initially designed as an adaptive trial that provided for transition to a Phase 3 non -
inferiority (NI) trial (n=700) with one of the two CEM -102 regimens compared to linezolid if 
certain predictive criteri a were met. Interim analyses were performed after 90, 127, and 181 
patients were enrolled and evaluated for the primary outcome of clinical response at the TOC visit 
as well as for safety and tolerability. At the 127 patient interim analysis, the CEM -102 n on-loading 
dose and loading dose regimens showed comparable safety and tolerability; hence, the CEM -102 
conventional dose regimen was dropped, and the remaining patients were randomized 1:1 to CEM -
102 loading dose or linezolid. At the 181 patient interim a nalysis, the predictive probability of 
clinical success in the clinically evaluable population in Phase 3 was 0.89, which exceeded the 
threshold for transitioning to the Phase 3 stage of the trial; therefore, when these results were 
available, enrollment i n the Phase 2 stage of the trial was terminated (total n=198).  
Four patient populations were analyzed for efficacy: ITT (all randomized patients); 
microbiological ITT (MITT; all ITT patients with ≥1 Gram -positive pathogen isolated at baseline); 
clinically evaluable (CE; ITT patients who met all enrollment criteria, received a pre -defined 
minimum course of study drug, and had a clinical response of cure or failure at the TOC [7 to 14 
days after the End of Therapy (EOT)]); and microbiologically evaluable (ME;  CE patients with a 
Gram -positive pathogen isolated at baseline).   
Clinical success was defined as total resolution of local and systemic signs and symptoms of the 
ABSSSI such that no further antibiotic therapy was required. The primary efficacy endpoint was 
clinical success at the TOC for the ITT and CE populations.  A total of 198 patients were 
randomized (ITT population) and all received ≥1 dose of study medication; [ADDRESS_1231644] to completion of the study, the 
CEM -102 loading dose and the linezolid treatment g roups.   
These two treatment groups were comparable in demographics, baseline characteristics, and 
percentages of ITT population in the MITT, CE and ME populations. Comparable percentages of 
patients in each treatment group completed study drug therapy (CE M-102 loading dose 73 of 78 
[94%]; linezolid 76 of 77 [99%]). The mean duration of study drug exposure was similar in the 
two treatment groups (CEM -102 11.3 days and linezolid 11.5 days).

[IP_ADDRESS]  Phase 2 Prosthetic Joint Infection (PJI) Study  
Study CE06 -[ADDRESS_1231645] of care ( SoC) IV antibiotic treatment for patients 
with prosthetic joint or spacer infection managed by [CONTACT_1192] -stage prost hesis exchange or debridement 
and retention ( DAR ). Among the 14 randomized patients, 12 completed study drug dosing on the 
initial randomized treatment.  
Among CEM -102/RIF treated subjects, 4 of 7 (57%) were considered treatment successes. Two 
of the [ADDRESS_1231646] patient had 
unequivocal microbiological failure. MRSA isolated at the time of explant (first -stage) surgery 
was ri fampin susceptible , prior to study drug therapy. Rifampin -resist ant MRSA was re -isolated 
at the second -stage surgery. Although treatment failure for MRSA PJI is well described even with 
standard of care therapy, we surmise that the reduced CEM -102 exposure in this patient set the 
stage for ‘functional monotherapy’ with  rifampin, with emergence of resistance as might be 
expected in this circumstance. Thus, despi[INVESTIGATOR_881089], we have concluded that the interaction has clinical and 
deleter ious significance.   
Among IV SoC treated subjects, 4 of 7 patients overall (57%), and 4 of 5 in whom final outcomes 
were known (80%), were treatment successes. One patient had clinical failure due to a drug related 
AE (‘vancomycin fever’) that necessitate d a change in therapy (to daptomycin).  
5.3.3  Summary of Safety  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Phase 1 PK Studies  
Three completed Phase 1 studies showed that CEM -102 was safe and generally well tolerated in 
healthy adult subjects when administered as single oral doses up to 2200 mg, or as repe ated twice 
daily doses over 5.5 days of up to 1650 mg. CEM -102 was also safe and generally well tolerated 
in healthy adult subjects when administered as loading dose regimens of up to 1650 mg Q12h on 
Day 1 followed by [CONTACT_8622] 825 mg Q12h for 6.5 days. No cli nically significant changes in physical 
examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), or laboratory parameters were observed in 
any subject in these studies. Transient, low -level, non -clinically significant increases in bilirubin 
were noted in Phas e 1 studies. These reversible increases were dose -related and are consistent with 
the known effects of sodium fusidate.  
The threshold for gastrointestinal intolerance for multiple doses (Q12h for 5.5 consecutive days) 
was reached between 1100 and 1650  mg. AEs appeared to be related to dose and duration of 
exposure, with gastrointestinal symptoms reported more frequently after 3 to 5 days of dosing and 
at higher doses.

07 July 2015  Confidential  Page 26 of 70 [IP_ADDRESS]  Phase 2 Studies  
In the Phase 2 ABSSSI Study (CE06 -300), the percentage of subjects who e xperienced ≥1 TEAE 
during the study was 46.5% in the CEM -102 conventional regimen, 61.5% in the CEM -102 
loading dose regimen, and 63.6% in the linezolid treatment group. The majority of TEAEs were 
mild or moderate in intensity. Overall, the type, incidence , and severity of TEAEs were comparable 
among the 3 treatment groups. AEs experienced by ≥5.0% of patients in the CEM -102 
conventional regimen, CEM -102 loading dose regimen, or the linezolid treatment group, 
respectively, were nausea (14.0%, 21.8%, and 26. 0%), vomiting (16.3%, 12.8%, and 9.1%), 
diarrhea (0%, 12.8%, and 13.0%), headache (0%, 5.1%, and 11.7%), dizziness (7.0%, 3.8%, and 
2.6%), and dyspepsia (0%, 7.7%, and 2.6%).  
The majority of treatment -related AEs were associated with gastrointestinal disor ders. Three 
subjects in the CEM -102 loading dose regimen experienced ≥1 serious AE (SAE) during the study 
(preferred terms: herpes simplex; pyelonephritis; and head injury and back pain). The SAEs were 
considered by [CONTACT_881130].  
Four subjects ([ADDRESS_1231647] in the CEM -102 conventional regimen (preferred terms: lip swelling and 
rash) and 3 subjects in the CEM -102 loading dose regimen (preferred terms: nausea and chills; 
blister and rash maculo papular; nause a, vomiting, and anorexia)) experienced ≥1 TEAE that 
resulted in premature discontinuation of study drug; of these, [ADDRESS_1231648] in the CEM -102 loading 
dose regimen was also prematurely discontinued from the study due to TEAEs (preferred terms: 
nausea, vomiti ng, and anorexia).  
Clinical laboratory tests and vital sign measurements did not demonstrate clinically significant 
changes during the study. Comparison of baseline and post -treatment ECGs did not demonstrate 
clinically relevant changes following treatmen t with CEM -102 or linezolid. In conclusion, the 
overall safety and tolerability of the CEM -102 loading dose regimen was comparable to that of 
linezolid.  
In the Phase 2 PJI Study (CE06 -200), the most frequently reported treatment -related AEs were 
gastrointe stinal events (nausea, emesis, vomiting, diarrhea, loose stools) and elevated laboratory 
parameters, such as total or direct bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and creatine kinase (CK). Elevated gamma -glutamyl 
transpeptidase (GGT) levels were also observed in Patient 111 -01, and was attributed to rifampin. 
There were reports of international normalized ratio (INR) or PT elevation, skin rash, worsening 
of anemia, pruritus, worsening renal function and eye floaters.  
There were no clinically significant changes in physical examinations or vital signs in the Phase 2 
studies. Serial ECGs done in these studies demonstrated no adverse cardiac effects with 
administration of CEM -102. 
CEM -102 Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Protocol CE06 -302 
07 July 2015  Confidential  Page 27 of 70 [IP_ADDRESS]  Ex-US Post -Marketing Safety Experience:  
The fusidic acid labeling in countries where the drug is approved notes the organ systems most 
commonly associated with AEs, and the AEs in those systems, as:  
 Gastrointestinal: flatulence, vomiting, nausea, hepatic transaminase el evation, diarrhea, 
anorexia, abdominal pain, jaundice, dyspepsia.  
 Allergic: rash, pruritus, anaphylaxis, angioneurotic edema, urticaria, edema.  
 Hematologic: leukopenia, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, pancytopenia, 
granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis.  
 Neurologic/psychiatric: headache, blurred vision, dizziness, lethargy, psychic disturbance.  
The labeling also includes precautions regarding concomitant drug administration and use in 
patients with impaired liver function to limit potential hepatic AEs.  
Published studies and AE reports from over 4 decades of clinical use outside the US indicate that 
oral sodium fusidate is safe and generally well tolerated when administered as 500  mg 2  or 3 times 
daily for 7 to 14 days. Higher doses (3000  to 4000  mg/day) f or longer periods of time have also 
been used safely to treat patients with more serious or chronic infections. The most commonly 
reported AEs (gastrointestinal disturbances) were more frequent at higher doses and were 
decreased when sodium fusidate was ad ministered with food. The most common AEs in those 
trials were gastrointestinal, and most often, not treatment limiting.   
Hyperbilirubinemia has been reported with use of sodium fusidate; however, the 
hyperbilirubinemia was reversible and reported to result from inhibition of hepatic transporter 
function rather than hepatocellular injury. Reports of serious hepatotoxicity associated with 
sodium fusidate are rare and have primarily been reported with use of the IV formulation.  
5.4 Rationale for the Use of CEM-102 in Staphylococcal Bone or Joint 
Infection  
The rationale for developi[INVESTIGATOR_881090] -102 in this indication is as follows : 
 CEM -102 has a unique mechanism of action and shows little cross -resistance with any 
other known class of antibiotic. Sodium fusidate has  been used for over 4 decades in many 
countries for the treatment of staphylococcal infections and has been shown to be safe and 
effective in the treatment of bone / joint infection, includi ng prosthetic joint infection.  
 Currently, the majority of bone or joint infections occurring in the US are caused by [CONTACT_6907]-
positive pathogens. S. aureus , including both MSSA and MRSA, is the most common 
pathogen identified. CoNS, including Staphylococcus epi[INVESTIGATOR_77353] , are identified nearly as 
often. Other Gram -positive pat hogens, including enterococci, viridans streptococci, 
propi[INVESTIGATOR_881091], occasionally cause infection. In the US,  the majority of these path ogens 
are susceptible to CEM -102. 
 CEM -[ADDRESS_1231649] S. aureus isolates col lected 
in the US from 2008 to 2014, including MRSA (MIC 90 0.12 µg/mL). Of 1798  isolates of 
CoNS tested , only 133 (7.4%) were resistant to CEM -102. The MIC range of CEM -[ADDRESS_1231650] more than 836 isolates of Group A streptococci was mostly 4 to 8 µg/mL, 
concentrations substantially lower than achievable CEM-102 plasma concentrations. 
 C EM-[ADDRESS_1231651] frequently after 3 to 5 days of 
dosing with 1650 mg BID. No safety concerns were identified for any single or multiple 
dosing regimens. 
 C EM-102 was safe and well tolerated in loading dose regimens of 1100/550 mg BID and 
1650/[ADDRESS_1231652] often dosed three times daily. In this context, the occasional emergence of fusidic acid 
resistance during therapy has been observed and the overall prevalence of staphylococci with 
fusidic acid resistance has risen gradually. The latter process has been hastened by [CONTACT_881131][INVESTIGATOR_881092]. Fusidic acid has also been 
used globally for treatment of prosthetic joint infections (PJI), most often in combination with 
rifampin, due to rifampin’s activity in biofilm associated infections.  
Cempra recognized that the use of a fusidic acid (CEM- 102) loading dose (or ‘front -loading’) 
strategy would substantially reduce the exposure of pathogens to sub-therapeutic drug 
concentrations. Pharmacokinetic studies evaluating front-loaded dosing regimens demonstrated 
that it was possible to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_881093] S. aureus  (EUCAST criteria, ≤ 1.0 µg/mL)  (Still 2011 ). 
It had been previously demonstrated that fusidic acid resistance emergence frequencies were low 
at high multiple of MIC (O’Neill, 2006), and this observation was confirmed in hollow -fiber 
culture models, in which loading dose PK parameter fusidic acid exposure substantially reduced 
resistance emergence (Tsuji 2011 ).  In a phase 2/3 ABSSSI trial that compared oral fusidic acid 
with a loading dose to oral linezolid, the success rate for S. aureus infections was 96%, comparable 
to that of linezolid (Section 5.3.2).   
R
ecognizing fusidic acid’s utility in the treatment of bone and joint infections, Cempra conducted 
a randomized phase [ADDRESS_1231653] of care intravenous antibiotics for treatment of prosthetic bone and joint infections. 
PK data was collected from enrolled subjects, and it was determined that a significant fusidic acid-
rifampin drug interaction occurs, resulting in markedly reduced fusidic acid exposure. In this 
context, emergence of rifampin-resistance (but not fusidic acid resistance) in a previously 
CEM-102 Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Protocol CE06-302 
07 July 2015 Confidential Page 29 of 70 susceptible MRSA strain was observed and linked as a contributing factor to  a case of treatment 
failure, and the study was terminated.   
In this study, front-loaded fusidic acid (1500 mg every 12 hours for 2 doses, followed by 600 mg 
every 12 hours thereafter) wi ll be used in combination, for the first 1-2 weeks, with a companion 
antibiotic (not rifampin). Use of the dual strategi es of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_881094] 
(with companion antibiotic therapy), and as suring that steady state trough fusidic acid 
concentrations are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_881095] d (within 24 hours) using a loading dose, is expected to set a 
high barrier to the emergence of ba cterial fusidic acid resi stance.  In addition, fu sidic acid has been 
demonstrated to be effective against biofilm in an in vitro model with S. aureus  both as a single 
agent and in combination with dapt omycin, vancomycin or linezolid ( Siala 2015 ). This observation 
is supported by [CONTACT_881132] ( Adkins 1999).

acid is permitted, provided these pathogens can be treated with an adjunctive antibiotic to which 
the inclusionary pathogen is not susceptible (e.g. aztreonam and metronidazole are permitted for 
treatment of Gram-negative and anaerobic co-infections).   
8
.7 Concomitant Antibiotic Therapy for Unrelated Infections 
Treatment of an unrelated infection with an antibiotic to which the inclusionary pathogen is 
susceptible is permitted only if the antibiotic is administered for ≤ 10 days on any single occasion, 
and ≤ 2 courses during any 6-month period during the study (and provided there are no known 
drug-drug interactions with CEM-102).  
Use
 of a concomitant antibiotic to which the inclusionary pathogen is susceptible for > 10 days on 
any occasion, or for > 2 courses during any 6-month period, will be classified as clinical failure. 
8.8 Prohibited Medications    
Co-administration of CEM-102 with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), as well as rifampin, 
is 
prohibited. Potential clinical drug-drug interactions with oral sodium fusidate are described in 
S
ection 7.4.1 of the CEM- 102 Investigator’s Brochure and in the Fucidin® product labeling or 
published reports.

 Ma rkers of inflammation: complete blood count (CBC) with differential, erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein ( CRP ).   
 S erum or urine pregnancy test for female subjects of childbearing potential. 
CEM-[ADDRESS_1231689] with the medical monitor for approval of enrollment.   If clinically 
indicated, microbiological samples obtained during the study should also be submitted to the local 
laboratory for aerobic and anaerobic culture. 
Collection, transport, and processing of samples (including blood, tissue, synovial fluid, bone, etc.) 
should follow the local laboratory standard operating procedures and protocols. Each local 
laboratory will perform an initial isolate identification and susceptibility testing of Gram-positive 
pathogens. All isolated bacteria are to be sub-cultured and shipped to the Central Microbiology 
Laboratory for organism confirmation and additional susceptibility testing. 
10.5.1 Susceptibility Testing of Bacterial Pathogens (Local Laboratory) 
Initial susceptibility testing to CEM-102 will be done by [CONTACT_881135].  The Central Microbiology Laboratory 
will provide CEM-102 (10 μg) disks to be used to assess the susceptibility of Gram-positive 
species identified as pathogens. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M02-A12 
(2015) a nd M100- S25 (2015) methods should be followed while performing the disk diffusion 
tests, including a
ppropriate concurrent quality control testing ( Table 5).

The EUCAST recommended interpretive criteria for fusidic acid when testing Staphylococcus  spp. 
are: (MIC [susceptible (S)/resistant (R)], ≤1/>1 µg/mL; zone diameter [S/R], ≥24/<24 mm for a 
10 µg disk). However, these breakpoints were established taking into account the plasma levels 
obtaine
d with the European dosing regimen. Given the high plasma trough levels (>100 µg/mL) 
achieved within 24 hours using the fusidic acid loading dose regimen, and the results of a disk 
versus broth correlation analysis where applying breakpoints of <1 µg/ml (>22 mm) for S and >4 
µg/ml (<19 mm) for R provided 99.9% absolute intermethod categorical agreement ( Jones 2010 ),

10.5.2  Local Laboratory Storage of All Isolates  
All Baseline and any subsequent isolates will be stored frozen at ≤ -70°C ( -20°C is acceptable for 
a period of no more than 35 days if a -70°C freezer is not available) in pathogen -appropriate media. 
The Central Laboratory will provide storage media in cryovials for isolate re tention. Procedures 
related to freezing and storage of isolates are described in the Laboratory Manual.  
After submission of an isolate to the Central Laboratory, frozen backup isolates should be 
maintained at the local laboratory until the end of the study .

detail ing han dling and  shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3931] , isolate submission forms, shippi[INVESTIGATOR_35275], and 
pre-printed air bills for sending strains to the Central Laboratory . When a shipment of isolates  is 
to be initiated, the isolates should be sub -cultured from the frozen sto rage cryovials, grown 
overnight on routine laboratory media and inspected for purity after 24 hours incubation .  
Organism name s (as reported by [CONTACT_12082])  and the accession numbers of any isolates  
sent to the Central Microbiology Laboratory will  be recorded in the eCRF.  If organism 
identifications from the local and Central Laboratories are discrepant, or if the Central Laboratory 
is unable to recover any isolates from the material received, the local laboratory will be requested 
to ship another sub-cultured specimen.

Safety assessments will include attention to relevant changes in physical examinations, vital signs, 
and safety laboratory tests that are identified as occurring after the ICF is signed.  
12.1 Adverse Events  
An “adverse event” is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a study drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  An AE can  be a clinical event in the form of 
signs, symptoms, disease, or laboratory or physiological observations occurring in a human being 
participating in a clinical study with CEM -102, regardless of causal relationship. A “pre -existing” 
condition is one that i s present prior to study drug administration and is reported as part of the 
subject ’s medical history.  A pre -existing condition should be reported as an AE only if the 
frequency, intensity, or character of the pre -existing condition worsens during the cou rse of the 
study.  
Laboratory abnormalities are not considered AEs unless they are associated with clinical 
signs or symptoms or require medical intervention.  However, a clinically significant laboratory 
abnormality (e.g. detected on clinical chemistry, coa gulation, or hematology) that is independent 
from the underlying medical condition and that requires medical or surgical intervention or leads 
to study drug interruption or discontinuation will usually be considered an AE.  
A constellation of signs and sym ptoms associated with an underlying etiology should be reported 
as the unifying event (for example, cough, fever, rhinorrhea, and malaise due to a cold should be 
reported as ‘viral syndrome’).     
In general, lack of efficacy/clinical failure is captured a s an efficacy measure and will not be 
considered an AE.  However, clinical failure that results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_881097]/SAEs.   
12.1.1  Recording of Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be collected following signing of the ICF through discharg e from the study. 
In addition, the Investigator should seek to elicit any clinical or objective reactions by [CONTACT_523695] (e.g. “How have you been feeling?)  and, as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148]. Information 
on all AEs should be recorded on the eCRF.  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and results of 
diagnostic procedures performed because of an AE should be grouped together and recorded as a 
single diagnosis. The component parts of the diagnosis may be listed for verification. If the AE is 
a laborat ory abnormality that is part of a clinical condition or syndrome, it should be recorded as 
the syndrome or diagnosis rather than the individual laboratory abnormality.  
To avoid vague, ambiguous, or colloquial expressions, all AEs should be recorded in stan dard 
medical terminology on the eCRF and on the medical record rather than in the subject ’s own 
words. Each AE will also be described in terms of duration (start and stop date), severity, 
association with the study drug, action(s) taken, and outcome.  
CEM-102 Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Protocol CE06- 302 
07 July 2015 Confidential Page 51 of 70  12.1.2 Severity of Adverse Events 
Adverse event severity will be graded in accordance with the criteria of the Adult Toxicity Table 
(Modified) from the NIH/National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/Division of 
Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), November 2007 Adult Toxicity assessment table 
(Appendix A ).   
Mild: Transient or mild discomfort; no medical intervention/therapy required. 
Moderate: Mild to moderate limitation in activity - some assistance may be needed; no or 
minimal medical intervention/therapy required. 
Severe: Marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; medical 
intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9841]. 
When changes in the severity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum 
severity for the experience that day should be noted.  If the severity assessment changes over a 
number of days, then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates). 
12.1.[ADDRESS_1231695] make an assessment of the relationship of the event to the study 
drug as: 
 Unr elated  (there is not a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event) 
 R elated ( there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event.  “Reasonable 
possibility” means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study 
drug
 and the AE) 
12.1.4 Action Taken 
For each AE, the action(s) taken will be recorded (more than 1 may be recorded) as follows: 
 No a ction taken 
 Non -pharmacologic treatment 
 P harmacologic treatment 
 S tudy drug discontinued 
 W ithdrawn from study 
 Ne w or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_881098] -102 Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Protocol CE06 -302 
07 July 2015  Confidential  Page 52 of 70 12.1.5  Outcome  
For each AE, the outcome will be recorded as either:  
 Recovered  
 Ongoing  
 Death  
 Unknown  
12.2 Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes:  
 Death  
“Death” is  an outcome and is NOT the AE. In the event of death, the cause of death  should 
be recorded as the AE. The on ly exception is “sudden death” when the cause is unknown.  
 Life-threatening experience  
An AE is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor , 
it places the subject  at immediate risk of death.  It does not include an AE  or suspected 
adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more serious form, might have caused death.  
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. A “planned”

Reports of overdose (with or without an AE), inadvertent or accidental exposure, and pregnancy 
should be forwarded in the same time frame as an SAE. 
Overdose occurs when a patient is administered or has taken a dose greater than the intended or 
scheduled dose specified by [CONTACT_760]. 
All pregnancies occurring during the study must be followed for information regarding the course 
of pregnancy, delivery, and condition of the newborn. Follow-up should be provided by [CONTACT_881139] a timely manner.

A copy of the initial SAE r eport must be received within 1 business day. 
All other SAEs and other reportable events will be forwarded to the Medical Monitor within 1 
business day. 
The SAE report should provide as much of the required information as is available at the time.  
The following minimum information is required for reporting an SAE: subject identification, 
reporting source, causality, and an event outcome. Supplemental information may be transmitted 
using a follow-up report and should not delay the initial report. CEM-[ADDRESS_1231697] the investigational site to solicit additional information or to follow up on

As with all AEs (Section 12.1.3 ) , the report must also include an assessment of whether there is a 
re
asonable possibility that the study drug caused the event (i.e. whether the event is related or 
unrelated to study drug) .  “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study drug and the AE. 
If there is any doubt whether the information constitutes an SAE, the information will be treated 
as an SAE for the purposes of this protocol.

As a non -randomized, single -arm study, there will be no formal statistical analyses. This study is 
not powered for inferential statistical analyses , and no formal hypothesis testing will be conducted. 
Safety and efficacy will be d escriptive. Clinical outcome will be reported as the proportion of 
subjects meeting criteria of clinical success.  
All safety data will be summarized using the Safety analysis set. Adverse events will be coded 
with the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Acti vities (MedDRA®). The number and proportion 
of subjects having treatment -emergent AEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_7204] 
(SOC) and preferred term, severity , and relationship to study drug.  
Since this is a non -randomized, open -label, single -arm study, interim data may be summarized and 
reported, as needed, prior to database lock.  
Details of the analysis will be provided in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).   
14.1 Efficacy Analyses  
The primary endpoint will be the proportion of subjects in the  ITT analysis set who meet all the 
criteria for clinical success at the 6 -Month Visit.   
Clinical success is defined for subjects who meet  all of the following  criteria : 
 Subject was not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_881100] -qualifying orthopedic infect ion 
at any point between enrollment and the 6 -Month Visit  
 Subject did not undergo a definitive surgical procedure (such as amputation) at any point 
between enrollment and the 6 -Month Visit  
 No additional antibiotics (after completion of the companion antibi otics) are required for 
treatment of the orthopedic infection d ue to the inclusionary pathogen  
 Wound is closed, or the open area decreased in size (L x W) and, if a skin graft was done, 
the graft remains viable without evidence of infection  
 No purulent discharge from the surgical wound , or new or recurring sinus tract  
 No worsening of redness, tenderness , or swelling at the primary infection site  
 No bacteremia of the inclusionary pathogen at any point between e nrollment and the 6 -
Month Visit  
Clinical failure is defined as  follows : 
 Not meeting all criteria for clinical success  
 Death ( due to the primary infection)  
 Discontinuation of study drug due to an AE and the requirement of additional antibiotics 
for tre atment of the primary infection  
CEM -102 Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Protocol CE06 -302 
07 July 2015  Confidential  Page 56 of 70  Use o f a concomitant antibiotic to which the inclusionary pathogen is susceptible for > 10 
days on any occasion, or for > 2 co urses during any 6 -month period  
Indeterminate:  
 Subject withdraws consent  
 Subject is lost to follow -up 
Investigators will evaluate and p rovide documentation of each subject for a clinically meaningful 
difference in each subject’s response prior to making a determination of treatment failure for the 
primary study endpoint.  
The secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows:  
 Proportion of subje cts in the ITT analysis set who meet all criteria for clinical success, as 
defined above, at the 9 -Month, 12 -Month, 15 -Month, 18 -Month , 21-Month, and

CONFIDENTIAL  Page  5 19 October 2017  1. INTRODUCTION  
This document describes the statistical methods and data presentations to be used in the summary and 
analysis of  efficacy and  safety data from Protocol CE06 -302.  Background information is provided for the 
overall study design and objectives.  The reader is referred to the study prot ocol and electronic case report 
forms (e CRFs) for details of study conduct and data collection, and to the Pharmacokinetics (PK) Report 
for the analysis of plasma concentrations of C EM-102. 
1.1. STUDY OVERVIEW  
Protocol CE06 -302 is a  phase 2/3, prospective, open- label, non- randomized, single -arm trial to evaluate 
the safety and effectiveness of CEM- [ADDRESS_1231718] a staphylococcal infection and discuss wi th the medical monitor for approval of enrollment.  
 
This study comprises two parts: Part A (enrollment through the 6- month visit) and Part B ([ADDRESS_1231719]-enrollment). In Part A, all subjects will receive [ADDRESS_1231720] completing Part A for clinical response at the 6 -month visit (primary endpoint). 
For Part B, a subject who completes Part A and, in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], requires continued suppressive therapy, may continue to receive C EM-102. Alternatively, if the Investigator considers the 
infection resolved and that no further antibiotic therapy is required, study drug will be discontinued and 
the subject followed  for evidence of relapse until the end of study (EOS ; 24 months ). 
 
Durin g the first 6 months of treatment, study Part A, subjects wil l be monitored monthly (±1 week) for 
safety and clinical response to CEM- 102. During study Part B, s ubjects will be monitored every 3 months 
(±2 weeks) until the EOS  Visit (24 months).

c. Study Day [ADDRESS_1231722] day of dosing with CEM -102. 
d. Subjects who discontin ue CEM -102 because of an adverse event (AE) or clinical failure should have a study visit around the t ime of drug discontinuation and will continue to be followed, as needed, 
for appropriate observation of treatment -related AEs until AEs have resolved or s tabiliz ed. If a subject withdraws from the study at any time, for any reason, the EOS visit will be performed around that 
time. Those subjects who continue CEM -102 until the Month 24 visit will undergo the assessments/procedures for the EOS visit. At study  closure, at the discretion of the Investigator, subjects may be 
rolled over into an expanded access protocol to receive chronic suppressive CEM -102 therapy.  
e. If clinically indicated, microbiological samples (tissue surrounding the foreign material, syno vial fluid, bone, etc.) obtained durin g the study should be submitted to the local laboratory for aerobic and 
anaerobic culture and susceptibility testing, including to CEM -102. All isolated bacteria are  to be sub -cultured and shipped to the central microb iology laboratory for organism confirmation and 
confirmatory susceptibility testing.  
f. Vital sign measurements include height, weight, temperature, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and blood pressure. Results are  to be recorded in the eCRF. 
g. Limited physic al examination may include HEENT, cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, skin, lymph nodes, musculos keletal, and extremities, among others. Results are to be documented in 
source and recorded in the eCRF.  
h. Examination of the infected area will incl ude the following assessments: pain, erythema, mobility, joint stability, wound clos ure, wound drainage, and weight bearing [for back and lower extremity 
infections]. The Investigator will state whether the infected area seems to have impr oved, deteriorated, or remained unchanged. Results are to be documented in the source and recorded in the eCRF.  
i. Safety laboratory assessments will be performed at the local laboratory and will include the following: serum chemistry (A LT, A ST, alkaline phosphatase [ALP], total and direct bilirubin, blood urea 
nitrogen [BUN], creatinine, albumin, total protein, sodium, total carbon dioxide, glucose, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphorus, and CPK). For female subjects of child bearing potential, a urine or 
serum pregnanc y test will be performed at Sc reening and will be repeated at subsequent visit s per Investigator’s discretion  . 
j. Laboratory measurements of markers of inflammation will be performed at the local laboratory and will include the followin g: hematology (comp lete blood count [CBC] with differential), erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate [ESR], and C -reactive protein [CRP]). Laboratory measurements of markers of i nflammation obtained on the day of a surgery or debridement  should be performed before the 
procedure when  possible, because levels of these mark ers are known to increase after surgery.

4. GENERAL STATISTICAL CO NSIDERATIONS  
4.1. SAMPLE SIZE AND P OWER  
As a non- randomized, single -arm study, there will be no formal statistical analyses. This study is not 
powered for inferential statistical analyses.  Thirty subjects will be enrolled at up to [ADDRESS_1231724] relationship to study medication.   
4.3.5.  Derived  and Transformed Data   
For purposes of analysis, subjects who are deemed a clinical failure  (see section 4.3.8 ) due to use of a 
concomitant antibiotic  to which the inclusionary pathogen is susceptible for >10 days on any occasion, or 
for >2 courses during any 6- month period, will be programmatically assigned an indeterminate response.  
Signs and symptoms data from the primary infection exam wil l be combined to derive a composite symptom 
and function score (see section 4.3.8 ).  
4.3.6.  Imputation  of Incomplete Dates  
An incomplete date is any date for which either the day, month or year is unknown, but all t hree fields are 
not unknown. An incomplete date occurs when the exact date an event occurred or ended cannot be obtained 
from a subject.  For many of the analyses, a complete date is necessary in order to determine if the event 
should be included in the an alysis (i.e., if the event is treatment -emergent) or to establish the duration of an 
event.  In such cases, incomplete dates will be imputed.   
For purposes of imputation of incomplete star t/stop dates for adverse events and prior/concomitant 
medications , missing days will be imputed as the day component of Day 1 ; missing months/years will be 
imputed as the month/year of Day 1 (defined in section 4.3.8 ).   
All events with an incomplete end date are assumed to h ave ended on or before the day the form was 
completed. For scheduled visit  data, missing dates will be imputed based on the nominal visit day relative 
to Day 1.  For other data, if the month/year is the same as the Day 1 month/year then the date will be set to

CONFIDENTIAL  Page  11 19 October 2017  the date of Day 1.  In other cases, missing days will be imputed as t he day component of Day 1; missing 
months/years will be imputed as the month/year of Day 1.  A list of incomplete and imputed dates will be 
prepared by [CONTACT_881144](s) and will be submitted for review by [CONTACT_105819] p roject manager and sponsor.  
4.3.7.  By-Study Visit Displays  
Visits will be presented according to the nominal visit  (efficacy analyses) or analysis visit (safety analyses)  
as obtained from the e CRF. For v endor data, the collection date  will be used to assign the v isit. 
For safety analyses, all data, including scheduled and unscheduled visits , will be windowed to  an analysis 
visit as follows:  
Analysis Visit  Study Day  
Baseline  Last non -missing value obtained prior to or on the 
day of initiation of study treatment (CEM -102) 
Day [ADDRESS_1231725] non- missing value obtained prior to or on 
the day of initiation of study treatment ( CEM -102).  Because time of initiation of tr eatment is not captured, 
events defined by [CONTACT_881145]- eligible.  
All pathogens recovered from cultures performed prior to first dose will be considered baseline pathogens . 
Baseline values may come from scheduled or unscheduled visit s.   
Study Day   
The date  vital signs were collected at the nominal Day 1 visit (a surrogate for the date of first dose of study 
drug) will be considered as study day 1, and the day before vital signs were collected at the nominal Day 1 
visit will be study day - 1. 
If an event dat e is on or after the Day 1 date , then Study Day is calculated as:   
• Study Day = event date – date of Day 1+1 
If an event date is prior to the date of Day 1, then Stud y Day is calculated as:   
• Study Day =  event date – date of Day [ADDRESS_1231726] that the local laboratory 
resend the isolate. The central laboratory identification of genus and species is used for analysis except in 
those cases where there is no central laboratory determination of genus and species. In this case, the local 
laboratory determination is used for pathogen identification.  
The following organisms recovered from baseline specimens obtained during surgery, biopsy or drainage 
procedures (e.g. tissue biopsy, bone biopsy, joint aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337] , etc. ) or from blood are considered inclusionary 
pathogens: Staphylococcus aureus  (including both methicillin -susceptible S. aureus  [MSSA] and 
methicillin -resistant S. aureus  [MRSA]), and coagulase- negative staphylococci (CoNS) such as 
Staphylococcus  epi[INVESTIGATOR_77353], Staphylococcus hominis , or Staphylococcus haemolyticus .  Other pathogens 
include: Streptococcus pyogenes , Streptococcus agalactiae , Streptococcus dysgalactiae , Entero coccus  
faecalis, Enterococcus faecium , Corynebacterium  striatum , and Propi[INVESTIGATOR_76494] . All isolates, 
including other bacteria not listed here , will be reviewed by [CONTACT_17190] a case -by-case basis to confirm  
BJI pathogen status. Fungal isolates ( Candida albicans ) will not be considered pathogens. 
S. aureus  will be considered methicillin -resistant (MRSA) based on oxacillin susceptibility results (MIC 
≥4 µg/ml; resistant)  from the central laboratory. If isolate test results are not available from the central

Investigator Assessment of Clinical Response:   
Clinical success is defined to occur when subjects meet all of the following criteria:  
• Subject was not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_881100]- qualifying orthopedic infection at any 
point between enrollment and the 6- Month Visit  
• Subject did not undergo a definitive surgical procedure (such as amputation) at any point 
between enrollment and the 6- Month Visit  
• No additional antibiotics (after completion of companion antibiotics) are required for treatment of the orthopedic infection due to the inclusionary pathogen 
• Wound is closed, or the open area  decreased in size (L x W) and, if a skin graft was done, the 
graft remains viable without evidence of infection  
• No purulent discharge from the surgical wound, or new or recurring sinus tract  
• No worsening of redness, tenderness, or swelling at the primary infection site  
• No bacteremia of the inclusionary pathogen at any point between enrollment and the 6- Month 
Visit  
Clinical failure  is defined to occur when subjects meet any of the following criteria:  
• Failure to meet all criteria for clinical success  
• Death ( due to the primary infection)  
• Discontinuation of study drug due to an AE and the requirement of additional antibiotics for treatment of the primary infection  
An indeterminate response is defined to occur when subjects meet any of the following criteria:  
• Subject withdraws consent  
• Subject is lost to follow -up 
For purposes of analysis, subjects who are deemed a clinical failure due to use of a concomitant antibiotic  
to which the inclusionary pathogen is susceptible for >10 days on any occasion, or for > 2 courses during 
any 6 -month period, will be programmatically assigned an indeterminate response.

Primary Infection Exam  (Signs and Symptoms) : Change from Previous Visit  
Change from previous visit  for a given endpoint is defined as a qualitative  comparison between the 
evaluation during the previous visit to the evaluation at the current visit. The possible responses are:  
 New                -  The sign/symptom was not present during the previous visit and is present at the           
                           current  visit  
 No change       - The severity of the sign/symptom has not changed from the previous visit  
 Improved        -  There is improvement from the previous visit, but the sign/symptom ha s not been  
               resolved  
 Worsening       - The sign/symptom has gotten worse from the previous visit  
 Not a ssessed    - The sign/symptom was not assessed during the current visit  
 Resolved          -  The sign/symptom has been resolved as of the current visit  
 
Primary Infection Exam (Signs and Symptoms): Composite Symptom and Function Score  
Data from the following signs and symptoms will be combined to derive a composite sc ore: 
Swelling/Edema, Warmth, Redness, Pain at Rest, Pain with Movement, Decreased Mobility, and Limited 
Weight Bearing. The score will be calculated according to the  following  algorithm : 
 
• Each symptom with a baseline evaluation of “Present” will be assigned a value of 7. Each 
symptom with a baseline evaluation of “Absent” or “Not Assessed” will be assigned a value of 0.

to which the inclusionary pathogen is susceptible for >10 days on any occasion, or for >[ADDRESS_1231735] of the study or the planned analysis are anticipated.  Should any 
deviations from the analyses specified in the authorized statistical analysis plan arise, such deviations will 
be documented in the final clinical study report.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page  21 19 October 2017  11. PROGRAMMING CONVENTIONS  
• Page orientation, margins, and fonts: Summary tables, listings, and figures will appear in landscape 
orientation.  There should be a minimum of a 1.25” boundary on the upper (bound) edge, and a 
minimum of a 1.0” boundary on the remaining three edges.  Output should be printed in Courier New 
with a point size of 8.  Titles may be printed using a larger font (e.g., Arial point size 10).  
• Identification of analysis population: Every summary table and figure should clearly specify the analysis population being summarized.  Listings will be prepared for all enrolled subjects.  
• Group headers: In the summary tables, the group headers will identi fy the dose cohort  and the within -
group sample size for the indicated analysis population.  Of note, the header’s sample size does not 
necessarily equal the number of subjects actually summarized within any given summary module; 
some subjects in the analysis population may have missing values and thus may not be summarized.  
• Suppression of percentages corresponding to null categories: When count data are presented as category frequencies and corresponding percentages, the percent should be suppressed w hen the 
count is zero in order to draw attention to the non- zero counts.  
• Presentation of sample sizes: Summary modules should indicate, in one way or another, the number 
of subjects actually contributing to the summary statistics presented in any given sum mary module.  
As mentioned above, this may be less than the number of subjects in the analysis population.  
♦ In the quantitative modules describing continuous variables (and thus presenting sample size, means, and standard deviations), the sample size should be the number of non- missing 
observations  
♦ For categorical variables that are presented in frequency tables, the module should present the 
total count in addition to the count in each category.  Percentages should be calculated using this 
total as the denominator, and the percentage corresponding to the sum itself (that is, 100%) 
should be presented so as to indicate clearly to a reviewer the method of calculation.  
• Sorting: Listings will be sorted by  [CONTACT_18022], dose cohort , and date, if applicable.  Li stings with 
multiple observations per subject will be sorted by [CONTACT_18022], dose cohort , treatment and date, if 
applicable.  If a listing is sorted in a different manner, a footnote will indicate as such.  
• General formatting rules: Rounding for all var iables will occur only as the last step, immediately prior 
to presentation in listings, tables, and figures.  No intermediate rounding will be performed on derived variables.  The standard rounding practice of rounding numbers ending in 0- 4 down and number s 
ending in 5- 9 up will be employed.   
• The presentation of numerical values will adhere to the following guidelines:  
♦ Raw measurements will be reported to the number of significant digits as captured on the eCRFs.   
♦ Standard deviations will be reported to one decimal place beyond the number of decimal places 
the original parameter is presented.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page  5 04 December  2017  1. INTRODUCTION  
This document describes the statistical methods and data presentations to be used in the summary and 
analysis of  efficacy and  safety data from Protocol CE06 -302.  Background info rmation is provided for the 
overall study design and objectives.  The reader is referred to the study protocol and electronic case report 
forms ( eCRFs) for details of study conduct and data collection , and to the Pharmacokinetics (PK) Report 
for the analys is of plasma concentrations of CEM-102. 
1.1. STUDY OVERVIEW  
Protocol CE06 -302 is a  phase 2/3,  prospective, open -label, non -randomized, single -arm trial to evaluate 
the safety and effectiveness of CEM -[ADDRESS_1231764] a staphylococcal infection and discuss with the medical monitor for approval of enrollment.  
 
This study comprises two parts: Part A (enrollment through the 6 -month visit) and Part B ([ADDRESS_1231765]-enrollment). In Part A, all subjects wil l receive [ADDRESS_1231766] completing Part A for clinical response at the 6 -month visit (primary endpoint). 
For Part B, a subject who completes Part A and, in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], requires co ntinued 
suppressive therapy, may continue to receive CEM -102. Alternatively, if the Investigator considers the 
infection resolved and that no further antibiotic therapy is required, study drug will be discontinued and 
the subject followed  for evidence of r elapse until the end of study (EOS ; 24 months ). 
 
During the first 6 months of treatment, study Part A, subjects wil l be monitored monthly (±1  week) for 
safety and clinical response to CEM -102. During study Part B, s ubjects will be monitored every 3 months 
(±2 weeks) until the EOS  Visit (24 months).

c. Study Day [ADDRESS_1231768] day of dosing with CEM -102. 
d. Subjects who discontinue CEM -102 because of an  adverse event (AE) or clinical failure should have a study visit around the t ime of drug discontinuation and will continue to be followed, as needed, 
for appropriate observation of treatment -related AEs until AEs have resolved or stabiliz ed. If a subject withdraws from the study at any time, for any reason, the EOS visit will be performed around that 
time. Those subjects who continue CEM -102 until the Month 24 visit will undergo the assessments/procedures for the EOS visit. At study closure, at the discret ion of the Investigator, subjects may be 
rolled over into an expanded access protocol to receive chronic suppressive CEM -102 therapy.  
e. If clinically indicated, microbiological samples (tissue surrounding the foreign material, synovial fluid, bone, etc.) obtained durin g the study should be submitted to the local laboratory for aerobic and 
anaerobic culture and susceptibility testing, including to CEM -102. All isolated bacteria are  to be sub -cultured and shipped to the central microbiology laboratory for or ganism confirmation and 
confirmatory susceptibility testing.  
f. Vital sign measurements include height, weight, temperature, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and blood pressure. Results are  to be recorded in the eCRF.  
g. Limited physical examination may inclu de HEENT, cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, skin, lymph nodes, musculos keletal, and extremities, among others. Results are to be documented in 
source and recorded in the eCRF.  
h. Examination of the infected area will include the following assess ments: pain, erythema, mobility, joint stability, wound clos ure, wound drainage, and weight bearing [for back and lower extremity 
infections]. The Investigator will state whether the infected area seems to have impr oved, deteriorated, or remained unchanged . Results are to be documented in the source and recorded in the eCRF.  
i. Safety laboratory assessments will be performed at the local laboratory and will include the following: serum chemistry (A LT, A ST, alkaline phosphatase [ALP], total and direct biliru bin, blood urea 
nitrogen [BUN], creatinine, albumin, total protein, sodium, total carbon dioxide, glucose, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphorus, and CPK). For female subjects of child bearing potential, a urine or 
serum pregnancy test will be performed  at Sc reening and will be repeated at subsequent visit s per Investigator’s discretion  . 
j. Laboratory measurements of markers of inflammation will be performed at the local laboratory and will include the followin g: hematology (complete blood count [CBC] w ith differential), erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate [ESR], and C -reactive protein [CRP]). Laboratory measurements of markers of i nflammation obtained on the day of a surgery or debridement  should be performed before the 
procedure when possible, because level s of these mark ers are known to increase after surgery.

4. GENERAL STATISTICAL CO NSIDERATIONS  
4.1. SAMPLE SIZE AND P OWER  
As a non -randomiz ed, single -arm study, there will be no formal statistical analyses. This study is  not 
powered for inferential statistical analyses.  Thirty subjects will be enrolled at up to [ADDRESS_1231770] relationship to study medicat ion.   
4.3.5.  Derived  and Transformed Data   
For purposes of analysis, subjects who are deemed a clinical failure  (see section 4.3.8 ) due to use of a 
concomitant antibiotic  to which the inclusionary pathogen is susce ptible for >10 days on any occasion, or 
for >2 courses during any 6 -month period, will be programmatically assigned an indeterminate response.  
Signs and symptoms data from the primary infection exam will be combined to derive a composite symptom 
and functi on score (see section 4.3.8 ).  
4.3.6.  Imputation  of Incomplete Dates  
An incomplete date is any date for which either the day, month or year is unknown, but all three fields are 
not unknown. An incomplete date occurs  when the exact date an event occurred or ended cannot be obtained 
from a subject.  For many of the analyses, a complete date is necessary in order to determine if the event 
should be included in the analysis (i.e., if the event is treatment -emergent) or t o establish the duration of an 
event.  In such cases, incomplete dates will be imputed.   
For purposes of imputation  of incomplete star t/stop dates for adverse events and prior/concomitant 
medications , missing days will be imputed as the day component of Day 1; missing months/years will be 
imputed as the month/year of Day 1  (defined in section 4.3.8 ).   
All events with an incomplete end date are assumed to have ended on or before the day the form was 
completed.  For scheduled visit  data, missing dates will be imputed based on the nominal visit day relative 
to Day 1.  For other data, if the month/year is the same as the Day 1 month/year then the date will be set to

CONFIDENTIAL  Page  11 04 December  2017  the date of Day 1.  In other cases, missing days will be imputed as the day component of Day 1; missing 
months/years will be imputed as the month/year of Day 1.  A list of incomplete and imputed dates will be 
prepared by [CONTACT_881144](s) and will be submitted for revi ew by [CONTACT_881166].  
4.3.7.  By-Study Visit Displays  
Visits will be presented according to the nominal visit  (efficacy analyses) or analysis visit (safety analyses)  
as obtained from the eCRF. For v endor data, the collection date  will be used to assign the visit.  
For safety analyses, all data, including scheduled and unscheduled  visits , will be windowed to an analysis 
visit as follows:  
Analysis Visit  Study Day  
Baseline  Last non -missing value obtained prior to or on the 
day of initiation of study treatment (CEM -102) 
Day [ADDRESS_1231771] non-missing value obtained prior to or on 
the day of initiation of study treatment ( CEM -102). Because time of i nitiation of treatment is not captured, 
events defined by [CONTACT_881145] -eligible.  
All pathogens recovered from cultures performed prior to first dose will be considered baseline pathogens . 
Baseline value s may come from scheduled or unscheduled visit s.   
Study Day   
The date  vital signs were collected at the nominal Day 1 visit (a surrogate for the date of first dose of study 
drug) will be considered as study day 1, and the day before vital s igns were collected at the nominal Day 1 
visit will be study day -1. 
If an event dat e is on or after the Day 1 date , then Study Day is calculated as:   
 Study Day = event date – date of Day 1+1  
If an event date is prior to the date of Day 1 , then Study Day i s calculated as:   
 Study Day =  event date  – date of Day [ADDRESS_1231772] that the local laboratory 
resend the isolate. The central laboratory identification of genus and species is used for analysis except in 
those cases where there i s no central laboratory determination of genus and species. In this case, the local 
laboratory determination is used for pathogen identification.  
The following organisms recovered from baseline specimens obtained during surgery, biopsy or drainage 
procedur es (e.g. tissue biopsy, bone biopsy, joint aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337] , etc. ) or from blood  are considered inclusionary 
pathogens: Staphylococcus aureus  (including both methicillin -susceptible S. aureus  [MSSA] and 
methicillin -resistant S. aureus  [MRSA]), and coagulase -negati ve staphylococci (CoNS) such as 
Staphylococcus  epi[INVESTIGATOR_77353] , Staphylococcus hominis , or Staphylococcus haemolyticus .  Other pathogens 
include: Streptococcus pyogenes , Streptococcus agalactiae , Streptococcus dysgalactiae , Enterococcus  
faecalis , Enterococcus faecium , Corynebacterium  striatum , and Propi[INVESTIGATOR_76494] . All isolates, 
including o ther bacteria not listed here, will be reviewed by [CONTACT_17190] a case -by-case basis to confirm  
BJI pathogen status.  Fungal isolates ( Candida albicans ) will not be c onsidered pathogens.  
S. aureus  will be considered methicillin -resistant (MRSA) based on oxacillin susceptibility results (MIC 
≥4 µg/ml; resistant)  from the central laboratory. If isolate test results are not available from the central

MRSA and MSSA will be considered distinct pathogens.  
Investigator Assessment of Clinical Response:   
Clinical success is defined to occur when subjects meet all of the following cr iteria:  
 Subject was not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_881100] -qualifying orthopedic infection at any 
point between enrollment and the 6 -Month Visit  
 Subject did not undergo a definitive surgical procedure (such as amputation) at any point 
between enrol lment and the 6 -Month Visit  
 No additional antibiotics (after completion of companion antibiotics) are required for treatment 
of the orthopedic infection due to the inclusionary pathogen  
 Wound is closed, or the open area decreased in size (L x W) and, if a skin graft was done, the 
graft remains viable without evidence of infection  
 No purulent discharge from the surgical wound, or new or recurring sinus tract  
 No worsening of redness, tenderness, or swelling at the primary infection site  
 No bacteremia of the i nclusionary pathogen at any point between enrollment and the 6 -Month 
Visit  
Clinical failure  is defined to occur when subjects meet any of the following criteria:  
 Failure to meet all criteria for clinical success  
 Death (due to the primary infection)  
 Discont inuation of study drug due to an AE and the requirement of additional antibiotics for 
treatment of the pri mary infection  
An indeterminate response  is defined to occur when subjects meet any of the following criteria:  
 Subject withdraws consent  
 Subject is lo st to follow -up 
For purposes of analysis, subjects who are deemed a clinical failure due to use of a concomitant antibiotic  
to which the inclusionary pathogen is susceptible for >10 days on any occasion, or for >2 courses during 
any 6 -month period, will be  programmatically assigned an indeterminate response.

Primary Infection Exam  (Signs and Symptoms) : Change from Previous Visit   
Change from previou s visit  for a given endpoint is defined as a qualitative  comparison between the 
evaluation during the previous visit to the evaluation at the current visit. The possible responses are:  
 New                 - The sign/symptom was not present during the previ ous visit and is present at the           
                           current  visit 
 No change       - The severity of the sign/symptom has not changed from the previous visit  
 Improved         - There is improvement from the previous visit, but the sign/symp tom ha s not been  
               resolved  
 Worsening       - The sign/symptom has gotten worse from the previous visit  
 Not a ssessed    - The sign/symptom was not assessed during the current visit  
 Resolved          - The sign/symptom has been resolved as of  the current visit  
 
Primary Infection Exam (Signs and Symptoms): Composite Symptom and Function Score  
Data from the following signs and symptoms will be combined to derive a composite score: 
Swelling/Edema, Warmth, Redness, Pain at Rest, Pain with Movement , Decreased Mobility, and Limited 
Weight Bearing. The score will be calculated according to the  following  algorithm : 
 
 Each symptom with a baseline evaluation of “Present” will be assigned a value of 7. Each 
symptom with a baseline evaluation of “Absent” or  “Not Assessed” will be assigned a value of 0.

calculated by [CONTACT_881146] a cumulative manner up to the month 
being reported . The  score  will be adjusted according to change from previous visit result as 
follows:  
o New  – increase by 7.0 
o No Change – no change  
o Improved – decrease by 0.5  
o Worsening – increase by 0.5  
o Not Assessed  – no change  
o Resolved  – decrease to 0  
 At any given timepoint, the co mposite score is calculated by [CONTACT_881167].  
Treatment -emergent Adverse Event  
Any adverse event reported on the eCRF that occurs on or after the receipt of study drug  (Day 1)  through 
[ADDRESS_1231773] dose date of 
study drug administration. If the relevant baseline assessment  is missing, then a ny graded abnormality (i.e., 
at least Grade 1) is considered to be treatment -emergent.  
Laboratory abnormalities  will be graded according to the Division of Microbiology and Infection Diseases 
(DMID) 1 -4 scale. Values not considered Grade 1 or higher will b e classified as “ Normal ”. Grading 
guidel ines are listed in Appendix I.  
Antibiotic and Non -antibiotic Medications  
Antibiotic and non -antibiotic medications are recorded on separate f orms of the eCRF.  Reasons for 
antibiotic medications are recorded on the eCRF as therapy for the primary infection before enrollment, 
companion antibiotic therapy after enrollment, adjunctive antibiotic therapy for co -infections, or therapy 
for unrelated infections.   
Prior  and Concomitant Medications  
A prior medication  is defin ed as a ny medication taken prior to the date of first dose of study drug ( Study 
Day 1 ). A concomitant medication (including companion and adjunctive antibiotic  therapy ) is defined as 
any medication that has a stop date that is on or after the date of first  dose of study drug, or is ongoing.  A 
medication can be considered both prior and concomitant.  
4.4. TIMING  OF ANALYSES  
An interim analysis will be conducted once the last subject completes the [ADDRESS_1231774] completes or discontinues the study, and the resulting clinical 
database has been cleaned, quality checked, and locked.

site or blood culture s will be summarized . MRSA and MSSA are consid ered distinct pathogens.  The number 
and percentage of subjects with each pathogen  will be presented by [CONTACT_881148] . The same pathogen identified from both the culture of a BJI specimen  and/or blood culture will 
be counted only once in the summary.  
A listing will be provided that includes all culture results  and will indicate the specimen collection date, 
study day, type of specimen, Gram stain results, organism name (local and central laboratory identification), 
and a flag for whether or not each isolate is considered a baseline  or post -baseline  pathogen. A by-subject 
listing of isolate  MICs, and disk diffusion zone diameters , and susceptibilities  (if applicable)  will also be 
provided . Isolates  are considered suscept ible ( S), intermediate ( I), or resistant ( R) to CEM -102 according

6.1.4.  Concomitant  Medications  
Prior and concomitant medications will be coded using the World Heath Organization (WHO) Drug 
dictionary (September 2015).  Antibiotic and non -antibiotic c oncomitant medica tions will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_881149].  Antibiotic concomitant medications will be summarized 
separately for primary infections before enrollment, companion antibiotics, co -infections, and unrelated or 
other antibiotics.   Prior and concomitant medications will be presented in a data listing.  
6.2. EFFICACY  
The counts  and percentages  of subjects who have clinical success, clinical failure, and an indeterminate 
clinical response , and reasons for clini cal failure and indeterminate  response  will be summarized at the [ADDRESS_1231776], binomial 95% 
confidence interval s will be provided for the percentage  of subjects who have clinical success at each visit.  
Early termina tion results will be carried forward to all subsequent visits for subjects who did not complete 
CEM -[ADDRESS_1231777]  for composite symptom and function score will be 
performed.  For this analysis, an indeterminate resp onse will be considered a failure.  
Wound status will be characterized by [CONTACT_881150]/symptoms from the primary infection exam: Sinus tract 
formation, open wound, and drainage. A subject will be considered to have a sign/symptom at a given visit 
if it is n ewly present or not resolved. The counts and percentages of subjects who have each sign/symptom 
will be presented separately. Additionally, the counts and percentages of subjects who have none of the 
three signs/symptoms and one or more of the signs/sympto ms will be presented.

any TEAE with severe intensity , any TEAE related to study drug, any TEAE leading to study 
discontinuation, any TEAE leading to study drug discontinuation , any treatment -emergent  serious adverse 
event (SAE), any treatment -emergent  SAE related to study drug, any treatment -emergent  SAE leading to 
study discontinuation, and any treatment -emergent  SAE leading to study drug discontinuation  will be 
provided . 
Summaries of treatment -emergent AEs will include an y AEs starting on or after the initiation of study 
treatment through [ADDRESS_1231779]  severity, TEAEs related to study drug  (overall and by [CONTACT_617246]) , TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation of study or study drug,  treatment -emergent  SAEs and t reatment -emergent SAEs leading to 
death will be presented.    
All adverse event data list ings will include the individual subjects showing both verbatim and preferred 
terms and system organ classification.  All adverse events that occurred prior to the initiation of the study 
treatment will be excluded from the tables.  All adverse events will  be included in the listings.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page  21 04 December  2017  11. PROGRAMMING CONVENTIONS  
 Page orientation, margins, and fonts: Summary tables, listings, and figures will appear in landscape 
orientation.  There should be a minimum of a 1.25” boundary on the upper (bound) edge, and a 
minimum of a 1.0” boundary on the remaini ng three edges.  Output should be printed in Courier New 
with a point size of 8.  Titles may be printed using a larger font (e.g., Arial point size 10).  
 Identification of analysis population: Every summary table and figure should clearly specify the 
analys is population being summarized.  Listings will be prepared for all enrolled subjects.  
 Group headers: In the summary tables, the group headers will identify the dose cohort  and the within -
group sample size for the indicated analysis population.  Of note, th e header’s sample size does not 
necessarily equal the number of subjects actually summarized within any given summary module; 
some subjects in the analysis population may have missing values and thus may not be summarized.  
 Suppression of percentages corres ponding to null categories: When count data are presented as 
category frequencies and corresponding percentages, the percent should be suppressed when the 
count is zero in order to draw attention to the non -zero counts.  
 Presentation of sample sizes: Summar y modules should indicate, in one way or another, the number 
of subjects actually contributing to the summary statistics presented in any given summary module.  
As mentioned above, this may be less than the number of subjects in the analysis population.  
 In the quantitative modules describing continuous variables (and thus presenting sample size, 
means, and standard deviations), the sample size should be the number of non -missing 
observations  
 For categorical variables that are presented in frequency tables, the module should present the 
total count in addition to the count in each category.  Percentages should be calculated using this 
total as the denominator, and the percentage corresponding to the sum itself (that is, 100%) 
should be presented so as to indi cate clearly to a reviewer the method of calculation.  
 Sorting: Listings will be sorted by  [CONTACT_18022],  dose cohort , and date, if applicable.  Listings with 
multiple observations per subject will be sorted by [CONTACT_18022], dose cohort , treatment and da te, if 
applicable.  If a listing is sorted in a different manner, a footnote will indicate as such.  
 General formatting rules: Rounding for all variables will occur only as the last step, immediately prior 
to presentation in listings, tables, and figures.  No intermediate rounding will be performed on derived 
variables.  The standard rounding practice of rounding numbers ending in 0 -4 down and numbers 
ending in 5 -9 up will be employed.   
 The presentation of numerical values will adhere to the following guid elines:  
 Raw measurements will be reported to the number of significant digits as captured on the eCRFs.   
 Standard deviations will be reported to one decimal place beyond the number of decimal places 
the original parameter is presented.

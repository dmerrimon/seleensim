Context:   
Neurodevelopmental disability is now recognized as the most common long-term 
complication after cardiac surgery in neonates. White matter injury is the most common 
finding on neuroimaging and pathological studies in this population. Delayed brain maturation

important mechanism underlying the risk of neurodevelopmental disability. Progesterone has 
been shown to be neuroprotective by [CONTACT_175389].

PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS 
 
Study Title Randomized Trial of Maternal Progesterone Therapy to 
Improve Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in Infants with 
Congenital Heart Disease  
Funder Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_175340], approximately 1 in every 100 newborns is 
diagnosed with congenital heart disease (CHD). Many of these 
newborns (25%-35%) will require either corrective or palliative open 
heart surgery. As recently as the 1960’s, only 20% of newborns with 
critical CHD survived to adulthood. Today, thanks to better 
diagnostic technologies and methods (including prenatal 
diagnosis), advances in surgery, and improved postoperative care, 
early survival is over 90%. However, with improved early outcomes 
has come the sobering recognition that there is an ongoing risk of 
late mortality, as well as significant morbidity for these children. In 
particular, neurodevelopmental disability is now recognized as the 
most common complication of critical CHD (i.e. those patients 
requiring cardiac surgery in infancy) and has the most negative 
impact on quality of life, academic performance and opportunity for 
independence as an adult.  
The altered fetal hemodynamics secondary to CHD lead to 
decreased blood flow and/or oxygen delivery to the fetal brain. In 
turn, this impairment in blood flow and oxygenation results in 
impaired brain growth and altered structural and cellular maturation, 
particularly of the white matter. Fetal MRI studies have shown that 
during the third trimester, normally a time of rapid brain growth and 
development, brains of infants with CHD fail to grow at the same 
rate as the brains of fetuses without CHD. This growth delay results 
in microcephaly, immature cellular elements of the white matter and 
decreased cortical folding at birth. It has been demonstrated that 
brain immaturity at birth is a primary major risk factor underlying the 
hypoxic-ischemic white matter brain injury and subsequent 
neurodevelopmental disability seen in over 50% of infants following 
surgery for CHD. In addition, there is increasing evidence in the 
CHD population that even late pre-term birth (prior to 39 weeks GA) 
is associated with increased mortality, increased peri-operative 
morbidity, and worse neurodevelopmental outcomes. 
Progesterone is an essential hormone in the occurrence and 
maintenance of pregnancy. Progesterone administration has also 
been shown to be neuroprotective in a variety of clinical situations, 
including traumatic brain injury (TBI).   Sex steroid hormones, 
including progesterone, are critically involved in axonal myelination, 
forming the basis of white matter connectivity in the central nervous 
system (CNS). Progesterone and its metabolites not only promote 
the viability and regeneration of neurons, but also act on myelinating 
    
   
   x
glial cell oligodendrocytes in the CNS and play an important role in 
the formation of myelin sheaths. Progesterone has also been shown 
to increase myelination and enhance maturation of immature 
oligodendrocytes progenitor cells to mature oligodendrocytes, 
which are more resistant to hypoxic/ischemic injury. Therapeutic 
administration of progesterone has also been demonstrated to 
prevent preterm birth. Thus, there are two potential mechanisms by 
[CONTACT_175390]-natal progesterone therapy may improve 
neurodevelopmental outcomes in neonates with CHD: 1) a direct 
neuroprotective effect, and 2) decreasing the occurrence of pre-
term birth. 
Study Objective(s) Primary   
Develop preliminary evidence to support a multi-institutional study 
to determine whether, in women carrying fetuses (maternal-fetal 
dyad) with CHD, prophylactic vaginal natural progesterone therapy 
is neuroprotective, and compared to placebo improves 
neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 months of age.

2. increases myelination during fetal brain development, 
3. reduces pre-operative brain white matter injury, and 
4. reduces post-operative white matter injury.

Statistical And Analytic 
Plan The primary analysis will be intent-to-treat (ITT) and will 
estimate differences between group means and their associated

clinical relevance, the study is primarily designed to provide an 
estimate of possible effect sizes for the Bayley-III Motor Scale at [ADDRESS_204657] sizes 
for the Bayley-III Cognitive and Language Scales at 18 months, M-
CHAT, and ITSEA, as well as total maturation score (TMS) and 
volume of myelinated white matter (VMWM).The analysis will use a 
two-sided two-sample T-interval (estimation) or T-test (hypothesis 
testing). The confidence level will be set at 90% and the Type I error 
at 10%. Normality will be assessed and a transformation, or 
alternatively a non-parametric test, will be used if needed.

1    BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Introduction 
In the [LOCATION_002], approximately 1 in every 100 newborns is diagnosed with congenital 
heart disease (CHD). Many of these newborns (25%-35%) will require either corrective or 
palliative open heart surgery. As recently as the 1960’s, only 20% of newborns with critical 
CHD survived to adulthood. Today, thanks to better diagnostic technologies and methods 
(including prenatal diagnosis), advances in surgery, and improved postoperative care, early 
survival is over 90%. However, with improved early outcomes has come the sobering 
recognition that there is an ongoing risk of late mortality as well as significant morbidity for 
these children. In particular, neurodevelopmental disability is now recognized as the most 
common complication of critical CHD (i.e. those patients requiring cardiac surgery in infancy) 
and has the most negative impact on quality of life, academic performance and opportunity 
for independence as an adult.  
Altered fetal hemodynamics secondary to presence of CHD may cause decreased blood 
flow and/or oxygen delivery to the fetal brain. In turn, this impairment in blood flow and 
oxygenation results in impaired brain growth and altered structural and cellular maturation, 
particularly of the white matter. Studies using fetal brain MRI have shown that during the third 
trimester, normally a time of rapid brain growth and development, the brains of infants with 
CHD fail to grow at the same rate as the brains of fetuses without CHD; resulting in 
microcephaly, immature cellular elements of the white matter and decreased cortical folding 
at birth. It has been demonstrated that brain immaturity at birth is a primary major risk factor 
underlying the hypoxic-ischemic white matter brain injury and subsequent 
neurodevelopmental disability seen in over 50% of infants following for CHD. In addition, 
there is increasing evidence in the CHD population that even late pre-term birth (prior to 39 
weeks GA) is associated with increased mortality, increased peri-operative morbidity, and 
worse neurodevelopmental outcomes. 
Progesterone is an essential hormone in the occurrence and maintenance of pregnancy. 
Progesterone administration has also been shown to be neuroprotective in a variety of clinical 
situations, including traumatic brain injury (TBI).   Sex steroid hormones, including 
progesterone, are critically involved in axonal myelination, forming the basis of white matter 
connectivity in the central nervous system (CNS). Progesterone and its metabolites not only 
promote the viability and regeneration of neurons, but also act on myelinating glial cell 
oligodendrocytes in the CNS and play an important role in the formation of myelin sheaths. 
Progesterone has also been shown to increase myelination and enhance maturation of 
immature oligodendrocytes progenitor cells to mature oligodendrocytes, which are more 
resistant to hypoxic/ischemic injury. Therapeutic administration of progesterone has also 
been demonstrated to prevent preterm birth.  
We propose a Phase II single-center placebo-controlled randomized therapeutic 
exploratory trial to determine whether there is evidence that progesterone, administered pre-
natally, improves neurodevelopmental outcomes, improves brain development, and reduces 
perioperative white matter injury in neonates with CHD undergoing cardiac surgery. The data 
provided by [CONTACT_175392] a future multi-institutional study.

1.3 Findings from Non-Clinical and Clinical Studies  
1.3.1 Progesterone Pharmacokinetics 
Progesterone is produced in significant amounts by [CONTACT_175393]-age woman.1 It is produced by [CONTACT_175394]; but in large amounts in the postovulatory ovary. Progesterone is metabolized 
principally in the liver by [CONTACT_941] 5a-reductase pathway resulting in pregnanediol and 
pregnanetriol; and by [CONTACT_175395].1 Progesterone’s precursors and 
metabolites do not have significant progestational activity. Progesterone circulates in the 
serum bound to cortisol-binding globulin, bound to albumin, or as free hormone.[ADDRESS_204659] been associated 
with a lower prevalence of systemic side effects.3, 5 
Although vaginal progesterone is commonly used in conjunction with assisted 
reproductive technologies (ART) and to prevent preterm birth, there is very little data 
concerning placental levels, transplacental transfer or fetal blood levels. A study using ex vivo 
perfusion of placentas from term pregnancies showed that 17-α-Hydroxyprogesterone 
caproate is metabolized by [CONTACT_175396]. Both the parent compound and the metabolites 
were transferred to the fetal circuit.[ADDRESS_204660] treatment, the experimental group received progesterone and 
the control group received non-active treatment (placebo) or no additional treatment. The 
authors identified three studies with a total of [ADDRESS_204661] of progesterone on mortality and disability after TBI. Subjects in the 
progesterone group had a risk of death around 40% lower than those in the control group. 
   
   [ADDRESS_204662] the entire period of gestation.14 Many of 
the processes involved in CNS repair after brain injury are thought to recapi[INVESTIGATOR_175344].17 Progesterone is synthesized by [CONTACT_175397].18 Progesterone 
and allopregnanolone reduce excessive excitotoxicity and inflammation while maintaining 
normal levels of cell proliferation and apoptosis in the developi[INVESTIGATOR_38866].19 Numerous potential 
mechanisms likely underlie the neuroprotective effects of progesterone and 
allopregnanolone.9 These include regulation of neurotropin production; increased expression 
of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF); activation of specific signaling pathways 
including the cAMP/PKA, MAPK (ERK1/2), and the PI-3K/Akt pathways, previously 
implicated in mediating neuroprotective effects; and regulation of the GABA A receptor.20-[ADDRESS_204663] common lesion identified by [CONTACT_175398], 
and is present in up to 50% of patients early after cardiac surgery.27, 28 The primary 
mechanism of white matter injury is thought to be hypoxic/ischemic injury to vulnerable 
oligodendrocyte precursors. Thus the protective effect of progesterone on oligodendrocytes, 
their vulnerable progenitors and myelination is of special interest.  
Progesterone is involved in the regulation of oligodendrocyte precursor proliferation and 
maturation.[ADDRESS_204664] hypoxia induced 
white matter injury is not known. 
The neuroprotective effects are highly dependent on the type of progesterone 
administered. There are important differences in the neurobiology of progesterone and the 
synthetic medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), which is the most commonly used progestin 
in hormone therapy regimens.9 MPA is a synthetic progestin derived from 17α-
   
   4
hydroxyprogesterone. Both natural progesterone and MPA are used to prevent preterm birth. 
Progesterone and MPA are equally effective at reducing the uterotrophic effects of 
unopposed estrogen treatment, but their effects on the brain are not identical.  It has become 
clear that while progesterone is neuroprotective, MPA is not.9 The difference in 
neuroprotective potential may be explained by [CONTACT_175399]; 
progesterone increases BNDF levels, while MPA has no effect.[ADDRESS_204665]-natal effects of progesterone therapy during fetal life were evaluated in a 
multicenter randomized controlled trial of 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17-OHP-

a randomized clinical trial of extremely low birth weight infants (n=30).37 Therapy was initiated 
at a median gestational age of 26.6 weeks (corresponding to the third trimester of fetal

1.3.3 Progesterone and Preterm Birth 
In humans, progesterone is necessary for fertilization and maintenance of pregnancy (by 
[CONTACT_175400]).40, 41 Progesterone is initially produced by [CONTACT_175401] 7–8 weeks of gestation increasingly by [CONTACT_89119]. At term, in a singleton 
pregnancy, the placenta produces approximately 250–300 mg progesterone per day.40 
Inhibition of the production/effect of progesterone will induce parturition.[ADDRESS_204668] three different potential modes of action which maintain pregnancy: 1) 
functional progesterone withdrawal has been suggested to be essential in humans, i.e. 
changes in receptor levels or metabolism of progesterone40; 2) maternal levels of placental 
corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) increase with gestational age and peak at delivery. 
The rise in placental CRH levels is more rapid in women who deliver preterm compared to 
women who deliver at term. Progesterone has an inhibitory effect on placental CRH 
production which may prevent preterm birth; 3) labor is preceded by [CONTACT_175402]-regulation of interleukins and increased prostaglandin synthesis. Progesterone 
attenuates these effects, possibly by [CONTACT_2017]-inflammatory effect.[ADDRESS_204669] common transcript, mediates many of the actions of progesterone. 
However, there are shorter transcripts, including progesterone receptors A and C. The 
shorter  variant receptors (A and C) lack an N-terminal–activating domain, and can function 
   
   [ADDRESS_204670] that could 
constitute a mechanism of progesterone withdrawal. 
There is increasing evidence that administration of progesterone to women at increased 
risk of preterm birth (those with a short cervix and possibly those with a history of preterm 
birth) is an effective therapy to delay onset of parturition.42 A Cochrane review of 36 
randomized controlled trials involving 8,523 women found that progesterone therapy had 
benefits which include: prolonging the pregnancy, decreased neonatal mortality, decreased 
need for assisted ventilation and decreased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis.[ADDRESS_204671] effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].44 
The optimal progesterone preparation and dosage has not been fully determined. In a 
recent review, the authors concluded that women with a history of prior spontaneous preterm 
birth should be offered progesterone therapy.45 Progesterone supplementation in women with 
a short cervix could be considered. Based on existing evidence, a dose of 250 mg of 17 α-
hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17-OHP-C) given weekly starting between 16/0 and 20/[ADDRESS_204672] of progesterone therapy for 
the prevention of preterm birth on perinatal outcomes.42 Sixteen studies (singletons, n=7; 
twins, n=7; triplets, n=2) were included. Outcomes evaluated were neonatal and perinatal 
death, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (RDS), retinopathy, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), 
intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) Grade 3–4, sepsis, admission to the neonatal intensive 
care unit (NICU) and composite adverse outcome. For singleton pregnancies, progesterone 
reduced the rates of neonatal death (risk ratio (RR) 0.487 (95% CI, 0.290–0.818)), RDS (RR 
0.677 (95% CI, 0.490–0.935)), NICU admission (RR 0.410 (95% CI, 0.204–0.823)) and 
composite adverse outcome (RR 0.576 (95% CI, 0.373–0.891)). No favorable effect was 
observed in twin gestations. Progesterone was associated with increased rates of perinatal 
death (RR 1.551 (95% CI, 1.014–2.372)), RDS (RR 1.218 (95% CI, 1.038–1.428)), and 
composite adverse outcome (RR 1.211 (95% CI, 1.029–1.425)) in twin gestations. No 
significant effect was observed in triplet pregnancies. The authors concluded that 
progesterone administration in singleton pregnancies at risk for preterm birth improves 
perinatal outcomes, but may actually have adverse effects in multiple pregnancies.[ADDRESS_204673] also been evaluated.36 
Surviving children from a trial of 17-OHP-C vs. placebo to prevent preterm birth underwent 
   
   6
physical examination and developmental screening at 48 months of age. Progesterone 
therapy was not associated with any adverse physical or neurodevelopmental sequelae.36 
1.3.4 Ongoing Clinical Trial 
The OPPTIMUM study is a double blind randomized placebo controlled trial to determine 
whether progesterone prophylaxis to prevent preterm birth has long term neonatal or infant 
benefit.47 Specifically it will study whether, in women with singleton pregnancy and at high 
risk of preterm labor, prophylactic vaginal natural progesterone, 200 mg daily from 22–34 
weeks gestation, compared to placebo, improves obstetric outcome by [CONTACT_175403] (before 34 weeks), improves 
neonatal outcome by [CONTACT_175404] a composite of death and major morbidity, and leads to 
improved childhood cognitive and neurosensory outcomes at two years of age. Recruitment 
began in 2009 and is scheduled to close in spring, 2013. As of May 2012, over 800 women 
had been randomized in 60 sites. Fetuses with significant congenital structural (including 
CHD) or chromosomal fetal anomalies are excluded. The primary endpoints are 1) obstetric: 
delivery <34 completed weeks of gestation (Yes/No); 2) neonatal: a composite of death or 
two markers of neonatal morbidity – bronchopulmonary dysplasia in children born at <32 
weeks of gestation and brain injury on cerebral ultrasound; 3) childhood: The Bayley Scales 
of Infant and Toddler Development-III Cognitive score at two years of chronological age. The 
study protocol does not include fetal or post-natal brain MRI, thus limiting the ability to 
quantify brain maturation or white matter injury. 
1.4 Selection of Drugs and Dosages 
Progesterone therapy has received approval for prevention of preterm birth. On February 
3, 2011, the FDA approved the use of progesterone supplementation (hydroxyprogesterone 
caproate) during pregnancy to reduce the risk of recurrent preterm birth in women with a 
history of at least one prior spontaneous preterm delivery.48 Recently, the Society for 
Maternal-Fetal Medicine reviewed the existing data and concluded that existing randomized 
studies indicate that in women with singleton gestations, no prior preterm birth, and short 
cervical length, vaginal progesterone, either 90-mg gel or 200-mg. suppository, is associated 
with reduction in preterm birth and perinatal morbidity and mortality, and can be offered in 
these cases.49 This was rated as Level I evidence and a level A recommendation. Similarly, 
the Maternal Fetal Medicine Committee of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists 
of Canada reviewed the existing data and concluded that on the basis of the data from the 
RCTs and a meta-analysis, it is recommended: 1) that in cases where the clinician and the 
patient have opted for the use of progesterone the following dosages should be used: for 
prevention of preterm birth in women with history of previous preterm birth:17 alpha-
hydroxyprogesterone 250 mg IM weekly (level of evidence I-B) or progesterone 100 mg daily 
vaginally (level of evidence I-A); and 2) for prevention of preterm birth in women with short 
cervix, progesterone 200 mg daily vaginally (level of evidence I-A).50 
The proposed study will utilize a transvaginal Bioadhesive Delivery System consisting of 
progesterone in a polycarbophil-based gel (Crinone 8%; Serono Laboratories, Norwell, MA) 
which was designed to provide prolonged and controlled release of progesterone after 
vaginal application.2 The labeled indications include secondary amenorrhea, ART in patients 
who require progesterone supplementation, and ART in patients with partial or complete 
ovarian failure. An unlabeled use is to reduce the risk of recurrent spontaneous preterm birth 
in appropriately selected women. The usual dosage is 90 mg (8% gel) once or twice daily. 
An ongoing multi-institution study to determine if progesterone prophylaxis during pregnancy 
has long-term neonatal or infant benefit uses a daily natural vaginal suppository (200 mg).[ADDRESS_204674] trimester (24-28 weeks GA). This is a period of rapid 
   
   7
fetal brain growth and the period in which brain development in fetuses with CHD lags behind 
that of fetuses without CHD (see below). Therapy will be continued to 39 weeks GA in order 
to continue the potential neuroprotective effects, and potentially decrease the prevalence of 
birth prior to 39 weeks GS. The fetal brain continues to develop throughout gestation and 
there is evidence (see below) that delivery prior to 39 weeks is associated with increased 
mortality, morbidity and worse neurodevelopmental outcomes.51-53 
1.5 Relevant Literature and Data 
1.5.1 Congenital Heart Disease and Neurobehavioral Disability 
In the [LOCATION_002], approximately 1 in every 100 newborns is diagnosed with CHD. 
Many of these newborns (25%-35%) will require either corrective or palliative open heart 
surgery. As recently as the 1960’s, only 20% of newborns with critical CHD survived to 
adulthood. Today, thanks to better diagnostic technologies and methods (including prenatal 
diagnosis), advances in surgery, and improved postoperative care, early survival is over 90%. 
However, with improved early outcomes has come the sobering recognition that there is an 
ongoing risk of late mortality as well as significant morbidity for these children. 
Neurodevelopmental disability is now recognized as the most common complication of critical 
CHD (i.e. those patients requiring cardiac surgery in infancy) and has the most negative 
impact on quality of life, academic performance and opportunity for independence as an 
adult. 54-[ADDRESS_204675] 
significantly lower scores on IQ and achievement tests, delays in reaching motor milestones, 
as well as higher frequencies of learning disabilities, use of special services, and speech, 
language, and behavioral abnormalities.54, 56 The factors underlying developmental morbidity 
in children with heart disease are complex and multi-factorial; ranging from genetic conditions 
and altered blood flow to the brain in utero to postnatal medical conditions that accompany 
CHD and its medical and surgical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Regardless of their origin, neurodevelopmental 
problems adversely affect learning and the attainment of academic, social, and vocational 
skills. Ultimately they undermine mental health and employment opportunities in adulthood. 
There is a wealth of disturbing data documenting the impact of neurodevelopmental deficits 
among children and adults affected by [CONTACT_175405].  [ADDRESS_204676] Study (BCAS) 
which examined the incidence of acute neurological injury, as well as later cognitive and 
behavioral outcomes, following the arterial switch operation (ASO) for transposition of the 
great arteries (TGA).58-63 Developmental outcomes were evaluated at 1, 4, and 8 years of 
age. At the 8-year evaluation, Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) and Performance IQ 
(PIQ), memory, visual-spatial skills, and academic achievement for the entire BCAS cohort 
were lower than population norms. A substantial number of the patients were experiencing 
academic difficulties and 37% had received special education services. There was a 
distinctive pattern of neurodevelopmental dysfunction characterized by [CONTACT_175406], impaired executive function, inattention and impulsive behavior, deficits in core 
communication and pragmatic language skills, as well as impaired social cognition.  
Evaluation of the BCAS cohort at [ADDRESS_204677] deviations were larger, suggesting marked variability 
among children in their outcomes. The deficits are particularly notable because the 
   
   8
adolescents were of normal birth weight (>2.5 kg), did not have genetic syndromes or 
extracardiac anomalies, and rarely required reoperation or long-term cardiac medications. 
Evaluation of these adolescents with brain MRI revealed a very high prevalence of white 
matter injury and altered white matter microstructure.[ADDRESS_204678] resulted in improvements in unadjusted neurodevelopmental outcomes. A 
recent analysis of 1,770 patients (23 centers/5 countries) born 1996-2009  who underwent 
cardiac surgery with CPB at age ≤ 9 mo. and were tested with the Bayley Scales of Infant 
Development-II revealed evidence of only slight improvement over time in Psychomotor 
Development Index (PDI) and Mental Developmental Index (MDI) scores since 1996, even 
after adjustment for patient factors . Surgery in more recent years was not associated with 
better unadjusted PDI or MDI scores.  
 
A recent systematic review evaluated the strength of evidence for current practices for 
neuromonitoring and neuroprotection during cardiac surgery in infants.[ADDRESS_204679] 
impacts on fetal cerebral blood flow. In the fetus without CHD, gas exchange occurs in the 
placenta with oxygenated blood returning through the umbilical vein and ductus venosus (DV) 
to the portal vein, inferior vena cava (IVC) and right atrium and deoxygenated blood returning 
to the placenta via the umbilical artery. Prior to birth, blood flow to the lungs is very low due 
to elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and relatively low lung volumes. Two connections 
exist between the systemic and pulmonary circulations: 1) the foramen ovale connecting the 
right and left atria, and 2) the ductus arteriosus between the pulmonary trunk and descending 
aorta. Umbilical venous blood is preferentially directed through the DV into the left lobe of the 
liver. As a consequence the oxygen saturation is higher in the left hepatic veins as they join 
the IVC resulting in streams of blood with different saturations. The higher saturated stream 
containing blood from the DV is preferentially directed across the foramen ovale to the left 
atrium. This blood mixes with the limited amount of pulmonary venous blood returning from 
the lungs, resulting in a saturation in the fetal left ventricle of approximately 65%, which is 
then ejected into the ascending aorta and cerebral vasculature. Blood ejected by [CONTACT_175407] (SVC) as well as 
the relatively desaturated streams from the IVC and coronary sinus. The resulting saturation 
in the fetal right ventricle is approximately 55%. Blood from the right ventricle is preferentially 
ejected across the ductus arteriosus returning to the placenta via the umbilical arteries.   
In two common forms of congenital heart disease, TGA and hypoplastic left heart 
syndrome (HLHS), alterations in fetal blood flow may lead to decreased brain oxygen delivery 
during fetal life. In TGA, the aorta arises from the right ventricle and thus receives the 
relatively desaturated blood from the superior vena cava and lower saturation stream of blood 
in the inferior vena cava. The higher saturated stream from the left hepatic veins is directed 
normally across the foramen ovale to the morphologic left ventricle. The left ventricle however 
is connected to the pulmonary trunk and this higher saturated blood is delivered to the lungs 
and lower body. In HLHS, the fetal circulation is characterized by [CONTACT_175408], resulting in reversal of flow across the foramen ovale. Left ventricular filling is 
   
   [ADDRESS_204680]-natal head circumferences and maturation scores are not statistically different. 
This suggests that oxygen delivery (oxygen content x cerebral blood flow) is the critical value 
that determines brain growth and maturation.  
There is convincing evidence that in utero brain development is abnormal in fetuses with 
CHD leading to delayed maturation, poor growth and white matter injury. Altered fetal 
hemodynamics resulting from the presence of CHD may cause decreased in-utero cerebral 
blood flow and oxygenation of the fetal brain.66, [ADDRESS_204681] trimester, 
normally a time of rapid brain growth and development, that the brains of infants with CHD 
fail to grow at the same rate as brains of fetuses without CHD.69 During this period of rapid 
brain growth in the normally developi[INVESTIGATOR_175345], there is a corresponding increase in the 
complexity of brain structure, characterized by [CONTACT_175409] a result 
of white matter volume expansion. During this phase of white matter growth, populations of 
glial cells called oligodendrocytes (the major constituent of white matter) are undergoing rapid 
differentiation and maturation. This increase in maturation and organizational complexity is 
delayed in fetuses with CHD, and is most delayed in those with the most complex defects 
(e.g. aortic atresia).66, 68, 69 The figure shows the relationship between the Fetal Total 
Maturation Score 
(fTMS) derived from 
fetal brain MRI for 
normal fetuses and 
those with CHD. A 
lower fTMS implies a 
less mature brain. 
There is a delay in 
brain maturation in 
the fetuses with CHD 
in late gestation. Thus 
there is convincing 
evidence for global 
brain growth 
impairment in the 
fetus with CHD 
resulting in 
microcephaly, 
immature cellular 
elements of the white 
matter and decreased cortical folding at birth. It has been demonstrated in several 
prospective observational studies that this abnormal/delayed development is a primary risk 
factor underlying the hypoxic-ischemic white matter brain injury seen in over 50% of peri-
surgical infants with CHD.27, 28 Pathological examination of this white matter injury 

   
   10
demonstrates that this injury (PVL) is identical to that seen in infants born prematurely. Using 
TMS, it has been demonstrated that risk for pre-operative and postoperative injury seen in 
infants with is highly correlated with the maturational state of the brain prior to surgery. 67, [ADDRESS_204682] 
shown a decrease in cerebrovascular resistance to compensate for fetal hypoxia. This 
redistribution of fetal circulation has been termed the ‘brain-sparing effect’ and may be an 
adaptive response to intrauterine hypoxia. 
There is increasing evidence that cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the fetus is altered in the 
presence of CHD. Middle cerebral artery (MCA) blood flow velocities (peak systolic velocity, 
peak diastolic velocity, and mean velocity) and vascular resistance can be assessed using 
pulsed-wave Doppler. Pulsatility index (PI) is a measure of vascular resistance in the 
circulatory bed downstream from the point of Doppler sampling. It is calculated according to 
the equation, PI = (peak systolic velocity – end-diastolic velocity)/ time-averaged mean 
velocity.[ADDRESS_204683] shown that cerebrovascular resistance is lower 
than normal in fetuses with HLHS.72 In fetuses with right sided obstructive lesions (tetralogy 
of Fallot), cerebrovascular resistance is significantly higher than in fetuses with HLHS and is 
higher than in normal fetuses, but not to a significant degree. The fetus with HLHS and aortic 
atresia has absent antegrade blood flow in the ascending aorta, with CBF supplied retrograde 
via the ductus arteriosus, likely limiting cerebral perfusion. The decreased cerebral vascular 
resistance seen in the fetus with HLHS may be an attempt to attract a greater amount of CBF 
to compensate for decreased oxygen delivery.  
Fractional moving blood volume (FMBV) is an alternative method to assess the fetal 
cerebral circulation which uses Power Doppler to estimate quantitatively brain tissue 
perfusion.73-[ADDRESS_204684], FMBV allows assessment of regional 
differences in brain perfusion.76 The method has been validated in animal models and is 
potentially a more sensitive method of brain blood flow redistribution in fetal growth 
restriction.76  FMBV analyzes changes in amplitude (power) on the backscattered Doppler 
ultrasound signals originated from red blood cells.  FMBV estimation aims to compensate for 
the effect that depth, tissue interfaces, and attenuation have on the power Doppler ultrasound 
signals. FMBV is more sensitive than MCA flow velocity or cerebral placental ratio (CPR) to 
identify SGA fetuses at risk of abnormal neonatal neurobehavioral performance.  SGA 
fetuses with increased frontal perfusion showed a 30% risk of abnormal neurobehavior 
expressed in social interactive organization, state organization, and attention capacity.[ADDRESS_204685]-natal (pre-operative) CBF was measured under standard ventilation and repeated after 
increased carbon dioxide in 25 terms infants with CHD.67 Preoperative structural brain 
abnormalities were seen in more than 50% of the cohort, with the most common being PVL 
(28%) and microcephaly (24%). Observed CBF values were much lower than what is 
suggested by [CONTACT_175410]. The presence of 
PVL was strongly associated with low baseline CBF and poor CO 2 reactivity.67 The poor 
   
   11
vascular responsiveness to inspi[INVESTIGATOR_33559] 2 may be due to maximal baseline vasodilation in 
response to low CBF in these patients. Impaired CO2 reactivity has been associated with 
poor neurodevelopmental outcome and a higher risk of death.67  
1.5.4 Serum Progesterone Levels 
In humans, progesterone is necessary for fertilization and maintenance of pregnancy 
(by [CONTACT_175400]).40, 41 Progesterone is initially produced by [CONTACT_175401] 7–8 weeks of gestation increasingly by [CONTACT_89119]. At term, in a singleton 
pregnancy, the placenta produces approximately 250–300 mg progesterone per day.40 Prior 
to ovulation, serum levels are less than 1 ng/ml. Serum rise after ovulation for 6-10 days, 
then fall if fertilization does not occur. If a viable pregnancy occurs, serum levels rise 
throughout gestation. A characteristic of human pregnancy is that circulating progesterone 
levels do not fall with the onset of labor . 
There is no data concerning fetal serum progesterone levels either during a normal 
pregnancy, or in response to exogenous progesterone. Although vaginal progesterone is 
commonly used for in conjunction with assisted reproductive technologies (ART) and to 
prevent preterm birth, there is very little data concerning placental levels, transplacental 
transfer or fetal blood levels. A study using ex vivo perfusion of placentas from term 
pregnancies showed that 17-α-Hydroxyprogesterone caproate is metabolized by [CONTACT_175411]. Both the parent compound and the metabolites are transferred to the fetal circuit.[ADDRESS_204686] with the 
placental villi in the intervillous space, where the trophoblastic epi[INVESTIGATOR_175346]-derived substances to the fetus. The 
normal placenta is long and thin, and contains numerous placental villi. The combination of 
a placental villous tree and its decidual artery is called a placentome (also a cotyledon). The 
diffusion barrier for transfer between mother and fetus is normally very small, made up by [CONTACT_175412][INVESTIGATOR_175347]. Fetal capi[INVESTIGATOR_175348]. Oxygenated and nutrient-enriched blood is returned to the fetus via a 
network of veins that drain into the umbilical vein. The maternal uterine arteries dilate 
significantly during the course of a normal pregnancy to increase maternal blood flow to the 
placenta and developi[INVESTIGATOR_16103]; for example, 50 mL/minute of maternal blood enters the non-
gravid uterus, increasing to approximately 700 mL/minute at near-term. This large increase 
is made possible by [CONTACT_175413], increased cardiac output, uterine 
artery dilation, and low uterine and placental vascular resistance. Appropriate placental 
functioning at the anatomic/histologic level of the placentome requires: 1) maternal uterine 
and decidual artery integrity, patency, flow, and dilation during pregnancy; 2) increased 
   
   12
maternal blood flow and low resistance through the intervillous space; 3) normal exposure of 
the villous trophoblastic endothelium to maternal blood; 4) low diffusion distance between 
maternal and fetal blood from the intervillous space across the trophoblast and villous 
endothelium; 5) integrity and patency of the villous vessels; 6) unobstructed flow in the 
umbilical cord.  
There is increasing awareness of the importance of normal function and regulation of a 
placental synthetic, metabolic, and inflammatory functions to maintain placental integrity, 
maternal and fetal well-being, and normal fetal development.  A variety of acute, sub-acute, 
and chronic abnormalities of placental anatomy and vascular function have been linked to 
maternal abnormalities such as preeclampsia and to fetal events such as fetal demise, IUGR, 
and perinatal brain injury; the types of injury have included white matter injury, stroke, or 
neonatal encephalopathy.77-[ADDRESS_204687]-natal brain anatomy and neurodevelopmental outcomes 
are increasing and becoming more firmly established. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_175349], examination 
of the placenta—histopathological or otherwise—is not routine, even in pregnancies 
complicated by [CONTACT_175414].  
There is a significant lack of information about placental anatomy and function in infants 
born with CHD, despi[INVESTIGATOR_175350], pre-term birth, relative brain 
immaturity, reduced brain size, and brain imaging abnormalities (prior to any cardiac or other 
interventions), etc. that occur in these infants.  A recent study found significantly reduced 
fetal somatic growth velocity in the later stages of pregnancy as well as reduced birth weight 
in HLHS infants and suggested suboptimal energy balance due to placental vascular 
pathology as a potential cause.51  The increased risk of IUGR in fetuses with CHD was also 
suggested by a recent retrospective cohort study which found an approximately 2-to-3-fold 
increased risk of IUGR accompanied the fetal diagnosis of CHD (without chromosomal or 
extracardiac anomalies.77 Preliminary data collected recently at CHOP suggests that various 
placental abnormalities with the potential to alter placental function and fetal homeostasis 
frequently occur in pregnancies complicated by [CONTACT_175405].  Taken together, these data indicate 
that pregnancies complicated by [CONTACT_175415]/or function that can compromise fetal growth and development and 
lead to increased risk of perinatal brain injury.  Thus, a comprehensive and multimodal 
analysis of placental anatomy, vascularity, and biochemical function is warranted. 
1.5.6 CHD and Preterm Birth 
There is increasing evidence that even late preterm and early term birth is associated 
with worse perinatal and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes in both the normal fetus 
and the fetus with CHD.  In the fetus without CHD, there is significant neonatal morbidity 
associated with elective delivery at 37–38 weeks compared to deliveries occurring at 39–[ADDRESS_204688]-blood arterial pH below 7.0, a 5-
min Apgar of 3 or less, admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and prolonged 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_171762] 5 days were significantly less likely to occur as gestational age 
increased from 37 (15.3%) to 39 weeks (8%), and plateaued at 40 weeks (7.3%).81 For the 
fetus without CHD, postponing elective delivery to 39 weeks may prevent 48% of cases of 
complications among deliveries at 37 weeks and 27% among 38-week deliveries.  
Preterm birth is common for mothers carrying fetuses with CHD. Among 397 babies with 
CHD delivered in the Special Delivery Unit (SDU) at CHOP in in fiscal years 2011 to 2013, 
   
   13
53% were delivered at < 39 weeks gestational age and 16% at ≤ 37 weeks. Among 971 
neonates treated at [LOCATION_011]’s Children Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_175351] 2002 through 2008, 56% were born at < 
39 weeks gestational age and 19% at ≤ 37 weeks.52 Data from the National Vital Statistics 
Report (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr62/ ) show that in 2011, among all births in the 
[LOCATION_002], 38% were at < 39 weeks gestational age and 12% were at < [ADDRESS_204689] that the risk of preterm birth is increased for the fetus with CHD. 
Late preterm or early term birth also has serious adverse effects for the fetus with CHD. 
Investigators from [LOCATION_011] Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_175352] 971 consecutive neonates with CHD 
and a known gestational age born from 2002 through 2008.52 Compared with the referent 
group of neonates who were delivered at 39 to 40 completed weeks gestation, neonates born 
at 37 to 38 weeks had increased mortality (6.9% vs. 2.6%; adjusted P=0.049) and morbidity 
(49.7% vs. 39.7%; adjusted P=0.02) rates and tended to require a longer duration of 
mechanical ventilation (adjusted P=0.05). They concluded that for neonates with critical CHD, 
delivery before 39 weeks gestation is associated with greater mortality and morbidity rates 
and more resource use and that the ideal gestational age for delivery of these patients may 
be 39 to 40 completed weeks. Evidence from CHOP suggests that younger gestational age 
is associated with worse neurodevelopmental outcomes in children with CHD.53 
Neurodevelopmental outcomes were evaluated in 351 preschool children with CHD born at 
36 weeks or greater gestational age. Performance for cognition, language, executive 
function, social skills, visual-motor, and fine-motor skills was better for those born at 39 to 40 
weeks of GA or more versus those born at less than 39 weeks (all P<.05). These findings are 
consistent with the hypothesis that delivery before [ADDRESS_204690] that elective (or spontaneous) delivery at [ADDRESS_204691] into the placenta was eccentric 
in 61 (84%) and velamentous in 3 (4%). Abnormal maturation of villi was present in 29%; 
chorioangiosus in 14%. An abnormal fetal/placental weight ratio (as compared to published 
norms) was seen in 46%. Evidence for inflammation was present overall in 19% and vascular 
thrombosis in 16%. Infarction was present overall in 14%, but most commonly in HLHS and 
TGA (25%). There is evidence that the fetus with CHD is at increased risk for intra-uterine 
growth retardation (IUGR), which may be due in part to uteroplacental insufficiency.77 In a 
retrospective cohort study of 67,823 patients, there were 193 cases of fetal CHD (0.3%) and 
5,669 cases of IUGR (8.4%). Prenatal diagnosis of CHD was associated with an increased 
risk of IUGR (23.8% vs. 8.5%, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
2.4–4.6), and the risk was greatest in fetuses with major CHD (16.5% vs. 8.5%, aOR 2.1, 
95% CI 1.3–3.2).77 Isolated CHD was also associated with an increased risk of IUGR (17.8% 
vs. 8.5%, aOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4–3.7). The increased risk persisted after excluding extracardiac 
and chromosomal anomalies. There was a significantly increased incidence of single 
umbilical artery in fetuses with CHD, consistent with structural placental abnormalities. There 
is no data concerning progesterone levels and metabolism in pregnancies with a fetus with 
   
   [ADDRESS_204692] that pregnancies with CHD are at increased risk for 
uteroplacental insufficiency and may be considered stressed or compromised pregnancies.

2 STUDY OBJECTIVES 
We propose a Phase II single-center placebo-controlled randomized therapeutic 
exploratory trial to determine whether there is evidence that progesterone, administered pre-
natally, improves neurodevelopmental outcomes, improves brain development, and reduces 
perioperative white matter injury in neonates with CHD undergoing cardiac surgery. The data 
provided by [CONTACT_175392] a future multi-institutional study.  
2.1 Primary Objective (or Aim) 
Primary Aim: Develop preliminary evidence to support a multi-institutional study to 
determine whether, in women carrying fetuses with CHD (maternal-fetal dyad), prophylactic 
vaginal natural progesterone therapy is neuroprotective, and compared to placebo improves 
neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 months of age. 
Hypothesis: 
Compared to placebo, progesterone administration results in a higher score on the Motor 
Scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-III (Bayley-III) at 18 months of 
age. 
2.2 Secondary Objectives (or Aims) 
Specific Aims: Develop preliminary evidence to support a multi-institutional study to 
determine whether, in women carrying fetuses with CHD (maternal-fetal dyad), prophylactic 
vaginal natural progesterone therapy is neuroprotective, and compared to placebo: 
1.  improves fetal brain growth and maturation, 
2.  increases myelination during fetal brain development, 
3.  reduces pre-operative brain white matter injury, and 
4.  reduces post-operative white matter injury. 
Hypotheses: 
Compared to placebo, progesterone administration results in  
1.  higher scores on the Cognitive and Language Scales of the Bayley Scales of Infant    
and Toddler Development-III (Bayley-III) at 18 months of age, 
   
   15
2.  a higher total maturation score (TMS) on early post-natal MRI, 
3.  Increased global and regional brain volumes 
4.  a greater volume of myelinated white matter (VMWM) in the posterior limb of the 
internal capsule  on early post-natal, pre-operative MRI, 
5.  lower periventricular leucomalacia (PVL) volume on early post-natal, pre-operative 
MRI, 
6.  lower PVL volume on post-operative MRI. 
3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
3.1 General Schema of Study Design 
Phase II single-center placebo-controlled randomized therapeutic exploratory trial 
3.1.1 Screening Phase 
Potential subjects will be identified by [CONTACT_175417] (J.R. or A.S.). Potential subjects will be 
screened for eligibility at 24-[ADDRESS_204693] permission (informed consent) will be obtained prior to any study 
related procedures being performed. 
3.1.[ADDRESS_204694] concerning diagnosis, associated anomalies, medical 
and surgical management and the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2779]. A blood (either from the cord or from an 
existing blood drawing line during a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], routine clinical labwork or at the time of 
a research draw for a separate study) or saliva sample will be obtained for genetic testing. 
An early post-natal brain MRI will be obtained on the day of cardiac surgery, during the same 
anesthetic but prior to surgery.  Post-operative brain MRI will be obtained within 10 days of 
surgery. 
3.1.4 Neurodevelopmental Evaluation 
All surviving infants will undergo neurodevelopmental evaluation at 18 months of age 
(corrected for prematurity).  An interim medical history will be obtained, including details of 
any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_175354]. A neurological examination will be performed. 
Growth parameters will be assessed. The neurodevelopmental evaluation will include the 
   
   [ADDRESS_204695] for Autism in 
Toddlers (M-CHAT), and the Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA). 
3.[ADDRESS_204696]. Putt, will generate a block randomization schedule based 
on stratification by [CONTACT_175418]: TGA, HLHS, and other CHD. The randomization 
schedule will be based on equal allocation of subjects to the progesterone and placebo arms 
within each block. To ensure blinding, the randomization schedule will be generated using 
variable block sizes. Upon confirmation of eligibility in the DMS, the randomization module 
will be programmed to generate a randomization number that corresponds to a unique kit 
number of progesterone or placebo treatment. This kit number will be used to distribute 
treatment. 
3.2.[ADDRESS_204697] access to the information that links the kit number to the treatment 
arm. He/she will provide this information to the Investigational Pharmacy so that kits are 
prepared according to this scheme. Progesterone and placebo treatment kits will appear 
identical. They will be labeled with the following information: 
1. Kit number 
2. Study name [CONTACT_114040] 
3. Subject ID # [blank line to record this number] 
3.2.[ADDRESS_204698] of the in utero treatment phase beginning 
at 24-28 weeks GA and continuing until 30 days after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_175355]. 
The study duration for each fetus/child will include the in utero treatment phase, the post-
natal phase and the neurodevelopmental evaluation. The study will begin at 24-28 weeks GA 
and continue to 18 months of age (corrected for prematurity). 
3.3.2 Total Number of Study Sites/Total Number of Subjects Projected 
The study will be conducted at a single site, the Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684]. We 
plan to enroll sufficient patients to have 80 evaluable patients (40 per treatment group) at the 
18 month neurodevelopmental testing. Based on known clinical outcomes for this patient 
population and experience with other studies with similar follow-up plans, we estimate a 5% 
early mortality and a further 20% attrition from all causes between hospi[INVESTIGATOR_175341] 
18 month evaluation. There may also be dropout prior to birth for a variety of reasons: fetal 
death, intolerance of therapy, withdrawal from study. We do not have accurate data to 
estimate this loss. We anticipate needing to enroll 110-[ADDRESS_204699] a sufficient cohort 
at 18 months (40 per treatment group), with [ADDRESS_204700]-operative brain MRIs. Based on current patient 
   
   17
volume in the Fetal Heart Program Clinic, we anticipate there will be 70-75 eligible patients 
each year. If the consent rate is 65%, we will be able to complete enrollment within 3 years.

may also withdraw subjects who violate the study plan, or to protect the subject for reasons 
of safety or for administrative reasons.  It will be documented whether or not each subject 
completes the clinical study. If the Investigator becomes aware of any serious, related 
adverse events after the subject completes or withdraws from the study, they will be recorded 
in the source documents and on the CRF. For women without a history of preterm birth, there 
are no known risks to progesterone withdrawal.

Medical Chart Review 
Please see Appendix. 
5.1.3 Physical Examination 
Maternal Examination: 
 General physical examination (at initial visit). 
 Blood pressure/ pulse (at each visit). 
 Height/Weight/BMI /Fundal height (at each visit). 
 Pelvic examination /Clinical pelvimetry (third trimester). 
Infant Evaluation: 
CICU Admission: Each child will undergo clinically indicated physical examination, 
laboratory evaluation and imaging studies. 
Genetic Screening by a Dysmorphologist:  All children entered into the study will be 
evaluated for other syndromic diagnosis by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Elaine Zackai, a dysmorphologist.  In any 
study of the neurologic outcome of patients with CHD, it is important to determine whether 
there is an underlying syndromic diagnosis that in and of itself would impact on outcome. 
5.1.4 Vital Signs 
Vital signs will be monitored and recorded as clinically indicated. 
   
   21
5.1.5 Laboratory Evaluations 
Maternal Evaluation:  As part of routine prenatal care, each mother will undergo clinically 
indicated testing. The laboratory tests listed below should have been obtained by [CONTACT_175420]. If not previously collected, clinically 
indicated testing will be completed as standard of care with the timing determined by [CONTACT_175421]. 
Clinical Laboratory Tests:

Not applicable 
5.1.6 Other Evaluations, Measures 
Neonatal Admission Questionnaires 
Demographic, Ethnicity and Socioeconomic Status (SES) Forms : demographic 
information will be collected in order for the study team to maintain contact [INVESTIGATOR_8178] 18-month 
follow-up.  In addition self-report ethnicity, level of education, and type of employment will be 
   
   [ADDRESS_204707] visit (unless off site study drug initiation has 
occurred), each subsequent prenatal visit and at the time of delivery. Maternal blood for 
genetic testing (if blood not previously obtained as a result of the discontinuation of all 
nonessential on-campus research due to COVID-19 or insufficient DNA for analysis) will be 
obtained during a child’s subsequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_175359]. Cord blood 
will be obtained at the time of delivery. Infant blood will be obtained during a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_175360]’s existing blood drawing line or during routine clinical bloodwork if cord 
blood was not obtained at the time of delivery or DNA quantity was determined to be 
insufficient for analysis. Maternal blood will be collected into four plasma preparation tubes 
(K-EDTA, 4 mL whole blood each) on ice, centrifuged at 600 X g for 5 min at 4 oC, and the 
plasma supernatant aliquoted into separate 2 mL cryovials (to avoid repeated freeze-thaw 
events) and the red blood cells returned to each of the four preparation tubes (to avoid 
repeated freeze-thaw events).  The cryovials containing separates plasma samples are 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_175361] –80 oC (Clinical and Translational Research 
Center and CHOP Clinical Laboratory) for subsequent assay (ELISA or qRT-PCR).  The 
same procedures will be used to collect and store umbilical venous blood at the time of 
delivery.  One aliquot will be sent for assessment of progesterone levels. Additional samples 
will be stored at -80 C for later assessment of progesterone metabolites and biomarkers of 
placental function. The serum progesterone levels will be performed by [CONTACT_175423]. The total blood volumes over the course of the study will be: Maternal: 90 ml; 
Paternal: 5 ml; Cord Blood: 22 ml; Infant 5 ml (only if cord blood not obtained). If DNA quanitity 
was determined to be insufficient an additional 5 mL maternal, paternal and infant sample 
may be obtained. If blood will be obtained at the time of a research draw for a separate study 
the amount drawn will not exceed the lesser of 50 mL or 3 mL/kg, even when a participant is 
providing samples for multiple studies. 
Saliva Samples 
Blood is the preferred specimen for DNA collection. However, at times a blood draw will 
not be possible to obtain. In those instances, we will obtain a saliva sample or a sample from 
a swab of the inner aspect of the cheek. The saliva may be obtained from enrolled subjects 
by [CONTACT_175424]. 
 
Placenta 
Gross Examination: 
The placenta will be weighed and examined visually to determine the location of umbilical 
cord insertion, the types and number of umbilical vessels, and to identify and quantify 
macroscopic areas, size, and location of abnormalities such as calcification, infarction, 
hemorrhage, etc. 
Tissue Histology and Biochemistry: 
The placenta is a heterogeneous organ with regard to normal functions and 
pathophysiologic injury.  Specific tissue sampling strategies to limit bias and maximize 
analytical accuracy and precision have been described.82-84 In brief, it is necessary to analyze 
multiple samples to ensure that the result is an adequate representation of the entire 
organ.   To this end, a systematic uniform random stereologic sampling design will be 
   
   23
employed to generate full-thickness samples (approximately 8-12 per placenta, depending 
upon the size of the organ the random orientation of the sampling grid).82, 83  Each specimen 
will be divided in equal portions for 1) fixation and histochemical analyses and 2) rapid 
freezing and subsequent molecular and biochemical determinations. 
Genetic Testing 
Sample Procurement and Preparation:  Whole blood will be obtained from the biological 
parents and from the infant through an existing blood drawing line during a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_175362]. The blood samples will be sent directly to Center for Applied 
Genomics (CAG) for DNA extraction and Cell Line preparation.  The total blood volumes over 
the course of the study will be: Maternal: 86 ml; Paternal: 5 ml; Cord Blood: 22 ml; Infant 5 
ml (only if cord blood not obtained). If DNA quanitity was determined to be insufficient an 
additional 5 mL maternal, paternal and infant sample may be obtained.  
APOE Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]:  Genomic DNA for analysis will be obtained from each peripheral 
blood sample or saliva collection kit.  Crude leukocyte nuclei are prepared from peripheral 
blood by [CONTACT_104497].  High molecular weight DNA will be extracted via the Genepure 
automated nucleic acid extractor (Applied Biosystem Inc.) utilizing the supplied reagents and 
protocol.  A sample of genomic DNA will be used to determine APOE genotypes using a 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based restriction enzyme isoform genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_100624]. The 
remaining DNA will be banked at   20 °C for future analyses.  The APOE genotype will be 
used as a covariate in the analysis of the neurodevelopmental testing results. 
Genome Wide Association Testing:  Genome Wide Association Testing will be 
performed by [CONTACT_175425], at The Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684]. CAG is experienced in SNP 
genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_175363]. The Illumina technology uses single tube whole genome 
amplification followed by [CONTACT_175426]-extension without PCR or ligation. Infant and biological 
parent blood samples will be processed by [CONTACT_175425].  The GWAS will be used to evaluate the 
parent-child trios for possible copy number variations (CNV). The CNV data will be used as 
a covariate in the analysis of the neurodevelopmental testing results. We will ask the parents 
for permission to bank the DNA for future studies and to share the results with other 
investigators. 
 
5.2 Efficacy Evaluations 
5.2.1 Obstetric Ultrasound 
The ultrasound examination will be conducted with real-time scanners, using a 
transabdominal or a transvaginal approach or  both. All examinations will be performed by 
[CONTACT_175427], who 
will be blinded to the patient group assignment. The abdominal and transvaginal transducers 
to be used will include frequencies ranging from 3 MHz to 10 MHz or higher to provide 
superior resolution while allowing adequate penetration.  The detailed obstetric ultrasound 
examination to be performed at the initial evaluation will include cardiac activity, fetal 
presentation, amniotic fluid index (AFI), placental position, fetal biometry, an anatomic 
survey.  The maternal cervix (normal, funneled, short or long (in centimeters) and adnexa will 
also be examined (presence, location and size of uterine or adnexal masses). 
Cardiac activity:  fetal heart rate and rhythm. 
Fetal presentation : cephalic, breech, transverse or variable. 
   
   24
Amniotic fluid index : less than [ADDRESS_204708] amniotic fluid vertical pocket (less than 2 cm, oligohydramnios 
and more than 8 cm, polyhydramnios). 
Placental position:  anterior, posterior, fundal, lateral, low-lying or previa.  
Placental cord insertion:  central, marginal, eccentric, velamentous. 
Fetal Biometry at initial Examination: 
 Biparietal diameter (BPD) will be obtained at the level of the thalami and cavum septi 
pellucid, and the measurement will be taken from the outer edge of the proximal skull 
to the inner edge of the distal skull. 
 Head circumference (HC) will be measured at the same level as the BPD, around the 
outer perimeter of the calvaria. 
 Femoral length (FL) and humeral length (HL) will be measured with the beam of 
insonation perpendicular to the shaft, excluding the distal femoral or humeral 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_175364]. 
 Abdominal circumference (AC) will be determined at the skin line on a true transverse 
view at the level of the junction of the umbilical vein, portal sinus, and fetal stomach 
when visible. 
 Estimated fetal weight (EFW) will be obtained using a combination of measurements 
such as BPD, HC, AC and FL from previously described formulas, expressed in 
grams, and compared with weight percentiles from published nomograms. 
Elements of the Fetal Anatomic Survey: 
 Head, Face and Neck: Cerebellum, choroid plexus, cisterna magna, lateral ventricles, 
midline falx, cavum septi pellucidi, third ventricle, corpus callosum, posterior fossa, 
cerebellum, transcerebellar diameter (in centimeters), profile, nose, nasal bone, 
orbits,  lips and palate. 
 Chest-Heart: Four-chamber view, outflow tracts, situs, fetal heart rate and rhythm. 
 Abdomen: Stomach (presence, size and situs), kidneys, bladder, umbilical cord 
insertion into the fetal abdomen, umbilical cord vessel number. 
 Spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]: Cervical, thoracic, lumbar and sacral spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. 
 Extremities: Legs and arms (presence or absence). Femoral and humeral length in 
centimeters. Other long bone lengths will be obtained as clinically indicated. 
 Genitalia (male, female, ambiguous). 
Fetal Biometry at Repeat Examination : (ultrasound for growth to be performed at 4 week 
intervals) 
 BPD, HC, FL, HL, AC, EFW. 
 Fetal presentation. 
 Amniotic fluid index and/or amniotic fluid deepest vertical pocket. 
 Placental position (placental position at the initial evaluation may not correlate with its 
location in the third trimester). 
   
   25
 Maternal cervix (cervical length will be measured transabdominally or transvaginally 
at each sonographic evaluation until 32 weeks gestation) and presence, location and 
size of uterine and adnexal masses.  
Doppler Ultrasonography: 
Doppler color flow mappi[INVESTIGATOR_175365] (DV) and the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and average color scale to locate the 
umbilical artery (UA) and maternal uterine arteries (UtA).  Pulsed- wave Doppler will be used 
to determine blood flow velocities of the UA, UtA, DV and MCA.  The peak systolic velocity, 
peak diastolic velocity, mean velocity, systolic to diastolic ratio (SD), pulsatility index (PI) 
resistive index (RI) and UA PI/MCA PI [CONTACT_4490] a mixture from stable signals during fetal apnea 
will be obtained for each of the aforementioned vessels at the initial evaluation at 24-[ADDRESS_204709] fetal echocardiographic examinations and Doppler flow 
studies at the time of enrollment and then every 4 weeks (or as clinically indicated) until 37-
[ADDRESS_204710]. The examinations will be 
performed using a Siemens ACUSON Sequoia 512 ultrasound system or equivalent coupled 
with either a 6 C2 or an 8V3 MHz transducer (Siemens, Erlangen, [LOCATION_013]). Multiple two-
dimensional views will be obtained to evaluate fetal heart anatomy. Doppler interrogation will 
be performed to evaluate valve competence, stenosis and shunting. M-mode will be used to 
assess cardiac rhythm. Color-flow mappi[INVESTIGATOR_175366], as well as 
intracardiac flow.  The two-dimensional images will be recorded on standard video clips for 
subsequent analysis.  Doppler samples will be obtained at the following sites: aortic valve, 
pulmonic valve, atrioventricular valve inflows, transverse aortic arch, ductus arteriosus, 
umbilical vein, DV, MCA, UA, and UtA.   
For the aortic outflow, the sample volume will be placed at the level of the aortic valve on 
either a [ADDRESS_204711] view or on a ductal view. The transverse aortic arch will 
be sampled on the aortic arch view while the ductus arteriosus will be sampled on the ductal 
view. The MCA will be sampled in the mid-portion of the vessel while the umbilical artery will 
be sampled in a free-floating loop. The UtA will be sampled below the crossing point of the 
internal iliac artery. The velocity waveforms will be obtained using an angle of insonation 
lower than 20°.  The length of the sample volume will range between [ADDRESS_204712] view or the ductal view of the fetal 
heart. The measurements will be performed from video clips during systole and only the 
maximum diameters will be selected.  Measurements will be repeated on a minimum of 3 
different cardiac cycles for each valve and the values obtained will be averaged. Valvular 
area of the aortic and pulmonic valves will be calculated assuming a circular cross-section, 
according to the formula π X (valve diameter/2)2. The velocity time integral across both the 
aortic and pulmonic valve will be calculated at the area under the curve of the aortic and 
pulmonic outflow Doppler samples, as described above. Absolute right (RVO) and left (LVO) 
ventricular output (mL/min) will be derived by [CONTACT_175428], 
fetal heart rate and time velocity integral across the respective semilunar valve.  The 
   
   26
combined ventricular output (CVO= RVO + LVO) and the ratio between RVO and LVO 
(RVO/LVO) will then be calculated. 
The pulsatility index (PI) for the MCA, UA, UtA, and ductus arteriosus will be calculated 
according to the formula: (peak systolic velocity – end-diastolic velocity)/time-averaged mean 
velocity. The direction of flow in the transverse aortic arch will be recorded as all antegrade, 
all retrograde, or bidirectional. Any ductal constriction will be noted. A qualitative assessment 
of left and right ventricular cardiac function will be made. Finally, the presence or absence of 
hydrops fetalis will be noted.  
5.2.[ADDRESS_204713] Doppler will be used to determine blood flow velocities in 
the UA, ductus venosus (DV) and MCA.  The peak systolic velocity, peak end- diastolic 
velocity, and time averaged mean velocity are calculated on three consecutive samples 
during fetal apnea, and the results averaged.  The pulsatility index (PI), a measure of vascular 
resistance in the circulatory bed downstream from the point of  Doppler sampling will be 
calculated according to the equation, PI = (peak systolic velocity – end diastolic velocity)/time 
averaged mean velocity. The ratio of UA-PI [INVESTIGATOR_175367]-PI [INVESTIGATOR_175368] U/C-PI [INVESTIGATOR_39870]. PI

published normal values.  
Fractional Moving Blood Volume 
Ultrasound and power Doppler studies will be performed transabdominally, using a 
Phillips iU 22 (Koninklijke Phillips N.V Eindhoven, The Netherlands) ultrasound system with 
a C-9 MHz linear curved array transducer in the absence of fetal respi[INVESTIGATOR_175370], and with mother and fetus in suspended respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].  The following anatomical 
planes of the fetal brain will be included in the pulse Doppler ultrasound color box: anterior 
and complete mid-sagittal, and oblique at the level of the posterior fossa.  During the mid- 
sagittal views, special care will be taken to insonate through the sagittal suture in order to 
avoid the bone barrier and have an uncluttered power Doppler ultrasound recording.  The 
size of box will be maintained as small as possible, in order to cover the different regions 
under investigation and to improve the frame rate.  The ultrasound and power Doppler 
ultrasound settings to be used in all examinations will include: standard gray-scale images 
for obstetrics, medium persistence, high sensitivity, normal image display, pulse repetition 
frequency [ADDRESS_204714] below the presence of noise.  The 
mechanical and thermal indices will always be maintained below 1.  A minimum sequence of 
10 consecutive good quality images without flash artifacts would be stored digitally and 
transferred to a personal computer for FMBV analysis in software designed specifically for 
the purpose. (MatLab, MathWorks, Natick, MA, [LOCATION_003]).  The regions of interest (ROI) will be 
defined and delimited as follows: 1) anterior cerebral, in an anterior mid sagittal view of the 
fetal head, delimited anteriorly by [CONTACT_175429], posteriorly by [CONTACT_175430] 90° at the level of the origin of the anterior cerebral artery and parallel to an 
imaginary line in the front of the face, and inferiorly by [CONTACT_175431], 2) complete mid-
cerebral, in a mid- sagittal plane delimited by [CONTACT_175432] 
3) posterior fossa, delimited anteriorly and by [CONTACT_175433].  Each image will be rendered and the pi[INVESTIGATOR_175371]. FMBV will be calculated according to 
the methodology described elsewhere.85, 86

   [ADDRESS_204716] Information Verification Follow-Up  
After discharge from Visit 1 (post-natal hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) and prior to Visit 2 (18 month 
follow-up), a follow-up phone call/email will be made to verify current contact [CONTACT_175435]’s 6 month, 12 month and 15 month birthday.  In addition, brochures from the CHOP 
patient and family education manual about child development and tips for talking will be 
mailed at those intervals.      
The Bayley Scales of Infant Development–III (BSID-III)  is an individually administered 
instrument that assesses the developmental functioning of infants and young children 
between 1 month and 42 months of age. 68 It assesses development across five domains: 
cognition, language, motor, social-emotional and adaptive.  The cognitive, language and 
motor composite will be used for this study.  This is the most widely used standardized 
developmental test battery in medical and educational settings.  The composite scores have 
a mean of [ADDRESS_204717] for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT)  is a brief screening instrument

discrimination between children diagnosed with and without autism/pervasive developmental 
disorder (PDD). It is an easy questionnaire for parents to complete because of its brevity and 
the clarity of the items.  Those children who reach the cutoff should be referred for further 
evaluation of autism.   
The Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (ITSEA)  is an empi[INVESTIGATOR_175372]-emotional problems and competencies that may be areas of concern 
in children [ADDRESS_204719] t-scores and percentiles

anxiety, separation distress and inhibition to novelty, dysregulation-negative emotionality, 
sleep, eating, sensory sensitivity and Competence-compliance, attention, mastery 
motivation, imitation/play, empathy and prosocial peer relations.  Item clusters include 
maladaptive, social relatedness and atypi[INVESTIGATOR_2855].  The ITSEA was standardized and normed 
based on a nationally representative sample that was stratified to match the [ADDRESS_204720] diaries 
   
   29
will also be reviewed at prenatal visits for any symptom or side effects.  Recommendations 
for clinical intervention will be provided in the event of any unanticipated finding on brain MRI. 
Recommendations for clinical intervention will be provided to any family whose child who 
demonstrates a developmental delay or potential genetic abnormality at the 18 month 
Developmental Follow-Up.   
 
6     STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
6.1   Primary Endpoint 
The primary endpoint is the Motor Scale of the Bayley-III at 18 months of age.  
6.2   Secondary Endpoints 
Secondary endpoints will include the following: 
1. Cognitive and Language Scales of the Bayley-III at 18 months of age 
2. Total maturation score (TMS) 
3. Volumes of whole brain, white matter, gray matter and  myelinated white matter 
(VMWM) 
4. Presence of PVL on early post-natal brain MRI (categorical y/n) 
5. Presence of PVL on early post-operative brain MRI (categorical y/n) 
6. PVL Volume on early post-natal brain MRI 
7. PVL Volume on early post-operative brain MRI 
8. Compliance with progesterone regimen 
9. Compliance with pre- and post-natal MRI’s 
10. Failure to return for [ADDRESS_204721] descriptive 
summaries (e.g. means or medians and standard deviations or interquartile range for 
continuous variables such as age and percentages for categorical variables such as gender). 
6.3.[ADDRESS_204722] sizes for the 
Bayley-III Cognitive and Language Scales at 18 months, as well as total maturation score 
(TMS) and volume of myelinated white matter (VMWM). The analysis will use a two-sided 
two-sample T-interval (estimation) or T-test (hypothesis testing). The confidence level will be 
set at 90% and the Type I error at 10%. Normality will be assessed and a transformation, or 
alternatively a non-parametric test, will be used if needed.  
Based on our earlier work, the occurrence of PVL, both pre- and post-operatively, has a 
complex distribution. At both time points, when occurrence of PVL is considered a categorical 
outcome, there are patients with no evidence of PVL (PVL=0), as well as patients with varying 
amounts of PVL (PVL=1). When occurrence of PVL is considered as a continuous variable 
(volume of PVL), there is a mixture distribution with a peak at zero and the remainder of 
   
   [ADDRESS_204723] to know 
whether the prevalence of PVL (categorical outcome) prior to surgery and post-surgery differs 
between treatment groups (intention to treat). It will also be of interest to know if the volume 
of PVL (continuous outcome), among those who have PVL at baseline, differs between 
treatment groups, both at baseline and post-operatively.  
In the secondary analyses, we will use an exact binomial confidence interval to estimate 
differences between groups in the percent of subjects with PVL pre-operatively and the rate 
of increase post-operatively. The null hypothesis that treatment does not reduce the 
frequency of occurrence of PVL pre-operatively and the rate of increase post-operatively will 
be tested using Fisher’s Exact test. The confidence level will be set at 90% and the Type I 
error at 10%. The PVL data can also be modeled in a more unified approach using mixture 
models, where the categorical data for patients with no PVL, and the continuous data for 
patients with evidence of PVL are modeled jointly.88 In addition to the these analyses, we will 
describe compliance, both with treatment and with MRI tests, as well as determine loss to 
follow-up for the 18 month time point. We will secondarily model TMS, VMWM and the 
Bayley-III Cognitive and Language Scales as a function of treatment, as well as other 
potential predictors of fetal brain maturation and development including: gestational age, type 
of CHD, ethnicity, age at surgery, operative management variables, maternal education and 
socioeconomic status. Presence of 22q11 deletions or other identified genetic anomaly and 
apo-lipoprotein E ( APOE) genotype will be included as covariates in the analysis of the 
Bayley-III scores. 
6.3.3 Safety Analysis 
All subjects entered into the study at will be included in the safety analysis. The 
frequencies of AE by [CONTACT_24975], body system, severity and relationship to study drug will be 
summarized for both the mother and the neonate. Serious adverse events (SAE), if any, will 
be described in detail. 
AE incidence will be summarized along with the corresponding exact binomial 95% two-
sided confidence intervals.

and experience with other studies with similar follow-up plans, we estimate a 5% early 
mortality and a further 20% attrition from all causes between hospi[INVESTIGATOR_175341] 18 
month evaluation. There may also be dropout prior to birth for a variety of reasons: fetal 
death, intolerance of therapy, withdrawal from study. We do not have accurate data to 
estimate this loss. We anticipate needing to enroll 110-[ADDRESS_204725] a sufficient cohort 
at 18 months (40 per treatment group); with [ADDRESS_204726]-operative brain MRIs respectively.

The primary goal is to 
provide sufficiently precise 
estimates of the mean 
difference in the 18 month 
Bayley-III Motor Scale to 
inform the design of a future 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_16076] . Secondarily we 
will provide estimates of 
differences in the TMS, 
VMWM, and the Bayley-III 
Cognitive and Language Scales. All primary analyses will be performed on an intention-to-
treat (ITT) basis. 
 Table 1 shows that for the Bayley-III Motor Scale, assuming 40 evaluable subjects per 
treatment group, and an SD of 15, the ½ width of a two-sided 90% confidence interval on the 
mean difference is expected to be 5.6. Thus, for example, if the mean difference is 6.0 units, 
a clinically relevant value for this population, the 90% two-sided confidence interval is 
expected to be on the order of (0.4, 11.6), suggesting that while only a minor effect cannot 
be ruled out, important positive effects of progesterone appear possible. In contrast, if there 
is no effect of progesterone we expect an interval centered around zero with i.e. (-5.6, 5.6). 
This initial study will thus provide important information about the magnitude of the effect of 
progesterone, and an indication of whether it is worthwhile to proceed with further trials. For 
TMS, results from Licht (personal communication) estimated the mean (median) value of 
TMS in a similar cohort to be 10.1 (10.0) with a standard deviation (SD) of 1.06 and range of 
8.0 to 13.5.  Conservatively assuming an SD that is 25% larger than that in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299] 
(SD=1.32), Table 1 shows that, with a sample size of 60 per group, two-sided 90% confidence 
intervals for the mean difference in TMS are anticipated to have a ½ width on the order of 
+0.44. Thus for TMS, if the mean difference is on the order of 2.0, the 90% confidence interval 
would be (1.56, 2.44). Estimated SD’s for VMWM are not yet available.  
 
Next we consider the categorical outcomes. In pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299] (Licht, personal communication),

then the endpoints of the 90% CI are (0.3%, 20.7%)This would suggest that while we could 
not rule out essentially a null effect of progesterone, the evidence would suggest a possible 
substantial effect. In contrast if there were no effect we expect the confidence interval to be 
centered near zero with endpoints of +11.8%%.  Similarly, if the post-operative increase in 
PVL is 38% in the control group, and the true effect size is 14%, then the 90% confidence 
interval is expected to have endpoints of the 90% CI are (-0.7%, 28.7%). Again, while we 
could not rule out essentially a null effect of progesterone, the evidence would suggest a 
possible substantial effect. In contrast if there were no effect we expect the confidence 
interval to be centered near zero with endpoints of +15.7%%. 
6.5       Interim Analysis 
No interim analysis is planned for this Phase II study.  
7 STUDY MEDICATION (STUDY DEVICE OR OTHER STUDY INTERVENTION) 
7.1 Description 
Crinone® (progesterone gel) is a bioadhesive vaginal gel containing micronized 
progesterone in an emulsion system, which is contained in single use, polypropylene vaginal 
applicators. The carrier vehicle is an oil-in-water emulsion containing the water swellable, but 
insoluble polymer, polycarbophil. The progesterone is partially soluble in both the oil and 
water phase of the vehicle, with the majority of the progesterone existing as a suspension. 
Physically, Crinone has the appearance of a soft, white to off-white gel.  
Replens is a hormone-free vaginal moisturizer.  Ingredients include purified water, 
glycerin, mineral oil, polycarbophil, carbomer homopolymer type B, hydrogenated palm oil, 
glyceride, sorbic acid, and sodium hydroxide.  This product will act as the placebo in this 
study. 
7.1.[ADDRESS_204728]-off cap. Each applicator delivers 1.125 grams of Crinone gel containing 90 
mg (8% gel) of progesterone in a base containing glycerin, mineral oil, polycarbophil, 
carbomer 934P, hydrogenated palm oil glyceride, sorbic acid, purified water and may contain 
sodium hydroxide. 
Replens Long-Lasting Moisturizer is supplied in pre-filled, sealed and individually 
wrapped applicators. 
Both Crinone 8% and Replens will be obtained from commercial sources and stored 
according to package labeling.  The investigational pharmacy will dispense the study 
medications in a blinded fashion by [CONTACT_175436].  The study medications will be dispensed as a 30 +/- 15 day supply.  
Occasionally the timing of prenatal visits to CHOP may require variation in the amount of 
drug supplied to a mother at one time.   
7.1.2 Labeling 
Study drug labeling will be in compliance with applicable local and national regulations 
   
   33
7.1.3 Dosing 
Crinone 8% is administered vaginally at a dose of [ADDRESS_204729] for 
the medication and placebo, which keeps track of anything that is received, dispensed and 
returned. 
8 SAFETY MANAGEMENT 
8.1 Clinical Adverse Events 
Clinical AEs will be monitored throughout the study.  
8.2 Adverse Event Reporting 
Unanticipated problems related to the research involving risks to subjects or others that 
occur during the course of this study (including SAEs) will be reported to the IRB in 
accordance with CHOP IRB SOP 408: Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects. 
AEs that are not serious but that are notable and could involve risks to subjects will be 
summarized in narrative or other format and submitted to the IRB at the time of continuing 
review.  
8.[ADDRESS_204730] who has received an 
intervention (drug, biologic, or other intervention).  The occurrence does not necessarily have 
to have a causal relationship with the treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable or 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related 
to the medicinal product. 
All AEs (including SAEs) will be noted in the study records and on the case report form 
with a full description including the nature, date and time of onset, determination of non-
serious versus serious, intensity (mild, moderate, severe), duration, causality, and outcome 
of the event. 
   
   34
8.4 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
An SAE is any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  
 death, 
 a life-threatening event (at risk of death at the time of the event),  
 requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], 
 a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or 
 a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject.   
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug event when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
A distinction should be drawn between serious and severe AEs.  A severe AE is a major 
event of its type.  A severe AE does not necessarily need to be considered serious.  For 
example, nausea which persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but 
would not be an SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disability may be considered a mild stroke, but would be an SAE.  
The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov ) provides a grading system that is used to categorize the severity of 
adverse events, as follows: 
Grade Severity Definition 
1 Mild Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated. 
2 Moderate Minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL). 
3 Severe Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-
threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24599]; disabling; limiting self-care ADL. 
4 Life-
threatening Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention 
indicated. 
[ADDRESS_204731] normal life functions.   
Expectedness  
The purpose of reporting is to provide new, important information on serious reactions or 
events previously unobserved or undocumented.  Therefore, all AEs will be evaluated as to 
whether their occurrence was unexpected, using the following definitions:  
Unexpected : An unexpected AE or adverse reaction is one for which the nature or 
severity is not consistent with information in the protocol, consent form, or product brochure. 
An AE or adverse reaction also may be categorized as unexpected if the event has not 
previously been observed at the same specificity and/or severity.    
   
   35
 
Expected : An event is considered expected if it is known to be associated with the study 
drug(s) and/or the disease state.  
Pregnant subjects:  The standard definition for SAE will be used (Section 7.4).   
However, the following adverse events will not be classified an SAE for the purposes of 
this study as they are expected events associated with pregnancy and delivery: 
a) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_175374] 
b) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_175375] a pre-existing condition  
c) Miscarriage  
d) Preterm labor / suspected preterm labor 
e) Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) / suspected PROM 
f) Preterm delivery  
g) Preterm delivery in maternal interest 
h) Preterm delivery in fetal interest 
i) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_175376] 
j) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] “maternal discomfort”  
k) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] “rest”  
l) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272]  “observation” o r “monitoring” for which the women are 
admitted for a period of less than 12 hours.   
Newborn subjects:  It is important to note at baseline these newborns are medically 
fragile pediatric patients requiring high-risk neonatal cardiothoracic surgery.  This puts them 
at risk for many expected adverse events and serious adverse events without any additional 
interventions.  In response to a surgical randomized clinical trial (RCT) run by [CONTACT_175437], a novel adverse event reporting system was developed for this 
medically fragile population.89  The system is based on the concept of the identification of 
“sentinel” SAEs .  For this study, these events will be  
a.  death 
b.  listing for cardiac transplantation 
c.  endocarditis 
d.  thromboe mbolic event 
e.  need for surgical or catheter-based intervention 
f.  heart block  
g.  hemolysis.   
The remaining adverse events will be organized in a code list by [CONTACT_6764].  We have 
used this system of sentinel SAE reporting with another RCT study Protocol No 10-007750.   
8.4.1 Relationship of SAE to Study Drug 
The relationship of each SAE to the study intervention should be characterized using one 
of the following terms in accordance with CHOP IRB Guidelines: definitely, probably, 
possibly, unlikely or unrelated.

8.5 IRB Notification of SAEs and Other Unanticipated Problems 
The Investigator will promptly notify the IRB of all on-site unanticipated, serious Adverse 
Events that are related to the research activity. Other unanticipated problems related to the 
research involving risk to subjects or others will also be reported promptly. Written reports 
will be filed using the eIRB system and in accordance with the timeline below. External SAEs 
that are both unexpected and related to the study intervention will be reported promptly after 
the investigator receives the report. 
8.5.1 Follow-up report 
If an SAE has not resolved at the time of the initial report and new information arises that 
changes the investigator’s assessment of the event, a follow-up report including all relevant 
new or reassessed information (e.g., concomitant medication, medical history) should be 
submitted to the IRB. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all SAE are followed 
until either resolved or stable.  
8.[ADDRESS_204732]. Putt, will generate a block randomization schedule based 
on stratification by [CONTACT_175418]: TGA, HLHS, and other CHD. The randomization 
schedule will be based on equal allocation of subjects to the progesterone and placebo arms 
within each block. The schedule will be generated using variable block sizes. Upon 
confirmation of eligibility in the DMS, the randomization module will be programmed to 
generate a randomization number that corresponds to a unique kit number of progesterone 
or placebo treatment. This kit number will be used to distribute treatment.

9.4 Regulatory and Ethical Considerations 
9.4.1 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
The purpose of this Data and Safety Monitoring Plan is to ensure the safety of research 
participants and the integrity of the research data. 
Safety of Research Participant:  
Protection of the rights and welfare of subjects and their families will be maintained during 
the recruitment, consenting process, and study participation.  [CONTACT_175454] and his study team 
have over a 15-year experience in recruiting and enrolling patients for research studies in the 
Cardiac Center.  Subject privacy and confidentiality will be maintained as described in Section 
8.3.  All research responsibilities delegated by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_175379], federal regulations, federal, state 
and local laws and institutional policies and procedures.  The study team has two research 
nurses, one of which is a Certified Clinical Research Coordinator (CCRC).  If any the results 
of research procedures appear to be important for immediate clinical care, these results will 
be provided to the Principal Investigator ([CONTACT_175454]) of the study who will forward the 
information to the subject’s surgeon, cardiologist and/or primary physician.  
The Principal Investigator ([CONTACT_175454]) and Co-Investigators (Drs. Rychik, Szwast, 
Johnson, Gebb, and Licht,) will be responsible for reviewing subject enrollment data, 
maternal events, and clinical event data as described in Section 7.[ADDRESS_204736] (DSMB): 
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board has been established. The members have 
expertise in maternal-fetal medicine, pediatric neurology, pediatric critical care, peri-operative 
care of the neonate with CHD, and neurodevelopmental outcomes for patients with CHD. 
The DSMB will review the protocol with respect to ethical and safety standards and making 
recommendations as necessary. This committee will monitor the emerging results for safety 
and efficacy. The DSMB will also review the performance of the trial in terms of recruitment, 
protocol adherence and data quality. The interval and timing of DSMB meetings after the 
initial review of the protocol will be at the discretion of the committee itself.

9.4.[ADDRESS_204737] of vaginal progesterone administration is local irritation. A recent 
randomized trial of Crinone vaginal gel vs. intramuscular progesterone during ART showed 
that patient satisfaction in terms of ease of administration, convenience of administration and 
discomfort was significantly greater for patients receiving Crinone.90 Additional supportive 
evidence of safety and efficacy is found in the 2011 FDA Advisory Committee Briefing Book. 
(Attached to application) 
 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_175382], the vaginal progesterone gel has been well tolerated with few adverse 
effects. The most common effect is vaginal irritation which will be treated with sitz baths; and 
for severe cases a low potency topi[INVESTIGATOR_6702] (hydrocortisone 1 % cream). If a woman 
goes into preterm labor, this will be treated according to standard clinical protocols. We 
anticipate that need to terminate study drug prior to 39 weeks or delivery (if earlier) will be 
infrequent. 
Risks to Fetus and Newborn 
The effects of progesterone on perinatal outcomes and the neonate are of special 
interest. A recent meta-analysis attempted to quantify the effect of progesterone therapy for 
the prevention of preterm birth on perinatal outcomes.[ADDRESS_204738] also been evaluated.36 
Surviving children from a trial of 17-OHP-C vs. placebo to prevent preterm birth underwent 
physical examination and developmental screening at 48 months of age. Progesterone 
therapy was not associated with any adverse physical or neurodevelopmental sequelae.36 
Risk Assessment for Pre-Natal Evaluations 
Fetal Magnetic Resonance Imaging:   
All of the fetal brain MRI examinations performed in this study will be during the 25th week 
GA or beyond. No MRI will be performed in the first half of pregnancy or embryonic period. 
None of the studies will be performed with gadolinium contrast administration. None of the 
studies will be done with sedation or general anesthesia. General MRI safety guidelines for 
metallic objects in the MRI environment will be monitored as part of standard practice by [CONTACT_175439]. At the Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684], 
clinical fetal MRI studies are routinely and safely performed at [ADDRESS_204739] scientific 
evidence of harmful effects with short-term exposure to high static magnetic fields.91 Two to 
three decades of practice generally supports this widely-held belief. 78, 79 FDA guidelines now 
classify MRI devices as “nonsignificant risk” when neonates (infants less than one month of 
age) are scanned at a static magnetic field of 4T or less. As a result, it has become 
widespread routine clinical practice to scan even the youngest premature infants who are 
stable for transport. Myers and coworkers reported no significant reduction in fetal growth in 
74 volunteer subjects exposed in utero to MRI vs. matched controls.92 Also the recent practice 
parameter from the American College of Radiology and the Society for Pediatric Radiology 
for fetal MRI states, “At this stage, the preponderance of research studies have failed to 
discover any reproducible harmful effects of exposure of the mother or developi[INVESTIGATOR_175383] 3T or weaker magnetic fields used in the routine clinical MR imaging process.”[ADDRESS_204740] will be 
used. 
A “potential” side effect of the MRI environment is exposure to high sound levels.  Baker 
and associates reported no demonstrable increase in disease, disability, or hearing loss in 
[ADDRESS_204741]-Natal Evaluations 
Transport:  
This is a high-risk group of subjects being transported from the cardiac intensive care unit 
(CICU) to the MRI suite. The risks of transport include exposure to cooling temperatures, 
dislodging arterial and venous lines and accidental extubation. To accomplish safe transport 
of subjects, all subject transports will be performed by a team of cardiac anesthesiologists 
including an attending, a fellow and a respi[INVESTIGATOR_105489].  This team of physicians has a 
great deal of experience both in transporting high-risk neonates (n>200) to the MRI suite for 
preoperative and post-operative studies. 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging:   
MRI is an electromagnetic imaging technique that does not use ionizing radiation such as 
x-rays to obtain the images; as such there are minimal risks involved with this technique.  The 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guideline for average specific absorption ratio (SAR) is 
3W/kg over the head for 10min. The SAR level of this CASL sequence, calculated using 
quasi-static approximation (spherical head model), is 1W/kg on an average head size with 
radius of 10cm. The SAR level is also automatically calculated and monitored by [CONTACT_175440] (IEC [ZIP_CODE]-
2-33, accepted by [CONTACT_55257]). A mean SAR level (percent of maximal allowable SAR) of 
54.5±15.6% (40-80%) was observed on 13 healthy adult subjects (radiology in press paper). 
The SAR level actually is lower in children and infants than in adults because it is roughly 
proportional to the square of the head size (radius).96 The 3T CASL method is therefore very 
safe for pediatric imaging.  
 
Sedation for the Pre-Operative MRI:  
   
   [ADDRESS_204742]-Operative MRI:  
For the post-operative MRI procedure, primary consideration will be given toward the 
possibility of a non-sedated, “sated sleep” protocol. All infants will be transported to and from 
the MRI scanner by a team of pediatric cardiac anesthesiologists. For a sated-sleep MRI the 
infant would be held NPO for [ADDRESS_204743] 
swaddled with warm blankets. The infant would then be offered formula/breast milk ad-lib or 
as recommended by [CONTACT_175441]. When postprandial sleep is achieved the subject is 
placed in the scanner. The MRI sequences will be run in order of relative importance to the 
study, with T1 MPR and DWI taking highest priority. 
The decision to use the sated sleep protocol will be made by [CONTACT_40420]. Susan Nicolson 
or [CONTACT_175455] and it will be done on a patient-by-patient basis. There are some 
concerns that may make this procedure untenable: first, the patient must tolerate oral feeds 
to be eligible for such a protocol; second, agitation in a post-operative infant may cause 
unsafe increase in blood pressure. The advantages are clear and include primarily decreased 
risk of respi[INVESTIGATOR_175384]. 
If a “sated sleep” MRI procedure is not an option (if the infant is not tolerating oral feeds, 
for instance), an individualized sedation protocol will be administered by [CONTACT_175442]-operative MRI scan. The sedation will follow protocols that have established 
safety and have been used successfully in the past. The medications used for sedation will 
be determined by [CONTACT_175443]. All subjects will have heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturations 
monitored throughout the study. Any deviation in oxygen saturations of more than 10% would 
necessitate the discontinuation of the study and immediate medical evaluation of the subject.   
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_175385]-operative and post-operative MRI suggest that these 
are safe procedures with our research team. In this study we expect similar results. This 
notwithstanding, enrollment for this study will be halted temporarily if two subjects experience 
vital sign fluctuations that require termination of their MRI. Enrollment will not resume until 
independent review of procedures determines the safety for continuation. All adverse events 
will promptly be reported to the IRB. All SAEs will be reported to the board within [ADDRESS_204744] privacy and the Investigator and 
other site personnel will not use such data and records for any purpose other than conducting 
the study.   
   
   42
Blood Work for Mothers/Fathers  
Taking blood may cause some pain, bleeding or bruising at the spot where the needle 
enters your body. Rarely, taking blood may cause fainting or infection.   
Blood Work for Infant 
The sample will be obtained from an existing central venous or arterial line, which is 
associated with minimal risk of pain or complication. 
18-month Developmental and Medical Follow-Up  
There are no physical risks but toddler-age children may become uncooperative.  The 
Neonatal follow-up team has over [ADDRESS_204745]-operative MRI has been 
demonstrated in a related study. Over the course of this study, entitled “Hemodynamic 
Neuroimaging” (IRB # 4357), 7.4% of participants (2/27) from the same target population 
have benefitted directly from a post-operative brain MRI; including one patient whose MRI 
revealed an incidental finding of a pre-symptomatic hyperacute non-occlusive sino-venous 
thrombus of both transverse sinuses, also involving the torcula. This condition is life-
threatening, and the post-operative MRI allowed physicians to intervene early with both 
primary and secondary prevention. The other patient’s MRI revealed an arterial ischemic 
stroke, which allowed for early secondary prevention. For all subjects in the present study, 
[CONTACT_175456] will meet with the parents to review all the imaging data. The significance of injury, 
if present, will be explained to the parents in layman language and interventional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_175386]. 
Current data demonstrates that some degree of neurobehavioral disability is present on 
over 50% of survivors of cardiac surgery in the newborn period. Indeed, neurodevelopmental 
disability is now recognized as the most common complication of critical CHD (i.e. those 
patients requiring cardiac surgery in infancy) and has the most negative impact on quality of 
life, academic performance and opportunity for independence as an adult. Regardless of their 
origin, neurodevelopmental problems adversely affect learning and the attainment of 
academic, social, and vocational skills. Ultimately they undermine mental health and 
employment opportunities in adulthood. There is a wealth of disturbing data documenting the 
impact of neurodevelopmental deficits among children and adults affected by [CONTACT_175405]. The need 
for special and rehabilitative services results in significant costs to the patients’ families and 
to society. A potential benefit of the study is a reduced incidence of neurobehavioral disability 
leading to lower health care costs for society. 
   
   43
9.4.4 Risk-Benefit Assessment 
Risk-Benefit Ratio: 
There are significant potential benefits to the mother and fetus including prolongation of 
pregnancy, and improved brain development, with a reduction in peri-operative white injury 
leading to better long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Previous studies indicate that 
maternal progesterone therapy during the third trimester is associated with only a minor 
increase above minimal risk.  
As outlined above, there is a possibility of collateral benefit from participation in the MRI 
assessments, however because of the potential need for sedation, this is a greater than 
minimal risk study with prospect for collateral benefit (Subpart D category §46.406 or §50.53).  
9.5 Recruitment Strategy (or Case Ascertainment) 
Subjects will be recruited from the Cardiac Center at CHOP. Eligible mothers and with a 
fetus with a prenatal diagnosis of CHD, who are followed by [CONTACT_175444], will be 
recruited in person during a prenatal visit. 
We plan to enroll sufficient patients to have 80 evaluable patients (40 per treatment group) 
at the 18 month neurodevelopmental testing. Based on known clinical outcomes for this 
patient population and experience with other studies with similar follow-up plans, we estimate 
a 5% early mortality and a further 20% attrition from all causes between hospi[INVESTIGATOR_175387] 18 month evaluation. There may also be dropout prior to birth for a variety of reasons: 
fetal death, intolerance of therapy, withdrawal from study. We do not have accurate data to 
estimate this loss. We anticipate needing to enroll 110-[ADDRESS_204746] a sufficient cohort 
at 18 months (40 per treatment group). We will use the IRB approved Cardiac Center 
Research Intro Sheet. This sheet is given to families in CICU and families followed by [CONTACT_175445]-
operatively. [See current version attached in appendix section].  In addition, we plan to 
develop a study specific brochure similar to that used in the OPPTIMUM trial (attached in 
appendix), which we will submit for IRB approval.     
9.6 Informed Consent/Assent and HIPAA Authorization 
[CONTACT_175454] and/or one of the research nurses will approach eligible families in person 
during a prenatal visit or upon admission to CHOP and ask their permission to review the 
research study.  If families are willing, the following informed consent process will be initiated 
in order to assure subjects comprehend the purpose of the study, the study procedures, and 
the risk-benefit profile.   
1. The research protocol will be reviewed verbally. 
2. The consent form document will be reviewed. 
3. The HIPAA authorization form will be reviewed. 
4. Time will be provided for questions and decision making. There will be ongoing 
discussion with the parents to give them adequate time to consider participation.    
[CONTACT_175454] and/or one of the research nurses will approach eligible families in person during 
an outpatient visit or upon admission to CHOP and ask their permission to review the consent 
addendum. If families are willing, the following informed consent process will be initiated in 
order to assure subjects comprehend the purpose of the consent addendum, the additional 
study procedures, and the risk-benefit profile. 
1. The research protocol will be reviewed verbally. 
   
   44
2. The consent addendum form document will be reviewed. 
3. Time will be provided for questions and decision making. 
 
9.7 Payment to Subjects/Families 
9.7.1 Reimbursement for travel, parking and meals 
At the time of both fetal brain MRIs, mothers will be reimbursed for travel, parking, need 
for baby[CONTACT_35061], and meals. This will average between $130 (local)-$900 (outside the tristate 
needing hotel and airfare) based on where mothers reside during study period.   
At the 18-month follow-up families will be reimbursed for travel, parking, need for 
baby[CONTACT_35061], and meals.  We have budgeted $425-500 on average per family based on a 
range of $190 for families coming by [CONTACT_175446] (70% referral base), $600 for 
families coming by [CONTACT_175447] (13% 
of referral base) to $1300 for families coming by [CONTACT_175448]-two hotel night stay (17% of our 
referral base).   
9.7.2 Payments to parent for time and inconvenience (i.e. compensation) 
Upon completion of each fetal brain MRI each mother will be given a $50.[ADDRESS_204747] to 
compensate for time and inconvenience.

Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is an autosomal dominant development syndrome caused by 
[CONTACT_519755]1 gene on chromosome 17. The NF1 gene is responsible for 
production of a protein called neurofibromin that is involved in the RAS pathway (RASopathy) 
and which is needed for normal function in many human cell types. NF1 is one of the most 
common genetic disorders, is not limited by a person’s race or sex, and causes tumors along the 
nervous system which can grow anywhere on the body.  
 
A mutation or deletion of one allele of the NF1 gene is enough for the development of NF1, 
although presentation varies widely. It is an age specific disease; most signs of NF1 occur as the 
person ages and has hormonal changes. As of 2015, there were at least 100,[ADDRESS_674122] the 
person's quality of life. Even in this last group, signs and symptoms are rarely life-threatening.  
 
Cutaneous neurofibromas are a common manifestation of NF1. The gene product neurofibromin 
negatively regulates RAS activity and acts as a tumor suppressor by [CONTACT_519756]/MEK/ERK pathway.  
NFlection. 
 
1.1 Study Rationale 
NFlection tested the efficacy of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_519726] a novel MEK inhibitor (NFX-179) in an 
ex vivo model by [CONTACT_519757]. Dose dependent suppression of 
the shared biomarker, p-ERK, by [CONTACT_519758]-179 (0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%) was observed in human 
cutaneous neurofibroma explants. p-ERK suppression was not observed in neurofibroma 
explants treated with the vehicle formulation.

Date: 24-JUL-2020   Page 18 of 78   Supersedes: NEW Western Blot analysis of p-ERK level showed complete suppression of p-ERK by [CONTACT_519759]-179 in the top sections of the explant and a dose dependent suppression in the 
bottom sections.  
 
Taken together, these data clearly demonstrate that NFX-179 (0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%) can penetrate 
human epi[INVESTIGATOR_519727] p-ERK in human cutaneous neurofibroma explants.  
 
This clinical study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NFX-179 after 28 days of 
once-daily (QD) application in subjects with NF1 tumors. 
 
1.2 Background 
1.2.1 Nonclinical Experience 
NFX-179 was well tolerated in the rat following a single oral administration of doses up to 1000 
mg/kg.  Following multiple dosing for up to 21 days NFX-179 was well tolerated at up to 300 
mg/kg/day (the highest dose tested).  
 
In the rat, following subcutaneous administration NFX-179 was well tolerated with single doses 
up to 300 mg/kg. Following multiple dosing for up to 14 days, one main study animal (100 
mg/kg) and one TK animal (300 mg/kg) were pre-terminally euthanized on Day [ADDRESS_674123] dosing site associated with thickening and SC mottling, but the cause of poor condition could 
not be identified. 
 
After a single subcutaneous dose, the systemic exposure was low relative to oral administration 
and increased in a less than proportional manner with dose.  The very low exposure suggests that 
the dose remains in the skin as a depot and may be released very slowly.  
 
Over 21 days of subcutaneous administration there was an increase in exposure so that it was 
similar to that seen following repeated oral administration.

1 mL/kg/dose. In this study there was very slight erythema and very slight edema were noted in a 
single animal at both 1% and 1.5% formulations on Days 7 and 8. 
 
Systemic exposure following dermal administration was low after single dose increasing on 
repeat dosing. 
 
NFX-179 was assessed in a 28-day study.  Minipi[INVESTIGATOR_519728] 0, 0.5, 1.0 or 1.5% at a dose 
volume of 2 mL/kg/day.  Following the onset of dermal lesions and clinical signs in the majority 
of the study animals (including controls), treatment of the animals was stopped following 5 to 9 
days of dosing (depending on replicates).  The observations recorded included but were not 
limited to slight to severe erythema; brown skin rash and discoloration; elevated body 
temperature; elevated neutrophil counts.  These clinical signs were seen in all animals, including 
controls receiving vehicle only. 
 
The clinical observations were considered to be due to the inherent irritancy of the vehicle 
formulation (1+ erythema) which caused unexpected reactions and then due to residency of 
NFX-[ADDRESS_674124] been conducted with NFX-179.

determine volume throughout the study. The assigned study medication will be applied the 
Target cNF Tumors once daily (QD) during the 28-day treatment period. 
 
At Visit 2 (Day 1) eligible subjects will be randomized and will begin the 28-day QD 
treatment period. 
 
Subjects will be seen at Visits 3 and 4 (Days 8 and 15) for follow-up visits during the 
treatment period. At Visit 5 (Day 29) subjects will be seen for the last treatment period visit, 
will have the 5 Target cNF Tumors and the 1 Untreated cNF Tumor excised 4 (±1) hours after 
the last study medication application, and will start a 28-day no treatment follow-up period. 
Subjects will be seen at Visit 6 (Day 36-50) for follow-up care of the Visit 5 excision wounds. 
Subjects will be seen for Visit 7 (Day 57) for an end of study visit.

4.13.1 Verification of blinding 
Blinding of the study medications is important for validity of this study. This study uses a 
double-blind design. The study medications are indistinguishable in appearance, packaging and 
labeling. 
 
4.13.2 Unblinding the study medication 
Blinding is important for validity of this study; however, the blind may be broken in the event of 
a medical emergency in which knowledge of the study medication identity is critical to the 
management of the subject’s course of treatment. Before breaking the blind, the investigator 
should determine that the information is necessary ( i.e., that it will alter the subject’s immediate 
course of treatment). In many cases, particularly when the emergency is clearly not study 
medication-related, the problem may be effectively managed by [CONTACT_519767].  
 
If deemed necessary to break the blind for a study subject, attempt to contact [CONTACT_519768]. If it is not possible to contact [CONTACT_519769], contact [CONTACT_39420]/him as soon as possible after breaking the blind for a subject. 
 
To identify a subject’s study medication, locate the second panel of the Subject Kit tear-off label 
attached to the subject’s CRF and follow the unblinding instructions on the label. Record the date 
of unblinding, the reason for unblinding and the initials of the investigational center staff 
member who performed the unblinding in the subject’s CRF. 
 
Any subject whose blind has been broken must be discharged from the study.

7.1.1 Adverse Event (AE) 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign or symptom 
associated with the use of an investigational product (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
whether or not related to the investigational product.  
 
Thus, any new, CR worsening of an existing sign, symptom or disease, should be considered an 
AE.  
 
Worsening of the any Target cNF assessment should be reported as an AE only if the use of 
the study medication is interrupted or discontinued or other therapy is required to manage 
the event. 
 
Every new epi[INVESTIGATOR_519744] a chronic condition ( e.g., headaches, 
allergies, depression, and hypertension) should be reported as a separate AE, even if the 
condition is reported in the subject’s medical history. 
 
The investigator should, when certain, report a diagnosis rather than the signs, symptoms or 
clinically relevant abnormal laboratory values associated with the AE. Otherwise, signs, 
symptoms or abnormal laboratory values may be used to describe the AE. 
 
An abnormality discovered ( e.g., clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities), prior to the first 
study medication application, should be reported as medical history, not as an AE.

vehicle group after 4 weeks of treatment will be assessed. A comparison between NFX-179 
treated tumors and vehicle treated tumors will also be performed. Summaries and analyses 
will be based primarily on non-missing data. Extent of exposure using serum levels of NFX-
179 will be evaluated. 
 
Details of the proposed statistical analysis will be documented in the Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP), which will be written following finalization of the protocol and prior to any unblinding 
of data. 
 
As this is an early phase clinical study, additional exploratory analyses not necessarily 
identified in the SAP may also be performed to support the clinical development program. 
Any post-hoc, or unplanned, analyses not identified in the SAP will be clearly identified in the 
Clinical Study Report in accordance with ICH E3. 
 
8.3.2 Baseline Assessment 
Descriptive statistics will be performed on relevant Visit 1 and Visit 2 data ( i.e., data collected 
prior to the treatment administration) and on demographic characteristics. There will be no 
formal comparison of baseline data, that is, no statistical hypothesis testing. 
 
The number and percentage of subjects enrolled in each study site will be presented by 
[CONTACT_519774] ( e.g., cNF generalized severe, cNF, generalized intermediate). 
 
8.3.[ADDRESS_674225] primary objective is to determine the pharmacodynamic activity of NFX-179 Gel as 
defined by [CONTACT_135673] p-ERK levels in the Target cNF Tumors in the NFX-179 Gel treatment 
groups as compared to Vehicle Gel group after 28 days of QD treatment. This will be assessed

to compare mean p-ERK level between each active treatment group and the vehicle treatment 
group, with treatment as the independent factor. Within each subject, both the mean and the 
median p-ERK levels will first be calculated across all [ADDRESS_674226] will be used in exploratory analyses to determine whether the inclusion of this 
reference level in analysis models may increase sensitivity. 
 
The second primary objective is to determine the safety and tolerability of treatment with NFX-
179 Gel (0.05%, 0.15% and 0.50%) or Vehicle Gel applied QD for 28 days of treatment. The 
frequency of dermal safety and tolerability assessments including pain/burning, pruritus, 
erythema, edema, scabbing/crusting, and vesiculation/erosion will be summarized by [CONTACT_29014]. All data will be listed. The third primary objective of evaluating adverse events 
will be based on summaries and listings of adverse events by [CONTACT_1570], as described 
below under Safety Analyses. 
 
The first secondary objective is to determine the clinical efficacy of NFX-[ADDRESS_674227] primary endpoint.

treated tumors. Descriptive statistics will be produced, where applicable. Safety assessments 
will be summarized across all subjects. Summaries will be provided by [CONTACT_519775]. 
 
Extent of exposure using serum levels of NFX-179 will be evaluated. 
Adverse events noted during the study will be coded to system organ classes (SOCs) and 
preferred terms (PTs) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
dictionary. The number and percentage of subjects with pre-treatment and treatment emergent 
AEs (TEAEs) will be summarized by [CONTACT_3592]. TEAEs will also be presented as on- 
treatment and post-treatment. All AE details will be listed. As the risk profile of NFX-[ADDRESS_674230] in human study, all AEs will be considered in 
determining the safety profile of NFX-179 unless obviously unrelated. 
 
Descriptive summaries of laboratory assessments will be presented for each time point, for 
actual values and changes from baseline. 
 
Other safety assessments, such as physical examination will also be summarized. 
Prior and concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization 
(WHO) drug dictionary. Prior and concomitant medications will be listed and summarized by

9.1. Training 
For each investigational center, participants will be trained to the protocol, study specific 
procedures, and the CRFs. Those unable to attend the training must receive on-site training from 
an appropriately trained individual prior to participating in any of the procedures and evaluations 
in this study.  
Clinical Research Associates (CRAs) and other applicable personnel will be trained prior to 
study initiation to familiarize CRAs with the disease, the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), 
the protocol and other study specific items.  Team organization, communication and operational 
issues will also be discussed. 
NFlection will provide an investigational center file to each center. 
 
9.2. Data Collection 
The investigator must maintain required records for all study subjects.  Data for this study will be 
recorded in the subject's source document and on the eCRFs.  All data on these CRFs should be 
recorded completely and promptly.  A copy of the completed eCRFs for each subject will be 
retained by [CONTACT_118250]. 
 
Records of the subject’s participation in this study will be held confidential except as disclosure 
is required by [CONTACT_2371]. The study doctor, NFlection, persons working on behalf of NFlection, and 
under certain circumstances, the [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration and the 
Institutional Review Board will be able to inspect and copy confidential study-related records 
that identify subjects by [CONTACT_2300]. Therefore, absolute subject confidentiality cannot be guaranteed. 
If the results of this study are published or presented at meetings, the subject’s identity will not 
be revealed. 
 
9.3. Data Management 
Data Management activities of this study will be subcontracted.  Edit checks and review 
processes will be performed by [CONTACT_17210]-contractor until all data clarifications are resolved. The 
data will be exported to be stored in SAS datasets (or equivalent) by [CONTACT_17210]-contractor. After all

locked. 
9.4. Study Monitoring 
Before an investigational center can enter a patient into the study, a representative of NFlection 
will visit the investigational study site to: 
 Determine the adequacy of the facilities 
 Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities regarding 
protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of NFlection or its representatives.  This will 
be documented in a Clinical Study Agreement between NFlection and the investigator. 
 
During the study, a monitor from NFlection or representative will have regular contacts with the 
investigational center, for the following: 
 Provide information and support to the investigator(s) 
 Confirm that facilities remain acceptable 
 Confirm that the investigational center staff is adhering to the protocol, that data are 
being accurately recorded in the case report forms, and that investigational product 
accountability checks are being performed 
 Perform source data verification.  This includes a comparison of the data in the case 
report forms with the patient’s medical records at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7117], and other 
records relevant to the study.  This will require direct access to all original records for 
each patient ( e.g., clinic charts). 
 Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to NFlection 
 Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on CRFs and confirm any SAEs 
have been forwarded to NFlection and those SAEs that met criteria for reporting have 
been forwarded to the IRB 
 
The monitor will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other investigational 
center staff needs information or advice. 
 
9.5. Source Documentation 
Investigators must keep accurate separate records (other than the CRFs) of all subjects' visits that 
include all pertinent study related information.  A statement should be made indicating that the 
subjects have been enrolled in this clinical study and have provided written informed consent.

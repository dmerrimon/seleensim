pharmacokinetic 
profile of 
amiodarone, reducing 
the exclusion criteria 
to 60 days still allows

achieve electrical pulmonary vein  isolation (PVI) from the rest of the 
left atrium (LA).  
Investigators may use their preferred approach to obtain PVI , such as  
antral or wide area circumferential ablation (WACA) targeting PVs 
individually or PV pairs ipsilaterally.   
PVI must be confirmed by [CONTACT_382893] [ADDRESS_479769]  ablation around the respective PV.   Targeting non -PV foci and 
complex fractionated electrograms  (CFAE)  is not recommended in this 
investigation.  If the investigator identifies additional focal or macro -
reentrant atrial sites to be clinically relevant to  AF and requiring 
ablation, the ablation location will be documented.  
Primary Safety 
Endpoint  The primary safety endpoint is defined as freedom from a composite of 
serious adverse events (SAE) occurring within 30-days and clinically 
symptomatic pulmonary vein stenosis through [ADDRESS_479770] -index 
ablation procedure , as adjudicated by [CONTACT_382894] (CEC) for relatedness to the procedure or device .  
The primary safety  device - or procedure -related SAE composite will be 
the combined r ate of the following events :     
• Atrioesophageal fistula  
• Bleeding complication  
• Cardiac tamponade / perforation  
• Death  
• Extended hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Myocardial infarction  
• Pericarditis  
• Phrenic nerve paralysis  
• Pulmonary edema  
• Pulmonary vein stenosis  
• Stroke post-ablation     
• Thromboembolism  
• Transient ischemic attack (TIA) post -ablation  
• Vagal nerve injury  
• Vascular access complications

Primary 
Effectiveness 
Endpoint  The primary effectiveness endpoint is defined as freedom from 
documented atrial fibrillation (AF ), atrial flutter * (AFL) and atrial 
tachycardia (AT)  epi[INVESTIGATOR_382826] ([ADDRESS_479771] -ablation procedure) through the end of the e ffectiveness 
evaluation period ( 12-month  follow -up post -ablation procedure).   
An effectiveness failure is defined by [CONTACT_19518]:  
• Inability to electrically isolate all accessible targeted pulmonary 
veins during the ablation procedure  
• Docume nted epi[INVESTIGATOR_298261] , AFL or AT  lasting ≥ 30 seconds in 
duration as evidenced by [CONTACT_382895]  
• DC cardioversion for AF, AFL or AT during the effectiveness 
evaluation period  
• A repeat ablation procedure to treat  AF, AFL or AT  during the 
effectiveness evaluation period  
• Use of a new or modification to existing Class I -IV anti -
arrhythmic drug (AAD) regimen to treat AF , AFL or AT  
recurrence during the effectiveness evaluation period  
• Use of a non -study device for ablation of any AF targets during 
the index or repeat ablation procedure  during the blanking period  
• More than one (1) repeat ablation procedure  during the blanking 
period  
*  Occurrence and/or ablation of cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) -dependent AFL, 
as confirmed by [CONTACT_382896] a primary effectiveness failure because it is not 
considered an iatrogenic arrhythmia following a left atrial ablation 
procedure for AF.    
Secondary Endpoints  Secondary endpoints to characterize the performance of the 
DiamondTemp Ablation System, relative to the control device, will 
include:  
• Mean duration of  individual  RF ablations (seconds) . 
• Mean cumulative RF time per procedure  (minutes) .     
• Freedom from a composite of SAE  occurring within 7-days post -
index ablation procedure as adjudicated by [CONTACT_382897] .  
• Freedom  from documented AF, AT and AFL * epi[INVESTIGATOR_382827] [ADDRESS_479772] -

4. INTRODUCTION  
4.1. Atrial Fibrillation (AF) and Clinical  Need  
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinically -significant cardiac arrhythmia. It is a 
major public health concern in the [LOCATION_002] , affecting an estimated 2.3 million people in 
North America and 4.5 million people in Europe[1]. It has been projected that the prevalence 
of AF will increase 2.5 fold during the next 50 years in the [LOCATION_002] [2]. AF is associated 
with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and the prevalence increases over time 
due to the aging population and an increase in age -specific occurrence of AF [3-5].  
Symptoms of AF vary with the ventricular rate, underlying functional st atus, duration of AF, 
presence and degree of structural heart disease, and individual patient perception; however, 
most patients with AF complain of palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], angina, dyspnea, fatigue, or dizziness. AF 
also significantly impairs quality of life, with u p to two -thirds of patients reporting it is 
disruptive and debilitating to their lives [6-8]. AF is an abnormal heart rhythm that has been 
classified as  recurrent when two or more epi[INVESTIGATOR_382832]. If these epi[INVESTIGATOR_382833], then  it is classified as paroxysmal AF 
(PAF).  PAF accounts fo r approximately 40 to 45 percent of AF cases. [4, 9]  
AF is a sustained arrhythmia characterized by  [CONTACT_382901], which can be diagnosed on an ECG  by [CONTACT_171338] a P -wave and 
irregular QRS complexes . The disorganized atrial activation appears as “ fibrillatory ” waves 
activating the atria at a rate generall y between 350 and 600 beats/min and the syncytial 
contraction of the atria is replaced by [CONTACT_382902]. While AF can occur in 
isolation, it may also be associated with other arrhythmias such as atrial flutter or atrial 
tachycardia.  
The electro physiological mechanisms responsible for AF may include rapid focal 
tachyarrhythmia in the pulmonary veins (PVs) and/or other atrial regions with fibrillatory 
conduction, multiple reentrant wavelet conduction initiated by [CONTACT_382903] 
(PACs) and/or atrial tachyarrhythmia , and/or formation of stable or unstable reentrant circuits 
of very short cycle lengths that generate fibrillatory conduction [10, 11].  
Of all electrophysiological mechanisms responsible for A F, of significant interest are the PVs 
which ha ve been identified to play a critical role in triggering and maintaining AF. 
Haissaguerre and colleagues have demonstrated that in most AF patients , the focus is in one 
of the PVs  [12].  
The choice of therapy for AF is influenced by [CONTACT_279016], asso ciated structural heart 
disease, severity of symptoms and whether the AF is classified as recurrent paroxysmal, 
recurrent persistent or permanent. Although AF can be problematic to manage medically due 
to its progressive nature, there are multiple therapie s in current use for the treatment of AF, 
and many of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_382834] -optimal for most patients. Treatment options include 
medical management, pacing, cardioversion, implantable devices, surgery and ablation 
therapy to eliminate the arrhythmia  [4, 13].  
Of all therapeutic strategies for AF one of interest is radiofrequency catheter ablation 
(RFCA) as a potential curative treatment.  RFCA for the treatment of AF is a commonly 
performed procedure for symptomatic patients in whom medications are either ineffective or

not tolerated [4, 9, 14]. RFCA restores normal sinus rhythm by [CONTACT_382904] y through a 
catheter  at targeted focal sites to disrupt abnormal electrical activity. The most comm on 
catheter ablation approach to treat AF is to electrically isolate the PVs (PVI) .  Other 
approaches used  include WACA  and CFAE  ablation . Additional focal o r macro -reentrant 
atrial sites  may be ablated but the approach varies from center to center.   
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_382835], 
Neuzil and colleagues report that refractory recurrence of arrhythmia remains a continuing 
concern with recurrence rates of AF after RFCA  still remain ing relatively high (20-55%) [15] 
and perhaps attributed to lack of transmural lesions during PVI[16]. Technological innovations 
in RFCA include multi -electrode ablation catheters, high resolution ablation catheters, force -
sensing technologies and navigation tec hnologies . 
4.2. Prior Clinical Evide nce for RF Ablation to Treat  PAF   
Ablation has become the standard of care in many centers due to the superiority of catheter 
ablation to AADs.  The first two classes of devices to seek and achieve FDA approval for 
ablation of PAF were an irrigated RF catheter (ThermoC ool, Biosense Webster ) and a 
cryoballoon  ablation catheter  (ArticFront , Medtronic ).  The prospective randomized studies  
for these devices  demonstrat ed the safety and  efficacy  and the superiority of catheter  ablation 
over drug thera py in drug refractory patients .[17, 18]   
Subsequent approval studies of new ablation technologies have been either compared with a 
previously -approved device with the same indications for use in a randomized, controlled 
non-inferiority  study or, in the case of a second -generation RF ablation catheter, compared 
with predefined perform ance goals in a single -arm study .   
Recently, two catheters have  been developed to measure real-time contact [CONTACT_382905] , a concept where force is  one of the primary fac tors determining lesion si ze. One 
cathet er uses three optical fibers to measure the micro -deformation of a deformable body in 
the catheter tip (TactiCath, St Jude Medical, Inc orporated ), which correlates with tip force [19-
21]. The second catheter uses a small spring between the ablatio n tip electrode and the 
cathe ter shaft, with a tiny magnetic transmitter in the tip and magnetic  sensors  to measure 
microdeflection of the spring (ThermoCool SmartTouch, Biosense  Webster, Inc.), 
corresponding to tip  force[22-24]. 
The TactiCath catheter was evaluated in the FDA investigational  study, TOCCASTAR 
clinical trial[25]. In this prospective, randomized clinical trial, [ADDRESS_479785] force sensing  
Thermo Cool ablation cathete r. No difference in efficacy was observed, with success rates of 
67.8% and 69.4% in the contact [CONTACT_17611] (CF)  and control  arms, respectively. When the CF arm 
was stratified into optimal CF and non -optimal CF groups,  effectiveness was 75.9% vs 
58.1%, respectiv ely. There was no difference in the rate of  complications in the two groups. 
Cardiac tamponade occurred in one subject  in each group.  
The ThermoCool SmartTouch c atheter was evaluated in a multicenter, prospective, 
randomized clinical tria l performed for FD A approval[24]. The outcomes were compared with 
the Thermo Cool IDE trial[18], in which [ADDRESS_479786] s were enrolled. The 12 -month freedom 
from AF/AT/AFL in SMART -AF was 72.5% at 1 -year follow -up, compared with 66%

5.1. TRAC -AF Study Design  
Subjects with symptomatic PAF who were refractory or intolerant to at least 1 anti -
arrhythmic drug (AAD; class I -IV) were screened for enrollment. Subjects that met the study 
eligibility criteria and signed the informed consent form (ICF) were enrolled and treated in 
accordance with the protocol and the HRS/EHRA/ECAS Expert Consensus Statement on 
Catheter and Surgical Ablation of Atrial F ibrillation  [14, 26].  Subjects received ablation using 
the investigational device which required electrical isolation of all cli nical ly relevant 
pulmonary veins .

Long Term Interim Safety Analysis  
The chronic safety of the DiamondTemp System is assessed in TRAC -AF by [CONTACT_382914] [ADDRESS_479802] -In-Human study was to substantiate the safety and effectiveness of 
the DiamondTemp Ablation System use to ablate cardiac tissue in patients with paroxysmal 
atrial fibrillation. The study endpoints ach ieved the efficacy performance goal demonstrating 
100% effectiveness by [CONTACT_382915].  Freedom from AF [ADDRESS_479803] -procedure was 72.5%.  The safety profile 
demonstrated in this st udy indicates the DiamondTemp System can be used safely in cardiac 
ablation procedures in this patient population, with no incidences of acute serious adverse 
device -related events (SADEs) and a 2.9% to 4.3% safety endpoint rate through 7 and 30 
days, resp ectively.   
The safety results observed in these seventy (70) subjects treated with the DiamondTemp 
System up to 30 days  are well within the recommendations of the published literature and 
documented safety and efficacy rates of catheter ablation for PAF[26].

The DiamondTemp RF Generator  (Figure  3) is a temperature -controlled RF generator and 
provides power to the DiamondTemp Catheter at approximately 460 kHz.  It has a univ ersal 
AC power supply  and provides isolated communication port s to the DiamondTemp Irrigation 
Pump and serial output to an external monitor which can mirror  the RF Generator front panel 
information (Figure 3b) such as temperature, power and impedance curves resul ting during 
RF delivery . 
There are two generator models for use in this investigation: model CEDTG100 and 
model CEDTG200.  The DiamondTemp Generator model CEDTG100, upon initiation of 
RF energy and contact [CONTACT_382923], reaches the user -selected temperature set 
point in approximately five (5) seconds. The DiamondTemp Generator model 
CEDTG200, under the same conditions, reaches the user -selected temperature set point 
in approximately one (1) second.   All other control features, feedback and safety features 
are the same between the two models.  It is the discretion of the investigator to select 
which generator model is used.

8. STUDY PROTOCOL  AND METHODS  
8.1.  Study Objective  
The objective  of this study is to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the 
DiamondTemp Ablation System for the treatment of drug refractory, recurrent, symptomatic 
paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF).   The study will be considered successful if the 
investigative device is considered non-inferior to the control  device  for the primary safety 
and effectiveness  endpoints.  
8.2.  Study Design  
The DIAMOND -AF study is a prospective, single -blind, 1:[ADDRESS_479808] a  principal investigator (PI) 
that is responsible for t he conduct of a research study as well as sub -investigators .  It is 
anticipated that approximately  50% of the randomized subjects will be enro lled at centers 
within the [LOCATION_002].

After providing consent,  subjects will undergo  screening and baseline tests. Subjects that 
meet the eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to either treatment  with the 
investigational or control device only after completion of all screening and eligibility 
procedures. A randomization m odule within the E lectronic Data Capture (EDC)  system  will 
be used to randomize subjects 1:1 to one of two treatment groups using a blocke d 
randomization stratified by [CONTACT_382924] I/III or Class 
II/IV AADs .  Since full eligibility for the study  may not be confirmable until pre-ablation  
procedure tests are performed, subjects will only count towards the  enrol lment ceiling once 
final eligibility is confirmed and they are randomized.  Once randomized, a subject will be 
considered enrolled in the study.  
The primary focus of the left atrial ablation procedure is to create a series of  point -by-point 
RF lesions encircling the left and right PVs to achieve electrical PVI from the rest of the left 
atrium  (LA) . Investigators may use their p referred approach to obtain PVI,  such as antral or 
WACA  ablation targeting PVs segmentally or  PV pairs ipsilaterally.  PVI must be confirmed 
by [CONTACT_382893] [ADDRESS_479809] -ablation.    
Subjects will be given a cardiac event monitor ( Sentinel Wireless ECG Recorder System  or 
equivalent, HeartcoR Solutions, LLC.) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14587] -discharge visit to be used 
throughout the duration of the study. If subject  exhibits symptoms (e.g. palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], 
dizziness, tiredness, lightheadedn ess, shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, syncope) 
associated with AF  recurrence  at any time after the ablation procedure, they will be 
instructed to record their heart rhythm using their cardiac event monitor  and to contact [CONTACT_382925] .  This data will be transmitted to and read at an ECG core lab.   If a subject 
has an arrhythmia recurrence within  the first 90 days after the ablation procedure (blanking 
period), one repeat ablation procedure is allowed per protocol.  Investigators should mak e 
every attempt to schedule a repeat ablation procedure on or before day  90.  The repeat 
ablation procedure  must be performed with the assigned investigational or control catheter.  
Repeat ablation procedures performed with a catheter different than origin ally assigned will 
be a protocol deviation.   Subjects will also be required to perform bi -monthly periodic event 
recording from the [ADDRESS_479810] bl inding to treatment assignment, all subjects will be asked 
whether they think they were in the investigational group, control group or if they don’t 
know at the 12 -month follow -up visit.  
The duration of the study is projected to span approximately 36 month s.  The duration 
accounts for:

[CONTACT_382930] a primary 
effectiveness failure because it is not considered an iatrogenic arrhythmia f ollowing a left atrial 
ablation procedure for AF.  
8.6.  Sample Size Justification  
With a randomization ratio of 1:1 and an estimated attrition rate of 7%, 2 40 subjects per 
treatment group (total N=4 80) should yield sufficient  power for both the primary safety and 
primary effectiveness endpoints.    
For primary safety, assuming a control composite SAE rate of 6.5%, 226 subjects per group 
yields 80% power to detect a non -inferiority margin of 6.5% between treatment groups at a 
one-sided significance level of 0.0 25.  Similarly, assuming a control effectiveness rate of 
65%, 229 subjects per group yields 80% power to detect a non -inferiority margin of -12.5% 
between treatment groups at a significance level of 0.0 25. 
8.7.  Statistical  Analysis  
Before database lock, the final SAP for clinical data will be prepared to provide full details of 
all planned analyses. The analyses presented here represent an outline of the intended 
methodology.  
Analysis Populations  
The following  analysis populations are defined in this study:  
• ITT Population: The Intention -to-Treat (ITT) population will be comprised of all 
randomized subjects regardless of whether they receive study treatment, with 
analyses conducted according to the randomized tr eatment assignment .

• Per Protocol Analysis Set: The Per Protocol analysis set will be a subset of the ITT 
Set and comprised of all subjects who did not have any major protocol deviations.  
• Safety Analysis Population: In the unlikely case where a subject is r andomized but 
the procedure is prematurely halted and no catheter is deployed, said catheter will e 
included in the ITT Set but excluded from the Safety Set since the subject was not 
exposed to the study device.  The Safety Set will be comprised of all ran domized 
subject in which treatment was at least attempted (assigned treatment catheter 
inserted into vasculature), with analyses conducted by [CONTACT_147246].  
General Considerations  
Descriptive summary statistics for continuous variables will inc lude the number of 
subjects, mean, standard deviation  or standard error, median, minimum and maximum. 
Nominal categorical variables will be summarized using counts and percentages. Ordinal 
variables may be analyzed as if they were continuously scaled.  
The study will be considered successful when the primary safety and effectiveness 
endpoints are met.   
If primary effectiveness success is determined to be less than 52% for either the treatment 
arm or the control arm, the primary effectiveness endpoint will b e difficult to interpret, 
and additional analyses will be necessary to explain the poor device performance.   
Subject Disposition  
The number and percentage of subjects who complete and discontinue as well as reasons 
for early discontinuation will be present ed. 
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized descriptively. Treatment 
groups will be compared statistically to confirm that the randomization process generated 
two homogeneous  groups prior to treatment.  
Catheter Model Analysis  
The final study data will  include evaluations of the DiamondTemp Unidirectional and 
Bidirectional Catheters in aggregate as well as stratified by [CONTACT_382933].  
There will be a minimum of 30 subjects tre ated with the DiamondTemp Bidirectional 
Catheter.  
8.8.  Site Training  
Technical training with the DiamondTemp Ablation System will be provided by [CONTACT_1034].  
Training will be documented and will include a review of the investigational plan, study 
procedures, CRF completion, instructions for use  (IFU)  and all study compliance 
requirements.

The following classifications will be applied to all subjects:  
• Screening Failure:  A subject who has consented (signed ICF)  but is found to not meet 
eligibility criteria through medical file review and/or screening procedures  to confirm 
eligibility. Screening failures do not count against the maximum study en rollment 
ceiling and there are no follow -up requirements.  If screening failure occurs after 
randomization but prior to insertion of the assigned treatment catheter, the screening 
failure will be documented.  
• Intent -to-Treat : Includes all s ubjects who sign ICF , meet eligibility criteria  and are 
randomized into one of the  two study group s.  These subjects will count against the 
maximum study enrollment ceiling.  
• Treatment -Per-Protocol : A subject who is successfully treated per the study protocol  
with the  assigned randomized treatment  catheter . These subjects are followed in 
accordance with the follow -up schedule and  are included in all analyses of safety and 
effectiveness .   
The statistical analysis for each classification will be documented i n the Statis tical Analysis 
Plan (SAP) . 
10.3.  Subject Withdrawal  
All subjects enrolled in the clinical study  (including those withdrawn from the clinical study  
or lost to follow -up) will be accounted for and documented.   If a subject withdraws from the 
clinical study , the reason(s) will be documented.   Reasons for withdrawal may include 
physician discretion, subject choice to withdraw consent, loss to follow -up or death.  While 
study withdrawal is discouraged, subjects may withdraw from the study at any time, with or 
without reason, and without prejudic e to further treatment.   
All applicable case report forms up to the point of subject withdrawal must be completed.  
For subjects who are “lost -to-follow -up” the investigator/center should have at least three 
documented attempts to contact [CONTACT_382934] r to withdrawal from the study.    No 
additional data may be collected after a subject has been withdrawn from the study or 
withdraws his/her consent, for whatever reason.  All open adverse events should be closed or 
documented as chronic.  Data collected up to the point of subject withdrawal may be used.  
11.  STUDY METHODS  
11.1.  Enrollment and Visit Schedule  
Enrollment of subjects will occur at the clinical sites only after the appropriate local and 
national study approvals, “Approval to Enroll” documenta tion from the Sponsor and written

11.4.  Pre-Ablation Testing  and Requirements  
• Echocardiogram (TEE or TTE) must be performed prior to ablation in the following 
instances:  
o To confirm LA diameter and LVEF  
▪ if not available  within 180 days of the ablation procedure   
• Echocardiogram (TEE) must be performed within 48 hours of the  ablation procedure to 
rule out LA thrombus * in subjects that meet the following criteria:  
o Not currently and adequately anticoagulated for 3 weeks or longer  
▪ If subject is on an oral anticoagulant  (OAC ) they should be taking it 
regularly for 21 days prior to ablation  
▪ If a subject is on  warfarin prior to ablation , they should have a therapeutic 
International Normalized Ratio (INR) > 2  
o CHA 2DS 2-VASc score is ≥2  
o  LA diameter ≥4.6 cm 
*ICE may be considered to rule out LA thrombus in subjects contraindicated for TEE  
If a thrombus is observed on echo, the subject no longer meets eligibility criteria.  The 
subject can be anticoagulated for [ADDRESS_479832] will not meet eligibility for the study . 
• Discontinuation of  AADs prior to the procedure is left to the discretion and practice of 
the investigator and investigational site best practices.  AADs should be maintained at 
current failed dose.  
o Regular a miodarone use must be discontinued 2 months prior to the ablation 
procedure and not restarted after the ablation procedure.    
• Performance of the ablation procedure on uninterrupted  anti-coagula tion therapy (e .g. 
warfarin or OACs)  is strongly recommended . 
o For subject s anticoagulated with a OAC prior to AF catheter  ablation, it is 
reasonable to hold one to two doses of the OAC  prior to AF ablation with re -
initiation post -ablation . 
• Women of child bearing  potential will be required to verify entrance criteria prior to 
procedure by [CONTACT_382936] a negative pregnancy test conducted within [ADDRESS_479833] hospi[INVESTIGATOR_382861], at a minimum, include the 
following : 
1. Prep and sedat e subject per  institutional standard practice . 
a. Method  of sedation  will be recorded (i.e. conscious  sedation or general 
anest hesia) . 
b. Placement of an esophageal temperature probe to guide energy delivery on the 
posterior wall is strongly recommended .  
i. An esophageal temperature increase of 1  – 2 °C from baseline or a 
recorded temperature of 39  – 40 °C should trigger interruption of RF 
energy delivery.  Care should be taken to ensure that the esophageal 
temperature probe is aligned as close as possible with the position of the 
ablation catheter during ablation to avoid a false impression of safety.   
ii. Deviation of the esophag eal temperature probe  is allowed  if standard 
practice at the institution . 
c. Place Ensite  Velocity o r Precision patches on subject per IFU . 
d. Place commercially  available Dispersive Indifferent Electrode (DIP) patch .  
2. Gain vascular access per lab protocol via the femoral veins and /or right or  left internal 
jugular or subclavian veins by [CONTACT_382937] s.  
3. Any commercially available 8.5F, fixed or steerable , sheath may be used . 
a. A steerable sheath is recommended to be used with the DiamondTemp Ablation 
Catheter . 
4. Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_382862] . 
a. Sheaths (fixed or steerable)  should be continuously infus ed with heparinized 
saline at 1-2ml/min throughout the procedure . 
5. Complete a single or double transsept al puncture to access the LA . 
6. A heparin  loading dose should be administered just prior to transseptal puncture 
(recommended) or immediately following .  A standard heparin infusion  through 
catheter and sheaths should be given to maintain anticoagulation and  activated clotting

multielectrode catheter using Ensite  Velocity or  Precision system.  
a. RF applications and location will be added to the map during the procedure . 
9. A pre -ablation EGM/[ADDRESS_479837]’s rhythm at the beginning  
of the procedure will be collected . 
10. All peri-procedural AEs must be  recorded on the AE CRF  and reported to the Sponsor.  
All device issues, malfunction or deficiencies with the investigational or control 
devic es must  be reported on the Device Deficiency  CRF .  The use of a replacement

When using the DiamondTemp  Catheter, the change in the high-resolution  EGM will be used 
to guide the termination of the RF delivery .  After EGM amplitude attenuation is reached, RF 
delivery is to be stopped three (3) to five (5) seconds after EGM amplitude  attenuation is 
reached.  The point of significant EGM attenuation is defined as the time when there are no 
more changes in the EGM amplitude  and/or there is a 7 5 to 80% reduction in EGM 
amplitude . 
Investigators are recommended  to not ablate for greater th an 45 seconds  without moving th e 
tip of the investigational ablation catheter.  
In the event of a generator cutoff (impedance, temperature) or if a steam pop is observed, the 
catheter must be withdrawn and the tip electrode observed for the presence of cha r or 
coagulum formation. The tip should be cleaned, if necessary, before RF current is reapplied.  
Purge the catheter prior to insertion into the subject . 
Pulmonary Vein Electrica l Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_382864] a ctivity of the PVs  must be mapped prior to ablation.  The investigator may 
determine the order in which the PVs are mapped and if PV angiography is necessary to 
facilitate vein access.

Index Ablation Procedure  
The primary focus of the ablation procedure will be to create a series of point -by-point RF 
lesions encircling the left and right PVs to achieve PVI (electrical isolation of PVs from the 
LA).  
Investigators may use their preferred approach to obtain PVI su ch as antral or WACA  
targeting PVs segmentally or PV pairs ipsilaterally.  A circumferential approach applying RF 
application 1 -2 cm outside of the PV ostium to prevent PV stenosis is recommended.  
Targeting non -PV foci and complex fractionated electrogram s is not recommended in this 
investigation.  If the investigator identifies additional focal or macro -reentrant atrial sites to 
be clinically relevant to AF and requires ablation, the ablation location will be documented.  
The order in which PVs are isolate d is up to the investigator’s discretion.  While isolating the 
right superior PV, high -voltage pacing may be used before each RF applicatio n to check for 
phrenic nerve  stimulation.  Ablation should be avoided in areas of phrenic nerve capture as to 
not cau se injury to the phrenic nerve.  While ablating on the posterior wall in proximity to the 
esophagus it is highly recommended that investigators use an esophageal temperature probe 
during RF ablation procedures to monitor esophageal temperature and help gui de energy 
delivery.   An esophageal temperature increase of 1 -2°C from baseline or a recorded 
temperature of 39°C –40°C should trigger interruption of RF energy delivery[26]. Care should 
be taken to ensure that the esophageal temperature probe is aligned as close as possible with 
the position of the ablation catheter during ablation to avoid a false impression of safety. 
Additionally, e ach ablation on the posterior LA wall nee ds to consider  the duration, power 
and temperature (investigational catheter only) settings while in proximity to other structures 
that could potentially be injured, such as the esophagus.  Moving a catheter after shorter 
durations of RF application , reduc ing the power (W) and/or temperature set point to 50 or 55  
oC (investigational system only)  is encouraged but is left to the discretion of the investigator.  
Procedural recommendations  
• PVI must be confirmed and documented by [CONTACT_382940] a minimum of [ADDRESS_479838] RF application in each PV or PV 
pair to monitor for PV reconnection.  
• Adenosine and/or isoproterenol may be administered [ADDRESS_479839] for the presence of dormant PV conduction.  
o Admi nistration of isoproterenol for the sole purpose to identify non -PV 
triggers is allowed but not recommended.  
• Exit block testing is not required, but if performed, exit block must be 
demonstrated for the PVI to be considered successful. If conduction resum es in 
any of the PVs, additional RF application can be applied until PVI is achieved. If 
additional ablation is performed following reconnection of PV, PVI must be 
reconfirmed at a minimum of [ADDRESS_479840] ablation in the respective 
PV or PV pa ir. 
• Empi[INVESTIGATOR_382867], rotors, ganglionated plexi 
or performing left atrial mitral isthmus or roof lines are not recommended.

• Spontaneously -occurring atrial arrhythmias that present during the procedure are 
allowed to b e ablated at the investigator’s discretion.  
o CTI-dependent (typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]) flutter is also allowed  if the subject has a known 
history of typi[INVESTIGATOR_382868].  
• Cardioversions do not signify procedural failures and are not adverse events. A 
post-ablation EGM/[ADDRESS_479841]’s rhythm at the end of 
the procedure will be  collected.  
All procedure logistical data, ablation parameters, procedural outcomes, adverse events, 
fluids administered from both catheter and non -catheter sources  (i.e., steerable sheath, etc.)  
and medications administered will be recorded and reported throughout the procedure. 
Prophylactic administration of intravenous diuretics during or after the procedure is allowed 
and will not be considered an adverse event.  All ablation catheters must be removed from 
the subject and inspected for char and coagulum formation if there is a generator cutoff 
(impedance or temperature) as well as each time a steam pop is observed.   
Ablation data collected during the procedure wi ll include but may not be limited to:  
• Catheter lot/serial number(s) used   
• Temperature set point  
• Power set point  
• Total number of RF applications for PVI 
• Total number of RF applications during the procedure  
• Total RF time during the procedure  
• ACT  levels and t imes taken  
• Location of additional ablations performed and number of RF applications per 
location  
• Total fluid infused from the ablation catheter  
• Presence of char or coagulum formation and incidence(s) of steam pops  
• Procedure and fluoroscopy times  
• EP record ing system gain and filter settings for the ablation distal recording channel 
and manufacturer  
If at any time during the ablation  procedure the investigator is unable to continue the ablation 
with the investigational  or control  catheter (other than when ab lating an RA flutter line), the 
investigator may consider the case a procedural failure and complete the case with a device 
determined best for the subject.  The point at which failure was determined as well as the 
rationale must be documented.  
After remov al from the subject, the investigation al or control catheter  should be inspected, 
and if any abnormalities such as char or coagulum formation are noted on the catheter, it 
must be documented.  All adverse experiences with the investigational device  during the 
ablation procedure must be promptly reported to the Sponsor and documented on the CRF.

o If there has been an early recurrence of AF, investigator should schedule a visit 
so he/she can evaluate subject to determine if  a repeat ablation procedure can 
be scheduled before the end of the 90-day blanking period.  
11.9      Repeat Ablation Procedure (if applicable)  
It is expected that some subjects will have early recurrences of  atrial arrhythmias  (e.g. AF, 
AT, AFL)  within the blanking period ( 90 days  following the ablation procedure)[18].  
Investigators may perform one repeat ablation procedure in su bjects with  highly symptomatic 
or multiple early recurrences of atrial arrhythmias that cannot be controlled with 
antiarrhythmic therapy [26, 28]. Subjects with documented early recurrence during the blanking 
period are not being considered a primary eff ectiveness failure.

the event. A procedure -related adverse event that impacts or potentially impacts a primary 
and/or secondary safety endpoint will be reviewed and adjudicated by [CONTACT_382946] . 
12.8.   Device Deficiency  Reporting   
A device deficiency is  defined as  any inadequacy of a medical device  with respect to its 
identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety or performance. Device deficiencies include 
malfunctions, misuse or use errors and inadequate labeling.  
Device deficiencies related to the investigational a blation system s may occur i n the absence 
of any associated AE  and must be completely documented on a CRF .  
Device deficiencies related to the DiamondTemp Ablation System and associated accessories 
should be reported to the Sponsor within two ( 2) business days and returned to the spo nsor 
for analysis  as expeditiously as possible . Instructions for returning the clinical device(s) will 
be provided  to investigational sites by [CONTACT_1034] . If it is not possible to return the device, 
the investigator should document why the device was not returned and the final disposition of 
the device. Device failures and malfunctions should also be documented in the subject’s 
medical record.  If a device deficiency is associated with an AE that specific event would be 
recorded as an AE.  
Device deficiencie s related to the control system will be handled per the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_382879].  
Note: Any Device Deficiency that might have led to an SAE if a) suitable action had not been 
taken or b) intervention had not been made or c) if circum stances had been less fortunate is 
considered reportable and should be notified to EPIX . 
12.9.  Protocol Deviations  
The Investigator is not allow ed to deviate from the protocol without prior approval by 
[CONTACT_382947]/EC .   
Under emergency circumstances, deviations from the clinical investigation plan to protect the 
rights, safety and well -being of human subjects may proceed without prior approval of the 
sponsor and the IRB/EC . 
Reports of any deviation from the clinical investigational plan as per above emergency 
circumstances will be reported to the Sponsor and to the IRB/EC  as soon as possible after 
detection, but no later than twenty -four (24) hours from  the time of the deviation.  
Deviations must be documented on the appropriate protocol deviation  CRF . 
Any report of withdrawal of IRB/EC  approval will be submitted to the Sponsor within five 
(5) working days.  
If a Clinical Monitor becomes aware that an Inve stigator is not complying with the signed 
Investigator’s Agreement, the Investigational Plan, the requirements of ISO [ZIP_CODE] or other 
applicable regulations, or any conditions of approval imposed by [CONTACT_3488]/EC  
Committee, Sponsor  will immediately e ither secure compliance or discontinue shipments of 
the device to the Investigator and terminate the Investigator’s participation in the

13.2.  Risk Minimization  
A comprehensive functional risk analysis was performed to quantify the risks associated with 
the use of the DiamondTemp Ablation System. This functional risk analysis evaluated the 
potential interfaces of the DiamondTemp Ablation System with t he subject  and/or user and 
listed the potential harms and potential causes.  The associated probability of each cause was 
estimated and risk control measures were considered and implemented to further reduce the 
potential for all risks.

Confidential                                                                                                                Page [ADDRESS_479861] surgical risks for example: infection, electrical shock, perfora tion, tamponade, skin 
burns and complications associated with use of ancillary devices, drugs, and anesthetic.   The 
DiamondTemp Ablation System does not create new risks nor does it increase procedural 
risks as compared with other ablation systems for elec trophysiology procedures. The risks 
associated with the use of the DiamondTemp Ablation System have been identified and 
evaluated, controls have been put in place to adequately mitigate risks, and a system is 
implemented that monitors the effectiveness of the risk controls and provides a process to 
implement corrective and preventive actions  
The DiamondTemp  Ablation  System is similar in design to existing commercial ablation 
systems and intends to provide an equivalent functionality to existing irrigated 
electrophysiology ablation catheter /system s on the market.  Additionally , technology 
integrated within the catheter allows to measure interface tissue temperature and the RF 
generator can be set to automatically adjust the power to achieve a desired interfac e tissue 
temperature. The DiamondTem p Ablation System does no t introduce any new or additional 
safety risks beyond those associated with similar cardiovascular and ablation procedures. 
Further, the system is also capable of assessing the extent of contact [CONTACT_382950]. This 
study is intended to evaluate the safety and performance effectiveness of the DiamondTemp 
Ablation System for the treatment of atrial arrhy thmias.  
Risks  associated with the DIAMOND -AF Study can be minimized through appropriate 
training  of Investigators and research staff , compliance to this protocol , adherence to 
inclusion / exclusion criteria and by [CONTACT_382951].   
Additionally, extensive in vitro  bench and in vivo  animal studies have been successfully 
performed with the DiamondTemp  Ablation  System. V erification and lot  release testing for 
all components of the system  will be completed. The associated risks proposed in this study  
are similar to  risks posed by [CONTACT_382952], electrophysiological cardiac procedures.  
Based upon the risk analysis conducted to assess the DiamondTemp Ablation System, EPIX 
has determined that the benefits of the device can outweigh the risks if used in the 
appropriate patient population by a physician  trained in the use of electrophysiology 
procedures .  As a primary treatment for cardiac arrhythmias, the DiamondTemp Ablation 
System is deter mined to be safe for human use.  
13.3.  Benefits  
Participants in this rese arch study may or may not receive benefits from participation in this 
study as compared to standard of care treatment of PAF.

AF eliminated or AF burden  reduced  resulting in a bett er quality of life and  reduced need  for 
medication.   
Additionally, there may be a  benefit to the subjects enrolled in this study through improved 
therapy delivery.  The DiamondTemp system was designed to  provide investigators with 
additional information  to a) monitor real -time tissue interface temperatures b) automatically 
adjust output power to a temperature set point based on the composite temperature c) utilize a 
low irrigation flow rate for all power output up to [ADDRESS_479863] data as collected on CRFs or via an EDC 
system. The monitor will ensure that the clinical protocol has been approved by [CONTACT_1201]/EC 
and will assure ongoing compliance with clinical pro tocol.   
The Investigator/institution guarantees direct access to original source documents by [CONTACT_144305], their designees, and appropriate regulatory authorities.  
14.2.  Monitoring Procedures  
Monitoring visits to the clinical sites will be made per iodically to ensure  that Investigators

Long Standing 
Persistent AF  Long -standing persistent AF is defined as continuous AF of 
greater than 12 months duration.  
Myocardial 
infarction  MI as it relates to AF ablation resulting in the presence of any 
one of the following criteria:  
• ECG changes indicative of new ischemia that persist for > 1 
hour 
• development of new pathological Q waves on an ECG  
• imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new 
regional wall motion abnormality  
Paroxysmal Atrial 
Fibrillation (PAF)  Recurrent atrial fibrillation that last ≥ 30 seconds and terminates 
spontaneously within 7 days.  
Pericardial effusion  Accumulation of blood between heart and lining of the heart 
(pericardium).  It is not uncommon to observe “trace” pericardial 
effusion f ollowing AF ablation.  Trace effusion that does not 
need intervention is not considered a serious AE.  
Persistent Atrial 
Fibrillation   Recurrent atrial fibrillation that lasts ≥ [ADDRESS_479871] discomfort with or without pericardial rub and 
ECG changes and did not require additional hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
Generally, not an SAE.  
Serious Pericarditis  Pericarditis resulting in an effusion that leads to hemodynamic 
compromise, requires pericardiocentesis, prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
> 48 hours or persists for more than 30 days following procedure.  
Source Data  Original records (or certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) of clinical findings, 
information, observations, or other activities in an investigation 
necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the clinical 
study.  
Source Document  Printed or electronic document containing source data like 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332] / records, lab notes, device accountability records, 
radiographs, signed procedural worksheets, records kept at the 
investigation site, and at the laboratories involved in the clinical 
study.  
Phrenic nerve 
paralysis  Absence of phrenic nerve function assessed by a sniff test that 
persists > 7 days.  A phrenic nerve paralysis is considered to be 
permanent when it is documented to be present ≥ 12 months 
following ablation.  
Pulmonary edema  Pulmonary alveolar fluid accumu lation accompanied by [CONTACT_11017][INVESTIGATOR_382853] (dyspnea), physical findings (rales, hypoxemia),

meet e ligibility criteria through medical file review and/or 
screening procedures to confirm eligibility.  
Steam pop  Excessive tissue temperatures over ~100°C that may result in an 
audible pop.  The pop is a sudden release or explosion due to the 
vaporization of  interstitial fluid in myocardium. This may 
produce biotraumas and tissue disruption that is usually clinically 
benign but may cause rupture of thin -walled structures with 
subsequent pericardial tamponade, usually requiring emergency 
pericardiocentesis, an d/or surgical repair.  
Stroke post -ablation  Rapid onset of a focal or global neurological deficit with at least 
one of the following: change in level of consciousness, 
hemiplegia, hemiparesis, numbness or sensory loss affecting one 
side of the body, dysph asia or aphasia, hemianopia, amaurosis 
fugax that persists for >[ADDRESS_479873] and subsequent neuroimaging procedure (MRI or CT 
scan or cerebral angiography).  
Symptomatic AF, 
AT or AFL  Symptoms associated with AF , AT or AFL  that were experienced 
by [CONTACT_423], made them seek medical attention, and were 
concurrent with a documented epi[INVESTIGATOR_382885], event monitor 
and/or Holter monitor. Symptoms may have included 
palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], irregular pulse (i.e. rapid, racing, pounding , 
fluttering, bradycardic), dizziness, weakness, chest discomfort, 
and breathlessness.  
Thromboembolism  Occurrence of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism post 
ablation  
Thrombus  An aggregation of blood factors, primarily platelets and fibrin 
with entrapment of cellular elements, frequently causing vascular 
obstruction at the point of its formation.  
Transient ischemic 
attack (TIA) post -
ablation  Rapid onset of new focal neurological deficit with immediate 
symptom resolution (usually 1 to 2 hours), always within [ADDRESS_479874] and neuroimaging 
without tissue injury.  
Vagal nerve injury  Esophageal dysmotility or gastroparesis requiring or p rolonging 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_382855] a hematoma, an AV fistula or a 
pseudoaneurysm that requires intervention, such as surgical repair 
or transfusion, prolongs the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] s tay, or requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15517].

Vasospasm  Sudden narrowing of artery that usually relaxes with medication 
or by [CONTACT_382965] a short period of time (minutes).  
Wide Area 
Circumferential 
Ablation (WACA)  The location of PVI has moved more proximally, from the PV 
ostium to the antral insertion of the PV, several centimeters 
proximal to the PV ostium. This is called “wide area 
circumferential ablation” or WACA, and is also known as PV 
antral isolation.  Tech nique has several advantages: 1) decreases 
risk of PV stenosis 2) eliminates proximal antral AF triggers 3) 
modification of nerve bundles that innervate the atria and 
contribute to AF maintenance may also be ablated.

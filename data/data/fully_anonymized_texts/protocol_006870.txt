 Study Title  
Vitamin D and Vascular Function in Obese Children  
Objectives  
The primary objective of this randomized clinical trial is to determine  the efficacy of enhanced 
vitamin D 3 supplementation in improving vascular endothelial function, arterial stiffness, insulin 
sensitivity, and metabolic syndrome risk status  in 10- to 18 -year -old vitamin D -deficient (serum 
25-hydroxyvitamin D <20 ng/mL) obese or overweight  (BMI ≥85th percentile) children; and to 
assess whether these effects are dose -dependent. As a secondary objective, we will examine 
the vitamin D supplementation -induced effe ct on adipokines and inflammatory markers 
relevant to CVD risk.  
Design and Outcomes  
In a double -blinded, controlled trial, we propose to randomize 229 eligible children to receive 
either 600 IU (conventional supplementation , current recommended dietary all owance ), or 
1000 IU or 2000 IU (enhanced supplementation) of vitamin D 3 daily for six months.  
The p rimary outcome measure will be change in brachial flow -mediated dilation percentage at 
6 months (FMD %); FMD% is a measure of vascular endothelial function. The s econdary 
outcome measures  will include (1) pulse -wave velocity (PWV ) – a measure of arterial stiffness, 
(2) central and systemic blood pressure, (3) fasting blood glucose concentration, (4) 1 /fasting 
insulin  concentration a s a surrogate for insulin re sistivity , (5) lipid profile indices, (6) 
adipocytokines (plasma leptin, and adiponectin) and systemic markers of inflammation (plasma 
high -sensitivity CRP, IL -6, TNF -α). 
Eligible participants will be scheduled for enrollment within eight weeks of the init ial screening 
visit. Follow -up visit s will occur approximately at three  months and six months after  enrollment . 
FMD %, PWV , biochemical measurements, and inflammatory markers will be obtained at each 
study visit; DXA scan will be done at  enrollment  and at 6 months . 
Interventions and Duration  
Enrolled c hildren will  receive daily oral supplementation of  either 600 IU  or 1000 IU or 2000 IU 
of vitamin D 3 for six months.  
Sample Size and Population  
We aim to enroll  229 otherwise  healthy 10- to 18-year -old, overweight  (BMI percentile , ≥85th to 
<95th) or obese ( BMI percentile, ≥95th), vitamin D -deficient (serum 25(OH)D concentration <20 
ng/mL ) children.

 1. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
1.1 Primary Objective  
To determine whether enhanced vitamin D 3 supplementation in 10 - to 18 -year -old obese and 
overweight children with serum 25(OH)D <20 ng/mL results in: (a) improved vascular health 
(arterial  endothelial function and arterial stiffness) and (b) improved insulin sensitivity and 
metabolic syndrome ma rkers  (blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, lipid profile) . We 
hypothesize that vitamin D 3 supplementation with 2000 IU or 1000 IU daily will be more 
effective than 600 IU in improving vascular health and insulin sensitivity and metabolic 
syndrome marker s. 
1.2 Secondary Objectives  
To examine whether down regulation of systemic inflammatory m arkers  and adipokines 
underlie the effects of vitamin D on vasculature and metabolism . We hypothesize that vitamin 
D effects on vascular health and metabolism may be driven  by [CONTACT_422647] -
associated inflammation.  
2. BACKGROUND AND RATIO NALE  
2.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus  
Childhood obesity is a major public health problem in the [LOCATION_002] (US). In 2007 -2008, 32% 
of 2- to 19 -year-old US children were either obese (BMI ≥95th percentile) or overweight (BMI 
85th - 94th percentile) .1 Obese and overweight children exhibit cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk 
factors2 and have a high risk of metabolic syn drome3 (i.e. large waist circumference, 
hypertension, fasting hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and low levels of high -density 
lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol). Obesity and its atherogenic risks track from childhood to 
adulthood, increasing the risk of adult CVD and pointing to t he need for developi[INVESTIGATOR_422633].

risk of vitamin D deficiency; hypovitaminosis D is also associated with other CVD risk factors, 
such as low HDL cholesterol and lower insulin sensitivity in youth.10,[ADDRESS_533716] the central hypothesis  that enhancement of vitamin D status 
in otherwise healthy obese and overweight vitamin D -deficient children will improve their 
vascular health and their CVD and metabolic syndrome risk profil e.

 3. STUDY DESIGN  
We propose a double -masked, randomized, controlled clinical trial of enhanced vitamin D 3 
supplementation (600 IU vs 1000 IU vs 2000 IU) for six months in 10 - to 18 -year -old, overweight 
(BMI percentile , ≥85th to <95th) or obese (BMI  percentile , ≥95th), vitamin D -deficient ( serum 
25(OH)D concentration <20 ng/mL)  children. Children who seek care at the Primary Care 
Centers of CHP (Oakland, Mercy Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and Turtle Creek) or at affiliated Pi[INVESTIGATOR_422634] 
(Practice Based Research Network, PBRN) will be eligible to participate. Our primary aim is to 
determine whether enhanced  supplementation with vitamin D 3 (1000 IU or 2000 IU) compared 
to the standard of care  vitamin D 3 supplementation (600 IU), taken orally once daily, is effective 
in improving brachial FMD % by 25% or more at the end of six months. Secondary outcomes will 
determine effects of vitamin D supplementation in reducing arterial stiffness, improving insulin 
sensitivity, and reducing metabolic syndrome risks. We will also characterize the mechanistic 
effects of vitamin D on systemic inflammatory markers and adipokine s relevant to CVD risk.

 occur a pproximately three months after the ir enrollment  visit, and their final study visit will be 
scheduled approximately three months thereafter.  
Screening Evaluation  
Consenting Procedure  
Written informed c onsent will be obtaine d separately for screening and for enrollment, at 
the respective study visits . The parent or medical legal guardian of the child ( as defined by 
[CONTACT_422651]) will be given a copy of the informed consent and will be provided an opportunity 
to read the consent in its entirety. F or a legal guardian to consent on behalf of  a child to 
participate in research, the guardian must present a copy of the appropriate legal document  
proving guardianship under state law  before  signing the consent document. A copy of the 
guardianship document will be included in the research subject’s chart.  
The consent form given at the screening visit will describe the procedures that will  take 
place only during the screening visit. The consent form given at the enrollment  visit will 
detail all procedures to be performed at each study visit. Participants must give their assent 
and only biological parents, or legally -recognized guardians , may provide consent.  
Only trained study coordinators and the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_422637] . Person obtaining consent  will review all aspects of the consent and allow 
the parent or legal guardian the opportunity to ask questions. The following points will be 
explained to the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) at the time of consent:  
• The study involves research  
• The purpose, b ackground and rationale of the study  
• Study involves taking vitamin D supplementation (Vitamin D 3 600 IU vs. 1000 IU vs. 2000 
IU once daily for six months) which has been  mask ed and random ly assign ed 
• The responsibility of the parent and the participant  
• All reasonably foreseeable risks or inconveniences associated with all the expected 
study procedures (i.e. vascular function tests, D XA scan, blood draw, skin color 
estimation, completion of physical activity, diet and sun exposure surveys)  
• Potential risk of h ypervitaminosis D (vitamin D poisoning) and its symptoms  
• The expected benefits of the study

 consent, a copy of an unsigned consent  form will be given to the parent(s) or legal 
guardian(s) for their records. The original signed copy of the consent will be kept within the 
study folder . 
 
Screening  
The following procedures are performed to determine a subject’s eligibility:  
• Age Calculati on: To enter the study children should have completed their 10th birthday and 
not have had their 19th birthday.  18-year-old children are eligible to enroll  until the day 
before their 19th birthday.  
• BMI Calculation : Height will be measured three times in centimeter (cm) to the nearest 
0.1-cm and averaged to determine the participant’s height in centimeter. Weight will be 
measured three times in kilogram (kg) to the nearest 0.1 -kg and averaged to determine 
the participant’s weight in kilogram. BMI will be c alculated using the following formula:  
[Weight in k ilogram ]/[Height in meter]2 
BMI can also be calculated using metric measurements of height (in cm) and weight (in 
kg) through NHLBI online BMI calculator available at: 
http://nhlbisupport.com/bmi/bminojs.htm  
• Medical History Form : Captures  anthropometrics,  demographic data (age, sex, race, and 
ethnicity), level of education, smoking status , current medications, and type of medical 
insurance.  
• Contact [CONTACT_23094]: To be completed by [CONTACT_422652] 18 years of age  
• Vitamin D and Su nlight Exposure Questionnaire: To be completed by [CONTACT_422653] 18 years of age  
• Waist Circumference Measurement: Waist circumference will be m easured three times, 
using a non-stretch tape measure , at the mid -point between the lowest rib and the iliac 
crest at minimal respi[INVESTIGATOR_422638]. The respective w aist circumference 
measurements will be measured to the nearest 0.1 cm and averaged.  
• Fitzpatrick Sun -reactive Skin Type estimation:  Sun-reactive skin type estimate will be 
made by [CONTACT_422654] 18 years of age  
• DSM II Colormeter Measurement: Study staff will normalize the 
dermatophotospectrometer on the calibration plate and obtain three readings from the 
forehead, b ack of the hand, and inner upper arm. The measurements obtained at each 
site will be averaged to estimate the melanin index at the respective sites.  
• Venipuncture, Specimen Collection, and Specimen Processing : 
o Venipuncture: Venipuncture s at the Primary Care  Center will be done by [CONTACT_422655] -trained medical assistants. For subjects consenting for 
screening at the Pediatric Pi[INVESTIGATOR_422639], venipuncture will be performed by [CONTACT_422656][INVESTIGATOR_422640] e, the clinic nurse , or the phlebotomy -trained medical 
assistants  
        Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]  
10 
 o Specimen Collection:  At least 5 mL of blood needs to be drawn in one or two  red-top 
tubes and 10 mL of blood in one or two green -top tubes  
o Specimen Processing: Label the specimens with screening ID, date of birth, and date 
of vi sit. Complete lab test order forms (instructions for lab procedures). Enclose the 
collected tubes in a medical -biohazard seal bag with the lab order/procedure 
instruction sheets and drop -off the specimens at the appropriate place in the UPMC 
Central Lab bu ilding or in the clinic for transportation of the samples to the Clinical 
Chemistry Lab at UPMC Presby[CONTACT_194840].  
Enrollment  
Enrollment  
Participants that are deemed vitamin D deficient (serum 25(OH)D concentration <20 ng/ mL) 
and meet all other inclusionary criteria are eligible to enroll in the study . Prior to entering 
the study (initiation of baseline assessments and randomization), participants will be  
required to complete a second informed consent, which outlines the assessments that will 
take place at the three study visits.  
Baseline Assessments  at enrollment  
Patients who have been successfully screened for the study and have enrolled will undergo 
the following baseline assessments:  
• Medical history form

 o Endothelial function. Brachial artery diameter will be measured using a high -
resolution ultrasound machine (GE, Vivid 7, GE Health care, Milwaukee, WI) 
equipped with a 9 -L linear transducer preset to a dedicated vascular scanning 
protocol. We will then occlude  brachial arterial flow at the upper forearm using a 5 -
cm-wide occlusive cuff (Hokanson SC5) inflated to a pressur e of 50 mmHg above the 
systolic blood pressure or to 200 mmHg, whichever is greater, by a rapid release 
sphygmomanometer (Hokanson DS 400) for [ADDRESS_533721] -cuff release diameter 
measurements during the reactive hyperemic phase, obtained at 60, 120, and 180 
seconds, will be used to calculate FMD%.  
o Arterial Stiffness Indices . Carotid -femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), Aortic 
Augmentation Index at heart rate of 75/min (AIx -75), and central systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure were measured using arterial tonometry (SphygmoCor 
CVMS V9, CPVH System, Model EM3, AtCor Medical, Sydney, Australia).  
• DXA  scan: Measures total body adiposity and percent of body fat  
Participants should enroll within two months of initial screening. If participants do not 
enroll within this time window, they will be required to rescreen to ensure eligibility.  
Subjects that have successfully completed the enrollment process and baseline procedures 
will be randomized to a study intervention dosage, which is blind ed to both st udy team and 
participant.  
Parents will be instructed to record each dose of intervention  given to their child in a 
calendar  supplied by [CONTACT_473].

7. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
7.1 Specification of Safety Parameter  
• Serum calcium levels will be monitored for participant safety. Serum calcium >10.8 
mg/dL in 10 - to 14 -year -old children and >10.2 mg/dL in ≥[ADDRESS_533722] serum 25(OH)D measured to rule out 
vitamin D toxicity (levels ≥100 ng/mL) and will be referred to a pediatric endocrinologist 
for further evaluation and management. Children with hypercalcemia and normal serum 
25(OH)D levels (<100 ng/mL) will be also be referred for further evaluation to their 
primary care provider and a pediatric endocrinologist to rule out other unusual causes 
of hypercalcemia (chronic granulomatous disorders, primary hyperparathyroidism, 
familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia).  
• Significant fasting hyperglycemia (fasting blood glucose >125 mg/dL) during enrollment 
visit will disqualify subject from enrolling in the  study.  
• Post -menarchial girls that test positive during pregnancy screen at the enrollment visit 
will be excluded. Positive screens in the final visit will disqualify subject from getting a 
DXA scan but will not exclude subject from completing the study.  
• At the [ADDRESS_533723] 
elevated serum calcium (>10.8 mg/dL in 10 - to 14 -year -old children and >10.2 mg/dL in ≥15 -
year -old children) will be further managed as stated above in section 7.1.

 7.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
An adverse event is any unintended medical occurrence (symptom, diagnosis, sign, abnormal 
laboratory finding , or missed study procedure ) that occurs during the study that was  not 
present at baseline.  
• Any medical condition present at the time of enrollment is considered baseline, and not 
reported as an adverse event.  
• If the severity of a pre -existing medical condition worsens at any time during the study 
participation, it will be considered an adverse event . 
• All adverse events will be assessed by [CONTACT_422658] (mild, moderate, severe, life -threatening) and whether the event is 
related to the study product or study intervention  
• All AEs will be recorded in the eCRF  in the study database . The event description,  date of 
onset and study clinician’s assessment of severity and relationship to study product, 
date of resolution and outcome will be recorded. To elicit any adverse event, the parent 
will be prompted at each encounter to report any change in their child s ince the last 
contact.  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any unintended medical occurrence in which the patient 
outcome is death  or life-threatening hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], disability, or incapacity.  
• In the event of an SAE, t he SAE eCRF  must be completed by [CONTACT_422659] (D r. Rajakumar ) 
immediately . The event description, date of onset and study clinician’s assessment of 
severity and relationship to study product, and outcome of event will be recorded.  
• SAEs will be logged in the electronic database and will be periodically monitored by  [CONTACT_26063].  
7.4 Reporting Procedures  
• All AEs will be reported to the  Data and Safety Monitoring Board annually . 
• Unanticipated protocol -related problems will be notified by [CONTACT_978] ([CONTACT_422670]) to 
the IRB as and when they occur  
• All SAEs must be reported by [CONTACT_422660]. Rajakumar, the study principal 
investigator, immediately.  Principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_422641] (IRB) according to the local IRB requirements.  
SAEs related to the research intervention will be notified by [CONTACT_978] ([CONTACT_422670]) to 
the IRB within 24 hrs. AEs of moderate severity related to the  research intervention will 
be notified by [CONTACT_978] ([CONTACT_422670]) to the IRB within 5 days.  
7.5 Follow -up for Adverse Events  
• Follow -up of a n on-serious adverse event of mild or moderate severity will end when 
the study reporting period ends [i.e., 6 -month follow -up visit (final study visit )]. Study 
staff will keep apprised of subject’s adverse event until the parent/subject provides a 
date of resolution for the AE; resolution date  will be documented in the CRHC database.  
        Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]

 • Follow -up for a non-serious adverse event of severe nature will be the following:  
o At the time of the event, the investigator will provide appropriate treatment or 
follow  up, including communicating the event to the  child’s primary care provider 
and/or providing a referral to a specialist.  
o The staff will place a follow  up phone call to the parent, regardless of the study 
reporting period, to assure that the child is improving or that the family has 
connected with the  suggested referral.  Study staff will keep apprised of subject’s 
adverse event until the parent/subject provides a date of resolution for the AE; 
resolution date will be documented in the CRHC database.  
7.6 Safety Monitoring  
• Members of the Data  and Safety Moni toring Board will evaluate participants’ risks 
(adverse events) vs. the benefits and other factors that can affect study outcome.  
• Real -time reports of SAEs will be sent to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board as 
determined by [CONTACT_458].  
• We will appoint an Independent Safety Monitor (ISM) who will have expertise in 
pediatrics and whose primary responsibility will be to provide timely safety monitoring, 
to ensure good clinical practice and to quickly identify safety concerns. Safety reports b y 
the ISM will be submitted on a regular basis, (e.g., real time, weekly, monthly, quarterly ) 
as determined by [CONTACT_4318] . To minimize bias, the ISM will evaluate SAEs masked to 
treatment assignment, unless the DSMB approves partial or complete unmasking. The 
ISM will participate for the duration of the study.  
• The ISM will be able to readily access participant records. The primary focus of the ISM 
is to independently review SAEs that may be associated with study treatment as well as 
adverse event s of special interest. The ISM will investigate any events considered 
serious and unexpected. The ISM will be in communication with [CONTACT_422670]  and the 
DSMB chair for any event that needs further evaluation. The ISM will not be directly 
involved in the t rial, will not be under the investigator ’s supervision, and will have no 
financial, intellectual, proprietary or professional interest in the outcome of the trial.  
8. INTERVENTION DISCONT INUATION  
To ensure children’s safety, we will use a serum calcium cutoff of >10.8 mg/dL in 10 - to 14 -year -
old children and >10.2 mg/dL in ≥[ADDRESS_533724] serum 25(OH)D measured to 
rule out vitamin D toxicity (levels ≥100 ng/mL) and will  be evaluated by a pediatric 
endocrinologist. Children with hypercalcemia and normal serum 25(OH)D levels (<100 ng/mL) 
will be referred for further evaluation to their primary care provider and a pediatric 
endocrinologist to rule out other unusual causes o f hypercalcemia (chronic granulomatous 
disorders, primary hyperparathyroidism, familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia).

 9. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
9.1 General Design Issues  
In this randomized, controlled, double -blinded clinical trial, eligible children will rec eive in a 
1:1:1 ratio either  600 IU or 1000 IU or 2000 IU vitamin D3 supplementation orally once daily for 
six months. Our primary outcome measure will be brachial FMD at 6 -month  follow -up. A 25% or 
more improvement in brachial FMD % in the 1000 IU or the 2000 IU group when compared to 
the 600 IU group, after six months of vitamin D replacement will be considered significant.  
Our secondary outcomes will include : (1) pulse wave velocity (PWV) as a measure of arterial 
stiffness, (2) 1/fasting insulin concentration as a surrogate for  insulin sensitivity, and (3) 
metabolic syndrome risk factors (blood pressure, waist circumference, HDL cholesterol, 
triglycerides, and fasting blood glucose) at the 6 -month  follow -up. 
9.2 Sample Size and Randomi zation  
Our sample size estimates are based on showing a relative improvement in baseline brachial 
artery flow mediated vasodilation (FMD, %) of at least 25% in children receiving each of the 
higher doses of vitamin D3 (1000 IU and 2000 IU) compared with no  improvement in the 600 IU 
group after six months of treatment. We assumed the baseline FMD was ~6.5% based on 
previous studies in overweight children similar to our projected population.12-[ADDRESS_533725] 84% power (two -sided two -
sample comparison of means, α=0.025) to detect this clinically important difference of 25% 
relative improvement (absolute improvement=25%*6.5% ≈1.6%) as suming a standard deviation 
of 2.6% (conservative estimates based on published literature).12,14 To provide for a projected 
drop -out rate of 25% by [CONTACT_124808], we propose to recruit [ADDRESS_533726] over 90% powe r to detect a dose -response effect by [CONTACT_422661] 
a 0%, 20%, and 30% improvement in vascular health among children receiving 600 IU, 1000 IU, 
and 2000 IU, respectively.  
Our original sample size of n=252 was based on 90% power and 20% attrition to allow for 
subgroup analyses by [CONTACT_545]. In December  of [ADDRESS_533727] 80% to detect the original effe ct size with 25% -30% 
attrition . The lower sample size of n=[ADDRESS_533728] of vitamin D supplementation. However, the proportion of African Americans in th e 
recruited sample was much larger than anticipated ; the small number of Caucasian subjects in 
the cohort  preclude s doing race -stratified analysis . For the secondary outcomes, we have 8 9% 
power to detect effect sizes of 0.61 or greater without adjustment f or multiplicity.  
 
Treatment Assignment Procedures  
In this randomized, controlled, double -blinded clinical trial, eligible children will be randomly 
allocated, using a permuted block design, in 1:1:1 ratio, to receive either conventional (600 IU) 
        Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]  
16 
 or enhance d (1000 IU or 2000 IU) vitamin D [ADDRESS_533729] access to the assigned doses until the end of 
the clinical trial [timing of planned breaking of randomization code]. Unmasking may occur in 
the instance of an SAE. The ISM may divulge the masked dosage to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_422642].

• Individual SAEs by [CONTACT_159584] a table of eve nt-specific cumulative rates, 
overall and by [CONTACT_422662]. Moore will work to ensure that all the information presented at the DSMB meetings 
remains confidential. Each report will be marked as such. At the end of each DSMB meeting, all 
reports will b e collected and destroyed. At the end of the meeting, t he DSMB will make 
recommendations regarding the continuation of the trial. [CONTACT_422670] will implement the 
DSMB recommendations. [CONTACT_422670] will also submit the DSMB recommendations to the 
IRB. 
9.4 Outcomes  
Primary outcome  
Our primary outcome measure will be change in mean FMD % at 6-month  follow -up. A 25% 
or more improvement in FMD % in the 1000 IU or 2000 IU compared to the 600 IU group 
after six months of vitamin D replacement will be considered signif icant.  
Secondary outcome  
        Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]  
17 
 Our secondary outcomes will include : (1) pulse wave velocity (PWV) as a measure of arterial 
stiffness, (2)  1/fasting insulin  concentration  as a surrogate for  insulin sensitivity, and (3) 
metabolic syndrome risk factors (blood press ure, waist circumference, HDL cholesterol, 
triglycerides, and fasting blood glucose) at the 6 -month  follow -up. 
9.5 Data Analyses  
Our primary analysis will use children’s original treatment assignment regardless of adherence 
(intention to treat). We will begin by [CONTACT_422663] D treatment groups (600 IU vs 1000 IU vs 2000 IU). Our 
primary outcome measure of vascular health is brachial artery FMD expressed as a percentage. 
We w ill use mixed -effects models with fixed effects of time  (baseline, 3 months, and 6 months) , 
the treatment *time interaction, and random subject effects to test for differential changes in 
FMD over time and differences in FMD at six months. We are primarily interested in the 
comparisons of each higher dose (1000 IU and 2000 IU) to the lower dose (600 IU) at six months 
(α=0.025 for each comparisons). The mixed -effects model will allow unbiased estimation of the 
treatment effects at six months even if some 6 -month data are missing because of the 
incorporated dependence among baseline, 3-month and 6 -month assessments (assuming data 
are missing at random). We will test the main effect of vitamin D supplementation ( three  
groups)  at [ADDRESS_533731] 
(α=0.05). We will use the same methodology to test the effects of higher doses of vitamin D on 
pulse -wave velocity, our primary measure of arterial stiffness.  
The second part of our primary analysis  of our trial is to determine whether higher  doses of 
vitamin D will result in improvements in insulin sensitivity and metabolic syndrome markers 
over time. We will use mixed -effects models with fixed effects of time  (baseline, 3 months, and 
6 months) , and the treatment  time interaction with random subject effects  to test for 
differential changes in secondary outcomes  over time. We will test the main effect of treatment 
(three  groups)  at 3 and 6 months  and pairwise comparisons of the groups receiving the larger 
doses of vitamin D with the group recei ving 600 IU.  All tests will be two sided with α=0.05. 
We will explore the mediating effects of inflammatory markers ( hs-CRP, IL -6, TNF -α) and 
adipokines (leptin and adiponectin) on the temporal relationship between vitamin D and 
vascular health. We hypoth esize that vitamin D effects on vascular health may be driven by 
[CONTACT_422664]. An analysis that would complement this hypothesis 
would be a mediation analysis where we demonstrate that the effect of vitamin D on vascular 
health is partially mediated by [CONTACT_422665]. We propose to 
use single -mediator and multiple -mediator methods incorporating product of coeffi cients to 
test for mediation.[ADDRESS_533732] demonstrate that 
the high dose vitamin D has a significant effec t on each mediator (inflammatory markers and 
adipokines) at three  and six months using a general linear model. We will then test whether [ADDRESS_533733] of the following coefficients: 1) the coefficient for the intervention effect on the 
mediator, and 2) the coefficient for the mediator in a model testing the intervention effect o n 
        Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]  
[ADDRESS_533734] substantial missing item -response data due to the electronic nature of data 
collection. Based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732], we anticipate <20% attrition at the [ADDRESS_533735] accounted for this in sample -size analyses. Participants w ho wish to discontinue 
the study drug will be asked to continue to participate in all follow -up visits; those who no 
longer wish to participate in the study will be considered dropouts, and we will monitor these 
events. We will obtain reasons for dropout i n case it appears possible to modify the protocol so 
as to increase retention. At the end of the study, we will compare baseline characteristics and 
treatment arms between participants who have received [ADDRESS_533736] on our study conclusions. The methods proposed assume that the 
data are missi ng at random (MAR), where the missing data mechanism is related to observed 
data, not the unobserved values. Although this assumption is difficult to confirm, our sensitivity 
analyses will allow us to assess the robustness of our findings and threats to th e MAR 
assumption. Given that our outcomes are highly mechanistic and less patient -relevant 
symptomatic/functional outcomes, missing data at [ADDRESS_533737] at 6 months using the covariance structure of the repeated measurements. Th is 
approach will be compared to a complete case analysis (missing complete at random) and a 
nonignorable missing data method  (pattern mixture modeling ). These different methods should 
result in consistent qualitative results if  our findings are robust to missing data.  
 
10. DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
10.1 Data Collection Forms  
Data based on source documents (eligibility , anthropometrics , demographics , etc.) will be 
assessed and  entered by [CONTACT_23164]. Data collecte d in paper records (skin -typi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
sun exposure history, DSM II color -meter readings, pubertal self -assessment, lab results,  
adverse events , etc.) will be entered  into the CRHC study database , and data with electronic 
outputs (vascular function results and adherence  data from MEMs cap) will be merged into the 
CRHC study database. Tracking reports will be developed to assess recruitment, participant

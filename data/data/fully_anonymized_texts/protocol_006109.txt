2 I. BACKGROUND 
 
Adaptive Biotechnologies has developed a platform technology called T -cell receptor β eta-1 
(TCRβ1) Assay  for immune profiling, also referred to as immunoSEQ§ in this proposal. The 
platform  utilizes next- generation sequencing (NGS) to identify rearranged T -cell receptor 
beta (TRβ)gene sequences and  the abundance of those sequences. This broad platform 
technology can be used to  determine the  diversity of the cellular adaptive immune system  and 
track  phenotype associated T -cell clones to query the current state and history of the adaptive 
immune system.   
 
Detecting Specific TCRs for Diagnostics1-3  
 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_352453] T -cell receptors (TCRs), many TCRs are quite 
common and repeatedly recur within and between individuals, comprising the public T -cell 
repertoire
4. These public TCRs are diagnostically useful because  once a TCR has been associated 
with a particular antigen or disease state, the association is reliable even when that TCR is seen in a new individual.  Using this technique, we have demonstrated that CMV infection can be assayed purely from the peripheral  TCR repertoire
3. 
 When specific TCRs associated with particular antigens  or disease states are known, scanning the 
T-cell repertoire for those specific sequences can be clinically useful. The purpose of this research 
study is to explore the immune system in individuals with coronavirus  disease . 
  
II. PROPOSED RESEARCH  
 The SARS -CoV -2 virus which causes coronavirus disease ( COVID -19) is spreading rapi[INVESTIGATOR_352454]. Researchers, governments, and biotechnology companies are mobilizing to develop and disseminate diagnostic and therapeutic alternatives to try to curb t his global 
pandemic. The vast majority of these R&D efforts are focused on the RNA of the virus itself rather than critical information held within the genetics of a patient 's immune response to the 
virus and the disease patterns we can infer from studying the immune response at the population level.  
 
First, we will identify the parts of the virus, called antigens, that induce a cellular immune 
response via T cells. We do this by [CONTACT_28423][INVESTIGATOR_352455], 
presented, immunogenic, and immunodominant antigens from a disease. This has historically 
been very challenging for the immunology community and we are confident that our approach is a significant breakthrough in the field. Next, we use these antigens to identify tens of thousands 
of T-cell receptors from T cells that expand in response  to the virus across the human population. 
This requires the scale of data generation and processing made possible by [CONTACT_352461].  In parallel, we will identify and confirm the TCR signature [CONTACT_352473] -
CoV -2 virus . To do this, we require  DNA extracted from the peripheral blood or whole blood of

recovered from the virus because the immune response will still be identifi able in the memory 
compartment.  
 
 
III. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY  
 
The primary aim is to increase the understanding of  the immune system response in coronavirus  
diseases by [CONTACT_352462] a secondary aim of  BCRs , 
specific to  severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (SARS -CoV -2), the virus which 
causes COVID -19, with the potential to develop better diagnostic  tests and treatments . 
 Adaptive and Microsoft are committed  to making T CR repertoire data public  to researchers 
around the world. We hypothesize that by [CONTACT_352463]- [ADDRESS_438778] the diagnostic classifier  
obtained in Aim 1. In addition, the identification of immunodominant epi[INVESTIGATOR_322] c an be 
disseminated to fuel studies in vaccine desi gn and antigen specific T -cell responses relating to 
clinical outcome  in other labs . 
 Aim 3.  Risk Stratification  based on an individual's immune signature  
 [CONTACT_352474] a critical need for a reliable risk stratification test to enable treatment prioritization given the potentially massive number of symptomatic patients. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_352456] -19, how it spreads, and the death rate, there is no 
currently available way to predict who needs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_352457].,  Seattle, Washington,  [LOCATION_003]

immune response by [CONTACT_352465] T cells in a patient's blood. By [CONTACT_352466] a patient's immune response, which may be temporarily bolstered by 
[CONTACT_352467] (e.g., common cold) in some people, we may be able to 
significantly improve the diagnostic and risk stratification process.     Aim 4.  Determ ine whether an immune signature [CONTACT_352475] -CoV- [ADDRESS_438780] in 
asymptomatic people even if the virus itself is not directly detectable in the upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_352459].   Secondary Aim : 
Aim 5 . Explore whether additional research assays could potential identify and/or confirm 
antigenic binding  
 
As a secondary aim, Adaptive will perform explorational research with  additional sequencing-based 
research assays  to profile the adaptive immune system, such as, but not limited to TCR pairSEQ**6 
and B-cell receptor (BCR)  pairSEQ††.  These assays use a combinatorial method for pairing TCR 
alpha and beta chain sequences and BCR heavy and light chain sequences. The output is a large set 
of full length paired BCR or TCR sequences, which allows reconstruction of a functional antibody or 
TCR. We regularly utilize the results of our pairSEQ assays to identify and/or confirm antigenic binding. For the case of BCR pairSEQ, the resulting antibody sequences could pot entially have 
therapeutic value for imparting passive immunity.

Metadata Summary :  
For each sample the following metadata will be included , but not limited to :  
i. Basic demographics (age at collection, gender, ethnicity/race)  
ii. Symptoms associated with coronavirus disease and at time of  blood draw

Data  Analysis  
 Data analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_352469]. In collaboration with Microsoft, we will use these data to construct a classifier that  
accurately distinguishes cases from controls with the use of machine  learning and artificial  
intelligence (AI) based on TCR repertoire analysis. A rigorous statistical analysis will be  
performed.   
 For the secondary aim, TCR pairSEQ and /or BCR pairSEQ assay analysis  will be performed. 
This involves a  combinatorial method for pairing TCR alpha and beta chain sequences and BCR 
heavy and light chain sequences will be performed, allowing reconstruction of a functional antibody or TCR.   This study is considered minimal risk and does not require additional data  monitoring measure s 
in place.

Rationale:  With its novel mechanism of AMPA receptor blockade, Fycompa is efficacious  
for seizure reduction in both partial onset seizures and generalized tonic-clonic 
seizures. As only a  few of antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_655257], it is 
important to elucidate the ideal methods of avoiding complications and 
improving retention rates .   
Recent studies find real -world rates currently range from 44-89% (Trinka et al 
2016).  Personal clinical experience has revealed difficulty in maintaining 
patients on Fycompa due to adverse effects.  However, certain studies find 
correlation s between slower titration schedules and lower side effect 
percentages (Trinka et al 2016, Lawthom et al, 2014) .   
We therefore propose to test whether a slower initial upward titration (2mg 
increase every 3 weeks) improves 1 -year  retention rat es as compared to those of 
a more typi[INVESTIGATOR_655258] 2 weeks.   As any retention rate may be affected 
by [CONTACT_655271]/or seizure frequency, these will be followed as secondary 
endpoints.  
Study Design:  
 
        
 A total of 60 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of either partial onset or 
primary generalized epi[INVESTIGATOR_655259]. 30 patients will 
initiate Fycompa at a dose of 2 mg/day and titrate upward every 2 weeks to a target dose of 6 mg/da y. Patients in this group will be designated Group A. The 
remaining 30 patients will also begin Fycompa at a dose of 2 mg/day but will titrate upwards every 3 weeks to a target dose of 6 mg/day  and will be 
designated Group B. Initial study visits will occur every two weeks for the first 
2 months in order to assess for titration related adverse effects. Long term 
evaluation of retention rates will be calculated at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after 
enrollment.  
 
Version 11/03/2017 
 
Objectives:  Primary:  
To evaluate the differences in retention rate between patients using a more 
conventional upward titration schedule (Group A) vs. those using a 
slower  up-titration schedule (Group B).  
Secondary:  
1. To compare the adverse effects reported in patients u p-titrating 
Fycompa  at a slower titration rate  (Group B) to those titrating at a 
more conventional rate  (Group A) . 
2. To evaluate the short term and long term efficacy of perampanel 
between the two treatment groups.  
Subjects and Centers:  A total of 60 epi[INVESTIGATOR_655260]. 30 patients will be randomly assigned to treatment group A, up-titrating Fycompa every 2 weeks while the remaining 30 being assigned to group B, up -titrating Fycompa every 3 
weeks.  
Inclusion Criteria:  1. Must provide written informed consent signed by [CONTACT_655272], GCP guidelines if the written informed consent is provided by [CONTACT_655273], a written or verbal assent from the subject must also be obtained.  
2. Subject has a confirmed diagnosis of medically refractory epi[INVESTIGATOR_655261] a t least 12 months prior to visit 1.  
3. Subjects currently being treated with 1 to 3 antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_655262] (does not count as an AED).  
4. Subjects aged [ADDRESS_879650]’s requiring an additional epi[INVESTIGATOR_655263]/or lack of tolerability with current epi[INVESTIGATOR_655264]  
6. Can be safely treated, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_655265].  
7. Able and agrees to follow specified titration schedule  
8. Subjects or a legal guardian who is able to communicate effectively with study personnel and considered reliable, able, willing and cooperative with 
regard to complying with protocol -defined requirements, including 
completion of the study diary.  
 
Version 11/03/2017 
 
Exclusion Criteria:  1. Any history of non-epi[INVESTIGATOR_655266].  
2. Women who are currently pregnant, lactating or 
have plans to become pregnant in the immediate future. 
3. Subjects with active suicidal ideation or behavior as evidenced by [CONTACT_655274] (C -SSRS) or

6. Subjects with severe hepatic impairment or severe renal impairment or on hemodialysis.  
7. Any use of concomitant medication as listed in the drug insert, including medications known to be inducers of cytochrome P450 
(CYP3A).

IIS PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
 
Other Therapy:  Concomitant  antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_655267]/or sub-investigators. . 
Efficacy Measures:  Patient diaries containing seizure types and frequencies along with adverse 
effects experienced will be maintained.  Seizure diaries will be reviewed in 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_655268]: weeks 
0, 2, 4, 6, 8 then mont hs 3, 6, 9, and 12 .  Data point collation at study visits will 
include:  
  1. Fycompa dose taken and duration at this dose  
  2. Adverse effects experienced  
  3. Alterations to Fycompa dose once in maintenance phase.  
  4. Interim seizure types and number of each  
  5. Interim changes in other medication during maintenance phase.    
Safety Measures:  Adverse effects  and seizure frequency will be assessed  at each clinic visit along 
with vital sign measurements  and brief neurological exams .  Dosage 
adjustments of the Fycompa and other concomitant medications will be done at 
the discretion of the Investigator  during the maintenance phase.  
Correlative Science:  Data collected  will be based on the patient’s seizure /adverse effect diary  as well 
as patient/caregiver reports at each study visit . 
Statistical Analysis:  The study will target a total size of 60 patients (30 per group).  This sample size 
will allow for a power of 0.85 to determine significant difference of 30% retention in group A  and 70% retention in group B.   
Primary endpoint will be Fycompa retention rate at the end of 1 year with 
Kaplan -Meier survival curves created for both groups .  Log rank testing will be 
done to determine significant difference (p<0.05). Cox proportional hazard test 
will be done to quantify the odds of retention in each arm.  
Secondary endpoint analysis will be done to tabulated side effects experienced 
in each group and the percentages of patients reporting  the effects. Seizure 
frequency per 28 days during initial titration and final maintenance will be 
calculated for each group.  Comparison within groups will be made by [CONTACT_134245].  
Data Collection:  Data will be collected at each study  visit through patient inte rview and the use 
of a seizure/adverse effect diary.

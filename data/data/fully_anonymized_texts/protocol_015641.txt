PRÉCIS
Background:
xChimeric antigen receptors (CAR) that recognize the CD19 antigen have been 
constructed and are in clinical trials at several institutions. In this trial, the POB will utilize a chimeric receptor containing the signaling domains of CD28 and CD3-zeta, 
currently under study in the CCR in adults, for children and young adults with CD19 
expressing malignancies. 
xIn co-cultures with CD19-expressing acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, anti-CD19-
CAR-transduced T cells show robust killing, and in xenograft models, can rapi[INVESTIGATOR_839119]19-expressing ALL cell lines.
Objectives:
1) To determine the safety and feasibility of administering escalating doses of anti-CD19-
CAR engineered peripheral blood lymphocytes in two strata (prior allogeneic stem cell 
transplant [SCT] vs. no prior SCT) of children and young adults with B cell malignancies 
following a cyclophosphamide/fludarabine preparative regimen. COMPLETED March 
2014.
2) To determine the safety of administering cells in two groups of children and young adults 
with B-cell malignancies expressing CD19:
xArm 1 – Patients without high-burden dis ease or patients for whom chemotherapy 
toxicity is a concern will receive standard preparative regimen.
xArm 2 – Patients with high-burden disease who receive standard chemotherapy to 
reduce burden, (defined as patients with ALL who have M3 bone marrow blasts 
and/or presence of peripheral blood blasts on routine CBC, or patients with lymphoma). 
3) To determine the feasibility of administering anti-CD19 CAR transduced T cells within 
21 days of the target date in children and young adults with B-cell malignancies expressing CD19 enrolled on arm 2: Patients with high-burden disease who receive standard chemotherapy to reduce burden.
Eligibility:
Patients 1-[ADDRESS_1165934] who meet all eligibility criteria are eligible to participate.
Design:
xPBMC will be obtained by [CONTACT_74886].  Anti-CD19 CAR T cells will be manufactured 
from fresh or frozen PBMCs. On Day -7, PBMC will be enriched for CD3+ cells and 
cultured in the presence of anti-CD3/-CD28 beads followed by [CONTACT_839152]

1.2 B
ACKGROUND AND RATIONALE
1.2.1 Pediatric B-cell Malignancies
Between infancy and 15 years of age, cancer is the leading cause of death by [CONTACT_839153] U.S. 
children1. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) represents the most common pediatric 
malignancy, accounting for approximately 25% of childhood cancer. Although disease-free-survival rates are high for children with ALL, approximately 20% still die of their underlying 
disease, making ALL the leading cause of cancer death in childhood. For those who relapse, 
long-term prognosis is poor. Even with attainme nt of a second remission and despi[INVESTIGATOR_839121], long-term disease-free survival rates of <50% are expected
2. New treatment 
approaches are needed to overcome resistance to standard therapy.
1.2.2 Adoptive Cell Therapy using Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CARs)Adoptive transfer of donor T cells following bone marrow transplantation has shown activity in 
recurrent leukemia
3,4and adoptive therapy with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) has shown 
activity in some cancers5. More recently, adoptive transfer of T cells transduced with the genes 
of tumor-antigen-specific T cell receptors caused regressions of melanoma and synovial cell 
sarcoma in some patients6. Another approach to adoptive T cell therapy is to engineer T cells to 
express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). CARs are made up of a single chain variable 
fragment (scFv) coupled to signaling molecules that can activate T cells expressing the CAR7-9.
The earliest preclinical work conducted with CARs was performed in the late 1980s10,11and 
more recently, CARs have been designed to target many different tumor antigens and many 
important questions have been addressed using CARs in mouse models. Murine models have 
shown that syngeneic T cells transduced with retroviruses encoding CARs protected mice from 
tumor challenges in vivo12,13. Murine models indicated that inclusion of CD28 signaling domains 
enhanced tumor cytotoxicity and persistence of CAR-transduced T cells14,15. Increasing the

CARs targeting carbonic anhydrase IX in kidney cancer19, anti-GD2 CARs in neuroblastoma20,21,
anti-CD20-CAR T cells in B cell lymphoma, anti-Her2Neu CAR therapy22, as well as anti-CD19 
CAR therapy (discussed in greater detail below). From this early clinical experience, several 
general conclusions are emerging. First, chimeric antigen receptor expressing T cells can mediate 
antitumor activity as tumor shrinkage has been demonstrated in neuroblastoma20and 
lymphoma23. Second, the CAR engineered T cells can induce substantial toxicity primarily 
related to cytokine storm24, as on-target but off-tumor toxicity resulting from antigen expression 
on normal tissues19. Thirdly, antitumor effects appear to correlate with cell persistence and 
lymphopenia inducing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as chemotherapy administered prior to CAR therapy, 
which also appears to increase the incidence and degree of CAR-cell persistence. Another factor 
potentially modulating persistence is anti-CAR immune responses as recently demonstrated in 
patients with lymphoma and renal cell carcinoma19,25. Finally, recent data demonstrates that 2nd 
generation chimeric antigen receptor T cells that incorporate a co-stimulatory domain, such as CD28, have superior persistenc e and expansion compared to 1st generation CAR T cells that 
have only one signaling motif (usually zeta subunit of the T-Cell Receptor)
26. The historical 
development and composition of CARs are discussed at length in the following paper: Savoldo, 
B., et al., CD28 costimulation improves expansio n and persistence of chimeric antigen receptor-
modified T cells in lymphoma patients. J Clin Invest. 121(5): p. 1822-626. Based upon these 
principles, we performed a dose-escalation tria l of anti-CD19 CAR T cells (2nd generation) after 
a pre-CAR lymphodepleting regimen.

acceptable quality of life as a result of intravenous infusions of IgG18.
The anti-CD19 CAR used in this study consists of three main components: the variable regions 
of the anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody FMC6332, the signaling domain of the CD28 
costimulatory molecule, and the signaling domain of the CD3 zeta chain33. This receptor is 
referred to as FMC63-28. The DNA encoding this receptor was cloned into the MSGV1 
retroviral vector backbone34to form the plasmid shown in Figure 1A. This plasmid is referred to 
as MSGV1-FMC63-28. For the remainder of this document the FMC63-28 receptor will be 
referred to as the anti-CD19 CAR.

Preliminary experiments using transiently produced retroviral supernatant for transduction 
showed that the FMC63-28 receptor functioned well in vitro; therefore, a stable producer cell 
clone that produces gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) pseudotyped retrovirus encoding the 
FMC63-28 anti-CD19 CAR was generated. The supernatant from this clone was used for the experiments described in this document. 
In addition to the extensive in vitro experiments already performed
34we confirmed the suitability 
of the anti-CD19 CAR for use in a clinical trial targeting pediatric B-cell malignancies. Normal 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were activated using artificial antigen presenting 
cells (aAPC) loaded with the anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody OKT3 and in the presence of IL-2
to activate T cells and induce their proliferation. After 48 hours of stimulation, the T cells were 
exposed to gamma-retrovirus encoding the anti-CD19 CAR that was spin-loaded onto a 
retronectin-coated plate, then cultured overnight with a second transduction performed on Day 2.
Transduction efficiency was determined using biotinylated Protein L. Protein L is a recombinant

protein that interacts with the constant region of kappa chains in scFv (present in anti-CD19-
CAR) or Fab fragments. Following transduction, the cultured cells were almost entirely CD3+T
cells, with transduction efficiencies of 30-70% as measured by [CONTACT_839155]. An example of 
staining of anti-CD19-transduced T cells with biotinylated Protein L is shown in Figure 1B .
CD19-CAR transduced T cells demonstrate cytotoxicity against CD19 expressing ALL cell lines 
in vitro but not CD19 negative controls with an average of 50-60% cytotoxicity at effector-to-
target ratios as low as 2.5:1 ( Figure 2A ). Anti-CD19-CAR T cells also produce significant levels 
of interferon- J(IFNJ), tumor necrosis factor- D(TNFD) and IL-2 specifically in response to 
CD19-expressing target cell lines ( Figure 2B-D ).
In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_255952], immunodeficient NOG (NOD/Shi- scid/IL-5Ȗnull) mice were injected via 
tail vein with one million NALM6-GL cells (human ALL stably expressing GFP and luciferase) 
four days prior to injection of either anti-CD19-CAR T cells or stimulated but untransduced T 
cells (Mock). At the time of injection of T cells, mice already had bioluminescent evidence of 
leukemia ( Figure 3A ). Surprisingly, only forty hours after T cell injection the mice that received 
anti-CD19-CAR T cells nearly cleared their leukemia. By [CONTACT_2006] 7, all but one of the treated mice were free of leukemia while the mice that received Mock T cells continued to progress in their 
disease burden (Figure 3B ) and required sacrifice by [CONTACT_2006] 17.

Version Date: 01/12/[ADDRESS_1165939] replicated this data using anti-CD3/anti-CD28 beads in lieu of aAPC for T cell 
stimulation as this is the approach we will use to expand the anti-CD19-CAR cells in this trial. 
PBMC will be collected, CD3+ cells will be enriched using anti-CD3/anti-CD28 beads cultured 
in the presence of IL-[ADDRESS_1165940] equivalent transduction efficiencies as indicated by 
[CONTACT_839156] L ( Figure 4A ). Immunodeficient NOG mice were again injected with 
one million NALM6-GL cells four days prior to  injection of anti-CD19-CAR T cells generated 
using beads. Control mice received equivalent numbers of untransduced T cells (Mock) that had 
been stimulated with beads. All mice treated with anti-CD19-CAR T cells cleared all 
bioluminescent evidence of ALL within 48 hours ( Figure 4B ). This indicates that anti-CD19-
CAR T cells are a potent therapeutic agent against human ALL and strongly supports pursuit of 
such therapy in human clinical trials targeting pediatric ALL.
1.2.[ADDRESS_1165941] constructed anti-CD19 CARs35. Jensen and coworkers completed a 
clinical trial of adoptive transfer of T cells transfected with a plasmid encoding an anti-CD19 

13
Abbreviated Title: Phase I Anti-CD 19 CAR
Version Date: 01/12/[ADDRESS_1165942] important difference is that our 
proposed trial will use a retroviral vector rather than plasmid transfection to transfer an anti-
CD19 receptor to T cells, thus resulting in integration and persistent (rather than transient) CAR 
expression. Another potentially important difference is that the CAR we propose to utilize in our 
clinical trial contains the signaling component of CD28, whereas the receptor construct used by 
[CONTACT_330406] a CD28 moiety. 
Researchers at MSKCC conducted a clinical trial of adoptive transfer of T cells that have been 
transduced with retroviruses encoding an anti-CD19 receptor (NCI Clinical Trials PDQ, trial 
MSKCC trial #09-114, Principal Investigator: R. Brentjens). This trial enrolled only adult ALL 
patients. In this trial, CAR-transduced T cells are transferred to patients without preparative 
chemotherapy prior to cell transfer. They have since modified their protocol to include a 
preparative regimen and are enrolling both children and adults with ALL ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  Our 
trial differs from the trial of Brentjens and coworkers in several ways. First, we will treat a 
pediatric population with B-cell malignancies and will not exclude patients who have already 
undergone an allogeneic stem cell transplant (whi ch comprises the majority of pediatric patients 
with refractory ALL). Secondly, we will include a lymphodepleting preparative regimen prior to cell infusion, which should allow for improved engraftment and function of infused T cells.

At Baylor College of Medicine, Dotti, Brenner, and coworkers are conducting three clinical trials 
involving anti-CD19 CAR. First, two types of anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cells, one with both 
the CD3-zeta and CD28 signaling moieties and one with only CD3-zeta, are administered to 
adult patients with indolent B cell malignancies  (NCI Clinical Trials PDQ, trial [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) 
in a 1:[ADDRESS_1165949] both CD3-zeta and CD28. In addition, the use of anti-CD3/-CD28 beads to expand our CD19-CAR cells is not being performed at Baylor. 
A second trial at Baylor involves EBV-specific T cells are first pulsed with dendritic cells and 
peptide for CMV and adenovirus to generate tri-viral specific T cells, which are then transduced 
with anti-CD19-CAR (NCI Clinical Trials PDQ, trial #BCM- H-[ZIP_CODE]). Tri-viral anti-CD19-
CAR T cells are then administered to patients with pre-B ALL, CLL, or B-cell lymphomas 
undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell tr ansplantation. Generation of cells using this 
method takes several months. Our proposed trial di ffers from this trial in that we will produce 
cells in a few days’ time thereby [CONTACT_839157]. Also, we will include patients who have previously received an allogeneic 
transplant but obtain cells for transduction directly from the patient rather than the original 
donor. Tolerized donor derived cells obtained directly from patients who have no GVH and are 
off immunosuppression have less chance of generating severe GVH upon reinfusion as compared to host-naïve T cells obtained directly from the donor. Finally, our trial will incorporate a 
lymphodepleting preparatory regimen whereas that of Bollard and coworkers does not.

Version Date: 01/12/[ADDRESS_1165950] previously had an allogeneic 
stem cell transplant for a B-cell malignancy and are now recurrent or refractory (NCI Clinical 
Trials PDQ, trial #10-C-0054). In this trial, T cells are obtained from the patient’s donor, 
activated with anti-CD3 (OKT3) in the presence  of IL-2, and then transduced with anti-CD19-
CAR. No preparative regimen is used.  As is often seen in patients who receive donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI), these cells may induce significant GVH. The key difference 
between this and our study is that for patients who have had an allogeneic transplant we will 
obtain tolerized T cells directly from those patients who have no active GVH off 
immunosuppression. This may result in less risk for severe GVH.  Further, to improve the 
function of CAR T cells we will administer a preparative regimen.
Carl June and coworkers at the University of Pennsylvania have opened a Phase I clinical trial of 
anti-CD19-CAR transduced T cells in adults with CD19+ B-cell malignancies (NCI Clinical 
Trials PDQ, trial #UPCC [ZIP_CODE]). They are evaluating two different anti-CD19-CARs delivered 
using a lentiviral vector: one with both CD3-zeta and the costimulatory molecule 4-1BB (CART-
19-zeta:41BB) and one with only CD3-zeta (CART-19-zeta). The first group of patients who 
received only CART-19-zeta:41BB have tolerated it well and some have had significant clinical 
responses
38,39. The intended dose range was 1 x 109to 1 x 1010CD3+ T cells (not on a /kg basis), 
but they have had significant difficulty in growing T cells ex vivo as most of their patients had prior treatment with fludarabine for CLL. However, one patient who received only 2 x 10
5
CART-19-zeta:41BB cells/kg had a complete re sponse. This provides support for potential 
clinical activity at the dose levels we have proposed in the present study. The use of CD28 rather 
than 4-1BB as costimulation for T cells, the use of a non-ablative preparative regimen prior to 
anti-CD19-CAR T cell infusion, and including pediatric patients are key differences between 
June’s study and ours.
Interestingly, one patient experienced grade [ADDRESS_1165951] cell infusion, progressing to rigors, 
diaphoresis, anorexia, nausea and diarrhea. Laboratory values were consistent with tumor lysis 
syndrome with hyperuricemia, elevated LDH and elevated creatinine levels. The patient also had 
transient grade 1 thrombocytopenia from day 19 through day 26 and grade 1 or 2 neutropenia 
from day 17 through day 33. Other signs and symptoms probably related to the study treatment 
included grade 1-2 elevations in alkaline phosphatase and transaminases, grade 2 
hypogammaglobulinemia, and constitutional sympto ms, including those noted above as well as 
myalgias and headache. 
June has recently opened a Phase II clinical trial of CART-19-zeta;41BB but this is restricted to 
adults and the preparative regimen used, if any, is unclear.  His group has not published pediatric 
phase I results.

Version Date: 01/12/[ADDRESS_1165952]. June, Stephen Grupp and colleagues are enrolling children with ALL 
on a Phase I trial of CART-10-zeta;41BB.  Two case reports demonstrated complete responses 
and significant cytokine storm40. No other results have been published but dosing is based on 
total T cells rather than CAR T cell dose and patients receive dealer’s choice preparative 
regimen.
Persis Amrolia and colleagues at the Great Ormond Street Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_839123]-CD19-CAR trial for pediatric patients with pre-B ALL who are undergoing 
allogeneic stem cell transplantation from an EBV seropositive donor (NCI Clinical Trials PDQ, 
trial #UCL/09/0050). Enrolled pa tients will receive 2 x 108/m2(approx. 1.6 x 106/kg) donor 
derived, EBV-specific T cells modified to express an anti-CD19-CAR that contains only CD3-zeta after transplantation. Patients will then receive 3 doses of irradiated donor-derived EBV-
lymphoblastoid cells from the cell line used to generate the CTL as a vaccine. Our proposed 
protocol differs significantly from Amrolia and coworkers in that our anti-CD19-CAR contains 
both CD3-zeta and CD28, will not be used in conjunction with allogeneic stem cell 
transplantation, and will not be EBV-specific. The latter feature of our trial allows for relatively 
rapid production of the cells while not necessarily sacrificing long-term persistence of transduced T cells in vivo .
Rosenberg and colleagues are conducting a clinical trial of autologous CD19-CAR T cells in the 
NIH Clinical Center (#09-C-0082) that employs high dose and low dose IL-2 and is limited to 
adult patients with B-cell lymphoma and CLL
41. While the CAR cells are identical to those used 
in this trial, our method for growing the CAR-transduced T cells (anti-CD3/CD28 beads), the absence of IL-[ADDRESS_1165953] adoptive therapy, 
while four of the eight had elevated serum inflammatory cytokine levels (IFN gamma and tumor 
necrosis factor alpha [TNF D]). Toxicities included grade 3 and 4 myelosuppression, elevated 
liver function tests, hypermagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, hypernatremia, 
hyperuricemia, hyperbilirubinemia, hypotension, fatigue, febrile neutropenia, sepsis, hypoxia, 
dyspnea, pleural effusion, acute renal failure, and capi[INVESTIGATOR_12737], Additional toxicities 
included: reversible grade 4 somnolence (2 patients) and grade 4 creatinine (1 patient),  and 
reversible grade 2 left ventricular dysfunction and reversible grade 1 pulmonary hypotension (1 
patient).  Three patients on this study were in tubated for 7, 9 and 10 days, respectively. One 
patient underwent dialysis. One patient died 18 da ys after CAR-transduced T cell infusion with 
culture-proven influenza A, nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis, and cerebral infarction, which were deemed unrelated to the anti-CD19 CAR-transduced cells. Results
41demonstrated that:
xElevated IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha levels in a subset of patients occurred during the first 10 days after cell infusion; 
xIn [ADDRESS_1165954] dose of exogenous IL-2 administration, 
suggesting their toxicities were not attributable to the IL-2, but rather to serum 
inflammatory cytokine levels caused by [CONTACT_16682]-CD19 CAR transduced cell infusions; 
and
17
Abbreviated Title: Phase I Anti-CD 19 CAR
Version Date: 01/12/[ADDRESS_1165955] contributed to the severity, as 
demonstrated in a mouse model42.
Rosenberg, et al39conclude that anti-CD19 CAR transduced T cells can eradicate CD19+ cells in 
humans and that the cytokine-associated toxicities that have occurred with these cells may not be 
related to exogenous IL-2 administration.
Again, our study will differ significantly from the Rosenberg trial by [CONTACT_839158]. However, in light of 
these recent findings we will closely monitor patients and attempt to correlate toxicities observed 
with serum cytokine levels, although this will not be available in real time.
An additional study has been initiated by [CONTACT_839159] (#10-C-0054) using allogeneic T cells 
genetically modified with the same anti-CD19 CAR retroviral vector in patients with CLL. The 
first patient experienced dramatic regression. This patient had relaps ed after HLA-matched 
unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, followed by 4 donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs) and a second stem cell transplant from the original donor, without a response. 
He received an infusion of 6.2x10
7(1x106cells/kg) allogeneic anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T 
cells derived from his unrelated transplant donor five months after the second transplant. He experienced fevers, fatigue, mild hypoxemia and intermittent mild hypotension, with increase in 
serum magnesium, phosphorous and uric acid, consistent with tumor lysis syndrome. In addition,
he experienced a decrease in cardiac left ventri cular function, which subsequently improved. The 
patient’s blood B cell count decreased from 286 cells/mcL before the CAR-transduced T cell infusion to 0 cells/mcL [ADDRESS_1165956] scans revealed a greater than 50% 
decrease in the size of multiple lymph nodes after the CAR-transduced T cell infusion, but 
residual adenopathy was present. Kochenderfer is also treating adults who have relapsed after 
allogeneic SCT with CAR T cells that are generated from the transplant donor rather then the 
patient.  No preparative regimen is given before cell infusion.  Although responses have been small, no reported GVH has occurred to date.
To summarize our responses to date in the 20 patients enrolled, all 20 were infused with CAR T 
cells.  Our feasibility rate was 89% as 2 patients did not meet the assigned dose level but were 
still infused with cells.  One of these received 28,000 CAR-transduced T cells/kg (3% of 
prescribed dose) and had stable disease.  Another received 480,000 CAR+ T cells/kg (16% of 
prescribed dose), and experienced an MRD-negative CR, then underwent HSCT and remains 
disease free 13·4 months after CD19-CAR therapy.  In an intent-to-treat analysis of all enrolled 
patients, our therapy produced a 65% Complete Response (CR) rate.  Eleven had MRD negative 
CRs and were therefore considered for allogeneic SCT, which is standard of care for such 
patients.  All but [ADDRESS_1165957] and remain leukemia-free (LFS 75% median f/u 14.5 
months). The remaining [ADDRESS_1165958] and relapsed with CD19 negative leukemia.  Therefore, we determined that our CAR T cell therapy serves as an effective bridge to transplant.
We determined the MTD to be 1 x 10
6CAR transduced T cells/kg.  Three grade [ADDRESS_1165959] 
occurred on our protocol during both the dose es calation and dose expansion phases.  Specifics 
are detailed in Section [IP_ADDRESS] , but briefly all adverse events in these and the remaining patients

were completely reversible.  Four patients required use of the anti-IL6 receptor monoclonal 
antibody, tocilizumab, to blunt the effects of severe CRS. Our experience has led to publication 
of a consensus paper on the modified grading and treatment of CRS and is incorporated in this 
protocol to improve safety.
In summary, T cells transduced with gamma-retroviruses encoding the sequence of this CAR can 
specifically recognize and kill CD19 expressing acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells in vitro and 
in vivo in xenograft models. These anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cells also produce the 
cytokines interferon- J(INFJ), tumor necrosis factor D(TNFD) and IL-[ADDRESS_1165960] a clinical trial in which gamma-retroviruses 
encoding the anti-CD19 CAR will be used to transduce T cells in the Department of Transfusion 
Medicine Cell Processing Facility from patients with advanced pediatric B cell malignancies. 
The protocol will enroll patients at the MTD to gain more experience with using this therapy and 
to decrease the incidence of grade 4 CRS through the use of early intervention using well-
defined criteria and by [CONTACT_839160]. Subjects will receive a non-ablative, lymphocyte depleting preparatory regimen followed by [CONTACT_145118]-
CD19-CAR transduced T cells.
1.2.5 Safety ConsiderationsSeveral safety concerns regarding the infusion of large numbers of retrovirally modified tumor 
reactive T-cells should be addressed.
[IP_ADDRESS] Risk of chemotherapy
Toxicities resulting from fludarabine and cyclophosphamide in the doses proposed in the current
study are well known. Such a preparative regimen is designed to decrease the number of 
endogenous T cells, including T regulatory cells, which may otherwise suppress anti-CD19-CAR 
T cell cytotoxicity, and to induce the production of homeostatic cytokines thereby [CONTACT_839161]-CD19-CAR T cells. The dose limiting toxicity for both 
fludarabine and cyclophosphamide is myelosuppression, however myelosuppressive effects are 
expected to be transient using the doses proposed. Other toxicities including fever, nausea, 
vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhea, anorexia, edema, skin rashes, myalgias, headache, agitation, and 
fatigue should be easily managed with appropriate supportive care. Sterile hemorrhagic cystitis 
occurs in about 20% of patients who receive cyclophosphamide. Severity can range from 
microscopic hematuria to extensive cystitis with bladder fibrosis. Mesna will be used 
prophylactically as a uroprotective agent, but is not effective in preventing hemorrhagic cystitis 
in all patients. Furthermore, hemorrhagic cystitis is unlikely given the relatively low dose of 
cyclophosphamide administered in this trial. Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) following fludarabine 
and cyclophosphamide administration has been observed, especially in patients with advanced 
bulky disease. Before beginning chemotherapy, patients will be prescribed allopurinol and 
appropriately hydrated with close monitoring for the development of TLS. Finally, opportunistic 
infections (protozoan, viral, fungal, and bacter ial) have been observed post-fludarabine and 
cyclophosphamide, especially in heavily pre-treated individuals. Patients will receive appropriate 
antimicrobial prophylaxis (eg, Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis) during treatment.
Patients with higher disease burdens (Arm 2) will receive a standard salvage regimen in lieu of 
the fludarabine/cyclophosphamide lymphodepleting regimen.  The regimen will consist of 
19
Abbreviated Title: Phase I Anti-CD 19 CAR
Version Date: 01/12/2018
fludarabine, cytarabine, and filgrastim (FLAG) and has been used routinely in the POB.  Risks of 
fludarabine are described above.
[IP_ADDRESS] Risk of AutoimmunityAs discussed above, expansion of tumor reactive cells is a desirable outcome following the 
infusion of antigen reactive T-cells. Some patients receiving gp100 or MART-[ADDRESS_1165961] 
been encountered on the study to date.
[IP_ADDRESS] Risk of Gene TherapyRisks of gene therapy include insertional mutagenesis or emergence of replication-competent 
retrovirus (RCR). While insertional mutagenesis is theoretically possible using retroviral vectors, 
this has only been observed in the setting of infants treated for X-SCID using retroviral vector-
mediated gene transfer into CD34+ bone marrow stem cells. In the case of retroviral vector-
mediated gene transfer into mature T-cells, there has been no evidence of long-term toxicities 
associated with these procedures since the first NCI sponsored gene transfer study in 1989. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_839124] T-cells is a safe procedure, continued follow-up of all gene 
therapy patients will be performed as required. The proposed protocol follows all current FDA 
guidelines regarding testing and follow up of patients receiving gene transduced cells. Similarly, 
the viral vectors used have been engineered to minimize the risk of emergence of replication 
competent retrovirus, but patients will be monitored according to Recombinant DNA Advisory 
Committee guidelines for several years following receipt of this therapy and in the case of the 
development of second malignancy, all efforts will be made to determine whether replication 
competent retrovirus has emerged.
[IP_ADDRESS] Risk of Cytokine StormCytokine storm is a safety concern with the use of CAR transduced adoptive cell therapy. The 
cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is defined cl inically by [CONTACT_33234], headache, tachycardia, 
hypotension, rash and shortness of breath (CTCAE 4.0 definition) but may also result in other organ and neurologic dysfunction. Believed to be caused by [CONTACT_839162], IL-6 appears to play a major role. A rapid rise in serum 
cytokine levels (cytokine storm) has been associated with Systemic Inflammatory Response 
Syndrome (SIRS) potentially leading to multi-organ dysfunction (MOD)
43. This syndrome has 
20
Abbreviated Title: Phase I Anti-CD 19 CAR
Version Date: 01/12/2018
been described following various forms of immunotherapy, including antibody infusions (e.g. 
OKT344, Rituximab45, Campath46, anti-CD2847) but also following cellular immunotherapy.
Fatal cytokine storm occurred in one patient in the Surgery Branch, NCI with metastatic 
adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon, receiving anti-Her2-CAR gene engineered lymphocytes 
and IL-2 after non-myeloablative chemotherapy24. This patient received 1010CAR transduced 
cells, and shortly after infusion experienced shortness of breath, hypotension and required admission to the ICU, vasopressor support and intubation for respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399]. She deteriorated 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_839125] a nd kidney failure, expi[INVESTIGATOR_839126] 5 days of 
receiving the cells. The specific cause of death was determined to be gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the setting of systemic microangiopathic injury, but this was felt to be secondary to the 
cytokine release syndrome. Current concepts hold that this toxicity was likely primarily related 
to the dose of cells administered and IL-2 administration after infusion.  
A second reported death occurred at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in a phase I study 
in which anti-CD19 CAR T lymphocytes (autologous 19-28z+ T cells) were administered
48.
Three patients with B cell lymphomas received a single dose of 3 X 107/kg modified T cells 
without significant toxicity, with 2 of 3 patients experiencing transient reduction in peripheral 
lymphadenopathy. The fourth patient with  chronic lymphocytic leukemia received 
cyclophosphamide (1500 mg/m2) prior to cell infusion, and six hours later experienced fever, 
hypotension, dyspnea, and renal failure. Thirty hours later, the patient  required intubation and 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_839127]. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies revealed significant numbers of 19-28z+ T cells in the bone marrow, spleen, liver and 
lymph nodes. Serum cytokine analyses in patient [ADDRESS_1165962] 3 patients 
enrolled. Intense analysis determined the outcome was in large part mediated by 
[CONTACT_839163] ‘cytokine storm’ in a setting of preexisting subclinical infection, 
leading to a sepsis-like scenario and which likely enhanced the modified T cell in vivo 
activation. The investigators feel that these findings underscore the potency of adoptively transferred genetically modified T cells.
Two additional deaths in adults were reported at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in 
April 2014.  Specifics have not yet been published in the medical literature but initial indications 
are that one had intractable seizures and the other developed cardiotoxicity both at least possibly related to CAR T cells.  We have not seen any seizure activity in any of our patients, though this 
will be a risk especially in patients with CNS leukemia.  We will therefore prophylactically start CNS leukemia patients on an anti-epi[INVESTIGATOR_7377].  
One patient on our trial had cardiac arrest dr iven by [CONTACT_839164].  This patient was hypotensive but stable on multiple vasopressors for several days 
before acutely decompensating.  Immediate change s to this protocol were implemented at that 
time aimed at better monitoring and intervening earlier in severe CRS.  The current version incorporates a new CRS grading system that tolerates low-dose vasopressor support but calls for 
anti-cytokine therapy(ies) such as tocilizumab or corticosteroids for patients requiring more 
aggressive intervention or grade [ADDRESS_1165963] had complete responses and that 
all of these (except 1 who had grade 3 CRS driven by [CONTACT_839165]) had high 
21
Abbreviated Title: Phase I Anti-CD 19 CAR
Version Date: 01/12/[ADDRESS_1165964] of achieving 
a CR.  
Based on these reports, serum cytokine levels, including IFN- Ȗ,/ -2, IL-6, GM-CSF and TNF D,
will be assayed serially (0, 1, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 hours, then daily until day 14 and on day 28 
and in the case of symptoms consistent with cytokine storm, levels will be monitored) following 
infusion of anti-CD19-CAR T cells. The results of the assays will not be available in real time 
but if toxicity is observed following infusion, review of the cytokine levels will be undertaken to 
assess risk to subsequent patients. Cytokine levels will also be evaluated retrospectively for 
correlation with anti-tumor effects. In addition, subjects will be monitored closely after infusion 
of anti-CD19 CAR T cells, and if discharged prior to day 14, be required to return to clinic daily 
for evaluation. After day 14, subjects will return to clinic at least twice a week for up to [ADDRESS_1165965]-infusion to assess later cognitive effects.
[IP_ADDRESS] Risk of Cardiac DysfunctionCardiovascular dysfunction is a significant and yet incompletely defined aspect of CRS. The 
hemodynamic abnormalities associated with CRS can range from tachycardia to life-threatening 
hypotension. A recent trial of anti-CD19 CAR T cells documented shock requiring vasoactive 
infusion in 13.6% of participants
51. Since the current treatment of CRS involves tocilizumab and 
corticosteroids, which can be cytotoxic to the infused therapeutic T cells, it is important to define the cardiovascular dysfunction associated with CRS in an effort guide therapy and ultimately 
define patients at high risk for cardiac sequela. Thus, the one of the secondary objectives is to 
define anti-CD19 CAR T cell immunotherapy related cardiac dysfunction. We will evaluate traditional cardiac biomarkers pre- and post-infusion of anti-CD19 CAR T cells in the study 
population. In addition, we will evaluate echocardiograms performed pre- and post-infusion to 
directly assess both systolic and diastolic function using 2-D and strain imaging. Strain 
echocardiography is a sensitive technique for myocardial function assessment and is well 
validated in detecting subclinical chemotherapy mediated cardiac toxicity
52. Strain 
echocardiography is utilized to monitor patients undergoing chemotherapy since changes in myocardial strain during therapy predict progression to overt heart failure
52. We will 
retrospectively combine cardiac biomarkers, 2-D and strain echocardiography with clinical parameters in an effort to define anti-CD19 CAR T cell mediated CRS cardiac dysfunction and 
evaluate if certain variables can be utilized to predict the severity of the syndrome in affected 
patients.

The persistence of minimal residual disease is a p oor prognostic factor in pediatric patients with 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Recent use of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) has shown that 
MRD testing using this technique is more sensitive at detecting low levels of leukemia in patient 
samples, as compared to the gold standards of multi-channel flow cytometry (MFC) or allele-
specific oligonucleotide (ASO) PCR amplification53. Flow cytometry typi[INVESTIGATOR_839128] [ADDRESS_1165967] 
monitoring using next generation sequencing (NGS ) to determine if this provides a more precise 
way of detecting low levels of leukemia (on the order of 1 cell in 106) that could be used predictively for relapse
54-56. Adding this testing to our current CD2219 protocol can yield 
information on very low levels of MRD in our patients, and help us retrospectively analyze data acquired for these patients after CAR therapy. As many of the patients treated on this study 
proceeded to transplant, it would be useful to know what depth of remission could be attained 
with use of CAR therapy as a bridge to transplant. This information is extremely important to the field of CAR therapy and transplantation. These studies will be performed using samples already 
collected.

high fever and chills but remained hemodynamically stable.  The symptoms resolved within 12 
hours with only supportive care.  
The MTD was therefore defined as 1 x 106CAR+ T cells/kg (dose level 1) and that dose was 
expanded.  Two additional grade 3 and two additional grade 4 CRS were encountered in the 
subsequent 10 patients enrolled in the dose expansion phase.  
The feasibility was established in this patient population.  All patient s underwent apheresis and 
T-cell collection without difficulty. Cell therapy products met the criteria for release prior to 
administration in 18 of the 20 patients. Two subjects had low cell counts, which did not meet release criteria. 
Secondary aims include determining the persis tence of infused cells and evaluating in a 
preliminary fashion, the clinical activity of this regimen.

ROTOCOL STATUS SUMMARY AND AMENDMENT JUSTIFICATION
1.5.1 Protocol Status
In total 53 subjects were enrolled (51 with ALL, 2 with DLBCL) on 12-C-0112. This study has 
since closed to enrollment but remains open for data analysis. The overall response rate for those 
with ALL was 62% (n=31). One of the two patie nts with DLBCL had an FDG-PET response but 
it did not meet criteria for PR due to insuffici ent shrinkage of tumor size. Thirty-one patients 
(62%) have had complete responses (CR) and 28 of these were minimal residual disease (MRD) 
negative CRs.  Twenty-two of these patients have since gone on to receive a potentially curative

hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.  As previously noted cytokine release syndrome (CRS) 
was the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) establishing MTD.
1.5.2 Rationale for Amendment FBased upon the severity of CRS observed in patient #14, additional monitoring and early CRS 
intervention was discussed with the FDA.  Th e early treatment for CRS will include specific 
clinical signs and symptoms that will trigger administration of anti-IL6R moAb therapy 
(tocilizumab) and/or other pharmacologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_839129] (Enbrel) or IV steroids.
1.5.3 Rationale for Amendment G
Based on the relationship observed between the incidence of Grade 3-4 CRS and patients with 
high-disease burden, additional investigation is warranted to determine if reduction of disease 
burden prior to administration of the anti-CD19 CAR will decrease the incidence of severe CRS, 
while using an updated assessment/treatment algorithm for CRS. During the phase 1 dose

It is also important to note that when the toxicity and response was correlated with the patients 
who had peripheral blood blasts during eligibility screening, 15/18 patients with ALL had blasts 
in peripheral blood detected by [CONTACT_4133].   This measure of peripheral blood blasts was 
therefore not a good indicator of who would experience severe CRS.  Rather, four (4) patients had blasts in peripheral blood detected on routine CBC.  Three of these did not have severe CRS 
or respond.  The one that did respond (#14) had cardiac arrest.  Further, of the 5 non-responders 
who were infused with adequate cell dose, 3 had blasts on CBC at e ligibility screening.  
Therefore, for purposes of this study, high-burden disease (Arm 2) will be defined as M3 bone 
marrow blasts and/or presence of peripheral blood blasts on routine CBC.

3 STUDY IMPLEMENTATION
3.1 S TUDY DESIGN
This is a phase I safety/feasibility study in pediatric and young adult patients with CD19-
expressing B cell ALL or lymphoma who have relapsed or refractory disease after at least one 
standard chemotherapy and one salvage regimen. All patients enrolled on this trial have been 
deemed incurable by [CONTACT_83925][INVESTIGATOR_014]. Auto logous PBMC will be obtained by [CONTACT_839168]-CD19-CAR retroviral vector. 
30
Abbreviated Title: Phase I Anti-CD 19 CAR
Version Date: 01/12/2018
Patients will be enrolled into one of two arms:
Arm 1: Patients without high-burden of disease or patients requiring the 
cyclophosphamide/fludarabine preparative regimen for safety concerns; 
Arm 2:  Patients with high-burden of disease (defined as patients with ALL who have M3 
bone marrow blasts and/or presence of peripheral blood blasts on routine CBC, or 
patients with lymphoma).
All eligible patients will undergo apheresis and anti-CD19 CAR T cells will be manufactured 
from fresh or frozen PBMCs.  PBMCs previously collected by [CONTACT_839169] a hematopoietic stem cell transplant between the time of 
PBMC collection and enrollment on this protocol. PBMCs collected by [CONTACT_839170].
Patients in Arm [ADDRESS_1165981] dose of chemotherapy (excluding IT chemotherapy) and administration of the anti-CD19 CAR T cells.
CAR T cells will be cryopreserved on day 7 of culture unless the target dose has not been 
reached or to accommodate scheduling purposes.  In this case, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_839134].  If not, cells will 
be cryopreserved despi[INVESTIGATOR_839135].  If cells are deemed likely to expand further, the culture time may be extended up to 14 
days total.  All patients will receive anti-CD19 CAR T cells no sooner than 10 days after culture initiation (at least [ADDRESS_1165982] dose of chemotherapy).  Patients will be evaluated after 
treatment for toxicity, antitumor effects and for persistence and functionality of transduced T 
cells.  Toxicity assessment of neurologic symptoms will include cognitive confusion, visual 
hallucinations, and lack of responsiveness to commands.  In addition, this study will evaluate the 
cognitive status of patients prior to receiving their CD19 infusion and again after the infusion to assess possible changes related to this treatment.
3.[ADDRESS_1165983] dose in the Department of Transfusion Medicine (DTM). A target cell number 
extrapolated based upon the expected expansion and planned cell dose of transduced T cells/kg 
will be collected. Citrate anticoagulant will be used in subjects greater than [ADDRESS_1165984] operatin g procedure. Bilateral

peripheral venous access will be used whenever possible. Alternatively, a temporary central 
venous catheter may be placed for collection and supportive care should significant toxicity 
occur. The CVL will be inserted by [CONTACT_839171]. Fo r patients weighing between 15 and 25 kg, red blood 
cell priming may be used to prevent dilutional anemia and increase the collection efficiency. The decision will be made on a case-by-case basis after discussion between the primary investigator, pediatric medical care, and DTM teams, and the patient’s parent.
3.3 C
ELL PROCESSING
Fresh or cryopreserved PBMCs will be prepared on approximately Day -11.  CD3+ cells will be 
enriched using anti-CD3/anti-CD28 beads and cultured in the presence of IL-2 in order to 
stimulate T-cell growth. After two days of stimulation T cells will be transduced by [CONTACT_839172]-CD19 CAR retroviral vector in bags coated with RetroNectin® 
(Takara Biomedicals, Japan) to facilitate the interaction between the viral particles and the 
activated cells. Expansion of these transduced cells will be supported with IL-2. CD19-CAR 
transduction efficiency will be determined by [CONTACT_839173]-idiotype 
monoclonal antibody. Successful CAR gene transfer for each transduced PBL population will be 
defined as >15% CAR positive cells. 
In some patients, the peripheral blood might be contaminated with large numbers of CD19-
expressing malignant cells. However, the anti-CD3/anti-CD28 magnetic beads will provide a 
selection step for the non-leukemic T cell population. Further, ALL blasts are not likely to 
survive ex vivo under these culture conditions a nd culture duration and w ill not be expanded by 
[CONTACT_16682]-CD3/CD28 stimulation. This was evident in the results of the validation run using cells from a patient with CLL. In previous testing performed for this study, the CD19 expressing malignant cell results was 0. 
The release criteria will be based upon analyses for each dose of anti-CD19 CAR retroviral-
transduced autologous PBL and will include:

Given the correlation in the original 20 patients treated on this study between the incidence of 
severe CRS and amount of disease burden, patients with high-burden disease (Arm 2: M3 bone 
marrow blasts and/or presence of peripheral blood blasts on routine CBC) will receive standard 
of care chemotherapy as described in Section 3.9.
Patients in Arm 1 will receive fludarabine/cyclophosphamide preparative regimen on Days -4through -2.
3.[ADDRESS_1165986] may receive them up to 21 days 
from the planned infusion date, and be considered evaluable. If the patient is able to receive cells 
within 21 days of the planned original dose on Day 0, administration should follow the procedure 
as outlined in Section 3.10 and the patient will remain evaluable for toxicity and efficacy.  
Alternatively, if > [ADDRESS_1165987] has the option of receiving the cells on at a later point once the condition has resolved, but these patients will be 
replaced on study and not considered evaluable for toxicity or response endpoints. Clinical 
response in these patients will be analyzed and may be reported descriptively.
3.6 T
REATMENT LIMITING TOXICITY
Adverse events that are considered disease-related (not suspected of relationship to anti-CD19-
CAR T cells) will not be considered treatment-limiting toxicities. Only those AEs suspected to 
be related to pre-infusion chemotherapy and/or anti-CD19-CAR T cells (any component of the 
treatment regimen) will be used in the definition of TLT. Toxicities occurring after initiation of 
the chemotherapy preparative regimen but prior to anti-CD19 CAR cell infusion, will primarily 
be attributable to the chemotherapy administration or disease, if not extraneous causes. After cell 
infusion, toxicities will be evaluated for temporal and causal relationship to chemotherapy versus 
cell infusion. Some symptoms may overlap and attribution will not be clearly definable, in which 
case, toxicities will be attributed as possibly related to both chemotherapy and cell infusion. 
33
Abbreviated Title: Phase I Anti-CD 19 CAR
Version Date: 01/12/2018
Toxicities will be attributed to the T cells if: 1) they were NOT present before T cell infusion; 
OR 2) they increase in Grade in temporal association with the T cell infusion; AND 3) they are not clearly explained by [CONTACT_1604].
Patients who are fully assessable are those that have completed the chemotherapy regimen and 
received the anti-CD19 CAR T cell infusion. Chemotherapy-related toxicities experienced by 
[CONTACT_839174]-CD19 CAR T cells (See Section 8.3for the definition of 
inevaluable patients) will be considered in the definition of TLT. 
See Section 7.1Causality for definitions of ‘suspected’. The definition of TLT in these studies 
uses NCI’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAEv4.0).

3.6.2 Maximal Tolerated Dose (MTD) ( COMPLETED 6-14 )
The MTD is a dose level immediately below the level at which the enrollment is stopped for a 
stratum due to a DLT, as explained specifically below:
xIf more than one subject in the first three subjects included in a dose level experience 
DLT as defined above, MTD will have been exceeded.
xIf DLT develops in one of the 3 subjects included in a cohort, the cohort will be then 
expanded up to six:
If [ADDRESS_1165992] patient at this dose level.
If MTD is exceeded at any dose level, three subjects will be added to the immediate lower dose 
level, unless it has been previously expanded to si x. If less than 2 of 6 subjects develop DLT at
that level, it will be defined as the MTD.
3.7 D OSE ESCALATION (COMPLETED 6-14)
Cell dose will be body weight-based. In patients with BMI equal to or less than 30, the dose of 
anti-CD19-transduced T cells for each cohort will be based on doses calculated using actual body 
35
Abbreviated Title: Phase I Anti-CD 19 CAR
Version Date: 01/12/[ADDRESS_1165993] doses calculated using ideal body weight 
(IBW) plus 50% of the difference between actual weight and IBW (see Appendix D for 
calculation).
There will be a Phase I dose-escalation design in two strata with three dose cohorts. One stratum 
will enroll subjects who have previously undergone allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT), and 
the other stratum will include subjects who have not undergone SCT. The number of anti-CD19-
CAR transduced T cells transferred for each dose level cohort will be:
Dose Escalation Schedule
Dose Level Dose of anti-CD19-CAR transduced T cells
Cohort Level 1 1 x 106transduced T cells/kg (± 20%)
Cohort Level 2 3 x 106transduced T cells/kg (± 20%)
Cohort Level 3 1 x 107transduced T cells/kg (± 20%)
Each dose cohort will initially include a minimum of 3 patients. Patients per stratum will initially 
be enrolled sequentially. A two week (14 days) safety assessment period will follow regimen 
completion (defined as infusion of anti-CD19 CAR cells) of the first patient in each cohort. 
Subsequent patients in that cohort may be enrolle d after a one week (7 day) safety assessment 
period. Four weeks must elapse after completion of cell infusion in the final patient in a cohort to 
allow for safety assessment before accruing patients to the next dose cohort level. Therefore, 
enrollment will not proceed to a higher dose level until all patients have been treated in the prior 
cohort and the last patient treated on the completed cohort has been observed for at least [ADDRESS_1165994] continue enrollment until 3 patients complete therapy without DLT 
prior to dose escalation. 
If cell growth limitations preclude administration of the number of cells targeted for the assigned 
cohort level, the patient will receive as many cells as possible and the patient will be enrolled in 
the appropriate cohort for the number of cells infused, allowing for an additional three patients to 
be enrolled per cohort due to cell growth limitations. If a DLT occurs in an additional patient 
entered at a lower dose due to cell growth limitations, accrual will continue at the previously 
planned dose level for subs equent patients. If a minimum of 1x105/kg anti-CD19-CAR-
transduced T cells cannot be obtained for infusion, the patient will still receive the cell infusion, 
as the effective dose of cells is not well defined, and the patient will be evaluable for feasibility 
but not analyzed for MTD, although toxicities will be assessed and reported separately. If the 
third dose level in each stratum is completed w ithout DLT, an MTD may not be determined. This 
will be considered the ‘highest cell dose’ studied, and will be the dose level that will be studied 
further in the expansion cohort. Alternatively, if no toxicity or clinical activity is observed after 
36
Abbreviated Title: Phase I Anti-CD 19 CAR
Version Date: 01/12/[ADDRESS_1165995] dose cohort, consideration may be given to adding additional dose cohorts 
in a protocol amendment. 
Dose escalation will follow the rules outlined in the Table below.
3.8 D OSE EXPANSION COHORT (COMPELTED 6-14)
To gain further experience with the safety, feasibility and clinical activity of the anti-CD19 CAR 
T cells in this patient population, the MTD (or highest cell dose studied) will be expanded to a
total of 15 patients (i.e., 9 additional patients at the MTD). If the MTD or highest cell dose 
studied is the same for both strata (prior SCT vs. NO prior SCT) one expansion cohort will be 
studied and efforts will be made to include a balance of patients with prior SCT, without prior Number of Patients with DLT

4 CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS/MEASURES
Concomitant medications to control side effects of therapy will be given. Patients who require 
transfusions will receive irradiated blood products. Serotonin antagonists may be administered 
for nausea and vomiting as prophylaxis prior to chemotherapy and as needed. Additional 
antiemetics will be administered as needed for nausea and vomiting uncontrolled by [CONTACT_839185]. Antibiotic coverage for antimicrobial  prophylaxis and central venous catheters may 
be provided at the discretion of the investigator. If patients require steroid therapy beyond physiologic replacement and for purposes other than to control CRS they will be taken off 
treatment.

the patient is suspected to have progressive dis ease and IT chemotherapy is needed to reduce the 
risk of seeding the CSF with leukemia from the diagnostic procedure. Subsequent intrathecal 
therapy will be given no more frequently than monthly unless CNS leukemia involvement is 
confirmed. Further, intrathecal chemotherapy will NOT be administered in any patient who 
develops CNS toxicity related to CAR T cells until at least 2 weeks after complete resolution of neurologic toxicity.

4.1.3 Administration
Delivery should be isovolumetric (ml CSF out = ml drug in) via lumbar puncture (LP) in the 
lateral decubitus position. Patients should remain in prone or Trendelburg position for [ADDRESS_1166027] LP to facilitate drug circulation throughout the CNS.
Leucovorin will be given as 10 mg/m2/dose (rounded up to the nearest 5 mg increment to a 
maximum dose of 15 mg) PO or IV x 2 doses, 24 hours and 30 hours after intrathecal 
methotrexate.
4.2 I
NFECTION PROPHYLAXIS
Dosing of pediatric patients for infection prophylaxis will be in accordance with NIH Clinical 
Center Blood & Marrow Transplant Consortium guidelines (http://intranet.cc.nih.gov/bmt/clinicalcare/guidelines.shtml ).
Special Statement about IVIG: Since anti-CD19-CAR T cells have been demonstrated in other 
studies to also eliminate normal B cells, serum IgG levels will be monitored before cell infusion 
and every 3-6 weeks after infusion. If IgG < 500, IVIG will be administered at a dose of 500 
mg/kg with the appropriate pre-medications and per institutional guidelines unless clinically 
contraindicated.
4.[ADDRESS_1166028] risk are those with high disease burden (e.g. bulky disease) and high 
cell turnover (e.g. elevated uric acid, LDH).
4.3.1 Regimen Subjects deemed to be at high risk of tumor lysis syndrome should begin allopurinol at a dose of 
approximately 100 mg/m

51
Abbreviated Title: Phase I Anti-CD 19 CAR
Version Date: 01/12/[ADDRESS_1166029] dose of the pr eparative regimen and continued until disease burden 
is reduced (e.g. peripheral blasts clear) or it is  apparent that no tumor lysis has developed.
Additional suggested monitoring and supportive care for subjects deemed to be at high risk of 
tumor lysis syndrome: 
xHydration: Starting at least [ADDRESS_1166030] 24 hours after cell infusion, IV fluids should be administered at a rate of 90-
120 ml/m2/hour (1.5 – 2 times maintenance) to maintain urine specific gravity <1.010 
and normal urine output. Potassium should be  avoided. Then IV+PO should continue at 
90/m2/hour (1.5 times maintenance) until disease burden is reduced (e.g. peripheral blasts 
clear) or it is apparent that no tumor ly sis has developed after at least [ADDRESS_1166031] Support
Using daily CBC’s as a guide, the patient will receive platelets and packed red blood cells 
(PRBC’s) as needed. Attempts will be made to keep Hb >8.0 gm/dl, and plts >10,000/mm3. All 
blood products with the exception of the lymphocyte product will be irradiated. Leukocyte filters will be utilized for all blood and platelet transfusions to decrease sensitization to transfused WBC’s and decrease the risk of CMV infection.
4.3.[ADDRESS_1166032] dose of fludarabine. 
4.3.4 Treatment of Cytokine Storm
Cytokine storm should be monitored closely according to the algorithm detailed in Appendix F .
If treatment is indicated according to the algorithm it should be initiated with tocilizumb (anti-
IL6R mAb) with other measures including corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive mAbs 
initiated at the discretion of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or his designee.

ORRELATIVE STUDIES FOR RESEARCH /PHARMACOKINETIC STUDIES
5.1.[ADDRESS_1166033] cell infusion evaluations for T-cell persistence:
Samples will be drawn as outlined in Appendix E and Section 3.12 for evaluation of CAR-T cell 
persistence.
5.1.2 Immunological TestingWhen appropriate, apheresis will be performed or the maximum amount of blood allowed to be 
drawn in a single day based on the patient’s weight will be obtained and PBMC will be isolated 
through whole blood by [CONTACT_74899] a Ficoll cushion. Aliquots of these PBMC will be:

Abbreviated Title: Phase I Anti-CD 19 CAR
Version Date: 01/12/[ADDRESS_1166034] of quantifying CD3+ T cells that express the anti-CD19 CAR by 
[CONTACT_839186]-idiotype antibody to the CAR. Site density of the CD19 antigen will be quantified on any blasts present using flow cytometry techniques. 
5.1.3 Monitoring Gene Therapy Trials: Persistence and RCR
a. Immunological monitoring using both anti-idiotype antibody staining to detect CARs on 
the surface of T cells and CD19-specific cytokine production to detect functional anti-
CD19 T cells will be used to quantitate persistence of T cells in the blood. Persistence 
will be determined at about Day 1, 7, 14, and 28 after cell infusion, then monthly (+/- 7
days) for 2-3 additional months, and then every 3-6 months thereafter until no CAR T 
cells are detected. In addition, CAR-transduced T cell might be quantitated by [CONTACT_839187] T-cell.
b. Patients’ blood samples will be  obtained and undergo analysis for detection of RCR by 
[CONTACT_839188] (at baseline) and at 3, 6, and [ADDRESS_1166035] by [CONTACT_839189]. The results of these tests are maintained by [CONTACT_839190].
c. Due to the nature of these studies, it is possible that expansion of specific T-cell clones 
will be observed as tumor reactive T-cells proliferate in response to tumor antigens. 
Therefore, care will be taken to track T-cell persistence both immunologically and 
molecularly. Blood samples (5-10 mL) for persistence of CAR transduced cells will be 
obtained prior to cell infusion (baseline), at 1, 7, 14, and 28 days (+/- 4 days), then so 
long as a response continues to be demonstrated, every month (+/- 7 days) for 2-3 months 
then every 3-6 months until off-study criteria are met. If any patient has more than 5% 
persistence of CAR gene transduced cells at month 6 (by [CONTACT_14181]-idiotype antibody staining) 
the previously archived samples will be subjected to techniques that would allow the 
identification of clonality of persisting CAR gene transduced cells. Such techniques may 
include T cell cloning or LAM-PCR. If a predominant or monoclonal T cell clone derived 
from CAR gene transduced cells is identified during the follow-up, the integration site 
and sequence will be identified and subsequently analyzed against human genome 
database to determine whether the sequences are associated with any known human 
cancers. If a predominant integration site is observed, the T cell cloning or LAM-PCR 
test will be used at an interval of no more than three months after the first observation to 
see if the clone persists or is transient. In all instances where monoclonality is persistent 
53
Abbreviated Title: Phase I Anti-CD 19 CAR
Version Date: 01/12/[ADDRESS_1166036] 
should be monitored closely for signs of malignancy, so that treatment, if available, may 
be initiated early.
5.1.4 Minimal Residual Disease (Leukemic Cells)  
Patients who are anticipated to be MRD negative by [CONTACT_4133], may have one additional 
sample collected at the time of disease evaluation (5 mL of blood or 2 mL of bone marrow in 
EDTA tube) to evaluate MRD.  Samples will be sent immediately to the laboratory where DNA 
will be extracted and sent to Adaptive Biotechnology Corporation in Seattle where next 
generation DNA sequencing will be used to identify residual leukemia.  Clinical parameters 
considered when selecting patients for sample submission include clinical course (i.e. presence 
of cytokine storm), decrease in circulating blasts (if any) or B-cells, or presence of CAR T cells by [CONTACT_839191] (as described in Immunologic Testing). 
As of Amendment P, all patients who attained flow cytometric MRD negativity following CAR 
infusion will have their samples sent (de-identified and only if available) to Adaptive to evaluate 
for MRD using next generation DNA se quencing to identify residual leukemia.
5.1.[ADDRESS_1166037] may be banked and used in the future to investigate new scientific questions related to 
this study. However, this research may only be done if the risks of the new questions were 
covered in the consent document. If new risks are associated with the research (e.g., analysis of 
germ line genetic mutations) the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_839138]. Any new use of samples will require prospective 
IRB review and approval.
5.1.6 Minimal Residual Disease Detection  DNA samples from blood and/or bone marrow will be stripped of identifiers and coded, and may 
be sent to Adaptive Biotechnology Corporation in Seattle where next generation DNA 
sequencing will be used to identify residual leukemia.
[IP_ADDRESS] T-cell Analysis Samples of blood and/or bone marrow stripped of identifiers and coded, may be sent to Adaptive 
Biotechnology Corporation in Seattle.  T cells will be analyzed for clonality by [CONTACT_839192] T 
cell receptors.

are documented in a secure central computer database with identification and storage location, 
with computer backup according to established standards for the Central Repository for 
NCI/Frederick.
At the completion of this protocol, samples will be stored for future use under a repository
protocol.  Any new use of samples will require an IRB approved protocol or approval of an 
exemption from IRB review. Otherwise, specimens will be disposed of in accordance with the 
environmental protection laws, regulations and guidelines of the Federal Government and the State of Maryland.
Any new uses of samples collected during the course of this trial must be reviewed and approved 
by [CONTACT_477336]. Any loss or unintentional destruction of the samples will be reported to the IRB.
5.2.1 Pediatric Research Samples 
Research blood sample aliquot size will be minimized for patients < 18 years of age and the total 
amount restricted to a maximum of 3 ml/kg per draw and 7 ml/kg per 6-week period (maximum 
450 ml). In the event that blood draws are limited due to patient size, research studies will be 
performed in order of priority as listed in Appendix E . Small volume apheresis collections will 
not be included in this calculation since such is performed isovolumetrically with minimal red 
cell loss.

ERSISTENCE CRITERIA FOR ANTI-CD19 CAR T RANSDUCED TC ELLS
The absolute number of persisting anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cells will be calculated by 
[CONTACT_330425] (PBL) count by [CONTACT_839195]3 and the anti-CD19 CAR. The percentage of PBL that express both CD3 and 
the anti-CD19 CAR will be determined by a flow cytometry assay that involves staining with 
anti-CD3 and anti-idiotype antibody that is specific for the scFv on the extracellular portion of the anti-CD19 CAR. 
This analysis will be performed on Days 1, 7, 14, and 28 (+/- 4 days) then, so long as the patient 
continues to have a response or achieve CR, monthly (+/- 7 days) for 2-3 additional months then 
every 3-6 months after cell infusion. The 4 week time point is the only primary analysis that will be used for the primary evaluation of the number of CD3+ cells that express the anti-CD19 CAR.

example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally 
associated with the subject’s participation in research, whether or not considered related to the subject’s participation in the research.
7.1.2 Suspected adverse reaction
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility
that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable 
possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the 
adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.
7.1.3 Unexpected adverse reaction
59
Abbreviated Title: Phase I Anti-CD 19 CAR
Version Date: 01/12/2018
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in 
the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, 
if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information 
described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application. 
"Unexpected” also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in 
the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the 
pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the 
particular drug under investigation.
7.1.4 Serious An Unanticipated Problem or Protocol Deviation is serious if it meets the definition of a Serious 
Adverse Event or if it compromises the safety, welfare or rights of subjects or others.
7.1.5 Serious Adverse Event
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if in the view of the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following:
xDeath,
xA life-threatening adverse drug experience
xInpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_839142]/birth defect.
xImportant medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.
7.1.6 Disability
A substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.
7.1.[ADDRESS_1166044] caused death.
7.1.8 Protocol Deviation (NIH Definition)
Any change, divergence, or departure from the IRB-approved research protocol.
7.1.9 Non-compliance (NIH Definition)The failure to comply with applicable NIH Human Research Protections Program (HRPP)
policies, IRB requirements, or regulatory requirements for the protection of human research 
subjects.

7.5.2 Sponsor Monitoring Plan
63
Abbreviated Title: Phase I Anti-CD 19 CAR
Version Date: 01/12/2018
As a sponsor for clinical trials, FDA regulations require the CCR to maintain a monitoring 
program. The CCR’s program allows for confirmation of: study data, specifically data that could 
affect the interpretation of primary study endpoint s; adherence to the protocol, regulations, and 
SOPs; and human subjects’ protection. This is do ne through independent verification of study 
data with source documentation focusing on:
xInformed consent process
xEligibility confirmation
xDrug administration and accountability
xAdverse events monitoring
xResponse assessment.
The monitoring program also extends to multi-site research when the CCR is the coordinating 
center.
This trial will be monitored by [CONTACT_839197]. Monitors are 
qualified by [CONTACT_12293]. Personnel monitoring this study will not be affiliated in any way with the trial conduct.
7.5.3 Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC)
This protocol will require oversight from the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC).  Initial 
review will occur as soon as possible after the annual NCI-IRB continuing review date.   
Subsequently, each protocol will be reviewed as close to annually as the quarterly meeting 
schedule permits or more frequently as may be re quired by [CONTACT_4484].   For initial and subsequent 
reviews, protocols will not be reviewed if there is no accrual within the review period. Written 
outcome letters will be generated in response to the monitoring activities and submitted to the Principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_74837], CCR, NCI.

summary or analyses.
Descriptive summary statistics include the number of subjects, mean, median, percent coefficient 
of variation (%CV) (if required), standard deviation, and minimum and maximum values 
(quantitative variables) or the number of subjects and percentages by [CONTACT_17203] (qualitative variables). Changes will be assessed as the difference between the baseline measurement and the 
appropriate post-cell infusion measurement unless otherwise specified. Baseline is defined as the 
last non-missing value prior to initiation of preparative regimen except for cytokine analyses 
where baseline is defined as the last non missing value prior to cell infusion. Individual subject 
listings of data will also be provided to allow for review of all safety parameters.

difference between actual weight and IBW (see Appendix D ).
In order to determine if there are differences in safety or feasibility related to manufacturing or 
administering anti-CD19 CAR T cells after a nonmyeloablative preparative regimen in children 
and young adults who have not undergone prior a llogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) versus 
those that have previously undergone SCT, the enrollment will be stratified for these two groups 
of subjects. For each stratum of patients, the number of anti-CD19 transduced T cells 
administered in each cohort will be:
xCohort 1 1 x 106transduced T cells/kg (± 20%)
xCohort 2 3 x 106transduced T cells/kg (± 20%)
xCohort 3 1 x 107transduced T cells/kg (± 20%)
Doses of anti-CD19-CAR transduced T-cells will be administered in a standard 3 + [ADDRESS_1166051] patient in a cohort there 
will be a two week (14 day) safety assessment prior to enrollment of the 2nd patient in each 
cohort. Subsequent patients in that cohort may be enrolled after a one week safety assessment 
period following cell infusion. Patients will be enrolled sequentially; therefore, enrollment will 
not proceed to a higher dose level until all patients have been treated in the prior cohort and the 
last patient treated on the completed cohort has been observed for at least [ADDRESS_1166052] continue enrollment until 3 patients complete therapy without DLT 
prior to dose escalation. COMPLETED
To gain further experience with the safety, feasibility and clinical activity of the anti-CD19 CAR 
T cells in this patient population, the MTD (or highest cell dose studied) will be expanded to [ADDRESS_1166053] cell dose studied is the same for both strata (prior SCT vs. NO

8.3 S AFETY AND FEASIBILITY OF HIGH-DISEASE BURDEN VS .NON-HIGH-DISEASE BURDEN
Given the impressive response to this therapy, Amendment G allows us to explore further the 
study findings.  Based on the relationship observed between the incidence of Grade 3-4 CRS and 
patients with high-disease burden, additional inves tigation is warranted to determine if reduction 
of disease burden prior to administration of the anti-CD19 CAR will decrease the incidence of severe CRS, while using an updated assessment/treatment algorithm for CRS.  Amendment G 
will allow us to evaluate a safe option for bringing this therapy to patients with high-burden of 
disease.  For purposes of this study, high-burden disease will be defined as M3 bone marrow 
blasts and/or presence of peripheral blood blasts on routine CBC.  We will therefore explore the 
safety and feasibility of this therapy in two groups of patients:
1. Arm 1 = Patients without high-burden disease, or who due to safety concerns require the 
cyclophosphamide/fludarabine preparative regimen 
2. Arm 2 = Patients with high-burden disease
Thirty patients are to be enrolled in arm [ADDRESS_1166054] 10 who experience 
a grade 4 CRS then no further patients may be accrued.  If accrual beyond the initial 10 is 
permitted, then this will continue to be the case provided that the cumulative percentage of 
patients with grade 4 CRS on both arms combined is below 20%; realizing 20% or more with 
grade 4 CRS at any time would require ending accrual and amending the study to reconsider 
toxicity definitions (since they are newly implemented and not fully vetted) or revise the 
treatment regimen. The upper one sided 90% CI on 2/10 is 45.0% which would indicate possible 
consistency with a very high rate of grade 4 CRS.  Provided that these interim toxicity limits are 
not met, accrual will be permitted until 60 total patients are enrolled, 30 per arm and the overall 
fraction with grade 4 CRS will be determined. As illustrations, if 6/[ADDRESS_1166055] grade 4 CRS, the 
upper one-sided 90% CI bound on this fraction is 16.9% and if the fraction ends up being as high 
as 20% at the end of 60 patients, e.g. 12/60 with grade 4 CRS, the upper 90% one-sided 
confidence bound is 28.2%.
8.3.2 Arm 2 Feasibility  In addition to safety, establishing feasibility of administering the anti-CD19 CAR T cells within 
21 days of the planned infusion is an important goal of this study. Feasibility will be assessed 
only in Arm 2 and defined by [CONTACT_839198], expansion, and administration 
(within 21 days of the planned infusion date) of the anti-CD19 CAR T cells to satisfy the dose level and meet the requirements of the COA.  Unless there is excessive toxicity, enroll 30 
evaluable patients on arm 2 over a period of approximately 3 years. If there are 22 or more 
patients among 30 who are able to fully receive therapy, then the probability this would be the 
case is 87.1% if the true rate of feasibility were 80% while it is only 9.4% if the true rate of 
feasibility were 60%. Thus, obtaining 22 or more patients who are able to receive treatment out 
66
Abbreviated Title: Phase I Anti-CD 19 CAR
Version Date: 01/12/2018
of 30 would demonstrate a feasibility rate more consistent with 80% or greater as opposed to 
60% or less, and thus this would be a reasonable goal.
8.4 A CCRUAL TARGET AND STUDY DURATION
Twenty subjects were enrolled to achieve MTD and expanded cohorts in the initial objectives of 
this study.  To complete Arm 1 and 2 primary objectives added in Amendment G, up to 30 
subjects will be enrolled in each arm.  The study will allow for a small number of inevaluable 
patients of 5 in each arm (patients enrolled but w ho cannot receive cells, either due to physical 
deterioration or withdrawal of consent during cell growth, or inability to grow adequate cells).  Thus the maximum accrual will be 90 patients (20 previously treated + 30 in each arm [60 total] 
+ 5 inevaluable patients in each arm [10 total].  Up  to a total of 180 patients may be screened to 
allow for enrollment of up to 90 patients eligible to proceed to treatment.
8.5 F
EASIBILITY
In addition to safety, establishing feasibility of the creation of anti-CD19 CAR T cells within 21 
days of the planned infusion for patients (who have  had prior SCT or not) is an important goal of 
this study. Feasibility will be defined by [CONTACT_839199]-
CD19 CAR T cells to satisfy the targeted dose level and meet the requirements of the COA. If 
after the first [ADDRESS_1166056] adequate 
anti-CD19 CAR T cells produced (that meet COA for infusion), accrual to that stratum in the 
study will be terminated, since the upper 90% one-sided confidence interval about 3/6 is 79.9%; 
thus, it would be unlikely that the true feasibility rate is 80% or greater, which would be 
desirable. Each stratum will be evaluated independently for feasibility. COMPLETED
8.[ADDRESS_1166057] overall response will be assessed at end of study, based upon the disease assessments 
recorded during the study visits, and reported by [CONTACT_839200]/PR, 
unconfirmed CR/PR, Hematological Activity (ALL only), SD, or PD. The rate of relapse from 
CR prior to end of study will also be summarized by [CONTACT_839201]. The overall objective response rate (CR + PR) will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_42376]. The duration of objective response will be summarized for those 
subjects who achieve objective response (CR + PR). In subjects who have a confirmed response, 
duration of response will be calculated from the first date of documented response until 
progression. Unconfirmed CR or PR is defined as the first documentation of response. Overall 
survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) will be assessed by [CONTACT_42376]. Progression-
free survival (PFS) will be measured from the start of the preparative regimen until the 
documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Overall 
survival (OS) will be determined as the time from the start of the preparative regimen until death.
8.6.2 Persistence of CD19-CAR T Cell AnalysesPeripheral blood, bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337], and CSF will be collected and separately analyzed for 
the presence of anti-CD19 CAR T cells. The percentage of all CD3+ cells in a sample that are 
positive by [CONTACT_839202]-CD19 CAR containing T cells will be analyzed and reported as time from T cell infusion.

Version Date: 01/12/[ADDRESS_1166058] prior to 
cell infusion. Cytokine levels will also be analyzed in the context of clinical response.
8.6.4 Monitoring for CD19+ CellsPeripheral blood, bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026], and CSF will be collected and analyzed for the 
presence of CD19+ cells by [CONTACT_4133]. Any CD19+ cells will be analyzed to determine 
whether these are normal B cells or leukemia blasts. The percentage of CD19+ normal B cells 
and CD19+ leukemia blasts relative to total cells analyzed in the sample will be reported and 
analyzed in relation to time from cell infusion and compared to baseline. Baseline percentage of 
CD19+ normal B cells and CD19+ leukemia blasts will be defined as the result obtained from 
the same sample type (e.g. peripheral blood, CSF, or aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]) prior to cell infusion. 
8.6.[ADDRESS_1166059] of CAR cell therapy on cardiac function will be compared with baseline data.  
Changes in cardiac function will be correlated with levels of inflammatory markers and 
biomarkers.  Further analysis depends on the type of data obtained.
Data will be analyzed using SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC). Data will be expressed as mean (standard 
deviation).  In all analyses, the conventio QDOĮ -level of 0.[ADDRESS_1166060] therapy, and limited life expectancies. Su bjects from both genders and all racial/ethnic 
groups are eligible for this study if they meet the eligibility criteria. To date, there is no information that suggests that differences in drug metabolism or disease response would be 
expected in one group compared to another. Efforts will be made to extend accrual to a 
representative population, but in this preliminary study, a balance must be struck between patient 
safety considerations and limitations on the numbe r of individuals exposed to potentially toxic 
and/or ineffective treatments on the one hand a nd the need to explore gender and ethnic aspects 
68
Abbreviated Title: Phase I Anti-CD 19 CAR
Version Date: 01/12/2018
of clinical research on the other hand. If differences in outcome that correlate to gender or to 
ethnic identity are noted, accrual may be expanded or a follow-up study may be written to investigate those differences more fully.
9.2 P
ARTICIPATION OF CHILDREN
The age range of patients eligible for this trial is greater than 1 year of age but less than or equal 
to 30 years of age. Physicians, nurses, and multidisciplinary support teams of the POB, NCI and 
Clinical Center will provide patient care. The staff of the POB has expertise in the management 
of children with complex oncologic disorders and complications of therapy. Full pediatric 
support and subspecialty services are available at the NIH Clinical Center.
9.3 E VALUATION OF BENEFITS AND RISKS/DISCOMFORTS
The experimental treatment has a chance to prov ide clinical benefit though this is unknown. The 
risks in the investigational portion of this treatment are detailed in Section 1.2.5. The goal of this 
study is to improve upon the number of patients who may benefit from adoptive cell therapy by 
[CONTACT_330428]’ own transduced T-cells without the need to identify anti-tumor T-cells uniquely from each patient as was required in many cancer therapy protocols. The success of this effort 
cannot be predicted at this time. Because all patients in this protocol have B cell malignancies 
without curative options and limited life expectancies the potential benefit is thought to outweigh 
the potential risks. It is anticipated that this study will provide scientific information relevant to 
tumor immunotherapy. Consequently, participation of children involves greater than minimal 
risk, but presents the prospect for direct benefit for patients who are minors (45CFR 46.405).

expertise to adequately manage side effects, including in pediatric apheresis subjects. The 
potential risks of apheresis in this trial are as follows:
a. The most common side effects of apheresis ar e pain and bruising at IV sites. A central 
venous catheter may be required. Possible side effects include pain, bleeding, bruising, 
infection, thrombosis, vascular perforation, and risks associated with the sedation used 
for placement.
b. During apheresis, mild side effects from citrate anticoagulant are common and include 
chills, numbness and tingling ("pi[INVESTIGATOR_5625]"), anxiety, muscle cramps, and nausea. 
More serious side effects due to citrate-induced hypocalcemia are uncommon and include 
low blood pressure, seizures, weakness, and tetany. Citrate reactions rapi[INVESTIGATOR_83861]. Prophylactic IV CaCl2 and MgSO4 infusions may be administered to donors deemed to be at high risk of citrate toxicity. 
Risks of parenteral calcium and magnesium include extravasation necrosis and 
cardiovascular effects including bradycardia and blood pressure changes. However, side 
effects are unlikely given the low rate of infusion and use of large bore catheters for 
apheresis.
c. Transient mild thrombocytopenia is common after apheresis, but bleeding is unlikely.
d. Dilutional anemia occurs during apheresis, but this is unlikely to be clinically significant. 
e. Side effects of blood draws include pain  and bruising, lightheadedness, and rarely, 
fainting. 
9.3.3 Risks of the chemotherapy regimens and supportive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_83862]-known toxicity profiles. Refer to Section 11for summary of toxicities.
9.4 R
ISKS/BENEFITS ANALYSIS
Patients will be monitored frequently as both inpatients and outpatients and side effects will be 
treated promptly. These measures will help to mitigate the potential risks observed with the 
preparative chemotherapy regimen and the cell administration. The enrollment profile and dose 
escalation rules will help to ensure that patients are not exposed to unacceptable risk as a safe 
dose level is determined. 
Patients on this study may directly benefit from participation. It is anticipated that this study will 
provide scientific information relevant to tu mor immunotherapy. Consequently, participation 
involves greater than minimal risk, but presents the prospect for direct benefit for patients who 
are minors (45CFR 46.405).

Fludarabine is supplied in a 50 mg vial as a fluda rabine phosphate powder in the form of a white, 
lyophilized solid cake.
10.2.3 Stability Following reconstitution with 2 mL of sterile water for injection to a concentration of 25 mg/ml, 
the solution has a pH of 7.7. The fludarabine powder is stable for at least 18 months at 2-80C; 
when reconstituted, fludarabine is stable for at least 16 days at room temperature. Because no 
preservative is present, reconstituted fludarabine will typi[INVESTIGATOR_74844] 8 hours. 
Specialized references should be consulted for specific compatibility information. Fludarabine is 
dephosphorylated in serum, transported intracellularly and converted to the nucleotide 
fludarabine triphosphate; this 2-fluoro-ara-ATP mo lecule is thought to be required for the drug’s 
cytotoxic effects. Fludarabine inhibits DNA polymerase, ribnucleotide reductase, DNA primase, 
and may interfere with chain elongation, and RNA and protein synthesis.
10.2.[ADDRESS_1166067] vials should be stored refrigerated (2-8 qC).
10.2.5 Administration 
Fludarabine is administered as an IV infusion in an appropriate solution over 30 minutes. To 
prevent undue toxicity the dose will be based on BSA (25 mg/m
2/dose) 
10.2.6 Toxicities
At doses of 25 mg/m2/day for [ADDRESS_1166068] is myelosuppression; however, 
thrombocytopenia is responsible for most cases of severe and life-threatening hematologic 
toxicity. Serious opportunistic infections have occurred in CLL patients tr eated with fludarabine. 
Hemolytic anemia has been reported after one or more courses of fludarabine with or without a prior history of a positive Coomb’s test; fatal hemolytic anemia has been reported. In addition, bone marrow fibrosis has been observed after fludarabine therapy. Other common adverse 
effects include malaise, fever, chills, fatigue, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, and weakness. 
Irreversible and potentially fatal central nervous system toxicity in the form of progressive 
encephalopathy, blindness, and coma is only rarely observed at the currently administered doses 
of fludarabine. More common neurologic side effe cts at the current doses of fludarabine include 
weakness, pain, malaise, fatigue, paresthesia, visu al or hearing disturbances, and sleep disorders.

YCLOPHOSPHAMIDE 
(Refer to FDA-approved package insert for complete product information)
Description: Cyclophosphamide is a nitrogen mustard-derivative alkylating agent. Following conversion to 
active metabolites in the liver, cyclophosphamide functions as an alkyating agent; the drug also 
possesses potent immunosuppressive activity. The serum half-life after IV administration ranges 
from 3-12 hours; the drug and/or its metabolites can be detected in the serum for up to 72 hours 
after administration. 
10.3.1 How Supplied Cyclophosphamide will be obtained from commercially available sources by [CONTACT_839206]. 
10.3.2 Stability
Following reconstitution as directed with sterile water for injection, cyclophosphamide is stable 
for 24 hours at room temperature or 6 days when kept at 2-80C. 
10.3.3 Administration It will be diluted in an appropriate solution and infused over one hour. The dose will be based on 
the patient’s body weight, at 900 mg/m2/dose after fludarabine infusion on Day -2.
10.3.4 Toxicities 
Hematologic toxicity occurring with cyclop hosphamide usually includes leukopenia and 
thrombocytopenia. Anorexia, nausea and vomiting, rash and alopecia occur, especially after 
high-dose cyclophosphamide; diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, infertility, and mucosal and oral 
ulceration have been reported. Sterile hemorrhagic cystitis occurs in about 20% of patients; 
severity can range from microscopic hematuria to extensive cystitis with bladder fibrosis. 
Although the incidence of hemorrhagic cystitis associated with cyclophosphamide appears to be 
lower than that associated with ifosfamide, mesna (sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate) has been 
used prophylactically as a uroprotective agent in patients receiving cyclophosphamide. 
Prophylactic mesna is not effective in preventing hemorrhagic cystitis in all patients. Patients 
who receive high dose cyclophosphamide may develop interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, which can 
be fatal. Hyperuricemia due to ra pid cellular destruction may occur,  particularly in patients with 
hematologic malignancy. Hyperuricemia may be minimized by [CONTACT_74918], alkalinization of the urine, and/or administration of allopurinol. If allopurinol is administered, 
patients should be watched closely for cyclophos phamide toxicity (due to allopurinal induction 
of hepatic microsomal enzymes). At high doses, cyclophosphamide can result in a syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion; hyponatremia with progressive weight gain without 
edema occurs. At high doses, cyclophophamide can result in cardiotoxicity. Deaths have 
occurred from diffuse hemorrhagic myocardial necrosis and from a syndrome of acute
myopericarditis; in such cases, congestive heart failure may occur within a few days of the first

dose. Other consequences of cyclophosphamide ca rdiotoxicity include arrhythmias, potentially 
irreversible cardiomyopathy, and pericarditis. Other reported adverse effects of 
cyclophosphamide include headache, dizziness, and myxedema; faintness, facial flushing, and 
diaphoresis have occurred following IV administration. Mesna (sodium 2-
mercaptoethanesulphonate; given by [CONTACT_51215]) is a synthetic sulfhydryl compound that can 
chemically interact with urotoxic metabolites of cyclophosphamide (acrolein and 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide) to decrease the incidence and severity of hemorrhagic cystitis.

ETHOTREXATE
10.12.1 Source and Pharmacology
Methotrexate is an antimetabolite and antifolate agent with antineoplastic and 
immunosuppressant activities. Methotrexate binds  to and inhibits the enzyme dihydrofolate 
reductase, resulting in inhibition of purine nucleotide and thymidylate synthesis and, subsequently, inhibition of DNA and RNA syntheses. Methotrexate also exhibits potent 
immunosuppressant activity although the mechanism(s) of actions is unclear.
10.12.2 ToxicityThe following toxicities may occur when given intrathecally: occasional headache, dizziness, 
tiredness, blurred vision or loss of balance for a few hours. Up to 15% of children may develop 
neurological changes including changes in level of consciousness, abnormal movements or confusion, very rarely leucoencephalopathy. 
10.12.3 Formulation and Stability
Methotrexate Sodium Injection USP is available fo r single use only in 20 mg and 1 gram vials, 
and will be diluted according to TIT in Section 4.1. Dilutions should be used within 24 hours if

11.4 A PPENDIX D: C ALCULATION OF WEIGHT FOR CELL DOSE CALCULATION IN MORBIDLY 
OBESE CANDIDATES
Formulation for deriving the weight to be used in targeting cell doses in morbidly obese cell 
candidates.
1. Definition
Obesity is defined as a BMI > 30.
BMI = wgt (kg) / [hgt (M)][ADDRESS_1166077], published formula:
Male : 50 + 2.3(Hgt - 60) where Hgt is in inches, and the result is expressed in kg. 
ex. The ideal weight of a 5'10" male = 50 + 2.3(10) = 73 kg. 
Female : 45.5 + 2.3(Hgt - 60), where height is in inches, and the result is in kg.
3. Calculation of the “practical weight.”
Calculate the midway point, halfway between the actual and ideal body weights (ie the 
average of the two numbers). This is the "practical weight" to be used in calculating the 
targeted cell dose.
4. Example :
Patient’s actual weight = 143 kg.Patient’ s actual height 173 cm = 69 in
BMI = 48
IBW formula = 50 + 2.3(9) = 70.[ADDRESS_1166078] point between 70.0 and 143 = 107 kg.
The weight we would use in targeting cell dose is 107 kg.

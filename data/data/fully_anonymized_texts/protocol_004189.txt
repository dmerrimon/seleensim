Title of Study:  
A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo -Controlled, Global Phase 3 Study of Edasalonexent in Pediatric 
Patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy  
Phase of Development:  3 
Objectives:  
Primary  
• To assess the efficacy of edasalonexent as measured by [CONTACT_838359] (CFB) on North Star 
Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) Total Score in pediatric patients with Duchenne muscular 
dystrophy ( DMD)  
Secondary  
• To assess the safety and tolerability of edasalonexent in pediatric patients with DMD  
• To assess the effects of edasalonexent on physical function as measured by [CONTACT_941] 10- meter walk/run 
test (10M WT) , time to stand from supi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  and the 4 -stair climb  in pediatric patients with DMD  
Methodology:  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3, multisite study of edasalonexent in pediatric 
patients with DMD.  Approximately 126  patients will be enrolled.   
Eligible patients will be ambulatory boys from ≥4.0 to <8.[ADDRESS_1202346] not used steroids within 24  weeks prior to treatment initiation (Day  1).   
As shown in the figure below, the study includes a 52-week, double- blind, placebo-controlled period 
comparing [ADDRESS_1202347] to 
continue in the open -label extension study, pending approval by [CONTACT_862493] .  Patients who choose not to participate should complete the safety follow -up within 2 weeks.  
Clinical Trial Protocol:  CAT -1004-301 16 April 2020 
Confidential and Proprietary 6 CAT -1004-301 – Overview of Study Design  
 
Double -Blind Placebo -Controlled Study  
Following a Screening period to determine eligibility, approximately 126 patients will be randomized 2:1 to 
receive edasalonexent 100  mg/kg/day (administered as approximately 33 mg/kg 3 times per day [TID ]) or 
placebo in double -blind fashion daily for 52 weeks.  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_862494] 
(≤6.0 years or > 6.0 years) , time to stand from supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (≤5 seconds or >5  seconds), treatment with eteplirsen 
(yes or no) , and region  (North America  or Europe/ Asia/ Australia ).  If siblings are enrolled,  they will be 
assigned to the same treatment group.  
Screening procedures should be performed within 4 weeks prior to the start of treatment on Day  1.  At the 
discretion of the Investigator, informed consent, collection of medical history and demographic data, and collection of laboratory Screening assessments may be completed remotely by a qualified medical professional at an alternative site setting.   
After Screening, eligible patients will complete Baseline procedures and begin receiving study drug 
(edasalonex ent or placebo) on Day 1.  Study drug will be orally administered as soft- gel capsules in divided 
doses taken with food containing at least 8 grams of fat.  Patients and their families will be provided with 
written and verbal instructions for study drug administration, and subsequent doses will be administered remotely, except for on scheduled site visits as specified in the Schedule of Assessments (SOA).   
Patients will have sit e visits approximately every 13 weeks with site calls in between as specified in the SOA.  
The efficacy  and safety of edasalonexent will be assessed at the timepoints specified in the SOA.   
Efficacy assessments will include:  the NSAA; timed function tests (TFTs) including the 10MWT , time to 
stand from supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and the 4- stair climb; muscle strength testing; Performance of Upper Limb (PUL) entry 
item assessment ; and assessment of health -related physical functioning as measured by [CONTACT_862495]. 
Safety assessments will include collection of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs),  growth 
parameters,  vital  signs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory testing (including chemistry, hematology, 
and urinalysis), assessment of adrenal function (adrenocorticotrophic hormone [ACTH] and cortisol levels), 
and electrocardiogram (ECG).   
For analysis of pharmacokinetics ( PK), blood samples will be obtained for determination of edasalonexent 
and its metabolite  concentrations.   
Additionally, blood samples will be drawn to evaluate gene expression, micro -RNA,  and protein biomarkers 
that might predict the course of disease and/or responses to treatment . 
Additional cardiac ECG monitoring will be performed via a wearable cardiac monitoring device if approved 
for use in the participating country.

approximately  48 hours via a wearable cardiac monitoring device if approved for use in the participating  
country. 
To measure bone health, lateral thoracolumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_862469] .  Bone radiography will be locally read 
and centrally evaluated. 
Statistical Methods:  
Analysis Populations: 
The Randomized Population consists of all patients who are randomized into the study.  
The Safety Population will consist of all patients who receive at least 1 dose of study drug.  
The Full Analysis Population for efficacy analyses will be a modified intent to treat (mITT) population and 
will consist of all patients in the Randomized Population who receive at least [ADDRESS_1202350] Baseline NSAA efficacy assessment.   
The Per Protocol (PP) Population will consist of all patients in the Full Analysis Population who complete the study, without any significant protocol violations.   
The PK Population will consist of all patients in the Safety Populat ion who receive at least [ADDRESS_1202351] 1 measured  plasma  concentration.   
Other analysis populations may be defined in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
General Considerations: 
Descriptive characteristics for continuous variables will be summarized using mean, median, standard 
deviation, minimum and maximum values.  For categorical variables, the number and percentage of patients 
(or observations) will be reported.   
Unless other wise defined for a particular endpoint, a patient’s b aseline value is the last measurement prior to 
initiation of study drug. Demographics, Baseline characteristics, and DMD -specific medical history will be listed by [CONTACT_4676], and 
summarized by [CONTACT_63300].   
Results of efficacy assessments will be listed by [CONTACT_4676], and summarized by [CONTACT_862498].  Descriptive statistics will be calculated for efficacy data as well as for CFB and differences 
between groups as applicable.   
Results of safety assessments will be listed by [CONTACT_4676], and summarized by [CONTACT_862498].  Descriptive statistics will be calculated for safety assessments by [CONTACT_862499].  AEs will be coded us ing the  Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA
®) 
dictionary and will be categorized by [CONTACT_6657].  Abnormal clinical laboratory values will be identified as outside (above or below) the normal range and will be evaluated for clinically 
notable abnormalities.  Reference (normal) ranges for laboratory parameters will be included in the clinical 
study report.  Shift tables will be implemented as applicable.  Concomitant medications will be listed by 
[CONTACT_862500] (WHO) Drug dictionary.  Medical history will be 
listed and coded by [CONTACT_862501]
® dictionary.  
Results of PK and PD assessments will be listed by [CONTACT_862502].  
Efficacy Endpoints and Analyses: 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the CFB in t he NSAA Total Score at Week 52 .  
The CFB in NSAA Total Score  will be analyzed using a mixed -model repeated- measures (MMRM) analysis 
of covariance (ANCOVA) , impleme nted using SAS® Proc Mixed .  The factors in the model will be Baseline 
age (≤ 6.0 years or > 6.0 years), time to stand from supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (≤5 seconds or >5 seconds), region (North America 
Clinical Trial Protocol:  CAT -1004-301 16 April 2020 
Confidential and Proprietary 10 or Europe /Asia/Australia ), visit, treatment group, Baseline value, Baseline value by [CONTACT_765], and treatment group 
by [CONTACT_765].   
The primary analysis will test the treatment difference at Week 52 via the MMRM model  at the 2 -sided 0.05 
level . The primary efficacy analysis will be performed on the Full Analysis Population with exclusions that 
may be defined in the SAP, such as excluding patients receiving treatment with eteplirsen.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints will include the CFB on the following:  
• 10MWT speed  
• Stand from supi[INVESTIGATOR_862470]  
• 4-stair climb speed  
The secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed in a similar manner to the primary efficacy endpoint 
analysis.   
Additional efficacy endpoints will include CFB on  the following: 
• Muscle strength testing  
• PUL  entry item assessment  
• PODCI Transfer and Basic Mobility scale  
Determination of Sample Size 
Approximately 126  patients will be  randomized  to either edasalonexent or placebo in a 2:1 ratio.  Based on 
Phase 1/[ADDRESS_1202352] 
size, and assuming a dropout rate of approximately 20% , the study ha s approximately 80% power to show a 
difference between the treatment groups at a 2 -sided type I error rate of 0.05.

Confidential and Proprietary 18 2. INTRODUCTION   
The purpose of this multisite, Phase 3 study is to confirm  the efficacy  and safety  of edasalonexent  
(CAT -1004) on  ambulatory male  pediatric patients with  a confirmed diagnosis of Duchen ne muscular 
dystrophy ( DMD).  The  study is  a 52-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing 
100 mg/kg/day of edasalonexent (administered as approximately 33 mg/kg 3 times per day [TID]) 
with placebo .   
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy  
DMD is a progressively debilitating and ultimately fatal inherited neuromuscular disorder affecting 
approximately 1 in 3,500 to 5,000 live male births worldwide .  It is caused by [CONTACT_862503], a critical part of the protein complex that connects the cytoskeletal actin of a 
muscle fiber to the extracellular matrix .  In the absence of dystrophin, the stress of repeated muscle 
contractions damages the sarcolemma resulting in repeated cycles of cellular degeneration, progressively failing regeneration, and inflammation ( Blake, 2002; Emery, 2002) .  Over time, muscle 
is replaced by [CONTACT_862504].  Of note, while a lack of dystrophin is the primary cause of 
DMD, it is not sufficient for disease progression, as evidenced by [CONTACT_862505] ( Porter, 2003 ; Hu, 2015) . 
Affected child ren are usually diagnosed between the ages of [ADDRESS_1202367] increased life span by [CONTACT_72623] ( Kohler, 2009) ; 
however, DMD still has an early mortality rate of 100%.   
There is no cure for DMD and those drug treatments that have recently been approved for the disease, 
i.e., ataluren, which received conditional approval in the Eu ropean Union, and eteplirsen 
(Exondys51™) , which received accelerated approval in the [LOCATION_002], demonstrate limited 
efficacy and are appropriate for only a subset of patients.  Current standard of care guidelines include the administration of glucocor ticoids  (Birnkrant, 2018a ; Birnkrant, 2018b)
, which can delay the time 
to respi[INVESTIGATOR_862471] t he onset of scoliosis, and improve performance on measures of clinical 
function in patients with DMD ( Manzur, 2009) .  However , they do not fully ameliorate symptoms or 
halt disease progr ession .  Moreover, their use is often limited by [CONTACT_862506], including 
growth inhibition, delay of pubertal changes, weight gain, behavioral changes, osteoporosis resulting in fractures, Cushingoid facies and habitus, cataracts, and myopathy, a particularly serious concern for patients with DMD (Manzur, 2009; Schakman, 2009; Hanaoka, 2012 ).   
Thus, even though there are a handful of treatment options available, those options are inadequate and a significant need remains for safer and more effective treatments for patients affected by [CONTACT_862507].  
Rationale for Edasalonexent as a Potential Therapy for the Treatment of DMD  
Edasalonexent, an orally administered small molecule containing covalently linked salicylic acid and docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA), synergistically leverages the ability of both compounds to 
intracellularly inhibit activated nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B  cells 
Clinical Trial Protocol:  CAT -1004-301 16 April 2020 
Confidential and Proprietary 19 (NF-κB) to reduce NF- κB-mediated inflammation and muscle degeneration and facilitate muscle 
regeneration ( Kopp, 1994; Yin, 1998; Cai, 2004; Zwart, 2010) .  Following its cellular uptake, 
edasalonexent is hydrolyzed into its constituents by [CONTACT_862508] (FAAH), 
simultaneously delivering salicylic acid and DHA to key intracellular targets where they significantly inhibit activated NF -κB. 
In vitro, edasalonexent inhibits NF-κB and downstream cytokines known to be increased in DMD (Vu, 2016) .  Edasalonexent inhibits lipopolysaccharide  (LPS)-stimulated pro -inflammatory gene 
expression ( TNF α, IL -6, IL -1β, SOCS3, MMP9) in RAW264.[ADDRESS_1202368] is greater 
than that produced by [CONTACT_862509].  In addition, studies in mouse C2C12 myotubes showed that edasalonexent blocks cytokine-induced reductions in MyoD to a greater degree than dexam ethasone and blunts cytokine-induced upregulation of MuRF1 and 
MMP9, both of which promote the degradation of key intracellular proteins and the extracellular matrix (Cai, 2004; Li, 2009) .  The se data are consistent with selective inhibition of activated NF -κB 
by [CONTACT_862510] a more positive and favorable effect on muscle degeneration and 
regeneration than that produced by [CONTACT_862511]-κB inhibition and activation of the 
glucocorticoid receptor by [CONTACT_446499].  
In vivo, edasalonexent inhibits NF-κB, and has positive effects in the mdx  and golden retriever 
muscular dystrophy ( GRMD) models of DMD.  Edasalonexent reduced LPS- stimulated release of 
TNFα levels in normal mice, and reduced muscle inflammation and muscle fiber degeneration, 
preserved muscle mass, and increased the number of regenerating fibers per field in the mdx mouse 
model of muscular dystrophy ( Hammers, 2016) .  Moreover, a single treatment with edasalonexent 
inhibited basal NF-κB p65 deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA) binding as well as LPS- stimulated NF -κB 
p65 activity and induction of TNFα protein in the GRMD dog model.  Similarly, administration of 
CAT -1041, a closely related analog of edasalonexent that differs only in the omega- 3 fatty acid 
moiety, significantly improved muscle endurance, increased muscle mass, and reduced fibrosis in the 
mdx mouse, and improved pulmonary function in the GRMD model of DMD. 
By [CONTACT_862512], pharmacological inhibition of NF-κB with edasalonexent has the potential to  provide 
disease-modifying benefits to patients of all mutations beyond those afforded by [CONTACT_446499], but 
without their negative side effects, which are largely independent of their anti- inflammatory 
properties ( Schacke, 2004 ; Newton, 2007) .   
2.1. Summary of Edasalonexent  Nonclinical Data  
In nonclinical studies, edasalonexent  demonstrated reduction of NF -κB activation in  vitro and in vivo, 
and disease-modifying effects in 2  established animal models of DMD, the mdx  mouse and the 
GRMD models .  To support single- and repeat -dose oral administration in healthy subjects, 
edasalonexent  has been assessed in a series of nonclinical studies including safety pharmacology, 
genotoxicity, and general toxicity studies in rats and dogs, with durations of repeat dose oral 
administration  up to 6 and 9 months , respectively .   
Detailed information on all edasalonexent  nonclinical studies conducted to date can be found in t he 
Investigator’s Brochure. 
Clinical Trial Protocol:  CAT -1004-301 16 April 2020 
Confidential and Proprietary 20 2.2. Summary of Edasalonexent  Clinical Experience  
Edasalonexent was  evaluated in three Phase 1 studies in adults ( Donovan, 2017) . Across the 
3 studies, 79 adult subjects  received  single doses of edasalonexent  up to 6000 mg and multiple doses 
up to 4000 mg/day for 14  days (~100 and 67 mg/kg/day, respectively), with no identified safety 
concerns .  Single-dose exposures of 2000 mg ( ~33 mg/kg) edasalonexent  significantly reduced 
ex vivo LPS -stimulated  NF-κB activity  and NF- κB p65 DNA binding, while 14 days of dosing with 
edasalonexent  reduced basal expression of  NF-κB target genes  in patients with  type 2 diabetes with 
mild inflammation .   
Edasalonexent is currently being evaluated  in ambulatory boys with DMD from ≥4 to <8 .0 years of 
age at enrollment who are not receiving  corticosteroids in a multipart, Phase 1/2 clinical study , 
CAT -1004-201.  Phase 1 , which has been completed, was a 1 -week, open-label study to assess the 
safety and pharmacokinetics ( PK) of 3 sequential ascending doses (33, 67, or 100 mg/kg/day  
administered as 17 mg/kg twice daily [BID], 33 mg/kg BID, or 33 mg/kg TID) of edasalonexent 
under low- or high-fat conditions.  Results from Phase 1  indicate that 7 days  of treatment with 
edasalonexent  at doses up to 100 mg/kg/ day were safe and generally well tolerated . There were no 
serious adverse events (SAEs), discontinuations, or dose reductions, and the most common adverse 
events (AEs) were gastrointestinal, primarily  mild diarrhea .  Pharmacokinetic data collected showed 
daily exposures projected to be within the range observed in adults (on a mg/kg basis), with only modest dif ferences between dosing after a high - or low- fat meal  at the 67 mg/kg/day dose.  
Importantly, clinical exposure at 100 mg/kg/day was [ADDRESS_1202369] level ( NOAEL ) in the 13- week postnatal day  (PND) 21 rat study, and 
2 times lower than those at the NOAEL in the 13 -week dog study.  
Phase 2 , which has also been completed, included patients from P hase 1  as well as additional patients 
(total N  = 31) and  was a randomized, placebo -controlled  study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, PK, 
and PD of the 2 higher doses edasalonexent (67  and 100 mg/kg/day) over [ADDRESS_1202370] common treatment- related AEs were 
gastrointestinal, primarily mild and transient diarrhea.  There were no  treatment -related SAEs, drug 
discontinuations, or dose reductions, nor were there any concerning trends in chemistry, hematology, 
coagulation, or adrenal function assessments .  Edasalonexent plasma exposure s were consistent with 
those observed in P hase 1 .  The 100 mg/kg/day dose level dem onstrated numerical improvement 
versus placebo  across multiple efficacy measures, though not stat istically significant.  The 
67 mg/kg/day dose group had mixed efficacy results compared with both the 100 mg/kg/day dose group and placebo, which in each case were not statistically significant.   
In the open -label extension , which i
 s currently ongoing, al l patients  (including those who received 
placebo in Phase 2 ) were to receive open -label edasalonexent  at dose levels of 67 or 100 mg/kg for up 
to [ADDRESS_1202371] (DSMB), all patients in the 67 mg/kg/day dose group were switched to the 100 mg/kg/day dose 
group (which was already ongoing at the time the P hase 2  results were analyzed ).   
In an interim analysis conducted with all data through December 31, 2017, patients on e dasalonexent 
at 100 mg/kg/day over [ADDRESS_1202372] speeds 
(10-meter walk/run test [ 10MWT], 4- stair climb, and time to stand) and North Star Ambulatory 
Assessment ( NSAA) when compared to declines in the prior off- treatment control period.  In addition 
to the muscle function assessments, supportive changes in measures of muscle health were observed, 
Clinical Trial Protocol:  CAT -1004-301 16 April 2020 
Confidential and Proprietary 21 consistent w ith positive edasalonexent treatment effects.  Four muscle enzymes (creatine kinase, 
alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase) were significantly 
lower compared to Baseline following 12 weeks of edasalonexent treatment and at later time points, consistent with a slowing of muscle degeneration and an improvement in muscle integrity.  A 
composite of magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) T2 rates of change in five lower leg muscles was 
also significantly improved through 48 wee ks of 100 mg/kg/day edasalonexent treatment compared to 
the off-treatment control period, consistent with a reduction of inflammation in the muscle. 
Improvements were also seen in rates of change in both soleus and vastus lateralis magnetic 
resonance spect roscopy ( MRS ) fat fraction through [ADDRESS_1202373] common adverse events, 
gastrointestinal, were typi[INVESTIGATOR_352018].  Based on emerging safety and efficacy data, all 
patients moved to 133 mg/kg/day (33/33/67 mg/kg in 3 divided doses) in the open- label extension . 
As of June 2018, 32 pediatric patients  had received up to 112 weeks of active dosing with 
edasalonexent at doses up to  133 mg/kg/day, with a total combined exposure of over 45 years,  with 
no safety concerns .  More detailed i nformation on clinical studies and potential clinical risks of 
edasalonexent  can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure.   
2.3. Dose Selection Rationale  
Selection of the 100 mg/kg/day dose of edasalonexent for this Phase 3 study is supported by [CONTACT_862513] 1/2 study of edasalonexent in same aged boys with DMD 
(CAT -1001-201), which showed: 
• The plasma exposure of edasalonexent at the NOAEL in the 26-week rat study (2000 mg/kg/day) is approximately 4-fold higher than that expected with the anticipated clinical 
dose utilized in CAT-1004-201 of 100 mg/kg/day.  The plasma exposure of edasalonexent 
at the NOAEL in the 13-week and 9 -month dog studies  (1000 mg/kg/day) is 
approximately 2-fold higher, than that expected with the anticipated clinical dose for this study of 100 mg/kg/day. 
• Treatment with edasalonexent at doses of 67 mg/kg/day for up to 47 weeks, at 
100 mg/kg/day for up to 84 weeks, and at 133 mg/kg/day for up to 32 weeks was  safe and 
generally well tolerated with no dose- dependent safet y findings, treatment- related SAEs, 
drug discontinuations, or dose reductions, and no concerning trends in chemistry, hematology, coagulation, or adrenal function assessments . 
• Treatment with 100  mg/kg/day edasalonexent resulted in numerical improvements across 
multiple efficacy measures  compared to placebo .  In contrast, the 67 mg/kg/day dose 
group had mixed efficacy results compared with both the 100 mg/kg/day dose group and 
placebo .  Compared to declines in the prior off- treatment control period, patients on 100 
mg/kg/day edasalonexent showed a slower decline in timed function test speeds and 
NSAA scores  over 60 weeks of treatment.

Confidential and Proprietary 23 3.3.1. Double -Blind Placebo -Controlled  Study Design 
As shown in Figure 1, f ollowing a Screening period to determine eligibility, approximately 
126 patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive edasalonexent 100 mg/kg/day (administered as 
approximately 33 mg/kg TID ) or placebo in double-blind fashion daily for [ADDRESS_1202376] 
capsule count per dose will be provided.  Randomization will be stratified  by [CONTACT_862494] (≤6.0 years 
or >6.0 years), time to stand from supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (≤5 seconds or >5 seconds), treatment with eteplirsen (yes 
or no), and region (North America or Europe/ Asia/Australia ). If siblings are enrolled, they will be 
assigned to the same treatment group. 
All Screening  procedures will be performed within 4 weeks  prior to the start of treatment (Day 1).  At  
the discretion of the Investigator, informed consent, collection of medical history and demographic 
data, and collection of laboratory S creening  assessments may be completed remotely by a qualified 
medical professional  at an alternative site setting .   
After Screening, eligible p atients will complete Baseline procedures and begin receiving study drug 
(edasalonexent or placebo) on Day  1.  Study drug will be orally administered as soft- gel capsules in 
divided doses taken with food containing at least 8 grams of fat as detailed in Section  5.1.1.  Patients 
and their families will be provided with written and verbal instructions for study drug administration, and subsequent doses will  be administered remotely, except for on scheduled site visits as specified in  
the Schedule of Assessments (SOA) in  Appendix 1.  Nutritional guidance will be provided at 
Baseline.  Patient compliance with nutritional guidance will be confirmed throughout treatment.   
Efficacy  and safety will be assessed at  site visits at the timepoints specified in the SOA  in 
Appendix 1.  Efficacy assessments will include: the NSAA; timed function tests ( TFTs ) including the 
10MWT, time to stand from supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and the 4- stair climb; muscle strength testing; the Performance of 
Upper Limb ( PUL ) scale; and assessment of physical functioning as measured by [CONTACT_862495] .   
Safety assessments will include collection of AEs, SAEs, growth parameters (height and  weight), 
vital signs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory testing (including chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), assessment of adrenal function (adrenocorticotrophic hormone [ACTH] and cortisol 
levels), and electrocardiogram ( ECG ).  To measure heart rate and heart rate variability, additional 
cardiac monitoring will be performed for approximately 48 hours via a wearable cardiac monitoring 
device if approved for use in the participating country. To measure bone health, lateral spin e 
radiography and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA) scan will be performed if approved by [CONTACT_862514]. 
For analysis of PK, blood and urine samples will be obtained for determination of edasalonexent and 
its metabolite  concentration s.  Blood samples will be drawn for analysis of PD. 
To assess ac ceptability and palatability of edasalonexent, caregivers will complete a study drug 
questionnaire. 
A safety follow-up should occur  within [ADDRESS_1202377] been 
made to the original study procedures and schedule of assessments to reduce the patient’s risk or 
exposure to COVID -19 while ensuring the integrity of the study. Changes to the study visit schedule

patients were impacted and how those patients were impacted.    
3.3.3. Completion of a Patient’s Participation in the Study and Overall Study Completion  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Completion of a Patient’s Participati on in the Study  
The length of a patient’s participation in the study will be from the time the informed consent form is 
signed through the Week  [ADDRESS_1202379] completed the study after  they complete the safety follow-
up.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Premature Patient Discontinuation from the Study  
Parents/guardians and patients (as applicable according to site and regional regulations) are free to 
withdraw consent and/or discontinue participation in the study at any time, without prejudice to 
further treatment .  A patient’s participation in the stu dy may also be discontinued at any time at the 
discretion of the Investigator, Medical Monitor, or Sponsor. 
The reasons indicated in Section  5.2.5 for withdrawing a patient from treatment may also be 
justifiable reasons for the Investigator , Medical Monitor, or Sponsor to remove a patient from the 
study.  Patients also may be discontinued from the study if the study is terminated by [CONTACT_1034] ( see 
Section  10.3.5). 
Patients who are prematurely withdrawn from the study (i.e., those who leave the study prior to 
completing the Week  52 assessments) will be asked to complete  an early termination (ET) visit prior 
to their last dose of study drug and are not permitted to re-enroll in the study.   
Post-study SAEs will be reported according to Section  7.6.  A patient will be considered discontinued 
due to an AE if they discontinued due to any AE, regardless of whether  the AE is considered related 
to investigational product.  If the patient withdraws from the study due to an AE, the Investigator should arrange for the patient to be followed appropriately until the AE has resolved or stabilized (in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689]). 
At the end of the patient’s participation in the study, the Investigator will document the reason(s) for 
study discontinuation in the electronic case report form (eCRF ). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Overall Study Completion 
The study will be considered complete when the last patient has completed  their last assessment . 
3.4. Discussion of Study Design, Including Choice of Control Group  
This is a Phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, PK , and PD of edasalonexent in ambulatory, 
male, pediatric patients with a confirmed diagnosis of DMD.  This  is a randomized, double-blind, 
Clinical Trial Protocol:  CAT -1004-301 16 April 2020 
Confidential and Proprietary 25 placebo -controlled study in which patients will receive either edasalonexen t or placebo daily for 
52 weeks .  
The rationale for the dose levels and dosing regimen used in the study is provided in Section  2.3. 
Population 
The study’s eligibility criteria are designed to include  only patients with an established diagnosis of 
DMD who are sufficiently well (both in terms of DMD and in terms of concomi tant illness ) to safely 
participate in study procedures and provide interpretable results.  Diagnostic criteria will include 
demonstration of a classic DMD clinical phenotype , increased  serum creatine kinase ( CK), and the 
presence of a mutation in the dystrophin gene consistent with DMD. 
Eligible patients will be ambulatory boys ≥4.0 to <8 .0 years of age.  These gender and age criteria are 
intended to facilitate enrollment (as DMD is much more common in boys), and ensure that the 
enrolled patients will be able to complete the timed function tests included in the study as efficacy 
assessments.  In addition, eligible patients must have not used steroids within the 24 weeks  prior to 
initiation of study treatment ( Day 1).  I t is important to evaluate the effects of edasalonexent  in the 
absence of concomitant steroid use since the positive effects of glucocorticoids are thought to be at least partially mediated by [CONTACT_336660]-inflammatory  action via modulation of NF -κB, an d 
edasalonexent  is proposed to work through the same pathway (but without the negative side effects).  
While  it is also important to evaluate the efficacy and safety of edas alonexent in the absence of other 
disease-modifying therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , recent nonclinical data have shown that administration of edasalonexent 
in combination with eteplirsen results in increased dys trophin expression and does not reveal any 
increased risk .  Therefore,  patients who have received at least 24  weeks of treatment with eteplirsen  
prior to Day 1 will be eligible for the study.   
For detailed information on prohibited concomitant medications, please refer to Section  5.3.   
To minimize the risk for practice ef fects  (which could mask potential treatment effects ), decrease the 
heterogeneity of the patient population with respect to disease state, and ensure that patients are not at 
high risk for imminent loss of ambulation, pat ients will be required to  do the following to enroll:  
stand from supi[INVESTIGATOR_105683] ≤[ADDRESS_1202380] been observed in 
the Phase 1/2 study, CAT-1004-201 (see the Investigator’s Brochure), s ince weight loss and adverse 
effects on adrenal glands were observed in 13-w eek juvenile rat toxicology studies at plasma 
exposures higher than anticipated in humans, monitoring of adrenal function will be included in this 
study as a precaution .  In addition to monitoring by [CONTACT_32366], sub-Investigators and M edical 
Monitors, a DSMB  will provide oversight of the study. 
Efficacy  
The selection of efficacy endpoints was based on consideration of the primary clinical manifestations 
of DMD, namely a progressive loss of muscle strength and the associated impact of this loss on function.  T he potential effects of edasalonexent  on muscle strength and function are assessed by

5.2.1. Dose Selection Rationale 
See Section  2.3 for details  on dose rationale. 
5.2.2. Dose Modification or Reduction  
Temporary or persistent dose reductions may be made for safety or tolerability  at any time during the 
study.  Refer to Section  7.9 for additional details.  
5.2.3. Safety Monitoring 
Safety will be monitored on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_737], Medical Monitor, and Sponsor.  In 
addition, the DSMB will review relevant study data (as defined in the DSMB charter)  to decide on 
the continuation, termination, or modification of the trial (also see Section  8.4).   
5.2.4. Treatment Compliance  
Throughout the study, patients and their parents/ caregivers  will complete  a diary documenting 
investigational product administration , and  diet compliance.  Upon completion of data entry, the 
database will undergo a quality review to ensure acceptable accuracy and completeness .  In addition, 
site call s, which will occur throughout the study as noted in the SOA ( Appendix 1) , will include a 
compliance check on  investigational product administration and diet.  Detailed information regarding 
the study- specific dietary requirements and the process for monitoring compliance to the diet are 
provided in the Study Reference Manual (SRM). 
5.2.5. Treatment Discontinuation  
A patient’s study treatme nt may be discontinued at any time at the patient’s/ parent/legal guardian ’s 
request or at the discretion of the Investigator, Medical Monitor or Sponsor.  The following may be 
justifiable reasons for the Investigator , Medical Monitor or Sponsor to discontinue a patient from 
treatment: 
• The patient experiences an  intolerable or unacceptable AE 
• The patient is unable to comply with the requirements of the protocol 
• The patient participates in another investigational study without the writt en authorization 
of the Sponsor 
Discontinuation of treatment does not imply withdrawal from the study.   
Patients who discontinue treatment prematurely will be asked to  complete the early termination visit 
prior to their last dose of study drug as noted in the SOA in  Appendix 1.   
5.3. Prior and Concomitant Medications and Therapeutic Procedures  
In general, disease -modifying drugs, investigational drugs, immunosuppressive therapy, and  drugs 
with narrow therapeutic indices metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 are 
prohibited for at least 4 weeks prior to Day 1 and during the study ( Table 2) .  Recent nonclinical data 
have shown that administration of edasalonexent in combination with eteplirsen  results in increased 
dystrophin expression and does not reveal any increased risk.  In regions where eteplirsen is approved 
Clinical Trial Protocol:  CAT -1004-[ADDRESS_1202383] 24  weeks of treatment 
with eteplirsen prior to Day 1 will be eligible for the study.   
Throughout the study, Investigators may prescribe c oncomitant medications or treatments deemed 
necessary to provide adequate supportive care to patients .   
Treatment with corticosteroids is prohibited within 24 weeks prior to Day  1 and during the study 
(Table 2).   
All medications should be taken as prescribed, per Investigator judgment, even when blood samples 
are planned to be drawn .  In addition, all concomitant medications, including supplements must be 
recorded in the source documentation and in the eCRF.   
Note:  Annual vaccination for influenza is strongly recommended for all patients. Table 2: Prohibited Prior and Concomitant Medications

5.4. Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment  
During the study, patients will be randomly assigned  in a 2:1 ratio to receive edasalonexent  or 
placebo  in double-blind fashion.   
5.5. Blinding and Randomization  
5.5.1. Blinding and Randomization 
Approximately 126 patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive edasalonexent or placebo in double-
blind fashion daily for 52 weeks .  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_862494] (≤6.0 years or 
>6.0 years), time to stand from supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (≤5 seconds or >5 secon ds), treatment with eteplirsen  (yes or 
no), and region (North America or Europe/ Asia/Australia ). 
Clinical Trial Protocol:  CAT -1004-301 16 April 2020 
Confidential and Proprietary 32 If siblings are enrolled, only one sibling will be included in the Randomized Population, the second 
sibling  will be assigned  to the same treatment group as th e randomized sibling (see Section  9.3).  If 
both siblings meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, the sibling to be included in the Randomized 
Population will be the first sibling randomized . 
5.5.2. Scheduled Unblinding  
After completion of the study, patients, monitors, Investigators, study center personnel, and the 
Sponsor will remain blinded to treatment assignments until results from the  study are available.   
5.5.3. Emergency Unblinding  
Prior to scheduled unblinding (see  Section  5.5.2), if an emergency where the identity of the 
investigational product must be known by [CONTACT_862515] , the Investigator will be allowed to unblind using the Inte ractive Web Response System 
(IWRS).  Before doing this , the Investigator should make every effort to discuss the situation with the 
Medical Monitor. 
The treatment assignment should only be unblinded when knowledge of the treatment assignment 
will impact the clinical management of the patient.  Every reasonable attempt should be made to 
complete the final treatment assessment procedures prior to unblinding, as knowledge of the 
treatment assignment c ould influence patient assessment .

The modified SOA for this study during the COVID-19 pandemic is provided in Appendix 2. 
6.2. Screening and Baseline Assessments  and Start of Treatment  
Once written informed  consent, and when appropriate, written assent  is obtained, patient s will be 
screened for  eligibility for entry into the study based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria  detailed 
in Sections  4.1 and  4.2.  A full medical/surgical history will be obtained, including information 
relating to any prior or existing medical conditions/surgical procedures that  may be relevant to the 
patient’s experience in the study .  Demographic data and DMD- specific medical history information 
will also be recorded .  Patients will undergo a full physical examination , including vital signs ( see 
Section s 6.4.1 and  6.4.2) , safety labs, a 12-lead ECG tracing will be obtained , and body weight wi ll 
be measured .  Additional cardiac monitoring will be performed via a wearable cardiac monitoring 
device to measure heart rate and heart rate variability if approved for use in the country.  T he 
laboratory assessments  shown in Appendix 3 will be performed .   
Screening assessments should be completed within 4 weeks  of Day 1. 
At Baseline, patient eligibility for the study will be reconfirmed and the patient will be randomized .  
Patients will undergo a full physical examination .  Height and body weight will be measured and 
body mass index (BMI) will be calculated.  Any AEs or changes in concomitant medications since 
Screening will be recorded .  Patients will undergo Baseline efficacy evaluations as specified in  
Appendix 1, and blood samples will be drawn for safety, ACTH/cortisol, biomarkers and gene expression.  Bone evaluations (spi[INVESTIGATOR_862472]) will be performed  if approved by 
[CONTACT_862496].  Patients and their families will be provided 
with written and verbal instructions for study drug administration.  Nutritional guidance will also be 
given and study drug will be dispens ed. 
6.3. Efficacy Assessments 
Efficacy  will be assessed at the timepoints specified in  Appendix 1.  
6.3.1. North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) 
The NSAA is a clinician -reported outcome instrument designed to measure ambulatory function in 
males with DMD (Scott, 2012) .  During this assessment, patients are asked to perform 17 different 
functional activities, including a 10MWT, rising from supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rising from a sit to stand, standing on 1 leg, e.g., climbing and descending a step, rising from the floor, lifting the head, standing on heels, 
and jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  The NSAA has undergone detailed psychometric evaluations based on traditional 
(reliability and validity ) and modern (Rasch analysis) methods, and  has been included in international 
clinical trials (Kinali, 2009) .  In addition, 36- month longitudinal data are available in patients with 
DMD ( Mazzone, 2011; Pane, 2014b) .  The NSAA will be administered by [CONTACT_407920]; every 
effort will be made to have the same evaluator perform all assessments for a given child at the same time of day.  Completion of this test is expected to take approximately 20- 30 minutes.  
Clinical Trial Protocol:  CAT -1004-301 16 April 2020 
Confidential and Proprietary 34 Additional details on the performance of the NSAA are provided in the Clinical Evaluator  Manual.  
6.3.2. Timed  Function Testing  
TFTs will include the 10MWT  and the stand from supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (as measured in  the NSAA)  as well as the  
4-stair climb .  These test s have been used as clinical trial endpoints in DMD and have shown 
response to therapeutic intervention with steroids ( Mendell, 1989; Griggs, 1990; Beenakker, 2005; 
Manzur, 2009) .  TFTs will be performed by [CONTACT_407920] ; every effort will be made to have the 
same evaluator  perform all assessments for a given child  at the same time of day .  Completion of 
TFTs is expected to take approximately 10 minutes.  
Additional details on the performance of the TFTs is provided in the Clinical Evaluator  Manual.  
6.3.3. Muscle Strength Testing  
Muscle strength testing will include assessment of knee extension and elbow flexion.  Muscle testing  
will be performed using a hand-held dynamometer.  Knee myometry will be performed while the  
patient is in a  sitting position .  Elbow myometry will be performed while th e patient is positioned 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  Muscle testing will be performed by [CONTACT_262865] s; every effort will be made to have the 
same evaluator  perform all assessments for a given child  at the same time of day .  Completion of each 
muscle test is expected to take approximately 10-15 minutes , for a total of 20-30 minutes .   
Additio nal details on the assessment of muscle strength  are provided in the Clinical Evaluator  
Manual.  
6.3.4. Performance of Upper Limb  (PUL) Scale 
The PUL was specifically designed by [CONTACT_862516], scientists, patient advocacy groups and industries representative to assess upper limb function in ambulant and non-ambulant DMD patients ( Mercuri, 2012; Mayhew, 2013b) .  The PUL is 
made up of a 6-point entry item (based on the modified Brooke Upper Extremity Scale) to define the starting functional level, and 22 items subdivided into shoulder level (6 items), middle level (9 items) and distal level ( 7 items) dimension (Pane, 2018) .  Loss of full overhead reach occurs at median age 
9.6 with some boys losing the ability as early as age 5 or 6 ( McDonald, 2018) .  Patients will perform 
the PUL entry item assessment as specified in  Appendix 1.  Based on the age of patients in this study, 
most patients will score a [ADDRESS_1202385] internal reliability, validity, and hierarchical 
scalability (Mayhew, 2013a ), excellent interobserver and intra- observer reliability (Pane, 2014a ), and 
is sensitive to changes over time (Seferian, 2015)  and in response to steroid treat ment (Pane, 2015 ).  
It may be most suitable for DMD patients 5 years of age and above.  Completion of the 6-point entry 
item assessment is expected to take approximately 5 minutes. Completion of the battery of PUL 
assessments is expected to take approximately 20 minutes.  
Additional details on the PUL scale are provided in the Clinical Evaluator Manual .

Confidential and Proprietary 35 6.3.5. The Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection Instrument (PODCI ) 
The PODCI  is a well -validated tool for assessment of health -related functioning in children, and  has 
been used in a study of boys with DMD (Henricson, 2013) .  It is designed to be completed by [CONTACT_31588]/caregiver  of children aged 10 or younger, contains 86 questions, takes approximately 
20-30 minutes to complete , and provides information on the following 6 scales:  
• Upper Extremity and Physical Function Scale:  Measures difficulty encountered in 
performing daily personal care and student activitie s. 
• Transfer and Basic Mobility Scale:   Measures difficulty experienced in performing routine 
motion and motor activities in daily activities.  
• Sports and Physical Functioning Scale:  Measures difficulty or limitations encountered in participating in more active activities or sports .   
• Pain/Comfort Scale:  Measures the level of pain experienced during the past week. 
• Happi[INVESTIGATOR_7110]:  Measures overall satisfaction with personal looks and sense of 
similarity to friends and others of own age. 
• Global Functioning Scale:  A general combined s cale calculated from the first 4 scales 
listed above. 
Parents/caregivers will complete the PODCI listed in  Appendix [ADDRESS_1202386] -
Administration.  
The following efficacy assessments will be administered by [CONTACT_262865] s:  NSAA, TFTs, muscle 
strength testing , and PUL.  To help ensure proper and consistent test administration across 
evaluator s/sites, all evaluator s will undergo training on the proper administration of the se assessments 
prior to the study.  As part of this training, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_862473]; test administrations will be videotaped, reviewed for adherence and inter -rater consistency, and feedback will be provided as applicable. 
To help ensure proper and consistent test administration over the course of the study, administration of NSAA, TFT s, and muscle strength testing may be videotaped and reviewed for each patient at 
Screening  and Week 52 and may also  be required at  Baseline as specified in  Appendix 1. 
Additional information on the training and monitoring of the administration of these tests is provided in the Clinical Evaluator  Manual.   
6.4. Safety Assessments  
Safety will be assessed for all enrolled patients from Screening through the  safety follow-up, as 
specified in  Appendix 1.  Safety parameters  include physical examinations, growth parameters , vital 
signs, clinical laboratory tests  (including chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and tests for adrenal 
function), ECGs, and concomitant medication monitoring as described in Section  6.4.[ADDRESS_1202387] of all required clinical laborator y assessments is provided in 
Appendix 3.   
Clinical Trial Protocol:  CAT -1004-301 16 April 2020 
Confidential and Proprietary 36 6.4.1. Physical Examination and Growth Parameters  
The physical examination s will include an assessment of the patient’s general appearance; skin; head, 
ears, eyes , nose, throat ( HEENT ); lymph nodes; heart; lungs; abdomen; extremities/joints; and 
neurological and mental status.  Physical examinations should be performed by [CONTACT_862517].  Height and weight will be measured a t the timepoints  specified  in Appendix 1 and BMI 
will be calculated.  
6.4.2. Vital Signs  
Vital s igns (blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and temperature) will be measured at the 
timepoints specified in  Appendix 1.  Systolic and diastolic blood pressure ( preferably assessed on the 
same arm each time) will  be measured only after the patient is positioned in a semi -supi[INVESTIGATOR_862474] t 5 minutes .   
6.4.3. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Blood and urine samples will be collected for clinical laboratory evaluations (see Appendix [ADDRESS_1202388] of analytes ). 
The clinical laboratory tests to be done at Screening  include hematology with differential, chemistry,  
and urinalysis.   
Blood samples for ACTH and cortisol will be obtained at Baseline before initiation of treatment.   
Chemistry, hematology, and ACTH/cortisol assessments done during the treatment period  will be 
performed in the morning when possible.   
A central laboratory will provide collection supplies, arrange collection, and perform analysis of 
clinical laboratory e valuations indicated in Appendix 3.  Using the central laboratory for unscheduled 
clinical laboratory evaluations and re peat testing  is recommended .  Procedures for the handling and 
shipment of all central laboratory samples will be included in the Laboratory Manual.  Specimens will be appropriately processed by [CONTACT_862518] a timely manner to ensure appropriate clinical review.  
The enrolling Investigator is responsible for reviewing and signing all laboratory reports unless the 
patient is transferred to another site for all subsequent visits .  The clinical significanc e of each value 
outside of reference range will be assessed by [CONTACT_862519] (NCS ) or clinically significant.  All clinically significant values require a comment and the 
out-of-range value or the overlying diagnosis (or value if the diagnosis is unknown) must be captured as an AE.  
Clinical laboratory reports will serve as source documents. 
6.4.4. Electrocardiogram  
The 12-lead ECG s will be performed only after the patient is positioned supi[INVESTIGATOR_050], resting, and quiet for 
a minimum of 5 minutes .  If findings are abnormal, the Investigator is responsible for indicat ing 
Clinical Trial Protocol:  CAT -1004-301 16 April 2020 
Confidential and Proprietary 37 whether the ECG tracing is NCS or clinically significant.  In addition, E CGs will be  centrally 
evaluated .   
6.4.5. Concomitant Medications and Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_862475] .  Reasonable efforts will be 
made to determine all treatments (pharmacological and non-pharmacological) received by [CONTACT_102] .   
A medication/therapy is considered concomitant if it is taken/administered  at any time from 
Screening  through the final study evaluation. 
Data on pharmacological and non- pharmacological treatments will be recorded on an  eCRF page, to 
include:  drug name/name [CONTACT_315765], dose, route, regimen, start date, stop date, and indication.  At 
each study visit, the parent or caregiver  will be asked about any additional treatments or any changes 
in regimen or dosages since the last visit.  Indications for any new medications or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_862476].  
Patients and their parents/caregivers will be contact[CONTACT_862520] (as indicated in  Appendix 1).  
For detailed information on prohibited concomitant medications please refer to  Section  5.3.   
6.5. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Samples for determination of edasalonexent and its metabolite  concentration s will be drawn at 
selected visits as detailed in  Appendix 1.  
In addition to the PK analyses described, any of the collected PK plasma and urine sa mples from 
study patients may also be used for profiling of drug binding proteins, bioanalytical method 
validation purposes, stability assessments, metabolite assessments, or to assess other actions of study 
drug with plasma constituents. 
6.6. Pharmacodynamic  Assessments  
Blood samples will be obtained at selected visits as indicated in  Appendix 1.  Assessments may 
include: 
• Circulating protein biomarkers to evaluate course of disease and /or response to treatment  
• DNA, RNA (ribonucleic acid) , and micro- RNA samples may be collected and used for 
pharmacogenomic analys es that might predict the course of disease and/or responses to 
treatment  as well as analysis of drug metabolizing enzyme and/or transporte rs. 
Details of blood collection procedures will be provided in the Laboratory Manual.   
6.7. Cardiac Monitoring  
Patients with DMD are known to have resting tachycardia even in the age range in this clinical study 
(Thomas, 2012) .  Additionally, decreases in heart rate variability have been observed ( Thomas, 
2015) .  Since decreases in heart rate to age -normative values were observed in a previous clinical 
study (CAT-1004- 201), measures of heart rate and variability will be colle cted for approximately 48 
hours via a wearable cardiac monitoring device if approved for use in the participating country. In 
addition, the results from the patient’s last cardiac assessment should be documented as part of 
Clinical Trial Protocol:  CAT -1004-[ADDRESS_1202389] over two times as many fractures as steroid naïve patients  (King, 2007 ).  Fractures that occur in 
lower extremities can lead to early loss of ambulation.  Bone evaluations will be performed  through 
lateral thoracolumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_862472].  In [LOCATION_013], bone assessment will not be 
performed until the respective approvals from the German Federal Office for Radiation Protection (Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz ) become available.  A qualified medical professional will review the 
results of the lateral thoracolumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_862477]; if abnormal, the Investigator will indicate whether the scans are NCS or clinically significant.  In addition, bone radiography will be centrally evaluated.  
6.9. Study Drug Acceptability  
To evaluate the acceptability and pal atability of edasalonexent, caregivers will complete the study 
drug questionnaire listed in  Appendix 4  at timepoints  indicated in Appendix 1.  
6.10. Total Volume of Blood Collected  
The total n umber of venipunctures and the total volume of blood collected during the study will be 
limited to that needed for safety monitoring, PK, and PD  measurement .  Refer to the SRM  and/or 
laboratory manual for the collection preparation and procedures as well as the estimated  total volume 
of blood to be collected during the study.  The total blood volume collected from each patient for the 
entire  study is within the guidelines set forth by [CONTACT_38375] ( WHO ) (Howie,  
2011) .

Confidential and Proprietary 39 7. ADVERSE EVENT S AND ADVERSE EVENT  REPORTING 
At each study visit, patients will be evaluated for new AEs and the status of existing AEs.  The 
Investigator may elicit symptoms using an open-ended question, followed by [CONTACT_862521]’s verbatim description of AEs or change in concomitant medications.  T he 
enrolling Investigator is responsible for safety oversight of data for all visits  unless the patient is 
transferred to another site for all subsequent visits.  All AEs from the time of signing the informed 
consent through follow-up will be recorded on the eCRF.  
7.1. Timeframe for Collection of Adverse Events 
7.1.1. Adverse Events Occurring Prior to Study Treatment  
All AEs that occur between the time informed consent is provided and the patient’s receipt of the first dose of investigational product will be considered pretreatment AEs. 
7.1.2. Adverse Events Occurring After Study Treatment  
All AEs that occur from the time of the administration of the first dose of investigational product 
through the end of the safety f ollow-up will be considered treatment- emergent AEs  (TEAEs) .  
7.1.3. Adverse Events Occurring Following Patient Discontinuation of Treatment 
For patients who prematurely discontinue study treatment ( see Section  5.2.5), but who are not 
withdrawn from the study, AEs will continue to be recorded until the patient completes the study ( see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for definition of patient completion).  See Section  7.[ADDRESS_1202390] (active or placebo drug, biologic, or device).  An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended symptom, sign, disease or condition, or test abnormality, whether  considered related to the investigational product. 
Adverse events include: 
• Symptoms described by [CONTACT_862522]  
• Test abnormalities (laboratory tests, ECG, X- rays, etc. ) that result in an alteration in 
medical c are (diagnostic or therapeutic) 
Adverse events do not include: 
• Changes that are characteristic of disease progression in Duchenne  
Abnormalities present at Baseline are considered AEs only if they reoccur after resolution or they worsen during the study. 
Clinical Trial Protocol:  CAT -1004-301 16 April 2020 
Confidential and Proprietary 40 7.2.2. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
Seriousness of an AE serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  An SAE is any 
AE that results in any of the following: 
Death :  The patient died as the result of the event. 
Life-threatening event :  Any AE that places the patient, in the view of the Investigator, at immediate 
risk of death from the AE as it occurred, i.e., does not include an AE that had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death. 
Required or prolonged inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]:  The AE resulted in an initial inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_756490].  Note:  Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614], or surgical procedures for an illness or disease that existed before the a dministration of 
the study treatment or before the patient was enrolled in the study, will not be captured as SAEs unless they occur at a time other than the planned date. 
Persistent or significant disability/incapacity:  An AE that results in a substantial disruption of a 
person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
Congenital anomaly/birth defect:  A congenital anomaly/birth defect that occurs in the offspring of a 
patient exposed to the investigational product. 
Important medical events :  An AE that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
7.3. Evaluation of Adverse Events/Serious Adverse Events  
7.3.1. Relationship to Study Treatment  
Assessment of the association between the AE and study drug exposure is important for regulatory reporting.  For each AE/SAE , the Investigator will  determine whether there is a reasonable possibility 
that the AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_862523]:  
Not Related :  The AE is clearly not related to study drug. 
Unlikely Related :  There is no evidence of a causal relationship between study drug and the AE; 
although such relationship cannot be ruled out. 
Possibly Related :  There is some evidence supporting the possibility of a causal relationship between 
study drug and the AE. 
Related :  There is stron g evidence that there is a causal relationship between study drug and the AE. 
A relationship to the investigational product must be given for each AE/SAE recorded, even if there is only limited information at the time .  The Investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_862478]-up information, amending the AE/SAE report accordingly. 
7.3.2. Severity Grading of Adverse Event Scoring  
Note that severity  is not the same as “seriousness,” which is defined in Section  7.2.2.   
Clinical Trial Protocol:  CAT -1004-301 16 April 2020 
Confidential and Proprietary 41 The Investigator will grade the severity of all AEs/SAEs as mild, moderate, or s evere, based on the 
following definitions ( developed from Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium [CDISC] 
Study Data Tabulation Model [SDTM] standard terminology v3.1.1): 
Mild:  A n AE  that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic 
intervention.  The event does not generally interfere with usual acti vities of daily living.  
Moderate:  A n AE that is usually alleviated with specific therapeutic intervention .  The event 
interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort, but poses no significant or 
permanent risk of harm to the research participant.  
Severe:  A n AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical status, or 
may require intensive therapeutic intervention. 
7.3.3. Outcome 
Outc ome describes the status of the AE.  The Investigator will provide information regarding the 
patient outcome of each AE. 
Possible results of an AE outcome are defined as follows : 
Fatal :  The termination of life as a result of an AE.  
Not recovered/not resolved:  The patient has not recuperated or the AE has not improved. 
Recover ing/resolving:  The patient is recuperating or the AE is improving. 
Recovered/resolved:  The patient has recuperated or the AE has resolved.  
Recovered with sequelae/resolved with sequelae:  The AE has resolved, but the patient has been left 
with symptoms o r pathology. 
Unknown:  Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused. 
7.3.4. Action Taken Regarding the Investigational Product 
The Investigator will be required to provide the action taken regarding investigational product (e.g., 
active, comparator ) in response to the AE according to the following categories: 
Dose not changed:  No change in administration of the investigational product. 
Dose reduced :  Reduction in the frequency, strength or amount of investigational product 
administered.  
Drug (investigational product) interrupted:  Temporary interruption ( termination ) in administration of 
the investigational product. 
Drug (investigational product) withdrawn :  Administration of the investigational product terminated 
(no further dosing). 
Not applicable:  Determination of a value is not relevant in the current context. 
Unknown:  Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused.

I
Clinical Trial Protocol:  CAT -1004-[ADDRESS_1202391] submission to their local IRB/IEC as required.  All reports 
sent to Investigators will be blinded. 
The Investigator must continue to follow the patient until the SAE has resolved  or until the condition 
becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of persistent impairment) or the patient dies.  Within 
[ADDRESS_1202392] update the SAE form 
electronically in the EDC system for the study and submit any supporting documentation (e.g., patient discharge summary or autopsy reports) to contacts above via fax or e- mail.  If it is not possibl e to 
access the EDC system, refer to the procedures outlined above for initial reporting of SAEs.   
7.7. Follow-up of Adverse Events/Serious Adverse Events  
All AEs/SAEs documented at a previous visit/contact [CONTACT_862524]/not resolved or recovering/resolving will be reviewed by [CONTACT_326918]/contacts. 
All AEs will be followed until the parameter returns to its Baseline status , resolution of AE, 
completion of the patient’s participation, agreement is reached between the Investigator and Sponsor 
that the even t no longer requires follow-up, or study termination, whichever occurs first.  S AEs will 
be followed until resolution, the condition stabilizes, or the Investigator and Medical Monitor agree 
that follow -up is no longer necessary .  Rules for AE/SAE follow -up apply to all patients, including 
those withdrawn prematurely to the extent allowed by [CONTACT_102]’s consent .  The Investigator will 
ensure that follow-up includes further investigations consistent with appropriat e medical management 
and patient consent to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE/SAE. 
7.8. Pregnancy Reporting  
Not applicable for this study. 
7.9. Temporary or Persistent Dose Reductions  
Temporary or persistent dose reductions may be made for safety or tolerability reasons in the 
judgment of the Principal Investigator.  If at any time after initiation of treatment the patient 
experiences a clinically significant AE indicative of drug intol erance, the patient will undergo clinical 
assessment as soon as reasonably possible.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_862480] .   
7.10. Monitoring of Abnormal Laboratory Values  
Elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT ) and aspart ate aminotransferase ( AST ) are common in 
patients with DMD, so exclusion of patients with abnormal Baseline values is not feasible .  Patients 
with abnormal GGT will be excluded.   
During the study, liver function tests will be monitored, including ALT, AST, GGT, alkaline 
phosphatase, glutamate dehydrogenase, and bilirubin.  If increases in ALT or AST are noted, the 
relationship of these to CK will be determined, as well as to GGT and measures of liver synthetic 
function.  Trends in these parameters will be monitored .  Safety alert flags for the Investigator and 
Medical Monitor will include an alert for increases in ALT >150  U/L with stable or decreased CK,  as 
well as for  total bilirubin , glutamate dehydrogenase, or GGT parameters greater than the ULN.   
Additional information on s afety alert flags will be included in the Laboratory Manual.

case of the stand from supi[INVESTIGATOR_20793] 4-stair climb in units of task per second).  Descriptive statistics will 
be calculated for quantitative efficacy data as well as for the CFB , and differences between groups as 
applicable. 
Clinical Trial Protocol:  CAT -1004-301 16 April 2020 
Confidential and Proprietary 49 9.10.1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the CFB  in the NSAA Total Score at Week  52. 
The CFB in NSAA Total Score will be analyzed using a mixed -model repeated -measures (MMRM) 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), implemented using SAS® Proc Mixed .  The factors in the model 
will be Baseline age (≤ 6.0 years or >6.0 years) , time to stand from supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (≤5 seconds or >5 seconds), 
region (North America or Europe/ Asia/Australia ), visit, tre atment group, Baseline value, Baseline 
value by [CONTACT_765], and treatment group by [CONTACT_765]. 
The primary analysis will test the treatment difference at Week  52 via the MMRM model at the two -
sided 0.05 level.  Details of the MMRM model will be provided in the SAP. The primary analysis 
will be performed on the Full Analys is Population with exclusions that may be defined in the SAP, 
such as excluding patients receiving treatment with eteplirsen. 
9.10.2. Secondary  Efficacy Endpoints  
The secondary efficacy endpoints will be the CFB  to Week  52 on the 10MWT, stand from supi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  
and 4- stair climb . 
The Baseline values and CFB in each will be summarized by [CONTACT_862528] .  The CFB will be analyzed using the same MMRM ANCOVA model as 
described above for the primary efficacy endpoint. The secondary efficacy analys es will be performed 
on the Full Analysis Population with exclusions that may be defined in the SAP, such as excluding 
patients receiving treatment with eteplirsen.  
9.10.3. Controlling for Multiplicity  
The method for controlling the overall Type I Family -wise error rate at the two -sided 0.05 level will 
be provided in the SAP. 
9.10.4. Sensitivity Analyses of the Primary and Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Sensitivity analys es of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be specified in the SAP .   
While the MMRM analysis represents the primary method for incorporating patients with missing 
data (i.e., observed case analyses), a multiple  imputation method for addressing missing data will be 
applied using the primary and secondary analysis methods.   
Additional details on the methods to assess the impact of missing data will be provided in the SAP. 
9.10.5. Additional  Efficacy Endpoints  
Additional efficacy endpoints will include CFB on the following endpoints: 
• Muscle strength testing  
• PUL  entry item assessment 
• PODCI  Transfer and Basic Mobility scale 
The analysis methods for these endpoints will be defined in the SAP.  Additional efficacy  endpoints 
may also  be defined in the SAP. 
Clinical Trial Protocol:  CAT -1004-301 16 April 2020 
Confidential and Proprietary 50 9.11. Pharmacokinetic  Analyses  
Serial plasma concentration time data collected for edasalonexent and its metabolites will be analyzed 
using non- compartmental methods for all patients with evaluable data.  Actual sample and dosing 
times will be used for pharmacokinetic analyses. Pharmacokinetic parameters, as data permit, will be 
reported for individual patients and summarized using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_765]. Trough 
concentrations will be summarized separately, along with other single time -point plasma 
concentration data by [CONTACT_765]. Exploratory PK- PD analyses may be performed as deemed necessary.  
In addition to non-compartmental analyses or when the data do not lend to a non- compartmental 
approach, pharmacokinetic data will be analyzed using non- linear mixed -effects modeling approach 
for population pharmacokinetic analyses. For population PK analyses, data from this clinical study 
will be pooled with data from other clin ical studies with extensive and/or sparse sampling. The 
population PK analyses will characterize the inter - and intra- subject variability in pharmacokinetic 
parameters and evaluate the effect of covariates such as but not limited to, demographics (e.g., age, body weight, race), disease status on oral clearance and volume. Exploratory population PK- PD 
analyses may also be performed to evaluate and characterize exposure-response relationships. 
As an exploratory analysis, urine samples will be analyzed in terms of concentrations of 
edasalonexent and/or metabolites.  
Raw and derived data will be summarized using descriptive statistics and presented graphically, as appropriate.  Plasma  PK parameters will be estimated from plasma concentration -versus- time data 
using noncompartmental analyses.   
The following noncompartmental PK parameters will be calculated from plasma samples: 
• Area under concentration  time curve from time [ADDRESS_1202398] quantifiable concentration 
(AUC
last) 
• Area under concentration time curve fro m time [ADDRESS_1202399] dosing ( AUC 0-4) 
• Maximum plasma concentration (C max) 
• Last quantifiable plasma concentration (C last) 
• Time of C max (Tmax) 
• Time of C last (Tlast) 
• Time between the time of dosing and time of appearance of plasma concentration (T lag) 
The detailed methodology will be described in the SAP. 
9.12. Safety Analyses  
Safety will be assessed using the incidence of treatment -emergent AEs and SAEs, physical 
examination findings, growth parameters, vita l signs, clinical laboratory evaluations, and  ECGs .   
Results of all safety assessments will be liste d by [CONTACT_4676], and summarized by [CONTACT_862529] .  
These safety analyses will be compared qualitatively between groups; however, there will be no 
inferential statistical comparisons between  groups. 
Clinical Trial Protocol:  CAT -1004-301 16 April 2020 
Confidential and Proprietary 51 9.12.1. Physical Examination, Growth Parameters, Electrocardiograms,  and Vital Signs  
Physical examination  (general appearance, skin, HEENT, etc. ) abnormal results  will be summarized .  
Physical examination results will also be summarized in a shift table from Baseline. 
Growth parameters (height, weight, BMI) will be compared to age- normative percentiles.  
ECG results will be summarized at each timepoint, and also using shift tables from Baseline. 
Vital signs (temperature, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and systolic and diastolic blood pressure) , and 
changes from Baseline in vital signs,  will be summarized descriptively at Baseline and other study 
timepoints.  Data listings will be provided. 
9.12.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Values at all study timepoints and changes from Baseline to post Baseline timepoints in clinical 
chemistry, hematology and urinalysis results will be summarized descriptively .  Shift tables from 
Baseline to each timepoint and from Baseline to each patient’s final visit will be produced by [CONTACT_388349].   
Abnormal clinical laboratory values will be identified as outside (above or below) the normal range 
and will be evaluated for clinically notable abnormalities .  Reference (normal) ranges for laboratory 
parameters will be included in the clinical study report.   
9.12.3. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA® dictionary and will be categorized by [CONTACT_29974]  (SOC) and preferred term.  
An overall summary of TEAEs will include the number and percentage of patients in each cohort and 
overall reporting: 
• Any TEAEs  
• Treatment -related TEAEs  
• Severe TEAEs  
• Serious TEAEs, including any events resulting in death 
• Treatment -related serious TEAEs  
• TEAEs (and treatment -related TEAEs ) leading to discontinuation of study drug 
TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_9315] , with each patient counted only once for each 
AE reporting level.  TE AEs will also be summarized by [CONTACT_2946], preferred  term , and severity and by

Summary  of Changes                   16 April  2020   
Protocol Title: A Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, Global Phase  3 
Study of Edasalonexent in Pediatric Patients with Duchenne 
Muscular Dystrophy  
Protocol Number: CAT -1004-301 
Original Version Date : 09 July 2018 
Amendment :  [ADDRESS_1202427] during the COVID-19 pandemic:  
• As patients may not be able to come on -site for visits or for a reduced amount of time, 
modifications have been made to the original study procedures and schedule of assessments to reduce the patient’s risk or exposure to COVID -19 for Week 39 and 
Week 52 study visits. These include:  
o Allowance for the Week [ADDRESS_1202428] ed out of  the visit window (but 
in no case should the projected target date be changed by [CONTACT_726] 2 months ). 
o Ability to perform study procedures either on site or remotely by [CONTACT_862545]. 
o As the top priority is safety, assessing for AE and concomitant medications is 
the highest priority to continue, which will occur remotely at intervals. 
o Based on the safety profile of edasalonexent to date, and consideration that all patients in this study have been on study drug for [ADDRESS_1202429] according to local site procedures, including secured, temperature -controlled shipments to the patients’ homes 
o A prioritized list of assessments has been included in Appendix 2 of the 
protocol.  
• Clarification that post the COVID -19 pandemic, clinical monitoring may resume with 
more intense pace to clean all data accumulated.

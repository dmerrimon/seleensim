1. INTRODUCTION 
 
A relatively new bowel cleansi ng preparation for colonoscopy, S UPREP® Bowel Prep 
Kit, containing about 44 grams of s ulfate salts has been approv ed by [CONTACT_116100].  The  formulation depends on the o smotic activity of the 
sulfate anion. The formulation has been submitted to FDA as a new drug application 
(NDA 22-372).  Based on its safet y and efficacy in Phase I -III  studies (1), it is believed 
that an acceptable laxative dose may be achieved by [CONTACT_496141] e volume of solution 
administered. Patient toleran ce and safety are expected to be s uperior to over-the-counter 
(OTC) stimulant laxatives whic h are typi[INVESTIGATOR_19353] d efecation urgency and 
abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (e.g. bisacodyl). Stimulant laxatives produc e a bowel movement 
within several hours following a single treatment.  Because the  sulfate anion is poorly 
absorbed it acts primarily as a osmotic agent, in addition sulf ate containing laxatives have 
been reported to increase gast rointestinal t ransit (2,3).  
 Early evaluation of a reduced dose  of SUPREP for laxative use a nd its subsequent 
reformulation is described below.  
Preliminary Experience with the Experimental Formulation 
SUPREP® Bowel Prep Kit: a sulfate  based bowel preparation 
Several unpublished,  IRB approve d, studies were carried out by [CONTACT_830783] (John Fordtran, MD, B aylor University) to determine whether mixtures of 
sulfate salts that omit phosphates (which are avidly absorbed) can be effective to produce 
colonic purgation wit hout producing clinical ly significant electrolyte and fluid shifts.  
 
A study performed by [CONTACT_830784] a mixture of sulfate salts yield ing about 44 grams of sulfate 
anion (SUPREP), to Fleet Phospho- soda (EZ-Prep) and NuLYTELY in  normal volunteers 
(Baylor Study 006-181 and reference 4). The primary efficacy me asure was based on total  
 
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.  Confidential 
Protocol Number BLI801-203 
Version dated 4-27-2016   Page 7 of 42 stool output, with percentage of s tool solids (as described abo ve) serving as a secondary 
measurement. Five normal volunteers completed treatment with SU PREP, NuLYTELY 
and a Fleet Pharmaceuticals sodium phosphate preparation; EZ-Pr ep. SUPREP induced 
somewhat higher stool output c ompared to Fleet, yielding 2911g to Fleet’s 1986g. 
Measurement of the quantity of solids in the final bowel moveme nt after preparation 
(expressed as percent stool so lids) provided an indication of b owel cleansing efficacy.  
Stool solids also favored SUPREP over Fleet where SUPREP samples produced an 
average stool solids result of  1.6%, lower than the Fleet average of 4.1% and about the 
same as NuLYTELY (1.1%). The Fleet preparation induced signific ant losses of 
potassium and elevation of phosphate. This increased phosphate absorption contributed to 
a concomitant serum calcium re duction and CaXP elevation, consistent with previous 
literature reports and may be due to calcium phosphate precipi[INVESTIGATOR_332].  SUPREP study 
subjects absorbed about 4.2g of sulfate but no other clinically significant changes in serum or urine electrolytes were observed. Urine from SUPREP volunteers was shown to have a reduced tendency to prec ipi[INVESTIGATOR_830769].  Subject reported sid e effects did not show any diffe rences between the 
preparations. No unexpected or ser ious adverse events were reported. 
 
Studies in rats and dogs (5) demons trated that the SUPREP formulation did not induce 
soft tissue calcification as  occurs for the phosphate based pre parations.  These 
observations and the safety of the  sulfate formulation were confirmed in studies of 
patients with renal and hepatic failure (6). 
 
Two Phase 3 studies were conducte d comparing SUPREP to the FDA approved 
preparation MoviPrep in a to tal of 751 patients requiring colonoscopy (1). The BLI800-
301 study evaluated SUPREP as a one-day preparation, completed on the day prior to 
colonoscopy. The BLI800-302 study u tilized a two-day (or “split -dose”) regimen in which 
half the preparation was take n the evening prior to colonoscopy , and the remaining half 
completed on the morning of the procedure.

(3) P-value for the non-inferiority hypothesis using an equival ence margin of 15 percent 
 
The data indicate that a two da y preparation regimen, as performed in the 302 study, 
produces markedly superior clean sing results over a one day pre paration, as in the 301 
study. In each study and overall, SUPREP achieved a greater number of excellent preparations than MoviPrep. This difference resulted in a highe r Mean Preparation Score 
for SUPREP, reaching statistical significance (p = 0.049) in th e total population.  
 
Adverse events were also evaluat ed in the Phase [ADDRESS_1153259] inal, and included the expected 
events of overall discomfort, abdominal pain and distension, na usea, and vomiting. No 
clinically significant differences between groups were seen in laboratory testing of  serum chemistry and hematology. At the  one month follow-up visit, no change in serum creatinine 
was observed for SU PREP patients.

The results described above indicated that a reduced dose of su lfate salts may safely 
provide relief for patients w ith constipation.  A randomized, o pen-label pi[INVESTIGATOR_830770] i n 60 constipated patient s (Braintree Study  BLI801-101). SUPREP 
was administered at four di fferent dose levels (1.2g, 3.7g, 6.2g and 8.7 grams of sulfate 
salts) as a single dose of solu tion to evaluate product efficac y to induce bowel movements 
within [ADDRESS_1153260] (5), the 
1.2g dose was chosen as a placebo dose.  Patient tolerance and safety were expected to be 
superior to over-the-counter (OTC) stimulant laxatives (e.g. bi sacodyl).  
 
As shown in Table [ADDRESS_1153261] one

the number having a bowel moveme nt within three  hours increased  with increasing dose.

to exclude magnesium sulfate.  T his was evaluated in a single center study comparing 
sulfate salt compositions containing 43.8mM (4.2g) or 80mM (7.7g) sulfate to 10mg 
bisacodyl (Baylor Study 008-211).  The compositions were tested  in seven normal 
volunteers for efficacy to induce a rapid, controlled bowel mov ement without significant 
gains or losses of electrolytes . Volunteers were given a single  dose in an in-patient setting 
during which all stool and urine were collected for [ADDRESS_1153264] laxatives. Gastrointestinal 
symptoms were similar between t he 10mg bisacodyl and the sulfat e formulations and no 
unexpected adverse events were reported. A formulation providin g a 3:1 ratio of sodium 
to potassium minimized sodium and potassium electrolyte absorpt ion or loss from the 
laxative and was considered appropriate for further study in co nstipated patients at a dose 
of about 60mM (5.8 grams sulfate).   A pi[INVESTIGATOR_830772] d sulfate solution (BLI801 Laxa tive) was conducted to 
evaluate a seven day treatment of the BLI801 Laxative in adult outpatients meeting 
ROME III constipation criteria .  The intent of this multi-center study was to determine the

Version dated 4-27-2016   Page 11 of 42 efficacy of the laxative as both a one day and a seven day therapy.  33 patients received 
BLI801 laxative and 19 received placebo (a solution of sodium c hloride).   
The primary endpoint of the st udy was the percentage of patients experiencing a bowel 
movement within [ADDRESS_1153265] study medication dose.  Th e co-primary endpoint 
was the percentage of patients w ith a successful treatment week , defined as not meeting 
ROME III criteria at the end of the treatment week. Seventy per cent of patients that 
received BLI801 Laxative had a bowel movement within 3 hours ve rsus 53% of placebo 
patients (p=0.412).  The rapid eff ect of BLI801 Laxative was mo re predictable over the 
treatment week, with significantl y more BLI801 Laxative patients having a bowel

There were no statistically si gnificant differences between BLI801 Laxative and placebo

differences seen for the expecte d patient reported symptoms of gas and crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (rated 
using a five point scale ranging f rom “1=None” to “5=Severely D istressing”).  More 
patients experienced watery sto ols in the BLI801 group, which i s expected due to its 
laxative effect. There were no s erious adverse events during th e study and no on-study 
deaths.  Laboratory results s howed no differences between BLI801 Laxative and Placebo 
for serum chemistry data, including sulfate.

Version dated 4-27-2016   Page 12 of 42 A second Phase 2 study was conducted to evaluate two dose level s of BLI801 Laxative 
taken on an as needed, or “on dem and” basis for 4 weeks. Patients were instructed to take up 
to one full dose of BLI801 Laxative if they felt they needed relief of their constipation 
symptoms. Sixty constipated patients meeting ROME III criteria completed the protocol.  
Their average age was 43 years and study participants were pred ominantly female (88%). 
Subjects in both the high and low dose group averaged [ADDRESS_1153268] to overall treatment success which was defined as > 3 complete spontaneous bowel 
movements (CSBMs) during a given treatment week with an accompa nying increase of at 
least 1 CSBM from baseline fo r that week for 3 out of 4 weeks of treatment.  The low 
dose group had about 35.5% of study subjects with a successful outcome according to this 
definition versus 38.7% for the hi gher dose. When a lower success threshold was applied 
(2 out of 4 successful weeks), the high dose group had a succes s rate of 58% compared to 
42% in the low dose group.   As shown in Table 5, the higher dose was associated with many m ore patients having a 
BM within three hours of dose ingestion (55%) than the lower do se (29%). This 
difference persisted when a more strict definition of complete,  spontaneous BMs was 
applied.

4.1. Visit 1: Screening  
At the screening visit, the fo llowing procedures will be undert aken: 
 Subject is fully informed about the study and gives written agr eement to study 
participation in the form of a signed informed consent form (re fer to Section 4.1.1) and 
assign a subject number 
 Assess eligibility (refer to i nclusion/exclusion criteria) 
 Review of medications 
 Medical history including histor y of constipation (ROME criteri a) 
 Physical examination (in cluding height and body weight) 
 Vital signs: including temperatur e, weight, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_92196], and an assessment 
of orthostatic hypotension (wh ile seated and after standing for  a minimum of 2 minutes)  
 A 12-lead ECG will be performed by [CONTACT_3784], trained site pers onnel.  ECG output must 
be reviewed by a physician investigator (MD only). Any clinically significant cardiac 
abnormalities identified on the ECG should disqualify a subject. Data from the ECG will be collected in the eCRF. 
 Blood and urine samples will be collected for testing at a cent ral laboratory, as shown 
below.  
Chemistry:  alkaline phosphatase, ALT, anion gap, AST, bicarbonate, blood urea 
nitrogen (BUN), calcium, chloride,  creatine kinase (CK), creati nine, eGFR, GGT, 
HCG,  inorganic phosphate, ioni zed calcium, magnesium, osmolali ty, potassium, 
sodium,  sulfate and uric acid. CK-MB will be tested in samples  where the CK 
value is greater than 2.5 times the upper normal limit. 
Hematology:  hematocrit, hemoglobin, platel ets count, red blood cell count,  white 
blood cell count (and differentials) Urinalysis: including electrolyte s (sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium),  
microscopic analysis, urine osmolality 
 
Subjects with clinically significant laboratory abnormalities, deemed as a potential 
safety issue by [CONTACT_737] , may be discontinued at the Investigator’s 
discretion.  
 Provide the subject an electroni c diary and review instructions  with the subject in detail to 
ensure full understandin g (refer to Section 4.1.3).

are experiencing severe discomf ort due to their constipation, o r have not had a BM in 4 
days. 
 Instruct subject to maintain the ir normal dietary habits during  study participation. 
 Schedule the next study visit to occur after 21 full screening days.  
 
Subjects that are ineligible due  to prohibited medication use ( Exclusion Criteria 5 and 9) 
must be washed out for a period of [ADDRESS_1153277] 
completed washout (laboratory test ing must be repeated after washout if done at Visit 1).  
Subjects will receive a reminder card detailing the washout per iod.   Rescue bisacodyl will 
not be dispensed at this visit.  When subjects return following  washout, concomitant 
medications should be reviewed, physical exam and vital signs should be performed (if not done previously).   
4.1.1.  Informed Consent 
Following the informed consent p rocess, study subjects will sig n a current IRB approved 
consent form. No study  procedures may be performed prior to the  subject providing 
informed consent. The subject’s original signed and personally dated Informed Consent 
Form (together with any subsequent IRB approved amended versions) must be retained by [CONTACT_148999]’s file.  A copy of the original  signed and dated Informed 
Consent Form must be given to the subject. 
4.1.2. Enrollment and Allocation of Subject Number 
Subjects will be enrolled into the study only when they have given their written, informed 
consent to participate. 
Subjects enrolled at the screening visit will be assigned a sub ject number by [CONTACT_8786].  
This number will consist of:  
 The 3-digit Site Number;  
 A 3-digit subject identifier number (this number is a sequentia lly allocated number). Each 
site will begin with [ADDRESS_1153278] diary to se lf-report their bowel 
movement and rescue medication experiences each day. Subjects w ill be required to enter 
data on each bowel movement as soon as possible following completion. This data will 
include assessments of BM comple teness, consistency, straining and urgency.  
Each dosing epi[INVESTIGATOR_830158]. Instr uctions on how to 
complete the diary questions will be supplied in a separate man ual.  
4.2. Visit 2: Randomization 
Subjects will return to the study center as soon as possible af ter the 21 day Screening 
Period for Visit 2.  
 
BM Entry Criteria  – to be eligible for randomization, subjects must meet the following 
criteria related to the ir Screening Period BMs: 
 average of fewer than 3 spontan eous bowel movements (SBMs) per week during 
the last 2 weeks of the 21 day Scr eening Period. An SBM is defi ned as a bowel 
movement which has occurred with  no rescue laxative use in the prior 24 hours. 
 No more than 1 SBM with a Bri stol Stool rating of 6 
 No SBMs with a Bristol  Stool rating of 7 
 Diary Compliance Criterion  – to be eligible for randomiz ation, a subject must have 
completed an average of [ADDRESS_1153279] 2 weeks of  the 21 day Screening Period.  
 Vital signs will be taken. Subj ects will be queried for any adverse events or changes to 
their concomitant medicatio ns (including ongoing opi[INVESTIGATOR_40533]). Subjects will complete 
the Patient Assessment of Constip ation Quality of Life question naire (PAC-QOL, refer to 
Appendix A) and the Patient Assessm ent of Constipation Symptom questionnaire (PAC-
SYM, refer to Appendix B).

Version dated 4-27-2016   Page 21 of 42 4.2.1. Randomization 
Subjects that meet the BM and Diary Compliance Criteria will be  randomized using an 
automated interactive web response system (IWRS). The randomiza tion schedule will be 
implemented in the automated interactive web response (IWR) sys tem prior to kit 
distribution to the site. At the time of randomization the IWRS  will assign a drug kit 
number for site personnel to disp ense to the subject. Dispensin g kits out of order is 
considered a protocol violation.  
4.2.1. Study Medication 
During Visit 2, subjects will be provided with instructions on how to take the study 
medication. A [ADDRESS_1153280]. Subjects 
will take a daily dose of study medication (6 tablets) as neede d to treat constipation 
symptoms. Daily dosing is not required.   Subjects will also be dispense d bisacodyl (5 mg)  tablets at ea ch study visit. Subjects will 
be instructed to take 5 – 10mg of bisacodyl if they are experiencing severe discomfort due to their constipation, or have  not had a BM in [ADDRESS_1153281] 2 consecutive daily d oses of study medication.  
 
Subjects will be instructed to r eturn all medication (including  bisacodyl) and components 
at Visit 3.  
4.3. Treatment Period 
4.3.1. Electronic Subject Diary during Treatment Period 
 
Each day during the Treatment Period, subjects will complete th eir e-diary reporting. 
Subjects will report each bowel m ovement as it occurs along wit h related symptoms and 
characteristics (consistency, s training, urgency, completeness) . Subjects will also report 
their daily study medication and r escue medication doses (if applicable) as t hey occur, and 
the reason for taking the dose (e g, subject felt constipated, subject didn’t have a BM 
today, etc). On days in which no dos ing was reported, subjects will be prompted to answer 
why they felt like they did not need a dose that day.

5.1. Adverse Event Definition and Reporting 
 
An Adverse Event (AE) is any unt oward medical occurrence associ ated with the use  
of a drug in humans, whether or not  considered drug related. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign ( including a clinically signifi cant abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease tem porally associated with the us e of a medicinal 
(investigational) product.  
 
Adverse event collection will coincide with the patient providi ng informed consent to 
participate in the study and w ill conclude with the end of stud y participation at Day 98 (2 
week follow-up phone call).  Diarrhea should be reported as an adverse event if a patient 
has more than 3 watery stools pe r day (Bristol Stool Rating = 7 ). Patients with clinically 
significant laboratory results at Visit 5 which are classified by [CONTACT_830786] a r epeat blood draw. Patients w ill be instructed to report promptly 
adverse events to the Investigat or. The Investigator will recor d date/time of re port, date/time 
of onset, description of the adverse event, severity of adverse  event, action(s) taken regarding 
treatment of the event, action(s) taken regarding study partici pation, duration of adverse 
event, and the Investig ator's assessment of relationship of adv erse event to study treatment. 
 
The Investigator should assess th e severity of each adverse eve nt using the following 
categories: 
 
Grade Severity Description  
1 
 Mild Barely noticeable, does not influence functioning Causing no limitations of usual activities 
2 Moderate Makes participant uncomfortable, influences functioning Causing some limitations of usual activities 
3 
Severe Severe discomfort, treatment needed Severe and undesirable, causi ng inability to c arry out usual 
Activities 
4 Life 
threatening Immediate risk of death Life threatening or disabling 
5 Fatal Causes death of the participant

the following categories: 
 
Categories of 
Attribution:  Description 
UNRELATED  There is no evidence of any causal relationship. 
POSSIBLE There is some  evidence to suggest a causa l relationship (e.g., the 
event occurred within a reasonabl e time after administration of  
the trial medication). How ever, the influence of other factors 
may have contributed  to the event (e.g., the patient’s clinical 
condition, other concomitant events). 
PROBABLE There is evidence  to suggest a causal relationship, and the 
influence of other factors is unlikely. 
DEFINITE There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and 
other possible contributing factors can be ruled out .

6. SERIOUS ADVERSE REACTIONS AND DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY 
 
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrenc e that results in at 
least one of the following outcomes: 
 Results in death 
 Is life-threatening 
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37511] 
 A persistent or significant incap acity or substantial disruptio n of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 Requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage 
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.  Confidential 
Protocol Number BLI801-203 
Version dated 4-27-2016   Page 28 of 42  
 SAE collection will coincide with  the patient providing informed consent to participate in 
the study and will conclude 30 days after a patient’s last dose  of study medication.  Should 
a serious and/or unexpected adverse event occur, the Investigat or must notify Braintree 
Laboratories immediately.  The Investigator will make a decision regarding continuing the 
subject’s study participation, and may request input from Brain tree Laboratories. The 
Investigator will be responsible for recommending or providing the subject with appropriate 
medical therapy. All subjects expe riencing serious adverse even ts will be followed until 
satisfactory resolution occurs. Braintree Laboratories must be kept apprised of all follow-ups 
relative to serious adverse eve nts. In addition, Investigators must comply with the SAE 
reporting requirements of the Institutional Review Board with o versight of the study. 
 
Any serious and/or unexpected adver se events that occur during the study will be reported 
to Braintree Laboratories as follows:

9.1. Sample Size 
Four hundred subjects will be randomly assigned to BLI801 Laxat ive (one of 3 doses) or 
placebo in a ratio of 1:1:1:1 (100 subjects per group).  The de finition of a weekly 
responder is based on weekly assess ments of spontaneous bowel m ovements (SBMs).  
Based on data from a previous Phase 2 study, it is anticipated that approximately 50% of 
subjects would be classified as responders in the  BLI801 arm, with a placebo response up 
to 30% (based on placebo response in recent Phase 3 studies wit h the same endpoint) 
(REF). The proposed study size will have greater than 80% power to detect a difference of 
20% between the active and placebo groups at a one-sided signif icance level of 0.05. 
 
9.2. Null and Alternative Hypotheses 
The primary objective of this stud y is to compare the safety an d efficacy of BLI801 
Laxative to placebo in patients with opi[INVESTIGATOR_830782] n. To establish this, the 
primary comparison of interest will be on the overall responder  percentage based on [ADDRESS_1153289] who has ≥ 3  SBMs and an increase 
from baseline of > 1 SBM in that week. 
The null hypothesis will be that there is no difference in the response rates between 
BLI801 Laxative and placebo, the alternative hypothesis being t hat the response rate is 
higher for BLI801 Laxative than for placebo.  
9.3. Planned Analyses  
9.3.1.   Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Baseline comparability of the fo llowing demographic and baselin e characteristics for the 
treatment groups will be performed.

 Gender (CMH Chi square) 
 Race/ethnicity (CMH Chi square)

Version dated 4-27-2016   Page 31 of 42  Constipation History (ANOVA) 
 Screening spontaneous bowel movement frequency (ANOVA) 
 Screening rescue bisacodyl use (ANOVA) 
 
9.3.2. Efficacy Analyses 
 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed on the basis of a binary outcome of overall 
treatment success or failure. The primary efficacy endpoint wil l be proportion of subjects 
who are weekly responders for [ADDRESS_1153290] who has 
an average of ≥ 3 SBMs/week and an average increase from baseli ne of > 1 SBM/week in 
that week. A SBM is a bowel movement that occurs with no rescue  laxative use in the 
previous 24 hours.  
Superiority Hypothesis: 
The primary endpoint of treatment success will be based upon th e difference D=P 1-P2, 
where P 1 is the observed success fraction in the BLI801 Laxative group (experimental 
group) and P 2 is the observed success fracti on in the placebo group (control  group).  The 
procedure tests the null hypothesis 
H0: π1-π2=0 
versus the alternative hypothesis 
H1: π1-π2 ≠0, 
where π [ADDRESS_1153291] the null hypothesis of  superiority separately for the comparisons of individual 
BLI801 Laxative dose levels versus placebo.  We will preserve the family-wise type I error rate at 5% using the Bonferroni approach, conducting each  test at the 2.5% two-
sided level.  If multiple comparisons are significant, we will conduct a test comparing the 
two dose levels of BLI800 at the two-sided 5% level.  As we wil l only perform this test 
conditionally on the other tests be ing significant, it has no effect on the family-wise type I 
error rate, and so it requires no further multiplicity adjustment. 
Braintree Laboratories, Inc.  Confidential 
Protocol Number BLI801-203 
Version dated 4-27-2016   Page 32 of 42 The following equatio n will be used to calculate the weekly SBM  frequency: 
SBM frequency = 7 X (Number of SBMs/number of days with non-mis sing SBM 
assessments)  
 
If a subject has fewer than four days of data observed for a we ek, then that subject’s data 
should be considered missing for t h a t  e n t i r e  w e e k  a n d  t h e  s u b j e ct considered a non-
responder. The primary efficacy endpoint w ill be analyzed using the CMH te st controlling for the effect 
of study center. The presence of a treatment-by-center interact ion will be investigated by [CONTACT_725682]-Day test of homogeneity of odds ratio.  The strategy fo r pooling centers will be 
based on geographical  considerations, with low enrolling center s pooled by [CONTACT_555768].  Details of any pooling performed will be documented pr ior to database lock and 
unblinding of the study. No bowel movements that occur wi thin 24 hours of a rescue bisac odyl (or other prohibited 
laxative) dose will be included in primary or secondary efficac y analyses.  
Secondary endpoints will i nclude the following: 
 Overall response by [CONTACT_547] a nd age group (< 65, > 65 years) 
 Number of study medication doses taken per week (mean) 
 Number of rescue bisacodyl dos es taken per week (mean) 
 % of subjects not meeting ROME criteria at the end of each trea tment week 
 Mean Time to BM after dose  
 Weekly stool consistency 
 Number of BMs with str aining per week (mean) 
 SBM frequency rates during e ach week (weeks 1 to 12) 
 BM urgency score per week (mean) 
 Bristol Stool Form score per week (mean)

Analysis of safety will be performe d using the Intent to Treat population (see Section 9.4). 
 
Adverse Events 
Adverse Events will be coded us ing the MedDRA classification to  p r o v i d e  a  p r e f e r r e d  
term and primary system organ class for each event.  Proportion s of subjects with adverse 
events will be presented by [CONTACT_1570].  Tables of AEs wil l be presented by [CONTACT_53428], and include overall totals for AEs within each system 
organ class.  Counting will be done by [CONTACT_740470] .  A table of counts and 
percentages will also be made of those subjects with SAEs or AEs which led to 
withdrawal from the study.  
Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as adverse events that had a n onset day and time on 
or after the day and time of th e first dose of study drug up to  3 0  d a y s  a f t e r  t h e  l a s t  
application of treatment.  Adverse Events having missing onset dates will be considered 
as treatment emergent. The difference in adverse event rates between study groups will  be tested by [CONTACT_177610]-Square 
or Fisher’s exact test with 95%  confidence intervals. Adverse e vents will be presented for 
the overall Treatment Period. 
Laboratory Parameters  
Summary statistics (i.e., mean, mi nimum, maximum, standard devi ation, and number of 
subjects) will be presented for each treatment group for each l aboratory parameter at each 
visit.  When calculating the su mmary statistics only, the last observation within a visit 
window will be used if there are multiple observations.  Change s from baseline will be 
presented in a similar format.  An additional listing will be p rovided of those subjects who

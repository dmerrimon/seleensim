IIT-ATALLAHBLACKRASPBERR Y Version Date:  12/29/17     Active infection not well controlled by [CONTACT_627787].  
 
Pregnant or lactating women.  
 
Participation in clinical trials with other investigational agents not 
included in this trial, wit hin 14 days of the start of this trial and 
throughout the duration of this trial.  
 
Patients with allergies to other members of the Rosacea family 
including but not limited to: apple, almond, apricot, cloudberry, 
blackberry, etc.  
Study Rationale  Hypomethylating  agents  (HMAs ), such as azacitidine and 
decitabine, are FDA -approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_627768]. 
Approximately 50% of patients respond to HMAs. In addition, HMAs 
have  improved survival and quality of life of patients with MDS when 
compared with other  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Preclinical research shows black raspberries (BRBs) have 
hypomethylating effects in the colon, blood, spleen and bone 
marrow of mice treated with BRBs. The aim of this study is to 
evaluate the hypomethylating properties of BRBs in patients with  
MDS or  MDS /MPN  for three  cycles ( one cycle = 28 days ) of BRB 
supplementation.  
Primary Objectives  To evaluate the potential hypomethylating effects of freeze- dried 
black raspberries (BRBs) in the peripheral blood of patients wit h 
myelodysplastic syndrome or myelodysplastic syndrome 
/myeloproliferative neoplasm  (MDS/MPN ) after three cycles of BRB 
administration.  
Secondary Objectives 1. To evaluate the toxicity of BRBs in patients with MDS  or 
MDS/MPN. 
2. To evaluate the hematological response according to modified IWG criteria  (Appendix  2) in patients  with MDS  
or MDS/MPN 
regardless  of the initial blood count.  
Study Design This is a phase II single- group pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. This trial is designed to 
evaluate efficacy and methylation. This study’s overarching aim  is to 
evaluate the systemic effects  of BRBs  in patients  with MDS  or 
MDS/ MPN . 
Study Agent/ Intervention Description  This protocol dictates the use of freeze- dried black raspberry 
powder. Twenty -five grams of fre eze-dried BRBs will be mixed with 
approximately  8 ounces  of water ; subjects will consume 25 grams  
orally  two times a  day. 
Number of Patients  The study team will enroll 18 patients with MDS  or MDS/MPN . 
Subject Participation Duration  After th ree and six cycles of treatment, if patients are benefi ting from 
the regimen, they continue treatment for a total maximum of 12 
cycles. 
7 
IIT-ATALLAHBLACKRASPBERR Y Version Date:  12/29/17    Duration of Follow up  Follow -up is required  30 days  (+4 days)  from treatment 
discontinuation.  
Estimated Time to 
Complete Enrollment:  The study will reach accrual approximately [ADDRESS_836338]  any adverse events.  
Efficacy Assessments Peripheral blood samples will be collected day 1 of cycles 1 –4, 7, 
10, and end of treatment  for evaluation of methylation status of 
mononuclear cells. Assays will include  plasma uptake  of berry  
components,  measurement  of berry  anthocyanins  in urine, isolation 
of peripheral blood monocytes and analysis of DNA methylation.  
Unique Aspects of this Study  This study will test the novel suppressive role of  black raspberries.

1  BACKGROUND  
Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)  
 
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of bone marrow disorders characterized by 
[CONTACT_627788] (AML). ( 1) Each year, an 
estimated 10,000 new patients with MDS above the age of 65 are diagnosed. ( 2) Clinicians use 
the French- American -British (FAB) and the World Health Organization (WHO) systems, in 
addition to the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), to classify MDS . (3) The latter is 
the most commonly used prognostic scoring system, and it includes the percentage of blasts/morphology, number of cytopenias and cytogenetic abnormalities. The IPSS system divides patients into four prognostic groups — low, intermediate -1, intermediate -2 and high -risk 
disease. The median survival is 4.8, 2.7, 1.1 and 0.5 years for patients >60 years old with low, intermediate- 1, intermediate- 2 and high- risk disease, respectively. The median age at diagnosis 
for patients with MDS is 76 years and 86% of patients are above the age of 65 . (2) As most 
patients with MDS are older, therapy with a low toxicity would be desirable for this patient population.  
 
Current therapy for MDS  
 
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only cure for MDS. Clinicians also have other therapy options that correspond with disease risk in treating MDS. For example, 
supporti ve care, which may consist of transfusions and growth factors therapy, remains the 
backbone of low -risk MDS treatment . (4) 5q- syndrome patients are treated with antithymocyte 
globulin therapy and lenalidomide. ( 5) Azacitidine or decitabine ( 6,7) are first -line therapi[INVESTIGATOR_627770]-risk disease patients who can tolerate them. Azacitidine, decitabine, and lenalidomide are 
FDA-approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_627771]. The first two drugs are hypomethylating agents 
(HMAs). HMAs have yielded a response rate ranging from 30– 50% for an average of 12 months 
in MDS patients.  
 
Treatment of MDS or MDS/MPN with Hypomethylating Agents  
 
Genetic and epi[INVESTIGATOR_627772]. Genetic alterations 
include mutations or deletions that alter the primary sequence of DNA. In contrast, epi[INVESTIGATOR_627773]. DNA 
methylation and alteration of the histone code are two epi[INVESTIGATOR_627774]. Reversal of this process with hypomethylating 
agents results not only in gene expression reactivation but in k illing of leukemic cells, a 
phenomenon that has been widely exploited in human clinical trials . (8–10) Hypomethylating 
agents  5-azacytidine (azacitidine) and 5 -aza-2'-deoxycytidine (decitabine)  are approved by [CONTACT_43657] (FDA) for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). 
Both agents were initially developed as cytarabine derivatives with initially disappointing results, 
especially at higher concentrations. However, in follow -up studies and  with lower -dose 
schedules, both drugs have shown efficacy in MDS.  
 
In a randomized Phase III trial (AZA -001) conducted by [CONTACT_627789] ( 6) in patients with high- risk 
MDS, patients were randomized to receive azacitidine (75 mg/m2 per day for seven days every 
28 days) or conventional care (best supportive care, low -dose cytarabine, or intensive 
chemotherapy , as selected by [CONTACT_627790]). At a median follow -up of 21.1 
months, the median overall survival was 24. 5 months (9.9 – not reached) for the azacitidine 
17 
IIT-ATALLAHBLACK RASPBERRY  Version Date:  12/29/17     
group versus 15. 0 months (5.6 – 24.1 months) for the conventional care group ( p=0.0001). 
Azacitidine was given for a median of nine cycles (4 –15), and 86% of the patients who received 
azacitidi ne remained on 75 mg/m2 per day throughout the study with no dose adjustments. In 
patients with −7/del(7q), the median overall survival was 13. 1 months (3.9 – 24.5 months) in the 
azacitidine group (n=30) compared with 4.6 months in the conventional care group. The median 
time to AML transformation was 17.8 months in the azacitidine group compared with 11.5 months 
in the conventional care group (CCR) ( p < 0.0001). The duration of hematological response (CR, 
PR and any hematological improvement) was also significantly longer in the azacitidine group 
(median 13.6 months) than in the CCR group (5.2 months; p=0.0002). Median duration of CR 
plus PR in the azacitidine group was 3.2 months versus 3.0 months ( p=0.48) in the CCR group. 
Factors affecting survival in t hat study were PS, presence of circulating blasts, RBC TD ≥ 4 units 
in eight  weeks and cytogenetics. Based on these four factors, patients were subdivided into low - 
intermediate- and high-risk groups with median survival of not reached, 15 months and 6.1 
months, respectively . (11) This confirmed that treatment with azacitidine prolongs overall survival 
and lowers the risk of progression to AML in patients with higher -risk MDS compared with 
treatment with CCR.  
 
Decitabine was evaluated in two large phase III trials . (12,13) In the first study performed in the 
US, 170 patients were randomized to receive either BSC or decitabine 15 mg/m2 three times 
daily x 3 days repeated every six weeks. The ORR for patients receiving  decitabine was 30% 
(9%CR, 8% PR and13% HI ). (12) Using a similar decitabine schedule, Lubbert et al . reported an  
ORR of 34% (CR13%, PR 6%, and HI 15 %). (13) However , in both studies there was no 
difference in overall survival in patients receiving decitabine in this schedule when compared to 
BSC. In order to better define the best dose schedule for decitabine, Kantarjian et al .  
randomized patients with MDS to one of three decitabine schedules: 20 mg/m2 intravenously 
daily for five days, 20mg/m2 subcutaneously daily for five days and 10 mg/m2 intravenously daily 
for 10 days . (14) In that study, patients randomized to the 20 mg/m2 intravenously daily for five  
days had the highest CR rate (39%) and this was chosen as the basis for a multicenter phase II 
study, the ADOPT trial . (7) In the ADOPT trial,  decitabine 20 mg/m2 was administered to 99 
patients with MDS. As previously mentioned, the ORR was 51% (17% CR, 15 mCR and 18 HI). 
Most responses were seen after two cycles (82%), and the median duration of response was 10 
months. The -one-year survival was 66% and the median overall survival was 19.4 months.  
 
The myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm category  was introduced in the 
thirdrevision on the WHO classification. This group includes chronic myelomonocytic leukemia  
(CMM L), atypi[INVESTIGATOR_443839], MDS/MPN unclassified and juvenile my elomono cytic leukemia (JMML) . 
Hypomethylating agents have shown in the therapy of those diseases  (34-35).  
 
Azacitidine and decitabine are associated with significant toxicities  
 
Although both azacitidine and decitabine are effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_627775], they are 
associated with significant toxicities. In the AZA -001 trial ( 6) previously mentioned, 91%, 85% 
and 57% of patients developed grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, anemia or thrombocytopenia,  
respectively. In the ADOPT trial , (7) 31%, 18% and 12% of patients receiving decitabine 
developed grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia , respectively. In addition, 
other nonhematologic toxicity occurring in > 10% of patients included fatigue, nausea, fever, diarrhea, constipation, pneumonia, vomiting and chills.  
 Even though the quality of life of patients receiving azacitidine or decitabine is better when 
compared with patients receiving BSC only , (15) it is still significantly affected by [CONTACT_627791][INVESTIGATOR_6042]. Azacitidine is administered IV or SQ for five or seven consecutive days each 
18 
IIT-ATALLAHBLACK RASPBERRY  Version Date:  12/29/[ADDRESS_836350] hypomethylating effects in colon cancer patients .  
(16) In a study, 20 patients with colorectal cancer were treated with BRBs before sur gical 
resection of the tumor. BRBs exerted hypomethylating effects in the adjacent normal mucosa in all patients and in carcinomas only in patients with > 4 weeks of therapy . (17) These 
observations on the hypomethylating effects of BRBs with prolonged therapy are consistent with what is seen in patients with MDS treated with hypomethylating agents. In almost all patients, two 
to three  cycles are needed (up to six cycles) before a response is seen in patients receiving 
either azacitidine or decitabine. This hypomethylating effect in colon cancer is most likely due to 
local effect of the BRBs on colon cells. However, BRBs are systemically absorbed and have 
been shown to have a systemic hypomethylating effect. In the colon cancer study previously 
mentioned, none of the patients in that study had detectable urinary levels of BRB -derived 
anthocyanins before therapy, while all had detectable levels in urine after administration of BRBs , 
confirming the systemic absorption of BRBs. In addition, the systemic hypomethylating effects of BRBs have been demonstrated in IL- [ADDRESS_836351] in the colon, bone marrow and spleen of mice.  
(16) This confirmed the absorption and hypomethylation effect of BRBs in the colon, spleen and 
bone marrow of mice fed a 5% BRB powder diet for four weeks . (18)  
 In a study by [CONTACT_627792] ., the median time to any response was two cycles (range 1– 16). 
Overall, 91% of patients achieved best response by [CONTACT_627793]. Based on that, we will discontinue 
therapy for patients who do not achieve a response after six cycles. Response defined as CR, PR 
or HI  (see appendix 2) . (364)  Our aim in this study is to evaluate the systemic effects of BRBs in 
patients with MDS  or MDS/MPN . 
 
Black raspberry dose 
 
One of the most desirable features of a chemopreventive agent is little or no toxicity at concentrations producing chemopreventive efficacy. The toxicity of BRBs has been evaluated in rats fed a synthetic diet (AIN -76A diet) plus either 5% or 10% BRB powder by [CONTACT_8497] (w/w) for up 
to nine months . (19) These percentages of BRB powder in a rat diet would be equivalent to 
approximately 0.9 to 1.8 ounces  (25.5  to 51 grams ) of BRB powder in the daily human diet, as 
calculated on a body surface area basis. Histopathologic studies indicated that these BRB diets 
did not produce toxic effects in any major organs of the animals, and there were no significant 
differences in either body weight or food consumption between rats on either of the BRB - 
supplemented diets versus control rats on the AIN -76A-alone diet during the nine- month 
treatment . (19) 
 
In humans, a phase I trial evaluated the safety and tolerability of BRB powder ( 45 g as a slurry in 
water daily for seven days) in healthy participants and results suggested that berries were well  
tolerated. In a subsequent pi[INVESTIGATOR_627776] (32 or 45g/day for six months) in 
Barrett's esophagus patients, BRBs were tolerated as well . (20) In that study, three  of the 20 
patients enrolled reported side effects that were likely related to BRBs. The reported side effects 
were epi[INVESTIGATOR_50684], diarrhea and constipation; all were grade I.  
 
Further, the daily dose of BRBs at 60 g ( 20 g x 3) was well tolerated in colon cancer patients 
19 
IIT-ATALLAHBLACK RASPBERRY  Version Date:  12/29/17    (60g/day for one to nine weeks) and BRBs produced hypomethylating effects in colon cancer 
patients received average four weeks of BRBs in comparison to those received two weeks of 
BRBs; suggesting accumulating effects . (17) Also, using a daily dose of 60 g, BRBs were 
tolerated in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) in a nine- month intervention 
study, and BRBs led to fewer and smaller polyps through hypomethylation. ( 21) The m ost recent 
unpublished data suggest that 50 g BRBs per day ( 25 g x 2) were tolerated in ulcerative colitis 
patients for  a period of six months. Accordingly, we chose 50 g (25g x 2) daily BRBs to be tested 
in MDS patients. We anticipated that BRBs  will be tolerated and exert hypomethylating effects in 
MDS patients.  
 
Preclinical Data  
 
As stated above, many berry components have demonstrated chemopreventive activity in animals.  
 
Kresty et al. reported in 2001 ( 22) that freeze- dried BRBs are a source of multiple nutrient and 
non-nutritive compounds, including vitamins A, C, E and folic acid; calcium; selenium; β - 
sitosterol, ellagic acid, ferulic acid, quercetin and certain anthocyanins (see Appendix 3). Many 
of these agents showed chemopreventive activity, both in vitro and in animal models. Their 
modes of action include inhibition of carcinogen activation and stimulation of carcinogen 
detoxification. In addition, they reduce the binding of the reactive metabolites of car cinogens to 
DNA, down regulate genes associated with cancer development, upregulate of genes involved in cell- cycle control and stimulate apoptosis and inhibit angiogenesis ( 19,23–25). 
 
In addition, ellagitannins in raspberries have been shown to inhibit phorbol ester -induced DNA 
synthesis and ornithine decarboxylase activity . (26) More specifically, the inhibition of 
mutagenesis and carcinogenesis by [CONTACT_627794], stimulation of carcinogen detoxification, interference in the binding of 
reactive metabolites of carcinogens to DNA and downregulation of certain genes associated 
with cancer development . (25,27 ,28) 
 
Black raspberries’ chemopreventive effects were clearly demonstrated in a study by [CONTACT_627795]. 
The investigators first induced colon tumors in the Fischer 344 rat by [CONTACT_627796] (AOM). BRBs markedly decreased aberrant crypt foci (ACF), the precursor of invasive colon tumors, in the rat. ACF multiplicity 
decreased 36%, 24% and 21% in the 2.5%, 5% and 10% BRB diet groups, respectively, relative 
to the AOM -only group. Total tumor multiplicity declined 42%, 45% and 71% in these same 
groups, and decreases in overall tumor burden (28%, 42% and 75%) were observed ( 29). 
 
Other studies evidenced that dietary freeze- dried strawberries and BRBs inhibited N - 
nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBA) -induced tumors in the rat esophagus ( 22,30). Both berry 
types produced an approximate 40– 60% reduction in esophageal tumor multiplicity and were 
capable of suppressing the development of preneoplastic lesions (hyperplasia and both low - 
and high -grade dysplasia) into papi[INVESTIGATOR_28603]. The inhibitory effects of the berries were associated 
with a reduction in the rate of proliferation of preneoplastic cells , as determined by 
[CONTACT_627797]. Recently, a laboratory showed that BRBs downregulate COX- 2 and iNOS expression and activities in NMBA- treated rat 
esophagus ( 31) and BRB extracts have been shown to downregulate the transcription 
activators, activator protein- 1 (AP- 1) and n uclear factor kappa B (NF -кB) in cultured mouse 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_73915] . (32) The protective effects of BRBs on esophageal tumorigenesis may be 
partially due to ellagic acid content, but cannot be attributed to ellagic acid alone. ( 22)

IIT-ATALLAHBLACK RASPBERRY  Version Date:  12/29/17    2  HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES  
2.1  Primary  Objectives 
 
To evaluate the potential hypomethylating effects of freeze- dried black raspberries (BRBs) in 
the peripheral blood of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or myelodysplastic syndrome/ 
myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN ) after three  cycles of BRB administration.  
 
2.2  Secondary  Objectives  
 
1. To evaluate the toxicity of BRBs in patients with MDS  or MDS/MPN . 
 
2. To evaluate the hematological response according to modified IWG criteria (Appendix 2) 
in patients with MDS or MDS/MPN regardless of the initial blood count.  
 
3. To evaluate the anthocyanin concentrations in peripheral blood of patient s prior to and 
after administration of BRB powder on Cycle 1 Day 1 of treatment . 
 
 
3  STUDY  DESIGN 
3.1  General  Description 
 
This is a phase II single -group pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. This trial is designed to evaluate efficacy and 
methylation. This study’s overarching aim is to evaluate the systemic effects of BRBs in patients with MDS  or MDS /MPN . Eighteen patients with MDS or MDS/MPN  will be treated with 
25 gm (2x/day) of BRB powder taken orally in 8 ounces of water. If the patient is unable to tolerate the taste of the BRB powder mixed in water, he or she may mix it with 8 ounces of milk, 
ice cream or a smoothie.  
 
Anthocyanins in the blood will be measured within three hours prior to BRB administration, and two hours (+/ - 30 minutes) after the first dose. Urine anthocyanins will be measured within three 
hours prior to BRB administration and three hours (+/ -30 minutes) after the first BRB dose. Both 
of those time points were chosen based on previous studies demonstrating that the maximum concentrations of anthocyanins and ellagic acid in plasma occurred at one to two hours, and 
maximum quantit ies in urine appeared from zero to four  hours . (20) Methylation status will be 
measured within three hours prior to BRB administration in cycles 1 –4, 7, [ADDRESS_836352] three  cycles. At cycles 4 and 7, day 1, the patient will be assessed for response (Appendix 2) 
and toxicity. If  the patient is tolerating BRBs well and is benefiting from therapy, he or she will 
continue treatment for a total maximum of 12 cycles. Tolerating well is defined as no grade 3 or 4 toxicity.  
 *Benefiting from therapy  (for cycle 3 disease assessme nt) defined as CR, PR, HI, stable 
disease with no disease progression ( see Appendix 2).  
**Benefiting from therapy (for cycle 6 disease assessment) defined as CR, PR  or HI (see

Signs or symptoms reported as adverse events will be graded and recorded by [CONTACT_093], 
according  to the CTCAE version 4. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common 
underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event.  
 
Follow -up of Adverse Events 
All adverse events will be followed with appropriate medical management from the fi rst dose of 
BRBs until [ADDRESS_836365] dose of treatment.  
 
The investigator and his or her team will follow the Medical College of Wisconsin policies related 
to adverse event reporting.  
 
7.2  Defining and reporting a Serious Adverse Event  (SAE)  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) means any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Death. Results in  death.  
• Life threatening . Is life threatening (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk  of 
death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more  severe).  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_109577] (excluding planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).  
• Disability/incapacity . Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. 
(Disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
• Medically important event . This refers to an AE that may not result in death, be 
immediately life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may be considered serious 
when, based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient, require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, or  involves 
suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse; any 
organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting Transmissible  
• Spongiform Encephalopathy), pathogenic or nonpathogenic, is considered an infectious agent.  
 
Clarification should be made between a serious AE (SAE) and an AE that is considered severe 
in intensity (Grade 3 or 4), because the terms serious and severe are NOT synonymous. The 
general term severe is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event; the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a Grade 3 
headache). This is NOT the same as serious, which is based on patient/event outcome or action 
criteria described above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s 
life or ability to function. A severe AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not necessarily need to be considered 
29 
IIT-ATALLAHBLACK RASPBERRY  Version Date:  12/29/17    serious. For example, a white blood cell count  of 1000/mm3 to less than 2000 is considered 
Grade 3 (severe) but may not be considered serious. Seriousness (not intensity) serves as a 
guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
 
Reporting SAEs  
 
Serious AEs must be reported from the first dose of BRBs through 30 days after completion of study treatment or until they are resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s 
stable or chronic condition or intercurrent illness(es).  
 
For serious AEs, the investigator must determine both the intensity of the event and the relationship of the event to study drug administration.  
 
Since this is an investigator -initiated study, the principal investigator, also referred to as the 
sponsor -investigator, is responsible for reporting serious adverse events (SAEs) to any 
regulatory agency and to the sponsor -investigator’s IRB when required.  
 
AEs which are serious must be reported to the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) from the first dose of BRBs through [ADDRESS_836366] also be reported to the DSMC as soon 
as possible, but no later than five calendar days of the sponsor- investigator’s observation or 
awareness of the event.  
 
Report Method: The investigator will use email to report SAEs to the DSMC. The SAE report 
must include event term(s), serious criteria, and the sponsor- investigator’s or sub- investigator’s 
determination of both the intensity of the event(s) and the relationship of the event(s) to study drug administration. Intensity for each SAE, including any lab abnormalities, will be determined by [CONTACT_20559] 4 as a guideline whenever possible.  
 
The criteria are available online at http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html
. 
 
7.[ADDRESS_836367] or Other  (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961])  
 
The investigator and his or her team will follow the Medical College of Wisconsin policies related 
to unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others. This information may be found on 
the Human Research Protection Program  website . 
 
7.[ADDRESS_836368] be followed for the 
final pregnancy outcome.  
 
If a female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant during the male patient’s participation in 
this study, the sponsor -investigator must also immediately notify the DSMC. Every effort should 
be made to follow t he pregnancy for the final pregnancy outcome.

In a previous pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], healthy subjects cons umed 45 g of freeze- dried berries for 14 days 
and the berries were well tolerated.  
 
However, side effects are always a possibility and patients will be asked to report any change in 
their health status or potential adverse events  
 
Expedited Reporting to the Food and Drug Administration  
 
If the study is being conducted under an IND, the sponsor -investigator is responsible for 
determining whether or not the suspected adverse reaction meets the criteria for expedited 
reporting in accordance with Federal Regulations (21 CFR §312.32).  
 
The investigator must report in an IND safety report any suspected adverse reaction that is both 
serious and unexpected. The sponsor -investigator needs to ensure that the event meets all 
three definitions:  
 Suspected adverse  reaction 
 Unexpected 
 Serious  
 
If the adverse event does not meet all three of the definitions, it should not be submitted as an 
expedited IND safety report.  
 
The timeline for submitting an IND safety report to FDA is no later than 15 calendar days after 
the investigator determines that the suspected adverse reaction qualifies for reporting (21 CFR 
312.32(c)(1)).  
 
Any unexpected fatal or life -threatening suspected adverse reaction will be reported to FDA no 
later than seven calendar days after the investigator’s initial receipt of the information (21 CFR 
312.32(c)(2)).  
 
Any relevant additional information that pertains to a previously submitted IND safety report will 
be submitted to FDA as a Follow -up IND Safety Report without delay, as soon as the 
information is available (21 CFR 312.32(d)(2)).

They are freeze dried under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) conditions by [CONTACT_627803], Oregon, the largest U.S. freeze- drying company. After freeze drying, the berries 
are ground into a powder, and the powder is tested for contamination with fungi, e. coli, salmonella and listeria. In addition, the content of 26 different nutrients are measured in the 
powder on a routine basis, as described by [CONTACT_627804] . (19) 
 
Classification:  
 
Phytomedicine.  
 
Mechanism of Action:  
 
Their modes of action include inhibition of carcinogen activation and stimulation of carcinogen 
detoxification. In addition, they reduce the binding of the reactive metabolites of carcinogens to 
DNA, downregulate genes associated with cancer development, upregulate of genes involved in 
cell-cycle control and stimulate apoptosis and inhibit angiogenesis.  
 
Metabolism:  
 
Anthocyanins are excreted in intact forms and metabolized into methylated derivatives in human urine. The urinary excretion of anthocyanins reaches maximum concentration during the four - to 
eight -hour period after black raspberry ingestion. 
 
Contraindications:  
 
Allergic reaction to BRBs  
 
Side Effects:  
 
As noted, side effects are a possibility and potential adverse events (i.e., headache, dizziness, 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) will be monitored.

9  REPORTING AND DOCUMENTING RESULTS (MEASUREMENT 
OF EFFECT)  
9.1  Evaluation of Efficacy (or  Activity) Definitions 
Evaluable for toxicity: All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first study 
drug treatment.  
 
33 
IIT-ATALLAHBLACK RASPBERRY  Version Date:  12/29/17    Evaluable for response: Only patients who have undergone at least three cycles of 
treatment are evaluable for response. 
 
9.2  Methods for  Evaluation  
 
All baseline evaluations will be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment. 
Please refer to the study calendar and Section 3 (study design).  
 
Physical Examination, Laboratory Values, Food Records  
 
After completing a dietary assessment, patients will undergo physical examination and 
laboratory tests (complete blood count (CBC) with differential, platelet count, and serum 
chemistry assessment). The treating physician will evaluate the patient every cycle . 
Peripheral blood samples will be collected cycles 1 –4, 7, 10,  and EOT for evaluation of 
methylation status .  
 
9.[ADDRESS_836375] dose of BRBs. The content of each of the four major anthocyanins in BRBs (i.e., cyanidin-3- rutinoside, cyanidin-3- 
xylosylrutinoside, cyanidin-3- glucoside and cyanidin-3- sambubioside) will be measured, using 
HPLC, as described previously . (17) Briefly, separation of plasma and urinary anthocyanins will 
be conducted on a Symmetry C18 column (4.6 × 75 mm, 3.5 μm; Waters Corp.) using an HPLC system. Cyanidin-3- glucoside will be dissolved in deionized- distilled water containing 5% formic 
acid. All levels of anthocyanins analyzed in plasma and urine samples will fall within the 
standard curve range and will be expressed as cyanidin glucoside equivalents in pmol/mL 
plasma or urine.  
 
DNA methylation analysis by [CONTACT_627805] (RRBS)  
Peripheral blood will be used to isolate CD45+ leukocytes , using CD45 MicroBeads (Miltenyi 
Biotec) . DNA will be extracted from isol ated leukocytes (DNA extraction kit, Qiagen). Then , DNA 
samples will be used for RRBS analysis . In brief, first, genomic DNA is digested using a 
methylation- insensitive restriction enzyme. The next step is adding an extra adenosine to both 
the plus and minus strands. End repair and A -Tailing is done within the same reactions, with 
dCTP, dGTP and dATP deoxyribonucleotides. Then, methylated sequence adapters are ligated 
to the DNA fragments. The desired size of fragments is then selected to be purified. DN A 
fragments of 40- [ADDRESS_836376] commonly performed. Alignment to a reference genome allows the programs to identify base pairs within the genome that are methylated. The identified genes will be validated using 
pyrosequencing.  
 
The research samples will be batched and any leftover blood/urine will be banked for future research. The research samples will be processed and banked at [CONTACT_55209] -Shu Wang’s lab at the 
R4655 TBRC, Medical College of Wisconsin, [ADDRESS_836377], Milwaukee WI [ZIP_CODE].  
 
34 
IIT-ATALLAHBLACK RASPBERRY  Version Date:  12/29/17    9.4  Response Criteria  
 
  The patient’s best clinical response will be assessed, based on the modified IWG response      
  criteria (Appendix 2) while receiving BRBs.  
 
9.5  Evaluation of  Safety  
 
The study will use the CTCAE v4.0 for reporting of adverse events. Patients will be evaluated 
every cycle  for toxicity.  
 
10  STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
Methods for berry components (ellagic acid and anthocyanins)  
A descriptive analysis will be performed for ellagic acid and anthocyanin data. Means, medians   
and confidence intervals will be calculated for all absolute and relative differences.  
 
Methods for analysis of  methylation changes  
The primary analysis will consist of six mixed effect models with a random effect for patient, and 4 pairwise comparison of baseline methylation to each treatment times. A Bonferroni correction 
for 24 total comparisons will be applied to maintain a 5% experimentwise error rate. The primary outcome will be analyzed as the relative methylation rate (difference/baseline).  
Absolute methylation will also be analyzed, if appropriate for this data. Missing data will be 
assum ed to be missing at random (MAR). Patients with partial data before six6 cycles , e.g., 
from their visits at cycle [ADDRESS_836378] been observed in pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299], with mean differences exceeding 20% difference, with standard deviations rangin g from six to eight. This study calls 
for comparing the methylation differences from baseline to each treatment  time points, and 
repeated over six different genes of interest, for a total of [ADDRESS_836379] with 5% type I error rate with Bonferroni adjustment for [ADDRESS_836380] deviation of 8.0 and methylation difference of 12%, a sample size of 16 will be sufficient for 95%  power. To date, seven patients  were enrolled to the trial and they all finished 
three  cycles of BRB treatment.  Based on the current compliance to the treatm ent protocol, no 
one dropped and no one  was noncompliant . Therefore , we assume  that there will be no more 
than 5% non -compliance to the treatment protocol. An addition of 5% will be recruited, so power 
can be maintained using nonparametric methods (Wilcoxon Signed -Rank test) . Therefore, this 
brings the final sample required sample size to 18 patients  to maintain the power of the study . 
Toxicity monitoring plan (stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877])  
Severe toxicity is not expected with BRB. As a precaution for unexpected high toxicity, the trial enrolment will be pause and the protocol reviewed if a toxicity rate exceeding 15% is observed. The following table gives the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877] a Pocock -type bounda ry for 15% toxicity rate:  
 
# enrolled  3 5 9 12 16 18 
Pause  if toxicities 
equal or greater  than 3 4 5 6 7 8 
 
Ex: Five  toxicities with 10 enrolled would call for a pause for review.

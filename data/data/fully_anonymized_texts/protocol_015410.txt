Version Date:  June 20, [ADDRESS_458725] changes in inflammation during tumor treatment. We will study 3 populations of patients with intracranial tumors : metastatic brain tumor patients treated with 
immunotherapy, GBM patients undergoing chemoradiation, and GBM patients treated with immunotherapy. PBR PETs will be performed at baseline prior to therapy and then several weeks -months after start of therapy depending on therapy used. 
 The PET studies will be performed using a simultaneous MR- PET imaging scanner . No 
diagnostic decisions or therapy decisions will be based on any results obtained from these PET scans, and we expect no change in the care of these patients. The success of these studies should enable methods that could be used in larger studies to more completely understand the role of inflammation  in the treatment of cancer.

BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Study Disease (s) 
 An estimated 51,410 primary brain tumors were diagnosed in 2007, and 19% of these tumors were glioblastomas (CBTRUS - Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United S tates).  GBM is the 
most common malignant primary brain tumor and  is a uniformly fatal disease with 5 -year 
survival rates less than 4% despi[INVESTIGATOR_367092], radiation and chemotherapy.  There is no curative therapy for patients with GBM.  Current standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed GBM is concomitant involved field radiation and oral temozolomide chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_279420] 6-12 months.

2.[ADDRESS_458727] seen FDA approval of active cellular immunotherapy for advanced prostate cancer and immune checkpoint blockade via CTLA-4 inhibition for patients with advanced melanoma.  Currently, there is great enthusiasm for PD -1 inhibition (checkpoint 
blockade) via monoclonal antibodies in patients with solid tumors; phase [ADDRESS_458728] yielded high response rates across a spectrum of cancers with relatively little toxicity.  In addition, adopti ve T-lymphocyte transfer using ex vivo expanded tumor- infiltrating lymphocytes or 
chimeric antigen receptors (CAR’s) is showing great promise in patients with melanoma and CD19+ leukemia respectively.  Also, phase [ADDRESS_458729] therapy -induced inflammation rather than tumor progression.  The 
immunotherapy community has proposed a set of “immune- related response criteria” that may be

8 more applicable to these patients.  However, as these measures require the si multaneous 
assessment of multiple lesions, they are poorly suited for understanding response in 
glioblastoma. There is an expanding number of cases of immunotherapy- associated 
pseudoprogression in which intensely enhancing and space- occupying lesions resol ve without 
other intervention after a few weeks.   The ability to distinguish between and inflammatory response and tumor progression (which is characterized by [CONTACT_367104]) is critical for providers.  There is, therefore, a need for m ore specific imaging of immunotherapy-
associated inflammation in patients with intracranial tumors.   
 The 1 8-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) is a protein that is expressed in mitochondria and is 
particularly prominently expressed by [CONTACT_262171], i nfiltrating macrophages, and reactive 
astrocytes . Thus, it is a marker of neuro-inflammation. PET tracers are being developed that bind 
to this receptor as a means to measure inflammation.
2 One of these tracers, [11C]PBR28, is a 
second generation PET tracer that binds to TSPO . This tracer has been used in many studies of 
CNS disease such as cocaine abuse3, neurocysticercosis4 depression5 Alzheimer’s disease6,[ADDRESS_458730] melanoma pati ents.  
 Thus, w e will evaluate [11C]PB28 PET as a tool for measuring inflammation associated with the 
response to immunotherapy or chemoradiation  in patients with brain tumors . Having such a tool 
that distinguishes active tumor from inflammation will be an incredibly useful tool in the management of patients.  If this  tracer shows potential utility in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we will examine

correlate PET findings with outcome. 
 One limitation of PBR PET is that certain people can be classified as low binders because of a genetic polymorphism.
14 These “low binders” have negligible binding to the PBR28 tracer so 
would not be informative to include in our study and will be excluded. Only about 10% of human subjects are low affinity binders based on prior data.

of which are impacted by [CONTACT_367105]. These will be exploratory 
analyses to see if changes in tumor vasculature/cellularity can help interpret changes in PBR 
uptake.

REGISTRATION PROCEDU RES  
 
4.1 General Guidelines for DF/HCC and DF/PCC Institutions  
 Institutions will register eligible participants with the DF/HCC Quality Assurance Office for Clinical Trials (QACT) central registration system. Registrations must occur prior to the initiation of  any imaging . Any participant not registered to the protocol before protocol therapy  
begins will be considered ineligible and registration will be denied.  
 An investigator will confirm eligibility criteria and a member of the study team will complete the 
QACT  protocol- specific eligibility checklist.  
 Following registration, participants  may begin protocol therapy . Issues that would cause 
treatment delays should be discussed with the Overall Principal Investigator (PI). If a participant does not receive protocol therapy following registration, the pa rticipant’s registration on  the 
study must be canceled . Notify the QACT Registrar of registration cancellations  as soon as 
possible.   
4.2 
Registration Process for DF/HCC and DF/PCC Institutions  
 The QACT registration staff is accessible on Monday through Friday, from 8:00 AM to 5:[ADDRESS_458738] registration line at  and follow the 
instructions for registering participants after hours.  
 The registra tion procedures are as follows: 
 
• Obtain written informed consent from the participant prior to the performance of any 
protocol specific procedures or assessments.  
 
• Complete the QACT protocol- specific eligibility checklist using the eligibility 
assessment documented in the participant’s medical  record and/or research chart. To be 
eligible for registration to the protocol , the participant must meet all inclusion and 
exclusion criterion  as described in the protocol and reflected on the eligibility 
checklist.  
 
Reminder : Confirm eligibility for ancillary studies at the same time as eligibility for a  
treatment protocol. Registration to both treatment and ancillary protocols will not be 
completed if eligibility requirements are not met for all studies.

5.1 
Treatment Regimen  
 This study does not add any additional treatment to enrolled patients. All treatment decisions will be at the discretion of the treating physician. There will be no change in the diagnosis or management of the patient based on any procedures or tests carried out as a part of this study. 
 There are no expected toxicities and potential risks for PBR . All scans will be performed at the 
Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging in Charlestown on the combined MR PET scanner .   
 For GBM patients with suspected pseudoprogression, MR- PET will be performed at the time of 
suspected pseudoprogression.  
For GBM patients treated with immunotherapy, MR -PET will be performed prior to start of the 
immunotherapy and then 2 cy cles later.  
 
For metastatic cancer  patients treated with immunotherapy, MR -PET will be performed prior to 
start of the immunotherapy and then 3 cycles later.

MR-PET Scan Procedure   
 
5.3.1 MRI Scan  
 
Image Acquisition Details : 
 
MR scans will be performed including T1- and T2-weighted volumetric images, fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), contrast agent enhanced T1- weighted 
permeability, diffusion imaging , T2/T2*-weighted perfusion scans, and MR 
Spectroscopy. The “Autoalign” package available from the manufacturer will be used to achieve the same slice prescription in the same patient at each visit. Each MRI will last 60-[ADDRESS_458740] brain MRIs.  Gadolinium- diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (o r gadopentetate dimeglumine, Gd 
DTPA) will be used as a contrast agent. The maximum contrast dose that could be given is 0.3 mmol/kg per visit, in line with the FDA -approved dosing for this class of contrast 
agents.  
 Image Analysis Details : 
 MRI data will be analyzed per our usual techniques as have been reported previously. 
 Image Interpretation Details :  
 Interpretation will be performed at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging.  The 
results will not be automatically relayed to the patient or treating  physician as it is unclear 
how these scans should be interpreted so should not influence patient management. If 
requested, we will share the data with the patient’s physician  but again, should not

Version Date:  June 20, 2018  
 
15 influence patient management . Patients and treating physic ians may be curious to see the 
images so we want to allow for sharing of the images. The detailed analysis required for 
interpretation of the data will not be in real time so will not be able to influence treatment 
decisions. Moreover, we do not want lack of communication to be a barrier to accrual.    
   5.3.2 PBR PET  Scan  
 
Image Acquisition Details : 
 
During each visit, [11C]PBR28 (up to 15mCi, which results in  ~3.7 mSv) will be injected 
intravenously with a slow bolus over a 30s period. The catheter will be flashed post-injection of with 0.9% saline solution. Dynamic data will be collected over approximately 
[ADDRESS_458741], for at mos t 200m L of 
blood.  The blood draws will be used to assess the radioactivity levels in the blood necessary for dynamic imaging. The catheter s will be removed at the end of the study.   
 Image Analysis Details : 
 PET volumes will be reconstructed using the ordinary Poisson ordered subsets expectation maximization (OP -OSEM) 3D algorithm. Corrections will be applied for 
variable detector dead time and efficiency, random coincidences, photon attenuation and scatter, and decay.  
 Image Interpretation Details :  
 Interpretation will be performed at the Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging.

ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQU IREMENTS  
 Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The following list of reported and/or potential AEs (Section 7.1) and the characteristics of an 
observed AE (Section 7.2) will determine whether the event requires expedited  reporting  in 
addition  to routine reporting.  
  Per NCI Adverse Event Reporting Requirements related to PET tracers , adverse events related to 
the PET imaging are reportable up to 3.5 hours after injection (i.e. 10 half-lives of the C11 tracer).

. 
 
• For expedited repor ting purposes only:   
- AEs for the agent (s) that are listed above should be reported only if the adverse event

Version Date:  June 20, 2018  
 
18 varies in nature, intensity or frequency from the expected  toxicity  information which 
is provided. 
- Other AEs for the protocol that do not require expedited reporting are outlined in the 
next section  (Expedited Adverse Event  Reporting) under the sub- heading of Protocol-
Specific Expedited Adverse Event Reporting Exclusions. 
 
• Attribution  of the AE: 
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
- Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the s tudy treatment.  
 
There are no known adverse events related to PBR28 but any event thought related to PBR28

up to 3.5 hours after injection (i.e. 10 half -lives of the C11 tracer).  Thus, by 3.5 hours 
after injection the tracer should be out of a patients system and not responsible for any adverse events. Any SAE s related to the PET imaging will also be reported to the RDRC.  
 
 
7.3.1 DF/HCC Expedited Reporting Guidelines  
 
Investigative sites within DF/HCC and  DF/PCC will report SAEs directly to the DFCI

11.1.[ADDRESS_458763] their response classified according to the definitions stated below.  
(Note:  Participants  who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 
will also be considered evaluable.) 
 
Protocol  A pi[INVESTIGATOR_367091].  
 
Version Date:  June 20, [ADDRESS_458764] one dimension (longest diameter  to be recorded) as ≥ [ADDRESS_458765] x -ray or ≥[ADDRESS_458766] be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeter s). 
 Note: Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not be considered measurable. If the investigator thinks it appropriate to include them, the conditions under which such lesions should be considered must be defined in the protocol.   
Non-measurable disease.  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non -measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), and cystic lesions are all considered  
non-measurable.  
 Note: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) 
since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same participant, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and  measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved 
organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported 
Protocol  A pi[INVESTIGATOR_367091].  
 
Version Date:  June 20, 2018  
 
25 as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the 
short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to 
further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.   
 
Non-target lesions.  All othe r lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable 
lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non- target lesions  and 
should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow up.  
  
 
11.1.3 Metho ds for Evaluation of Disease 
 All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler, calipers , 
or a digital measurement tool.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as 
possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow- up. Imaging -based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being 
followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
  
 
11.1.4 Response Criteria  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Per RANO or RECIST guidelines as appropriate.   
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR) :  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.   
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  At lea st a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  
the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). 
Protocol  A pi[INVESTIGATOR_367091].  
Version Date:  June 20, 2018  
 
26 Stable Disease (SD) :  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.  
RANO Criteria  (JCO 2010; 28:1963-1972)
 
[IP_ADDRESS] 
Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
Per RANO or RECIST guidelines as appropriate.  
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization 
of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis). 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response. 
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. 

Protocol  A pi[INVESTIGATOR_367091].  
 
Version Date:  June 20, 2018  
 
27 Progressive Disease (PD) :  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions.  Unequivocal progression 
should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall 
disease status change, not a single lesion increase.     
 Although a clear progression of “non-target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_367100], and the progression 
status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator). 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] 
Evaluation of New Lesions  
 The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal (i.e. not due to difference in scanning technique, imaging modality, or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre -existing lesions). However, a lesion identified on a follow-up scan in an 
anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered new and will indicate PD. If a new lesion is equivocal (because of small size etc.), follow -up 
evaluation will clarify if it truly represents new disease and if PD is confirmed, progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan on which the lesion was discovered.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] 
Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
 The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic deterioration.”   Every effort should be made to document the 
objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

11.1.5 Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started , or 
death due to any cause. Participants w ithout events reported are censored at the last 
disease evaluation ). 
 
Duration of overall complete response: The duration of overall CR is measured from the 
time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is obj ectively documented , or death due to any cause. Participants without events 
reported are censored at the last disease evaluation .  
 
Protocol  A pi[INVESTIGATOR_367091].  
 
Version Date:  June 20, 2018  
 
29 Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment 
until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
 
11.1.6 Progression -Free Survival  
 
Overall Survival : Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization (or 
registration) to death due to any cause, or censored at date last known alive. 
 
Progression-Free Survival : Progression -Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the time from 
randomization (or registration) to the earlier of progression or death due to any cause. Participants alive without disease progression are censored at date of last disease evaluation. 
 
Time to Progression: Time to Progression (TTP) is defined as the time from 
randomization (or registration) to progression, or censored at date of last disease evaluation for those without progression reported.

STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
 
13.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
 
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_367101]28 PET in measuring  treatment 
related inflammation  . We will measure if increased uptake of PBR28 in the tumor 
during treatment is associated with longer time to progression (i.e. suggesting that the 
response to therapy is inflammatory rather than tumor growth).  
 
 
13.2 Sample Size, Accrual Rate and Study Duration  
 
Protocol  A pi[INVESTIGATOR_367091].  
 
Version Date:  June 20, 2018  
 
31 Total sample size is anticipated to be 40 patients: 15 patients in cohort A (metastatic 
brain tumor patients) and 15 in cohort C (GBM patients suspected of having 
pseudoprogression) and 10 in cohort B (GBM patients treated with immunothera py). 
 Several factors influence the sample size for this study. This is a non- therapeutic study 
in a patient population which typi[INVESTIGATOR_367102] a clinical trial at all so this trial will b e less appealing to patients . 
In addition, since PBR  PET remains investigational it is a very expensive test so 
budgetary constraints limit accrual .  
 
In order to assess if PBR  PET helps to assess tumor inflammation, we will quant itate 
PBR uptake in the tumor and correlate that with tumor progression  as determined by 
[CONTACT_367109]. The hypothesis is that if tumor 
PBR retention is high, this would be consistent with a strong response to 
immunotherapy and should be associated with prolonged progression free survival. If 
PBR retention is low, indicating an immunosuppressive, active tumor microenvironment, PFS should be short. We selected [ADDRESS_458770] (with 
mean and SD estimates as cited below). Since there is no a priory indication for the breakdown between progression and non-progression, we assumed equal group sizes.   With 15 patients in cohort A (metastatic brain tumor patients) and 15 in cohort C (GBM 
patients suspected of having pseudoprogression), the study will have at least 80% power to detect a 60% difference in PBR uptake between those progression free at [ADDRESS_458771] baseline and mid treatment PET (cohort A), we will use the change in PBR uptake. There is limited data on PBR28 in brain tumors so this 
calculation assum es a baseline of 125 ml/cm
3 and equal variance of 100 ml/cm3 (based 
on literature repo rted rates from healthy brain) .[ADDRESS_458772] progressed at 9 months. All patients will also be followed for 3 
years after study completion for progression and survival. Time to event analysis will be used to incorporate other potential prognostic factors such as age and functional status.   
Protocol  A pi[INVESTIGATOR_367091].  
 
Version Date:  June 20, 2018  
 
32 Given the small number of patients anticipated to accrue to cohort B (GBM patients 
treated with immunotherapy), th ese patients will be analyzed with descriptive statistics 
alone. This accrual is anticipated to be low because of the small number of GBM patients currently treated with immunotherapy.  We anticipate enrolling a maximum of 
10 patients in this cohort.

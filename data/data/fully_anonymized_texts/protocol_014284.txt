Montelukast Clinical Trial Protocol, Version  10.0 –  October [ADDRESS_535671] syndrome (ACS)[ADDRESS_535672] study examining the relationship between pain, ACS and asthma was 
performed in a cohort of 291 children identifi ed from the Cooperative Study of Sickle 
Cell Disease (CSSCD)4. Of these children, 49 (16.8%) ha d a diagnosis of asthma 
noted in the record. Children with asthma had twice as many epi[INVESTIGATOR_162803] (1.39 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_302054] -year versus 0.47 epi[INVESTIGATOR_302054] -year, p<0.001) and twice 
as many epi[INVESTIGATOR_325885] (0.39 v. 0.20 events per patient -year, p< 0.001) when 
compared to children without asthma.   
 
In a separate study of 1,963 children and adults with SCD enrolled in the CSSCD, 
those with asthma and SCD died at younger ages when compared to individuals 
with SCD without asthma.  The median survival f or individuals with asthma was 52.5 
years in comparison to 64.3 years in individuals without asthma. After controlling for 
previously identified risk factors for death5, individuals with asthma had a m ore than 
2-fold increase in risk of death (Hazard Ratio: 2.36 by [CONTACT_17935], 95% CI 1.21 
to 4.62, p=0.01).  Taken together, these data indicate that asthma is a significant 
cause of acute vaso -occlusive epi[INVESTIGATOR_423952].  Since asthma 
worsens the course of SCD, examining mechanisms that are important to asthma 
pathogenesis may provide therapeutic targets for individuals with SCD.  
 
Inhibition of the leukotriene pathway is an effective strategy for prevention of asthma 
symptoms, another pro-inflammatory disease.   Leukotrienes are a family of lipid 
mediators that cause bronchoconstriction and are involved in inflammatory 
responses. Two types of leukotrienes exist: 1) CysLTs – leukotrienes C 4 (LTC 4), D 4 
(LTD 4), and E 4 (LTE 4),-that are pepti de-conjugated lipi[INVESTIGATOR_423953], basophils, mast cells and macrophages and 2) leukotriene B 4   
(LTB 4), a leukocyte chemoattractant and activator. CysLTs bind to receptors on 
vascular endothelial cells and bronchial smoo th muscle.  In the vasculature, CysLTs 
mediate vasoconstriction 6, upregulation of cell adhesion molecules7 and increased 
vascular permeability8.  In the airway, CysLTs promote bronchoconstriction, airway 
remodeling, increased mucous production and smooth muscle prolifer ation 8-10.

 Levels of CysLTs correlate with asthma severity11, asthma exacerbations12, allergen  
challenge 13,14 and exercise -induced bronchoconstriction15. 
 
LTB 4 is a 5 -lipoxygenase metabolite of arachidonic acid in neutrophils that acts as a 
chemoattractant and enhances neutrophil  adhesion to endothelium. In a cross -
sectional study, Setty et al. assessed plasma levels of this metabolite in controls (n = 
9) and in individuals with SCD both in basal "steady state" (n = 37) and during 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_162803] (n = 10) and ACS (n = 5)16. LTB 4 levels were markedly increased in 
patients with SCD in basal steady state (P <.003) compared with those in controls. 
Levels were further increased duri ng pain (P <.04) and ACS (P <.0001) epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. 
Taken together, these data suggest that the study of leukotriene pathogenesis and 
perhaps leukotriene receptor inhibition may dampen the anti -inflammatory state and 
lessen the impact of the co -morbid conditions  associated with SCD.  
 
Inhibition of leukotriene activity is an anti -inflammatory target for asthma. 
Therapeutic benefit of the leukotriene receptor antagonist montelukast is well 
documented. Montelukast is associated with an increased exercise -induced 
bronchoprotection17, reduced asthma exacerbations18 and has no evidence of 
tolerance with prolonged use19. Further, montelukast has been well tolerated with 
relatively few reported toxicities20.  In contrast, the [ADDRESS_535673] therapy, both may 
contribute to clinical improvement.  
 
2. Study Objectives  
 2.1 Primary Objective : To determine whether montelukast versus placebo 
added to hydroxyurea will improve markers of vaso -occlusion/tissue injury in 
adolescents and adults with SCD.  
 2.2 Secondary Objective s:  
1) To determine if montelukast versus placebo added to hydroxyurea will 
improve lung function in adolescents and adults with SCD.   
2) To determine if montelukast versus placebo added to hydroxyurea will 
improve blood flow in adolescents and adults with SCD.

4. Trial Enrollment  
4.[ADDRESS_535675] agreed to refer 
patients for participation in this feasibility trial. The Froedtert Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_423954] 7 5 children (≥

 16 years) and 200 adults with HbSS/HbSβ -thalassemia0 between [ADDRESS_535676]’s age is taken into consideration for study 
participation. In regards to painful vaso -occlusive crises, the incidence rate 
increases with age and contributing factors to vaso -occlusive crises may be 
different at age extremes. We chose to exclude very young and older 
patients with SCD  from our study to reduce the potential confounding effects 
of age.    
Currently there are  few other trials available to this patient population and 
many of these individuals are currently on hydroxyurea. In our experience 
>50% of adult patients with HbSS/HbS β -thalassemia0 will have ≥ 3 pain 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_11114] (including those that did not result in healthcare 
utilization). We recognize that this is a higher rate of pain than has been 
previously reported in the literature, however, the clinic populations in the 
academic medi cal centers at Nashville and Milwaukee provide care for 
individuals with more severe disease compared to community -based 
centers. For this phase II study, we conservatively estimate the dropout rate 
at 20%. However, we will use an intent -to-treat analysis and so have 50 for 
the primary outcome, but 63 for all analyses. Additionally, we will 
conservatively estimate that four patients will need to be approached for 
each one that participates (4:1 ratio). Therefore, we will plan to screen [ADDRESS_535677]. Louis, 35% of 
adults with HbSS/Sβ -thalassemia0 were prescribed hydroxyurea. Assuming 
similar rates of hydroxyurea administration in Milwaukee and Nashville and 
that all adults prescribed hydroxyurea will have >2 pain epi[INVESTIGATOR_11114], 
approximately 271 adolescents and adults with SCD will be available for 
screening. Decreasing the entry criteria to ≥ 2 pain epi[INVESTIGATOR_423955].  Randomization 
will occur after the 2 week lead -in period. Randomization will be done using 
the software BREEZE and will occur in blocks of 10 to allow for any potential 
seasonal differences. Individuals who c omplete 70% of diary days in the 
lead-in period will be eligible for randomization. Patients will be recruited in 
clinic with direct contact [CONTACT_423976]/or study personnel. 
Patients may also be contact[CONTACT_213229] a phone call prior to scheduled  visits to 
inform them of the study.

4.2 Study Design  
For this double blind placebo controlled phase II trial a total of 63 subjects  will 
be recruited from the S ickle Cell Clinics at two national sites; Vanderbilt 
University in Nashville , Tennessee  and Froedtert Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_423957].  A 
20% subject dropout rate  is expected therefore  it is anticipated approximately  
[ADDRESS_535678] on chronic 
vasculopathy  and not on asthma -related morbidity.  
 
Study subjects will be randomized to receive either:  
 
• Oral monte lukast therapy taken daily for eight weeks  with current 
hydroxyurea regime nt 
                      OR 
• Oral placebo  taken daily for eight weeks  with current hydroxyurea 
regime nt 
 
 
After informed consent is obtained,  subjects will begin the study activities.  
Subjects , family members, health personnel , study investigators  and team  
members  will be blinded  to treatment allocation. The study 
pharmacy/pharmacy staff will be unblinded to treatment allocation. The DSMB 
with be unblended at the time of DSMB reporting  by [CONTACT_46134]. 
Unblinding would only occur in cases of adverse events where unblinding is 
essential for  subject safety a nd will be a t the discretion of the principal 
investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_423958]. Subjects whose treatment is unblinded would be taken 
off study drug and would be discontinued from the study .

study site, the DSMB and the designated study statistician at Medical College 
of Wisconsin should be aware of the treatment that is assigned to each 
subject. However, concerns regarding serious toxicity or safety may arise, 
prompting unblinding to become necessary.  
  
If an invest igator at a participating institution deems it necessary to unblind, it 
must be submitted in writing to the Principal Investigator, Michael DeBaun , 
MD, MPH  with the reason . Requests for unblinding should also be submitted 
to the Study Coordinator .  If the PI [INVESTIGATOR_49202], the request will be forwarded to 
the study statistician  by e-mail. The treatment assignment is then relayed to 
the Study Coordinator who communicates with the site. It will be the 
responsibility of each institution to withdraw the participant fr om the study and 
complete a Date Off Treatment/Off Study Form with the date the patient is 
unblinded as the date off -treatment.

8.  Human Subjects Protection  
 
8.1 Informed Consent: Subjects are required to sign an informed consent prior 
to screen ing, and before undergoing any study procedures or assessments, 
in accordance with ICH E6; 4.8, “Informed Consent of Trial Subjects.”  When 
substantial modifications are made to the informed consent, the IRB may 
require that all subjects currently enrolled in the study will be re -consented; 
ICH E6; 4.[ADDRESS_535703]’s  
records will be available to the study staff and to each site’s IRB and for audit 
purposes . Only authorized personnel will have access to the protected health 
information and research records.   In order that confidentiality can be 
maintained, the PI/study staff will keep records in locked cabinets /room  and 
results of tests will be coded to prev ent association with volunteers’ names. 
All electronic data will be entered into a secured, website data management 
system that requires training and is password protested. Identifying 
information will not be included on laboratory samples, faxes, or 
corre spondence. Laboratory samples will be shipped with only unique study 
numbers that will be linked to a key kept by [CONTACT_7880].   
All study team members are trained in HIPAA privacy regulations and other 
applicable site privacy policies. No information will be released, nor will 
participation in the research be acknowledged, to any party except where 
compulsory according to law or in tuitional policy. The results of the research

9. Adverse Event Monitoring  
 
9.1 Definitions  
 
Adverse Event  (AE) – Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a 
human subject, including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical 
exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with 
the subject’s participation in research, whether or not considered related to 
the subject’ s partici pation in r esearch . Pain epi[INVESTIGATOR_423969] s. 
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  – Any adverse event temporally associated 
with the subject’s participation in research that meets any of the following 
criteria:  
• Results in death;  
• Is life -threatening (places subject at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurs);  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ; 
• Results in a persistent significant/incapacity;  
• Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  or 
• Any other adverse event  that, based upon appropriate  medical 
judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent on the other outcomes 
listed in this definition  
Note that seriousness and severity are separate concepts. The t erm “severe” 
refers to the intensity of a specific event; a severe event may be of minor 
medical significance (e.g., a severe leg cramp). The term “serious” is based 
on an outcome or action criteria that are usually associated with events that 
pose a threa t to the patient’s life or functioning. An event that is mild in 
severity is serious if it leads to one of the outcomes defined above.  
 
Grade 4 and 5 events will always be considered Serious Adverse Events . 
Many Grade 3 and some Grade 1 and 2 events may me et the definition of a 
Serious Adverse Event.  
 
Unexpected Adverse Event - Any adverse event occurring in one or more 
subjects in a research protocol, the nature, the severity, or frequency of which 
is not consistent with either:  
• The known of foreseeable  risk of adverse events associated 
with the procedures involved in the research that are described 
in; 
Medical Science s Institute – Blood  Center of Wisconsin  
Montelukast Clinical Trial Protocol, Version  10.0 –  October 27 , 2016 PRO 
Page 19 of 32 
 
 o  the protocol related documents or the current IRB -
approved informed consent document  and;  
o other relevant sources of information, such as a product 
labeling  or package insert or;  
• The expected natural progression of any underlying disease, 
disorder, or condition of the subject(s) experiencing the adverse 
event and the subject’s predisposing risk factor profile for the 
adverse event . 
 
Unanticipated problem  involving risks to subjects or others (UP) - Any incident, 
experience or outcome that meets all the following criteria:  
• Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given:  
o The research procedures that are described in the protocol 
related -docum ents, such the IRB -approved r esearch 
protocol an d the informed consent form document and,  
o The characteristics of the subject population being 
studied ;  
• Related or possible related to the subject participation in 
research; and  
• Suggests that the research pla ces subjects or others at a 
greater risk of harm (including physical , psychological, 
economic, or social harm) related to the research than was 
previously known or recognized.  
 
Grading of Adverse Events – Events will be graded by [CONTACT_423988] (CTCAE) Criteria version 4.0.  
 
Attribution  – the determination  and documentation of  whether an adverse 
event is related to a medical procedure.  
 
Attribution Categories:  
1. Not Related –Event clearly related to other factors (e.g ., 
clinical state, other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; concomitant drugs)  
2. Possible Related – Sequence of event is compatible with 
study drug, device, or procedure, but could have been 
produced by [CONTACT_1604]  
3. Probably Related - Sequence of event is compatible with 
study drug, or procedure and cannot be explained by [CONTACT_423989]  
4. Definitely Related - Sequence of event is compatible with 
study drug, or procedure and beyond doubt cannot be 
explained by [CONTACT_423990] s Institute – Blood  Center of Wisconsin  
Montelukast Clinical Trial Protocol, Version  10.0 –  October [ADDRESS_535704] or other 
means, will be collected, recorded, followed , and reported as described in the 
following sections.

9.3 Timeline for Reporting of Adverse events, Serious  Adverse Events, 
Unexpected Adverse Events  and Unanticipated Problems  
    
All serious adverse events , all unexpected adverse events , and all 
unanticipated problems  will be reported to the  DSMB  within 24 hours of 
learning of the event ’s occurrence /or within [ADDRESS_535705] 
(IRB). Each site  will comply with the ir institution’s standard operating 
procedures for reporting adverse events. Subjects  will be instructed to report 
any adverse event(s)  during the study and  post-study .The investigator will 
notify  the IRB and any other applicable regulatory agency of any 
unanticipated death or adverse event occurring after a participant has 
discontinued or ter minated study participation that may reaso nably be related 
to the study.

11. Statistical Considerations  
11.1    Description  of Endpoints:  
11.1.1 Primary  Endpoint: Our primary endpoint is a 30% reduction in sVCAM.  
The study will conclude [ADDRESS_535709] or placebo 
treatment, at which time markers of vaso -occlusion/tissue injury will be 
compared to baseline in individuals with SCD .  
11.1.2 Secondary Endpoints:   
1) Other inflammatory markers (sP-selectin, sE -selectin, IL -1, IL-6, 
TNFα, IFN- and LTE 4) 
2) Daily pain score  
3) Proportion of pain free days to days with pain  
4) Opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], as reported in the diary  
5) Pulmonary function as measured by [CONTACT_10266] 1.  
6) Six-minute walk  
Medical Science s Institute – Blood  Center of Wisconsin  
Montelukast Clinical Trial Protocol, Version  10.0 –  October [ADDRESS_535710] deviation, range and 
correlation and plots will be used to examine distributions and 
interrelationships.  Where necessary, for parametric assumption, we will 
employ appropriate transformations with justifications. For example, the 
log of some of the biomarkers data may be used since cytokine growth 
tends to be multiplicative. We will model relationships using regression 
trees and regression models (linear and non linear). We will use random 
effects model to investigate changes over time, where patient is random. 
Initially we will use an auto correlation structure for the variance 
covariance matrix but will expl ore other structures. In models covariates 
such as group, age, gender, WBC, hemoglobin, % fetal hemoglobin and 
interactions of group with other covariates will be used.  Statistical 
software will be employed for data analysis: SAS version 9.13, Salford 
System CART for trees, and SPSS Version 18.0. We plan to accrue 25 
participants in each arm. From preliminary data, the mean sVCAM level is 
353 ng/ml with a standard deviation of 104 ng/ml. If we have similar 
variability in the proposed study, we will be able  to detect a change of ≥ 62 
ng/ml (or 18%) with 80% power. Our primary outcome measure is based 
on a 30% reduction, which would be ~106 ng/ml reduction. The study was 
designed with 25 in each group in order to explore all three aims and 
potential confounde rs. The 95% confidence interval for detecting a 30% 
difference is between 204 ng/ml and 290 ng/ml (or an 18 -42% reduction in 
sVCAM). Importantly, the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (18%) 
is still, in our opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], a clinically relevant reduction  in sVCAM. Thus, if we 
detect a 30% or larger difference in sVCAM in this study, we will be 
assured that, based on the 95% confidence interval, these data are 
clinically important28.

4. Subjects should not have exercised vigorously within [ADDRESS_535726].  
Measurements   
1. A "warm -up" period before the test should not be performed.  
2. The subject should sit at rest in a chair, located near the starting position, for at 
least [ADDRESS_535727] stand and rate their baseline dyspnea and overall fatigue 
using the Borg scale.  
4. Set the timer to 6 minutes. Assemble all necessary equipment (timer, 
clipboard, Borg Scale, worksheet) and move to the starting point.  
5. Instruct the subject as fol lows:  
"The object of this test is to walk as far as possible for [ADDRESS_535728]. Six minutes is a long time to walk, so you will be exerting yourself. 
You will probably get out of breath or become exhausted. You ar e permitted to slow 
Medical Science s Institute – Blood  Center of Wisconsin  
Montelukast Clinical Trial Protocol, Version  10.0 –  October [ADDRESS_535729] without hesitation. Now I'm going to show 
you. Please watch the way I turn without hesitation."  
Demonstrate by [CONTACT_114037]. Walk and pi[INVESTIGATOR_113988] a cone briskly.  
Remember that the object is to walk AS FAR AS POSSIBLE fo r 6 minutes, but don't run 
or jog.  
Start now or whenever you are ready.  
1. Position the subject at the starting line. You should also stand near the starting 
line during the test. Do not walk with the subject. As soon as the subject starts 
to walk, start th e timer.  
2. Do not talk to anyone during the walk. Use an even tone of voice when using 
the standard phrases of encouragement. Watch the subject. Do not get 
distracted and lose count of the laps. Each time the participant returns to the 
starting line, count the lap on the worksheet. Let the participant see you do it.  
After the first minute, tell the subject the following (in even tones): "You are doing well. 
You have 5 minutes to go."  
When the timer shows [ADDRESS_535730] the following:  "Keep up the 
good work. You have 4 minutes to go."  
When the timer shows [ADDRESS_535731] the following: "You are 
doing well. You are halfway done."  
When the timer shows [ADDRESS_535732] the following: "Keep up t he 
good work. You have only 2 minutes left."  
When the timer shows only [ADDRESS_535733]: "You are doing well. 
You have only 1 minute to go."  
Do not use other words of encouragement (or body language to speed up).  
If the subject stops  walking during the test and needs a rest, say this: "You can lean 
against the wall if you would like; then continue walking whenever you feel able." Do not 
stop the timer. If the subject stops before the 6 minutes are up and refuses to continue

 (or you de cide that they should not continue), wheel the chair over for the subject to sit 
on, discontinue the walk, and note on the worksheet the distance, the time stopped, and 
the reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_224687].  
When the timer is 15 seconds from completion, say  this: "In a moment I'm going to tell 
you to stop. When I do, just stop right where you are and I will come to you."  
When the timer rings (or buzzes), say: "Stop!" Walk over to the subject. Consider taking 
the chair if they look exhausted. Mark the spot w here they stopped by [CONTACT_1299] a bean 
bag or a pi[INVESTIGATOR_113990].  
1. Post-test: Record the post walk Borg dyspnea and fatigue levels and ask 
this: "What, if anything, kept you from walking farther?"  
2. If using a pulse oximeter, measure SpO [ADDRESS_535734] the number of laps from the counter (or tick marks on the 
worksheet).  
4. Record the additional distance covered (the number of meters in the final 
partial lap) using the markers on the wall as distance guides. Calculate the 
total distance walked, rounding to the nearest meter, and record it on the 
worksheet.  
5. Congratulate the subject on the good effort and offer a drink of water.

ask this: Please grade your level of fatigue using this scale. Document the grade 
chosen.  
At the end of the walk, remind  the subject of the breathing number they chose before 
the walk and ask the subject to grade their breathing level again. Then ask the subject 
to grade their level of fatigue, after reminding them of their grade before the walk.

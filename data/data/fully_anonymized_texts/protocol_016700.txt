Optimizing Haploidentical Aplastic Anemia Transplantation (CHAMP)  
 
Study Chair person s: Amy E. DeZern, M.D., M.H.S. and  Michael A. Pulsipher, M .D. 
 
Primary Objective:  Assess overall survival (OS) at [ADDRESS_672042] -hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (HSCT) from a haploidentical marrow donor in 
patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA).  
 Secondary Objectives:  Assess the proportion of patients alive and engrafted; neutrophil and platelet recovery ; graft failure (primary and se condary);  grade s 
II-IV acute GVHD and chronic GVHD ; immune reconstitution; 
incidence of CMV viremia/ disease and EBV viremia/ post-
transplant lymphopr oliferative disease (PTLD) . 
 Correlative Studies : ATG pharmacokinetic (PK) profile in transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] ; pre-
HSCT telomere length in all consenting patients and consenting haplo donors . 
 Study Design:    This study is a prospective, multicenter  phase II study with patients 
receiving  haploidentical  transplantation for SAA.  
 Accrual Objective:   The goal is to transplant 30 patients on the protocol.  Additional 
patients may be screened, consented, and registe red in order to 
reach accrual goals.  
 Accrual Period:   The estimated accrual period is 3 years.  
 Eligibility Criteria:  Diagnosis of SAA, without a fully matched related sibling  donor 
available, but with a haplo marrow donor available.  Exclusions include i nherited bone marrow failure syndrome, previous 
hematopoietic  stem cell or solid organ transplant, uncontrolled 
infection, inadequate organ function, and performance score <  60. 
 Treatment Description:  Patients will be treated with a preparative regimen of fludarabine (150 mg/m2), cyclophosphamide (29 mg/ kg, low dose TBI (200 
cGy), and Thymoglobulin
® (4.5 mg/kg).   GVHD prophy laxis will 
be with post -HSCT cyclophosphamide (100 mg/ kg), tacrolimus, 
and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) . 
 Study Duration:   Patients will be followed for [ADDRESS_672043] -transplant. 
 Interim Analysis:              No formal interim analyses for efficacy or futility will be used.

 iii Safety Monitoring:  Graft failure and mortality are the key safety endpoints to be 
monitored on the study so that if rates significantly exceed pre -set 
thresholds, the NHLBI will be notified in order that the DSMB can be advised.  The rate of graft failure including both primary graft failure and secondary graft failure  by [CONTACT_2006] [ADDRESS_672044] (SPRT) based on a binomial test of proportions. The safety boundary for graft failure was developed from an SPRT 
contrasting 15% versus 35% graft failure rate and t he safety 
boundary for mortality was developed from an SPRT contrasting 10% versus 30% mortality rate.

 1-1 CHAPTER 1  
1 BACKGROUND AND STUDY RATIONALE  
1.1 Objectives  
 
The primary objective of this phase II study is to assess overa ll survival in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_518013]  (haplo)  donor grafts at [ADDRESS_672047] -hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
(HSCT) in patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA).  
 
Secondary endpoints include assessment of overall survival, rejection free survival, neutrophil 
and platelet engraftment, graft fail ure, grade II -IV acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, immune 
reconstitution, and infectious complications.  Additional biological correlative studies include 
measurement  of antithymocyte globulin ( ATG)  pharmacokinetics (PK)  for correlation with 
engraftment, GVHD, imm une reconstitution, and survival as well as measurement of telomere 
length for correlation with disease phenotype, engraftment, and survival . 
1.[ADDRESS_672048] in SAA  
 
Acquired SAA is a rare bone marrow failure disorder with an estimated annual incidence of 2 
cases per million and with over 600 new cases in the [LOCATION_002] each year.1, 2  The  majority of 
cases are thought to be related to autoimmune destruction of marrow microenvironment or hematopoietic stem cells; accordingly , the disease can be treated and often cured by [CONTACT_518044].
[ADDRESS_672049] from a human 
leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched sibling donor (MSD) has become the standard of care for younger, newly diagnosed patients
3, 4 with long- term survival rates close to 90% in patients 
under 20,5, 6 and around 76% for patients older than 20.6  However, if the patient has siblings, 
each of them only has a 25% chance of being a match based on HLA inheritance patterns.   
 
Horse ATG and cyclosporine (CSA) immunosuppressive therapy (IST) is generally front -line 
treatment for SAA patients who lack matched sibling donors or are not good candidates for 
HSCT.7  The hematopoietic response rate is 60 -70%.2  However, up to 40% of patients 
eventually relapse8 and an additional 10- 40% develop a secondary clonal diseas e.[ADDRESS_672050] been noted using 
reduced doses of total body irradiation (TBI) ,[ADDRESS_672051] disease (GVHD).  Some studies suggest that outcomes using HSCT with a fully matched unrelated donor (MUD) are similar to HSCT using a MSD.
13-17 Results of the BMT  
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
Optimizing Haplo for SAA –  Protocol 1502                                                                    Version 4.0 –  January 13, [ADDRESS_672052]  in SAA shows that of the 4 cyclophosphamide dose 
levels tested, 50 and 100 mg/kg in combination with ATG, fludarabine, and TBI (200 cGy) lead 
to better  outcome s than the 0 mg/kg or 150 mg/kg dose .12  Additio nally , it is well- recognized that 
bone marrow (BM) is the preferred source of stem cells over perip heral blood stem cells (PBSC) 
in the unrelated donor setting, similar to MSD HSCT for SAA.18-20   
 
Unfortunately, fully matched unrelated donors (HLA -A, B, C, DRB1) from worldwide registries 
can be identified for about 80% of Caucasian s and for much lower percentages of persons of 
other races and/or ethnicities .21 Outcomes using unrelated adult donor s mismatched at a single 
HLA- locus  (7/8 HLA- matched ) have proven inferior to outcom es with fully matched unrelated 
donor s (MUD) , though allowing a single HLA -locus mismatched transplant greatly expands 
donor availability.21, [ADDRESS_672053] that inform our proposal.

1.2.2 Haplo  Donor Transplants in SAA  
 
The use of haplo donors for SAA transplantation has only more recently been attempted and accordingly there are only limited published data regarding outcomes with this approach. In small case series, rejection has been between 6% and 25%, acute GVHD between 12% and 30%, chronic GVHD between 20% and 40%, and overall survival between 62.5% and 84.6%.

Eight of the 29 patients received early low dose ATG (4.5mg/kg starting on Day  -9). The eight 
patients had documented acquired disease and received grafts from 5/[ADDRESS_672056]. Two additional pa tients had inherited 
syndromes: one with Diamond Blackfan who received a graft from a 5/[ADDRESS_672057] percentile in length with a presumed familial syndrome who received a 9/10 unrelated graft.  Median follow -up time is 17.5 months (range 5- 49). The median 
age was 34 years (range 17 -54) with 6 patients greater than age 30 years and 50% were males. 
Median time to neutrophil engraftment was 18 days (range 16 -24).  Median time to red cell 
engraftment was 25 days (r ange 16 -48). Median time to platelet engraftment was 27.5 days 
(range 22 -108).  At the time of BMT, six patients had PNH clones and all were eliminated. All 
patients are alive and well, fully engrafted with 100% donor chimerism in blood and marrow. Two pat ients had grade I-II skin acute GVHD.  These two patients also had mild chronic GVHD 
of the skin/mouth requiring systemic steroids.  One patient was able to come off all immunosuppression by [ADDRESS_672058] that the rabbit preparation of ATG (rATG 
– Thymoglobulin®) results in improved outcomes compared to the horse preparation (hATG – 
Atgam®) when used in HSCT for SAA.  In a C IBMTR study presented in abstract form, grades 
II-IV acute GVHD at  Day  100 were lower with rATG compared to hATG for unrelated donor

 1-5 transplants.  This advantage was not seen for hematopoietic recovery, chronic GVHD, or overall 
survival.31 
 We know a great deal about pharmacokinetics (PK) of medications in HSCT , such as busulfan, 
where doses are individualized based on levels.
[ADDRESS_672059] GVHD.34, 35  Recently , a population PK mode l has been created for the Thymoglobulin® 
preparation of ATG.  This model allows for individualized dosing that can achieve target area under the curve (AUC) ATG exposures pre - and post -HSCT.  Dosing is based upon body weight  
and absolute  lymphocyte count  measured just prior to starting the HSCT preparative regimen .
[ADDRESS_672060] AUC  of ATG 
and outcomes.  Admiraal and colleagues in the Netherlands demonstrated in 251 patients ( mostly 
children, n =  116 malignant disease, n =  69 benign disease, n =  15 marrow failure , and n = 51 
immune deficiency ) that when the post -HSCT AUC was <  20 AU*day/mL there was improv ed 
immune reconstitution as shown by [CONTACT_518046]4 counts (p <  0.0001 on logistic regression 
fitting).[ADDRESS_672061] blood.  Successful immune reconstitution was in turn 
associated with improved overall survival compared to unsuccessful immune reconstitution (56% vs. 75%, p <  0.001).  A low ATG post -HSCT AUC (<  20 AU*day/mL in UCB or <  50 
AU*day/mL in marrow) was itself associated with improved o verall survival for patients with 
benign diseases receiving a cord blood graft (91% vs. 57%, p =  0.013) and for all patients that 
received matched bone marrow or PBSC graft (93% vs. 76%, p =  0.014)  as seen in F igure  1.

 With all stem cell sources included, the ATG post -HSCT AUC did not have an influence on 
GVHD.  When looking at cord blood transplants alone, with lower ATG post -HSCT AUC there 
was a higher rate of grades II -IV acute GVHD, but no difference in grades III -IV acute GVHD

These results suggest that early and targete d ATG could improve outcomes in HSCT  as depi[INVESTIGATOR_45991] 3, al though these data are primarily in children and with a limited population of SAA 
patients.  Given that haplo donors have been a very small part of the data set to date  and with the  
encouraging outcomes to date  using a fixed ATG dose level of 4.5mg/kg in the Johns Hopkins 
single center experience, we will use a fixed ATG dosi ng in this haplo cohort  study.  However, 
we will perform ATG PK testing on the haplo cohort as well to assess whether the pre-  and post -
AUC levels achieved with fixed dosing correlate with outcome s.

2.3.1) .  
2. When more than one donor is available, the donor with the lowest number of HLA allele mismatches will be chosen unless there is HLA cross -match incompatibility or a medical 
reason to select otherwise.  In cases where there is more than one donor with the l east 
degree of mismatch, donors will be selected based on the most favorable combination of HLA compatibility in cross -match testing and ABO compatibility.  Prioritization is given 
to the lowest number of mismatches in the host -versus -graft (HVG) direction  to minimize 
the risk of graft failure .
[ADDRESS_672072] amount of HVG allele mismatches, the suggested prioritization in  order of importance includes ABO compatibility, CMV status 
(use a sero -negative donor for a sero- negative recipi[INVESTIGATOR_518020] a sero -positive donor for a 
sero-positive recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]), younger age and lighter weight (this rule applies down to the age 
of 18, however, children may also be used as donors if appropriate), and sex of the donor (if all else is equal, males are preferred over nulliparous females over multiparous females).

2.5.1 Conditioning and GVHD Prophylaxis  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Conditioning  for Haplo  Bone Marrow Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]  
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Fludarabine  
Fludarabine dose will be 30 mg/m2 IV daily for 5 days from Day  -6 to Day  -2 (total dose 
received 150 mg/m2).   Fludarabine will be dosed on body surface area based upon the 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s actual body weight  if the patient is < 125% of ideal body weight (IBW). For patients 
> 125% of IBW, fludarabine will be dosed on body surface area based upon the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s 
adjusted ideal body weight (AIBW) .  For patients who have a n estimated or measured creatinine 
clearance < 70 mL/min/1 .73 m2, or prior brain radiation, or prior intrathecal chemotherapy, the 
fludarabine dose should be reduced by 20%.  Fludarabine dosing is based on the last creatinine 
clearance prior to the start of conditioning. F ludarabine dose should be the same on Day s -6 to -
2, even if the patient’s creatinine changes.   
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_672073] Cyclophosphamide  
Cyclophosphamide dose will be 14.5 mg/kg IV daily for 2 days from Day  -6 to Day  -5 and 
administered as a 1 -2 hour infusion (total dose received 29 mg/kg). Cyclophosphamide  dosing 
should be based on recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s total body weight (TBW) i n all patients  < 125% of IBW, and 
adjusted ideal body weight (AIBW) in all patients ≥ 125% of IBW  as per Appendix E . 
Hydration, as well as doses and schedule for uroprotective agents (i.e., mesna), may be administered per institutional practice.  Mesna has generally been utilized for the Day  +3 and 
Day +[ADDRESS_672074] doses.

Thymoglobulin® preparation of ATG will be dosed upon actual body weight. The dose wi ll be 
0.5 mg/kg IV on Day  -9 over 6 hours and 2 mg/kg IV on Day s -8 and -7 over 4 hours. 
Premedication should follow local institutional practice with suggested minimum of 1 mg/kg 
methylprednisolone in children and up to 100 mg in adults prior to the infus ion (equivalent 
steroid allowed), preferably repeated in 3 -4 hours during the infusion.  Note: Thymogl obulin® is 
the required preparation of ATG for this study . Patients will not be eligible if the treating 
center plans to use other preparations of ATG.   Pharmacokinetic corollary labs should be drawn as outlined in Appendix C. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Haplo  Marrow Product Handling & Infusion  
Patients will receive unprocessed marrow unless  there is a major ABO incompatibility, in which 
case red blood cells will be depleted from the donor marrow using institutional practices.  
Institutional practices will determine if there will be processing for minor ABO incompatibilities.  Donor bone marr ow will be harvested with a target yield of [ADDRESS_672075] to be infused will be sent for flow cytometry to determine the content of CD34+ cells.  The use of cryopreserved marrow is not permitted. Please refer to Appendi x G for additional bone marrow 
harvesting guidelines.  
The protocol team will begin implementing a review process in regards to bone marrow 
harvesting at participating sites. As a requirement for site activation, a copy of the site’s SOP for 
bone marrow harves t will be collected along with total nucleated cell dose /kilogram patient 
weight and product volume for the last 2 harvests performed at the site. This is to ensure that participating sites are experienced in bone marrow harvesting and the rec ommended TNC can  be 
attained for all patients enrolled on 1502. 
Note: The patient is not to receive steroids as an antiemetic or any other 
immunosuppressive agent from Day  [ADDRESS_672076] 24 hours after completion of Day  +4 
cyclophosphamide dose  unless us ed for adrenal support or during medical emergency (e.g., 
treatment of anaphylaxis) . In the event that a patient requires steroids , please notify the

Cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg IV daily will be given for 2 days , Days +3 to +4 (total dose 
received 100 mg/kg)  after transplantation . Cyclophosphamide and mesna given post transplant 
will be dosed based on IBW , unless actual body weight is less than IBW , in which case use 
actual body weight.  If the patient weighs >  125% of IBW, cyclophosphamide will be dose d 
according to the adjusted IBW.  Hydration, as well as doses and schedule for uroprotective 
agents (i.e. , mesna) , should follow local institutional practice.   Mesna has generally been utilized 
for the Day  +3 and Day  +[ADDRESS_672078] 
doses.

treat according to institutional practice .  If the patient develops persistent EBV viremia or 
signs/symptoms of EBV -related post -transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) despi[INVESTIGATOR_518022], treatment is recommended  according to institutional practice.  
HHV- 6 viremia as tested by [CONTACT_518056]  +60.  
If the patient becomes viremic they are treated according to institutional practices.  
In addition, all Grade 2 and 3 infections will be reported according to the BMT CTN MOP . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of graft failure  
Patients experiencing primary  or secondary graft failure are managed according to institutional 
practices.  
For this protocol, lineage -specific, myeloid and T cell chimer isms are required. Myeloid 
engraftment m ight not proceed at the same rate as T cell engraftment. If myeloid has greater than 
or equal to 5% donor, even if T cell compartment does not, this is not considered primary graft failure.  
In the event that Day 100 chimerism results at less than 50% donor in either myeloid or T cell compartment, additional chimerism testing of the same compartment s hould be performed every 
4 weeks or as clinically indicated until the chimerism is greater than or equal to 50% donor and/or stabilizes . 
Management of graft failure as defined in this protocol is per institutional standards. Fixed chimerism not defined as graft failure should be managed per Appendix H .

2.5.4 Risks and Toxicities  
[IP_ADDRESS] General  
The agents being used in the study are used extensively in the HSCT setting and have well -
defined toxicity profiles.  In addition, there are many expected toxicities of allogeneic HSCT.  
The following are examples of toxicities that are serious but not une xpected: Grade 4 cytopenias; 
neutropenic fever and sepsis ; bacterial, fungal, or viral (including CMV, BK virus) infection; 
severe mucositis; severe GVHD; hepatic veno -occlusive disease; pulmonary toxicities; 
hemorrhagic cystitis; bleeding without hemodyna mic compromise.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Drug Information  
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Fludarabine  
Fludarabine is a purine analog antimetabolite.  Side effects of fludarabine include:  
1) Neurotoxicity:  Agitation or confusion, blurred vision, loss of hearing, peripheral 
neuropathy, or weakness have been reported.  Severe neurologic effects, including blindness, coma, and death may occur; severe CNS toxicity is rarely seen with doses in the recommended range for non- transplant therapy. The dose used in this study is 
approximately 1.[ADDRESS_672081] been used in adult and pediatric patients witho ut observed increase in neurotoxicity. 
2) Anemia:  Life -threatening and sometimes fatal autoimmune hemolytic anemia has been 
reported after one or more cycles of therapy in patients with or without a previous history of autoimmune hemolytic anemia or a positiv e Coombs’ test and who may or may not be 
in remission.  Corticosteroids may or may not be effective in controlling these epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  The majority of patients re -challenged developed a recurrence of the hemolytic process.  
3) Cardiovascular:  Deep venous thrombos is, phlebitis, transient ischemic attack, and 
aneurysm (1%) are reported.    
4) Fever:  60% develop fever. 
5) Rash:  15% develop a rash, which may be pruritic.  
6) Digestive: Gastrointestinal side effects include: nausea/vomiting (36%), diarrhea (15%), 
stomatitis (9% ), anorexia (7%), GI bleeding and esophagitis (3%), mucositis (2%), liver 
failure, abnormal liver function test, constipation, dysphagia (1%) and mouth sores.  
7) Some other side effects include: Chills (11%), peripheral edema (8%), myalgias (4%), osteoporosi s (2%), pancytopenia, arthralgias (1%), dysuria (4%), urinary tract infection 
and hematuria (2%); renal failure, abnormal renal function test, and proteinuria (1%); and, very rarely, hemorrhagic cystitis and pulmonary toxicity.

[IP_ADDRESS] Cycl ophosphamide  & Mesna  
Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent whose metabolites form cross -links with DNA 
resulting in cell cycle -nonspecific inhibition of DNA synthesis and function.  Cyclophosphamide 
side effects include: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, hemorrhagic cystitis, fluid 
weight gain/edema, SIADH, transaminitis, cardiomyopathy, pericarditis, rash, mucositis, alopecia, cytopenias, sterility, and, rarely, seco ndary myelodysplastic syndrome and anaphylaxis. 
Dose adjustments  for cyclophosphamide will not be made.  
Mesna  (sodium -2-mercapto ethane sulphonate) is a prophylactic agent used to prevent 
hemorrhagic cystitis induced by [CONTACT_12786] (cyclophosphamide and ifos famide).  It 
has no intrinsic cytotoxicity and no antagonistic effects on chemotherapy.  Mesna bi nds with 
acrolein, the urotoxic metabolite produced by [CONTACT_12786], to produce a non- toxic 
thioether and slows the rate of acrolein formation by [CONTACT_12787] 4- hydroxy metabolites of 
oxasophosphorines.  
The total daily dose of mesna is equal to 80% of the total daily dose of cyclophosphamide. 
At the doses used for uroprotection, mesna is virtually non- toxic.  However, potential adverse 
effects include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, altered taste, rash, urticaria, 
headache, joint or limb pain, hypotension, and fatigue. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Thymoglobulin® 
Thymoglobulin® is a rabbit preparation of anti -thymocyte globulin (ATG) .  Common side effects 
include nausea, fever, chills, diarrhea, rash, dizziness, headache , and tiredness.  More serious 
side effect s can include severe allergic reaction, serum sickness, easy bleeding/bruising, 
fast/irregular heartbeat, joint/muscle pain, stomach/abdominal pain, and weakness.  Because this 
drug works by [CONTACT_518057], it lowers the ability to fight infec tions , including 
some viral infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) E pstein Barr virus (EBV), and Human 
Herpes Virus 6 (HHV -6).  No dose adjustments are required.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF)  
MMF is an ester prodrug of the active immunosuppressant  mycophenolic acid (MPA).  
Side effects include:  pancytopenia, infection (including sepsis, CMV, HSV, VZV, and Candida), 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, allergic reactions, hypertension, headache, dizziness, insomnia, hyperglycemia, electrolyt e imbalances, rash, and leg cramps/bone pain.  
Drug interactions:  MMF activity is decreased with oral antacids and cholestyramine. There are 
no pharmacokinetic interactions with cotrimoxazole, oral contraceptives, or cyclosporine.  Acyclovir or ganciclovir  blood levels may increase due to competition for tubular secretion. 
High doses of salicylates or other highly protein- bound drugs may increase the free fraction of 
MPA and exaggerate the potential for myelosuppression. 
Dose adjustments:  No dose adjustments are required for liver dysfunction.  For renal 
insufficiency, MMF dosing should not be modified unless dialysis is needed, in which case MMF can be reduced to 25 -50% of the starting dose. If toxicity is suspected, a trough 
mycophenolic  acid ( MPA ) level should be checked. If the level is greater than 2, it will require a

[IP_ADDRESS] Cyclosporine  (CSA ):  
Cyclosporine (CSA) is a calcineurin inhibitor used for immun osuppression.  Administration may 
cause nephrotoxicity, seizures, tremor s, headaches, abdominal pain or indigestion, edema, 
confusion, muscle cramps, dizziness, hemolytic anemia, hypertension, hirsutism, thrombotic 
microangiopathy, electrolyte imbalances, paresthesia/neuropathy, gingival hyperplasia, hypertriglyceridemia , diar rhea, transient blindness, renal dysfunction, and hepatic dysfunction.  
Drug interactions & Dose adjustments : CSA  is adjusted to maintain a serum trough level of 200-
400 ng/ mL by [CONTACT_518054] 250- 500 ng/mL by [CONTACT_331265].  Patients with hepatic or renal 
insufficiency should receive doses at the lower end of therapeutic concentrations.  No dose adjustments are required in patients undergoing hemodialysis.  There are interactions between the azole antifungal medications and CSA such that the dose of C SA should be empi[INVESTIGATOR_518023].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Tacrolimus  
Tacrolimus is a macrolide immunosuppressant that inhibits lymphocytes through calci neurin 
inhibition.   
Toxicities : There is a spectrum of well -described toxicities of tacrolimus. Toxicities include 
renal insufficiency, hypertension, hyperglycemia, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, nausea, diarrhea, headache, neurologic toxicity including tre mor and leukoencephalopathy, infection, and 
rarely thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). 
Drug interactions : Tacrolimus is well- absorbed orally.  Tacrolimus is extensively metabolized by 
[CONTACT_35233] P -450 (CYP3A4) system and metabolized products are  excreted in the urine.  
Drugs that may increase tacrolimus levels include tri-azole drugs  (especially voriconazole , 
isavuconazonium sulfate , and posaconazole ), nephrotoxic drugs, calcium channel blockers, 
cimetidine and omeprazole, metoclopramide , macrolide antibiotics, quinupristin/dalfopristin, 
danazol, ethinyl estradiol, methylprednisolone , and HIV protease inhibitors.  Drugs that may 
decrease tacrolimus levels include some anticonvulsants (phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050]), caspofungin, rifamycins, and St. John’s wort.   
Dose adjustments : The tacrolimus dose is adjusted to maintain a serum trough level of 5- 15 
ng/mL, with a target of 10- 15 ng/mL.  Pa tients with hepatic or renal insufficiency should receive 
doses at the lower end of concentrations  (5-10ng/mL) .  No dose adjustments are required in 
patients undergoing hemodialysis. 
Due to extreme interactions with voriconazole and posaconazole, the tacro limus dose 
should be empi[INVESTIGATOR_518024].  Guidelines are provided in the table below.  Dose adjustments for therapy with other azoles may be indicated.  However, the initial tacrolimus dose (on Day 5) remains fixed.  
Dosing considerations with concurrent azole therapy: Triazole antifungal medications are 
expected to increase serum CNI levels; therefore, dosages of CNIs should be adjusted 
accordingly. Guidelines are provided in the table below.  Of note, reversal of azole -mediated 
inhibition of CYP3A4 (and others) and P -glycoprotein is gradual when azoles are stopped.  
Therefore, immediate significant dose increases in tacrolimus are not advised when azoles are

2.5.5 Health Related Quality of Life (HR -QoL) Assessments  
[IP_ADDRESS] Instruments  
MOS SF -36: The Medical Outco mes Study Short Form 36 is a 36- item general assessment of 
HR-QoL with eight components:  Physical Functioning, Role Physical, Pain Index, General 
Health Perceptions, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role Emotional, and Mental Health Index.  Each domain is positively scored, indicating that higher scores are associated with positive outcome.  Thi s scale has been widely applied in a variety of outcome studies and is being used in 
this protocol as a generic measure of HR-QoL.  To facilitate comparison of the results with 
published norms, the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summ ary 
(MCS) will be used as the outcome measures in summarizing the SF -36 data.  These summary 
scores are derived by [CONTACT_518058] z -score for each scale by [CONTACT_518059].  Resulting scores are then transformed into T -
scores (mean  = 50; standard deviation =  10).  The SF -36 takes 6 minutes to complete.

3.1 Primary Endpoint  
3.1.1 Overall Survival  (OS)  
The primary endpoint is overall survival ( OS) at [ADDRESS_672085] . 
3.2 Secondary Endpoints  
3.2.1 Neutrophil Recovery  
Neutrophil recovery  is achieving an ANC >  0.5 x109/L for t hree consecutive measurements on 
different days, with the first of the three days being defined as the day of neutrophil engraftment.  
3.2.2 Platelet Recovery  
Platelet recovery  is defined by [CONTACT_139801] a platelet count >  20 x 109/L with no platelet 
transfusions in the preceding seven days.  The first day of the sustained platelet count will be 
defined as the day of platelet engraftment.  
3.2.3 Alive with S ustained Engraftment  
Being alive and engrafted is defined as not having experienced death, primary graf t failure, or 
secondary graft failure.  
Donor cell engraftment is defined as donor chimerism greater than or equal to  5% on or after 
Day 56 after transplantation. Chimerism may be evaluated in whole blood or blood cell fractions, 
including CD3 and CD33 or CD15 fractions. For this protocol, lineage- specific, myeloid , and T 
cell chimerisms  are required.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Graft Failure  
Primary graft failure is defined by [CONTACT_518060] D ay +[ADDRESS_672086]  5% donor chimerism (whole blood or marrow)  on any  measurement up 
to and including D ay +56.   
For this protocol, lineage -specific, myeloid , and T cell chimerism s are required. Myeloid 
engraftment might  not proceed at the same rate as T cell engraftment. If myeloid has greater than 
or equal to 5% donor, even if T cell compartment does not, this is not considered primary graft failure.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Graft Failure 
Secondary graft failure is defined as any one  of the following:   
1. Initial neutrophil engraftment (ANC greater than or equal to 0.5 x109/L measured for 
three consecutive measurements on different days) followed by [CONTACT_518061]   [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

4 PATIENT  ENROLLMENT AND EVALUATION 
4.1 Enrollment Procedures  
Patients will be  registered using the BMT CTN Electronic Data Capture System 
(AdvantageEDCTM).  The following procedures should be followed:  
1. Prior to initiation of the conditioning regimen, an authorized use r at the transplant center 
completes the  Demographics Form and Segment 0  Enrollment Form in AdvantageEDC , 
at which point a study number will be generated. After patient is enrolled on Segment 0, 
the authorized user should complete the HLA Forms to verify a n eligible HLA match 
score.  This eligibility screening includes a question confirming that the patient (or legally 
authorized representative) signed informed consent.  T he eligibility screening also 
includes a question confirming that the donor (or legal guardian) signed informed 
consent, agrees to provide marrow, and weighs at least 20 kg. 
2. After filling out the HLA Forms, the authorized user will be able to enroll the patient on Segment A using the Segment A Enrollment Form. The patient is not offic ially enrolled 
on study and may not begin study treatment until they are enrolled on Segment A.    
3. A visit schedule based on transplant date is displayed for printing and is refe rred to as 
“Segment A Follow -up”.

4.2.2 Case Report Forms  
Criteria for Forms Submission : Criteria for timeliness of submission for all study forms are 
detailed in the  Forms Guide .  Forms that are not entered into AdvantageEDCTM within the 
specified time will be considered delinquent.  A missing form will continue to be requested 
either until the form is entered into AdvantageEDC TM and integrated into the Data Coordinating 
Center’s (DCC) master database, or until an exception is granted and entered into the Missing Form Exception File, as detailed in the Forms Guide . 
Reporting Patient Deaths:  Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_518025] 24 business hours of knowledge of the patient’s death.  If the cause of death is unknown at that time, it does not need to  be recorded at that time.  However, once the cause of death is 
determined, the Death F orm mus t be updated in AdvantageEDC
 TM. 
CIBMTR Data Reporting: Centers participating in BMT CTN trials must register pre - and 
post-transplant outcomes on all consecutive hematopoietic stem cell transplants done at their 
institution during their time of participation to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR).  Registration is done using procedures and forms of the Stem Cell Transplant Outcomes Database (SCTOD).  (Note: Federal legislation requires submission of these fo rms for all US allotransplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].)  Enrollment on BMT CTN #[ADDRESS_672089] their information reported to the CIBMTR.  
Weekly GVHD Monitoring :  GVHD should be monitored in accordance with BMT CTN 
guidelines as specified in the Manual of Procedures.  Patients should be assessed weekly until Day + [ADDRESS_672090] -transplant for GVHD.  After Day +100, patients will be assessed at each follow -
up visit  through 12 months for the presence of GVHD.  For scheduling, a target day range has 
been provided in Table 4.2.1. 
4.2.3 Adverse Event Reporting  
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions  
Adverse Event : An adverse event (AE) is any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition 
or experience that develops or worsens in severity after starting the first dose of study treatment 
or any procedure specified in the protocol, even if the event is not considered to be related to the study.   
Expectedness : An adverse event can be Expected or Unexpected  
• Expected adverse events  are those that have been previously identified as resulting from 
administration of the agent. For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered

Optimizing Haplo for SAA –  Protocol 1502                                                                    Version 4.0 –  January 13, [ADDRESS_672091], the Investigator’s  Brochure, 
the package insert or is included in the informed consent document as a potential risk. 
• Unexpected adverse events  are those that vary in nature, intensity or frequency from 
information in the current adverse event list, the Investigator’s Brochure, the package 
insert, or when it is not included in the informed consent document as a potential risk. 
Serious Adverse Event:  A serious adverse event (SAE), as defined by [INVESTIGATOR_11826] 21 CFR 312.32, is 
any adverse event that results in one of the following outcom es, regardless of causality and 
expectedness:  
• Results in death 
• Is life -threatening.  Life -threatening means that the person was at immediate risk of 
death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form.  
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  (i.e., the event required at least a 24 -
hour hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57891] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57892]). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_151958]/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during the study 
period, but planned prior to study entry are not considered SAEs if the illness or disease existed before the person was enrolled in the trial, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned).  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.  Disability is defined as a 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  
• Is a congeni tal anomaly or birth defect;  or 
• Is an important medical event  when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may 
jeopardize the participant and require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medica l events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Medical and scientif ic judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expected reporting is 
also appropriate in situations other than those listed above.  For example, important medical events may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_518026] (eg, suspected transmission of an infectious agent by a medicinal product is considered a Serious Adverse Event). Any event is considered a Serious Adverse Event if it is associated with clinical signs or symptoms judged by [CONTACT_8127] a significant clinical impact.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Required Adverse Event Reporting  
Adverse event reporting will be consistent with BMT CTN procedures (BMT CTN Admin istrative Manual of Procedures, Chapter 6). It is BMT CTN policy that AEs must be 
reported even if the investigator is unsure whether a relationship exists between the adverse event and the use of study treatment.  Unexpected, serious adverse events (SAEs)  will be 
reported through an expedited AE reporting system via AdvantageEDC.  Unexpected, life -

patients re ceiving the first dose of ATG.  The rationale for monitoring mortality from the first 
day of ATG preparation in all patients receiving the first dose of ATG is to guard against 
excessive early mortality  including death due to the intervention in patients who never proceed to 
transplant , although this event is expected to be extremely uncommon.  The monitoring period 
for mortality is set to [ADDRESS_672105] -transplant evaluation for patients receiving a transplant.   
Graft failure  and mortality will be monitored so that if rates significantly exceed pre -set 
thresholds, the NHLBI will be notified in order that the DSMB  can be advised.  Policies and 
composition of the DSMB are described in the BMT CTN's Manual of Procedures.  The pausing guidelines serve as a trigger for consultation with the DSMB for additional review and are not formal “stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]” that would manda te automatic closure of study enrollment.  
A truncated Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) based on a binomial test of proportions 
will be used to monitor each safety endpoint as described below.  This sequential testing procedure conserves type I error across all of the monitoring looks for e ach endpoint, but not 
across endpoints.  The SPRT can be represented graphically.  At each interim analysis, the number of patients evaluable for the endpoint is plotted against the total number of patients who have experienced the event.  The continuation region of the SPRT is defined by [CONTACT_110893].  Only the upper boundary will be used for monitoring to protect against excessive graft failure  or mortality.  If the graph falls above the upper boundary, the SPRT rejects the null 
hypothesis, and concludes that graft failure  or mortality is higher than predicted by [CONTACT_518066].  Otherwise, the SPRT continues until enrollment re aches the target goal.  
The usual measures of performance of an SPRT are the error probabilities α  and β  of rejecting 
H
0 when θ  = θ 0 and of accepting H 1 when θ  = θ 1, respectively, and the expected sample size 
E(N|θi).  Note that since the test uses only the  upper boundary, and is truncated by a finite 
sample size, the size of the test will be slightly lower than the nominal level.

2. Study Background 
The National Institutes of Health (NIH), through the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN), is providing staff support and money for this re search study. The 
BMT CTN and the NIH will make decisions together about how to manage the study.  
An allogeneic transplant  uses blood- making cells from a related donor (family member) or an 
unrelated donor  (not a family member) to replace your diseased bl ood cells. Before your 
transplant, you will get chemotherapy with radiation to destroy the diseased cells.  After chemotherapy, the healthy cells from your donor are given to you. The new cells go into 
your bloodstream through an intravenous (IV) catheter (or tube). It’s just like getting blood or 
medicine through an IV. The donor cells find their way into your marrow where most often they 
grow and start to make healthy new red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. 
For this study, the cells used for your transplant will come from b one marrow  (related donor) , 
which is  soft, spongy tissue inside of bones. The bone marrow will come from a half -matched 
(haploidentical) family member such as a sister, brother, child or parent. This means that you and

is called a haploidentical transplant . ‘Haplo’ means half.   
3. Study Purpose  
We invite you to take part in this study because you have s evere aplastic a nemia (SAA) and an 
allogeneic transplant is a treatment option for you. We’re doing this study to learn how well 
SAA patients do with transplants that use haploidentical bone marrow.  
4. Rights to Ask Questions and/or Withdraw  
You have the right to ask questions about the study at any time. If you have questions about your 
rights as a participant or if you want to leave the study, please contact:

Being in this study is voluntary. You can choose not to be in this study or leave this study at any 
time. If you choose not to take part or leave this study, it will not affect your regular medical care 
in any way.  
Your study doctor and study staff will be available to answer any questions that you may have 
about taking part in or leaving this study.  
5. Study Treatment and Tests  
If you join the s tudy, we will check your health before you start treatment, while you receive 
treatment, and for [ADDRESS_672122] several check -ups and tests to see if you can be in the study. These check -
ups and tests are part of your regular care. They would be done even if you were not part of this study. These tests include:  
 Medical history  
 Physical exam, height, and weight  
 Blood and urine tests  
 Heart function tests  
 Lung (pulmonary) function tests; for children, pulse oximetry test to measure how much oxygen is in your blood.  
 Bone marrow tests. These tests are called aspi[INVESTIGATOR_117041]. Samples of your marrow will be taken from your hip bone with a large needle.  
 A pregnancy test if you are a woman and able to have children (if you are pregnant, you 
will not be able to join this study).

B-4 During Your Treatment   
If the check -ups and tests show that you can be in the study, you’ll get  a bone marrow transplant 
from a h alf-matched (haplo -identical) family member.  
Before Your Transplant : 
The conditioning regimen is the combination of chemotherapy drugs (chemo) and radiation 
you’ll receive before you get your donor cells. This helps the donor cells start to grow and make new cells in your bone marrow (engraft).  
A common side effect of allogeneic transplant is Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD). It’s a medical condition that can be very serious (see Risks and Toxicities Related to Transplant under  
Section 6: Risks and Discomf ort).   
GVHD happens because of differences in your immune cells (host) and your donor’s immune 
cells (graft). The  donor cells might see your cells as foreign and attack them, causing GVHD to 
happen. Your doctor will give you drugs to help prevent  GVHD fro m happening.  
Your doctor will use the following drugs and radiation to prepare your body for transplant:  
 Thymoglobulin
®, also known as anti -thymocyte globulin, rabbit ATG and rATG  
(helps the donor cells engraft in your body and is also a GVHD prevention drug)  
 Fludarabine  and Cyclophosphamide  (chemotherapy drugs)  
 Total body irradiation, TBI (radiation therapy given to the whole body to help weaken 
your immune system and prevent  rejection  of transplanted stem cells)  
The schedule of drugs you will receive to prepare your body for transplant is as follows:  
 We’ll give you Thymoglobulin® each day for 3 days, starting 9 days before your transplant 
(Day - 9 through Day - 7).  
 Then we’ll give you Fludarabine each day for 5 days, starting 6 days before your transplant (Day - 6 through Day - 2). 
 You’ll also get Cyclophosphamide for 2 days, starting 6 days before your transplant (Day 
-6 and Day -5).   
 Last, you’ll get a low dose of TBI the day before your transplant (Day - 1).  
After your transplant, you’ll also get drugs to help prevent GVHD:  
 You’ll get Cyclophosphamide  for 2 days, sta rting 3 days after your transplant (Day +3 
and Day +4).  Your doctor will give you this drug in your vein (IV).  
 We’ll give you Tacrolimus  daily starting 5 days after your transplant (Day +5). Your 
doctor will either give you this drug in your vein (IV) or you will take a pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382].

transplant (Day +5). Your doctor will either give you this drug in your vein (IV) or you 
will take a pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382].  
 You will continue to take Tacrolimus  (or a s imilar drug called Cyclosporine)  for about 6 
to 12 months, and MMF for about 5 weeks after your transplant or until there are no signs of GVHD.  
After your transplant, you will also get drugs to help speed up the recovery of white blood 
cells.  
 We’ll give y ou Filgrastim  (G-CSF) through your catheter or by [CONTACT_518069] 
5 days after your transplant (Day +5). You’ll get Filgrastim every day until your blood 
counts are at a safe level and then continue for three additional days before stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007].

Your Transplant:  
On your transplant day (Day 0), the donor cells from your haploidentical family member will be 
given to you through your catheter just like a blood transfusion. The cells will travel to your bone 
marrow where they will start to make new, healthy blood cell s. 
Health Evaluations:  
We will test (evaluate) your health during the study. These tests and how often they are 
scheduled are standard care for patients receiving an allogeneic transplant. They would be done even if you were not part of this study. You wil l be watched closely for any signs and symptoms 
of GVHD.  
After Your Treatment 
Health Evaluations after Transplant:  
 Routine blood tests (cell counts and liver and kidney function) two or three times per week 
until Day 28, then weekly until Day 100, and then at Days 180 and 365.  
 One of s ix protocol -required 5 mL (~1 teaspoon) blood samples from a vein in your arm  
on Day 7 ( 4 of the other protocol -required samples will be taken pre -transplant on the days 
you receive ATG  and 1 will be taken on the day of your transplant ). 
 Blood tests to see how well your immune system is working at Day 100, 180, and 365. 
 Blood tests to find the amount of donor cells in your body on Days 28, 56, 100, 180, and 
365.  This is called chimerism . 
 Blood tests to find out if you have any infections weekly until Day 100.  
 Physical exam to look for toxicities on Days 28, 56, 100, 180, and 365. 
 Physical exam to look for GVHD weekly until Day 100 and then at Days 180 and 365. 
 Health -Related Quality of Life Questionnaires: If you speak English and are [ADDRESS_672123] care. Your doctor will give you drugs to help 
lower the side effects, such as feeling sick to your stomach (nausea). In some cases, side effects

Optimizing Haplo for SAA –  Protocol 1502                                                                    Version 4.0 –  January 13, [ADDRESS_672124]. The chemotherapy drugs can cause leukemia years 
later, but this is rare. These “s econdary cancers” are often very hard to treat and can cause death.  
Risks and Toxicities Related to Transplant : 
The following problems may happen because of your transplant. These risks may happen if a transplant was done as part of the study or not. The risks are:  
Death due to infection or transplant complications:   Patients undergoing transplant for severe 
aplastic anemia are at risk of fatal complications due to several complications listed below 
(infection, organ damage, graft versus host disease, etc.).  Although approaches to haploidentical 
transplant included in this study may improve outcomes, in past studies, as many as 20- 40% of 
patients have had fatal complications using th is stem cell source.  
Slow recovery of blood counts:  The red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets can be slow 
to recover after a bone marrow transplant. Until your blood counts recover, you will need blood and platelet transfusions and you will be at risk for bleeding and infections. You’ll receive Filgrastim to speed the recovery of the white cells as much as possible.   
Graft failure: The stem cells (the “graft”) may fail to grow inside your body. Past experience 
suggests that there can be up to a 10 -  15% chance of graft failure. If graft failure occurs, you could 
have low blood counts for a long period of time. If your counts don’t recover, you may need to 
receive a second transplant. Graft failure can  be fatal.  
Graft -Versus -Host Disease (GVHD): GVHD happens when the donor cells recognize your body 
as foreign and attack it. In most cases, GVHD can be successfully treated. Sometimes GVHD is severe or difficult to treat and may lead to death. You will be watched closely for this complication and given drugs to prevent and/or treat it.  
Acute GVHD, which can happen 0 – [ADDRESS_672125] a biopsy (a small sample of your tissue to look at under the microscope) of your skin, gut, 
or, rarely, your liver.  
Damage to the vital organs in your body: The transplant could cause problems in any body organ 
such as the heart, lungs, l iver, gut, kidneys , bladder, or brain. The kidneys and the liver are most 
likely to be damaged. Some patients will experience serious lung problems from infections or the 
chemotherapy and radiation.  
Serious infections: Full and complete recovery of your i mmune system may take many months. 
During this time, there is an increased risk of infections. You will be prescribed certain drugs to 
reduce the chance of those infections. However,  these treatments do not always work. If you have 
an infection, you may ha ve to stay in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_504007] -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_504008].

Recurrence of disease or a new blood cancer: Your severe aplastic anemia may come back even 
if the transplant is successful at first. In rare cases, a new blood cancer may develop from the donor 
cells. Cyclophosphamide can cause damage to blood cells, which may result in a blood cancer 
such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The se blood 
cancer s usually develop 2 -  10 years after treatment, or 6 years on average. The risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a new blood cancer after allogeneic transplant is probably less than 2%. If cancer develops in your blood cells, you may require additional treatment with chemotherapy or another 
blood or marrow transplant. 
Risk to the unborn: The treatments in this study have not  been proven to be safe at any stage of 
pregnancy. Therefore, if you are pregnant or nursing, you are not eligible for this  study. Women 
who can become pregnant must use effective birth control while receiving chemotherapy, TBI, and drugs to prevent GVHD, and for 1 year after transplant. Effective birth control is defined as the following:  
1. Refraining from all acts of vaginal sex (abstinence)  
2. Consistent use of birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]  
3. Injectable birth control methods (Depo- Provera, Norplant)  
4. Tubal sterilization or male partner who has undergone a vasectomy 
5. Placement of an IUD (intrauterine device)  
6. Use of a d iaphragm with contraceptive jelly and/or condoms with contraceptive foam every 
time you have sex.  
Reproductive Risks:  
The drugs used in thi s research study may damage your reproductive organs, affect your ability to 
have children, or possibly cause birth defects if you take them while you are pregnant. It is 
important that a woman is not pregnant or breast -feeding and does not become pregnant during 
the course of the study. Women may also want to talk to their doctors about freezing eggs prior 
to tra nsplant. 
 If you are a woman and can become pregnant :  
You will need to take a pregnancy test before you start the study. You should discuss ways to prevent pregnancy while you are in the study. Women who have gone through puberty may find that their menstr ual cycle becomes irregular or stops permanently. This 
does not mean that you cannot become pregnant. You must still use an effective method 
of birth control during your transplant and continue until 1 year after transplant .

weeks before starting MMF, during treatment, and for 6 weeks after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_518032]. 
o In this study, you will be assigned to receive MMF for about 5 weeks, so you should not become pregnant during that tim e. If you think you might become pregnant or 
could become pregnant during the upcoming 5 weeks, you should not join the study.  
 If you are a man : 
Your body may not be able to produce sperm (become sterile). You should talk with your doctor about banking your sperm before having a transplant. You must still use an 
effective method of birth control during your transplant and continue until 1 year after 
transplant . 
Please check with your doctor to understand more about these risks.  
Unforeseen Risks :  
New risks might appear at any time during the study. These risks might be different from what is listed in this Consent Form. We will promptly tell you about new information that may affect your decision to take part in the study. We may learn new things about these types of  transplants 
that might make you want to stop being in the study. We will let you know if this happens and you 
can decide if you want to continue in the study.  
Other Treatments or Medications : 
Some medicines react with each other, and i t is important that you tell the study doctor or staff 
about any other drugs, treatments, or medicines you are taking.  This includes over -the-counter 
drugs, vitamins, and herbal treatments.  
It is also important that you tell the study staff about any cha nges to these medications during 
your participation in the study.

It’s optional to join this study. If you choose not to take part, you may still receive treatment with alternative immune suppressing therapy, new agents, or an allogeneic transplant to treat your 
disease. The transplant  treatment and evaluations you would receive could be very similar to 
what you would receive if you join this study.  
Your s tudy doctor will talk with you about your options. If you decide not to participate in this 
study, your medical care will not be affected in any way.  
Your other choices may include:  
 Treatment with a partially -matched related or unrelated donor  or another alternative 
donor source  
 Treatment with other drugs to suppress the immune system without a transplant  
 Treatment with drugs aimed at temporarily boosting your blood counts  or other new 
agents under investigation 
 Treatment with blood transfusions only 
 Comfo rt care  
Every treatment option has benefits and risks. Talk with your doctor about your treatment choices before you decide if you will take part in this study.
8. Possible Benefits 
 
Takin g part in this study may or may not make your health better. The information from this 
study will help doctors learn more about transplants for SAA. It could also help people with SAA that may need a transplant in the future.
9. New Information Availa ble During the Study  
 
During this research study, the study doctors may learn about new information about the study drugs or the risks and benefits of the study. If this happens, they will tell you about the new information.  The new information may mean that you can no longer participate in the study, or that 
you may not want to continue in the study.

B-19 18.   OPTIONAL Blood Samples for Trial -Related and Future Research 
Studies 
This section of the Consent Form is about collection of optional blood samples for trial -
specific and future research studies from people who are taking part in the study.  
You can choose to give blood samples for optional trial- specific and future research studies if 
you want to. You can still be a part of the main study even if you say “no” to giving optional 
blood samples for these studies. Please mark your choice at the end of this section. 
Researchers are trying to learn more about how the human body processes the drugs used for 
transplant and how the body recovers after transplant. This research is meant to gain knowledge that may help people in the future and make transplants even more successful.  
If you agree to provide optional blood samples, here is what will happen:  
 We’ll take 24 mL (about 5 teaspoons) from your catheter or by a vein in your arm if you are 
an adult  , or 12 mL (about 2.5 teaspoons) if you’re a child (< 20kg). We’ll collect this sample 
when you have your [ADDRESS_672135] them. DNA is in your blood, so we can study telomeres using blood samples. 
 At the same time, we will collect one additional 3 mL (about ⅔ teaspoon) blood sample. 
o This blood sample will be sent to the BMT CTN Bioreposi tory for processing and 
storage for future genomic research studies. A repository is a place that protects, stores, and sends out samples for approved research studies. All research samples will be given a bar code that cannot be linked to you by [CONTACT_518075]. A 
link to this code does exist. The link is stored at the Data and Coordinating Center for the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN DCC).  The staff at the Repository where your sample is being stored does not have a link to this 
code. Your research samples will continue to be stored at the BMT CTN Repository 
until they are used up for approved research.  
o These samples will be kept and may be used in research to learn more about immune 
recovery, GVHD, s evere aplastic anemia, cancer, and other diseases. When the samples 
are given to investigators for research, no information about your name, address, phone 
number, or other information that will let the researchers know who you are will be 
provided. 
o DNA fr om your stored blood samples and your health information might be used in 
genome -wide association (GWA) studies for a future project either done or supported

Optimizing Haplo for SAA –  Protocol 1502                                                                    Version 4.0 –  January 13, 2020  
B-20 by [CONTACT_7681] (NIH). Genome -wide association studies are a way 
for scientis ts to find genes that have a role in human disease or treatment. Each study 
can look at hundreds of thousands of genetic changes at the same time.  
o If your coded samples are used in such a study, the researchers are required to add your 
test results and sam ple information into a public research database. This public database 
is called the NIH Genotype and Phenotype Database and it is managed by [CONTACT_29070] (NCBI).  The NCBI will never have any 
information that would identify you, or link you to your information or research 
samples. However, the results of genetic studies could, in theory, include identifying information about you. 
Your name [CONTACT_518096] (such as address or 
social security number) will not be placed into any scientific database. However, 
because your genetic information is unique to you, there is a small chance that someone 
could trace it back to you. The risk of this happening is small, but may grow in the future. Researchers have a duty to protect your privacy and to keep your information 
confidential . 
Benefits  
The research that may be done with your blood samples is not designed specifically to help you. The benefits of research using blood samples include learning more about what causes GVHD, 
severe aplastic anemia, cancer, and other diseases, how to prevent them, and how to treat them.  
Risks  
There is a small risk of an infection or fainting from the blood draw.  
A possible risk is the loss of confidentiality about your medical information. We will do our best 
to make sure that your personal information is kept private. The chance that this information will 
be given to someone else is very small.  
Some general thin gs to think about when letting us store your blood samples for research are:  
 The choice to let us collect and/or store blood samples for future research is up to you.  No 
matter what you decide to do, it will not affect your care.  
 If you decide now that your blood samples can be collected and stored for research, you can change your mind at any time. Just contact [CONTACT_518076]. His/her mailing address is on the first page of this form. Then any unused blood samples that remain will 
no longer be stored for research. However, samples and information that have already been 
shared with researchers cannot be taken back or destroyed.  
 In the future, people who do research on these blood samples may need to know more about 
your health. While the study doctor or others involved in running this study may give the

B-21 researchers reports about your health, they will not give them your name, address, phone 
number, or any other information that will let the researchers know who you are.  
Sometimes blood is used for genetic research (about diseases that are passed on in 
families). Even if your blood is used for this kind of research, you will not be told of the 
results and the results will not be put in your health records.  
 Your blood will be used only for research and will not be sold. The research done with your blood may help to develop new products in the future. You will not get paid for any 
samples or for any products that may be developed from current or future research.  
 Reports about research done with your blood will not be given to you or your doctor.  These 
reports will not be put in your health record. The research will not have an effect on your care.  
Genetic Info rmation Nondiscrimination Act  
A new federal law (2009) called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and employers of [ADDRESS_672136] at [telephone number] . 
No matter what you decide to do, it will not affect your care . 
You can change your mind at any time about allowing us to use your samples and health information for research. However, samples and information that have already been shared with researchers cannot be taken back or destroyed.

B-27 Pediatric Patient Assent  
Study Title : Optimizing Haploidentical Aplastic Anemia Transplantation   
Protocol : BMT CTN 1502 
 Why am I here?  
We invite you to join this research study because you need a transplant to treat your severe 
aplastic anemia. We will replace your unhealth y blood cells with blood cells from one of 
your family members. The new cells will travel to your bones and start making healthy cells in your body.  
For this study, we will ask you for information about your health (health information) and for 
extra blood samples.   
 Why are you doing this study?  
We’re doing this study to learn how well patients with severe aplastic anemia do with transplants that use haploidentical bone marrow.  
 What will happen to me if I join the study?  
If you say you want to be in the study, we will:  
 Before your transplant:  
o Give you drugs to help your body get ready for the transplant. The drugs might make you feel sick. Your doctor will watch your health closely.  
o We will collect extra blood (about 1 teaspoon) [ADDRESS_672141] oth er blood tests done.  
 After your transplant:  
o We will collect extra blood (about 1 teaspoon) one  week after your transplant. 
o We will also give you drugs to help your body adjust to the new cells. The drugs 
might make you feel sick. Your doctor will keep wa tching your health after 
your transplant.  
You will be in the study for 1 year after your transplant. About 30 people will be in the study.

B-28  Will the blood draw hurt?  
When we collect your blood from a vein in your arm, it may feel like a pi[INVESTIGATOR_820]. It will hurt  for 
a minute and the place where the needle went might be red and sore. You might get a little 
bruise from the needle, but it goes away in a few days. 
 What if I have questions? 
You can ask any questions that you have about the study. If you forget to ask a question and 
think of it later, you can call me:  
 [insert office number].    
You can also ask your question the next time you see me.  
You can call the study office at any time to ask questions about the study. 
 How will you use my health information and b lood samples? 
Your health information and blood samples will be used for this study and for future research 
about transplant in patients with severe aplastic anemia.  
 How will you store my health information and blood samples ? 
Your blood samples will be sent to a qualified research lab for an important study.  
All research samples will be tied to a number. This number will not be linked to your name [CONTACT_518101].  
A. Will the study help me?  
We don’t know if this  study will help you or not. It may help other people who need a 
transplant in the future.  
B. Will I be paid to be in the study?  
No, you will not be paid to be in the study. It will not cost you anything to be in the study. 
C. Do I have to be in this study?  
If you don’t want to be in this study, you need to tell us and your parent or guardian.  
Your doctor will not be angry or upset if you do not want to join. You will still need to have

1.   Introduction 
We invite you to join this clinical trial, also known as a research study. You’re being asked to 
join because you’re a bone marrow donor for a family member who is going to receive a 
haploidentical (half -matched) transplant in the main study, BMT CTN 1502.  
This consent form is about a research study to learn how patients’ DNA changes after they get 
cells from a donor (transplant). We will compare your DNA to your family member’s DNA 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK   
Optimizing Haplo for SAA –  Protocol 1502                                                                    Version 4.0 –  January 13, 2020  
B-33 before and after their transplant. In order to do this study, we will need extra blood samples from 
you. 
It’s your choice to give blood samples. Even if you say 'no' to giving samples for this research 
study, your family member can still receive a transplant from you as part of the main study. If 
you agree to give blood samples, we will collect them at the same time you have routine blood tests done.   
This Consent Form will tell you about the purpose of the samples for research, the possible risks 
and benefits, other options available to you, and your rights as a research partic ipant.  
Everyone who takes part in research at [insert facility name]  should know that:  
 Being in any research study is voluntary. 
 You will not directly benefit from being in the study. Knowledge we gain from this study may benefit others.  
 If you give blood samples for future research, you can change your mind at any time.  
 If you decide to quit the study, it will not affect your care or the care of your family member 
at [insert name [CONTACT_518106]] . 
 Please ask the study staff questions about anything that you do not understand, or if you would 
like to have more information. 
 You can ask questions now or any time during the study. 
 Please take the time you need to talk about the study with your doctor, study staff, and your 
family and friends. It is  your decision to provide blood samples for future research. If you 
decide to join, please sign and date the end of the Consent Form.  
The National Institutes of Health (NIH), through the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical 
Trials Network (BMT CTN), are gi ving staff support and money for this research study.  
The BMT CTN will lead the research study and, along with the NIH, will make decisions  about 
how to manage the study. 
2.   Study Purpose  
We are collecting extra blood samples because we want to learn more about telomere length in donors and how it relates to outcomes (results) for transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], including engraftment and survival. Telomeres are caps at the end of DNA strands to prot ect them . DNA is in your 
blood, so we can study telomeres using blood samples.

Your study doctor and study staff will be  available to answer any questions that you may have.
4.   Study Treatments and Tests
If you agr ee to give blood samples , here is what will happen:  
a.) We will collect an extra blood sample at the same time you have routine blood tests done. 
For adults and children who weigh 44 pounds (20kg) or more : 
 We will collect 4 extra blood sample s at one time prior to your donation to look at your 
telomeres.  The amount of blood collected from you will be about 24 mL (about 5 
teaspoons ).   
For children who weigh less than 44 pounds (20 kg) : 
 We will collect 2 extra blood sample s at one time  prior to your donation to look at your 
telomeres.  The amount of blood collected from you will be 12 mL ( about 2.5 teaspoons ).   
b.) The blood samples will be sent to the Johns Hopkins l aborator y for processing and storage. 
All samples will be given a unique bar code that cannot be linked to you by [CONTACT_518082]. 
5.   Risks and Discomforts 
There are no major risks to having your blood drawn. It can be uncomfortable to have your blood 
taken and it can sometimes leave a bruise. You might faint, but this is unlikely to happen. Only trained people will take your blood.   
Information about the bo ne marrow donation process for this study can be found in a separate 
consent form. The transplant doctor or study coordinator will give you a copy of the donation 
consent form.

C-1 APPENDIX C : 
 
PROTOCOL -BASED LABORATORY PROCEDURES  
 
There is one protocol -required correlative laboratory study associated with the BMT CTN 1502 
trial. Study patients and consenting haplo- donors will also be provided the opportunity to 
participate in an optional correlative study. And finally, an optional opportunity will be offered 
to study patients to provide a single sample to be stored and used for future research.   
 
1) REQUIRED: Thymoglobulin® Pharmacokinetics (PK)  
 The objective of the first lab correlate to the clinical trial will be to collect PK samples for 
Thymoglobulin
® and to determine pre - and post -HSCT exposure levels (area under the curve, 
AUC) in all patient s.  These exposure levels will then be correlated with clinically relevant 
metrics, including engraftment, rejection, GVHD, immune reconstitution, and survival.    The PK assessment of Thymoglobulin
® will be performed at UMC Utrecht in the laboratory of 
Jaap Jan Boelens and Rick Admiraal.  Thymoglobulin® concentrations will be determined from 
plasma samples.  
 5 mL of blood for PK samples will be collected in an EDTA (lavender top) tube at 6 time points:  
 
1.) Upon completion of first dose  infusion (within 60 minutes)  
With this draw, the start and end of the first Thymoglobulin
® infusion (d- m-y 
hh:mm) and the timing of the sample  (d-m-y hh:mm) must be documented  
 
2.) Prior to infusion of second dose (within 60 minutes)  
With this draw, the timing of the sample (d -m-y hh:mm) must be documented  
 
3.) Upon completion of second dose infusion (within 60 minutes)  
With this draw, the start and end of the second Thymoglobulin® infusion (d -m-y 
hh:mm) and the timing of the sample (d -m-y hh:mm) must be documented  
 
4.) Upon completion of thi rd dose infusion (within 60 minutes)  
With this draw, the start and end of the second Thymoglobulin infusion (d- m-y 
hh:mm) and the timing of the sample (d -m-y hh:mm) must be documented  
 
5.) On day 0 (any time prior to stem cell infusion)  
CBC including absolute lymphocyte count should  be collected on Day 0 (if 
possible) along with the  PK sample and results documented in AdvantageEDC ; 
the timing of the sample (d -m-y hh:mm) should also be documented  
 
6.) On day 7 (no time restrictions)  
With this draw, the timing of the sample (d -m-y hh:mm) must be documented 
 
All blood samples should be placed on ice after collection and promptly taken for processing into

C-2 plasma within 6 hours of collection.  Samples should be maintained cold while handling and 
final samples should be frozen.  Please see the protocol -specific Research Sample Information 
Guide for detailed processing, aliquot labeling, and frozen sample shippi[INVESTIGATOR_4585].  
 Frozen samples will be batch -shipped on a biannual  basis to the BMT  CTN Bior epository 
managed by [CONTACT_267122].  Once the trial is complete and all PK samples obtained, they will then be transported together to UMC Utrecht for laboratory analysis.  
 
2) OPTIONAL:  Telomere Length Analysis  
 
The objective of the seco nd lab correlate to the clinical trial will be to collect whole blood 
samples from consenting patient s and each available consenting donor  to measure leukocyte 
telomere length.  The telomere lengths will then be correlated with clinically relevant metrics,  
including disease phenotype, engraftment , and survival for research purposes.   
 The telomere length will be measured by a CLIA -certified flow cytometry and FISH assay 
(Baerlocher Nature Protocols 2006) that is operated within the Johns Hopkins Pathology Laboratories (Armanios).  Subpopulations of leukocytes will include granulocytes and 
lymphocytes.  The blood required from the patient (pre -HSCT conditioning) and donor (pre -donation) at a 
single time point will include:  
Adults:  4 EDTA purple tops (6cc mL, 24cc total)  
This will ensure yields for leukopenic patien ts esp ecially  if it will be shipped on Fridays.  
 Children less than 20kg:  2 EDTA purple tops (6cc mL , 12cc total)  
 Please see the protocol -specific Research Sample Infor mation Guide  for detailed sample labeling 
and same- day sample shippi[INVESTIGATOR_4585] . 
 The blood tubes will be shipped on the day of collection to the Johns Hopkins project laboratory by [CONTACT_518086] .  No additional information will be provided to the patients 
or their treating physicians during the trial. Clinical correlations will be made in a retrospective fashion. 
 
3) OPTIONAL : Research Sample to Support Future Genomic Studies  
 
The objective of the optional research sample banking is to collect 3 mL of whole blood from all 
consenting patients pre -conditioning to support future genomic research.  Blood samples will be 
collected and processed at the clinical sites into three 1 mL cryovial aliquots and frozen. Please 
see the pr otocol -specific Research Sample Information Guide for detailed processing, aliquot 
labeling, and frozen sample shippi[INVESTIGATOR_4585]. Frozen whole blood samples will be batch -
shipped on a biannual  basis, along with the Thymoglobulin
® PK samples, to the BMT C TN 
Biorepository managed by [CONTACT_267122].

WEIGHT CALCULATIONS  
 
All chemotherapy doses will be calculated using weights determined as described below.  
 Dosing should be based on total body weight (TBW), if < 125% of IBW, and adjusted ideal body weight (AIBW) in all patients ≥ 125% of IBW.  
 Adjusted Ideal Body Weight (AIBW) Formula:  
     AIBW = IBW + [(0.25) x (actual body weight – IBW)]  
 Ideal Body Weigh t (IBW) for Patients greater than 17 Years of Age and older (Devine 
equation) : 
 
Males IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg/inch over 5 feet  
Females IBW = 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg/inch over [ADDRESS_672152] 2.3 kg/inch  
  Note for Centers using the metric system, the following equations  can be used:  
Males IBW = 50 kg + [(cm ÷ 2.54 – 60) x 2.3 kg]  
Females IBW = 45.5 kg + [(cm ÷ 2.54 – 60) x 2.3 kg]  
For patients less than 152.[ADDRESS_672153] 2.3 kg/2.54 cm  
 Ideal Body Weight (IBW) for Patients 1 to 17 Years of Age : 
  
Less than 60 inches  
IBW = (ht
2 x 1.65)/1000 where ht = cm, IBW = kg 
   More than 60 inches  
Males IBW = 39.0 + [2.27 x (ht -  60)] where ht = inches, IBW = kg  
Females IBW = 42.2 + [2.27 x (ht -  60)] where ht = inches, IBW = kg  
 Examples of calculations : 
  
EXAMPLE CALCULATION 1:  
A 62 year old female TBW 60 kg, height 64 inches   IBW = 54.7 kg  
 
EXAMPLE CALCULATION 2:  
62 year old female  Weight 86 kg, height 64 inches  
IBW 54.7 kg  
TBW/IBW = 86/54.7 = 157% IBW  
AIBW  = IBW + 0..25(TBW – IBW) = 54.7 + 0.25(86 – 54.7) = 62.5 kg

BONE MARROW HARVEST GUIDELINES  39 
 
Bone marrow is usually harvested from the posterior iliac crests while the donor is under 
regional (spi[INVESTIGATOR_476893]) or general anesthesia. Two individuals, usuall y a physician and a 
nurse practitioner or physician’s assistant, perform the harvest, one on each posterior iliac crest. The bone marrow cavity is entered through a skin puncture, after sterile preppi[INVESTIGATOR_518039]. 
The posterior superior iliac spi[INVESTIGATOR_518040] a starting anatomic landmark for the procedure. 
Larg e bore needles attached to [ADDRESS_672154] 
target for transplantation is 4 x 10
8 nucleated marrow cells per kg of the transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s 
ideal weight, so that the volume collected (generally between 500 and 1500 m L) will vary o n the 
size of the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_518041] ( see below). The aspi[INVESTIGATOR_518042]- closed or closed system of filters and a bag containing anticoagulant 
(Fenwall, BioAcess).  
 The collection is based on the target number of cells specified for the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. The nucleated cell/mL  should be assessed during the procedure with a cell count that is called back to the 
operating room. Calculation of the total volume needed to achieve the target dose should then be used to clinically determine the final harvest volumes. Erring on the high end is pref erred to 
underestimating doses. Equations used to calculate are as follows:  
 1. Prior to the procedure, determine the weight of the collection bag or tare the scale.  The weight of the product (total weight minus bag or weight above the tared wei ght) is then 
divided by 1.058, the specific gravity of marrow.  This result (A) is the volume of the 
marrow.  
2. The marrow nucleated cell count (B) is determined by [CONTACT_518090] l count from the lab 
in cells/mL  corrected by [CONTACT_518091]/mL  
presumed to be contaminating the marrow, and is then multiplied by [CONTACT_518092] (A) to calculate the total nucleated cells:   A x B = TNC.   (Example: if marrow count is 27 and 
peripheral white cell count is 6, then the marrow mononuclear cell counts would be 21 = B)  
3. TNC should then be divided by [CONTACT_518093]/kg achieved (target 4 x 
10
8 nucleated cells/kg recipi[INVESTIGATOR_12747]).

 APPENDIX H : 
 
GUIDANCE FOR MIXED CHIMERISM  
 
Chimerism measurements should be assessed as per protocol requirements (Table 4.2.4). Primary 
and secondary graft failure are also defined (Section 3.2.3 and [IP_ADDRESS]). There will be patients who meet cr iteria for mixed chimerism post- transplant who require special attention.  
 
Any donor chimerism below 99% in the myeloid or the T cell compartment should be considered mixed chimerism.   Less than 50% donor CD3 chimerism in the early post -transplant period has correlated in 
malignant diseases with increased risk of graft loss or rejection.  
 In aplastic anemia, a graft is considered functional if it results in correction of the underlying marrow failure with increase neutrophils and/or transfusion independence from baseline, even in the setting of mixed chimerism.  
 Low early T -cell chimerism could be a harbinger of rejectio n or may improve spontaneously 
over time.  
 Recommendations to avoid, and if it occurs , treat mixed chimer ism:  
 
1. Optimize all possible cell counts in the donor harvest to achieve at lea st a goal  of 3 x 10
8 
mononuclear cells/kg recipi[INVESTIGATOR_22593]. 
2. Ensure optimal compliance with all post- transplant immunosuppression.  
a. Mycophenolate mofetil should be given intravenously in patients in whom the oral preparation is not well tolerated  
b. Monitor levels of tacrolimus (as often as daily) to ensure therapeutic troughs of 10-15ng/mL. 
3. If post -Day 28, Day 56, or Day 100 chimerism is low, increase frequency of monitoring 
per protocol (table 4.2.4) , with monthly chimerisms until stable or resolved.  
4. Do not stop immunosuppression. Consider increasing levels to upper end of goa l range 
for tacrolimus or CSP.  
5. Do not give DLI for chimerism. For patients with poor graft function and established donor chimerism, CD34+ selected  cell boosts can be considered.  
6. Rule out additional immune phenomenon such a s large granular lymphocytosis.  
7. Rule out contribution of infections  or their treatments ( e.g. valganciclovir for CMV, other 
treatments for EBV, HHV6, etc.).  
8. Continue close clinical follow up.

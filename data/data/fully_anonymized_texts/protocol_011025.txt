ASQ -[ADDRESS_1039455] milking (UCM) for non- vigorous infants can improve outcomes 
compare d to immediately clampi[INVESTIGATOR_68619]. In 2016, the American College of Obstetricians 
and Gynecology Committee recommended a delay in umbilical cord clampi[INVESTIGATOR_68620]. They also stated 
that infants requiring resuscitation may benefit considerably from placental transfusion, but their need for immediate 
attention raises questions about whether they should undergo immediate or delayed umbilical cord clampi[INVESTIGATOR_68621] a unique benefit. Due to the lack of a clear recommendation for non- vigorous infants, 
obstetricians are currently milking or immediately clampi[INVESTIGATOR_68622]. It is imperative that a trial to demonstrate whether there is any benefit for providing the extra infant’s bl ood 
from the placenta at the time of delivery to non- vigorous infants.  
 We are hypothesizing that umbilical cord milking will reduce admission to the NICU compared to early  cord clampi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 
(ECC) . In addition, it may reduce developmental problems by [CONTACT_68690]. At birth, it is critical that an infant begins 
breathing quickly. The infant has to switch from relying on the placenta for oxygen to using its lungs for the first time. Worldwide each year, almost [ADDRESS_1039456] clampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], UCM results in better heart 
rate, blood pressure, less early anemia, and more oxygen in the brain,  however whether these benefits will occur in non-
vigorous infants and whether such benefits will improve clinical outcomes (like admission to the NICU and 
neurodevelopment) is unknown.  
 It is impossible to predict which infants will be non- vigorous prior to delivery and it is anticipated that about [ADDRESS_1039457] management 
for one year and then cross over to the other approach. This study involves comparing 2 approaches to treatment that are currently in widespread use.  We will be comparing outcomes of current practice variation applied with a standardized 
approach. All infants that were non- vigorous for each study year would be included in the study with collection of a 
minimal de -identified data set similar to a delivery room registry. The majority of these deliveries are emergent/urgent so 
we are requesting a waiver of antenatal consent  in order to perform this cluster randomized cross -over trial . Parents will 
be able to opt out prior to delivery by [CONTACT_68691], fliers and post -delivery when approach to collect long term 
follow -up data. The parents will be consented after delivery for  permission to collect ongoing information about their infant .

UCM – a simple, no- cost intervention as standard of care in term and near -term newborns needing resuscitation.  
II. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
Need for Research with Infants Requiring Resuscitation.  Each year approximately 6 million infants require resuscitation 
globally(1) . Neonatal morbidity and mortality remain high (2-4).  Several large epi[INVESTIGATOR_68624] a risk factor for hypoxic -ischemic -encephalopathy, cerebral palsy, attention deficit 
hyperactive disorder, autism, and neonatal stroke  (5-8). Improvements in delivery room management could significantly 
affect long- term outcomes. The recommended umbilical cord management for non- vigorous infants (limp, pale and not 
breathing) who need resuscitation is to immediately clamp the umbilical cord at birth  due to insufficient evidence for UCM 
(9).  
Umbilical Cord Milking May be Neuroprotective .  Preliminary evidence suggests umbilical cord milking (UCM) may be a 
neuroprotective mechanism that also facilitates cardiovascular transition for non- vigorous infants at birth and thus may 
reduce mortality and costly NICU admissions.  UCM provides a replacement cardiac preload before the placenta is removed 
from the circulation and increases blood volume which will improve cardiac output and increase pulmonary and cerebral 
circulation, thus mitigating further ischemia in an already compromised infant  (10). At present when there is a need for 
immediate neonatal resuscitation, neither of the currently practiced methods for facilitating a placental transfusion, UCM or  
delayed cord clampi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (DCC), are recommended  (11, 12) . Compared to immediate or early cord clampi[INVESTIGATOR_007] ( ECC), both 
UCM and DCC demonstrated improvements in systemic and brain perfusion, suggesting neuroprotective benefits  (13, 14) . 
DCC and/or UCM have been shown to improve heart rate, blood pressure, urine output and cerebral oxygenation, increase early hemoglobin levels, and prevent anemia in term and preterm infants without adverse effects or harm noted in any of 
the studies  (14-23). In contrast to DCC, UCM can achieve significant placental transfusion without postponing resuscitation 
and can be completed as quickly as E CC (24). It requires minimal training and no additional staff. The proven benefit for 
UCM in vigorous infants and the lack of studies in non -vigorous newborns is identified as a major knowledge gap 
by [CONTACT_68692] & Gynecologists ( ACOG ), which states “infants requiring resuscitation may 
benefit considerably from placental transfusion, but their need for immediate attention raises questions about whether they 
should undergo immediate cord clampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]” or “ whether umbilical cord milking may offer unique benefits ” (11). 
Facilitating a placental transfusion at birth improves iron stores and long- term neurodevelopmental outcomes in healthy 
term infants  (25, 26) . However, there are no published trials on non- vigorous newborns at birth preventing a 
recommendation for providing a placental transfusion in this highly at -risk population.  This study intervention will allow us 
to examine whether we can reduce this burden of morbidity and mortality in non- vigorous infants via umbilical cord milking 
(UCM).  
MINVI                                                 Protocol version 1. [ADDRESS_1039458] 
Clampi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (ECC), include one systematic review fiveRCTs (15-17, 27) andfive older controlled trials (13, 28- 31). These 
studies conclude that cord milking significantly improves blood pressure, hematocrit, and hemoglobin levels within the first 
few days of life and iron stores out to 6 months of age, with no 
associated harm. In late preterm infants, higher ferritin levels at 6 
weeks of age are reported after UCM (32). None of the studies 
demonstrated harm from UCM in these vulnerable infants , but also 
have not shown any clinical benefit . A recent study (PREMOD2) was 
stopped due to increased severe IVH in infants receiving UCM less than [ADDRESS_1039459] Milking .  
UCM provides a replacement preload before removing the placenta from the circulation, increasing pulmonary and cerebral 
circulation, and thus may mitigate further ischemia to an already compromised infant. Successful transition for non- vigorous 
infants may require active transfer of blood directed towards the pulmonary circuit by [CONTACT_68693]. (see Figure 1 ,courtesy S.
Lakshminrusimha) Increased pulmonary blood flow has been shown with recordings of electrocardiographic changes —
vigorous newborns that had UCM had a longer P wave, PR, and QTC interval when compared with those who had early 
cord clampi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (28). UCM may enhance alveolar patency compared to DCC or ECC by [CONTACT_68694][INVESTIGATOR_68625] (33). Our recently completed retrospective study of term/near -term newborns with acidemia at birth suggested 
decreased need for resuscitation, and ongoing respi[INVESTIGATOR_68626] (34). Whether a 
similar benefit will result from UCM in non- vigorous term/near -term infants is unknown. Based on currently available 
literature there is no foreseeable risk to the baby [CONTACT_759159].
Are OB Providers Using Cord Milking ?  
While UCM is not currently recommended by [CONTACT_68696]- vigorous 
newborns, (35, 36) many providers who are comfortable practicing DCC are milking the cord when DCC is not feasible in 
term and preterm infants.  Our retrospective study from two centers demonstrated that 30 percent of non- vigorous term/near 
term infants are receiving cord mi lking (34). A recently completed survey of [ADDRESS_1039460] milking despi[INVESTIGATOR_68627]. ACOG acknowledges "infants requiring resuscitation may benefit considerably from placental transfusion, but their need for immediate attention raises questions about whether 
they should undergo early cord clampi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (ECC ) or whether umbilical cord milking may offer unique benefits" (11). Before 
UCM in non -vigorous infants becomes widespread without any evidence, it is imperative that a clinical trial be 
performed to determine its potential benefit compared to ECC.   

MINVI                                                   Protocol version 1. [ADDRESS_1039461] more favorable outcomes than infants who do not receive a placental transfusion (37). One of the main differences between DCC and UCM is the source that drives placental blood 
to the infant. In healthy infants receiving DCC, the baby’s heart continues to be the driver as it was in utero until the umbilical arteries close. This is represented by [CONTACT_68697]. Uterine contractions also play a major role especiall y 
as the fibers contract and reduce the size of the cavity after the fetus is out of the uterus. Caldeyro- Barcia documented 
contractions of [ADDRESS_1039462] stage which would squeeze the placental blood out into the infant. When the infant 
is bradycardic and non- vigorous, blood may not be transferred as expected with DCC. In addition, many of these infants 
may require delivery by [CONTACT_68698] (C/S). During C/S when the uterus is cut open, pressure on the placenta may be 
diminished and the infant may not receive much placental transfusion even if delay were possible.  It has been demonstrated that DCC at C/S provides an inferior placental transfusion compared to UCM in preterm infants (38). 
Some studies suggest that opening the lungs with ventilation during delayed cord clampi[INVESTIGATOR_68628]  (39, 40) . The SMBHWN group has performed the only RCT to date of ventilation during delayed cord clampi[INVESTIGATOR_68629] C/S which did not show any benefit compared to DCC alone. In addition,  it validated previous 
findings that 30% of providers had difficulty placing the baby [CONTACT_68699]. The research team at SMBHWN also recently demonstrated the feasibility of resuscitation during DCC in term infants but due to these logistical issues excluded C/S  (41). However, this approach excluded 1/3 of infants that needed resuscitation. In both studies there was a 
reduction in the resuscitation team from 3- 4 to 1- 2 persons due to spatial constraints. Training of the obstetrical and neonatal 
teams was labor intensive requiring 24/[ADDRESS_1039463] refills quickly (about 
2 seconds) and can be milked again. After 3- [ADDRESS_1039464], an infant receives about 17 mL/kg (42). Our group 
has demonstrated that UCM provides a similar blood volume to a 2- minute delayed cord clampi[INVESTIGATOR_68630] (21).  Unlike DCC, milking at C/S provides increases in placental transfusion 
in term and preterm infants making it ideal in this population (15, 38) . While the concept of resuscitation with an intact cord 
is appealing, UCM may be a simpler, more efficient, pragmatic, and time- sensitive technique that is effective following C/S 
or vaginal birth. UCM requires little training and no additional personnel.  
 
 
The risk for long- term neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) in non -vigorous infants is high.  
MINVI                                                   Protocol version 1. [ADDRESS_1039465] asphyxia

half die or are disabled despi[INVESTIGATOR_68631] – therapeutic hypothermia.  If we show that UCM 
improves developmental outcomes, even slightly, this study may contribute to a change in delivery room practices. [CONTACT_68753] ’s completed 2- year neurodevelopmental follow -up trial (PREMOD) demonstrated improved language and cognitive 
scores with UCM compared to DCC in preterm infants  (43).   
 
Preliminary work that led to this proposal   
The interventions (UCM versus ECC) and population (non- vigrouous infants) were chosen carefully based on prior work by  
[INVESTIGATOR_124]. Katheria. In a trial of infants receiving iUCM compared to ECC, UCM infants had increased heart rate and peripheral 
arterial  oxygen saturation within the first 5  minutes of birth, suggesting improved breathing/aeration  (44). We also found 
that UCM increased serum hemoglobin at 12 hours, reduced the need for a blood transfusion, decreased the median 
duration of oxygen therapy from 17 to 2 days, and reduced the incidence of chronic lung disease from 41 percent to 14 percent  (19). [CONTACT_68754] and others also established that UCM is at least on par with DCC regarding clinical outcomes in 
both term (17) and preterm infants ).
 (45, 46) .  A second trial provided evidence for increased placental transfusion as 
demonstrated by a higher hemoglobin, blood pressure, urine output, and improved systemic blood flow as measured by [CONTACT_68700] C/S delivered infants <32 w eeks(47) .  Our completed 2- year 
neurodevelopmental on this cohort demonstrated improved language and cognitive scores which further supports the safety 
of UCM in preterm infants.
 (43). 
 
[CONTACT_68754] recently performed studies of UCM and DCC on term infants at risk for resuscitation. The trial was a pi[INVESTIGATOR_759154]  (34). 
While there were no differences in clinical outcomes, there was non- significant reduction in our proposed primary outcome 
for a reduction in NICU admission. Although not proven, UCM could demonstrate similar improvements. A recent 
retrospective study of term infants with fetal acidemia (the majority of which were delivered by [CONTACT_68701] C/S) who were all admitted to the Sharp NICU received either UCM or ECC. In this cohort, UCM  demonstrated a non- significant reduction in 
a number of our proposed secondary outcomes of the need for resuscitation, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413] . We propose our 
intervention will reduce the outcome of NICU admission  and have outlined our approach below.  
 Project Goals : The main goals of this trial are to determine if infants who are non- vigorous at birth and receive UCM before 
cord clampi[INVESTIGATOR_68633] a decreased incidence of admission to the NICU and improved short and long- term outcomes 
compared to infants who receive ECC.  
 
III. METHODOLOGY  
Trial Design  The planned cluster randomized crossover design has several innovations and benefits over a traditional 
individual patient randomized controlled trial. Using this design, we will randomize by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_68634] 1. [ADDRESS_1039466], and improves generalizability as the sample should be more representative of the actual population (22). We chose this design because a traditional RCT would add cost and 
would take 2- [ADDRESS_1039467] management practices may change.
  
 Cluster randomization offers several theoretical advantages over individual randomization (48, 49) . The treatments occur in 
a more realistic delivery room setting—reproducing the way deliveries would function if the intervention was found to be 
effective and then applied to practice. It allows for recruitment of every patient of interest as an automatic default proces s 
that will markedly increase efficiency. It simplifies the consent process, as all patients of interest in that unit w ill receive the 
intervention or control during each epoch and parents can ‘ opt-out’ of the system  if they wish.  It will decrease the cost of 
the trial because of the decreased burden of antenatal consent and screening. This is possible given that both cord 
management options are currently performed by [CONTACT_68702]. T he blocks will be standard of care for the year interval at the institution, and there is no more than minimal 
risk.  
  In conventional cluster -based trials, the major determinants of
 statistical power are the number of clusters (in this case the 
number of labor units) and the variation in outcome within  clusters (operationalized by [CONTACT_68703]- cluster correlation 
coefficient). Depending on the variations in outcomes at each site, the number of patients in each cluster could have far 
less impact on statistical power.  
We plan to reduce these challenges by [CONTACT_2329] a crossover of clusters. According to this approach, clusters are randomly 
allocated to receive Treatment A or Treatment B for a suitable period (12 months) and then swap to the other treatment  
(50). Thus, units randomly allocated to treatment A would then receive treatment B and those initially randomly allocated to 
treatment B would swap over to treatment A. This cluster randomized crossover control trial (CRXO)  design is significantly 
more powerful than the conventional parallel group cluster RCT, because comparisons are made within the cluster, thereby 
[CONTACT_68704] (e.g., how clusters vary in their changes in morbidity and mortality rates 
over time). When there is little such variation, the CRXO  design can be remarkably powerful and negate a large proportion 
of the loss of power due to the clustering in conventional parallel -cluster trials.  
Risk  
One important premise for CRXO is that the intervention and the control arm are of equal risk. We believe the current 
evidence supports the concept that UCM is as beneficial as DCC  when DCC is not feasible. There is no current evidence 
for any risk or benefit for UCM or ECC in non- vigorous infants . The pediatric and obstetric co- investigators and 
administrators at each institution where the study will be conducted support this premise. 
Timeline   
MINVI                                                   Protocol version 1. [ADDRESS_1039468] an approximate total of 15 00 depressed newborns (1- minute Apgar ≤3) at 
35-41+6 weeks GA in 2016.  Assuming a cluster crossover design will allow 90 percent of infants  to be enrolled. Initially it 
would require about 6 months for training and standardization of all sites. This CRXO  study has  recruited hospi[INVESTIGATOR_68635] 12 months to one arm of the trial with a cross -over period of up to 2 months for training and 
education, followed by [CONTACT_68705]. Once IRB approval has been obtained, sites will receive  
randomization by [CONTACT_68706] (UCSD A CTRI). They will immediately begin standardizing their cord 
management to the assigned intervention. As soon as the site PIs have achieved [ADDRESS_1039469] 1 
month (all non- vigorous infants received assigned  intervention) they will let the data center know they are ready to begin 
the trial. After [ADDRESS_1039470] management (the cross -over period). Enrollment will occur over approximately 2 6 months ([ADDRESS_1039471].  
We believe using this cluster randomized crossover design with each unit performing the same intervention for infants considered at risk, will result in either intervention (ECC or UCM) being  performed with minimal variation for the period of 
that intervention.  
 
Preparation of sites for the trial  
  
Each site will be randomized prior to study initiation using a computer -generated scheme prepared by [CONTACT_68707]. The 
lead Biostatistician will inform each site of its randomization status before they begin the trial for education on the intervention. They will also receive another crossover period before beginning the second epoch. Site and investigator 
standardization will be carried out by [CONTACT_68708] a variety of teaching methods and/or  video certification process.  
Each site PI (perinatal provider and neonatologist) will orient their colleagues, delivery room and operating room staff to the 
study and its protocols. The site PIs will train their providers and staff to ensure that the cord is milked in a consistent method (if in the cord milking epoch), and record time elapsed from delivery until the clampi[INVESTIGATOR_68636] (both UCM and ECC epoch). This may include review of approved videos, study laminates and protocol.  This will also include 
new staff at sites being trained in the protocol procedures. OB’s who have not been trained and are not aware of the protocol, will be excluded from enrolling. Site PI’s have agreed to make training new staff a priority to minimize any loss of subjects . 
Standardize UCM Procedure  
  
To ensure compliance and adherence of the different sites to the same study intervention(s), the following steps will be taken:  
• The detailed process of UCM will be explained and shown in a real time manikin simulated video clip distributed 
by [CONTACT_68709].  
• Each sites  Neonatal and OB PI [INVESTIGATOR_68637] (OBs, family physicians and midwifes) before the 
launch of the study. This will be accomplished by [CONTACT_68710], handouts and simulation workshops using manikins.

• Reinforcement of the procedure education will be carried out by [CONTACT_68711] 1- 2 months to 
ensure compliance of the OB practitioners to the same procedure.   
Each site PI (perinatal provider and neonatologist) will orient their colleagues, delivery room and operating room staff to t he 
study and its protocols. The site PIs will train their providers and staff to ensure that the cord is milked in a standard manner 
(if in the cord milking epoch), and record time elapsed from delivery until the clampi[INVESTIGATOR_68636] (b oth 
UCM and ECC epoch).  
Protocol for the Control and Intervention Procedures  
UCM : The delivering practitioner will place the newborn below the level of the incision (at the edge of the table) at C/S and 
a second team member will milk the cord four times. For vaginal delivery, the delivering obstetrician, midwife or perinatal provider will hold the infant against their body or place the infant on the mother’s abdomen and the cord will be milked either 
four times by [CONTACT_68712] a second team member. For the cord milking procedure, the obstetrical provider will milk the entire length of umbilical cord over two seconds, repeating three additional times as described previously. This 
time is not significantly different from the time for ECC as we have demonstrated in our previous trials.  
ECC : This will occur by [CONTACT_68713][INVESTIGATOR_68638]. Since both ECC and UCM will occur after a brief 
assessment, it is important to note that the cord clampi[INVESTIGATOR_68639]

 IV. SPECIFIC AIMS AND HYPOTHESES  
Specific Ai m 1 (PRIMARY OUTCOME)  Compare the incidence of admission to the NICU  in 35-4 1+6 week gestation 
non-vigorous newborns receiving UCM to those receiving E CC. 
H1: Compared to ECC subjects, UCM subjects will have a decreased incidence of NICU admission.    
Rationale . Given the knowledge gap, ECC continues to be recommended in non -vigorous newborns. We have shown that 
UCM is associated with immediate improvements in the delivery room and long -term benefits in preterm infants. There 
was a non -significant reduction in NICU admission in infants who received a placental transfusion with DCC  in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_68642]. [CONTACT_68754]’ s recently completed cohort study demonstrated up to 30 percent of non -vigorous 
newborns with fetal acidemia are already receiving UCM at birth. In these infants, there was a trend for a reduction in 
morbidities such as the need for resuscitation and ongoing respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413] . Therefore, we chose NICU admission as 
an outcome variable as infants with increased resuscitation and poor transition will be admitted for ongoing respi[INVESTIGATOR_68643]. It is also a meaningful outcome for providers to change practice.  
Standardized criteria for assessing the need for resuscitation: Per currently recommended guidelines for resuscitation, 
infants that are apneic with hypotonia, pallor or cyanosis should receive immediate resuscitation (and therefore would be 
ineligible for delayed cord clampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]).  
The collaborating per inatal providers in this trial will use their clinical judgment when determining if an infant is non- vigorous. 
Since both UCM and ECC are practiced at all of the participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], they have all agreed to perform one intervention 
on all qualified infants for one year and then crossover to the other arm for the subsequent year. They are comfortable and experienced with performing both procedures. Infants that are not vigorous will not be treated differently than if they were not the study.  
As part of this study, half of these infants will receive UCM and the other half will receive ECC.  
Pragmatic trial vs Protocol Deviations: It is important to note we designed this trial to be pragmatic and left to the judgment 
of the perinatal provider for the need for resuscitation, in order to ensure the trial is minimal risk.  
Expectations, Limitations & Alternatives   
We expect to find a lower incidence of NICU admission  in the UCM group. A limitation of these outcomes is based on an 
assumption that the multicenter trial would show a similar treatment effect as observed in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_68644] 
(ECC 25% versus UCM 16.25%) . The proposed large sample size will provide sufficient power to detect a clinically 
significant reduction in proportion of infants requiring admission to the NICU for multiple reasons such as poor transition, 
concern for neurological depression, and ongoing respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413]. A reduction in NICU admission  with UCM will justify 
the use of UCM in non- vigorous infants. There is a lack of knowledge regarding what effects UCM may have in the situation 
of significant fetal blood loss (i.e. unrecognized maternal abruption). Failure to reject the null hypothesis will cause us t o 
examine potential reasons the hypothesis was not rejected, thus allowing us to make evidential recommendations for UCM.  
     Potential confounders of non- vigorous infants such as general anesthesia, other non- reversible insults such as chronic 
hypoxia of placental insufficiency will be collected and analyzed for effects on our primary outcomes. We acknowledge 
some sites may  have infants admitted for other causes not related to the primary intervention (i.e., need for antibiotics). The 
crossover of each site should account for site differences. The proposed large sample size also allows us to control for such  
variables in determining treatment differences. Involvement of multiple hospi[INVESTIGATOR_68645], and affords the opportunity to examine potential heterogeneity across different sites and determine the extent to which the findings are generalizable.  
MINVI                                                   Protocol version 1. [ADDRESS_1039472] documentation of the specific intervention (UCM or ECC) not be included in the infant’s medical record. Since cord management is not routinely provided in the medical record we have specifically avoided any inclusion of the management to avoid downstream bias once the study has begun. In 
order to prevent admission bias in either of the prescribed epochs, we have outlined pre- specified criteria that will constitute 
a NICU admission for purposes of this study, see appendix 2. 
 
Specific Aim 2 (SECONDARY)  Compare the safety and efficacy profiles of non- vigorous newborns 35- 41+6 weeks GA 
delivered receiving UCM vs. ECC during their birth hospi[INVESTIGATOR_68646] 24 months corrected age.  
H2: Compared to ECC subjects ,  UCM subjects will have higher cerebral oxygen saturations at 10 minutes of life 
(sub -study at  three  (3) sites, n=20).  
Rationale:  C aregivers and researchers  raised theoretical  concerns that the UCM technique may deliver blood rapi[INVESTIGATOR_68647] 
a non- vigorous newborn predisposing them to higher rates of brain injury or dislodging cellular debris into the brain. 
However, of the [ADDRESS_1039473] reported adverse outcomes. All 
demonstrated improvements similar to DCC with increased red cell mass (measured by [CONTACT_68714]) improved 
blood pressure, increased pulmonary blood flow and improved ferritin at 6 weeks to 6 months of age with UCM. Nevertheless, careful assessment of safety is essential. Immediate physiological measurements on a subset (n=20) of infants of the t hree sub-study sites where the use of NIRS is standard of care, University of Alberta , SMBHWN and SGH  to 
establish the safety and efficacy of UCM. This aim will further test our hypotheses that infants in the UCM group will have improved early cardiac and cerebral hemodynamics within the first 10 minutes.  
     The Near -i
 nfrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a technology that allows non- invasive continuous real -time measurement of 
the regional tissue oxygen saturation (StO 2) of organs such as the brain.  There are well- established reference cerebral 
StO 2 values for uncomplicated term and preterm deliveries; however, there are no completed RCTs using NIRS in the 
delivery room. Our group is currently leading the first multicenter trial (1R01HD088646- 01A1) comparing DCC and UCM 
measuring NIRS at birth in premature infants. If cerebral oxygenation is improved, it will provide one plausible explanation 
for the long- term benefits expected with UCM. While published data exists on cerebral oxygenation directly comparing UCM 
with DCC, some studies demonstrated increases in cerebral oxygenation at [ADDRESS_1039474] clampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. To our knowledge, no studies using cerebral oxygenation in non- vigorous term/near -term infants have ever been performed. This sub- study (n=20) will yield the largest 
available sample of specific measurements of cerebral oximetry in non- vigorous term newborns.  
 
Substudy Sites  (
 only for sites that routinely record NIRS in the resuscitation room).  
Three sites experienced with NIRS ( University of Alberta ,SMBHWN  and SGH ) will obtain and report the physiological 
changes with UCM and ECC in the first [ADDRESS_1039475] 24/[ADDRESS_1039476] physiological and resuscitation data from birth 
(mean airway pressure, fractional oxygen) in addition to cerebral oxygenation. Once the newborn is delivered, receives the intervention (UCM or ECC), and is stabilized during resuscitation, a NIRS sensor (Fore- Sight, CAS Medical, Branford, CT) 
will be placed on the right forehead within [ADDRESS_1039477] 10 minutes in the  
delivery room at the three sites. Heart rate, oxygen saturations, and cerebral oxygenation will be downloaded as per  site’s 
practice for neonatal resuscitation.  If an enrolled infant has recovered and is stable enough for maternal bonding, NIRS may 
be discontinued prior to 10 minutes of life and will not be a protocol deviation.  
 
H3: UCM subjects will receive a greater placental transfusion as estimated by [CONTACT_68688] 48 hours of 
life and beter  blood pressure; UCM subjects will not have increased rates of hyperbilirubinemia compared to ECC 
subjects; UCM subjects will have decreased incidence and severity of HIE, decreased resuscitation interventions, 
decreased use of therapeutic hypothermia and use of volume expanders, and a shorter length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
Rationale:  These variables are chosen to assess the efficacy (hemoglobin) as well as safety (bilirubin) of both cord 
interventions. Data will be collected from the subject’s chart.  
H4: UCM subjects will have improved developmental scores on the Ages & Stages Questionnaire at [ADDRESS_1039478] ed. Questionnaire (ASQ -3).  The parent or 
care giver completes the questionnaire with assistance by [CONTACT_68715] -up team as needed. At [ADDRESS_1039479] for Autism in Toddlers  (M-CHAT -R), a screening tool for autism. Various 
methodologies to enhance retention are described below.  
   The ASQ -3 is a developmental screen used worldwide for children 2 to 60 months of age and covers five 
developmental subscales (communication, problem- solving, fine motor, gross motor, personal- social). It has been shown 
to have good internal consistency  and validity. Compared with the gold- standard Bayley Scales of Infant Development -II 
(BSID -II), sensitivity of the ASQ -3 is moderate (78%) for any delay and very high (92- 100%) for severe delay. Compared to 
more recently published BSID -III norms, the ASQ -3 questionnaire has excellent negative predictive value (NPV, 98%) with 
subscale specificities ranging from 92% to 96%.  
All parent questionnaires will be offered online via ASQ -[ADDRESS_1039480]

 access, a paper copy can be mailed. Survey results and feedback will be provided to the parents by [CONTACT_6591] -up team.  If 
a problem is identified, participants will be referred to their pediatrician or the site’s High- Risk Infant Follow Up clinic for 
further evaluation. All surveys are published in both English and Spanish, but will be translated into those languages most 
commonly spoken at each site. Non- English translations, and certification of translation, will be provided for IRB review and 
approval upon PI [INVESTIGATOR_68648] . 
The M- CHAT -R is a parent -report screening tool used to screen for autism. Its goal is to maximize sensitivity and 
thus to detect as many cases of ASD as possible. Is has a high false- positive rate meaning that not all children who score 
at risk will be dia gnosed with ASD. The 20- item questionnaire asks for yes or no answers. If the total score is 0- 2, the child 
is considered low -risk. If the score is 3 -7, the child is considered medium- risk while a score of 8- 20 indicates high risk.  
All infants that qualify for additional  neurodevelopmental assessments  (i.e. abnormal cord gases and/or receipt of 
therapeutic hypothermia) will also have their 2 year Bayley Scores collected when available. This subgroup will inform us as to whether UCM attenuates or improves long- term outcomes in infants with HIE.  
        
Expectations, Limitations & Alternatives of Neurodevelopmental Follow -u
 p 
Each site will include a designated neurodevelopmental follow -up team responsible for maintaining periodic contact [CONTACT_68716]’s family, facilitating completion of ASQ -[ADDRESS_1039481] by [CONTACT_3649], phone, e- mail and/or written communication (letter, greeting

Rationale:  U CM has demonstrated improved blood pressure, increased pulmonary blood flow cardiac function in preterm 
infants . However it is unclear whether there are hemodynamic changes in term infants , physiological cardiac measurements 
on a subset (n=200) of infants of the two sub- study sites (Sharp Mary Birch and Sharp Grossmont Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) , will be 
conducted to establish the safety and efficacy of UCM. This aim will further test our hypotheses that infants in the UCM 
group will have improved early hemodynamics.  
 T
wo sites experienced with echocardiography  will obtain and report the physiological changes with UCM and ECC at [ADDRESS_1039485] . 
Echocardiographic measurements will be performed on all infants at 12 hours +/ -[ADDRESS_1039486] operating 
procedure to assess systemic blood flow, by [CONTACT_68720] (SVC) flow (ml/kg/min), right ventricular output (ml/kg/min), and left ventricular output (LVO)  (ml/kg/min). These measurements will be performed off line at a later time. D ata will be 
entered into REDCap.  
If any structural abnormalities are found, the attending pediatrician will be notified of the abnormal echocardiogram. The consent will clearly state that this echo is not for diagnostic purposes. Any additional studies including an official complete echoc ardiogram and or cardiology consultation will be left to the discretion of the attending pediatrician, as he/she deems 
necessary.  
Maintaining Adherence to  A
 lgorithms and Minimizing Deviation from  Protocol  
 As this is a cluster randomized crossover trial where the standard of care for every non- vigorous infant will be the same 
over a year at each site  it is unlikely there will be a significant portion of newborns that will receive the wrong allocation 
based on the cluster. The inclusion/exclusion criteria were designed to be minimal and pragmatic for providers  to decide 
readily if the infant should receive the treatment arm.  The outcomes for infants with protocol violations will be measured 
and analyzed according to original allocation by [CONTACT_7586]- to-treat principles. Only newborns who meet pre- defined exclusion 
criteria (i.e. cord avulsion or congenital anomaly) will be excluded from the primary analyses, although we will verify that 
there is not a differential occurrence by [CONTACT_68721]. This strategy was successful in our previous trials.

and used solely for study specific training purposes. Videos will be kept secure per local intuitional policies. Site PIs will be 
considered ‘certified’ upon agreement of the lead site PI (AK). Training videos and materials will be disseminated to be used as a refresher for delivery room staff, fellows, and attending
 neonatologists.  Monthly teleconference meetings will be 
conducted to examine site comfort with, and performance of UCM techniques, as well as record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and other study 
or regulatory issues.  
 
V. STATISTICS  
Sample size and power calculation  We estimated that a sample size of [ADDRESS_1039489] 
efficacy of UMC versus ECC for the primary outcome. This was based on the following assumptions: a clinically meaningful 35% reduction in NICU admissions ( 16.25% for UCM versus 25% for ECC) , a two- sided type I error alpha = 0.05, 85% 
power, 0.02 rho (within cluster within period correlation), 0.02 eta (within cluster between period correlation), and a correction factor ( 4 x cluster size ) for the small number of clusters (51). 
 F
or the longer -term neurodevelopment outcome scores,  we estimated that a sample size of 1200 across ten sites , with an 
assumed two-sided type I error alpha = 0.05, 0.02 rho, 0.02 eta, a correction factor (4 x cluster size ) for the small number 
of clusters , and Cohen’s d = 0.25 , power  ranges from 79% to 87% when assuming a range in lost to follow -up from 20% to 
10%. The original sample size for this trial was 1000. However, at the first DSMB meeting in May 2019 only four sites had 
begun enrollment  and enrollment was nearing completion of the crossover point (nearly 2/[ADDRESS_1039490] arm) , and 
two sites were unable to obtain IRB approval. Therefore in conjunction with the DSMB , the decision was made to reassess 
the sample size calculation for ten sites .   
 
Feasibility B ased on the numbers of newborns at each of t en sites, we expect a total of approximately 15 00 newborns  
with a 1 -minute Apgar of ≤[ADDRESS_1039491] 50% will be classified as non- vigorous, a 2-
year period of recruitment would be required. The t en sites agree to recruit and each one has provided an estimated 
number 35-4 1+6 weeks infants delivered per year.  
 
Statistical Approaches for Testing Hypotheses   
All statistical analyses will be based upon the total cohort of patients randomized into the trial. Patients will be included in 
the treatment group to which they were randomly assigned. We will use the intent -to-treat analysis to determine treatment 
difference between the UCM and ECC  groups . 
Descriptive statistics (counts and proportions for categorical variables and means and standard deviations or medians and 
interquartile ranges for continuous outcomes) will be used to compare  baseline demographic, physiologic and clinical 
MINVI                                                   Protocol version 1. 9

26 
 outcomes between the two treatment groups. All statistical tests are two- sided with alpha = 0.05.  
Analysis of Primary Outcome (NICU Admission)  
The primary endpoint to be used for efficacy evaluation is the rate of NICU admission (by [CONTACT_68722]). The primary 
hypothesis to be tested is whether the UCM group’s results show a lower event rate compared to the ECC group. The 
primary analysis will estimate relative risks and 95% confidence intervals , accounting for the cluster randomized crossover  
study design, with fixed or random effects for  treatment group e ffect, period effect, cluster effect and cluster by  [CONTACT_68723]. The analysis will also account  for multiple gestations and clustering within a pregnancy if more than one 
neonate of a multi -gestation pregnancy meets eligibility. If the treatment groups are found to differ on a pre- treatment factor 
known to be a risk factor  for the outcome, the statistical analysis will adjust for these differences . An evaluation of treatment 
by [CONTACT_68724]. The percent of patients missing information to define the primary outcome is expected 
to near 0%.  Death is not an anticipated competing risk for the primary outcome as it is expected that all randomized 
newborns  requiring NICU admission will be admitted immediately. However, a sensitivity analysis will be conducted using 
a composite outcome of NICU admission  (by [CONTACT_68722])  or death.    
Subgroup analyses should be pre- specified and interpreted with care. Prior studies offer no basis for assuming a priori 
interactions between treatment groups, strata and subgroups defined by [CONTACT_4321], race/ethnicity, gestational age, site or a 
combination of these groups, beyond that already controlled for in the randomization. For th ese reasons , preplanned tests 
for interactions with treatment assignment are not warranted and are not powered for with the sample size. However, in 
accordance with NIH guidelines, an evaluation of consistency across racial/ethnic subgroups will be included.  
 
Analysis of Secondary Outcomes  
Secondary outcomes (use of therapeutic hypothermia, use of volume expanders, hemoglobin, bilirubin, death, and 
neurodevelopmental follow up scores) will be analyzed using similar multivariable procedures accounting for the study 
design as for  the primary outcome to test treatment effects. A nalys es will estimate relative risks and 95% confidence 
intervals  for binary outcomes and means or mean differences and 95%  confidence intervals  for continuous  outcomes.  
Secondary outcomes will be evaluated for missing data and those with and without missing data will be compared. Multiple 
imputation analysis will be conducted as warranted. Analyses will also evaluate death as a competing risk.  No adjustment 
for multiple comparisons of secondary outcomes is planned.  
 
Exploratory Analyses  
Several outcomes are identified as exploratory (level of HIE, blood pressure, length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], resuscitation interventions , and placental pathology). These analyses will focus on descriptive statistics rather than hypothesis testin g. 
Likewise any evaluations of subgroup differences by [CONTACT_1570] (other than race/ethnicity as mentioned previously) 
will be explored in secondary analyses for descriptive purposes and solely for purposes of generating hypotheses for future 
studies.

 Substudies for cerebral oxygenation and echocardiography will be reported as separate projects on clinical trials.gov and 
analyzed independently.  
VI. Recruitment  
Eligibility criteria  
The eligibility will be determined for each child at birth. Any vigorous or crying infant will receive usual care and will not be 
included in the study . All high -risk deliveries attended by [CONTACT_68725] b e screened. If the infant is determined to 
be non- vigorous and needs resuscitation, the baby [CONTACT_68726]. If the infant did not meet any exclusion criteria, the site’s designated research 
coordinator or their designee will approach parents following delivery and resuscitation to explain the remaining portion of 
the study (ongoing data collection, and periodic contact [CONTACT_68727], text, letter or email for developmental follow -up studies ).  
Each site will be responsible for maintaining their own master screening log. The purpose is for each screened patient to 
be as
signed a study number to track eligibility, informed consent and data collection. The log with the study numbers and 
site patient  identifiers will be kept in a secure, limited access area at each center. Only investigators and research personnel 
who are involved with the study will have access to the site specific log.  
 
Inclusion Criteria  
 As a pragmatic trial, all deliveries that do not meet exclusion criteria will be included. We acknowledge that anticipating 
resuscitation based on fetal (abnormal fetal heart rate tracing) or delivery (need for instrumentation or meconium) criteria do 
not accurately predict the need for resuscitation. The determination for eligibility will be determined for each child at birth  by 
[CONTACT_68728]. Any vigorous or crying infant will receive usual care (i.e., delayed cord clampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) and will not be 
included in the study . If the infant is non- vigorous as determined by [CONTACT_68729] . Non-viable infants or infants of unknown viability will not be included in the trial, only viable 
infants in distress. Infants born in extremis for whom no additional treatment will be offered by [CONTACT_68730]. The individuals making the assessment of the infant at birth (Obstetrical 
Residents, Obstetrician , Midwife  or other perinatal provider) are not co -investigators or key personnel so they will 
have no conflict of interest regarding enrollment.   Based on annual deliveries and the number of infants with a low Apgar 
score ≤3, we anticipate this will occur in about 3 percent of all term/near -term deliveries at each site.

This protocol will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of subjects, and will involve no more than minimal risk to 
subjects. This study meets the criteria of 45 CFR 46 Subpart D a) [ADDRESS_1039493] that any gender or race/ethnicity differences exist relative to the endpoints of this trial. Due to the design of thi s 
pragmatic crossover cluster -randomized trial, all infants born at any given institution who qualify by [CONTACT_68731]-
vigorous term/near term infants will be enrolled in the trial.  For this reason, there is no possibility of selecting out specific populations for inclusion or exclusion.  
VII. Ethical Considerations   
The MINVI  trial will be conducted in compliance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki in its latest form, the 
International Conference on Harmonization of Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. In case of modifications in the study protocol that are not merely of a formal nature but contain changes pertinent to the study participants, a renewed vote of 
the ethics committee will be obtained.  
We collaborated with parents by [CONTACT_68732]. We have incorporated their suggestions and they enthusiastically support the study and would like to provide ongoing community awareness both 
locally and abroad. All other institutions will present this protocol to their appropriate parent and patient committees for collaboration and community support, if applicable.  
The primary research team convened a meeting of all study sites and personnel on June 20, 2018. At this meeting all providers agreed to use their own clinical definition of non- vigorous but agreed to collect data on reasons which were 
unanimous (tone, color, and breathing).  
Parental consent/waiver  
Waiver of Consent  
This protocol will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of subjects, and will involve no more than minimal risk to 
subjects.  We will be comparing the outcomes of two current practice variations with a standardized protocol.  Based on the 
current literature to date there are no known risks with early cord clampi[INVESTIGATOR_68650]-vigorous infants. If the subject is non- vigorous they would receive the assigned standard of care for that year. All 
subsequent medical care would remain per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_68651]. The only diff erence would be the 
standardization of cord management for the year in non- vigorous infants.   If parents were to ask if anything would have 
been different if their baby [CONTACT_68733] s ubjects who are enrolled in the study  will 
receive the same cord management that they would have received if they were not enrolled. The study design requires 
each delivering hospi[INVESTIGATOR_68652]. However, this may have been a different 
MINVI                                                   Protocol version 1. [ADDRESS_1039494] ongoing and follow -up data. The majority of these deliveries are emergent/urgent so we are requesting a waiver of consent. 
This allows the provider and/or research staff to carefully  review the study intervention and data collect ion with the parents 
after the initia l anxiety of an urgent  delivery has decreased. We believe this is the correct approach for this trial
. Requiring 
antenatal consent would also adversely affect the generalizability of the data obtained.  Without the waiver of consent sites  
would require antenatal consent and this has been shown to limit the enrollment of the sickest infants in studies by [CONTACT_68734]/or emergent deliveries. This results in 
excluding some of the sickest infants that could potentially benefit the most from a trial intervention in which there are 
minimal risks . 
Parents will be notified about the study with the ability to opt out of the trial prior to delivery by [CONTACT_716]: 1) 
Expectant mothers will receive a brochure and discuss the study with the obstetrical provider at the prenatal visits. 
2) Brochures will be included in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_68653] 3) Posters and signs will be displayed at admission 
areas.  Every effort to notify all expectant families will be made prior to delivery. While routine practice will be to perform the 
assigned intervention for that year. A family that opts out can discuss with the clinical team whether they have a different 
preference for cord management other than the routine practice in the event resuscitation is needed. However, umbilical 
cord management is ultimately at the discretion of the practitioner based on the clinical situation. If families opt out of t he 
study, the research team will track them on the screening log and the electronic chart may be flagged to not approach the families for consent and ongoing data collection. Each site’s PI [INVESTIGATOR_68654].  
Waiver of HIPAA Authorization  
Partial waiver of HIPAA Authorization is requested for screening. The use or disclosure will not adversely affect the rights 
and welfare of the subjects.  This research protocol cannot be conducted without partial waiver because investigators would be unable to identify eligible subjects. This will involve no more than  minimal risk to the privacy of subjects. Only research 
investigators/assistants will access PHI for eligibility and screening purposes. The site specific screening log will include: names of subjects, date of birth, medical record number, eligibility based on cord management, admitted to NICU, date 
consented, reason not enrolled.  For all eligible infants, parents will be approached for informed consent and HIPAA 
authorization.  
 
A full waiver of individual HIPAA authorization is requested for instances when the research team is unavailable to obtain consent (i.e.  infant is born and dies or is discharged before study team could approach). This will allow us to collect minimal 
data that is coded to protect subject’s confidentiality
. This will support outcome data for the primary outcome. The minimal 
data collected under waiver will be collected from the existing medical records and will include: information from the delivery 
room record, admission to NICU, and information from the study s ource document (appendix 3).  We have an adequate plan 
to protect the identifiers from improper use and disclosure.   
 PHI that will be accessed for screening will be identifiable on research- related forms by a study number.  We will take the 
following precautions to maintain the confidentiality of identifiable subject information.  We will also keep subject’s ident ity 
MINVI                                                   Protocol version 1. [ADDRESS_1039495] the security and confidentiality of identifiable health information  
4. Whenever feasible, identifiers will be removed from study -related information  
5. PHI will not be disclosed or re- used for other purposes  
 
Follow -up Survey -    When parents are contact[CONTACT_68735]  (study publications) , they will be 
asked if they would be willing to participate in a survey. Since research staff has already contact [CONTACT_68736] t 
for developmental data, no new PHI is required. This brief survey is being done to determine their opi[INVESTIGATOR_68655]. A similar survey was used for a different study conducted by [CONTACT_68737].
  The survey will be sent to parents through  email or text with a RedCap link, and only the 
results will be available to the investigators and staff.   
VIII. Risks  
Loss of confidentiality: All data will be safeguarded in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act (HIPAA) and the principles and practices of strict confidentiality. Data will be maintained by  [CONTACT_68738] -based files will be available only to persons involved in the study through the use of 
access privileges and passwords. However there is still a potential risk of loss of data and privacy.  
Hemoglobin lab draw: will be performed by [CONTACT_68739].  As with all blood draws, possible risks include 
irritation of the vein, such as redness or swelling, pain, bruising or bleeding at the blood draw site, and there is a rare 
possibility of infection.  
Survey Completion: minimal known risks including loss of confidentiality .   
As with any study, there may be risks that currently are unforeseeable.  
Risk Management  
Protection against Risk  
Practitioners at all sites have experience with performing UCM and ECC within their normal clinical care. Only research 
team members (with appropriate research training relevant to protection of human subjects) shall have access to the 
project’s databases.

 Management of Risks  
Hemoglobin lab draw:  Will be performed by [CONTACT_68740].  
Proper techniques will be used at all times to minimize the chance of infection thereby [CONTACT_68741].   All efforts will be made to reduce infants discomfort (i.e. warming infants heel, providing 
oral glucose, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_68656]).  
Data Collection and Survey Completion  
 All data will be safeguarded in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the 
principles and practices of strict confidentiality. Every reasonable effort will be made to keep the subjects records confidential.   Subject’s records will be stored in a secure office. Codes, instead of names, will be used to identify the collected 
information.    
Reporting Process  
 The population being studied is at increased risk of all complications (such as hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy) associated 
with term and near -term infants who are deemed to require immediate resuscitation. The majority of these events will be 
expected and included in data collection and reported in all DSMB analyses. However, all SAE’s of death, 
polycythemia/jaundice requiring exchange transfusion, pulmonary hemorrhage and severe IVH (grade 3 or 4) on HUS or 
MRI will be reported within 3 days  of discovery of event, to UCSD DCoC via REDCap.  
Monitoring  
The DCoC will send out monthly reports detailing enrollment, SAE’s, protocol deviations and data queries.  Clinical 
Coordinating Center (SMBHWN) Data team will be monitoring sites as needed throughout the trial.  The purposes of 
monitoring visits, which will generally be done by [CONTACT_68742], are to:  
• Ensure the rights and safety of participants  
• Confirm that the study is conducted in accordance with GCP guidelines  
• Ensure maintenance of required documents   
• Verify adherence to the protocol  
• Monitor the quality of data collected  
• Ensure accurate reporting and documentation of all AEs and unanticipated problems  
Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  
An expert board consisting of perinatologists, neonatologists, outside statisticians and a former NICU parent will be closely  
reviewing all serious adverse out comes. This group has been established to: 1) protect all study patients, 2) safeguard the 
interests of all study patients, 3) monitor the overall conduct of the trial, 4) advise the investigators to protect the integrity  of 
the trial, and 5) supervise the conduct and analysis of all interim analyses.  The DSMB will review the first [ADDRESS_1039496] to the 
DSMB the threshold of an odds ratio of 2.5 as the threshold for a formal meeting to discuss potentially stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356]. However, the DSMB should discuss and determine the threshold. There is no plan to stop for efficacy as the trial design 
(cluster randomized cross -over) necessitates that both arms of the trial be completed at each site before efficacy can be

 adequately assessed. If the trial were stopped prematurely, we would perform planned analyses on the data collected at 
the time of the closing of the study. The findings will be communicated to all study staff by [CONTACT_68743]. According to the study’s Statistical Analysis Plan and due to the cross -over design of the study, there will be no 
planned formal interim analysis for efficacy or futility.  
 
IX. Data M
anagement  
Centralized Data Collection  
REDCap  (Research Electronic Data Capture). All case report forms for the trial will be captured using a secure web- based 
data capture system REDCap. REDCap under the direction of the UCSD A CTRI Biomedical Informatics  division offers and 
manages REDCap. The ACTRI Biomedical Informatics team will maintain and provide full  administration and support for 
REDCap. Data captured electronically in the delivery room will be uploaded to  REDCap for future analysis for all sites.  The 
REDCap application supports many data collection and analysis projects. Data collection projects rely on a thorough study -
specific data dictionary defined in an iterative self -documenting process by [CONTACT_68744]. The iterative development and testing process results in a well -planned data 
collection strategy for individual studies . The REDCap  system provides secure, web- based applications that are flexible 
enough to be used for a variety of types of research, provide an intuitive interface for users to enter data and have real time 
validation rules (with automated data type and range checks) at the time of entry.  The system has been deployed using a 
highly secure, HIPAA -compliant network design and is housed in a physically secure data center. Back up of data is 
performed nightly and archived off -site for two years for  Disaster Recovery purposes. Principal investigators may opt to 
archive the data for up to seven (7) years offsite to AWS Glacier.  
Data that will be accessed, used and collected will be identifiable on research- related forms by a study number.  We will 
take the following precautions to maintain the confidentiality of identifiable subject information.  We will also keep subjec t’s 
ident ity separate from their data on a Master log and coded.  
1. Paper -based records will be kept in a secure location and accessible only to persons involved in the study  
2. Computer -based files will be available only to persons involved in the study through the use of access privileges 
and passwords.  
3. Prior to accessing any PHI, personnel will be required to sign statements agreeing to protect the security and confidentiality of identifiable health information  
4. Whenever feasible, identifiers will be removed from study -related information  
 
Data Collection  
Under waiver of individual HIPAA, we will collect the following minimal data set from all eligible subjects  (parents that opt 
out will not be included) :   
Screening ID, Month/Year of birth, gestational age, SGA, time of cord clampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], Breathing or crying prior to cord clampi[INVESTIGATOR_007], birth assessment of tone, number of times cord milked, location of infant when milked (i.e. mothers abdomen, below level

not be accessed for study purposes.    
Infant data : Inc ludes all  data collected under waiver, plus Race/Ethnicity, Multiple gestation, length (cm), head 
circumference (cm),  Hemoglobin between 12- 48 hrs, Venous and/or arterial cord pH (if available), cardiac US, Peak total 
serum bilirubin (mg/dL)or Transcutaneous Bilirubin level, Polycythemia in the first week of life (Hct >65%), Duration of 
phototherapy days,  Use of cardiac inotropes (dopamine, dobutamine, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]), Early onset sepsis (positive blood or CSF culture at < 72 HOL), Duration of intubated and mechanical ventilation (days), Need for blood transfusion (DOL of 1st 
transfusion and total number), Length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (total days), ASQ3, MCHAT,  MRI white matter injury, HIE: mild, 
moderate, severe (initial screen completed at 1- 6 hours of life), HIE: mild, moderate, severe (highest stage before 
discharge) , Therapeutic Hypothermia, Placental pathology, PPHN.  
 
N
otification of Parents prior to enrollment: Both mother and baby [CONTACT_68745]. We are informing parents 
in three ways. First, all obstetric practices that refer babies to the study hospi[INVESTIGATOR_68658] , at prenatal childbirth education classes  and the obstetrician will discuss hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s participation in the study 
with their patients. Second, there will be signs (to be developed from handout) about the study at prenatal sites and physician offices. Both will have information for parents about contact [CONTACT_68746]. Finally, there will be 
information about the study  on the Sharp website with  answers to frequently asked questions.  High visibility posters of 
the study and information brochures will be posted in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_68659]. All documents created for parent notification will be submitted for IRB approval before use.  
Protocol Deviations  
The following deviations will be entered on the Deviation Report Form in REDCap as they are identified:  
• Cord clampi[INVESTIGATOR_007] ≥ [ADDRESS_1039497] clampi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
• Patient did not receive correct  treatment arm.  
Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
All SAE’s of death, polycythemia/jaundice requiring exchange transfusion , pulmonary hemorrhage or severe IVH (grade 3 
or 4) on HUS or MRI  will be reported within [ADDRESS_1039498] all SAE reports to the DSMB and PI.

 Unanticipated  E vent or  Problem s  
The investigator will be responsible for reporting an unanticipated adverse event  in REDCap, if it meets all of the criteria 
listed below:  
1. It is an unexpected event (nature, severity or frequency) and not ad dressed within the study protocol or informed 
consent document  
2. I t is related or possibly related to the research as determined by [CONTACT_978] – there is a reasonable possibility that the 
event may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]  
3. And suggests that the research places the subject or others at a greater risk of harm than was previously known or 
recognized (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm)  
If the unanticipated event is determined serious by [CONTACT_978], it must be reported to the DC oC within three (3) days in REDCap; 
within 14 days for a Non- serious unanticipated event . The DC oC will report this to the DSMB who will determine if the 
adverse event changes the known risk to study subjects. If the information changes the known risk to subjects, the DSMB’s report regarding the change in risk will be released to all participating investigators. T he DSMB may request changes to the 
DSMP.  
 
Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  
A DSMB has been established to:  
 1) Protect all study patients  
 2) Safeguard the interests of all study  patients  
 3) Monitor the overall conduct of the trial  
 4) Advise the investigators to protect the integrity of the trial, and  
 5) Supervise the conduct and analysis of all interim  analyses.  
The DSMB will receive regular reports from the trial on any injuries or adverse events, any  developments that jeopardize 
the continued success of the trial, and data by [CONTACT_68747]- determined early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]. 
All Serious Adverse Events ( SAEs ) will be reported within  3 days  of discovery to the Data Coordinating Center ( DCoC) and 
forwarded to the DSMB; reports of  adverse events and recruitment will be sent monthly; demographics will be included with 
the interim and final  safety and efficacy analyses. The DSMB will conduct interim analyses and project statisticians, 
independently  from the trial leadership and staff. The role of the trial investigators is to notify the IRB of any issues that are 
relative to patient safety or to early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_68660]. The study will be closely monitored for issues of data quality,  study 
conduct , and adverse events. These analyses will be presented to the DSMB.

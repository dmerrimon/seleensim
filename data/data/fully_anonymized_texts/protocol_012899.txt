Novan, Inc.    06 January 2016  
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   4 PROTOCOL AMENDMENT  
RATIONALE FOR AMENDMENT  
This protocol amendment is required to update the inclusion and exclusion criteria and the 
definition of subjects in the safe ty population. Eligible subjects are those age 9 and older.  Subjects 
with severe recalcitrant nodulocystic acne are excluded. The term “principal investigator (PI)” has 
been added to the list of abbreviations. The safety population will be comprised of al l randomized 
subjects that received at least one dose of study medication . Edits to the clinical and non -clinical 
background sections update results from completed studies. Analysis specific s have been moved 
to the statistical analysis plan (SAP). Minor edits have been made to the document to ensure 
consistency.  
 
IDENTIFICATION OF CHANGES  
 
Any changes to the original protocol are identified below and incorporated into this protocol 
amendment. All additions are identified using bold underlined  text. Any de letions are identified 
using strikethrough text. The Table of Contents and internal references are updated to reflect 
current section numbers.  Minor administrative changes were made as well to correct grammar, 
punctuation, etc.  
Change 1: SYNOPSIS: Key Incl usion Criteria  
Be male or female, 9 to 40 years of age  and older , inclusive and in good general health;  
Change 2: SYNOPSIS: Key Inclusion Criteria  
Have a minimum of 20 but no t more than 40 inflammatory lesions (papules , pustules , nodules, 
and cysts)  on the face;  
Change 3: SYNOPSIS: Key Exclusion Criteria  
Have any dermatological conditions on the face that could interfere with clinical evaluations 
such as severe recalcitrant nodulocystic acne,  acne conglobata, acne fulminans, acne 
secondary to medicat ions or other medical conditions, perioral dermatitis, clinically significant 
rosacea, or gram -negative folliculitis  
Change 4: SYNOPSIS: Primary Efficacy Analysis  
All three co -primary outcomes must show superiority over vehicle  (p-value≤0.05) in order for 
efficacy to be demonstrated; therefore no adjustments for multiplicity will be made.  
The analysis of treatment differences in the absolute change in non -inflammatory lesion counts 
will be conducted using a repeated measures analysis of covariance with fact ors for treatment, site, 
sex, age, visit and treatment by [CONTACT_23259]. The Baseline lesion count will be included as the 
covariate and subject nested within site will be the random repeated measure at each visit to adjust 
for the variability due to r epeated visits. Change from Baseline lesion counts at each visit will be 
the dependent variable. Only the estimate of treatment differences at Week 12/ET will be evaluated 
for efficacy.

Prior to analysis of co -primary outcomes, missing post -Baseline lesion counts and IGA scores 
results at each visit will be imputed using a Marko v chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)  multiple 
imputation methodology. Missing lesion counts and missing IGA scores will be assumed to be 
missing at random at each visit (MAR). Therefore a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) 
imputation method will be employed to impute a ll missing lesion counts and IGA scores for all

 Have any dermatological conditions on the face that could interfere with 
clinical evaluations such as severe recalcitrant nodulocystic acne, acne 
conglobat a, acne fulminans, acne secondary to medications or other 
medical conditions, perioral dermatitis, clinically significant rosacea, or 
gram -negative folliculitis;  
 Have any underlying disease(s) or some other dermatological condition 
of the face that require s the use of interfering topi[INVESTIGATOR_176234];  
 Have a history of experiencing significant burning or stinging when 
applying any facial treatment (e.g., make -up, soap, masks, washes, 
sunscreens, etc. ) to their face;  
 Have used medications or vitamins which are reported to exacerbate 
acne during the 12 weeks immediately preceding Baseline  (e.g., 
azathioprine, haloperidol, halogens such as iodides or bromides, 
lithium, anabolic steroids, systemic cortico steroids, phenytoin and 
phenobarbital). Daily use of a multi -vitamin is acceptable.  
 Have had a severe acne flare during the 12 weeks preceding Baseline . 
 Have any condition or situation which, in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], 
puts the subject at significant risk, could confound the study results, or 
may interfere significantly with the subject’s participation in the study.  
Sample Size  Approximately 1300  subjects will be randomized into the study in a 1:1 ratio 
(~650 in each  arm).  
Efficacy 
Evaluation  The sa me blinded evaluator should  perform Investigator Global Assessments 
(IGA) and lesion counting at Screening, Baseline , and Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12/ET. 
In the event that this is not possible due to unforeseen circumstances, a different 
blinded evaluator may evaluate the subject. However, the same evaluator 
should eva luate subjects at the Baseline  and Week 12/ET evaluations.  
 
Investigator Global Assessment (IGA)  
The IGA score will be determined based on the evaluation of the overall signs 
and symptoms of acne vulgaris. IGA evaluations will be performed prior to the 
lesions counts, approximately three  feet from the subject, and scored on a scale 
of 0 (clear) to 4 ( severe).  
 
Lesion Counts  
At Screening, Baseline , and Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12/ET, the evaluator  will count 
the total number of non -inflammatory and inflammatory lesions on the subject’s 
face including the forehead, right and left cheeks, chin and nose. Non -
inflammatory lesion count will include the number of open and closed 
comedones. Inflammatory lesion count will include the number of papules and 
Protocol NI -AC301, Amendment 1   Version 2.0 
Novan, Inc.    06 January 2016  
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   11 pustules. The number of nodules and cysts will be recorded separately and 
included with the inflammatory lesion cou nt.  
Tolerability  
Evaluation  Subjects will be assessed at each visit from Baseline through Week 12/ET for 
cutaneous tolerability. Tolerability will be assessed on a scale of 0 to 3 where 
0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe for erythema, scaling, dry ness, 
pruritus, and burning/stinging.  
Safety 
Evaluation  Adverse events will be assessed and collected at each evaluation beginning at 
Screening. A brief physical exam will be collected at Screening, Baseline and 
Week 12/ET. Blood pressure and pulse will be collected at Screening, Baseline 
and each visit through Week 12/ET. Any clinically significant changes noted 
during the physical exam or vital sign measurements will be recorded as adverse 
events. Urine pregnancy tests in women of child -bearing potentia l will be 
conducted at Screening, Baseline, and Weeks 4, 8 and 12/ET.  
Additional 
Evaluations  Photographs will be collected at Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12/ET 
at a subset of sites.  
Endpoints  Primary Efficacy Endpoints  
The co -primary efficacy en dpoints are:  
 The absolute change in inflammatory lesion count from Baseline  to 
Week 12 /ET; 
 The absolute change in non -inflammatory lesion count from Baseline  to 
Week 12 /ET; 
 The proportion of subjects with IGA success at Week 12/ET.  A subject 
will be considered a success if the IGA  score  is clear (0) or almost clear  
(1) and ≥2 grades  less than Baseline . 
 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints   
The secondary endpoints include the following:  
1. The percent change in inflammatory lesion count from B aseline to 
Week 12/ET;  
2. The percent change in non -inflammatory lesion count from Baseline to 
Week 12/ET;  
3. The median time to a 35% reduction in the inflammatory lesion count;  
4. The median time to a two (2) or more grade improvement in IGA.  
Statistical 
Methods  All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® unless otherwise 
stated. Statistical significance will be based on two -tailed tests of the null 
hypothesis resulting in p -values of ≤ 0.05 unless stated otherwise. Inferential 
testing will compare the active treatment group to the vehicle treatment group. 
Efficacy analyses will be performed using the intent -to-treat (ITT) and per -
protocol (PP) populations with the ITT population considered as primary. 
Safety analyses will be performed using the safety  (SAF)  population.  
 
Descriptive Statistics  
Descriptive statistics will be presented for the efficacy data at each evaluation  
visit. Continuous data will be summarized with sample size (N), mean, median, 
standard d eviation, minimum and maximum. Categorical data will be 
summarized with N, frequency counts, and percentages  of N . Descriptive 
Protocol NI -AC301, Amendment 1   Version 2.0 
Novan, Inc.    06 January 2016  
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   12 statistics will be presented  for the active treatment group and  vehicle treatment 
group. Summaries over both treatment groups will be presented for 
demographic and Baseline  characteristics.  
 
Efficacy Analysis  
Efficacy of SB204 4% will be based on statistical superiority over vehicle for 
change from Baseline in lesion counts and IGA score improvement at Week 
12/ET.  
 
Primary Efficacy Analysis  
There are three co -primary efficacy outcomes:  
 change in inflammatory lesions counts at Week 12/ET  
 change in non -inflammatory lesions counts at Week 12/ET and  
  IGA success at Week 12/ET which is defined as an  IGA score  of clear 
(0) or almost clear  (1) and ≥[ADDRESS_205736] show superiority over vehicle  
(p-value≤0.05) in order for efficacy to be demonstrated; therefore no 
adjustments for multiplicity will be made.  
 
Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
Secondary effic acy outcomes include t he percent change in inflammatory and 
non-inflammatory lesion counts at Week 12/ET, t he median time to 35% 
improvement in inflammatory lesions, and the median time to a two or more 
grade improvement in IGA.  
Analysis of the secondary efficacy outcomes will be adjusted for multiplicity 
using a hierarchical step -down procedure. These endpoints will be tested in the 
specified order with the rule that once a p -value exceeds 0.05, endpoints further 
down in the order are not statistically si gnificant.  
Tolerability Analyses  
Cutaneous tolerability assessments (erythema, scaling, dryness, pruritus, 
burning/stinging) will be summarized from Baseline  to Week 12 /ET. 
Additionally, change  from Baseline  in tolerability assessments will be 
summarized at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 /ET.  
Safety Analyses  
Adverse Events  
All A Es that occur during the study will be recorded and classified on the basis 
of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminolo gy. 
Treatment -emergent A Es (TEAEs) are defined as A Es with an onset on or after 
the date of the first study drug dose. Adverse events noted prior to the first study 
drug administration that worsen after Baseline  will also be reported as A Es and 
included in  the summaries.

1.3 NONCLINICAL STUDIES WITH NVN1000  
Novan has completed over 30 nonclinical  studies with NVN1000 to assess pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics (ADME), and toxicology.  In mini -pig and mouse studies, doses of SB204 far in

been a transien t dermal erythema that is concentration dependent and believed to be a consequence 
of a vascular dilation, “flushing” effect. Oral administration of NVN1000 drug substance in a SEG 
I reproductive toxicology study in rats showed no adverse effects on fertil ity and mating behavior. 
Oral administration of NVN1000 drug substance in SEG II reproductive toxicology studies in rats 
and rabbits showed minor effects on fetal development at the highest doses. Dermal application 
has been safe and resulted in minimal ex posure to nitrate or systemic silica when applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_176238] . In a 13 -week GLP dermal toxicology study with SB204 in mini -pi[INVESTIGATOR_176239] 48 -fold (mg/kg) and 14 -fold (mg/cm2) in excess of current maximum human  dose,  there 
was no increase in plasma nitrate concentrations, minimal systemic exposure (5 -22 ng/mL) to the 
parent compound as measured by [CONTACT_176264]3, and no s ignificant toxicologic findings  (Study 14 -NC-
001).  Cumulatively, these nonclinical data demonstrate that s ystemic absorption of NVN1000 
after dermal administration at supratherapeutic doses is minimal , with no major systemic organ 
toxicity.   
NVN1000 demonstrated mutagenicity in an Ames assay, but was not mutagenic in two in vivo 
genotoxicity tests in two tissu e types (bone marrow via  intraperitoneal ( IP) administration and skin 
via topi[INVESTIGATOR_78086] ) and in a  human lymphocyte  chromosome aberration assay .  
In nonclinical pharmacology studies conducted by [CONTACT_176265], NVN1000 or

 Bactericidal activity against P. acnes in vitro;  
 Anti-inflammatory activity in an allergic contac t dermatitis ear swelling model;  
 Inhibition of lipogenesis by i mmortalized sebaceous cells.

event ( SAE ) has been reported  in the acne development program.  The Adverse Event ( AE profile 
has been similar in subjects treated with active (SB204) or Vehicle  Gel. An asymptomatic, 
transient erythema has been observed in some subjects treated with SB204 . There have been no 
clinically significant changes in laboratory results including  methemoglobin, or in physical 
examinations.

discontinuations were observed following application of alcoholic NVN1000 Gel or Vehicle Gel

Additional details regarding completed clinic al studies are  in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.5 SUMMARY OF BENEFITS AND RISKS  
The pathogenesis of acne vulgaris includes several mechanisms which are potential targets for 
nitric oxide. Nitric oxide has been demonstrated in vitro  to decrease P. acnes,  inhib it several 
inflammatory pathways relevant in acne, and to decrease sebum production . In two completed 
Phase 2 stud ies, subjects with acne treated with SB204 had lower inflammatory and non -
inflammatory lesion counts with greater ‘success’ on the dichotomize d IGA score (‘clear/almost 
clear’ and at least a two grade change from Baseline) at the end of treatment  when compared to 
subjects treated with Vehicle Gel . Once daily dosing was as effective as twice daily dosing. In the 
studies conducted to date, the systemic AE profile was similar between subjects treated with 
SB204 and subjects treated with Vehicle Gel. SB204 4% has been  generally well tolerated and 
was not associated with a safety or tolerability signal.  
In the maximum use pharmacokinetic study, the re was no observed hMAP3 in plasma and no 
change in nitrate levels after topi[INVESTIGATOR_34608]204 8% twice daily to approximately 17% 
body surface area (BSA).  
A transient (approximately 5 -10 minutes), asymptomatic erythema has been observed in some 
subjects shortly after application of SB204 which is a physiologic response (vasodilation) to local 
nitric oxide release. In the most recently completed study, local application -site reactions were 
reported in approximately 5% of subjects treated with SB204.  These local application -site 
reactions resolved after discontinuation of the product and by [CONTACT_2054]. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_176242] -tolerated as assessed by [CONTACT_176266], peeling, pruritus, 
and burning/stinging. Tolerabili ty will be assessed during the planned study, and discontinuation 
criteria for intolerance by [CONTACT_176267] 6.7. 
Both  SB204 and Vehicle Gel contain alcohol; i nadvertent administration to the eyes may result in 
ocular irritation and should be avoided. Should the product be accidently instilled in the eye(s), 
prompt flushing with copi[INVESTIGATOR_176243].  
Based on the known mechanism of action of nitric oxide, theoretical risks from systemic exposure 
following topi[INVESTIGATOR_176244]1000 Gel or SB204 include hypotension and headache. 
The rate of headache has been comparable in subjects treated with NVN1000 or SB204 and 
Vehicle Gel.  Neither hypotension nor methemoglobin emia have been observed in nine completed 
studies  that have enrolled over 400 subjects treated with NVN1000 Gel or SB204.  
Based on available data, Novan anticipates that the risks to subjects enrolling in this Phase 3 study 
at which the maximum strength of SB204 will be 4% once  daily to approximately 3% body surface 
area are minimal, and that appropriate monitoring is in plac e to assess safety. Subjects randomized 
to treatment with SB204 4% once daily may have a clinical benefit from study participation .  
Protocol NI -AC301, Amendment [ADDRESS_205750] IVES  
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE  
Novan is conducting this study to evaluate the efficacy, cutaneous tolerability an d safety of SB204 
4% and Vehicle Gel administered once  daily to the face.  
Subjects will dose once  daily for up to 12 weeks (84 days) with SB204 4% or Vehicle Gel. 
Approximately 900 mg of gel (one pump stroke ) will be applied evenly over the face ( 3% BSA). 
Based on the previous human safety data with SB204 and Vehicle Gel as well as the nonclinical 
safety data, this dose is expected to be safe and well tolerated.  
2.2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy, tolerability and safety of SB204 4% 
and Vehicle Gel once  daily for 12 weeks in subjects with acne vulgaris.

4.1.6 Discontinuation/Withdrawal Procedures  
A subject may voluntarily withdraw from study participation at any time. If the subject withdraws 
consent and discontinues from the study, the Investigator will attempt to determine the reason for 
discontinuation and rec ord the reason in the subject’s study records and in the study database. If a 
subject is withdrawn because of an AE, that AE should be indicated as the reason for withdrawal. 
In the event of early discontinuation, (i.e., prior to Week 12/Day 84 visit) and whenever possible, 
the subject should be asked to return to the study center to complete the Week 12/ET evaluations. 
Subjects who withdraw from the study will not be replaced.  
Protocol NI -AC301, Amendment [ADDRESS_205766]’s participation if the subject has fa iled to follow study procedures or to keep follow -up 
appointments. Appropriate documentation in the subject’s study record and the study database 
regarding the reason for disc ontinuation must be completed.  
All subjects who fail to return to the study cent er for the Week 12/ET visit will be contact[CONTACT_176272](s) why the subject failed to return for the necessary visit or 
elected to discontinue from the study. If a subject is unreachable by [CONTACT_34675] a minimum of 
two documen ted attempts (one attempt on two different days), a certified letter will be sent 
requesting that the subject contact [CONTACT_737].  
Reasons for an Investigator’s withdrawal of a subject may include, but are not limited to, the 
following:  
 Safety (e.g., severe adverse reactions, pregnancy);  
 Lack of efficacy as determined by [CONTACT_737];  
 When the requirements of the protocol are not respected (e.g., significant issues with 
dosing compliance);  
 When a concomitant medication or treatment likely to inte rfere with the results of the study 
is reported, or required, by [CONTACT_423] (the Investigator will decide, in consultation with 
Chiltern whether the subject is to be withdrawn);  
 When a subject is lost to follow -up. The Investigator will try twice to reach the subject by 
[CONTACT_94598] a certified follow -up letter before considering that the subject is 
lost-to-follow -up. These actions will be reported on the subject’s study record and a copy 
of the follow -up letter maintained in the Investigat or's file.  
Refer to Section 6.[ADDRESS_205767]’s study record and in the study database. In no case will a subject who has been 
assigned a study number and randomized into the study be replaced by [CONTACT_176273] e 
randomization number or treatment assignment .  
All Week 12/ET evaluations should be performed at the time of premature discontinuation. All 
data gathered on the subject prior to termination will be made available to Chiltern .

Novan has the right to terminate or stop the study at any time. Should this be necessary, the 
Investigator will ensure that proper study discontinuation procedures are completed.  
4.2 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
The sam e blinded evaluator should  perform Investigator Global Assessments and lesion count s at 
Screening, Baseline  and Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 /ET. In the event that this is not possible due to 
unforeseen circumstances, a different blinded evaluator  may evaluate the  subject.  However, the 
same evaluator should  evaluate subjects at the Baseline  and Week 12 (or early termination) 
evaluations.  
4.2.1 Investigator Global Assessment  
The Investigator’s Global Assessment Score will be a static assessment that is independent of the 
Baseline  score. The evaluator  will make the assessment without referring to the Baseline  value and 
prior to performing lesion counts. The assessment should be made approximately three feet from 
the subject. The same evaluator  should  perform each study asse ssment for each study subject  
whenever possible , for consistency in evaluations.  
Subjects are eligible to participate in the study if they have a Baseline  IGA score of 3 (moderate)  
or 4 (severe).

etc.). Every attempt should be made to keep concomitant medication/therapy dosing constant 
during the study . Any change to concomitant medications/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_99067]’s stud y record and in the study database . When applicable, an AE should be completed for 
any subject starting a concomitant medication/therapy after enrollment into the study.  
6. EVALUATION OF ADVERS E EVENTS  
6.1 DEFINITIONS  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medica l occurrence (e.g., sign, symptom, disease, 
syndrome, intercurrent illness, clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding, injury or 
accident) whether or not considered drug related.  Any AE that emerges or worsens following 
administration of the infor med consent and until the end of study participation will be collected . 
A pre -existing condition is one that is present prior to the start of the study and is to be reported as 
part of the subject’s medical history. It should be reported as an AE only if t he frequency, intensity, 
or the character of the condition worsens during the study.  
Protocol NI -AC301, Amendment 1   Version 2.0 
Novan, Inc.    06 January 2016  
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   40 An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpect ed” if it is not listed in the 
Investigator ’s Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severit y that has been observed . 
A serious adverse event (SAE) includes any event , if in the view of either the I nvestigator or 
Medical Monitor results in any of the following outcomes:  
 Death  
 Life-threatening event (i.e., the subject was, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_176252], at immediate 
risk of death from the event as it occurred. It does not apply to an AE that hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe.)  
 Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE results in a substantial dis ruption 
of the subject’s ability to carry out normal life functions)  
 Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34908] (i.e., the AE required at least 
a 24-hour in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57891] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_176253]; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_86588]/surgical procedures, scheduled 
treatments, or routine check -ups are not SAEs by [CONTACT_44134])  
 Congenital anomaly/birth defect (i.e., an adverse outcome in a child or fetus of a subject 
exposed to the mol ecule or investigational product before conception or during pregnancy)  
 Does not meet any of the above serious criteria but may jeopardize the subject or may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above (i.e., 
is a s ignific ant or important medical event)  
6.1.1 Adverse Event Severity Grades  
The Investigator is responsible for evaluating all AEs and determin ing the severity of the event. 
Severity will be categorized according to the following definitions:  
 Mild:  Event may be noticeable to subject; does not influence daily activities; usually does 
not require intervention  
 Moderate: Event may be of sufficient severity to make subject uncomfortable; performance 
of daily activities may be influen ced; intervention may be needed  
 Severe:  Event may cause severe discomfort; usually interferes with daily activities; subject 
may not be able to continue in the study; treatment or other intervention usually needed . 
The Investigator will follow all subjects who experience AEs until there is  a return to the subject’s 
Baseline  condition or until a clinically satisfactory resolution is achieved or the subject is lost to 
follow -up. 
6.1.[ADDRESS_205778] will be assessed as follows:  
Protocol NI -AC301, Amendment 1   Version 2.0 
Novan, Inc.    06 January 2016  
Confidential and Proprietary, Novan, Inc.   41  Definite:  There is a clinically plausible time sequence between the onset of the AE and the 
application of investigational product; when the event responds to withdrawal of 
investigational product and recurs with re -administration of investigational produ ct. 
 Probable:  There is a clinically plausible time sequence between the onset of the AE and 
the application of investigational product; the AE is unlikely to be caused by [CONTACT_78654]/underlying illness, other drugs or procedures.  
 Possible:  There may o r may not be a clinically plausible time sequence between the onset 
of the AE and the application of investigational product and a cause cannot be ruled out.  
 Unlikely:  There is no reasonable temporal association between the test material and the 
suspected  event and the event could have been produced by [CONTACT_423]'s clinical state or 
other modes of therapy administered to the Subject.  
 Unrelated:  This term should be reserved for those events that cannot be even remotely 
related to study participation.  
6.[ADDRESS_205779] signs the 
informed consent/assent and completed one study assessment to the end of subject’s last visit.  
The Investigator will assess subjects at each scheduled study visit for the occurrence of AEs. In 
order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects should be asked the following non -leading question:  
“How have you felt since your last visit? ” All AEs (serious and non -serious) reported by [CONTACT_176277]’s study record and en tered into the study database.  
In addition, Chiltern must be notified within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event 
by [CONTACT_176278]. Special attention should be paid to recording hospi[INVESTIGATOR_176254].  
6.3 IMMEDIATELY REPORTAB LE EVENTS  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) are considered immediately reportable events . Any SA E, whether 
deemed drug -related or not, must be reported to Chiltern  by [CONTACT_756] , email , or fax as soon as 
possible after the I nvestigator or coordinator has become aware of its occurrence. The 
Investigator/coordinator must complete a Serious Adverse Event  (SAE) Form and fax/email it to 
Chiltern  within 24 hours of notification  of the event. When appropriate, Novan will notify the 
appropriate regulatory body of drug related Serious Adverse Events.

Chiltern  within [ADDRESS_205781]’s treatment and follow -up and document as 
appropriate.  
4. Provide a more detailed report to both Chiltern  and the IRB, if applicable, no l ater than 
seven days after the Investigator discovers the event as further information becomes 
available, and when necessary update the information with follow -up information 
including outcomes. This report should include a statement as to whether the even t was or 
was not related to the use of investigational product.  
5. The Investigator will notify the IRB of the SAE or pregnancy according to specific IRB 
requirements.  
6. The Investigator will collect information on SAEs until the subject’s health has returned t o 
Baseline  status, until all parameters have returned to normal, or remaining health issues 
have otherwise been explained.  
6.4 PREGNANCY  
Women of child -bearing potential (WOCBP) must use an effective method of birth control during 
the course of the study and for [ADDRESS_205782] three months, IUD, condom with 
spermicide, diaphragm with spermicide, implant, NuvaRing®, injection, transdermal patch o r 
abstinence with a documented second acceptable method of birth control should the subject 
become sexually active. Females taking hormonal contraceptives must have taken the same type 
for at least three months (90 days) prior to entering the study and mus t not change type during the 
study. Those who have used birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_176255] p rior to the start of the study.  
A female is considered to be of childbearing p otential unless she is post -menopausal (no menses 
for 24 consecutive months), surgically sterilized, or without a uterus and/or both ovaries.  
Before enrolling any subject in this clinical trial, the Investigator must review guidelines about 
study participa tion including the topi[INVESTIGATOR_34631]:

Prior to study enrollment, all subjects must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy 
during participation in this clinical study and the potential risk factors for an unintentional 
pregnancy. The subject must sign an informed consent document stati ng that the above -mentioned 
risk factors and the consequences were discussed.  
During the study, WOCBP should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_176279] (e.g., missed or late menstrual cycle). The Investigat or must 
immediately notify Chiltern  of any female subject who becomes pregnant any time during study 
participation, record the information on the Pregnancy Notification Form and email the form to 
Chiltern . Subjects found to be pregnant prior to Week [ADDRESS_205783] periodically during the pregnancy for 
ongoing health and safety information through term, as applicable. Protocol -required procedures 
for the Week 12/ET evaluation m ust be performed for the subject.

7.4 EFFICACY ANALYSIS  
Efficacy of SB204 4% will b e based on statistical superiority over vehicle for change from 
Baseline in lesion counts and improvement in IGA score at Week 12/ET.  
7.4.1 Primary Efficacy Analyses  
There are three co -primary efficacy outcomes:  
 change in inflammatory lesions counts at Week 12/ ET 
 change in non -inflammatory lesions counts at Week 12/ET and  
 IGA success at Week 12/ET which is defined as an  IGA score  of clear (0) or almost clear  
(1) and ≥[ADDRESS_205789] show superiority over vehicle (p-value  ≤0.05) in order for 
efficacy to be demonstrated; therefore no multiplicity adjustments will be made to the co -primary 
outcome analyses .. 
Prior to analysis of co -primary outcomes, missing post -Baseline lesion counts and IGA scores 
results at each v isit will be imputed using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) multiple 
imputation methodology. Separate multiple imputation (MI) procedures will be used for each 
outcome, using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) procedure MI. Details of PROC MI and 
options  used in the imputation procedures will be provided in a statistical analysis plan. ITT 
Protocol NI -AC301, Amendment [ADDRESS_205790] (LOCF) and Baseline 
observation carried forward (BOCF) on the ITT population.  
7.4.2 Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
Secondary effica cy outcomes include t he percent change in inflammatory and non -inflammatory 
lesion counts at Week 12/ET, t he median time to 35% improvement in inflammatory lesions and 
the time to a two or more grade improvement in the IGA.  
Analysis of the secondary efficacy outcomes will be adjusted for multiplicity using a hierarchical 
step-down procedure. These endpoints will be tested in the specified order with the rule that once 
a p-value exceeds 0.05, endpoints further down in the order are not statistically si gnificant. The 
order will be as follows:  
1) Percent change in inflammatory lesions at Week 12/ET  
2) Percent change in non -inflammatory lesions at Week 12/ET  
3) Median time to achieve 35% reduction in inflammatory lesions  
4) Median time to a two or more gra de improvement in the IGA.  
7.5 DRUG EXPOSURE AND CO MPLIANCE  
Drug exposure and compliance  will be performed on Safety Population.  The number  of days that 
study drug was taken and study drug compliance will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
Duration of exposure  will be defined as:  
(Date of Last Drug Administration – Date of First Drug Administration + 1 day) / 7 days, rounded 
down to an integer.  
The percent compliance for SB204 will be calculated as follows and presented as follows:  
% Compliance = (Number of Dos es Expected – Number of Doses Missed)/(Number of Doses 
Expected)*100  
 
Where the number of doses expected is the defined as the number of days from Baseline to the 
Week 12/ET visit.  Subject’s diaries will be reviewed at each visit to report the number of doses 
that were missed.

variable using descriptive statistics . 
7.6 TOLERABILITY  
Cutaneous tolerability assessments (erythema, scaling, dryness, pr uritus, burning/stinging) will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_176284] 12 /ET by [CONTACT_1570].   The proportion of subjects 
in each treatment group who shift scores from Baseline at each visit will also be summarized.  
7.7 SAFETY  
7.7.1 Adverse Events  
All AEs th at occur during the study will be recorded and classified on the basis of Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology. Treatment -emergent AEs 
(TEAEs) are defined as AEs with an onset on or after the date of the first study drug dose. 
Adverse events noted prior to the first study drug administration that worsen after Baseline  will 
also be reported as TEAEs and included in the summaries.  
All information pertaining to an AE noted during the study will be listed by [CONTACT_1130], detailing 
verba tim term given by [CONTACT_8509], pref erred term, SOC , onset date, resolution 
date, severity, seriousness, action taken, outcome, and drug relatedness. The event onset will also 
be shown relative (in number of days) to date of first dose.  
Treatment -emergent AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570], the number of subjects 
reporting a TEAE, SOC, preferred term, severity, relationship to study drug (causality), and 
seriousness. When summarizing AEs by [CONTACT_42564], each subject will  be counted 
only once , within a system organ class or a preferred term , by [CONTACT_176285].  
Serious AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570], severity, and relationship to stud y drug, 
and individual SAEs will be listed by [CONTACT_1130]. In addition, a list of subjects who prematurely 
discontinue from the study due to an AE will be provided.  
7.7.2 Physical Examination  
Any clinically  significant changes from Baseline  will be documented as an AE. 
7.7.3  Vital Signs  
Blood pressure and pulse will be summarized by [CONTACT_176286] 
12/ET. Additionally, change  from Baseline  in vital signs will be summarized at Week 2, 4, 8, 
and 12 /ET. Any clinically significant changes from Baseline  will be documented as an AE.  
Protocol NI -AC301, Amendment [ADDRESS_205791].   
7.8 SAMPLE SIZE AND POWE R CONSIDERATIONS  
Approximately 1300 subjects will be randomized into the study in a 1:1  ratio ( 650 in each arm) at 
approximately 50  sites in North America. In the previous phase 2 study, the pooled vehicle IGA 
‘success’ rate was 7.1% and the pooled SB204 IGA success rate was 13.4%. Using NQuery 
Advisor v7 (Statistical Solutions, Ltd) to esti mate sample size and statistical power, based on a 
vehicle IGA success rate of 7% and a 6% difference for the SB204 arm, a sample size of [ADDRESS_205792] 95% power for a two -sided test at the alpha=0.[ADDRESS_205793].  
The statistical power for detecting treatment differences in inflammatory or non -inflammatory 
lesions exceeds 99% once at least 256 subjects are treated in each group.  This is based on the 
following assumptions:  
 For inflammatory lesio ns: vehicle mean change = -7.6, SB204 mean change = -14.1, and a 
common standard deviation = 17.1  
 For non -inflammatory lesions: vehicle mean change = -5.8, SB204 mean change = -11.3, 
and common standard deviation = 11.[ADDRESS_205794]  
Upon receipt from Novan, or Novan’s designee, a study staff member will place all study supplies 
in a tem perature -controlled area. The pumps should be refrigerated (2 -8 °C)  until dispensed to a 
subject . Access to study supplies should be strictly limited to the study staff. Neither the 
Investigator nor any member of the study staff will distribute any of the study supplies to any 
person not participating in this study.  
If a study staff member becomes aware that the study supplies have not been properly handled 
(i.e., supply arrives and was not placed in refrigerator upon receipt), the Chiltern CRA must be

All aspects of the study will be monitored by [CONTACT_176291] (GCP) 
and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for compliance with applicable government 
regulations, (i.e., informed consent regul ations, (21 C.F.R. § 50.20, 1999), and Institutional 
Review Board regulations, (21 C.F.R. § 56.103, 1981)). Access to all records, both during the trial 
and after trial completion, should be made available to Chiltern at any time for review and audit 
to en sure the integrity of the data. The Investigator must notify Chiltern  immediately if the 
responsible IRB has been disqualified or if proceedings leading to disqualification have begun.   
The Investigator must conduct the protocol in accordance with applicable GCP regulations and 
guidelines, applicable informed consent regulations (21 C.F.R. § 50.20, 1999), and in compliance 
with the principles in the Declaration of Helsinki. Every attempt must be made to follow the 
protocol and to obtain and record all data requested for each subject at the specified times. If data 
is not recorded per protocol, the reason(s) must be clearly documented on the study records.  
Before study initiation, at a site  initiation visit or at a meeting with the Investigator(s), a Novan or 
Chiltern  representative will review the protocol and study records with the Investigator(s) and their 
staff. During the study, the study monitor will visit the site regularly to check t he completeness of 
subject records, the accuracy of entries into the study database, the adherence to the protocol and 
to GCP, the progress of enrollment, to ensure that consent is being sought and obtained in 
compliance with applicable regulations, and th at the investigational product is being stored, 
dispensed and accounted for according to specifications. The Investigator and key trial personnel 
must be available to assist the monitor during these visits.  
The Investigator must give the monitor access to relevant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_176256]. No information in these records about the identity 
of the subjects will leave the study center. Monitoring standards require full verification for the 
prese nce of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of 
SAEs and the recording of primary efficacy and safety variables. A reduced source data 
verification model will be deployed for this study in order to focus on the crit ical data for analysis 
and this will be executed per the study specific monitoring plan. Additional  checks of the 
consistency of the study records with the study database will be performed according to the study -
specific monitoring plan.  
The Investigator o r designee must promptly enter the data into the study database after the subject’s 
visit. The monitor is responsible for reviewing them and clarifying and resolving any data queries. 
A copy of the study records will be retained by [CONTACT_176292] t ensure that it is stored 
in a secure place with other study documents, such as the protocol, the Investigator’s Brochure and 
any protocol amendments.  
The Investigator must provide CRO  and the responsible IRB with a study summary shortly after 
study compl etion.

investigational produ ct, original, study -relevant medical records). All subject data will be treated 
confidentially.  
11. ETHICS AND RESPONSIB ILITY  
This study must be conducted in compliance with the protocol, the ICH Guidance for Industry E6 
Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Gu idance and the applicable regulatory requirements. The 
Investigator must submit all essential regulatory documentation, as required by [CONTACT_99114] (including approval of the protocol and informed consent/assent form by [CONTACT_2717]) to 
Chilter n before investigational product will be shipped to the study site. The Investigator will 
review the final study results to confirm that to the best of his knowledge, it accurately describes 
the co nduct and results of the study.  
12. CONFIDENTIALITY  
All informa tion generated in this study must be considered highly confidential and must not be 
disclosed to any persons not directly concerned with the study without written prior permission 
from Novan. Authorized regulatory officials, Chiltern,  and Novan personnel ( or their 
representatives) will be allowed full access to inspect and copy the records. All study 
investigational products, subject bodily fluids, and/or other materials collected shall be used solely 
in accordance with this protocol, unless otherwise agree d to in writing by [CONTACT_99083].  
Subjects will only be identified at a minimum by  [CONTACT_176293].  
13. AMENDMENT POLICY  
Only Novan may modify the protocol. Amendments may be approved by [CONTACT_176294], but not limited to, the government regulatory authorities and/or 
regional IRB before implementation. The only exception is when an Inv estigator considers that a 
subject may be harmed and immediate action is necessary. Under these circumstances, approval 
of the chairman of the IRB, or an authorized designee must be sought immediately. The 
Investigator should inform Chiltern  and the full I RB no later than five working days after the 
emergency occurs. Protocol -specified safety reporting requirements must be adhered to 
independent of any other variables. All amendments that have an impact on subject risk, the study 
objectives or that require revision of the informed consent document must be approved by [CONTACT_176295]. Administrative changes to the protocol and/or changes that do not impact

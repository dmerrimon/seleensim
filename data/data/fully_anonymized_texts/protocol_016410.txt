 1 Background  
1.1 Overv iew of Thromboxane  Biology 
Thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2) is a signal -activated 
eicosanoid generated from the metabolism of 
arachidonic acid (AA) via the actions of the 
cyclooxygenase (COX) and downstream 
thromboxane synthase (TXAS) enzymes.[ADDRESS_1241022] majority of TXA 2 is 
produced in platelets, where it not only mediates 
activation of the platelet in which it is formed, but is also released to locally amplify thrombotic 
stimuli by [CONTACT_886889].
5 Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] 
(ASA) exerts its antiplatelet effect by [CONTACT_886890] -1 enzyme for the life of the 
platelet, thereby [CONTACT_886891]
2 
generation and activation. In path ologic conditions such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), TXA 2 
generation increases substantially in non- platelet tissues such as endothelial cell (EC) and in 
inflammatory cells (Figure 1) . Unlike platelet- derived TXA 2, standard doses of ASA are 
ineffective at suppressing non- platelet- derived TXA 2 due to the short circulating half -life of ASA 
(t1/2 ~20 min), the ability of nucleated cells to regenerate COX -1 and formation of TXA 2 mediated 
by [CONTACT_384342] -2, which unlike COX -1 is not effectively inhibited by [CONTACT_41536] . 
 
TXA 2 is a short -lived molecule (t 1/2 ~30 sec) that undergoes aqueous nucleophilic attack to form 
thromboxane B 2 (TXB 2), an inert eicosanoid that circulates in the bloodstream. TXB 2 itself is 
extensively metabolized via enzyme- mediated β -oxidation and dehydroge nation to dozens of 
inactive end -order metabolites (TXB 2-M) that are concentrated in the urine (Figure 1).6 
Measurement  of one of these stable  urine  metabolites,  11-dehydroTXB 2 (11-dhTXB 2) was initially 
developed as a clinical indicator of ASA responsiveness based on data showing that  ASA 
suppressed urine 11- dhTXB 2 to <400 pg/mg creatinine in >90% of healthy adults.7 With the 
realization that non -platelet sources generate substantial amounts of TXA 2 in pathologic 
conditions, urine 11- dhTXB 2 is now considered a reflection of systemic non- renal TXA 2 
generation. (TXA 2 generated by [CONTACT_886892], thus urine TXB 2 is considered reflective of renal -specific TXA 2 generation.8) 
 
1.2 Thromboxane Receptor  Biology 
The biologic activity of TXA 2 is mediated through the binding to the thromboxane -prostanoid 
receptor  (TPr),  a G-protein coupled transmembrane protein present  on a diverse  array  of cell types, 
including EC, vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) and cardiac myocytes.9-[ADDRESS_1241023] 
that can form  heterodimers, TPα, which  is widely  distributed, and TPβ, which  is restricted  to limited 
cell types such as EC.13 High -affinity ligands for TPr are TXA 2 and PGH 2 (Kd 6.19- 16 nM), but 
isoprostanes such as 8 -isoPGF 2α that form non -enzymatically from arachidonic acid under 
conditions of oxidative stress, are also physiologically important ligands (K d 31.8 nM).14 Key 
cellular effects of TPr activation are shown in Table 1. In whole blood vessel preparations , TPr 
activation inhibits nitric oxide (NO) production and endothelial -dependent vasodilation.[ADDRESS_1241024]’s pro- coagulant, pro- inflammatory and 
vasoconstrictor effects counterbalance and in some 
cases directly antagonize the anti -coagulant, ant - 
inflammatory and vasodilating effects of prostacyclin 
(PGI 2) and NO. Table 1. Cellular effects of TPr 
activation.9, 11, [ADDRESS_1241025] 
ASA therapy is associated with an increased risk of 
atherothrombotic events and death.3, 27 -30 Sub- studies 
from the HOPE and CHARISMA trials found that in 
patients with/high risk for CVD on ASA, those with 
urine TXB 2-M in the highest quartile had a ~1.7- fold 
increased risk of death, myocardial infarction (M I) or 
stroke  compared  those  in the lowest  quartile.27, [ADDRESS_1241026] ASA  therapy.  
 
This concept was definitively demonstrated in the Reductions in Graft Occlusion Rates (RIGOR) 
study.3 Given  that ASA reduces  the rate of vein graft  (VG)  thrombosis  by 50% after coronary  artery 
by[CONTACT_9292] (CABG) surgery31, the RIGOR study hypothesized that failure of ASA to inhibit 
platelet activation would increase the prevalence of VG occlusion 6 months after CABG surgery. 
ASA responsiveness was assessed both by [CONTACT_113524] 11- dhTXB 2, which measures non- renal systemic 
TXA 2 generation, and by [CONTACT_242276] -induced platelet aggregation, which specifically assesses platelet 
TXA 2 generation. Similar to other studies32-35, the RIGOR study found that ASA suppressed 
platelet TXA 2 generation in 95% and 99% of subjects 3 days and 6 months after CABG surgery, 
respectively. However, urine 11- dhTXB 2 was also elevated in 70% and 33% of subjects at these 
same time points, often to high levels (Figure 2A). While no association was found between the failure  of ASA to suppress  platelet  TXA
2 generation  and VG thrombosis, 11-dhTXB 2 ≥450 pg/mg 
creatinine measured  6 months  after  surgery  was independently  associated  with VG occlusion (OR 
2.6, P<0.02; Figure 2B) compared to values <450 pg/mg creatinine.3 In an analysis of long -term 
outcome, 11- dhTXB 2 ≥450 pg/mg creatinine in 288 RIGOR subjects with suppressed platelet 
TXA 2 generation independently predicted 5- year MACE (adjusted HR 1.79, P=0.02) and death 
(adjusted  HR 2.90, P =0.01)  compared  to lower  values  (Figure  3).[ADDRESS_1241027]

potent risk factor for atherothrombosis and death. 
 
 
To determine if TXA 2 generation  predicts 
outcome  in a large unselected  population, 
TXB 2-M was recently measured 3042 
subjects participating in Exam 8 
Offspring and Exam 3 Omni cohorts of the Framingham Heart Study (FHS). The 
median urine TXB
2-M in the 
1361subjects on ASA and the 1681 
subjects not on ASA were 1145 and  4179 
pg/mg creatinine, respectively. 
Regardless of ASA use, urine TXB 2-M 
above the respective median values was 
associated with more than a two -fold risk 
of long -term mortality (Figure 4; Rade, 
unpublished data).  
 
These data indicate that systemic TXA 2 
generation is a potent risk factor for  
mortality, not only in patients with established CVD, but also in a general population and is independent of ASA use.  
 
1.4 Factors Associated with Non -platelet TXA2  Generation  
Multivariable mod elling of RIGOR subjects with documented ASA -mediated suppression of 
platelet TXA 2 generation identified independent risk factors for non- platelet TXA 2 generation 
(Table 2).[ADDRESS_1241029] (Figure

oxidative stress, 8- iso-PGF 2α is also a  
stable circulating eicosanoid capable of 
activating TPr to cause vasoconstriction 
and potentiate agonist -induced platelet 
activation.36 Other independent risk 
factors are shown in Table 2. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.5 Oxidative Stress Stimulates TXA 2 Generation in Endothelial Cells  
While the predominant eicosanoid produced in healthy EC is PGI 2, TXA 2, is induced in 
dysfunctional EC where it counteracts the vasodilator effects of PGI 2 and nitric oxide (NO), thus 
impairing endothelial- dependent vasodilatation.37, 38 Oxidative stress, a major mediator of EC 
dysfunction39, stimulates TXA 2 and isoprostane generation in human EC (Figure 6A)2. Similar to 
porcine cerebral and retinal microvessels 40, 41, macrovascular EC generates substantial amounts 
of TXA 2 when directly stimulated with 8 -iso-PGF 2α (Figure 6B), an effect that is inhibited by [CONTACT_886894] (Figure 6C). Furthermore, [ADDRESS_1241031] that EC under oxidative stress are a potentially major source of non- platelet TXA 2 
generation  and that autocrine/paracrine  stimulation  of the TP receptor  by [CONTACT_144640] 2 and/or  isoprostanes 
amplify this process. Furthermore, they identify TP receptor blockade as a promising strategy to not only bl ock the effects of TXA
2 but also inhibit its  generation.

Preliminary data reveal that TPr stimulation with isoprostane induces expression of multiple 
adhesion molecules in EC (Figure 7A; Rade unpublished data). TPr activation has been shown by 
[CONTACT_2312] t o potentiate cytokine -mediated TF expression in endothelial cells and monocytes19, 44 and 
TF is also directly  upregulated  by [CONTACT_753202] (Figure  7B; Rade  unpublished data).  Additional 
evidence indicates  that TPr inhibition  blunts  cytokine -mediated  TXA2  generation  (Figure  7C) and 
downregulation of thrombomodulin (TM), the key component of the protein C anticoagulant 
pathway that is critical for maintaining thromboresistance (Figure 7D; Rade unpublished  data).45-

atherothrombosis. 
 
1.7 Renal Effects of TXA 2 and TPr  Inhibition  
Prostaglandins  play an important  role in regulating  renal  blood flow  and kidney  function. The TPr 
is expressed in multiple places within the kidney (glomerulus, renal arterioles, thick ascending 
loop of Henle, collecting ducts and convoluted tubules) and renal TXA [ADDRESS_1241036] TPr 
inhibition  could potentially  improve  renal  function  in patients  with CVD and increase non-platelet 
TXA 2 generation, especially those with heart  failure.  
 
1.8 Summary of Mechanistic Hypothesis Tested in this Study  
Clinical and in vitro  experimental  data point  to oxidative  stress as a potent  stimulus  for endothelial 
TXA 2 generation. TXA 2 generation by [CONTACT_886896] a manifestation as 
well as a mediator of endothelial dysfunction. This provides the rationale for TPr antagonism as  a 
means of improving vascular fun ction. Figure 8 depi[INVESTIGATOR_27039] a mechanistic model encompassing these 
concepts. Key features of the model  include:  
• Oxidative stress stimulates TXA 2 generation and inhibits PGI 2 generation by; 1) enhancing  
COX- 1 activity and altering the relative activities of TXA S to prostacyclin synthase (PGIS), 
and; 2) non- enzymatic formation of  isoprostanes.  
• Autocrine/paracrine activation of  
the TPr by [CONTACT_144640] 2 and/or  
isoprostanes; 1) potentiates  
TXA 2 generation via a positive  
feedback loop; 2) induction of 
adhesion molecules and other inflammatory mediators, and; 3) impairs thromboresistance by [CONTACT_886897] -APC 
anticoagulant  pathway.

taking dual antiplatelet therapy alone.  
 
In a study of 17 subjects on stable warfarin therapy, the addition of 250 mg/d ifetroban for 7 days 
did not alter the INR (BMS Internal Repor t). The available clinical data has not demonstrated an 
increase in hemorrhagic events, though the number of subjects taking ifetroban and warfarin are limited (see Investigator’s Brochure for details). The interaction of ifetroban and novel oral anticoagu lants has not been studied.

6.5 Protection of Human  Subjects  
Protections for human subj ects of research are required under Department of Health and Human 
Services regulations in 21 CFR parts 50, 56, and 312. 
 
6.6 Summary of Risks and  Benefits  
6.6.1 Risks 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Drug -related  
Given its established safety profile, especially in patients with high -risk cardiovas cular 
disease, the risks associated with ifetroban administration are expected to be minimal (see above section 2 and Investigator’s Brochure). Given that both ifetroban and ASA inhibit 
TXA
2-mediate platelet activation, they have similar antiplatelet effects and bleeding risk.  
Protocol H00017901  Version 5, August [ADDRESS_1241053] in platelets is already maximally  suppressed.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Blood  draws  
The risks of drawing blood include bleeding at the puncture site, bruising and pain. These 
would be expected to occur in a very small portion of the population. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Vascular Studies  
The risks  of vascular  studies  include  discomfort  in the arm during prolonged blood pressure 
cuff inflation.

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25  
 9.4 Adverse  Events  
9.4.1 Definitions 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse  Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical  occurrence associated  with the use of a drug 
in a participant, whether or not considered drug or biologic related. An AE can therefore be 
any undesirable  sign,  symptom  or medical  condition occurring  after starting  study  drug,  even 
if the event  is not considered to be related  to the pharmaceutical  product. Study  drug includes 
the drug under evaluation, and any reference or placebo drug given during any phase of the trial. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Suspected Adverse  Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the event. “Reasonable possibility” suggests there is a causal 
relationship between the drug and the adverse event. “Suspected adverse reaction” implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, w hich means any adverse 
event caused by a drug.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Serious Adverse Events  (SAE)  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if the investigator or sponsor believes any of the following outcomes occurred:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening AE: Plac es the participant at immediate risk of death at the time of 
the event as it occurred. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused  death.  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life  functions. 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44344].  
• Results in congenital anomaly or birth  defect.  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_204216] y be considered a serious adverse event when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition  above. This determination  is based  on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_886877] (e.g., if either believes it is serious, it must be considered serious).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Laboratory Test Abnormalities 
For laboratory test abnormalities that meet the definition of an SAE, that required the participant to have the investigational product discontinued or interrupted or required the 
participant to receive specific corrective therapy, the clinical diagnosis rather than the laboratory term will be used by [CONTACT_9673] (e.g., anemia ve rsus low 
hemoglobin value).  
Protocol H00017901  Version 5, August 2022  
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 26  
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Causal Relationship  
A medically -qualified investigator must assess the relationship of any AE to the use of study 
drug, based on available information, using the following guidelines:  
• Not related: The re is not a reasonable causal relationship to the investigational 
product and the adverse  event. 
• Unlikely related: No temporal association or the cause of the event has been 
identified, or the drug or biologic cannot be  implicated.  
• Possibly related: There is reasonable evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and adverse event.  
• Related:  There is evidence to suggest  a causal  relationship, and the influence  of other 
factors is unlikely. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Adverse Event  Severity  
The determination  of adverse event severity rests on medical judgment of a medically - 
qualified Investigator. The severity of  AEs will be graded using the following definitions:  
• Mild: Awareness of sign, symptom, or event, but easily  tolerated.  
• Moderate: Discomfort enough t o cause interference with usual activity and may 
warrant  intervention. 
• Severe: Incapacitating with inability to do usual activities or significantly affects 
clinical status and warrants  intervention. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Expectedness  
The expectedness of an AE or SAR shall be determined according to the most current 
Investigator’s  Brochure. Any AE that is not identified  in nature,  severity,  or specificity  in the 
current investigator’s brochure is considered unexpected. Events that are mentioned in the 
Investigator's Brochure as  occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the 
pharmacological properties of the drug, but not specifically mentioned as occurring with the 
particular drug under investigation are considered  unexpected.  
 
9.4.2 Recording and Reporting of Adverse  Events  
The principal investigator, CEA and study team are responsible for monitoring the safety of participants enrolled into the trial. Events significant enough to necessitate discontinuation of study drug dosing will be captured on the AE electronic cas e report forms (eCRF).  
 
All AEs/SAEs, except for those anticipated AEs, occurring from signed informed consent to 14 (+/- 3 days)  after visit 3 will be captured  on the AE/SAE  eCRF.  Unless  exempted,  all SAEs, 
whether or not deemed drug- related or expected, must be reported by [CONTACT_886904] [ADDRESS_1241057] becoming aware of the event. For this study, all deaths will be reported on the SAE eCRF, as well as the Death eCRF page. The investigator or qualified designee will enter the required information regarding the AE/SAE into the appropriate module of the eCRF, which will be shared with the  CEA.  
Protocol H00017901  Version 5, August [ADDRESS_1241058] follow - 
up information according to the same process used for reporting the initial event as described 
above. The Investigator will follow all reportable events until resolution, stabilization or the 
event is otherwise explained. The investigators are also responsible for promptly reporting  
SAEs to the IRB per our institutional policy..  
 
9.4.3 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse  Reaction  
AEs that meet the criteria of serious, related to study drug, and unexpected per the Investigator’s Brochure, qualify for expedited reporting to the regulatory a uthorities. The PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_886878] a written  IND safety  report  of an SAR 
that is serious and is unexpected, based on the opi[INVESTIGATOR_886879], but not later than [ADDRESS_1241059]  deviation  was 0.31.55 In a meta- analysis  of >1500  subjects  with cardiovascular  disease 
the mean RHI was 1.52.56 Based on these data, a sample size of 48 total subjects (24 
randomized each to ifetroban  or placebo)  is required  to detect  a 20% increase in RHI with over 
85% power  with a two-sided  alpha  of =0.05. Adjusting  for 10% loss to follow  up, we will need 
52 randomized subjects.  
10.1.2 Secondary Endpoints  
Data from  a preliminary  study  conducted at UMass  (Keaney,  unpublished  data)  in which  FMD 
was measured in patients after non -STEMI ACS was used for primary endpoint power 
calculations. In that pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], mean FMD was 9.6 ± 2.0% in normal controls (n=16) and  4.6 
± 2.8%  in ACS  patients  (n=22). Based  on these data,  a sample  size of 48 total subjects  (24 each 
randomized to ifetroban or placebo) is required to detect a 50% increase in FMD with 80% 
power  for an analysis  of covariance  of each treatment separately  with a two-sided  alpha=0.05. 
Data from the RIGOR study was used to determine the power to detect a difference in non - 
platelet TXA 2 generation with drug treatment.3 With a median 11 -dhTXB 2 of 330 pg/mg 
creatinine,  a 33% reduction  would be to 220 pg/mg  creatinine (reduction  from  5.8 to 5.4 in the 
natural  log scale)  with a s.d. of 0.55 in the log scale.  A sample  size of 48 total subjects  (24 each 
randomized to ifetroban or placebo) will have the ability to detect treatment group differences 
describ ed above with 80% power for an analysis of covariance of each treatment separately 
with a two -sided alpha=0.05, assuming an R2 = 0.[ADDRESS_1241060] ANCOVA approach (SAS PROC 
GLM).  The full model  will be fit for change in RHI(or  other  measure of interest)  as the outcome 
for patient i based on treatment group (as two dummy (0,1) variables: x1, x2), a vector of patient 
characteristics  x3,I, and an error term ei: ln(11- dhTXB 2)i=b 0 + b1x1i + b2x2i + b3x3i +ei. We will test 
the main effects (treatment as well as patient characteristics) included in the model with the 
treatment main effects always included. We will investigate interactions between patient 
characteristics and treatments to provide insight into the effect of the se treatments on the 
outcomes overall and the effect in larger patient  subgroups.  
 
11 Data Management  
Study data will be recorded in a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database in the 
secure regulated environment at the UMass Medical School. REDCap is a secure, web -based 
application  designed  to support  data capture for research  studies,  providing  1) formatted  data entry 
screens; 2) audit trails; 3) automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to statistical 
packages; 4) procedures for importing data from external sources; and 5) an Application Programming  Interface that enables  it to communicate  with our web-based  randomization system. 
Data will be exported from REDCap into SAS (SAS Institute) for all analysis.

 15 Appendix B: Brachial Reactivity  
15.1 Introduction  
Healthy blood vessels dilate in response to an increase in blood flow, a phenomenon known as 
flow-mediated dilation (FMD).57 FMD is predominantly a function of endothelial nitric oxide 
(NO) release that relaxes underlying vascular smooth muscle cells. Endothelial release of PGI [ADDRESS_1241067] 
50 mm Hg above systolic pressure to occlude arterial inflow for 5 minutes. This  
causes ischemia and consequent dilation of downstream resistance vessels via autoregulatory 
mechanisms. Subsequent cuff deflation induces a brief high- flow state through the brachial 
artery (reactive hyperem ia) to accommodate the dilated resistance vessels. The resulting 
increase in shear stress causes the brachial artery to dilate. The ratio of the brachial arter y 
diameter after the occlusive period to that at baseline is recorded as the percent FMD. Impaired FMD is associated with cardiovascular risk factors and the development of clinical 
cardiovascular disease. The protocol that will be used is based on guideli nes published by [CONTACT_886914].

CONFIDENTIAL  Page 37  
 7. A segment with clear anterior and posterior intimal interfaces between the lumen 
and vessel wall is selected for continuous 2D grayscale imaging. During image 
acquisition, anatomic landmarks such as veins and fascial planes are noted to help 
maintain the same image of the artery throughout the study. A stereotactic probe - 
holding device can be  helpful.

16 Appendix C: Peripheral Arterial  Tonometry  
16.1 Introduction  
Assessment of digital vasodilator responses using a commercially -available fingertip  peripheral 
arterial tonometry (PAT) device (EndoPAT; Itamar Medical LTD, Caesarea, Israel) is a novel 
measure of vascular function that provides different but complimentary information compared 
with FMD.60With this device, a beat -to-beat plethysmographic record of the finger arterial 
pulse wave amplitude is captured using pneumatic probes placed on t he index finger of each 
hand (Figure 1). The same reactive hyperemia technique that is used to measure FMD is used 
for Endo- PAT and the two techniques can be performed simultaneously. The baseline digital 
pulse amplitude is a measure of local arterial tone  in the fingertip. The PAT ratio records post - 
ischemic arterial responsiveness to reactive hyperemia produced by a cuff occlusion in the 
forearm.

different digit (except the thumb) may be used, as long as the same finger is used on 
both hands.

7. Measure the blood pressure using the control arm (the arm that is not occluded during 
the Endo- PAT  study.  
8. Place a blood pressure cuff on the arm to be occluded du ring the Endo- PAT study. 
Apply the cuff snugly, but without excess pressure. Do not inflate the cuff at this  time 
16.2.2 Prepare the Endo -PAT System for  Study  
1. Launch the Endo- PAT 2000 software and click the "Patient Information" icon on the 
tool bar to create a new patient  file. 
2. Complete the Patient Information dialog box, including patient ID, name  (optional), 
age, gender, height, weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Optional fields allow for free text comments. Select your name [CONTACT_886918]- defined l ist in the 
Patographer name [CONTACT_78925]. If your name [CONTACT_886919].  
3. Select two new PAT probes and connect to the pneumo- electrical tubing. To  connect 
the probes, insert the connector tab into the probe slit and gently press the connector onto the probe until it clicks into place.  
4. Place the connected probes into the sockets of the arm -supports and press  the 
"Deflate" button on the top of the Endo- PAT [ADDRESS_1241075] the patient’s index fingers co mpletely into the probes, confirm with the patient 
that he or she can feel the very end of the probes, and press the "Inflate" button on the top of the Endo- PAT [ADDRESS_1241076] of the tubing that connects to the EndoPAT device is pointing out tubing to the tip of the  finger.  
4. Position the patient's arms so the forearms are supported on the arm supports and the fingers dangle freely off the edge of the support. Make sure the probes are not in contact [CONTACT_886915], including the arm support, foam ring, tubing, the mattress  or 
another  finger.  
Protocol H00017901  Version 5, August [ADDRESS_1241077] you will inflate the arm cuff, and during that time  they 
may feel some discomfort, numbness, or  tingling.  
6. Click the "Standby" icon on the Endo- PAT's computer interface. Adjust the time  base 
to [ADDRESS_1241078] the tracings of the PAT signals from the two probes to confirm that they are free of artifactual signals. If artifactual signals are present, veriify that the probes are not touching anything and that the patient is not moving the  fingers.  
7. To begin the study, click the "Go" icon on the computer interface. Start the stopwatch, by [CONTACT_17325] "Start/Stop Timer" icon. This will initiate a five minute count down for the baseline recording period. After five minutes, stop the  stopwatch 
by [CONTACT_17325] "Start/Stop Timer"  icon.  
8. Tell the patient that you are going to inflate the cuff for the occlusion phase and that 
he or she should stay relaxed and not move the  fingers.  
9. Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_886887] a supra -systolic pressure of 60mmHg  above 
the patient's systolic pressure or 200mmHg, whichever is higher and start the stopwatch again. Complete cessation of blood flow to the hand is verified by [CONTACT_12204] a PAT signal from the occluded arm. To confirm occlusion increase the gain on the screen of the channel of the occluded side to 20,[ADDRESS_1241079] the end of the occlusion period tell the patient you are going to release the cuff and that they should cont inue to refrain from moving their fingers. After exactly 
five minutes, deflate the cuff abruptly as quickly as possible and stop the stopwatch by [CONTACT_17325] "Start/Stop Timer"  icon.  
11. Click the "Start/Stop Timer" icon again to initiate a five -minute post occlusion 
recording period. Stop the timer after five minutes and click the "Test Stop" icon  to 
complete the study. The probes will automatically  deflate.  
12. Remove the probes, tape, and foam rings from the patient's fingers and disconnect  the 
PAT probes from the pneumo- electrical tubing. Discard the used  probes.  
 
16.2.4 Review and  Analysis 
1. Load the study file to the screen using the load icon. To run the automatic analysis, click the "magician stick" icon. The occlusion period will be highlighted in blue  and

2.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.1 Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)  
Renal cell carcinoma comprises more than 90% of kidney cancer cases and accounts for 
approximately 2 -4 % of all adult malignancies. In 2008, approximately 54,[ADDRESS_183239] e in the 
[LOCATION_002] were diagnosed with kidney cancer (renal cell cancer and transitional cell 
carcinoma of the renal pelvis) and approximately 13,000 died secondary to metastatic disease. 
Approximately 25 % of patients with RCC present with metastasis at the time of initial diagnosis 
and up to 20 -30 % of patients develop recurrent disease after nephrectomy. Surgical removal of 
the primary tumor is the only effective therapy in the non -metastatic setting. No adjuvant 
therapy has been shown yet to alter t he clinical course even in patients at high -risk for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_157734].  
Metastatic RCC (mRCC) is a heterogeneous disease with variable clinical outcome. Two randomized phase III trials have provided support for performing cytoreductive nephrect omy in 
mRCC, although the most optimal timing of this procedure has not been determined. Some patients with solitary metastasis, who are candidates for complete metastasectomies, can 
  
 Protocol 2011 -0358 
July 28 , 2017 
Page 3 
 
 achieve a long -term survival; however, once metastases develop in multipl e organs, systemic 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], until recently, have had little effect on the clinical cour se for  the majority of patients. 
Immunotherapy with interleukin -2, interferon -alfa , or a combination of these two cytokines, has 
been the main therapy in mRCC for two decades, but benefits only a small percentage of 
patients. In an effort to objectively compare different therapi[INVESTIGATOR_157735], prognostic models have been developed to assign patien ts to different 
risk categories  based on pretreatment clinical features. Cytokines (i nterleukin-2, interferon alfa)  
have recently been replaced by [CONTACT_157754] m-TOR pathways.  
2.2 Targeted Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_157736], known as the von Hippel -Lindau (VHL) gene, have shown that this abnormal gene 
produces a deviant protein which causes the accumulation of hypoxia inducible factors (HIF), which in turn induce the production of produc ts which are critical to the proliferation of clear -
cell RCC. Three of these products are vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet derived 
growth factor (PDGF), and transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF -α). All four of these cellular 
products, i .e., HIF, VEGF, PDGF and TGF- α, have constituted rational targets of novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Pazopanib is a multi -tyrosine kinase inhibitor that selectively inhibits protein tyrosine kinase 
receptors including VEGFR1 -3, PDGFRα/β, c-Kit, and Flt -3. Pazopanib demon strated substantial 
anti-tumor activity in a phase II trial in mRCC with randomized discontinuation design (Hutson et 
al, 2009 ). A randomized phase III trial comparing pazopanib to placebo, either as first -line 
therapy in treatment -naïve patients, or afte r failure of one cytokine in 435 patients with 
advanced clear -cell RCC showed significant prolongation of median PFS in favor of pazopanib 
(9.2 months vs. 4.2 months for all patients, p<0.0000001;11.1 months vs.2.8 months for 
treatment- naïve patients, p<0.0000001;7.4 months vs. 4.2 months for cytokine -pretreated 
patients).  
Temsirolimus is an inhibitor of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). Temsirolimus binds  
to an intracellular protein (FKBP -12), and the protein -drug complex inhibits the activity of  
mTOR that controls cell division. Inhibition of mTOR activity resulted in a G1 growth arrest in  
treated tumor cells. When mTOR was inhibited, its ability to phosphorylate p70S6k and S6  
ribosomal protein, which are downstream of mTOR in the PI3 kinase/AKT pathwa y was  
blocked. In in vitro studies using renal cell carcinoma cell lines, temsirolimus inhibited the  
activity of mTOR and resulted in reduced levels of the hypoxia -inducible factors HIF-1 and  
HIF-2 alpha, and the vascular endothelial growth factor.  The cli nical benefit of temsirolimus for 
poor -risk, advanced RCC patients was demonstrated in a Phase III study comparing 
temsirolimus, with interferon alpha (IFN -alpha), or combined temsirolimus plus IFN-alpha as 
first-line treatment of advanced RCC.  It showed that treatment with temsirolimus alone 
significantly increased median overall survival in poor -risk, advanced RCC patients (10.9 vs 7.3 vs 
  
 Protocol 2011 -0358 
July 28 , 2017 
Page 4 
 
 8.4 months). This was the first Phase III trial to demonstrate an overall improvement in survival 
using an agent as " targeted therapy" for patients with advanced RCC.  
 The targeted agents discussed above, although not curative, represent a significant progress in 
the management of mRCC. 
 
2.[ADDRESS_183240] few years, considerable progress has been made in the management of patients with 
metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). There are now six (five in the first -line setting) FDA-
approved treatments for metastatic RCC, however most patients experi ence disease progression 
within a year or less. The vast majority of metastatic RCC patients who were enrolled on phase [ADDRESS_183241] of care for the 
treatment of patients with advanced poor -risk RCC, based on results from a phase 3 trial 
comparing single-agent temsirolimus versus single-agent interferon alfa versus the combination 
of temsirolimus and interferon alfa. The response rate of temsirolimus in this study was 8.4 %, 
and the median PFS and median OS were 3.8 months and 10.9 months, respectively. There is no 
data on the efficacy of multityrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in this disease state. Therefore, it is 
important to investigate agents with the oral convenience and tolerability of TKIs, such as 
pazopanib, in advanced poor -risk RCC.    
3.0 BACKGROUND DRUG INFORMATION  
3.1 Pazopanib  
3.1.1 Description  
Pazopanib  is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Pazopanib is presented as the 
hydrochloride salt, with the chemical name 5 -[[4-[(2,3 -dimethyl -2H-indazol -6-
yl)methylamino]-2 -pyrimidinyl]amino]- 2-methylbenzenesulfonamide 
monohydrochloride. It has the molecular formul a C21H23N7O2S•HCl and a molecular 
weight of 473.99.  
Pazopanib hydrochloride is a white to slightly yellow solid. It is very slightly soluble at pH 
1 and practically insoluble above pH 4 in aqueous media.  
Tablets of pazopanib  are for oral administration  and is supplied in a 200 mg film -coated 
tablet. Each film -coated tablet contains pazopanib hydrochloride equivalent to 200 mg 
of pazopanib free base.   The inactive ingredients of pazopanib  are: Tablet Core: 
Magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, pov idone, sodium starch glycolate. 
Coating: Hypromellose, macrogol/polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400), polysorbate 80, 
titanium dioxide and may contain iron oxide black  , yellow, or red depending on tablet 
  
 Protocol 2011 -0358

Page 5 
 
 color . The 200 mg tablets of pazopanib  are modified ca psule-shaped, gray, film -coated 
with GS JT debossed on one side.  Pazopanib should be s tore d at 25°C (77°F); excursions 
permitted to 15° to 30°C (59° to 86°F) .  Pazopanib is being provided by [CONTACT_157755], [COMPANY_001].  
3.1.2 Preclinical Studies  
Pazopan ib is a potent, multi -targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of VEGFR -1, -2, -3, 
PDGFR-α and -β and c -kit, with half -maximal inhibition (IC50) values of 10, 30, 47, 71, 84 
and 74nM, respectively. It inhibits VEGF -induced VEGFR -2 phosphorylation in human 
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) as well as in mouse lungs in a dose -dependent 
manner. Data from preclinical studies show pazopanib has significant growth inhibition 
of a variety of human tumor xenografts in mice, and also inhibits basic fibroblast  growth 
factor - (bFGF -) and VEGF -induced angiogenesis in two mouse models of angiogenesis, 
viz., the Matrigel plug assay and the cornea micropocket model.  
3.1.3 Clinical Studies  
Glaxo SmithKline ([COMPANY_004]) initiated the clinical development of pazopanib in Dece mber 
2002. As of September 2008, a total of 38 clinical studies (including some initiated by 
[CONTACT_157756]) have been conducted or are in progress in 
adult subjects with cancer, including renal cell carcinoma, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, 
soft tissue sarcoma, cervical cancer, non -small cell lung cancer, multiple myeloma, 
glioma, colorectal cancer, and hepatocellular cancer.  
As of September 2008, approximately [ADDRESS_183242] common adverse events (AEs) reported to date include 
diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, hypertension, hair color changes (hair depi[INVESTIGATOR_371]), anorexia, vomiting, dysgeusia, headache, abdominal pain, rash, aspartate aminontransferase (AST) and alanine ami nontransferase (ALT) increases, constipation, 
cough, and arthralgia. Most of these events were Grade 1 or 2 using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 3.0 (NCI -CTCAE). The most frequent 
Grade [ADDRESS_183243] and ALT increases. 
Less common AEs of note include hand -foot syndrome, mucositis/stomatitis, 
proteinuria, venous thrombotic events, and bleeding. Intestinal perforations and arterial 
thromboses were uncommon. The most common serious a dverse events (SAEs) 
occurring in subjects enrolled in pazopanib studies as of September 2008, regardless of 
treatment assignment include diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting, dyspnea, 
hypertension (including one SAE of hypertensive crisis), pyrexia, anemia,  dehydration, 
fatigue, pneumonia, pleural effusion, neutropenia, pulmonary embolism, ALT increased, 
and nausea.

 3.1.4 Pharmacokinetics  
Absorption: Pazopanib is absorbed orally with median time to achieve peak 
concentrations of 2 to 4 hours after the dose. Daily dosing at 800 mg results in 
geometric mean AUC and Cmax of 1,037 hr microg/mL and 58.1 microg/mL (equivalent 
to 132 microM), respectively. There was no consistent increase in AUC or Cmax at 
pazopanib doses above 800 mg.  
Administration of a single paz opanib 400 mg crushed tablet increased AUC(0 -72) by 46% 
and Cmax by [CONTACT_3450] [ADDRESS_183244] 
1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal.  
Distr ibution: Binding of pazopanib to human plasma protein in vivo was greater than 
99% with no concentration dependence over the range of 10 to 100 mg/mL. In vitro 
studies suggest that pazopanib is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and breast cancer 
resista nt protein (BCRP).  
Metabolism: In vitro studies demonstrated that pazopanib is metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 
with a minor contribution from CYP1A2 and CYP2C8.  
Elimination: Pazopanib has a mean half -life of 30.9 hours after administration of the 
recommended dose of  800 mg. Elimination is primarily via feces with renal elimination 
accounting for <4% of the administered dose.  
Hepatic Impairment: Interim data from a dose escalation study assessed the influence of hepatic impairment on the safety and pharmacokinetics of  pazopanib in cancer patients 
with normal hepatic function and in patients with mild, moderate, and severe hepatic 
impairment. The starting doses were 800, 400, 200, and 100 mg once daily for patients 
with normal hepatic function and patients with mild, mo derate, and severe hepatic 
impairment, respectively.  
Pharmacokinetic data from patients with normal hepatic function (n = 12) and moderate 
(n = 7) hepatic impairment indicate that pazopanib clearance was decreased by 50% in 
those with moderate hepatic impa irment. The maximum tolerated pazopanib dose in 
  
 Protocol 2011 -0358 
July 28 , 2017 
Page 7 
 
 patients with moderate hepatic impairment is 200 mg once daily. There are no data on 
patients with mild or severe hepatic impairment.  
Drug Interactions: Coadministration of oral pazopanib with CYP3A4 inhibito rs has 
resulted in increased plasma pazopanib concentrations. Concurrent administration of a 
single dose of pazopanib eye drops with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and Pgp inhibitor, 
ketoconazole, in healthy volunteers resulted in 220% and 150% increase in me an AUC(0 -
t) and Cmax values, respectively.  
Administration of 1,500 mg lapatinib, a substrate and weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, Pgp, and BCRP, with 800 mg pazopanib resulted in an approximately 50% to 60% increase in 
mean pazopanib AUC(0 -24) and Cmax compared t o administration of [ADDRESS_183245] on the pharmacokinetics of caffeine 
(CYP1A2 probe substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 probe subs trate), or omeprazole (CYP2C19 
probe substrate) in cancer patients. Pazopanib resulted in an increase of approximately 
30% in the mean AUC and Cmax of midazolam (CYP3A4 probe substrate) and increases 
of 33% to 64% in the ratio of dextromethorphan to dextro rphan concentrations in the 
urine after oral administration of dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 probe substrate). Coadministration of pazopanib 800 mg once daily and paclitaxel 80 mg/m
2 (CYP3A4 and 
CYP2C8 substrate) once weekly resulted in a mean increase of 26% and 31% in paclitaxel 
AUC and Cmax, respectively.  
In vitro studies also showed that pazopanib inhibits UGT1A1 and OATP1B1 with IC50s of 
1.2 and 0.79 microM, respectively. Pazopanib may increase concentrations of drugs eliminated by [CONTACT_15924]1A1 and OATP1B1. 
CYP3A 4 Inhibitors: Coadministration of pazopanib with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., 
ketoconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin) may increase pazopanib concentrations. A dose 
reduction for pazopanib should be considered when it must be coadministered with 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Section [IP_ADDRESS]]. Grapefruit juice should be avoided as it 
inhibits CYP3A4 activity and may also increase plasma concentrations of pazopanib.  
CYP3A4 Inducers: CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin may decrease plasma pazopanib 
concentrations. Pazopanib should not be used if chronic use of strong CYP3A4 inducers 
cannot be avoided.

3.1.6  Clinical Safety:  
a. Hepatic Toxicity:  
In a controlled clinical study with pazopanib for the treatment of RCC, ALT >[ADDRESS_183247] 
was reported in 18% and 3% of the pazopanib and placebo groups, respectively. ALT 
>[ADDRESS_183248] was reported in 4% of patients who received pazopanib and in <1% of 
patients who received placebo. Concurrent elevation in ALT >[ADDRESS_183249] and bilirubin 
>[ADDRESS_183250] in the absence of significant alkaline phosphatase >[ADDRESS_183251] occurred in 
5/290 (2%) of patients on pazopanib and 2/145 (1%) on placebo. [See Dosage and 
Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1).]  
b. QT Interval Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes  
  
 Protocol 2011 -0358 
July 28 , 2017 
Page 10 
 
 Pazopanib should be u sed with caution in patients with a history of QT interval 
prolongation, patients who are taking antiarrhythmics, or patients with relevant 
pre-existing cardiac disease, bradycardia, or electrolyte disturbances. When using pazopanib, periodic monitoring wi th on -treatment electrocardiograms and 
electrolytes (magnesium, potassium) should be considered. Concomitant treatment 
with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, which may increase pazopanib plasma 
concentrations, should be used with caution and dose reduction of pazo panib 
should be considered.  
c. Hypertension 
Patients should be monitored for hypertension and treated as needed with standard 
anti-hypertensive therapy. In cases of severe hypertension, temporary suspension 
of pazopanib is recommended until hypertension is  controlled.  
d. Hemorrhagic events  
Tumor -related hemorrhage has been observed in patients treated with pazopanib. 
These events may occur suddenly, and in the case of pulmonary tumors may present as severe and life -threatening hemoptysis or pulmonary hemorr hage.  
Serious, sometimes fatal gastrointestinal complications including gastrointestinal 
perforation have occurred rarely in patients with intra -abdominal malignancies 
treated with pazopanib.  
e. Hypothyroidism  
Baseline laboratory measurement of thyroid fun ction is recommended and patients 
with hypothyroidism should be treated as per standard medical practice prior to the 
start of pazopanib treatment. All patients should be observed closely for signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism on pazopanib treatment. Pat ients with signs or 
symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism should have laboratory monitoring of thyroid function performed and be treated as per standard medical practice.  
f. QT Prolonging Medications  
Certain medications that are associated with a risk for QTc prolongation, although not prohibited, should be avoided or replaced with medications that do not carry 
these risks, if possible.   
 
QT
c prolongation is a rare but serious adverse event associated with 
pazopanib.   Caution should be exercised when admini stering pazopanib to subjects 
with a history of QT c interval prolongation, in subjects taking anti -arrhythmics or 
  
 Protocol 2011 -0358 
July 28 , 2017

 other medications that may prolong the QT c interval, and those with relevant pre -
existing cardia c disease (i.e.  amiodarone, clarithromycin, di sopyramide, haloperidol, 
methadone, procainamide; some SSRIs such as citalopram, fluoxetine, venlafexine; 
and fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin) . See 
Appendix F for a more comprehensive list of drugs that may prolong Qt  interval.

 After the t emsirolimus  injection vial has been diluted with supplied diluent , in 
accordance with the instructions below, the solution contains 35.2%  alcohol.  
Temsirolimus  injection and supplied diluent  are filled in clear glass vials  with butyl 
rubber stoppers.  Each kit is supplied in a single carton containing one single -use vial of 
25 mg/mL of  temsirolimus and one diluent  vial which includes a deliverable volume of 
1.[ADDRESS_183252]  be stored at 2° -8°C (3 6° 46°F). Protect from light.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Preparation and Administration  
Temsirolimus  must be stored under refrigeration at 2° -8°C (36° -46°F) and 
protected from light.  During handling  and preparation of admixtures, 
temsirolimus  should be protected from excessive  room light and sunlight. 
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and 
discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.  
In order to minimize the patient exposure to the plasticizer DEHP (di -2-
ethylhexyl phthalate),  which may be leached from PVC infusion bags or sets, the 
final temsirolimus  dilution for infusion  should be stored in bottles (glass, 
polypropylene) or plastic bags (polypropylene, polyolefin)  and administered 
through poly ethylene-lined administration sets.  
Dilution: In preparing the temsirolimus  administration solution, follow this two -
step dilution process in an  aseptic manner. 
Step 1: Inject 1.8 mL of supplied diluent  into the vial of temsirolimus 
injection(25 mg/ml). Th e temsirolimus  vial contains an overfill of 0.2 mL (30 
mg/1.2 mL).  
Due to the intentional overfill in the temsirolimus  injection vial, the drug 
concentration of the  resulting solution will be 10 mg/mL. A total volume of 3 mL 
will be obtained including the  overfill. Mix well by [CONTACT_157758]. Allow 
sufficient time for air bubbles to subside. This  10 mg/mL drug solution/diluent 
mixture must be further diluted as described in Step 2 below.  
The solution is clear to slightly turbid, colorless to yellow, and free from visual 
particulates.  The 10 mg/mL drug solution/diluent mixture is stable for up to 24 
hours at controlled room  temperature.  
Step 2: Withdraw the required amount of temsirolimus from the 10 mg/mL drug 
solution/ diluents mixture prepared in Step 1. Inject rapi[INVESTIGATOR_157739] a 250 mL 
container (glass, polyolefin, or  polyethylene) of 0.9% sodium chloride injection. 
  
 Protocol 2011 -0358 
July 28 , 2017 
Page 13 
 
 Mix the admixture by [CONTACT_157759]. Avoid excessive shaking as 
this may cause foaming.  
Administration:  The sodium chloride injection container should be composed of 
non-DEHP containing  materials, such as glass, polyolefin or polyethylene, and 
the administration set should  consist of non -DEHP tubing to avoid extraction of 
di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). 
Temsirolimus  contain s polysorbate 80, which is known to increase the rate of di -
(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) extraction from PVC.  An in line 
polyethersulfone filter with a pore size of not greater than 5 microns is 
recommended  for administration.  
The final diluted solutio n of temsirolimus  is intravenously infused over a 30 -60 
minute period once a week. The use of an infusion pump is the preferred 
method of  administration to ensure accurate delivery of the drug.  
Administration of the final diluted infusion solution should b e completed within 
six hours from the time that the drug solution/diluent mixture is added to the 
sodium chloride injection.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Compatibilities and Incompatibilities  
Undiluted temsirolimus  injection should not be added directly to aqueous 
infusion solutions.  Direct addition of temsirolimus  injection to aqueous 
solutions will result in precipi[INVESTIGATOR_157740].  Always combine temsirolimus  
injection with supplied diluent  before adding to infusi on solutions. It is 
recommended that temsirolimus  be administered in 0.9% sodium chloride 
injection  after combining with supplied diluent. The stability of temsirolimus  in 
other infusion solutions has not been  evaluated. Addition of other drugs or 
nutritio nal agents to admixtures of temsirolimus  in sodium  chloride injection 
has not been evaluated and should be avoided. Temsirolimus is degraded by 
[CONTACT_157760], and thus combinations of temsirolimus with agents 
capable of modifying solution pH should be avoided.  
3.2.2  Preclinical Studies  
Temsirolimus is an inhibitor of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). Temsirolimus 
binds  to an intracellular protein (FKBP -12), and the protein-drug complex inhibits the 
activity of  mTOR that controls cell division. Inhibition of mTOR activity resulted in a G1 
growth arrest in  treated tumor cells. When mTOR was inhibited, its ability to 
phosphorylate p70S6k and S6  ribosomal protein, which are downstream of mTOR in the 
PI3 kinase/AKT pathway was  blocked. In in vitro st udies using renal cell carcinoma cell 
  
 Protocol [ADDRESS_183253] and prostate 
cancer.  
 
3.2.3  Clinical Studies  
A phase 3, multi -center, three -arm, randomized, open -label study was conducted in 
previously  untreated patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (clear cell and non-
clear cell histologies).   The objectives were to compare Overall Survival (OS), 
Progression -Free Survival (PFS),  Objective Response Rate (ORR), and safety in patients 
receiving IFN -α to those receiving  temsirolimus and temsirolimus plus IFN-α. Patients in 
this study had 3 or more of 6 pre -selected prognostic risk factors (less than one year 
from time of initial RCC diagnosis to randomization,  Karnofsky performance statu s of 60 
or 70, hemoglobin less than the lower limit of normal,  corrected calcium of greater than 
10 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase > 1.5 times the upper limit  of normal, more than one 
metastatic organ site). Patients were stratified for prior nephrectomy  status within 
three geographic regions and were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive IFN -α alone 
(n=207), temsirolimus alone (25 mg weekly; n=209), or the combination arm (n=210).  
The ITT population for this interim analysis included [ADDRESS_183254] to age, gender, and race. 
The mean  age of all groups was 59 years (range 23-86). Sixty -nine percent were male 
and 31% were  female. The racial distribution for all groups was 91% White, 4% Black , 2% 
Asian, and 3%  other. Sixty -seven percent of patients had a history of prior nephrectomy.  
The median duration of treatment in the temsirolimus arm was 17 weeks (range 1-126 
weeks).  The median duration of treatment on the IFN arm was 8 weeks (range 1 -124 
weeks).  
There was a statistically significant improvement in OS (time from randomization to 
death) in  the temsirolimus 25 mg arm compared to IFN-α. The combination of 
temsirolimus 15 mg and IFN-α  did not result in a significant increase in overall surviv al 
when compared with IFN- α alone.  
3.2.4  Pharmacokinetics  
Absorption : Following administration of a single 25 mg dose of temsirolimus  in patients 
with cancer, mean  temsirolimus Cmax in whole blood was 585 ng/mL (coefficient of 
variation, CV =14%), and  mea n AUC in blood was 1627 ng•h/mL (CV=26%). Typi[INVESTIGATOR_157741]. Over the dose range of 1 mg to 25 mg, 
temsirolimus exposure increased in a less than dose proportional manner while 
  
 Protocol 2011 -0358 
July 28 , 2017 
Page 15 
 
 sirolimus exposure increased proportionally with dose.   Following a single 25 mg 
intravenous dose in patients with cancer, sirolimus AUC was 2.7 -fold that of 
temsirolimus AUC, due principally to the longer half -life of sirolimus.  
Distribution: Following a single 25 mg intravenous dose, mean steady -state v olume of 
distribution of  temsirolimus in whole blood of patients with cancer was 172 liters. Both 
temsirolimus and  sirolimus are extensively partitioned into formed blood elements.  
Metabolism : Cytochrome P450 3A4 is the major isozyme responsible for the fo rmation 
of five temsirolimus  metabolites. Sirolimus, an active metabolite of temsirolimus, is the 
principal metabolite in  humans following intravenous treatment. The remainder of the 
metabolites account for less  than 10% of radioactivity in the plasma. In human liver 
microsomes temsirolimus was an  inhibitor of CYP2D6 and 3A4. However, there was no 
effect observed in vivo when temsirolimus was administered with desipramine (a 
CYP2D6 substrate), and no effect is anticipated with substrates of CYP3A4 metabolism.  
Elimination: Elimination is primarily via the feces. After a single IV dose of [14C] -
temsirolimus  approximately 82% of total radioactivity was eliminated within 14 days, 
with 4.6% and 78% of the  administered radioactivity recovered in the urine  and feces, 
respectively. Following a single25 mg dose of temsirolimus  in patients with cancer, 
temsirolimus mean (CV) systemic clearance  was 16.2 (22%) L/h. Temsirolimus exhibits a 
bi-exponential decline in whole blood  concentrations and the mean half -lives of 
temsirolimus and sirolimus were 17.3 hr and 54.6 hr,  respectively.  
Drug Interactions: Co -administration of temsirolimus  with rifampin, a potent CYP3A4/[ADDRESS_183255] on temsirolimus Cmax (maximum concentration) and 
AUC (area und er the concentration versus  the time curve) after intravenous 
administration, but decreased sirolimus Cmax by 65%  and AUC by 56% compared to 
temsirolimus  treatment alone. If alternative treatment cannot be  administered, a dose 
adjustment should be consider ed.  Co-administration of temsirolimus  with 
ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, had no  significant effect on temsirolimus Cmax 
or AUC; however, sirolimus AUC increased 3.[ADDRESS_183256] is anticipated when temsirolim us is co -administered with 
agents that are metabolized by [CONTACT_097]2D6 or CYP3A4. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Temsirolimus Drug Interactions    
Concomitant Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors : The concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors should be avoided (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, 
  
 Protocol 2011 -0358 
July 28 , 2017 
Page 16 
 
 atazanavir, indinavir,nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, 
and voriconazole). Grapefruit juice  may also increase plasma concentrations of 
sirolimus (a major metabolite of temsirolimus) and should be avoided. If 
patients must be co -administered a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, based on  
pharmacokinetic studies, a temsirolimus  dose reduction to 12.5 mg/week 
should be considered.  This dose of temsirolimus  is predicted to adjust the AUC 
to the range observed without inhibit ors. 
However, there are no clinical data with this dose adjustment in patients 
receiving strong  CYP3A4 inhibitors. If the strong inhibitor is discontinued, a 
washout period of approximately 1 week should be allowed before the temsirolimus dose is adjusted back to the dose used prior to initiation of the 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitor.  (see previous table in [IP_ADDRESS] )   
Concomitant Strong CYP3A4 Inducers : The use of concomitant strong CYP3A4 
inducers should be avoided (e.g. dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
rifampin, rifabutin, rifampacin, phenobarbital). If patients must be co -
administered a strong CYP3A4 inducer, based on pharmacokinetic studies, a 
temsirolimus dose increase from 25 mg/week up to 50 mg/week should be 
considered. This dose of temsirolimus is  predicted to adjust the AUC to the 
range observed without inducers. However, there are no clinical data with this dose adjustment in patients receiving strong CYP3A4 inducers. If the strong 
inducer is discontinued the temsirolimus dose should be returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the strong CYP3A4 inducer  
3.2.[ADDRESS_183257] been o bserved with temsirolimus  
Temsirolimus should be used with caution in persons with known hypersensitivity to 
temsirolimus or its metabolites (including sirolimus), polysorbate 80, or to any other 
component (including the excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]) of temsirolimus. 
An H1  antihistamine should be administered to patients before the start of the 
intravenous temsirolimus infusion. Temsirolimus should be used with caution in patients 
with known hypersensitivity to an antihistamine, or patients who cannot receive an 
antihistami ne for other medical reasons.  
If a patient develops a hypersensitivity reaction during the temsirolimus infusion, the 
infusion should be stopped and the patient should be observed for at least 30 to 60 
minutes (depending on the severity of the reaction). At the discretion of the physic ian, 
treatment may be resumed with the administration of an H1 -receptor antagonist (such 
  
 Protocol 2011 -0358

 as diphenhydramine), if not previously administered, and/or an H2 -receptor antagonist 
(such as intravenous famotidine 20 mg or intravenous ranitidine 50 mg) approximat ely 
30 minutes before restarting the temsirolimus infusion. The infusion may then be 
resumed at a slower rate (up to 60 minutes).  
Hepatic Impairment  
The safety and pharmacokinetics of temsirolimus were evaluated in a dose escalation 
phase 1study in 110 pat ients with normal or varying degrees of hepatic impairment. 
Patients with baseline bilirubin >1.[ADDRESS_183258] experienced greater toxicity than patients 
with baseline bilirubin ≤1.[ADDRESS_183259] when treated with temsirolimus. The overall 
frequency of ≥ grade 3 adverse  reactions and deaths, including deaths due to 
progressive disease, were greater in patients with baseline bilirubin >1.[ADDRESS_183260]. 
temsirolimus is contraindicated in patients with bilirubin >1.[ADDRESS_183261] be given in patients with mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin >1 –  1.[ADDRESS_183262] >ULN but bilirubin ≤ULN), reduce 
the dose of temsirolimus to15 mg/week.   
 Hyperglycemia/Glucose Intolerance  
The use of temsirolimus is likely to result in increases in serum glucose. In the phase 3 trial, 89% of patients receiving temsirolim us had at least one elevated serum glucose 
while on treatment, and 26% of patients reported hyperglycemia as an adverse event. This may result in the need for an increase in the dose of, or initiation of, insulin and/or oral hypoglycemic agent therapy. Ser um glucose should be tested before and during 
treatment with temsirolimus. Patients should be advised to report excessive thirst or any increase in the volume or frequency of urination.  
 
Infections  
The use of temsirolimus may  result in immunosuppression. P atients should be carefully 
observed for the occurrence of infections, including opportunistic infections  
 
Interstitial Lung Disease  
Cases of interstitial lung disease, some resulting in death, occurred in patients who received temsirolimus. Some patients were asymptomatic with infiltrates detected on 
computed tomography scan or chest radiograph. Others presented with symptoms such 
as dyspnea, cough, hypoxia, and fever. Some patients required discontinuation of 
temsirolimus  and/or treatment with corticosteroids and/or antibiotics, while some 
patients continued treatment without additional intervention. Patients should be advised to repor t promptly any new or worsening respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856].

 Hyperlipemia  
The use of temsirolimus is likely to result in increases in serum triglycerides and 
cholesterol. In the phase 3 trial, 87% of patients receiving temsirolimus  had at least one 
elevated seru m cholesterol value and 83% had at least one elevated serum triglyceride 
value. This may require initiation, or increase in the dose, of lipid-lowering agents. 
Serum cholesterol and triglycerides should be tested before and during treatment with 
temsirolim us. 
 Bowel Perforation  
Cases of fatal bowel perforation occurred in patients who received temsirolimus. These patients presented with fever, abdominal pain, metabolic acidosis, bloody stools, 
diarrhea, and/or acute abdomen. Patients should be advised to re port promptly any 
new or worsening abdominal pain or blood in their stools. 
 
Renal Failure  
Cases of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_157742]. Some of these cases were not responsive to dialysis.  
 Wound Healing Complications  
Use of temsirolimus has been associated with abnormal wound healing. Therefore, caution should be exercised with the use of temsirolimus in the perioperative period.  
 
Intracerebral Hemorrhage  
Patients with central nervous system tumors (primary CNS tumor or metastases) and/or 
receiving anticoagulation therapy may be at an increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_157743] (including fatal outcomes) while receiving tems irolimus.

and TY21a typhoid vaccines. 
 
Pregnancy  
Pregnancy Category D :  Temsirolimus administered daily as a n oral formulation caused 
embryo -fetal and intrauterine toxicities in rats and rabbits at human sub -therapeutic 
exposures. Embryo -fetal adverse effects  in rats consisted of reduced fetal weight and 
reduced ossifications, and in rabbits included reduced fet al weight, omphalocele, 
bifurcated sternabrae, notched ribs, and incomplete ossifications .In rats, the 
intrauterine and embryo -fetal adverse effects were observed at the oral dose of 2.7 
mg/m2/day (approximately 0.04 -fold the AUC in cancer patients at the  human 
recommended dose). In rabbits, the intrauterine and embryo -fetal adverse effects were 
observed at the oral dose of ≥7.2 mg/m2/day (approximately 0.12 -fold the AUC in 
cancer patients at the recommended human dose).

6.0 DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
6.[ADDRESS_183288] occur prior to re -initiating therapy with 
agent responsible for the toxicity. Treatment with the same agent will resume as soon as 
possible with the appropriate dose reductions. Patients receiving treatment who experience an 
adverse event that necessitates its interruption and a delay of ≥ 6 weeks in its re -initiation will 
discontinue it and come off protocol.  In all cases, patients, who are withd rawn from the study 
due to adverse event(s), must be followed until resolution of the adverse event(s)  or start of 
new treatment.  If a patient experiences s everal toxicities leading to conflicting 
recommendations, the recommended dose adjustment reducing the dose to the lowest  level 
will be used. The dose of any study drug may be re- escalated to a higher level following 
discussion with the principal investiga tor. All dose modifications will follow predefined dose 
levels.  
Patients who require any emergency intervention (e.g. for appendectomy or  cholecystectomy  
because of trauma complications) or who require a procedure (e.g. Kyphoplasty/vertebroplasty) 
may rema in on trial, even if administration of the targeted agent is interrupted, as long as the 
targeted agent is resumed within [ADDRESS_183289] pulmonary embolism may 
receive anticoagulation and continue treatment on protocol at the discretion of the treating 
physician.

[IP_ADDRESS] Guidelines for Management of Treatment Emergent Hepatotoxicity  
In the event of treatment emergent hepatotoxicity, potential contributing factors 
such as concomitant medications, viral hepatitis, choledocholithiasis, and hepatic 
metastases should be investigated. Concomitant medications known to be 
hepatotoxic which may be contributing to liver dysfunction should be discontinued 
or replaced with alternative medications to allow for recovery of live r function. As 
generally understood, ALT >3x ULN and concomitant bilirubin ≥2.0xULN (>35% 
direct bilirubin), in the absence of elevated alkaline phosphatase or biliary injury, suggests significant liver injury. The table below provides guidelines for 
hepat otoxicity monitoring.   
Event  Dose Modification Algorithms  
(A). ALT ≤ 3.[ADDRESS_183290]  Continue study treatment at current dose with LFTs monitored 
as per protocol.  Dose Level  Pazopanib

bilirubin elevation 
(defined as total bilirubin 
<2.[ADDRESS_183293] 
bilirubin ≤35%) and without hypersensitivity 
symptoms (e.g., fever, 
rash)  Liver Event Monitoring Criteria:  
(1) Continue study treatment at current dose levels.  (2) Monitor subject closely for clinical signs and symptoms; 
perform full  panel LFTs once weekly or more frequently if 
clinically indicated until ALT/AST is reduced to Grade 1.  
(C). ALT >8.[ADDRESS_183294] 
without bilirubin 
elevation (defined as total 
bilirubin <2.[ADDRESS_183295] bilirubin ≤35%) and 
without hypersensitivity 
symptoms (e.g., fever, 
rash)  1st occurrence – Liver Event Interruption Criteria:  
(1) Interrupt treatment until toxicity resolves to ≤Grade 1 or 
baseline. Repeat liver chemistries within 24 to 72 hours.  
(2) Monitor subject closely for cl inical signs and symptoms; 
perform full panel LFTs once weekly or more frequently if 
clinically indicated until ALT is reduced to Grade 1.  
(4) If the subject is benefiting from the study treatment, 
consider re- challenge. Re -treatment may be considered at a 
dose of 400 mg once daily and with weekly serum liver tests x 8 
weeks, if ALL following criteria are met:  
- ALT reduced to Grade 1  
- Total bilirubin <1.[ADDRESS_183296] bilirubin ≤35%  
- No hypersensitivity signs or symptoms  
- Subject is benefiting f rom therapy.  
Recurrence – Liver Event Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2121]:  
Discontinue pazopanib permanently and monitor subject 
closely for clinical signs and symptoms; perform full panel LFTs 
once weekly or more frequently if clinically indicated until ALT 
is reduced to Grade 1.  
(D). ALT >3.[ADDRESS_183297] with 
concomitant elevation in 
bilirubin2 (defined as total 
bilirubin ≥2.[ADDRESS_183298]; with 
direct bilirubin >35%) or 
with hypersensitivity 
symptoms (e.g., fever, rash)   Liver Event Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2121]:  
(1) Discontinue treatment immediately, and report the event 
to [COMPANY_001] as an SAE with in 24 hours of learning of its 
occurrence. Repeat LFTs within 24 hours.  
(2) Consult a gastroenterologist / hepatologist, and perform 
the following assessments to identify potential co -factors:  
- Eosinophil count  
- Viral serology for hepatitis A, B, C and E, cytomegalovirus, 
Epstein -Barr virus (IgM antibody, heterophile antibody, or 
monospot testing)  
- Anti-nuclear antibody, anti -smooth muscle antibody, anti -
mitochondrial antibody  
- Serum creatinine phosphokinase  for possible muscle injury 
caused LFT elevation

 - Liver imaging  
(3) Monitor subject closely for clinical signs and symptoms; 
record the appearance or worsening of clinical symptoms of 
hepatitis, or hypersensitivity, such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, 
right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever rash or 
eosinophilia a s relevant on the AE report form. Perform full 
panel LFTs weekly or more frequently if clinically indicated until 
LFTs are reduced to Grade 1.  
For isolated total bilirubin 
elevation without concurrent ALT increases 
(defined as ALT <[ADDRESS_183299]).  (1) Isolate d hyperbilirubinemia (i.e., in the absence of elevated 
ALT or other signs/symptoms of liver injury) does not require 
dose modification. Pazopanib inhibits UGT1A1 and OATP1B1, 
which can cause elevation of indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin 
in the absence of liver injury.  
(2) If bilirubin is >[ADDRESS_183300] (unconjugated), continue 
pazopanib at the same dose. If bilirubin is >35% dire ct 
(conjugated), further evaluation for underlying cause of cholestasis should be performed.  
 
1. Full panel LFTs include: AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, , and total bilirubin.  
2. Serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is available. If testing is 
unavailable and a subject meets the criterion of total bilirubin ≥2.[ADDRESS_183301], then the event 
should be promptly reported as defined.  
3. When a liver chemistry event meets  the Liver Event Interruption Criteria, or Liver Event 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2121], blood samples should be obtained for clinical laboratory testing.

Grade 4: life -threatening (e.g., hypertensive crisis)  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Concomitant Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors:   
The concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, ritonavir, 
clarithromycin) may increase pazopanib concentrations and should be avoided. If coadministration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is warranted, reduce th e dose of 
pazopanib to [ADDRESS_183302] the pazopanib AUC to the range observed without inhibitors. However, there are no clinical data with this 
dose adjustment in patients receiving strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. 
[IP_ADDRESS]
  12-Lead Electrocardiogram  
 
In clinical studies with pazopanib, events of QT cB prolongation have occurred.  For 
patients receiving pazopanib a  12-lead ECG will be obtained at Screening/Base line 
and again at Cycle [ADDRESS_183303] for 
approximately 10 minutes.  
If the QT cB interval at any ECG during treatment is ≥ 500 msec, study drug will be 
held and the ECG should be repeated within 7 days and, if the QT cB interval remains 
  
 Protocol 2011 -0358 
July 28 , 2017 
Page 32 
 
 ≥ [ADDRESS_183304] should be removed from the study.  The ECG can be 
performed at an outside facility with results sent to MDACC.  
Additionally, if t he QT cB interval is increased by 60 msec or more from baseline, but 
the QT cB interval remains at < 500 msec, an ECG should be repeated within 7 
days.   If the repeat ECG again shows a ≥ [ADDRESS_183305] from the study or 
increasing monitoring, after discussion with the principal investigator.  
NOTE: If the QT cB prolongation > 500 msec is clearly and causally associated with an 
underlying situation that is clearly revers ible (e.g., a subject with severe diarrhea 
and hypokalemia with QT cB prolongation that resolves once the diarrhea improves 
and potassium is corrected), then the subject may restart study drug once the  
underlying situation has been corrected (e.g., electrol ytes supplemented), the QT cB 
interval prolongation has resolved.   
6.1.2 Temsirolimus Dose Modifications  
 [IP_ADDRESS]. Hepatic Impairment: Use caution when treating patients with hepatic 
impairment. If temsirolimus must be given in patients with mild hepatic impairment 
(bilirubin >1 – 1.[ADDRESS_183306]  >ULN but bilirubin ≤ULN), reduce the dose of 
temsirolimus  to 15 mg/week. Temsirolimus  is contraindicated in patients with 
bilirubin >1.[ADDRESS_183307] .  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Hypertriglyceridemia  
Patients who have persistently elev ated serum triglycerides (> 1000mg/dL)  for ≥ 4 
weeks,   despi[INVESTIGATOR_104195]-lowering agents , or patients who develop 
pancreatitis  (regardless of the duration of the preceding triglyceride elevation)  
should discontinue temsirolimus  and come off protocol.  
 
 Temsirolimus should be held for absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 1,000/mm3, 
platelet count< 75,000/mm3, or NCI CTCAE grade [ADDRESS_183308] resolved to grade 1 or less, temsirolimus may be res tarted with 
the dose reduced by 5 mg/week to  a dose no lo wer than 15 mg/week.  
 
  
6.2 Concomitant Drugs  
Patients receiving both pazopanib and temsirolimus will be instructed not to take any additional 
medications (including over -the-counter products) during the course of the study without prior 
consultation with the investigator. At each visit, the investigator will ask the patient about any 
new medications he/she is or has taken after the start of the study drug.  All concomitant 
  
 Protocol 2011 -0358

 medications/s ignificant non -drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_32546] ≤ 30 days prior to start and after start of study 
drug, including physical therapy and blood transfusions, should be recorded.  Plea se reference 
the Warnings and Precautions section for CYP3A4 -related drugs in the temsirolimus label and 
the Dose Modification Guidelines  section in the pazopanib label for further detail.  
 The following restrictions apply during the entire duration of the study:  
• No other investigational therapy should be given to patients.  
• No anticancer agents other than the study medication should be given to patients. If such 
agents are required for a patient then the patient must first be withdrawn from the study.  
• It is highly recommended that patients with positive HBV -DNA or HBsAg are treated 
prophylactically with an antiviral for 1 -2 weeks prior to receiving study drug.  
• The antiviral treatment should continue throughout the entire study period and for at least 
[ADDRESS_183309] dose of study drug.  
• Patients on antiviral prophylaxis treatment or positive HBV antibodies should be tested for 
HBV -DNA according to study visit schedule.  
 
Seville orange, star fruit, grapefruit and their juices affect P450 and PgP activity. Concomitant 
use should be avoided  
No chronic treatment with systemic steroids (at a dose equivalent of greater than 20 mg prednisone per day) or other immunosuppressive agents. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_129534].  
The use of live vac cines and close contact [CONTACT_157766]. Examples of live vaccines include intranasal 
influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, BCG, yellow fever, varicella and TY21a typhoid 
vaccines.   
7.0 QUALITY OF LIFE ASSESSMENT  
 
Measuring quality of life (QOL) outcomes in cancer patients has become an important mandate for 
clinical trials.  It is especially important to assess QOL in phase II cancer clinical trials that are likely to 
move into the phase III setting.  The extent to  which treatment impairs QOL is information the patients 
need when making treatment decisions.   
Patients will experience somewhat different symptoms when they receive the different therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  In 
order to assess the effects of these treatments, we will as sess multidimensional aspects of QOL over 
the treatment course.  
 
Assessment Schedule  
  
 Protocol 2011 -0358 
July 28 , 2017 
Page 34 
 
 All patients will complete a full assessment battery at baseline, prior to treatment.  Patients will then 
complete an assessment battery every 8 weeks when they come in for their clinical evaluation (see 
Table 1). 
Table 1:  Data collection sessions for psychosocial measures 
BASELINE  FOLLOW -UP   
(EVERY 8 WEEKS)  
•  FACT -G 
•  FKSI-15 
•  Depression (CES -D) • FACT -G 
• FKSI-15 
• CES-D 
 
Instruments  
Several measures used previously in our work on chronic stress and QOL will be used in the proposed 
study.  In all cases, they have proven to be useful and sensitive measures of stress and QOL, have 
proven to be stable, reliable, and valid with groups of people who are and are not suffering from major 
depression or other psychiatric disorders. 
Quality of Life  
The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) is a cancer -specific measure of health -related 
quality of life. This instrument was able to discriminate between individuals with metastat ic and non -
metastatic disease, as well as between patients at different stages of illness.  The scale has been found to have good concurrent validity, high internal consistency (0.89), and good test re- test reliability (0.82 
to 0.88).  The FACT will be com pleted at each assessment.  Kidney cancer specific QOL symptoms will be 
assessed with the FKSI -[ADDRESS_183310] group.  
Depression:   
 Depression will be assessed using the Centers for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_7307] - Depression (CES -D).  The CES -
D is a well-validated [ADDRESS_183311] been recommended.  Internal 
consistency is high in the general population and in patient populations.  It also has been demonstrated to possess adequate convergent validity with other measures of depression.  The CES -D will be 
comp leted at baseline and at each subsequent clinical visit (every 8 weeks).  
 
8.0 CORRELATIVE STUDIES  
Optional b lood will be collected on day 1 of cycle 1, day 1 of every other cycle , and at the end of 
treatment.  Blood will be stored in the GU Biorepository  and tissue will be stored in the MD Anderson 
institutional tissue bank .     
 
We plan to identify and quantify circulating endothelial cells (CECs) in peripheral blood. We hypothesize 
that CECs correlate with tumor angiogenesis in mRCC and may thus be usefu l for the monitoring of 
disease progression. Moreover, we expect to find treatment -related effects on CECs, which could 
contribute to the assessment of response in future studies with anti -angiogenic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The presence 
  
 Protocol [ADDRESS_183312] been identified: Circulating endothelial pr ogenitor cells, mainly 
derived from bone marrow, which may contribute to the formation of new blood vessels in the tumor; 
and mature CECs, thought to be derived from established vasculature. In addition to immunophenotypic 
markers like CD146, CD133, VEGFR2 and CD31, both populations can be distinguished by a distinctive 
ability for proliferation. We will obtain a mononuclear cell fraction from each blood specimen and detect 
CECs by [CONTACT_74064] -activated cell sorting analysis. We will systematically examine  changes in the 
plasma and serum angiogenic profiles consisting of a panel of pro -angiogenic cytokines, targeted 
receptors, and potential biomarkers of endothelial damage.  
 
The analysis of plasma- and serum- based biomarkers will focus on two groups of prot eins. First, factors 
known to be modulated by [CONTACT_157767]. Such biomarkers include plasma VEGF and soluble VEGFR -2, as well as soluble VEGFR -[ADDRESS_183313] 
growth factor (bFGF), transforming growth factor α (TGFα), and interleukin -8 (IL -8), will be assessed 
quantitatively by [CONTACT_157768]- linked immunos orbent assay (ELISA). Second, we will broadly screen 
a set of approximately 100 known angiogenic factors by [CONTACT_157769]. Candidate cytokines identified using the array will then be assayed 
individually.  
Plasma VEGF levels will be measured using commercially available ELISA kits. VEGF levels can be 
accurately detected at a level of 6 –20,000 pg/ml with a coefficient of variance of less than 10% by [CONTACT_157770]. TGF α, bFGF, IL -8, and other soluble factors will be analyzed using similar methodologies. 
Together with the cytokine array, these assays will form an angiogenic profile that will be monitored 
during treatment and at time of disease progression.  
We will also use these assays to find correlat ions with adverse events. Our hypothetis is that 
cardiovascular toxicity may be related to baseline levels and/or changes of inflammatory cytokines, 
angiogenic factors, or markers of endothelial damage or repair.   
Immunological studies will be conducted t o define changes in effector and regulatory T cell populations 
and/or function and changes in cytokine profiles that occur after patients have started treatment. Laboratory techniques will follow previously published methods and will include flow cytometry , ELISA 
assays, ELISPOT assays, Affymatrix analyses, microRNA analyses, Western blot and reverse -phase 
protein array analyses. [ADDRESS_183314] DNA from the FFPE tissue sections for analysis with Affymetrix 250K Nsp SNP 
microarrays to identify genomic imbalances and loss of heterozygosity (LOH)  (Samples will be sent to [CONTACT_157776] at Baylor College of Medicine for SNP Analys is, please see Appendix G  for procedural  
details ).  
By [CONTACT_157771], we aim to generate correlative information that will permit improved 
therapeutic applications in the future.   
We also aim to evaluate the loss of SETD2 histone methyltransfer ase activity, its effect on the decreases 
of H3K36 trimethylation (H3K36Me3) and the possible promotion of tumorigenesis in RCC. ( Samples will 
be sent to [CONTACT_157777] at Mayo Clinic –  Scottsdale, AZ for analysis, p lease see Appendix H  for procedural 
details .)

10.0 CRITERIA FOR RESPONSE AND PROGRESSION  
10.1 Definitions  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_8225] (RECIST) Committee. Changes in 
only the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesion s are used in the 
  
 Protocol [ADDRESS_183321] criteria. Note: Lesions are either measurable or non-measurable using the criteria 
provided below. The term “evaluable” in reference to measurability will not be used because it 
does not provide additional meaning or accuracy.  
 
10.1.[ADDRESS_183322] one 
dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >20 mm with conventional techniques 
(CT, MRI, x -ray) or as >[ADDRESS_183323] be 
recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters). In patients with primary 
tumor in place, the primary tumor will not be considered a site of measurable disease.  
10.1.2 Non -measurable disease  
 
All other lesions (or s ites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter <20 mm 
with conventional techniques or <[ADDRESS_183324] scan), are considered non -
measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial 
effusions, lymphangit is cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses 
(not followed by [CONTACT_462]), and cystic lesions are all non-measurable.  
10.1.3 Target Lesions  
 
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total, 
repr esentative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded 
and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by [CONTACT_14217]). A sum of the longest 
diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum 
LD. The baseline sum LD will be used as reference by [CONTACT_36928].  
10.1.4 Non -Target Lesions  
 
All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non -target lesions and 
should also be recorded at baseline. Non -target lesions include measurable lesions that 
exceed the maximum numbers per organ  or total of all involved organs as well as non-
measurable lesions. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence 
or absence of each should be noted throughout follow -up.  
10.[ADDRESS_183325] of a treatment.  
Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_157772], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
Chest x -ray: Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. However, CT is preferable.  
Conventional CT  and MRI: These techniques should be performed with cuts of [ADDRESS_183326], abdomen, and pelvis. Head and 
neck tumors and those of extremities usually require specific protocols.  
Ultrasound (US): When the primary endpoint of the study is objective response evaluation, US 
should not be used to measure tumor lesions. It is, however, a possible alternative to clin ical 
measurements of superficial palpable lymph nodes, subcutaneous lesions, and thyroid nodules. US might also be useful to confirm the complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually 
assessed by [CONTACT_12148].  
Endoscopy/Laparoscopy: The uti lization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation has 
not yet been fully and widely validated. Their uses in this specific context require sophisticated equipment and a high level of expertise that may only be available in some centers. Therefore , 
the utilization of such techniques for objective tumor response should be restricted to validation 
purposes in reference centers. However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete 
pathological response when biopsies are obtained.  
Tumor markers:  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response. If markers are initially 
above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response. Specific additional criteria for standardized usage of prostate -specific antigen 
(PSA) and CA -125 response in support of clinical trials are being developed.  
Cytology/Histology: These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial responses 
(PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesio ns in tumor types, such as 
germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is 
mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect 
of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
10.3 Response Criteria  
 
  
 Protocol 2011 -0358 
July 28 , 2017 
Page 41 
 
 10.3.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR): Dis appearance of all target lesions  
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD  
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the 
appearance of one or more new lesions  
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shr inkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase 
to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started  
10.3.2 Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of 
tumor marker level  
Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (SD): Persistence of one or more non-target 
lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limi ts  
Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non -target lesions. Although a clear progression of “non -target” 
lesions only is exceptional, in such circumstances the opi[INVESTIGATOR_157747], and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_157773] (or study chair).  
Note: If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize 
for a patient to be considered in complete  clinical response.  
10.3.[ADDRESS_183327] response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measure ments recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best 
response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and 
confirmation criteria.

Note:  
 
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be 
classified as having “symptomatic deterioration.” Every effort should be made to document the objective progression, even after discontinuation of treatment.  
In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal 
tissue. When the evaluation of complete response depends on this determination, it is 
recommended th at the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) 
before confirming the complete response status.  
 
10.4 Confirmatory Measurement/Duration of Response  
10.4.1 Duration of overall response  
 The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are 
met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or 
progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.

11.0 Serious Adverse Event Reporting (SAE)    
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience –  any adverse experience that places the patient, in the 
view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse experience as it occurred. It 
does not include an adverse experience that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death. 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_157748], unless hospi[INVESTIGATOR_062]: 
  
 Protocol 2011 -0358 
July 28 , 2017 
Page 43 
 
 • routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any 
deterioration in condition (specify what this includes)  
• elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the indication 
under study and has not worsened since the start of study drug  
• treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of 
a SAE given above and  not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]  
• social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_064]’s general condition  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life 
functions. 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_45790] a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize t he patient or subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical 
events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, bl ood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR 312.32).  
• Important medical events as defined above, may also be considered serious adverse events. Any 
important medi cal event can and should be reported as an SAE if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_1268] . All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the 
definition of a SAE must be reported to the IRB in accordance with the timeframes and  procedures 
outlined in “The University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board (IRB) 
Policy for Investigators on Reporting Unanticipated Adverse Events for Drugs and Devices”.   For this 
protocol adverse events will be captured acc ording to the Recommended Adverse Event Recording 
Guideline for Phase II protocols (below).

The Investigator or physician designee is responsible for verifying and providing source documentation 
for all adverse events and assigning the attribution for each ev ent for all subjects enrolled on the trial  
•   Serious adverse events will be captured from the time of the first protocol -specific intervention,  
until [ADDRESS_183329] study treatment/intervention, unless the participant withdraws 
consent. Serious adv erse events must be followed until clinical recovery is complete and 
laboratory tests have returned to baseline, progression of the event has stabilized, or there has 
been acceptable resolution of the event.  
• Additionally, any serious adverse events that occur after the [ADDRESS_183330] be reported In accordance with the IRB policy.  This may include the 
development of a secondary malignancy.  
 
Reporting to FDA:  
•  SAE’s will be reported per regulatory (local and federal) guidelines.  
 
It is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_157749], Good Clinical Practices, the p rotocol 
guidelines, the supporter  guidelines, and Institutional Review Board policy.

July 28 , 2017 
Page 45 
 
 All events reported to the FDA by [CONTACT_109] 3500A 
(MedWatch Form).  
To ensure patient safety, every SAE, regardless of suspected causality, occurring  
• after the patient has provided informed consent and until at  least 30 days  after the patient 
has stopped study treatment/participation  
• after protocol -specified procedures begin (e.g., placebo run -in, washout period, double-
blind treatment, etc.) and 30 days  after the patient has stopped study treatment  
• after the start of any period in which the study protocol interferes with the standard 
medical treatment given to a patient (e.g., treatment withdrawal during washout period, 
change in treatment to a fixed dose of concomitant medication) and until [ADDRESS_183331] be reported to [COMPANY_001] within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence  
Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on a Serious Adverse Event Report Form; all 
applicable sections of the form must b e completed in order to provide a clinically thorough 
report. The investigator must assess and record the relationship of each SAE to each specific 
study treatment (if there is more than one study treatment), complete the SAE Report Form in 
English, and send the completed, signed form by [CONTACT_12100] (fax: 877 -778-9739) within 24 hours to 
the oncology [COMPANY_001] DS&E department with the provided FAX cover sheets . 
This includes serious, related, labeled (expected) and serious, related, unlabeled (unexpected) adverse  experiences. All deaths during treatment or within [ADDRESS_183332] be kept within the Trial 
Master File at the study site.  
Follow -up information is sent to the same fax number as the original SAE Report Form was sent, 
using a new fax cover sheet, stating that this is a follow -up to the previously rep orted SAE, and 
giving the date of the original report. Each re -occurrence, complication, or progression of the 
original event should be reported as a follow -up to that event regardless of when it occurs. The 
  
 Protocol 2011 -0358 
July 28 , 2017 
Page 46 
 
 follow -up information should describe whether th e event has resolved or continues, if and how 
it was treated, whether the blind was broken or not (if applicable), and whether the patient 
continued or withdrew from study participation.  
If the SAE is not previously documented in the Pazopanib Investigator  Brochure or Package 
Insert (new occurrence) and is thought to be related to the [COMPANY_001] study drug, a DS&E associate may urgently require further information from the investigator for Health Authority 
reporting. [COMPANY_001] may need to issue an Investigator  Notification (IN), to inform all investigators 
involved in any study with the same drug that this SAE has been reported.  Suspected 
Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethic s committees in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC 
or as per national regulatory requirements in participating countries. 
To ensure patient safety, each pregnancy occurring while the patient is on study treatment must 
be reported to [COMPANY_001] within 24 ho urs of learning of its occurrence.  
 
 
12.0 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM PROTOCOL TREATMENT  
 
Subjects who meet the following criteria should be discontinued from study treatment:  
• Progressive disease: Patients, who develop rapi[INVESTIGATOR_157750], may be taken off study at the discretion of the investigator, if they are not felt to 
be candidates to begin treatment with the second agent.  
• Intercurrent illness that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_021]/investigator, prevents 
continuation of treatment.  
• Decision of the patient to withdraw from the study, or pati ent non -compliance with therapy.  
• Grade ≥ 2 pulmonary or CNS hemorrhage; any Grade 4 hemorrhage  
• Any grade arterial thromboembolic event  
• Grade 4 congestive heart failure  
• Gastrointestinal perforation  
• Wound dehiscence requiring surgical intervention

 13.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This is a randomized, two -arm, parallel group, phase II trial enrolling advanced, poor -risk, clear -cell RCC.  
Patients will be fairly randomized to either temsirolimus (control arm) or  pazopanib (experimental arm).  
The maxi mum sample size to be accrued is 90 patients (45 in each treatment arm).  The primary 
measure of efficacy and primary endpoint is progression free survival (PFS).  PFS will be monitored on an 
interim basis and we will use stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_157751].  The 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_157752] -hoc in nature but are selected in a manner such that the overall type 1 error is 
controlled at a one -sided 10% with 80% power.  
Descriptive and inferential statistics will be used to summarize treatment effects.  The mean, standard deviation, median, 25% percentile, 75% percentile, minimum, and maximum will be reported for 
continuous variables.  For discrete variables, descriptive analyses will be based on the distribution of 
discrete outcomes and will be reported as percentages and patient counts. Time to event endpoints will be descriptively summarized by [CONTACT_5263] -Meier curves.  Point and interval estimates of treatment effect 
will be based on maximum likelihood methods.  For binomially distri buted variables, we will report 
differences in proportions between treatment groups and the 95% confidence interval associated with those differences.  We will estimate treatment effects for time to event variables via hazard ratios using 
Wald scores from Cox proportional hazard regression models.  Unless stated otherwise, all statistical 
tests will be assessed using a two -sided a= 0.05 alpha significance level and confidence intervals will be 
constructed using two -sided 95% and will be based on the normal approximation.  Although multiple 
secondary endpoints will be evaluated we will make no adjustment for multiplicities associated with these multiple tests.  
Estimation of Sample Size  
The clinical hypothesis we are assessing in this trial is whether patients  receiving the experimental 
therapy have a lower hazard of progression or death relative to patients receiving the control therapy.  
The statistical hypothesis is stated as:  
H0: log(HR)=0  
HA: log(HR)<[ADDRESS_183333] ratio (experimental:control).  For sample size calculation purposes we assume 
that the median PFS in the temsirolimus arm is 60% that of the pazopanib arm (3.8 months versus 6.1 
months).  The sample size estimate is based on a one-sided log -rank test with type one error equ al to 
0.[ADDRESS_183334] been observed.  If the p-value used 
to assess futility at the interim analysis is greater than 0.4798 we will stop the trial early for futility.   
  
 Protocol 2011 -0358 
July 28 , 2017 
Page 48 
 
 Secondary Objectives   
Overall survival: Overall survival is calculated from day of therapy initiation to the date of death.  
Patients who are lost to follow -up will be censored at date of last contact.   
We will use the Kaplan-Meier estimator to estimate the OS for each group of patients (control, 
experimental), and the log -rank statistic will be used to test for treatment differences.  We will also use 
the Cox proportional hazards regression model to estimate the hazard ratio (experimental:control) for 
OS with a 95% confidenc e interval.  
We will also assess the response rate and report 95% confidence intervals.  
 
Additional analyses : 
 
Demographics    
For each treatment group (control, experimental), summary statistics will be provided for age, weight, baseline disease status and prior treatments.  
 
Toxicities  
 Toxicities and side effects that will be evaluated include, but are not limited to infections, renal 
toxicity, hepatic toxicity, and pulmonary toxicity.  Methods of assessment will include 
monitoring blood counts, and performing laboratory tests as indicated by [CONTACT_157774]. Evidence of toxicities or adverse events will be recorded at all clinic visits.  All 
observed toxicities and side effects will be graded (NCI CTC -AE v. 4.0) for all patients and the 
degree o f association of each with pazopanib or temsirolimus assessed.  The incidence and 
severity of toxicities will be compared between the two treatment  arms with Fisher’s exact test.  
 
Stratification Factors  
The Pocock -Simon Minimization Method will be used to randomize patients  according to the 
following stratification factors:  
− Prior nephrectomy status (yes or no)  
− Prior cytokine/vaccine therapy (yes or no)  
The randomization program based on this method will be developed in the Department of 
Biostatistics and Applied Mathematics, and the program will  be available via an intranet web 
site of MD Anderson Cancer Center.  
Data Analyses for Quality of Life Measures  
Prior to inferential procedures, extensive descriptive analyses will be conducted for each of the  
measures obtained at each session.  Descriptive statistics (e.g., means, ranges, standard 
deviations) will be computed, together with ninety -five percent confidence intervals for the 
means.  Proportions of subjects falling outside normative ranges for the stress and QOL 
measures will also be calculated.  Values for the standardized scales will be compared to normative data and patients receiving other types of cancer therapy.  Graphical methods (e.g., 
boxplots and histograms) will be employed to more closely examine the distributions of the 
  
 Protocol 2011 -0358 
July 28 , 2017 
Page 49 
 
 measures at each time point.  Change scores for the stress and QOL measures will be computed 
as the simple differences between the baseline measure and subsequent evaluations.  Bivariate 
associations between the raw scor es, the change scores, optimism, social support, and 
demographic variables will be evaluated using Pearson’s product moment correlation 
coefficients together with scatterplots where appropriate.  These procedures will allow us to 
thoroughly characterize th e stress and QOL profiles of this patient population across the 
sessions.  
In this study, numerous models will be constructed to analyze the data and, therefore, the results will be treated as hypothesis generating and interpreted with caution.  Inferential  
statistics will comprise paired t -tests of the stress and QOL measures.  Significant test results (p 
< .05) will be interpreted as indicating significant changes in depression and QOL associated with the treatment.    The association between depression an d survival and TTP will also be 
examined. 
14.0 REPORTING AND EXCLUSIONS  
14.1 Evaluation of toxicity :  
 
Patients will be evaluable for toxicity related to the targeted therapy given in the first stage and 
in the second stage.  
 14.2 Evaluation of response:   
 
All patients who are registered and assigned to treatment will be assessed for response.  
All patients who met the eligibility criteria (with the possible exception of those who received no study medication) should be included in the main analysis of the response rate. Patients with an 
incorrect treatment schedule or drug administration does no t result in exclusion from the 
analysis of the response rate. Precise definitions for categories [ADDRESS_183335] been 
identified (e.g., early death due to other reasons, early discontinuation of treatment, major 
protocol violations, etc.). However, these sub -analyses may not serve as the basis for drawing 
conclusions concerning treatment efficacy, and the reasons for excluding patients from the 
analysis should be clearly reported. Data analysis will be performed using SAS or S-Plus, as 
appropriate. Patients who die of unrelated cause during therapy or are los t to follow -up shall be 
censored.  
 
15.[ADDRESS_183336] be 
signed, witnessed and dated. The consent will contain all the essential elements of informed consent set forth in 21 CFR, Part 50.  
 16.3 Detailed case summaries will be generated for every patient from the database.  
 16.4 Patient Confidentiality: In order to maintain patient privacy, all database generated case 
report forms, study drug accountability records, study reports and communi cations will identify 
the patient by [CONTACT_44144]. The patient’s confidentiality will be

 maintained and will not be made publicly available to the extent permitted by [CONTACT_122833] (21CFR312.63, 21CFR312.68). don’t we have a better paragraph?  
 16.[ADDRESS_183337] Retention: Study records include IRB approved protocol and informed consent, 
including historical copi[INVESTIGATOR_157753], investigational drug brochure, signed informed consent 
forms, documentation of IRB approval,  study forms, database -generated case report forms and 
source documents which allow verification of the case report forms.  NO this needs to be more

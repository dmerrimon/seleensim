A Single -arm Study to Evaluate the Feasibility and Efficacy of a Minimal Monitoring Strategy to 
Deliver Pan- genotypic Ribavirin -free HCV Therapy  to HCV Infected Populations who are HCV 
Treatment Naïve with Evidence of Active HCV Infection : The MINMON Study  
 
DESIGN  This is a p hase IV open- label, multicenter , prospective study to assess 
the feasibility and efficacy  of a minimal monitoring (MINMON) approach in 
active hepatitis C virus ( HCV )-infected , treatment  naïve participants , with 
and without HIV-1 co-infection, and  with no cirrhosis or with compensated 
cirrhosis only . This study will enroll  a cohort of participants with active 
HCV -infection to follow a minimal monitoring protocol , at US and non- US 
sites:  
 
 No pre- treatment HCV genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007];  
 Entire treatment course (84 tablets) given to participants at entry; 
 No scheduled on- treatment laboratory monitoring or clinic visits;  
 Remote contact [CONTACT_832974] 4 (adherence counseling 
and locator update) and week 22 ( scheduling of SVR visit  and locator 
update).  
 
Participants will receive the fixed- dose combination (FDC)  of 
sofosbuvir/v elpatasvir ( SOF/VEL ) for 12 weeks.    
 
DURATION  72 weeks  (see schematic diagram below ) 
 
SAMPLE SIZE [ADDRESS_1156669] ion of any 
genotype, HCV treatment naïve,  with or without HIV-1 co- infection . 
Persons  with either  compensated cirrhosis  or without evidence of 
cirrhosis  are eligible .  
 
STRATIFICATION  The study will use stratification factors to limit enrollment by [CONTACT_832975]. These stratification factors include geographical location 
(limited to no more than 132 participants enrolled from sites in the US 
within the overall study sample), HIV-1 infection (limited to no more than 
200 participants being HIV -1 positive within the overall study sample), 
and cirrhosis status (limited to no more than 80 participants within the 
overall study sample having compensated cirrhosis).  There are no 
additional r estrictions regarding participants who are both HIV -co-infected 
and have compensated cirrhosis, and or/geographical distribution of 
those participants .

 2.0 INTRODUCTION  
 2.1 Background  
 
Global HCV E pi[INVESTIGATOR_832931] 71 million persons who are chronically infected with HCV 
globally  [1]. Almost 90% of these persons reside in low -and-middle -income countries  
(LMICs) . While t he highest prevalence of HCV has been observed in central and East 
Asia, North Africa and the Middle East, the majority of the people chronically infected with HCV are believed to be residing in South and East Asia (>50 million in each;
 Figure 
2.1-1) [2]. India alone is estimated to be home to over [ADDRESS_1156673] Asia 
[3].  
 
 
Figure 2.1 -1: Global distribution of persons chronically infected with HCV  
Darker red colors indicate higher prevalence and the size of the circle reflects

  01/10/[ADDRESS_1156674] LMICs  despi[INVESTIGATOR_832932] (DAAs ) since most therapy until recently demonstrated highest efficacy 
rates in GT1 infection . Unlike HIV therapy, HCV therapy has varying response rates  and 
treatment duration  by [CONTACT_7631] [4] . For example, the fixed dose combination (FDC)  of 
SOF and ledipasvir  (SOF/LDV) that is associated with cure rates of 97 % in real -world 
cohorts of GT1 patients is not recommended for use in GT3 patients  [5]. Similarly, while 
12 weeks of SOF + RBV is recommended for GT1 infections, in persons infected with 
HCV GT3 the treatm ent duration recommended is 24 weeks  [5, 6].    
 
World Health Organization (WHO)/American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases 
(AASLD)/  Infection Diseases Society of America (IDSA)/European Association for the 
Study of the Liver (EASL) HCV Treatment  Guidelines  
 
AASLD/IDSA (www.hcvguidelines.org) and the EASL (www.easl.eu ) guidance for 
monitoring of patients receiving HCV therapy are among the most commonly used in 
clinical practice  (Table 2.1-1 ), given that treatment was not available outside of US and 
Europe until mid- 2015. The [ADDRESS_1156675] guidance on 
management of HCV disease released by [CONTACT_14300],  were based on AASLD and EASL 
recommendations and drug- registration literature available at that time. Preferable 
regimens according to the 2014 WHO guidelines are essentially interferon -based [7]. 
Since the WHO issued these first guidelines in 2014, several new medicines for the 
treatment of HCV infection have been introduced. Of these, daclatasvir ( DCV), ledipasvir   
(LDV) , and a combination of ombitasvir, paritaprevir and dasabuvir were added to the 
WHO Model List of Essential Medicines in 2015 [8]. Currently, the regimens 
recommended by [CONTACT_120055] , and other country -specific treatment guidelines are guided by 
[CONTACT_832976].

adherence  
 
Because the 2014 WHO guidelines primarily include Interferon -based regimens, the 
proposed monitoring process is intensive [7]. More recent monitoring guidelines can be 
found in the February 2016 AASLD/IDSA guidelines  [9], which recommend visits or 
telephone contact [CONTACT_832978]- drug interactions with 
newly prescribed medications. Complete blood count (CBC), creatinine level, calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and hepatic function panel are recommended after 4 
weeks of treatment and as clinically indicated. Quantitative HCV viral load testing is recommended after 4 weeks of therapy and at 12 weeks following completion of therapy. 
If HCV RNA is detectable at week 4 of treatment, repeat quantitative HCV RNA viral load 
testing is recommended after 2 additional weeks of treatment  (i.e., week 6). If 
quantitative HCV viral load has increased by [CONTACT_7809] 10- fold (>1 log10 international 
units  [IU]/mL) on repeat testing at week 6 (or thereafter), then discontinuation of HCV 
treatment is recommended. The significance of a positive HCV RNA test result a t week 4 
that remains positive but lower at week 6 or week 8 is unknown. No recommendation is provided regarding whether to stop therapy or extend therapy in this rare clinical 
situation [1].
  
 While the WHO in their 2016 guidelines  recommend a  simpler monitoring protocol when 
using interferon and RBV -free DAAs for the monitoring of HCV therapy  [8], their 
recommendations have never been implemented in clinical care settings and are based 
on the assumption that simplification of monitoring will not adversely impact the safety 
and efficacy of treatment. To date, minimal monitoring has not been validated in any setting. I ndeed, clinicians  in LMICs have also, to date, largely followed the AASLD and 
EASL guidelines  when delivering HCV therapy . As such, t he impact of the reduced 
clinical contact [INVESTIGATOR_225671]- treatment monitoring remains unknown at this time.  
 
Monitoring of HCV Therapy in Brazil  
The current Brazilian guidelines for HCV and co -infections management were released 
on June 2015  [10]. In general, following diagnosis by [CONTACT_832979], 
HCV RNA quantification is performed to confirm the diagnosis and repeated before treatment initiation. The measurement of HCV RNA is recommended at week 4 of 
treatment as a futility rule if the regimen is pegylated inte rferon (PEG -
IFN)/RBV/d aclatasvir (DCV). Also, HCV RNA at the end of the treatment (i .e., week 12) 
and 12 weeks after the end of treatment are indicated to define SVR. HCV genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_832933]- specific regimen. Liver biopsy,  FibroS can or Aspartate Aminotransferase to

(DAA naïve, HCV monoinfected patients with Metavir F3 or F4, cirrhosis identified 
clinically or by [CONTACT_2207], cryoglobilinemia, among others). HIV co -infected patients are 
eligible for treatment regardless of the presence of fibrosis. The available DAAs currently 
distributed free of charge by [CONTACT_832980], DCV and simeprevir  (SMV) . 
Distribution of DAA started in the beginning of 2016, so there has been very little experience with monitoring associated with these  regimen s. The Brazilian guidelines 
include recommendation for routine laboratory evaluation of chronic HCV, with and 
without cirrhosis, as well as for liver cancer screening but do not have specific recommendations in terms of treatment follow -up aside from HCV RNA. In clinical 
practice, standard monitori ng of HCV th erapy will depend on  the modality of treatment 
and physician expertise. According to the Brazilian Infectious Diseases Society (BIDS) 
recommendation, treatment monitoring should include serum chemistries ( i.e., AST, 
ALT, GGT, Alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin prothrombin and albumin), renal function ( i.e., 
creatinine,  blood urea nitrogen), CBC, glucose, sodium and potassium as minimum 
monitoring for safety  at the end of the first month of treatment. Additional laboratory 
evaluations should be done according to specific patient needs, as well as repeated, if 
clinically necessary. In terms of viral response, the BIDS  suggest ion is to repeat  HCV 
RNA  PCR (polymerase chain reaction)  at week [ADDRESS_1156677]-treatment week s 12 and 24 to evaluate SVR  [11].

Monitoring of HCV Therapy in India 
Clinicians in India treating HCV -infected patients , primarily medical gastroenterologists,  
follow the Indian National Association for the Study of Liver guidelines  [12]. There is no 
special training for infectious diseases such as a fellowship following residency in India and most infectious diseases are treated by [CONTACT_832981] s. Until December 2015, SOF, 
pegylated interferons,  and RBV  (SOF+PEG -IFN/RBV  [PR]) were the only drugs 
 21 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/[ADDRESS_1156678] practice for initiation  of HCV therapy are quantification of HCV RNA  
following diagnosis by [CONTACT_832979], and HCV genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_832934]. Given the majority of patients (>75%) are GT3, the most commonly 
used regimen in India currently is SOF+DCV for 12 weeks with addition of RBV in 
cirrhotics. Hemogram and liver function tests are at 4 -week intervals – additionally, if 
SOF+PR is selected, additional tests recomme nded when using interferon (e .g., thyroid 
stimulating hormone, alfa fetoprotein) are performed prior to initiation of therapy . HCV 
RNA quantification is also routinely performed at end of treatment  (EOT) and if 
undetectable at EOT, an additional HCV RNA quantification is performed 12 weeks later 
to ascertain SVR status. The generic version of SOF/VEL was approved for use in Indi a 
in May 2017.   
 
Monitoring of HCV Therapy in Thailand 
As of January 05, [ADDRESS_1156679] of care  (SOC)  in national free -HCV

(40-50%), followed by [CONTACT_202822] 1 (30- 40%), and GT 6 (15- 20%). Previous studies  showed that 
about 70% of Thai  HCV -infected participants  had significant liver fibrosis and 30% of 
them met the definition for cirrhosis, especially in HIV -1 co-infected individuals, but were 
unable to receive HCV treatment due to financial constr aints.   
 Currently, there is no national guideline for monitoring HCV therapy  in Thailand. Thai 
hepatologists usually treat chronic HCV based on the AASLD/IDSA guidelines. In 
Thailand, SOF and DCV are still expensive; therefore, HCV treatment is prioritized for 
patients who have an urgent medi cal need for HCV treatment. Diagnosis by [CONTACT_832982] a non- invasiv e assessment of liver disease 
(FibroS can or APRI), to clarify whether the patient  has an urgent need for  HCV 
treatment. If APRI>1 or FibroS can>7.5KPa, HCV R NA quantification and HCV 
genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_832935]. For 12 weeks of SOF+PR, CBC and blood chemistries are  
performed at 4- week intervals. Furthermore, additional safety laboratory tests such as 
thyroid- stimulating hormone are performed prior to initiation of therapy. For female 
patients, pregnancy testing is performed every 4 weeks until 6 months after completing the therapy. For interferon- free regimens  (SOF+DCV for GT3 or LDV/SOF for GT 1  and 
GT 6), CBC and blood chemistry are done prior to treatment and at [ADDRESS_1156681]-
treatment at week 12 (SVR). 
 
Monitoring of HCV Therapy in the US  
As discussed above, HCV treatment guidance is provided by [CONTACT_178547]/IDSA Panel and updated frequently on www.HCVguidelines.org . The US Panel recommends 
evaluation of the patients prior to and during HCV treatment with oral DAA regimens.  Specifically, the US Panel recommends visits or telephone contact [CONTACT_832983] 
(AEs) and potential drug- drug interactions with newly prescribed medications. After 4 
weeks of treatment, laboratory assessment including CBC, creatinine level, calculated 
 22 A5360

GFR, and hepatic function panel are recommended with additional testing as clinically 
indicated. Quantit ative HCV viral load testing is r ecommended after 4 weeks of therapy 
and at 12 weeks following completion of therapy.  If HCV RNA is detectable at week 4 of 
treatment, repeat quantitative HCV RNA viral load testing is recommended after 2 
additional weeks of treatment (i.e. , wee k 6). If quantitative HCV viral -load has increased 
by [CONTACT_7809] 10- fold (>1 log10 IU/mL) on repeat testing at week 6 (or thereafter), then 
discontinuation of HCV treatment is recommended. In the US, the standard clinical practice is to evaluate patients taking HCV DAA therapy every [ADDRESS_1156682] with 
their pharmacy every 4 weeks during treatment , and HCV RNA monitoring after 4 weeks 
of treatment is often required to meet criteria for ongoing treatment.  
 
Sofosbuvir/velpatasv ir (SOF/VEL ): A Novel Pan- genotypic FDC R egimen  
SOF is an oral, nucleotide analogue inhibitor of HCV NS5B polymerase with 
demonstrated, potent antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo against HCV GT 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
and 6 (pan- genotypic)  [13, 14, 15]. SOF was  approved by [CONTACT_48354] (FDA) in October 2013 and is widely available across the world, including 
as a generic agent manufactured in India which has the license to distribute SOF in 102 
countries . Velpatasvir  (VEL)  is an oral, second generation inhibitor of HCV NS5A with 
demonstrated potent antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo against HCV GT 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
and 6 ( pan-genotypic). VEL was  evaluated with SOF as a FDC  tablet (SOF 400 mg/VEL 
100mg) taken by [CONTACT_96488] 12 weeks in four clinical trials (ASTRAL -1, 2, 3, 
and 5) , which included participants with HCV GT 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 with HIV -1 co-
infection (ASTRAL -5) [16] and among HCV mono- infection (ASTRAL 1, 2, 3) [17, 18] 
with and without compensated cirrhosis. The regimen evaluated was interferon- and 
RBV-free. Of note, ASTRAL- 4 tested SOF/VEL in participants  with decompensated 
cirrhosis (Child -Turcotte- Pugh classification B, [CTP B ]); patients with CTP B or C are 
excluded from the present study  [19]. Overall, the efficacy of SOF/VEL was high with 
SVR observed in 95- 99% of participants ( Table 2.1-3 ). In ASTRAL 1, 2, and 3, no HCV 
relapse was observed between the post -treatment week 12 ( SVR) and post -treatment 
week 24 (SVR 24), which is consistent with HCV eradication or cure. In the ASTRAL- 1 
(HCV GT 1, 2, 4, 5, 6) study, SOF/VEL was compared to placebo tablets (delayed 
treatment group) in a double- blind manner. Importantly, no difference in safety and 
tolerability was observed between SOF/VEL and placebo, with respect to the quantity 
and quality of reported AEs and observed laboratory abnormalities . In the ASTRAL -2 
(HCV GT 2) and ASTRAL -3 (HCV GT 3) studies, SOF/VEL was compared to SOF + 
RBV in randomized controlled trials. SOF/VEL was superior to SOF + RBV with respect 
to SVR (efficacy) as well as safety and tolerability.  In ASTRAL -5, two patients were 
incarcerated and hence did not have access to study drug while in prison, which resulted 
in failure to achieve SVR. In pooled analyses  of data of participants  from ASTRAL 1,  2 
and 3, the overall efficacy was estimated to 98%.  Epclusa (fixed dose single tablet 
regimen  of SOF/VEL) was approved by [CONTACT_832984] 28, 2016. A marketing 
application for SOF/VEL has also been approv ed by [CONTACT_3558]

clinic visits with  or without laboratory testing , and adherence counseling were performed 
at baseline, weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10  and 12. Such an intense followup schedule is difficult to 
implement in the real world . However, it is encouraging that the monitoring practices 
current ly followed as listed in Table 2.1-2 (above) for the delivery of other agents such 
as SOF/LDV in real-world  cohorts , such as the  HCV TARGET  [20] and TRIO [21] 
cohort , have resulted in SVR rates that are comparable to what were observed in the 
ION clinical trials of SOF/LDV.  Therefore, it  is likely that real -world SVR rates of 
SOF/VEL , with standard monitoring practices currently being used , will reflect what was 
observed in the ASTRAL trials.

Reinfection, Relapse, Cure 
Optimism for the eradication of HCV has been largely driven by [CONTACT_832985] a relatively short duration of time using agents tha t are safe and well 
tolerated. HCV c ure, in the DAA era,  is defined as the absence of HCV RNA in a 
quantitative PCR assay 12 weeks after the completion of treatment. However, it is important to note that HCV treatment induced cure is not associated with immunity to 
new HCV infection following exposure in the future.  There are two important caveats that 
need to be considered in the management of HCV namely, relapse and reinfection. A

small proportion of patients remain free of HCV at the end of treatment but exhibit HCV 
viremia at a time point thereaf ter (SVR or later) —this scenario could be attributable 
either to relapse or re- infection. HCV sequencing is required to distinguish one from the 
other. If the sequence of the virus observed is genetically identical to the sequence that was observed at baseline, the person is considered to have relapsed. However, if  the 
sequence observed post SVR is unrelated to the sequence observed at baseline, the 
individual is considered to have been re -infected. In the pooled ASTRAL studies data 
which comprised particip ants from ASTRAL 1,  2, and 3 (n=1035), there were 12 
relapses and 1 reinfection [16 , 17, 18, 19; see summary here-

and-velpatasvir -vel-gs5816- for-the-treatment -of-all-six-hepatitis -c-genotypes . In recent 
data presented from Australia and New Zealand [22, 23] , re-infection was observed in 5 
out of 54 participants (Incidence of re -infection: 8.88 per 100 p- y) who had undetectable 
HCV RNA at EOT —active  injection drug use was the strongest predictor of re- infection.  
Data on relapse and re -infection f rom settings in LMICs such as the study sites included 
in this study trial are lacking.   
 
Access to and Use of Mobile Phones and Text Messaging Among Non- US Sites  
Mobile phones and associated social media and messaging services are widely 
available in the participating countries. For example, in Brazil, WhatsApp  is commonly 
used to contact [CONTACT_832986]. In India, text messaging servi ces are used to remind participants of clinic visits. 
 
2.2 Rationale 
 
The MINMON strategy that is being proposed to evaluate in this study includes the 
following components:  
 
a) No pre- treatment genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
b) Entire treatment course (84 tablets) given to participant  at baseline 
c) No scheduled on- treatment clinic visits  
d) No scheduled on- treatment monitoring 
e) Remote contact [CONTACT_832987] w eek 4 (adherence counseling and locator 
update) and week 22 (scheduling of SVR visit  and locator update) 
 The rationale for each of these components are listed below:  
 No pre- treatment genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: The availability of pan- genotypic HCV treatment regimens 
preclude the need for HCV genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Prior to SOF/DAC and SOF/VEL, genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_832936]/or treatment duration. However, SOF/VEL has demonstrated high levels of efficacy across genotypes 1- 6 and is approved by [CONTACT_832988] 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. The generic version of the fixed dose single- tablet regimen of SOF/VEL was recently approved for production 
by [CONTACT_832989] 102 additional countries. SOF/VEL is also being utilized as the primary treatment regimen in at least two countries with ongoing robust HCV elimination programs, Iceland and Georgia.  
 25 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/18  
 
Entire treatment course (84 tablets) given to participant  at baseline and no on- treatment 
planned clinic visits:  Most HCV treatment programs require patients to come in for refills 
on a 4 -weekly basis and in some cases, every  2 weeks (e .g., Chennai, India). These 
visits could take considerable amount of time when accounting for travel and waiting 
time at the facility resulting in loss of wages. In the US, ensuring insurance papers are in 
place poses an additional burden to the patient. During these visits, patients are 
essentially provided with the next 2 - or 4-week supply, a physician consult and a lab 
draw for HCV RNA monitoring and/or safety labs. Given the safety and efficacy profile of 
SOF/VEL, it is possible that providing patients with the entire 12- week supply  of HCV 
treatment at initiation and not requiring any in- person follow -up could result in similar 
SVR rates as observed in the ASTRAL trials or real -world HCV cohorts such as 
TARGET and TRIO. Many HIV clinics globally provide ART  for 3- [ADDRESS_1156684] wages and dramatically decrease costs even in countries such 
as the US where manpower (physician/nurse/pharmacist) costs are significantly higher 
than in other settings. Further, the reduction in the number of clinic visits could 
potentially allow the clinic to deliver care to more patients with the same manpower. The 
provision of the entire 12 -week supply at initiation could also improve adherence and 
consequently, outcomes in populations who are at risk for HCV infection and travel 
frequently (e .g., truck drivers).  
 No scheduled on- treatment monitoring : In the ASTRAL- 1 trial the safety profile of 
SOF/VEL was comparable to that of the placebo arm —this raises the question of the 
necessity of on -treatment safety monitoring in a large majority of the patients. Further, 
given the relatively  short treatment duration (12 weeks) and absence of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_74283], the role of on -treatment HCV RNA monitoring is also debatable. HCV RNA 
testing is currently recommended and usually ordered at on -treatment week 4 and EOT 
(in some settings) t o assess adherence and to detect on- therapy virologic breakthrough. 
Virologic breakthrough is rare with SOF/VEL and has been generally linked to very poor adherence. In a pooled analysis of data from the ASTRAL trials on- treatment HCV RNA 
was not shown to be predictive of treatment response. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the HCV treatment course would be modified by [CONTACT_832990] -treatment RNA 
quantification. This is an important issue in LMIC settings where access to HCV RNA 
quantification is limited (and expensive where available) and the reduction in the number of these tests from treatment protocols is expected to greatly improve access. Therefore, 
the study team  proposes no planned on -treatment safety or HCV RNA monitoring. Of 
importance, participants  with decompensated cirrhosis and chronic HBV infection 
(HBsAg positive)  will be excluded from the study  as these participants  will not be eligible 
for a MINMON strategy ; it is equally important to note that these groups probably 
account for <20%  of persons chronically -infected with HCV globally.  
 
Remote contact [CONTACT_832974] 4 (adherence counseling and locator update) 
and week 22 (scheduling of SVR visit  and locator update):  In the real world, programs 
are measured by [CONTACT_832991]. For example, in 
HIV, viral suppression is the gold standard to assess program effectiveness. Similarly, for HCV, proportion of patients achieving SVR is the gold standard for the assessment of 
 26 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/18  
 
treatment programs. There are two critical components to achieving SVR: (1) Treatment 
persistence (taking an adequate duration of therapy) and adherence (taking daily 
SOF/VEL); and (2) confirmation of HCV eradication (SVR) at least 12 weeks after 
completing treatment. In the US, approximately 20% of patients who complete treatment 
do not return for SVR assessment in a timely manner. In global HCV programs, such as 
the free HCV program in Punjab, India, program staff are currently facing challenges 
bringing patients back in for the SVR assessment visit and are using different strategies 
to track patients.  
 According to the AASLD/IDSA guidelines  [5, 9], the recommended approach to 
encourage treatment persistence/adherence and confirmation of SVR is pharmacist and/or clinicians contact [CONTACT_832992] [ADDRESS_1156685] questions or concerns about the study medication. 
Responses will be standardized based on reasons for non -adherence: e.g., forgot,  side 
effects, chose not to take, lost study medication , or decided to stop. Standardizing 
responses will ensure that participants receive the same type of support regardless o f 
the mechanism used (i.e. , phone, text, WhatsApp, etc. ) This simple and inexpensive 
remote contact [CONTACT_832993], as it may be possible for programs to estimate outcomes of participants who do not return for SVR assessment using week [ADDRESS_1156686]-to-follow -up (LTFU ) and measure SVR in as many 
participants as possible to validate the MINMON strategy. Any participant who does not return for the SVR visit will be considered a failure even if the true outcome was HCV 
cure with SOF/VEL. In light of the importance of determining the SVR outcome of the  
 27 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/[ADDRESS_1156687], HCV care could be rolled out of primary health care 
centers where routine blood work is available—at baseline, one would need to perform a complete blood panel, hepatic function panel and a renal panel to stage liver disease. 
Point -of-care HCV antibody tests are already available. If the individual is a 
decompensated cirrhotic, he/she could be referred to a tertiary care center. If not, 
treatment could be initiated following HCV RNA quantification. The availability of t he 
GeneXpert cartridges for quantification of HCV RNA [24] has the potential to transform 
any center with electricity and an individual with high- school level of education to 
perform HCV RNA quantification. There are approximately four to five times the number  
of people living with HCV globally compared to HIV —to ensure that treatment reaches 
them all and to truly have a shot at eradication of HCV, it is critical to improve access 
while reducing cost and associated treatment complexities.    
 
However, what is being p roposed is novel but high- risk and has never been pi[INVESTIGATOR_832937]. It is possible that adherence and treatment completion rates , if 
the entire treatment supply is provided upfront with no health care contact [CONTACT_832994], could be inferior to the SOC . This single -arm 
study,  open to US and non- US sites, will enroll 400 participants , all of who m will be 
followed using the MINMON protocol only . The rationale for limiting  enrollment  of HIV-
coinfected participants to <50% is to ensure the findings of this trial are generalizable to 
all HCV infected persons. Given that this trial will be recruiting from ACTG sites that are 
primarily HIV clinics, it is highly possible that there may be an overrepresentation of HIV-
infected persons.  
 The rationale for limiting enrollment of cirrhotics  to <20%  is also to ensure that the 
sample is representative of all HCV- infected persons globally. Since this study seeks to 
evaluate a low -cost treatment delivery strategy aimed at promoting the elimination 
agenda, the primary target population will be the >90% of the HCV -infected persons who 
are unaware of their status —it is likely the >80% of these individuals will be non- cirrhotic. 
Cirrhotic individuals are more likely to engage in care with more frequent clinic visits and 
consequently, more likely to be recruited into the study.  
 
Further, the findings from this study will inform the need for a future randomized clinical 
trial (RCT) that will compare the MINMON approach versus  SOC. If the findings from this 
trial conclusively indicate that the MINMON approach achieves high SVR (>96%) that is  
comparable to what is observed in routine clinical s ettings, a RCT  will not be needed as 
a high benchmark for SVR will be met. Conversely , if findings from this study  
conclusively indicate that the MINMON approach is inferior (evidence than SVR is <95%), an RCT will not be needed as a low benchmark for SVR will have been met and the characteristics of the MINMON approach will need to be reconsidered.  Finally, if 
 28 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/18  
 
neither a high nor low benchmarks is met (ie, observed SVR 93- 97%), this study will 
inform the design and sample size of a potential future RCT comparing the MINMON 
approach to SOC.  
 
Plan for E nrollment of Subpopulations  
There are no exclusion criteria related to gender or race. The FDC of SOF/VEL  was not 
associated with adverse developmental outcomes in animal studies. However, this combination has not been studied extensively in pregnant women [EPCL[LOCATION_003] pac kage 
insert, 2016]. Therefore, we will exclude pregnant women and women of reproductive potential who are unwilling to use contraceptives while on study treatment.   
 
3.0 STUDY DESIGN  
 
This study will enroll 4 00 participants who will be followed using a MIN MON protocol f or 
a duration of 24 weeks in order to obtain primary outcome information regarding SVR 
status , as well as additional information for secondary objectives over the longer 
duration of 72 weeks. The MINMON strategy is comprised of: 1) minimal pre-treatment 
assessment including confirmation of viremia by [CONTACT_832995]-invasive parameters (ALT, AST, and platelet count  
[and bilirubin, albumin, and INR in persons with evidence of cirrhosis by [CONTACT_126453]-4]) and no 
genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007] ; 2) distribution of complete HCV treatment course at study initiation  (i.e., 84 
days of SOF/VEL); 3) no planned on- treatment laboratory monitoring; 4) no planned 
clinic or pharmacy visits  prior to SVR evaluation; and 5) remote con tact at treat ment 
week [ADDRESS_1156688] -treatment at week 22 to update locator information and to facilitate 
attendance at the SVR evaluation visit (week s 22 to 28). The week [ADDRESS_1156689] ion, with or without HIV -1 
co-infection, and if cirrhotic, will be classified as compensated cirrhotics based on CTP 
score. All participants will receive study -provided treatment (FDC of SOF/VEL)  for a 
duration of [ADDRESS_1156690] data and 
outcomes gathered from this study.  
 At entry  (Step 1) , all participants will receive the entire study -provided treatment supply , 
following study entry procedures, with the first dose being observed by [CONTACT_464] . The 
next planned study visit is the key primary outcome evaluation for SVR, scheduled at 
week 24. There will be no planned interim in- person study  visits with participants 
between entry  and week 24.  Detailed locator information will be collected at entry  (see 
section 6.3.21). In lieu of resource intensive in- person study visits, between entry and 
 29 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/[ADDRESS_1156691] participants at 
weeks 4 and 22, via a remote mechanism based upon the participant’s  choic e and 
availability, in order to assess adherence status  at week 4 and to schedule the SVR 
evaluation visit at week 24, as well as update the locator information. At week 4, t he 
participant will be asked if he/she is  taking the study medication and about adherence , 
changes in contact [CONTACT_3031], and reminders for the study visit for SVR evaluation. If 
participants report sub- optimal adherence or that they are not taking their HCV 
medication, they will be read (if a phone contact) or message  (if remote con tact is via 
email/text message/WhatsApp) a standard script highlighting the benefits of HCV 
therapy and the importance of adherence.  They will also be asked about reasons for 
their non -adherence and then receive standardized encouragement and clarification 
about the medication and importance of adherence. There will be no further site-initiated 
interaction with the participant  until week 22, at which time participants will be queried 
about any changes to their contact [CONTACT_832996] o f their 
upcoming SVR visit. These contacts are designed to help keep participants engaged 
with the study and keep their contact [CONTACT_832997]- evaluation of SVR. Resource utilization, including staff time 
(both for remote contact [CONTACT_832998]) and any associated 
laboratory or other tests ordered during unplanned clinic visits (e.g. , Magnetic 
Resonance Imaging [MRI], ultrasonogram, blood tests) will be documented, tr anslated to 
costs using reimbursement rates from WHO CHOICE and the U.S. Center For Medicare and Medicaid Services, and incorporated into the cost analysis.   
 Following the SVR evaluation visit, which is expected to be at week 24, all participants  
will en ter Step [ADDRESS_1156692] -SVR evaluation study visits at weeks 
48 and 72. At each of these Step 2 study visits, a blood sample will be drawn and liver disease will be staged in all participants using FIB -4 (and calculated CTP if cirrhoti c), 
and where available, liver elastogr aphy , in addition to the  Model for End- Stage Liver 
Disease (MELD) score. Participants who have SVR evaluation after week [ADDRESS_1156693]-SVR 
evaluation visits will be dependent on the week of Step  2 entry. Step 2 will end at week 
72, from the time of study entry, independent of the time of Step 2 entry (for example, a 
participant who undergoes SVR evaluation at week [ADDRESS_1156694] visit 
at week 68 and a final visit at week 72).

4.6 Co-enrollment Guidelines   
 
US sites are encouraged to co- enroll participant s in A5128, “P lan for Obtaining  Informed 
Consent  to Use S tored  Human B iological M aterials  (HBM) for Currently  Unspecified 
Analyses .” Co-enrollment in A5128 does not require permission from the A5360 protocol 
chairs.  
 
Non-US sites are encouraged to co- enroll participants in A5243, “Plan for Obtaining 
Human Biological Samples at Non- U.S. Clinical Research Sites for Currently 
Unspecified Genetic Analyses.”  Co-enrollment in  A5243 does not require permission 
from the A5360  protocol chairs.  
 
For specific questions  and approval  for co -enrollment in other studies,  sites should first 
check the PSWP or  contact [CONTACT_833002].  
 
If there are concerns about exceeding volume limits for blood draws, please note that A5128 and A5243 allow participants to consent to the study without allowing a blood sample to be collected. In these cases, if a future study wants to evaluate a participant’s 
DNA sometime later, sites would be able to access a stored aliquot from the initial study 
(if there are any available). It is also possible for a participant to enroll into A5128 or 
A5243 and postpone the required blood draw until a later time. For more input, contact 
[CONTACT_941] A5128 or A5243 teams.

Participants are expected to begin treatment with SOF/VEL within [ADDRESS_1156720] dose of SOF/VEL 
will be provided to the participant and observed by [CONTACT_464].   
 
6.2.[ADDRESS_1156721]-Treatment Evaluations   
Step 1: Following treatment completion at week 12 , participants  will undergo 
evaluations as outlined in the SOE 6.1-1. 
 NOTE : If the participant comes in for the week 24 visit during the -14 days 
window (i.e. , week 22), then the week 22 remote call is not needed.  
 
Week 24/ SVR Evaluation Visit 
The week 24  visit (visit window: week 22 -28) is ideally the visit where SVR 
should be assessed for all participants , and subsequently  they will be registered 
to Step 2. However, if a participant misses the visit window (>week 28), the week 
24 visit will be considered a misse d visit and he/she will need to be schedule d for 
an SVR visit prior to being registered to Step 2 of the study. The SVR visit can 
 43 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/[ADDRESS_1156722] at any time  point after week 28  and up to  week 72 and is mandat ory 
for the participant to be registered to Step 2.  
 
NOTE: Participants will be reminded of t he week 24/ SVR visit during the rem ote 
contact (at weeks 4 and 22), and participants only need to complete either the week 24 OR the SVR evaluation visit; they will not be required to complete both. 
If a p articipant completes week 24, his/her next visit will be at week 48  on Step 2. 
If a participant misses the week 24 visit and returns to the clinic for the SVR visit either at week 48 or 72, then only the SVR evaluations will be performed at that 
visit time  point.  Evaluations for week s 48 or 72 will be performed at the next 
scheduled study visit. However,  if a participant completes their SVR visit at w eek 
72, this visit will be  the partic ipants’ last study visit and they  will not enter Step 2.  
 
Step 2 Registration  
Following completion of the SVR evaluation on Step 1 (Week 24 OR SVR visit) , 
participants will be registered to Step 2 on that same day . Participants will 
undergo evaluations as outlined in the SOE 6.1 -2, within the +28-days visit 
window, as appropriate for the visit.  
 
NOTE: Participants who register into Step [ADDRESS_1156723] ete week 72 (final study visit).  
 
6.2.5  Study Completion Evaluations  
 
For Step 2, week 72 ±28-days will be the final study visit for all participants, 
independent of the entry week for Step 2.  
 For participants who do not enter Step 2, the final study visit will be the last visit 
they had on Step 1, regardless of when that occurred.  
 
6.2.6 Event -Driven Evaluations  
 
Step 1: Unplanned Study Visits  
Unplanned study visits should not occur after week 22 on Step 1.  
 The purpose of unplanned visits, should they occur, is to address common 
toxicities. Participants will be provided with a telephone number that they can call 
if they are having any problems (e .g., headache, fever, nausea, etc.) during the 
study treatment period (day 0 through week 12). Participants will be connected to 
the study staff who will talk to them and try to resolve the issue over the phone, 
whenever possible. Only if the study staff feels further investigations are required 
to resolve the complaint, an unplanned study visit should be scheduled within 5 
days with the participant so that additional investigations, as deemed appropriate 
by [CONTACT_5984], may be performed. It is possible no tests are ordered or tests not included in the SOE are ordered; however, while the protocol does not 
 44 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/[ADDRESS_1156724] is ordered ( e.g., safety labs ), a plasma specimen should be stored.  
  
NOTE: If any laboratory, radiology , or other tests are ordered, they should be 
justified by [CONTACT_518515]. Labs drawn for safety purposes are permitted. Any tests ordered are not meant to serve as an early indicator of a participant’s HCV 
treatment response. The performance of HCV RNA testing at unplanned study 
visits is strongly discouraged  and should be discussed with the core team . The 
purpose of these unplanned visits, should they occur, is to deal with common 
toxicities.    
 If a participant provides information about study treatment disposition, use (or 
change in use) of reportable concomitant medications, or gives information about reportable adverse events (e .g., AEs leading to change in study treatment 
regardless of severity grade)  at this unplanned study visit, then this information 
should be captured on the appropriate eCRFs.   
 
Participants who become pregnant while on study medications or up to week [ADDRESS_1156725] the site to schedule an unplanned study visit (see section 8.3 for 
details ).

6.3.3  Calculated FIBROSIS -4 (FIB -4) Score 
 
Calculated FIB -4 score is needed to determine cirrhosis status for all participants, 
as per the SOE , in order to evaluate other outcomes such as regression of liver 
disease.  
 This calculatio n requires the following data: Participant age (years), serum 
alanine and aspartate aminotransferase level (U/L), and platelet count (10
9/L). 
 
Please refer to the A5360 PSWP  for the website link t o calculate the FIB- 4 score .

The MELD score measures the  mortality risk in participants  with end- stage liver 
disease. It is used as a disease severity index to help prioritize allocation of 
organs for transplant. In order to calculate the MELD score,  total bilirubin  (mg/dl), 
sodium  (mEg/L) , INR , and serum creatinine (mg/dl)  values are needed.  
 
Please refer to the A5360 PSWP  for the website link t o calculate the MELD 
score.

Screening HIV- [ADDRESS_1156736] achieved SVR will be collected at weeks 48 and 72 and tested for the 
presence of H CV RNA .  
 HCV RNA samples on study will be processed and shipped to the designated A5360 VSL for real -time quantitative HCV RNA analysis.  
 
6.3.14 Stored Plasma/ PBMCs /Serum  
 
Stored plasma, PBMCs, and serum will be collected at the indicated visits for future HCV/HIV studies and shipped according to the A5360 Laboratory  
Processing Chart (LPC).  Stored specimens will be used after study completion 
for HCV genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/sequencing t o assess re -infection versus relapse a nd 
estimate SVR by [CONTACT_7631].  
 Further, the NS5A and NS5B regions of HCV will be sequenced for the earliest 
sample where HCV RNA is detected post -SVR and the corresponding entry 
sample will also be sequenced. Sequence data will assist in discriminating between reinfection (entry and post -SVR sequences are not related) versus 
relapse (entry and post -SVR sequences are identical). Incidence of reinfection

assessments, participants will be asked to estimate their adherence using Likert -
type ques tions (all, most, half, some, or none). At the SVR visit, participants will 
also be asked to indicate the percentage of study medication that they actually 
took on a visual analog scale. At the week [ADDRESS_1156738] assessment and 
week 24/SVR evaluation visit, participants who report less than perfect adherence will be asked about barriers to adherence.  
 
Health Outcomes Questionnaire (EQ-5D) 
The EQ -5D is a validated instrument used to collect data abou t quality of life 
(http://www.euroqol.org) . The instrument asks questions and each has three 
possible responses (EQ5D- 3L version). The instrument asks respondents to 
comment on their degree of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, 
and anx iety/depression, and then ask participants to record their current health-
related quality of life state using a vertical visual analogue scale (0 -100 range) . 
The instrument has been translated into a variety of languages and is available as a paper form, a  computer -based form, a tablet/cell phone form, or as an 
interview .  
 Responses must be recorded on an eCRF from the entry visit and week 24 /SVR 
evaluation, and weeks [ADDRESS_1156739] 4 weeks including: 1) nights spent in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33798], 2) visits to an emergency department, and 3) visits to a doctor’s office. This questionnaire

 Data that will be captured from the participant during the week [ADDRESS_1156744] 
is whether the participant is taking study medication ( i.e., adherence), in the prior 
4 weeks. All participants will receive an individually tailored message, based on their adherence, which will be read or written to them in order to promote and/or 
encourage adherence through the end of treatment. The message  will highlight 
the benefit of treatment for HCV and the importance of adherence and will be 
tailored to  each participant’s response as to how well he/she is  adhering to the 
HCV treatment regimen. Additionally, at both weeks 4 and 22, locator information 
will be updated (if anything has changed) and participants will be reminded to 
return for their SVR evaluation visit. Sites will be allowed to contact [CONTACT_833018]’s responses on adherence and to update his/her locator information 
using any of the options listed above, namely phone call, text message, email, or

7.0 ADVERSE EVENTS AND STUDY MONITORING  
 7.1 Definition of Adverse Events  
 An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), sympt om, or diagnosis that occurs in a study participant during the conduct of 
the study  REGARDLESS of the attribution (i .e., relationship of event to medical 
treatment/study product/device or procedure/intervention). This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from the baseline condition.

8.0 CLINICAL MANAGEMENT  ISSUES 
 8.1 Toxicity  
 
Criteria for participant management, dose interruptions, dose adjustments and 
discontinuation, or changes in treatment will be described only for toxicities attributable to study drugs  (SOF/VEL) . The grading system for drug toxicities is located in the DAIDS 
AE Grading Table (see section 7.2).   
 
NOTE:  The team must be notified via e- mail within 72 hours regarding toxicities that 
result in a change in study regimen ( [EMAIL_15839]).  
 57 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/[ADDRESS_1156750] 
experienced during the prior 24 weeks, particularly while on study medication, will be collected.  
 
8.2 Management of Side Effects of SOF/VEL  
 
There are no signature [CONTACT_833051]/VEL. If an SAE occurs, the 
site investigator has the option to discontinue  study treatment. However, prior to the 
discontinuation of study drugs, the study core team should be contact[CONTACT_19904] ([EMAIL_15839] ).  
 
Participants  who meet any of the following laboratory criteria should stop treatment with 
SOF/VEL:  
• Confirmed elevation of ALT and/or AST >5 x entry values measured while on study 
treatment measured at unplanned study visits.  
• Confirmed direct  bilirubin [ADDRESS_1156751] and >2.0 mg/dL  
• Any Grade 3 or greater rash associated with constitutional symptoms assessed as related to treatment with SOF/VEL.  
• Any Grade 4 event assessed as related to treatment with SOF/VEL 
 
Dose modification of SOF/VEL will not be allowed in the s tudy. If SOF/VEL is 
discontinued for toxicity reasons, it should not be restarted.  
 
NOTE: Grades 1 and 2 AEs associated with SOF/VEL require no change in study 
treatment.  
 
8.3 Pregnancy   
 
Pregnancy will result in immediate discontinuation of the study medication  and initiation 
of counseling regarding the lack of information on safety of SOF/VEL in pregnancy.  
Participants who become pregnant  while on study should contact [CONTACT_833021] (only up to week 2 2) and will be followed on study/off -treatment 
until study completion. A visit following the end of pregnancy will be conducted for 
evidence of AEs in the participant, and an outcome eCRF will be completed. Male 
participants whose partners become pregnant will continue treatment as outlined in the SOE.  
 If a female participant has completed the study or chooses to discontinue from the study before the end of the pregnancy, site staff should request permission to contact [CONTACT_305709]. If the information is obtained, 
pregnancy outcomes will be submitted on an eCRF at the end of the pregnancy.

10.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
 
10.1 General Design Issues  
 
This is a single -arm study of 400 participants, to evaluate the feasibility, safety , and 
efficacy of a  MINMON  strategy  of delivering interferon and RBV-free, pan- genotypic 
DAA therapy to qualifying persons with active HCV . The outcomes of this study may be 
used to inform the feasibility and utility of a future randomized controlled trial including a 
study arm with the MINMON strategy . Because this study includes only one arm, there is 
no blinding of any study intervention component.

10.4 Sample Size and Accrual  
 
The sample siz e for this single- arm study is 400 participants.  
 
This sample size was chosen for benchmark properties listed below regarding the use of 
efficacy data from this study to informing the utility and feasibility of future studies of the MINMON approach, and the precision (based on CI width) about SVR efficacy outcome 
estimates.  
 
Table 10.4-1
 below describes SVR benchmarks and their properties.  
 The high benchmark is defined as when the lower confidence limit of the 2 -sided 95% CI 
about the SVR estimate is strictly greater than 96%. Observing 392 or more SVR
 
responders out of 400 participants (i.e. , ≥98% SVR responders) would meet this 
benchmark. Under a true SVR rate of 97%, there is only a small probability (0.15) of 
observing this benchmark with the study sample size of 400. However, as the true SVR 
rate becomes higher, the probability of observing this benchmark also increases (while 
holding the sample size at 400 participants). For instance, if the true SVR rate were 
98.5%, then there is 0.[ADDRESS_1156756] may 
not be needed, as the high benchmark implies that the SVR for the MINMON strategy exceeds 96%.  
 
 61 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/18  
 
The low benchmark is defined as when the upper confidence limit of the 2- sided 95% CI 
about the SVR estimate is strictly less than 95%. Observing 371 or fewer SVR 
responders out of 400 participants (i.e. , ≤92.8 % SVR responders) would meet this 
benchmark. Properties of possible scenarios are given in Table 10.4-1. 
 
If neither the high nor low benchmark is met, a future RCT of the MINMON approach 
versus SOC  may be desired, and efficacy estimates from this study could be used to 
inform the design and sample size of that study.  
The low and high SVR benchmarks described above and in Table 10.4 -1 below were 
chosen to represent what is currently thought to be reasonable SVR rates based on 
studies presented and published, including clinical trials, as well as studies reporting use 
of this DAA regimen outside the context of a clinical trial.  
 
Properties of this study’s sample size regarding probability of not observing either 
benchmark  
Table 10.4-2 below summarizes the various probabilities that neither of the benchmarks 
(HIGH or LOW, as described above), are observed under a range of various true rates of 
SVR.

Assuming uniform accrual of [ADDRESS_1156760] annually by [CONTACT_163411] -appointed 
SMC (via the standing committee for the Hepatitis TSG). The first interim review 
will occur no more than one year after the enrollment of the first study participant 
or 6 months after 25% of the study sample (100 participants)  have completed 12 
weeks on study, whichever occurs earlier.  
 A planned interim review for efficacy will be performed when SVR outcomes are 
available for approximately 100 participants, but could occur earlier (under case of a faster than anticipated accrual rate). The team wishes that an interim look at 
efficacy occur while the study is still accruing, so that if SVR rate is unacceptably low (i .e., futility), that there is still an opportunity to intervene before accrual to the 
study is completed.   
 For instance, assuming uniform accrual of 25 participants per month and SVR 
evaluation happening 24 weeks following study entry, the planned interim review for efficacy would occur around month 12 since study accrual commenced, with approximately 300 participants accrued, 100 participants with SVR outcome 
available, and 100 participants remaining to be accrued. Assuming the slower but 
increasing accrual rate over time  and same timing of SVR evaluation, the 
planned interim review for efficacy would occur approximately 17 months following study opening, with approximately 265 participants accrued, 105 participants with SVR outcome, and 135 participants remaining to be accrued.  
 Consideration would be given to closer monitoring or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_832939] 95% or higher 
(i.e., upper confidence bound on a 1- sided 99.9% CI is lower than 95%). With 
100 participants, this boundary would be met if the observed SVR rate were 86% or lower (which corresponds to 14 or more SVR non- responders out of 100). For 
additional information, SVR estimates will be provided separately for subgroups 
defined by [CONTACT_833025] (ie , US versus non- US). 
 However, if the SMC sees early benefit of the MINMON intervention, the team 
intends the study to proceed with full accrual and follow -up in order to confirm 
early evidence, and gain precision on the efficacy outcome estimate and other 
 64 A5360

outcomes. At interim reviews, SVR will be calculated only among those with potential to contribute to SVR (by [CONTACT_471134] 22 weeks elapsed since study entry). Imputation of missing SVR evaluation as non- SVR response will only 
occur for participants for whom more than 76 weeks since study enrollment has elapsed. In other words, early study discontinuations prior to week 22 will not be 
counted in SVR estimation at interim review, as these could bias the estimation 
of SVR towards futility. Instead, these early study discontinuations prior to week 22 (before available for SVR evaluation), and others missing SVR evaluation, will 
contribute to the interim monitoring trigger below.  
 If the analysis sample for the initial planned review for efficacy as outlined above 
includes fewer than 40% participants from non -US clinical rese arch sites, then a 
second planned review of efficacy will be triggered when SVR outcomes are available on approximately 230 participants (with the upper limit of US participants of 132, this estimates at least 40% non- US representation in the 
second effica cy look interim analysis sample). The same analysis plan and 
monitoring bounds as defined in the first look above would be applied to this 
second look at SVR.  
 
An unplanned interim review will be triggered if, at any time, more than 20 
persons are not evaluable for the SVR outcome before study discontinuation or 
76 weeks following study enrollment. Another trigger for an unplanned interim 
review is if, at any time, the number of participants experiencing an SAE exceeds 
5% of the interim analysis dataset , and the absolute number of participants with 
SAEs at least 10 (as 5% was the observed upper bound of the 95% CI on 
number of participants with any SAE from the ASTRAL- 5 trial).   
 Any/all SMC reviews will include administrative/ trial conduct data as well as  
safety data according to the safety -related outcomes enumerated above.  
 The following routine monitoring reports are distributed to core team and are 
detailed in the study monitoring plan (SMP): screening, accrual, data 
delinquency, study status, data and  sample completeness, with attention to 
evaluation and timing of SVR outcome. The routine safety monitoring report is 
distributed to the DAIDS Clinical Representative and a subset of the core team 
(to include the study chairs) every 3 months.  
 Further details about monitoring of this study are available in the SMP.  
 
10.6 Analyses  
 
Due to US federally mandated reporting of outcomes to clinicaltrials.gov, the timing of initiating 
analyses for those outcomes, are likely to occur prior to study follow -up being completed. 
Therefore, there will be separate primary and secondary statistical analyses reports to cover all the analyses listed below.

10.6.1  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
 
The primary efficacy outcome (SVR) will be estimated with a point -wise estimate 
as well as a 95%, two- sided CI. The confidence bound will be calculated with 
binomial distribution according to the method of Wilson (Score based interval). 
The impact of missingness contributing to the (lowering of the) SVR  response 
rate will be  addressed by [CONTACT_833026] -SVR (e .g., 
discontinued treatment early due to various reasons including intolerability, HCV RNA > LLOQ, missing evaluation for SVR (and reasons as known), and the 
number of participants meeting each reas on for non -SVR.  
 
10.6.2  Primary Safety Analysis  
 
The primary safety outcome of SAEs will be enumerated, summarized and described for all qualifying outcomes. The number and relative frequency of 
participants experiencing one or more SAEs will also be summarized, and a CI 
about the probability of experiencing a SAE will be calculated (using CI methods 
as described above).   
 
10.6.[ADDRESS_1156761] prior to SVR evaluation, or at an unplanned visit or by [CONTACT_833027] 24 or SVR evaluation visit (whichever occurs first). Those participants missing information from all  these mechanisms 
will be assumed to have prematurely discontinued. The proportion of premature study treatment discontinuation will be estimated and a CI calculated to 
summarize the range of plausible values using methods parallel to other 
dichotomous outcomes described above.  
 
Non-serious AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_833028] (M eDDRA) System Organ Class by [CONTACT_833029] 7.2.  
 
Those who do not achieve SVR with an observed HCV RNA >LLOQ will have 
both baseline and SVR specimens tested for HCV RASs. Participants in this sub-
set with HCV RASs present in their SVR specimen that were not present in their 
baseline specimen will be enumerated along with the relative frequencies of new 
RASs. A description of the observed RASs will also be provided.   
 Among SVR responders, HCV RNA post SVR follow -up (i.e., Step 2) will be used 
to evaluate for the HCV reinfection outcome. Detectable HCV RNA, with and 
HCV sequence distinct from the baseline sequence will qualify for the outcome of 
HCV reinfection. The absolute number (and relative frequency) of participants 
meeting this outcome will be summarized along with a 95% CI using methods as 
described for other dichotomous study outcomes.  
 
 66 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/18  
 
Among SVR  responders, HCV disease regression will be defined by [CONTACT_833030] -4 value and the final study  FIB-4 value. The 
distribution of these absolute changes will also be described using key 
percentiles.  
 
Further details are outlined in the study’s Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
 
11.[ADDRESS_1156762] -benefit analysis will employ the resource utilization data collected at 
planned/unplanned study visits until the SVR is assessed (week 24/SVR evaluation visit) 
as well as SVR data and utilization data to develop an estimate of cost/SVR attained. 
 
12.[ADDRESS_1156763]/SVR attained using the MINMON protocol  
 
12.[ADDRESS_1156764]/SVR  attained - both globally and stratified by [CONTACT_1606] - calculated using 
country -specific costs and expressed in US$ 2017.  
 12.[ADDRESS_1156765]/SVR attained will be assessed from two perspectives . 
 
12.3.1  The perspective of the clinic/prog ram/site treating the participant  (program 
perspective). These costs include the cost of staff, laboratory monitoring, and 
medications involved in delivering HCV treatment to a participant . These costs 
begin at week 0 and continue through the week 24/ SVR evaluation. The 
program cost perspective is helpful to those who administer a clinic or treatment 
program who want to understand how MINMON would impact their program budget.  
 
There are two cost components from the program perspective: 
 1. Cost of HCV medications  
2. Cost of planned and unplanned study visit evaluations between week 0 and 
the week 24/ SVR evaluation visit 
 
12.3.2  The healthcare sector perspective—t he health sector perspective is broader 
than the program perspective. It includes the costs of staff, laboratory 
monitoring and medications between weeks [ADDRESS_1156766] of healthcare 
 67 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/[ADDRESS_1156767] components from the healthcare sector perspective: 
 1. Cost of HCV medications  
2. Cost of planned and unplanned study visit evaluations  between week 0 and 
the week 24/ SVR evaluation visit 
3. Cost of healthcare utilization outside of study sites  between week 0 and the 
week 24/ SVR evaluation visit 
4. Cost saving (or additional cost) that may accrue because a person attains 
SVR and subsequently uses fewer (or more) healthcare resources. This 
cost saving (cost)  is defined as the DIFFERENCE in healthcare  utilization 
per month measured at the week 48 visit comparted to the week 0 visit. The 
healthcare utilization questionnaire measures utilization over a 4- week 
recall period. This is defined as healthcare utilization per month. The 
difference in healthcare  utilization per month between the week 48 
assessment and the week 0 assessment is the monthly savings (or cost) 
attributable to attaining SVR. It will be  assumed that the monthly savings 
(cost) applies to every month between week [ADDRESS_1156768] savings is uncertain, sensitivity 
analyses  will be used to explore different estimates of saving attained including: 
1) difference in utilization measured at the week 72 visit and the week 0 visit, 2) 
difference in utiliz ation measured at week 72 and week 48 visits. In both of 
these sensitivity analyses, it will be  assumed that the monthly savings (or cost) 
we estimate applies to every month between weeks [ADDRESS_1156769] (expr essed in currency rather 
than units of resources consumed) using WHO CHOICE country -specific unit 
costs ( http://www.who.int/choice/cost- effectiveness/inputs/health_service/en/ ). 
 
It will be  assumed that all resource utilization between weeks [ADDRESS_1156770]/SVR attained.  
 
The primary analysis will be conducted in an intention to treat framework, 
whereby [CONTACT_833031] 24/SVR 
evaluation visit are assumed to be treatment failures and not counted as “SVR” 
in the cost/SVR attained calculation. This approach will also tend to bias results 
to a higher cost/SVR attained. A sensitivity analysis will explore cost/SVR when 
it is assumed that the rate of SVR among those lost to follow -up at week 24 is 
similar to the SVR rate among those with week 24 confirmation of cure.

  01/10/[ADDRESS_1156771] of HCV therapy. For U.S. 
sites, we will price SOF/VEL using the federal supply schedule. Because the cost of therapy is dynamic and changes by [CONTACT_833032], we will use 
sensitivity analyses to explore the impact of drug prices on the cost -benefit of 
treatment .  
 
12.4.[ADDRESS_1156772] of a study visit: a) cost of provider time, and b) cost of labs and assessments. Cost of the healthcare visits 
(Doctor/physician and staff time) —we will use WHO CHOICE estimates of 
outpatient care delivery costs by [CONTACT_1606]. We will include the week 0 visit (not 
the screening visit as it is a study procedure with no real -world analogue) and 
the visit for week 24/SVR evaluation. In addition, we will include any unplanned 
visits between week 0 and the week 24/SVR evaluation. 
 
We will cost laboratory tests using the national fee  schedule for public sector 
healthcare payers in each country. For example, we will use the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) reimbursement schedule for laboratory test costs in the U.S. and the National Health Laboratory Service schedule for  
sites in South Africa.  
 
12.4.[ADDRESS_1156773] healthcare utilization data a questionnaire similar to the ACTG Instrument named “ACTG A5265 Resource Utilization Interview” will be used 
following minor adaptation for A5360.  
 Staff will administer this instrument at the entry visit, the week 24 /SVR 
evaluation visit, at the weeks [ADDRESS_1156774] of health care delivery (clinic visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_507561], casualty ward visits) by 
[CONTACT_1606].

population. Cost/SVR both in local currency and in international dollars  will be stated . 
The cost/participant who does NOT attain SVR will also be estimated. Sensitivity 
analyses will demonstrate the impact of HCV therapy costs on the cost -benefit of 
MINMON.  
 
In addition, although there is no control arm to which we can compare the cost/SVR  
attained in MINMON, we will estimate the cost/SVR attained for the standard of care 
treatment protocol based on the cost of laboratory tests and medications and the 
planned schedule of events for a standard of care treatment course.

INTRODUCTION   
 
You are being asked to take part in this research study because you have been infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV, a virus that affects the liver), and have not been treated before for HCV. 
You may also be infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, the virus that causes AIDS). 
You may have compensated liver cirrhosis, which means that the liver is damaged, but is still working. This study is sponsored by [CONTACT_7681]. The doctor in charge of 
this study at this site is: (insert name [CONTACT_789]). Before you decide if you want to 
be a part of this study, we want you to know about the study.  
 This is a consent form. It gives you information about this study. The study staff will talk with you about this information. You are free to ask questions about this study at any time. If you agree to 
take part in this study, you will be asked to sign this consent form. You will get a copy to keep.  
 
 
WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?  
 
Currently, people who are infected with HCV are often closely monitored by [CONTACT_131459]. This 
requires patients to come to the clinic at least five times for visits, medication refills, and blood 
tests over a 12- week course of treatment. These guidelines are based on older HCV 
medications that had more side effects and were less successful at curing HCV than the 
medications used in this study. New HCV medications can cure 95 out of 100 infected persons 
who receive treatment. The medication that is provided in this study is approved by [CONTACT_833035]/HIV. In large clinical trials, the side effects reported by [CONTACT_833036] a placebo (no medicine).   
  This study is being done to see if a minimal monitoring approach is effective and safe when 
providing HCV treatment. The minimal monitoring approach will require fewer study visits and 
lab tests with no medication refills. This study is trying to see whether taking an HCV treatment 
with fewer clinic visits and laboratory tests can cure just as many people as the standard 
approach that uses more visits and laboratory tests. We will compare the results of this study 
with what we have observed in other studies using a standard approach.

  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/[ADDRESS_1156784] completed HCV treatment. This is called a sustained virologic response (SVR).  
 
This study will measure the amount of HCV virus in your blood at entry, week 24, week [ADDRESS_1156785] to cure a person of HCV using 
this minimal approach.  
  HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL BE IN THIS STUDY?  
 About 400 people (men and women age 18 years and older) will take part in this study.  
  WHERE IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?  
 This study will take place across the world and will include participants from the US and non -US 
sites. 
  
HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THIS STUDY?  
 You will be in this study for up to [ADDRESS_1156786] TO DO IF I AM IN THIS STUDY? 
 
If you decide to join this study and meet the study requirements after the screening visit, you will 
be enrolled into the study, unless enrollment has been closed to the subgroup(s) as described 
below.   
 Individuals with HIV infection and/or have compensated cirrhosis (liver is damaged but it is still 
working) are also eligible for the study. Enrollment, however, of HIV- infected individuals or those 
with compensated cirrhosis will be limited in the study (i.e. , only a certain number of persons will 
be included in the HIV -infected subgroup and compensated cirrhosis subgroup). The  study staff 
will let you know if this limit has been reached for either subgroup, and what this means for you.  
 At the entry visit, you will be given your study medication for all [ADDRESS_1156787] at room temperature (below 30°C [86ºF]) and take 
one tablet a day for the 3 -month period.

*After a person has successfully completed treatment for HCV, there is a period when HCV viral load in the blood is so low that even the most sensitive test cannot detect the virus. If this period of “undetectability ” lasts for 12 weeks  in a row  after the end of treatment, it is called SVR 
(sustained virologic response) . 
 
Everyone who enters the study will take a fixed -dose combination of sofosbuvir /velpatasvir 
(SOF/VEL) , which will be provided by [CONTACT_1758]. Anti -HIV drugs will not be provided by [CONTACT_10748].  
 
While you are in this study, you will need to be seen in the clinic about [ADDRESS_1156788] side effects.  
More information about the study tests is given below. During the study, you will get the results 
from any routine tests that are done during the study and relevant to your care when they are 
available.  
 
If you do not enroll into the study  
If you decide not to take part in this study or if you do not qualify to take part in this study, we will still use s ome of your information. As part of the screening visit, some demographic (for 
example, age, sex, gender, race), clinical (for example, disease condition, diagnosis), and 
laboratory (for example, CD4+ T -cell count, HCV and HIV viral load) information is being 
collected from you so that ACTG researchers may see if there are patterns or common reasons why people do not join a study.  
 
Required Blood Tests  
Your blood will be drawn from a vein in your arm and used to measure your HCV viral load (the 
amount  of HC V virus in your blood), to measure levels of certain hormones (chemical 
messengers in your blood), to see if the hepatitis B virus (HBV; another virus that affects your liver) is in your body, and for routine safety tests and metabolic tests (to test how your body uses the food that you eat). If you are a woman able to become pregnant, you will have a 
pregnancy test at the screening and entry visits  and at later study visits if you think you might be 
pregnant . If you are infected with HIV, you will have blood drawn to measure your HIV viral load 
(the amount  of HIV viru s in your blood) and your CD4+  cell counts (these are cells in your blood 
that fight infection). You will be told the results of these tests when they become available.  
 Some of your blood will also be stored (with no information that will identify you) and used for 
HCV genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (a test to see the genetic makeup of the HCV virus) and sequencing (a test to 
check for the pattern/code of the genetic makeup of the HCV virus)  for this study. HCV 
genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_832940].  
Since these stored samples will be tested in the future, the results will not be available to you.  
 
Blood will also be collected and stored for future testing at the end of the study.  Some of y our 
blood samples may be shipped and/or stored outside of the country from which they are 
collected.

Genetic (the message in your DNA) testing 
If you agree, your blood will be drawn and used to examine different genes (pi[INVESTIGATOR_832941]). Results of testing done on these samples may not be given to you because they will be 
done in the future.  If you do not agree to have genetic testing done, then the amount of blood 
drawn for future testing will be less (up to 20  mL less).  
 Please initial below if you agree to have any of your blood used for ACTG -approved future 
unspecified genetic testing. You may change your mind at any time and your samples w ill be 
destroyed.  
________ YES                     ________ NO  
 
Optional Tests  
If you agree, any blood left over after all required study testing is done may be stored (with no 
information that will identify you) and used for future ACTG- approved research. These blood 
samples may be stored for an unknown period of time. Results of testing done on these 
samples may not be given to you because they will be done in the future.  
 
Please initial below if you agree to have any of your leftover blood used for futu re ACTG -
approved research. You may change your mind at any time and reasonable efforts will be made to destroy your samples, though this may not always be possible.

asked at week [ADDRESS_1156800] information, if needed,  
and remind you of your upcoming study visits at weeks 48 and 72.  
 
 
WHY WOULD THE DOCTOR TAKE ME  OFF THIS STUDY EARLY?  
 The study doctor may need to take you off the study early without your permission if:  
 
• The study is cancelled.  
• Your doctor thinks the study is no longer in your best interest.  
• The site investigator thinks that you are at significant  risk of failing to comply with the 
requirements of the protocol.  
 
The study doctor may also need to take you off the study drugs without your permission if:  
 • You become pregnant.  
• You are breastfeeding.  
• Continuing the study drugs may be harmful to you.  
• You need a treatment that you may not take while on the study. 
 
If I have to permanently stop taking study drugs through the study, or once I leave the study, 
how can I get study drugs? 
 
If you must permanently stop taking SOF/VEL before the study is over, the study staff will talk 
with you about other options.  
 After you have finished the study, you will not be able to get SOF/VEL through the study. 
 
 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY?  
 
Risks of Social Harm  
Although the study site will make every effort to protect your privacy and confidentiality, it is 
possible that others could find out that you are participating in this study and that social harm 
may result (because you could become labeled as being infected with HCV and/or HIV). For 
example, you could be treated unfairly or discriminated against by [CONTACT_103106], friends, and/or the community.  
 
 86 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/18  
 
Risks of Drawing Blood  
Drawing blood may cause some discomfort, lightheadedness, bleeding, swelling, or bruising where the needle enters the body, and in rare cases, fainting, or infection.  
 
Risks of Study Drug  
The study drug (SOF/VEL) is relatively safe and in controlled clinical trials it was found to have a safety profile similar to a placebo (no medicine). The most common side effects you may 
experience are headache, nausea, vomiting, fatigue and diarrhea.  
 SOF/VEL  has limited drug interactions with HIV medications with the exception of three HIV 
medications - efavirenz, tenofovir , and tipranavir/ritonavir. If you are taking any of these 
medications, your doctor will talk to you about these interactions in detail and what symptoms to 
look out for. Your doctor may modify your HIV medications after discussing it with you so that 
you can be included in this study.   
 
SOF/VEL  also has some interactions with other types of medications. There is risk of slow 
heartbeat if you also take amiodarone (a medication to help control heart rate).  While you are on 
the study, you will be instructed not to take any of the prohibited medications  (for example, 
heartburn medication mentioned earlier) . The study staff will explain the prohibited and 
precautionary medications and discuss alternative options if you must take any of these concomitant medications.    
 There is a risk of seriou s and/or life- threatening side effects when non- study medications are 
taken with the study drugs. For your safety, you must tell the study doctor or nurse about all 
medications you are taking before you start the study and also before starting any new 
medi cations while on the study. Also, you must tell the study doctor or nurse before enrolling in 
any other clinical trials while on this study.  
 
Other Risks  
There is a risk that your stored samples may be misused. There are laws against this kind of misuse, but they may not fully protect you. The chance that this will happen is considered small 
because of the security taken with your samples.  
 Your genetic in formation is unique to you. There is a risk in genetic research that someone 
using your samples may identify you. However, this risk is very small, but may increase with the 
progress of science. Researchers will inform you of any newly identified risks.  
 If you are cured of your HCV, you could still become infected again with HCV. You can get HCV  
from coming in contact [CONTACT_833046]/or sexual fluid that is infected with HCV . 
 
 ARE THERE RISKS RELATED TO DELAYING HIV THERAPY?  
 You are not required to be on HIV medications to enter this study. If you are not on HIV 
medications at the time of your HCV infection and you and your doctor do not think you need to 
start HIV medications, we will not exclude you from the study. We also do not recommend delaying HIV medications for entry into the study if your doctor feels they are medically 
 87 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/18  
 
necessary. Although the dosing period of the HCV medication is short (84 days), a delay in necessary HIV medications could allow for progression of HIV disease, which can increase your risk of opportunistic infections and long- term after effects of HIV infection. If you have any 
concerns about these risks, we suggest that you discuss them with your medical provider.  
 
 
ARE THERE RISKS RELATED TO PREGNANC Y? 
 
The drugs or drug combinations in this study have not been studied extensively in pregnancy. If 
you are having sex that could lead to pregnancy, you must agree not to become pregnant  or to 
impregnate your partner  while you are taking the study medication  and for [ADDRESS_1156801] agree to one or 
more of the birt h control methods listed below:  
• A condom (male or female) with or without a spermicide 
• Diaphragm or cervical cap with or without spermicide 
• An intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Tubal ligation  
• Hormone- based contraceptives  
 Male and female participants not of reproductive potential are not required to use 
contraceptives.  
 
Some of the methods listed above may not prevent the spread of HIV to other people. If you are 
also infected with HIV, you should discuss your contraceptive choices with your health care 
provider to choose the best way for you to both prevent pregnancy as required by [CONTACT_833047].  
 Male participants should not donate sperm while on study treatment and for six weeks after 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_14930].  
 
 
ARE THERE BENEFITS TO TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY?  
 If you take part in this study, there may be a direct benefit to you. The study is designed to treat 
your HCV infection with an approved study medication and you may be cured of your HCV. It is 
also possible that you may receive no benefit from being in this study. Information learned from this s tudy may help others who have HCV and/or  HIV. 
 
 88 A5360 
  FINAL Version 1.0  
  01/10/[ADDRESS_1156802] BESIDES THIS STUDY?  
 
Instead of being in this study, you have the choice of:  
• treatment with prescription drugs currently available to you 
• treatment with other experimental drugs, if you qualify  
• no treatment  
 
Please talk to your doctor about these and other treatment choices available to you and the 
risks and benefits of these choices.

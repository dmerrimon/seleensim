Participant ID: STANFORD CONSENT FORM      PURPOSE OF RESEARCH  You are invited to participate in a research study of the effect of intranasal steroids on nasal obstruction.  We hope to learn whether or not intranasal steroids provide a significant benefit in patients with significant nasal septal deviation who experience nasal obstruction or congestion, as there is currently a requirement from many insurance providers that a trial of nasal steroids must be completed before perusing surgery to fix nasal septal deviation.  You were selected as a possible participant in this study because you have told us that you experience nasal obstruction and you have been found to have a deviated septum.   Currently, standard of care therapy is for patients to undergo treatment with an intranasal steroid spray for six weeks prior to consideration for nasal surgery to address septal deviation for nasal congestion. In this study, participants will receive the standard of care therapy plus an additional six weeks of therapy with a placebo nasal spray.    If you decide to terminate your participation in this study, you should notify Sam P. Most at (650) [ADDRESS_375936] on you or your medical care.  You can decide to participate now, but withdraw your consent later and stop being in the study without any loss of benefits or medical care to which you are entitled.  DURATION OF STUDY INVOLVEMENT   This research study is expected to take approximately 2 years: this is a 2 year study with 14 weeks to 8 months of active participation by [CONTACT_20908] (depending on whether the participant elects to undergo nasal septal surgery). Each patient will receive 6 weeks of therapy with Nasacort (an intranasal steroid)

Participant ID: and [ADDRESS_375937] to undergo surgery.     PROCEDURES  Participants will be divided into one of two study groups via random assignment (50% chance of being assigned to either group). Both groups will receive treatment with an intranasal steroid spray and a placebo treatment for 6 weeks each, though in reverse order from one another. This is called a “crossover” study.   Both sprays will be taken once a day as follows: one spray to each nostril daily. Standard of care therapy (ie what we would recommend you do for nasal obstruction even if you were not in this study) is six weeks of therapy with the intranasal steroid. As such, this study will only add on treatment with a placebo nasal spray for six weeks.   Below if a flowchart that diagrams the basic study design.

If it is necessary to miss an appointment, please contact [CONTACT_307092]. • Tell the Protocol Director or research study staff about any side effects, doctor visits, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_187485]. • Tell the Protocol Director or research staff if you believe you might be pregnant or gotten your partner pregnant. • Keep the study drug in a safe place, away from children and for your use only. • Complete your questionnaires as instructed. • Ask questions as you think of them. • Tell the Protocol Director or research staff if you change your mind about staying in the study. • Tell the Protocol Director or research staff if you might be pregnant or have gotten your partner pregnant during the course of this study.     WITHDRAWAL FROM STUDY  If you first agree to participate and then you change your mind, you are free to withdraw your consent and discontinue your participation at any time.  Your decision will not affect your ability to receive medical care for your disease and you will not lose any benefits to which you would otherwise be entitled.

Participant ID:  The Protocol Director may also withdraw you from the study and the study medication may be stopped without your consent for one or more of the following reasons  o Failure to follow the instructions of the Protocol Director and study staff. o The Protocol Director decides that continuing your participation could be harmful to you. o Pregnancy  o You need treatment not allowed in the study. o The study is cancelled.  o Other administrative reasons. o Unanticipated circumstances.  POSSIBLE RISKS, DISCOMFORTS, AND INCONVENIENCES   There are risks, discomforts, and inconveniences associated with any research study.  These deserve careful thought.  You should talk with the Protocol Director if you have any questions.  Possible side effects of intranasal steroid sprays include nasal irritation, headache, cough, and unpleasant taste during administration. Rare, but more serious side effects include nasal septal perforation (development of a hole in your nasal septum) and oral candidiasis (or thrush) which is a fungal infection that requires topi[INVESTIGATOR_35786].   Given that all study participants will receive a placebo for 6 weeks, there is a risk that your nasal obstruction will be worse during this period than during that 6 weeks you are treated with the intranasal steroid. Similarly, during the 2 week washout period, there is a risk that your nasal obstruction will worsen as compared to when you were on the nasal steroid (if you receive the nasal steroid first).   Treatment with Nasocort and/or placebo may involve risks to the subject, which are currently unforeseeable.   Should you decide to pursue surgery for your septal deviation, there are associated risks with surgery. These will be discussed in detail at a preoperative appointment (regardless of if you enroll in this study or not). With any surgery, there is a small but non-zero risk of adverse effects to anesthesia. There is also a

Participant ID: risk of bleeding, infection, damage to surrounding structures (eyes, mouth, face). Additionally, there is a risk that surgery will incompletely fix your symptoms of  nasal congestion.   There may be a discomfort of travel time associated with this study; however, administration of study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_307091].   POTENTIAL BENEFITS                               There is a potential benefit of improved nasal congestion following treatment with Nasocort.   We cannot and do not guarantee or promise that you will receive any benefits from this study.  ALTERNATIVES Alternatives to treatment for nasal obstruction include nasal surgery. However, as previously stated, many insurance companies require a trial of intranasal steroids prior to authorizing surgery to correct septal deviation and therefore first undergoing a trial of intranasal steroid spray is standard.   No standard treatment will be withheld as a result of being enrolled in this study. You will still have the option to undergo nasal surgery following completion of this study, if you are otherwise medically deemed appropriate for surgery.    PARTICIPANT’S RIGHTS  You should not feel obligated to agree to participate.  Your questions should be answered clearly and to your satisfaction.  If you decide not to participate, tell the Protocol Director.    You will be told of any important new information that is learned during the course of this research study, which might affect your condition or your willingness to continue participation in this study.  You have the right to refuse to answer particular questions that you are asked during this study.

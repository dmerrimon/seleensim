Improvement in Patients with Keratoconus
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_566603], OD
I. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY AND BACKGROUND 
1. Purpose of the study
The goal of the study is to examine the effects of custom front-surface wavefront correction 
on visual performance, and on neutralization of higher order aberrations, in patients wearing a 
scleral lens device. We will study patients with keratoconus, the most common type of corneal 
ectasia, who have already been fitted with the [LOCATION_011]Sight BSS ([LOCATION_011] Sight Scleral) for 
improved visual function.
2. Background
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_566604], there are many vision ailments, 
which do not yet have effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. These eye conditions can result in moderate to 
severe vision impairment or blindness, which have severe impacts on an individual’s quality 
of life. One such condition is corneal ectasia which is characterized by a progressive thinning 
of the cornea causing a distortion in its shape and consequential visual impairment1. Many 
specific conditions fall within this category include keratoconus, keratoglobus, pellucid 
marginal degeneration2, Terrien’s marginal degeneration, and post-operative complications 
related to LASIK, RK, PRK, or corneal transplantation3.
Distortions of the cornea from these corneal ectasias can result in increased levels of higher 
order aberrations4, 5. Higher order aberrations are types of optical defocus that cannot be 
corrected by [CONTACT_566607]. This makes standard 
spectacle and contact [CONTACT_566608]. More 
advanced corrections such as scleral lenses can help mask higher order aberration content 
using a fluid reservoir, but some higher order aberrations can remain uncorrected and 
contribute to the degradation of visual performance6. These remaining aberrations following 
correction are termed residual aberrations. Interest in corneal aberrations has increased with 
the development of customized contact [CONTACT_13276]7 and customized corrective refractive surgery8, 
9. 
The goal of these treatment options is to improve visual performance beyond the results 
gained by [CONTACT_566609], namely the spherical and cylindrical 
refractive errors. These customized techniques require the reliable determination of both 
overall higher order corneal aberrations and specific higher order aberration terms.

use the [LOCATION_011]Sight Scleral (BSS) lens which is similar to the PROSE device used in previous 
collaborative studies. The BSS lens is FDA-cleared and provides a commercial solution with a 
standardized fitting process.

III. METHODS AND PROCEDURES 
1.  Overview
This study will be a single center, double-masked collection of data taking place at the 
Flaum Eye Institute. Informed consent will be obtained from all subjects after a thorough 
explanation of the nature and possible risks of the study. Flaum Eye Institute electronic health 
records of existing patients will first be screened by [CONTACT_566611]. Some study communication regarding 
scheduling will be done over the phone or email. The screening will be similar to a standard

acuity and basic vision evaluation.
The study eye will be chosen based on inclusion criteria; if both eyes qualify, the eye with 
worse best corrected acuity will be chosen. A new scleral lens that incorporates peripheral 
etched markings is needed for the second visit. These markings are used to determine the 
exact rotational and positional orientation of the lens on the eye when performing the HOA 
measurement in the second visit. If screening evaluation reveals that the current lens does not 
fully neutralize spherical refractive error or that the current lens is not positionally stable, a 
design of this new lens will be updated to these new optimized parameters. If no optimization 
is required, then an identical lens will be created with the orientation markings added. The 
subject will keep his or her original lens and wear it between study visits until the end of the 
study. The new scleral lenses that will be made for each subject will be kept at the Flaum Eye 
Institute between subject visits. The principle investigator along with the study team will be 
responsible for storage, dispensing, collection, accountability and disposal. [LOCATION_011]Sight will 
be responsible for the creation of the lenses.
At the second visit, the patient’s vision and fit will be evaluated with the optimized 
baseline BSS lens. Visual acuity and device fit will be evaluated and recorded. If the BSS 
device fit is still not optimized, then a new device will be made, and the second visit 
evaluation will be rescheduled. Once the baseline lens design is determined to be satisfactory, 
the patient will have their wavefront aberration measured with a wavefront sensor. We will 
dilate the pupil pharmacologically with phenylephrine (2.5%) and tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] (1%) and take 
wavefront measurements of the optical aberrations of the subject’s eye wearing the baseline 
lens using a portable, non-invasive wavefront analyzer designed to measure highly aberrated 
eyes (Ovitz, P10/EyeProfiler). We will then design and manufacture a study lens that is 
identical in design to the baseline [LOCATION_011]Sight BSS lens except for a custom front surface 
designed to neutralize the optical aberrations measured with the wavefront analyzer. This 
HOA-optimized lens will be created prior to the third visit.
At the third visit the patient’s vision and fit will be evaluated with the new HOA-optimized 
lens. A designated study team member will measure visual acuity and over-refraction of the 
patient. If an adjustment is needed for the lens, then a new device will be made, and the third 
visit evaluation will be rescheduled.
Once well-fitting baseline and HOA-optimized test lenses are established, both lenses will 
be remade and presented to the designated study team member in charge of evaluation and 
subject together in a masked fashion. During a fourth visit, the patient’s vision will be 
extensively evaluated using standard non-invasive optometric measurements with each of the 
two lenses. First the patient’s will undergo a basic evaluation with each lens to ensure that the 
fit is correct. The patient will then undergo basic visual acuity; high and low contrast visual 
acuity, contrast sensitivity, and subjective vision scoring with each lens. The subject’s 
wavefront aberration will also be measured again with each lens.

2.    Instruments
Portable Wavefront Sensor (P10/EyeProfiler)  - Subjects will be sitting or standing in front of 
the trained member of the study team. The member of the study team will hold the Wavefront 
Sensor up to the subject’s eye where the orbit of the eye will make contact [CONTACT_4490] a soft rubber 
eyecup. The subject will be asked to look forward at chart across the room and blink naturally 
while keepi[INVESTIGATOR_566606] (laser) “as clear as possible” throughout the measurement. The 
light reflected back out of the subjects’ eye is collected to obtain measurements of wavefront 
aberrations of the eye. The measurement and light exposure will take an average of [ADDRESS_744092] 21, 2018                                                      Page 7 of 123.   Study Timeline:
   Each subject will undergo 4-[ADDRESS_744093] may be asked to 
repeat the study on the same day or return on another day.
5.   Data Storage and Confidentiality
After individuals are consented and enrolled in the study, they will be assigned a de-identified 
number. The file containing their personal health information (PHI) will reside on a limited-
access shared drive with firewall and password protection and is restricted to individuals in 
the research team named on this application. The measurement data is transported on portable 
hard drives and analyzed on an encrypted, password-protected computer in the secured lab 
area. This data will be stored on desktops and portable hard drives that remain in offices in the 
limited access research area and are used for analysis on password-protected personal 
computers by [CONTACT_8362]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_37104], there is always some 
risk that patient information is unintentionally disclosed.
Screening exam results, ethnicity/race form and other printed PHI will be maintained in a 
locked office in the limited-access research area.
Identifiable PHI will be shared with [LOCATION_011]Sight for the purposes of manufacturing the scleral 
lenses throughout the study. This will use the same Fit Connect secure computer system that 
is already used by [CONTACT_566612]. Data shared through this system is limited to name, date 
of birth, and lens parameters.
De-identified study information will be shared with Ovitz Corporation for the purposes of 
scientific analysis.
IV. RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT 
1. Risk Category
Minimal risk is involved. 
FLAUM EYE  INSTITUTE
Department of Ophthalmology
August 21, [ADDRESS_744094]’s eyes will be exposed to light or light flashes that are 
about the same or lesser intensity than those in a routine eye exam in an ophthalmologist’s 
office. Subjects may get tired from having measurements taken in their eyes.
For wavefront sensor measurement, subjects will require the use of eye drops that 
dilate the pupil. The eye drops we will use, Phenylephrine 2.5% and Tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] 1%, 
are routinely prescribed by [CONTACT_292541]. The dilation drop may cause mild 
discomfort, stinging, and temporary redness in the eye. Exposure to light may be 
uncomfortable and vision may be blurred while the eye remains dilated for at least 5-[ADDRESS_744095] not been studied on pregnant 
women or fetuses; therefore pregnant women will be excluded from this study. 
For wavefront sensor measurement, the intensity of the laser diode is eye-safe 
according to the maximal permissible exposures allowed by [CONTACT_566613]. The 
light source will emit between 800-850nm of light. In this wavelength range, the eye 
can tolerate constant exposure of up to 400µW. The laser diode will operate at up to 
25µW output, which is more than 15 times less than the maximal permissible 
exposure. All light sources used in this study are less than the Maximum Permissible 
Exposure (MPE) specified by [CONTACT_566614] (ANSI Z136.1-2000)].
Subjects in this study will already be wearers of B ostonSight Scleral lenses and will 
have already been made aware of and exposed to the risks of their use. These risks 
can include but are not limited to discomfort, pain, tearing, redness, burning, 
sensitivity to light, and blurred vision  when initially wearing the lenses. There is 
also a small chance of infection and corneal abrasi on from normal usage.

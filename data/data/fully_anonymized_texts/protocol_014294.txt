Research Project Information
4.1Provide a brief description of the research project
In older adults, falls are costly, consequential and correlated with both physical and cognitive
decline. Most falls occur when standing or walking. Many activities require us to stand or walk while
performing tasks like talking or making decisions. Such “dual tasking” interferes with the control of
standing and walking. This interference, or “cost,” is exaggerated in older adults with previous falls
and is predictive of future falls. Neuroimaging evidence indicates that standing and walking,
especially when dual tasking, activate distributed brain networks including the left dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex (dlPFC)—a brain region sub-serving executive function. Thus, strategies that
facilitate activation of the left dlPFC and its connected neural networks hold promise to mitigate dual
task costs, improve physical and cognitive function, and ultimately, reduce falls.
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) provides a noninvasive means of selectively
modulating cortical excitability. We have shown in younger and older adults that a 20-minute session
of tDCS designed to increase excitability of the left dlPFC reduces dual task costs and improves
mobility when tested just after stimulation.  We have since completed a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], sham-controlled trial of
a 2-week, 10-session tDCS intervention targeting the left dlPFC in 20 older adults with slow gait and
mild-to-moderate executive dysfunction. The intervention was successfully double-blinded and
well-attended. tDCS, compared to sham, reduced dual task costs and induced trends towards
improved mobility and executive function over a 2-week follow-up. We thus contend that tDCS
targeting the left dlPFC holds promise to improve the control of standing and walking—and ultimately
 Still, the size and duration of tDCS-induced benefits to older adult reduce falls—in older adults.
“fallers” have not been established. Moreover, to date, tDCS delivery has attempted to optimize
current flow based on a “typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855]” brain and has thus  accounted for individual differences in skin,not
skull, cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_349438]. Such personalization is now possible
with the current flow modeling we propose.
Our Overall Aim is to compare, in older adults with previous falls, the effects of a  tDCS personalized
intervention designed to target the left dlPFC on the dual task costs to standing and walking, and
other physical and cognitive factors that are on the causal pathway to falls and important to everyday

women (72 per arm) aged 65-85 years who report ≥[ADDRESS_434338] no major neural or musculoskeletal disorders that explain their
falls. The tDCS intervention will comprise 20, 20-minute sessions of tDCS over a 4-week period.
Importantly, we will utilize current flow modeling from baseline structural MRIs to determine the tDCS
electrode placement and stimulation parameters that optimize electrical current flow to the desired
target within each participant’s brain. 
We hypothesize that, in older adults with previous falls and over a 6-month follow-up, a personalized
tDCS intervention targeting the left dlPFC, as compared to sham, will mitigate dual task costs to the
control of standing and walking and enhance other metrics of both physical and cognitive function.

1.0 Background
Background and rationale for the research
 Each year, Falls are common, costly and caused by [CONTACT_349468]-motor function. 
30-40% of older adults will fall.  Even in the absence of serious injury, a fall often leads to1-[ADDRESS_434342]
reductions in falls.  18-21This ineffectiveness likely stems from a relative lack of focus on
cognition and its critical role in physical function.22
In particular, those with worse cognitive “executive” function (i.e., difficulty planning, making
decisions, multi-tasking, inhibiting inappropriate behaviors, etc.) have worse mobility  and23,[ADDRESS_434343] recently dedicated to the role of cognition in age-related
physical decline.  This 3-year workshop culminated in the recommendation that27-29
interventions to improve physical function and prevent falls in older adults should specifically
focus on the functional integration of physical and cognitive function.29
The control of standing and walking—especially during dual tasking—is dependent upon the

maintain performance in both tasks.  Studies using fMRI, EEG and/or functional55-57
near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) indicate, as expected, that standing and walking,
especially when dual tasking, activate the prefrontal cortices—the primary brain regions giving
rise to cognitive function.  Studies using fNIRS to measure brain activation (i.e., relative58-68
increases in oxygenated hemoglobin levels)  standing and walking indicate that when during
compared to normal conditions, standing or walking while performing a verbalized serial
subtraction task increases prefrontal cortex activation within both hemispheres, but particularly
.  Several of these studies have further reported those who within the left hemisphere58-64,66-69
exhibit greater increases in left prefrontal activation when dual tasking exhibit lower dual task
costs and better executive function.67,68
fMRI evidence indicates that performing two cognitive task together—as compared to
performing them separately—activates additional brain regions specifically within the left
.  Moreover, the left dlPFC is particularly activated during performance of cognitive dlPFC70,71
tasks that require both working memory and verbal processing.  We thus contend that72-76
while the control of standing and walking likely calls upon the bilateral dlPFC and its connected
neural networks, the left dlPFC is important to one’s ability to safely stand and walk while
completing cognitive tasks that require verbalization—an ability central to daily living activities. 
tDCS holds promise as a therapy to mitigate dual task costs to standing and walking, and
improve other physical and cognitive outcomes on the causal pathway to falls, in older adults.

personalized, multi-session tDCS intervention designed to increase the excitability of the left
dlPFC improves dual tasking and other important physical and cognitive outcomes in older
adults. Moreover, this trial will establish the size and duration of tDCS-induced benefits, and
quantify its associated biophysical metrics via current flow modeling (i.e., average electric field
on target; see Innovation Section below). Together, these discoveries will enable future
studies to 1) use neuroimaging to identify the effects of tDCS on brain activation and its
relationship to function, 2) optimize tDCS as a longer-term intervention by [CONTACT_8246]

 (non-clinical, pre-clinical or clinical) Previous studies leading up to and supporting
the proposed research
Single sessions of tDCS targeting the left dlPFC reduce dual task costs and improve mobility
 In three separate but related studies, [CONTACT_349534] studied healthy young in multiple populations:
adults (22±2yrs),  relatively healthy older adults (69±5yrs),  and older adults with slow gait112 38
and mild-to-moderate executive function (81±10yrs) (manuscript in press). All participants
completed two visits. On each visit, standing and walking were assessed both with and without
simultaneous performance of a serial subtraction cognitive task, just before and after a single
20-minute session of tDCS targeting the left dlPFC on one visit, and sham stimulation on the
other visit, in random order. In all three cohorts, stimulation did not alter standing postural
sway or walking speed under single task conditions. However, during dual tasking, real tDCS
was associated with less postural sway speed and area when standing, and faster gait speed
when walking (p<0.01). As a result, only real tDCS reduced the dual task cost (i.e., percent
change from single to dual tasking) to these outcomes (sway speed: p<0.1; sway elliptical
area: p<0.02; gait speed: p<0.01).  Together, these data give us confidence that increasing
prefrontal cortex excitability provides at least short-term benefit to dual task performance
across individuals who range widely in both age and functional capacity.
A 10-session tDCS intervention mitigates dual task costs to standing and walking, and
appears to improve physical and cognitive function, in older adults with slow gait and executive

were then randomized to receive ten, 20-minute sessions of real tDCS targeting the left dlPFC,
or sham stimulation. Follow-up assessments were completed within three days of the final
tDCS session and again two weeks later.

tDCS was delivered by [CONTACT_349479]-8™ (Neuroelectrics, Corp). tDCS was designed to
increase the excitability of the left dlPFC using a  approach: the positive non-personalized
electrode was placed over the F3 region of the 10-[ADDRESS_434349] on neuronal excitability. Both interventions were
well attended (9.1±0.8 of 10 sessions) and no adverse events were reported. Double-blinding
procedures were highly effective: following intervention, the number of correct “guesses” of
intervention assignment was no greater than that due to chance for participants, as well as
study personnel administering tDCS. 
  
Baseline and follow-up assessments included the proposed dual task paradigm and multiple
tests of physical and cognitive function. At baseline, the mean (±SEM) dual task cost to
standing balance (i.e., the speed of postural sway) was 50±12%. Excitingly, the real tDCS
intervention group, as compared to sham, exhibited markedly reduced dual task costs over the
two-week follow-up period. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_243379], similar effects or trends were
observed for the dual task cost to walking speed (p=0.04), the TUG test of mobility (p=0.09),
the Trail Making Test of executive function (TMTb – TMTa; p=0.11), the Montreal Cognitive
Assessment (MoCA, p=0.04), and the Geriatric Depression Scale (p=0.10). 
  
By [CONTACT_349480][INVESTIGATOR_349445] 1) strengthened ongoing collaborations between the PI
[INVESTIGATOR_9627]-investigators in this application, 2) developed state-of-the-art and scalable data
management infrastructure, 3) ensured that tDCS interventions are safe, well tolerated, well
attended, and can be effectively double-blinded in an older adult population similar to that
proposed, and 3) enabled more accurate sample size calculations by [CONTACT_349481]-subject variance in the primary (and most secondary) outcomes proposed in this study,
as well as the effects of tDCS intervention on these outcomes. We therefore have confidence
that we can successfully implement and complete the proposed trial and that tDCS targeting
the left dlPFC (one of the proposed tDCS intervention targets) will improve dual task
performance and other physical and cognitive outcomes on the causal pathway to falls in older
adults.

participants then completed the non-personalized tDCS intervention designed to increase
excitability of the left dlPFC. We used the  framework to model the tDCS-induced Stimweaver
electrical field within each participant’s brain. The normal component of this field (believed to
facilitate neuronal excitability) within the left dlPFC correlated closely with reductions (i.e.,
improvements) in the dual task costs to gait speed. However, this normal component varied
considerably across participants. These pi[INVESTIGATOR_349446] 1) the left

personalized, multi-session tDCS intervention designed to increase the excitability of the left
dlPFC improves dual tasking and other important physical and cognitive outcomes in older
adults. Moreover, this trial will establish the size and duration of tDCS-induced benefits, and
quantify its associated biophysical metrics via current flow modeling (i.e., average electric field
on target. Together, these discoveries will enable future studies to 1) use neuroimaging to
identify the effects of tDCS on brain activation and its relationship to function, 2) optimize tDCS
as a longer-term intervention by [CONTACT_8246] “maintenance” tDCS after the initial intervention,
and 3) further establish tDCS as a stand-alone or adjunct fall prevention strategy.
This approach recognizes the multifactorial nature of falls and tests an intervention that can

better able to adapt to the environmental stresses and physical disabilities that precipi[INVESTIGATOR_349447].  Our participant inclusion and exclusion criteria are designed to include older adults at
elevated risk of falls due to various intrinsic and extrinsic causes, but at the same time ensure
that they are not so impaired that they cannot participate in or benefit from the intervention.
Based on empi[INVESTIGATOR_349448], dynamic
nature of the human gait and postural control systems in aging, we expect that targeting
high-level cortical elements of these systems will translate into improved dual tasking and
other physical and cognitive outcomes across individuals, despi[INVESTIGATOR_349449]. We will test a personalized intervention specifically aimed at improving the integrated
function of the involved systems and in so doing, will produce highly generalizable results that
will directly lead to future trials to prevent falls within this population

falls. The tDCS intervention will comprise 20, 20-minute sessions of tDCS over a 4-week period.

Secondary outcomes will be derived from tests of processing speed, working memory and sustained
attention.
In the proposed trial, participants randomized to the real intervention arm will receive tDCS
personalized to their individual head and brain anatomy, with the goal of generating an average
electric field of 0.25 V/m within left dlPFC. Briefly, this will be done by [CONTACT_349483] a structural brain MRI, which will be used to define the ‘left dlPFC’ target. The MRI will also
be used to determine, through segmentation, tissue boundaries of the scalp, skull, CSF including
ventricles, gray matter and white matter.  This information will then be imported into a software104
program called Stimweaver™ (Neuroelectrics Corp, [LOCATION_011] MA) that uses patented finite-element
optimization algorithms to determine the electrode placement and current parameters required to
achieve the aforementioned goal of stimulation.   
  
We hypothesize that, in older adults with previous falls and over a 6-month follow-up, a personalized
tDCS intervention targeting the left dlPFC, as compared to sham, will mitigate dual task costs to the
control of standing and walking and enhance other metrics of both physical and cognitive function.   
In our previous study, described above in section 1.2,   we found that the degree to which
non-personalized tDCS is “on-target” correlates with dual task improvements, yet varies significantly
across participants. A small subset of the cohort described in the previous section completed
structural MRIs at baseline. Six of these participants then completed the non-personalized tDCS
intervention designed to increase excitability of the left dlPFC. We used the  framework Stimweaver
to model the tDCS-induced electrical field within each participant’s brain. The normal component of
this field (believed to facilitate neuronal excitability) within the left dlPFC correlated closely with
reductions (i.e., improvements) in the dual task costs to gait speed. However, this normal component

dlPFC is an important target for dual task performance, and 2) personalizing tDCS to each
individual’s head and brain anatomy will likely maximize its effectiveness and reduce inter-subject
variability.
3.0 Study Design
3.1Study design (e.g. double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design, etc.)
We will conduct a single site, sham-controlled, double-blinded, randomized trial of tDCS.
Participants will perform baseline functional assessments, as well as a structural MRI of the
brain. They will then be assigned to a four-week, 20-session intervention of either personalized
tDCS or sham (i.e., control) stimulation, via permuted block randomization stratified by [CONTACT_349484], and equal numbers of men, are randomized to each
arm. The Neuroelectrics (Cambridge, MA) Starstim-8™ tDCS system will be used to deliver
the intervention, which enables blinding of both participants and study staff. Follow-up
functional assessments will be performed within three days of the final tDCS session and
again three and six months later. Falls will be tracked throughout the entire duration of study
participation using mail-in falls calendars.

neurological exam, and clinical gait assessment to rule out acute illness and overt neural or
musculoskeletal causes of falls. Individuals who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be
enrolled. Participants will then complete the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly to obtain
self-reported levels of baseline physical activity,[ADDRESS_434361] of premorbid intellectual ability (1-minute
administration time, to be used as an adjustor for changes in executive function).133
  
 At the end of Visit 1, participants will  complete the proposed cognitive Familiarization: first
assessment battery  as practice to minimize the effects of procedural learning following the true
e .  Trained baselin134to be completed during Visit 3 (see that section for battery details)
research assistants will administer the familiarization testing.   They will not repeat the TMT,
nor will they practice the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) because it has multiple test
versions that minimize confounding due to learning. , they will complete a 20-30 Second
minute familiarization of the dual task paradigm (see “Dual task performance” subsection
below). This procedure will 1) determine the cognitive task to be used in the assessment,
thereby [CONTACT_349489]/or anxiety provoking to the participant, and 2)
minimize the potential for procedural-related learning to influence outcomes. First, we will
determine the cognitive task to be used for each participant using a standardized procedure
 in which participants are seated in a chair and asked to count backwards from30,50,135-[ADDRESS_434362] by 7’s, then 3’s, 5’s, or 1’s. The first task in which three correct answers are provided
within 15 sec will be used for testing. Participants will also receive instructions on the specific
dual task testing procedures and complete several practice trials of each condition. 
  
 Baseline MRIs will enable personalization of tDCS via Visit 2—Structural MRI (Up to 1 hours):
current flow modeling, as well as detection of silent infarcts and white matter hyperintensities
(WMHs). T1, T2, and T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2 FLAIR) scans will be
completed on a 3T GE system with a quadrature head coil at the Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center, located near the Clinical Research Lab.  The MRI scan itself will last 30
minutes.
  
 at the Clinical Research Laboratory at Hebrew Visit 3—Baseline assessments (Up to 2.5hrs)
Rehabilitation Center, Roslindale, MA :
This assessment will take place within IFAR’s Clinical Research Laboratory and comprise
tests of dual tasking, mobility, and cognition.  Trained research assistants will administer all of
the baseline assessment testing described below.  Accelerometry-derived habitual physical
activity will be assessed for five days after baseline. Falls-tracking will also be initiated at this
visit. 
: Procedures will follow published recommendations  that Dual task performance24,139,[ADDRESS_434363] used this paradigm within our45,141-145
research and laboratory for over ten years. Participants will complete three, 60-second trials in
each of five conditions:
Condition 1: Single task: seated cognitive task (see below for description).
Condition 2: Single task: standing.
Condition 3: Single task: walking.
Condition 4: Dual task: standing with cognitive task.
Condition 5: Dual task: walking with cognitive task.
All standing trials will be completed on a stationary force plate (Kistler, Inc) to record postural
sway (i.e., center of pressure) fluctuations throughout the trial. Participants will stand barefoot
with arms at their side and feet shoulder width apart. The feet will be traced on the first trial
and this tracing will be used to ensure consistent foot place throughout the study. Participants
will be instructed to focus their attention on an “X” marked on a wall in front of them at eye
level and will be reminded to stand as still as possible before each trial. All walking trials will be
completed around a 25m indoor track. Prior to testing, participants will be outfitted with
wireless biosensors—each containing a triaxial accelerometer, goniometer and
magnetometer—on the sternum, low back, wrists and ankles to record gait kinematics
(Mobility Lab™, APDM Inc). Participants will be reminded to walk at their preferred,
comfortable place prior to each walking trial. 
  
The cognitive task will be verbalized serial subtractions from a random three-digit number
between 200 and 999, to be provided to the participant prior to each trail. The type of serial
subtractions (7’s, 3’s, 5’s or 1’s will be determined in a familiarization session completed at the
screening visit. Participant responses during each trial will be recorded. We have chosen serial
subtractions as the cognitive dual task because: 1) it activates a distributed cortical network
including the left dlPFC,  2) is the most widely used dual task paradigm  and induces146 24,[ADDRESS_434364] when standing and gait

has excellent internal validity (Cronbach’s alpha=0.96) and test-retest reliability (ICC=0.96).
 It correlates with self-reported and assessed functional status,  the degree of155-157 158,159

: Participants will complete a 30-35min battery of cognitive tests that are Cognitive Assessment

selected that have alternate forms, or, were felt to be resistant to practice effects. All tests
have excellent psychometric properties and normative data covering the range of demographic
characteristics of our proposed sample, with minimal ceiling and floor effects. Tests will include
the Trail Making Test (A and B) of executive function (i.e., speeded visual search, vigilance
and set-shifting).  For this primary outcome, we will utilize the original Test B at baseline,[ADDRESS_434367] of global cognitive
function,  WAIS-IV Digit Span (Forwards, Backwards) test of working memory,  the165,[ADDRESS_434368] – Revised (HVLT-R) of verbal epi[INVESTIGATOR_10682].  Staff will be trained in all assessment170
procedures by [CONTACT_349493]-investigator, [CONTACT_349535] (with ongoing supervision to ensure
standard administration and scoring).
  
 will be assessed as it influences performance on clinical tests of physical and cognitive Mood

the Center of Epi[INVESTIGATOR_253260]-Depression Scale Revised (CESD-R) scale,  which has173
been used extensively in epi[INVESTIGATOR_253261] 20 questions regarding feelings
of depression, worthlessness, loneliness, energy level, and fear. The CESD-R has high
internal consistency (r=0.90) and a test-retest reliability of 0.51.174
  
: Similar to mood, lower-extremity pain is common in older adults with previous falls,Pain175
interferes with function  and may benefit from tDCS.  Participants will complete the175,176 128 
Brief Pain Inventory, which quantifies pain location, pain intensity and the extent to which pain
interferes with daily functioning.177
: As the recruited cohort will have high risk of falling and related injuries during Falls tracking
follow-up may influence physical and cognitive performance, falls will be tracked using monthly
falls calendars.  Participants will be asked to mark the fall on the calendar and complete a118
form every time they fall. Staff will review calendars at each monthly follow-up visit, to discuss
the incidence and characteristics of falls. Falls tracking will also provide preliminary data on
falls rates by [CONTACT_19313], to be used for planning of future studies.
 will be recorded for five consecutive days at baseline and the Habitual physical activity
immediate, three- and six-month follow-ups using a lightweight water-proof sensor taped to
participant’s low-back (L5 vertebral level) (Axivity Inc., [LOCATION_008]). This device has been
validated for use in older adults of various function level.  It provides overall activity and178-180
step counts,  as well as accurate, automatic detection of time spent lying, sitting, standing181
and walking  and gait kinematics during detected bouts of walking.180,182 178
at the Clinical Research Laboratory at Visits 4-23— (Up to 40 minutes) tDCS Intervention
Hebrew Rehabilitation Center, Roslindale, MA :
Trained research assistants will administer the tDCS intervention to the participant over twenty
visits that  will be completed Mon-Fri over four consecutive weeks at approximately the same
time of day.
 Participants will be randomized to receive tDCS that facilitates the tDCS interventions:
excitability of their left dlPFC, or sham stimulation (Figure 5). The left dlPFC was chosen
because it is part of the frontoparietal control network,  a key contributor to executve123,124
function and the processing of sensory feedback for the control of actions,  and it is58-68
activated when standing or walking—especially when dual tasking.  tDCS targeting this66-68
region has been studied extensively: it appears to mitigate dual task costs to standing and
walking in older adults (See Preliminary Studies)  and enhances numerous aspects of38,112,125
cognitive-motor function when tested over shorter follow-up periods.  It has also shown83-90
efficacy for depression  and chronic pain.92,93 94
: Electrode placement and current parameters will be optimized to each Personalized tDCS
participant by [CONTACT_349494] , with the goal of generating an average Stimweaver
electric field of 0.25 V/m  within their identified left dlPFC. The direct current delivered by [CONTACT_31617]77
one electrode will not exceed 2.0 mA; the total amount of current from all electrodes will not
exceed 4 mA. Each 20-minute session will begin and end with a 60-second ramp up/down of
current amplitude to maximize comfort.
: We will use an active sham in which very low-level currents (0.5 mA total) Personalized Sham
will be transferred between electrodes in close proximity on the scalp throughout the entire
20-minute session. This intervention will be optimized to each participant to deliver currents
designed to not significantly influence their cortical tissue, but still mimic the cutaneous
sensations induced by [CONTACT_32101]. We have shown that this active sham effectively blinds
participants to stimulation condition and does not effect functional outcomes.101
: Each intervention will comprise 20, 20-minute sessions of Intervention characteristics
stimulation completed over four consecutive weeks. Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_349451] [ADDRESS_434369] recently reported
lasting benefits of multi-session tDCS interventions on depression,  pain,  stroke,126,127 128 129
and Parkinson’s disease,  which have each tested interventions ranging from 8-20 sessions.130
We therefore believe 20 sessions constitutes a safe and feasible intervention, and that it will
maximize the duration of expected effects, yet not over-burden participants with study visits.
tDCS sessions will be administered at approximately the same time of day. Participants will
continue taking their medications throughout the intervention, and will be asked to inform the
study team of a change in medication usage.
: tDCS will be delivered by [CONTACT_349495]-blinding and safety procedures
administration by [CONTACT_349496]-Allen Center for Noninvasive Brain Stimulation at the BIDMC,
which is directed by [CONTACT_349493]-invstigator, [CONTACT_349536]-Leone. Similar to our most recent studies,
tDCS will be delivered using the Startim-8™ device and software (Neuroelectrics Corp,
Cambridge MA), which enables custom amounts of current to be delivered through an array of
eight Pi™ gel Ag/AgCl electrodes placed on the scalp according to the 10-20 EEG convention.
Study personnel administering tDCS and the participants will not be aware of tDCS
intervention arm assignment. We will ensure such double-blinding by [CONTACT_349497]-specific stimulation codes, as supplied by [CONTACT_349498], prior to study initiation. At the end of each visit, subjects will complete a
questionnaire to report potential side effects (e.g., skin irritation, headache, etc).  In131
accordance with recent recommendations, the efficacy of tDCS blinding will also be assessed
by [CONTACT_349499]—and study team member administering tDCS—to judge whether
real or sham tDCS was given, as well as their certainty of this judgment.  This questionnaire111
will be completed at the end of the first tDCS session, at the end of the last tDCS session and
at the final follow-up assessment.
 
 Visits 24-26— (Up to 2.5 hours  each visit)Follow-up Assessments at the Clinical Research
 Participants will repeat the Laboratory at Hebrew Rehabilitation Center, Roslindale, MA :
baseline assessment immediately post-intervention - Visit 24 (within 3 days following the final
tDCS visit) and again at three-Visit 25,  and six months - Visit 26.  Trained research assistants

6.0 Statistical Plan
6.1Statistical Methods
: Overall approach
Exploratory analyses will be used to assess outcomes distributions, and any necessary
transformations (e.g. to combat significant skew) will be performed prior to estimation of mean
treatment effects. Said estimation will use  of post-intervention mixed effects linear regression
outcomes immediately following intervention and at three and six months, with random
intercepts and slopes to account for serial correlation in repeated measurements on
individuals; models will control for baseline outcomes as in analysis of covariance. Owing to
the potential for nonlinear trends in outcomes with time, we will assume no functional form of
temporal trends. Missing data will be accommodated by [CONTACT_27873] (at least 50) imputation of
missing records using algorithms to accommodate the clustered nature of the longitudinal
design. Analyses will adjust for the stratified design effect (i.e. control for sex). All estimates
will be accompanied by 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the purposes of reporting in
publication. Limited hypothesis testing will be performed at the 0.05 level, but emphasis will be
on estimation. Owing to the focused nature of the design and prespecification of hypotheses,
no interim analyses are planned, and no significance ‘adjustment’ will be applied for
multiplicity.
Sample size determination
Include power calculations or provide justification for their absence (e.g.,
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]/feasibility study).
: For sample size calculations we assume the following: 1) all Sample size assumptions
participants will be included based on their randomized assignment; 2) a two-sided type-I error
probability of 0.05; 3) a cumulative attrition rate of at most 15%; 4) modest levels of
intervention non-adherence and missing data, such that total missingness at six months post
intervention will be at most 20%, leaving 114 participants with evaluable data at the end of
follow-up, consistent with our experience in this population; and 5) analyses utilizing multiple
imputation will have similar power to those using observed data, consistent with theory and
6.2prior experience. We anticipate greater power in practice owing to data obtained from the
multiple follow-up measurements. 
:  will test the effect of tDCS on dual task costs to Aim-specific Analytic Plan and Power Aim [ADDRESS_434370] to serial subtraction performance (as a time-varying covariate) to isolate the
costs to gait by [CONTACT_349500]. Sensitivity
assessments will stratify by [CONTACT_349501][INVESTIGATOR_349454]-specific effects (see
below). Association between model-based estimates of subject-specific intercepts and slopes
(generated as random effects) will be examined to assess the degree to which change with
time is associated with the average level of function denoted by [CONTACT_349502]. Sample
 Prior experiences suggest that 1) inter-individual standard deviation of size estimates:
dual-task costs under either sham or intervention will be no greater than 20%, 2) serial
measures of dual task costs express substantial within-participant correlation, in excess of 0.8,
 and 3) real tDCS intervention reduces dual task costs (Section [IP_ADDRESS]). We assume45,141-[ADDRESS_434371] 57 participants per arm, the trial will provide 90% power to detect a
 in a comparison of dual task mean difference of 8% between intervention and control arms
costs at any time following cessation of intervention.[ADDRESS_434372] baseline standard190,191 135,192
deviation of 1.5 units and will exhibit high serial correlation over the repeated measurements in
this design, as high as 0.9.  Assuming a more conservative serial correlation of 0.75,192
simulation studies (50,000 replicated trials) indicate that the repeated measures design will
obtain 92% power to detect a mean intervention-attributable effect on SPPB of 0.[ADDRESS_434373] on executive function measured primarily by [CONTACT_349503] (i.e.,
TMTB-TMTA); simulation studies similarly indicate that we will achieve at least 90% power to
detect standardized effects of the tDCS intervention of 0.35 or greater.
: To accommodate attrition and other sources of missingness, we will utilize the Missing data
method of multiple imputation by [CONTACT_3006].  At least [ADDRESS_434374] previously used these methods in194
trials of anabolic and exercise interventions in similar populations.191,195-197
: To determine robustness of results we will consider the potential for Sensitivity analyses
confounding or effect modification according to baseline age, sex, BMI, and other covariates
listed in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. These will be addressed in secondary exploratory and regression
analyses in parallel to those described above. 
: The trial design Insurance of scientific rigor—attention to age and sex as biological variables
is cognizant of the potential influence of age and sex on results. Randomization will be
stratified by [CONTACT_3445]-identified sex classification and this will be acknowledged in all
analyses. Sensitivity analyses will also be conducted to address the potential for effect
modification by [CONTACT_349504].
6.3Data Management
Roles responsible for management, including data collection, entry, cleaning, etc.
and basic procedures and safeguards to be used.
All data collected for analysis will be de-identified and assigned a unique study number. Data 
collection forms will be kept in a locked file cabinet in the office of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_349455].   Data will be entered and stored on a password-protected secure server at
Hebrew SeniorLife.
The Institute for Aging Research primarily employs the REDCap system to facilitate data
management operations. REDCap is a full-featured clinical trials data management system
(DMS) accessible to data entry and data analysis workstations using secure Web
technologies. The REDCap product is developed and maintained by [CONTACT_349505], including Hebrew SeniorLife. HSL hosts and
maintains a dedicated instance of REDCap for use across our research enterprise. Each
research study is provided separate project workspace in which all of the study data are stored
in a MySQL relational database on the private corporate network behind several firewalls and
located physically within the HSL data center.
7.0 Foreseeable Risks, Potential Benefits, Compensation and Costs to Participants
Potential medical risks of study procedures
TESTS OF WALKING AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION: The proposed walking tests have been 
adapted from the large-scale, population-based MOBILIZE [LOCATION_011] study (PI: L. Lipsitz) and 
multiple completed and ongoing clinical studies within the Clinical Research Laboratory at 
IFAR. They have been designed to be safe for individuals of varying risk and conditioning 
levels including older adult fallers. The physical activity associated with these tests is of low to 
moderate intensity. Potential risks include strains, sprains, muscle soreness, and 
light-headedness. In rare instances, more serious side effects such as an injurious fall may 
7.1occur. For all functional tests, a trained "spotter" will stand behind or close to the subject to 
provide stabilizing assistance if necessary. Subjects will be instructed to stop performing or 
skip any test that makes them feel uncomfortable. Adequate rest will be given in between
each  test, and any reusable equipment will be cleaned with disinfectant after each use.
MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) : Participants will be asked to participate in one
brain MRI. They will rest in a horizontal position on the imaging table that slides into a
magnetic field. All studies performed under this protocol will not exceed the FDA guidelines for
magnetic resonance in any way. Therefore, the risks assumed by [CONTACT_349506]. The presence of metal objects could
cause a burn injury, but by [CONTACT_349507], this risk will be minimized.
Participants may feel claustrophobic or anxious during the procedure and they may experience
musculoskeletal or back discomfort lying on the scanner table. The MRI makes loud banging
noises as it takes images. Under some circumstances nerve stimulation may occur, which may
be experienced as a mild twitching reaction in limbs and/or lower back muscles. Such effects
are rare and scan settings are kept well below the levels where such effects are known to
occur. MR imaging also requires the use of radio waves that can cause a mild warming similar
to exposure to hot weather. Body temperature may increase but by [CONTACT_349508]. Participants will be instructed to inform MRI personnel should they experience
discomfort due to warming and the procedure will be stopped.
TRANSCRANIAL DIRECT CURRENT STIMULATION (tDCS): tDCS has been widely
used during the last decade demonstrating non-significant risk to participants.  Expected side
effects include:  
1) Sensations reported by [CONTACT_253284]: (These sensations can
sometimes continue throughout and for a brief period following completion of the tDCS but
usually resolve shortly after the initiation of tDCS)
Mild tingling (20-70%)
Light itching (30-40%)
Slight burning (10-22%)
Discomfort or mild pain (10-18%)
2) Other effects that can occur both during and after tDCS include:
Mild fatigue (15%)
Skin redness (20%)
Headache (10-15%)
Difficulties in concentration (11%)
3) Additionally the following rare side effects have been described:
Nausea (<(<1%)
Nervousness (<1%)
Although it has never been reported in tDCS, seizures are a theoretical risk. Individuals
with a history of seizures and/or a diagnosis of epi[INVESTIGATOR_349456].
 
 
7.2 (non-medical) Potential psychosocial risks, discomforts, inconveniences of study
procedures
TESTS OF MENTAL FUNCTION: Risks associated with answering these cognitive
test questions are minimal, but participants may experience mental fatigue and/or anxiety
during this form of testing.
INCONVENIENCES:   We will minimize the risk to subjects in this study by [CONTACT_349509]. The proposed protocol requires multiple visits
and therefore considerable participant burden with respect to time and effort. Our study team
has a strong track record of successful clinical research requiring similar participation, and
retention has been high in these projects.  The Clinical Research Laboratory at IFAR is118,205
located next to a cafeteria and equipped with comfortable seating, a TV, movies, books and
magazines to keep individuals occupi[INVESTIGATOR_349457]. Several additional strategies
will be employed to minimize participant burden and maximize adherence to the protocol. We
will:
Develop a personal relationship between participants and members of the staff by
[CONTACT_349510].
Schedule appointments at convenient times with familiar staff.
Explain to participants all aspects of their participation and follow up.
We will demonstrate and practice study procedures before beginning data collection.
Provide reminders of all appointments and follow-up phone calls.
Include personal notes in the participant’s data file to remember events in the life of the
participant; these can be commented on at the next visit (e.g., birthday, birth of a
grandchild).
Provide snacks during all visits.
Provide transportation for all visits, if required
Provide valet or dedicated, on-site parking spaces.
Compensate participants for visits.
Potential benefits to individual participants as a result of participating the study
Participants may not receive any significant health benefit from participation, although some
may benefit from knowledge of their health status, as well as potential therapeutic effects of
tDCS.
7.3
Participants will be provided an up to  $[ADDRESS_434375] these costs
paid for, but the  participant may be responsible for some of them. For example, they may be
responsible for  payment of any deductibles and co-payments required by [CONTACT_349511].  There
are no plans to provide any compensation for an injury beyond what is described above, 
should one occur.
 If the event does not meet the criteria of a serious adverse event, and the participant is willing
and able to continue, he/she will be able to continue and complete the study.
 
7.6Will there be remuneration for participants?
e.g. goods, services, gift cards, cash, etc.
✔Yes
Describe the type remuneration and the timing of remuneration to study
procedures
e.g. participants will be provided with $50 per study visit, to be distributed as
visits are completed, etc..
Participants will receive the following stipends after completing each activity:
Visit 1:  In-person screening and study familiarization - $30
Visit 2: MRI study at the BIDMC - $50, plus transportation and/or parking
reimbursement
Visit 3:  Baseline assessment visit - $45
Visits 4 - 23:  tDCS intervention visits (Twenty visits @ $10 each, will be
completed Mon-Fri over four consecutive weeks = $200)
Visits 24-26:  Follow up assessments (repeat of baseline visit) immediately
post-intervention; at [ADDRESS_434376]
intervention. $45 each x 3 = $135
This is  total of $460 for participants who complete the entire study.  
Participants will be offered snacks at all study visits.  Transportation will be
provided for all study visits, if needed.
No
7.7Will participants incur any costs due to participating in the study?
e.g. transportation, parking, etc.
Yes
✔No
8.[ADDRESS_434377] medical occurrence in a participant, whether or not is
is causally related to the study. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom or
disease temporally associated with the study. Adverse events will be recorded on the
appropriate case report forms and source documents. The investigator and/or trained staff
member will evaluate all adverse events as to their severity and relation to the test article. The
8.1severity of adverse events will be graded as follows:
Mild: Awareness of a sign or symptom but easily tolerated.
Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to cause interference with usual activity or to affect
clinical status.
Severe: Incapacitating with inability to do usual activity or to significantly affect clinical
status.
Life Threatening: The participant was at immediate risk of death from the adverse event
as it occurred.
The Investigator will also assess the relationship of any adverse event to study, based
upon available information, using the following guidelines:
0 = Unlikely: No temporal association, or the cause of the event has been identified.
1 = Possible: Temporal association, but other etiologies are likely to be the cause;
however, involvement of the study procedures cannot be excluded.
2 = Probable: Temporal association, other etiologies are possible, but not likely.
A serious adverse event is any experience that results in any of the following
outcomes: death, is life threatening, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_349458], a persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Important medical events that
may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a
serious adverse event when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize
the patient or participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the
outcomes listed in this definition.
8.2Unanticipated problem and adverse event reporting
Include the method, distribution and time frame (e.g. to IRB, to DSMB, etc.
Unanticipated problems and adverse events will be reported according to the Hebrew
SeniorLife's IRB written guidelines  for interventional studies. Serious adverse events will be

StarStim is a transcranial current stimulation device. The device is powered by a 9 volt battery.
Transcranial Current  stimulation (tCS) is a neurophysiological technique capable of
modulating the excitability of the
neuronal tissue of the central and peripheral nervous system through the application, for
a finite time length, of an electrical field. This electric field is generated by [CONTACT_349518]. It has been demonstrated
that the technique is safe and potentially beneficial if used within the known bounds of

Devices
✔A non-significant risk (NSR) to participants
An NSR device study is one that does not meet the definition for an SR
device study (see below).
Provide an explanation of this determination and any other information that
may be helpful to the IRB.
(e.g. description of the device, reports of prior investigations with the device,
the proposed investigational plan, subject selection criteria, etc.)
The device is a non-significant risk wearable external activity monitor that has been
used and validated in previous studies of older functionally impaired adults.    In the
current research, we will utilize the device in the same manner as has been reported
previously, i.e, the device will be placed and secured at the participant's low back, at
the level of the L5 vertebra.   In our current studies, participants report that once
placed, it is not noticeable nor does it impact daily life, and is in fact, easy to forget it is
in place.  All enrolled participants will be asked to wear the activity monitor as describe
below in section 3.5.

Head
Exposure Parameters
Please include (as applicable):
MRI: Static magnetic field strength (Gauss), SAR: average and peak RF
heating, rate of magnetic field strength change with time (dB/dt) relative to
gradient, and acoustic noise (decibels)
Ultrasound: Frequency (Hz) and intensity (W/cm2)
Lasers or Ultraviolet: Power output (W/cm2), wavelength (nm) and tissue
exposure (J/cm2)
2.3Baseline MRIs will enable personalization of tDCS via current flow modeling, as well as
detection of silent infarcts and white matter hyperintensities (WMHs). T1, T2, and T2-weighted
fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2 FLAIR) scans will be completed on a 3T GE system
with a quadrature head coil at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, located near the
Clinical Research Lab. Two T1 datasets will be acquired for tDCS personalization: one with
fat-suppression to optimize brain and CSF segmentation and another one without it to optimize
skull and skin segmentation. Field-of-view will encompass all the head with coverage up to
C1/2 vertebrae. Silent brain infarcts will be identified as focal lesions appearing intense hyper-
on T2 and intense on T2 FLAIR scans. White matter lesions will be identified as hypo-
periventricular and subcortical regions appearing intense on T2 FLAIR. Lesion hyper-
diameters and volumes will be automatically calculated using an in-house AFNI and
FreeSurfer combination pi[INVESTIGATOR_253262],  with manual138
edits as necessary. All volumes will be normalized as a percentage of the total brain
parenchyma volume.

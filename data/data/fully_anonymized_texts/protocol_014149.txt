SummaryThe primary endpoint will be objective radiographic tumor response.  Secondary 
endpoints will include PFS at 6 months, time to progression, time to response, 
duration of response, OS, and safety. 
Note: As of December 31, 2018, patients will no longer be followed and follow

A Simon two-stage optimal phase II clinical trial design will be used. If [ADDRESS_1036614] 9 patients, it will be concluded that the true response rate 
was 5% or less and no further patients will be enrolled. If [ADDRESS_1036615] 9 patients, 15 additional patients will be enrolled to a total of 24 
evaluable patients. If 3 or more responses are observed, there would be evidence 
that the regimen used was active (true response rate is at least 25%). This design 
will declare the regimen as active when the true response rate is 25% with 90% 
probability (power = 0.90) at the 1-sided 0.[ADDRESS_1036616] 24 evaluable patients.

Version date:  February 6, 2019 - 6 -1 INTRODUCTION  - BACKGROUND & RATIONALE 
1.1 Metastatic Disease - Overview & Current Treatment Options
Metastatic brain tumors are by [CONTACT_757231] 170,000 per year and developi[INVESTIGATOR_757205] 40% of all cancer patients1-4. Metastases 
out number primary brain tumors by [CONTACT_2902] 4:1. The most common primary malignancies 
of brain metastases include lung cancer (compromises about 50%), breast cancer (15%), 
melanoma (9%), and unknown primary (about 11%)5.  Metastatic disease can cause 
neurologic issues ranging from headache to seizures, motor and sensory impairment, and 
other focal neurologic deficits. In general , prognosis is poor with a median survival time 
of 1 month for untreated patients, and approximately 4 months for treated patients2,  with 
only 10% being alive at one year after diagnosis6.    
When determining treatment for patients with brain metastases, histology, number of 
lesions, and resectability of lesions are taken into account. Because over 70% of patients 
present with multiple metastases at diagnosis5, focal treatments such as surgical resection 
and radiosurgery are ineffective. For these patients, whole brain radiation therapy 
(WBRT) should be performed, although some practitioners use radiosurgery for patients 
with ≤ [ADDRESS_1036617] been used, such as 15 
fractions of 2.5 Gy over 3 weeks for a total dose of 37.5 Gy.  The Radiation Therapy 
Oncology Group (RTOG) has evaluated these and various other radiation fractionation 
schedules, however median survival seems independent of the dose schedule3.  
For patients with brain metastases from systemic cancers who fail WBRT, median 
survival is 4-6 months. Patients with the limited or no extracranial disease, KPS > 70, and 
age < [ADDRESS_1036618] survivals over 10 months. Using the updated GPA, survival is 2.8 to 11.1 
months depending on score and histology7. This group of patients is increasing with 
improvements in systemic therapy; leading to a group of patients whose demise is from 
CNS involvement. 
Systemic chemotherapy has been shown to have activity in the treatment of brain and 
leptomeningeal metastases8, 9, but no one drug has proven to be overly effective.   
Lassman et al. treated 31 patients with CNS metastasis with HD MTX and found a 
median overall survival (OS) of approximately 5 months with a 28% response and stable 
disease rate10. Temozolomide has been shown to have median survivals of approximately 
[ADDRESS_1036619] cancer 
patients with BM, 22 patients treated lapatinib and capecitabine or topotecan, had a 
partial response (PR) rate of 22% and a stable disease (SD) rate of 40%; median time on 
trial was approximately [ADDRESS_1036620] and lung 
cancer patients with BM with survivals of 6.25 and 7.25 months15, 16. Finally patients with 
solid tumors who had BM entered in to various phase I trials had a survival of 7.5 
months17.
1.2 Bevacizumab
Bevacizumab is recombinant humanized monoclonal IgG 1 antibody that selectively binds 
to and neutralizes the biologic activity of human vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF). Bevacizumab inhibits the binding of VEGF to its receptors, Flt-[ADDRESS_1036621], on 
the surface of endothelial cells. Neutralization of the biologic activity of VEGF can result 
in the reduction of tumor vascularization and subsequent reduction in tumor growth. It is 
currently FDA approved for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), lung cancer and

colorectal cancer (CRC). Approximately 130,[ADDRESS_1036623] or in clinical trials. The following discussion 
summarizes some of the efficacy results pertinent to this particular trial. Please 
refer to the bevacizumab Investigator Brochure for descriptions of all completed 
phase I, II, and III trials reported to date.
In a large phase III study (AVF2107g) in patients with metastatic CRC, the 
addition of bevacizumab, to irinotecan/5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (IFL) 
chemotherapy resulted in a clinically and statistically significant increase in 
duration of survival, with a hazard ratio of death of 0.67 (median survival 15.6 
vs. 20.3 months; p < 0.001). Similar increases were seen in PFS (6.2 vs. 10.6 
months; p < 0.001), overall response rate (35% vs. 45%; p < 0.01) and duration 
of response (7.1 vs. 10.4 months; p < 0.01) for the combination arm versus the 
chemotherapy only arm (bevacizumab Investigator Brochure, October 2005).
Based on the survival advantage demonstrated in study AVF2107g, bevacizumab 
was designated for priority review and was approved on [ADDRESS_1036624]-line treatment in combination with IV 5-FUbased 
chemotherapy for subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer. Additional data 
from phase III trials in metastatic CRC (E3200), non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC; E4599), and metastatic breast cancer (E2100) have also demonstrated 
clinical benefit from bevacizumab when added to chemotherapy.  
In Study E3200, the addition of bevacizumab to FOLFOX chemotherapy resulted 
in improved OS compared with FOLFOX alone (13.0 vs. 10.8 months, 
respectively, HR  0.75; p  0.01) in a population of previously treated CRC 
patients. There was also improved OS in first-line NSCLC patients (E4599) 
treated with carboplatin/paclitaxel  bevacizumab compared with chemotherapy 
alone (12.3 vs. 10.3 months, respectively; HR  0.80; p = 0.003). The results 
from this trial were the basis for FDA approval of bevacizumab for use in 
combination with carboplatin  paclitaxel as first-line treatment of patients with 
unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic, non-squamous NSCLC in 
October 2006.  Finally, patients with untreated metastatic breast cancer (E2100) 
who received bevacizumab in combination with weekly paclitaxel had a marked 
improvement in PFS compared with chemotherapy alone (13.3 vs. 6.7 months, 
respectively; HR  0.48; p  0.0001) (see the Bevacizumab Investigator Brochure 
for additional details).
1.2.2 Safety  Profile
In the initial phase I and II clinical trials, four potential bevacizumab-associated 
safety signals were identified: hypertension, proteinuria, thromboembolic events, 
and hemorrhage.  Additional completed phase II and phase III studies of 
bevacizumab as well as spontaneous reports have further defined the safety

III trials include congestive heart failure (CHF) primarily in metastatic breast 
cancer, gastrointestinal perforations, wound healing complications, and arterial 
thromboembolic events (ATE). These and other safety signals are described in 
further detail as follows and in the bevacizumab Investigator Brochure.
[IP_ADDRESS] Hypertension
An increased incidence of hypertension has been observed in patients 
treated
 with bevacizumab. Grade [ADDRESS_1036625] included hypertensive 
crisis, hypertensive encephalopathy, and reversible posterior 
leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) 20, 21. There is no information on 
the effect of bevacizumab in patients with uncontrolled hypertension at 
the time of initiating bevacizumab therapy. Therefore, caution should be 
exercised before initiating bevacizumab therapy in these patients. 
Monitoring of blood pressure is recommended during bevacizumab 
therapy.  Optimal control of blood pressure according to standard public 
health guidelines is recommended for patients on treatment with or 
without bevacizumab.  
Temporary interruption of bevacizumab therapy is recommended in 
patients with hypertension requiring medical therapy until adequate 
control is achieved. If hypertension cannot be controlled with medical 
therapy, bevacizumab therapy should be permanently discontinued.  
Bevacizumab should be permanently discontinued in patients who 
develop hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy.
[IP_ADDRESS] Proteinuria   
An increased incidence of proteinuria has been observed in patients 
treated
 with bevacizumab compared with control arm patients. In the 
bevacizumab-containing treatment arms of clinical trials (across all 
indications), the incidence of proteinuria (reported as an adverse event) 
was up to 38% (metastatic CRC Study AVF2192g). The severity of 
proteinuria has ranged from asymptomatic and transient events detected 
on routine dipstick urinalysis to nephrotic syndrome; the majority of 
proteinuria events have been grade 1. Grade 3 proteinuria was reported in 
up to 3% of bevacizumab-treated patients, and Grade 4 in up to 1.4% of 
bevacizumab-treated patients. The proteinuria seen in bevacizumab 
clinical trials was not associated with renal impairment and rarely 
required permanent discontinuation of bevacizumab therapy.  
Bevacizumab should be discontinued in patients who develop Grade 4 
proteinuria (nephrotic syndrome). Patients with a history of hypertension 
may be at increased risk for the development of proteinuria when treated 
with bevacizumab. There is evidence from the dose-finding, phase II 
trials (AVF0780g, AVF0809s, and AVF0757g) suggesting that Grade 1 
proteinuria may be related to bevacizumab dose.
[IP_ADDRESS] Thromboembolic  Events 
Both venous and arterial thromboembolic (TE) events, ranging in 
severity
 from catheter-associated phlebitis to fatal, have been reported in 
patients treated with bevacizumab in the colorectal cancer trials and, to a 
IRB #: STU00080404-MOD0020 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 2/18/2019 through 4/1/2019.

cancer trials. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Venous thromboembolism (including deep venous 
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and 
thrombophlebitis) 
In the phase III pi[INVESTIGATOR_47273], there was 
a slightly higher rate of venous TE events in patients 
treated with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy compared 
with chemotherapy alone (19% vs. 16%). 
In Study AVF2107g, a phase III, pi[INVESTIGATOR_757206], VTE events, including deep venous 
thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and thrombophlebitis, 
occurred in 15.2% of patients receiving chemotherapy 
alone and 16.6% of patients receiving 
chemotherapy  bevacizumab. The incidence of Grade 
 3 venous VTE events in one NSCLC trial (E4599) was 
higher in the bevacizumab-containing arm compared to 
the chemotherapy control arm (5.6% vs. 3.2%).  One 
event (0.2%) was fatal in the bevacizumab-containing 
arm; not fatal events were reported in the 
carboplatin/paclitaxel arm (see bevacizumab Investigator 
Brochure). In metastatic CRC clinical trials, the 
incidence of VTE events was similar in patients 
receiving chemotherapy  bevacizumab and those 
receiving the control chemotherapy alone. 
In clinical trials across all indications the overall 
incidence of VTE events was 2.8% 17.3% in the 
bevacizumab-containing arms compared with 
3.2%15.6% in the chemotherapy control arms. The use 
of bevacizumab with chemotherapy does not 
substantially increase the risk of VTE event compared 
with chemotherapy alone.  However, patients with 
metastatic CRC who receive bevacizumab and 
experienced a VTE event may be at higher risk for 
recurrence of VTE event.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Arterial  thromboembotic events  
An increased incidence of ATE events was observed in 
patients treated with bevacizumab compared with those 
receiving control treatment. ATE events include 
cerebrovascular accidents, myocardial infarction, 
transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), and other ATE events.  
In a pooled analysis of data from five randomized phase 
II and III trials (mCRC [AVF2107g, AVF2192g, 
AVF0780g]; locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC 
[AVF0757g]; metastatic breast cancer [AVF2119g]), the 
incidence rate of ATE events was 3.8% (37 of 963) in 
patients who received chemotherapy   bevacizumab 
compared with 1.7% (13 of 782) in patients treated with 
IRB #: STU00080404-MOD0020 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 2/18/2019 through 4/1/2019.

Version date:  February 6, 2019 - 10 -chemotherapy alone. ATE events led to a fatal outcome 
in 0.8% (8 of 963) of patients treated with 
chemotherapy  bevacizumab and 0.5% (4 of 782) of 
patients treated with chemotherapy alone.  
Cerebrovascular accidents (including TIAs) occurred in 
2.3% of patients treated with chemotherapy 
 bevacizumab and 0.5% of patients treated with 
chemotherapy alone. Myocardial infarction occurred in 
1.4% of patients treated with chemotherapy 
 bevacizumab  compared with 0.7% of patients treated 
with chemotherapy alone (see the bevacizumab 
Investigator Brochure for additional details).
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_33930] a standard therapy for primary and secondary 
prophylaxis of ATE events in patients at high risk of 
such events, and the use of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] ≤ [ADDRESS_1036627] 
to metastatic colorectal cancer patients were presented at 
ASCO 200522. Further analyses of the effects of 
concomitant use of bevacizumab and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_167721].
[IP_ADDRESS] Gastrointestinal  perforation 
Patients with metastatic carcinoma may be at increased risk for 
the development of gastrointestinal perforation and fistula when 
treated with bevacizumab and chemotherapy. Bevacizumab 
should be permanently discontinued in patients who develop 
gastrointestinal perforation. A causal association of intra-
abdominal inflammatory processes and gastrointestinal 
perforation to bevacizumab treatment has not been established. 
Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when treating patients 
with intra-abdominal inflammatory processes with bevacizumab. 
Gastrointestinal perforation has been reported in other trials in 
non-colorectal cancer populations (e.g., ovarian, renal cell, 
pancreas, breast, and NSCLC) and may be higher in incidence in 
some tumor types.
[IP_ADDRESS] Fistula   
Bevacizumab use has been associated with serious cases of 
fistulae including events resulting in death. Fistulae in the GI 
tract are common (1%–10% incidence) in patients with 
IRB #: STU00080404-MOD0020 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 2/18/2019 through 4/1/2019.

Version date:  February 6, 2019 - 11 -metastatic CRC, but uncommon (0.1%1%) or rare (0.01%–
0.1%) in other indications. In addition, fistulae that involve areas 
of the body other than the GI tract (e.g., tracheoesophageal, 
bronchopleural, urogenital, biliary) have been reported 
uncommonly (0.1%–1%) in patients receiving bevacizumab in 
clinical studies and postmarketing reports. Events were reported 
at various timepoints during treatment, ranging from 1 week to 
 [ADDRESS_1036628], 
discontinuation of bevacizumab should be considered.
[IP_ADDRESS] Wound  healing complications 
Wound healing complications such as wound dehiscence have 
been reported in patients receiving bevacizumab. In an analysis 
of pooled data from two trials in metastatic colorectal cancer, 
patients undergoing surgery 28-60 days before study treatment 
with 5-FU/LV plus bevacizumab did not appear to have an 
increased risk of wound healing complications compared to 
those treated with chemotherapy alone23. Surgery in patients 
currently receiving bevacizumab is not recommended. No 
definitive data are available to define a safe interval after 
bevacizumab exposure with respect to wound healing risk in 
patients receiving elective surgery; however, the estimated half-
life of bevacizumab is 21 days. Bevacizumab should be 
discontinued in patients with severe wound healing 
complications. If patients receiving treatment with bevacizumab 
require elective major surgery, it is recommended that 
bevacizumab be held for 4–8 weeks prior to the surgical 
procedure. Patients undergoing a major surgical procedure 
should not begin or restart bevacizumab until 4 weeks after that 
procedure (in the case of high-risk procedures such as liver 
resection, thoracotomy, or neurosurgery, it is recommended that 
chemotherapy be restarted no earlier than 6 weeks and 
bevacizumab no earlier than 8 weeks after surgery).
[IP_ADDRESS] Hemorrhage
Overall, grade 3 and 4 bleeding events were observed in 4.0% of 
1132 patients treated with bevacizumab in a pooled database 
from eight phase I, II, and III clinical trials in multiple tumor 
types (bevacizumab Investigator Brochure, October 2005). The 
hemorrhagic events that have been observed in bevacizumab 
clinical studies were predominantly tumor-associated 
hemorrhage (see below) and minor mucocutaneous hemorrhage. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Tumor-Associated Hemorrhage  
Major or massive pulmonary hemorrhage or hemoptysis 
has been observed primarily in patients with NSCLC.  
IRB #: STU00080404-MOD0020 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 2/18/2019 through 4/1/2019.
NU 12C06
Version date:  February 6, 2019 - 12 -Life-threatening and fatal hemoptysis was identified as a 
bevacizumab-related adverse event in NSCLC trials.  
These events occurred suddenly and presented as major 
or massive hemoptysis. Among the possible risk factors 
evaluated (including squamous cell histology, treatment 
with anti-rheumatic/anti-inflammatory drugs, treatment 
with anticoagulants, prior radiotherapy, bevacizumab 
therapy, previous medical history of atherosclerosis, 
central tumor location, and cavitation of tumors during 
therapy), the only variables that showed statistically 
significant correlations with bleeding were bevacizumab 
therapy and squamous cell histology.
Of patients experiencing pulmonary hemorrhages 
requiring
 medical intervention, many had cavitation 
and/or necrosis of the tumor, either preexisting or 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_368448]. Patients

In Study E4599, in which squamous cell carcinoma was 
excluded, the rate of any type of Grade   3 hemorrhage 
was 1.0% in the control arm (carboplatin and paclitaxel) 
versus 4.1% in the carboplatin and paclitaxel 
 bevacizumab  arm (Sandler et al. 2006).  
GI hemorrhages, including rectal bleeding and melena 
have
 been reported in patients with CRC, and have been 
assessed as tumor-associated hemorrhages. Tumor-
associated hemorrhages were also seen rarely in other 
tumor types and locations, including a case of CNS 
bleeding in a patient with hepatoma with occult CNS 
metastases and a patient who developed continuous 
oozing of blood from a thigh sarcoma with necrosis.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Mucocutaneus  Hemorrage  
Across all bevacizumab clinical trials, mucocutaneous 
hemorrhage has been seen in 20%-40% of patients 
treated with bevacizumab. These were most commonly

[IP_ADDRESS] Congestive heart failure 
In clinical trials CHF was observed in all cancer indications 
studied to date, but predominantly in patients with metastatic 
breast cancer. In the phase III clinical trial of metastatic breast 
cancer (AVF2119g), 7 (3%) bevacizumab-treated patients 
experienced CHF, compared with two (1%) control arm patients.  
These events varied in severity from asymptomatic declines in 
left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to symptomatic CHF 
requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47276]. All the patients treated 
with bevacizumab were previously treated with anthracyclines 
(doxorubicin cumulative dose of 240360 mg/m2). Many of 
these patients also had prior radiotherapy to the left chest wall.  
Most of these patients showed improved symptoms and/or left 
ventricular function following appropriate medical therapy24. In 
a randomized, phase III trial of patients with previously 
untreated metastatic breast cancer (E2100), the incidence of 
LVEF decrease (defined as Grade 3 or 4) in the 
paclitaxel  bevacizumab arm was 0.3% versus 0% for the 
paclitaxel alone arm. No information is available on patients

5.2 Dose Modifications & Toxicity Management
5.2.1 Dose Delays/Interruptions
There will be no reductions to the bevacizumab dose.  If adverse events occur 
that require holding bevacizumab, the dose will remain the same once treatment 
resumes. Adverse events requiring delays or permanent discontinuation of 
bevacizumab are listed in Table 1 below. Regardless of the reason for holding 
study drug treatment, the maximum allowable length of treatment interruption is 
4 weeks; the only exception to this is for a surgical procedure in a patient who is 
benefiting from treatment.
5.2.[ADDRESS_1036667] medical practice and should be based 
on the NCI’s Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE 
v. 4.0).  Discontinuation of bevacizumab will have no immediate therapeutic 
effect.  Bevacizumab has a terminal half-life of 21 days; therefore, its 
discontinuation results in slow elimination over several months.  There is no 
available antidote for bevacizumab.

Version date:  February 6, 2019 - 20 -Subjects should be assessed clinically for toxicity prior to, during, and after each 
infusion.  If unmanageable toxicity occurs because of bevacizumab at any time 
during the study, treatment with bevacizumab should be discontinued. 
Infusion of bevacizumab should be interrupted for subjects who develop dyspnea 
or clinically significant hypotension. Subjects who experience a grade 3 or 4 
allergic reaction/hypersensitivity, adult respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], or 
bronchospasm (regardless of grade) will be discontinued from bevacizumab 
treatment.
All AEs – including all out of range laboratory values – should be recorded as on 
the appropriate eCRF as outlined in Section 10.  Abnormal laboratory tests and 
other objective measures that meet the criteria for an SAE or result in 
discontinuation of the trial drug should be reported as outlined in Section 10. All

Version date:  February 6, [ADDRESS_1036675] at the next regular scheduled MRI, the 
response will still be recorded based on the prior scan, but will be designated as a 
non-sustained response. If the response is sustained (is still present on the 
subsequent MRI), it will be recorded as a sustained response, lasting until the 
time of tumor progression. Best response is unknown if the patient does not 
qualify for a best response or increasing disease and if all objective status 
determinations before progression are unknown.
6.3 Assessment  of Secondary Endpoints
6.3.1 Progression-free  survival (PFS)
PFS will be defined as the time from the first study treatment to the first 
occurrence of progression or death up to [ADDRESS_1036676] observation of progressive disease, non-reversible neurologic 
progression or increasing steroid requirements (applies to SD only), death due to 
any cause, or early discontinuation of treatment. This will be assessed based on 
MRI or CT scans.
6.3.3 Duration of response
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria 
are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that 
recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference 
for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment 
started). Duration of stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment 
until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started. 
6.3.4 Overall  survival (OS)
Overall survival will be calculated from date of first dose of bevacizumab to the 
date of death.  
Note: As of December 31, 2018, patients will no longer be followed and 
follow
 up information will not be collected.
6.3.5 Evaluation  of toxicity/safety data
All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment 
with bevacizumab. Adverse events will be assessed prior to the start of every 
cycle.

8.1 Bevacizumab
8.1.1 Other  names
Avastin®, rhuMAb VEGF, RO4876646
8.1.2 Classification/type  of agent
Bevacizumab is a vascular endothelial growth factor-specific angiogenesis 
inhibitor. The structure consists of human IgG1 framework regions and antigen-
binding complementary-determining regions from a murine monoclonal antibody
8.1.3 Mode of action
Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized immunoglobulin G (IgG1) 
monoclonal antibody that binds VEGF, a secreted factor that regulates 
angiogenesis. Bevacizumab prevents the interaction of VEGF with its receptors 
and neutralizes the biological activity of VEGF. Many human tumors have been 
shown to have increased VEGF gene expression, when compared to normal 
surrounding tissues. Bevacizumab has been shown to inhibit in vivo growth of a 
variety of human tumors, providing proof of preclinical efficacy and the role of 
VEGF in oncogenesis. For further details and molecule characterization, please 
refer to the bevacizumab Investigator Brochure.
8.1.4 Storage and stability
Upon receipt of the study drug, vials are to be refrigerated at 2 C–8 C (36F–
46F) and should remain refrigerated until just prior to use. DO NOT FREEZE.  
DO NOT SHAKE.   Vials should be protected from light. Opened vials must be 
used within [ADDRESS_1036679] be administered within 8 hours.
8.1.5 Dose specifics
Patients will receive bevacizumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (1 cycle 
= 28 days/4 weeks). It is not necessary to correct dosing based on ideal weight.
8.1.6 Preparation
Bevacizumab is a clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to pale brown, sterile 
liquid concentrate for solution for intravenous (IV) infusion. Bevacizumab may 
be supplied in 5-cc (100-mg) and 20-cc (400-mg) glass vials containing 4 mL 
and 16 mL of bevacizumab, respectively (all at 25 mg/mL). Vials contain 
bevacizumab with phosphate, trehalose, polysorbate 20, and Sterile Water for 
Injection (SWFI), USP. Vials contain no preservative and are suitable for single 
use only. Bevacizumab should be diluted in a total volume of 100 mL of 0.9 
Sodium Chloride Injection, USP.  
8.1.7 Protocol  administration

disturbance of organ function may occur.
Bevacizumab  may also block VEGF. VEGF is important for the 
formation of new blood vessels at sites of low blood flow. Low blood 
flow exists in conditions such as coronary artery disease and 
cerebrovascular disease (abnormality of the brain resulting from blood 
vessel problems). Prolonged blockage of VEGF with bevacizumab could 
worsen any pre-existing heart or cerebrovascular disease.
The impact of bevacizumab on future fertility is currently unknown.  
However, it is possible that treatment with bevacizumab may affect 
fertility and decrease the likelihood of becoming pregnant in the future.
9STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
9.[ADDRESS_1036682] 9 patients, it could be concluded that the true 
response rate was 5% or less and no further patients would be enrolled. If one or more 
responses are observed in the first stage, a total of 24 evaluable patients would be 
required. If three or more responses are observed, there would be evidence that the 
regimen used was active (true response rate is at least 25%). The primary endpoint will 
be objective radiographic tumor response.  Secondary endpoints include progression-free 
survival at 6 months, time to progression, time to response, duration of response, overall 
survival, and safety.
9.2 Sample  Size & Power Calculations
A Simon two-stage optimal phase II clinical trial design will be used. If [ADDRESS_1036683] 9 patients, it will be concluded that the true response rate was 5% or 
less and no further patients will be enrolled. If [ADDRESS_1036684] 9 patients, 15 additional patients will be enrolled to a total of 24. If 3 or more 
responses are observed, there would be evidence that the regimen used was active (true 
response rate is at least 25%). This design will declare the regimen as active when the 
true response rate is 25% with 90% probability (power=.90) at the 1-sided 0.[ADDRESS_1036685] 24 evaluable 
patients.
9.3 Planned Analyses
The primary outcome, radiographic response rate, will be estimated using the Atkinson 
and Brown confidence limits (new reference).   To estimate time to progression, 
progression-free survival and overall survival, Kaplan-Meier curves will be calculated.  
PFS6 will be determined from the progression-free survival curve.   Time to response in 
responders will be estimated using a Kaplan-Meier curve.  Duration of response in 
responders will be estimated as the time from response to progression, and will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics such as median and range.  Safety data will be 
summarized using frequencies and percentages, and adverse events will be characterized 
by [CONTACT_24975], frequency, timing of occurrence and attribution.  Changes in FACT-BR while on 
treatment will be analyzed using a longitudinal linear model that estimates the mean level 
at specific times, or a population averaged mean FACT-BR as a function of time.
10 ADVERSE  EVENTS
IRB #: STU00080404-MOD0020 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 2/18/2019 through 4/1/2019.
NU 12C06
Version date:  February 6, 2019 - 34 -This trial will be conducted in accordance with the Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) of the 
Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center (Lurie Cancer Center) of Northwestern University 
(see Appendices for link).  The level of risk attributed to this study requires High Intensity 
Monitoring, as outlined in the DSMP. In addition, the study will abide by [CONTACT_360610], as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations.
10.1 Adverse  Event Monitoring
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical 
trial, are done to ensure the safety of subjects enrolled in the studies as well as those who 
will enroll in future studies using similar agents. Adverse events are reported in a routine 
manner at scheduled times during a trial (see Section 7 and the study calendar for time 
points). In addition, certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited manner to 
allow for optimal monitoring and patient safety and care. 
All patients experiencing an adverse event, regardless of its relationship to study drug, 
will be followed until: 
• the  adverse event resolves or the symptoms or signs that constitute the 
adverse event return to baseline; 
• any  abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline; 
• there  is a satisfactory explanation other than the study drug for the changes 
observed; or
• death.
The study period during which all AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) must be 
reported begins after informed consent is obtained and initiation of study treatment any 
study procedures and ends [ADDRESS_1036686] administration of study treatment or 
study discontinuation/termination, whichever is earlier. After this period, investigators 
should only report SAEs that are attributed to prior study treatment.
10.2 Definitions  & Descriptions
10.2.[ADDRESS_1036687] a causal relationship with this treatment. An 
AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporarily associated with the use of 
an experimental intervention, whether or not related to the intervention.
Recording of AEs should be done in a concise manner using standard, acceptable 
medical terms. In general, AEs are not procedures or measurements, but should 
reflect the reason for the procedure or the diagnosis based on the abnormal 
measurement. Preexisting conditions that worsen in severity or frequency during 
the study should also be recorded (a preexisting condition that does not worsen is 
not an AE). Further, a procedure or surgery is not an AE; rather, the event 
leading to the procedure or surgery is considered an AE.
If a specific medical diagnosis has been made, that diagnosis or syndrome should 
be recorded as the AE whenever possible.  However, a complete description of 
the signs, symptoms and investigations which led to the diagnosis should be 
provided. For example, if clinically significant elevations of liver function tests

Version date:  February 6, 2019 - 35 -are known  to be secondary to hepatitis, “hepatitis” and not “elevated liver 
function tests” should be recorded. If the cause is not known, the abnormal test or 
finding should be recorded as an AE, using appropriate medical terminology (e/g/ 
thrombocytopenia, peripheral edema, QT prolongation).
This includes the following:
AEs  not previously observed in the subject that emerge during the 
protocol-specified AE reporting period, including signs or symptoms 
associated with solid tumor brain metastases that were not present prior 
to the AE reporting period.
Complications  that occur as a result of protocol-mandated interventions.
If  applicable, AEs that occur prior to assignment of study treatment 
associated with medication washout, no treatment run-in, or other 
protocol-mandated interventions.
Preexisting medical conditions (other than the condition being studied) 
judged by [CONTACT_108975]-specified AE reporting period.
10.2.2 Severity of AEs
All adverse events will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03 available at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html.
If no CTCAE grading is available, the severity of an AE is graded as follows:
• Mild (grade 1): the event causes discomfort without disruption of normal daily 
activities.
• Moderate  (grade 2): the event causes discomfort that affects normal daily 
activities.
• Severe  (grade 3): the event makes the patient unable to perform normal daily 
activities or significantly affects his/her clinical status.
• Life-threatening  (grade 4): the patient was at risk of death at the time of the 
event.
• Fatal (grade 5): the event caused death.
10.2.3 Causality of AEs
Expected AEs are those adverse events that are listed or characterized in the 
current Investigator Brochure (IB). Unexpected AEs are those not listed in the 
current IB or not identified. This includes adverse events for which the 
specificity or severity is not consistent with the description in the IB. For 
example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected if the IB 
only referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.
The relationship of an AE to the study drug(s) should be defined as 
unrelated, unlikely, possibly, probably, or definitely related.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Related

[IP_ADDRESS] Unlikely
A causal relationship is improbable and another documented 
cause of the AE is most plausible.

documented cause of the AE is most plausible.
10.2.4 Serious  Adverse Event (SAE)
All SAEs, regardless of attribution, occurring from time of signed informed 
consent,
 through [ADDRESS_1036688] medical occurrence that at any dose results in one of the 
following outcomes:
Results  in death.
If death results from (progression of) the disease, the disease should be 
reported as event (SAE) itself.
Is  life-threatening.
The patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer 
to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe.
Requires  in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9959] ≥ 24 hours.
Results  in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.
Is  a congenital anomaly/birth defect.
Is  an important medical event .
Any event that does not meet the above criteria, but that in the judgment 
of the investigator jeopardizes the patient, may be considered for 
reporting as a serious adverse event. The event may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the 
definition of “Serious Adverse Event“. 
For example: allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency
 room or at home; convulsions that may not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; development of drug abuse or drug dependency.
10.2.5 Exceptions  to AE & SAE Definitions
Generally speaking, any adverse event that results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_757216], as described 
above.  Likewise, any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as 
an AE if the condition meets the criteria for an AE.  However, for the purposes of 
IRB #: STU00080404-MOD0020 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 2/18/2019 through 4/1/2019.
NU 12C06
Version date:  February 6, 2019 - 37 -this study, neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor 
surgery are reported as AEs or SAEs under the following circumstances:
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_757217] a diagnostic or 
elective surgical procedure for a preexisting condition.  Surgery should 
not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the purpose of the 
surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_757218].
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_757219]-
directed therapy of the target disease of the study, unless it is a 
worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_757220].
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_757221] (i.e. 
awaiting transport home).
10.2.[ADDRESS_1036689] or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961])
In order for an adverse event to be reported to the Northwestern University 
IRB, it must qualify as a UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961].  In order to qualify as a UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961], the 
event must meet ALL three of the following criteria:  
Is  unanticipated in terms of nature, severity, or frequency
Places the research subject or others at a different or greater risk of harm
Is  deemed to be at least possibly related to participation in the study.   
10.3 Procedures  for Eliciting & Recording AEs
10.3.[ADDRESS_1036690] evaluation timepoints 
should be adopted. Examples of non-directive questions include:
“How  have you felt since your last clinical visit?”
“Have  you had any new or changed health problems since you were 
last here?”
All AEs and SAEs whether volunteered by [CONTACT_423], discovered by [CONTACT_45949], or detected through physical examination, 
laboratory test, or other means will be reported appropriately. Each reported AE 
or SAE will be described by [CONTACT_13662] (i.e., start and end dates), regulatory 
seriousness criteria if applicable, suspected relationship to bevacizumab (see 
following guidance), and actions taken.
To ensure consistency of AE and SAE causality assessments, investigators 
should apply the following general guideline:
Yes
There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the AE and 
administration of bevacizumab, and the AE cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_1560]’s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; and/or the 
AE follows a known pattern of response to bevacizumab; and/or the AE abates or 
resolves upon discontinuation of bevacizumab or dose reduction and, if 
applicable, reappears upon re-challenge.
IRB #: STU00080404-MOD0020 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 2/18/2019 through 4/1/2019.
NU 12C06
Version date:  February 6, 2019 - 38 -No
Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than bevacizumab (e.g., 
preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or 
concomitant medication); and/or the AE has no plausible temporal relationship to 
bevacizumab administration (e.g., cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_1036691] dose of 
study drug).
Expected adverse events are those adverse events that are listed or characterized 
in the Package Insert or current Investigator Brochure (IB). 
Unexpected adverse events are those not listed in the package insert or current IB 
or not identified. This includes adverse events for which the specificity or 
severity is not consistent with the description in the package insert or IB For 
example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected if the 
package insert or IB only referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.
10.3.[ADDRESS_1036692] medical terminology/concepts when reporting 
AEs or SAEs. Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.
[IP_ADDRESS] Diagnosis  vs. Signs & Symptoms
If known at the time of reporting, a diagnosis should be reported rather 
than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or 
hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases). 
However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be 
medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of 
reporting, it is ok to report the information that is currently available. If a 
diagnosis is subsequently established, it should be reported as follow-up 
information.
10.3.2.2Deaths
All deaths that occur during the protocol-specified AE reporting period, 
regardless of attribution, will be reported to the appropriate parties (see 
10.4). When recording a death, the event or condition that caused or 
contributed to the fatal outcome should be reported as the single medical 
concept. If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at 
the time of reporting, report “Unexplained Death.”
10.3.2.3Preexisting Medical Conditions
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the start of the 
study. Such conditions should be reported as medical and surgical 
history. A preexisting medical condition should be re-assessed 
throughout the trial and reported as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, 
severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study. When 
reporting such events, it is important to convey the concept that the 
preexisting condition has changed by [CONTACT_9672] 
(e.g., “more frequent headaches”).

Version date:  February 6, [ADDRESS_1036693] dose of study drug, a report 
should be completed and expeditiously submitted to the appropriate 
parties, including Genentech, Inc. Follow-up to obtain the outcome of the 
pregnancy should also occur. Abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, 
or spontaneous, should always be classified as serious, and expeditiously 
reported as an SAE. Similarly, any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a 
child born to a female subject exposed to bevacizumab should be 
reported as an SAE.
10.3.2.6Post-Study  AEs
The investigator should expeditiously report any SAE occurring after a 
subject has completed or discontinued study participation if attributed to

Version date:  February 6, 2019 - 52 -14.2 Appendix  II – [LOCATION_001] Heart Association (NYHA) Guidelines
The Stages of Heart Failure – NYHA Classification
In order to determine the best course of of therapy, physicians often assess the stage of heart failure 
according to the [LOCATION_001] Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification system. This system 
relates symptoms to everyday activities and the patient's quality of life.
Class Patient Symptoms
Class I (Mild)No limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does not cause 
undue fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], or dyspnea (shortness of breath).
Class II (Mild)Slight limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest, but ordinary 
physical activity results in fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], or dyspnea.
Class III (Moderate)Marked limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest, but less than 
ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], or dyspnea.
Class IV (Severe)Unable to carry out any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of 
cardiac insufficiency at rest. If any physical activity is undertaken, 
discomfort is increased.

NU 12C06
Version date:  February 6, 2019 - 53 -14.3 Appendix  III – Procedures for Obtaining a Urine Protein
1) Obtain  at least 4 ml of a random urine sample (does not have to be a 24 hour urine) 
2) Determine  protein concentration (mg/dL) 
3) Determine  creatinine concentration (mg/dL) 
4) Divide  #2 by #3 above: urine protein / creatinine ratio = protein concentration (mg /dL) / creatinine 
concentration (mg /dL)
The UPC directly correlates with the amount of protein excreted in the urine per 24 hrs (i.e. a UPC of 1 
should be equivalent to 1g protein in a 24hr urine collection)
                                           
Protein and creatinine concentrations should be available on standard reports of urinalyses, not dipsticks. 
If protein and creatinine concentrations are not routinely reported at an Institution, their measurements 
and reports may need to be requested.

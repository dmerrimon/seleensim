1. Background and Rationale 
Kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients 
and is associated with increased quality of life and reduced mortality compared with dialysis.  
Nearly 17,[ADDRESS_628425] of the calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) 
cyclosporine A (CsA) and tacrolimus.  These agents are associated with long-ter m renal toxicity 
and increase cardiovascular risk factors, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and 
hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]. 
 
The development of belatacept (trade name [CONTACT_489088]), a member of a novel class of 
immunosuppressive medications known as selective T-c ell costimulation blocking agents, 
represents a major advance in targeted immunosuppressive therapy.  Immunosuppressive 
therapy with belatacept has been shown to improve renal function and has a favorable 
metabolic profile compared with CNIs.  The mechanis m of action of belatacept is more selective 
than that of previous immunosuppressants and its effect more specific; in animal models, belatacept more effectively blocks humoral responses that can lead to chronic injury and renal 
failure.  During the Belatac ept Evaluation of Nephroprotection and Efficacy as First-line 
Immunosuppression Trial (BENEFIT), the overall incidence and severity of acute rejection was higher in patients treated with belatacept compared to the CsA treatment group; however, renal 
functi on as measured by [CONTACT_489073] (cGFR) was up to 10 cc/min 
higher in the belatacept treatment group, which suggests that long-term graft survival and renal 
function may be improved compared to CsA (Vincenti F. et al AJT 2012). 
 
Belatacept immunosuppressive therapy was implemented in the Emory Transplant Center 
(ETC) beginning in August of 2011.  Current dosing protocol requires post -transplant kidney 
patients who are treated with belatacept to receive an infusion every [ADDRESS_628426] of infusions, the limited capacity of the sites 
administering infusions, and inconvenience to patients. Definitive c linical evidence is lacking for 
equivalent treatment outcomes for patients who receive infusions at one month (q- 1M) intervals 
versus every two month (q-2M)  intervals. Data from five year (Vincenti F, Blancho G, Durrbach 
A et al. J Am Soc Nephrol 2010) and ten year (personal communication, CP Larsen) follow up of 
the phase II clinical studies suggest that there are no significant differences in the patient 
outcomes for q -1Mversus q-2 Mdosing intervals.  However, conclusions regarding differential 
Belatacept Q -1Month vs Q 2 Month Intervals  
Version 5.0  Version Date: 10JUL2018  Page [ADDRESS_628427] therapy in all eligible patients ( Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) positive, etc). We have 
performed almost [ADDRESS_628428] 2011 and the present (May  2015). Based on 
this clinical volume and hi gh rate of belatacept use, we propose to screen approximately [ADDRESS_628429]-randomization is the same for patients who receive 
belatacept at q-4 and q-8 dosing interval s. 
   
2.2 Secondary Objective 
• Assessing the incidence and severity of acute rejection [ADDRESS_628430] 
randomization 
• Assessing the total cost associated with q -1M and q-2M dosing intervals  
• Assessing the incidence of infection in the q -1M and q-2M patient groups  
• Assessing the incidence of death and graft loss at 6 and 12 months  
• Assessing the incidence of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies at randomization and at 6 and 12 months  
• Assessing the frequency of clinic visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and transpl ant biopsies in the 
two patient groups  
 
3. Assessment of Efficacy 
3.1 Primary Outcome Measure 
• This study will compare the primary outcome of mean eGFR between the standard q -1M 
control group and the q -2M treatment group, with the hypothesis that mean eGFR will not 
vary between the groups by [CONTACT_726] a pre-specified acceptable difference, or 
equivalence margin. Difference in eGFR between the q -1M and q-2M treatment groups 
will be assessed monthly .

Version 5.0  Version Date: 10JUL2018  Page 4 
 3.2 Secondary Outcome Measures 
• The secondary outcome measure of rejection, death, graft lost, and HLA antibody 
production will be assessed at 6 and 12 months.  
• Total cost, number of clinic visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and biopsies will be assessed at 12 
months.  
3.3 Safety  
Patient safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_489074], 
infection s, malignancies, morbidity, renal function, and rejection.  
 
4. Safety Assessments 
4.1 Adverse Events 
During the study, safety assessments will include: 
• Incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events, malignancies, opportunistic 
infections, and premature withdrawal due to adverse events  
• Patient and Graft loss  
• Changes in immunosuppressive regimen  
 
4.2 Dose Adjustments of Concomitant Immunosuppression  
Dose adjustment of mycophenolate mofetil  or azathioprine (due to leucopenia or gastrointestinal 
toxicity) , and prednisone may occur at the discretion of the investigator based on clinical 
indication. 
4.[ADDRESS_628431] these laboratory studies . Abnormal laboratory values will be 
addressed by [CONTACT_489075]/operating procedures; that is through the patient’s post-
transplant coordinator, transplant nephrologist and/or primary nephrologist. These values will be 
monitored until they return to patient’s baseline or other explanation is given 
4.3.2 Biobanking and Mechanistic Studies 
Samples for biobanking and mechanistic assays (e.g. CD86 saturation and bel atacept peak and 
trough levels) will be drawn at specified intervals  (see schedule of events)  and stored by [CONTACT_489076]. Given the possibility of the need for biological samples 
for unanticipated current, new and future immunologic assays, s amples for this purpose may 
also be drawn at other  times during the study period on select patients and will also be stored in 
the ETC biorepository. All  samples will be used for assays performed by [CONTACT_489077] -Myers Squibb. Banking of thes e samples is for purposes of this study, but may be used

Version 5.0  Version Date: 10JUL2018  Page [ADDRESS_628432] the option of requesting for the 
destruction of their samples if desired.  
In general, the volume of blood donated for this study wil l be 4 0 mL or 3 mL/kg, whichever is 
less, for each time point. Under circumstances where the needs of a specific assay require 
larger amounts (e.g. multiple planned assays), a larger blood volume will be considered, up to a 
maximum of 150 mL for any single phlebotomy session and not to exceed 3mL/kg. The total 
amount of blood drawn will not exceed 450 mL, or 7mL/kg whichever is less, over any 6-week period in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_489062].

6.0 Safety Issues 
Adverse events will be monitored and documented for the duration of the study and for 30 days 
after study completion. 
6.1 Women of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)  
Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female 
after conception and until the termination of gestation. A spot urine pregnancy test will be 
performed only on WOCBP after the patient is enrolled in the study. If the spot urine pregnancy 
test is positive, it will be, confirmed by a serum human chorionic gonadotrophin laboratory test. 
A positive serum pregnancy test  (>5 mIU/mL) will exclude a female patient from participation in 
this study.

Version 5.0  Version Date: 10JUL2018  Page [ADDRESS_628434] any adverse events that may occur 
as a result of blood draws specifically done for the study.  
 
6.3 Rejection 
 The occurrence of rejection requires special consideration:  
 
• In the standard of care q-1M dosing group, any grade of rejection will be treated in 
accordance to our established ETC protocol for the treatment of rejection ( Appendix 1).  
• In the treatment arm, q -2M dosing group, any grade of rejection will be treated in 
accordance to our established ETC protocol for the treatment of rejection ( Appendix 1). 
However, depending on the grade of rejection, study subjects will either remain in the q-
2M treatment group or be converted over to the standard of care q 1M  group. 
o If the rejection is graded as borderline or 1A: the patient w ill remain in the q -2M 
treatment arm with close follow up and surveillance consistent with routine practice. 
o If the rejection grade is 1B or greater, then the patient will be converted back to 
q-1M standard of care dosing but will remain in the study. 
o If the rejection is antibody mediated rejection ( AMR ), then the patient will be 
converted back to q -1M standard of care dosing but will remain in the study.  
 
Rejection Grade  Group  
 Q-1M Q-2M 
Borderline or 1A  Remain in Q-1M Remain in Q-2M 
1B or Greater  Remain  in Q-1M Convert to Q-1M 
AMR  Remain in Q-1M Convert to Q-1M 
 
 
6.4 Severity  
Belatacept Q -1Month vs Q 2 Month Intervals  
Version 5.0  Version Date: 10JUL2018  Page 7 
 Severity of the adverse event will be defined as follows:  
Mild – Discomfort noticed but no disruption of normal daily activity  
Moderate – Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affec t daily activity  
Severe – Inability to work or perform normal daily activity  
Life Threatening –  Represents an immediate threat to life.  
 
6.5 Determination of Relationship of Adverse Event to Belatacept  Dosing 
There will be three categories of possible relationship between the adverse event and 
belatacept dosing. Determination of drug-relatedness of the adverse event to belatacept dosing 
will be determined by [CONTACT_093].  
 
Possible (must have first two)  
A possible relationship will be assigned to an ad verse event when the connection with 
belatacept administration appears unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty. An adverse 
event will be considered possible if:  
1. It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of belatacept  
2. It c annot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject 
3. It follows a known pattern of response to belatacept  
Remote (must have first two)  
An adverse event will be considered remote if: 
1. It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of belatacept  
2. It may readily have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject.  
3. It does not follow a known pattern of response to belatacept . 
4. It does not reappear or worsen when belatacept  is re-administered.  
Unrelated 
An adverse event will be considered unrelated if it is judged to be clearly and incontrovertibly 
due only to extraneous causes such as disease, environment, etc. while not meeting the criteria 
for drug relationship as listed above for remote, possible, or probable.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_628435] one of the following criteria:  
• Is fatal (results in death);  
• Is life-threatening;  
• Requires in- patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72010];  
• Results in persistent or signifi cant disability/incapacity; 
Belatacept Q -1Month vs Q 2 Month Intervals  
Version 5.0  Version Date: 10JUL2018  Page 8 
 • Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• Is medically significant or requires intervention to prevent one or other of the outcomes 
listed above. 
The clinical judgment of the investigator shall be used in deciding whether a certain situation 
may warrant consideration as a serious adverse event but may not meet the above criteria. This 
medical event may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_489063].  
6.7 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
All adverse events considered serious , and unexpected shall be reported to  
• Emory University IRB within 10 business days  if unanticipated and r elated to Belatacept 
• DSMB within 7 days

 DSMB meetings will be held via teleconference.  
Written DSMB reports will be issued following each data review. These reports will  be forwarded 
to the IRB for review with protocol renewals. 
 
7. Study design and methods 
After randomization into either the q-1M or q-2M dosing groups, belatacept will be administered 
at a dose of 5 mg/kg, the same dose the patient was taking at the beginning of the study. The 
visit window for the q1M group will be per standard of care and the visit window for the q2M group will be +/- [ADDRESS_628439] lab tests every two weeks starting at 
week 4 of the study (the first time point when the q -1M patients receive belatacept and theq -2M 
patients do not).  The q -2M group will have labs performed every two weeks from week 4 
through week 16. With the exception of every two week labs for the q -2M group from week 4 
through week 16 and frequency of belatacept administration, both groups of patients will be 
treated the same in all ways. Labs will be monthly otherwise. For study purposes, patients will 
receive a chemistry profile at every lab draw and antibody assessment (PRA/DSA)  labs at 
enrollment, and [ADDRESS_628440] 
study patients.  
8. Study Population 
The trial population consists of adult s ≥[ADDRESS_628441]-time transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_489065]. Patients of all races and ethnicities will 
be included.  
 
This is an intention to treat, randomized, controlled trial. There will be a total of 166 subjects, 
randomized in equal numbers, 83 patients in each arm. We anticipate needing to consent/enroll  
200 patients  to achieve 166 randomized subjects accounting for an approximate 15% screen 
failure rate.  All patients will be actively followed in the study for [ADDRESS_628442] given informed written consent will be 
included in this study.

 9. Study Procedures and Assessments 
See Appendix 3.  
 
10. Statistical Analysis  
All analyses will be conducted on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population.  The distribution of continuous outcome measures will be examined, and non-parametric equivalents of the two-
sample t-test will be us ed to assess the statistical significance of non-normally distributed 
outcomes. 
 
Statistical significance of the mean difference in eGFR between the q-[ADDRESS_628448] statistic.  The incidence of clinically suspected or biopsy -proven acute rejection (and date of 
acute rejection) will be collected based upon final ETC biopsy -proven acute rejection.  We will 
describe acute rejection rates at [ADDRESS_628449] used to assess statistical significance. 
 
The incidenc e of HLA donor specific antibodies (DSA) (e.g. presence or absence of HLA DSA) 
at [ADDRESS_628450] statistic. The frequenc y of clinic 
visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and transplant biopsies will be calculated for each patient and descriptive 
statistics (e.g. mean and standard deviation) reported by [CONTACT_1570].  Differences in the 
frequency of these outcomes at [ADDRESS_628451] associated with roundtrip travel to the ETC will be estimated using 
the distance between the residential addresses of subjects and the ETC. Statistically significant 
differences in the preceding secondary endpoints will be assessed using the two-sample 
Belatacept Q -1Month vs Q 2 Month Intervals  
Version 5.0  Version Date: 10JUL2018  Page [ADDRESS_628452] statistic to compare the proportions of missed infusion 
appointments between the q -1M and q-2M dosing treatment groups.  
 
Equivalence testing is used to assess whether “practical equivalence” of the outcome of interest 
has been achieved between two groups.  This study will compare the primary outcome of mean 
eGFR between the standard q -1M control group and the q -2M treatment group, with the 
hypothesis that mean eGFR will not vary between the groups by [CONTACT_726] a pre-specified acceptable difference, or equivalence margin.  In the context of equivalence testing, statistical 
power represents the probability of detecting a difference at least as large as the equivalence 
margin. 
 
The mean eGFR at one year post-transplant for patients receiving belatacept at the Emory 
Transplant Center has been found to be 60.2 ml/min/1.[ADDRESS_628453] devi ation of 14.5 
ml/min/1.73 m2.  When patients with an eGFR less than or equal to 35 ml/min/1.[ADDRESS_628454]-transplant has been found to be 61.5 ml/min/1.[ADDRESS_628455] deviation of 13.1 ml/min/1.73 m2.  Based on this inclusion criterion, the table 
below details several scenarios of potential sample size for different equivalence margins in 
order to attain 80% power for a significance level (alpha) of 0.05. 
 
Calculated GFR is a continuous variable and will be assess ed at monthly intervals (increasing to 
every two weeks from week 4 to 16 in the q -2M group) throughout the study.  The secondary 
time points of rejection, death, graft lost, and HLA antibody production will be assessed at [ADDRESS_628456] deviation of 13.1 ml/min/1.73 m2:

Version 5.0  Version Date: 10JUL2018  Page [ADDRESS_628461] -Transplant Ki dney Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]: 
Comparison of every 1 month  and every 2 month  Dosing Intervals study.  
Introduction :  This charter describes the roles and responsibilities of the Board.  
Organization : The DSMB is an external expert group which, on a regular basis, reviews accumulating 
study data, evaluates the treatments for excess adverse effects, determines whether the basic study 
assumptions remain valid, judges whether the overall integrity and conduct of the study remain 
acceptable, and makes recommendations to the principal investigator.  
Composition :  The DSMB members are selected by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_489069] 3 voting 
members:  
[CONTACT_223442] E. Kokko, (DSMB Chair) nephrologist and Associate Division Director of 
Nephrology, University of Mississippi  
[INVESTIGATOR_124]. Avinash Agarwal, transplant surgeon and Assistant Professor of Surgery, University of 
Virginia  
[CONTACT_489089] A . Dar, transplant surgeon and Assistant Professor of Surgery, Division of 
Immunology and Organ Transplantation, The University of [LOCATION_007] Health Science Center at 
Houston 
DSMB members are independent, neither participating in the study as investigators nor having any other 
conflicts of interest (e.g. financial) with either the study sponsor or an intellectual conflict, such as 
participation in a leadership position in a similar outcome study.  
Roles and Responsibilities :  The independent DSMB will monitor the  study safety on a regular basis 
accumulating safety data with the first meeting to occur prior to first patient enrollment. and will evaluate the safety parameters of the ongoing study [ADDRESS_628462] patient enrollment and then every 6 months 
and at  completion of the study. The frequency of the DSMB may be increased, for example, when safety 
issues arise.  
Goal : The DSMB is independent of all aspects of the trial. The major role is to monitor on a  regular basis 
the continuing safety of subjects parti cipating in the study. The DSMB is  an independent body.  
The DSMB will: 
• Protect the welfare of the patient.  
• Monitor interim safety data.  
• Identify safety issues and suggest solutions regarding study design and conduct.  
• Review the study protocol and any protocol amendments 
• Review the methods of data collection and safety monitoring making recommendations 
for additions or adjustments to ensure the timely delivery of such data.

Version 5.0  Version Date: 10JUL2018  Page 18 
 • Review and approve the DSMB charter that defines the safety and related parameters to  
be reviewed by [CONTACT_4318], the frequency of DSMB monitoring reviews, methods for 
review, and establish criteria for making recommendations to the principal investigator. 
• Conduct a futility analysis based at the time when approximately 30% of the study 
subje cts complete the 6 -month data collection.  
• Based on the data reviewed at each meeting, the DSMB will advise one of the following actions to the principal investigator:  
• Continue the study according to the protocol and any related amendments.  
• Modify the s tudy protocol. Modifications may include, but are not limited to: changes 
in inclusion/exclusion criteria, frequency of visits or safety monitoring, and alterations in 
study procedures.  
• Discontinue the study overall or end participation in particular subgroup.  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_489070] a whole may be stopped by [CONTACT_489080], such as:  
• Unacceptable delay of study completion, 
• Low recruitment rate,  
• A large number of study participants with premature termination,  
• Changed benefit -risk ratio according to the efficacy and/or safety results from  this or 
parallel studies  
Study enrollment suspended pending expedited review by [CONTACT_489081]:  
• 5 of 10 patients in treatment arm (eve ry 2- Month Belatacept infusion) experience acute 
rejection  
Study enrollment continuation with expedited review by [CONTACT_489081]:  
• 3 of 5 patients in treatment arm (every 2- Month Belatacept infusion) experience acute 
rejection  
 
In case of premature terminati on of the entire study, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_489071]/ appropriate Regulatory 
Authorities are notified within 15 days.  
The Sponsor -Investigator  
The principal investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_489072]:  
• Provide regular updates to the DSMB regarding the trial  progress, including any protocol 
amendments or issues that could potentially affect the safety of the subjects or the overall 
integrity of the study.  
• Document and communicate the decisions to the remainder of the Study Team  for

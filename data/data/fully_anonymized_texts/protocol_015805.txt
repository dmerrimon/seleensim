Evaluate and compare the clinical efficacy of the 
Mediterranean diet to the low -FODMAP diet in 
treating Irritable Bowel Syndrome  
 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] 
 
IRB Approval Date: July 6, 2024  
 
Specific aims  
 Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has a global prevalence of ~10% and up to 80% of patients with IBS report food 
as a trigger for their gastrointestinal symptoms.
1,2 A diet low in fermentable oligo- , di- and monosaccharides  
(LFD) has been shown to improve gastrointestinal symptoms in 50 -60% of patients with IBS3 and a recent 
network meta -analysis found it superior to other dietary approaches in improving abdominal pain and bloating in 
IBS.4 However, the LFD is time -consuming, cumbersome, restrictive, and effective only in about 50% of 
patients.5-7 Thus, there is a need for other dietary strategies that are effective in managing IBS symptoms.  
 
The M editerranean diet  (MD) , a time -honored diet rich in plant- based foods and monounsaturated fat, such as 
olive oil, but low in saturated fats, dairy , and meat,[ADDRESS_865251] on the gut 
microbiota12,13 and microscopic inflammation,14,15 lower intake of saturated fat , and regulation of the gastro -
colonic reflex .16 A population- based, cross -sectional study from Italy found t he presence of IBS in the general 
population to be  associated with low adherence to an MD.17 Furthermore, lower adherence to the MD has been 
associated with more severe abdominal pain and flatulence in patients with IBS .12 However, it is not clear whether 
the lower adherence to MD  causes  more  IBS symptoms or whether patients with IBS are more likely to avoid 
the MD due to worsening symptoms on this diet.  A small, open- label study compared the efficacy of three dietary 
interventions , LFD, gluten -free diet, and MD , in IBS .18 Each patient followed the three diets for 4 weeks  each . All 
three diets reduced symptom severity (p<0.01), abdominal bloating (p<0.01), and abdominal pain (p<0.01) when 
compared to baseline. Interestingly , 86% of patients preferred the Mediterranean diet (p<0.01). Limitations of 
the study include the small sample size, carry -over effects as well as lack of randomization, blinding, or 
assessment of adherence to the diet interventions.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_646188], no randomized 
controlled trial has investigated the efficacy of MD in IBS and MD is not routinely used in managing IBS 
symptoms.  Therefore, there is a need to evaluate the efficacy of MD in managing IBS symptoms. Our overall 
objective is to compare the clinical efficacy of the MD with the LFD in patients with IBS  in a single- center, 
parallel -group, randomized controlled t rial.  
 
I
n this study, we hypothesize that:   
1. LFD and MD groups will achieve a similar improvement in abdominal pain 
2. Both groups will achieve similar improvements in bloating, overall IBS symptom severity , and adequate 
relief  
 
We plan to test our hypotheses and thereby, accomplish the objective of this application by [CONTACT_646200] 
2 specific aims:  
 Aim 1:  Compare the clinical effectiveness of MD vs. LFD by [CONTACT_646201] 2 of the 4 weeks (measured using a decrease in the weekly average of worst 
abdominal pain in the past [ADDRESS_865252] 30% compared with baseline)  
 Aim 2:  Compare the efficacy of M D vs. LFD on pre -specified clinical and disease- specific quality of life endpoints 
in patients with IBS  
 A positive result to the study will have a significant impact on the treatment of patients with IBS by [CONTACT_646202]- based dietary interventions to include MD (the current quality of evidence is 
poor to make any recommendations about MD in IBS). If both the groups have similar clinical efficacy, MD could 
be less cumbersome, less restrictive , and a healthier dietary option for IBS compared to LFD. However, if the 
study shows M D is inferior to LFD in patients with IBS, this study will still be pertinent to patients with IBS  and 
clinician s, given the increasing popularity of MD in the US.  
  
  
 
Significance  
 
I
rritable bowel syndrome (IBS), characterized by [CONTACT_646203] , affects up to 10% of the general population worldwide.[ADDRESS_865253] of symptoms on quality of life is considerable,  with patients willing to accept 
a median 2 % risk of sudden death with a hypothetical medication in return for a 98 % chance of symptom 
cure.[ADDRESS_865254] 20 years produce a therapeutic gain over placebo of only 10% –15% and are expensive.
24 As a result, treatment satisfaction remains poor wit h the majo rity of 
both prescription and over -the-counter  pharmacological options.25  
Patients may, therefore, turn to other approaches. Over 80% of people with IBS report food- related 
symptoms,2 and in one survey 92% of patients with IBS compared to 45% of controls reported dietary changes 
to manage their IBS.[ADDRESS_865255] established its efficacy over habitual diet or other dietary advice such as those by [CONTACT_646204]/National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (BDA/NICE) . A recent network meta -analysis 
found it superior to these two diets  in improving abdominal pain and bloating in IBS.4 However, LFD is time -
consuming, cumbersome, restrictive, and effective in only 50% of patients.5-[ADDRESS_865256]  
that the LFD may be associated with reduced dietary intake of some micronutrients (e.g., iron and thiamine)[ADDRESS_865257] recommended diet for general health by [CONTACT_646205]. I t has been consistently shown to reduce 
the risk of cardiovascular diseases and overall mortality. 9,10 However, its role in managing GI symptoms (if 
any) is not clear. MD is  low in saturated fats and fatty food consumption has been shown to trigger IBS 
symptoms in IBS patients.[ADDRESS_865258] relationship could not be established in 
these studies. In the only intervention study using MD in IBS , an open -label  dietary intervention study  was 
conducted on 28 IBS patients where each patient followed three different diets for 4 weeks each (MD, LFD , 
and gluten- free diet ). MD was found to be as effective as LFD in improving IBS symptoms , and a significantly 
higher number of patients preferred MD over the other two diets.[ADDRESS_865259] of MD on  IBS. Thus, this proposal is significant  because it 
will provide pi[INVESTIGATOR_646189] a single- center, non -inferiority, parallel -
group, randomized controlled trial.    
 I
nnovation:  
Dietar y therapi[INVESTIGATOR_646190]. LFM is t he most 
rigorously investigated dietary intervention in IBS but is effective in only 50% of the patients and is  restrictive, 
time-consuming, expensive, and cumbersome.5-[ADDRESS_865260]:  
 
The overarching goal  of our research team  is to delineate the role of dietary factors in the pathophysiology of 
IBS and develop novel, evidence- based dietary therapi[INVESTIGATOR_646191] . I am currently funded by [CONTACT_133801] K23 CDA to 
delineate the role of FODMAPs in the pathophysiology of IBS -D. With my K23 grant, I have acquired the ability 
to use translational tools such as barrier function assessment, mast cell activation, and microbiome analysis to 
investigate how diet plays a role in generating IBS symptoms using in vivo  and in vitro  models. Delineating the 
mechanisms by [CONTACT_646206]. I am also currently involved in additional diet -based clinical trials as a p rincipal 
investigator or co- investigat or. Furthermore, other co -investigators of the application ([CONTACT_646213] and [CONTACT_646214]) are world- renowned experts in the field of dietary therapi[INVESTIGATOR_646191]. Thus, our research team is the best -
positioned research team to successfully complete this research proposal.  
 
We will obtain data on the clinical efficacy of the MD  in IBS th rough this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. In addition, w e would be 
applying to GI societies (ACG, AGA, ANMS) for additional funding to support the analyses of stool and sera 
samples.  However, we have enough discretionary funds to be able to analyze the stool and sera samples on 
our own (in case society funds are not granted) . Stool collected pre- and post -dietary interventions during this 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_646192] , fermentation indices  (i.e., short -chain and branched- chain 
fatty acid  profiles  as markers of  carbohydrate and protein fermentation), and bile acid profiles. Sera will be 
analyzed for markers of permeability (LPS, LBP, zonulin, etc.) , mast cell activation , and inflammatory 
cytokines. Clinical data  and biospecimens obtained through this pi[INVESTIGATOR_646193]-supported larger, multi- center , non- inferiority, parallel -group,  RCT with the following 
aims:  1) comparing the efficacy of MD vs. LFM i n IBS 2) define predictors of response to LFM vs. MD in IBS 
based on the fecal microbiome and metabolite profiles . 3) delineate mechanisms by [CONTACT_646207] a subset of IBS patients.  
 
P
reliminary data  
 
In the first and the largest US study to date, we conducted an RCT to evaluate the efficacy of an LFD with dietary 
recommendations based on the modified National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (mNICE).25 In this 
study, 92 patients with IBS -D were randomized to either LFD or NICE dietary approaches for 4 weeks. We found 
that patients randomized to an LFD had greater reductions in daily scores of abdominal pain, bloating, stool 
frequency, stool consistency, and urgency than the group randomized to mNICE diet (P<0.05 for each). LFD 
also led to significantly greater improvements in health- related QOL, anxiety, and activity impairment in IBS -D 
compared with the mNICE diet. We have also conducted numerous other clinical trials evaluating diet therapi[INVESTIGATOR_646194] s.35,36  
Recently, we aimed to determine whether it is the cumulative FODMAP consumption or the consumption of 
individual FODMAPs that drives response to the low FODMAP diet via a controlled reintroduction trial.37 
Patients with all IBS subtypes were invited to participate in a 12- week study to determine individual FODMAP 
sensitivities. Eligible patients underwent a 2 -4 week open- label FODMAP elimination period under the direction 
of a research dietitian. If IBS sym ptoms improved (abdominal pain improved by ≥40% com pared to baseline), 
participants were invited to continue to the 10 -week reintroduction phase during which they remained on the 
elimination phase of the low FODMAP diet. FODMAP reintroduction (lactose, fructose, fructans, polyols, 
galactans) was achieved by [CONTACT_646208] a similar appearing and tasting daily supplement (low 
FODMAP brownie bite) which contained additional specific doses of supplemental FODMAPs prepared by 
[CONTACT_646209] a double- blind fashion for participants and investigators. Forty -five patients were enrolled 
in the study and 20 patients who improved with FODMAP elimination continued into the reintroduction phase. All patients who started the reintroduction phase completed the study. Using LME, abdominal pain was worse with fructan challenge (P=0.007), irrespective of the sequence of FODMAP reintroduced. When the analysis 
was restricted to the first reintroduction period, fructan challenge continued to be significantly associated with 
abdominal pain (P=0.03) as was galactan  challenge (P=0.04). Bloating was worse with study period on LME 
(P=0.002) but not with a specific FODMAP challenge. When we restricted the analysis to the first reintroduction 
period, galactan challenge was associated with the worsening of bloating (P=0.03).  
Our group is also interested in understanding the mechanisms of how diet mediates IBS pathophysiology. 
Using rodent models, we have recently shown that a high fodmap diet causes gram -negative dysbiosis 
mediated mast cell activation which in turn leads to barrier dysfunction.[ADDRESS_865261] successfully conducted various diet -based clinical trials and also utilized translational tools to understand 
the role of diet in the pathophysiology of IBS and biomarkers for response.  
 
Research plan:   
 
Patient population  
Patients with IBS diagnosed using ROME IV criteria will be consecutively recruited from outpatient 
gastroenterology and primary care clinics at Michigan Medicine and via online advertisement.   
 
E
ligibility Criteria  
Inclusion criteria  
1. Patients with IBS -D (diarrhea- predominant IBS) or IBS -M (IBS with mixed subtype)  diagnosed per 
Rome IV questionnaire and without any unexplained alarm features (rectal bleeding, weight loss, 
nocturnal symptoms, personal history of celiac disease, microscopic colitis, inflammatory bowel 
disease)  
2. Aged 18- [ADDRESS_865262] daily (in the past 24 hours) abdominal pain score of ≥3.[ADDRESS_865263] 80% compliance in daily questionnaire entries during the [ADDRESS_865264] 6 months  
2. Subjects with a known food allergy to eggs, seafood, peanuts, tree nuts or milk (subjects with lactose 
intolerance who are experiencing IBS symptoms while on a lactose -free diet will not be excluded from 
the study).  
3. Subjects with a history of poorly controlled insulin- dependent or non -insulin -dependent diabetes  
4. Subjects with a known history of organic GI disease (i.e., celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease or 
microscopic colitis) 
5. Subjects with a history of an eating disorder requiring medical or behavioral treatment within the past 
10 years.  
6. Subjects with prior small bowel or colonic surgery (excluding appendectomy or cholecystectomy if over 
6 months since these 2 procedures)  
7. Oral antibiotic use in the past [ADDRESS_865265] doesn't meet all eligibility criteria in the first seven days of the baseline screening period, the screening 
period can be extended up to 21 days. Subjects meeting all eligibility criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive either the MD  or the LFD for a four -week period.  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Diet interventions and delivery:  Patients randomized into the LFD cohort will receive meals and snacks that 
are low in all FODMAP groups (lactose, fructose, polyols, etc.). The diet for the LFD  cohort is essentially a re -
creation of the clinically used restriction phase of the low -FODMAP diet. Patients randomized into the MD  will 
receive meals and snacks that are consistent with an MD (plant -based foods, olive oil, etc.). We and others 
have shown that among the FODMAPs, fructans are the most likely culprit for IBS patients .37,39  To ensure the 
MD group was  not receiving very  high amounts of fructans , we decided to limit the fructan content in the MD 
group to 4 grams/day, the average daily fructan consumption in the general US populat ion.40 This will ensure 
MD diet these patients are receiving is not low in fructan but is not very high either and is close to the US 
general population. Meal Delivery: Three meals and 2 snacks per day (approximate 2000 kcal/day) will be 
shipped several times per week by [CONTACT_646210] . ModifyHealth has agreed to provide us with all the meals for 
every patient for the entire study duration without any cost (beyond this they will not have any role in data 
collection, analysis , and interpretation).  Subjects will be instructed not to eat outside of the food provided and 
extra food shipment for emergency use will be provided at the beginning of the study. Meals for both groups 
will be packaged identically.  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Blinding:  To best ensure the validity of the data collected, as well as the ability to evaluate the efficacy of the 
MD, participants will be blinded to the mechanics and specifics of the diets provided. Participants will know that 
both diets ( the Mediterranean and low FODMAP) may help improve their IBS symptoms but will not know that 
these specific diets are being compared. Instead, participants will be told that the study is investigating two 
different diets for IBS, and they will be receiving eit her Diet A or Diet B,  differing in the types and amounts of 
specific foods provided. Furthermore, study coordinators and investigators from the site will be blinded to which 
diet the participant receives.

Clinical Outcome Measures 
Online questionnaire entries will include the following measures, to be assessed on a frequency according to 
Chart A.    
• A bdominal Pain Intensity: The abdominal pain score is a single- question, 11- point numeric rating scale 
in which [ADDRESS_865266] daily (in the past 24 hours) abdominal pain.  
• Abdominal Discomfort Intensity: The abdominal discomfort score is a single- question, 11- point numeric 
rating scale in which [ADDRESS_865267] daily (in the past 24 hours) 
abdominal discomfort.  
• Abdominal Bloating: The abdominal bloating score is a single- question, [ADDRESS_865268] daily (in the past 24 hours) abdominal bloating 
• Stool Frequency: Subjects will report the number of bowel movements over the previous 24 hours.  
• Stool Form: Subjects will use the Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) to report the form of each bowel movement 
over the previous 24 hours.  
• IBS Medication: Subjects will be asked whether they used an IBS medication over the previous 24 
hours that is not typi[INVESTIGATOR_646195] (i.e., prn antispasmodic, loperamide or laxative).  
• I BS- Adequate Relief: Subjects will provide a binary (yes or no) response to rate the adequacy of relief 
of global IBS symptoms at the start of the study and weekly  thereafter . 
• Quality of Life: Subjects will report quality of life measures specific to IBS using a validated 34 -point 
questionnaire at the start and end of the study.  
• IBS-SSS: Subjects will complete the IBS Symptom Severity Score questionaries at the start of the 
study and weekly  thereafter   
• Non-GI symptoms: non -GI symptoms often associated with IBS including fatigue, “brain fog”, and 
quality of sleep will be assessed at the start and end of the study. Fatigue and brain fog will be scored 
using an 11-point numeric rating scale. Sleep quality will specifically be assessed with the PROMIS 
Sleep questionnaire.  
• Anxiety: Anxiety will be assessed  via GAD -7 score at the start and end of the study.  
• Diet compliance: Patients will fill out the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS), described 
below, to assess their adherence to the Mediterranean diet at the start and end of the study.  Given 
there are  no high- quality, validated questionnaires to assess LFD adherence, a  3-day diet recall will be 
obtained at baseline and at the end of the study which will eventually be reviewed by a registered 
dietitian to confirm adherence to the LFD in the LFD group.

Food diary/log   
Participants will fill out a daily food diary where they will record breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks every day 
for the duration of the study. If they ate the food provided, they would record the food provided. If the meal 
consisted of items not provided by [CONTACT_3019], a detailed log of quantity and ingredients will be obtained.  
 
3-D ay diet recall   
Given there are no high- quality, validated questionnaires to assess LFD adherence, a 3 -day diet recall will be 
obtained at baseline and at the end of the study which will eventually be reviewed by a registered dietitian to 
confirm adherence to the dietary interventions to the allocated arms . 3-day or 24- hour diet recalls are routinely 
done in clinical practice  to confirm adherence to LFD .  
 
Mediterranean Diet Compliance Assessment   
The Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) is a 14 -question adherence tool that has been well 
validated.41-44 The final MEDAS score can range between 0 and 14. For categorization of the adherence to the 
Mediterranean diet , we applied the following criteria: weak adherence, ≤5; moderate to fair adherence, 6– 9; 
good or very good adherence ≥10. Participants will be asked to fill out MEDAS at the beginning of the study 
and again at the end of the study.  
 
B
reath gas  
 
Participants will use a portable breath test device (MedAIRE 2®, FoodMarble Digestive Health Ltd. 
- https://foodmarble.com/GI ) and app to measure exhaled breath hydrogen and methane content. Participants 
will take readings before the first (morning) and last (evening) meal of each day for the duration of the study. 
Breath reading results will not be made available to participant s. All data will be anonymized  and encrypted to 
ensure participant confidentiality and data security.  Patients will not record any identifiers (name, email etc.) in 
the app and this will not be shared with foodmarble. Unique IDs(generated and maintained in secured location 
by [CONTACT_15328])  will be utilized by [CONTACT_646211].  
 
E
ndpoints  
 
Primary Endpoint  
• Abdominal pain intensity – Proportion of patients who would be weekly responders to abdominal pain 
for at least [ADDRESS_865269] 30% compared with baseline.  
 
 
  
 
Secondary Endpoints  
 
• Adequate relief - Proportion of patients who would be weekly responders to adequate relief symptom 
assessment for at least [ADDRESS_865270] 2 out of 4 weeks of the treatment period.  
• IBS-SSS - Proportion of weekly responders  for at least [ADDRESS_865271] 50 points compared with baseline.  
• Bloating - Proportion of patients who would be weekly responders to bloating for at least [ADDRESS_865272] 30% compared with baseline.  
• Stool consistency : Proportion of patients who would be weekly responders to stool consistency 
assessment for at least 2 of the 4 weeks . A stool consistency weekly responder will be defined as a 
50% or greater reduction in the number of days per week with at least one abnormal stool (defined as 
BSS 1 or 2 or 6 or 7)  
 Exploratory endpoints:  
 
• Mean changes in stool frequency, abdominal discomfort, IBS -QoL, anxiety, fatigue, brain fog , and sleep 
quality will be measured before and after the study.  
 
• Stool and sera will be collected during the study and stored for future analyses. The stool  will be stored 
for microbiome analysis , fermentation indices ( short -chain and branched -chain fatty acid profile s), and 
bile acid profile and serum will be stored for analysis of the effect of diets on permeability using 
serological markers such as LPS, LBP, Zonulin, and inflammatory cytokines.  
 
• Changes in breath hydrogen and methane pattern with the dietary interventions  
 
Statistical Analysis  
All continuous variables will be tested for normality using the Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152] -Wilk test. Normally distributed continuous 
data will be presented as mean (+/ - SD) and will be compared pre- and post -dietary interventions using paired 
Student’s t -test. Continuous data which are not normally distributed will be presented as median (range) and 
compared using Wilcoxon signed- rank test. Proportions will be expressed as percentages and compared using 
a chi -square test or fisher exact test as appropriate. As this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_120840], a sample size of 20 
patients will allow us to get data on th e outcomes and non- inferiority margin needed to power the larger Phase 
III multi -centered trial.  
 
Potential difficulties  
One of the potential difficulties might be the difficulty in  patient recruitment for the study. Our group has 
successfully completed several pharmacological and diet -based RCTs in this patient population and has  been 
able to recruit a much larger sample size for previous studies. However, to ensure we can recruit the required 
sample size, we will assign a study coordinator who will dedicate a significant proportion of her/his time to 
recruiting patients from our functional and general GI clinics. Online and on- site advertisements will also be 
utilized to recruit patients from general gastroenterology and primary care clinics. We will further utilize a novel 
digital recruiting tool called “My GI Health” which will identify potential study subjects through social media 
platforms. We feel that this study will be attractive as we will be providing meals for the duration of the study . In 
addition, the lack of a placebo group will ensure that  all participants will receive a potentially beneficial diet 
intervention. Other potential difficulties include patients being non- compliant with the diet. We are providing 
meals to all participants to minimize this and will obtain a daily food log, 3-day recall as well as MEDAS 
(Mediterranean Diet Adherence Scale)  to ensure that our patients are compliant with  their allocated diet arm.  
 
Limitations  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_646196] (i.e. providing the meals and not disclosing the two dietary interventions being compared), 
there is a chance that patients realize what diet they are on. H owever, this risk cannot  be completely eliminated 
in a dietary intervention study. The other limitation is the small sample size of the study. However, this is designed 
to be a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] (and not a definitive study ) which will be utilized to derive the non- inferiority margin and preliminary 
efficacy data for a larger multi -centered study.

  PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  1
 Synopsis  1.1
1.1.1  Rationale for Proposed Clinical Study  
In December 2019, the Wuhan Municipal  Health  Committee identified an outbreak of 
viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause. Coronavirus ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) was 
quickly identified in some of these patients. This novel coronavirus has been 
designated severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (SARS -CoV-2), and the 
disease caused by [CONTACT_780920] 2019  (COVID -
19). There were [ADDRESS_1073542] 16, 2020 according to various international health reporting agencies.  
Hyperimmune intravenous immun oglobulin (hIVIG) to SARS -CoV-2, derived from the 
plasma of individuals who recover and develop neutralizing antibodies, is a  potentially 
useful therapeutic approach to COVID -19. Augmentation of the humoral immune 
(antibody ) response using passive immunotherapy with hIVIG to SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_1073543] of care (SOC),  for preventing further disease progression and mortality 
related to COVID -19. SOC will include remdesivir unless it is contraindicated  for an 
individual patient .  
In future versions of the protocol , one or more drugs from a different class and with 
different mechanism s of action may be studied.  Such treatment s could be studied 
along with hIVIG if it is found effective and safe in this initial version of the protocol.   
The primary endpoint of this trial in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_780872]’s clinical status on  Day 7. It includes  7 mutually exclusive categories  
capturing the range of organ dysfunction  that may be associated with progress ion of 
COVID -19, such as  respi[INVESTIGATOR_780873] -related complications  
(see Appendix  F for full definition) : 
7. Death  
 
6. End-organ failure  
Protocol INSIGHT 013   Version 1.0, 20 Aug 2020  
Inpatient Treatment with  Anti-Coronavirus Immunoglobulin  IND # [ADDRESS_1073544] favorable categories, and the pulmonary only and thrombotic only components 
of the primary ordinal outcome.  Mortality, adverse events  (AEs) , including infusion 
reactions , and  biological correlat es of therapeutic activity  are also assessed . Because 
there is no established endpoint for evaluating the clinical efficacy of treatments for 
COVID -19, other clinically relevant outcomes, including outcomes used in other 
COVID -19 treatment trials, will be recorded . Thus, the randomized groups (initially 
hIVIG + SOC versus  placebo + SOC ) can be compared for multiple outcomes , and 
results can be  compared or combined with other trials.   
Participants  will be randomized  (1:1) to a single infusion of hIVIG  + SOC  or placebo  + 
SOC  on the day of randomization (Day 0) . Participants  taking remdesivir prior to 
randomization may be enrolled  if eligibility criteria are met . Randomized pa rticipants  
who were not taking  remdesivir before randomization will start taking r emdesivir 
immediately following the infusion of hIVIG or placebo  unless remdesivir is 
contraindicated . Participants  will be followed for 28 days  and, if the trial goes to 
completion, the primary analysis will be completed after all participants are followe d 
for 28 days .  
The planned sample size is 500 participants  (250 per group) . After [ADDRESS_1073545] had COVID -19 symptoms ≤ [ADDRESS_1073546] of this trial, the protocol may be modified depending on the strength of the 
trial results and the target population studied.   
Protocol INSIGHT 013   Version 1.0, 20 Aug 2020  
Inpatient Treatment with  Anti-Coronavirus Immunoglobulin  IND # [ADDRESS_1073547] (DSMB) will review  interim data 
and use pre -specified guidelines for early termination of the trial or protocol 
modification . The DSMB will also be consulted concerning pro tocol modifications for 
reasons described above (e.g., sample size re -estimation  or other aspects of the 
design resulting from emerging data).  All protocol modifications will be discussed with 
the independent DSMB.  Protocol amendments will be submitted to ethic s committees  
(ECs)  and a central institutional review board ( IRB) in the [LOCATION_002]  of America 
(US). 
After consent and eligibility has been determined, a single infusion of hIVIG or 
placebo will be administered on the day of randomization (Day 0).  Remdesivir 
infusions will follow th e hIVIG/placebo infusion. Any i nfusion reactions and 
interruption s of the planned hIVIG/placebo infusion  will be recorded.  The ordinal 
outcome  will be assessed throughout follow -up, including on Day 7 for the primary 
endp oint. On Day 0 (pre -hIVIG/placebo infusion ), and on Days  1, 2, 3, 7, and 28, a 
blood sample will be obtained to centrally measure neutralizing antibody levels along 
with total immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentrations  and its subclasses, immunoglobulin 
A (IgA), and immunoglobulin M (IgM); for participants at selected sites an additional 
blood sample for these  measurements will be obtained at Day 90 . Serious Adverse 
Events (SAEs), including deaths from any cause, will be  collected through Day 28.  
hIVIG infusion related events of any grade will be  collected.  Grade 3 and 4 AEs will 
be collected through Day 7.   AEs of any grade experienced on Days 1, 3, 7, and 28 
will be  recorded.  
 INTRODUCTION  2
 Study Rationale  2.1
COVID -19 is a  respi[INVESTIGATOR_19538] a novel coronavirus (SARS -CoV-2). 
While some cases are mild or asymptomatic, progressive disease can result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], requirement for mechanical ventilation, and is a cause  of substantial 
morbidity and mortality .[ADDRESS_1073548] common mode of disease progression is 
progressive respi[INVESTIGATOR_780874], other severe 
complications including thrombosis and ischemia are increasingly recognized .2,3  
There is currently no vaccine to prevent infection with SARS -CoV-2 and no  licensed 
therapeutic agent to treat COVID -19; emergency use authorizations and expanded 
access schemes have been instituted  for certain interventions (including 
convalescent plasma a nd remdesivir, described below) prior to licensure . Several 
clinical trial s utilizing novel drugs and repurposing older agents have been 
implemented  to investigate the treatment of adults hospi[INVESTIGATOR_780875] -
19 (see Section 2.2.7 ).

 Our understanding of the humoral immune response is evolving, with some evidence 
that responses are variable between individual s and delayed in some cases . It may  
therefore  be that viral replication may lead to extensive tissue damage and 
inflammatory response s in the lungs and other organs before the development of 
neutralizing antibodies . Augmentation of the humoral immune  response to SARS -
CoV-2 using passive immunotherapy  with hIVIG to SARS -CoV-2 in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_780876] -organ failure has 
developed may thus reduce the subsequent risk of further disease progression and 
death.   
 Background  2.2
2.2.1  SARS -CoV-2 Infection and Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID -19) 
In December 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health Committee identified an outbreak of 
viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause. A novel coronavirus was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_780877] 2 (SARS -
CoV-2), and the illness caused by [CONTACT_30096] -CoV-2 has been named 
coronavirus  disease 2019 (COVID -19).[ADDRESS_1073549] 14 weeks 
following  the declaration of a pandemic on 11 March 2020 by [CONTACT_780921] (WHO) ,4 there ha ve been  more than 20 million cases diagnosed and 
more than 750,000 deaths across  185 countries.1 Over  100,000 cases continue to be 
reported daily.4 
2.2.2  Natural History of C OVID -19 
SARS -CoV-2 has a median incubation period of 4 days (interquartile range 2 -7 
days)8 and the mean serial interval defined as the time between a primary case -
patient (infector) having symptom onset and a secondary case -patient (infectee) 
having symptom onset for COVID -19 was calculated as 3.96 (95% confidence 
interval [ CI] 3.53–4.39) days.9 COVID -19 illness is predominantly a respi[INVESTIGATOR_780878], 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_60975] (ARDS) in advanced 
disease. Initial symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_780879], sore 
throat and malaise.  Fever is present in approximately 44 -98% of cases. Notably , 
persons with COVID -19 often complain of loss of smell or taste.  
Advanced complications of COVID -19 illness include cytopenias (lymphopenia, 
thrombocytopenia and anemia), and a cute cardiac events (raised troponin, changes 
on electrocardiogram), acute renal injury and renal failure, liver impairment, and 
neurological events including acute cerebrovascular events, impaired consciousness 
and muscle injury and thrombotic events.  
Protocol INSIGHT 013   Version 1.0, 20 Aug 2020  
Inpatient Treatment with  Anti-Coronavirus Immunoglobulin  IND # [ADDRESS_1073550] patients (approximately 80%) symptoms resolve without the need for 
intervention within five to seven days of symptom onset up to a maximum of 14 days. 
However, approximately 20%  of patients  show signs of clinical disease progression, 
most notably  pneumonia , around day 3 to 8 following symptom onset.  Other 
manifestations of disease progression include thrombotic epi[INVESTIGATOR_780880]  (MI). This resembles the documented 6 -8 fold excess risk  
of thrombosis  when patients a re infected with influenza.10  
A proportion of those who progress then further deteriorate, including with the 
development of  ARDS around 1 -5 days after pneumonic symptom onset.5,11,12,13  
Acute kidney injury necessitating dialysis and failure of other organs may also occur  
at this severe stage of  disease.  
 
Of the nearly 1099 persons described in the Wuhan cohort, 16.0% had severe 
disease at presentation. 67 persons (6.1%) reached a composite primary endpoint of 
intensive care admission, mechanical ventilation and death; two -thirds had presented 
with severe disease.8,14 As described below, outcomes for those requiring 
mechanical ventilation and with other manifestations of end -organ failure are poor, 
and ap proaches to prevent this late stage of the disease am ong those with early 
evidence of progression are critically needed.  
 
In this trial, we aim to enroll patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_475723] -
19 at the onset of clinical progression but before end -organ failure has developed : the 
time period of their infection which is shaded light orange in Figure 1. The majority of 
these patients will have e merging evidence of pneumonia, bu t recognizing the 
expanding range of organs involved in clinical progression of COVID -19, neither the 
inclusion criteria nor primary endpoint are limited only to assessment of pneumonia 
and related clinical progression .

Inpatient Treatment with  Anti-Coronavirus Immunoglobulin  IND # [ADDRESS_1073551] predominately 
been conducted in individuals already hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057]. These includ e a mix of descriptive 
information on the patients as well as estimates of associations between patient  
characteristics and disease severity.  Older age has been found to be stron gly related 
to greater severity14,15 and poorer outcome as ha s the presence of conditions such as 
hypertension, diabetes and coronary heart disease .12,14,16  Other risk factors identified 
include cigarette smoking14,15,17 and raised body mass index ( BMI).18,19,20,[ADDRESS_1073552] notably been associated with greater likelihood of 
progression to more severe disease include shortness of breath and elevated  body  
temperature .14,23  
The COVID -19–Associated Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14287] (COVID -NET) report 
on 1482 persons who were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_42868] 14 states in the [LOCATION_002]  of America 
(US) in March 2020 show ne arly 75% were aged over 50 years, and nearly 90% had 
at least one or more underlying comorbid illness .24  
Based on 2.6 million users of the COVID Symptom Tracker App, predominantly in the 
[LOCATION_008], being older, obese, diabetic , or suffering from pre -existing lung, 
heart or renal disease placed participants at increased risk of visiting hospi[INVESTIGATOR_108950] -19.25 Pre-existing lung disease and diabetes were consistently associated 
with a higher risk of requiring respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413].25 A meta -analysis showed that 
cardiac injury as measured by a high sensitive troponin was associated with higher 
mortality, higher need for intensiv e care unit (ICU)  care, and severe COVID -19 
disease.26 

Protocol INSIGHT 013   Version 1.0, 20 Aug 2020  
Inpatient Treatment with  Anti-Coronavirus Immunoglobulin  IND # [ADDRESS_1073553] hit by [CONTACT_4113] -19, 88% required 
mechanical ventilation and 11% noninvasive ventilation.27 The ICU mortality rate was 
26%. Of 1043 patients with available data, 709 (68%) had at least 1 comorbidity and 
509 (49%) had hypertension, 21% had cardiovascular disease . Younger patients 
(≤63 years) compared to older patients, had lower ICU mortality and  higher rates of 
discharge from ICU. The median length of stay in the ICU was  9 days though 58% 
remained in ICU at time of report.27 In one report of  the Chinese experience in 
Wuhan, 31 of 32 persons who required mechanical ventilation died.5 In the United 
Kingdom, of the 4078 COVID -19 patients a dmitted into critical care with reported 
outcomes, 50.7% died in ICU ; those requiring advanced respi[INVESTIGATOR_780881] .[ADDRESS_1073554] before and early after symptom onset.29 Viral R NA shedding from 
pharynx gradually wanes as sympt om resolve  though v iral RNA is still detectable 
weeks after symptom resolution .29,30,31 Median duration of viral shedding was 20 days 
in survivors (longest 37 days), but SARS -CoV-2 was detectable until death in non -
survivors.6 Whether this is viable virus with the potential for continued transmission 
remains uncertain. RNAemia has been reported but  is relatively rare .30,32  Viral 
detection in sputum is higher and outlasts pharyngeal swabs in those with 
pneumonia.33  Persons with asymptomatic disease clear their virus faster than 
symptomatic individuals.34

severe stage of COVID -19 (i.e. on ventilator or extra -corporeal membrane 
oxygenation  [ECMO ]) is unclear, but likely minor  as we hypothesize that any organ 
damage from the infection has likely occurred already  and the predominant drivers of 
progression to severe disease/ ARDS  are those of the uncontrolled local and systemic 
immune response . 
2.2.[ADDRESS_1073556]  in those with progressive disease , the humoral 
immune response to SARS -CoV-2 appears variable  and may be slow. While data are 
still emerging, it appears that in a significant pro portion of  cases , antibody responses 
are not yet evident at the time (day 5 -7) when  disease progression and 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_780882], supporting a role for supplementation of the 
antibody response at that time point .  
Two large series have descr ibed antibody responses (IgG and IgM) . In the first,  
samples from 82 confirmed and 58 probable cases of COVID -19 in a cross -sectional 
analysis demonstrated IgG detection 14 ( interquartile range [IQR] 10-18) days after 
symptom onset, with IgM detected median  of 5 days  (IQR 3 -6) after symptom onset. 
Antibodies were absent in around 22% of individuals at assessment (IgM), and IgM 
was most commonly absent in those assessed early (within 7 days of symptom 
onset)].[ADDRESS_1073557] under 40% of patients at day 5 -7, rising to 50% at day 8 -10, while interestingly 
IgG wa s detectable in a slightly higher proportion at those time points : just over 50% 
at day 5 -7, rising to 60% at day [ADDRESS_1073558], or possibl y may contribute adversely to disease severity is currently 
unclear. In severe cases th is decline in CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes is also 
associa ted with an increase in  activated CD4 + and CD8 +, increases in key 
proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin 6 ( IL-6), and increases in natural killer 
(NK) cells.37,[ADDRESS_1073559], and may 
help to clarify this.

disease, and modifiers of other pathophysiological p athways implicated in disease 
progression, including potentially anticoagulants and anti -platelet agents.  In certain 
regions, local standards of care have been established, generally with agents 
hypothesized to have clinical activity but where robust compa rative data are not yet 
available. For example, lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054], hydroxychloroquine, and favip iravir have all seen 
widespread use in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_780883].  
The most promising current antiviral agent is remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue 
previously studied for  Ebola .39  A preliminary re port of the  National Institute of Allergy 
and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)  Adaptive COVID -19 Treatment Trial (ACTT)  showed 
that participants receiving remdesivir  had a shorter median time to recovery  
compared with those receiving placebo  (11 vs 15 days ; p<0.001). There was a trend 
toward a  survival benefit  after 14 days; estimates of  mortality were  7.1% and 11.9% 
(hazard ratio  [HR]=0.70; 95% CI: 0.47 -1.04).[ADDRESS_1073561], a smal ler randomized 
study from China did not show a significant benefit for remdesivir in a similar 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_203725] (HR for time to clinical improvement 1 .23 [95% CI 0 .87–
1.75]); however th at trial was stopped early due to slow enrol lment and power was 
substantially less than planned (58% instead of 80%) .[ADDRESS_1073562] and other issues 
including optimal dosing and optimal timing of therapy . 
Based on the findings of  ACTT, remdesivir will be provided to all study participants  as 
SOC  unless contraindicated for an individ ual patient . As in ACTT, remdesivir will be 
administered as a 200 milligram ( mg) IV loading dose following the hIVIG/placebo 
infusion, followed by a [ADDRESS_1073563] antiviral activity undergoing

 Other agents under exploration modulate pathophysiological pathways implicated in 
disease progression. Given the apparent role of excessive IL -6 production in patients 
with advanced disease, tocilizumab and other inh ibitors of IL -6 and associated 
cytokine pathways (such as Janus kinase, JAK, inhibitors) are all under evaluation, 
and off -label use of tocilizumab in critical illness is common in some settings.

Emergent BioSolutions ’ Anti-Coronavirus disease hIVIG, is a  liquid product contain ing 
approximately 100 mg/mL (10g%) protein of which at least 96% is purified human 
IgG, stabilized with 250 m illimoles (mmol)  proline and 0.03% PS80 at pH 5. 8. The 
vialed product will be clear to slightly opalescent, and colorless or pale -yellow liquid, 
essen tially free of foreign particles.  
The manufacturing process for SARS -CoV-2 hIVIG  contains two steps implemented 
specifically for virus clearance. The solvent and detergent step (using TnBP and TX -
100, respectively) is effective in the inactivation of enve loped viruses such as HBV, 
HCV, and HIV . Virus filtration, using a Planova™ 20N virus filter, is effective for the 
removal of viruses based on their size, including some non -enveloped viruses. These 
two viral clearance steps are designed to increase produc t safety by [CONTACT_780923] -enveloped viruses. In addition to these two 
specific steps, the process of anion exchange chromatography was identified as 
contributing to the overall viral clearance capacity for small non -lipid enveloped 
viruses.

the physiologic range. The protein composition consists of not less than 98% purified 
IgG. The product is clea r to opalescent and colorless to pale yellow liquid.  
The purification process used to manufacture hIVIG includes multiple segments with 
virus clearance capacity, such as caprylate -induced precipi[INVESTIGATOR_780890], 
caprylate incubation, ion -exch ange chromatography, 35 nanometers ( nm) 
nanofiltration, and low pH incubation. The capacity of these manufacturing segments 
to inactivate and/or remove virus was assessed via laboratory experiments in which a 
test virus was spi[INVESTIGATOR_780891] a small -scale model, and the processed material was 
assayed for residual viral infectivity. The purification process demonstrated a large 
overall virus clearance capacity for enveloped an d non -enveloped viruses of diverse 
physico -chemical properties, providing a very high margin of safety from the risk of 
transmission of infectious viruses.

  RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSM ENT 3
 Known Potential Risks  3.1
Potential risks of participating in this trial are those associated with havi ng blood 
drawn, IV catheterization, possible reactions to hIVIG infusions , thrombosis, the 
volume of fluid infused, and breach of confidentiality.  These risks are discussed 
below.  
3.1.1  Blood Draw and IV Catheterization  
Drawing blood may cause transient discomfort and fainting. Fainting is usually 
transient and managed by [CONTACT_475787]/her legs. 
Bruising at the blood collection sites may occur but can be prevented or lessened by 
[CONTACT_119911] a few minutes after the blood is taken. IV 
catheterization may cause insertion site pain, phlebitis, hematoma formation, and 
infusate extravasation; less frequent but significant complications include 
bloodstream and loc al infections. The use of aseptic (sterile) technique will make 
infection at the site of blood draw  or at catheter ization  less likely.  
3.1.2  Study Treatments  
The hIVIG used in this study is manufactured in the same manner and to the same 
standards as commerciall y available IVIG. This includes screening for blood borne 
pathogens, and manufacturing steps including solvent/detergent to inactivate any 
viruses. The risks are anticipated to be the risks of standard IVIG preparations. 
Specific considerations related to the use of hIVIG in COVID -19, including thrombosis 
and the theoretical risk of antibody -dependent enhancement, are summarized at the 
conclusion of this section.  
As IVIG is made from human plasma, transmittable viral infections like hepatitis B, 
hepatitis C , and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are a potential risk (though 
steps are taken to screen for and inactivate such pathogens). In addition, there is a 
theoretical risk, although  deemed very low, that hIVIG administration may be capable 
of transmitting  other known or unknown infectious agents other than viruses, such as 
infectious prions (e.g., the agent of Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease).  
Immune globulin administration may impair the efficacy of live attenuated virus 
vaccines such as measles, rubella, mumps , and varicella.  
The safety of human IV immunoglobulins is well established.  As described in the 
Investigational Brochures (IBs), a  number of adverse events have been associated 
with the use of IVIG in both children and adults. In the range of 1 to 15%, usually less 
than 5% , of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_780892], with the severity ranging 
from mild to severe. Most reactions occur during the initial 30 to 60 minutes of the 
infusion and are mild and self -limited.

 Pyrogenic Reactions  
• These react ions are marked by a significant rise in temperature and are usually 
accompanied by [CONTACT_780925].  
Allergic Reactions  
• Allergic reactions often present with an uncomfortable feeling, especially a 
tightening around the neck, chest, or abdomen. There may be difficulty 
swallowing, a choking sensation, or difficulty breathing. Other symptoms of 
anaphylaxis include wheezing, rash, hives, rapid or weak pulse, hypotension, 
sweating, or an upset stomach with or without nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. 
Other mor e serious allergic reactions are rare, and include hemolysis and 
aseptic meningitis.  
Vasomotor Symptoms  
• These can occur with or without additional cardiac manifestations.  
• Blood pressure can either increase or decrease, and may be accompanied by 
[CONTACT_780926].  
• Patients experiencing such reactions may report shortness of breath or 
tightness in the chest.  
Non-allergic Systemic (Anaphylactoid) Reactions  
• These reactions most commonly include headache, dizziness, or 
lightheadedness.  
• Patie nts can also experience chills, nausea, vomiting, back or hip pain, 
malaise, myalgia and arthralgias.  
• Rigors are a rare infusion reaction that is an extreme form of chills that affects 
the whole body with vigorous shaking.  
• The most frequent cause of su ch reactions is infusion at an excessively rapid 
rate. 
• These types of reactions are more common in a patient naïve to IgG treatment 
and/or who harbor chronic infection. These reactions may be marked by 
[CONTACT_780927], chills, headache, d izziness, nausea, vomiting, 
and muscle aches.  
• Frequently the patient reports anxiety and in some cases, “a sense of 
impending doom.” Often, the patient will have elevated blood pressure rather 
than hypotension, distinguishing this type of reaction from t rue anaphylaxis.  
Protocol INSIGHT 013   Version 1.0, 20 Aug 2020  
Inpatient Treatment with  Anti-Coronavirus Immunoglobulin  IND # [ADDRESS_1073579]-infusion Reactions  
• These reactions can occur immediately or up to 48 to 72 hours following the 
infusion.  
• Symptoms associated with post -infusion reactions are usually less severe in 
nature, but can interfere with a patient’s qual ity of life.  
• Common post -infusion reactions may include headache, low -grade fever, 
nausea, arthralgias, and generalized malaise.  
Other Reactions  
• Renal dysfunction, acute renal failure, and osmotic nephropathy may occur with 
immune globulin intravenous products in predisposed patients. Renal 
dysfunction and acute failure occur more commonly in patients receiving IVIG 
products containing sucrose. The  hIVIG  products in this study do  not contain 
sucrose.  
• Transfusion -related acute lung injury (TRALI) , although very rare, may occur 
and is characterized by [CONTACT_339838][INVESTIGATOR_1506], pulmonary edema, 
hypoxemia, normal left ventricular function, and feve r. 
• The infused volumes of study product may be as high as 200  mL, so there is the 
risk of volume overload in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_265896].  
Transfusion -associated circulatory overload (TACO) has been associated with 
plasma infusion and may be clinically indistinguishable from TRALI even though 
the physiologic mechanisms differ.  TACO is hydrostatic, not permeability, 
edema and more responsive to diuresis when it occurs.  Patients with pre -
existing conditions who may not tolerate th e volume  of hIVIG/pl acebo  to be 
given  will be excluded from this study, but this condition could still occur in 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
• There are case reports of pulmonary emboli occurring after administration of 
IVIG and plasma therapy, though definitive studies assessing risk are lacking .[ADDRESS_1073580] been shown to develop in approximately 10 -15% of 
critically ill adults.[ADDRESS_1073581] IVIG 
therapy, and in some cases COVID -19 is associated with thrombotic complications. 
Hence participants with pre -existing prothrombotic tendencies will no t be included  
and any thrombotic events will form part of the primary endpoint assessment and be 
monitored during interim safety analyses  by [CONTACT_4318] .

 There is a theoretical risk the antibody infusion may worsen the disease course of 
COVID -19 via antigen -dependent enhancement (ADE). It is unclear if this 
phenomenon is relevant and clinically significant in COVID -19, but to ensure 
detection of any such phenomenon (which could be manifested by [CONTACT_780928]) close monitoring of clinical disease outcomes 
will be maintained in the randomized group s, including in the days prior to the primary 
endpoint  assessment at Day 7 . 
3.1.3  Confidentiality and  Privacy  
Participants  will be asked to provide personal health information (PHI ). All attempts 
will be made to keep this PHI confidential within the limits of the law. However, there 
is a chance that unauthorized persons will see the participant’s  PHI. All source 
records including electronic data will be stored in secured systems in accordance with 
institutional policies and government regulations.  
All study data that leave the site (including any electronic transmission of data) will be 
identified only by a coded number that is linked to a participant  through a code key 
maintained a t the clinical site. Names or readily identifying information will not be 
released.  Electronic files will be password protected.  
Only people who are involved in the conduct, oversight, monitoring, or auditing of this 
trial will be allowed access to the PHI  that is collected. Any publication from this trial 
will not use information that will identify study participants . Organizations that may 
inspect and/or copy research records maintained at the participating site for quality 
assurance and data analysis inc lude groups such as the IRB, NIAID and applicable 
regulatory agencies (e.g. US Food and Drug Administration [ FDA]).  
 Known Potential Benefits  3.[ADDRESS_1073582] the hypothesis that hIVIG will reduce the risk of 
further disease progression , hIVIG may or may not prevent  this outcome in any 
individual who participates in this trial.  However, there is benefit to society from their 
participation in this trial resulting from insights gained about the therapeutic agent 
under study as well as the natural history of the disease. While there may not be 
benefits for an individual, there will be benefits to society if a safe, efficacious 
therapeutic agent can be identified during this global COVID -19 outbreak.  
 OBJECTIVES AND ENDPO INTS  4
 Primary  Objective s and Primary Endpoint  4.1
The primary objective  is to compare the clinical status of participants in the hIVIG + 
SOC and placebo + SOC groups on Day 7 using an ordinal outcome with 7 mutually 
Protocol INSIGHT 013   Version 1.0, 20 Aug 2020  
Inpatient Treatment with  Anti-Coronavirus Immunoglobulin  IND # [ADDRESS_1073583] of the 7 categories the p articipant was in 
that day will constitute the primary outcome. The 7 categories are:  
7. Death  
6. End-organ failure  
5. Life-threatening end -organ dysfunction  
4. Serious end -organ dysfunction  
3. Moderate end -organ dysfunction  
2. Limiting symptoms due to COVID -19  
1. No limiting symptoms due to COVID -19 
Appendix F  provides clinical definitions of each category. In addition to the overall 
summary odds ratio (OR) that will be estimated as described in Section 11.1, ORs 
will be estimated for the [ADDRESS_1073584] ations in 
addition to pneumonia and ARDS are increasingly emerging as significant 
contributors to morbidity. The ordinal outcome includes 7 well -defined mutually 
exclusive categories that assess further progression of disease as well as recovery 
from COVID -19.  
The ordinal outcome includes both pulmonary manifestations as assessed in prior 
COVID -19 trials and additional components representing key non -pulmonary 
outcomes; the latter are highlighted as “extra -pulmonary”  in the guidance table 
(Appendix F ). The primary endpoint will include both pulmonary and extra -pulmonary 
components, while the pulmonary manifestation scale only will be reported as a 
secondary endpoint.  
Day [ADDRESS_1073585] of hIVIG on disease progression may not

measured by [CONTACT_780929]. Also, transient treatment eff ects that are no  longer  
present at Day [ADDRESS_1073586] severe categories and, therefore, provides goo d power for comparing the two 
treatment groups with a feasible sample size given the difficulty in producing large 
quantities of hIVIG (see Section 5.5).  
 Secondary Objectives  4.2
Secondary objectives will be assessed by [CONTACT_780930] + SOC with placebo + 
SOC over the 28 day follow -up period for outcomes listed below.  Because there is no 
established endpoint for evaluating the clinical efficacy of treatments for COVID -19, 
other clinically relevant outcomes, including outcomes used in other COVID -19 
treatment trials, will be recorded. Thus, the randomized groups can be compared for 
multiple outcomes, and results can be compared or combined with other trials. Many 
of the e ndpoints used in other trials are ordinal outcomes or are defined based on a 
dichotomy of an ordinal outcome and assessed at a single follow -up time point or as 
a time -to-event outcome.  
1. All-cause mortality through Day 28.  
 
2. The primary ordinal outcome on Da ys 3, 5, 14 and 28.

disease progression among those with longer duration of symptoms at study entry  
will be primarily determined by [CONTACT_780933].   In addition, it is assumed that  the natural antibody 
response to SARS -CoV-2 infection is likely to be greater at entry for those with 
longer symptom duration, and this would diminish the treatment difference 
between the hIVIG and placebo gro ups over the week following infusion.  Given 
the inclusion criteria of ≤ 12 days, we anticipate the upper quartile will be 8 -10 
days  (75% of participants will have symptom duration < 8 to 10 days).   In ACCT -1, 
a more severely ill target population than stud ied here, there was no limit to the 
duration of symptoms and the median was 9 days (interquartile range, 6 to 12).40   
The quartile definitions  for duration of symptoms will be de termined  following the

Participants may co -enroll in INSIGHT observational studies (e .g. INSIGHT 004

 In the event that the blind is broken for safety r easons, this will be recorded,  and the 
protocol co-chair (s) will be notified.  In that situation, every attempt will be made to 
minimize the number of people unblinded.  
 Distribution of Anti -Coronavirus  hIVIG to Clinical Sites   5.[ADDRESS_1073593] to 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_780897].  Thus, for practical reasons, the  primary analysis (see 
Section 11.1) which compares the hIVIG and placebo groups on Day [ADDRESS_1073594] s will be the 
same . 
The site pharmacy allocation of hIVIG will take into account estimates of the number 
of pa rticipant  doses each manufacturer will provide and estimates of the number of 
participant s to be enrolled by [CONTACT_780936] (i.e., it may not be an 
equal number of site pharmacies or pa rticipants  for each hIVIG product).  
 
It is likely that the hIVIG provided by [CONTACT_780937].  For each individual pa rticipant , all hIVIG vials used will come 
from the same lot. This plan for distributing the hIVIG will simplify the tracking of lots 
used by [CONTACT_780938].  This plan also simplifies the pharmacy plans prepared 
for each site pharmacy.   
 
More generally, with this plan, one can consider this as parallel  multi -center trials of 
different hIVIG pr oducts for which planned analyses that compare the hIVIG and 
placebo groups for primary and secondary outcomes will be pooled across the hIVIG 
products used.  With such a plan, depending on the number of doses of each hIVIG 
product provided, there may be ad equate power to compare each hIVIG product with 
matching placebo for some outcomes other than the primary efficacy outcome, 
including potentially  change in anti -SARS -CoV-2 IgG levels from baseline ( Day 0), 
safety outcomes, such as  AEs and infusion interruptions, and selected secondary 
efficacy outcomes.

 Sample Size Assumptions  5.5
5.5.1  Primary Analysis  
The planned sample size for the trial is 500 participants  (250 in each  group). The 
following assumptions were made in estimating the required sample size. 
a. The primary analysis will be intention to treat.   
b. A proportional odds model with indicators for the six cut -offs corresponding to 
using any of categories 1 to 6 as cut -offs for determining clinical improvement, 
treatment group (hIVIG versus placebo) , baseline severity of illness as defined by 
[CONTACT_780929] , two -way interactions between baseline severity of illness and 
the six cut -offs, hIVIG product/matching placebo  used , and two -way interactions 
between hIVIG product/matching placebo used  and t he six cut -offs will be used to 
estimate the OR.   
c. Type 1 error = 0.05 (2 -sided) and power = 0.80.  
d. The clinical status (% distribution) of pa rticipants  in the placebo group at Day [ADDRESS_1073595] column in Table 1. Since both randomized treatment 
groups will receive remdesivir as SOC (unless contraindicated), these 
percentages were estimated using  Day 7 data from the ACTT -1 trial for a 
subgroup of patients similar to ours (the subgroup of participants who entered 
ACTT -1 in categories 4+5 of t heir 8 -category  ordinal outcome for disease severity  
and were randomized to the remdesivir  group ). 
e. We assumed an OR (hIVIG/placebo) of 1.61 for a more favorable outcome.  This 
corresponds to the % distribution of the clinical status of pa rticipants  in the hIVIG 
group at Day [ADDRESS_1073596] favorable categories wou ld be increased 
to 65.4% in the hIVIG group from 54.0% in the placebo group (a n 11.4% increase 
from the placebo group).  Conversely, the percentage of participants in the [ADDRESS_1073597] 
severe categories would decrease to 19.4% from 28.1% in the placebo group. 
The same proportional improvement was assumed across the ordinal scale.  
f. Sample size depends on a number of assumptions, including the hypothesized 
odds ratio, the number of categories in the ordinal outcome, and the distribution of  
responses for the placebo group.[ADDRESS_1073598], and require a larger sample size to

 maintain 80% power.  The final sample size was chosen after consideration of a  
range of odds ratios and of category percentages for the placebo group.  
g. Based on the category percentages in Table 1, the estimated sample size is 494.  
This was increased to  [ADDRESS_1073599] to follow -up.  
We are plann ing a blinded  sample size re -estimation using pooled data (both the 
hIVIG and placebo groups combined) for the primary endpoint that will be made after 
approximately [ADDRESS_1073600] completed the Day 7 follow -up assessment . The 
goal of the re -estimation is to retain 80% power to detect the hypothesized summary 
odds ratio of 1.61. The re -estimation will use the observed (pooled) distribution of the 
ordinal outcome at day 7, pooled across study arms.

For the key subgroup defined according to duration of symptoms at entry, 375 
participants will be in the lower 3 quartiles.  Assuming the category percentages in 
Table 1 , with 375 participants, an OR of a more favorable outcome on hIVIG 
compared to placebo of 1.61 can be detected with 70% power .  For this subgroup, a n 
OR of 1.73 can be detected with 80% power and type 1 error =  0.05 (2 -sided).

Inpatient Treatment with  Anti-Coronavirus Immunoglobulin  IND # [ADDRESS_1073601] treatment differences in mortal ity, because the 
mortality is expected to be low given the eligibility criteria.  
The following outcomes are defined as key secondary outcomes:   
Composite of death, end -organ failure , or life -threatening end -organ 
dysfunction  (categories 5 -7 of the ordinal outcome)  at Day 7 :  This composite 
outcome comprises the most severe three categories of the ordinal outcome . 
Decreasing the probability that a pa rticipant  enters one of these disease states and 
remains there  through Day 7, has high clinical significance.  Comparing the 
hIVIG +SOC  versus the placebo+SOC groups for the proportion of participants in the 
three worst categories on Day 7, a total sample size of [ADDRESS_1073602] a decrease to  6.1%  in the hIVI G group compared with 13.6%  in the placebo 
group (difference  7.5%, OR= 2.4) with 80% power, under the following assumptions:  
a. The analysis will be intention to treat.   
b. Type 1 error = 0.05 (2 -sided) and power = 0.80.  
c. The proportion of participants who are in categories 5 -7 of the ordinal outcome on 
Day 7 in the placebo + SOC group is 13.6% (Table 1) .  In the ACTT -1 study, the 
proportion was 10.8%,  among participants in baseline categories 4+5 of the 
ACTT -1 ordinal outc ome who were randomized to the remdesivir group 
(confidential data, personal communication).   
A decrease from 13.6% to 8% (OR 1.8) could be detected with power of 47%. 
Time to discharge from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], time to the [ADDRESS_1073603] favorable categories of the 
primary ordinal o utcome : We expect that by [CONTACT_2006] 28, almost all participants will be 
discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] .  Similarly, we expect most participants will  be in in one 
of the [ADDRESS_1073604] favorable categories of the primary ordinal outcome  by [CONTACT_2006] 28 . In the 
ACTT -1 trial, in the subset of par ticipants who entered the trial  with disease severity 
similar to o ur eligibility criteria  (ACTT-1 ordinal outcome categories 4+ 5), 94.7% had 
been discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_419910] 28. This percentage was similar for the 
ACTT -1 definition of “recovery”  that include a small percentage of participants who 
were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_780898] . Comparing the hIVIG versus 
placebo groups for time to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], our study is powered to detect a 
relative rate ra tio (RRR) of 1.3 with 80% power  and a significance level of 0.05.  The 
power calculations assume that the RRR is approximately constant to Day 28, the 
overall cumulative percentage discharged (pooled across treatment groups) by [CONTACT_2006] 
28 is 94% and that betwe en 2.5 and 3% withdraw consent or are lost to follow -up by 
[CONTACT_2006] 28.  We assume power is similar for time to the [ADDRESS_1073605] favorable outcomes of 
the primary ordinal outcome.    
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_780899] : Comparing the hIVIG versus the placebo+SOC groups for 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30074] (a binary outcome, alive and discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_780900] ) on Day 7, the total sample size of 
[ADDRESS_1073606] a n increase in the proportion discharged  to

33 
 58% in the hIVIG group from 45% in the placebo group ( OR=1.7), with 80% power.  
Similarly, the study has 80% power to detect an increase to 81% in the hIVIG group 
compared with 70% in the placebo group ( OR=1.85) at Day 14 .  Corresponding 
estimates from the  ACTT -1 trial were 51%  discharged on Day 7, and  77% on Day 14 , 
for participants that were similar to ours and randomized to the remdesivir arm 
(confidential data; personal communication).  Our hypothesized percentages are 
slightly lower, because our eligib ility criteria allow for use of high -flow oxygen , in 
addition to the ACTT -1 ordinal categories 4 +5. Power calculations assume that the 
treatment groups are compared by [CONTACT_104992] -to-treat.  
 Schedule of Assessments  5.6
Participants will be randomized and given their infusion of study drug/placebo on Day 
0, in addition to standard of care therapy . All participants will be followed through  28 
days.  Consenting participants at selected sites will return for a  visit 90 days a fter 
randomization to obtain a blood draw ; this subset will comprise all participants at 
selected sites where return for a later visit is practical for participants . While in the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , evaluations will be made each day  (Appendix B ). SAEs and deaths should 
be immediately reported.  Participants  who are discharged will be asked to retu rn to 
the site at Day 1, 2, 3, 7 and Day 28 (if already discharged)  for a blood draw and 
health status assessment.   Additional visits after discharge at Days [ADDRESS_1073607].  
 Approach to Intercurrent Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_475740] - 5.7
enrol lment  
In general, the study will take a pragmatic approach to the use of intercurrent, 
concomitant med ications.  With the exception of convalescent plasma or IVIG 
(hyperimmune or standard, other than study drug) which is not permitted prior to entry 
or through Day 7, there are few restrictions.  
Participants will be asked at screening to agree to refrain fr om participation in other 
clinical trials until after the assessment of the primary endpoint (Day 7). However,  it is 
recognised that, in the case of progression to life -threatening disease and end -organ 
failure (broadly categories 5 and 6 of the outcome me asure) there will be 
considerable clinical concern, and participation in an additional clinical trial at that 
time will not be restricted.   
Prior participation in clinical trials (except receipt of IVIG, h IVIG or convalescent 
plasma) is not restricted, recognising for example that participants may have enrolled 
in a study for mild disease prior to progression and then may wish to participate in 
this study at the onset of progression.  
The planned analyses are by  [CONTACT_118067].  All pa rticipants  will be compared at 
Day 7 irrespective of use of concomitant treatments.  Concomitant treatments at 
baseline and Day 7 will be recorded. The study randomization and site stratification 
will balance the use of concomitan t medications on average at baseline and these will 
be summarized with other baseline characteristics.  Follow -up use of concomitant

 treatments may differ by [CONTACT_780939]/safety of the 
study treatments . Use of concomitant tr eatments will be summarized at Day  7 by 
[CONTACT_1570].  
 SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE  FOR THE STUDY  6
The clinical course of SARS -CoV-2-infected individuals tends to diverge around day 3 
to 8, with a fraction of patients showing progression (most notably pneumonia) while 
others recover. A proportion of those progressing then further progress to end -organ 
failure, including respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], and in some cases death. Humoral immunity to 
SARS -CoV-2 is not yet well understood , and may be  variable or delayed in some  
individuals (including potentially those progressing) . Augmentation of the antibody 
response using passive immunotherapy with hIVIG to SARS -CoV-2 around  the onset 
of clinical progression  but before end -organ failure has developed may reduce the 
subsequent risk of further disease progression and death.   
 STUDY POPULATION  7
The total sample size is projected to be 500 adults ≥18 years of age with COVID -19 
and who meet all eligibility criteria . These participants will be enrolled at clinical trial 
sites globally.  Each site pharmacy may supply several clinical sites;  approximately 
20-30 site pharmacies  will participate (see Section 5.4). The estimated time from 
screening (Day -1 or Day 0) to the end of the study for an individual participant  is

study product while taking part in this trial.  Procedures and treatment for clinical care 
including costs associated with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_119825] , 
participant ’s insurance or third party.  
 STUDY PRODUCT  [ADDRESS_1073613] is administered as a single dose of 400 mg/kg (or 0 .4 g/kg) body 
weight, to a maximum dose of 40 g or 400 mL (i.e. capped at a body weight of 
100kg).  
The safety profile of hIVIG is anticipated to be comparable to licensed IVIGs for which 
dose s of well above 400 mg/kg are safe and well tolerated. Licensed IVIGs are used 
with doses up to 400mg/kg for immune replacement and up to 2 g/kg for 
immunomodulatory induction,  with an established favourable safety profile  in which 
adverse events are not closely dose related . 
The selected dose is derived from measures of anti -SARS -CoV-2 neutralizing 
potency  from hIVIG, in comparison with that observed in convalescent plasma pools. 
Convalesce nt plasma pools used to produce hIVIG contain approximately 10 mg/ mL 
of IgG immunoglobulin. Analysis of hIVIG shows an expected 10 -fold increase in anti -
SARS -CoV-2 binding IgG, but a lower than expected (5 -fold) enrichment in anti - 
SARS -CoV-2 neutralizing potency. This sugge sts that only 50% of anti -SARS -CoV-2 
neutralizi ng potency of plasma pools utilized to produce hIVIG is associated with 
IgGs. Based on this comparison , the neutralizing potency associated with the 
selected dose of 400 mg/kg hIVIG is significantly  higher than in  a fixed dose of  400 
mL of convalescent pla sma (3.5 -5 fold higher than that dose of plasma when  
administered to 70 -100 kg ). This dose was therefore selected as providing an 
appreciable dose margin over convalescent plasma (in addition to the other 
advantages of hIVIG  versus plasma), while remaining well within the accepted safe 
dose range for other IVIG products , and observing the limitations of hIVIG product 
supply.

 There are no data so far to define target therapeutic titers for anti -SARS -CoV-2 
antibody  which would support dose derivation from target titers rather than the 
approach to dose selection described above. Although not considered for dose 
selection in the present study, the hIVIG products ’ potencies , and circulating levels of 
immunoglobulins (IgG, IgG subcl asses, IgM, IgA) and neutralizing antibody titers 
following treatment will be measured. The analysis of the relationship between 
neutralizing titers and clinical outcomes may help to define a target therapeutic 
neutralizing titer for hIVIG+SOC and therefor e may support dose optimization for 
future clinical investigations.  
8.1.[ADDRESS_1073614] is administered as a single dose of 400 mg/kg (or 0. 4 g/kg) current 
actual (not ideal) body weight, to a maximum dose of 40 g or 400 mL (i.e. capped at a 
body weight of 100  kg). The product as supplied should not be diluted. The infusion 
line may be flushed with normal saline.  
Infusion of hIVIG/placebo should commence at an infusion rate of 0.5 mg/kg/minute 
for approximately 30 minutes. If the infusio n is well tolerated, the rate of 
administration may be increased to a maximum of 4 mg/kg/minute as follows: the rate 
may be increased by [CONTACT_780941] [ADDRESS_1073615] 60 minutes 
following completion of the infusion.  
For participants  judged to be at risk for volume overload  (including but not limited to 
those with pre-existing cardiac failure) , or who have for renal dysfunction  (estimated 
creatinine clearance < 60ml/min) , administer hIVIG at the minimum infusion rate 
practicable.   
For all participants, use of diuretics may be considered as clinically appropriate to 
avoid or t reat fluid overload, with the goal of maintaining participants in a euvolemic 
state following completion of the infusion.  
If adverse events occur, such as flushing, headache, nausea, changes in pulse rate 
or blood pressure, the rate of infusion should be s lowed or infusion should be 
temporarily stopped. When events resolve, the infusion may be resumed at a rate 
that is comfortable to the participant  (start at half of the last tolerated rate and 
increase gradually).  
The hIVIG  treatment should be immediately stopped should new onset or worsening 
of any of the following occur:  
• Profound hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 80 mmHg)

 Remdesivir  Background Therapy  8.2
8.2.1  Rationale  
The antiviral drug remdesivir is being provided to all participants in this study, unless 
contraindicated.  Remdesivir was shown to improve time to recovery in moderately -
to-severely ill indi viduals hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21391] -1940.  It is being provided to 
standardize background therapy in this study ; while considered standard of care in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643], due to shortages and regulatory status the drug may not be 
available at some participat ing sites during the study period.  
8.2.2  Description  
Remdesivir is a single diastereomer monophosphoramidate prodrug designed for the 
intracellular delivery of a modified adenine nucleoside analog GS -441524. In addition 
to the active ingredient, the lyophilized formulation of remdesivir contains the 
following inactive ingredients: water for injection, sulfobutylether -β-cyclodextrin 
(SBECD ), and hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide.  
8.2.3  Administration  
Remdesivir will be administered as a 200 mg IV loading dose  (100 mL volume)  on the 
first day of  its infusion  followed by 100mg daily for the course described below; 
remdesivir may have commenced prior to randomization. For pa rticipants  starting 
remdesivir after randomization to hIVIG/placebo, t he loading dose should  be given 
immediately after the infusion of hIVIG/placebo , once any infusion reactions from that 
infusion have resolved ; for those who commenced remdesivir prior to randomization, 
the usual maintenance dose of 100 mg can be given after the hIVIG/placebo in fusion 
on Day [ADDRESS_1073616] remdesivir infusion,  a 100 mg once -daily 
IV maintenance dose (also 10 0 mL volume) is given each day while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_780902] 013   Version 1.0, 20 Aug 2020  
Inpatient Treatment with  Anti-Coronavirus Immunoglobulin  IND # [ZIP_CODE]  
39 
 up to a 10 day total course ; shorter durations of 5 days may be considered by [CONTACT_780942] . Infusions will not 
be given to participants after discharge.  The total treatment course should not exceed 
10 calendar days even if an infusion is missed.  
The dose should be given at approximately the same time each day (+/ - 2 hours for 
medication scheduling).  
Any dose that is delayed may be given later that calendar day. Any dose that is 
missed (not given that calendar day) is not made up. The treatment course continues 
as describe d above for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_780903].  
8.2.4  Contra indications  
Remdesivir is contraindicated in participants  with a history of hypersensitivity to 
remdesivir or any ingredient of the solution for injection .75 Clinical caution  should be 
exercised in individuals with hepatic or renal dysfunction, and hepatic and renal 
function should be checked prior to dosing  and monitored during therapy .75  
Remdesivir has not been studied in pregnancy, and use in pregnancy should be 
based on an individual assessment of risk/benefit by [CONTACT_1963].   
8.2.5  Dose Modification  
If the estimated g lomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) decreases to < 25 m L/min, the 
remdesivir  infusion should not be given on that day. The infusion may be resumed on 
the next day if the eGFR returns to ≥ 30 m L/min. If the participant ’s renal function 
worsens to the point tha t they require hemodialysis or hemofiltration, remdesivir  will 
be discontinued.  
If the ALT and/or AST increases to > than [ADDRESS_1073617]  reduces 
to ≤ 5 times the upper limit of normal.

8.3.1  Thromboprophylaxis  and diagnosis of thrombotic complications  
Consideration should be given to the use of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis 
(thrombosis prevention) in line with local clinical guidelines  as appropriate for an 
individual participant, in addition to approaches to maintain mobility and minimize

accordance with local and institutional guidelines and the medical circumstances of 
an individual participant may also be considered, including the use of low 
(prophylactic) dose unfractionated heparin (high quality ev idence), or higher doses 
than prophylactic doses as judged appropriate (low quality evidence).  Specialist 
advice should be sought for participants who are pregnant.  
An appropriate degree of clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_780904], including deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary 
embolism, and other vascular events. Use of laboratory testing such as D -dimer may 
be confounded in the presence of acute COVID -19 infection. Consideration should be 
given to use of def initive imaging strategies for diagnosis wherever possible (for 
example, limb ultrasonography, computed tomography pulmonary angiograms), as 
appropriate for an individual participant.  
8.3.[ADDRESS_1073619] Supportive Care  
Participants will be offered  supportive care of complications of COVID -19 as clinically 
appropriate for the individual.  
This includes appropriate management of pneumonia, hypoxemic respi[INVESTIGATOR_7518]/ARDS, sepsis and septic shock, cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia, acute kidney 
injury, and complic ations from prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], including secondary 
bacterial infections, thromboembolism, gastrointestinal bleeding, and critical illness 
polyneuropathy/myopathy.  Such care  includes treatment with anti -bacterial agents for 
patients believed to have bacterial infection (high quality evidence), and guidelines -
compliant management of sepsis when it is present (moderate quality evidence).  
For participants requiring intensive care measures , consideration should be given to 
supportive care measures including lung-protective ventilation for patients who 
require invasive ventilation (high quality evidence) and prone positioning for 
mechanically ventilated patients with more than moderate ARDS (high quality 
evidence) .79,80 
As note d in section 8.1.3, hIVIG administration, use of diuretics may be considered 
as clinically appropriate to avoid or treat fluid overload.  
Links to details of such care can be found in Appendix D.   
8.3.3  Cautions and Contraindications  
It is not recommended to use high dose chloroquine (600 mg twice daily) due to 
studies showing excess harm and no demonstrable benefit. (Hydroxy)chloroquine 
has no documented clinical benefit, and hence should not be used as part of SOC  for 
COVID -19. Of note, the effectiveness of remdesivir may  also be reduced if combined 
with (hydroxy) chloroquine , and hence it is not advisable to combine these two drugs ;

 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AN D PROCEDURES  9
 Screening /Baseline , Follow -up and Endpoint  Assessments  9.1
Data collection at each visit is outline d below and summarized in Appendix B . Day 0 
refers to the day on which randomization occurs and on which the hIVIG/placebo 
infusion is given.  Screening and baseline assessments can be done on the same 
day.  The term “baseline” refers to data t hat are collected prior to randomization.  
9.1.1  Screening /Baseline Assessments  
After obtaining  informed consent, the following assessments are performed within [ADDRESS_1073621]  baseline data : 
 Confirm EITHER:  
 -    the positive SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_1073622] result  (PCR or other NAT)  was performed within 
3 days prior to randomization or,  
- if more than 3 days prior to randomization, the prospective participant 
demonstrates progressive disease suggestive of ongoing SARS -CoV-2 
infection  
 Take a focused medical history , including the following information:  
− Demographics including age, biological sex 
− Day of onset of COVID -19 signs and symptoms  
− History of chronic medical conditions , including targeted conditions for 
outcome analys is  
− Medication allergies  
− Current use of targeted concomitant medications  
− Prior use of  monoclonal antibody treatment or SARS -CoV-2 vaccine trial 
participation  
 
 Perform a focused physical examination : 
− Height  and weight ;  
− Vital signs: Blood pressure, heart rate 
− Respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], oxygen requirements and saturation  
 
 Obtain blood for local laboratory evaluations:  
Protocol INSIGHT 013   Version 1.0, 20 Aug 2020  
Inpatient Treatment with  Anti-Coronavirus Immunoglobulin  IND # [ZIP_CODE]

 − White blood cell count  
− Hemoglobin  
− Platelets  
− Lymphocytes  
− C-reactive protein ( CRP )  
− Serum creatinine  
− Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase ( AST) 
 
 Determine disease status at entry (includes SpO2, oxygen requirements) for the 
constituents of the ordinal outcome categories.  
 
 Plasma and serum specimens for central testing for immunoglobulin levels, SARS -
CoV-2 neutralizing antibody determination and storage for future  COVID -19 related 
research ( four [4]  1 mL aliquots of serum and four [4]  1 mL aliquots of plasma).  
Two 9mL tubes, SST and EDTA, of blood (18 mL total) will be drawn in order 
obtain the 8 aliquots.  
 
 Mid-turbinate swab for determination of SARS -CoV-2 viral load in central 
laboratory  
 Urine or serum pregnancy test (in women of childbearing potential)  (not an 
exclusion criterion but performed to ensure any pregnancy is recognized at entry)  
Note: If a woma n is either postmenopausal (i.e., is age ≥ 45 years and has had ≥12 
months of spontaneous amenorrhea) or surgically sterile (i.e., has had a 
hysterectomy, bilateral ovariectomy (oophorectomy), or bilateral tubal ligation), she is 
not considered to be of ch ildbearing potential.  
 
The overall eligibility of the patient for the s tudy will be assessed once all screening 
values are available. The screening process can be suspended prior to complete 
assessment at any time if exclusions are identified by [CONTACT_2362].  
Participants  who qualify will be randomized  within [ADDRESS_1073623] ed: 
 Adverse events of any grade severity prior to starting the infusion  
 Start and stop times of the infusion of hIVIG/placebo and remdesivir  
 Infusion related reactions  
 Whether the completion of the infusion was as planned  
 Medication used prophylactically or therapeutically to manage infusion -
related reactions  
 Adverse events (AEs)  of any grade seve rity during and for 2 hours after the 
infusion

 SAFETY REPORTING  10
The safety evaluation of the study intervention includes several components, all of 
which will be regularly reviewed by [CONTACT_8030].  For this protocol, the 
term “study intervention” refers to the hIVIG /placebo and to remdesivir .  
With the excepti on of infusion related reactions of any grade, which are only collected  
for the hIVIG /placebo , all other AEs are collected  for the study intervention (either the 
hIVIG/placebo  or study -provided SOC treatment).   Selected events will be reported to 
regulator s and IRBs/ethics committees in addition to being regularly reviewed by [CONTACT_40746].  
The following information will be collected to evaluate safety:  
 Infusion -related reactions of any grade severity during and within [ADDRESS_1073629] -
infusio n of the hIVIG/placebo . 
 Clinical AEs of any grade severity will be collected on Days 0, 1, 3, 7, and 28 
(AEs present on those days).  
 Targeted laboratory abnormalities of any grade severity at Day 7. 
 Incident g rade 3 and 4 clinical adverse event s occurring through Day  7 
(isolated laboratory abnormalities that are not associated with signs or 
symptoms are not recorded) . 
 Clinical events that are collected as part of the primary  ordinal outcome or as 
secondary outcomes through  Day 28. These are protocol exempt events and 
are not reported as SAEs unless they are considered as related to the study 
intervention.  
 Serious adverse events , including laboratory -only serious events,  considered 
related to the study intervention (either the hIVIG/placebo  or a study -provided 
SOC treatme nt) through Day  28. 
 Serious adverse events that are not collected as part of the primary  ordinal 
outcome or as a secondary outcome through Day 28.   
 Unanticipated problems through Day 28. 
 Deaths through Day 28.

*** see section 10.2.5  for specific events  
 
Definitions and methods of reporting each type of event are given below.  
 Definitions  10.1
10.1.1  Adverse Event  (AE) 
An adverse event is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence  in a study 
participant, including any abnormal sign (e.g., abnormal physical exam or laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with their participation in 
Protocol INSIGHT 013   Version 1.0, 20 Aug 2020  
Inpatient Treatment with  Anti-Coronavirus Immunoglobulin  IND # [ZIP_CODE]  
46 
 research, whether or not considered related to the research.  If a diagnosis is  clinically 
evident (or subsequently determined), the diagnosis, rather than the individual signs 
and symptoms or lab abnormalities, will be recorded as the AE.  AEs are reported  on 
the appropriate case report form ( CRF) when prompted.  
10.1.2  Criteria for Serious ness 
Events are s erious if they lead to one of the following outcomes :  
 Death  
 Life-threatening (i.e., an immediate threat to life)  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318]  
 Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the abil ity to 
conduct normal life functions  
 Congenital abnormalities/birth defects  
 Other important medical evens that may jeopardize the participant and/or may 
require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above   
10.1.3  Unanticipated  Problems  
An unanticipated problem (UP) is any incident, experience or outcome that is:  
1. Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency in relation to:  
a. the research risks that are described in the IRB -approved research protocol 
and informed consent document; Inve stigator’s Brochure  (IB) or other study 
documents; and  
b. the characteristics of the population being studied; and  
2. Possibly, probably, or definitely related to participation in the research; and  
3. Places study participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized.  
 
Furthermore, a UP could be an expected event that occurs at a greater frequency 
than would be expected based on current knowledge of the disease and tre atment 
under study.  The DSMB providing oversight to the study may make such an 
assessment based on an aggregate analysis of events.  
10.1.[ADDRESS_1073630] to both seriousness  (results in 
outcomes as above)  and severity  (intensity or grade).  AEs will be graded for severity 
according to the DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse 
Events , (also known as the DAIDS AE Grading Table; see Appendix D for the URL).  
Protocol INSIGHT 013   Version 1.0, 20 Aug 2020  
Inpatient Treatment with  Anti-Coronavirus Immunoglobulin  IND # [ZIP_CODE]  
47 
 For specific events that are not included in the DAIDS AE Grading Table, the generic 
scale below  is to be used:  
TABLE 3. GENERIC AE GRADING SCALE  
Grade 1  Symptoms causing no or minimal interference with usual social and 
functional activities  
Grade 2  Symptoms causing greater than minimal interference with usual social 
and functional activities  
Grade 3  Symptoms causing inability to perform usual social and functional 
activities  
Grade 4  Symptoms causing inability to perform basic self -care functions, or 
medical or operative intervention indicated to prevent permanent 
impairment, persistent disability, or death  
Grade 5  Events resulting in death  
 
10.1.5  Causality  
Causality refers to the likelihood that the event is related to the study intervention.  It will 
be assessed for  SAEs and UPs.  This assessment will be made for both the agent under 
investigation (hIVIG) and the study -provided background therapy of remdesivir  using the 
following guidelines:  
 Reasonable possibility  – There is a clear temporal relationship between the study 
intervention and the event onset, and the AE is known to occur with the study 
intervention or there is a reasonable possibility that the study intervention caused the 
AE. Reasonable possibility me ans that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study intervention and the AE.  
 
 No reasonable possibility  – There is no evidence suggesting that the study 
intervention caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study 
intervention and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been established.  
 
The causality assessment  is based on available information at the time of the 
assessment of the event.  The investigator may revise these assessments as additional 
informat ion becomes available . 
10.1.6  Expectedness  
Expectedness will be assessed for SAEs using the Reference Safety Information section 
of the IBs for the hIVIG and remdesivir.  
Protocol INSIGHT 013   Version 1.0, 20 Aug 2020  
Inpatient Treatment with  Anti-Coronavirus Immunoglobulin  IND # [ZIP_CODE]  
48 
 The expectedness assessment is based on available information at the time of the 
assessment o f the event.  The investigator may revise these assessments as additional 
information becomes available.  
 Schedule for Data Collection and Reporting of Specific 10.2
Events  
10.2.1  Infusion -related reactions  
Infusion related signs/symptoms of any grade that  are new or h ave increased in 
grade compared to their pre -infusion level are reported for the hIVIG/p lacebo if they 
occur during or within  [ADDRESS_1073631] results 
reported on the eCRFs with normal ranges, and with the DAIDS AE Grading Table . 
 
Other laboratory abnormalities identified in the course of the participant’s cli nical care 
are not reported as AEs (e.g., an isolated elevated glucose level) unless they are 
associated with a specific clinical diagnosis/syndrome, in which case they are 
reported if they meet the reporting criteria of one of the oth er safety outcomes.  In 
addition , if an isolated laboratory test result meets SAE reporting criteria  (e.g., a 
serious event related to the study intervention) , it should be reported as an SAE.  
 
10.2.3  Clinical adverse events of any grade severity on Days 0, 1, 3, 7 and 28  
On Day 0 prior to infusion and on Days 1, 3, 7 and 28 the prevalence of AEs of any 
grade severity that the participant reports that day will be collected.  This information 
supplements the information on grade 3 and 4 events through Day 7 that is collected.  
10.2.4  Incid ent Grade 3 and 4 clinical adverse events through Day 7  
From the time of randomization on Day 0 through Day 7, clinical events reaching 
Grade 3 or 4 severity level will be reported as AEs unless they are a protocol -
specified exempt event (see below).   
 
Any medical condition of grade 1 and 2 that is present at Day 0 will be reported as an 
AE if it increases to Grade 3 or 4 by [CONTACT_2006] 7. 
 
Isolated laboratory abnormalities will not be recorded on the eCRF  for grade 3 and 4 
events .  However, as noted above, if an isolated laboratory result meets SAE criteria, 
it should be reported as an SAE.  
Protocol INSIGHT 013   Version 1.0, 20 Aug 2020  
Inpatient Treatment with  Anti-Coronavirus Immunoglobulin  IND # [ZIP_CODE]  
49 
 10.2.5  Protocol -specified exempt events  
These events are listed in sections 4.1 and 4.2 and are collected systematically 
during study follow -up on eCRFs . These events will not be repo rted as Grade 3 or 4 
AEs even if they occur at that severity grade.  They also will not be reported as SAEs, 
even if they meet one or more of the criteria for seriousness, unless the investigator 
considered that there was a reasonable possibility that the study intervention 
caused the event .  These events may occur during the initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], lead to 
a re-admission, or occur in a later hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10090] -up.  
The following are protocol -specified exempt events : 
 Death  
 Stroke  
 Meningitis  
 Encephalitis  
 Myelitis  
 Myocardial infarction  
 Myocarditis  
 Pericarditis  
 New onset of worsening of CHF (NYHA class 3 or 4)  
 Arterial or deep venous  thromboembolic events  
 Respi[INVESTIGATOR_780905], noninvasive  
ventilation, or invasive ventilation  
 Hypotension requiring vasopressor therapy  
 Renal dysfunction requiring renal replacement therapy  
 Hepatic decompensation  
 Acute  delirium  
 Disseminated intravascular coagulation  
 Microbiologically -proven severe infection (n ot including SARS -CoV-2) 
 
10.2.6  Reportable SAEs  
Reportable SAEs for this study are:  
 Serious clinical AEs not reported as a study endpoint; and  
 Any serious AE related to the study intervention  
Deaths, life -threatening events, and others SAEs considered related to the 
investigational agent, irrespective of whether the event is mentioned above as a 
protocol -specified exempt event, that occur from the time of infusion of the 
hIVIG/placebo  begins th rough the Day [ADDRESS_1073632] be reported within 3 days 
of site awareness.  
Protocol INSIGHT 013   Version 1.0, 20 Aug 2020  
Inpatient Treatment with  Anti-Coronavirus Immunoglobulin  IND # [ZIP_CODE]  
50 
 SAEs are fol lowed until the outcome of the SAE is known.  If the outcome of an SAE 
is still unknown at the time of the final follow -up visit (Day 28), the outcome will be 
entered in the database as “unknown.”  
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) are  SAEs that are 
assessed as related to a study -provided treatment and are unexpected per the 
Reference Safety Information of the IB for that treatment.  S[LOCATION_003]Rs are reported from 
the INSIGHT Safety Office to applicable regulators in an expedited fashion.  SU SARs 
that result in death or are immediately life -threatening are reported to regulators 
within 7 calendar days of receipt.  All other S[LOCATION_003]Rs are reported to regulators within 
15 calendar days.  The INSIGHT Safety Office will generate a Safety Report for e ach 
S[LOCATION_003]R for distribution to investigators and other parties.  Investigators are 
responsible for submitting Safety Report summaries that are received from the 
sponsor to their overseeing IRB/EC.  Investigators must also comply with all reporting 
requireme nts of their overseeing IRB/EC.  
Safety reports for S[LOCATION_003]Rs indicate the study intervention (i.e., are unblinded).  
SAEs that are not protocol -specified exempt events and that are not related to the 
study intervention (investigational agent or treatment provi ded as SOC) must be 
reported on the SAE eCRF within 3 days of site awareness.  
 
10.2.7  Unanticipated Problems (U Ps) 
UPs must also be reported via the appropriate eCRF to the INSIGHT Safety Office no 
later than 7 calendar days after site awareness of the event. Inv estigators are 
responsible for submitting UPs that are received from the sponsor to their overseeing 
IRB/EC.  Investigators must also comply with all reporting requirements of their 
overseeing IRB/EC.  
 
10.2.8  Deaths  
Deaths that are considered unrelated to the study intervention are reported on the 
eCRF for deaths.   Deaths considered related to the study intervention (investigational 
agent or study -supplied SOC) must also be reported as an SAE.   
 Medical  Monitor  10.3
A Medical Monitor appointed by [CONTACT_780946], making an independent assessment of causality and expectedness, preparing 
sponsor safety reports,  and communicat ing as needed with the DSMB and the 
Investigational New Drug ( IND) holder.  
 
 Treatment Interruption or Disc ontinuation  10.4
An infusion  may be interrupted or discontinued at any time at the participant ’s request 
or at the discretion of the Investigator or Sponsor. Reasons for interruption or 
discontinuation and the total volume administered will be recorded.  
Protocol INSIGHT 013   Version 1.0, 20 Aug 2020

safety reasons (e.g., unacceptabl y high rate of infusion -related reactions or other 
unanticipated AEs).  As a guideline, the DSMB will be asked to consider halting 
enrollment if mo re than 5% of participants experience a grade 3 or 4 infusion AE or if 
more than 10% do not complete the infusion due to an AE(s). This will be informed by 
[CONTACT_780947]. If the study is temporarily halt ed or 
stopped for safety reasons, IRBs/ethics committees will be informed.  
The IND holder and s ponsor, in collaboration with the  protocol chair  and the DSMB 
will determine if it is safe to resume the study. The sponsor will notify the Site 
Investigators o f this decision. The conditions for resumption of the study will be 
defined in this notification. The Site Investigators will notify their local IRB s/ethics 
committees  of the decision to resume the study.  
 EVALUATION  11
 Data Analysis  11.1
A brief summary of the sta tistical considerations is provided here, full details will be 
described in a statistical analysis plan (SAP)  that will be finalized prior to unblinding 
of the data.  Data unblinding will either occur after a recommendation from the 
independent DSMB or after all participants complete the Day 28 follow -up visit.  
The primary analysis will be by [CONTACT_780948].  The different  hIVIG products 
will be pooled for this analysis .  
This analysis plan applies to the primary efficacy and safety  outcomes,  and important 
secondary outcomes . 
For the primary endpoint, the percent of pa rticipants  in the 7 categories of the ordinal 
outcome will be compared.  A proportional odds model will be u sed to estimate a 
summary OR.82 The model will include a  single indicator for treatment , indicators for 
the pa rticipant ’s clinical state at entry (categories of ordinal outcome) , and its two -way 
interactions with the six cut -offs. The model will also includ e indicators for which of 
the four hIVIG  product /matching placebo  product was used  and their two -way 
interactions with the six cutoffs for each of the six cumulative odds of improvement . A 
test for the proportional odds assumption  will be carried out.  Even if the proportional 
odds assumption is violated, the overall summary OR will be the basis for inference 
based on the primary analysis. In order to further characterize the summary OR and 
any deviations from proportional odds , separate ORs will be est imated for each of the 
six dichotomized definitions of improvement that can be formulated from the 
components of the ordinal outcome.  
Protocol INSIGHT 013   Version 1.0, 20 Aug 2020  
Inpatient Treatment with  Anti-Coronavirus Immunoglobulin  IND # [ZIP_CODE]  
52 
 For the primary endpoint analysis only, multiple imputation based on baseline and 
follow -up data will be used to estimate  participant status at day 7 for participants with 
missing follow -up data.  For this imputation the following baseline covariates will be 
considered in addition to an indicator for treatment group: age, geographic region, 
clinical status based on the ordin al outcome at enrollment, presence of comorbidities, 
NEW score, and oxygen saturation. In addition to these baseline covariates, the last 
NEW score and the last value of the ordinal outcome measured will be used in the 
imputation.  
We will impute ten data s ets; parameter estimates (e.g., the summary odds ratio) 
from the 10 multiply imputed dataset s will be combined using Rubin’s combining 
rules. The imputation will take into account whether partial information concerning the 
ordinal outcome at Day 7 is known  (e.g., it is known that the patient is alive and no 
longer hospi[INVESTIGATOR_780906] 2 
categories the patient is in is unknown).  
Categories 3 and 4 of the primary ordinal outcome differ in part by [CONTACT_780949], and a single cut point  (4 liters/minute) defines the 
difference. Since, together, these 2 categories of the ordinal outcome are expected to 
include approximately 30% of participants, an analysis that combines these two 
categories (a 6 -category ordinal outcome) will be carried to supplement the primary 
analysis  using the same methods described above.   
SAEs and grade 3 and 4 events (excluding isolated  laboratory abnormalities) will be 
classified by [CONTACT_780950] g to MedDRA . The composite of incident  
grade 3 or 4 event s, an SAE or death over 7 days of follow -up will be summarized 
with Mantel Haen szel chi -square tests stratified by [CONTACT_780951]/matched placebo group . 
Time to event methods  (e.g., Kaplan -Meier estimates and Cox regression)  will be 
used to summarize deaths and SAEs through Day 28 . 
Safety analyses will also include infusion reactions collected during or within 2 hours 
after the infusion of hIVIG/placebo.  Percentages of partic ipants who experience 
infusion reactions or prematurely terminated infusions will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_6660], and Cochran Mantel Haenszel tests will be used to compare 
groups.  
For secondary endpoints such as time to discharge  and time to the [ADDRESS_1073634] favorable 
categories of the primary ordinal outcome , time to event methods that take into 
account the competing risk of death  will be used . Specifically, Gray’s test with rho=0, 
the Fine -Gray model, and the Aalen -Johansen estimator for the cumulative incid ence 
curve are the competing risk equivalents to the log -rank test, Cox proportional 
hazards model , and the Kaplan -Meier estimator for the cumulative proportion of 
participants with the event, respectively.83,84,85 
Longitudinal random effects models will be used to summarize log -transformed 
antibody level differences between the hIVIG and placebo groups at Days 1, 3, 7 and 
28 of follow -up. Baseline antibody levels will be included as a cova riate in these 
Protocol INSIGHT 013   Version 1.0, 20 Aug 2020

53 
 models.  For the subset of participants for whom blood is collected at Day 90, 
antibody levels  will be compared.   
Subgroup analyses for the primary 7-category ordinal outcome (primary efficacy 
outcome), as well as for the primary safety outcome  (Grade 3 and 4 event s, SAE or 
death through Day 7) will be performed to determine whether the treatment effect 
(hIVIG versus placebo) differs across baseline -defined subgroups. The key subgroup 
analys is is by [CONTACT_780952] .  For the subgroup of participants 
in the lower 3 quartiles, the OR for the primary ordinal outcome at Day 7 is 
hypothesized to be greater than the overall result and those in the upper quartile  
(longest duration of symptoms at study entry) .  The difference in ORs will be 
compared for those  in the lower 3 quartiles versus the upper quartile.  In addition, the 
trend across the four quartiles will be asses sed.   
The following other baseline -defined subgroups will be considered:  age, gender, 
race/ethnicity, BMI, history of chronic conditions,  geographic region, hIVIG product  
administered , neutralizing antibody level , baseline u pper respi[INVESTIGATOR_780895] -CoV-[ADDRESS_1073635] no reason to 
believe the clinical efficacy or safety of hIVIG compared to placebo will be 
substantially different in any of the subgroups considered. These analyses will be 
approached cautiously because random differences can occur  (type 1 error is i nflated 
due to the number of subgroups examined),  confounding due to other factors in 
defining each subgroup is possible, and power is limited . To partially control the 
inflation of type [ADDRESS_1073636] (treatment by [CONTACT_226418]) 
will be constructed to assess how strong the evidence is that the treatment effect 
varies across the baseline subgroups.  
In addition to these subgroup analyses, a subgroup analysis by [CONTACT_780953].  The aim of this analysis will be to determine if the primary outcome 
varies by [CONTACT_780954].  The potency of 
each lot will be measured by a central laboratory.  Participants in the placebo group 
will be classified according the lot potency they would have received had they been 
randomly assigned to the hIVIG group.  The methods used for this subgroup analysis 
will be as de scribed above.  
If there is a beneficial effect of hIVIG  compared to placebo , in order to support 
regulatory claims for each hIVIG product used, sensitivity analyses comparing each 
hIVIG product to its matched placebo will be carried out for key efficacy a nd sa fety 
endpoints . These analyses will consider that each hIVIG product will be used by a 
different group of clinical sites  (i.e., each comparison will represent a small multi -
center trial), and that power w ill likely be very low for all of the outcomes.  These 
analyses are referred to as sensitivity analyses because overall therapeutic efficacy 
and safety will be based on the pooled analysis of the four hIVIG products with 
placebo.

The study will be conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki in its current 
version; the requirements of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) as defined in Guidelines, 
EU Clinical Trials Directive (2001/20/EC), and EU GCP Directive (2005/28/EC); 
Internatio nal Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for 
Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Guidelines; Human Subject Protection and

the local law and regulation, whiche ver affords greater protection  of human subjects . 
  Data Monitoring by [CONTACT_780919]  11.[ADDRESS_1073638] been followed for 7 days.  Thereafter, the DSMB will 
review safety data at 30 day intervals. Safety summaries will include the safety 
outcomes in section 4.2. The DSMB may also convene additional reviews as 
necessary.  After each meeting they will recommend continuing the study as planned, 
modifying the study, or terminating the study .  
The DSMB will be asked to recommend early termination or modification only when 
there is clear and substantial evidence of a treatment difference.  As a guideline, 
asymmetric  boundaries will be provided to the DSMB to monitor the primary endpoint 
comparison.  For monitoring early benefit of hIVIG , the Lan -DeMets spending function 
analog ue of the O’Brien -Fleming boundar y will be used86,87; a H aybittle -Peto type 
boundary using a 2.[ADDRESS_1073639] deviation (SD) difference for the first [ADDRESS_1073640] completed 7 days of follow -up 
divided by [CONTACT_780955] ( currently  500). With this guideline for early 
termination , less evidence will be required for crossing a boundary for ha rm than 
benefit.  
Futility analyses will also be presented to the DSMB for the primary endpoint 
comparison by [CONTACT_780956].  
Conditional power incorporates the observed results by [CONTACT_780957] (and 
uses the originally as sumed treatment effect for future data) to calculate the 
conditional probability of obtaining a significant result by [CONTACT_124808].  If 
conditional power, given the observed data and assuming the originally hypothesized 
treatment effect thereafter, is less than 20% after 50% of information (primary 
endpoints) is available, consideration should be given to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_21356].

 A SAP will be developed to guide DSMB interim analyses.  The SAP will include 
recommended analyses for the DSMB to consider in a ddition to the primary endpoint 
analysis in the event early termination for efficacy or futility is considered.  For 
example, the primary endpoint at Day 7 for the key previously defined subgroup of 
those in the lower 3 quartiles of symptom duration  at entr y will be routinely 
summarized  in the closed interim report to the DSMB . 
All of t hese analyses will consider the timeliness of reporting primary outcome data, 
secondary efficacy and safety outcomes, and subgroups.

check your medical history.  They will look at routine medical test results that you are 
probably already having done regularly in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].   
If you agree to be  in the study, we will randomize you to one of two study groups.  It will be 
up to chance, like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin, and you will have an equal chance (50/50) of getting either 
hIVIG or a saline placebo (a salt solution).  Your doctor will not decide which of th ese you will 
get, and neither you nor your doctor or study staff will know what treatment you are getting.   
You will get the usual supportive care for COVID -[ADDRESS_1073644] been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  
You will get the study treatment ( hIVIG or placebo) once, on the day you join the study.  You 
will get it by a drip through a tube attached to a needle in your arm (intravenously).  It will

they will not be used for researc h aimed at making money (commercial research).  The 
samples will not have any information connected to them that could identify you.  
Why would you want to be in the study?  
If you get the hIVIG, it may help you get better faster, although we do not know that  for sure.  
Remember that half (50%) of the people in this study will not get the hIVIG.  
By [CONTACT_55825], you help doctors know more about how to treat COVID -[ADDRESS_1073650] if a treatment proves to be effective.  
Why would you NOT want to be in the study?  
Only half (50%) of the people in this study will get the hIVIG.  You may not get the hIVIG.  If 
hIVIG turns out to be a good treatment, you would n ot get that benefit.  It’s also possible that 
if you do get hIVIG, it may turn out not to be useful, or may cause side effects that are 
harmful to you.  
What are the side effects of the study hIVIG treatment?  
hIVIG is usually very safe to give.  Similar immunoglobulin preparations have  been used in 
many different diseases over many year s, but immunogloblin prepared solely from 
individuals who have recovered from COVID -[ADDRESS_1073651] some side effects from hIVIG.  About 
1% to  10% (1 in 100 people to  1 in 10 people) who get hIVIG get a fever, chills, nausea, 
vomiting, dizziness, shortness of breath, rash, hives, or headache, but these are usually not 
serious.   These can happen during the infusion or afterwards and usually go away on their 
own or with short -term treatment.   Although IVIG has been very safe for people with other 
diseases, less than 0.1%  (less than 1 in 1,000) of people taking other types of IVIG for other 
illnesses have had very serious reactions to it, including a kind of lung injury ca lled TRALI.  
Protocol INSIGHT 013   Version 1.0, 20 Aug 2020

no side effects.  You will be mon itored closely during the infusions, and short -term medical 
care will be provided if there are side effects from the infusions that can be treated.  
 
What are the benefits and risks or side effects of remdesivir treatment?  
Remdesivir was recently shown to help people who are in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103182] -[ADDRESS_1073653] no side effects.  You will be monitored closely during the infusions, and short -term 
medical care will be provided if  there are side effects from the infusions that can be treated.  
 
What are the side effects of the other study procedures?  
 
As shown in the table of what will happen at each visit, you will have some extra blood 
drawn for laboratory testing and storage.  Yo u will also have an extra swab of your nose and 
throat that would not be done if you are not in the study.  The risks and discomforts of these

Here is some additional information about the study that may help you make your choice 
about whether you want to be in the study.  
The US National Institutes of Health  (NIH) , an agency of the US Federal government, is 
paying for this study.  Because public money is paying for the study, we are required to 
comply with all rules and regulations about research.  We are doing this study according to 
internationally recognized standards of research as we ll as the laws of each country where 
the study is taking place.   
This study is taking place in several countries.  We expect to enroll about [ADDRESS_1073655].   
Your study participation may be stopped without your consent if:  
 The groups overseeing the study decide the study should be stopped;  
 Your study team believes that being in the study is no l onger in your best interests.  
 
If your participation is stopped, you will still get the usual care given at your hospi[INVESTIGATOR_780908] -19. 
If you do not want to be in this study, you will still get the usual care to treat COVID -19. 
However, you cannot get the  hIVIG treatment, because it is experimental.  
 
What are the costs to you?  
We will give you the study treatment (hIVIG or placebo) at no cost.  We will also give you 
remdesivir at no cost.  We will pay for all clinic visits, lab work, and other tests that are part 
of this study .

 Key information:   
We are asking you to join a research study about COVID -19. It is your choice whether or not 
you want to join.  This form gives you information about the study that will help you make 
your choice.  You can discuss this information with your d octor or family or anyone else you 
would like before you make your choice.  Your choice will not affect the care you are getting 
for COVID -19. 
What is the research question?  
We are trying to find out if giving  anti-coronavirus hyperimmune  intravenous immuno globulin 
(hIVIG) can help people in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103182] -[ADDRESS_1073661] to do if you decide to be in the study?  
The study staff at your  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_780907].  They will 
check your medical history.  They will look at routine medical test results that you are 
probably already having done regularly in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].   
If you agree to be in the study, we will randomize you to one of two study groups.  It will be 
up to chance, like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin, and you will have an equal chance (50/50) of getting either 
hIVIG or a saline placebo (a salt solution).  Your doctor will not decide which of these you will 
get, and neither you nor your doctor or study staff will know what treatment you are getting.   
You will get the usual supportive care for COVID -[ADDRESS_1073662] been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  
You will get the study treatment ( hIVIG or placebo) once, on the day you join the study.  You 
will get it by a drip through a tube attached to a needle in your arm (intravenously).  It will 
take about 1-[ADDRESS_1073663] 7 
days you are in this study.

they will not be used for research aimed at making money (commercial research).  The 
samples will not have any information connected to them that could identify you.  
Why would you want to be in the study?  
If you get the hIVIG, it may help you get better faster, although we do not know that for sure.  
Remember that half (50%) of the people in this study will not get the hIVIG.  
By [CONTACT_55825], you he lp doctors know more about how to treat COVID -[ADDRESS_1073667] if a treatment proves to be effective.  
Why would you NOT want to be in the study?  
Only hal f (50%) of the people in this study will get the hIVIG.  You may not get the hIVIG.  If 
hIVIG turns out to be a good treatment, you would not get that benefit.  It’s also possible that 
if you do get hIVIG, it may turn out not to be useful, or may cause side  effects that are 
harmful to you.  
What are the side effects of the study hIVIG treatment?  
hIVIG is usually very safe to give.  Similar immunoglobulin preparations have  been used in 
many different diseases over many year s, but immunogloblin prepared solely f rom 
individuals who have recovered from COVID -[ADDRESS_1073668] some side effects from hIVIG.  About 
1% to  10% (1 in 100 people to 1 in 10 people) who get hIVIG get a fever, chills, nausea, 
vomiting, dizziness, shortness of breath, rash, hives, or headache, but  these are usually not 
serious.   These can happen during the infusion or afterwards and usually go away on their 
own or with short -term treatment.   Although IVIG has been very safe for people with other 
diseases, less than 0.1%  (less than 1 in 1,000) of pe ople taking other types of IVIG for other 
illnesses have had very serious reactions to it, including a kind of lung injury called TRALI.  
Protocol INSIGHT 013   Version 1.0, 20 Aug 2020

no side effects.  You will be monitored closely during the infusions, and short -term medical 
care will be provided if there are side effects from the infusions that  can be treated.  
 
What are the benefits and risks or side effects of remdesivir treatment?  
Remdesivir was recently shown to help people who are in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_103182] -[ADDRESS_1073670] no side effects .  You will be monitored closely during the infusions, and short -term 
medical care will be provided if there are side effects from the infusions that can be treated.  
 
What are the side effects of the other study procedures?  
 
As shown in the table of what will happen at each visit, you will have some extra blood 
drawn for laboratory testing and storage.  You will also have an extra swab of your nose and 
throat that would not be done if you are not in the study.  The risks and d iscomforts of these

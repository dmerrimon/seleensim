Title of Study: 18F-AV-1451- A16 
A Clinico -Pathological Study of the Correspondence Between 18F-AV-[ADDRESS_725629]- Mortem Assessment of Tau Pathology 
Study Participants:  
Planned number of subjects enrolled: Approximately 200 
Planned number of autopsies: Approximately 80 
Approximately 200 subjects with terminal medical conditions and projected life 
expectancy of ≤ [ADDRESS_725630]- mortem histological data on approximately 80 subjects. Enrollment will not be 
formally stratified, but an effort will be made to enroll subjects with cognitive status 
ranging from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia to 
achieve a full range of tau pathology. It is expected that at least 65% of the subjects 
enrolled will have dementia or MCI.  
Front -Runners : 
Up to the first 6 subjects that come to autopsy will be considered front-runners. Avid will 
not be blinded to the front-runner imaging and pathology results and may use these to  
evaluate the study methods and refine the methods if needed for the subsequent blinded 
cases. Subjects that are part of the front-runners will not be included in the P rimary 
Efficacy P opulation. 
Primary Efficacy  Population :  
All subjects with valid autopsies that occur after the f ront- runner group has completed and 
before the sample size requirement /trial stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418] (below) have  been met will be 
considered part of the Primary Efficacy Population.  Some subjects may have died and had autopsy material removed at the time the sample size requirement is met. Subjects for 
whom autopsies are ongoing at the time the sample size requirement is met  will also be 
included in the P rimary Efficacy Population.

Primary Objective :  
This study is designed to test the relationship between ante -mortem 18F-AV-1451 Positron 
Emission Tomography ( PET) imaging and tau neurofibrillary pathology associated with 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) , as measured at autopsy. To accomplish this goal, t wo primary 
analyses will be performed :  
Primary Analysis 1  
The diagnostic performance (sensitivity/specificity ) of 5 independent readers ’ 
interpretations  of ante- mortem 18F-AV-1451 PET imaging for detection of a pattern of 
18F-AV-1451 neocortical uptake that corresponds to Neurofibrillary Tangle ( NFT ) 
Score of B3 (Hyman et al., 2012; Montine et al. , 2012) at autopsy will be evaluated; 
and if success criteria are met , 
Primar y Analysis 2 
The diagnostic performance ( sensitivity/specificity ) of 5 independent readers ’ 
interpretations  of ante- mortem 18F-AV-1451 PET imaging for detection of a pattern of 
18F-AV-1451 neocortical uptake that corresponds to high levels of AD neuropathologic 
change as defined by [CONTACT_349526] - Alzheimer’s Association  (NIA -AA) 
criteria ( Hyman et al., 2012) will be evaluated . For individuals with cognitive 
impairment, high  level s of AD neuropathologic change are considered adequate to 
explain cognitive impairment or dementia symptoms . 
The trial will be considered successful if both co-primary endpoints are met according to 
the Statistical Analysis Plan.   
Secondary Objective:  
Secondary Analysis 1: To assess diagnostic performance of  ante- mortem 18F-AV-1451 
PET imaging , based on majority interpretation of 5 independent readers , for detection 
of a pattern of 18F-AV-1451 neocortical uptake that corresponds to Neurofibrillary 
Tangle (NFT) Score of B3 and for detection of a pattern of 18F-AV-1451 neocortical 
uptake that corresponds to high levels of AD neuropathologic change as defined by 
[CONTACT_349526] - Alzheimer’s Association  (NIA -AA) criteria . 
Secondary Analysis 2: To assess agreement among readers  of 18F-AV-1451 PET 
scans .

Study Design:  
This study is a clinic o-pathological study of the correspondence between 18F-AV-[ADDRESS_725633] been designed to be tolerable for eligible  end-
of-life patients.  Individuals with terminal medical conditions  with  projected life 
expectancy of ≤ 6 months and/ or their legally authorized representative (LAR) will 
provide informed consent. T he subject will then  receive a PET scan with 18F-AV-[ADDRESS_725634] a historical  brain  Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging ( MRI ), acquired within [ADDRESS_725635] may be given the 
opportunity to undergo a second  18F-AV-1451 PET scan and continue in the protoc ol at 
the sponsor’s discretion ( screening assessments will not need to be repeated). If the subject 
subsequently comes to autopsy, the second scan (nearest to time of death) will be used in 
the efficacy analyses.  See below for exceptions related to cognitively normal subjects. 
Approximately [ADDRESS_725636]- mortem autopsy evaluation 
(including the Primary Efficacy Cohort and up to 6 subjects in a Front-Runner Cohort). 
The Primary Efficacy Cohort will form the basis for the tests of diagnostic performance  
(subjects for whom autopsies are ongoing at the time the sample size requirement is met 
will also be included in the Primary Efficacy Population) . The primary efficacy cohort will 
include all subjects with a valid PET scan  that come to autopsy before the sample size 
requirement/trial stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_23893]. In order to  control for the potential progressive 
change in tau deposition over time, c ognitively impaired s ubjects will not have an autopsy 
performed or be included in the primary efficacy cohort if death does not occur within 
nine months of a valid imaging session.   However, because cortical tau deposition is 
expected to occur very slowly, if  at all, in c ognitively normal (unimpaired) subjects, 
cognitively normal subjects will not be required to undergo repeat scans. Cognitively 
normal subjects will remain eligible for  autopsy, regardless of time from first scan  or 
second scan to autopsy, and will be included in the primary efficacy cohort  if the subject 
comes to autopsy any time before the trial stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_23893]. 
Up to  the first 6 subjects that come to autopsy will be considered front- runners.  Results 
from the front-runners will be analyzed on a patient -by-patient basis  and may be used to 
refine the PET or autopsy methods (e.g. pathology staining/quantitation methods ). Upon 
completion of the final front -runner subject  analysis , the final imaging and autopsy

performed until the PET imag e read and autopsy methods have been finalized.  The 
primary efficacy analyse s will be performed on those subjects  with valid imaging data that

DMB will have the ability to recommend unblinding the Sponsor to all [ADDRESS_725639] anomalies not present in the 
early phase studies . Study enrollment will continue during the DMB’s review. In the event 
the Sponsor proceeds with a DMB recommendation for unblinding, the unblinded subjects 
will be excluded from the P rimary Efficacy Cohort (neither the scans nor any autopsies 
will be used in the primary analyse s) or the study may be terminated . If unblinding occurs, 
it must be completed before the final image read and autopsy methods are specified. 
Avid personnel will be blinded to the Primary Efficacy Cohort 18F-AV-1451 PET images .  
A single Avid member will perform periodic quality assurance ( QA) by [CONTACT_42574] a listing  
of the PET image header data (not to exceed 20% unless issues identified that warrant 
additional review ). These QA reviews will serve to ensure image quality control processes 
at the imaging core lab oratory are adequately performed. Avid staff performing the PET 
image data header  QA assessment will not be aware of  the clinical status for the 
subjects/images being reviewed.  The independent blinded readers and DMB will be 
blinded to the subject clinical status and autopsy results. The pathology core lab (s) will be 
blinded to the subject clinical status , PET scan images, and read results . All other Avid 
personnel will be blinded to the Primary Efficacy C ohort 18F-AV-1451 read results and 
pathology data. 
Visits and Assessments:  
Each subject will have a screening visit, up to two 18F-AV-[ADDRESS_725640]- mortem evaluation.  
Specific details of assessments that will be performed at each visit are detailed in Section

Details of the visual PET image review methods will be provided in the Blinded Read Manual.  
Images will also be assessed quantitatively (semi- automated computerized measurement 
of Standard Upta ke Value Ratios [ SUVRs ]) for exploratory analysis purposes. Details of 
the analysis methods will be provided in the Quantitative Methodology Document.  
The 
18F-AV-1451 PET imaging results will not be shared with the investigator sites  or 
subjects and their families  prior to the end of the study.  
Neuropathology Evaluation 
All neuropathological measurements on brain tissue in this trial will be evaluated in a 
standardized and blinded (with respect to PET image results and subject 
identifying/clinical information) fashion in a qualified laboratory. A Technical Autopsy 
Manual and Neuropathology Analysis Plan will be developed for this study containing all methods and measurement procedures. Neuropathological assessment will be derived from 
the NIA -AA guidelines ( Hyman  et al., 2012; Montine et al. , 2012).  Sections from brain 
regions recommended for pathological assessment of AD, as well as additional, pre-
specified neocortical regions will be sampled . Staining will follow the procedures 
recommended in the NIA- AA practical approach guidelines . NFT extent will be assessed  
using standard procedures and NFT scores  (B0-B3) will be recorded  (Hyman  et al. , 2012; 
Montine et al. , 2012). The Truth S tandard  (TS) for Primary Analysis 1 will be constructed 
from NFT scores as shown in Table 1.

Primary Analysis 2  
The diagnostic performance (sensitivity/specificity ) of 5 independent readers’ 
interpretations  of ante- mortem 18F-AV-1451 PET imaging for detection of a pattern of 
18F-AV-1451 neocortical uptake that corresponds to high levels of AD neuropathologic 
change as defined by [CONTACT_45455] -AA criteria (Hyman  et al.,  2012) will be evaluated. For 
individuals with cognitive impairment, high  level s of AD neuropathologic change are 
considered adequate to explain cognitive impairment or dementia symptoms . 
The trial will be considered successful if both co-primary endpoints are met according to 
the Statistical Analysis Plan .  
For Primary A nalysis 1, the hypothesis to be test ed is that for the same 3 out of 5 
independent readers the lower bound of the two -sided  95% confidence intervals (CI) for 
both sensitivity and the specificity of 18F-AV-1451 PET reading results will be ≥ 50%. As 
detailed in  Table 1 above, NFT scores  for autopsy cases will be categorized as either 
B0/B1/B2 or B3 level and will serve as the NFT Score TS for this analysis. 18F-AV-1451 
PET imaging  will be classified as eith er AD- or AD+/AD++  by [CONTACT_552131] r. Sensitivity 
and specificity will be calculated  for each reader  as the proportions of True Positive (TP) 
and True Negative (TN) cases  correctly identified as such,  according to Table  3 below:

(i.e., statistically significant at two -sided significance level of 0.05).  
Like Primary Analysis 1, the hypothesis to be tested for Primary Analysis 2 is that for the 
same 3 out of 5 readers, the lower bound of the 95% CIs for both sensitivity and the 
specificity will be ≥ 50%. For  Primary  Analysis  2, autopsy cases will be categorized as 
either [not, low or intermediate ] vs. [ high] level of AD neuropathologic change according 
to NIA -AA criteri a, considering Braak stage, Thal plaque score, and CERAD amyloid

18F-AV-1451 PET images will be interpreted by [CONTACT_552132]- or

individual reader’s scan interpretation results. Sensitivity and specificity, and two-sided 
95% CI thereof, will be calculated for the majority interpretation results  relative to the 
appropriate TS. The hypothes es to be tested are: 
1a: the majority reading result will have the lower bounds of two -sided 95% CI ≥ 55 % 
for both sensitivity and specificity for detection of tau neurofibrillary pathology that 
corresponds to NFT Scores of B3, and

for both sensitivity and specificity for detection of a pattern of 18F-AV-1451 
neocortical uptake that corresponds to high levels of AD neuropathologic change as 
defined by [CONTACT_45455] -AA criteria . 
Secondary Analysis 2: Assess agreement among readers of 18F-AV-1451 PET scans: 
Fleiss’ Kappa statistics will be used to assess inter -reader agreement for the diagnostic 
decisions associated with Primary Analyses [ADDRESS_725646] is the observed kappa values are  ≥ 0.64 and the lower bound of the two-sided 95% 
CIs for this assessment are ≥ 0.55. 
Safety data will be tabulated.  
 
Sample Size Calculation and T rial Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_552117]/specificity of approximately 80%, a minimum of [ADDRESS_725647] groups (pathological positive or negative) is required for the 
lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI to be > 50% for each individual reader.  T he sponsor 
is blinded to the pathology results (truth standard) until after the study is completed and 
the database is locked.  Therefore, in order to ensure that an adequate number of subjects 
are recruited and come to autopsy for each truth standard group, the sponsor will assume that subjects diagnosed on clinical grounds as having dementia due to AD will be truth 
standard positive, subjects diagnosed as having no cognitive impairment (cognitively 
normal) will be truth standard negative.  Based on these assumptions, the study sample size requirement and trial stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_552118]

The sponsor recognizes that there may be some errors in clinical diagnosis such that some 
patients diagnosed clinically as having impairment due to AD may have a nonAD 
pathology, or limited amounts of AD tau pathology, and thus be truth standard negative, 
and, less often, subjects considered clinically normal may have AD pathology and be truth 
standard positive.  However, given the excess frequency of  cases with AD diagnoses 
relative to clinically normal subjects already recruited in this trial population, any 
diagnos tic errors will likely help ensure a minimum of [ADDRESS_725649] 
positive/negative AD tau pathology is very difficult to predict and will depend on the precise cases enrolled .  Thus , it is not expected that these cases will be useful in estimating 
when a sufficient number of cases have occurred in  each truth standard group and are not 
employed in the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418] .  
No new autopsies will begin once the sample size requirement/trial stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_190725].  However, some subjects may have died and had autopsy material removed at the 
time the sample size requirement is met. Histology analysis will be completed in subjects 
for whom autopsies are ongoing at the time the sample size requirement is met and these subjects will also be included in the Primary Efficacy Population.

Amendment 2 – 18Dec2017  Page [ADDRESS_725660] the potential to aid in the diagnosis of patients with 
cognitive impairment (Dubois  et al.,  2010; McKhann et al. , 2011). PET ligands such as 
florbetapir F 18 (Wong et al., 2010) provide a minimally invasive estimate of cortical 
beta amyloid (Aβ) neuritic plaque deposition, which is a hallmark pathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)  and a required element for the neuropathologic diagnosis of 
AD (Hyman  et al. , 2012). More recently, imaging biomarkers for tau protein, the other 
required pathology for AD, have become available (Chien et al. , 2103; Xia et al., 2013). 
Amyloid is believed to accumulate very early in the AD disease process (Jack et al., 
2010) and may be present in other diseases or as an incidental finding in patients with other dementias  (Siderowf et al., 2014; Serrano et al. , 2014). While amyloid deposition is 
required for the diagnosis of AD, its  density or distribution is not associated with disease 
duration or severity (Nelson et al. , 2012).  
In contrast to Aβ neuritic plaques, the density and distribution of phosphorylated tau, 
aggregated in neurofibrillary tangles, increases with AD -related co gnitive impairment 
and correlates with neurodegeneration (Dickson et al., 1997; Duyckaerts et al., 1987; 
Nelson  et al. , 2012). Thus, a PET imaging agent that binds to phosphorylated tau has 
potential application as a biomarker for disease severity and may be useful for selecting patients for therapy , monitoring disease progression  and assessing response to putative 
disease modify treatments . 
18F-AV-1451 (originally named [F-18]T807 by [CONTACT_176085]) has been developed as a positron emitting radiopharmaceutical for in 
vivo imaging of tau protein aggregates (Xia et al., 2013; Chien et al. 2013). 
Autoradiography results using tissue sections from human brains showed a strong signal 
in the grey matter of cortical slices from tau positive brains but weak or no binding in tau 
negative, Aβ positive, or tau and Aβ  negative tissue.  Scatchard analysis based on this 
heterogeneous autoradiography assay yielded an estimated Kd of 15nM. A saturation binding experiment using purified Pai red Helical Filament (PHF) Tau isolated brains of 
AD patients yielded a Kd value of 0.[ADDRESS_725661] 
common central nervous system (CNS) targets and no clinically relevant inhibition was seen.  AV-1451 was positive in the in vitro hERG assay; however, in vivo cardiovascular 
safety pharmacology assessments in dogs showed no evidence of QT prolongation at doses up to 50x the intended maximum human dose (MHD). Nonetheless, until suffic ient 
human cardiovascular safety data are available, clinical studies will exclude subjects with 
a history of risk factors for Torsades de Pointes and subjects taking drugs known to 
prolong the QT interval. 
In vivo  safety pharmacology studies were also con ducted in rats to determine potential 
effects on the CNS and respi[INVESTIGATOR_27441]. In these studies no clinically relevant effects 
were reported at doses exceeding 100x the intended MHD. Additionally, non- radioactive 
AV-[ADDRESS_725662] levels (NOAELs) were the highest doses tested (150x MHD for single, 50x MHD for repeat).

Potential genotoxicity of non- radioactive AV -1451 was tested in both in vitro  and in vivo 
assays.  In the in vitro  assays, AV -1451 tested positive for potential genotoxicity. 
However, in the in vivo rat micronucleus assay at doses up to 750x MHD (scaled 
allometrically), AV -[ADDRESS_725664] 
systems. In vivo, AV-1451 is cleared rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375]; however, the i n vitro  experiments employ 
static, prolonged exposure of cells to high concentrations of the test article. While the in 
vitro  data show the potential for genotoxicity, the in vivo  data provide assurance that 
genotoxicity is unlikely to occur at clini cally -relevant doses for human diagnostic studies. 
Three human clinical studies have been completed with 18F-AV-1451. A total of [ADDRESS_725665] been reported in clinical studies: diarrhea, headache, and altered taste. All reported events were mild in intensity and all subjects recovered from these events.  
Human dosimetry has been obtained in nine subjects. Generally, the radiotracer 
distribution was consistent among the subjects and showed rapid hepatobiliary clearance.  
There were three organs that received estimated doses higher than 0.05 mSv/MBq. The 
organ that received the largest estimated dose was the upper large intestinal wall (0.0962 
± 0. 0134 mSv/MBq), followed by [CONTACT_176086].  The Effective Dose 
was 0.0241 ± 0.0016 mSv/MBq. This results in an estimated Effective Dose of 8.70 mSv 
for an anticipated 370 MBq (10 mCi) injection and is comparable to the effective dose of 
approved 18F- labeled compoun ds such as fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and florbetapir F 
18 injection.  
Evaluation of the PET images from completed studies demonstrates little focal cortical 
retention of 
18F-AV-1451 in either young cognitively normal ( YCN) or  older cognitively 
normal ( OCN) subjects known to be amyloid negative (florbetapir PET SUVR <1.10; 
Figure  1 Panels A and B). However, OCN subjects frequently demonstrated retention in  
the mesial temporal lobes and some OCN subjects also demonstrated retention in the 
brainstem or striatum ( Figure  1 Panel B).  In MCI and AD subjects, retention appeared to 
spread from mesial temporal lobes to isocortical areas ( Figure  1 Panels C -F). The pattern 
of 18F-AV-1451 distribution seen on PET imaging, across subjects with various levels of 
impairment, paralleled the  pattern reported in the classic autopsy series  of older persons 
and subsequently used to define the Braak stage (Braak  and Braak , 1991).  Two clinically 
diagnosed AD subjects that were found to be amyloid negative on a florbetapir PET scan were the exception to this pattern, as their scans were similar to clinically normal elder controls and showed no cortical 
18F-AV-1451 retention ( Figure  1 Panel G).

PET scans to histopathologic assessment of amyloid burden subjects for whom biopsy 
samples were available or who came to autopsy after receiving a PET amyloid scan.  
These studies support the relationship between PET amyloid imaging results and cortical 
neuritic plaque density (Clark et al.,  2011, 2012; Leinonen et al. , 2008; Sojkova et al. , 
2011; Kantarci et al. , 2011; Burack et al. , 2010). The large r autopsy studies (Clark  et al.,  
2012; Curtis et al. , 2015; Sabri  et al. , 2015) demonstrated a high sensitivity and 
specificity for amyloid  PET to discriminate subjects with subsequent autopsy findings of 
no or sparse neuritic plaques (amyloid negative) from those with mode rate to frequent 
plaques (amyloid positive). 
By [CONTACT_22242], systematic studies correlating imaging data from tau ligands with post-
mortem verification of AD pathology have not been completed. The goal of this protocol 
is to generate evidence to support the r elationship between PET imaging with  18F-AV-
1451 PET imaging and AD neuropathology assessed at autopsy.  
2. TRIAL OBJECTIVES 
2.1. Primary Objective :  
This study is designed to test the relationship between ante -mortem 18F-AV-1451 PET 
imaging and tau neurofibrillary pathology associated with AD, as measured at autopsy. 
To accomplish this goal, two primary analyses will be performed:  
Primary Analysis 1  
The diagnostic performance (sensitivity/specificity ) of 5 independent readers’ 
interpretations  of ante- mortem 18F-AV-1451 PET imaging for detection of a pattern 
of 18F-AV-1451 neocortical uptake that corresponds to NFT Score of B3 (Hyman  et 
al., 2012; Montine et al., 2012) at autopsy will be evaluated; and if success criteria are 
met, 
Primary Analysis 2  
The diagnostic performance (sensitivity/specificity ) of 5 independent readers’ 
interpretations  of ante- mortem 18F-AV-1451 PET imaging for detection of a pattern 
of 18F-AV-1451 neocortical uptake that corresponds to high levels of AD 
neuropathologic change as defined by [CONTACT_45455] -AA criteria (Hyman  et al.,  2012) will be 
evaluated. For individuals with cognitive impairment, high level s of AD 
neuropathologic change are considered adequate to explain cognitive impairment or 
dementia symptoms . 
The trial will be considered successful if both co -primary endpoints are met according to 
the Statistical Analysis Plan .

2.2. Secondary Objective: 
To assess performance of  independent, blinded readers of 18F-AV-1451 PET scans: 
Secondary Analysis 1: To assess diagnostic performance of  ante- mortem 18F-AV-
1451 PET imaging, based on majority interpretation of 5 independent readers , for 
detection of a pattern of 18F-AV-1451 neocortical uptake that corresponds to 
Neurofibrillary Tangle (NFT) Score of B3 and for detection of a pattern of 18F-AV-
1451 neocortical uptake that corresponds to high levels of AD neuropathologic 
change as defined by [CONTACT_349526] - Alzheimer’s Association  (NIA -
AA) criteria . 
Secondary Analysis 2: To assess agreement among readers of 18F-AV-1451 PET

from the front-runners will be analyzed on a patient -by-patient basis  and may be used to 
refine the PET o r autopsy methods  (e.g. pathology staining/quantitation methods ). Upon 
completion of the final front-runner subject analysis , the final imaging and autopsy 
methods will be specified . No additional PET image reads  or autopsy analyses will be 
performed until the PET image read and autopsy methods have been finalized. The primary efficacy analyse s will be performed on those subjects  with valid imaging data 
that come to autopsy after the front -runners (Primary Efficacy Cohort). The front -runners 
will not be  included in the primary efficacy analyses, but additional analys es of combined 
primary  plus front -runner cases  may  be performed . 
The first 30 PET scans collected will be reviewed by [CONTACT_552135]. The DMB will assess whether the scans can be evaluated in  a manner consistent with methods 
developed in Phase II (
18F-AV-1451-A05 Exploratory Phase Cohort ) as determined by 
[CONTACT_552136]. The purpose of establishing these criteria for review by [CONTACT_552137] s cans in the autopsy population do not 
appear significantly different than scans obtained in early phase studies, where subjects 
were not at end -of-life. The DMB will have the ability to recommend unblinding the 
Sponsor to all [ADDRESS_725679] 
anomalies not present in the early phase studies. Study enrollment will continue during the DMB’s review.  In the event the Sponsor proceeds with the DMB recommendation for 
unblinding, the unblinded subjects will be excluded from the Primary Efficacy Cohort 
(neither the scans nor any autopsies will be used in the primary analyse s) or the study 
may be terminated.  If unblinding occurs, it must be completed before the final image read 
and autopsy methods are specified. If clinically significant incidental findings  are 
identified on a PET scan, the DMB will communicate the findings to Avid. This process will be described in the DMB C harter.  
Avid personnel will be blinded to the Primary Efficacy Cohort 
18F-AV-1451 PET i mages . 
A single Avid member will perform periodic quality assurance (QA) by [CONTACT_42574] a 
listing of the PET image header data  (not to exceed 20% unless issues identified that 
warrant additional review ). These QA reviews will serve to ensure quality control 
processes at the imaging core laboratory are adequately performed . Avid staff performing 
the PET  image data header  QA assessment will not be aware of the clinical status for the 
subjects/images being reviewed. The independent blinded reader s and DMB will be 
blinded to the subject clinical status and autopsy results. The pathology core lab (s) will 
be blinded to the subject clinical status , PET scan images, and read results . All other Avid 
personnel will be blinded to the Primary Efficacy C ohort 18F-AV-1451 read results and

5.2. Planned  Dosage and Duration of Treatment  
5.2.1. Dosage and Administration  
All subjects will receive a single IV bolus administration target dose of 370 MBq (10 
mCi) of 18F-AV-1451 Injection. 
5.2.2. Rationale for Dosage  
This trial is designed to evaluate the brain tau protein imaging properties of 18F-AV-1451 
to be used in subjects near end -of-life. 18F-AV-1451 will be administered IV in a 
radioactive target  dose of 370 MBq with a MHD limited to 20  µg of compound by [CONTACT_27225] . 
This dose is 150-fold lower than the NOAEL observed in the rat single dose toxicity 
study and is 50-fold lower than the NOAEL observed in the rat and dog repeat dose toxicity studies.  
Human  dosimetry has been obtained in nine subjects. The results estimated an Effective 
Dose of 8.70 mSv for an anticipated 370 MBq (10 mCi) injection and is comparable to 
the effective dose of approved 
18F-labeled compounds such as FDG and Florbetapir F [ADDRESS_725681] 65% of the subjects enrolled will have dementia or MCI. The study 
sponsor will review enrollment on an ongoing basis to ensure that subjects that represent a broad range of age (including individuals aged  > 80 years ) and cognitive performance 
are enrolled.  A limited number of subjects  with end stage dementia may be enrolled at 
sponsor’s discretion both to ensure appropriate balance across the cognitive spectrum and because these subjects may have difficulty participating in the PET scan.  This review will 
be performed based on clinical data only and the sponsor will remain blinded to  PET scan 
results.

7.The injection site will be observed for excessive inflammation or damage to the
surrounding tissue where the dose was injected; and
8.A physician will see the subject prior to discharge to evaluate the subject’sreadiness for  discharge.
Follow-Up Phone Call: 
A follow-up phone call to the subject, ( or caregiver /informant if applicable ), will be 
conducted within [ADDRESS_725691] information about any new adverse events. If both of these days are not business days, the follow-up phone call can occur the 
following business day. End of study for the purpose of adverse event reporting is 
defined as the completion of the follow-up phone call.  
7.1.3. Death and Autopsy:  
1.The responsible family member or caregiver /informant will be contact[CONTACT_552138] a description of events leading up to
death ;
2. Subjects will not have an autopsy performed or be included in the primary
analyses if death does not occur within nine months of the most recent imaging
session  or if tissue has not been acquired before the r equired number of autopsies
for the study has  been c ompleted .
3. If subject and/or LAR consented, additional research and genetic testing will be
performed on brain tissue.
Detailed autopsy procedures are described in the Technical Autopsy Manual.   
7.1.4. Additional PET Imaging 
If death does not occur within nine months of the 18F-AV-[ADDRESS_725692] 
may b e given the oppor tunity to undergo a second  18F-AV-1451 PET scan and continue 
in the protocol at the sponsor’s discreti on. In order to obtain a second sca n before the 
nine month ex
pi[INVESTIGATOR_5695], it is recommended the second scan be performed any time 
between six and nine months after the first scan. If the  subject a grees t o a second  18F-AV- 
1451 PET scan, s creening assessments will not be repeated. The procedures in Section 
7.1.2 will be performed and updated m edical history /concurrent medications and an 
updated neurological disease diagnosis (according  to bes t av ailable information)  will be  
col
lected. If the subj
ect subsequently comes to autopsy, the second scan (nearest to time 
of death) will be used in the efficacy ana lyses. Because cortical t au de position  is expected 
to occur very slowly, if at all, in cognitively normal (unimpaired) subjects, cognitively 
normal subjects will not be required to undergo repeat scans. Cognitively normal subjects 
will remain e ligible f or autopsy , regardless of  ti me from  first scan or secon d scan to 
autopsy , and will be included in the primary efficacy cohort if the subject comes to 
autopsy any time be fore the tr ial stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_552122] t. Subj ects of other cognit ive 
status  that do not consent to a sec ond 18F-AV-1451 PET scan w ill not be  included in the 
primary analys es unless death occurs within nine months of the initial scan.

Amendment 2 – 18Dec2017  Page [ADDRESS_725701]  will be  performed at  screening  and at the 18F-AV-1451 imaging 
visit(s) prior to injection for females of childbearing potential (defined as pre-
menopausal, less than [ADDRESS_725702]- menopausal or not surgically sterile).  A serum 
pregnancy test may also be obtained prior to injection at the 18F-AV-1451 imaging 
visit(s) if required by [CONTACT_63635].  
Physician Visit 
At screening , a physician or designee must see the subject to evaluate their current 
medical status . 
A physician must see the subject prior to drug administration and prior to discharge from 
the 18F-AV-1451 imaging session . At this time, the physician should review all safety 
data and briefly examine/query the subject regarding potential adverse events or other treatment issues.  
Brain Autopsy 
For those subjects who come to autopsy, brain harvesting will be performed locally by 
[CONTACT_552140] a 
pathology core lab(s) for neuropathological examination according to the 
Neuropathology Analysis Plan , which will be written prior to the first subject 
neuropathology analysis  in this study . Autopsies will not be performed on subjects that 
live longer than nine months after the 18F-AV-[ADDRESS_725703] was previously enrolled. 
Autopsy reports will be sent to the principal investigators to share with the subjects’ families after the study has been completed . 
7.3. Protocol  for Image Collection  
The designated imaging core lab  will prepare and distribute a PET Technical Operations 
Manual for 18F-AV-1451. Histo rical brain MRI transmission procedures will be outlined

AV-[ADDRESS_725704]- Mortem Assessment of Tau Pathology” 
Amendment 2 – 18Dec2017  Page 32 of 50 
2. Informed Consent: Study procedures will not be initiated until the subject and/or
their legally authorized representative (as appropriate) signs the informed consent
form;
3.Recording and monitoring of adverse events as outlined in Section 7.7.3  including
the notification  of study s ite clinic al investigators, local IRBs a nd the FDA
re
garding serious adverse event;
4. Avid RP’s
 obligation to monitor the participating center on a regular basis; and
5. The termination of a center or the trial if conditions apply, as outlined in Section
5.6. 
7.5. Informed Consent and Subject Information  
Potential subjects, or their LAR  (as appropriate),  will be allowed to read a written 
informed consent form. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_552125], risks, and alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The subject and LAR will have an 
opportunity to have all questions answered by a physician. The subject will then sign and 
date the informed consent form, indicating willingness to participate in the study  and 
brain donation. 
End-of-life, as well as, AD s ubjects are potentially a vulnerable population with 
compromised mental capacity. Investigators should take extra care to evaluate a subject ’s 
ability to give consen t. If the subject is capable of giving informed consent then the 
subject should sign on the consent line of the informed consent form. If the subject is not 
capable of giving consent, consent may be given by a LAR, consistent with the 
requirements of the State where the subject resides and local IRB guidance. Subjects with the capacity to understand that they are engaging in a research study should affirm that 
they do not object to participating. Subjects lacking the capacity to assent and/or dissent 
will n ot be precluded from participation.  
All informed consent forms must be approved by [CONTACT_176096], and by [CONTACT_3809]. No study-related procedures shall be performed prior to completion of 
the informed consent process, and signing of the consent form.  A copy of the signed 
informed consent should be given to the subject and/or their legally authorized 
representative for their records.  
7.6. Documentation  
18F-AV-1451 PET scans, as well as historical MRI scans,  will be saved in an appropriate 
electronic format as specified in the imaging  manual s. A copy  of all scans will be saved 
at the site/imaging center  and a copy  of each  will be forward ed to the designated imaging 
core lab as described in the i maging manual s. All other data requ ired by [CONTACT_552141].  All data in the eCRF will be substantiated by “source 
documents,” which consist of the subject’s medical files, etc. All source  documentation 
must be made available to Avid and designees. Completed source documents and e CRFs 
may need to be made available and complete for an inspection by [CONTACT_1622] , other 
international regulatory authorities , or Avid at any time. A ballpoint pen should be used

accordance with applicable laws and regulations (see Section 10.6). 
7.7. Adverse Events (AE)  
Avid’s standards for recording and reporting adverse events (AEs) are to be followed 
regardless of applicable regulatory requirements that may be less stringent.  All AEs must 
be fully recorded on the Adverse Event Page of the eCRF. Investigators will be instructed to report to Avid or its designee their assessment of the potential relatedness of each AE to investigational product or protocol procedure vi a electronic data entry.  If a subject ’s 
treatment is discontinued as a result of an AE, study site personnel must clearly report to Avid or its designee via electronic data entry the circumstances and data leading to any such discontinuation of treatment. In cases where the investigator notices an 
unanticipated benefit to the subject , study site personnel should report “unexpected 
benefit” with the actual even t term to Avid or its designee (for example, the complete 
actual term would be “unexpected benefit - sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_176073]”).  
Signs and symptoms of each AE should be described in detail (e.g., start and stop 
dates /time, severity/intensity, relationship to investigational product, action taken, and 
outcome). Additionally, any clinically significant findings from vital sign measurements  
or other study procedures including those that result in a diagnosis should be reported as an AE to Avid or its designee.  
7.7.1. Adverse Event Monitoring  
Each subject  must be carefully monitored for adverse events. An assessment must be 
made of the severity/intensity and  relationship to the administration of the investigational 
product. 7.7.2. Adverse Event Definitions  
Adverse Events  
For reporting purposes, Avid will distinguish among pre-existing conditions, treatment -
emergent adverse events and trial- emergent adverse events.  Pre-existing conditions (i.e., 
undesirable experiences, signs or symptoms that begin prior to the Screening Visit) will 
be recorded on the medical history and/or physical exam eCRF pages.  Signs and 
symptoms that are believed to be due to the pre- existing c ondition (started prior to dose 
of investigational product) do not have to be recorded in the AEs section of the eCRF, 
unless there is an increas e in frequency or severity . Additionally, signs or symptoms or 
changes in pre- existing  conditions that occur outside the trial- defined adverse event 
reporting will be recorded in medical history.  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related . For the purposes of this study, untoward 
medical occurrences  will be considered associated with the use of 18F-AV-1451, and thus 
be reported as  treatment- emergent  adverse events, if they occur within 48 hour s after 18F-
AV-1451 administration.

consents to a second 18F-AV-1451 PET scan, trial -emergent adverse events will be 
collected in a similar  period, from either date of additional consent (if applicable) or the 
date the dose request for the second scan  is submitted to Avid , up to the second 
administration of 18F-AV-1451. 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
An SAE is an AE that results in one of the following outcomes or constitutes one of the following events: 
• Death;  
• Initial or prolonged inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (other than that required by 
[CONTACT_990]; “social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” or any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33566]- medical 
reasons does not constitute an SAE); 
• A life -threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying);  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• Congenital anomaly /birth defect;  
• Considered significant by [CONTACT_81121]. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_122949], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject  and may require medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Unexpected Adverse Event 
An unexpected adverse event is an adverse event not previously reported or an adverse 
event that occurs with specificity, severity or frequency that is not consistent with the 
current investigator’s brochure. 
Relationship to Investigational Product 
Investigators will be instructed to report their assessment of the potential re latedness of 
each adverse event to protocol procedure and /or investigational product. The assessment 
of the relationship of an adverse event to the administration of the investigational product 
is a clinical decision based on all available information at the time of the completion of 
the eCRF.  
Intensi ty/Severity of an Adverse Event  
LY3191748

AV-[ADDRESS_725709]- Mortem Assessment of Tau Pathology” 
 
Amendment 2 – 18Dec2017  Page [ADDRESS_725710] to adverse events, an assessment is required of the intensity (severity) of the event.  
The following classifications should be used: 
Mild:  
A mild adverse event is an adverse event, usually transient in nature and generally not 
interfering with normal activities.  
 
Moderate : 
A moderate adverse event is an adverse event that is sufficiently discomforting to 
interfere with normal activities.  
Severe:  
A severe adverse event is an adverse event that incapacitates the subject and prevents 
normal activities. Note that a severe event is not necessarily a serious event. Nor must a serious event necessarily be severe.  
7.7.3. Adverse Event Documentation  
All adverse events must be fully recorded on the Adverse Event Page via the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system. Documentation must be supported by [CONTACT_176102]. AEs considered by [CONTACT_552142]. Signs and symptoms of each AE should be described in detail (e.g., start and stop dates, severity/intensity, relationship to investigational product, actio n taken, and outcome). 
Adverse events fulfilling the definition of a serious adverse event should, in addition, be reported on the Serious Adverse Event Reporting Form. 
7.7.4. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Study site personnel must alert Eli Lilly or its d esignee of any SAE within [ADDRESS_725711], regardless 
of the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_25289]. Therefore, SAEs that occur later than [ADDRESS_725712]  experiences an SAE after signing informed consent (s), but prior to receiving 
investigational product, the event will be reported  on the e CRF  and to Eli Lilly or its 
designee.  Previously planned (prior to signing the ICF) surgeries should not be reported

8. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS   
8.1. General Statistical Considerations  
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® version 8.2 or higher. The specific analyses to address the objectives will be described in the Statistical Analysis Pla n (SAP) . 
 
8.2. Populations for Analysis  
Invalid Data  
Subject specimens for which technical errors result in invalid or uninterpretable autopsy specimens (e.g. lost tissue, tissue processed improperly by [CONTACT_552143]), as determined by [CONTACT_552144](s), in 
accordance with criteria set in the Technical Autopsy Manual and Neuropathology 
Analysis Plan will be excluded from primary analyse s.  
Subjects with invalid or unevaluable PET data will be excluded from analyses. Criteria for declaring an image invalid or not evaluable will be specified in advance in the Image 
Review Charter.  If an image is considered invalid by [CONTACT_552145] , the 
subject will not be follo wed to autopsy. Valid images will be considered un evaluable 
only if [ADDRESS_725714] the relationship between ante -mortem 
18F-AV-1451 PET 
imaging and tau neurofibrillary pathology associated with AD, as measured at autopsy. 
To accomplish this goal, two primary analyses will be performed:  
Primary An alysis 1  
The diagnostic performance (sensitivity/specificity ) of 5 independent readers’ 
interpretations  of ante- mortem 18F-AV-1451 PET imaging for detection of a pattern 
of 18F-AV-1451 neocortical uptake that corresponds to NFT Score of B3 (Hyman et 
al., 2012; Montine et al., 2012) at autopsy will be evaluated ; and if success criteria are 
met, 
Primary Analysis 2 
The diagnostic performance (sensitivity/specificity ) of 5 independent readers’

neuropa thologic change are considered adequate to explain cognitive impairment or 
dementia symptoms . 
The trial will be considered successful if both co-primary endpoints are met according to 
the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
For Primary Analysis 1, the hypothesis to be tested is that for the same 3 out of 5 
independent readers, the lower bound of the two-sided 95% CI for both sensitivity and 
the specificity of 18F-AV-1451 PET reading results will be ≥ 50%. As detailed in S ection 
8.5 Table 7, NFT scores for autopsy cases will be categorized  as either B0/B1 /B2 o r B3 
level and  will serve as the NFT S core T S for this analysis. 18F-AV-1451 PET imaging 
will be  classified a s either ne ocortical uptake  not consistent with AD (AD-) or neocortical 
uptake consistent with AD (AD+) a nd consistent with AD and likely to progress (AD++) 
by [CONTACT_233963] r eader. S ensitivity and spe cificity w ill be  calc ulated for each r eader as the  
proportions of TP and TN cases correctly i dentified as s uch, according t o T able 5 below:

8.2.2. Secondary Objective Analys es 
Secondary Analysis 1 :  To a ssess diagnostic performance of ante- mortem 18F-AV-1451 
PET imaging, based on majority interpretation of 5 independent readers, for detection of 
a pattern of 18F-AV-1451 neocortical uptake that corresponds to Neurofibrillary Tang le 
(NFT) Score of B3 and for detection of a pattern of 18F-AV-1451 neocortical uptake that 
corresponds to high levels of AD neuropathologic change as defined by [CONTACT_349526] - Alzheimer’s Association (NIA -AA) criteria : 
Majority scan interpretation will be derived using individual readers’ scan interpretation 
results. Diagnostic performance of this majority scan interpretation  will be assessed 
relative to the Autopsy NFT score  TS as per Primary A nalysis 1 and again relative to the 
NIA-AA Autopsy Diagnosis TS  as per Primary A nalysis 2. In each case (image) , a 
majority reading result will be derived using each individual reader’s scan interpretations 
results.  Sensitivity and specificity, and two -sided 95% CI thereof, will be calculated for 
the majority interpretation results  relative to the appropriate TS . The hypotheses to be 
tested are:  
1a: the majority reading result will have the  lower bounds of two -sided  95% CI ≥ 
55% for both sensitivity and specificity for detection of tau neurofibrillary pathology that corresponds to NFT Score of B3, and  
1b: the majority reading results will have the lower bounds of two -sided 95% CI ≥ 
55% for both sensitivity and specificity for detection of a pattern of

Secondary Analysis 2: Assess agreement among readers of 18F-AV-1451 PET scans: 
Fleiss’ Kappa statistics will be used to assess inter -reader agreement for the diagnostic 
decisions assoc iated with Primary Analyses [ADDRESS_725718] is the observed kappa values are ≥ 0.64 and the lower bound of the two-
sided CIs  for this assessment are ≥ 0.55.  
8.3. Safety Analysis 
Safety vital signs measurements will be summarized by  [CONTACT_552146]. Change from baseline ( pre-dose time point) values will be determined and 
summarized .  
Adverse events including injection site reactions will be summarized in terms of number and percentage of subjects experiencing an AE. The summary will be further broken 
down by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term using Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms. Adverse events will also be presented by 
[CONTACT_926], relationship to treatment and seriousness. All subjects who experience SAEs or who discontinue due to AEs will be summarized . 
Discontinuation  
All subjects who discontinued participation prior to completing the study will be listed and their discontinuation reasons will be tabulated. 
Vital Signs  
Changes in vital signs from baseline will be summarized.  
8.4. 18F-AV-1451 Image Analysis  
18F-AV-1451 retention on PET images from subjects with valid autopsy data will be 
interpreted by [CONTACT_552130]   
• Neocortical Uptake Not Consistent with an AD Pattern ( AD-: no increased 
neocortical activity in any region or increased activity is isolated to the mesial 
temporal, anterolateral temporal or frontal region(s); 
• Neocortical Uptake Consistent with an AD P attern ( AD+: increased neocortical tracer 
activity in the posterolateral temporal (PLT), parietal (including precuneus), or 
occipi[INVESTIGATOR_17717](s)); or  
• Neocortical Uptake Consistent with an AD P attern and with Likelihood of Disease 
Progression (AD++ , which is a subset of AD+ ( Neocortical uptake consistent with an 
AD pattern ) where increased tracer activity is found in the parietal (including 
precuneus) region(s) regardless of uptake elsewhere, or in the frontal region in 
addition to PLT, occipi[INVESTIGATOR_307], or parietal region(s) ).

For the purpose of testing the primary analys es, a scan interpretation will be considered 
positive (hypothesized to correspond to a B3 neuropathology score in Primary Analysis 1 
and  an NIA-AA score of high AD pathology in Primary Analysis 2) if the scan is interpreted as at least consistent with an AD pattern ( AD+ or AD++).  
Details of the visual PET image review methods will be provided in the Blinded Read Manual.  
Images will also be assessed quantitatively (semi- automated computerized measurement 
of SUVRs)  for exploratory analysis purposes . Details of the analysis  methods will be 
provided in the Quantitative Methodology Document.  
The 
18F-AV-1451 PET imaging results will not be shared with the investigator sites  or 
subjects and their families prior to the end of the study. 
8.5. Neuropathology Analysis 
All neuropathological measurements on brain tissue in this trial will be evaluated in a 
standardized and blinded (with respect to PET image results and subject 
identifying/clinical information) fashion in a qualified laboratory. A Technical Autopsy 
Manual and Neuropathology Analysis Plan will be developed for this study containing all 
methods and measurement procedures. Neuropathological assessment will be derived 
from the NIA -AA guidelines (Hyman  et al. , 2012; Montine et al., 2012).  Sections from 
brain reg ions recommended for pathological assessment of AD, as well as additional, pre-
specified neocortical regions will be sampled. Staining will follow the procedures recommended in the NIA- AA practical approach  guidelines . NFT extent will be assessed 
using standard procedures and NFT scores (B0- B3) will be recorded ( Hyman et al., 2012; 
Montine et al., 2012).  The TS for Primary Analysis 1 will be constructed from NFT 
scores as shown in Table  7.

Amyloid pathology will be evaluated using Thal and CERAD rating systems. 
Distrib ution of amyloid (Thal plaque score A0 -A3; Montine et al., 2012) will be 
recorded. The frequency of neuritic amyloid plaques will be evaluated semi -
quantitatively (CERAD score: none, sparse, moderate or frequent). Potential alternative neuropathologies contributing to cognitive impairment will also be considered as 
recommended by [CONTACT_552147]., 2012, and l evel of AD neuropathologic change will be 
recorded as none, low, intermediate or high per NIA- AA guidelines  (Hyman et al., 2012;

sponsor is blinded to the pathology results (truth standard) until after the study is 
completed and the database is locked.  Therefore, in order to ensure that an adequate number of subjects are recruited and come to autopsy for each truth standard group, the 
sponsor will assume that subjects diagnosed on clinical grounds as having dementia due 
to AD will be truth standard positive, subjects diagnosed as having no cognitive 
impairment (cognitively normal) will be truth standard negativ e.  Based on these 
assumptions, the study sample size requirement and trial stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_552118]

9. USE OF DATA AND PUBL ICATION
Avid adheres to the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA ) 
Principles on Conduct of Clinical Trials and Communicat ion of Clinical Trial Results. A 
complete copy of these principles is available from Avid and can also be found at the 
PhRMA website (http://www.phrma.org). Our policy is briefly summarized below: 
•We commit to timely communication of meaningful results of controlledclinical trials, regardless of outcome.
•As a sponsor, we may recommend that the Investigator(s) delay or declinepublication in cases where the study design , conduct, or data are insufficient
to allow meaningful interpretation. Avid and the Investigator(s) will discuss
the study design and data in advance of the study, and again after completion,
and will strive, through appropriate scientific debate, to reach a consensusregarding the potential merits of publication.
•Avid retains the right to review any manuscripts, presentations, or abstracts
before they are submitted for publication. Where differences of opi[INVESTIGATOR_552127], the parties (Avid
and the Investigator) should try to resolve them through appropriate scientific
debate. Avid retains the right to delay publication for up to [ADDRESS_725725]
intellectual property.
•Anyone who provides substantial contributions should receive appropriate
recognition as an author or contributor when the manuscript is published.
This is a multi-c enter study. The primary analyses will include data from all centers. A 
multicenter publicatio n, reporting the primary analyse s data set, with authorship from all 
contributing centers, should precede any other publications.

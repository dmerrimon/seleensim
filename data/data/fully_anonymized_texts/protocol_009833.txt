Wash -out period (from day -8 to baseline ): 8 (+2) days with 
no further treatment except commercially available 
preservative free artificial tears if strictly needed , provided by 
[CONTACT_1034] . The use of artificial tears will be tracked in the 
patient’s diary.  
Treatment: eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 and 
treated for 4 weeks with either cenegermin  ophthalmic 
solution  20 mcg/mL  or vehicle.  
Only the experimental IMP is allowed  during the treatment 
period however , if strictly needed, the patient may use 
commercially available preservative free artificial tears 
provided by [CONTACT_1034]. The use of artificial tears will be 
tracked in the patient’s diary.  
Follow up:  Initially  8 weeks  (from week 5 to week 12)  post 
treatment with no further topi[INVESTIGATOR_317804]- free artificial tears 
provided by [CONTACT_317861].  
Furthermore, the patient can administer additional artificial 
tear eye drops p rovided by [CONTACT_317862],  
and must document in the patient’s diary the number of 
additional drops administered for each eye.  
Patients will then be followed up for efficacy and safety 
endpoints until week 16 and for safety endpoint s until week 
24.

Statistical Methods  The sample size of the study is calculated based on results 
from previous studies. Expecting a difference of 30% in 
Schirmer I rate of responders (defined as patients reaching a 
value >10mm/5min) at Week 4 and 15 points in Global 
SANDE score improvement at  Week 12, a total sample size of 
90 evaluable patients (100 pts considering 10% drop- out rate) 
allows to achieve an overall power of 90% to show superiority 
of cenegermin  ophthalmic solution vs vehicle in terms of both 
co-primary endpoints, considering a one- sided alpha of 0.025.  
Summary statistics are defined for quantitative variables 
(number of observations, mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum and maximum) and qualitative variables (number 
and percentage per category). If appropriate, confidence 
intervals around the mean or the proportions will be presented.  
The proportion of patients reaching a value of Schirmer I test 
(without anesthesia) >10mm/5min at week [ADDRESS_391222] -baseline visits.  
 will be d escriptively summarized at 
each available time point. Any statistical testing will be 
descriptive in nature. Correlation between sign and symptom 
scores will be assessed.  
AEs will be coded by [CONTACT_1196] (SOC) and 
Preferred Term (PT), using the Med ical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Individual AEs will be 
listed in patient data listings. TEAEs will be presented in terms 
of the number of AEs and incidence by [CONTACT_3148], seriousness,

relationship to treatment , severity , and study period  (treatment 
or follow-up).  
The Safety (SAF) and the Full Analysis Set (FAS) population 
will consist of all patients who will be randomized and 
received at least one dose of the investigational product. Safety 
population will be analyzed according to the a ctual treatment 
received; Full Analysis Set population will be analyzed 
according to ITT principle, i.e. by [CONTACT_155150]. The 
Per Protocol (PP) population will consist of all patients in the 
FAS population who do not have Major Protocol Deviations.  
Primary and secondary efficacy analyses will be conducted on 
the FAS population while SAF and PP populations will be 
used for safety and sensitivity analyses, respectively.  
The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be issued before 
database lock with more technical and detailed elaboration of 
the principal features of statistical analyses. Any deviation 
from the original statistical plan will be described in the 
Clinical Study Report.

2.1. BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
2.1.1.  Nerve Growth Factor - Overview  
 
Nerve growth factor (NGF) is a polypeptide essential for the survival and growth of sympathetic and sensory 
neurons, and for differentiation of neurons in the central nervous system. It binds with at least two classes of 
receptors: high- affinity tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA), a t ransmembrane tyrosine kinase, and low -
affinity NGF receptor (LNGFR), also known as p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR).  NGF and TrkA are expressed in the anterior segment of the eye (iris, ciliary body, lens, cornea and conjunctiva), and NGF is released in the aqueous humor. Several pi[INVESTIGATOR_317806], playing a crucial role in the physiopathology of several anterior ocular segment diseases.

2.1.2.  Chemical And Formulation Data  
 
As recombinant human NGF (rhNGF) production in mammalian cells does not achieve adequate yields, a 
manufacturing process based on the use of recombinant Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) has been developed. 
However, because the biological activity of NGF relies on  the formation of three disulfide bonds, and because 
disulfide bonds cannot occur in the reducing cytosol, the purification and renaturation of NGF produced in E. coli is problematic. Based on the knowledge that the prosequence increases the yield and rate  of refolding of 
NGF, we have developed a manufacturing process starting from proNGF. After expression of proNGF in E. 
coli, the insoluble protein is isolated in the form of insoluble inactive aggregates (inclusion bodies), solubilized 
in a strong denaturi ng agent and subsequently converted into the natural conformation, which is determined 
by [CONTACT_317863]. Biologically active rhNGF is finally obtained by [CONTACT_317864]. The deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence of human proNGF 
has been optimized for E coli expression (codon adjustment) and two changes in the furin cleavage site, R101V 
and K103A, have been introduced. These two changes are important to ensure a homogeneous rhNGF preparat ion during the process with the mature protein starting with serine 105.  
Oxervate
® ophthalm ic solution contains cenegermin , a recombinant form of human nerve growth factor 
produced in Escherichia coli.  
2.1.3.  Rationale  for cenegermin (rhNGF)  therapy in patients with dry eye  
 Dry eye is a chronic condition of the ocular surface with severe symptoms and visual impairment, leading to 
worse efficiency to perform duties for an average of 184 work days and resulting in an average loss of 
productivity estimated in 5,000USD per year per patient
1.  
Dry eye results from systemic dis eases (Sjögren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus 
erythematosus, Stevens -Johnson syndrome, thyroid disease), ocular conditions ( meibomian gland dysfunction, 
blepharitis, ocular rosacea, corneal dystrophies), elective surgeries (refractive sur gery, blepharoplasty), eyelid 
conditions (lagophthalmos, entropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]/ectropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]), cranial surgeries, side effects of drugs (antihistamines, diuretics, beta -blockers), ocular injuries and burns, chemotherapy and radiation, aging, menopause

Dry eye pathoge nesis is multifactorial however, a number of common mechanisms can be identified: (i) 
chronic inflammation of the conjunctiva; (ii) decrease of ocular surface sensitivity; (iii) impairment of quantity 
of tears and/or quality of the tear film, including tear film hyperosmolarity; (iv) changes of conjunctival 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_317807]; (v) corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_58158]2. 
Until now, treatment has been limited to the use of artificial tears to temporarily improve lubrication of the 
ocular surface, immunomodulation  to increase tear production and  decrease inflammation (Cyclosporine, 
Lifitegrast), or the use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_317808] . However, chronic use 
of steroids is associated with sever al complications such as cataract development and increasing  intraocular 
pressure2. Cyclosporine is topi[INVESTIGATOR_317809]. Lifitegrast ophthalmic solution is a lymphocyte function -associated antigen -1 (LFA -1) antagonist

Version No. 6.0  – Final 26/JAN/[ADDRESS_391224] all the pathogenic mechanisms of dry eye, potentially restoring 
ocular surface homeostasis3. Human corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130], keratocytes, and endothelium  produce NGF, and 
express its high affinity tyrosine kinase receptor A (TrkA), and experimental studies demonstrated that the 
activation of TrkA receptors by [CONTACT_317865] a key role in corneal sensory nerve survival4. 
Indeed, several studies have shown that NGF is involved in the regulation of tear film  production. In fact, 
NGF, TrkA and p75, as well as other neurotrophins (NTs) and related receptors, are expressed by [CONTACT_317866]; moreover, NGF has been quantified in human tears, indicating that NGF is basally 
released by [CONTACT_317867] g land5–7. These data suggest that NGF may play a role in the maintenance of the tear 
film and in its alterations in drying ocular surface diseases. Specifically, considering that NGF potentially 
affects all the components of the ocular surface (cornea, conjunctiva, lacrimal gland, and sensory innervation), it might play an important role during dry eye disease. In line with this hypothesis:  NGF topi[INVESTIGATOR_317810] a dog experimental model of dry eye  has been  shown to increase tear production, conjunctival goblet cell 
density and corneal transparency
2,8; an increased tear concentration of NGF has been reported in patients 
affected by [CONTACT_317868]9,10; NGF stimulates glycoconjugate secretion by [CONTACT_58198], 
without affecting cell proliferation11. 
In several systemic autoimmune conditions, including Sjogren syndrome, the lacrimal gland can be attacked 
by [CONTACT_317869] (ADDE)12. In fact, the 
leading cause of ADDE in dogs is immune -mediated lacrimal gland dysfunction comparable to Sjogren 
syndrome in humans13. In addition, NGF was found to increase secretory mucin MUC5AC secretion by 
[CONTACT_58198], without affecting cell proliferation11. The major secretory gel forming mucin 
MUC5AC plays a crucial role in the maintenance of a wet -surfaced  ocular surface phenotype, in the clearance 
of debris from the ocular surface epi[INVESTIGATOR_24603] (including pathogens and allergens), and in the stability of the tear 
film, contributing to preventing its premature evaporation14,15. The underlying tear film dysfunction discussed 
thus far encompasses alterations in one, or all, of its layers (i.e. the aqueous, mucin, and lipid layer). Tear 
production is controlled by [CONTACT_317870] (LFU) consisting of the cornea, conjunctiva, lacrimal 
glands, meibomian glands, and the neuronal network that connects them14. When corneal nerves are stimulated, 
afferent signals are triggered through the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve (V). In turn, efferent secretomotor nerve endings stimul ate lacrimal glands, meibomian glands and conjunctival goblet cells to 
secrete aqueous, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_317811], respectively
14–16. Likewise, when corneal sensory 
nerves are stimulated, they release neuromediators that provide trophic support for the corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_317812]. These corneal epi[INVESTIGATOR_317813], neurotrophins and growth 
factors (e.g. NGF ) that influence survival, differentiation, and maturation of nerve fibers
17. Thus, neurosensory 
abnormalities play a key etiological role in DE that remains largely unaddressed by [CONTACT_317871].  
Specifically, considering that NGF potentially affects all the components of the ocular surface (cornea, 
conjunctiva and goblet cells, lacrimal gland, and sensory innervation), it may play an important role in 
Sjogren’s DE disease. In addition, considering the mechanism of action of NGF on improving ocular surface 
sensory nerve function, which will induce in turn an improvement in reflex tear secretion and blink rate, it is expected that the effects on both signs and symptoms of DE may be long-lasting.

Version No. 6.0  – Final 26/JAN/[ADDRESS_391225] populations.  
In the completed Phase I study in healthy volunteers ( ), a total of 58 subjects (out of 74 
enrolled) were treated with  single and multiple dose s of different concentrations of cenegermin  ophthalmic 
solution  showing a good safety profile .  
Furthermore, a Phase I/II multicenter, double -masked, vehicle -controlled study evaluating  the safety and 
efficacy of cenegermin  at 10 and 20 mcg/mL  six times a day in 174 patients with stage 2 and 3 of Neuro trophic 
Keratitis  (study ) was completed in 2015; the study  demonstrat ed that cenegermin  was 
very well tolerated and effective in patients with NK. A successful confirmatory study ( ) was  
completed in 2016 and marketing authorization for cenegermin  20 mcg/mL  ophthalmic solution  was granted 
by [CONTACT_317872] 2017 for treatment of moderat e to severe NK.  While in the US cenegermin was approved 
by [CONTACT_13229] 2018 for all stages of Neurotrophic Keratitis. Cenegermin is distributed under the trade name 
[CONTACT_317923]® 20 mcg/mL  ophthalmic solution. 
In addition to NK, cenegermin  ophthalmic solution has been evaluated in a Phase I/II study in retinitis 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_1802] (RP) patients at  60 and 180 mcg/mL  dosages ) , and in a phase I/II study in glaucoma 
at a dose of 60  mcg/mL  ) . An open label , uncontrolled study showed that 4 weeks treatment with 
cenegermin  ophthalmic solution at 20 mcg/mL  and 4 mcg/mL  concentrations was safe and effective in 
improving symptoms, corneal staining and tear production in patients with  dry eye  disease ). These 
results prompted  two additional phase II RCTs in patients with dry eye disease ( ) and in those  with 
ocular discomfort symptoms following refractive surgery ) ; these also  confirmed the favourable 
tolerability profile of cenegermin  ophtha lmic solution  at a concentration of 20 mcg/mL  when used up to 6 
times daily for 8 weeks.   
In the double -masked vehicle- controlled Phase II study  no major differences were observed in  
efficacy when comparing the two  administration  regimens (6 vs. 2 times/day) and treatment durations (8 weeks 
vs. 4 weeks) in a subset of patients with similar characteristics (hyposecretive dry eye with Schirmer test <10mm/5min).   
 An additional phase II study ( ) was specifically designed to fu rther prove this hypothesis. It was a 4 
week, Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double -masked, vehicle -controlled, parallel group study with 12 
weeks of follow -up to evaluate safety and efficacy of cenegermin  ophthalmic solution versus vehicle, in 
patients with moderate to severe dry eye, started in 2018 in patients with hyposecretive dry eye (with or without 
an evaporative component caused by [CONTACT_317873]), including patients diagnosed with primary Sjogren syndrome. 
In this phase II  trial a total of 261 patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive either cenegermin TID (i.e. 3 
times/day), or cenegermin BID (i.e. 2 times/day), or vehicle.  The primary endpoint of the study was the change from baseline in Schirmer I test (without anaesthesia), while 
key secondary endpoints included change from baseline in SANDE scores for severity and frequency, cornea and conjunctiva vital staining, TFBUT and quality of life.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_317814] p<0.025 was not 
reached in the over all population, the study has clearly shown a superior efficacy of both cenegermin  arms 
versus placebo, especially considering that due to the Covid- 19 emergency recruitment was interrupted when 
only 261 (the minimum number required) out of the [ADDRESS_391226] scores at the end of

treatment , as pre- specified in the statistical analysis plan (SAP), the difference between both cenege rmin  dose 
regimens vs. placebo was statistical ly significant for both study groups (p=0.028 for cenegermin  TID and 
p=0.007 for cenegermin  BID [P -value versus Vehicle TID based on Fisher’s exact test]).  It is notewhorty that, 
while no clear dose ranging eff ect was observed on the tear function endpoints,  symptoms recorded by [CONTACT_317874]-specific and validated SANDE questionnaire showed a significant persistence of the beneficial effect of 
the higher dose -regimen (TID) over time and up to the full [ADDRESS_391227] 
result at week 12 (p=0.[ADDRESS_391228]; missing data imputed by [CONTACT_317875]).  In addition, no difference was 
observed in the safety and tolerability profile of the experimental treatment. Specifically, up to [ADDRESS_391229] s that  
cenegermin  may be a safe and effective treatment option for patients with hyposecretive /aqueous tear -deficient  
dry eye  disease. In all studies rhNGF  was well tolerated and the reported ocular AEs were generally transient 
and mostly mild and moderate in intensity during the controlled treatment period and the follow -up period. 
 
In the Phase I, randomized, double-masked, p lacebo -controlled s tudy to e valuate the safety, t olerability and 
pharmacokinetics of rhNGF eye drops in healthy volunteers of Japanese ethnicity ( ), a total of 
30 subjects were enrolled. Twenty  subjects were treated with a single dose of cenegermin  ophthalmic solution  
at a 20 mcg/mL  concentration and a total of 10 subjects were treated with vehicle . On day 1 patients received 
only one dose of cenegermin , then the remainde r of the  trial they received one drop si x times a day. Both the 
single and multiple doses of cenegermin  delivered topi[INVESTIGATOR_317815]. No clinically important changes in ECG were observed after dosing with cenegermin . There was no apparent relationship between treatment and plasma cenegermin  levels, and 
this study did not give any indication for an immunogenic potential of cenegermin in humans after ophthalmic 
treatment.  
2.3. STUDY RATIONALE  
The data reported above, together with the evidence of cenegermin  ophthalmic solution  effectiveness in the 
treatment of patients affected by [CONTACT_317876][INVESTIGATOR_317816] , and moderate to severe dry eye make 
cenegermin  a strong candidate for the tr eatment of severe Sjogren’s dry eye disease
4,10,18. 
As part of the development  plan, the present study was designed in  order to evaluate  the safety and efficacy of 
Oxervate® (cenegermin ophthalmic solution, rhNGF ) versus vehicle in patients with severe Sjogren’s dry eye 
disease. For additional information regarding the development of rhNGF, please consult the current IB.

2.3.1.  Risk assessment/benefit evaluation 
This study is considered a low- risk interventional tria l. It is conducted with a previously tested dose of 
medicinal product already  authorized and commercialized for the treatment of  NK in Europe, US and China.  
The proposed study is conducted in patients with severe Sjogren’s dry eye disease, an indication for which 
Oxervate® (cenegermin) ophthalmic solution is not yet approved , however  two preliminary clinical studies 
were already  conducted in patients with dry eye demonstrating that cenegermin  is well tolerated  in this 
condition. 
The risk of this study is  comparable to the risk of the standard of care, in fact the dose proposed in this protocol 
is cenegermin  20 mcg/mL  three drops per day  instilled in each eye , which is well below the dose approved for 
the treatment of  NK ( cenegermi n 20 mcg/mL  six drops/eye per day).  
Considering what is discussed above , no particular safety risks are foreseen with respect to the safety profile 
of the marketed product Oxervate® (cenegermin  20 mcg/mL  ophthalmic solution).  
 
The patients with severe Sjogren’s dry eye disease participating in this study may potentially benefit from the 
application of cenegermin  for 28 days (4 weeks) .  
 
 
Any possible risk derived from the administration of cenegermin in the specific population involved in this 
study will be minimized by [CONTACT_317877], Ocular examination, 
laboratory tests . 
2.3.2.  Description of the Inve stigational Product 
 The investigational medicinal product (IMP) consists of a sterile isotonic solution for ophthalmic 
administration, containing cenegermin  20 mcg/mL  as drug substance.  
The matching placebo vehicle consists of a sterile isotonic solution. 
Further information is  given in section  5.

3. OVERALL STUDY DESIGN AND INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The study objective is to assess the efficacy and safety of cenegermin (rhNGF)  ophthalmic solution  at 20 
mcg/mL  concentration  administered three times daily for 4 weeks in patients with severe Sjogren’s dry eye 
disease.  
3.2. STUDY ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE  
This study will be performed at approximately 10 study centers located in the [LOCATION_003] and Europe .  At each study 
center, the Principal Investigator (PI) will be responsible for ensuring that the investigation is conducted 
according to the signed Investigator agreement, the protocol, GCP guidelines, and local regulations.  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_243861], which will consist of 
maintaining the study file and the patient records, corresponding with the IRB, and completing the case report forms (eCRFs) and reporting SAEs within 24 hours of initial awareness.  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_317817]. If the investigator/institution retains the services of any individual or party to perform trial- related duties and 
functions, the investigator/institution should ensure this individual or party is qualified to perform those trial -
related duties and functions and should implement procedures to ensure the integrity of the trial -related duties 
and functions performed and any data generated. 
3.3. OVERALL STUDY DESIGN  
 
This is a 4 week phase II I, multicenter, double -masked, vehicle -controlled study to evaluate safety and efficacy 
of cenegermin ophthalmic solution at 20 mcg/mL  solution versus vehicle, in patients with severe Sjogren’s dry 
eye disease  Patients will be evaluated as per Section 2 “SCHEDULE OF EVALUATIONS” . 
 
 During the screening (day-8) all procedures for inclusion will be performed. From the day of screening the 
patients will stop any kind of further treatment, except commercially available preservative free artificial tears  
provided by S ponsor for a period of 8 days and 10 days as maximum : day -8 until the baseline visit (day 1+2 ), 
Figure 1. At the end of the wash out period (day -8 to baseline) , patients meeting the entry criteria for this 
study will be randomized 1:1 and treated for 4 weeks with ei ther cenegermin ophthalmic solution 20 mcg/mL  
TID or vehicle TID.  
During the 4 weeks of masked treatment only the administration of IMP is allowed. Never theless, if strictly 
needed, the  patient can take  preservative free artificial tears (provided by [CONTACT_1034]). The use  (n° drops/day) 
of preservative free artificial tears will be clearly documented in a patient’s diary and in the eCRF.

Cenegermin 20 mcg/mL  administered two times daily, demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated    
will also ensure the lubrification of the ocular surface in the present study where the use of artificial tears will 
be not allowed during the treatment period.  
Higher doses of rhNGF (up to 180 mcg/mL ) were administrated to patients with diseases of the back of the 
eye, such as  (Study ) for up to 168 days. 
 
The 20 mcg/mL  concentration of cenegermin  is well  sustained by [CONTACT_317878] a commercial formulation.  
A dose regimen of [ADDRESS_391230] the minimum amount of lubrication that is compatible with symptoms’ 
relief.  A double -blind study design was adopted to minimize systematic bias. Randomization is expected to 
minimize patient selection bias and increa se baseline comparability between treatment groups. The use of 
placebo control is critical to the study design for providing an accurate estimate of the additive benefit of 
pharmacotherapy.   
The use of the drug’s vehicle as placebo helps in making the lat ter as indistinguishable from the cenegermin  
solution . 
Patients with insufficient therapeutic response, tolerability issues, or worsening of symptoms may be 
discontinued at any time during the study.

4.2. ELIGIBLE EYE 
Assuming that all the inclusion/exclusion criteria are met in both eyes, the worse eye (eligible eye) will be 
determined at the baseline visit using  a stepladder approach, as follows:  
1. Schirmer’s Test (since this is the primary endpoint) -Worse eye determined as eye with lower 
Schirmer I score.  
2. NEI score (cornea+conjunctival staining)  - If Schirmer I score is the same in both eyes, worse eye 
will be determined by [CONTACT_317881] (cornea+conjunctival staining). 
 
If all of  the above are identical, determination of the worse eye will be based on the Investigator’s judgement, 
otherwise  simply use the right eye  as the eligible eye.  
4.3. ASSIGNMENT  OF PATIENT  NUMBER  
Each patient who provides written consent to participate in this study will be assigned a unique 5- digit PID 
number (e.g.  01-001) consisting of  a 2-digit study center number followed by [CONTACT_941] 3-digit screening number 
assigned sequentially by [CONTACT_180443] , from 001 to 100.  
4.4. RANDOMI ZATION  
Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either cenegermin ophthalmic  solution 20 mcg/mL  TID 
(⁓50 patients) or vehicle ophthalmic solution TID ( ⁓50patients).  
Each randomized patient will be allocated with randomization number , according to the stratified  
randomization list. Drop outs after randomization will not be replaced. 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_317882]. The stratified 
permuted block randomization list will be g enerated with a computer procedure by [CONTACT_317883]. 
Randomization will be performed through IRS. Each Patient Kit number will be randomly associated with a 
treatment group. The randomization list will  be provided to the facility responsible for IMP packaging/labelling 
for the purpose of IMP preparation. Each randomized patient will be allocated with randomization number 
according to the stratified randomization list. Dropouts after randomization will n ot be replaced  
The enrollment of patients will be scheduled in order to assure an inclusion of approximately [ADDRESS_391236] 90 patients assuming up to 10% dropout rate. 
4.5. MASKING  
The identity of the treatments will remain unknown to the patient, Investigator, site staff and Sponsor’s clinical 
research personnel until the completion of the study  (after full data base lock) except in case of specific events 
that will require unmasking of the patient.

The vials containing cenegermin  (20 mcg/mL ) or vehicle will be identical in appearance, and the contents of 
the vials will be indistinguishable. All staff directly involved in the analysis of study results will remain masked 
to treatment assignments while the study is in progress. 
A list of sequential kit numbers will be generated by a n independent statistician  not involved in the conduct of 
the study. Each kit number will be randomly associated with a treatment group. Patients will be assigned to 
treatment in numerical order. A tear -off label from the kit box, with the kit number, will be attached to the 
investigational product dispensing log. 
The investigator will be provided with a protected  access to the randomization list  so only in case of a medical 
emergency the Investigator can open th e treatment allocation for a specific patient.  
Also Dompé ’s Pharmacovigilance contact [CONTACT_317884] a protected access to randomization 
list , so if required by [CONTACT_317885] a specific Patient.  
 
In the event of a medical emergency where the knowledge of patient treatment is required to provide the patient 
with appropriate care, Investigators will have the possibility to unmask the treatment assignment for a specific patient. The Investigators are encouraged to contact [CONTACT_317886].  
If the Investigator becomes unmasked for any reason, this information will be recorded on source data and in 
the eCR F of the study, specifying the date and the reason.  
 
Unmasking events will be recorded and reported in the final study report.

   Study Protocol: NGF0121 
 
 
Version No. 6.0  – Final 26/JAN/[ADDRESS_391240] and/or Investigator will be responsible for receipt, proper storage, and usage of study drug, as 
well as for the IMP distribution, collection of used and unused vials and final disposal of the remaining IMP.  
The investigational product must be stored at - 20 ± 5 °C at the investigational sites, in an appropriate locked 
room accessible only to the pharmacist, the Investigator, or a duly designated person.  A temperature probe and data logger will accompany the drug on shipment. It is essential that the 
investigatio nal sites will verify the temperature excursion during shipment vs. the acceptable storage 
conditions, in order to identify potential stability concerns during shipment. These must be immediately communicated to the Sponsor that will decide upon appropriate actions to be taken. The IMP will be stored in a locked place, sheltered from light. The vials will be not shaken since agitation of vials may cause foaming 
and/or particle formation.  
On Day 1 (baseline visit), the study personnel will give to the patient the monthly boxes containing the study 
medications  
Patient should bring the study medication, one monthly box, at home as soon as possible and immediately 
store it in a freezer at -20 ± 5 °C. 
The weekly box mus t be kept at 2-8°C for 7 days  protected from light;  the daily vial can be kept at room 
temperature ,  before the patient will use the single vial for each instillation (both eyes) as long as 12 hours are 
not exceeded. Agitation of vials may cause foaming and/or particle formation. Drug preparation and 
administration instructions will be provided separately to the site and to the patients.   
 
Together with the IMP monthly box, the patient will also receive a separate administration kit of vial adapte rs 
(one per vial), pi[INVESTIGATOR_6343] (3 per vial) and disinfectant wipes ( 3 per vial); some spare samples could be provided 
to ensure product administration. 
IMP 
ophthalmic solution instruction will be provided to patients.  
Patients will use one vial to instill on e drop in both eyes (group 1 : cenegermin TID; group 2 : vehicle TID) 
three times a day  (approximately every 6 hours), starting in the morning when they wake up, for a total duration 
of 4 weeks".. 
The contents of each vial are for the daily administration to both eyes o nly. After the last administration the 
used vial should be returned to the original medication box and is not to be reused. Any deviations from the recommended storage conditions should be immediately reported by [CONTACT_317887], and the use of the drug should be suspended until they have given authorization 
for its continued use. The IMP supplies are to be used only in accordance with this protocol. The Investigator 
will not use any drug samples f or other purposes (e.g., treating patients or deviating from the protocol with 
regard to dose regimen, duration of treatment, etc.). Under no circumstances will the Investigator give any 
drug samples to a third party.

5.4.1.  Administration route  
The Administration route is topi [INVESTIGATOR_317822] .  
 
5.4.2.  Dose regimen  
In all patients  both eyes will be treated  for a period of 4 weeks.  
 
The dosing scheme of the different study groups is summarized below:  
 
Group 1 : one drop of cenegermin  20 mcg/mL  will be instilled in both eyes three times daily  (every 6 hours, 
e.g. 7:00 am, 01:00 pm; 07:00 pm).  
  
Group 2 : one vehicle drop will be instilled in both eyes three times daily (every 6 hours, e.g. 7:00 am, 01:00 
pm; 0 7:00 pm). 
 
During the 4 weeks of masked treatment only the administration of IMP  is allowed. Nevertheless, if strictly 
needed, the patient can take a preservative free artificial tears (provided by [CONTACT_1034]). The use (n° drops/day) 
of preservative free artificial tears will be clearly documented in a patient’s diary and in the eCRF.  
Both the patients  and the investigator will be masked to the study treatment. 
Information about the  study drug administration, and comments, will be recorded on the appropriate page of 
the eCRF.  
 
5.5. ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE IMP  
The Pharmacist and/or Investigator will confirm the receipt of the IMP supply in writing by [CONTACT_317888]. 
At the week 4 (end of treatment visit)  the patient will return the used or unused study boxes /vials  to the 
Investigator.  
The Pharmacist and/or Investigator will keep a cumulative inventory and dispensing records, and will maintain 
all supplies under adequate security.  
An accurate drug disposition record will be kept, specifying the date and amount dispensed to each patient.  Adequate record of receip t and use or loss of drug will be retained. This inventory record must be available 
for inspection by [CONTACT_58207]. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_317823].

6.3.1.  Primary Reason For Discontinuation From The Study  
A premature discontinuation will occur when a patient who signed the ICF ceases participation in the study, 
regardless of circumstances, before the completion of the study protocol procedures. Patients can be prematurely discontinued from the study for one of the following reasons:  
 
 Adverse event (AE) : Any significant AE that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_317831] ,  is 
not compatible with study continuation.  
 Disea se progression or worsening , that according to the opi[INVESTIGATOR_317832]..  
 Death . 
 Lost to follow -up (Every effort must be made to contact [CONTACT_102]; a registered letter must be sent).  
 Non-compliance with study drug : an indication that a patient has not agreed with or followed the 
instructions related to the study medication.  
 Severe Protocol violation : an event or decision that stands in contrast to the guidelines set out by [CONTACT_12695].

 Study terminated by [CONTACT_1034] : an indication that a clinical study was stopped by [CONTACT_2728].  
 Withdrawal of consent : study discontinuation requested by a patient  for whatever reason.  
 Other reasons , such as administrative reasons or pregnancy .  
 
Before removal, each  case should first be discussed with Dompé farmaceutici S.p.A. 
The reasons for premature discontinuation from the study will be reflected on the Study Termination Record 
of the e CRF. Unless the patient has withdrawn consent, the follow up visit assessments should be performed 
as detailed in § 6. 
 
The investigator shou ld advise patients that prematurely discontinue on any therapi[INVESTIGATOR_317833]  
6.3.2.  Discontinuation procedures  
Treatment discontinuation 
Patients who discontinue the treatment will not be w ithdrawn from the study by [CONTACT_15094], but will be asked to 
complete safety and efficacy observations as per the protocol, unless otherwise they withdraw their consent.   
Study discontinuation  
For any patient  discontinuing the study following randomization, the Investigator will:  
  ask the patient to undergo, as far as possible, a final medical visit (Early Termination Visit - ETV) to 
examine the patient 's health conditions. This examination will verify that a ll values tested at screening 
have remained within a clinically acceptable range (i.e., not clinically significant changes compared to screening). 
 arrange for alternative medical care of the withdrawn patient, if necessary . 
 report in the eCRF date and time  of the last dose administration, and date and primary reason of study 
discontinuation. 
 record in the eCRF any follow -up if the patient  is withdrawn for an AE. AE’s should be followed until 
resolution. 
 
 
6.3.3.  Replacement procedure  
Patients in this study who prematurely discontinue treatment will not be replaced.  
 
It will be documented whether or not each patient completed the clinical study. If, for a patient , study 
treatment or observations are discontinued, the primary reason for discontinuation will be recorded.

6.4. END OF STUDY 
Patients completing the double -blind treatment and follow -up (Visits 1 Baseline to Visit 7 Follow up) will 
be considered completers.  
For the purpose of  this trial, the End of Study is defined as the date of the  last visit of the last patient. The 
Investigator and the Sponsor have the right to discontinue the study at any time for reasonable medical and/or 
administrative reasons. As far as possible, this should occur after mutual consultation. Reasons for 
discontinuation have to be documented appropriately. In this event, no further patients will receive doses of 
the study drugs, and patients already having received a dose of study drug will not receive any further doses 
of the study IMP but will undergo all safety assessments scheduled after the last dose of study drug, up to an 
including the end of study examination.

8. EVALUATION OF ADVERSE EVENTS AND SAFETY INFORMATION  
8.1. DEFINITIONS  
Adverse Event  
An Adverse Event  (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unint ended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related 
to the medicinal product.  
Adverse Drug Reaction  
An Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)  is defined as any noxious and unintended response to a medicinal product 
related to any dose. Any responses to a medicinal product means that a causal relationship between a medicinal 
product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out. 
The definition covers also medication errors and uses outside what is foreseen in the protocol, including misuse 
and abuse of the product. For the purposes of regulatory safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there 
are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal  relationship between the drug and the adverse event.   
Adverse events are to be considered unrelated  if the relationship to the study drug, as described in the table in 
§ 8.3.1,   is none or unlikely; whereas any AE reported in the study having a possible, probable or highly 
probable relationship to study drug will be considered as an ADR.  
Serious Adverse Event  
A Serious Adverse Event ( SAE ) is defined as any adverse experience that, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, meets any of the following criteria: 
• results in death,  
• is life -threatening (i.e. the patient was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer 
to an event which hypothetically migh t have caused death if it were more severe),  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
NOTE: In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_317834]/or treatment (usually involving an overnight stay) that would not have been appropriate in 
the physician's office or an outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084]. If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the event is serious. When in doubt 
as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred, the event should be considered serious.  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity . 
NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor  medical significance such as 
uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, or accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions , but do not constitute a substantial disruption  

 
   Study Protocol: NGF0121 
 
 
Version No. 6.0  – Final 26/JAN/2022    
  
Page 53 of 81 
  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, 
• is an important medical event.  
NOTE: An important medical event is an event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may be considered a SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it m ay 
jeopardize the patient’s wellbeing and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in the definitions for SAEs. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emer gency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_317835]-planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_317836], not 
associated with any deterioration in condition are not considered to be SAEs (see Par. 8.4.2).  These events 
must be recorded in the AE page of the eCRF where a variable will be ticked to indicate that they are not SAEs.  
Death shall always be reported as SAE  and cause of death shall always be specified when known.  
Unexpected Adverse Event/Reaction  
An AE or ADR is considered unexpected if it is not listed in the Investigator Brochure or is not listed at the 
specificity or severity that has been observed and listed in the Investigator Brochure. Events that are mentioned 
in the Investigator Brochure (s ection Reference Safety Information)  as occurring with a class of drugs or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring 
with the particular drug under investigation are considered unexpect ed. The determination of expectedness is 
made by [CONTACT_317894] (RSI) section.  
Suspected serious unexpected adverse reaction  
A suspected serious unexpected adverse reaction  (S[LOCATION_003]R)  is defined as an adverse reaction that is both 
unexpected (not consistent with the applicable RSI ) and also meets the definition of a Serious Adverse 
Reaction.  
Adverse Events (AEs) of special Interest (Sight -threatening Events)  
The following adverse events are considered  to be of special interest and by [CONTACT_317895] 
(medically important criteria):  
 AEs that caused a decrease in visual acuity of >30 ETDRS letters or > +0.6 LogMAR (compared with the last assessment of visual acuity at the last visit) las ting >1 hour  
 AEs that caused a decrease in visual acuity to the level of Light Perception or worse lasting >1 hour 
 AEs that required surgical intervention (e.g., conventional surgery, vitreous tap or biopsy with intravitreal 
injection of anti- infectives, or laser or retinal cryopexy with gas) to prevent permanent loss of sight  
 AEs associated with severe intraocular inflammation (i.e., 4+ anterior chamber cell/flare or 4+ vitritis)  
 AEs that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], may require medical intervention to prevent permanent loss of sight.

8.2. ADVERSE EVENT (AE) MONITORING  
Following study informed consent form signature, at each visit,  after the patient has had the opportunity to 
spontaneously mention any problems, the Investigator or appropriate designee should inquire about AEs by 
[CONTACT_243932]:  
• “Have you had any health problems since your last study visit?” 
• “Have there been any changes in the medicines you take since your last study visit?”  
AEs should be reported for any clinically relevant change in concomitant condition(s) that is the result of an 
untoward (unfavorable and unintended) change in patient's medical conditions. Changes in any protocol -
specific ocular or systemic parameter evaluated during the study are to be reviewed by [CONTACT_737]. In addition, the patient’s responses to any questionnaire utilized during the study are to be reviewed by [CONTACT_737]. Any untoward (unfavorable and unintended) change in a protocol -specific parameter or 
questionnaire response that is clinically relevant is to be reported as an AE. These clinically relevant changes 
will be reported regardless of causality. 
All AEs should be followed-up to determine outcome of the reaction.  
In order to collect as complete as possible information in the clinical study database, all ADRs and SAEs 
ongoing at the time the subject’s study participation ends should be evaluated within 10 days after the final 
visit. After this period, all unresolved ADRs and SAEs will be reported as “ongoing” in the eCRF. 
8.3. RECORDING  
AE data should be obtained through observation of the patient, from any information volunteered by [CONTACT_4677], and through patient questioning. 
Adverse Events:  
All AEs (non -serious and serious) that occur during the course of  the study will be recorded in the eCRF. Any 
pre-existing medical conditions or signs/symptoms present in a patient prior to the start of the study (i.e., before 
informed consent is signed) should be specified in the dedicated eCRF sections. Subsequent to signing an 
informed consent form, all untoward medical occurrences that occur during the course of the study must be 
documented on eCRF. AEs will be collected till last Follow Up visit (week 24).  
When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be documented as one 
comprehensive event. For each recorded event, the AE documentation must  include the onset date, outcome, 
resolution date (if event is resolved), intensity (i.e., severity),any action with study treatment taken as a result 
of the event, and an assessment of the adverseevent relationship to the study treatment. 
Serious Adverse Events:  
The Investigator must record all SAEs, including sight -threatening events, occurring at any time  during the 
study (after signature [CONTACT_28513]) regardless of presumed causal relationship, on the Serious 
Adverse Event form in the eCRF of the EDC system within 24 hours of learning of the event; information on the SAE must also be recorded on a specific Non -Carbon Repeat SAE form (included in the Investigator’s Site 
File).  
  

 
   Study Protocol: NGF0121 
 
 
Version No. 6.0  – Final 26/JAN/[ADDRESS_391246] 
The Investigator will assess the relationship between the AE and the investigational medication, according to 
the criteria in Table below: 
Relationship of the Adverse Event to the IMP  
None (Intercurrent 
Event)  An event that is not and cannot be related to the Investigational Product, e.g. patient is a 
passenger in a road traffic accident  or surgical intervention performed during the study, 
but planned before patient enrolment into the study  
Unlikely (remote)  Relationship is not likely e.g.  a clinical event including laboratory test abnormality with 
temporal relationship to drug administration which makes a causal relationship 
improbable and in which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease provide more plausible explanations  
Possible  Relationship may exist, but could have been produced by [CONTACT_102]’s condition or 
treatment or other cause 
Probable  Relationship is likely, the AE abates upon discontinuation of Investigational Product and cannot be due to the patient’s condition  
Highly Probable  Strong relationship, the event abates upon discontinuation of Investigational Product and, if applicable, re -appears upon repeat exposure  
 
An ADR is defined as an adverse experience which is reasonably likely to have been caused by  [CONTACT_33641]. 
Events considered “Possible”, “Probable” and “Highly Probable” related to the IMP  treatment and implying a 
reasonable possibility, if considered unexpected, will be reported to appropriate regulatory authorities  by [CONTACT_429]. 
8.3.2.  Severity of AEs  
The Investigator will grade the severity of any AE using the definitions in the Table below. For each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], 
the highest severity grade attained should be reported. 
Severity of the Adverse Event  
Mild  Grade 1 - Does not interfere with patient’s usual function (awareness of symptoms or 
signs, but easily tolerated [acceptable]).  
Moderate  Grade 2 - Interferes to some extent with patient’s usual function (enough discomfort to 
interfere with usual activity [disturbing]).  
Severe Grade 3 - Interferes significantly with patient’s usual function (incapacity to work or to do 
usual activities [unacceptable]) 
  

 
   Study Protocol: NGF0121 
 
 
Version No. 6.0  – Final 26/JAN/2022    
  
Page 57 of 81 
  
An assessment of expectedness and causality of each serious adverse event will be performed case by [CONTACT_317896]é Pharmacovigilance. For SAE reported by [CONTACT_317897]é, the Investigator will receive a notification. Depending on the nature and seriousness 
of the AE, further information, including copi[INVESTIGATOR_317837], as well as results 
of laboratory tests performed will need to be included in the patients chart. If the patient was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], a 
copy of the discharge summary should be available, if possible. 
In line with CT3 Detailed Guidance and ICH E2A provisions, although the Investigator does not usually need 
to actively monitor patients for AEs once the trial has ended, if the Investigator becomes aware of a SAE 
occurring to a patient after that patient has ended  his/her participation in the study (whether study completion 
or withdrawal) , the SAE should be reported by [CONTACT_317898]é  Pharmacovigilance . Such “post -
study cases” should be regarded for expedited reporting purposes as though they were study reports. Therefore, 
a causality assessment and determination of expectedness are needed for a decision on whether or not expedited reporting is required.  
8.4.2.  Conditions that should not be reported as serious adverse events  
The conditions listed below, that may require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58170] a patient, are not considered to be SAE and shall not be reported as such, but only need to be recorded i n the eCRF:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_317838].  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58172], not associated with any deterioration in condition.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_243888], which was elective or pre- planned, for a pre -existing condition that is 
unrelated to the indication under study and did not worsen.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58174].  
• Treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of SAEs  given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063].  
In addition, t he following situation shall not be considered SAE:  
• Abnormal test results that do not induce clinical signs and/or symptoms and require 
intervention/therapy, i.e. are not clinically significant.  
 
8.4.3.  Reporting Procedure to EC/ IRB and to Regulatory Authorities  
In addition to reporting the SAE to Dompé, the Investigator must also comply with the requirements related to 
the reporting of SAEs to the EC/IRB which approved the study. The requirements of IRBs vary from one IRB 
to another; however, as a minimum requirement, the Investigators must promptly report all suspected 
unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) to their IRB. 
In line with provisions set forth in 21CFR312, Dompé shall notify all participating US Investigators in an I ND 
safety report of any S[LOCATION_003]R  and of potential serious risks, from clinical trials or any other source, as soon as 
possible, but in no case later than:  

 
   Study Protocol: NGF0121 
 
 
Version No. 6.0  – Final 26/JAN/2022    
  
Page 58 of 81 
  
• seven calendar days after becoming aware of the information if the event is fatal or life threatening; to be 
followed by [CONTACT_243934]. 
• fifteen calendar days after becoming aware of the information if the event is serious but neither fatal nor 
life threatening.  
The Investigators in turn shall notify their IRB.  
According to US regulations, the Investigators will be informed in an unblinded fashion: Dompé will open the 
blind and report only S[LOCATION_003]R referred to Oxervate® (cenegermin) ophthalmic solution.  
EU Investigators shall be informed periodically, in a blinded fashion, in line w ith applicable requirements.  
If the results of an investigation show that an ADR not initially determined to be reportable is reclassified as reportable, the Sponsor shall report such reaction in a written safety report as soon as possible, but in no event  
later than 7/15 calendar days after the determination is made.  
Treatment will be unblinded by [CONTACT_58231]é Drug Safety Pharmacovigilance prior to submission of a S[LOCATION_003]R to Regulatory Authorities and only cases referred to active treatment will be considered exped itable for regulatory 
reporting, in line with law requirements. 
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_317839]’s Files.  
Dompé shall report S[LOCATION_003]R to the Regulatory Authorities in the EU and to ECs, as per applicable requirements, within 7/15 calendar days.  
Dompé shall also notify FDA in an IND safety report of potential serious risks, from clinical trials or any other 
source, as soon as possible after Dompé determines that the information qualifies for reporting, in particular shall notify of: 
• any suspected adverse reaction that is both serious and unexpected. Dompé must report an adverse event 
as a suspected adverse reaction only if there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug 
and the adverse event.  
• findings from other studies that su ggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug. Such a finding 
would result in a safety -related change in the overall conduct of the clinical investigation.  
• findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug  
• increased rate of occurrence of serious suspected adverse reactions.  
8.4.4.  Periodical Reporting to Regulatory Authorities  
Dompé shall be responsible to prepare and submit annual safety reports (Development Safety Update Report 
– DSUR) to relevant Regulatory Authorities.  

 
   Study Protocol: NGF0121 
 
 
Version No. 6.0  – Final 26/JAN/[ADDRESS_391247] always notify the Sponsor, so that the reason for any premature 
unmasking can be documented, by [CONTACT_3553] a communication to CRO/Dompé Drug Safety to the contact [CONTACT_317899] “Contact [CONTACT_7171]” and to Dompé Medical Expert. The Investigator will inform the 
Dompé representative (Dompé Medical Expert) if an emergency unmasking was performed without revealing 
the treatment identity, in order to avoid a dissemination of unmasked information. . 
Additionally, Dompé Drug Safety shall  unmask the patient’s treatment if the reported SAE meets criteria of a 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) in order to fulfil expedited regulatory reporting requirements. Unmasked information shall not be disclosed to Investigators. 
The identity of the treatments will remain unknown to the patient, Investigator, site staff and Dompé’s clinical 
research personnel and staff (apart from pharmacovigilance).  
8.6. FOLLOW -UP OF PATIENTS WITH ADVERSE EVENTS (AES)  
The Investigator is responsible fo r adequate and safe medical care of patients during the trial and for ensuring 
that appropriate medical care and relevant follow -up procedures are maintained after the trial. All AEs should 
be followed- up to determine outcome of the reaction or until 10 da ys after the final visit. The Investigator 
should follow -up the event until resolution or stabilization of the condition. It is the Investigator's responsibility 
to assure that the patients experiencing AEs receive definite treatment for any AE, if required. If patient was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_58176] a SAE, a copy of the discharge summary is to be forwarded to /Dompé 
as soon as it becomes available. In addition, a letter from the Investigator that summarizes the events related 
to the case as well as results of a ny relevant laboratory tests also may be requested. Further, depending upon 
the nature of the SAE, Dompé may request copi[INVESTIGATOR_243885]’s medical records.  
For pharmacovigilance purposes, all SAEs should be followed- up in order to elucidate as completely and 
practically as possible their nature and/or causality until resolution of all queries, clinical recovery is complete, 
laboratory results have returned to normal, stable condition is reached or the subject is lost to follow -up. 
Follow- up may therefore continue until after the subject has left the study up to  10 days after his/her 
discontinuation from the study for unrelated SAEs, and without timelines for related SAEs , unless the patient 
denies consent .

8.7. PREGNANCY IN THE CLINICAL TRIAL  
Women of childbearing potential are not excluded from the study as long as  adequate birth control methods 
are being utilized. Women of childbearing potential are defined as all women physiologically capable of 
becoming pregnant. Adequate birth control methods are summarized in the protocol’s exclusion criteria. 
Prior to enrollme nt in the clinical trial, female patients of childbearing potential and their partners must be 
advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during the entire course of the study treatment and for the 30 
days after the study treatment period ends and of the potential risks associated with an unintentional pregnancy. 
During the trial (during the study treatment period and during the follow up), female patients are to be 
instructed to contact [CONTACT_317900]; in the same way, 
male patients who become aware that the partner might be pregnant, are to be instructed to contact [CONTACT_201433].  
The Investigator must report every pregnancy on a pregnancy report form as soon as possible (within 24 
hours of learning of the pregnancy) to /Dompé Drug Safety contacts reported at Paragraph 8.4.1, even if 
no AE has occurred, and follow it to term.  
The pregnancy form will be utilized to capture all pregnancy- related information until the birth of the child 
for both the patient and the partner.  
If the  pregnancy is associated with a SAE (e .g. if the mother is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16113]), in addition to the 
pregnancy report form, a separate SAE report form must be filed as described in § 8.4 with the appr opriate 
serious criterion (e.g. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) indicated on the SAE report form. Miscarriage, stillbirth and any 
malformation/disease must be reported as a SAE. Any pregnancy leads to the immediate cessation of the study 
treatment.  
8.8. ADVERSE EVENTS CAUSING TREATMENT DISCONTINUATION  
If a patient is withdrawn from the study as a consequence of an AE, this must be recorded and reasoned in the eCRF, and the patient must be followed up until the resolution of the AE or as instructed by [CONTACT_35011] . 
8.9. OVERDOSE  
Overdose (accidental or intentional) which may or may not result in serious adverse reactions, shall  be reported 
to Sponsor Drug Safety/  by [CONTACT_71345] , following the same procedure for SAE, within 24 hours from the 
Investigator’s knowledge  of its occurrence. This includes reports related to drug intake through different routes 
(e.g. ingestion) or with suicidal intentions and consequent drug overdose. 
An overdose of Oxervate
®20 mcg/mL  of cenegermin ophthalmic solution is defined as the administration of 
50% or more additional drops on any given treatment day. 
 
The Investigator shall provide in the SAE form information about symptoms, corrective treatment and outcome 
of overdose. The Medical Expert [INVESTIGATOR_73371][INVESTIGATOR_530] t o discuss corrective treatment, if necessary.

9. STATISTICS  
9.1. SAMPLE SIZE 
The sample size of the study is calculated based on results from previous studies. 
Considering a randomization ratio 1:1 and a one -sided alpha of 0.025, a total of 90 evaluable patients w ill 
allow to achieve an overall power of 90% to show superiority of cenegermin  20 mcg/mL  ophthalmic  solution 
vs vehicle in terms of both co- primary endpoints, expecting a difference of 30% in Schirmer I rate of 
responders in favour of cenegermin  20 mcg/mL  ophthalmic  solution treatment at Week 4 and a 15 points 
Global SANDE score improvement at Week 12 (with a SD of 20 points). 
Since both endpoints must be met in order to claim superiority, no multiplicity correction of alpha is required 
Assuming that 10% of subjects will not be evaluable for primary analysis, a total of approximately 100 subjects 
is expected to be enrolled.  
9.2. ANALYSIS POPULATION 
The following population will be defined: 
• The Safety (SAF) population will consist of all randomized patients who received at least one dose of the 
investigational product. Safety population will be analyzed according to the actual treatment received. The 
SAF population will be used to present results on safety data. 
• The Full Analysis Set (FAS) population will consist of all randomized patients who received at least one 
dose of the investigational product. FAS population will be analyzed according to ITT principle, i.e. by 
[CONTACT_155150]. The FAS population will be used for the primary analyses of the study and to present results on efficacy data.  
• The Per Protocol (PP) population will consist of all randomized patients who received at least one dose of 
the investigational product and do not have Major Protocol Deviations. The PP population will be used for 
sensitivity analyses. 
9.3. OVERVIEW OF PLANNED STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
The study plans for the following statistical analyses:  
• Final analysis: this analysis will be conducted when all enrolled subjects have completed the treatment 
at week [ADDRESS_391248] without unblinding the investigators and study personnel about treatment codes. 
• Addendum to final analysis:  this additional analysis will be conducted when all enrolled subjects have 
completed the FU at week 24, and the study database has been locked and unblinded.  A dedicated 
addendum to the CSR will be created.

be presented.  If appropriate, confidence intervals around the mean or the proporti ons will be presented. The 
number of subjects with missing data will be presented under the “Missing” category. Missing values will not be included in the denominator count when computing percentages. When continuous data will be summarized, 
only the non-m issing values will be evaluated for computing summary statistics. Any exception will be 
declared.  
For the purpose of efficacy analysis in this trial, the statistical analysis (both descriptive and inferential) of 
some endpoints will be done on the eligible eye when applicable. Details will be provided in the statistical analysis outputs as notes.  
Unless otherwise specified, the significance level used for statistical testing will be 0.[ADDRESS_391250]- hoc analysis may be produced to furt her allow 
comparison between treatment and control, according to the results obtained. Any deviations from the original 
statistical plan (including unplanned analyses) will be documented in the Clinical Study Report.   
9.4.2.  Primary Estimand 
A Treatment Policy Estimand is defined by [CONTACT_716]:  
• Population: Subjects in the FAS population (section 9.2); 
• Variable: both signs (Schirmer I test) and symptoms (SANDE global score) endpoints at week 4 and 12, 
respectively;  
• Intercurrent event: The occurrence of an intercurrent event is irrelevant. All observed values will be used 
regardless of occurrence of an intercurrent event. Retrieved drop -outs will be used for data imputation of 
missing data; 
• Population-level summary: proportion of patients reaching a value of Schirmer I test (without anesthesia) 
>10mm/5min at week 4, and change from baseline in the global SANDE score at week 12.  
9.4.3.  Analysis of efficacy variables 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Primary analyses 
The following null hypothesis is defined on the first primary endpoi nt: the proportion of patients reaching a 
value of Schirmer I test (without anesthesia) >10mm/5min at week 4 in cenegermin (rhNGF)  is lower or equal 
than control:

Page 63 of 81 
  
H01: TrhNGF ≤ T CONTROL  
H11: TrhNGF > T CONTROL  
where T rhNGF and T CONTROL  are the proportion of patients reaching a value of Schirmer I test (without 
anesthesia) >10mm/5min at week 4 for cenegermin and control groups, respectively. The null hypothesis H 01 
will be rejected if the associated primary analysis p -value will be lower than 0.025. 
This primary endpoint will be analyzed by [CONTACT_3553] a logistic regression adjusting by [CONTACT_094] -defined baseline 
factors (site, gender, age class, baseline Schirmer I test value) and a one- sided test will be used to test for 
differences between trea tment groups.  
Similarly, the following null hypothesis is defined on the co- primary endpoint: the change from baseline in the 
global SANDE score at week 12 in cenegermin  is lower or equal than control:  
H02: µrhNGF ≤ µ CONTROL  
H12: µrhNGF > µ CONTROL  
where µ rhNGF and µ CONTROL  are the change from baseline in the global SANDE score at week 12 for cenegermin  
and control groups, respectively. The null hypothesis H 02 will be rejected if the associated primary analysis p -
value will be lower than 0.025. 
This coprima ry endpoint will be analyzed by [CONTACT_317901]- defined baseline 
factors (site, gender, age class, baseline global SANDE score) and a one- sided test will be used to test for 
differences between treatment groups.  
Both null hypothe ses H [ADDRESS_391251] be rejected in order to claim superiority of cenegermin  over control. 
Consequently, no multiplicity correction of type I error will be applied on primary endpoints analysis. 
Since patients who discontinue the treatment with the IMP will not be withdrawn from the study but will be 
asked to complete safety and efficacy assessments as per the protocol, missing data under treatment policy 
strategy will be addressed by [CONTACT_317902]- outs (based on 
assumption  of missing data would have been like retrieved drop- outs if they were assessed ). Retrieved drop-
out patients are defined as patients who discontinue study treatment  and decide to remain in the study by 
[CONTACT_317903].  
If enough retrieved drop -out data are available to allow convergence of a regression model, a Multiple 
Imputation model based on retrieved drop- outs (MI -RD) will be used for analysis. Specifically,  MI will be 
performed based on the subjects’ allocated treatment arm and observed values ( baseline and intermediate ) as 
covariates in a regression model using data from subjects that discontinued the treatment but have the primary endpoint measurement  with gender, and age class as covariates. For each co -primary endpoint, MI -RD will be 
implemented into different steps:  
• Intermittent missing data up to primary time point (Week [ADDRESS_391252], and Week 12 for 
SANDE) will be imputed using MCMC methods assuming missing at random  (MAR) data;   
• The remaining missing values with a monotone missing data pattern will be imputed based on observed 
data of r etrieve dropouts;  

 
   Study Protocol: NGF0121 
 
 
Version No. 6.0  – Final 26/JAN/2022    
  
Page 64 of 81 
  
• the fully imputed datasets will be analyzed and results will be combined using Rubin’s to draw 
inference.  
If no t enough  data was retrieved after study treatment discontinuation for assure the convergence of the MI -
RD regression model (the final decision will be done at the time of the analysis and reported in the CSR ; 
different approaches might be used for the two coprimary endpoint) , the same model will be fit using data from 
subjects of control group, wash ing-out the effect of treatmen t; this approach does not assume benefits for 
cenegermin  in case of discontinuation and limits a post -discontinuation clinical effect to that of vehicle . 
Specifically, wash -out approach will be implemented in this way: 
• Intermittent missing data up to prima ry time point (Week [ADDRESS_391253], and Week 12 for 
SANDE) will be imputed using MCMC methods assuming MAR;   
• The remaining missing values in the vehicle group with a monotone missing data pattern will be 
imputed based on observed data of the control patients with available endpoint , while the remaining 
missing values in the treatment  group with a monotone missing data pattern will be imputed based on 
observed and imputed data of the control  patients;  
• All imputed data  will be pooled and analyzed , and results will be combined using Rubin’s to draw 
inference.  
Whether for MI -RD or wash -out approach, the adjusted estimated treatment differences between cenegermin 
and vehicle (difference in proportions for Schirmer’s test and differences in means for SANDE) will be 
displayed together with the corresponding two -side 95% confidence intervals and p-values. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Sensitivity analyses 
The following sensitivity analyses are defined to assess the robustness of results on each primary endpoint 
versus assumption s used in the statistical model for the main estimators : 
• The comparison between treatment and control will be performed in the FAS population by [CONTACT_317904] ( MNAR ). MI will be implemented in 
two steps:  
o Intermittent missing data up to primary time point (Week [ADDRESS_391254], and Week 12 for SANDE) will be imputed using MCMC methods assuming MAR. A separate imputation 
model will be used for each treatment arm. The imputation models will include th e observed 
values (baseline and intermediate), gender, and age class as covariates. In case of non -
convergence or non- estimability issues, a single model will be considered with treatment arm 
added as explanatory variable to the model;  
o The remaining missi ng values with a monotone missing data pattern will be imputed based on 
data of corresponding treatment group.  
Each imputed dataset will be analyzed using observed and imputed as described in section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
Rubin’s rule will be used for combining results to draw inference. The adjusted estimated treatment differences between cenegermin and vehicl e (difference in proportions for Schirmer’s  test and 

 
   Study Protocol: NGF0121 
 
 
Version No. 6.0  – Final 26/JAN/2022

differences in means for SANDE) will be displayed together with the corresponding two- side 95% 
confidence intervals and p-values.  
 
• A tippi[INVESTIGATOR_317840] a sensitivity analysis for missing data for assessment of 
superiority (if shown) of cenegermin . For each coprimary endpoint, tippi[INVESTIGATOR_11300], will assess how 
departures from MI under MNAR assumptions must be in order to overturn conclusions from the primary superiority analysis . Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_317841]-RD (or MI 
under wash-out approach), where the imputed values for the cenegermin arm are shifted at a constant Δ to represent a worse effect in each iteration. The tippi[INVESTIGATOR_317842] Δs at which no 
statistical significance is shown (p≥0.025).  
  
In addition, for each primary endpoint, the regression models detailed in section [IP_ADDRESS] will be performed for 
supportive purposes: 
• by [CONTACT_317905] (i.e. without considering patients with missing primary endpoint);  
• on the PP set instead of FAS. 
Details on sensitivity and supportive analyses will be provided in the SAP. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Secondary analyses 
In case analysis of the primary endpoints leads to rejection of null hypotheses, the following key secondary 
endpoints will be tested in a conditional sequential manner to show superiority of cenegermin  versus control 
(at alpha one-sided  0.025 ) according to the following ranking:  
 
1. Change from baseline in Schirmer I test (without anesthesia ) at week 8 ;  
2. Change from baseline in SANDE scores for severity at week 12;  
3. Change from baseline in SANDE scores for frequency at week 12 ;  
4. IDEEL modules (Quality of Life [27 questions ], Dry eye Treatment satisfaction & Bother [10 
questions], and Dry eye Symptom bother [20 questions]) at week 12 and at week 4 (in this order);  
5. Change from baseline in Cornea and conjunctiva vital staining with fluorescein NEI scales at week 4, 
week 8  and at week 12 (in this order); 
6. Change from baseline in TFBUT at week 4, week 8 and at week 12 (in this order). 
This hierarchical test strategy protects the family -wise false positive error rate at the overall one- sided 0.025 
level.  
Key secondary endpoints 1., 2., and 3. will be analyzed as detailed in section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Changes from baseline in each IDEEL modules scale score will be analyzed using an mixed model for repeated 
measures (MMRM). The analyses will include the fixed, categorical effects of treatment, visit (4 levels: Weeks

4, 8, 12, 16) and treatment by [CONTACT_23259]. Subject will be considered as a random effect. The covariance 
matrix used will be "unstructured". Comparisons versus vehicle TID will be provided using least square means at each visit and overall.  Missing data will be imputed according to the questionnaire manuals.  
Changes from baseline in TFBUT  and Fluorescein staining (NEI scale) will be analyzed by [CONTACT_317906] -defined baseline factors (site, gender , age class, corresponding baseline 
value). Missing data will be imputed according to MI-RD ( or wash -out approach, see section [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
In case of n ot rejection of null hypotheses, the above test strategy will not be performed. Instead, independently 
of results on primary endpoints, descriptive in nature analyses will be performed on all secondary endpoints at each available timepoints by [CONTACT_317907]. Data transformation might be used in order to satisfy the assumption of normality requested by [CONTACT_317908]. In case such assumptions are not met, non -
parametric counterpart tests will be used. Change from baseline value (for continuous variables) and shift 
tables versus baseline (for categorical variables) will also be summarized for all post -baseline visits.  
Further details will be provided in the SAP. 
9.4.4.  Analysis of variables  
In addition to descriptive statistics at each available time point,  variables will be analyzed by [CONTACT_317909] (all confidence intervals and statistical tests on 
 endpoints are of descriptive nature). Change from baseline value (for continuous variables) and 
shift tables versus baseline (for categorical variables) might be reported for all post -baseline visit s. 
Correlation between sign and symptom score s at different time points will be assessed.  
9.4.5.  Analysis of safety variables 
Adverse events (AEs) will be coded by [CONTACT_1196] (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT), using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  
Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) are all events occurring or worsening after the first dose of the IMP. TEAEs 
will be presented by [CONTACT_317910] 
(SOC) and Pre ferred Terms (PT) using MedDRA. Analyses will be provided also by [CONTACT_12917], relationship 
to treatment, severity and study period (treatment or follow-up). 
Individual AEs will be listed in patient data listings.  
9.4.6.  Subgroup analysis  
Subgroup analyses of pri mary and secondary endpoints will  be performed on the following subgroups of 
baseline characteristics : 
• Age class (≤ Median, > Median ), 
• Race,  
• Ethnicity.

Statistical tests for interaction (between subgroup variable and treatment arm) will be performed before 
investigate further subgroups : analys es will be performed if interaction tests between treatment and variable is  
statistically significant at 15% nominal level. Variables that may be evaluated after test for interaction are:  
• Region (EU, US),  
• Sjögren's syndr ome (primary, secondary ), 
• Medical history,  
• Concomitant medication.  
Statistical details and potential new subgroups definitions will be reported in the SAP. 
9.4.7.  Missing data 
All reasonable efforts will be made to reduce the rate of missing data. Investigators will be trained about the 
importance of patient retention and full data capture. Also, any reasonable attempts should be made by [CONTACT_317911]’s participation for the full duration of the trial. However, in order 
to minimize missing data, if a patient cannot refer to the site for a planned follow -up visit, the Investigator will 
try to obtain any relevant information from the patients, including documents/laboratory results available from 
local medical care.

12.2. MONITORING 
Before any patient enters the study, a representative of  Sponsor/ CRO , will meet with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_317852] t hem on recording the data in the CRFs 
using the electronic data capture (EDC) system. After the first patient is enrolled, the  progress of the study will 
be periodically monitored by [CONTACT_307890], a monitor, conducting on-site visits. This CRA will 
also be able to review query statuses remotely, possibly warranting more frequent communication with the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_317853]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_317854], source documents, signed consent 
forms, and al l other study -related documents. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_317855], resolving data queries generated by [CONTACT_317917], providing missing or corrected data, 
approving all changes performed on his or her data, and endorsing the patient data within the EDC system. 
This approval method will include applying an electronic signature, a uniquely assigned username [CONTACT_242320] a traditional handwritten signature.  
The monitor will visit the stu dy site on a regular basis to perform Source Data Verification (SDV) and/or will 
perform remote checks to ensure that the study is conducted and documented in accordance with this protocol, 
ICH GCP guidelines, regulatory requirements and any study specific  documents such as eCRF completion 
guidelines. 
Monitoring visits or remote monitoring will be conducted to confirm that e.g.: 
• The investigational team is adhering to the study protocol 
• Informed consent has been adequately obtained from all participants  prior to study specific procedures being 
performed  
• AEs have been reported and followed up as required and any SAEs have been reported according to the 
requirements  
• Data are being accurately recorded in the eCRFs in a timely manner

• The Investigator’s Site File is being adequately maintained  
• Facilities and staffing resources are, and remain, acceptable and sufficient throughout the study 
• The Investigator and the site are receiving sufficient information and support throughout the study  
Moreover, during on- site monitoring visits the data recorded in the eCRFs, source documents and other study-
related records will be compared against each other in order to ensure accurate data that reflect the actual existence of the subject in the study i .e. source data verification. 
Monitoring procedures are described in the concerned Standard Procedural Documents of the CRO in charge and in the Monitoring Plan, which also encompasses situational changes, e.g. intermediate switch to remote 
monitoring only  if site visits are not possible; details concerning the nature and extent of Source Data 
Verification are also provided in the Monitoring Plan.  
12.3. ACCESS TO RECORDS  
The Investigator will allow designated Dompé farmaceutici S.p.a. representatives, including staff from the 
CRO , and regulatory/ethics bodies to have direct access to the source documents to verify the data reported in 
the e CRFs. Source documents are the originals of any documents used by [CONTACT_243941][INVESTIGATOR_307]/ins titution that allow verification of the existence of the patient and substantiate the integrity of the 
data collected during the trial.  
12.4. AUDIT AND INSPECTION 
The study site may be audited by [CONTACT_317918] a regulatory agency on one or more 
occasions. The Investigator may be informed in advance of such a visit.  
12.5. PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS  
Any amendment to this protocol will be provided to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_243893]é farmaceutici s.p.a. No protocol 
amendment may be implemented (with the exception s noted below) before it has been approved by [CONTACT_5040]/IEC  and the signature [CONTACT_3264], signed by [CONTACT_978], has been received by [CONTACT_58231]é farmaceutici s.p.a. If the 
protocol is amended to eliminate or reduce the risk to patients, the amendmen t may be implemented befo re 
IRB/IEC  review and approval. However, the IRB /IEC  must be informed in writing of such an amendment, and 
approval must be obtained within reasonable time limits. Deviating from the protocol is permitted only if 
absolutely necessary for the safety or clinical management of the patients and must immediately  be reported 
to Dompé farmaceutici s.p.a.  
12.6. DISCONTINUATION OF THE STUDY 
Dompé farmaceutici S.p.A. reserves the right to terminate the study in its entirety or at a specific study center 
at any time  on the basis of new information regarding safety or efficacy, or if study progress is unsatisfactory 
for whatever reason (including epi[INVESTIGATOR_7509]) , or for other valid administrative reasons.  

 
   Study Protocol: NGF0121 
 
 
Version No. 6.0  – Final 26/JAN/[ADDRESS_391259] to mutual agreement between the PI [INVESTIGATOR_243894]é farmaceutici S.p.A. 
The Sponsor agrees that the study results (including ne gative and inconclusive as well as positive results) can 
be made publicly available by [CONTACT_317919]; presenting results at 
scientific congresses; and posting information and results on internet- based public register s and databases.  
In any case, study results will be communicated in full to the related competent authorithies for the countries involved by [CONTACT_58251] a complete Clinical Study Report.  
As the Sponsor agrees that the study results can be published by [CONTACT_737](s), the Investigator agrees to submit any manuscript (abstract, publication, paper etc.) to the Sponsor before any public disclosure. 
This will be done in order to ensure that clinical trial results are reported in an objective, accurate and balanced 
manner. The Sponsor reviews proposed manuscripts prior to submission within a reasonable period of time 
(30-90 business days in relation with the complexity of the work). 
The Investigator(s) will also be provided by [CONTACT_317920], tables, figures etc undertaken for the purposes of the article, in order to take responsibility 
for the content of the publication(s).  
On an exceptional basis, the Sponsor may temporarily delay r egistration of certain data elements (e.g. 
compound, name, outcome, measures etc.) to seek necessary intellectual property protection. This is because 
early disclosure of such a data could, in some circumstances, prevent or negatively impact patentability.

criteria proposed by [CONTACT_317921]-European Consensus Group. Ann Rheum Dis 2002; 61:554-[ZIP_CODE]. 
In order to make a diagnosis of Sjögren’s syndrome, the following criteria must be met: 
I. Ocular Symptoms (at least one)  
• Symptoms of dry eyes for at least 3 months 
• A foreign body sensation in the eyes 
• Use of artificial tears 3 or more times per day 
II. Oral Symptoms (at least one)  
• Symptoms of dry mouth for at least 3 months  
• Recurrent or persistently swollen salivary glands 
• Need for liquids to swallow dry foods 
III. Ocular Signs (at least one)  
• Abnormal Schirmer’s test, (without anesthesia; ≤5 mm/5 minutes)  
• Positive vital dye staining of the eye surface 
IV. Histopathology  
• Lip biopsy showing focal lymphocytic sialoadenitis (focus score ≥1 per 4 mm2)  
V. Oral Signs (at least one) 
• Unstimulated whole salivary flow (≤1.5 mL in 15 minutes)  
• Abnormal parotid sialography 
• Abnormal salivary scintigraphy 
VI. Autoantibodies (at least one) 
• Anti-SSA (Ro) or Anti -SSB (La), or both 
For a primary Sjögren’s syndrome diagnosis: 
• Any [ADDRESS_391260] include either item IV (Histopathology) or VI (Autoantibodies) 
• Any 3 of the 4 objective criteria (III, IV, V, VI)  
 
For a secondary Sjögren’s syndrome diagnosis:  
• In patients with another well- defined major connective tissue disease, the presence of one symptom 
(I or II) plus 2 of the 3 objective criteria (III, IV and V) is indicative of secondary SS.

Protocol 011711IN, Spectrum 5 Study DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution 
Version 1.0 18JULY2018 Confidential Page 5 of 94 subjects diagnosed with POAG or OHT .  
Duration of Treatment: 8-Week Run -in Period with latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.005% 
and 3-month Treatment Period with DE-117 ophthalmic solution 0.002% 
Methodology : 
This is an open-label multi-center study. Subjects diagnosed with POAG or OHT who  meet the 
eligibility criteria at Visit 1 (Screening) will enter a Washout Period, the duration of which is 
determined by [CONTACT_594517][INVESTIGATOR_15434] -lowering medication (s) if any. After completing the 
required Washout Period, subjects will return for Visit 2 (Week -8, start of the Run-in Period). 
Subjects who remain qualified will start a Run-in Period dosing with latanoprost ophthalmic 
solution 0.005% once daily in the evening in both eyes, and then return for Visit 3 (Week -4, 
midpoint of the Run-in Period) and Visit 4 (Baseline, Da y 1), to confirm ongoing eligibility.  
Subjects who meet all eligibility criteria at Visit 4 (Baseline, Da y 1), will enter the Treatment 
Period and will be treated with DE-117 ophthalmic solution 0.002 % once daily in the evening 
in both eyes for 3 months. During the 3-month Treatment Period, three follow-up visits will be 
scheduled: Visit 5 (Week 2), Visit 6 (Week 6) and Visit 7 (Month 3 ). 
Approximately 150 subjects with POAG or OHT who meet all eligibility criteria are planned to 
enter the T reatment Period and be treated with DE-117 ophthalmic solution 0.002%. 
Study Design  
 
 
This study will consist of a Screening Period which includes a Washout Period of up to 35 days 
(28 days + 7 days window) and an additional 8-W eek Latanoprost Run-in Period; followed by a 
3-month Open- Label Treatment Period with DE-117 0.002% ophthalmic solution. 
At Visit 1 (Screening ; start of the Washout Period [if applicable]), subjects will be screened 
against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eligible subjects will be instructed to discontinue 
use of all IOP-lowering medications during the Washout Period as follows (up to +7 days as a 
window is allowed):  
 Miotics: 7 days 
 Oral/topi[INVESTIGATOR_358468] (CAIs): 7 days 
 Alpha agonists: 14 days 
 Alpha/beta agonists: 14 days 

Protocol 0117 11IN, Spectrum 5 Study  DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 6 of 94  Alpha antagonists ( α1 blocker ): 28 days  
 Beta antagonists (β blocker, including αβ blockers ): 28 days  
 Prostaglandins Analogs (PGA): 28 days  
 Rho kinase inhibitor: 28 days  
 Combination drugs: The longest washout period of the individual component will be 
used.  
During the required washout period,  subjects who discontinue their c urrent treatment, may, if 
the investigator deems it necessary, be treated with a short -acting IOP lowering agent, topi[INVESTIGATOR_594482] ( CAI), e.g., brinzolamide or dorzolamide eye drops, one drop 
twice daily. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_594483] s topped at the latest 1 week before Visit 2  
(Week -8, start of the Run -in Period ). An interim safety visit may be performed during the 
washout period , Visit 1a  (optional, mid-washout  visit), if in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], a 
subject’s IOP may be of concern.  If subjects are treated with a topi[INVESTIGATOR_594484], Visit 1a (optional, mid-washout visit ) is recommended to be performed.  
Subjects who have not used an IOP -lowering medication for the last 28 days, will need a wait 
period of ≥ 1 day before Visit 2 ( Week -8, start of the Run -in Period ). 
At Visit 2 ( Week -8, start of the Run -in Period ), continuing eligibility will be determined based 
on non -treated IOP : 
 IOP ≥  [ADDRESS_784230] one eye  
 IOP ≤ [ADDRESS_784231] ophthalmic solution 0.005%  every  evening  at 20:00  (±60min)  in 
both eyes.  
Visit [ADDRESS_784232] at Week -4 (midpoint of  the Run -in Period)  to check the following IOP 
criteria:  
 The same eye meeting criteria at Visit 2 (Week -8, start of the Run -in Period), must 
meet the following criteria: p ercent decrease of IOP from Visit  2 (Week -8, start of 
the Run -in Period)  of  ≤ 25% at all measurement time points  
 Visit 3 8:00 IOP should  be compared with Visit 2 8:00 IOP;  
 Visit 3 12:00 IOP should  be compared with Visit 2 12:00 IOP;  
 Visit 3 16:00 IOP should  be compared with Visit 2 16:00 IOP.   
 IOP in both eyes  of ≤ 34 mmHg at all measurement time points  
Subjects who are qualified at Visit 3  (Week -4, midpoint of the Run -in Period ), will 
complete the remainder of the [ADDRESS_784233] ophthalmic solution 0.005%  every  evening at 20:00  (±60min)  in both 
eyes.  
Visit 4 ( Baseline , Day 1) will take place at the end of the Run-in Period  and is considered the 
Protocol [ADDRESS_784234] to be met to initiate  the Treatment Period 
with DE -117 ophthalmic solution 0.002% : 
 The same  eye meeting  criteria at Visit 3 (Week -4, midpoint of the Run -in Period) 
must meet  the following criteria: p ercent decrease of IOP from Visit 2 ( Week -8, 
start of the Run -in Period ) of ≤ 15% at all measurement time point s 
 Visit  4 8:00 IOP should be compared with Visit 2 8:00 IOP; 
 Visit 4 12:00 IOP should be compared with Visit 2 12:00 IOP; 
 Visit 4 16:00 IOP should be compared with Visit 2 16:00 IOP.   
 IOP in both eyes of ≤ 34 mmHg at all measurement time points  
Subjects who are qualified at Visit 4  (Baseline, Day 1) , will be enrolled into study and 
begin the 3-month  Treatment Period , dosing with one drop  of DE-117 ophthalmic 
solution 0.002% every evening at 20:00  (±60min)  in both eyes . Follow -up visits will be 
scheduled at Week 2 (Visit 5), Week 6 (Visit 6) and Month 3  (Visit 7) . 
IOP will be measured at 8:00, 12:00 and 16:00 (±60 min)  at all visits except at Visit 1 
(Screening ) and Visit 1a  (optional, mid-washout visit)  when one measur ement at any time will 
suffice . The study eye will be the eye that qualifies per eligibility criteria through Visit 4 
(Baseline, Day 1). If both eyes meet the eligibility criteria, the eye with the higher diurnal IOP 
(calculated as the average of IOP measu rements at  3 time points ) at Visit 4 (Baseline, Day 1) 
will be designated as the study eye. If both eyes meet the eligibility criteria and have the same 
mean diurnal IOP, the right eye will be designated as the study eye.  
At the scheduled visits, query of  adverse events ( AEs), best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)  
and slit lamp biomicroscopy will be performed before the first IOP measuremen t. 
Ophthalmoscopy (fundus examination) will be  performed after the last IOP measurement for 
the day. Additional  procedures are explained in Section  7.4. 
Pharmacogenomics/Genomics : 
Subjects who consent to the optional pharmacogenomics/genomics laboratory study will 
provide a blood sample for future  testing  after subject is enrolled and study drug, DE-117 
ophthalmic solution 0.002% , dosing has begun . The purpose of this exploratory re search is to

Glaucoma represents a group of related diseases frequently associated with elevated IOP. When 
left untreated, glaucoma can lead to retinal ganglion cell death and optic nerve  damage, resulting 
in progressive and irreversible loss of vision. Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness 
worldwide . In 2013, the global prevalence of glaucoma for population aged 40 to 80 years was 
3.54%. The number of people (aged 40 to 80 years) with glaucoma worldwide was estimated to 
be 64.3 million, increasing to 76.0 million in 2020 and 111.8 million in 2040  (Tham et al., 2014 ). 
It affects one in two hundred people aged fifty or younger and one in ten over the age of eighty 
(Resnikoff et al., 2004 ). Similarly in Japan, glaucoma is the first leading cause of blindness and 
it’s prevalence is 5.0% (POAG 3.9%, PACG 0.6%, secondary glaucoma 0.5%) and OHT 0.8% in 
population over the age of forty (Iwase et al., 2004 ; Yamamoto et al., 2005 ). 
Although currently there is no cure for  open -angle glaucoma ( OAG), results from multiple 
studies, including the Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study (AGIS) (AGIS_Investigators, 
2000 ), the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) (Kass et al., 2002 ), and the Early 
Manifest Glaucoma Trial (EMGT) (Leske et al., 2003 ), and Uni ted Kingdom Glaucoma 
Treatment Study ([LOCATION_006]GTS) (Garway -Heath et al., 2015 ) have demonstrated that treating elevated 
IOP with topi[INVESTIGATOR_594487]. The lowering of IOP is currently the only method for re ducing the risk of 
glaucomatous visual field loss and remains the primary goal of therapy.  
Several classes of ocular hypotensive medications exist today and are differentiated by [CONTACT_594521]/molecular level. These include miot ics, β -adrenergic receptor 
antagonists (β -blockers), CAIs, -adrenergic receptor agonists ( -agonists), and prostaglandin 
analogues (PGAs). The pharmacodynamic effect of these medications can differ substantially, as 
some affect aqueous humor production (β -blockers, -agonists, and CAIs) while others affect the 
outflow pathway (miotics, PGs, and -agonists). In general, PGAs are recommended as the first 
choice agent for most eyes with OHT  and OAG . However as disease progresses and maintaining 
target IOP bec omes difficult, more than one drug is needed to achieve optimum benefit and reach 
target IOP. Surgical interventions, including laser surgery, shunting of aqueous humor to an 
appropriate locale,  and filtering surgery,  are available options for treating insufficiently 
controlled IOP. In such instances pharmacotherapy may be continued as well.  
While adequate IOP -lowering can be achieved by [CONTACT_594522][INVESTIGATOR_594488], not all patients are adequ ately treated and additional IOP -lowering may provide for 
further slowing of disease progression. In some patients , treatment with a single IOP -lowering 
compound is not sufficient to obtain optimal IOP control. Adjunctive or combination therapy 
using diffe rent classes of drugs is often employed in order to achieve additional IOP -lowering 
effects. Moreover, consistent lowering of IOP over a 24 hour period has not yet been fully 
realized. If achieved, this could also contribute to slowing of disease progressi on. Therefore, new 
pharmacologic agents with new mechanism of action are needed.  
Santen has develop ed an ophthalmic topi[INVESTIGATOR_594489] (UR -7385) for 
the reduction of elevated IOP in patients with OHT  or OAG . DE-[ADDRESS_784260] of 
prostaglandin E2 (PGE 2) receptor, subtype 2 (EP2). PGE 2 has been shown to markedly reduce 
IOP when applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_594490] (Bito, 2001 ). PGE 2, its analogues and 
Protocol [ADDRESS_784261] (Yamaji et al., 2005 ). 
Very recently, Fuwa et al.,  demonstrated that DE -117 lowers the IOP through a novel 
meachnism of action : that is, th rough both conventional and uveoscleral outflows  (Fuwa et al., 
2017 ).Currently approved IOP - lowering medications such as latanoprost ( latanoprost 
ophthalmic solution, 0.005%; NDA 20 -597) lower IOP by [CONTACT_594523], 
but do so through effects on a receptor for PGF 2α. Unlike latanoprost and other approved 
prostaglandin F receptor (FP) agonists that are synthetic prostanoid analogues, DE -117 is a non -
prostanoid chemical compound.  
To date, Santen ha s completed seven clinical studies including t hree clinical studies ( 33-001,  
33-002, 33 -003) in the U.S. and four clinical studies ( 01171502 , 01171503 , 01171504 , 
01171506 ) in Japan  with DE -117 in healthy adult subjects, or subj ects with OAG or OHT to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety  of DE -117. DE-117 ophthalmic solution  0.002% appeared to be  
well tolerated and eff icacious in IOP lowering. As a result, it was chosen to advance into the 
phase III clinical development program in the US.  
Additional information on DE-117 ophthalmic solution , including the results of nonclinical and 
clinical  studies can be found in  the Investigator’s Brochure.  
The proposed study is an open -label , multi -center  study. The total duration of this study is 13 
months. The objective is to  investigat e the efficacy and safety  of DE-117 ophthalmic solution  
0.002%  in latanoprost low/non-responder  subjects diagnosed with POAG or OHT .

 Alpha/beta agonists: 14 days 
 Alpha antagonists ( α1 blocker ): 28 days 
 Beta antagonists (β blocker, including αβ blockers ): 28 days 
 Prostaglandins Analogs (PGA): 28 days 
 Rho kinase inhibitor: 28 days 
 Combination drugs: The longest washout period of the individual component will be 
used.

Protocol 0117 11IN, Spectrum 5 Study  DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 27 of 94 During the required washout period,  subjects who discontinue their current treatment, may, if the 
investigator deems it necessary, be treated wi th a short -acting IOP lowering agent, topi[INVESTIGATOR_594482] ( CAI), e.g., brinzolamide or dorzolamide eye drops, one drop 
twice daily. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_594491] 1 week before Visit 2 (Week -8, 
start of the Run -in Per iod). An interim safety visit may be performed during the washout period  
Visit 1a  (optional, mid-washout visit) if, in  the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], a subject’s IOP may be of 
concern.   If subjects are treated with a topi[INVESTIGATOR_492701], Visit 1a (optional, 
mid-washout visit ) is recommended to be performed.  
Subjects who have not used an IOP -lowering medication for the last 28 days,  will need a wait 
period of ≥ 1 day before their Visit 2 ( Week -8, start of the Run -in Period ). 
At Visit 2 ( Week -8, start of the Run -in Period ), continuing eligibility will be determined based 
on non -treated IOP :  
 IOP ≥[ADDRESS_784262] one eye and ≤[ADDRESS_784263] ophthalmic solution 0.005%  every evening  at 20:00  (±60min)  in 
both eyes.  
Visit [ADDRESS_784264] at Week -4 (midpoint  of the Run -in Period ), to check the following IOP 
criteria :  
 The same eye meeting criteria at Visit 2 (Week -8, start of the Run -in Period), must 
meet the following criteria: p ercent decrease of IOP from Visit 2  (Week -8, start of 
the Run -in Period)  of  ≤ 25% at all measurement time points  
 Visit 3 8:00  IOP should be  compared with Visit 2 8:00  IOP;  
 Visit 3 12:00 IOP should be compared with Visit 2 12:00 IOP;  
 Visit 3 16:00 IOP should be compared with Visit 2 16:00 IOP.   
 IOP in both eyes  of  ≤ 34 mmHg at all measurement time points  
Subjects who are qualif ied at Visit 3  (Week -4, midpoint  of the Run -in Period) , will 
complete the remainder  of the [ADDRESS_784265] ophthalmic solution 0.005%  QD at 20:00  (±60min)  in both eyes .  
Visit 4 ( Baseline , Day 1) will take pla ce at the end of the Run-in Period  and is considered the 
baseline for the analyses. The following criteria have to be met to initiate  the Treatment Period 
with DE -117 ophthalmic solution 0.002% : 
 The same  eye meeting  criteria at Visit 3 (Week -4, midpoint of the Run -in Period) 
must meet the  following criteria: percent decrease of IOP from Visit 2 ( Week -8, start 
of the Run -in Period ) of ≤ 15% at all measurement time points  
o Visit  4 8:00 IOP should be compared with Visit 2 8:00 IOP; 
o Visit 4 12:00 IOP should be compared with Visit 2 12:00 IOP; 
o Visit 4 16:00 IOP should be compared with Visit 2 16:00 IOP.   
 IOP in both eyes of ≤ 34 mmHg at all measurement time points  
Protocol 0117 11IN, Spectrum 5 Study  DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 28 of 94 Subjects who are qualified at Visit 4  (Baseline, Day 1) , will be enrolled into study and begin  the 
3-month  Treatment Period , dosing with one  drop of DE-117 ophthalmic solution 0.002% every 
evening at 20:00  (±60min)  in both eyes . Follow -up visits will be scheduled at Week 2 (Visit 5), 
Week 6 (Visit 6) and Month 3  (Visit 7) . 
IOP will be measured at 8:00, 12:00 and 16:00 (± 60 min)  at all visits except at  Visit 1 
(Screening ) and Visit 1a  (optional, mid-washout visit)  when one measurement at any time may 
suffice . The study eye will be the eye that qualifies per eligibility criteria through  Visit 4 
(Baseline, Day 1). If both eyes meet the eligibility criteria, the eye with the higher diurnal IOP 
(calculated as the average of IOP measurements at 3 time points ) at the end of the Run-in Period 
(Visit 4) will be designated as the study eye. If both eyes meet the eligibility criteria and have the 
same mean diurnal IOP, the right eye will be designated as the study eye.  
At the scheduled visits, query of AEs, BCVA  and slit lamp biomicroscopy will be performed 
before the first IOP measuremen t. Ophthalmoscopy (fundus examination) will be  performed after 
the last IOP measurement for the day. Additional  procedures are explained in Section  7.4. 
Pharmacogenomics/genomics : 
Subjects who consent to the optional pharmacogenomics/genomics laboratory study will provide 
a blood sample for future testing  after subject is enrolled and  study  drug, DE-117 ophthalmic 
solution 0.002% , dosing has begun . The purpose of this exploratory research is to identify

Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 50 of 94 12. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
12.1. Adverse Events  and Serious Adverse Events  
12.1.1.  Definition of Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject. An AE 
does not ne cessarily have a causal relationship with the study medication . For this study, the 
investigational products are DE -[ADDRESS_784298] . Regardless of relationship to the study 
medication , an AE can be a clinically relevant unintended  sign (including an ab normal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease.   
Any significant change in a subject’s condition from the time that written informed consent  is 
obtained , regardless of causality, is to be considered an AE. A clinically significant worsening  in 
severity, intensity, or frequency of a pre -existing condition may indicate an AE.  
An elective surgical procedure scheduled or planned prior to study entry that does not require an 
overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_492715], and the underlying di agnosis for the procedure  
should be captured in the medical history as a pre -existing condition. The surgical procedure 
should also include the term “elective” in all reports. An elective or planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_594496] a  serious adverse eve nt (SAE ). 
The lack of efficacy of the study medication  for the condition being investigated is not 
considered an AE unless a clinically significant change is assessed by [CONTACT_737].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Assessment of Adverse Events  
Investigators will seek information on AEs at each subject contact. Subjects should be asked 
using a general, non -direct question if there has been any change in their general health. Direct 
questioning and examination should then be performed as appropriate.  
Severity of the AE should be assess ed according to the following criteria:  
Mild:  No interference with the subject’s daily activities; no medical intervention/therapy 
required.  
Moderate:  Possible interference with the subject’s daily activities; no or minimal 
medical intervention/therapy req uired.  
Severe:  Considerable interference with the subject’s daily activities; medical 
intervention/therapy required.  
Regardless of severity, some events may also meet regulatory serious criteria. Refer to 
definitions and reporting of serious adverse events  (SAEs) in Section  12.1.[ADDRESS_784299] make the determination of relationship (related 
or not related) to the inv estigational product for each AE or SAE. When determining relationship 
to study medication, the Investigator will consider any investigational products that a subject 
could be exposed to in this clinical trial. The Investigator should decide whether there is a 
reasonable possibility that the study medication caused the event, taking into account the 
following: a) evidence b) science -based rationale c) medical and clinical judgment d) 
Protocol 0117 11IN, Spectrum 5 Study  DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 51 of 94 mechanisms of action e) biologic plausibility f) confounding risk factors (i.e., medical history, 
concomitant medications) g) temporal relationship h) dechallenge/rechallenge and i) lack of 
alternative explanation.  
 The event may be recorded as Related  to investigational product if:  
 There is a plausible temporal relationship betw een the onset of the AE and 
administration of the study medication  
 The AE abates or resolves upon discontinuation of the study medication or dose 
reduction and, if  applicable, reappears  upon rechallenge  
 The AE cannot be readily explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state, intercurrent 
illness, or concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
 The AE follows a known pattern of response to the investigational product  
 Reporting the event as Not Related  to study medication may be cons idered if:  
 There is good evidence that the AE has an etiology other than the investigational 
product (e.g., pre -existing medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent 
illness, or concomitant medication)  
 The AE has no plausible temporal relationship t o administration of the 
investigational product (e.g., cancer diagnosed [ADDRESS_784300] dose of study 
medication)  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Reporting Adverse Events  
AEs, whether spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_150041], will 
be recorded in th e subject’s medical record and on the appropriate AE electronic case report 
form (eCRF). Each recorded AE will be described by [CONTACT_13662] (represented in dates), affected 
eye(s) (if applicable), maximum severity of the AE, seriousness criteria, suspected  relationship to 
the study medication, actions taken with the study medication and the study participation, 
outcome of the AE, and any other attributable causes of the AE.  
Regardless of relationship to the clinical study, AEs that occur at any time after t he subject has 
provided written informed consent until subject withdrawal or the scheduled exit visit , must be 
recorded. To improve the quality and precision of acquired AE data, Investigators should 
observe the following guidelines:  
 Whenever possible, use  recognized medical terms when recording.  Do not use 
colloquialisms and/or abbreviations.  
 If known, record the diagnosis (i.e., disease or syndrome) rather than component 
signs and symptoms and /or laboratory or test findings (e.g., record congestive hear t 
failure rather than dyspnea, rales, and cyanosis, and enlarged heart on chest x -ray). 
However, other events that are considered unrelated to an encountered syndrome or 
disease should be recorded as individual AEs (e.g., if congestive heart failure and 
severe headache are observed at the same time and are clinically unrelated, each event 
should be recorded as an individual AE).  
Protocol 0117 11IN, Spectrum 5 Study  DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 52 of 94  If the diagnosis is not known, then record the leading component sign, symptom or 
test finding and describe the other clinically r elated findings in the narrative 
description of the case. A suspected diagnosis can be used and described as such (e.g., 
record suspected or probable myocardial infarction); this has to be updated in the 
clinical database once the diagnosis is confirmed.  
AEs occurring secondary to other events (e.g., sequelae) should be identified by [CONTACT_443077]. A primary AE, if clearly identifiable, generally represents the most 
accurate clinical term.  If a primary AE is recorded, events occurring secondary to the  
primary event should be described in the narrative description of the case. For 
example:  
The subject developed orthostatic hypotension and subsequently fainted and fell to 
the floor wherein she experienced a head trauma and neck pain.  
The primary AE in th is example is orthostatic hypotension. The fall, head trauma and 
neck pain should be described in the narrative description of the case.  
 For intermittent events (e.g., intermittent headache), the event onset date should be 
recorded as the date the subject  first started to experience the event and resolution  
date should reflect when the last occurrence resolved or stopped.  Separate AEs for 
each event should not be recorded. For example, if a subject experienced headache on 
14SEP2015 lasting for three hours , then subsequently experienced intermittent 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_375014] 3 hours until 21 SEP2015, then the 
AE date of onset is 14 SEP2015 and the resolution date is 21 SEP2015.  
 For intermittent events , record the maximum severity of the individual events.  For 
example, if a subject complains of intermittent headaches for one week and the 
severity of each headache ranges from mild to moderate, then the severity would be 
moderate . 
 For intermittent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_375015] a primary AE  (e.g., in a subject with 
multiple sclerosis, commonly known for its relapsing and remitting course, in some 
cases leading to multiple hospi[INVESTIGATOR_375016]), the subsequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_492717].  
 If treatment was initiated, include the treatment and duration of the medication(s) in 
the eCRF.  
12.1.2.  Serious Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Assessment of Serious Adverse Events  
An AE is considered serious if it fulfills one or more of the following criteria:  
 Death (i.e., the AE caused or led to death).  
 It was life threatening (i.e., immediately life -threatening).  
 It required or prolonged inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
 It resulted in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE resulted in a 
substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to carry out normal life functions).  
Protocol 0117 11IN, Spectrum 5 Study  DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 53 of 94  It resulted in a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject who 
was exposed to study therapy prior to conception or during pregnancy.  
 It is a medically significant event (s), which may include “sight -threatening events,” 
that may not meet any of the above serious criteria but may jeopardize the subject or 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
The SAE eCRF must be completed with as much information as is available within 24 hours of 
knowledge of the event . 
To improve the quality and precision of acquired SAE data, Investigators should observe the 
following guidelines:  
 Death: Death is an outcome of an event. The event that resulted in the death should be 
recorded and reported as the SAE.  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_163016]: The illness leading to the 
surgical or diagnostic procedure should be recorded as the SAE, not the procedu re 
itself. The procedure should be captured in the case narrative as part of the action 
taken in response to the illness.  
Depending on the nature and seriousness of the AE, Santen may request additional 
documentation, for example, copi[INVESTIGATOR_492718]. If the subject was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], a copy of the discharge summary may be 
requested.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Expedited Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Santen (or designee) will provide the Principal Investigator [CONTACT_4490] a  reporting cover letter and a 
masked expedited safety report for expedited reporting of SAEs to the IRB or IEC. The Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_375018], submitting 
expedited safety reports to the IRB o r IEC, and maintaining copi[INVESTIGATOR_594497].  
12.1.3.  Events of Special Interest  
The following are considered events of special interests ( ESIs ) and should be reported on the 
appropriate eCRF with as much information as available within 24 hours of knowledge of the 
event:  
 Pregnancy:  
 There are no controlled data with the investigational product in human pregnancy. 
It is required that females of childbearing potential use effective contraception 
during the study  and recommended for [ADDRESS_784301] should be followed until the end of pregnancy or until the end of the 
study, whichever is longer.   
Protocol 0117 11IN, Spectrum 5 Study  DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 54 of 94  Medication administration errors  
 Study medication  administration errors determined to be significant by [CONTACT_594527]. Examples of study medication  
administration errors may include, but are not limited to: incorrect dose of study 
medication  and administration of study medication  from an incorrect kit. An AE 
does not necessarily need to have occurred to count as a study medication 
administration error. A medication administration error is an unintended failure in 
the process of treatment with a medicinal product that leads to, or has the 
potential to lead to harm of the subject.  
 Macular edema (including cystoid macular edema):  
 Macular edema has been reported in some patients during the DE -117 clinical 
trials. Any cases of macular edema (including cystoid macular edema ) should be 
reported in the ESI fo rm in eC RF, or in case the  electronic data capture ( EDC ) 
system is down, in the manual ESI form. Any cases of macular edema (including 
cystoid macular edema ) will need to be followed until the event is determined to 
be resolved, irreversible, chronic, stable, the subject withdraws consent, or no 
further information can be reasonably obtained as per Section  12.1.[ADDRESS_784302]’s participation in the 
study ends. Subjects with the following types of events should be followed by [CONTACT_594528], irreversible, chronic, stable, the  subject withdraws 
consent, or no further information can be reasonably obtained.  
 On-going SAEs  issued after study medication  treatment  
 On-going ESIs, including pregnancy, medication errors resulting in AE’s, and 
macular edema/cystoid macular edema issued  after study medication  treatment

Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 57 of 94 14. STATISTICAL METHODS  
This section outlines topi[INVESTIGATOR_492721]. A more detailed description of all the analyses and methods is provided in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
14.1. Interim Analysis  
There is no planned  interim an alysis for this study.  
14.2. Final Analysis  
The final analysis will be performed after all subjects completed  Month  3 (Visit  7). The  analysis 
will evaluate the  efficacy and safety of DE -117 ophthalmic solution 0.002% once daily in 
latanoprost low/non-responder s.  
14.3. General Considerations  
Descriptive statistics, unless otherwise noted, will include the number of subjects ( n), mean, 
standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum for continuous variables and frequency and 
percent age for categorical variables.  
The study eye will be defined as the eye that qualifies per eligibility  criteria at Baseline ( Visit 4). 
If both eyes qualify, the eye with the higher mean diurnal IOP at baseline  will be the study eye. 
If both eyes have the same mea n diurnal IOP at baseline, then the right eye will be designated as 
the study eye.  
The s tatistical testing will be conducted at a significance level of 0.05 (two-sided) and the 95% 
confidence  interval will be shown, unless specified otherwise .  No statistical testing will  be 
conducted for safety  measures.  
More details on the statistical methods will be described in  the SAP. 
14.3.1.  Sample Size  
Using one sample t -test with a significance level of 5%, a sample size of [ADDRESS_784304] 90% 
power to detect a mean diurnal IOP reduction  of 1.0mmHg  from baseline with a standard 
deviation of  3.5 mmHg, after taking into account of up to 12% dropouts.  
14.3.2.  Statistical Hypotheses and Level of Significance  
The primary endpoint  (the mean diurnal IOP change from baseline at Month  3) will be evaluated  
according to the following testing hypotheses:  
H0: µi = µj  
versus  
H1: µi ≠ µj  
where µi and µj  are the mean diurnal IOP at Baseline and Month 3, respectively.    
Protocol [ADDRESS_784305] will be used to compare the difference  in diurnal IOP between  Baseline (Visit 4) and 
Month 3 (Visit 7).  The mean  difference in diurnal IOP will be reported along with 95% 
confidence intervals.   
14.4. Study Populations  
14.4.1.  Safety Population  
The Safety Population will include all subjects who signed informed consent , met the eligibility 
criteria at baseline , and received at least one dose of the study medication. The safety analysis 
will be performed on the Safety Population.  
14.4.2.  Full Analysis Set  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will include all Safety population who had at leas t one post -baseline 
IOP measurement. The efficacy analysis will be performed on the FAS or a subset of the FAS.  
14.4.3.  Per-Protocol Set 
The Per -Protocol Set (PPS) is a subset of the FAS, restricted to the subjects who fulfill the 
protocol in the terms of the eligibility, interventions, and outcome assessment. It will be the 
analysis population for some sensitivity analyses.  More details will be provided in the SAP.  
14.5. Handling of Missing Values  
The primary analysis of IOP will be based on observed cases. As a se nsitivity analysis, missing 
IOP data at Month [ADDRESS_784306] version of Medical Dictio nary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA ). Subjects with any concurrent diseases will be tabulated by [CONTACT_594529] (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT)  specified in the MedDRA.

Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 59 of 94 14.7. Efficacy Analyses  
14.7.1.  Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in mean diurnal IOP at Month 3  (Visit 7) .  
The primary analysis will be performed on the FAS. Paired t -test will be used to compare the difference 
in diurnal IOP between  Baseline ( Visit 4 ) and Month 3  (Visit 7 ). The mean difference in diurnal IOP will 
be reported a long with the 95% confidence intervals.    
14.7.2.  Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The following secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed:  
 Percent change from baseline in mean diurnal IOP at Month 3 (Visit 7)  
 Change and percent change from baseline  (Visit 4)  in mean diurnal IOP at Week 2  
(Visit  5) and 6  (Visit 6)  
 Change and percent change from baseline in IOP for each post -baseline 
timepoint/visit  
 Having a mean diurnal IOP reduction ≥ 10%, ≥ 15%, ≥ 20%, ≥ 25%, or ≥ 30% from 
baseline  (Visit 4)  at Month 3 (Visit 7)  
 Having a mean diurnal IOP ≤ 18 mmHg at Month 3  (Visit 7)  
For change and percent change in mean diurnal IOP from baseline, d escriptive statistics  will be 
provided  includ ing the number of subjects ( n), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum  and 
maximum . For binary secondary efficacy endpoint s, results will be tabulated using frequenc ies 
and percent ages. 
14.8. Safety Analyses  
All safety outcome measures will be summarized descriptively for the Safety Population. The 
safety outcome measures include AEs,  BCVA , slit-lamp biomicroscopy  findings, 
ophthalmoscopy variables , and iris color, eyelash, eyelid . 
AEs will be coded using the latest version of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). Subjects with any AEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_594530]. Similarly, subjects with any ocular and non -ocular AEs will be tab ulated separately. 
AEs, ocular and non -ocular will also be summarized by [CONTACT_594531]. In addition, SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuations will be summarized.  More 
details will be provided in  the SAP.

Protocol 0117 11IN, Spectrum 5 Study  DE-117 Ophthalmic Solution  
Version 1.0 18JULY2018  Confidential  Page 76 of 94 using visual acuity chart (ETDRS chart) and the logMAR scoring will be recorded in the 
subject’s source document. If ETDRS chart is used, the following procedure should be followed.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  ETDRS Visual Acuity Scoring  
The Examiner  records each letter identified correctly by [CONTACT_492793]. The Examiner  records a letter read incorrectly, or a letter for 
which the subject made no guess, by [CONTACT_594538] “x” or a line. Each letter read 
incorrectly is scored as one point. The last line in which a letter is read correctly will be taken as 
the Base logMAR line.  
The total number of letters that have an “x” or a line through them (letters read incorrectly or not 
at all) down to and including the Base logMAR line, and multiply the total number by 0.02. Add 
this value to the Base logMAR value to obtain the logMAR score.  
Example:  
Subject correctly reads 4 of  5 letters on the +0.2 line, and 2 of 5 letters on the +0.1 line, and 
zero letters on the 0.0 line  
Base logMAR value = +0.1 (last line in which a letter was read correctly)  
Total number of letters missed = 4 (number of letters missed on the +0.2 line plus the number 
missed on the +0.1 line)  
LogMAR score = +0.1 + (4 x 0.02) = 0.18

21.3.7.  Intraocular Pressure  
IOP will be performed at each visit. At Visit 1  (Screening) and Visit 1a (optional, mid-washout 
visit) , IOP can be measured at any time. For Visit 2  to Visit 7 Study E xit/Early Termination, IOP 
measu rements will be scheduled for 0 8:00 (±60min ), 12:00 (±60min ) and 1 6:00 (±60min ). 
IOP will be measured using calibrated manual Goldmann applanation tonometer. Measurement 
will be performed preferably by [CONTACT_49238]  (operator) and the same authorized study 
staff member  (recorder) throughout the study.  Investigator (operator) who perform s the IOP 
measurement  must have  at least [ADDRESS_784319]’s source document.  
A single measurement is made as follows:  
 The Investigat or adjusts the force on the tonometer dial to an initial setting 
corresponding to 10 mmHg. The slit-lamp  magnification is set at 10X. The light 
source is positioned at an angle of approximately 45º, and the aperture is maximally 
opened. A cobalt blue filte r is employed.  
 After instillation of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_15413], a fluorescein paper strip is placed near the 
lateral canthus in the lower conjunctival sac. Once the lacrimal fluid is sufficiently 
colored, the paper strip is removed. Alternatively, one drop of p remixed fluorescein 
and anesthetic (Fluress, Barnes Hind) may be instilled. The Investigator should use 
the same technique each time, be it a paper strip or a pre -mixed eye drop.  
 The subject and slit-lamp  are adjusted so that the subject’s head is firmly p ositioned 
on the chin rest and against the forehead rest without leaning forward or straining. 
Protocol [ADDRESS_784320] is cautioned not to hold his breath.  
 The Investigator looks through the slit-lamp  and gently brings the tip of the prism into 
contact [CONTACT_492799]. The mires are well -focused, centered 
horizontally, and positioned vertically so that they are of equal circumference above 
and below the horizontal dividing line. If the mi res are narrower than approximately 
1/10 their diameter, additional fluorescein is instilled.  
 The Investigator adjusts the measuring drum until the inner borders of the two mires 
just touch each other or, if pulsation is present, until the mires separate a  given 
distance during systole and overlap the same distance during diastole.  
 The Investigator  removes the tip from the cornea, and the authorized study staff 
(recorder) records the reading on the dial, rounded to the next highest integer. For 
example, if the measurement indicated is between [ADDRESS_784321]’s source document.  
 The Investigator  may also be the recorder instead of an authorized study staff  
member, if a study staff member was not assigned.  
 If cor neal astigmatism is greater than 3.[ADDRESS_784322]’s source document.  
 If the two measurements differ by [CONTACT_21316] 3 mmHg, then the average of the two 
measurements becomes the recorded IOP. For example, if the two measurements are 
22 and 23, then 22.5 is the final recorded IOP.  
 How ever, if the two measurements differ by [ADDRESS_784323] 
measurement is made, and the median of the three measurements becomes the 
recorded IOP (the median is the middle measurement after ordering the 
measurements from low to high). For example , if the three measurements are 15, 19, 
and 16, then 16 is the final recorded IOP.  
The IOP in the left eye is then measured using the same technique.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Goldmann Applanation Tonometer Calibration  
It is mandatory for e very tonometer  used in the study  to be cal ibrated for accuracy before the 
first subject undergoes screening . Thereafter, the calibration must be checked monthly  until the 
last subject has exited the study. For calibration  checks, t he manufacturer’s instructions  should 
be followed . If the variation is within ±2 mmHg, the tonometer is considered adequately 
calibrated. However, if the variation exceeds this amount, the tonometer should be sent for repair 
and a different, adequately calibrated instrument should be used for IOP measure ment. The date 
of each calibration, along with the name [CONTACT_120254] (or initials) of the person who performed 
Protocol [ADDRESS_784324].  
21.3.8.  Pachymetry (C entral Cornea l Thickness ) 
The central corneal thickness (µm) of each eye using any pachymeter  including optical 
pachymeter, ultrasound pachymeter, OCT  (optical coherence tomography ) etc. will be measured  
and record ed after IOP measurement at Visit 1 (Screening) . Pachym etry should be performed 
after IOP measurement . The same pachymeter should be used during the course of the study.  
21.3.9.  Gonioscopy  
Gonioscopy will be performed to examine the angle of the anterior chamber after IOP 
measurement at Visit 1 (Screening), if it has not been performed within 3 months  (90 days) . The 
Shaffer scale will be used to rate the degree of angle closure.  
(0) = approximately 5 degrees or less, complete or partial closure  
(1) = approximately 10 degrees  
(2) = approximately 20 degrees  
(3) = approximately 30 degrees  
(4) = approximately 40 degrees or more  
21.3.10.  Visual Field  
Visual field examinations will be performed using a static or dynamic perimeter (Humphrey or 
Octopus) without pupil dilation  at Visit 1 (Screening), if this has not been performed  within 3 
months  (90 days)  or the previous visual field test(s) indicates low subject reliability (e.g., due to 
fixation losses, false positive errors, or false negative errors). Glaucomatous visual field loss will 
be evaluated by [CONTACT_594540] (mean deviation, pattern SD, glaucoma 
hemifield test, and type of glaucomatous visual field loss).  
Visual field tests that, in the Investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], indicate low subject reliability (e.g., due to 
fixation losses, false positive errors,  or false negative errors) should be excluded. A copy of the 
computer printout from the visual field test(s) will be attached to the subject’s source documents.  
21.3.11.  Ophthalmoscopy (Fundus) Examination  
The ophthalmoscopy (fundus) examination will be performed f or each eye at Visit 1  (Screening) , 
Visit 4 (Baseline, Day 1) , and Visit 7 Study Exit/Early Termination, and graded as described 
below. Ophthalmoscopy will be performed under dilation  at Visit 1 (Screening) and Visit 7 
Study Exit/Early Termination. P upil dilation must be p erform ed after all other ocular procedures 
have been completed.  Cup to disc ratio and abnormality in retina, macula, choroid, and vitreous 
will also be evaluated.  
Glaucomatous Optic Nerve Findings  
The optic nerve will be evaluated using a 4-point scale (0 -3 scale).  
None  (0) =  No damage

younger patients.  
10 OVERDOSAGE  
Intravenous infusion of up to 3 mcg/kg in healthy volunteers produced mean plasma 
concentrations 200 times higher than during clinical treatment and no adverse reactions w ere 
observed. Intravenous dosages of 5.5 to 10 mcg/kg caused abdominal pain, dizziness, fatigue, hot 
flushes, nausea, and sweating.  
If overdosage with latanoprost ophthalmic solution occurs, treatment should be symptomatic.  
[ADDRESS_784342] is a prostaglandin F 2α analogue. Its chemical name [CONTACT_386138] -(Z)-
7[(1R,2R,3R,5S)3,5 -dihydroxy -2-[(3R) -3-hydroxy -5-phenylpentyl]cyclopentyl] -5-heptenoate. 
Its molecular formula is C 26H40O5 and its chemical structure is:  
Protocol [ADDRESS_784343] ophthalmic solution 0.005% is supplied as a sterile, isoto nic, buffered aqueous 
solution of latanoprost with a pH of approximately 6.7 and an osmolality of approximately 267 
mOsmol/kg. Each mL of latanoprost ophthalmic solution contains [ADDRESS_784344]. 
Benzalkonium chloride, 0.02% is added as a preservativ e. The inactive ingredients are: sodium 
chloride, sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate, disodium hydrogen phosphate anhydrous, 
and water for injection. One drop contains approximately 1.[ADDRESS_784345] that is believed to reduce the intraocular 
pressure (IOP) by [CONTACT_386131]. Studies in animals and man suggest 
that the main mechanism of action is increased uveoscler al outflow. Elevated IOP represents a 
major risk factor for glaucomatous field loss. The higher the level of IOP, the greater the 
likelihood of optic nerve damage and visual field loss.  
12.2 Pharmacodynamics  
Reduction of the IOP in man starts about 3 –[ADDRESS_784346] is 
reached after 8 –[ADDRESS_784347] is absorbed through the cornea where the isopropyl ester prodrug is hydrolyzed to 
the acid form to become biologically active.  
Distribution  
The distribution volume in humans is 0.16 ± 0.02 L/kg. The acid of latanoprost can be measured 
in aqueous humor during the first [ADDRESS_784348] from human plasma is r apid (t 1/2 = 17 min) after both 
intravenous and topi[INVESTIGATOR_78086]. Systemic clearance is approximately 7 mL/min/kg. 
Following hepatic β -oxidation, the metabolites are mainly eliminated via the kidneys. 
Approximately 88% and 98% of the administered dos e are recovered in the urine after topi[INVESTIGATOR_594515], respectively.  
[ADDRESS_784349] was not carcinogenic in either mice or rats when administered by [CONTACT_594543] 170 mcg/kg/day (approximately 2800 times the recommended maximum human 
dose) for up to [ADDRESS_784350] on male or female fertility in animal studies.

16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING  
Latanoprost ophthalmic solution is a clear, isotonic, buffered, preserved colorless solution of 
latanoprost 0.005% (50 mcg/mL). It is sup plied as a 2.5 mL solution in a 5 mL clear low density 
polyethylene bottle with a clear polyethylene dropper tip, a turquoise high density polyethylene 
screw cap, and a tamper -evident clear low density polyethylene overcap.  
2.5 mL fill, 0.005% (50 mcg/mL):  Package of 1 bottle: NDC [ZIP_CODE] -0333 -2 
Storage: Protect from light. Store unopened bottle(s) under refrigeration at 2° to 8°C (36° to 
46°F). During shipment to the patient, the bottle may be maintained at temperatures up to 40°C 
(104°F) for a period not ex ceeding 8 days. Once a bottle is opened for use, it may be stored at 
room temperature up to 25°C (77°F) for [ADDRESS_784353] ophthalmic solution [see Warnings and 
Precautions (5.1)] . 
Potential for Eyelash Changes  
Inform patients of the possibility of eyelash and vellus hair changes in the treated eye during 
treatment with latanoprost ophthalmic solution. These changes may result in a disparity between 
eyes in length, thickness, pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], number of eyelashes or vellus hairs, and/or direction of 
eyelash growth. Eyelash changes are usually reversible upon discontinuation of treatment.  
Handling the Container  
Instruct patients to avoid allowing the tip of  the dispensing container to contact [CONTACT_594544]. Serious damage to the eye and subsequent loss of 
vision may result from usin g contaminated solutions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. 
When to Seek Physician Advice  
Advise patients that if they develop an intercurrent ocular condition (e.g., trauma or infection) or 
have ocular surgery, or develop any ocular reactions, particul arly conjunctivitis and eyelid 
reactions, they should immediately seek their physician's advice concerning the continued use of 
the multiple -dose container.

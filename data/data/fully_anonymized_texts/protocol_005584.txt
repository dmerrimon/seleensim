Background and scientific rationale   
 
Beyond supportive care, t here are currently no proven treatment options for coronavirus 
disease (COVID -19), the infection caused by [CONTACT_129721][INVESTIGATOR_98189] 2 (SARS -CoV-2). Human convalescent plasma is an option for treatment of 
COVID -[ADDRESS_901760] recovered from infectious disease.   
 Passive antibody therapy has a storied history going back to the 1890s and was the only means of treating certain infectious diseases prior to the development of antimicrobial therapy in the 1940s (1,2) . This strategy has been successfully used 
during SARS, MERS, influenza 1918, influenza A H1N1, and Ebola outbreaks, with demonstrable safety, eff icacy and decrease in mortality  as detailed below.  Experience 
from prior outbreaks with other coronaviruses, such as SARS -CoV-1 shows that such 
convalescent plasma contains  neutralizing antibodies to the relevant virus (3).  In the 
case of SARS- CoV-2, the anticipated mechanism of action by [CONTACT_667596]. However, other mechanisms may be possible, such as antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis. Conval escent serum was also used in the [ADDRESS_901761] 
treatment (4).   
 The only antibody type that is currently available for immediate use is that found in human convalescent plasma. As more individuals contract COVID -[ADDRESS_901762] that passive antibody works by [CONTACT_667597], which is likely to be much smaller than that of established disease. Another 
Version 20May2020  
Page 12 of 38  
 explanation is that antibody works by [CONTACT_228217], which is 
also easier during the initial immune response, which may be asymptomatic (5).  
 For passive antibody therapy to be effective, a sufficient amount of antibody must be administered. When given to a susceptible person, this antibody will circulate in the blood, reach tissues and provide protection against i nfection. Depending on the 
antibody amount and composition, the protection conferred by [CONTACT_667598].   In addition, administration of passive 
antibody therapy does not preclude a patient from receiving future monoclonal antibody 
therapy or vaccines which may be developed for COVID -19. 
 
Experience with the use of convalescent plasma  against coronavirus 
diseases  
 In the 21st century, there were two other epi[INVESTIGATOR_667576], SARS1 in [ADDRESS_901763] study involved the treatment of 80 patients in Hong Kong with 
SARS (7). Patients treated before day 14 had improved prognosis defined by [CONTACT_667599][INVESTIGATOR_129648] 22.   It is also possible that other types of non- neutralizing 
antibodies are made that contribute to protection and recovery as described for other viral diseases (11) .  
 
Among reports of seriously ill individuals treated with convalescent plasma, t hree 
patients with SARS in Taiwan were treated with 500 ml of convalescent plasma, 
resulting in a reduction in plasma virus titer and each survived (8). Three patients with 
MERS in South Korea were treated with convalescent  plasma , but only two of the 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_653100]  (9).  The latter study highlights a 
challenge in using convalescent plasma , namely, that some who recover from viral 
disease may not have high titers of neutralizing antibody  (10).  Strikingly, a recent 
report from China where 10 patients with severe COVID -19 received human 
convalescent plasma (SARS -CoV-2 convalescent plasma) on day 10 to 20 of 
illness demonstrated improvement in clinical, radiographic and laboratory 
parameters such that patients were discharged to home and suffered no severe 
adverse effects 
(https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20036145v1.full.pdf ).  These 
patients received plasma from donor blood collected from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_667577] 4 days after discharge.  The donors had to demonstrate criteria of recovery which were (a) normal temperature for at least 3 days; (b) resolution 
of respi[INVESTIGATOR_135275]; (c) 2 consecutively negative RT -PCR sputum results with 
one-day sampling interval.   This was followed by a report by a separate group in China 
in JAMA on March 27, 2020 showing that 5 critically ill patients, including one on extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support, who received low titer antibody serum with high virus neutralizing activity, were able to recover ( Shen C, Wang Z, Zhao 
F, et al. Treatment of 5 Critically Ill Patients With COVID -19 Wit h Convalescent Plasma. 
Version 20May2020  
Page 13 of 38  
 JAMA. Published online March 27, 2020. doi:10.1001/jama.2020.4783.   Although few 
details are available from the Chinese experience and published studies involved small 
numbers of patients, the available information suggests that conv alescent plasma 
administ ration reduces viral load and i s safe.  
 In these rapi[INVESTIGATOR_667578], several groups across the [LOCATION_002] have highlighted the importance of convalescent plasma in the anti -COVID -19 arsenal.  
These groups include National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 
(
https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/ 2020/statement -from-the-presidents -of-the-
nas-nae-and-nam-supporting -steps -necessary -to-assess- the-potential -for-human-
convalescent -plasma- to-help- control -covid -19) and the AABB American Association of 
Blood Banking (
http://www.aabb.org/advocacy/regulatorygovernment/Documents/COVID -19-
Convalescent -Plasma -Resources.pdf ).   
 In addition,  the AABB with FDA support is currently working to establish a “ master 
collection protocol under which blood centers would be able to quickly implement 
uniform practices  to expedite the availability” of convalescent plasma.  Because there 
are no currently available treatments for COVID -19, the FDA has approved the 
emergency investigational use of convalescent plasma to treat COVID -19 under t he 
criteria of the single patient emergency investigational new drug application (eIND)  
(https://www.fda.gov/media/136470/download ) (
https://www.fda.gov/vaccines -blood-
biologics/investi gational -new-drug-ind-or-device -exemption- ide-process -
cber/investigational -covid -19-convalescent -plasma- emergency -inds). 
 
Known potential risks  
The theoretical risk involves the phenomenon of antibody -mediated enhancement of 
infection (ADE). ADE can occur for several viral diseases and involves an enhancement 
of disease in the presence of certain antibodies. For coronaviruses, several mechanisms for ADE have been described and there is the theoretical concern that antibodies to one type of coronavirus could enhance infection to another viral strain 
(12). It may be possible to predict the risk of ADE of SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_901764] the 
same virus, SARS2 -CoV-2, ADE may be unlikely. The available evidence from the use 
of convalescent  plasma in patients with SARS1 and MERS (13)  and anecdotal evidence 
of its use in patients with COVID -19 (
http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-
02/28/c_138828177.htm , 
https://www.medrxiv.org/con tent/10.1101/2020.03.16.20036145v1.full.pdf ), suggest it is 
safe. However, because of these potential risks,  we are limiting administration of SARS -
CoV-[ADDRESS_901765], passive antibody administration before vaccination with 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_667579] (14).   If the concern proved real , these individuals could be vaccinated against COVID -
[ADDRESS_901766] c ompared to the possibility of limiting the duration and severity of disease, 
and avoiding interventions like mechanical ventilation, ARDS and sepsis.  
 
Finally, there are risks associated with any transfusion of plasma including transmission of transfusion transmi tted viruses (e.g. HIV, HBV, HCV, etc.), allergic transfusion 
reactions, anaphylaxis to transfusion, febrile transfusion reaction, transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI), and transfusion associated cardiac overload (TACO) .  
Infectious risks are minimized by [CONTACT_667600]-required infectious diseases as part of standard allogeneic donor blood collection.  
TRALI is mitigated by [CONTACT_667601], female donors who have never been pregnant, or previously pregnant women who are negative for HLA antibodies.  D onors 
will fulfill all donor requirements for whole blood donation.   The standard volume of 
plasma ( ~300 mL) will be transfused over a long er time period (4 hours)  and t he patient 
will be monitored for signs of overload.  
 
Known potential benefits  
 A key potential benefit is the potential treatment for established infection.  Convalescent 
plasma would be administered to those with clinical disease in an effort to reduce their 
symptoms and mortality. Based on the recent evidence from China with antibody 
administration, it can be anticipated that antibody administration in patients with severe 
COVID -[ADDRESS_901767] be conducted to assess 
individual variables.

• Subjects can terminate study participation and/or withdraw consent at any time 
without prejudice.  
• Subjects  who withdraw from the study will not be replaced.  
• The investigator may withdraw subjects if they are lost to follow up, non-
compliant with study procedures or if the investigator determines that continued participation in the study would be harmful to the subject or the integrity of the study data.  
• Discontinu ation of the study: The IRB has the right to terminate this study at any 
time 
Investigational plasma Treatment   
 
• Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] s ubjects will receive anti-SARS- CoV-2 convalescent plasma as a pi[INVESTIGATOR_667583].  
• Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_667584] -SARS- CoV-2 convalescent plasma under 
IRB20 -0825  
• Investigational Product : The investigational product is anti -SARS- CoV-2 
convalescent plasma obtained from donors  identified as  having recovered from 
COVID -19.  
• Donors  samples will have been screened for transfusion- transmitted infections 
(e.g. HIV, HBV, HCV, WNV, HTLV -I/II, T.cruzi , syphilis, ZIKV) both through the 
use of the UCM Blood Donation Center Blood Donation Record and FDA -
mandated blood donor screening tests.   Plasma  will have been  collected  as 
whole blood derived units  donations  and in accordance with standard FDA and 
blood bank protocols.   Plasma will be ABO -compatible and HLA -screened per 
standard FDA and blood bank protocols.  
• Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_667585] 1 unit of convalescent plasma after eIND approval .  
When CLIA clinical testing for antibody is available,  plasma will be transfused 
with an anti -SARS- CoV-2 titer of >1:320, though this titer may be adjusted as in 
vitro titer assays of virus neutralization are correlated with in vivo  assessments of 
virus neutralization.   
• Plasma will be labeled according to FDA and blood bank guidelines . 
Research biomarkers and other studies  
 During standard whole blood donation, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are 
collected by [CONTACT_667606].  This filter is normally discarded.  Instead of discarding this filter as per usual practice, the filter will be labeled with the donor 
identification number and will be given to Patrick Wilson’s laboratory for the isolation of 
B cells reactive to recombinant proteins from SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_901777] 
immunogenic, further guiding vac cine design efforts.    
 
Per FDA guidelines, convalescent serum  containing neutralizing antibody with a titer  
optimally greater than 1:320 should be used when antibody titer tests are available.  
Antibody testing is currently only available in research labs (Patrick Wilson at the University of Chicago).  When antibody testing is available in clinical labs, we will be 
able to use titer information to guide plasma transfusion, e.g. titer can be adjusted as in 
vitro titer assays of virus neutralization are correlated with in vivo  assessments of virus 
neutralization.  This will identify individuals who have anti -SARS- CoV-2 neutralizing 
antibody and identify the strength of the virus -neutralizing antibody in each titer  
concentration.   
 
 
Rationale for doses  
 The dose of  1 unit; ~300 mL was chosen to minimize volume given to a patient with 
compromised pulmonary function/acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], which fits the profile of COVID- 19 patients with severe disease.   
 
Investigational treatment -plasma administration 
 
• Plasma  will be administered after enrollment  and approval of single patient 
eIND by [CONTACT_667607]20- 0825  
• Infusion rate will be ~300 mL over 4 hours ( ~50 mL per hour)  
• Pretreatment to minimize transfusion reactions (e.g. acetami nophen,  
diphenhydramine) may be given  per investigator and clinical care team 
discretion.   
• If an AE develops during infusion, the infusion may be slowed or stopped as per investigator’s decision.  
o Most reactions to plasma are relatively minor and the infusion can generally be continued.  Infusion site burning and non- allergic systemic 
effects can generally be managed with slowing of the infusion. Infusion 
can generally be continued in cases of itchin g or hives  after pausing 
the transfusion, administering antihistamines, and observing the patient for worsening.    
o Severe allergic reactions such as, bronchospasm and hypotension, and may require discontinuation of the infusion.  
 Concomitant medications will be documented on the CRF

Statistical considerations  
  
Statistical Analysis  
 
This is a p ilot study focused on determining the protocol feasibility with limited 
subject enrollment. Therefore, statistical analysis  will include  descriptive 
summaries of both the primary and secondary outcomes of interest. For 
continuous variables we will determine: median, minimum and maximum values. 
Categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_5206]. Unless otherwise indicated, percentages in tables will be column percentages, using the total 
number of observations in the population ( n=10), as the denominator. 
Percentages will be rounded to one decimal place, and thus may not always add 
up to exactly 100%. Clinical laboratory values will be first reported in using International System of Units (SI).

Risks and benefits  
 Potential Benefits of treatment : 
The potential benefits of antiviral treatment with anti -SARS CoV- 2 plasma in 
patients with severe or life- threatening COVID -19 disease are not known.  
However, it is anticipated t hat treatment will decrease disease progression, 
Version 20May2020  
Page 27 of 38  
 decrease ICU or higher -level medical support and possibly reverse disease 
course.  
 
Potential benefits of clinical monitoring and virologic testing : 
Subjects enrolled in the study  may reduce their chances of disease progression.    
 
Potential risks : 
1. Risks of plasma : Fever, chills, rash, headache, serious allergic reactions, TRALI, 
TACO, transmission of infectious agents  
2. Risks of phlebotomy : local discomfort, bruising, hematoma, bleeding, fainting,  
3. Total blood draws will not exceed 500 mL  
4. Risks of oropharyngeal and throat swab: local discomfort, vomiting  
 
Alternatives : 
The alternative to participation in this study is supportive care. There are several ongoing clinical trials at UCM for COVID- [ADDRESS_901781], 
particularly accrual, drop- outs, and protocol deviations on a quarterly basis. The team 
reviews adverse events (AEs) individually in real -time and in aggregate on a quarterly 
basis. The PIs review serious adverse events (SAEs) in real -time. The PIs ensure that 
all protocol deviations, AEs and SAEs are reported to the IRB according to the applicable regulatory requirements . 
  
1. Safety Evaluations will assess for the safety of anti-SARS- CoV-2 plasma  
2. Clinical evaluations: Vital signs and symptom screen on days 0- 7, [ADDRESS_901782] . 
4. Safety laboratory tests (ABO typi[INVESTIGATOR_007], pregnancy testing, CBC , CRP,  and 
comprehensive metabolic panel) will be performed at the local CLIA -certified 
clinical laboratory on days 0- 7 and 14 . 
 
Event (AE)  
 
Version 20May2020  
Page [ADDRESS_901783]. An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the study product, whether or not considered related to the study product.  
 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
 
An SAE is any adverse event that results in any of the following outcomes:  
1. Death  
2. Life-threatening (immediate risk of death)  
3. Prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
4. Persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
5. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or 
require intervention or escalation of care may be considered a serious adverse 
event when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may requir e medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that d o not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
 
Unexpected Adverse event: (UAE) An adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which 
is not consistent with the investigator’s brochure.  
  
Unanticipated Problem (UP)  
 Unanticipated problems involving risks to subject s or others refer to a problem, event or 
information item that is not expected, g iven the nature of the research procedures and 
the subject population being s tudied; and which suggests that the research places 
subjects or others at a greater  risk of  harm or discomfort related to the research than 
was prev iously known. The IRB considers unanticipated problems, in general, to include 
any incident, experience, or outcome that meets ALL of the following criteria:  
 1. unexpected (in terms of nature, sever ity, or fr equency) given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB-
approved research protocol, investig ator’s brochure, drug or device product information, 
informed consent document, or other research materials; and (b) the characteristics of 
the subject population being studied, including underlying diseases, behaviors, or traits;  
 2. related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means 
there is a reasonable possibility  that the incident, experience, or outcome may have 
been caused by [CONTACT_32620]); and 
 
Version 20May2020  
Page 29 of 38  
 3. suggests that the research places subjects  or others at a risk of unknown harm or 
addition/increased frequency of harms (including physical, psychological, economic, 
legal, or social har m) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
Unanticipated problems may be adver se events, protocol deviations, noncompliance or 
other types of problems, but MUST meet all of the criteria listed above.  It is the 
expectation of the  IRB that all approved protocol procedures are being followed without 
alteration unless the IRB has been informed of a protocol change or deviation.  
 Protocol Deviation: Deviation from the IRB -approved study procedures . Designa ted 
serious and non- serious  
1. Serious Protocol Deviation: Protocol deviation that is also an SAE and/or compromises the safety, welfare or rights of subjects or others  
2. Safety Reporting  Requirements  
 
Reporting Interval  
All AEs and SAEs will be documented  from the first administration of study product  until 
completion or un- enrollment from the study.  All AEs and SAEs will be followed until 
resolution even if this extends beyond the study -reporting period. Resolution of an 
adverse event is defined as the return to pre- treatment status or stabilization of the 
condition with the expectation that it will remain chronic.  
At any time after completion of the study, if the investigator becomes aware of a SAE 
that is suspected to be related to study product , this w ill be reported.   
 
Collection and reporting of SAEs and AEs. Documentation of adverse events will be determined by [CONTACT_667609] -mation: Description of the conditio n, dates of condition, 
treatment of condition (medi cations, doses, dates), whether  emergency treatment was 
required, treatment outcome, relationship of the adverse event to the study medication(s) and severity of the event. Additional information about the AE will be 
provided as needed so as to understand the scope of the event.   Management of SAEs. Serious adverse events are always managed, first and foremost, based on medical appropriateness so as to ensure subject safety. The PIs are notified as soon as  pos-sible about an SAE and will work with the medical team to ensure the 
best resolution possible of the problem. In medical emergencies the PIs are permitted to provide all health- care providers with appropriate medical information at hand about the 
subject consistent with HIPAA regulations.  
 Serious adverse events will be forwarded by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_667588] . Fatal or life- threatening unexpected SAE s will be reported to the 
Version 20May2020  
Page 30 of 38  
 IRB immediately.  Non -fatal, non -life-threat ening unexpected SAEs will be reported to 
the Independent Safety Monitor within 72 hours.  
 
Investigator’s Assessment of Adverse Events  
 
The determination of seriousness, severity, and causality will be made by [CONTACT_63689]- site 
investigator who is qualified (lic ensed) to diagnose adverse event information, provide a 
medical evaluation of adverse events, and classify adverse events based upon medical judgment. This includes but is not limited to physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners.  
 
Laboratory abnormalities will be reported as AEs if there is a 2 s.d. increase above 
baseline.  
 
 
Assessment  of Seriousness  
1. Event seriousness will be determined according to the protocol definition of an 
SAE  
2. Assessment  of Severity  
 
Event severity will be assigned according to the scale below  
1 = Mild: Transient or mild discomfort (<48 hours); no medical 
intervention/therapy required.)  
2 = Moderate: Some worsening of symptoms but no or minimal medical 
intervention/therapy required)  
3 = Severe: Escalation of  medical intervention/therapy required 
4 = Life- threatening:  Marked escalation of medical intervention/therapy 
required.   
5= Death  
Assessment  of Association  
The association assessment categories that will be used for this study are:  
• Associate d – The event is temporally related to the administration of the study 
product and no other etiology explains the event.  
• Not Associated –  The event is temporally independent of the study product 
and/or the event appears to be explained by [CONTACT_11693].   
Version 20May2020  
Page [ADDRESS_901784] based on:  
• Temporal relationship of the event to the administration of study product;  
• Whether an alternative etiology has been identified;  
• Biological plausibility;  
• Existing therapy and/or concomitant medications.  
 
Safety Oversight  
Monitoring Plan  
1. All AE and SAW will be reviewed by [CONTACT_667610].  
2. An Independent Safety Monitor (ISM)  has be appointed. The ISM is Dr. O’Connor  
has in infectious diseases and whose primary responsibility is to provide timely 
independent safety monitoring.  An ISM is in close proximity to the study site and 
has the authority to readily access study participant records.  The ISM reviews any SAE that occurs at the study site in real time and provides a written 
assessment.  
Study monitoring  
1. As per ICH -GCP 5.[ADDRESS_901785]. Madariaga, the research team and the Office of 
Clinical research (OCR).  Monitors will verify that  
a. There is documentation of the informed consent process and signed 
informed consent documents for each subject  
b. There is compliance with recording requirements for data points  
c. All SAEs  are reported as required  
d. Individual subjects’ study records and source documents  align  
e. Investigators are in compliance with the protocol.  
f. Regulatory requirements as per Office for Human Research Protections -
OHRP), FDA, and applicable guidelines  (ICH-GCP) are being followed.  
 
Halting Criteria for the Study  
Version 20May2020  
Page 32 of 38  
 In the event that any of the 6 events listed under “Halting Criteria for the Study” occur, 
the IRB will be immediately notified and the study placed on hold until such time as the 
IRB agreed that study activities could resume.   
The study enrollment and dosing will be stopped and an ad hoc review will be performed 
if any of the specific following events occur  or, if in the judgment of the study physician, 
subject safety is at risk of being compromised:  
1. Death within one hour of plasma infusion  
2. Occurrence of a life- threatening allergic/hypersensitivity reaction (anaphylaxis), 
manifested by [CONTACT_67807]. , TRALI , TACO  
3.  One subject with an SAE associated with study product.  
4. Two subjects with a Grade [ADDRESS_901786] and that may 
appear minor in terms of individual events but that collectively may represent a serious potential concern for safety.  
6. Any other event(s) which is considered to be a serious adverse event in the good clinical judgment of the responsible physician.  This will be appropriately documented.  
Upon completion of this review and receipt of the advice of the ISM,  the IRB will 
determine if study entry or study dosing should be interrupted or if study  entry and study 
dosing may continue according to the protocol.  
Halting Criteria/Rules for Subject Infusion  
Infusion of study drug will be halted if any of the following manifestations of anaphylaxis develop and will not be restarted:  
• Skin or mucous membrane manifestations: hives, pruritus, flushing, swollen lips, tongue or uvula  
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798]: dyspnea, wheezing, stridor, hypoxemia  
• A decrease in systolic blood pressure to < 90 mmHg or >30% decrease from baseline or a diastolic drop of >30% from bas eline.  
Version 20May2020  
Page 33 of 38  
 • Tachycardia with an increase in resting heart rate to > 130bpm; or bradycardia <40 
that is associated with dizziness, nausea or feeling faint.  
• Any other symptom or sign which in the good clinical judgment of the study clinician 
or supervising physician warrants halting the infusion.  For example, the rapid onset of  gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and cramps, for 
instance, may be manifestations o f anaphylaxis and may warrant an immediate halt 
prior to meeting full SAE criteria 
 
Ethics/Protection of human subjects  
 
Ethical Standard  
The University of Chicago  is committed to the integrity and quality of the clinical studies 
it coordinates and implements.  The University of Chicago will ensure that the legal and 
ethical obligations associated with the conduct of clinical research involving human subjects are met.   
 
As the Department of Health and Human Services continues to strengthen procedures for human subjects’ protections via new regulations, The University of Chicago will 
review these evolving standards in relation to the proposed activities and will advi se the 
investigators on those that may apply.  
 In addition, The University of Chicago has a Federal  wide Assurance (FWA) number on 
file with the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP).   
 This assurance commits a research facility to conduct all human subjects’ research in accordance with the ethical principles in The Belmont Report and any other ethical standards recognized by [CONTACT_114810].  Finally, per OHRP regulations, the research facility will ensure that the mandatory renewal of this assurance occurs a t the times specified in the 
regulations.  
 Institutional Review Board  The University of Chicago IRB will review this protocol and all protocol -related 
documents and procedures as required by [CONTACT_667611]. The University of Chicago IRB currently holds and will maintain a US FWA 
issued by [CONTACT_228230].  
 Informed Consent Process  
 The informed consent process will be initiated before a volunteer agrees to participate in the study and should continue throughout the individual’s study participation. The subject will sign the informed consent document before any procedures are undertaken for the study. A copy of the signed informed consent document will be given to the 
Version 20May2020  
Page [ADDRESS_901787] has time to consider and discuss participation in the protocol.  
 The consent will describe in detail the study interventions/products/procedures and risks/benefits associated with participat ion in the study. The rights and welfare of the 
subjects will be protected by [CONTACT_667612].  
 Informed C onsent Process for Legall y authorized representative (LAR)  or 
appropriately identified surrogate  
 Informed consent will be discussed and obtained in the subject's private hospi[INVESTIGATOR_667589].  
 For decisionally  impaired individuals, the study staff will carry  out the consent 
discussion by [CONTACT_667613].  
 Consent documents will be mailed/faxed or emailed to the (LAR) or appropriately identified surrogate initially. After the discussion and consent process take place, the consent documents which are signed and dated by [CONTACT_667614]. The consent document that is signed by 
[CONTACT_667615] e may be received in the following manners: 
faxed copy, scanned copy or email. The study team will then send the LAR  or 
appropriately identified surrogate a fully executed copy of the consent to the LAR or 
appropriately  identified surrogate for their records.  
 If needed, a walk -out and meet approach could be used for those LAR or appropriately 
identified surrogate s who do not have the capabilities to receive/send documentation electronically.  
 Consent discuss ion and execution will be done by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Madariaga or a member of the 
research team.  
 Subject Confidentiality  
 
Subject confidentiality is strictly held in trust by [CONTACT_3486], their staff, and the sponsors and their agents. No information concerning the study or the data will 
be released to any unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the sponsor. The results of the research study may be published, but subjects’ names or identifiers will not be revealed.  Records will rem ain confidential.  To maintain confidentiality, the 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_129707] a locked area and results of tests coded to prevent association with subjects’ names.  Data entered into computerized files will be 
Version 20May2020  
Page 35 of 38  
 accessible only by [CONTACT_667616].  Subjects’ records will be available to the FDA, the NIH , investigators at the site 
involved with the study, and the IRB.  
 
Future Use of Stored Specimens  
 
Subjects will be asked for consent to use their samples for future testing before the 
sample is obtained.  The confidentiality of the subject will be maintained. They will be no plans to re- contact [CONTACT_667617].  The risk of collection 
of the sample will be the small risk of bruising or fainting associated with phlebotomy however these samples will be taken at the same time as other protocol required samples.  
 No human genetic testing will be performed on the samples.   
 Five ml of blood samples will be collected at 5 time points (See Schedule of Events).  
Serum will be frozen in 1- ml aliquots.  These samples will be used to answer questions 
that may arise while the study is underway or after it is completed.  If for instance, there were unanticipated AEs, serum could be used to run tests that might help determine the reason for the AEs.  Cytokines could be measured, for example.  
 Samples would not be shared with investigators other than investigators at the University of Chicago  unless outside investigators had relevant assays or expertise not 
available to the study investigators. The specimens would remain linked and at University of Chicago for 5 years. Any use of these specimens not specified in the 
current protocol will be reviewed by [CONTACT_667618]. 
 Data management and monitoring  Source Documents  
 
The primary source documents for this study will be the  subjects’ medical records. If the  
investigators maintain separate research records, both the medical record and the research r ecords will be considered the source documents for the purposes of auditing 
the study. The investigator  will retain a copy of source documents. The investigator will 
permit monitoring and auditing of  these data, and will allow the sponsor, IRB and 
regulatory authorities access to the original  source documents.  The investigator is 
responsible for ensuring that the data collected are complete, accurate, and recorded in 
a timely manner. Source documentation (the point of initial recording of information)  
should support the data collected and entered in to the study database and must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_1024]/or reviewing the data. All data submitted 
should be reviewed by [CONTACT_667619], as appropriate.  Data entered into the study database will be 
collected directly from subjects during study visit s or will be abstracted from subjects’ 
medical records. The subjects’ medical records must record their  participation in the 
clinical trial and what medications (with doses and frequency) or other  medical 
Version 20May2020

 interventions or treatments were administered, as w ell as any AEs experienced during 
the trial. 
 
Data Management Plan  
 Study data will be collected at the study site(s) and entered into the study database. Data entry is  to be completed on an ongoing basis during the study.  
 Data Capture Methods  
 Clinical d ata will be entered into a  database which includes password protection and 
internal quality checks to identify data that appear inconsistent , incomplete, or 
inaccurate.  
 Study Record Retention  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_667590]. The FDA requires study records to be retained for up to 2 years after marketing  approval or disapproval (21 CFR 312.62), or until at least [ADDRESS_901788] 
elapsed since th e formal  discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational 
agent for a specific indication.  These records are also to be maintained in compliance 
with IRB/IEC, state, and federal medical  records retention requirements, whichever is 
longest. Al l stored records are to be kept  confidential to the extent provided by [CONTACT_1032], 
state, and local law. It is the site investigator’s  responsibility to retain copi[INVESTIGATOR_667591].  
 No study document  should be destroyed without prior  written agreement between the 
sponsor  and the Principal Investigator. Should the investigator wish to assign the study 
records to another party and/or move them to another  location, the site investigator 
must provide writ ten notification of such intent to sponsor with the name [CONTACT_667620]/or their new location. The 
sponsor  must be notified in writing and written permission must be received by [CONTACT_129779].

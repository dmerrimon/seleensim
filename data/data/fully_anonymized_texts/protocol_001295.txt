KEY INFORMATION FOR POVIDONE -IODINE INTRANASAL AND OROPHARYNGEAL GARGLE 
FOR PROPHYLAXIS IN FRONT -LINE PHYSICIANS /HEALTHCARE WORKERS  AND INPATIENTS 
TO PREVENT THE SPREAD  OF SAR S-COV -2 (COVID19) 
We are asking you to choose whether or not to volunteer for a research study about using a nasal spray and 
gargle containing an iodine containing solution while working in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . We are asking you because of the 
high potential for catching COVID19 while in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. This page is to give you key information to help you 
decide whether to participate. We have included detailed information after this page. Ask the research team questions.  If you have questions later, the contact [CONTACT_605003]. 
WHAT IS THE STUDY ABOUT AND HOW LONG WILL IT LAST?  
The purpose of this research is to gather i nformation on the safety and effectiveness of povidone -iodine (PVI) 
nasal sprays and g argle to reduce t he risk of contracti ng and spreadi ng COVID19. Your participati on in this 
research will last 3 weeks. This preparation is approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) but not 
for this usage. There will be a treatment group t hat will use PVI and a control group t hat will provi de care as 
usual without using the preparation if they have a contraindication to doing so or would like to opt out but still 
participate.  You will be contact[CONTACT_1006] [ADDRESS_801211] to assess any further thoughts and experiences.
WHAT ARE KEY REASONS YOU MIGHT CHOOSE TO VOLUNTEER FOR THIS STUDY?  
Subjects have a theoretical benefit of a reduced risk of contracting and spreading COVID19. It is hypothesized 
that PVI may inhibit viral attachment to cellular receptors and inhibit viral release and spread from i nfected cells. 
For a complete description of benefits, refer to the Detailed Consent.  
WHAT ARE KEY REASONS YOU MIGHT CHOOSE NOT TO VOLUNTEER FOR THIS STUDY?  
You might not want to participate in this trial because it involves having to use a spray in your nose and 
having to gargle three times a day. Iodine can sometimes cause nasal irritation. For a complete description of 
risks, refer to the Detailed Consent and/or Appendix. An alternative to using this spray is using nothing and 
continuing to exercise goo d hygiene practices.  
DO YOU HAVE TO TAKE PART IN THE STUDY?  
If you decide to take part in the study, it should be because you really want to volunteer. You will not lose any services, benefits or rights you would normally have if you choose not to volunte er. 
WHAT IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

the nasal and gargle preparations but will still be eligible to participate in the COVID19 testing and questionnaires 
as what is  called the “control group”. 
WHERE WILL THE STUDY TAKE PLACE AND WHAT IS THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF TIME INVOLVED? 
The research procedures will be conduct ed at the University of Kentucky Chandler Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. You will meet with 
the research staff to obtain the initial COVID [ADDRESS_801212] and to receive materials and instructions. At the end of the 
study (3 weeks), yo u will return to meet w ith the resear ch staff f or a follow up COVID [ADDRESS_801213] e nds your involv ement in the study.  
WHAT WILL YOU BE ASKED TO DO? 
You will first be asked to complete a pre-screeni ng questionnaire. T hen, i f you have never had a  positive 
COVID19 test, you will undergo a COVID19 test. You will be given the results of your COVID test as soon as they 
are available. You w ill then be given the nasal spray and g argle preparation 
You will be asked to do the nasal spray and g argle [ADDRESS_801214] will be repeated. If during the study period you do NOT develop 
symptoms, y ou will b e re-tested at the end of 3 weeks. 
You will be contact[CONTACT_1006] 6 months following your participation to assess your thoughts and experience on trial 
as well as if you ever contracted COVID following participation and if you were vaccinated or not.  This 
information will only be linked to your unique  name [INVESTIGATOR_350642].
WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS? 
Potential risks include foul taste from the PVI, discoloration of the throat and nose. There is a minusc ule risk of 
thyroid dysfunction if excess amount of iodine is taken. There is a potential that you could still catch COVID19 
while taking this preparation. There is a chance that you may get nasal irritation and drynes s and even a small 
nosebleed while using the nas al spray . 
There is always a chance that any medical treatment can harm you. The research treatments/procedures in this 
study ar e no different. I n addition to risks described in this consent, y ou may ex perience a  previously unknown 
risk or side effect. 
WILL YOU BENEFIT FROM TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY? 
We do not know if you will get any benefit from taking part in this study. However, there is a possibility that use of 
the nasal spray and irrigation may prevent you from contracting the coronavirus that causes COVID19 while you 
are caring for patients. If you take part in this study, information learned may help others with y our condition. 
IF YOU DON’T WANT TO TAKE PART IN THE STUDY, ARE THERE OTHER CHOICES? 
If you do not want to be in the study, there are no other choices except not to take part in the study. 
WHAT WILL IT COST YOU TO PARTICIPATE?

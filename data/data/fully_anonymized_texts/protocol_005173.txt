Specific Aims  
 
Maternal oxygen administration for concerning fetal heart rate tracing (FHT) patterns is common practice 
on Labor and Delivery units in the [LOCATION_002]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_285503], it is unclear if this 
practice is beneficial for the fetus. Category  II FHT, as defined by [CONTACT_271822] (NICHD), is a broad class of FHT patterns that may suggest cord compression 
and/or placental insufficiency for which oxygen is most commonly administered. Although some ani mal 
and human studies have demonstrated that maternal hyperoxygenation can alleviate such fetal heart rate 
decelerations , this purported benefit has not been shown to translate into improved fetal outcomes, 
particularly in relation to acid -base status. In fact, some studies suggest harm with oxygen use due to 
lower umbilical artery pH and incr eased delivery room resuscitation or increased free radical activity. 
Given the indeterminate evidence for this ubiquitously employed resuscitation technique, there is an 
urgent need to further study the utility of maternal oxygen administration in labor f or fetal benefit.   
We propose a randomized controlled non -inferiority trial comparing oxygen to room air in patients with 
Category II FHT. Our central hypothesis is that room air alone is not inferior to oxygen administration 
with regard to neonatal acid -base status and FHT and may in fact, be a safer option for resuscitation due 
to less production of reactive oxygen species.  
Primary Aim : Determine the effect of maternal oxygen administration for Category II FHT on 
arterial umbilical cord lactate.    
Hypot hesis: Room air, as a substitute for oxygen supplementation, is no different than oxygen in 
altering the acid -base status of the neonate as reflected in umbilical arterial (UA) lactate.  
Fetal hypo -oxygenation, as reflected by [CONTACT_285512], resu lts in metabolic acidosis due to a 
shift from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism in which lactate and hydrogen ion production significantly 
increase causing a decrease in pH. Elevated umbilical cord lactate has been shown to be a surrogate for 
fetal metabolic  acidosis and resultant neonatal morbidity. The primary outcome will be umbilical arterial 
(UA) lactate, and secondary outcomes will be other components of a UA gas.  
 
Secondary Aim #1 : Characterize the effect of oxygen administration on fetal heart tracing  patterns  
Hypothesis: Oxygen administration will be associated with a rate of persistent Category II FHT 
that is not different from those exposed to room air.  
Oxygen is typi[INVESTIGATOR_285504]. Hence, evaluating the effect  of 
oxygen on subsequent FHT is pi[INVESTIGATOR_285505]. The primary outcome will be resolution of 
Category II FHT. We will also investigate the effect of oxygen administration on mode of delivery, 
particularly cesarean delivery for non -reassuring feta l status.  
 
Secondary Aim #2 : Evaluate the safety of oxygen administration by [CONTACT_285513] (ROS) in maternal and neonatal blood.  
Hypothesis: Oxygen administration will be associated with increased oxidative stress in maternal 
and neonatal cord blood  as represented by [CONTACT_285514] ( MDA ). 
Over -oxygenation can result in free radical or ROS formation that have detrimental downstream effects. 
The presence of reactive oxygen species results in degradation of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_285506] e and 
resultant formation of malondialdehyde (MDA) , which has been studied as a surrogate for oxidative 
stress .  
 
  
Background/Significance  
Maternal oxy gen administration for fetal heart rate tracing (FHT) changes is a common practice 
on Labor and Delivery units in the Unites States . Despi[INVESTIGATOR_285507], it is unclear if this practice is beneficial for the 
fetus. In a recent review of maternal oxygen administration in labor, Hamel et al1 concluded that 
there is insufficient evidence for routine oxygen administration for intrauterine resuscitation and 
that such administration may even be harmful via production of free radicals. The 2012 
Cochrane review evaluating mater nal oxygen administration for fetal distress also found limited 
evidence to evaluate the effectivene ss of oxygen for fetal distress.2  
Category II FHT , as defined  by [CONTACT_85666] 
(NICHD)3, is a broad class of FHT patterns which can include both variable and/or late 
decelerations , represent ing cord compression and placental insufficiency, respectively. These 
decelerations are often thought to be a reflection of fetal hypooxygenation. The underlying 
hypothesis for oxygen benefit and the primary motivation for generalized use in labor is to 
transfer oxygen to the fetus and therefore improve or reverse the percei ved fetal 
hypooxygenation  determined by [CONTACT_285515] .  
Although some animal and human studies have d emonstrated that maternal hyperoxygenation 
can allevia te fetal heart rate decelerations4, [ADDRESS_348569] to fetal 
acid-base status.  
Specific A im 1:  Determine the effect of maternal oxygen administration for Category II 
FHT on arterial umbilical cord lactate.   Fetal hypooxygenation, as reflected by [CONTACT_285516], results in a metabolic acidosis due to a shift from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism in 
which lactate and hydrogen ion production significantly increases as a result of glucose 
breakdown and  pyruvate conversion.[ADDRESS_348570] vein (Figure 1) resulting in 
prevention or reversal of anaerobic metabolism and a subsequent 
reflection in umbilical cord artery finding s. This, however, has not been 
substantiated by [CONTACT_285517]. We hypothesize that room air, as a 
substitute for oxygen supplementation, is no different than oxygen in altering 
the acid -base status of the neonate as reflected in umbilical cord gas 
parameters. Secondary outcomes will be additional  components of an 
umbilical artery gas.  Figure 1: Fetoplacental circulation  Placenta

Specific Aim 2: Characterize  the effect of oxygen administration on fetal heart tracing 
patterns  
In clinical practice, oxygen is administered to patients with Category II  FHT in order to 
resuscitate potential fetal hypooxygenation that manifests as heart rate decelerations. Evidence 
thus far shows that Category II FHT are associated with a wide spectrum of neonatal outcomes 
and therefore do not uniformly reflect fetal acid -base status19, 20. Hence, evaluating the effect of 
oxygen on subsequent FHT categorization is pi[INVESTIGATOR_285505]. The outcome that will 
be investigated is rate of persistent Category II FHT after intervention. We will also evaluate the 
types and frequency of deceleration patterns present both pre and post intervention.  We 
hypothesize that oxygen administration for  Category II FHT will be associated with a rate of 
persistent Ca tegory II FHT that is not different from those exposed to room air.  
 
Specific Aim 3:  Evaluate the safety of  oxygen administration by [CONTACT_285518], the 
risks of oxygen exposure must be further explored. Over -oxygenation can result in free radical 
formation, downstream effects of which include cell membrane and DNA damage and resultant  
carcinogenesis.[ADDRESS_348571] antioxidant systems1, 26.  
One of the primary markers of oxidative stress studied in the 
literature is malondialdehyde (MDA).  The presence of 
reactive oxygen species results in degradation  of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_285508]27which then modifies endogenous 
proteins. MDA levels, therefore, have been studied as a 
surrogate for oxidative stress.28-32 (Figure 2)

Increased MDA levels in the neonate may be consequential and have been associated with 
morbidity including hyperbilirubinemia33 and hypoxic -ischemic encephalopathy34.There is also 
evidence that MDA can be transplacentally transported and thus, both mother and fetus are at 
risk for downstream effects.[ADDRESS_348572] gas parameters, FHT patterns , and oxidative 
stress in the fetus and mother. The study will be a prospective, randomized non inferiority tr ial to 
be conducted at Barnes Jewish Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Current practice at our institution for intrauterine fetal 
resuscitation of Category II FHT include any of the combination of (1) oxygen administration via 
nonrebreather face mask at 10L/min (FiO2 approximate ly 0.80 )36 continued for the duration of 
labor (2) intravenous fluid b olus (3) maternal repositioning (4) discontinuation of oxytocin.  We 
hypothesize that room air for Category II FHT will be no different than oxygen administration in 
reducing the degree of fetal metabolic acidosis.  This study will include term, singleton patients 
admitted to Labor& Delivery for spontaneous labor or lab or induction. Multiple s, fetal 
anomalies, Category III FHT, umbilical artery doppler abnormalities and preterm pregnancies 
will be excluded. Additionally, women will be excluded if oxygen is required for maternal 
indications such as hypooxygenation or card iopulmonary disease. Our primary objective will be 
umbilical cord lactate. Secondary objectives include additional cord gas parameters including 
umbilical artery pH, umbilical artery base deficit, and umbilical vein oxygen saturation; FHT 
categorization an d deceleration patterns ; maternal and umbilical cord blood measurement of 
malondialdehyde.  
Consent will be obtained at time of admission to Labor & Delivery. Randomization to either the 
oxygen group or room air group will be performed when the patient is in active labor (defined as 
regular contractions and  ≥ 6cmcervical dilation) and develops Category II FHT necessitating 
intrauterine resuscitation as determined by [CONTACT_285519] ( Figure 3) . This will be 
performed via a computer -generated randomiz ation sequence in a 1:1 ratio. P atients randomized 
to the oxygen group will receive the above stated current management of oxygen via 
nonrebreather face mask  at 10L/min  and “per-protocol” defined as receiving the mask for at least 
90% of the remaining duration of labo r including during cesarean delivery . Patients randomized 
to the room air group will not receive oxygen for Category II FHT unless otherwise required for 
maternal indications. Alternative and/or additional intrauterine resuscitation techniques for both 
groups (i.e. fluid bolus, maternal repositioning , and discontinuation of oxytocin ) will be left to 
the discretion of the medical team.   The initial 6 patients consented and randomized will be part 
of a compliance run -in with the same protocol as a bove.

Specific Aim 1:  Determine the effect of maternal oxygen administration for Category II FHT on 
neonatal cord gas parameters   
After delivery of the infant, a segment of the umbilical cord will be removed with immediate 
collection of umbilical artery and vei n samples by [CONTACT_285520]. These samples will be sent 
to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_285509].   
Specific Aim 2: Characterize the effect of oxygen administration on fetal heart tracing patterns  
The patient’s primary nurse will document the time at which intervention is initiated. A blinded 
investigator will then retrospectively assess FHT categorization and deceleration patterns both 
pre and post intervention.  
Specific Aim  3:  Evaluate the safety of oxygen administration by [CONTACT_285521] a marker of oxidative 
stress. MDA is a by[CONTACT_285522], which occurs as a r esult of oxidative stress.

Data Collection  
The patient’s primary nurse will perform real -time documentation of oxygen initiation, any 
disruption in intervention, administration of amnioinfusion and additional resuscitation 
techniques  performed (number of times patient is repositioned, total intravenous fluids, 
discontinuation of oxytocin). Study staff will collect data from medical records on:  
1) Antepartum history:  
a. Demographic data: Maternal age, race  
b. Obstetric history: parity, prior cesarean, gestational age at delivery  
c. Medical history: BMI at initial prenatal visit, diabetes, chronic hypertension, 
severe anemia (Hemoglobin <7), tobacco use, illicit drug use  
d. Prenatal course: diagnosis of hypertensive disorders, gestational diabetes, 
abruption, intrauterine growth restriction, oligohydramnios  
2) Intrapartum data:  
a. Indication for admission/induction  
b. Oxytocin (duration, total received dose)  
c. Analgesia  
d. Duration of labor (first and second stage)  
e. Diagnosis of chorioamnionitis  
f. Mode of delivery  
g. Indication for cesarean  
h. Electronic fetal monitoring  
3) Neonatal course:  
a. APGARs  
b. Neonatal weight  
c. Admission to special care nursery (SCN) or neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)  
d. Duration of admission to SCN or NICU  
e. Diagnosis of any of the following: hypoxic isc hemic encephalopathy, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1421], oxygen requirement, requirement of hypothermia therapy, 
seizures, sepsis or suspected sepsis, neonatal death  
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
In addition to principle investigator review of adverse event s, a data and safety monitoring board 
(DSMB) will be established. This board will have three individuals ([CONTACT_285525] McNicholas, [CONTACT_285526], [CONTACT_285527]) not directly involved in the study. The DSMB will meet once 
50% of participants have been re cruited to review any adverse neonatal or maternal events 
among the study cohort and determining safety of continuing the study to completion. The 
DSMB will receive a report of any severe and/or non -severe adverse neonatal outcomes within 
72 hours of occur rence. Reportable severe adverse neonatal outcomes include intrapartum 
stillbirth and neonatal death. Reportable non -severe adverse neonatal outcomes include need for 
hypothermia protocol, seizures, and prolonged NICU stay >72 hours.   
Statistical  Analysis  
Intention -to-treat (primary analysis)  and per protocol analyses will be performed.  Chi-squared 
and Fisher’s exact tests will be used to compare categorical variables as appropriate. Continuous 
variables will initially be assessed for distribution pattern via the Kolmogorov -Smirnov test. 
Normally distributed variables will be compared using Student’s t -tests and non -normally 
distributed variables will be analyzed with the Mann -Whitney U test. These analyses will be 
supplemented by [CONTACT_285523].  
Tests with p <0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Analyses will be performed using 
Stata (Stata Corp., College Station, TX).  
For the primary outcome of lactate, 95% confidence intervals (CI) will be calcu lated for the 
mean cord lactate levels in each group. Comparison of the 95% CI in each group will then 
determine non -inferiority or inferiority.  
Additional interaction analyses for the primary outcome will be performed f or the following 
subgroups:   
1) Prese nce of chronic medical conditions ( hypertensive disorder, diabetes)  
a. Patients with hypertensive disorders (chronic hypertension, gestational 
hypertension, preeclampsia)  
b. Patients with diabetes mellitus (gestational diabetes, T1DM, T2DM)  
2) Recurrent late dec elerations pre intervention  
3) Recurrent variable decelerations pre intervention  
4) Prolonged deceleration pre intervention  
5) Fetal tachycardia pre intervention  
6) Fetuses with intrauterine growth restriction  
7) Chorioamnionitis  
8) Within oxygen group: Duration of oxygen exposure  
a. <50% of total duration of active labor (onset of active labor to delivery)  
b. >50% of total duration of active labor (onset of active labor to delivery)  
 
Odds ratios and 95% CI will be calculated for the secondary outcome of persistent Categor y II 
FHT. Kaplan -Meir analyses will be performed for fetal monitoring analyses.   
For the outcome of maternal and cord blood MDA, a fetal MDA will be calculated by 
[CONTACT_285524]. The calculated mean 
fetal MDA and maternal MDA values will then be compared between groups using either 
Student t test or Mann Whitney U test.  
  
Sample size analysis  
 A review of previously collected data from our institution of [ADDRESS_348574] lactate of 3.5±1.6 mmol/L in women with Category II FHT within [ADDRESS_348575] a non -inferiority margin of 30% with 
90% power, using a one -sided two -sample t -test (alpha 0.025) . To accommodate a 15% drop 
out/cross over rate , a total of 114 patients will be needed. We plan on performing an initial  
compliance run -in of 6 patients  making the total enrollment 120 patients. Data analysis will only 
be performed on the 114 patients enrolled after the initial 6 patients enrolled/randomized in the 
compliance run -in/pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] . Previous studies have shown an increased risk for neonatal morbidity 
with cord lactate cut -offs ranging from 3.2 -6.014, 15, 38 -41. The margin of noninferiority was 
therefore set at a lactate cut -off of 4.5, above which there is a clear association with neonatal 
morbidity.

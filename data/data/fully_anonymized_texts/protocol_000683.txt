 Hypothesis:  The Negative Pressure Platform Wound Device ( NP-PWD ) technology is a feasible 
alternative  to manage skin and soft tissue defects as compared to standard of care, KCI Wound 
VAC granulofoam. 
Study Synopsis:   This study will demonstrate the effectiveness of the NP-PWD therapy in 
managing complex wounds and improving wound healing parameters as compared to standard of 
care.  
 
A study of [ADDRESS_176144] of care arm, will receive KCI Wound VAC Granulofoam. Arm 2, the study arm, will receive treatment with NP- PWD.  
Prior to the initial application, wound evaluations and photography will be completed  to include 
assessment of infection with wound swabs. The wound dressing will be assessed for the need for 
change every 2 -3 days and changed if clinically indicated  (following each device IFU). Subjects 
will be followed for up to nine days post initial application. At minimum, the randomized treatment will be applied for [ADDRESS_176145] who do not complete the treatment course (minimum of 2 days of treatment), may be replaced per investigators discretion. Follow up data will be gathered at each  
change/ removal of the NP- PWD  or Wound VAC . The data collected will include indications for 
dressing change, dressing change process, photographs and assessments for wound healing, infection , and adverse events. Gathered clinical data of the enrolled  subjects will be used to 
evaluate the feasibility  in using the NP- PWD  device for wound healing management . 
 
C2.  BACKGROUND    
  Open complex wounds are a prominent issue, as unhealed or untreated  wounds pose a risk of 
microbial infection. The Negative Pressure Platform Wound Device or NP- PWD, is  an 
innovative therapy which uses a patented dressing to promote healing by [CONTACT_40397] a vacuum (negative pressure) at the wound site without the use of an intervening foam dressing. This pressure promotes granulation of the skin, forming new connective tissue and blood vessels, removes or inhibits microbial and infectious agents, as well as pulls wound edges together for 
closure. Although this therapy is evolving, the review of elements and effects on wounds is still uncertain and requires further studies regarding the mechanism and use of NP-PWD in wound healing.   
C3.  OBJECTIVES/STUDY GOALS    
 This study is intended to evaluate the feasibility  of the NP -PWD  as compared to SOC for the 
treatment of wound healing through assessment of healing time, feasibility of application , patient

 comfort , and adverse events . 
 
Primary:  
To determine the usability and feasibility of NP -PWD in comparison to SoC 
Secondary: 
- To evaluate and compare wound readiness for closure between study wounds treated with NP-PWD versus SoC 
- To evaluate colony forming units present on study wounds before and after treatment(s) 
- To evaluate the ease of use of the product by [CONTACT_152905]  
- To evaluate tolerability of the product by [CONTACT_152906]

NP-PWD 0 2_V2_09 February 24

 Informed consent of potential subjects will be done in a quiet and private area of the patient care 
setting (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_152898]) to ensure patient confidentiality. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_152899]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_152900].   A copy of the IRB-approved informed consent document will be given to the potential subject 
for their review and ample time will be given for their decision making. If the potential subject decides to participate, the IRB -approved informed consent document will be signed and dated 
appropriately by [CONTACT_152907]. The original signed consent document will be kept in the study files; a copy will be  given to the subject and a copy will be placed in the 
subject’s medical record.  
 
Study procedures will not begin until eligibility is determined , and the informed consent process 
is completed. Patients who sign the informed consent form are considered to be enrolled. If a patient signs the consent but is not randomized into the study, the patient is considered a screen failure.  
 Subjects will be enrolled for up to [ADDRESS_176149] who do not complete the treatment 
course ( minimum of 2 days of treatment), may be replaced per investigators discretion.  
 
Activities to be completed  for each visit are as follows:  
 
Treatment (Day 0):  Screening, consent, documentation of baseline demographics, medical 
history and physical, measurement and photography of wound, wound swab for colony forming 
unit count, randomization, and application of NP-PWD or Wound Vac according to randomization.  
 
Follow-up visits: 
 At each follow -up visit the study wound will be assessed for the need for dressing change (every 
2-3 days) and changed if clinically indicated (following the respective device’s IFU). The study 
wound sites will be assessed for signs of infection, erythema, itching, drainage, quality of closure and pain.  
Follow-up (Visit 2) : Assessment of need for dressing change and completion of c hange of 
treatment dressing  if necessary . Should the study subject’s wound indicate  continuation of 
negative pressure wound therapy a second application of the randomized treatment may be applied. If the subject no longer requires negative pressure wound therapy, the therapy will be

 discontinued. Wound assessments , measurements , photographs, assess ments  for adverse events  
will all be completed and documented . 
 
Optional Follow-up ( Visit 3  & 4): Assessment of need for change of treatment dressing, 
reapplication if necessary  or removal, wound assessment, measurements, photographs, assess for 
adverse events.  
 
If negative pressure wound therapy is no longer indicated at any time after the minimum 
requirement of 2has been met , the therapy will be discontinued and assessments will be 
completed to include a final wound swab, and the subject’s participation will end.

 *At minimum the treatment will be applied once but can be applied up to three times. Visits  3 
and 4 are optional.  
^ The wound swab will be taken once at baseline and once at the time of final removal. 
NP-PWD [ADDRESS_176150]’s explicit permission as required by [CONTACT_2371]. 
 
Subjects will be made aware that their medical records, which identify them as individuals, may 
be inspected by [CONTACT_152908]/or other applicable regulatory authorities. 
 
Data Analysis 
All pertinent data will be analyzed using descriptive and correlational statistics as appropriate to compare those patients who were treated.  Overall standard descriptive statistical methods will be 
used to analyze other data; any categorical variables will be compared via chi square analysis while continuous variables will be compared via student-t test or Wilcoxson test as appropriate.  We plan to perform a forward stepwise logistic regression. The available data including patient specific data as well as treatment variables will first be evaluated using a univariate analysis for 
possible significant risk factors. These will then be analyzed using a multiple logistic regression 
analysis and tested for interaction.

Adverse Events  
Adverse events that are anticipated in this patient population include those associated with wound healing.    
Unexpected adverse events and unanticipated problems 
All unanticipated problems involving risks to subject or others will be promptly reported to the IRB by [CONTACT_6968]. A complete written report will follow the initial notification.   
Adverse Device Effects  
Unanticipated adverse device effects (UADE) are any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death, was not previously identified in a nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or 
application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates 
to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.   
NP-PWD [ADDRESS_176151] learns of the event (21 CFR 812.150(a)(1). Sponsors must immediately 
conduct an evaluation of a UADE and must report the results of the evaluation to FDA, all reviewing IRBs, and participating investigators within [ADDRESS_176152] (21 CFR 812.46(b), 812.150(b)(1).

done in a quiet and private area of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_152903].     Subjects will be made aware that their research records, which identify them as individuals, 
may be inspected by [CONTACT_112103], to ensure the integrity of the data 
and/or to protect research participants.    
CONFIDENTIALITY PROCEDURES FOR RESEARCH RECORDS, DATA

dexamethasone) versus FOND+O (FOND plus olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) for the prevention of 
chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting in hematology patients receiving highly 
emetogenic chemotherapy regimens: the FOND -O Study   
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_302050], PharmD, BCOP   
1. Objectives  
The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_302051] (fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053] , ondansetron, and dexamethasone) versus triplet therapy alone in preventing 
chemotherapy -induced nausea and vomiting ( CINV ) in hematology patients receiving highly or 
moderately emetogenic chemotherapy regimens . 
 
The primary objective is to determine if addition of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_302052] (< 25 mm on a 100 mm visual 
analog scale [ VAS ]) during the overall assessment period (st arting day 1 of chemotherapy and 
continuing for 5 days after discontinuation of chemotherapy)  for the first cycle of chemotherapy.  
 
Secondary objectives will be  reported as acute phase [chemotherapy days], delayed phase [[ADDRESS_369215] ration], and overall phases [chemotherapy days plus 5 days after]) .  
The secondary objectives are to determine if addition of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_302053]:  
 Reduces the number of emetic epi[INVESTIGATOR_302054]  
 Reduces the number of rescue medication doses per patient  
 Reduces the p ercent of patients with minimal  nausea (<25 mm on a 100 mm VAS)  
 Reduces the p ercent of patients achieving complete protection (CP = no emesis, no 
breakthrough antiemetic use, no significant nausea)  
 
For safety analysis, an a dditional secondary objective will assess the rate of study drug (olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_302055]) discontinuation.  
 
 
 
 
2. Background  
Nausea and vomiting remains a common and difficult to manage consequence of chemotherapy despi[INVESTIGATOR_294792]. These symptoms can often lead to a decreased quality of life, dehydration, and  malnutrition. 
 
 Page 3 of 13 Version Date: 11/21/15; 07/11/[ADDRESS_369216] (ex: ondansetron) 
to prevent nausea and vomiting. For patients with highly and often moderately  emetogenic chemotherapy, 
an NK1 receptor antagonist , such as fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053],  is added to the regimen. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_302056] (i.e., American Society of 
Clinical Oncology [ASCO ], National Comprehensive Cancer Network  [NCCN ]), nausea and vomiting 
remains a significant complication from chemotherapy.  
Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_302057]/vomiting pathw ays1. Olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_302058] s been studied for breakthrough2 chemo therapy -induced nausea 
and vomiting (CINV) as well as in prophylaxis of highly and moderately emetogenic regimens (HEC & 
MEC, respectively)3,4,5. However, these studies have focused on patients with solid tumor malignancies 
and single day chemotherapy regimens. A phase I trial established the dose of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_302059] 
[ADDRESS_369217]  clinical trials , olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_302060] a 5HT3 antagonists and 
corticosteroid1,7 or compared to 5HT3 alone8 for preventing CINV with HEC and MEC regimens for a 
variety of sol id tumors and lymphoma . These studies reported improved control of delayed nausea and 
vomiting with use of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. Additionally, olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_302061]1 
receptor antagonists (i.e., aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053]) as well as in addition to standard triplet prophylaxis regimens which 
include NK [ADDRESS_369218] as effective 
as aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_302062] n olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_302063]. 
Based on the results from these various studies, national guidelines (National Comprehensive Cancer 
Network [NCCN] guideline on Antiemesis version 1.2015) recommend olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] [ADDRESS_369219] in therapy for olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (in replacement of or in 
combination to NK1 receptor antagonist) in H EC and MEC regimens, respectively .  
To date, no publications have reported outcomes from adding olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_302053]9,10  
specifically for hematology patients, including those receiving multi -day HEC and MEC regimens  and/or 
undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplants .

Comprehensive Cancer Network Antiemesis Guidelines 201 5 
 
Per physician discretion, outpatient regimens can be administered inpatient per Georgia Regent’s normal 
operations. Additionally, the regimen descriptions above are general doses per the clinical studies ; if a 
patient’s dose is modified (renal adjustments,  pharmacokinetic changes, etc.) they will not be excluded 
from taking part in this study.  
 
Exclusion Criteria

4. Number of Subjects /Records/Samples Collected  
110 total patients will be accrued for this study  to allow for 10% drop out or loss to follow up . See section 
below for description of sample size calculation.  
 
5. Recruitment Methods  
Describe when, where, and how potential subjects will be recruited  
Patients will be identified by [CONTACT_302089]/oncology pharmacists before a patient is 
initiated on one of the chemotherapy regimens listed in the inclusion criteria. Patients may be 
identified in the inpatient or outpatient setting  through the ch emotherapy patient lists which are part 
of routine practice at GRU for coordination of care . Once a patient is identified, he/she will be 
approached by a member of our study team to discuss consent. Additionally, there will be a study 
investigator present at each bone marrow transplant ( BMT ) intake meeting on Friday mornings. 
These meetings will allow the study investigators to identify patients to enroll and discuss the 
process with the hematology physicians prior to the patient being admitted. Note that t he physician 
co-investigator  on this study  is the department head for the BMT program at GRU and is intimately 
involved in routine patient care for each subject who would be approached for this study.  
Patients receiving outpatient chemotherapy will be app roached by a member of the study team 
during their clinic visit prior to receiving chemotherapy. The study team member will be able to 
discuss the research protocol and informed consent document at that time.  
Patients receiving inpatient chemotherapy will  be approached by a member of the study team on the 
day of admission for chemotherapy or no later than the first day of chemotherapy for existing 
inpatient admissions. The study team member will be able discuss the research protocol and 
informed consent do cument at that time in the patient’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39223].  
 
 
 
6. Procedures Involved  
a. Describe the procedures i nvolved  to include those procedures that are standard evaluation 
and/or care and those that are solely for research purposes:  
All subjects will receive standard triplet antiemetic therapy which consists of ondansetron 
and dexamethasone on each day of chemotherapy plus fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 150 mg IV once  per 
national guidelines for CINV prophylaxis (see background section above). In addition to 
those antiemetics,  subjects will be randomized to receive placebo or olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 10mg orally 
on all chemotherapy days and for three additional days post chemotherapy in addition to 
standard triplet therapy. This dosing strategy mirrors prior studies of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_302074] 6 of 13 Version Date: 11/21/15; 07/11/16  (see background above). The addition of olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_302075].  
All study subjects will have access to the same rescue antiemetic medications as per 
standard medical care.  
Assessment of vomiting via review of electronic medical records (intake/output record) and 
assessment of uitlization  of rescue antiemetic agents  for CINV (review of medication 
administration record)  is part of routine medical care/evaluation for all subjec ts. This 
assessment would not change for the participants of the study. Assessment of nausea is a 
standard medical evaluation for these patients as well  via discussion with patients by [CONTACT_302090] ; however, for this study t he assessment tool (VAS form ) will be utilized  for 
study purposes only and would not routinely be filled out by [CONTACT_302091].  
 
 
b. Describe and explain the study design : 
This is a blinded, placebo controlled trial randomizing patients to receive placebo or olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] [ADDRESS_369220] triplet therapy (ondansetron and dexamethasone on each day of chemotherapy and 
fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 150 mg IV on day one of chemotherapy). See above for rando mization procedure 
details.  
Patients will be randomized to placebo or olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_105683] a block design stratified by 
[CONTACT_302092] (transplant conditioning vs. chemotherapy only) and number of days of 
chemotherapy (single vs. multi -day) by [CONTACT_302093] (IDS) at 
GRU Medical Center. The block randomization will occur in blocks of four and is blinded 
to all study investigators. The placebo tablets and olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_302076] b linding of patients, nursing, and pharmacy staff 
including the study investigators.  The placebo tablet is similar color and size as the study 
drug, olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], to aid in effective blinding.  
For study patients who are inpatient, each blinded dose of study  drug/placebo will be dispensed 
from the IDS Pharmacy for administration by [CONTACT_75462]. Therefore, assessment of adherence will 
be possible via review of the medication administration record (MAR) for these study patients. For 
study patients who are out patient, the IDS Pharmacy will dispense the study drug/placebo as an 
outpatient prescription to be administered by [CONTACT_102]. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_302077].  
Outcome measures assessed : 
Primary: overall percentage of patients who had a complete response (CR) defined as no 
emesis and minimal nausea (< 25 mm on a 100 mm visual analog scale [ VAS ]) during the 
overall assessment period (starting day 1 of chemotherapy  and continuing for 5 days after 
discontinuation of chemotherapy)  for the first cycle of chemotherapy.  
 
 Page 7 of 13 Version Date: 11/21/15; 07/11/16  Secondary (all to be reported as acute  [chemotherapy days] , delayed  [5 days after 
chemotherapy administration] , and overall phases  [chemotherapy days plus 5 days after] ) 
o Number of emetic epi[INVESTIGATOR_302054]  
o Number of rescue medications doses administered per patient   
o Percent of patients with n o significant nausea (<25 mm on a 100 mm VAS)  
o Percent of patients achieving c omplete protection (CP = no emesis, no breakthrough 
antiemetic use, no significant nausea)  
o Rate of discontinuation of study drug  
Nausea will be assessed in both the inpatient and outpatient settings using the visual analog 
scale (VAS). This is the standard assessment tool for CINV in previous trials. The VAS 
scores will be evaluated on the inpatient setting by [CONTACT_3462], whereas the patient will 
be responsible for returning their VAS documentation in the outpatient setting at the 
standard of care follo w-up visit. Each patient will be given a notebook that includes their 
VAS documents and instructions for returning the notebook. See Appendix A for an 
example of our study VAS document. This document will include a de -identified number 
for each study subje ct and no PHI.  
NOTE: For patients receiving chemotherapy regimens (i.e. ABVD and ICE) that are administered 
for more than one cycle, only data from the first cycle will be included in the assessment of the 
primary outcome. During subsequent cycles, patient s can elect to be unblinded and receive 
olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] ; however, that data will only be included as a secondary analysis of outcomes during 
repeat chemotherapy cycles.  
c. Describe the p rocedures performed to lessen the probability or magnitude of risks : 
In reg ards to risk to the study subjects who are randomized to receive the study drug, 
olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], all patients will be assessed for side effects per routine assessment during 
standard medical care. Inpatients are assessed daily by [CONTACT_302094] -up visits by [CONTACT_302095]. Study 
investigators are directly involved in these daily direct patient care activities  as part of their 
routine daily activities . Patients have access to the Cancer Center re sources if any questions 
or concerns arise while outpatient . As for the risk to confidentiality, appropriate measures 
will be taken to safeguard patient data. All identifiable patient information will be stored on 
the institutional secure R drive in electr onic format or locked in a secure file cabinet if in 
paper format.  Only one document will be generated with the list of patient names and 
MRNs along with the random study number. This document will only be kept on the R 
drive and will not be transmitted e lectronically. All patient data will be collected on a de -
identified electronic Excel document stored on the R drive.    
d. Describe the duration of an individual subject’s participation in the study  and the time 
involve d: 
Each patient will be included from the start date of chemotherapy until [ADDRESS_369221] 
chemotherapy  (range 6 -11 days) . Data will be stored until the final project manuscript is 
complete and data storage is no longer necessary. Subjects may withdraw at any time and 
no further data will be collected.  However, subjects will continue to be followed by [CONTACT_302096] 8 of 13 Version Date: 11/21/15; 07/11/[ADDRESS_369222] of care purposes (i.e., non -research purposes) where ongoing 
safety monitoring can occur if necessary.  
 
 
7. Data and Specimen Management  
a. Describe the data analy sis plan, including any statistical procedures : 
Based on an 80% power and an alpha of 0.05, we estimated a need for 49 patients 
in each treatment arm. From a review of existing literature, the sample size is based 
on an estimated complete response achieved  in 65% of patients on triplet therapy 
alone and a hypothesized clinically relevant increase of 25% for the treatment 
group to 90% .  Therefore, 110  total patients will be accrued for this study to allow 
for 10% drop out or loss to follow up.  
 
Demographic and descriptive data will be compared for the two groups (olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_302078]. placebo) using t -tests for continuous data and chi -square or Fisher’s exact tests 
for categorical data  where appropriate . Chi -square or Fisher’s exact will also be 
used to  analyze the primary endpoint of CR for group differences while logistic 
regression will be used to explore the additional effect of potential confounding 
variables. Chi -square or Fisher’s exact tests will be used to analyze the secondary 
outcomes of rate of no significant nausea, CP  rate, and incidence of discontinuation 
of study drug. A poisson or negative binomial analysis will be used to analyze 
number of emetic epi[INVESTIGATOR_302079]. All analyses 
will be performed using SAS© 9. 4 at a Type 1 error rate of alpha=0.05.  ☐  N/A       
 
b. When applicable, provide a power analysis : 
Based on discussion with our biostatistician, using 80% power and an alp ha

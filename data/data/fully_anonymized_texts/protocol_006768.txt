Sample Size: 16/group (32 total for participants with POTS and healthy controls)
To allow for participant drop-out prior to study completion, we will plan to obtain 
informed consent from 35 participants in total (18 POTS, 17 Controls). 
Target Enrollment Period: 5 yr
Study Design: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover
Primary Study Objective: The purpose of the proposed research is to determine how changes in kidney 
dopamine (DA) activity influence urinary sodium excretion.  Dopamine in the 
kidney plays an important role in maintaining sodium balance.  We will decrease 
DA activity in the kidney by [CONTACT_198760].  
We will compare urinary sodium excretion following the active agent and a placebo
in participants with POTS and healthy controls. Urinary and plasma 
catecholamines will be measured to assess changes produced by [CONTACT_198761]. A dose escalation study with doses of 50mg, 100mg and 200mg will 
first be conducted to assess how well these doses are tolerated when given every 
6 hours. Secondary Study Objective: We also want to compare findings in normal volunteers and in participants with 
postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS). These patients are characterized by [CONTACT_198762]. To determine whether some of 
these patients do not effectively regulate sodium excretion, the catecholamine, 
diuretic, and cardiovascular responses following orally administered carbidopa in 
participants with POTS will be compared with those of healthy volunteers. The 
dose escalation study will therefore include both POTS and controls.Study Population and Main

Participants in the dose escalation part of the study are excluded from 
participation in the main study.
Primary Outcome Measures: For the dose escalation study, results from the labs, ECG, Psychiatric 
Questionnaire and vital signs will be evaluated. For the main study, the primary 
outcome is the urinary sodium concentration normalized to creatinine.
Secondary Outcome 
Measures:Plasma and urinary catecholamines
Blood pressure and heart rate
Plasma sodium
Plasma renin activity
Statistical Considerations 
(sample size and analysis 
plan):Based on our preliminary findings of a standard deviation for urinary sodium 
excretion of 30 mEq/g creatinine, a sample size of 16/group (32 total) will have 
80% power to detect a difference in group means (control vs. POTS) of 31 mEq/g 
creatinine with a 0.05 two-sided significance level. To allow for participant drop-out 
prior to study completion, we will plan to obtain informed consent from 35 
participants in total.
Differences in urinary sodium in samples (1) collected at baseline vs. those 
collected following treatment (time effect) and (2) collected after placebo vs. 
carbidopa (treatment effect) will be assessed using a paired t-test and Wilcoxon 
signed-rank test.  Differences between the patient and control groups (group 
effect) will be assessed using a student’s t-test and a Mann-Whitney U test.  
Similar methods will be used to compare secondary outcome measures, such as 
BP, HR, plasma and urinary catecholamines, plasma renin activity, plasma 
aldosterone, and plasma sodium. All data analyses will be performed using SPSS 
14.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) or STATA 8.2 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).  All 
statistical tests will be two-sided. If these analyses indicate that the response to 
carbidopa differs between patients and controls, a mixed-effects model will be 
developed to describe the time, medication and group effects. Sponsors (federal, state,

61.A.  Protocol Overview
The purpose of the proposed research is to determine how changes in kidney dopamine (DA) activity influence 
urinary sodium excretion. Dopamine in the kidney plays an important role in maintaining sodium balance.  We will 
decrease DA activity in the kidney by [CONTACT_198760].  We will compare the 
active agent with a placebo.  We also want to compare findings in normal volunteers and in patients with postural 
tachycardia syndrome (POTS). Some of these patients may not effectively regulate sodium excretion.  
1.B. Dose Escalation Study of Carbidopa
Prior to initiation of the main study, a dose escalation study will be conducted. A cohort consisting of one 
healthy volunteer and one participant with POTS will be administered a dose of 50mg carbidopa every 6 hours for a 
total of five doses. If this dosage is well-tolerated (see next paragraph), a second cohort will be given five doses of 
carbidopa 100mg with 6 hours between doses. If this dosage is well-tolerated, a final cohort will take the proposed 
dose of 200mg carbidopa every 6 hours for five doses. All participants in the dose escalation study will also take 
placebo every 6 hours for five doses, according to a crossover design, and will undergo the same measurements 
and procedures as described below for the main study. However, additional blood draws and monitoring will be
included. 
Specific aims of Dose Escalation Study. 
1.To assess tolerability of increasing doses (50mg, 100mg, 200mg) of carbidopa, as assessed by [CONTACT_90660], complete blood count (CBC), chemistry panel, liver function biomarkers, and a Psychiatric Symptom 
Questionnaire.
2.To assess plasma carbidopa levels after different doses of carbidopa.
3.To obtain preliminary data on the changes in plasma and urinary levels of catecholamines and urinary 
sodium excretion following oral administration of different doses of carbidopa.
4.To obtain preliminary data on the effect of oral administration of different doses of carbidopa on orthostatic 
changes in heart rate and blood pressure, as well as symptoms.
5.To compare the tolerability, as well as catecholamine, diuretic, and cardiovascular responses following 
orally administered carbidopa in participants with POTS with those of healthy volunteers.
To accomplish these aims:
Pre-study assessments consist of 1) 12-lead ECG; 2) complete blood count (CBC) with 
platelets; 3) chemistry panel including albumin, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, serum 
glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase
(SGPT) to evaluate liver function; and 4) plasma carbidopa.

RDCRN ARD #6101 Peripheral Dopamine in POTS Protocol Version: [ADDRESS_237174] preliminary data showing that 
patients with POTS do not decrease urinary sodium excretion after 30-60 minutes of upright posture,
whereas healthy control participants do.  We also reported that plasma renin activity (PRA) and 
aldosterone are paradoxically low in POTS in view of the reduced plasma volume. This indicates that 
sodium handling is perturbed in POTS. We therefore expect that patients with POTS may benefit from 
a reduction in urinary sodium excretion or that carbidopa-mediated changes in sodium excretion may 
differ between patients with POTS and healthy volunteers.  
Hypothesis: In these studies, we will test the null hypothesis (H o) that the effect of oral carbidopa 
administration on urinary sodium excretion will not differ between participants with POTS and healthy 
volunteers.  
Research Question:  Does orally administered carbidopa, by [CONTACT_198771], decrease urinary dopamine and sodium excretion in POTS and normal participants? 
3.  Background
Synthesis and degradation of catecholamines. The synthesis of catecholamines is summarized in Figure 1.  
Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the rate-limiting step in norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (NE) synthesis under almost all circumstances. 
NE acts as a feedback inhibitor of this enzyme. L-dopa (dopa) is the amino acid precursor of the endogenous 
catecholamines and the immediate product of TH.  L-Aromatic 
amino acid decarboxylase (AADC; also known as dopa 
decarboxylase or DDC) converts dopa to dopamine (DA) in both 
nonneural and neural tissues.  Dopamine-ß-hydroxylase (DBH), 
which converts DA to NE, is localized in vesicles of noradrenergic 
neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems and in the 
adrenal medulla.  Phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PNMT; 
NE to epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (EPI)) is restricted to the adrenal medulla, the 
brain, and the heart, with only trace amounts in other locations.  Does orally administered carbidopa, by [CONTACT_198772], by [CONTACT_198771], decrease urinary dopamine and sodium excretion in POTS and normal dopa, decrease urinary dopamine and sodium excretion in POTS and normal volume regulation contribute to POTS pathophysiology.volume regulation contribute to POTS pathophysiology.

10The fate of released catecholamines includes a) uptake into the neuron by [CONTACT_198773][INVESTIGATOR_29906] (NET; 
uptake I), b) uptake by [CONTACT_198774] (EMT; uptake II), or c) metabolic transformation. 
Intraneuronal NE is converted to dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG) by [CONTACT_40021] (MAO)[7].  Catechol-O-
methyltransferase (COMT) converts extraneuronal NE into normetanephrine (NMN), EPI [INVESTIGATOR_198710] (MN), 
and DA into 3-methoxytyramine (MT).  DA that is not transported into the DBH-containing vesicles is deaminated by 
[CONTACT_198775] 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) which is subsequently O-methylated by [CONTACT_198776] (HVA). The corresponding metabolite for NE is vanillylmandelic acid (VMA).
Functions of dopamine. In the brain, dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter, activating the five main types of 
dopamine receptor - D1, D2, D3, D4 and D5. Brain DA has been implicated in the control of movement and reward 
systems.  Dopamine, administered as a medication clinically, acts on the sympathetic nervous system to produce 
effects such as increased heart rate and blood pressure. Effects of DA are dose-related and dependent on the 
localization and characteristics of the receptors with which it interacts. At very low doses (1 to 2 ug/kg/min), it 
dilates renal and mesenteric blood vessels and increases renal blood flow, principally by [CONTACT_198777] -adrenergic receptors 
and elevates arterial pressure. Since it cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, peripherally given dopamine does not 
directly affect the central nervous system. 
Dopamine as an autocrine/paracrine substance.  In addition to its role as a neurotransmitter and as a precursor 
to NE and EPI, non-neuronal DA also acts as a paracrine or autocrine substance, originating in the gastrointestinal 
tract and the kidney.  In the gut, DA is produced endogenously and is also derived from dietary sources.  DA 
undergoes sulfate conjugation in gastrointestinal tissues, and at least 95% of circulating DA occurs in the 
sulfoconjugated form. Ingestion of a standard meal or bananas raise plasma dopamine sulfate concentration more 
than 50-fold, whereas plasma dopa and DA increase much less[5;13].  Twelve hours of fasting have been shown to 
eliminate dopamine sulfate that comes from a dietary source[23]. Sulfoconjugation may contribute to a gut-blood 
barrier and limit the amount of ingested catecholamines that enter the bloodstream[13].  
Renal dopamine and sodium excretion.  In the kidney, DA is synthesized from circulating dopa in non-neuronal 
tissue and exerts local effects to facilitate natriuresis.  Renal DA is metabolized by [CONTACT_198778]. The supply of 
dopa to the kidney is the primary regulatory factor for intrarenal non-neuronal DA synthesis[9]. Dopa is taken up 
into proximal tubule cells by a sodium-dependent process[27] and is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_198711].  Intrarenal DA induces natriuresis by [CONTACT_198779]+K+-ATPase pump and the Na-H exchanger. High salt intake in Caucasians produces a significant and 
sustained increase in urine DA output[12].  An increase in the filtered load of sodium promotes uptake of dopa by 
[CONTACT_198780][26;32], and AADC activity is also up-regulated by [CONTACT_198781][14]. Saline loading may also be 
associated with decreased renal degradation of DA by [CONTACT_150654][25] to 3MT and eventually to HVA. Carbidopa, by 
[CONTACT_198782], will prevent a rise in renal DA under high-sodium conditions. A low-salt 
diet, in contrast, decreases renal and urinary dopa and DA, without significantly changing plasma dopa[12].  DA 
exerts its renal actions through two families of receptors, designated D1-like and D2-like[20], which are identical in 
the brain and in peripheral tissues. The two D1-like receptors (D1 and D5) are linked to stimulation of adenylyl 
cyclase. D2, D3, and D4 are linked to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Inhibition by [CONTACT_198783]+K+-ATPase pump is 
thought to be mediated by D1 receptors.  D2 receptors may increase glomerular filtration rate and possibly 
contribute to natriuresis in the cortical collecting duct cells, but their role in the regulation of sodium excretion is not 
well understood[2]. 
The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system interacts with the renal dopaminergic system to regulate plasma volume 
in humans. In response to DA, hypovolemia, a decrease in sodium, or an increase in renal sympathetic nerve 
activity, plasma renin activity is stimulated to produce angiotensin II.  Angiotensin stimulates sodium reabsorption 
directly and also stimulates the release and synthesis of aldosterone, a mineral corticoid hormone that causes the 
retention of sodium, increasing fluid volume. Further modulation of natriuresis is achieved by [CONTACT_151183]-mediated 
attenuation of aldosterone secretion[4]. 
Dopamine in cardiovascular regulation. This renal autocrine-paracrine function, which has heretofore been most 
evident during extracellular fluid volume expansion, is lost in essential hypertension[1] and in some animal models 
of genetic hypertension[3;18;21;24].

signal transduction by [CONTACT_198787], and an impaired ability to increase urinary sodium 
excretion following a DA agonist[8], resulting in decreased sodium reabsorption[19]. This has been linked to an 
uncoupling of the D1 receptor from the G protein complex as a result of a GRK4 polymorphism[19]. 
Postural tachycardia syndrome. Postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is the most common form of orthostatic 
intolerance, affecting an estimated 500,000 Americans, principally young women. POTS refers to an excessive 
increase in heart rate (>30 beats per minute) on standing in the absence of orthostatic hypotension.  Patients 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_198712]. POTS can 
produce substantial disability among otherwise healthy people.  The pathophysiology of POTS is heterogeneous 
and poorly understood.  Many of these patients have elevated levels of plasma NE, particularly when upright.  
Subgroups of patients have a primary hyperadrenergic state, while others suffer from a partial dysautonomia 
affecting the lower limbs.  
Plasma volume and its orthostatic shift in POTS. One of 
the most consistent findings in POTS is a reduction in plasma 
volume or blood volume (Figure 2 )[10;11;17;29;31].
Furthermore, there are additional decrements in plasma 
volume due to orthostatic volume shifts[16;28].  The marked 
interindividual variation in the POTS group, with some patients 
having a volume shift that is well within the normal range, 
suggests that the POTS population is quite heterogeneous in 
terms of this variable.  
Previous findings by [CONTACT_198788]. We have 
preliminary data showing that patients with POTS do not 
decrease urinary sodium excretion after 30-60 minutes of 
upright posture, whereas healthy control participants do 
(Figure 3 ).  We also reported that PRA and aldosterone are 
paradoxically low in POTS in view of the reduced plasma volume. This indicates that sodium handling is perturbed 
in POTS.  Several investigators have implicated dopamine in the control of natriuresis in other disorders. 
Approximately 50% of sodium excretion appears to be under dopaminergic regulation. 
Uptake of dopa into the proximal tubule cells and its subsequent 
decarboxylation to DA are stimulated by a high salt diet. Carbidopa 
inhibits the activity of AADC in the periphery.  By [CONTACT_198789], it has the potential to attenuate the effects 
of the sodium load on renal DA production and urinary sodium 
excretion.  However, since carbidopa also inhibits dopa 
decarboxylation in peripheral neurons, it can increase plasma dopa 
levels and the filtered load of dopa in the kidney.  The final effect of 
carbidopa on renal DA production is therefore the result of increased 
substrate and decreased decarboxylation[12].
Recommended dosages of carbidopa for the treatment of Parkinson’s
disease, as Sinemet, are at least 70-100 mg, up to 200 mg daily 
(AHFS Drug Information 2007).  Yet, Durso et al.[6] speculated that 
“doses used in current practice” are not saturating for the 
decarboxylase enzyme. Kaufmann et al.[22] and Hershey et al.[15]
administered one dose of 200 mg carbidopa to ensure that the 
decarboxylase was completely inhibited. Stokes et al.[30] proposed that more than one dose of carbidopa must be 
given to see an effect on renal salt handling.  Based on this information and a carbidopa half-life of about [ADDRESS_237176] of decrease urinary sodium excretion after 30decrease urinary sodium excretion after 30

12The following studies are designed to compare the influence of plasma dopa levels on plasma and urinary 
catecholamines in participants with POTS and healthy volunteers and to assess subsequent effects on sodium 
excretion.  We will evaluate the roles of peripheral dopa and DA in POTS by [CONTACT_198792]. Study participants will consume a relatively 
high-salt diet to “turn on” the dopaminergic regulation of sodium excretion.  The dosage of carbidopa may be 
modified to attenuate or intensify the responses, not to exceed 1000mg in a 24hr period. 
4.  Study Design and Methods
We will determine whether inhibition of renal DA formation by [CONTACT_198770] a decrease in 
urinary excretion of DA and sodium and whether the response differs in POTS and control populations. Carbidopa 
effects will be compared to those of a matching placebo, and the sequence of treatments (carbidopa before 
placebo or placebo before carbidopa) will be randomized. The study is double-blinded.  The investigational 
pharmacy at Vanderbilt Medical Center determines the randomization and the treatment order. The same crossover 
design is used for both the dose escalation and main studies.   
Recruitment. The participants with POTS will be recruited for both dose escalation and main studies from patients 
referred to the Vanderbilt University Autonomic Dysfunction Center.  Control participants will be recruited from 
healthy volunteers known to the Autonomic Dysfunction Center, through the ResearchMatch.org database, and

174.G Data Elements-Main Study
A minimum of 9 days is needed to complete the study with 2 nights on the CRC for the active compound 
and 2 nights for the placebo.
Participants will be provided a 200 mEq/day sodium diet, free of methylxanthines and low in 
monoamines, by [CONTACT_198768] (CRC).
After achieving sodium balance on the study diet over 2-[ADDRESS_237188] urine over 24hr 
starting at 0700hr, for baseline assessment of sodium, potassium and catecholamines and to confirm 
adherence to the study diet. 
Participants will be admitted to the CRC that afternoon or evening.
In the morning, while still supi[INVESTIGATOR_198715], HR and BP will be recorded with a 
Dinamap electrocardiographic and blood pressure (brachial cuff) recorder, and blood will be drawn for a 
basic metabolic panel, fractionated catecholamines, aldosterone and plasma renin activity. The 
participants will then stand for [ADDRESS_237189] 24hr urine collection. Another 24hr urine collection will then be started for analysis of sodium, 
potassium and creatinine. This may take the form of one 24 hr sample or two 4 hr collection samples

20The NINDS has reviewed the risk associated with this study, and the following safety monitoring will be 
implemented:
The Study Chair will appoint an NINDS approved Independent Medical Monitor (IMM) to review all adverse 
events that are serious, unexpected, and possibly/probably/definitely related to the study intervention in real 
time.
The IMM will also review cumulative AEs. The frequency of review of cumulative AEs will be determined by [CONTACT_198795] 12 months.
The site’s Primary Investigator and the research team (co-Investigators, research nurses, clinical trial 
coordinators, and data managers) are responsible for identifying adverse events. Aggregate report- detailed by 
[CONTACT_926], attribution (expected or unexpected), and relationship to the study drug/study procedures – will be 
available from the DMCC for site review.  Adverse events will be reviewed regularly by [CONTACT_5051].   A 
separate report detailing protocol compliance will also be available from the DMCC for site review on a monthly 
basis. 
Adverse events will be monitored on an ongoing basis by [CONTACT_6283]. David Robertson and Emily Garland.   
 RN will be responsible for tracking adverse events in this study.  Any adverse event of a serious or 
greater nature will be reviewed immediately with the P.I.  Drs Robertson and Garland and  will 
convene monthly to discuss the progress of the study and any issues concerning data collection and safety.
  
Serious adverse events will be reported in writing to the Vanderbilt IRB, with copi[INVESTIGATOR_198734], within 24 hours of occurrence.  All study adverse events will be summarized once a year, as part of 
the annual review report to the IRB.
  
The adverse event will be described with the following information: description of the event; outcome of the 
event; duration of the event; relationship to study procedure; requirement, if any, for treatment or intervention; 
and outcome.
Adverse events will be graded according to the following scale:
0 = No adverse event or within normal limits
1 = Mild adverse event (transient and mild in nature, and no treatment is necessary)
2 = Moderate adverse event (some intervention and treatment are necessary, but participant completely   
  recovers
3 = Severe adverse event 
4 = Life-threatening or disabling adverse event
5 = Death related to adverse event
The investigator will state his opi[INVESTIGATOR_198735] a reasonable possibility that the event or experience 
is related to a procedure performed as part of this study.”
5.A Study Oversight
The study protocol will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_7681] (NIH) before submission to 
individual center IRB’s for approval. Participant enrollment may only begin with IRB approved consent forms.
This is a phase II study that meets the federal definition of moderate risk.
The Study Chair has primary oversight responsibility of this clinical trial. The Autonomic Consortium will review
accrual, patterns and frequencies of all adverse events, and protocol compliance at least every 6 months.

5.C Expected/Known Risks/Discomforts/Adverse Events Associated with Study 
Intervention and Procedures: Definition of Expected Adverse Events 
Study Drug/Intervention: Carbidopa / Placebo
Drug Information for STUDY DRUG
Carbidopa, an inhibitor of aromatic amino acid decarboxylation, is a white, crystalline compound, slightly soluble in 
water, with a molecular weight of 244.3. It is designated chemically as (—)-L- hydrazino- -methyl- -(3,4-
dihydroxybenzene) propanoic acid monohydrate. Its empi[INVESTIGATOR_24598] C 10H14N2O4•H2O, and its structural formula 
is:
Tablet content is expressed in terms of anhydrous carbidopa which has a molecular weight of 226.3.
LODOSYN (Carbidopa) tablets contain 25 mg of carbidopa. Inactive ingredients are cellulose, FD&C Yellow 6, 
magnesium stearate and starch.
Human Toxicity/ Adverse Events (adapted from package insert)
Carbidopa has not been demonstrated to have any overt pharmacodynamic actions in the recommended doses. 
The only adverse reactions that have been observed have been with concomitant use of carbidopa with other drugs 
such as levodopa, and with carbidopa-levodopa combination products.  Common adverse events with the 
carbidopa-levodopa combination include abnormal body movements and nausea.  Less common adverse effects 
are psychotic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (periods of confused thinking which can include hearing voices, seeing things that are not 
real, believing things that are not true and/or strange behavior), depression and dementia (loss of mental ability 
severe enough to cause problems with normal activities of daily living). Rarely, there is an allergic reaction to the 
FD&C Yellow 6 dye. The dose in this study is a much higher dose than used in clinical practice, and there may be 
additional side effects that are not known at this time.  This medication has never been used at this dose or 
frequency.
Study Procedures:Venipuncture:  The vein in which the needle has been inserted to draw blood may become sore and red.  A 
temporary “black and blue mark” may develop, and rarely fainting may occur.

o Is Unexpected/Unanticipated 
Investigators must report all other reportable SAEs within 5 working days (of learning of the event).
All other (suspected) reportable AEs must be reported to the RDCRN within 20 working days of the notification 
of the event or of the site becoming aware of the event.
Local institutional reporting requirements to IRBs, any Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational 
Research/Clinical Research Center (VICTR/CRC) oversight committee and the FDA, if appropriate, remain the
responsibility of the site investigator and the Study Chair.
5.E RDCRN Adverse Event Data Management System (AEDAMS) 
Upon entry of a serious adverse event by a site investigator, the DMCC created Adverse Event Data Management 
System (AEDAMS) will immediately notify the Study Chair and the Independent Medical Monitor.  
The Study Chair is responsible for notifying the appropriate NINDS staff.
Serious adverse events: The site investigator determines causality (definitely not related, probably not related, 
possibly related, probably related, definitely related) of the adverse event. The IMM will also review the SAE 
incident report.
The IMM may request further information if necessary and possibly suggest changes to the protocol or consent 
form to the NINDS as a consequence of  adverse events.  The Adverse Event Data Management System 
(AEDAMS) maintains audit trails and stores data (and data updated) and communication related to any adverse 
event in the study.  
Non-serious expected adverse events: Except those listed above as immediately reportable, non-serious expected adverse events  that are reported to or observed by [CONTACT_1720] a member of his research team will be 
submitted to the DMCC in a timely fashion (within 20 working days). The events will be presented in tabular form 
and given to the IMM at least once every [ADDRESS_237197] aggregate reports of all adverse events (serious/not serious and expected, unexpected) for site

As much as possible data quality is assessed at the data entry point using intelligent on-line data entry via visual 
basic designed screen forms. Data element constraints, whether independent range and/or format limitations or 
‘relative’ referential integrity limitations, can be enforced by [CONTACT_5057]. QA reports assess 
data quality post-data entry. As we note, data quality begins with the design of the data collection forms and 
procedures and incorporates reasonable checks to minimize transcription and omission errors.  Of the more 
important quality assurance measures are the internal validity checks for reasonableness and consistency. 
Data Monitoring: The RDCRN DMCC identifies missing or unclear data and generates a data query to the 
consortium administrator contact. 
Data Delinquency Tracking: The Data Management and Coordinating Center will monitor data delinquency 
on an ongoing basis.
6.  Statistical Considerations
Individual data will be reviewed for the Dose Escalation Study with the post-dose data compared to pre-dosing 
data. The data for each cohort will be summarized for review by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. David Robertson and the IMM of this study.The 
primary outcome is the urinary sodium concentration normalized to creatinine. Differences in urinary sodium in 
samples (1) collected at baseline vs. those collected following treatment (time effect) and (2) collected after placebo 
vs. carbidopa (treatment effect) will be assessed using a paired t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test.  Differences 
between the patient and control groups (group effect) will be assessed using a student’s t-test and a Mann-Whitney 
U test.  Similar methods will be used to compare secondary outcome measures, such as BP, HR, plasma and 
urinary catecholamines, plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone, and plasma sodium. All data analyses will be 
performed using SPSS 18.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) or STATA 8.2 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).  All statistical 
tests will be two-sided. A mixed-effects model will be developed to describe the time, medication and group effects. 
Sample Size Calculation . Based on our preliminary findings of a standard deviation for urinary sodium excretion of 
30 mEq/g creatinine, a sample size of 16/group (32 total) will have 80% power to detect a difference in group 
means (control vs. POTS) of 31 mEq/g creatinine with a 0.05 two-sided significance level. To allow for participant
drop-out prior to study completion, we will plan to obtain informed consent from 35 participants in total (18 POTS, 
17 healthy controls). 
Randomization procedures were performed by  [CONTACT_198798]’s 
Investigational Pharmacy. Prior to admission, the pharmacy is notified whether the participant is a patient or healthy 
volunteer and the Investigational Pharmacist determines the treatment order (placebo or carbidopa first). At the end
of the study, the blinding will be broken by [CONTACT_198799], if they so request.
7. Data Management
The investigators, research personnel and nursing staff at the CRC will collect the majority of the data at the 
bedside in real time.  Data will be handwritten on CRFs provided by [CONTACT_198800], PhD.  Routine labs are sent to

Lab for analysis.  Laboratory data will be obtained from Vanderbilt Medical Center’s online medical chart system 
(StarPanel) and from the GCRC Core Laboratory website, both of which are password protected and only
authorized personnel have access.  After all data points have been retrieved, a member of the research team will 
enter the data into the DMCC database, which is also password protected and only accessible to authorized 
personnel.  Data analysis will be performed routinely for periodic review. Hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_198739]’s research chart in a locked cabinet. Study participation will be complete following the

to the participant’s eligibility as per protocol criteria and obtain appropriate informed consent. IRB approval for the 
protocol must be on file at the DMCC before accrual can occur from the clinical site.
The DMCC will use a system of coded identifiers to protect participant confidentiality.  Each participant enrolled will 
be assigned a local identifier by [CONTACT_66131].  This number can be a combination of the site identifier 
(location code) and a serial accession number.  Only the registering site will have access to the linkage between 
this number and the personal identifier of the participant.  When the participant is registered to participate in the 
study, using the DMCC provided web-based registration system, the system will assign a participant ID 
number.  Thus each participant will have two codes: the local one that can be used by [CONTACT_198803] a second code assigned by [CONTACT_66100].  For all data transfers to the DMCC both numbers 
will be required to uniquely identify the participant.  In this fashion, it is possible to protect against data keying 
errors, digit transposition or other mistakes when identifying a participant for data entry since the numbers should 
match to properly identify the participant.  In this fashion, no personal identifiers would be accessible to the DMCC. 
7.B Data Entry
Data collection for this study will be accomplished with online electronic case report forms.  Using encrypted 
communication links, on-line forms will be developed that contain the requisite data fields.

All data and research specimens will be maintained by [CONTACT_198804], M.D. following study termination for an 
indeterminate period of time. 
Laboratory specimens, especially for catecholamine determination, are kept in the Core Lab.  Specimens are 
secured in a frozen state in a locked –70° freezer.  The results are entered into the CRC Core Lab password-
protected database.
8.  Human Participants
All patients who contact [CONTACT_198805].   Most of them find us because we have a website.  If they complete the screening process (IRB #030751) 
and meet the criteria for the study, i.e. have difficulty maintaining a standing posture, have classic symptoms 
(palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], dizziness, difficulty thinking, chest tightness) while upright or have heart rate changes and high 
plasma catecholamines on standing, they may be eligible to participate.  
The participants are screened on the CRC where pertinent heart rate, blood pressure, history and laboratory data 
are obtained to make sure that they are appropriate and can tolerate this study. Study personnel will be

8.A Human participants involvement and characteristics 
Inclusion of vulnerable groups: 
No ethnic group is targeted or excluded. 
Inclusion of Women. To the extent possible, patient and control groups will include approximately equal numbers 
of males and females. However, postural tachycardia syndrome is far more common in women than in men. Based 
upon prior experience, we anticipate a patient population that is approximately 80% female and 20% male 
Inclusion of Minorities. The ethnic composition of Nashville is ~79.4% non-Hispanic white American, 15.6% black 
American, 1.7% Asian and Pacific Islander, 0.3% American Indian and Alaska Native, and 3% Hispanic.  In the 
literature on postural tachycardia syndrome, breakdown of study participants by [CONTACT_198806].  No 
one to our knowledge has reported a race-based difference in the frequency of this category of illness. However, 
investigators who see substantial numbers of tertiary referrals of patients with the postural tachycardia syndrome, 
including ourselves, encounter this disease only rarely in African-Americans, and believe this may reflect a true 
difference in susceptibility. Through the alliance between Vanderbilt and the historically African-American Meharry 
Medical College, in Nashville, we will attempt to enrich our study population by [CONTACT_198807]-American patients 
for evaluation at our institution. 
8.B Informed consent
Written informed consent will be obtained from each participant before any study-specific procedures or
assessments are done and after the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and potential hazards are explained.  The 
participant’s willingness to participate in the study will be documented in writing in a consent form, which will be 
signed by [CONTACT_5079].  The investigator will keep the original consent 
forms and signed copi[INVESTIGATOR_198741].  It will also be explained to the participants that they are 
free to refuse entry into the study and free to withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to future 
treatment.  Written and/or oral information about the study in a language understandable by [CONTACT_198808].

8.C Potential risks
1. There is the inconvenience of having to sleep on the CRC for several nights.
2. Intravenous catheter placement and blood sampling can cause bruising, pain and infection.
3. Collecting urine can be inconvenient and embarrassing.
4. Blood pressure measurements with a cuff on the arm can be uncomfortable.  
5. Drawing blood for analysis can cause discomfort or bruising. 
6. Standing upright may cause lightheadedness, blurred vision, rapid heartbeat, headache and nausea. 
7. Carbidopa – only reported to have adverse effects when it is given with the drug levodopa for Parkinson’s 
disease.  Less common adverse effects are allergies, psychotic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], depression and dementia.
However, the dosage used in this study is higher than typi[INVESTIGATOR_44800]. We will therefore do a dose 
escalation study to assess the tolerability of the 200mg carbidopa dose that we propose to use in the main 
study.

APPENDIX 1a  Sample Informed Consent Form for Main Study - POTS
This informed consent applies to Participants with Postural Tachycardia Syndrome
Name [CONTACT_7481]: _________________________________________________________ Age: ___________
The following is given to you to tell you about this research study.  Please read this form with care and ask any 
questions you may have about this study.  Your questions will be answered.  Also, you will be given a copy of this 
consent form.  
You do not have to be in this research study. You can stop being in this study at any time.  If we learn 
something new that may affect the risks or benefits of this study, you will be told so that you can decide 
whether or not you still want to be in this study.    
1. What is the purpose of this study? 
You are being asked to take part in this research study because you have been diagnosed with Postural 
Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS).  A chemical in the kidney called dopamine plays an important role in maintaining 
your body’s salt levels.  We will give you a drug called carbidopa that interferes with the formation of dopamine in 
the kidney, and we will measure how much salt is then excreted in your urine.  This drug has been used for many 
years at lower doses to treat Parkinson’s disease.  We will also measure your blood pressure and heart rate and 
some chemicals in your blood and urine that control them.  We will compare the effects of this drug to those of a 
sugar pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382].  You will take the drug and the sugar pi[INVESTIGATOR_198745] (Treatment A and Treatment B), but you will 
not be told which one you are taking on a given day. We expect to enroll 16 participants with POTS and 16 healthy 
volunteers.
2. What will happen and how long will you be in the study?
This study is being conducted at the Vanderbilt Clinical Research Center (CRC).  You will be asked some questions 
about your health other than POTS.  One of the investigators will explain the study to you and ask you to sign this 
consent form.  A copy of the consent form will be given to you.  Your participation is voluntary.

Urine CollectionYou will collect your urine for [ADDRESS_237210] pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] (active drug or sugar pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]) and for the 
next 24 hours (study day 1).  After the last pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], on the second study day, you will collect samples over the first 4 
hours, from 4-8 hours, and from 8-24 hours.  The urine will be analyzed for sodium, potassium and for hormones 
that control blood pressure and heart rate.
Vital signsVital signs (blood pressure and heart rate) will be measured several times while you are lying down just before and 
after the treatment.  Sometimes you will be asked to stand quietly for [ADDRESS_237211] 2 samples of your blood during study day 1 and 6 samples 
during study day 2 (a total of 6 tablespoons per treatment and 12 tablespoons for the complete protocol) for 
measurement of the hormones that control blood pressure.  We will also measure sodium in your blood when you 
complete the pre-study 24hr-urine collection and the [ADDRESS_237212] a small plastic tube (catheter) in your arm 
vein.  The samples will be 2-3 teaspoons each. 
Drug testingIn the evening prior to study day 1, you will be admitted to the Vanderbilt Clinical Research Center. In the morning, 
a small tube (catheter) will be placed in your arm vein in order to draw blood.   Baseline blood pressure and heart 
rate readings will be obtained and blood samples will be collected in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (lying on your back) and upright 
positions. You will void to finish the pre-study 24hr urine collection.  You will then be given a pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], either the active 
drug or the sugar pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]. Whether you receive the active pi[INVESTIGATOR_198746] A will be decided by a 
procedure similar to tossing a coin. You will receive the other kind of pi[INVESTIGATOR_198747] B. The medication will be 
given by [CONTACT_1966], every [ADDRESS_237213] 30 minutes before each of the measurements.

32There are minor risks and discomforts associated with blood sampling .  We will insert a plastic catheter into the 
vein to allow drawing blood without repeated sticks during the study.  This may cause a brief period of pain and 
possibly a small bruise at the site.  Occasionally, a person feels faint when their blood is drawn.  Rarely, an 
infection develops which can be treated.  There is a small risk of bleeding after removal of the catheter and possibly 
a bruise at the site which can be prevented by [CONTACT_198817].  
Collecting your urine might be inconvenient for you.  We try to make it more convenient by [CONTACT_198818] a 
collection device and/or providing a urinal for your use.
The study days might seem tedious and boring because they require you to lie down for an extended period of 
time before your blood pressure is monitored.  
Carbidopa  – When any medication is used in testing, there is a small risk of an unforeseeable life-threatening 
allergic reaction.  Side effects of Carbidopa have only been reported when it is given with the drug levodopa for 
Parkinson’s disease at lower dosages than are being evaluated in this study.  Common adverse events with the 
carbidopa-levodopa combination include abnormal body movements and nausea.  Less common adverse effects 
are allergies, psychotic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (periods of confused thinking which can include hearing voices, seeing things that 
are not real, believing things that are not true and/or strange behavior), depression and dementia (loss of mental 
ability severe enough to cause problems with normal activities of daily living).  The dose you will receive in this 
study is a much higher dose than used in clinical practice, and there may be additional side effects that are not 
known at this time.  This medication has never been used at this dose or frequency.
5. Risks that are not known:
Because the medications might be harmful to an unborn child, adequate birth control measures (i.e., oral, implanted 
or barrier methods) must be used by [CONTACT_198819].  If you become pregnant or father a child while in this study, you must notify your physician immediately.  In 
addition, women must not breastfeed while in this study.  To rule out pregnancy prior to receiving treatment in this 
study, women of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test.
6. Payment in case you are injured while in this study:
If you are injured because you are in this study, you can get reasonable, immediate, and necessary medical care 
for your injury at Vanderbilt without charge to you. There are no plans for Vanderbilt to pay for the costs of care 
beyond your injury, or to give you money for such injury. There is no program for compensation through the 
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)/National Institutes of Health (NIH).
7. Good effects that might result from this study:   
The benefits to science and humankind that might result from this study are: a better understanding of the relationship between the plasma and urinary chemicals that we will measure and sodium excretion.  
The benefits you might get from being in this study are: this study might provide insight into the effectiveness of a 
potential treatment for your disorder and provide either direct or indirect benefit to your medical care.
8. Other treatments you could get if you decide not to be in this study:
You may choose not to participate in this study.  
9. Payments for your time spent taking part in this study or expenses:
You will not be paid for taking part in this study.
10. Reasons why the study doctor may take you out of this study:  
The investigators or Vanderbilt may stop you from taking part in this study at any time if it is in your best interest, if 
you do not follow the study rules, or if the study is stopped.Good effects that might result from this study:Good effects that might result from this study:

This informed consent applies to Healthy Volunteers
Name [CONTACT_7481]: _________________________________________________________ Age: ___________
The following is given to you to tell you about this research study.  Please read this form with care and ask any 
questions you may have about this study.  Your questions will be answered.  Also, you will be given a copy of this 
consent form.  
You do not have to be in this research study. You can stop being in this study at any time.  If we learn 
something new that may affect the risks or benefits of this study, you will be told so that you can decide 
whether or not you still want to be in this study.    
1. What is the purpose of this study? 
You are being asked to take part in this research study because you are a healthy volunteer.  Data obtained from 
healthy persons will be compared with data from participants who have a condition called postural tachycardia 
syndrome.  A chemical in the kidney called dopamine plays an important role in maintaining your body’s salt levels.  
We will give you a drug called carbidopa that interferes with the formation of dopamine in the kidney, and we will 
measure how much salt is then excreted in your urine.  This drug has been used for many years at lower doses to 
treat Parkinson’s disease.  We will also measure your blood pressure and heart rate and some chemicals in your 
blood and urine that control them.  We will compare the effects of this drug to those of a sugar pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382].  You will take the 
drug and the sugar pi[INVESTIGATOR_198751] (Treatment A and Treatment B), but you will not be told which one you 
are taking on a given day. We plan to enroll 16 participants with POTS and 16 healthy volunteers.      
2. What will happen and how long will you be in the study?
This study is being conducted at the Vanderbilt Clinical Research Center (CRC).  You will be asked some questions 
to ensure that you are in good health.  One of the investigators will explain the study to you and ask you to sign this 
consent form.  A copy of the consent form will be given to you.  Your participation is voluntary.

36Vital signs
Vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate) will be measured several times while you are lying down just before and 
after the treatment.  Sometimes you will be asked to stand quietly for [ADDRESS_237223] 2 samples of your blood during study day 1 and 6 samples 
during study day 2 (a total of 6 tablespoons per treatment and 12 tablespoons for the complete protocol) for 
measurement of the hormones that control blood pressure.  We will also measure sodium in your blood when you 
complete the pre-study 24hr-urine collection and the [ADDRESS_237224] a small plastic tube (catheter) in your arm

38There are minor risks and discomforts associated with blood sampling .  We will insert a plastic catheter into the 
vein to allow drawing blood without repeated sticks during the study.  This may cause a brief period of pain and 
possibly a small bruise at the site.  Occasionally, a person feels faint when their blood is drawn.  Rarely, an 
infection develops which can be treated.  There is a small risk of bleeding after removal of the catheter and possibly 
a bruise at the site which can be prevented by [CONTACT_198823].  We try to make it more convenient by [CONTACT_198818] a 
collection device and/or providing a urinal for your use.
The study days might seem tedious and boring because they require you to lie down for an extended period of 
time before your blood pressure is monitored.  
Carbidopa  – When any medication is used in testing, there is a small risk of an unforeseeable life-threatening 
allergic reaction.  Side effects of Carbidopa have only been reported when it is given with the drug levodopa for 
Parkinson’s disease at lower dosages than are being evaluated in this study.  Common adverse events with the 
carbidopa-levodopa combination include abnormal body movements and nausea.  Less common adverse effects 
are allergies, psychotic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (periods of confused thinking which can include hearing voices, seeing things that 
are not real, believing things that are not true and/or strange behavior), depression and dementia (loss of mental 
ability severe enough to cause problems with normal activities of daily living).  The dose you will receive in this 
study is a much higher dose than used in clinical practice, and there may be additional side effects that are not 
known at this time.  This medication has never been used at this dose or frequency.
5. Risks that are not known:
Because the medications might be harmful to an unborn child, adequate birth control measures (i.e., oral, implanted 
or barrier methods) must be used by [CONTACT_198819].  If you become pregnant or father a child while in this study, you must notify your physician immediately.  In 
addition, women must not breastfeed while in this study.  To rule out pregnancy prior to receiving treatment in this 
study, women of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test.
6. Payment in case you are injured while in this study:
If you are injured because you are in this study, you can get reasonable, immediate, and necessary medical care 
for your injury at Vanderbilt without charge to you. There are no plans for Vanderbilt to pay for the costs of care 
beyond your injury, or to give you money for such injury. There is no program for compensation through the 
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)/National Institutes of Health (NIH).
7. Good effects that might result from this study:   
The benefits to science and humankind that might result from this study are: a better understanding of the relationship between the plasma and urinary chemicals that we will measure and sodium excretion. The benefits 
you might get from being in this study are: none anticipated.
8. Other treatments you could get if you decide not to be in this study:
You may choose not to participate in this study.

41APPENDIX 1c: Sample Informed Consent Form for Dose Escalation Study–  POTS
This informed consent applies to Participants with POTS
Name [CONTACT_7481]: _________________________________________________________ Age: ___________
The following is given to you to tell you about this research study.  Please read this form with care and ask any 
questions you may have about this study.  Your questions will be answered.  Also, you will be given a copy of this 
consent form.  
You do not have to be in this research study. You can stop being in this study at any time.  If we learn 
something new that may affect the risks or benefits of this study, you will be told so that you can decide 
whether or not you still want to be in this study.    
1. What is the purpose of this study? 
You are being asked to take part in this research study because you have Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)
Data obtained from healthy persons will be compared with data from participants who have POTS.  A chemical in 
the kidney called dopamine plays an important role in maintaining your body’s salt levels.  We will give you a drug 
called carbidopa that interferes with the formation of dopamine in the kidney, and we will measure how much salt is 
then excreted in your urine.  This drug has been used for many years at lower doses to treat Parkinson’s disease.  
We will also measure your blood pressure and heart rate and some chemicals in your blood and urine that control 
them.  We will compare the effects of this drug to those of a sugar pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382].  You will take the drug and the sugar pi[INVESTIGATOR_198752] (Treatment A and Treatment B), but you will not be told which one you are taking on a given day.
Because we do not know what the best dose of carbidopa is, we are first doing this study to compare the effects of 
different doses. You will take 50 mg, 100 mg or 200 mg of carbidopa every 6 hours for 5 doses. We will monitor you 
for the effects we are studying and for any problems. Only if no problems occur after the 50 mg dose, we will enroll 
two more people at 100 mg, then 200 mg.  This is called “dose escalation”.  Although we do not expect the doses of 
carbidopa to cause any problems, we are doing this study to make sure that participants do not have any problems 
at each dose level before we enroll at a higher dose.  
2. What will happen and how long will you be in the study?
This study is being conducted at the Vanderbilt Clinical Research Center (CRC).  You will be asked some questions 
about your health other than POTS.  One of the investigators will explain the study to you and ask you to sign this 
consent form.  A copy of the consent form will be given to you.  Your participation is voluntary.

the amount of salt in it (see below).
Urine CollectionYou will collect your urine for [ADDRESS_237234] pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] (active drug or sugar pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]) and for the 
next 24 hours (study day 1).  After the last pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], on the second study day, you will collect samples over the first 4 
hours, from 4-8 hours, and from 8-24 hours.  The urine will be analyzed for sodium, potassium and for hormones 
that control blood pressure and heart rate.
Vital signsVital signs (blood pressure and heart rate) will be measured several times while you are lying down just before and 
following the last dose of the treatment.  As part of the dose escalation evaluation, we will also measure your blood 
pressure and heart rate 2 hours after every dose while you are lying down, including overnight. Sometimes you will 
be asked to stand quietly for 10 minutes for additional measurements.  A Dinamap, an automated blood pressure 
monitor that uses a cuff around your upper arm, is used for these measurements. An electrocardiogram (EKG) will 
be obtained before the first dose and after the 5thdose of Treatments A and B. 
Blood samplingFor Treatments A and B, as part of the safety evaluation, [ADDRESS_237235] a small plastic

44Staying in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_198750].
Being woken up during the night might be an inconvenience for you.
Frequent blood pressure measurements with the cuff around your arm may produce some discomfort and 
occasional bruising of the upper arm.
There are minor risks and discomforts associated with blood sampling .  We will insert a plastic catheter into the 
vein to allow drawing blood without repeated sticks during the study.  This may cause a brief period of pain and 
possibly a small bruise at the site.  Occasionally, a person feels faint when their blood is drawn.  Rarely, an 
infection develops which can be treated.  There is a small risk of bleeding after removal of the catheter and possibly 
a bruise at the site which can be prevented by [CONTACT_198823].  We try to make it more convenient by [CONTACT_198818] a 
collection device and/or providing a urinal for your use.
The study days might seem tedious and boring because they require you to lie down for an extended period of 
time before your blood pressure is monitored.  
Carbidopa  – When any medication is used in testing, there is a small risk of an unforeseeable life-threatening 
allergic reaction.  Side effects of Carbidopa have only been reported when it is given with the drug levodopa for 
Parkinson’s disease at lower dosages than are being evaluated in this study.  Common adverse events with the 
carbidopa-levodopa combination include abnormal body movements and nausea.  Less common adverse effects 
are allergies, psychotic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (periods of confused thinking which can include hearing voices, seeing things that 
are not real, believing things that are not true and/or strange behavior), depression and dementia (loss of mental 
ability severe enough to cause problems with normal activities of daily living).  The dose you will receive in this 
study will be between 50 mg – [ADDRESS_237243] dose or frequency.
5. Risks that are not known:
Because the medications might be harmful to an unborn child, adequate birth control measures (i.e., oral, implanted 
or barrier methods) must be used by [CONTACT_198819].  If you become pregnant or father a child while in this study, you must notify your physician immediately.  In 
addition, women must not breastfeed while in this study.  To rule out pregnancy prior to receiving treatment in this 
study, women of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test.
6. Payment in case you are injured while in this study:
If you are injured because you are in this study, you can get reasonable, immediate, and necessary medical care 
for your injury at Vanderbilt without charge to you. There are no plans for Vanderbilt to pay for the costs of care 
beyond your injury, or to give you money for such injury. There is no program for compensation through the 
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)/National Institutes of Health (NIH).
7. Good effects that might result from this study:   
The benefits to science and humankind that might result from this study are: a better understanding of the relationship between the plasma and urinary chemicals that we will measure and sodium excretion. The benefits 
you might get from being in this study are: none anticipated.

Volunteers 
This informed consent applies to Healthy Volunteers 
Name [CONTACT_7481]: _________________________________________________________ Age: ___________
The following is given to you to tell you about this research study.  Please read this form with care and ask any 
questions you may have about this study.  Your questions will be answered.  Also, you will be given a copy of this 
consent form.  
You do not have to be in this research study. You can stop being in this study at any time.  If we learn 
something new that may affect the risks or benefits of this study, you will be told so that you can decide 
whether or not you still want to be in this study.    
1.What is the purpose of this study? 
You are being asked to take part in this research study because you are a healthy volunteer.  Data obtained from 
healthy persons will be compared with data from participants who have POTS.  A chemical in the kidney called 
dopamine plays an important role in maintaining your body’s salt levels.  We will give you a drug called carbidopa 
that interferes with the formation of dopamine in the kidney, and we will measure how much salt is then excreted in 
your urine.  This drug has been used for many years at lower doses to treat Parkinson’s disease.  We will also 
measure your blood pressure and heart rate and some chemicals in your blood and urine that control them.  We will 
compare the effects of this drug to those of a sugar pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382].  You will take the drug and the sugar pi[INVESTIGATOR_198754] (Treatment A and Treatment B), but you will not be told which one you are taking on a given day. Because 
we do not know what the best dose of carbidopa is, we are first doing this study to compare the effects of different 
doses. You will take 50 mg, 100 mg or 200 mg of carbidopa every 6 hours for 5 doses. We will monitor you for the 
effects we are studying and for any problems. Only if no problems occur after the 50 mg dose, we will enroll two 
more people at 100 mg, then 200 mg.  This is called “dose escalation”.  Although we do not expect the doses of 
carbidopa to cause any problems, we are doing this study to make sure that participants do not have any problems 
at each dose level before we enroll at a higher dose.     
2. What will happen and how long will you be in the study?
This study is being conducted at the Vanderbilt Clinical Research Center (CRC).  You will be asked some questions 
to ensure that you are in good health.  One of the investigators will explain the study to you and ask you to sign this 
consent form.  A copy of the consent form will be given to you.  Your participation is voluntary.

Urine Collection
You will collect your urine for [ADDRESS_237248] pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] (active drug or sugar pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]) and for the 
next 24 hours (study day 1).  After the last pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], on the second study day, you will collect samples over the first 4 
hours, from 4-8 hours, and from 8-24 hours.  The urine will be analyzed for sodium, potassium and for hormones 
that control blood pressure and heart rate.
Vital signsVital signs (blood pressure and heart rate) will be measured several times while you are lying down just before and 
following the last dose of the treatment.  As part of the dose escalation evaluation, we will also measure your blood 
pressure and heart rate 2 hours after every dose while you are lying down, including overnight. Sometimes you will 
be asked to stand quietly for 10 minutes for additional measurements.  A Dinamap, an automated blood pressure 
monitor that uses a cuff around your upper arm, is used for these measurements. An electrocardiogram (EKG) will 
be obtained before the first dose and after the 5thdose of Treatments A and B. 
Blood samplingFor Treatments A and B, as part of the safety evaluation, [ADDRESS_237249] a small plastic 
tube (catheter) in your arm vein.  The total amount for the entire study with Treatments A and B will be about 16 
tablespoons. 
Drug testingIn the evening prior to study day 1, you will be admitted to the Vanderbilt Clinical Research Center. In the morning, 
a small tube (catheter) will be placed in your arm vein in order to draw blood.   Baseline blood pressure and heart 
rate readings will be obtained and blood samples will be collected in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (lying on your back) and upright 
positions. You will void to finish the pre-study 24hr urine collection.  You will then be given a pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], either the active

50Staying in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_198750].
Being woken up during the night might be an inconvenience for you.
Frequent blood pressure measurements with the cuff around your arm may produce some discomfort and 
occasional bruising of the upper arm.
   
There are minor risks and discomforts associated with blood sampling .  We will insert a plastic catheter into the 
vein to allow drawing blood without repeated sticks during the study.  This may cause a brief period of pain and 
possibly a small bruise at the site.  Occasionally, a person feels faint when their blood is drawn.  Rarely, an 
infection develops which can be treated.  There is a small risk of bleeding after removal of the catheter and possibly 
a bruise at the site which can be prevented by [CONTACT_198823].  We try to make it more convenient by [CONTACT_198818] a 
collection device and/or providing a urinal for your use.
The study days might seem tedious and boring because they require you to lie down for an extended period of 
time before your blood pressure is monitored.  
Carbidopa  – When any medication is used in testing, there is a small risk of an unforeseeable life-threatening 
allergic reaction.  Side effects of Carbidopa have only been reported when it is given with the drug levodopa for 
Parkinson’s disease at lower dosages than are being evaluated in this study.  Common adverse events with the 
carbidopa-levodopa combination include abnormal body movements and nausea.  Less common adverse effects 
are allergies, psychotic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (periods of confused thinking which can include hearing voices, seeing things that 
are not real, believing things that are not true and/or strange behavior), depression and dementia (loss of mental 
ability severe enough to cause problems with normal activities of daily living).  The dose you will receive in this 
study will be between 50 mg – [ADDRESS_237258] dose or frequency.
5. Risks that are not known:
Because the medications might be harmful to an unborn child, adequate birth control measures (i.e., oral, implanted 
or barrier methods) must be used by [CONTACT_198819].  If you become pregnant or father a child while in this study, you must notify your physician immediately.  In 
addition, women must not breastfeed while in this study.  To rule out pregnancy prior to receiving treatment in this 
study, women of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test.
6. Payment in case you are injured while in this study:
If you are injured because you are in this study, you can get reasonable, immediate, and necessary medical care 
for your injury at Vanderbilt without charge to you. There are no plans for Vanderbilt to pay for the costs of care 
beyond your injury, or to give you money for such injury. There is no program for compensation through the 
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)/National Institutes of Health (NIH).
7. Good effects that might result from this study:  
The benefits to science and humankind that might result from this study are: a better understanding of the relationship between the plasma and urinary chemicals that we will measure and sodium excretion. The benefits 
you might get from being in this study are: none anticipated.

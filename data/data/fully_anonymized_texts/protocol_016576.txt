This is a double- blind, randomized, placebo- controlled, multi -center, cross -
over study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of oral ketamine 
in patient s 6 –  [ADDRESS_1062893] not achieved 
menarche, diagnosed with Rett Syndrome with a confirmed MECP2  
mutation.  
The study consists of up to 4  cohorts initiated sequentially in ascending 
dose order  (0.75 mg/kg BID, 1.5 mg/kg BID, 3 mg/kg BID, and 4.5 mg/kg 
BID). Each cohort will assess 1  dose of ketamine compared to placebo. 
After each  cohort, an independent safety monitoring committee will 
determine if there are adequate safety data to support initiation of the subsequent dosing cohort. Patient s may only participate in one cohort.  
A cohort within the study is divided into 3 periods: Screening, Cross -over 
Treatment, and Safety Follow -up. The Screening Period may last between 
14 and 28 days prior to the initiation of study drug. The Cross -over 
Treatment period is a 4 -week, double- blind, placebo- controlled, cross -over 
period to define safety and explore efficacy for the study. The Safety Follow -up Period is the final 2 weeks of the study to assess safety following 
Treatment Period completion.

Parents, legally authorized representatives (LARs), or authorized 
caregivers will provide appropriately obtained informed consent, and where 
appropriate, patient s will provide assent, prior to the completion of any 
screening procedures.  
At the Screening visit, patient s will be assessed for initial eligibility and will 
take home biosensor s for collection of daily  in-home data prior to the Day [ADDRESS_1062894] centers, physical 
examination, vital signs, ECG, as well as physician CGI -S, RSBQ, MBA,

Domain Likert Scale of the same [ADDRESS_1062895] treatment 
on Day 1 and initiation of the alternate treatment 2 weeks later on Day 15.  
Each ordered cross -over dosing regimen comprises 5 days of BID dosing 
(treatment 1: Day 1 -5, treatment 2: Day 15- 19) and patient  safety and 
efficacy evaluation for 14 days after dose initiation (Period 1: Day 15, 
Period 2: Day 29).  
After dosing completion and conclusion of the [ADDRESS_1062896] dose of each treatment, and through daily 
communication with the caregiver on at -home dosing days. In addition, 
study Investigators will form a medical monitoring committee and convene 
on a regular basis to discuss adverse events (AEs) and overall 
interpretation of tolerability.  
An independent  safety monitoring committee will perform a safety 
assessment of each  cohort with a subsequent ascending dose to assess if 
initiation of the subsequent cohort is supported.  
In the case of intolerability during the 5 -day dosing period the patient  will 
stop dosing at the assigned blinded dose and discontinue the study, and 
any adverse events will be followed until an acceptable clinical resolution is 
achieved.  Patient s who discontinue study drug due to an AE during the 
Treatment Period will return for the Day 29/Early Termination Visit [ADDRESS_1062897] dose and receive a final Safety Follow -up phone call.

Methodology:  Sample Size  
Sample size determinations for this study are based on the primary 
outcome of safety and tolerability . For a dose- limiting adverse event  with a 
10% incidence rate, a sample size of 10 patient s/dose level ( 10 
patient s/cohort) provides a 65% probability of observing at least 1 event at 
each dose level , and an  88% probability of observing at least 1 event by 
[CONTACT_773906] 2 .  
For measures of efficacy, t here are no studies in the literature to provide 
reliable estimates of treatment effects of ketamine or the estimate of variance in symptom management for Rett Syndrome patients. Each dose level provides 80% power to detect a 1.[ADDRESS_1062901] with 0.0 5 Type I error. Assuming a 
discontinuation rate between 15 and 20%, approximately [ADDRESS_1062902] one dose 
of study medication.  Safety data will be tabulated and summarized by 
[CONTACT_3148]. Adverse events will be coded by [CONTACT_773907]. By [CONTACT_773908], AEs leading to discontinuation, and deaths.  
Data collected in this study will be documented using summary tables, 
figures, and patient  data listings. Data will be summarized by [CONTACT_773909]- over period. Continuous measures will be summarized descriptively 
(mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum value) and categorical measures will be presented as number and percentage.

2.1. Overview of Rett Syndrome  
Rett Syndrome is a severe and complex neurodevelopmental disorder resulting primarily from 
loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding methyl -CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). As a 
transcriptional regulatory protein, loss of MeCP2 results in dysregulation of more than 100 
genes causing defects in synapse formation and neurotransmission. MECP2  is encoded on the 
X chromosome and as an X -linked dominant disorder, mutations are typi[INVESTIGATOR_366529] a 
random spontaneous mutation in sperm  thereby [CONTACT_773911] 1 in 10,000 live female births.   
A heterozygous mutation in MECP2 disrupts  MeCP2 -dependent functions in half of the patient’s 
cells due to  X inactivation  and the resulting expression of either  the normal or mutant MECP2  
gene. The phenotype of the disorder can be further complicated by [CONTACT_773912] X inactivation that 
may contribute to more mild or more severe phenotypes depending on the direction and 
percentage of skewed expression6,7. 
After a period of apparently normal development through [ADDRESS_1062909] the excitatory/inhibitory imbalance across the brain due to regional 
differences in glutamatergic circuitry may provide a potential therapeutic intervention . The non -
selective NMDA  receptor  antagonist ketamine ( 2-O-chlorophenyl -2-methylamino 
cyclohexanone)  has previously been shown to increase cortical network function
10 and 
decrease synaptic excitability in brainstem networks important for respi[INVESTIGATOR_773885]11.  
The therapeutic potential of ketamine for treatment of Rett syndrome is supported by [CONTACT_773913]. Treatment of Mecp2  mutant mice with  a sub -anesthetic dose of ketamine at 
8mg/kg demonstrates acute effects on circuit function and reverses several mutant phenotypes 
including hypoactivity in forebrain circuits, abnormal sensorimotor gating
12, as well as apneic 
breathing ( Figure 1).  
Sub-anesthetic ketamine has demonstrated effects against chronic and neuropathic pain, 
anxiety, depression and treatment -resistant depression syndromes, bipolar disorder, and has 
shown positive effects on cognition in children, as described later. Ketamine rapi[INVESTIGATOR_773886]-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and mTOR signaling

Supporting long- term effects of ketamine, more recent studies demonstrate prolonged efficacy 
with repeated dosing. For example, mice given 3 mg/kg intraperitoneal ketamine, once every [ADDRESS_1062911] of repeated drug administration (Katz et al., unpublished) . 
Clinical studies on the effects of sub- anesthetic ketamine in several neuropsychiatric indications 
also indicate that repeated dosing is likely to lead to more durable treatment effects than single 
doses. Together, t hese published and unpublished observations provide new insight into 
potential strategies for enhancing the efficacy of ketamine, including dosing regimen and route 
of administration.  
The bioavailability of ketamine administered in various routes has been summarized18 and 
shown in the table below . Due to extensive first -pass metabolism and approximately  20% oral 
bioavailability in humans, a starting oral dose of 0.75 mg/kg of ketamine is equivalent to an 
intravenous dose of approximately 0.15 mg/kg. The safety and efficacy of single oral dos es up 
to 10 mg/kg19 as well as repeated oral dos es up to 1.5 mg/kg TID20, has already been 
demonstrated for pediatric indications. The model of therapeutic intervention for this study is designed to assess an oral dosing regimen of ketamine within the sub -anesthetic range for 
tolerability and safety, and to explore potential efficacy of  doses that theoretically should impact 
Rett syndrome symptomology.  

Oral Ketamine in Rett Syndrome   [ADDRESS_1062912] 50 years ago. Ketamine is now available generically through Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20116], Inc; Mylan 
Institutional; Par Pharmaceutical; and West -Ward Pharmaceuticals. The ketamine prescribing 
information23 should be consulted for complete clinical information on ketamine to date.  
Ketamine hydrochloride injection is indicated as the sole anesthetic agent for diagnostic and 
surgical procedures that do not require skeletal muscle relaxation  and is best suited for short 
procedures but it can be used, with additional doses, for longer procedures. Ketamine 
hydrochloride is also indicated for the induction of anesthesia prior to the administration of other 
general anesthetic agents, and to supplement low -potency agents such as nitrous oxide.  Routes 
of administration are intravenous or intramuscular injection.  
Specific areas of application have included the following:  
1. Debridement, painful dressings, and skin grafting in burn patients, as well as other 
superficial surgical procedures.  
2. Neurodiagnostic procedures such as pneumonencephalograms, ventriculograms, 
myelograms, and lumbar punctures.  
3. Diagnostic and operative procedures of the eye, ear, nose, and mouth, including dental 
extractions.  
4. Diagnostic and operative procedures of the pharynx, larynx, or bronchial tree.  
5. Sigmoidoscopy and minor surgery of the anus and rectum, and circumcision.  
6. Extraperitoneal procedures used in gynecology such as dilatation and curettage.  
7. Orthopedic procedures such as closed reductions, manipulations, femoral pi[INVESTIGATOR_334], 
amputations, and biopsies.  
8. As an anesthetic in poor -risk patients with depression of vital functions.  
9. In procedures where the intramuscular route of administration is preferred.  
10. In cardiac catheterization procedures.

Confidential            20 2.4.1.  Clinical Safety of IV Ketamin e in Anesthesia  
Ketamine has a wide margin of safety. Several instances of unintentional administration of 
overdoses of ketamine (up to ten times that usually required) have been followed by [CONTACT_773916].  
Ketamine has been studied in over 12,000 operative and diagnostic procedures, involving over 
10,000 patients from 105 separate studies ( ketamine prescribing information). During the course 
of these studies  ketamine hydrochloride was administered as the sole agent, as induction for 
other general agents, or to supplement low -potency agents. Safety and effectiveness in 
pediatric patients below the age of [ADDRESS_1062913] not been established.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adverse Events with IV Ketamine in Anesthesia  
The following adverse reactions have been described when ketamine wa s used as indicated : 
Cardiovascular:  Blood pressure and pulse rate are frequently elevated following administration 
of ketamine alone. However, hypotension and bradycardia have been observed. Arrhythmia has 
also occurred.  
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]:  Although respi[INVESTIGATOR_773888], severe depression of respi[INVESTIGATOR_773889]. 
Laryngospasms and other forms of airway obstruction have occurred during ketamine 
anes thesia.  
Eye: Diplopia and nystagmus have been noted following ketamine administration. It also may 
cause a slight elevation in intraocular pressure measurement.  
Genitourinary:  In individuals with history of chronic ketamine use or abuse, lower urinary tract 
and bladder symptoms including dysuria, increased urinary frequency, urgency, urge 
incontinence, and hematuria have been reported. In addition, diagnostic studies performed t o 
assess the cause of these symptoms have reported cystitis (including cystitis non- infective, 
cystitis interstitial, cystitis ulcerative, cystitis erosive and cystitis hemorrhagic) as well as hydronephrosis and reduced bladder capacity.  
Neurological:  In some patients, enhanced skeletal muscle tone may be manifested by [CONTACT_773917].  
Gastrointestinal:  Anorexia, nausea and vomiting have been observed; however, this is not 
usually severe and allows the great majority of patients to take liquids by [CONTACT_773918] . 
General:  Anaphylaxis . Local pain and exanthema at the injection site have infrequently been 
reported. Transient erythema and/or morbilliform rash have also been reported.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Emergence Reactions with IV Ketamine in Anesthesia  
Emergence reactions have occurred in approximately 12% of patients when ketamine was used as indicated. The psychological manifestations vary in severity between pleasant dream -like 
states, vivid imagery, hallucinations, and emergence delirium, and in some cases accompanied 
by [CONTACT_2976], excitement, and irrational behavior which a few patients recall as an unpleasant 
experience. The duration ordinarily is no more than a few hours; in a few cases, however, 
recurrences have taken place up to [ADDRESS_1062914]

Confidential            21 in the elderly (over 65 years of age) patient, are less frequent when the drug is given 
intramuscularly, and incidence is reduced as experience with the drug is gained. The literature suggests that pediatric patients are at lower risk for psychotomimetic side effects related to 
ketamine administration than adults
24. 
The incidence of psychological manifestations during emergence, particularly dream -like 
observations and emergence delirium, may be reduced by [CONTACT_773919]. Also, these reactions may be reduced if verbal, tactile, and visual stimulation of the patient is minimized during the recovery period. This does not preclude the monitoring of vital 
signs. In order to terminate a severe emergence react ion, the use of a small hypnotic dose of a 
short -acting or ultra short -acting barbiturate may be required.  
When ketamine is used on an outpatient basis, the patient should not be released until recovery 
from anesthesia is complete and then should be accompanied by a responsible adult.  
2.4.2.  Clinical Studies of Ketamine in Adults with Neuropsych iatric  Conditions  
Several neuropsyc hiatric  conditions  including bipolar disorder, depression syndromes, and 
obsessive compulsive disorder  (OCD) are hypothesized to be caused by [CONTACT_773920] s when treated 
with ketamine . Though not all studies assessing ketamine have shown efficacy  in every case, 
route of administration and duration of dosing, the studies described below support the 
therapeutic dose range under study and demonstrate the possibility for short - and long- term 
effects to be achieved in Rett syndrome.   
Bipolar Disorder  
The pathophysiology of bipolar disorder may be due to dysfunctional NMDA signaling, and ketamine as a non- competitive NMDA receptor antagonist was investigated for utility as a rapid 
onset anti-depressant in treatment -resistance bi -polar depression in a randomized trial of 18 
patients
25. The authors found that a single treatment with ketamine at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg over 
a 40- minute IV infusion time resulted in significant changes in depression and anxiety compared 
to placebo. Adverse events associated with ketamine included dissociation;  feeling strange, 
weird or bizarre; dry mouth; tachycardia; and increased blood pressure. No serious adverse 
events and no significant changes in ECG, respi[INVESTIGATOR_773890]25.  
Depression  
NMDA receptor antagonists have also been evaluated in treating treatment -refractory 
depression (TRD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Ketamine has been reported to lead to 
sustained improvements for up to [ADDRESS_1062915]  in a case -series of 2 patients, where each 
receiv ed a 5-day regimen of intravenous ketamine and were titrated to an individual maximum 
tolerated dose lacking psychotomimetic effects but where both patients reported feeling “a bit 
heady”. Each patient received a 1- hour infusion of 27.[ADDRESS_1062916] -dose, was associated with improvement of anxiety at 24 
hours, and was well tolerated with small increases in psychotomimetic measures that typi[INVESTIGATOR_239130] 4 hours of dosing27.

enantiomer of racemic ketamine, was assessed intranasally in 1,709 adults in 6 clinical trials. 
The indicated treatment regimen includes a 2- hour in- clinic observation of dosing at 56 mg or 84 
mg twice weekly for up to 4 weeks, followed by [INVESTIGATOR_2993] -clinic maintenance  at once weekly or once bi -
weekly dosing. Side effects reported during clinical development at any dose at an incidence 
≥5% and at least twice that of placebo were dissociation, dizziness, nausea, sedation, vertigo, 
hypoesthesia, anxiety, lethargy, blood pressure increased, vomiting, and feeling drunk28. 
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder  
In a randomized controlled crossover trial of 15 patients receiving either placebo or ketamine 
dosed at 0.5 mg/kg over a 40- minute IV infusion, symptom relief of OCD met responder criteria 
and was statistically significant up to a week post -infusion29, confirming shorter -term effects 
noted in a case report30. Additionally, in an open label trial of the same regimen in 10 patients 
with less severe OCD, acute relief of OCD symptoms w as attained though no patients achieved 
responder status31. Of these, 59% of patients with comorbid depression demonstrated a 
significant and persistent improvement in depressive symptoms.  In both studies, ketamine 
treatment was considered well tolerated. The most common adverse events reported were 
dissociative symptoms that resolved within [ADDRESS_1062917] profile than parenteral 
ketamine, including reduced levels of psychotomimetic effects  32,33,34,35,36. 
Depression and Anxiety  
Oral ketamine was assessed in 14 adults in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_773891] a once- daily treatment at 0.5 mg/kg for 
28 days for the treatment of depression and anxiety. Eight subjects completed the study. On 
days 14 and 28, anxiety and depression were found to be significantly improved. Adverse events reported were mild and included diarrhea, trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_773892]. No 
changes in vital signs were reported and no serious adverse events oc curred
37. A case -series of 
2 patients suffering from treatment -resistant depression with suicidal ideation received an 
ascending dose oral ketamine regimen of 0.5 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg  and demonstrated sustained 
efficacy in relieving symptoms38.  
Pain  
In a co-analgesic oncology palliative care setting, a study of 29 adults receiving an optimized  
sub-cutaneous infusion of ketamine for pain control demonstrated maintenance of efficacy upon 
switching to dose- equivalent oral administration TID for up to 9 days, at doses as high as 750 
mg/day . A symptom score evaluation revealed side effects of slight (83%) or moderate (17%) 
insobriety, slight (86%) or moderate (14%) somnolence, and [ADDRESS_1062918] -stroke pain at a dose of 50 mg TID for 3 
months40. 
2.4.4.  Clinical Studies of Ketamine Dosed Orally in Children  
Due to ketamine’s well characterized safety profile, single sub -anesthetic doses of oral ketamine 
have been explored to aid surgical procedure s in children, and more recently , repeat dosing of 
oral ketamine up to [ADDRESS_1062919] on  chronic pain and 
cognitive function in children.  
The effects of oral ketamine w ere evaluated  in an open- label ascending dose cohort study  in 12 
children,  aged 11 to 19 years , for assessment of chronic pain management and short - and long -
term cognitive effects20,41. The oral doses evaluated were 0.25 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, 
and 1.5 mg/kg  dosed TID over 14 days . Five of 12 patients (42%) demonstrated an 
improvement in pain score over the 14 -day treatment period, with 2 patients reporting pain 
resolution20. Eleven of 12 patients (92%) demonstrated a significant and persistent improvement 
in executive functioning at [ADDRESS_1062920] dose of oral ketamine, which resolved within 1– 2 hours and did not recur upon repeat 
administrations. Delayed dysphoria (e.g., confusion, dizziness) was experienced by 7 of 12 
participants  and CTCAE v4.0 grade 2 dysuria without hematuria was experienced by 1 
participant in the 1.5 mg/kg cohort . Grade 2 (moderate) anorexia and depressed level of 
consciousness w ere considered dose -limiting toxicit ies of the 14- day 1.5 mg/kg TID cohort20.  
In another double- blind, randomized, controlled study in 45 children aged 1- 7 years , patients 
received a single dose of placebo, 3 mg/kg , or 6mg/kg  oral ketamine prior to induction of 
anesthesia for a surgical procedure to assess ease of anesthesia induction and potential overall improvement of the patient’s surgery experience
42. Both 3 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg single doses of 
oral ketamine were considered well tolerated , with incidence of n ystagmus statistically elevated 
from placebo . There were no reports of altered vital signs or surgery recovery, and no 
emergence phenomena were reported.  Sedation occurred in 11 of 15 (73%) of patients who 
received 3 mg/kg and 100% of patients who received 6 mg/kg.  
Another open- label study assessed a single 10 mg/kg dose of oral ketamine in 35 pediatric 
oncology patients aged 14 months to 17 years and demonstrated less distress related to surgical procedures than historical controls. The dose of 10 mg/kg oral ketamine resulted in 87% of patients attaining maximum levels of sedation at [ADDRESS_1062921] dose with recovery 
within 2 -4 hours. No cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_773893]. Emergence phenomena were experienced by 3 patients (9%) and included 2 patients (6%) that demonstrated mild confusion and disorientation, and 1 patient 
(3%) that demonstrated moderate agitation that res olved without intervention

Syndrome  
To date, one open- label pi[INVESTIGATOR_773894] a controlled study to assess its 
therapeutic potential . Consistent with mouse model data, a multiple ascending dose pi[INVESTIGATOR_773895] 4 Rett syndrome patients conducted by [CONTACT_773922]   01 July 2020

regularity over the dose range tested (0.1 mg/kg, 0.25 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, and 1.0 mg/kg) with 
profound effects observed at [ADDRESS_1062922]-dose (Katz, unpublished) . All 4 doses of intravenous 
ketamine were considered well -tolerated.  
In a case report called “The Scottish Patient” ( Welham et al., Presented at the 2017 British 
Pediatric Neurology Association Annual Meeting), repeated oral dosing of ketamine in a 10 -year 
old Rett syndrome patient was described. In this case, the patient was given oral ketamine at 
0.75 mg/kg BID for 5 days for refractory seizures that resulted in not only seizure resolution but also improvement in motor function, communication, and cognition lasting 8 weeks before 
seizures re- emerged. The patient was dosed with another 5 -day regimen of ketamine at 0.75 
mg/kg BID conferring additional seizure control and sustained improvements in Rett symptoms. In a 12- month review of the patient’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_773896], an 80% reduction in

The overall objectives  of the study are to assess the safety , tolerability,  and efficacy of oral 
ketamine  in patients with Rett syndrome . 
4.1. Primary Objective s 
The primary objective is: 
• To assess the safety  and tolerability of administration of a 5 -day dosing regimen of 
oral ketamine in Rett syndrome patients . 
4.2. Exploratory O bjectives  
The exploratory objectives are:  
• To assess the change in continuous biosensor data (activity, movement, heart rate, 
gait, sleep, posture, breathing regularity) from baseline;  
• To assess the change in Rett syndrome severity as measured by [CONTACT_773924] (MBA) from baseline;  
• To assess the change in Rett syndrome severity as measured by [CONTACT_773925] (RSBQ) from baseline;  
• To assess the change in Rett syndrome severity and improvement as measured by 
[CONTACT_773926] (CGI -S) and Clinical Global Impression of 
Improvement (CGI -I) from baseline;  
• To assess the change in symptom severity as measured by [CONTACT_773927];  
• To assess the change in symptom severity as measured by [CONTACT_7071] D omain Likert 
Scale from baseline;  
• To assess the change in sleep from baseline as measured by [CONTACT_773928] ( CSHQ) 
• To assess the change in caregiver burden as measured by [CONTACT_773929] (RTT CIA) from baseline  
• To assess the change in EEG signature [CONTACT_773948]   [ADDRESS_1062924] not achieved 
menarche, and should not be treated concurrently with other NMDA receptor antagonists, or 
with other treatments with known ketamine interactions . 
The study consists of up to 4 cohorts initiated sequentially in ascending dose order. Each cohort 
will assess 1  dose  level of ketamine (0.75 mg/kg, 1.5 mg/kg BID, 3 mg/kg , or 4.5 mg/kg BID). A t 
the conclusion of each cohort, an independent safety monitoring committee will determine if 
there are adequate safety data to support initiation of the subsequent  cohort.  
A cohort within the study is divided into 3 periods : Screening, Cross -over Treatment ( comprising 
a regimented 2 -treatment cross -over), and Post -Treatment Safety Follow -Up (Figure 2). The 
Screening Period will last between [ADDRESS_1062925] cross -over regimen 
and the alternate treatment in the second,  based on their blinded randomization assignment.  
Patient s may only participate in one cohort.

5.1.1.  Screening and Baseline  
Caregivers will provide appropriately obtained informed consent , and where possible, patient s 
will provide assent, prior to completing any screening procedures.   
At the Screening visit, eligibility will be confirmed  and patient s will take home the biosensor 
system s for collection of daily in-home data prior to the Day [ADDRESS_1062926] centers,  physical 
examination, vital signs, ECG, as well as physician CGI -S, MBA, and the Clinician Rated 
Domain Likert Scale consisting of 8 domains (hand function, walking, verbal and non- verbal 
communication, comprehension, attention, behavior problems, mood) . Caregiver rated scales 
including the RSBQ, CSHQ , RTT CIA,  and an exploratory  Parent Rated Domain Likert  Scale  of 
the same [ADDRESS_1062927] treatment will cross -over to receive 
ketamine in the second.  
Each ordered cross -over dosing regimen comprises 5 days of BID dosing (treatment 1: Day 1 -5, 
treatment 2: Day 15- 19) and patient  safety and efficacy evaluation for 14 days after dose 
initiation (Period 1: Day 15, Period 2: Day 29).  
After dosing completion and conclusion of the [ADDRESS_1062928] patient  has completed the final efficacy and 
safety assessment of the Treatment Period (Day 29). The safety committee will review accumulated safety data to assess if initiation of dosing for the subsequent cohort is supported.  
In the case of treatment intolerability  during the 5- day dosing period,  the patient  will stop 
treatment  at the assigned blinded dose and discontinue the study, and any adverse events will 
be followed until an acceptable clinical resolution is achieved.  Patient s who discontinue study 
drug due to an adverse event (AE) during the Treatment Period will return for the Day 29/Early 
Oral Ketamine in Rett Syndrome   [ADDRESS_1062929] dose and receive a final Safety Follow -up 
phone call.

concentrates, sterile water, and masking flavor. T reatment preparations should be based on the 
weight of the patient  in kilograms on the day of the Visit. Placebo solutions should consist of 
sterile water and masking flavor  and be indistinguishable from ketamine solutions . The same 
volume of placebo or ketamine solution should be prepared and administered when appropriate 
to maint ain the blind.   
Refer to the pharmacy manual for general guidance on compounding.  
7.3.4.   Study Drug Administration 
Patient s will take the first dose of each ketamine or placebo treatment  in-clinic on Day [ADDRESS_1062934] operating 
procedure for study treatment disposal, and/or destruction.   
7.3.6.  Study Drug Accountability

8.1. Demographic Characteristics and Medical History  
Demographic characteristics will be collected at the Screening Visit  including documentation of 
a causative MECP2  genetic mutation, thorough  medical history , and t he patient ’s typi[INVESTIGATOR_773900]5. 
8.2. Actigraph 
The ActiGraph wGT3X -BT is an FDA cleared Class II medical device intended to  capture and 
record high resolution raw acceleration data that can be converted into activity and sleep 
measures.  
In this study, patient s will wear the ActiGraph xGT3X -BT on the wrist  for continuous data 
collection during the Screening and Treatment Periods . Collected data will be uploaded at the 
Visit. Raw datasets collected will be explored for Rett syndrome- specific signatures in addition 
to pre -defined algorithms.  
8.3. Hexoskin Smart Garment  
The Hexoskin Smart Kit developed by [CONTACT_773933], Inc ( Hexoskin ), uses non -invasive 
biometric  sensors embedded within machine -washable, breathable, light -weight fabric clothing 
to continuously track activity, sleep, heart and lung function. Specifically, hexoskin monitors  
ECG and heartbeat, heart rate variability, breathing rate and volume (L/min), activity intensity, acceleration, cadence, energy expenditure (kCal), position, and sleep.  
In this study, patient s will wear the Hexoskin Smart Garment  for continuous data collection 
during the Screening and Treatment Periods. Since hexoskin Smart Garments  are not indicated 
for children under the age of 13 or for patient s with neurodevelopmental disorders, the raw 
datasets collected will be explored for Rett syndrome- specific signatures in addition to pre-
defined algorithms.  
8.4. Clinical Global Impression Scales  
The Global Impression Scales are measures commonly used in clinical trials to allow integration 
of several sources of information into a single rating of the  patient ’s condition43. The Clinical 
Global Impression S cales  employ a 7 -point Likert scale measuring either disease state severity 
or improvement after treatment .  
In this study, t he Clinical Global Impression Scale of Severity and Improvement  will be 
performed by  [CONTACT_737] . Assessment  of Rett syndrome severity should consider the 
condition of the patient  at the time of the assessment , while assessment of Rett syndrome 
improvement should consider the condition of the patient  at the time of the assessment  
compared to Baseline. To reduce variability, one rater should perform the global impression 
scales for the patient  for the duration of the study.  
8.5. Rett Syndrome B ehavio ur Questionnaire  
The Rett Syndrome Behaviour Questionnaire ( RSBQ ) is a 45 -item measure to evaluate the 
behavioral and emotional features of Rett syndrome and to discriminate between patients with Rett Syndrome and idiopathic severe to profound intellectual disability

Confidential            38 8.6. Motor Behavioral Assessment  
The Rett Syndrome Motor Behavioral Assessment (MBA) is a 40 -item scale used to assess 3 
subgroups  in Rett syndrome patients : behavioral/social, orofacial/respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], and motor 
assessment /physical signs, in their current state and the worst ever state45. 
8.7. Parent and Clinician Rated Domain Likert Scales  
In addition to the Global Impression Scales that assess the patient  overall, an evaluation of 
individual symptom domains will also be explored. To assess potential changes in specific 
symptoms of a patient ’s condition, the Investigator will complete a 7 -point Likert Scale for each 
of the following 8 domains : hand function, walking, verbal and non- verbal communication, 
comprehension, attention, behavior problems, mood. The caregiver will complete an exploratory Parent Rated Domain Likert Scale of the same 8 clinician domains (hand function, walking, 
verbal and non -verbal communication, comprehension, attention, behavior problems, mood) 
with the addition of a seizures domain.  
8.8. Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire  
The Children’s Sleep Habit’s Questionnaire ( CSHQ ) was designed for children aged [ADDRESS_1062935] common sleep problems in that age group, though it will be 
collected for all patient s in this study46.  The 35- item questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_286725] .  
8.9. Rett Caregiver Burden Inventory Assessment  
The Rett Caregiver Burden Inventory Assessment (Rett CIA) was adapted from the Caregiver 
Burden Inventory created for Alzheimer disease  to assess caregiver burden specifically for 
individuals with Rett Syndrome47. The RTT CIA consists of 26 questions across 4 domains (time 
dependency, physical burden, emotional burden, social burden) appropriate for the Rett 
Syndrome patient population and utilizes a 5 -point Likert scale for answering each item : (1) I 
never feel this way, (2) I rarely feel this way, (3) I sometimes feel this way, (4) I quite frequently 
feel this way, (5) I nearly always feel this way .  
8.10.  Physical Examination  
A physical examination will include an examination of all major organ systems. Caregivers 
should be instructed to notify the clinic of any signs of changes in the patient ’s physical or 
neurological state between visits for appropriate monitoring and follow -up. 
8.11.  Vital Signs , Weight, and Height  
At each Visit, v ital signs will be measured after the patient  has been in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_1662] -supi[INVESTIGATOR_12473] [ADDRESS_1062936] sites performing an electroencephalogram (EEG), an electronic EEG recording will be 
collected for evaluation of NMDA receptor target engagement and subsequent changes in EEG signature [CONTACT_773950].  
Oral Ketamine in Rett Syndrome   [ADDRESS_1062937] medical occurrence that may appear or worsen in a patient  
during the course of a study.  It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant 
illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the patient ’s health, including laboratory test 
values, regardless of etiology.  Any worsening (ie, any clinically significant adverse change in 
the frequency or intensity of a pre- existing condition) should be considered an adverse event.  A 
diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on the adverse event page of the eCRF rather than 
the individual signs or symptom s of the diagnosis or syndrome.  
9.1.2.  Evaluation of Adverse Events  
A qualified Investigator  will evaluate all adverse events as to seriousness, severity/intensity, 
relationship to study drug, duration, action taken, and outcome.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event is an adverse event, as per Title 21 CFR 312.32 and ICH E2A.II.B that 
fulfills the following criteria:  
• Is fatal (results in death);  
• Is life -threatening (Note: the term "life- threatening" refers to an event in which the 
patient  was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that 
could hypothetically have caused death had it been more severe);  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19357], regardless of length of stay);  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (a substantial disruption of the patient 's ability to conduct normal life functions);  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  
• Constitutes an important medical event that may jeopardize the patient  or may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  
Important medical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or disability, but may jeopardize the patient  or 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].   
Events not considered  to be serious adverse events are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]:  
• A procedure for protocol/disease- related investigations (e .g., sampling for laboratory, 
pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic tests).  However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57893] a complication of such procedures remains a reportable 
serious adverse event.  
Oral Ketamine in Rett Syndrome   01 July 2020  
Amendment 2   Protocol Ket -101-RSRT  
Confidential            41 • Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27591], practical, or social 
reasons, in absence of an adverse event.  
• A procedure that is planned (i .e., planned prior to the starting of treatment on study); 
must be documented in the source document and the eCRF.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27589] a complication remains a reportable serious adverse event.  
• An elective treatment of or an elective procedure for a pre- existing medical condition 
that does not worsen.  
• Emergency outpatient treatment or observation that does not result in admission, unless fulfilling other seriousness criteria above.  
If an adverse event is considered serious, the adverse event eCRF must be completed.  
For each serious adverse event, the Investigator  will provide information on severity, start and 
stop dates, relationship to investigational product, action taken regarding investigational product, and outcome.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Severity/Intensity  
For both adverse events and serious adverse events, the Investigator  must assess the 
severity/intensity of the event.   
The National Cancer Institute- Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event s (CTCAE) 
Version 4.03 should be used to grade the severity/intensity of all events . If a CTCAE criterion 
does not exist, the Investigator should grade the severity  according to the following criteria:  
• Grade 1 (m ild): does not interfere with the patient ’s usual function  
• Grade 2 (m oderate ): interferes to some extent with patient 's usual function  
• Grade 3 (s evere ): interferes significantly with patient 's usual function  
• Grade 4 (life- threatening): results in a threat to life or in an incapacitating disability  
• Grade 5 (death): results in death  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Relationship to Study Drug 
Relationship should be assessed and provided for every adverse event/serious adverse event based on currently available information.  Relationship is to be reassessed and provided as additional information becomes available.   Adverse events will be classified by [CONTACT_773934], probably related, possibly related, unlikely related, or not related.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Duration 
For all adverse events whether or not considered serious, the Investigator  will provide a record 
of the start and stop dates of the event.  If an event is unresolved at the end of the study it will be 
recorded as ongoing.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Action Taken  
The Investigator  will record the action taken with investigational product as a result of an 
adverse event or serious adverse event on the eCRF , as applicable, and record if concomitant 
and/or additional treatments were given for the event.  
Oral Ketamine in Rett Syndrome   01 July 2020  
Amendment 2   Protocol Ket -101-RSRT  
Confidential            42 [IP_ADDRESS].  Outcome  
The Investigator will record the outcome of adverse events on the eCRF, as applicable.   
9.1.3.  Follow -Up 
Adverse events assessed as not related to study drug, including physical examination findings, 
must be followed until the event resolves, the condition stabilizes, the event is otherwise 
explained, or the final study visit occurs, whichever comes first.     
Adverse events assessed as related to study drug and serious adverse events will be followed for as long as necessary to adequately evaluate the patient ’s safety, or until the event stabilizes, 
is otherwise explained, death occurs, or the patient  is lost to follow up.   
9.1.4.  Recording Adverse Events  
All adverse events (regardless of seriousness or relationship to study drug) including those from 
the time informed consent is obtained through to the final study visit are to be recorded in the eCRF.  Each individual adverse event is to be listed as a separate entry.  The Investigator  will 
provide information about dates of onset and resolution, seriousness, severity, action(s) taken, outcome, and relationship to the study drug.  All adverse events should be documented in the 
patient ’s source documents.  
9.1.5.  Reporting Adverse Events  
The Investigator  must report all adverse events that occur during the study from the time written 
informed consent is given until the final study visit /phone call  or early termination, regardless of 
their relationship to the study drug.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Serious adverse events will be reported from the time written informed consent is given through [ADDRESS_1062938] dose of study drug. The Sponsor -Investigator will be responsible for 
reporting serious adverse events to the FDA, as required.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Reporting Urgent Safety Issues  
The Sponsor -Investigator should be notified if  the Investigator  becomes aware of an actual or 
potential urgent safety issue.  
Urgent safety issues should be treated as medically appropriate. An urgent safety issue may 
include: (1) issues with an investigational drug or comparators; (2)  study procedures; (3) inter -
current illness (including pandemic infections); (4) concomitant medications; (5) concurrent 
medical conditions; or (6) any other issues related to the safe conduct of the study or that pose 
a risk to study patient s.

Confidential            43 10. STATISTIC AL METHODS  
For statistical methods, treatment refers to placebo, ketamine 0.75 mg /kg, ketamine 1.5 mg/kg, 
ketamine 3.0 mg/kg, and ketamine 4. 5 mg/kg .  
10.1.  Sample Size Rationale  
Sample size determinations for this study are based on the primary outcome of safety and 
tolerability. For a dose -limiting adverse event with a 10% incidence rate, a sample size of 10 
patient s/dose level ( 10 patient s/cohort) provides a 65% probability of observing at least 1 event 
at each dose level, and an 88% probability of observing at least 1 event by [CONTACT_773906] 
2.  
For measures of efficacy, there are no studies in the literature to provide reliable estimates of 
treatment effects of ketamine or the estimate of variance in symptom management for Rett Syndrome patient s. Each dose level provides 80% power to detect a 1.[ADDRESS_1062939] with 0.05  Type I error. Assuming a 
discontinuation rate between 15 and 20%, approximately 12 patient s will be enrolled in each 
cohort to provide 1 0 patient s who complete the treatment  period.  
10.2.  Endpoints  
10.2.1.  Safety  
Safety and tolerability of oral ketamine will be assessed by [CONTACT_256435], vital 
signs, concomitant medications and physical examinations.  
10.2.2.  Efficacy  
Efficacy is exploratory in this study .  Endpoints will include the CGI -I score and published total 
and/or domain scores for the Clinical Domain Report, Parent Domain Report, RSBQ, MBA, RTT 
CIA, and CSHQ . Biosensor device algorithms and raw datasets will be explored.    
Additional  exploratory statisti cal methods to further assess for treatment effect will be described 
in the clinical study report and/or resulting publications, as deemed appropriate.  
10.3.  Analysis Populations  
10.3.1.  Treatment Period  
The Safety Population will include all patient s who receive study drug during the Treatment 
Period.   
The Efficacy Population will include all patient s who receive both assigned study drug s and 
have at least [ADDRESS_1062940]-treatment efficacy assessment  for both assigned study drugs .   
10.4.  Analyses  
Statistical analyses will be summarized in a statistical analysis plan prior to database lock. All 
data captured in the electronic data capture system (EDC) will be listed by [CONTACT_4676] . 
Continuous measures will be summarized descriptively (mean, standard deviation, median,  
minimum value, and maximum value) and categorical measures will be presented as number 
and percent age.

Disposition will be summarized by [CONTACT_773935] . The number and 
percentage of patient s, who are randomized, treated, prematurely discontinued,  and complete 
the study will be summarized.  
Baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_773935].  
The number of patient s in each cohort  will be summarized for each investigative site  for the 
Treatment Period.  Medical history will be coded with the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) terminology.  Concomitant medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_773936] -Therapeutic -Chemical classification (ATCC) and 
preferred term.   
10.4.2.  Efficacy  
Unless otherwise indicated, treatment differences will be assessed with an analysis of variance 
model that includes sequence (placebo -ketamine, ketamine- placebo), treatment, and treatment 
by [CONTACT_773937] a random effect.  
Sequence will be tested using patient  nested within sequence as the error term.  
For daily biosensor data, change from the average value during Screening to the average value 
during treatment (Days [ADDRESS_1062941] treatment and Days 15 to 19 during the second 
treatment) will be assessed for treatment differences. Additionally, change from the average 
value during Screening to the average value during the full treatment period (Days [ADDRESS_1062942] treatment and Days 15 to 28 during the second treatment) will be assessed for 
treatment differences.   
Change from pre -dose baseline (Day 1) to post -dose (Day  [ADDRESS_1062943] treatment and Day 29  for 
second treatment) will be assessed for treatment differences for total and domain scores of the Clinical Domain Report, Parent Domain Report, RSBQ, MBA, RTT CIA, and CSHQ.  
Additionally, change from pre- dose  baseline (Day 1) to post -dose (Day  [ADDRESS_1062944] treatment and 
Day 22 for second treatment) will be assessed for treatment differences for total and domain scores of the Parent Domain Report and CSHQ , as well as Day 43 for the Parent Domain 
Report  and the RTT CIA . As a secondary analysis, pre- dose baseline will be defined as day 1 of 
each treatment  (Day [ADDRESS_1062945] treatment  and Day 15 for second treatment ). 
For the CGI -I, scores on Day 15 and Day 29 will be assessed for treatment differences with the 
analysis of variance.  Additionally, each patient  will be categorized as improved (at least minimal 
improvement per the CGI -I) or not improved. The McNemar test will be used to assess 
treatment differences in the proportion of patient s who improve.  
EEG analysis will be described separately.  
10.4.3.  Study Drug Exposure  
Study drug exposure will be summarized for each treatment . The number of days on which 
study drug was dosed will be summarized.  
10.4.4.  Safety  
All safety summaries will be descriptive with no statistical hypothesis testing and based on the Safety Population. Patient s will be summarized according to the study drug received. All safety 
endpoints will be listed in by -patient  data listings.  
Oral Ketamine in Rett Syndrome   [ADDRESS_1062946] dose of study drug (i .e., 
Day 1), will be considered a pre- treatment adverse event.  Treatment -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) will be defined as any adverse event that occurs after administration of the first dose of 
study drug.  The number and percentage of patient s who report TEAEs will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_3148], system organ class , and preferred term.  
Treatment emergent adverse events will also be summarized by [CONTACT_324559] .   
Patient s who report the same preferred term on multiple occasions within a treatment will be 
counted once for the preferred term  within the treatment : under the highest severity when 
summarized by [CONTACT_773938].  If a patient  reports multiple preferred terms for a system organ class within a 
treatment , the patient  will be counted only once for that system organ class  within the treatment . 
The number and percentage of patient s who experience TEAEs will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_773939]:  
• By [CONTACT_324518]  
• Severe TEAEs by  [CONTACT_9313] , and preferred term

8 1 BACKGROUND   
1.1 Background  
 
Vasovagal  Syncope  
Syncope is a sudden and transient loss of consciousness and postural tone that typi[INVESTIGATOR_425517] a minute, followed by [CONTACT_425528]. Syncope is 
caused by a sudden decrease or brief cessation of cerebral blood flow .1 Although 
uncommon, syncope can occur following immunization and result in serious injury.2   
 
Vasovagal  (neurocardiogenic ) syncope is the most common form of  syncope.[ADDRESS_537624] been identified as possible triggers 
for syncope including: fear, anxiety, pain, hunger, overcrowding, illness, fatigue, 
injections, venipuncture, the sight of blood, and maintaining a still upright posture for a 
prolonged period. Alcohol, drugs and exposure to cold or heat can also precipi[INVESTIGATOR_425518]. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] , vasovagal  syncope is preceded by [CONTACT_188761], known as 
presyncope, which may involve nausea, dizziness, visual changes (e.g., spots, 
dimming), feelings of apprehension, pallor, yawning, diaphoresis, and feelings of 
warmth.3 
 Following a syncopal event, individuals may complain of malaise, fatigue, weakness, 
nausea, and headache. Although vasovagal  syncope is self -limited, there is a potential 
for harm if affected individuals fall. For example, a syncope- related fall resulting in 
cerebral injury and death has been reported  after vaccination.
4 Rarely, syncope can be 
followed by a brief tonic -clonic  seizure.1 In addition to the potential for injury, syncopal 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_425519].  Moreover, syncopal epi[INVESTIGATOR_425520]- exposure can potentiate risk for development of more 
severe reactions to similar stimuli over  time (e.g., blood- injection- injury phobia).
[ADDRESS_537625] -vaccination syncope 
The National Academy of Medicine (formerly Institute of Medicine) has concluded that 
evidence “convincingly supports a causal relationship between the injection of a vaccine 
and syncope” likely due to a vasovagal reaction.7 Although uncommon , with an estimated 
range of 1.3 - 5 per 1000  in the adolescent age group,8,9  syncope aft er vaccination can 
lead to serious injury. An analysis of cases reported to Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting 
System ( VAER S) in the 1990s described cases of syncope following immunization.2 
Reported epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (n=697) occurred most frequently among those 10 through 18 years 
of age (45%), in females (58%), and within 15 minutes after vaccination (89%). 
Complications included t onic or clonic movements (24%) and subsequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
(10%). Reported serious adverse events associated with post -vaccination syncope 
included concussion, skull fracture, intracranial bleeding, cerebral contusions, and a 
motor vehicle collision due to syncope while driving.

9 Following the introduction of new vaccines for adolescents (i.e., Tetanus, Diphtheria and 
Pertussis ( Tdap ), Meningococcal ( MCV4 ), Human papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] ( HPV)) between 2005-
2007, the number of cases of post -vaccination syncope reported to VAERS increased, 
primarily among females 11- [ADDRESS_537626] -vaccination 
syncope was 9.7 per 100,000 immunization epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  The rate of syncope was higher 
among females, declined with increasing age, and increased with increasing number of 
injections per immunization epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. Injuries occurred in approximately 7% of 
encounters for post -vaccination syncope, including head wounds, contusions, 
concussions, facial and clavicle fractures, and intracranial and ocular injuries.[ADDRESS_537627] -blood- donation vasovagal (not volume depletion) 
syncope include: 1) younger (adolescents)  and first time donors; 2) anxiety; 3) needle 
phobia; and 4) prior history of syncope from needle- related event(s).6,11,14,16,17,20-24  Some 
publications also cite increases in syncope among females;11,16,17,21,23-25 and among 
those with a prior history of fainting or feeling faint (due to any reason) .17,22,23  Blood 
donation literature also suggests that vasovagal syncope is more common among 
Caucasians as compared to African -Americans ,17,24 and in persons with lower body 
mass index (BMI) as compared to greater BMI .[ADDRESS_537628] -

10 if a patient becomes weak or dizzy or loses consciousness. Adolescents and adults 
should be seated or lying down during vaccination. Vaccine providers, particularly when 
vaccinating adolescents, should consider observing patients (with patients seated or 
lying down) for [ADDRESS_537629] -
vaccination syncope because blood donation involves a significant loss of intravascular volume, takes a longer period of  time than vaccination, and only volunteers donate 
blood; in addition, most donors are adults ≥[ADDRESS_537630] effective in 
the blood donation setting: acute water loading,  and applied muscle tension.  Review of 
blood donation literature indicates that consuming approximately [ADDRESS_537631] -time blood donors .  Consuming water  stretch es  
baroreceptors in the stomach wall  which reflexively increases  peripheral vascular tone, 
and tempor arily decreas es vasovagal -mediated hypotonia; this vasovagal tone 
mitigating response  is also believed to be achieved through effects on the portal venous 
system from ingesti ng a hypo- osmolar beverage.
27-[ADDRESS_537632], applied muscle tension can 
increase venous return, and thus help maintain blood pressure.  A  randomized 
prospective study found that applied muscle tension (AMT)  reduced vasovagal 
symptoms in blood donors by 50%, from 16% to 8%  among blood dono rs.22 The 
mechanism of action may involve a combination of factors, including increased venous 
return and through distraction and reduction of anxiety.22,28 However, a systematic 
review and meta -analysis of interventions to reduce vasovagal reactions in blood donors 
found no significant r eduction in vasovagal reactions among 8 AMT studies that included 
3500 subjects.21  Thus far, no single intervention has been shown to be effective for 
preventing vasovagal symptoms and/or syncope during blood donation in all age 
groups.   
 
Unlike the blood donation literature,  there are limited data on effective strategies to 
prevent post -vaccination vasovagal syncope. Only one randomized clinical trial has 
assessed an intervent ion to prevent post -vaccination syncope. A recent Clinical 
Immunization Safety A ssessment (CISA) randomized clinical trial (Kemper et al, 
ClinicalTrials.gov [STUDY_ID_REMOVED])30 asses sed the effectiveness of pre -vaccination 
hydration with water to prevent presyncope (used as a surrogate for syncope). Drinking 
some water before vaccination was not effective in preventing presyncope and by 
[CONTACT_425529], prompting CISA to plan evaluations of other simple interventions that 
could be used in busy clinical settings. The hydration study demonstrated  the following 
as risk factors for post -vaccination presyncope among subjects 11 -21 years : receiving 
more than one injectable vaccine; age younger than 15 years; having higher pre-
Syncope Prevention Study  Version 2.0 
March 4, 2021  
 
11 vaccination anxiety levels; history of passing out or nearly passing out after a “shot” or 
blood draw  within the preceding 5 years , and having higher levels of pain after 
vaccination (presumed injection- site pain).15 These predictors may inform other 
strategies for preventing pre- syncope such as reducing immediate pain after vaccination 
in addition to promoting relaxation and reducing anxiety  around the time of vaccination.  
 The use of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_425521]® 
(combination vibration and cool pack applied to planned injection sites shortly before 
injections), have been shown to decrease injection site pain, which might play a role in 
decreasing injection pain -associated vasovagal symptoms.
31,32 Buzzy® | Drug Free 
Pain Relief is a reusable medical device designed to reduce vaccination pain 
[https://buzzyhelps.com/]. The Buzzy® device is applied to a targeted skin area for 30-
60 seconds in order to cool/numb the area and provide vibration to desens itize pain 
receptors (nociceptors) prior to injection, then the device is moved just proximal to the 
site during injection. The device has been found to decrease pain and anxiety  in 
children aged 7 years receiving DTaP in a prospectiv e, randomized controll ed trial.33 
Likewise, in a separate prospective, randomized controlled trial  of 497 employees 
receiving influenza vaccine,  those randomized to use Buzzy® prior to vaccination 
reported less pain.34  Another prospective, open- label randomized trial in 50 children 
between the ages of 3 and 18 demonstrated the Buzzy ® lowered child- reported pain 
but did not impact child- reported anxiety or how much pain the child expected.[ADDRESS_537633] 
shown some effecti veness in decreasing medically -related anxiety23,31,32 and pain.36  In 
particular, distraction has been investigated as a technique to reduce vaccination pain 
in children and adolescents. One systematic review identified various distraction 
techniques, including verbal distraction, video distrac tion, breathing tasks (e.g., blowing 
bubbles, party blowers , etc. ), and musical distraction.37 Results suggested  that 
breathing tasks and musical distraction showed beneficial effects in reducing pain and 
distress from vaccinations in children younger than 12.  Video distraction demonstrated 
beneficial results in reducing distress in children and adolescents. 38 An additional 
review focused specifically on the use of iPads with video games or cartoons as a 
distraction to reduce the parent’s perception of their child’s pain and distress during 
vaccinations.  This study found that the parents of the children using iPads perceived 
significantly lower levels of fear and anxiety in their children than those in the control 
group.39 The use of iPads as a distraction tool also improved parental satisfaction with 
pain reduction practices used for their child.  
 
In a recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_425522] -
based interventions aimed at reducing presyncope symptoms among adoles cents 
receiving vaccines (Walter et al, ClinicalTrials.gov [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) .  Adolescents 
receivin g one or more vaccines (at least one administered intramuscularly) were 
randomized to use Buzzy ® prior to vaccination, choose music from a streaming internet 
music service to listen to prior to and during vaccination or to do both.  Both 
interventions were found to be acceptable and feasible.  However, neither intervention 
required ongoing and active engagement of the adolescent during the vaccination 
process , and hence,  may ultimately be less effective at distraction and reducing anxiety 
than an intervention requiring more active participation.23 In this study , we aim to pair

involvement.   
1.[ADDRESS_537634] -vaccination syncope is an 
uncommon event, we will use presyncopal (vasovagal) signs and symptoms as a 
surrogate marker for syncope, as was done in the earlier CISA study. Based on our review of available literature, which does not identify one intervention with high efficacy, 
we plan to investigate the combination of two interventions  designed  to prevent post -
vaccination syncope through mitigation of immediate injection- site pain and anxiety , 
both factors  that we have identified as occurring more frequently  among adolescents 
with post-vaccination presyncope. In summary , we aim to assess the acceptability  and 
efficacy  among adolescent s of using  a paired intervention that includes  Buzzy®  to 
reduce injection site pain and a simple electronic game employed as an active  
distraction to prevent post -vaccination presyncope.

15 4 DEFINING PRESYNCOPE  AND SYNCOPE  
4.1 Presyncope  
 
For this study, the case definition of presyncope was based on review of the literature, 
an amended Blood Donations Reactions Inventory (BDRI)  which was used in previous 
studies  including the CISA Hydration Study , expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649],  and prior experience with 
the CISA hydration study .12-14 Although there may be measurable physiological changes 
with presyncope (e.g., decrease in heart rate or blood pressure), there are no 
established cut -offs that define presyncope.  Therefore,  the case definition is based on 
subjective criteria.  The case definition previously used in CISA hydration study to 
Prevent Post -Vaccination Presyncope (“Water and Vaccines Study”)  is outlined below  
and will be used as the primary definition of presyncope in this study : 
 
Primary definition:  Sudden onset of one or more of the following symptoms (reported as 
“a little bit”, “somewhat” or “a lot”) or signs during the post -vaccination observation period 
in the clinic:  
 
Symptoms  
• Feeling like you might “pass out” or faint  
• Feeling dizzy, like the room is spi[INVESTIGATOR_334]  
• Feeling weak  
• Feeling like your face is getting red and warm (or hot), like blushing or flushing 
• Noticing any change in your vision, like spots or flickering lights, tunnel vision, or 
loss of vision  
• Experiencing ringing in your ears, decreased hearing, or sounds seem far away  
• Feeling lightheaded  
• Feeling like your heart is beating fast or hard or pounding 
• Feeling hot or  sweaty  
• Feeling cold or “clammy”  
• Feeling like you are breathing fast or hard  
• Feeling  like you might throw up (nausea)  
 
Signs  
• Pallor  
• Sweat iness  
• Facial flush 
• Decreased interactivity (decreased level of arousal or responsiveness)  
 
AND  
• Not syncope  
• Not due to another cause 
• Not clearly present at baseline  
 
In exploratory analyses we will employ two alternate case definitions for presyncope.  
 
Alternate definition 1: Sudden onset of one or more of the above  symptoms (reported as 
“somewhat” or “a lot” ) or signs during the post -vaccination observation period in the 
clinic . 
 
Syncope Prevention Study  Version 2.0 
March 4, 2021  
 
16 Alternate definition 2: Sudden onset of one or more of the following symptoms  limited to  
feeling like you might pass out, dizziness, weakness, or lightheadedness symptoms 
(reported as “a little bit”, “somewhat” or “a lot”) or signs during the post-vaccination 
observation period in the clinic .  
4.2 Syncope  
 
Syncope (fainting) that occurs in an otherwise healthy person after receipt of a vaccine 
or during venipuncture is usually attributed to vasovagal syncope, and may occur alone 
(simple syncope) or may be associated with tonic -clonic movements (convulsive 
syncope, anoxic seizure).12,[ADDRESS_537635] defined syncope 
as:  Any sudden and brief loss of consciousness or postural tone after vaccination from 
which recovery is  spontaneous and is not attributed to another cause (e.g., anaphylaxis) .  
For purposes of this study, cases counted as syncope must occur during the post -

17 5 STUDY DESIGN 
 
This study  is a prospective, randomized clinical trial  that will be conducted in 
adolescents (10 through 1 4 years of age) receiving at least one recommended 
intramuscular ly administered vaccine to evaluate the efficacy  and acceptability of using 
two different , simultaneously administered interventions that might prevent post -
vaccination presyncope, and by [CONTACT_425529].   The two interventions to be evaluated together are Buzzy® , which is a medical device designed to reduce 
vaccination pain,  and an electronic game.   We will evaluate both interventions when 
administered simult aneously ( Buzzy® and electronic game) .  We will enroll 
approximately 340 subjects into this study.  Eligible adolescents  will be randomized  (1:1) 
to either the intervention or control  group:  1) intervention ( Buzzy® and electronic game ); 
or 2) control  (usual care)  to assess for acceptability and efficacy . Detailed data will be 
collected and described from study participants including demographics, medical history, 
baseline anxiety, and needle phobia. Participants will be observed for [ADDRESS_537636] -vaccination pain (within 1 minute and at 10 minutes) , and the 
occurrence of witnessed syncope or presyncope, and presyncopal  symptoms as rated 
by [CONTACT_425530] . For the primary objective, we will assess the efficacy  of the  
intervention to decrease presyncope symptoms or signs as compared to usual care . For 
the secondary objectives we will assess  the pre-  and post -vaccination anxiety score, the 
immediate post -vaccination injection- site pain score, and the acceptability of the 
intervention.   For the exploratory object ives we will assess the efficacy  of the 
intervention to decrease presyncope symptoms or signs as compared to usual care 
using alternate case definitions for presyncope and we will assess factors associated 
with post -vaccination presyncope.

7.4 Demographic Information, Medical History 
 
The participant’s  gend er, age, and race/ethnicity  will be obtained from parent/guardian 
report at the time of enrollment.  The participant’s medical history including: history of 
pre-syncope, syncope, cardiac history, seizures, hypoglycemia, diabetes, prescription 
and over -the counter medications in the preceding week, and supplements in the 
preceding week will be obtained by [CONTACT_425533] (EHR) and will be reviewed and confirmed with the parent/guardian at the time of enrollment.  
 
7.5 Physical Measures  
 
Participants’  height, weight and calculated BMI will be obtained at enrollment or from the 
clinical measurements collected at the visit. P ulse-rate and blood pressure will also be 
obtained at baseline from the clinical measurements. Height, weight, pulse rate,  and 
blood pressure measurements will be performed by [CONTACT_425534].  In addition,  the clinic baseline pain assessment will be recorded.   
7.6 Needle Related Fear  
 
Fear of having blood drawn has been shown to be predictive of vasovagal reactions in 
young blood donors.6 In blood donors fear was assessed using a global question. “How 
afraid are you of having blood drawn from your arm?”  A  similarly worded global question 
will be used to assess fear of vaccination.  “How afraid are you of getting a vaccine 
(shot) in your arm?”  Responses will be graded using a Likert scale  which will have a 
range from  0, which indicates  not at all afraid , to [ADDRESS_537646] complete a 
questionnaire to assess generalized anxiety using the  Patient Reported Outcome 
Measurement Information System  (PROMIS ) Pediatric  Anxiety Short Form v2.0 8a 
instrument for adolescents (11- 17 years) to categorize their overall degree of anxiety.[ADDRESS_537647]’s score and answers will be shared with the 
subject’s primary care physician.  
7.8 Randomization  
 
Participants will be randomized (1:1) to receive either Buzzy® and electronic game  or 
the control  using a permuted block randomization scheme.   A minimum of [ADDRESS_537648] statistician at Duke University will generate randomization schemes, which will be 
uploaded to REDCap. The randomization schedule will not be available to the study 
staff, so the next randomization allocation will not be known before randomization occurs. Following confirmation of study eligibility criteria during Visit 1, participant 
randomization will be through REDCap with treatment allocation recorded on the CRF.  
 
7.8.1 Blinding  
Study staff and  subjects will not be blinded to treatment arm assignments.  
 
7.9 Study Interventions  
 
7.9.1 Buzzy ® and Electronic Game  Intervention 
Participants randomized to Buzzy® and the electronic game  will apply  or have Buzzy ® 
applied by a member of the study team . Buzzy®  XL Healthcare Professional will be 
applied as described in the package insert on the deltoid vaccination site for 30 -60 
seconds . Then, the  Buzzy®  will be moved proximal to the injection site keepi[INVESTIGATOR_425523]’s®  switch/head toward the brain or spi[INVESTIGATOR_425524].  The procedures for 
applying Buzzy® are consistent with the procedures on the package insert  (Appendix 
A).  If vaccines are given in more than one arm, Buzzy ® will be placed on both arms with 
the assistance of the study coordinator. Buzzy ® will be removed from the vaccination 
site(s) following vaccination. The start and stop time of Buzzy ® placement will be 
recorded.  If more than one vaccination is given in a single arm only one Buzzy® device 
will be applied per package instructions.  
Syncope Prevention Study  Version 2.[ADDRESS_537649] -
vaccination observation period.   The participant will be provided with the guidance 
(derived from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) General Best 
Practices Guidelines for Immunization)
[ADDRESS_537650] -vaccination wait period.   Movement from room to room  or if the patient decides 
to stand should be noted by [CONTACT_5984].   No instruction will be provided to the 
participant regarding sitting or standing unless the participant starts to exhibit signs of 
presyncope.  
 
7.9.2 Control  Group  
This in tervention group will receive usual care during vaccination.  Usual care will include 
not receiving the Buzzy®  and electronic game combination intervention and will also 
consist of the patient waiting in the exam room for [ADDRESS_537651] -vaccination observation period.  
Movement from room to room should be noted by [CONTACT_5984].  
 
 
7.10 Immunizations Administered  During Visit  
 
Vaccines received as part of usual  care during the visit will be documented by [CONTACT_75275].  Documentation will include: product name [CONTACT_425547], lot number, site 
and date/time of vaccine administered during study participation.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_537652] Vaccination  Pain Assessment   
 
The Wong Bake r Faces Pain Scale will be used to assess pain.43   The Wong-  Baker 
Faces Pain Scale scores pain on a 0- 10 metric  with 2 point intervals  and shows a close 
linear relationship with visual analog pain scales across the ages from 11- 17 years  and 
is acceptable for use with younger adolescents as well .  Pain will be assessed at 1  
minute (up to 3 minutes)  and at 10 minutes  (up to 15 minutes ) after vaccination for each 
arm in which a vaccine was received.  The study coordinator will be responsible for 
recording pain scores after vaccination. The time for assessment will start after the last 
injection is  received.   
 
7.12 Presyncope  and Syncope  
 
At 15  minutes  (up to 20 minutes ) following vaccination, study participants will complete 
the BDRI. During the 15 minute (up to 2 0 minute)  observation period, research staff  
Syncope Prevention Study  Version 2.[ADDRESS_537653] any observed signs (pallor, sweating, facial  flush or decreased 
interactivity) or spontaneous subject reports of symptoms of witnessed presyncope as 
described in Section 4.1.  Subjects who developed post -vaccination syncope as 
described in Section 4.[ADDRESS_537654] who develops presyncope or 
syncope.   
7.13 Acceptability  
 
At the end of the study visit, we will survey participants about the acceptability of the 
intervention to which they were assigned.  Where appropriate, a Likert scale (strongly 
agree, agree, neither, disagree, strongly disagree) will be used to assess acceptability 
responses.   Alternately, a yes or no response to survey questions  will be solicited.  
7.14 Unsolicited SAEs 
 
Administration of vaccine is not itself a study procedure in the study population, and 
thus vaccine adverse events, including presyncope or syncope, are not considered 
study related adverse events . If indicated, however, v accine- related SAEs will be 
report ed to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) in accordance 
with standard procedures. Information about such events will be included in the 
study data as noted on the VAERS website (https://VAERS.hhs.gov).   
 
All serious adverse events (SAE s) occurring during the period of study participation 
will be reported to the IRBs overseeing this study and to the CDC within 24 hours of 
study staff awareness of the event. Given the short duration of study participation 
and nature of the study, SAE s would not be expected to occur in this study.  
 
An SAE is defined as an AE that meets one of the following conditions:  
•Results in death during the period of protocol -defined surveillance  
•Is life -threatening (defined as immediate risk of death at the time of the event)  
•Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_188926] -defined surveillance 
or results in prolongation of existing inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (other than routine 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_425525] & delivery) .  
•Results in congenital anomaly or birth defect  
•Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
•Any other important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, 
or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], may be considered an SAE when, based upon 
appropriate medical jud gment, the event may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at  home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that 
do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.  
 
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Data will be handled according to the Duke Vaccine and Trials Unit SOP (DVTU M010) 
and captured on paper CRFs and entered into the REDCap database. All data for this 
study will reside on a secure Duke server maintained by [CONTACT_213064] (DHTS).  A  database will be developed and a dataset without personal 
Syncope Prevention Study  Version 2.0 
March 4, 2021  
 
26 identifiers will be made available to the CDC for analysis purpose.  All analyses will be 
performed using SAS version 9.4.  
8.1 Sample Size and Power Estimation  
 
The study has approximately 82.0% power to reject the null hypothesis of no difference 
in the proportion of adolescents with presyncope or syncope after vaccination in the 
intervention (vibration and cool pack device [Buzzy ®] and an electronic game) group 
compared to the control (usual care) group based on a two- side alpha 0.[ADDRESS_537655] with N=1 60 per group. This assumes that the proportion of adolescents with 
presyncope or syncope after vaccination will be 25% in the control  group and 2- fold 
lower  (12.5%) in the intervention group.15 This assumption is based on a review of the 
literature and expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. We plan to enroll approximately 340 adolescents for this 
study with the assumption of  a 5% drop out rate, thus providing at least [ADDRESS_537656] approximately 82% power.  
8.[ADDRESS_537657] 
one ACIP recommended vaccine administered intramuscularly.  Participants will be 
randomized into either  of the two  groups:  intervention (vibration and cool pack device 
[Buzzy®] and an electronic game) o r the control (usual care ).     
 
There will be two study populations used for data analysis in this study. These are 
defined below:   
• Modified Intent -to-treat ( MITT) population:  is defined as those 
subjects who are enrolled, randomized into the study , and received an 
intramuscular vaccine.    
• Per-protocol population:   is defined as those subjects who are 
randomized, have received at least one dose of an intramuscularly 
administered vaccine, have completed all study procedures , and have 
no protocol violations that are likely to affec t the objectives.  
 
The primary and exploratory objective analyses will be performed in the M ITT and P er-
protocol populations, or only the M ITT population if no subject is excluded from the per 
protocol population.  No adjustments will be made to the alpha level (two- sided 
alpha=0.05) for the study objectives described below.  
 
8.2.2 Descriptive Statistics  
Descriptive analyses will be conducted for demographic variables and for baseline 
characteristics (e.g., fatigue,  hunger, thirst, needle fear and phobia, and an anxiety  rating 
scale  score).  Continuous variables will be summarized with standard descriptive 
statistics including means, medians, 95% CI , and standard deviations.  Categorical 
variables will be summarized with frequencies and percentages.  Ninety -five percent 
confidence intervals will be provided for descriptive statistics, as warranted. The 
descriptive statistics w ill be analyzed in the M ITT and P er-protocol populations.   
 
Syncope Prevention Study  Version 2.0 
March 4, 2021  
 
27 8.2.3 Primary Objective (PO 1 ):  
The primary objective is to assess if simultaneous use of a vibration and cool pack  
device ( Buzzy® ) and an electronic game before and during intramuscular vaccination 
will reduce risk  for presyncope or syncope after vaccination in adolescents. The 
proport ion of adolescents with presyncope or syncope after vaccination will be compared 
between the control and intervention groups using a chi -square test.   
 
8.2.4 Secondary and Exploratory Objectives 
Secondar y Objective (S O 1):  
The first secondary objective is to compare the change  in state anxiety score for 
adolescents before and after vaccination in the control group to the intervention 
group.  The categorical change in the anxiety score (positive, negative, and no change) 
in pre-  and post - vaccination state  anxiety will be presented  by [CONTACT_425535] a tabular format.  
A comparison of the two study groups will be made using a Mantel -Haenszal statistic 
(row mean scores difference with standardized midranks scores [modified ridit scores]) . 
Descriptive statistics (e. g., mean, 95% CI , min, max) of the pre - minus post - vaccination 
state anxiety will be presented by [CONTACT_425536]- Whitney U/Wilcoxon 
rank-sum test . 
 
Secondary Objective Measure (S O 2):   
The second secondary objective is t o compare the change in injection -site pain after  
vaccination of adolescents in the control group  to the intervention group. The following 
four outcomes will be compared between groups using a chi -square test or a logistic 
regression model to control for covariates:  
• The proportion of adolescents reporting an injection site pain score ≥ 2, on the 
Wong -Baker Faces Pain Scale©, ≤ 1 minute following vaccination 
• The proportion of adolescents reporting an injection site pain score ≥ 4, on the 
Wong -Baker Faces Pain Scale©, ≤ 1 minute following vaccination 
• The proportion of adolescents reporting an injection site pain score ≥ 2, on the 
Wong -Baker Faces Pain Scale©, at (approximately) 10 minutes following 
vaccination  
• The proportion of adolescents reporting an injection site pain s core ≥ 4, on the 
Wong -Baker Faces Pain Scale©, at (approximately) 10 minutes following 
vaccination.  
 
Descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, 95% CI  , min, max) of injection -site pain scores on the 
Wong -Baker Faces Pain Scale© at ≤  1 and minute  and at (approximately) 10 minutes  
following vaccination will be presented by [CONTACT_425536] -Whitney 
U/Wilcoxon rank -sum test . 
 
 
Secondary  Objective Measure (S O 3):   
The third secondary objective is t o assess the acceptability of the intervention among the 
adolescents  based on their positive or negative responses for each survey item. The 
groups will be compared for each survey item using a chi -square test.  
 
Exploratory Objective (EO 1):  
Syncope Prevention Study  Version 2.[ADDRESS_537658] exploratory objective is to assess if using Buzzy®  and an electronic game 
before and during intramuscular vaccination will reduce risk  for presyncope or syncope 
after vaccination using alternate case definitions for presyncope.   The proportion of 
adolescents with presyncope or syncope, using the two alternate case definitions for 
presyncope described in Section 4, after vaccination will be compared between the 
control and intervention groups will be compared using a chi -square test.  
 
Exploratory Objective (EO  2): 
This explor atory objective is to assess for factors associated with post -vaccination 
presyncope in adolescents in the control and intervention groups. This objective will be 
conducted using the primary and alternate case definitions for presyncope described in 
Sectio n 4. A logistic regression model with select covariates ( e.g., demographic data, 
hunger, thirst, fear, phobia, anxiety level, pain) will be used to evaluate factors associated with post -vaccination presyncope and syncope.  The relative risk and 
associated 95% confidence interval will also be reported.  
8.[ADDRESS_537659] will be substantial and will require a sophisticated, practical and flexible system that can accommodate different 
modes of data collection and several separate linked surveys. The Vanderbilt -designed 
resource developed specifically for online collection of research information, the 
Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) platform, will be used to design study 
forms, inclu ding the reaction forms, and short customized questionnaires to collect 
information from study subjects. This system will be used by [CONTACT_425537].  All electronic linkages will fulfill regulations for protection of human subjects and 
requiremen ts to minimize the risk of breach of confidentiality. After initial set -up, the work 
load required for electronic data collection will be substantially reduced (description of 
REDCap resources below).

participants, will be maintained in secure research offices at Duke, which are acc essible 
to research staff only.  
 
8.3.1 Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)  
Investigators within the NIH -funded Clinical and Translational Research Unit at 
Vanderbilt have developed REDCap ( http://project -redcap.org/ ), to collect and manage 
data for diverse clinical and translational research studies. REDCap was designed around the concept of giving research teams an easy method to specify project needs 
and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_174848], web- based applications for collection , management and 
sharing of research data. REDCap accomplishes these key functions through use of a 
single study metadata table referenced by [INVESTIGATOR_44605]- level operational modules. 
Based on this abstracted programming model, databases are developed in an efficient manner with little resource investment beyond the creation of a single data dictionary. 
The concept of metadata -driven application development is well established, and the 
critical factor for successful data collection lies in creating a simple w orkflow 
methodology allowing research teams to autonomously develop study -related metadata 
in an efficient manner.  REDCap  includes secure institutional data hosting and includes 
full audit -trails in compliance w ith Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
(HIPAA)  security requirements. The REDCap Consortium is compr ised of [ADDRESS_537661] . The Duke University  PI (Emmanuel “Chip” Walter ) will oversee the 
study .  CDC staff will collaborate with the site to develop the protocol, conduct the study, 
ensure the study is aligned with US Department of Health and Human Services public 
health priorities, and analyze the data and disseminate the results. CDC may receive

9.1 Human Subjects Involvement, Characteristics, and Design  
 
Duke inves tigators will be responsible for submitting the protocol, informed consent  
(Appendix B), recruitment letters, flyers, and any written or verbally conveyed materials  
specific to this project to their institutional review boards.   CDC staff will be responsible 
for submitting materials to the CDC for review and obtain reliance on Duke IRB .   
  
To facilitate subject recruitment at the practices, we will request a waiver of consent  and 
HIPAA authorization for ascertainment (identification, selection) and/or recruitment of 
potential subjects while recording identifiable private health information (PHI)  prior to 
obtaining the subject’s consent.  This information will be obtained from review of the electronic scheduling and medical record systems in the c linics  in order to determine 
eligibility for study enrollment. We will review only the minimum amount of information 
necessary to determine potential eligibilit y. This information will be used to recruit  and 
Syncope Prevention Study  Version 2.[ADDRESS_537662] the study sites . 
 Continuing reviews will be submitted to Duke’s  IRB on an annual basis.  P rotocol 
deviations or concerns about study integrity will be reported promptly to the overseeing 
IRB in accordance with institutional requirements . CDC staff will be responsible for 
submitting materials to the CDC for review and obtain reliance on Duke IRB .  
 
9.[ADDRESS_537663] and patient report.  The research staff will 
administer the beverage and food intake assessment, needle phobia assessment, anxiety assessment, pain assessment, presyncope symptoms assessment, repeat 
anxiety assessment and the acceptability assessment to the subjects.     
9.3 Potential Risks and Benefits  
 
There is the potential risk of loss of confidentiality about information obtained as part of 
this study.   
 
There is the also the potential that adolescent subjects could experience some 
discomfort from the intervention they are randomized to such as  annoyance or 
movement limitation due to the electronic game  or the cold sensation of the Buzzy®.  
 
In addition,  talking to or reporting about feelings of anxiety may temporarily increase a 
subject ’s awareness of this experience and increase distress . 
 
One potential benefit includes less injection site pain due to administration of Buzzy® on 
the subject’s arm.  Adolescents may also be distracted from the vaccination by [CONTACT_425538].

We are asking you to allow your child to take part in a research study because they are scheduled to 
have a routine vaccine.  Research studies are voluntary and include only people who choose to take part.  
Please read this consent form carefully and take your time making your decision. Please ask the study 
doctor or study staff to explain anything that you do not clearly understand.  The nature of the study, 
risks, inconveniences, discomforts, and other important information about the study are listed below.
Please tell the study doctor or study staff if your child is taking part in another research study.
[CONTACT_425550] will conduct the study and it is being funded by [CONTACT_27388] (CDC).  The sponsor of this study, the CDC, will pay Duke University to perform this 
research, and these funds may pay part of [CONTACT_192096]’s salary.
WHO WILL BE MY DOCTOR ON THIS STUDY?
If you decide to have your child participate, [CONTACT_192096] will be your child’s doctor for the study.  He will 
be in contact [CONTACT_425540]’s regular health care provider while your child is in the study and 
afterwards, if needed.CONCISE SUMMARY
This is a research study to test a strategy designed to prevent fainting (syncope) or symptoms that 
might occur before fainting (presyncope) in adolescents [ADDRESS_537670] one injected vaccine.  
Adolescents in this study will be randomly assigned (like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin) to one of two groups.  
Adolescents in Group [ADDRESS_537671] a vibrating cooling device 
(like a small ice pack) named Buzzy® placed on the arm/s where they will receive their shot/s.  
Adolescents in Group [ADDRESS_537672] pain from the needles.  Adolescents will also 
be asked about their vaccination experience, and those in Group 1 will be asked about the electronic 
game and Buzzy.
Only minor risks are expected from this study.  Your child may feel slight discomfort from the 
vibration and coolness of the Buzzy®.  Your children may also experience some uneasiness 
answering some of the questions.

WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?
The purpose of this study is to see how well a strategy designed to prevent fainting or symptoms related 
to fainting following vaccination works in children 10 through 14 years of age who are receiving one or 
more injected vaccines. Our strategy is to apply a cold, vibrating device named Buzzy® on their arm/s 
where they are getting their shot/s just prior to and during the shot/s.  If your child is in this group, they 
will also play an electronic game for 5 minutes prior to, during and after their shot/s. In this study, we 
will look at whether applying Buzzy® on the arm and playing an electronic game versus usual care 
makes people feel better during and after receiving vaccinations.  Those receiving Buzzy® and the game 
will have Buzzy® applied to the arm for 30-60 seconds prior to vaccination and during the vaccination.  
The electronic game will be played for about 5 minutes before vaccination, during vaccination, and for a 
minimum of 1 minute and up to 15 minutes following vaccination.
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?
Approximately 340 children will take part in this study at Duke.
WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE STUDY?
If you agree for your child to be in this study, you will be asked to sign and date this consent form.  
Your child must also agree to participate in the study.  We will also ask your child if he/she agrees to 
participate, and if 12 years or older, we will ask him/her to sign this form.  
A member of the study staff will ask you questions regarding your child’s health (including medical 
history and current medications).  The medical history is obtained to make sure that your child is healthy 
and is eligible to participate.  If your child is not eligible, he/she will not be enrolled, and no further 
procedures will be done.
Your child will be randomly assigned (like flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a coin) to one of 2 groups:
Group Strategy What is involved
1 Buzzy® + 
electronic 
gameWear Buzzy® on arm just prior to and during shot/s and play an electronic 
game 3-[ADDRESS_537674] an equal chance of being assigned to each of the groups.  Regardless of which 
group your child is assigned to, he/she will receive the usual standard of care for vaccinations, including 
monitoring for about 20 minutes after being vaccinated.
FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS:
All participants will be asked about their medical history, current health status, recent sleep, and about 
the last time they ate or drank.  We will also ask questions about fear of shots, pain, and anxiety.  In

addition, we will measure temperature, weight, height, pulse rate and blood pressure if not already 
measured by [CONTACT_425541].  All subjects will be monitored for about 20 minutes 
after the vaccination, also called the wait period.  Your child will also be provided with the CDC’s 
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices guidance that they may choose to sit or lie down during 
the post-vaccination wait period.
FOR PARTICIPANTS ASSIGNED TO THE BUZZY® + ELECTRONIC GAME GROUP:
In addition to the activities that occur for all participants, those who are assigned to the Buzzy® + 
electronic game group will be asked to play an electronic game on an iPad provided by [CONTACT_3476].  
They will play the electronic game for 3 to 5 minutes prior to vaccination, during their vaccination, and 
for 1-15 minutes following vaccination.  Buzzy® will be applied on their upper arm/s near the area 
where they will get their shot/s for 30-60 seconds prior to getting their shots.  Buzzy® will be moved 
further up on their upper arm during the actual vaccine injection.  If getting shots in both arms, Buzzy® 
will be applied on both upper arms before and during the injection.  
HOW LONG WILL MY CHILD BE IN THIS STUDY?
If you agree for your child to take part in this study, your child’s involvement may last for up to two 
hours.
You can choose to have your child stop participating at any time without penalty or loss of any benefits 
to which you or your child are entitled.  However, if you decide to stop participating in the study, we 
encourage you to talk to your study doctor first.
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY?
Your child is receiving vaccinations today as part of their routine care and not as a part of this study.
Your child’s health care provider will explain the risks related to the vaccines to you before your child is 
vaccinated. 
As a result of your child participating in this study, they are at risk for the following side effects.  You 
should discuss these with the study doctor and your child’s regular health care provider if you choose.  
There may be some temporary discomfort associated with wearing Buzzy® on the arm as it applies a 
cold sensation, like wearing an ice pack, and vibrations to the arm. There are few known risks to 
interacting with an age-appropriate electronic game, and these may include fatigue or boredom.
Your child may also experience some uneasiness from answering some of the questions. These 
questions will be asked verbally by [CONTACT_425542] a written format. 
There is also the potential risk of loss of confidentiality about information obtained as part of this study.  
Please see below for additional information regarding confidentiality.
There may be risks, discomforts, or side effects that are not yet known.

ARE THERE BENEFITS TO TAKING PART IN THE STUDY?
There might be no direct benefit to your child for participating in this study, especially if your child is 
randomized to the usual care group. However, it is possible that participation in this study could 
decrease your child’s chance of fainting or feeling faint after vaccination.  There is also a possible 
benefit of decreased pain associated with vaccination due to the cold and vibration mechanism of 
Buzzy®.  We hope that in the future the information learned from this study will benefit other children.  
WILL MY CHILD’S INFORMATION BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL?
Participation in research may involve some loss of privacy. We will do our best to make sure that 
information about your child is kept confidential, but we cannot guarantee total confidentiality. Your 
child’s personal information may be viewed by [CONTACT_425543], funding, and regulating the study. We will share only the 
minimum necessary information in order to conduct the research. If questionnaires suggest that your 
child is having considerable anxiety, we will inform your child’s health care provider. Your child’s 
personal information may also be given out if required by [CONTACT_2371]. 
As part of the study, results of your child’s study-related procedures may be reported to CDC and its 
affiliates. In addition, your child’s records may be reviewed in order to meet federal or state regulations. 
Reviewers may include representatives and affiliates of the CDC, the Duke University Health System 
Institutional Review Board, and others as appropriate. If any of these groups review your child’s 
research record, they may also need to review your child’s entire medical record. 
The study results will be retained in your child’s research record for six years after the study is 
completed, or until your child reaches the age of 21, whichever is longer.  At that time, either the 
research information not already in your child's medical record will be destroyed or information 
identifying your child will be removed from such study results at DUHS.  Any research information in 
your child's medical record will be kept indefinitely.
This information may be further disclosed by [CONTACT_82198].  If disclosed by [CONTACT_456], the 
information is no longer covered by [CONTACT_82199].  If this information is disclosed to 
outside reviewers for audit purposes, it may be further disclosed by [CONTACT_425544].
While the information and data resulting from this study may be presented at scientific meetings or 
published in a scientific journal, your child’s name [CONTACT_82202]. If 
the results from this study are published, you may receive notification of this by [CONTACT_31711]. 
Some people or groups who receive your child’s health information might not have to follow the same 
privacy rules. Once your child’s information is shared outside of DUHS, we cannot guarantee that it will 
remain private. If you decide to share your child’s private information with anyone not involved in the

study, the federal law designed to protect your child’s health information privacy may no longer apply to 
the information you have shared.  Other laws may or may not protect sharing of private health 
information.
This study is supported by [CONTACT_7698] (CDC). Because of this 
support, your study information is protected by a Certificate of Confidentiality. 
With this Certificate, the investigators may not disclose research information that may identify you in 
any Federal, State, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings, unless you 
have consented for this use. Research information protected by [CONTACT_425545]:
1) there is a law that requires disclosure (such as to report child abuse or communicable diseases 
but not for legal proceedings);
2) you have consented to the disclosure, including for your medical treatment; or
3) the research information is used for other scientific research, as allowed by [CONTACT_129506].
Disclosure is required, however, for audit or program evaluation requested by [CONTACT_82197] (FDA).
You should understand that a Confidentiality Certificate does not prevent you or a member of your 
family from voluntarily releasing information about yourself or your involvement in this research. If you

WHAT ABOUT MY RIGHTS TO DECLINE PARTICIPATION OR WITHDRAW FROM THE 
STUDY?
Your decision to allow your child to be in this study is voluntary.  You may choose not to have your 
child be in this study, or, if you agree to allow your child to be in the study, you may withdraw your 
child from the study at any time. If your child withdraws from the study, no new data about your child 
will be collected for study purposes unless the data concerns an adverse event (a bad effect) related to 
the study.
If such an adverse event occurs, we may need to review your child’s entire medical record.  All data that 
have already been collected for study purposes, and any new information about an adverse event related 
to the study, will be sent to the study sponsor. We may want to have an investigator assess your child.
Your decision for your child not to participate or to withdraw your child from the study will not involve 
any penalty or loss of benefits to which he/she are entitled, and will not affect their access to health care 
at Duke. Your child can still get vaccinated today, regardless of whether or not you agree to participate 
in the study.  If you decide to withdraw your child from the study, we ask that you notify any member of 
the study team during the visit or you can contact [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Walter in writing and let him know that your child 
is withdrawing from the study.  His mailing address is Duke Vaccine and Trials Unit, [ADDRESS_537680], Durham, NC [ZIP_CODE].
The study doctor or sponsor may withdraw your child from this study for any reason at any time even 
without your consent.  This could occur, for example, if the study doctor decides that it is in your child’s 
best interest.  
We will tell you about new information that may affect your child’s health, welfare, or willingness to 
stay in this study.
A description of this clinical trial will be available on https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/  as required by U.S. 
Law.  This Web site will not include information that can identify you or your child.  At most, the Web 
site will include a summary of the results.  You can search this Web site at any time.

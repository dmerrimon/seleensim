Background ( Include relevant experience, gaps in current knowledge, preliminary data, etc .):   
 Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA) are two of the most common orthopedic 
procedures performed i n the [LOCATION_002], with significant growth in procedure volume expected over the 
coming decades.  Coupled with the growing number of surgeries, is a growing cost to perform these procedures. 
In order to accommodate the increased demand for total joint ar throplasty (TJA) while also reducing 
complications and costs, optimized recovery pathways are needed  to enhance resource utilization .  One way to 
significantly impact recovery and  length of stay is for patients to participate in physical therapy earlier in their 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_9694].  In addition to facilitating patient  readiness for discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], early physical 
therapy and ambulation reduces post- operative complications such as venous thromboembolism and 
pneumonia. Multiple factors related to anesthesia can affect a patient’s ability to participate in physical therapy on the day of surgery; these include post-operative nausea and vomiting, orthostatic hypotension and residual 
muscle weakness.  The use  of spi[INVESTIGATOR_72153] A has been shown to reduce the risk of these 
complications .  Short ening the duration of motor blockade in spi[INVESTIGATOR_72154], facilitating early ambulation and discharge t o home.   
Historically , short to intermediate  duration local anesthetics such as lidocaine have been used for spi[INVESTIGATOR_72155].  However , the use of lidocaine in spi[INVESTIGATOR_72156] a high incidence of transient neurologic symptoms (TNS).  
TNS was first defined in 1993, and is defined as a painful condition of the buttocks and thighs with possible radiation to the lower extremities, beginning as soon as a few hours after spi[INVESTIGATOR_72157]. All local anesthetics can cause TNS but it is most commonly associated with lidocaine and  reported to 
occur in 4% to 40% of patients undergoing spi[INVESTIGATOR_72158].  
Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_72159] b een shown to have the lowest incidence of TNS and is currently the most widely used 
medication for spi[INVESTIGATOR_18227].  While advantageous for avoiding TNS, bupi[INVESTIGATOR_72159] a slow onset time 
coupled a long duration of action, which can delay postoperative r ecovery. Low -dose bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (10 mg) 
regimens are increasingly used; however, issues remain with the unpredictable temporal profile. Mepi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 
(70 mg) is a shorter acting local anesthetic compared to bupi[INVESTIGATOR_72160] a more predictable duration of actio n, 
raising interest as an alternative for procedures such as TKA and THA with consistent performance times .   
In this randomized controlled trial, mepi[INVESTIGATOR_72161].  
The primary outcome will be time fr om spi[INVESTIGATOR_72162].  Secondary outcomes will 
evaluate pain scores, opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], urinary retention, transient neurologic symptoms, length of PACU

Study Design and Methods  
 
Methods :  Describe, in detail, the research activities that will be conducted under this protocol :   
 
Preoperative Visit  and Anesthesiologist Assessment : Patients meeting eligibility criteria will be approached 
during their surgical preoperative visit  by [CONTACT_72181] -Principal 
Investigators. Those choosing to participate will be screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients will be assessed for ability to undergo a spi[INVESTIGATOR_72163], but will be counseled that the decision between a spi[INVESTIGATOR_72164]. Thus, patients ma y be withdrawn on the day of surgery if the staff anesthesiologist does not agree with their candidacy 
to undergo a spi[INVESTIGATOR_72163]. Furthermore, patients will be counseled they may be withdrawn from the study if placement of a spi[INVESTIGATOR_72165] o perating room proves unsuccessful and a general anesthetic is required . 
 
Randomization and Blinding: Patients will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_78331] arm will be the 
“Mepi[INVESTIGATOR_10319]” (70 mg) group and the second arm will be the “ Low-Dose Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] ” (10 mg) group. This 
trial will be conducted in a double-blinded manner. The patient and the postoperative outcomes assessors (PACU and Orthopedic Inpatient Nurses and Physical Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]) will be the blinded parties. The anesthesia and surgical teams will n ot be blinded given they won’t be responsible for any assessments. After a patient has 
been consented and enrolled, the study coordinator will randomize the pa tient to either Mepi[INVESTIGATOR_72166]-
Dose Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_72167] a custom electronic randomization system which will be maintained by [CONTACT_4305]. The surgical team and anesthesia team will be notified after the assignment is complete so the surgical listing can be completed with the appropriate medication.   
 
In Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72168]: A standardized study card will be used to track patients throughout their various phases 
of care. At the time of discharge, the cards will be returned to the study coordinator for data entry in a secure spreadsheet available only to study staff. The study will begin with the anesthesiologist recording the time the spi[INVESTIGATOR_72169]. The anesthesiologist will also record the time of incision, time of surgical closure, and time leaving the OR. The PACU nursing staff will then record the time of PACU entry and exit as well as the status of lower extremity function in the non- operative lower extremity at 15 minute intervals. The 
choices will be Bromage 3 (no movement), Bromage 2 (ankle movement only), Bromage 1 (ankle and knee 
movement), Bromage 0 (ankle, knee, and hip movement). Once the patient transitions to the general inpatient floor, the nursing staff will be responsible for recording motor function in a similar fashion at [ADDRESS_78332] 24 hours after surgery, pain scores, presence of nausea and/or vomiting, presence of orthostatic hypotension, and length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  TNS will be evaluated twice, once during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72170]-operative day one and a follow-up phone call performed on 
POD 6 -9 by a study member not blinded to patient assignment.   A standardized questionnaire will be used to 
determine the presence of symptoms of backache.  TNS will be defined as new onset of back pain that radiates

 bilaterally to buttock or distally.  Back pain that does not meet these criteria will not be considered TNS. (ref. 
Anesth Analg 2005;101:661-5)   
Follow-up Evaluation: Assessment will only take place during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72171]. 
There will be  a single phone call during post-operative day 6- 9 for assessment of TNS .

 Statistical C onsiderations 
Randomization 
Subjects will be randomized into one of two study groups: mepi[INVESTIGATOR_72176] -dose bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319].  In order to 
ensure balance on the subject demographics between the two study groups, the subjects will be stratified on procedure (TKA vs THA), gender, age group (≥70 vs. <70) and BMI (≥32 vs. <32).  Within each stratum, subjects will be assigned to either of the two study groups using a computerized dynamic allocation program housed in an online application developed by [CONTACT_72183]. Using dynamic allocation will ensure that the subject allocation will remain balanced on the stratification factors and the study group assignment throughout the entire subject accrual phase.   
Sample Size 
An a priori power analysis was conducted using internal data from Mayo patients undergoing primary TJA with 
mepi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (N=6 ) and low-dose bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (N= 5). In these two cohorts, standard deviations of the time to 
return of full lower extremity motor function were [ADDRESS_78334]  deviation equal to 65.6 minutes. Assuming that similar variability will be 
observed in the proposed study, a sample of 150 subjects per group (300 total) will be required to have 80% power to detect a difference of at least 30 minutes  in mean time to return to full lower extremity motor function 
between the 2 study groups. With the typi[INVESTIGATOR_72177], we anticipate enrollment will be complete within 3 months. 
Endpoints 
 
Primary: Evaluate time to return of lower extremity motor function between mepi[INVESTIGATOR_72150]- dose 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_72178]. This will be assessed by [CONTACT_72184][INVESTIGATOR_72179] 0 function (return of spontaneous ankle, knee, and hip movement) in the non- operative extremity.  
 Secondary: Evaluate postoperative outcomes potentially related to anesthetic administration including pain scores, opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], urinary retention, transient neurologic symptoms, length of PACU stay, length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], time to participation in physical therapy and walking distance with physical therapy. This will be determined by [CONTACT_72185] e and physical therapy charting and review of the medical record.

collected by [CONTACT_72187]. All 
outcomes will be reported descriptively using appropriate summary statistics, including 95% confidence intervals, where appropriate. Because this is a prospective, randomized trial, no formal between-group 
comparisons of baseline covariates will be performed.  The primary study outcome will be time to return of full 
lower extremity motor function . Secondarily, we will as sess a variety of both continuous and categorical 
outcomes between groups including pain scores, opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], urinary retention, transient neurologic 
symptoms, length of PACU stay, length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], time to participation in physical therapy and walking 
distance with physical therapy . Outcomes measured on a continuous scale, including time to full lower 
extremity motor function, length of PACU stay and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], time to participation in physical therapy, and 
walking distance will be compared between the 2 study groups using two- sample t -tests if the data are 
sufficiently normally distributed; otherwise non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum tests will be used. Ordinal variables such as pain scores will be analyzed using non- parametric Wilcoxon r ank sum tests.  Binary and 
nominal categorical outcomes will be compared between the study groups using chi- square tests or Fisher’s 
exact tests, if low expected cell counts are observed. All statistical tests will be two -sided and the threshold of 
statistical signif icance will be set at α = 0.05.   
While it is expected that the study enrollment will be complete in approximately [ADDRESS_78336].

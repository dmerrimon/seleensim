Version 4 (06 June 2022) CONFIDENTIAL  Page 6 of 68  Methodology  
This is a 2 -part, multicenter, Phase 1 study of ANK-700 in patients with RRMS. The 2 parts 
include: 
• Part A – F irst-in-human, single ascending dose (SAD) cohorts 
• Part B – Randomized, double-blind, PBO-controlled, multiple ascending dose (MAD) 
cohorts 
Part A and Part B will be conducted in adult patients (18 to 60 years inclusive, at s creening ), 
diagnosed with RRMS, and an EDSS score ≤  6.5. Patients receiving a stable dose of a 
fumarate drug (i.e. , dimethyl fumarate, diroximel fumarate) for  ≥ 6 months will be allowed to 
remain on the fumarate  drug  throughout the study.  
A copy of the EDSS is available in Appendix 2. 
Part A – SAD 
The SAD pa rt will include up to 3 cohorts of 3 patients each. Patients within each dose cohort 
will each  receive 1 dose of ANK-700 intravenously ( IV) and will be monitored for up to 
6 months. Patients will be dosed ≥  14 days apart to monitor for acute and subacute reactions. 
Patients will arrive at the clinic on the morning of dosing (Day 1 [D1]) and will be monitored 
in the clinic  for 8 hours after completion  of the ANK-700 infusion for assessment of acute 
safety and  PK blood sample collection . Patients will return to the clinic on D4±1 , D15, D29±1 , 
and at 3 and 6 months for follow-up.  In the event that patients are unable to return to the clinic 
for protocol- specified visits, alternative methods for safety assessments and data collection 
may be employed to ensure the safety of the patient  where appropriate. 
Doses evaluated in Part A will include 0.3 mg /kg (Cohort 1), 1.0 mg /kg (Cohort 2), and 
3.0 mg /kg (Cohort 3). After all  patient s within a given dose cohort have been followed for 
≥ [ADDRESS_563372]-dose, a safety review will be performed by [CONTACT_28749] 
(SMC) to review all adverse events ( AEs) and available laboratory test and PK data . Initiation 
of the next higher dose level will commence upon recommendation  by [CONTACT_443053]. 
Please see Table [ADDRESS_563373] MAD cohort (Cohort 4) will be initiated after the safety review of SAD Cohort 2, a 
recommendation to proceed  by [CONTACT_4484], and approval from the Sponsor. 
Patients in the MAD cohorts will be randomized 2:1 to either AN K-700 or PBO . Patients will 
be stratified based upon their use of fumarate medications at study entry within the interactive 
response technology system . A total of 12 patients will be enrolled per dose cohort ( ANK-700, 
n = 8; PB O, n = 4). Patients will arrive at the clinic on the morning of dosing and will be 
monitored in- clinic  for [ADDRESS_563374] infusion for assessment of acute 
safety and PK  blood sample collection . A total of 3 doses (1 dose every 3  days) will be

Version 4 (06 June 2022) CONFIDENTIAL  Page 7 of 68  administered  in Part B , a regimen that was effective in animal models o f multiple sclerosis 
(MS). Patients will return to the clinic on D22, D43, and at 3, 6, and 12 months for follow -up. 
In the event that patients are unable to return to the clinic for protocol- specified visits, 
alternative methods for safety assessments and  data collection may be employed to ensure the 
safety of the patient  where appropriate.  
Doses planned for evaluation in Part B include 0.3 mg /kg (Cohort 4) and 1.0 mg /kg 
(Cohort 5). Both Part B cohorts will employ sentinel dosing to monitor for the acute and 
subacute safety of multiple doses of ANK -700. In this design, t he first 2 patients in a cohort 
(1 ANK-700 and 1 PBO) will complete all 3 doses  and then complete an additional 14 days of 
safety monitoring (through D22) before  dosing can be initiated in any  further patients.    
Cohort 5 will only commence after review of the safety, tolerability , and available PK data of 
all the SAD cohorts (Cohorts 1 to 3) and Cohort 4, recommendation by [CONTACT_4484], and approval  
by [CONTACT_1034].  
Please see Table 2 for the complete schedule of assessments for Part B.  
Number of Patients (Planned)  
It is anticipated that the study will enroll approximately 33 to 42 patients across 5 dose 
cohorts.  
Part A (SAD) will enroll approximately 9 to  18 patients across 3 dose cohorts using a 
3+3 dose escalation design without intra-patient dose escalation. In Part A, patients may be 
replaced if they do not receive the full dose of study drug or do not complete the D 15 visit, as 
long as they did not discontinue the study because of  dose- limiting toxicity ( DLT ). No patient 
with a DLT  will be replaced . 
Part B (MAD) will enroll approximately 24 patients across 2 dose cohorts. Sixteen patients 
will receive ANK -700 and 8 patients will receive PBO. In Part B, patients may be replaced if 
they do not receive all  3 doses and complete the D 22 vi sit, as long as they did not discontinue 
the study because of  a DLT. No patient with a DLT  will be replaced . 
Starting Dose and Dose Escalation 
The starting dose of ANK -700 will be 0.3 mg /kg based on findings from Good Laboratory 
Practice (GLP) toxicology studies and animal models in MS , which identified  the 
pharmacologically active doses.  
Part A will employ a 3+[ADDRESS_563375] 3 patients in the cohort experiences a DLT within 14 days of 
treatment  (D1 to D15) , the dose level may  expan d to a maximum of [ADDRESS_563376]

Study ANK-700-01 in Relapsing -Remitting Multiple Sclerosis  
Version 4 (06 June 2022) CONFIDENTIAL  Page 8 of 68  MAD cohort (Cohort 4) will be init iated after the safety review of SAD Cohort 2 (Part  A), a 
recommendation to proceed by [CONTACT_4484], and approval by [CONTACT_1034]. Cohort 5 will only 
commence after review of the safety, tolerability , and available PK data of all the SAD cohorts 
(Cohorts 1 to 3) and Cohort 4, recommendation by [CONTACT_4484], and approval  by [CONTACT_1034].  
DLTs include any Grade 2 AE not resolving within 14 days or any ≥  Grade 3 AE occurring 
during the dose- escalation safety monitoring period  (D1 to D1 5 in Part A; D1 to D22 in 
Part B).  
Any ≥ Grade 4 AE will result in notification to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 
parallel with the SMC; all study dosing and enrollment will be paused pending review by [CONTACT_1556].    
The non- tolerated dose (NTD) is the dose level at which > 1 patient experiences a DLT during 
the dose-escalation safety monitoring period (D1 to D15 in Part A; D1 to D22 in Part B). The 
maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) will be  defined as the proximal dose level  below the NTD 
administered d uring the study. Of note, dose escalation may not identify an NTD or MTD.  
Safety Monitoring Committee 
This study will utilize an independent SMC that will meet regularly during dose escalation to 
review all available data, including safety and PK. The SMC will make recommendations 
concerning dose escalation and/or any changes to the dosing paradigm based on review of the 
received data. The SMC will also make recommendations about the dose(s) selected for 
Part B. The final decisions related to dose escalation or the dosing paradigm will be made by 
[CONTACT_1034].

Version 4 (06 June 2022) CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25 of 68  1. BACKGROUND  
1.1. MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS  
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic and  often  disabling autoimmune disease of the central 
nervous system (CNS) characterized by [CONTACT_443055], sensory, cognitive, and autonomic 
function. The prevalence has increased noticeably, with a recent study determining the 
prevalence in the [LOCATION_002] to be 309 per 100,000, and more commonly occurring (2.8 times 
higher) in women than men ( Wallin 2019). The prevalence of MS varies with geography and 
ethnicity, with northern Europeans having the highest prevalence ( Leray 2016) . MS is associated 
with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DRB1*15:[ADDRESS_563390] an increased risk, both for susceptibility of inheriting t he disease and in the 
severity of their disease ( Barcellos 2003) .  
The course and disease progression vary depending on the type of MS. Relapsing forms of MS, 
including relapsing- remitting MS ( RRMS) and secondary progressive MS (SPMS), typi[INVESTIGATOR_443037], displaying early signs of inflammation and neurodegeneration, but progress to non-relapsing disability. Primary progressive MS (PPMS) lacks the initial relapsing -remitting 
course and typi[INVESTIGATOR_443038]. Clinically isolated 
syndrome (CIS) is classified as the first epi[INVESTIGATOR_443039] 1 or more neurological symptoms for 
≥ [ADDRESS_563391] relapse. 
Diagnosis of MS is typi[INVESTIGATOR_443040] a symptomatic attack using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the McDonald criteria ( Thompson 2018) . 
 
The characteristic pathology of MS includes perivenular inflammatory lesions, which produce demyelination and axonal damage ( Frohman 2006 ). The inflammation is autoimmune, involving 
T cells reactive to myelin self -antigens ( Allegretta 1990, Bronge 2019, Zhang 1994) . During the 
RRMS phase of the disease, the peripheral immune response against myelin is thought to drive 
the disease process  (Hemmer 2015) . 
1.2. ANK -[ADDRESS_563392] demonstrated efficacy in mouse models of 
MS. The mechanism by [CONTACT_443056]-700 induces immunologic tolerance is mediated by 
3 mechanisms:  
• Deletion of antigen- specific T cells  
• Induction of anergy/clonal exhaustion of antigen- specific T cells  
• Induction of regulatory T cells which control the antigen- specific T -cell response

Version 4 (06 June 2022) CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_563393] observed an exacerbation of 
disease and/or an increase in inflammatory lesions ( Bielekova 2000) . However, subsequent 
studies using different peptide sequences and technologies to induce antigen- specific T- cell 
tolerance to myelin antigens have not shown these effects ( Chataway 2018, Zubizarreta 2019) . 
Treatment for RRMS depends upon patient characteristics and comorbidities, the severity and 
activity of disease, and the safety profile of available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  (Montalban 2018) . Many current 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_443041], but without the ability to target speci fic 
antigens. Many of the approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_443042], including serious infections. There remains an unmet medical need for effective, 
targeted, well -tolerated therapi[INVESTIGATOR_443043].   
For more information on the nonclinical findings, please see the ANK -700 Investigator’s 
Brochure. 
This first -in-human (FIH) study will be conducted in patients with RRMS with the aim of 
evaluating the tolerability of single and multiple intravenous ( IV) admi nistrations of ANK-700. 
1.3. SELECTION OF PATIENT POPULATIONS  
An RRMS patient population has been selected for the FIH study of ANK-700. T cells that react 
to myelin  antigens have been observed in healthy subjects ( Hellings 2001) . Considering the 
potential risk that treatment with antigen -specific tolerizing agents in healthy subjects may 
provoke symptoms consistent with MS , an RRMS patient population is considered appropriate 
for this FIH study.  
The study population includes adults with RRMS  based on revised McDonald criteria (2017) 
with an Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) score ≤  6.5. Patients must be n eurologically 
stable with no evidence of relapse within the [ADDRESS_563394] been implemented to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ANK -700 in a 
diverse RRMS population which has an appropriate risk/benefit profile based upon the severity 
of their disease. Efficacy is not being assessed in this study and enrolled patients are not 
expected to receive direct clinical benefit  from treatment with ANK -700. The population 
selected for thi s study ( i.e., those with relatively well controlled and neurologically stable 
RRMS ) is appropriate for the FIH study, as highly active disease may obscure the assessment of 
safety and tolerability of ANK-[ADDRESS_563395] renal or hepatic impairment will be excluded. The age range will be limited to  
patients  18 to 60 years to avoid confounding by [CONTACT_443057].  Patients  will be allowed to remain on stable doses of fumarates (dimethyl fumarate or diroximel 
fumarate) during the study because fumarate drugs do not interfere with the mechanism of action 
of ANK-700. Because both dimethyl fumarate and diroximel fumarate are metabolized to the

disease modifying therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (DMT) to treat MS will be excluded.   
1.4. DETERMINATION OF DOSES AND REGIMEN  
The planned doses of ANK-[ADDRESS_563396] characterization of the safety 
and pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of ANK- 700 encompassing pharmacologically  active doses 
identified in nonclinical models of MS. The cumulative toxicology, safety pharmacology, and PK data acquired from animal studies support dosing of ANK-700 in humans. A 4 -week repeat -
dose Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicity study examining doses up to 87.5 mg /kg in naïve 
Sprague Dawley rats demonstrated no significant findings at any dose of ANK-[ADDRESS_563397] -level (NOAEL) was established as 87.5 mg /kg (the highest dose 
tested) from the GLP  study, which supports a starting dose of 0.3 mg /kg in the FIH study, a dose 
that is  more than 40-fold lower than the NOAEL.  
In nonclinical mouse models of MS , administration of surrogate mol ecules of ANK -700 were 
effective at ameliorating disease . From these nonclinical models, it was concluded: 
• Doses of surrogate mol ecules equivalent to 0.3 to 7.2 mg /kg of ANK-[ADDRESS_563398] 
demonstrated  efficacy  on disease severity in nonclinical models of MS. 
• Three doses of surrogate mol ecules administered every 3 days was significantly more 
effective in inducing tolerance and improving disease outcome compared with  3 doses 
administered weekly. 
The starting dose of 0.3 mg/kg was chosen based on the pharmacologically active dose s 
observed in nonclinical models of disease and is supported by [CONTACT_443058] . For additional 
information on the dose selection and safety margins, please see the Investigator’s Brochure.  
In Part A (single ascending dose [SAD]), 3 escalating dose groups are planned: 0.3 mg /kg 
(Cohort 1), 1.0 mg /kg (Cohort 2), and 3.0 mg /kg (Cohort 3). The dosing schedule requires that 
successively higher doses will only be administered after the safety, tolerability , and available 
PK data of the preceding dose group have been evaluated by [CONTACT_28749] 
(SMC) and dose escal ation is approved by [CONTACT_1034]. If necessary, doses may be adjusted 
based on the PK and safety findings of the preceding dose group(s) with a protocol amendment.  
For Part B (multiple ascending dose [MAD]), Cohort 4 will be initiated only after SMC review 
of the SAD Cohort 2, recommendation by [CONTACT_26570], and  approval by [CONTACT_1034]. Part B  will 
examine multiple doses (3) of ANK -700 and includes 2 escalating dose cohorts: 0.3 mg /kg 
(Cohort 4) and 1.0 mg /kg (Cohort 5). During Part B, ANK-700 will be administered every 3 days 
for a total of 3 doses. Cohort 5 will only commence after review of the safety, tolerability , and 
available PK data of all the SAD cohorts (Cohorts 1 to 3) and Cohort 4, recommendation by [CONTACT_181966], and approval  by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Based on data obtained during both the SAD and MAD parts of the study, the protocol may be amended to explore additional higher dose levels and alternative dosing schedules if supported 
by [CONTACT_26739], recommended by [CONTACT_4484], and approved by [CONTACT_1034].

Study ANK-700-01 is a Phase 1, FIH study designed to evaluate the initial safety, tolerability, 
and activity of ANK -700 in patients with RRMS . An overview of the 2 parts and proposed dose 
cohorts is presented in  Figure 1.  
4.1. PART  A – SINGLE ASCENDING DOSE 
The SAD phase will include up to 3 cohorts with  3 patients each. Patients within each dose 
cohort will receive 1 dose of ANK -700 IV and will be monitored for up to 6 months. All patients 
in Part A will be dosed ≥  14 days apart to monitor for acute and subacute reactions ; this length of 
time is supported by [CONTACT_443060]-[ADDRESS_563399] cleared > 5 half-lives  and nonclini cal animal model data demonstrating that the tolerance induction mechanism 
can develop and immunologically active peptide is cleared within 1 week  from dosing (s ee 
Section  4.7 for more info rmation ).  
Patients will arrive at the clinic on the morning of dosing (Day 1 [D1]) and will be monitored in-clinic  for [ADDRESS_563400] be performed to ensure the patient did not experience any acute safety events after discharge.  
• If patients are experiencing active AE(s) which require clinical monitoring at the end of 
the clinic/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_443044], they should not be discharged and followed up per PI [INVESTIGATOR_13699]  
• If feasible, patients should be advised to have someone stay with them after discharge 
until [ADDRESS_563401] elapsed after study drug administration on D1. 
• If patients do not live within 1-hour travel time of a n emergency  medical facility, they 
should remain in the clinic/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_443045] 24 hours after study drug 
administration . 
• Patients should be instructed not to drive themselves to seek emergency medical 
treatment at any time during the study. 
Doses evaluated in Part A include 0.3 mg /kg (Cohort 1), 1.0 mg /kg (Cohort 2), and 3.0 mg /kg 
(Cohort 3). After all patients within a given dose cohort have been followed for ≥  [ADDRESS_563402]-
dose, a safety review will be performed by [CONTACT_443061] (AEs) and 
available clinical laboratory and PK data. Initiation of the next dose level will commence upon 
recommendation by [CONTACT_443062]. 
Part A will employ a 3+[ADDRESS_563403] 3 patients dosed experience a dose- limiting toxicity  (DLT) within the 
dose-escalation safety monitoring period (D1 to D15) , then escalati on to the next dose level may 
proceed if recommended  by [CONTACT_443063] . If [ADDRESS_563404] 3 patients in 
the cohort experiences a DLT within the dose-escalation safety monitoring period (D1 to D15), 
the dose level may  expand to a maximu m of 6 patients. If no DLT occurs among the 3 additional

phone call 24 hours after dosing. Patients will return to the clinic on D4 ±1, D15, and D29±1 . 
Additionally, patients will return to the clinic after 3 and 6 months for follow-up. Blood and serum samples will be collected for PK and anti -drug antibody (ADA) assessments during Part 
A. Patients in Part A may be replaced if they do not receive the full dose of study drug or do not complete the D 15 visit, as long as the discontinuation was not due to a DLT. In the event that 
patients are unable to return to the clinic for protocol- specified visits, alternative methods for 
safety assessments and data collection may be employed to ensure the safety of the patients  
where appropriate . 
Please see Table 1 for the complete schedule of assessments for Part A.  
4.2. PART  B – MULTIPLE ASCENDING DOSE 
The first MAD cohort (Cohort 4) will be initiated after the safety review of SAD Cohort 2 
(Part  A), a recommendation to proceed by [CONTACT_4484], and approval by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Patients in the MAD part will be randomized 2:1 to either ANK -700 or PBO . Patients will be 
stratified based upon their use of fumarate at study entry within the  interactive response 
technology ( IRT) system . A total of 12 patients will be enrolled per dose cohort (ANK-700, 
n = 8; PBO, n  = 4). Patients will arrive at the clinic on the morning of dosing and will be 
monitored in- clinic  for [ADDRESS_563406] infusion for assessment of acute 
safety and PK  blood sample collection. A follow up phone call 24 hours after dosing will be 
performed to ensure the patient did not experience any acute safety events after discharge.  
• If patients are experiencing active AE(s) which require clinical monitoring at the end of the clinic/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_443046]  
• If feasible, patients should be advised to have someone sta y with them after discharge

• Patients should be instructed not to drive themselves to seek emergency medical 
treatment at any time during the study. 
A total of 3 doses (1 dose every 3 day s on D1, D4, and D7) will be administered  in Part B , a 
regimen that was effective in animal models of MS. Patients will return to the clinic on D22, 
D43±2, and at 3, 6, and 12 months for follow-up.

and Cohort [ADDRESS_563410] dose on D1 will be  
followed by a 8-hour monitoring period in the clinic /hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5120]; each additional dose will be 
followed by a 4 -hour monitoring period in the clinic /hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5120]. Blood and serum s amples will 
be collected  for PK and ADA assessments during Part B of the study. Patients in Part B may be 
replaced if they do not receive the full 3 doses of study drug or do not complete the D22 visit, as 
long as the discontinuation was not due to a DLT .  In the event that patients are unable to return

4.5. MONITORING OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
Patients will be monitored continuously for AEs while on study. AE severity will be assessed 
using the NCI -CTCAE  v5.0 or higher ( Appendix 1) .  
4.6. DOSE-LIMITING TOXICITIES  
Dose -limiting toxicities for Study ANK -700-01 include any Grade 2 AE not resolving within 
14 days or any ≥ Grade 3 AE occurring during the dose -escalation safety monitoring period (D1 
to D15 in Part A; D1 to D22 in Part B). DLTs do not include those AEs attributable solely to intercurrent illness or other concomitant medications. Any DLT experienced during the dose-
escalation safety monitoring period will result in study pause and review by [CONTACT_4484].  
Any ≥ Grade 4 AE will r esult in notification to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 
parallel with the SMC; all study dosing and enrollment will be paused pending review by [CONTACT_8415].    
4.7. DOSE ESCALATION SAFETY MONITORING PERIOD  
In Part A, the dose-escalation safety monitoring period is from the beginning of the 
IV administration of ANK -[ADDRESS_563411] 
IV administration of ANK-700/PBO  through the D22 clinic visit.  
The monitoring period is supported by [CONTACT_443067], which demonstrate:  
• ANK-700 is cleared from circulation in < 7 minutes, ensuring that > [ADDRESS_563412] 
elapsed during the safety monitoring period 
• T-cell tolerance induction can be observed as early as [ADDRESS_563413] during the 
safety monitoring period 
• Immunologically active antigen cannot be detected in animals [ADDRESS_563414] IV 
administration of ANK-700/PBO . In Part B, patients will be monitored in the clinic for [ADDRESS_563415] dose.

Version 4 (06 June 2022) CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_563416]. 
The SMC will make  recommendations  concerning dose escalation and/or any changes to the 
dosing paradigm based on review of the received data. The SMC will also make recommendations about the dose(s) selected for Part B.  The final decisions related to dose 
escalation or the dosing paradigm will be made by [CONTACT_1034]. 
4.9. INDIVIDUAL AND COHORT STOPPI[INVESTIGATOR_443047]-escalation safety monitoring period, any DLT  will result in a pause in 
enrollment and a thorough review by [CONTACT_443068]. Any ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_563417] 3 patients experiences  a DLT  within the  safety monitoring period (D1 
to D15) in a given cohort, 3 additional patients  will be enrolled and evaluated in that cohort 
before dose escalation can occur  if recommended by [CONTACT_443069] ≥  Grade 4 AE. If 2 or more patients experience a DLT  at a given dose level 
during the dose escalation evaluation period of Part A (D1 to D15) , then that dose level will be 
considered to have exceeded the non- tolerated dose (NTD),  and no further escalation will 
proceed.  
If a patient experiences a DLT  during the dose-escalation safety monitoring period of Part B, no 
additional doses will be administered to that patient. If 1 patient experiences a DLT  during the 
dose-escalation safety monitoring period of Part B, the study will be paused to determine if any 
dose adjustments are needed and/or if the study should dose any additional patients. For 
any ≥ Grade 4 AE , the study will only continue after consultation with the FDA. If 2 or more 
patients experience a DLT  during the dose-escalation safety monitoring period of Part B  (D1 to 
D22), then that dose level will be considered to have exceeded  the NTD, and no further 
escalation will proceed . 
The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be  defined as  the proximal dose level  below the dose 
exceeding the NTD administered during the study. Of note, dose escalation may not identify an 
NTD or MTD.  
4.10. TREATMENT DISCONTINUATION  
Patients will be discontinued from treatment for any of the after  reasons: 
• An AE that requires permanent discontinuation of study treatment* 
• Noncompliance with  the protocol

Complete medical history will be obtained, including demographics, previous therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and 
disease hist ory. MS  is considered part of medical history and should include: 
• duratio n since MS symptom onset  
• duration since MS diagnosis  
• number of relapses within the last year  and 3 years  
• date of last relapse  
• previous MS treatment (s) 
6.1.4.  Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
At screening, concomitant medications will be recorded. Assessment of any change in 
concomitant medications, or procedures since the last visit will occur at all further patient visits 
through the final Follow-U p Visit.  
6.1.5.  Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) Assessment  
Assessment of EDSS score  will be captured at the time points specified in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 1 and Table 2).  The EDSS is based on a standard neurological examination, 
incorporating the pyramidal, cerebellar, brainstem, sensory, bowel/bladder, visual, and cerebral [or mental]  functional systems , and ambulation, rated and scored as functional system scores. 
The EDSS is a disability scale that ranges in 0.5-point steps from 0 (normal) to 10 (death) (Kurtzke 1983 ). The EDSS must be administered by a certified examiner. All patients with new

an unscheduled visit, if appropriate (s ee Section  11.1.2).  
If the screening EDSS has been completed within [ADDRESS_563424] 28 days from the relapse resolution and then a new screening EDSS should be obtained.   
6.1.6.  Physical Examination  and Vital Signs  
A full physical examination (PE) and vital signs check will be performed at the time points specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1  and Table 2). P Es will also be conducted as 
clinically indicated.  
The PE will include an assessment of general appearance, skin, head, neck, throat, lymph nodes, 
cardiovascular, neurological, thyroid, musculoskeletal/extremities, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], abdomen, height, 
and weight (baseline only). Vital signs will include temperature , pulse rate, and  diastolic and 
systolic blood pressure (sitting for 5  minutes ). If vital signs need to be repeated during a single 
visit, assessments should be conducted approximately 5 minutes apart.  
Any new clinically significant ( CS) abnormality from baseline should be recorded as an AE. 
6.1.7.  Electrocardiogram  
At screening, a standard 12- lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be obtained and interpreted by 
[CONTACT_443072]. If the screening ECG has been completed within [ADDRESS_563425]

The following time windows apply: 
• “Screening/baseline” MRI should be performed on or after the Screening  Visit, but 
≥ 10 days before the D1  visit.  
• The MRI obtained for the Part A D15 Visit and Part B D22  Visit should be performed up 
to 3 days before or on the scheduled visit day . 
• MRI at Part B visit D90  should be performed within 2 weeks of the scheduled visit. 
MRIs will be performed for assessment of safety only and will be reviewed locally .

performed (which may include the spi[INVESTIGATOR_158407]) during an unscheduled visit, if clinically 
necessary , but before  the initiation of steroids  (see Section  11.1.2).  
Additional details on  MRI acquisition procedures are described  the imaging acquisition 
guidelines. 
6.1.9.  Clinical Laboratory Tests  
The following laboratory parameters will be measured at screening and at the time points 
specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1  and Table 2) and will be analyzed locally by a 
certified laboratory:  
• A serum pregnancy t est during screening for all women of childbearing potential 
(WCBP)  
• Serum or urine pregnancy testing for all WCBP before  each dose 
• Hematology laboratory parameters include white blood cell ( WBC ) count, hemoglobin, 
hematocrit , platelet count, and WBC differ ential  
• Blood chemistry laboratory parameters, including blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, 
glucose, AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin (total and direct), electrolytes (sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, potassium), amylase, lipase, albumin, magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus 
• Coagulation laboratory parameters, including prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time or activated partial thromboplastin time , and international normalized  ratio 
• Complete urinalysis with qualitative analysis for protein (dipstick)  
• HIV, HBV ( hepatitis B surface antigen , hepatitis B core antibody, and hepatitis B surface 
antibody), and HCV testing (screening only) 
Unscheduled assessments should be performed as clinically indicated. 
For any out- of-range laboratory findings during screening, repeat laboratory testing may be 
performed at the discretion of the Investigator. Abnormal laboratory findings at screening should 
be recorded as medical history only if considered CS.   
Clinical laboratory assessments should be performed before ANK -700/PBO  infusion when 
applicable.

If an IRR occurs during ANK-700 administration, the following treatment recommendations are 
provided and may be modified per  local treatment standards and guidelines as appropriate. 
• Grade 1 (mild): Infusion rate modification not indicated. Administer symptomatic 
treatment ( e.g., antihis tamines, antipyretics, antiemetics) as needed. Closely monitor 
patient until resolution. Prophylaxis with diphenhydramine 50 mg  (or equivalent) and/or 
acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg  is recommended ≥  30 minutes  prior to  future 
ANK-700 infusions. 
• Grade 2 (moderate): Slow infusion to ≤  50% of the original infusion rate and treat 
symptoms with appropriate medical therapy, including but not limited to antihistamines, antipyretics, and analgesics. Increase monitoring of vital signs as medically indicated until patient is deemed stable. Prophylaxis with diphenhydramine 50 mg  (or equivalent) 
and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg  is recommended ≥  30 minutes  prior 
to future ANK -700 infusions.  
• Grade 3 (severe): Stop infusion and institute appropriate symptom- directed therapy, 
including but not limited to antihistamines, antipyretics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, and oxygen. Increase monitoring of vital signs as medically indicated until patient is deemed stable. If the reaction has not resolved within [ADDRESS_563439] 
be monitored until resolution of symptom s or for 2  hours in the absence of additional 
symptoms. Prophylaxis with diphenhydramine 50 mg  (or equivalent) and/or 
acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 1000 mg  is required ≥  30 minutes  before  future 
ANK-700 infusions. The next infusion should initiate at a rate of 2 hours per dose, or 50% of the rate at which the reaction occurred. If no IRRs are observed within the first 30 min utes, the infusion rate may increase to the 1-hour-per-dose rate as outlined in 
Section  10.2. Permanently discontinue ANK-700 upon a second occurrence of a Grade 3 
or greater infusion reaction.  
• Grade 4 (life -threatening): Stop infusion and immedi ately institute appropriate symptom 
directed therapy and supportive measures as necessary, including, but not limited to, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, oxygen/respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413], and vasopressors. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5478]/or intensive care unit admission may be indicated. Permanently discontinue treatment.  
10.6. DRUG  ACCOUNTABILITY  
The Investigator or designee is responsible for taking an inventory of each shipment of ANK-[ADDRESS_563440] or damaged.

a patient discontinues from the study, the pati ent identifier will not be reused,  and the patient will 
not be allowed to reenter  the study.  
In Part A, patients will be assigned to receive open- label ANK -700 at a dose level based on the 
next available spot in the cohort(s) currently being enrolled. Patients in Part A may be replaced if 
they do not receive the full dose of study drug or do not complete the D15 visit, as long as the 
discontinuation was not due to a DLT  
In Part B, patients will be stratified based upon their use of fumarate at study entry within the IRT system . For the sentinel group, the first 2 eligible patients within each cohort will be 
randomized  through IRT in a 1:1 ratio to receive either ANK-700 or PBO. After completion of 
the sentinel dosing in each cohort, the remaining 10 patients will be randomized to ensure an 
overall 2:1 randomization to ANK-700 and PBO.  Patients in Part B may be replaced if they do 
not receive the full 3 doses of study drug or do not complete the D22 visit, as long as the 
discontinuation was not due to a DLT.

study participation, whether or not consider related to study treatment.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
AEs include worsening of a pre- existing medical condition , including MS, as well as CS  changes 
from baseline laboratory values/conditions. Worsening of the preexisting medical condition (e.g., 
diabetes, hypertension) means that it has increased in severity, frequency, and/or duration, and/or 
has an association with a significantly worse outcome. A pre-existing condition that has not 
worsened during the study is not considered an AE. 
11.1.2.  Protocol -Defined  MS Relapse  
Patients who present with suspected clinical relapse should be assessed by [CONTACT_443076]/or MRI 
(with and without contrast and may in clude spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]), as appropriate. Protocol-defined MS 
relapse for this study is : 
• Sudden epi[INVESTIGATOR_443050] 
≥ 24 hours and occur s ≥ 30 days after conclusion of  previous relapse (patient must be 
stable or improving for the 30 days immediately preceding relapse) and for which there is no other cause such as infection or environmental triggers. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_25672], sexual dysfunction, fatigue, mood change, or bladder or bowel urgency or incontinence will not suffice to establish the diagnosis of a relapse. 
11.1.3.  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• results in death  
• is immediately life -threatening  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] o r prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
− Elective or pre-planned treatment for a pre-existing condition that is unrelated to 
the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the ICF 
(documented as medical history on the eCRF) is not consider ed an SAE . 
− Scheduled therapy for the target disease of the study, including admissions for transfusion support or convenience, is not considered an SAE. 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
ANK-700 Anokion US, Inc.  
Study ANK-700-01 in Relapsing -Remitting Multiple Sclerosis  
Version 4 (06 June 2022) CONFIDENTIAL  Page 53 of 68  • results in congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• is considered an important medical event 
− If an AE does not meet 1 of the serious criteria, but the Investigator or Sponsor 
considers an event to be clinically important, the event could be classified as an SAE under the criterion of an  “Important M edical Event .” Examples of such 
medical events may include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, or blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
11.2. PROCEDURES FOR RECORDING AND REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS  
11.2.1.  Recording Adverse Events  
Patients will be instructed to report all AEs and will be asked a general health status question at 
each study visit. All AEs and SAEs occurring in patients will be recorded in the eCRF from the 
time of signing the ICF through the Final Study Visit/phone call . An AE will be followed until it 
is resolved, has returned to baseline, or is determined to be a stable or chronic condition.  
At each protocol -required visit (including safety follow-up phone call) during the study, all AEs 
that have occurred since the previous visit must be reviewed by [CONTACT_737]. The Investigator 
must determine if the AE is serious or nonserious.  
The Investigator must assign the following AE attributes: 
• AE diagnosis or syndrome(s) if known 
− If not known at time of the report, record the signs and/or symptoms as AEs and 
provide an updated report with diagnosis when obtained 
• dates of onset and resolution 
• severity as defined per protocol 
• assessment of relatedness to ANK-700/PBO  
• action taken with each ANK-700/PBO  dose because of the AE  
In general, an AE that is the primary cause of subsequent events should be identified by [CONTACT_443077] ( e.g., for dehydration because of  diarrhea , the AE would be diarrhea ). However, 
AEs occurring secondary to an initiating event that are separated in time should be recorded as independent events (e.g., for sepsis secondary to pneumonia, both events should be re corded).  
Confirmed and suspected SARS-CoV-2 infections and /or COVID -[ADDRESS_563443] assess whether the AE may be related to ANK-700 (study drug) or any protocol mandated procedure, when applicable. The relationship is defined below:   
Relationship assessments that indicate the event is “Not Drug Related”:

Study ANK-700-01 in Relapsing -Remitting Multiple Sclerosis  
Version 4 (06 June 2022) CONFIDENTIAL  Page 54 of 68  • None: The event is related to an etiology other than the study product administration (the 
alternative etiology must be documented in the study patient’s medical record).  
• Remote: The event is unlikely to be related to the study product and likely to be related to factors other than study product. 
Relationship assessments that indicate the event is “Drug Related”:  
• Possible: There is an  association between the event and the administration of ANK-700, 
and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the study product; but there may also be alternative etiology, such as characteristics of the patient’s clinical status or underlying disease. 
• Probable: There is an association between the event and the administration of ANK-700, there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to ANK-700, and the event could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_8129]’s clinical status or an alternative etiology is not apparent. 
• Definite: There is an association between the event and the administration of ANK-700, there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the ANK-700, and causes 
other than A NK-[ADDRESS_563444] been ruled out and/or the event re- appeared on re-exposure to 
ANK-700. 
11.2.3.  Adverse Event Severity  
The Investigator will assess the Grade of the AE per the NCI -CTCAE v5.0 or higher 
(Appendix 1). Toxicities that are not specified in  the NCI -CTCAE will be defined as follows:  
• Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated 
• Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)  
• Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_443051]; disabling; limiting self -care 
ADL  
• Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated 
• Grade 5: Death related to AE  
Note: It is important to distinguish between SAEs and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of 
intensity, whereas seriousness is classified by [CONTACT_431105]  11.1.3. 
11.2.4.  Abnormal Laboratory Values  
The Investigator is responsible for reviewing clinical laboratory tests determining whether an abnormal value represents a CS  change from the patient’s baseline value. In general, abnormal 
laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the Investigator’s judgment) should

Study ANK-700-01 in Relapsing -Remitting Multiple Sclerosis  
Version 4 (06 June 2022) CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_563445] result should be reported as an 
AE if the laboratory result:  
• requires an adjustment or discontinuation of ank-700 
• req
uires treatment with or adjustment to concomitant medications  
• is considered to be an AE by [CONTACT_737] 
11.2.5.  Medication Errors, Misuse, and Abuse of ANK -700 
Overdose, medication error, off- label use, misuse, abuse , and occupational exposure are defined 
as follows: 
• Overdose: refers to the administration of a quantity of A NK-700 given per administration 
or cumulative that is above the maximum dose according to the protocol  
• Medication error: refers to an unintentional error in dispensing or administration of 
ANK-700 not in accordance with the protocol 
• Off-label use: relates  to situations where ANK -700 is intentionally used for medical 
purpose not in accordance with the protocol 
• Misuse: refers to situations where ANK-700 is intentionally and inappropriately not used in accordance with the protocol 
• Abuse: corresponds to the persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of ANK-700, which is accompanied by [CONTACT_3584] 
• Occupational exposure: refers to exposure to ANK-700 because of one ’s professional or 
nonprofessional occupation 
Overdoses, medication errors, abuse, or misuse will be collected as part of investigational 
medicinal product dosing information and/or as a protocol violation, as required.  
11.2.6.  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
SAEs will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF  and reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
the Investigator’s first knowledge of the event, even if the experience does not appear to be 
related to ANK-700, from the time of signing ICF through the final Follow- Up Visit /phone call.  
The initial SAE eCRF must be as complete as possible and  include details of the current illness 
and SAE as well as an assessment of the relationship between the event and ANK-700. 
Additional information relating to a previously reported SAE must also be reported within 
24 hours of the Investigator’s first knowledge of information. The Investigator may also be 
asked, by [CONTACT_16015], to provide clarifications or additional information. 
If the Investigator becomes aware of an SAE considered related to ANK -[ADDRESS_563446] be reported as described above.

The Sponsor or designee will determine expectedness of the Sponsor’s product for each reported 
SAE based on the appropriate reference safety information per local  country requirements. The 
Sponsor or designee shall notify regulatory authorities of serious, unexpected, and related AEs or other AEs, per local requirements.  
The Sponsor or designee shall notify the Investigator of serious, related, and unexpected AE(s) 
submitted to the regulatory agencies, per local country requirements.  
The Investigator will notify the appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Local Ethics 
Committees (LECs)  of serious, related, and unexpected AE(s), or significant risks to patients, per 
local country requirements. The Investigator must keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_276327], 
including correspondence with the Sponsor or IRBs/LECs. 
11.2.8.  Pregnancy and In Utero Drug Exposure  
ANK-700 has not been evaluated in pregnant or nursing women. Thus, pregnant women or WCBP who are not using effective contraception are excluded from this study (see Section  8 and 
Section  6.1.9 for instructions on birth control and pregnancy testing, r espectively ). 
Pregnancies occurring in patients or partners of male  patients are considered immediately 
reportable events if the pregnancy occurs during the study treatment through the Safety Follow- Up Visit (D15 in Part A; D22 in Part B) after the patient’s last dose of ANK-700. If a 
pregnancy occurs in a patient, ANK-[ADDRESS_563448] be discontinued immediately. The pregnant woman should be referred to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity 
for further evaluation and counseling. 
The pregnancy must be reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of the Investigator’s 
knowledge of the pregnancy by [CONTACT_443078] e CRF.  
The Investigator will follow the pregnancy (the pat ient or the patient’s partner) until completion 
of the pregnancy and must notify the Sponsor of the pregnancy outcome within 24 hours of the 
Investigator’s knowledge of the outcome. The Investigator will provide this information by 
[CONTACT_443079]. This notification includes pregnancies resulting in live, 
“normal” births. 
If the pregnant patient/patient’s pregnant partner experiences an SAE during pregnancy, or the 
outcome of the pregnancy meets any of the serious criteria ( i.e., spontaneous abortion [any 
congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs ( i.e., 
report the event to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event).

Version 4 (06 June 2022) CONFIDENTIAL  Page 58 of 68  12. STATISTICAL  METHODS 
Details of the statistical methods for this study will be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP). When there is a difference between the final approved SAP and the protocol, the methods 
described in the final SAP will prevail.  
Statistical methods will be primarily descriptive in nature. No hypothesis will be formally tested.  Placebo from each cohort will be pooled for analysis. Part A and Part B  will be pooled together 
for the first dose  to provide additional tables and listing s for all of the patients in the study. 
Summary  statistics will be pr ovided for Part A , Part B , and  Part A and Part B combined for 
disposition, demographic, and PK analysis. Additional tables will be provided for Part B with  
details included in the SAP. Continuous data will be summari zed in terms of the total number of 
subjects , mean, StD, median, minimum, maximum , and number of observations, unless 
otherwise stated. For log transformed data, the geometric mean will be provided along with the 
other summary statistics.  Categorical data will be presented by [CONTACT_443080] s. 
Protocol deviations (missing assessments/visits) related to COVID -19 will be listed separately.  
12.1. SAMPLE SIZE  
In Part A, the number of patients enrolled into a treatment  group will be  based on safety and 
tolerability within a traditional 3+3 design. Unde r this model, Part A may enroll approximately 
9 patients across 3 treatment groups, depending upon the toxicities observed. No formal hypothesis testing is planned for Part A.  
In Part B, the total sample size of 24 patients (n=1 6 ANK-700; n=8 PBO) across 2 t reatment 
groups was chosen to allow for a comparison of safety, PK, and PD between ANK-700 and 
PBO.  
12.2. ANALYSIS SETS 
The main analysis sets are defined in this section.  
• The All -Treated Analysis Set  is defined as all patients who receive any amount of 
ANK-700. This analysis set will be the primary analysis set for all safety endpoints.  
• The PK Analysis Set  will include all enrolled patients who receive ≥  [ADDRESS_563449] ≥  [ADDRESS_563450]-dose measurement. This analysis set will be 
used for the analysis of PK parameters as further defined in the protocol.  
Additional analysis sets may be defined in the SAP. 
12.3. BACKGROUND CHARACTERISTICS  
12.3.1.  Patient Disposition  
The number and percentage of patients in each disposition category (e.g., enrolled, included in each analysis set , discontinuing treatment, and discontinuing study, with a breakdown of the 
reasons for discontinuation) will be summarized.

Version 4 (06 June 2022) CONFIDENTIAL  Page 59 of 68  12.3.2.  Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
The following demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570] 
(PBO  and dose group) for the All -Treated Analysis Set: sex, race, age,  concomitant fumarate 
use, and years since MS diagnosis for Part A and Part B. Part A and Part B will be combined. 
Additional parameters may be provided in the SAP.  
12.4. ANK -700  EXPOSURE   
Exposure will be calculated for study Part A and P art B by [CONTACT_443081]; all exposure data will be 
listed for both parts. The exposure variables include: 
• the cumulative number of days of exposure 
• the number of IV infusions completed  
• the relative dose intensity  
All variables are predefined:  
• The relative dose intensity is defined as the percentage of the planned treatments 
completed. It is the ratio of th e cumulative actual dose (mg) and cumulative planned dose 
(mg), multiplied by  100. In this definition, 
− the cumulative actual dose (mg) is the sum of the actual doses (mg) that the 
patient receives during the study  
− the cumulative planned dose (mg) is the cumulative number of days of exposure 
multiplied by [CONTACT_443082] (mg)  
12.5. SAFETY ANALYSES  
For Part A, all safety data will be listed. For  Part B, t he number and percentage of AEs and 
TEAEs  experienced by [CONTACT_443083], 
accompanied by a by- patient listing of potential DLTs  for both Part  A and Part B.  
The listing will include the description, severity, and relationship of the events to ANK-700 for 
each Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) system organ class and 
preferred  term and include details for relation to study drug, discontinuation because of  study 
drug, and severity.  
For Part A and Part B, safety data, including vital signs, ECGs, laboratory test results, PEs, 
disease relapses per MRI  and EDSS  evaluations, and AEs will be listed by [CONTACT_443084], as appropriate. 
12.6. ADVERSE EVENTS  
AEs will be coded using the MedDRA v22.0 (MedDRA March 2019) or higher and will be 
graded according to the NCI-CTCAE v5.0 or higher ( Appendix 1).  
A TEAE is an AE that emerges or worsens in the period from the first dose of study treatment to the final Follow -Up Visit /phone call after the last dose of ANK -700 or PBO .

Presentation  of laboratory values will be performed using International System units. All 
statistical summaries for laboratory values , including change from baseline, will be by 
[CONTACT_2715]/treatment group for P art B. Part A will be listed . 
Abnormal laboratory findings will be also listed by [CONTACT_443085]  ≥ Grade 3 in severity.  
A listing of individual patient hematology (including coagulation) and serum chemistry  values 
outside the clinical reference ranges will be provided.  
12.8. PHARMACOKINETIC ANALYSES  
Blood samples will be collected for measurement of ANK-700, as specified in Table 1 and Table 2. The timing of sampling may be altered based on the emerging PK data. The adjustment 
of the PK sampling schedule is not considered to be a substantial amendment so long as the total 
number of plasma PK samples and the total blood volume to be collected from each participant  
will not change. Any adjusted sampling time points will be documented appropriately. 
PK parameters of ANK -700 will be determined from the serum concentration- time data. 
Parameters will be calculated by [CONTACT_443086], using actual sampling 
times where relevant. The parameters that will be calculated are defined in Table 3 and will be 
calculated for single or multiple dosing of ANK-700, as appropriate. Not all listed parameters may be calculable, and additional parameters may be calculated, if needed, to fully characterize 
the available data. PK parameters and concentration data will be summarized for Part A and Part 
B and  will be combined for doses with more than 2 patients in each dose group.

EVENTS  V5.0 (CTCAE)  
CTCAE Terms   
An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure that 
may or may not be considered related to the medical treatment or procedure. An AE is a term 
that is a unique representation of a specific event used for medical documentation and scientific 
analyses. Each CTCAE v5.[ADDRESS_563457] Level Term. 
Definitions  
A brief definition is provided to clarify the meaning of each AE term.  
Grades  
Grade refers to the severit y of the AE. The CTCAE displays Grades 1 through Grade 5 with 
unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline:  
• Grade 1 : Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  
• Grade 2 : Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental ADL*  
• Grade 3 : Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting selfcare 
ADL**  
• Grade 4 : Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
• Grade 5 : Death related to AE  
A Semi -colon indicates ‘or’ within the description of the grade.  
A single dash (- ) indicates a grade is not available.  
Not all Grades are appropriate for all AEs. Therefore, some AEs are listed with fewer than 5 
options for Grade selection. Grade 5 (Death) is not appropriate for some AEs and therefore is not 
an option.  
Activities of Daily Living (ADL)  
*Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the 
telephone, managing money, etc.   
**Selfcare ADL refer to bathing, dressing, and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden.

Clinical Protocol VAC52150EBL3004 Amendment 3
CONFIDENTIAL –FOIA Exemptions Apply in U.S. 5
Approved , Date: [ADDRESS_756212] recent amendment.
Amendment 3 (This document)
The overall reason for the amendment: This amendm ent responds to the impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 
(COVID -19)on the ability of participants to return within window  (±3days) for Dose 2 in this lot -to-lot consistency 
study and proposes to widen the window , while maintaining the ability to achieve the primary and secondary 
objectives of the study.
Applicable Section(s) Description of Change(s)
Rationale: Shortly after Dose 1 (Ad26.ZEBOV) w as administered to the participants, ‘stay -at-home’ orders were 
imposed in the cities where the clinical sites are located. Although the sites were able to remain open with 
appropriate safety measures, a significant number of participan ts did not return within window  for Dose 2 
(MVA -BN-Filo) vaccination. The failure -to-return rate was approximately 22% which would likely lead to 
underpow ering for the prim ary objective. Protocol amendment 2 allows for replacement of subjects in the 
immuno genicity subset if the dropout rate exceeded 5% due to COVID -19 but did not widen the acceptable time 
frame to receive Dose 2 and still be able to contribute to the per protocol analysis. Analysis of the variability data 
of the ELISA assay remains stable when the interval between the 2vaccines is widened from Day 56 out to Day85 
(data from studies VAC52150 EBL2001 and VAC52150 EBL2002) and even remains stable when the interval is 
≥56 (data from the immunogenicity analysis set from study VAC52150 EBL2002). Itis noted that while the 
variability around the ELISA values remains stable, the GMCs increase modestly as the interval of time betw een 
doses increases. Because the assignment of the addit ional participants to the groups will be blinded and random, 
there should be no impact on our ability to demonstrate comparability between the groups. Given that the variability 
around the measurement remains stable, assignment to the groups will be random and in the absence of any safety 
concerns, this amendment will widen the acceptable time frame around Dose 2 to minimize the number of 
exclusions from the per protocol analysis and w ill apply to participants already vaccinated in the study .
Protocol amend ment 2 provided for the recruitment of 2 additional Groups (5 and 6) who will receive a booster 
dose. These participants have not yet been recruited. It is expected that these additional groups will likely receive 
their second dose in the fall of 2020, at which time it is possible that a second wave of COVID -[ADDRESS_756213] reached a plateau at the time the booster dose is given and the 
immune system may be differently susceptible to the booste r.

Approved , Date: 15 June 2020Amendment 2 (2 April 2020 )
The overall reason for the amendment: This amendment is w ritten to accommodate a request from EMA to 
obtain safety and immunogenicity data of a booster dose of Ad26.ZEBOV given 4 months after the primary 
vaccin e regimen .
Applicable Section(s) Description of Change(s)
Rationale: Administration of a booster dose of Ad26.ZEBOV given at 1-and [ADDRESS_756214] anamnestic 
response to the booster vaccine . Administration of a booster dose in anticipation of imminent exposure to Ebola 
(ie,prior to deployment to an Ebola outbreak area) may be desired as a precautionary measure to optimize 
protection. How ever, there arecurrently no clinical data available on the immunogenicity and safety of such an 
Ad26.ZEBOV booster dose when adm inistered less than 1 year after the prim ary vaccin e regimen . Booster doses 
as early as 2 -3 months after Dose 2 were assessed in a multivalent filovirus and an HIV vaccine program and were 
able to induce a marked increa se in antibody concentrations, although to a lower magnitude than a later booster. 
Furthermore, based on the kinetics of decrease in antibody concentrations after the Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA -BN-Filo 
vaccine regimen, supported by a mechanistic model of antibody persistence and general vaccine knowledge, an 
Ad26.ZEBOV booster dose administered from 4 months after completion of the primary vaccine regimen is likely 
to induce a strong anamnestic response based on mature immune memory and to maximize the likelihood of 
protection in case of imminent risk of exposure to Ebola. Therefore, a separate Booster Cohort of participants will 
receive the prim ary vaccine regimen follow ed bya booster dose of Ad26.ZEBOV 4months after D ose2. The 
participants in this Booster Cohort w ill be assessed for safety and immunogenicity.

A Phase 3, Randomized, Double- blind, Placebo -controlled Study to Evaluate the Immunogenicity, Safety, 
Reactogenicity, and Consistency of a Heterologous 2 -dose Vaccine Regimen Using 3 Consecutive Lots of 
Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA -BN®- Filo in Adult Participants.
Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V. (hereafter referred to as the sponsor), in collaboration with Bavarian 
Nordic GmbH (BN) is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a prophylactic Ebola vaccine regimen (VAC52150) comprised of the 
following 2 candidate Ebola vaccines:
Ad26.ZEBOV is amonovalent vaccine expressing the full-length glycoprotein (GP) of theEbola virus 
(EBOV, formerly known as Zaire ebolavirus )Mayinga variant . The vaccine is produced in the human cell 
line PER.C6®.
MVA -mBN226B , further referred to as Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) -BN®-Filo, is a multivalen t 
vaccine expressing the EBOV Mayinga GP, the Sudan virus (SUDV) GP, the Marburg virus (MARV) 
Musoke GP, and the Tai Forest virus (TAFV, formerly known as Côte d’Ivoire ebolavirus ) nucleoprotein 
(NP). The EBOV GP expressed by [CONTACT_243680] -BN-Filo has 100% homology with the one expressed by 
[CONTACT_300092]26.ZEBOV .

Hypotheses
The primary hypotheses are:
Null hypothes is: 
Three consecutive lots of Ad26.ZEBOV (Lots A, B ,and C) as Dose1paired sequentially in 3 groups with
3consecutive lots of MVA -BN-Filo (Lots 1, 2,and 3) as Dose 2 do not induce equivalent geometric mean 
concentrations (GMC s)of the EBOV GP-specific antibody response 21days post Dose 2, for at least one 
pairwise comparison.
Alternative hypothes is: 
Three consecutive lots of Ad26.ZEBOV (Lots A, B ,and C) as Dose 1 paired sequentially in 3 groups with
3consecutive lots of MVA -BN-Filo (Lots 1, 2, and 3)as Dose 2induce equivalent GMC sof the EBOV 
GP-specific antibody response 21days post Dose 2, for all 3pairwise comparisons (ie,Groups 1 versus 
[vs] 2, 1 vs 3 and2 vs 3 ).
Equivalence of any 2groups (Ad26.ZEBOV as Dose 1 followed by [CONTACT_243680] -BN-Filo as Dose 2) will be 
shown if the 95% confidence interval [CI] of the estimated GMC ratio lies entirely within 0.5 and 2.0. 
These equivalence limits were chosen primarily based on the population variab ility as measured by [CONTACT_576658]. Immunogenic equivalence of the 3 different lots of Ad26.ZEBOV (Lots A, B ,and C) paired 
sequentially in 3groups with 3different lots of MVA -BN-Filo (Lots 1, 2,and 3) is established if 
equivalence is shown for all [ADDRESS_756221] of 3 consecutive ly manufactured lots of Ad26.ZEBOV at a nominal dose of 5x1010viral 
particles (vp)as Dose 1and 3consecutive ly manufacture dlots of MVA -BN-Filo at a nominal dose of 1x108
infectious units (InfU)as Dose 2at a 56-day interval in adult participants (Groups 1-4). Once 
randomization of this part of the study is finished, a n additional Booster Cohort of 60participants will be 
enrolled in a 5:1 active:placebo ratio. These participants will be given the 2-dose heterologous vaccine 
regimen Ad26.ZEBOV followed by [CONTACT_243680] -BN-Filo 56 days later, and a booster dose of Ad26.ZEBOV
4months after D ose 2 , or placebo (Groups 5-6).

MVA -BN-Filo drug product lotsthat will be used have been m anufactured at the final manufacturing site 
(IDT)and are representative of the final manufacturing process and scale (Lots 1, 2, and 3). Lots A, B,and 
C and Lots 1, 2,and 3 are paired sequentially in 3groups (ie, A:1 [Group 1], B:2 [Group 2], and C:3 
[group 3]). Group 4will receive 2placebo vaccinations.
In the main part of the study (Groups 1-4), a planned total number of at least 741participants will be 
enrolled. All participants in this part of the study  will be assessed for safety and reactogenicity ; 
456participants (144 in each of Groups 1 to 3 and 24 in Group 4) will also be assessed for immunogenicity 
(immunogenicity subset). Participant s will be randomly assigned to one of 4 groups in a 6:6:6:1 ratio, ie, to 
oneof the 3groups receiving Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA -BN-Filo (Groups 1 to 3) with a total of at least 
234participants per group, or to a placebo group (Group 4) with 39participants , and the first 
456participants belo nging to the immunogenicity subset .
Due to the recent (on 11 March 2020) WHO declared COVID -19 pandemic, a potential higher dropout rate 
(ie,higher than 5%) may occur. In addition, some participants in the immunogenicity subset may be 
excluded from primary immunogenic ityequivalence testing because of:
 Participant not receiving Dose 2; OR
 Participant receiving Dose 2 outside the protocol defined window; OR

To mitigate these issues, additional participants may be recruited in the immunogenicity subset.
Shortly after participants received Dose 1 vaccination, ‘stay -at-home’ orders were imposed in the areas 
where the sites were located. Although the sites had implemented appropriate safety measures to prevent 
spread of severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (SARS- CoV -2), approximately 22% of 
participants did not return to the site within the protocol defined windows (±3days) for Dose [ADDRESS_756225] been lifted and 
participants are now able to return to the sites for follow -up. In order to reduce the number of additional 
participants needed for the primary and secondary immunogenicity analyses , it is possible to widen the 
acceptable window around Dose 2 administration without jeopardizing the primary and secondary 
objectives of the study. The protocol has been amended to widen the upper limit of the window around 
Day 57 (D ose 2) to Day 85 (ie, Day 57+28 days) . Therefore , the number of additional partici pants necessary 
for inclusion in the immunogenicity subset and who would receive their second vaccination within the 
Day 57 window will be reduced .
For the B ooster Cohort (Group s 5-6), a planned total of 60 participants will be enrolled .All participants in 
this cohort will be assessed for safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity. Participants will be randomly 
assigned to the 2 groups in a 5:1 ratio, ie, to a group of approximately 50 participants receiv ingthe primary 
vaccine regimen (Ad26.ZEBOV followe d by [CONTACT_243680] -BN-Filo 56 days later) followed by a booster dose of 
Ad26.ZEBOV 4 months after Dose 2(Group 5), or, to a placebo group of approximately 10 participants
(Group 6) .
These 2 additional Groups (5 and 6) have not yet been recruited. It is expected t hat these additional groups 
will likely receive their second dose in the fall of 2020, at which time it is possible that a second wave of

IMMUNOGENICITY EVALUATIONS
Blood samples for humoral immunogenicity assessments will be collected from participants in the 
immunogeni city subset and Groups 5-6at the time points indicated in the TIME AND EVENTS 
SCHEDULE .
SAFETY EVALUATIONS
All safety evaluations will be performed as specified in the TIME AND EVENTS SCHEDULE .
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_576662] (reactogenicity), 
unsolicited adverse events, and serious adverse events. After each vaccination, participants will remain 
under observation at the study site for at least 30 minutes for presence of any acute reactions and solicited 
local and systemic events , or longer if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_093] . Solicited and unsolicited
adverse events emerging during the observation period will be recorded in the electronic case report f orm 
(eCRF ). 
Upon discharge from the study site, participants will receive a thermometer (to measure body temperature), 
a ruler (to measure local injection site reactions), and a participant diary to record body temperature and 
symptoms of solicited local (at inject ion site) and systemic adverse events and will be trained on how to 
collect this information. The participants will record symptoms of solicited local and systemic adverse 
events in the diary in the evening after each vaccination and then daily for the next 7 days. The diary cards 
will be reviewed by [CONTACT_576659] 57 visit (before Dose 2vaccination) ,at the Day 78 visit, 
andat the Day 184visit ( [ADDRESS_756233] booster dose visit,for Groups 5 -6only).
All adverse events and special reporting situations, whether serious or nons erious, that are related to 
study -related procedures or to non-investigational (concomitant) sponsor products , and pregnancy (if 
applicable), will be reported from the time a signed and dated ICF is obtained onwards.
Other serious adverse events and specia l reporting situations will be reported from first dose of study 
vaccine until the end of the study.
Other nonserious adverse events and special reporting situations will be reported from first dose of study 
vaccine until [ADDRESS_756234] dose of study vaccine, and from the second dose of study vaccine until 
28days thereafter. Participants will be asked about the occurrence of unsolicited adverse events at the

Unsolicited adverse events with the onset date outside the time frame defined above (>28 days after 
previous study vaccination), which are ongoing on the day of the subsequent vaccination, should be 
recorded on the eCRF Adverse Even t page.
Clinically relevant medical events occurring between signing of ICF and first vaccination will be collected 
on the eCRF Medical History page as pre- existing conditions.
The sponsor will evaluate any safety information that is spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_576663].
Other safety assessments include vital signs (blood pressure, pulse/heart rate, and body temperature), 
physical examination and pregnancy testing.
The investigators , together with the sponsor’s medical monitor, will be responsible for the safety monitoring 
of the study. If at least one pre-specified pausing rule is met, administration of study vaccine will be paused .
STATISTICAL METHODS
For the main part of the study (Groups 1-4), the primary safety and immunogenicity analyses will be 
conducted when all participants in Groups 1-4have completed the 28-day post Dose 2time point or 
discontinued earlier , and the database has been locked. Only s ponsor personnel not involved in the review 
and determination of causality of serious adverse events reported during the study will be unblinded to 
Groups 1-4at this time point. Investigator s, study site personnel (except for those with primary 
responsibility for study vaccine preparation and dispensing) , and participants will remain blinded to the 
study vaccine allocation until the last participant in Groups 1-4completes the 6-month post Dose 2time
point (ie, Day 237, last study related visit )or discontinues earlier (and the database is locked). An interim 
analysis will be performed when all participants in Groups 1-[ADDRESS_756235] study -related visit (or discontinue earlier) , and the database has been locked.
For the Booster Cohort (Groups 5 -6), an interim analysis will be performed when all participants in Groups 
5-6have completed the 28-day post booster dosetime point (or discontinue dearlier) .This analysis , based 
on the corresponding locked database, will include all available data (including safety and 21-day post 
booster dose immunogenicity data) up to the cut off.Only sponsor personnel not involved in the review 
and determination of causality of serious adverse events reported during the study will be unblinded to 
Groups 5-6 at this time point. Investigators, study site personnel (except for those with primary 
responsibility for study vaccine preparation and dispensing), and participants will remain blinded to the 
study vaccine allocation until the database is locked for the final analysis .
The final analysis will be conducted when all participants in the study have completed the last study -related 
visit or ha vediscontinued earlier .
A planned analysis may be combined with the subsequent analysis, if deemed necessary (eg, when the dates 
of 2 planned database locks are very close).
Descriptive statistics (including geometric means with their corresponding 95% CIs, median, interquartile 
range, minimum, maximum, as applicable) will be calculated for continuous immunologic parameters at 
each time point. Graphical representations of immunologic parameters will be prepared, as applicable. 
Frequency tabulations will be calculated for discrete (qualitative) immunologic parameters at each time 
point.
To assess the primary objective, each pairwise compar ison (ie, Groups 1 vs 2, 1 vs 3, 2 vs 3) ofthe 
anti-EBOV GP binding antibody responses 21days post Dose 2vaccination with MVA -BN-Filo will be 
based on ratios of the GMC swith corresponding 95% CI. Equivalence of any 2 groups will be shown if the

equivalence is shown for all 3 pairwise comparisons. 
As a sensitivity analyses, both the primary and secondary hypotheses of equivalence will also be tested 
based on data of participants who received the second vaccination within the original window (±3 days)
around the Day [ADDRESS_756237] 1dose of

Approved , Date: 15 June [ZIP_CODE]. INTRODUCTION
Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V. (hereafter referred to as the sponsor), in collaboration with 
Bavarian Nordic GmbH (BN) , is investigating the potential of a prophylactic Ebola vaccine 
regimen (VAC52150) comprised of the following 2 candidate Ebola vaccines:
Ad26.ZEBOV is amonovalent vaccine expressing the full-length glycoprotein (GP) of the Ebola
virus (EBOV , formerl y known as Zaire ebolavirus ) Mayinga variant . The vaccine is produced in 
the human cell line PER.C6®.
MVA -mBN226B , further referred to as Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) -BN®-Filo, is a 
multivalent vaccine expressing the EBOV Mayinga GP, the Sudan v irus (SUDV) Gulu GP, the 
Marburg virus (MARV) Musoke GP, and the Tai Forest virus (TAFV, formerly  known as Côte 
d’Ivoire ebolavirus) nucleoprotein (NP) . The EBOV GP expressed by [CONTACT_243680]-BN-Filo has 
100% homology  with the one expressed by  [CONTACT_300092]26.ZEBOV .
For the most comprehensive nonclinical and clinical information regarding Ad26.ZEBOV and 
MVA -BN-Filo, refer to the latest versions of the Investigator’s Brochures (IB) and Addenda .3,4A 
brief summary  of the clinical information available at the time of the protocol writing is provided 
below.
The term “study  vaccine ” throughout the protocol, refers to study vaccine (Ad26.ZEBOV , 
MVA -BN-Filo) , or placebo .
The term "sponsor" used throughout this document refers to the entities listed in the Contact 
[CONTACT_23774](s), which will be provided as a separate document.
1.1. Background
Ebola viruses belong to the Filoviridae famil y and cause Ebola virus disease (EVD) , which can 
induce severe hemorrhagic fever inhumans andnonhuman primates (NHP). Case fatalit y rates in 
Ebola disease range from 25% to90% (average: 50%), according to the World Health Organization 
(WHO).6These viruses are highly  prioritized by [CONTACT_475831], who has defined 
them as ‘Category  A’ agents, due to the high mortality  rate of infected individuals. Currently , no 
cure exists and no vaccine has been licensed in Europe or the [LOCATION_002] for this disease. 
Filoviruses are named for their long, filamentous shape. Within this filamentous virus, a single 
19-kilobase (kb) negative -sense RNA genome encodes 7 proteins: the GP, the polymerase, the NP, 
the secondary  matrix protein, the transcriptional activator, the polymerase cofactor, and the matrix 
protein. The virion surface is covered by  [CONTACT_576665], which is believed to be the 
sole host attachment factor for filoviruses. Following cell entry , the viruses replicate their genomes 
and viral proteins in the cytoplasm using anRNA -dependent RNA polymerase, which is carried 
into the cell together with the virus.2
In this Phase 3study , the sponsor’s adenovirus seroty pe 26 (Ad26) vector expressing the EBOV 
Mayinga GP (Ad26.ZEBOV) and the MVA -BN vector with EBOV, SUDV ,and MARV GP and 
TAFV NP insert s(MVA -BN-Filo) will be evaluated as a heterologous 2-dose vaccin eregimen, in

studies (EBL3002 and EBL3003) and 3ongoing Phase 3 studies (EBL3001 , EBL3005 ,and 
EBL4001) . A planned Phase 2 study  (EBL2005) will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity  of 
the vaccine regimen in infants aged 4-11 months. In addition, 2Phase 2studies in adult health care 
and frontline workers in Africa (EBL2007 and EBL2009) and 2Phase 3studies (EBL3008
[vaccine deplo yment in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ] and EBL3009 [vaccination of 
sponsor employ eesin case of deploy ment in high-risk situations]) are planned. An additional 
Phase 1 study  with the multivalent vaccine VAC69120FLV1001 has been completed, where a 
group receiving Ad26.ZEBO V, MVA -BN-Filo in a 56 -day interval was included as a control arm.
The data from this control arm support the safety  and immunogenicit y of the Ad26.ZEBOV, 
MVA -BN-Filo vaccine regimen in a 56 -day interval.
As of19 April 2019 ,an estimated 6,800participant s (estimation based on randomization ratios)
have received at least the Dose 1vaccination (Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA -BN-Filo, or placebo/active 
comparator) , including approximately  1,800children (1-17yearsof age) and 400human 
immunodeficiency  virus ( HIV)+adults who have been vaccinated.
Refer to the latest versions of the Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA -BN-Filo IBs and Addenda for more 
details.3,4A summar yis provided below.
Phase 1 Studies
Final analysis data are available for the 4 randomized, placebo -controlled, observer- blind, Phase 1 
studies that were conducted in health y adult Western ([LOCATION_008] and [LOCATION_002]) and 
African (Ken ya, Tanzania, and Uganda) male and female participants, aged ≥18to ≤50years, 
outside of EBOV outbreak areas. Inthese studies, Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA -BN-Filo were
administered intramusc ularly  (IM)as homologous or heterologous 2-dose vaccin eregimens, in 
7-, 14-, 28-, or [ADDRESS_756248] frequently  reported solicited adverse events reported in the

The Ad26.ZEBOV , MVA -BN-Filo vaccine regimens are highl y immunogenic and induce 
considerable humoral as well as cellular immune responses , regardless of vaccine sequence and 
dose level .
Phase 2/3 Studies 
In the ongoing , randomized, controlled Phase 2/3studies , enrollment of both adults and children 
is complete . The safet y data from 5Phase 2/3 studies (EBL2001, EBL2002, EBL3001, EBL3002, 
and EBL3003) were unblinded to the group level in response to the May [ADDRESS_756250] been reconciled and 
include, in addition to the studies listed below, serious adverse event data from 
EBL2004 /PREVAC .
In general, the vaccin eregimen of Ad26.ZEBOV followed by [CONTACT_243680]-BN-Filo 56days later was 
well tolerated and no safety signals were identified. The majority  of solicited adverse events were 
of mild or moderate intensity  after vaccination with Ad26.ZEBOV or MVA -BN-Filo. The 
frequency  of grade 3 pyrexia ( ≥39.0 C) was less than 1% following vaccination and the incidence 
of any febrile response was less than 7.5% in any  group. As expected, the frequency  of local and 
systemic reactogenicity  was more common in healthy  adult participants who received active 
vaccine compared to placebo and was similar to the incidence reported in the Phase 1 studies. 
Reactogenicit y was also slightly  more commonly  reported among participants following 
Ad26.ZEBOV than following MVA -BN-Filo vaccination which was also noted in the Phase 1 
studies.
A review of the unblinded safet y summary  reveals that serious adverse events were reported in 
46healthy  adults (2.2%) vaccinated with the active vaccine regimen and in 9 participa nts (2.2%) 
vaccinated with placebo. There was 1serious adverse event reported in HIV-infected adults which 
occurred in the active vaccine group. From the still blinded studies, a total of [ADDRESS_756251] been reported in adults, adolescents ,and children in study EBL2004 /PREVAC.

1.2. Benefit/Risk Section
1.2.1. Know n Benefits
The clinical benefit of a 2-dose combination o f Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA -BN-Filo is to be 
established.
1.2.2. Potential Benefits
Participants may benefit from clinical testing and physical examination; others may benefit from 
the knowledge that they may aid in the development of an Ebola vaccine. There is no direc t 
individual benefit from vaccination for the participants at the current development stage.
1.2.3. Know n Risks 
The safet y, reactogenicity, and immunogenicit y of the Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA -BN-Filo vaccines 
are being evaluated in a number ofcompleted and ongoing clinical studies in adults and children 
≥[ADDRESS_756253] 
been administered to more than 13,300 individuals without unexpected or serious adverse reactions 
reported. For details, see the safet y data presented in Section 1.1.
1.2.4. Potential Risks
The following potential risks for Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA -BN-Filo are specified in the protocol 
and will be monitored during the stud y.
Risks Related to Vaccination
In general, IM injection may cause local itching, warmth, pain, tenderness, erythema/redness, 
induration/swelling, arm discomfort, or bruising of the skin at vaccine injection sites.
Participants may  exhibit general signs and s ymptom s associated with administration of a vaccine, 
including fever, chills, rash, myalgia , nausea/vomiting, headache, dizziness, arthralgia, general 
itching, and fatigue . These side effects will be monitored, but are generall y short -term and do not 
require treatment.
Syncope can occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines and syncope can be 
accompanied by [CONTACT_130361]. Procedures should be in place to avoid falling injury . If syncope develops, 
participants should be observed until the symptoms resolve. Fear of injection might lead to fainting 
and fast breathing.

clinic to treat serious allergic reactions. Participants with a known allergy , or history  of 
anaph ylaxis or other serious adverse reactions to vaccines or vaccine products (including any of 
the constituents of the study  vaccine) will be excluded from th e stud y.
Risks From Blood Draws
As with all clinical studies requiring blood sampling, there are risks associated with venipuncture 
and multiple blood sample collection. Blood drawing may cause pain, tenderness, bruising, 
bleeding, dizziness, vasovagal response, syncope, and, rarel y, infection at the site where the blood 
is taken. The total blood volume to be collected is considered to be an acceptable amount of blood 
over this time period from the population in this study  (see Section 16.1). 
Vaccine -Induced Seropositivity
In general, uninfected participants who are taking part in Ebola vaccine studies may develop 
Ebola -specific antibodies as a result ofan immune response to the candidate Ebola vaccine, 
referred to as vaccine -induced seropositivity  (VISP). These antibodies may be detected in Ebola 
serologic tests, causing the test to appear positive even in the absence of actual Ebola infection. 
VISP may  become evident during the study , or after the study  has been completed. Th e potential 
of a participant becoming PCR- positive after vaccination was assessed in study 
VAC52150EBL1002. None of the participants tested positive for E BOV after vaccination.
Consent will be obtained to contact [CONTACT_576666], to let them know 
that the participant is taking part in this study . It is important for all of the participant’s doctors to 
know that the participant may be administered experimental vaccines. Participants will be provided 
with a "wallet (study ) card" and instructed to carry  this card with them for the duration of the study  
(see Section 12.3.1 ).
Pregnancy and Birth Control
The effect of the vaccines on a fetus or nursing baby [CONTACT_111175]. Female participant s of 
childbearing potential will be required to agree to use birth control for sexual intercourse beginning 
28days prior to vaccination and continuing until at least 3months post Dose 1vaccination ,
28days post Dose 2vaccination ,or [ADDRESS_756255] booster vaccination (Groups 5-6 onl y), 
whichever comes later . Women who are pregnant or breast -feeding may  not receive further study 
vaccines but may  continue other study  procedures at the discretion of the investi gator.
Male participant s should inform the investigator and the sponsor in case their partner would 
become pregnant during the study .
Unknown Risks 
There may be other risks that are not known. If any significant new risks are identified, the 
investigator and participants will be informed.

Approved , Date: 15 June [ZIP_CODE].2.5. Overall Benefit/Risk A ssessment
Based on the available data and proposed safet y measures, the overall benefit/risk assessment for 
this clinical study  is considered acceptable for the following reasons:
To date, safet y data from the studies in the clinical development program revealed no 
significant safet y issues (see Section 1.1). Further experience from Ad26.ZEBOV or
MVA -BN-Filo will be gained from currentl y ongoing clinical studies.
Only  participants who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria (specified 
in Section 4 ) will be allowed to participate in this study . The selection criteria include adequate 
provisions to minimize the risk and protect the well -being of participants in the study .
Several safet y measures are included in this protocol to minimize the potential risk to 
participants, including the following:
Participants will remain under observation at the study  site for at least 30minutes after 
each vaccination for presence of any acute reactions and solicited events ,or longe r if 
deemed necessary  by [CONTACT_093] (eg, in case of grade 3 adverse events). Refer to 
Section 6for more information on emergency  care. 
Safety evaluations (physical examinations and vital sign measurements) will be 
performed at scheduled visits during the study , as indicated in the TIME AND EVENTS 
SCHEDUL E.
The investigator or clinical designee will document unsolicited adverse events as 
indicated in Section 12.3.1 .
Any clinically  significant abnormalities (including those persisting at the end of the 
study /early  withdrawal) will be followed by [CONTACT_43727] a 
clinically  stable endpoint is reached.
There are pre-specified pausing rules for all participants, that would result in pausing of 
further vaccination if predefined conditions occur, preventing exposure of new 
participants to study  vaccine until the sponsor reviews all safet y data (see Section 9.3.2 ).
Participants will discontinue study  vaccine for the reasons included in Section 10.2.
If acute illness (excluding minor illnesses such as diarrhea or mild upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4348]) or fever (body temperature ≥38.0°C) occur at the scheduled time for 
vaccination, the participant may be vaccinated up to 10days beyond the window allowed 
for the scheduled vaccination, or be withdrawn from that vaccination at the discretion of 
the investigator and after consultation with the sponsor (see Section 6.1).
Contraindications to Dose [ADDRESS_756256] (Dose 1) and [ADDRESS_756257] 
(Dose2) elicit equivalent humoral immune responses. The 3 consecutive lots are Lots A, B, andC 
for Ad26.ZEBOV and Lots 1, 2, and 3 for MVA -BN-Filo and these lots will be compared in

The results of this study  will also aid in increasing the size of the overa ll safet y and 
immunogenicit y data packages to support approval of the Ad26.ZEBOV , MVA -BN-Filo 2-dose 
vaccin eregimen by a regulatory  authority .
Administration of a booster dose of Ad26.ZEBOV given at 1-and [ADDRESS_756258] 
anamnestic respon se to the booster vaccine. Administration of a booster dose in anticipation of 
imminent exposure to Ebola (ie ,prior to deploy ment to an Ebola outbreak area) may be desired as
a precautionary  measure to optimize protection .However, there is currently  no clinical data 
available on the immunogenicity  and safety  of such an Ad26.ZEBOV booster dose when 
administered less than 1 year after the primary  vaccin eregimen. Booster doses as early as 
2-3months after Dose 2 were assessed in a multivalent filovirus and an HIV vaccine program and 
were able to induce a marked increase in antibody concentrations, although to a lower magnitude 
than a later booster. Furthermore, based on the kinetics of decrease in antibody  concentrations after 
the Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA -BN-Filo vaccine regimen, supported by a mechanistic model of antibody 
persistence and general vaccine knowledge, an Ad26.ZEBOV booster dose administered from 4 
months after completion ofthe primary  vaccine regimen is likely to induce a strong anamnestic 
response based on mature immune memory  and to maximize the likelihood of protection in case 
of imminent risk of exposure to Ebola. Therefore, a separate Booster Cohort of participants will 
receive the primary  vaccine regimen followed by  a booster dose of Ad26.ZEBOV 4 months after 
Dose 2.The participants in this Booster Cohort (Groups 5-6)will be assessed for safety  and 
immunogenicit y.

Group 4 will receive 2 placebo vaccinations.
In the main part of the study (Groups 1- 4), a planned total number of at least 741 participants will 
be enroll ed. All participants in this part of the study will be assessed for safety and reactogenicit y; 
456participants (144 in each of Groups 1 to 3 and 24 in Group 4) will be assessed for 
immunogenicit y (immunogenicity  subset). Participants will be randoml y assigned to one of

To mitigate these issues, additional participants may  be recruited in the immunogenicit y subset .
Shortly  after participants received Dose 1 vaccination, ‘stay -at-home’ orders were imposed in the 
areas where the sites were located. Although the sites had implemented appropriate safet y 
measures to prevent spread of SARS -CoV -2, approximately  22% of par ticipants did not return to 
the site within the protocol defined windows (±3days) for Dose [ADDRESS_756272] been lifted and participants are now 
able to return to the sites for follow -up. In order to reduce the number of additional participants 
needed for the primary  and secondary  immunogenicity  analyses, it is possible to widen the 
acceptable window around Dose 2 administration without jeopardizing the primary  and secondary 
objectives of the study . The protocol has been amended to widen the upper limit of the window 
around Day 57 (Dose 2) to Day 85 (ie, Day 57+28 days). Therefore, the number of additional 
participants necessary  for inclusion in the immunogenicity  subset and who would receive their 
second vaccination within the Day 57 window will be reduced.
For the Booster Cohort (Groups 5-6), a planned total of 60 participants will be enrolled. All 
participants in this cohort will be assessed for safet y, reactogenicity , and immunogenicit y. 
Participants will be randomly  assigned to the 2 groups in a 5:1 ratio, ie, to a group of approximately 
50 participants receiving the primary  vaccine regimen (Ad26.ZEBOV followed by [CONTACT_243680]-BN-Filo 
56 days later) followed by a booster dose of Ad26.ZEBOV 4 months after Dose 2 (Group 5), or, 
to a placebo group of approximately  10 participants (Group 6).
These 2 additional Groups (5 and 6) have not yet been recruited. It is expected that these additional 
groups will likely receive their second dose in the fall of 2020, at which time it is possible that a 
second wave of COVID -[ADDRESS_756273] of medically  stable men and women 18 to50years of age

have received a candidate Ebola vaccine or a candidate Ad26 -or MV A-based vaccine in the past 
or with known allergy  or history  of anaphy laxis or other serious adverse reactions to vaccines or 
vaccine products, including known allergy  to chicken or egg protein and gentamicin will be 
excluded.
The participants will be randomized at baseline (Day 1)to receive the 2-dose vaccin eregimen with 
either Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA -BN-Filo, or placebo. Randomization of the Booster Cohort 
(Groups 5-6) will take place once randomization of the main part of the study  (Groups 1-4) has

be recorded until the end of the study with a telephone call foreseen for Groups 1-[ADDRESS_756279] Dose 2 (Day 23 7).
For the main part of the study  (Groups 1 -4), the primary safet y and immunogenicity  analy ses will 
be performed when all participants in the main part of the study  (Groups 1-4) have completed the 
28-day postDose2time point or discontinued earlier , and the database is locked. Only sponsor 
personnel not involved in the review and determination of causalit y of serious adverse events 
reported during the study will be unblinded to Groups 1-4at this time point . An interim analy sis 
will be performed when all participants in Groups 1-[ADDRESS_756280] study -related visit (or discontinue earlier), and the database has been locked.
For the Booster Cohort (Groups 5 -6), an interim analy siswill be performed when all participants 
in Groups 5-[ADDRESS_756281] booster dose time point (or discontinue dearlier) .This 
analysis, based on the corresponding locked database, will include all available data (including 
safet y and 21-day post booster dose immunogenicity  data) up to the cut off. Only  sponsor 
personnel not involved in the review and determination of causalit y of serious adverse events 
reported during the stud y will be unblinded to Groups [ADDRESS_756282] discontinued earlier (and the database is locked) . 
A planned analysis may be combined with the subsequent analysis, if deemed necessary  (eg, when 
the dates of 2 planned database locks are very close).
The study  is considered completed when the last participant has completed the last study  
procedure .
The investigators, together with the sponsor’s medical monitor, will be responsible for the safety 
monitoring of the study . If at least one pre-specified pausing rule is met, administration of study  
vaccine will be paused (see Section 9.3.2 for details) .As per Janssen standard procedures, a

regular surveillance of all clinical studies using the Ebola vaccines Ad26.Z EBOV, MVA- BN-Filo
(seeSection 9.3.1 for details ).
3.2. Study Design Rationale
Control and Blinding
A placebo control will be used to establish the freque ncy and magnitude of changes in clinical
endpoints that may occur in the absence of active study  vaccine .Randomization will be used to 
minimize bias in the assignment of participants to vaccination groups, to increase the likelihood 
that known and unknown participant attributes (eg, demographic and baseline characteristics) are 
evenl y balanced across vaccination groups, and to enhance the validity  of statistical comparisons 
across vaccination groups . Blinded vaccination will be used to reduce potential bias during data 
collection and evaluation of clinical endpoints.
Vaccination Groups
Groups 1, 2, and 3 will only  differ in the lots of the study  vaccine , while the dose of each vaccine 
and the sequence of vaccination will be identical. For Groups 1, 2, 3 and 5, Dose1consists of 
Ad26.ZEBOV at a nominal dose of 5x1010vp and Dose 2 consists of MVA -BN-Filo at a nominal 
dose of 1x108Inf U.For Group 5, thebooster dose consists of Ad26.ZEBOV at a nominal dose of 
5x1010vp from a single lot.Group s 4and 6 will receive placebo.
4. PARTICIP ANT POPULA TION
Screening for eligible participants will be performed at baseline (Day 1), which is also the day  of

Approved , Date: 15 June 2020Blinding
The investigator will not be provided with randomization codes. The codes will be maintained 
within the IWRS, which has the functionality  to allow the investigator to break the blind for an 
individual participant .
Data that may potentially  unblind the study  vaccine allocation (ie,antibodies to study  vaccine, 
study  vaccine preparation/accountability  data,or other specific laboratory data) will be handled 
with special care to ensure that the site and sponsor personnel involved in the review and 
determination of causality of serious adverse events reported during the study willremain blinded 
until final database lock. This can include making special provisions, such as segregating the data 
in question from view b y the investigators, clinical team, or oth ers as appropriate until the time of 
database lock and unblindin g. The pharmacy  and preparation of study  vaccine will be monitored 
by [CONTACT_576672] (see Section 17.8).
Under normal circumstances, the blind should not be broken until all participants have completed 
the study and the database is locked. T he investigator may  in an emergency  determine the identity 
of the study  vaccine by[CONTACT_23793]. While the responsibility  to break the code in 
emergency  situations resides solely  with the investigator, it is recommended that the investigator 
contact [CONTACT_184904], before breakin g 
the blind. Telephone contact [CONTACT_97500] 24hours per day, 
7days per week. In the event the blind is broken, the sponsor must be informed as soon as possible.
The date, time, and reason for the unblinding must be documented by [CONTACT_8784]. The 
documentation received from the IWRS indicating the code break must be retained with the 
participant's source documents in a secure manner.
In general, randomization codes will be disclosed fully  only if the study is completed and the
clinical database is locked . However, for the primary analysis, the randomization codes and, if 
required, the translation of randomization codes into vaccination and control groups will be 
disclosed to authorized sponsor personnel involved in the analysis of the data . At the time of the 
primary  anal ysis, the participants, the investigator(s) and study  site personnel will remain blinded 
to individual participants’ study  vaccine allocation .
If the randomization code is broken by [CONTACT_130384], the participant 
must discontinue further study  vaccine administration and must be followed as appropriate (see 
Section 10.2 for details). If the randomization code is broken by [CONTACT_576673] y reporting 
purposes, the participant should not discontinue further study  vaccine administration and may 
remain in the study  (if the randomization code is still blinded to the study site personnel and the 
participant ).

An overview of the study  vaccination schedule is provide din Section 3.1,Table 1. All participant s 
will receive a vaccination, according to randomization, on Day 1, on Day 57, and on Day 177
(Groups 5 -6 onl y)at the following dose levels:
-Ad26.ZEBOV: 5x1010vp, supplied in a single -usevial (0.5mL extractable) (Groups 1, 2, 3 , 
5);
-MVA -BN-Filo: 1x108InfU, supplied in a single -use vial (0.5mL extractable) 
(Groups 1, 2, 3 , 5);
-Placebo: 0.9% saline, 0.5 mL  (Groups 4 and 6 ).
Blinding will be achieved by [CONTACT_576674] -related procedure, and by [CONTACT_576675] a masked s yringe b y a blinded study  vaccine administrator.
Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA -BN-Filo, or placebo, will be administered as 0.5-mL IM injections in 
the deltoid muscle . The injection site should be free from an y injury , local skin condition, or other 
issue that might interfere with the evaluation of local reactions (eg,significant tattoo). In each 
participant ,it is recommen ded that the second vaccination isadministered in the opposite deltoid 
muscle from the first vaccination (unless the opposite arm has a condition that prevents evaluating 
the arm after injection) and it should be recorded in the eCRF in which arm the vaccination has 
been administered. The booster dose may be administered in either deltoid. No local or topi[INVESTIGATOR_576651].
After each vaccination, participant s will remain at thestudy site for at least 30minutes for presence
of any acute reactions and solicited events , or longer if deemed necessary  by [CONTACT_093] (eg,in 
case of grade 3 adverse events).
As with an y vaccine, allergic reactions following vaccination with the study  vaccine are pos sible. 
Therefore, appropriate drugs and medical equipment to treat acute anaph ylactic reactions must be 
immediately  available and a medicall y qualified member of the study site personnel trained to 
recognize and treat anaphy laxis must be present at the study siteduring the entire vaccination 
procedure and post vaccination monitoring period.
The investigator must provide emergency  care as needed for any participant who experiences a 
life-threatening event. All study  sites will have facilities, equipment, andthe ability  to manage an 
anaph ylactic reaction. If additional therap y is required, the investigator will arrange for transport 
to the closest appropriate facility  for continuing care.
The Site Investigational Product Procedures Manual specifies the maximu m time that will be 
allowed between preparation and administration of the study  vaccine .

screening. If a participant 'sclinical status changes (including receipt of additional medical records) 
after screening but before Dose 1vaccination such that heor sheno longer meets all eligibility
criter ia, then the participant should be excluded from further participation in the study . 
Eligible participants will be allocated to a vaccination group as described in Section 5. Before each 
vaccination , a urine pregnancy  test (only  for women of childbearing potential), a full physical 
examination (before Dose 1, Day 1) or an abbreviated, symptom -directed physical examination 
(before Dose 2and before the booster dose [Groups 5-6 only]), and measurement of vital signs 
will be performed as indicated b y the investigator . 
Participants will be vaccinated as described in Section 6. After each vaccination, participants will 
remain under observation at the study  site for at least 30 minutes for presence of any acute reactions 
and solicited events, or longer if deemed necessary  by [CONTACT_093] (eg, in case of grade 3 
adverse events) . Solicited and unsolicited adverse events emerging during the observation period 
will be recorded in the eCRF . 
Upon discharge from the study  site, participants will receive a thermometer (to measure body

Adverse Events
All adverse events will be reported as specified in Section 12.3.[ADDRESS_756301] 
30minutes for presence of any acute reactions and solicited events, or longer if deemed necessary 
by [CONTACT_093]. Upon discharge from the study site, participants will be provided with a diary 
and instructions on how to complete the diary : symptoms of solicited local and systemic adverse 
events will be collected in the diary  in the evening after each vaccination and then daily for the 
next 7days. The participants will complete their diary  cards at home and these will be reviewed 
by [CONTACT_576679] y 57 visit (before Dose 2 vaccination) and at the Day 78 visit ,and 
at the Day 184 visit (Groups 5-6 only).Diary  information will be transcribed by [CONTACT_576680]. Once a solicited sy mptom from a diary is considered to be of 
severit y grade 1 or above, it will be referred to as a solicited adverse event.
Solicited Injection Site (Local) Adverse Events
Participants will be asked to note in the diary occurrences of pain/tenderness, erythema ,
induration/swellin g,and prurit us at the study  vaccine injection site daily  for 7days postvaccination 
(day of vaccination and the subsequent 7days). The extent (largest diameter) of any erythema, and 
induration/swelling should be measured (using the ruler supplied) and re corded daily . 
Solicited Systemic Adverse Events
Participants will be instructed on how to record daily  temperature using a thermometer provided 
for home use. The (oral) body  temperatu re of the participant should be recorded in the diary in the 
evening of the day of vaccination, and then daily for the next 7days approximately  at the same 
time each day. If more than one measurement is made on any given day, the highest temperature 
of that day  will be used in the eCRF.
Fever is defined as endogenous elevatio n of bod y temperature ≥38.0°C, as recorded in at least one 
measurement.5
Participants will also be instructed on how to note daily in the diary symptoms for 7days 
postvaccination (day of vaccination and the subsequent 7 days) of the following events: fatigue,

WITHDRA WAL FROM THE STUDY
10.1. Completion
A participant in Groups 1-4will be considered to have completed the study  if he or she has 
completed assessments at the Day 237 time point (ie, 6-month s post Dose 2).A participant in 
Groups [ADDRESS_756303] completed the study  if he or she has completed assessments 
at the Day  537time point (ie, [ADDRESS_756304] booster dose) .
10.2. Discontinuation of Study Vaccine /Withdrawal From the Study
Discontinuation of Study Vaccine
A participant will not be automatically  withdrawn from the study  if he or shehasto discontinue 
study  vaccine before the end of the vaccine regimen.
A participant 's study  vaccine (Dose 1,Dose 2, or booster dose)may be discontinue dat the 
discretion of the investigator and after consultation with the sponsor for any of the events in 
Section 6.1.
A participant’s study  vaccine should be permanently discontinued if:
The investigator believes that for safety or reactogenicity reasons (eg,adverse event) it is in 
the best interest of the participant to discontinue study  vaccine;
The participant becomes pregnant;
Confirmed EVD ;
Theparticipant experiences any  of the events described in Section 6.2;
The randomization code is broken by  [CONTACT_130384].
Participants meeting any of the reasons listed above must not receive any further study  vaccine but 
should continue to be monitored for safety  and immunogenicit y according to the protocol if this 
does not result in safety  risksfor the participant . In case of earl y discontinuation of study  vaccine
due to an adverse event, the investigator will collect all information relevant to the adverse event

isnot obliged to give reason(s) for withdrawing prematurely , the investigator should make a 
reasonable effort to ascertain the reason(s) while fully  respecting the participant’s rights. 
A participant will be withdrawn from the study  for any  of the following reasons:
Lost to follow -up
Withdrawal of consent
Death
Repeated failure to comply  with protocol requirements
Decision b y the sponsor or the investigator to stop or cancel the stud y
Decision by  [CONTACT_576682]/ IEC to stop or cancel the study
If a participant is lost to follow -up, every  reasonable effort must be made by [CONTACT_576683]/withdrawal. The 
measures taken to follow up must be documented.
When a participant withdraws before completing the study , the reason for withdrawal is to be 
documented in the eCRF and in the source document. Study vaccine assigned to the withdrawn 
participant may not be assigned to another participant .Participants who withdraw will be replaced, 
as long as the participant has not been vaccinated yet.
If a participant withdraws earl y from the study , early  withdra wal assessments should be obtained 
per the assessments for the 21-day post Dose 2 visit, with the exception of the immunogenicity 
assessments , if applicable . A participant who wishes to withdraw consent from participation in the 
study  will be offered an op tional visit for safety  follow -up (before formal withdrawal of consent), 
but the participant has the right to refuse .
11. STATISTICA L METHODS
Statistical analy sis will be done by [CONTACT_43758]. A general 
description of the statistical methods to be used to analy ze the immunogenicity and safet y data is 
outlined below. Specific details will be provided in the St atistical Analy sis Plan (SAP) .
For the main part of the study  (Groups 1- 4), the primary safet y and immunogenicity  analy seswill 
be conducted when all participants in Group s 1-[ADDRESS_756306] completed the 28-day postDose2time 
point or discontinued earlier , and the database is locked . Only sponsor personnel not involved in 
the review and determination of causalit y of serious adverse events reported during the study will

Approved , Date: 15 June 2020be unblinded to Groups 1-4at this time point. Investigator, study  site personnel (except for those 
with primary  responsibility  for study  vaccine preparation and dispensing) ,and participants will 
remain blinded to the study  vaccine allocation until the last participant in Groups 1-[ADDRESS_756307] Dose2time point (ie, Day 237, last study  related visit)or discontinues earlier 
(and the database is locked). An interim analy sis will be performed when all participants in Groups 
1-[ADDRESS_756308] study -related visit (or discontinue 
earlier), and the database has been locked.
For the Booster Cohort (Groups 5 -6), an interim analy sis will be performed when all participants 
in Groups 5-[ADDRESS_756309] booster dose time point (or discontinued earlier). 
This analysis, based on the corresponding locked database, will include all available data 
(including safet y and 21-day post booster dose immunogenicit y data) up to the cut off. Only 
sponsor personnel not involved in the review and determination of causality  of serious adver se 
events reported during the study  will be unblinded to Groups 5 -6 at this time point. I nvestigators, 
study  site personnel (except for those with primary  responsibility  for study  vaccine preparation 
and dispensing), and participants will remain blinded tothe study  vaccine allocation until the 
database is locked for the final anal ysis.
The final analysis will be conducted when all participants in the study  have completed the last 
study -related visit or have discontinued earlier .
A planned analysis may be combined with the subsequent analysis, if deemed necessary  (eg, when 
the dates of 2 planned database locks are very close).
11.1. Analysis Sets
Full Analysis Set: The full analysis set will include all participants with at least one study  vaccine
administration documented. Participants will be analyzed according to the study  vaccine they 
actuall y received.
Per Protocol Analysis Set: The perprotocol analy sis setwill include all randomized and 
vaccinated participants, who received both Dose 1and Dose 2 vaccinati ons(administered within 
the protocol -defined window), hadat least one postvaccination (ie, after the date of vaccination)
evaluable immunogenicity  sample, and had no major protocol deviations that may influenc ethe 
immune response .The per protocol analysis set will be defined for participants included in the 
immunogenicit y subset. Similarly , the per protocol anal ysis set for the Booster Cohort (Groups 5-
6)will include all vaccinated participants, who received Dose 1, Dose 2,and the booster 
vaccinat ion (ie, both Dose 2 and Ad26.ZEBOV booster vaccination within the protocol -defined 
window), had at least one postvaccination (ie, after the date of vaccination) evaluable 
immunogenicit y sample, and had no major protocol deviations that may influence the immune 
response .

Approved , Date: 15 June 202011.2. Sample Size Determination
The following assumptions are used in the sample size determination :
-A standard deviation of 0.55 on the log 10scale (binding antibody  levels against the EBOV GP 
using ELISA [EU/mL ] 21days post Dose 2vaccination , following Dose 1 on Day 1 and 
Dose2 on Day 57). This standard deviation is obtained by [CONTACT_1583] 10% to the maximum 
observed standard deviation at [ADDRESS_756310] Dose 1vaccination in the Phase 2/3 studies and 
will also ensure adequate power in demonstrating lot-to-lot consistency  at 56days postDose 1
vaccination (ie,secondary  objective).
- An overall 5% dropout rate.
In addition, specific assum ptions are made for the equivalence testing for the primary  and 
secondary  objective :
Assumptions specific to equiva lence testing:
-A relative difference of 10% in GMC of binding antibodies between groups (ie,Groups 1 
to3). This is expressed asGMC (1)= 0.9 x GMC (3), where GMC (1), GMC (2), and GMC (3)denote 
the ordered GMC. This relative difference is based on both the process variability  in vp content 
of the Ad26.ZEBOV lots and Inf Ucontent of MVA -BN-Filo lots. A linear relationship 
between log 10-transformed vaccine contents (ie, Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA -BN-Filo) and 
log 10-transformed GMC of binding antibodies (ELISA GMC) was assumed. 
-Clinical equivalence limits on the GMC ratio are 0.[ADDRESS_756311] 90% to show 
immunogenic equivalence of the 3groups (Groups 1 to 3) 21days post Dose 2vaccination 
(ie,with 96.55 % power for each of the 3pairwise comparisons [ie, Groups 1 vs 2, 1 vs 3and 
2 vs 3]). PASS 11 is used for the sample c alculations. In order to enlarge the safety  database, the 
total number per group was increased to 234 (ie, additional 90 participant s per group for safet y 
only). 
Arandomization ratio of 6:6:6:1 (Group 1:Group 2:Group 3:Group 4) yields an overall sample 
size of 741participants, with 234participants per group (in Groups 1 to 3) receiving 
Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA -BN-Filo, and 39 participants receiving placebo (Group 4).
Due to the recent (on 11-March -2020) WHO declared COVID -19 pandemic, a potential higher 
dropout rate (ie ,higher than 5%) may occur. In addition, some participants in the immunogenicit y 
subset may  be excluded from primary  immunogenicity  equivalence testing because of:
Participant not receiving Dose 2; OR
Participant receiving Dose 2 outside the protocol defined window; OR
Participant not attending the [ADDRESS_756312] Dose 2 visit; OR
Participant attending the [ADDRESS_756313] Dose 2 visit outside the protocol-defined window.

Approved , Date: 15 June 2020To mitigate these issues, additional participants may be recruited in the immunogenicit y subset.
Shortly  after participants received D ose 1 vaccination, ‘stay -at-home’ orders were imposed in the 
areas where the sites were located and approximately 22% of participants did not return to the site 
withi n the protocol defined windows ( ±3days) for Dose 2 administration. 
Examination of the immunogenicity  data from studies (VAC52150EBL2001 and 
VAC52150EBL2002) in which Dose 2 was administered at intervals ≥56 days reveals that 
although there appear sto be trend ofincreasing GMC swith increasing interval sbetween Dose1 
and Dose 2, the variability (standard deviation) of the immune responses ( binding antibody  levels 
against the EBOV GP using ELISA [EU/mL ])remains stable and in line with the currentl y 
assumed standard deviation of 0.55 (on the log 10-scale) . Assuming that the delay ed Dose 2 
administration will be randomly  distributed among the groups (ie, Group s 1-4), widening the 
acceptable time frame to administer Dose 2 by [CONTACT_576684]28 days
(ie, Day 57+28 days)is not expected toadversely affect the primary  and secondary  objectives of 
the study . With the widened window, the number of additional participants necessary to maintain 
approximatel y 90% power to test the primary and secondary h ypotheses will be reduced.
Approximately  60 participants will be randomized in a 5:1 active :placebo ratio (Group 5:Group 6), 
which will provide a reasonable estimation of the humoral immune response to a boost er dose.
11.3. Immunogenicity  Analyses
Descriptive statistics (including geometric means with their corresponding 95% CIs, median, 
interquartile range, minimum, maximum, as applicable) will be calculated for continuous 
immunologic parameters at each time point. Graphical representations of immunologic parameters 
will be prepared, as applicable. Frequency  tabulations will be calculated for discrete (qualitative) 
immunologic parameters at each time point.
To assess the primary  objective, each pairwise comparison (ie, Groups 1 vs 2, 1 vs 3, 2 vs 3) of
the anti -EBOV GP binding antibody  responses 21days post Dose 2vaccination with 
MVA -BN-Filo will be based on ratios of the GMC with corresponding 95% CI. Equivalence of 
any 2groups will be shown if the 95% CI  of the e stimated GMC ratio lies entirely  within 0.5 and 
2.0. Lot-to-lotconsistency  is accomplished if equivalence is shown for all 3pairwise comparisons. 
For the secondary  objective, each pairwise comparison of the anti -EBOV GP binding antibody  
responses 56days postDose 1vaccination with Ad26.ZEBOV will be based on ratios of the GMCs 
with corresponding 95% CI. Equivalence of any 2groups will be shown if the 95% CI of the 
estimated GMC ratio lies entirel y within 0.5 and 2.0 . Lot-to-lotconsistency (forAd26.ZEBOV) is 
accomplished if equivalence is shown for all 3 pairwise comparisons. 
As a sensitivity  analyses, both the primary  and secondary  hypotheses of equivalence will also be 
tested based on data of participants who received the second vaccination within the original 
window (±3 day s)around the Day  57 visit.

safet y parameters will be analyzed descriptively  (showing the mean, standard deviation, median ,
and quartiles [Q1 and Q 3]).
Baseline for all vital signs and physical examinations will be defined as the last evaluation done
before Dose 1 vaccination.
Adverse Events (Including Reactogenicity)
The verbatim terms used in the eCRF by [CONTACT_576685] (MedDRA). For each adverse event, the 
percentage ofparticipants who experience at least 1occurrence of the given event will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_19313]. In addition, comparisons between groups will be provided if appropriate . 
All reported adverse events and events -related diary  information (solicited local at injection site 
and systemic, and unsolicited) with onset within [ADDRESS_756315] Dose 1, Dose 2or booster dose
vaccination (ie, treatment- emergent adverse events) will be included in the analysis. For each 
adverse event, the number and percentage of participants who experience at least 1 occurrence of 
the given event will be summarized by  [CONTACT_43108] .
Summaries, listings, datasets, or participant narratives may  be provided, as appropriate, for those 
participants who die, who discontinue study  vaccine due to an adverse event, or who experience a 
severe or a serious adverse event.
Solicited local (at injection site) and systemic adverse events will be summarized descriptivel y. 
The overall frequencies per vaccine group as well as frequencies according to severity  and duration 
will be calculated for solicited adverse events. In addition, the number and percentages of 
participants with at lea st one solicited local (at injection site) or systemic adverse event will be

Method of Detecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting adverse events or serious adverse events. 
Open -ended and nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inq uire 
about adverse event occurrence.
Solicited Adverse Events
Solicited adverse events are predefined local (at the injection site) and systemic events for which 
the participant is specifically  questioned and which are noted by [CONTACT_160226]  (see 
Section 9.1.2 ).
Unsolicited Adverse Events
Unsolicited adverse events are all adverse events for which the participant is not specifically  
questioned in the participant diary (see Section 9.1.2 ).
12.1. Definitions
12.1.1. Adverse Event Definitions and Classifications
Adverse Event
An advers e event is any  untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study  participant administered 
a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. An adverse event does not necessarily 
have a causal relationship with the study  vaccine . An adverse event can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non -investigational) product, whether or 
not related to that medicinal (investig ational or non-investigational) product. (Definition per 
International Council forHarmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for 
Human Use [ICH])
This includes any  occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severit y or frequency  from the 
baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures.
Note: For time period of sponsor’s adverse event collection, see Section 12.3.1 .

Approved , Date: [ADDRESS_756317] medical occurrence that at any dose:
Results in death
Is life -threatening
(The participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically  might have caused death if it were more severe.)
Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity
Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect
Is a suspected transmission of an y infectious agent via a medicinal product
Is Medicall y Important*
*Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whethe r expedited reporting is 
also appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediatel y 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_576654]. These 
should usually  be considered serious.
If a serious and unexpected adverse event occurs for which there is evidence suggesting a causal 
relationship between the study  vaccine and the event (eg, de ath from anaphylaxis), the event must 
be reported as a S[LOCATION_003]R even if it is a component of the study  endpoint (eg, all -cause mortality ).
Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event/Reference Safety Information
An adverse event is considered unlisted if the nature or severit y is not consistent with the applicable 
product reference safet y information. ForAd26.ZEBOV, MVA -BN-Filo, the expectedness of an 
adverse event will be determined b y whether or not it is listed in the IB. 
Adverse Event Associated With the Use o f the Study Vaccine
An adverse event is considered associated with the use of the study  vaccine if the attribution is
related by [CONTACT_23826] 12.1.2 .
12.1.2. Attribution Definitions
Every  effort should be made by [CONTACT_576686], ie, to administration of the study  vaccineor to alternative causes 
(eg,natural history  of underly ing diseases, concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]). This applies to all adverse 
events, whether serious or nonserious.
Causality  of adverse events should be assessed by [CONTACT_478070]:

Approved , Date: [ADDRESS_756331] Retention
In compliance with the ICH/GCP guidelines, the investigator/institution will maintain all eCRF 
and all source documents that support the data collected from each participant , as well as all study 
documents as specified in I CH/GCP Section 8, Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical 
Trial, and all study  documents as specified by [CONTACT_23859](s). The
investigator/institution will take measures to pre vent accidental or premature destruction of these 
documents.
Essential documents must be retained until at least 2years after the last approval of a marketing 
application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applicatio ns 
in an I CH region or until at least [ADDRESS_756332]. These documents will be retained for a longer period 
if required by [CONTACT_66891]. It is the 
responsibility  of the sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no 
longer need to be retained.
If the responsible investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the 
responsibility  of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_13274], custody  must be transferred to a person who will accept 
the responsibility . The sponsor must be notified in writing of the name [CONTACT_66903]. Under no circumstance shall the investig ator relocate or dispose of any study documents 
before having obtained written approval from the sponsor.
If it becomes necessary  for the sponsor or the appropriate regulatory  authority  to review any 
documentation relating to this study , the investigator /institution must permit access to such reports.
17.8. Monitoring
The sponsor will perform on-site monitoring visits as frequentl y as necessary . The monitor will 
record dates of the visits in a study  site visit log that will be kept at the study  site. The first 
post-initiation visit will be made as soon as possible after enrollment has begun. At these visits, 
the monitor will compar e the data entered into the eCRF with the source documents (vaccination 
unit and/or clinic records ). The nature and location of all source documents will be identified to 
ensure that all sources of original data required to complete the eCRF are known to the sponsor 
and study site personnel and are accessible for verification by [CONTACT_43786] -site contact. If 
electronic records are maintained at the study site, the method of verification must be discussed 
with the study site personnel . 
Direct access to source documents (medical records) must be allowed for the purpose of verifying 
that the recorded data are consistent with the original source data. Findings from this review will 
be discussed with the study site personnel . The sponsor expects that, during monitoring visits, the 
relevant study site personnel will be available, the source document swill be accessible, and a 
suitable environment will be provided for review of study -related documents. The monitor will 
meet with the investigator on a regular basis during the study  to provide feedback on the study 
conduct.

monitors will be blind ed.
In addition to on -site monitoring visits, remote contacts can occur. It is expected that during these 
remote contacts, study site personnel will be available to provide an update on the progress of the 
study  at the study  site.
Central monitoring will t ake place for data identified by  [CONTACT_70467].
17.9. Study Completion/Termination
17.9.1. Study Completion /End of Study
The study  is considered completed with the last visit for the last participant participating in the 
study . The final data from the study site will be sent to the sponsor (or designee) after completion 
of the final participant visit/phone call at that study  site, in the time frame specified in the clinical 
trial agreement.
17.9.2. Study Term ination
The sponsor reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study  at any time for any 
reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor. Study sites will be closed upon study  completion. A
study site is considered closed when all required documents and study  supplies have been collected 
and a study -site closure visit has been performed.
The investigator may initiate study -site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause and 
sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended ter mination.
Reasons for the earl y clo sure of a study site by  [CONTACT_66892]:
Failure of the investigator to comply  with the protocol, the requirements of the IEC/I RB or 
local health authorities, the sponsor's p rocedures, or GCP guidelines
Inadequate recruitment of participant s by [CONTACT_093]
Discontinuation of further study  vaccine development

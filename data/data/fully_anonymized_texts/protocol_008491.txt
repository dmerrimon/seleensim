 4 2. INTRODUCTION  
Patients with CD19+ B cell malignancies  such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 
indolent and mantle cell lymphoma, and diffuse large cell lymphoma that progress after first and 
second line conventional chemotherapy have a poor long-term  prognosis, especially if they are 
not eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplant due to the lack of a donor, or if stem cell 
transpla nt is contraindicated. This protocol will evaluate the safety and antitumor activity of 
adoptively transferring autologous T cells that are genetically modified with a self -inactivating 
(SIN) lentiviral vector to express a CD19-specific chimeric antigen re ceptor (CAR) to patients 
with advanced CD19+ B-lineage malignancies.  
 
3. BACKGROUND  
3A. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)    
 CLL is the most prevalent adult leukemia and patients may have an indolent or 
aggressive clinical course.  Tumor cells nearly universally express the CD19 antigen and variable to low density of CD20.  Asymptomatic patients without a large disease burden at diagnosis are 
usually observed until their disease progresses and requires  therapy.  Patients with high risk 
features including non-mutated immunoglobulin genes, expression of ZAP-70, CD38, and/or adverse genetic changes  (11q23 or 17p-) detected by [CONTACT_462457][INVESTIGATOR_462432] 
1.   
 For patients requiring antitumor therapy, the recent addition of monoclonal antibody therapy to combination chemotherapy has become standard of care .  For medically fit patients 
less than 65 years of age, the CLL8 trial b y the German CLL group demonstrated higher 
complete remission ( CR) rates, longer progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival ( OS) 
for patients randomized to fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab ( FCR ) chemotherapy 
compared to FC chemotherapy al one 
2.  In this trial, lower levels of minimal residual disease 
(MRD) as detect ed by [CONTACT_4133] [ADDRESS_592180] remission  and on the interim 
development of adverse genetic risk features such as 17p deletion .  For patients with long 
remissions (> 2 years), the initial treatment can often be repeated.  However, the response rate, depth and duration of remission are usually shorter  with subsequent therapy. Patients with short 
remissions after initial aggressive chemoimmunotherapy or who have developed fludarabine refractory disease (less than partial response ( PR) to therapy or relapse within 6-12 months ) have 
a poor prognosis with median OS of < 2 years and are candidates for aggressive treatments , 
including allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ).   
 Patients beyond first or second relapse are in need of novel experimental treatments.  
Curre nt approaches include the use of new agents targeting the B cell Ig receptor signaling 
pathway including PI3kinase-delta with GS -1101 (CAL-101) and the Brutons Tyrosine kinase 
(BTK) inhibitor, ibrutinib (PCI [ZIP_CODE]) 
4, 5.  Allogeneic HCT using HLA matched related or 
unrelated donors following non-myeloablative conditioning may provide a curative option, however there is significant risk of non relapse mortality of approximately 25% at 1 year due to 
 5 GVHD and/or infections 6.  The recent demonstration that adoptive T cell therapy  with 
autologous T cells engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor specific for CD19 in duced 
complete and sustained remissions in [ADDRESS_592181] demonstrated that the addition of rituximab to combination or single agent chemotherapy (CHOP, CVP or Bendamustine) results in longer PFS and in some trials prolonged OS 
11-13.  Following initial therapy, many patients are treated for up to 2-years with maintenance 
rituximab using a variety of schedules.  The PRIMA study in patients with follicular non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL ) demonstrated a decrease in the risk of progression at 2 years by 
50% by [CONTACT_87069], although there was no difference in OS 
14.   
 As in CLL, patients  with indolent lymphoma who relapse following initial therapy may 
be treated again with the same or similar regimen.  Patients with early relapse, or those who progress on rituximab maintenance are considered rituximab refractory.  There is no standard of 
care for the treatment of patients with relapsed indolent NHL, and the usual approaches include 
the use of agents singly or in combination that had not been given as initial therapy ( such as 
bendamus tine and rituximab in patients failing R -CVP or R-CHOP) , or more aggressive salvage 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_462433].  Unfortunately, these treatments are generally not curative.   
 P atients  with recurrent or progressive indolent lymphoma may be candidates for 
allogeneic HCT , which can result in long- term disease f ree survival 
15.  However, as in CLL, the 
treatment is dependent on the identification of an appropriate donor and is associated with significant risks of acute and chronic GVHD and infections.  For transplant eligible patients, the decision to proceed to transplantation is often a matter of personal choice of risk-vs-benefit.  
Patients without donors, those who are not transplant candidates , and those who elect not to 
undergo allogeneic HCT are in need of novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].   
  Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)  represents a chronic relapsing NHL with a more 
aggressive clinical course.  Current standard of care includes induction chemo-immun otherapy 
with regimens such as R -CHOP or HyperCVAD/Mtx/Ara-C 
16.  Patients with responsive disease 
are considered for high-dose therapy and autologous HCT as consolidation in first remission.  A study by [CONTACT_462458]-grade lymphoma group demonstrated improved PFS and OS with autologous HCT in first remission com pared with interferon maintenance therapy  
17, 18.  Data 
from the MD Anderson Cancer C enter suggest that patients receiving full course HyperCVAD 
may have similar outcomes without autologous HCT 16. Even with the use of autologous HCT, 
patients appear to remain at risk of relapse with no evidence of a plateau on the PFS curve.  Patients who relapse following autologous HCT, or those unable to receive autologous HCT 
 [ADDRESS_592182] common histolog ic type of lymphoma is diffuse large B cell (DLBCL), 
representing approximately 30% of the annual incidence of NHL.  In contrast to the indolent NHL’s , these lymphomas require immediate treatment with curative intent. The addition of anti -
CD20 antibody therapy with rituximab to standard CHOP chemotherapy has improved the outcome for patients with DLBC L 
20.  The goal of trea tment is to obtain a CR  as demonstrated 
by a negative positron emission tomography (PET) scan .  Current standards for patients with 
limited stage disease include a short course of R -CHOP followed by [CONTACT_462459] R-CHOP.   Patients with advanced stage disease usually receive [ADDRESS_592183] for those who respond to the salvage regimen .   High dose 
therapy with regimens such as BEAM or CY/TBI/VP-16 or BuMelTT can cure 20-50% of chemotherapy responsive patients and is considered the standard of care for patients responding to salvage chemotherapy who are medically fit for transplant. Unfortunately, patients who relapse early after primary therapy with a regimen containing rituximab, have a worse prognos is 
even with salvage high -dose therapy and autologous HCT 
21. 
 Patients who are unable to undergo autologous HCT or those who relapse following 
autologous HCT have a poor prognosis with a median survival of [ADDRESS_592184] for DLBCL is more limited,  perhaps because class I MHC is absent on a 
high proportion of DLBCL 23, and long-term survival is  achieved  in only 30-40% of patients who 
have minimal disease at the time of allogeneic HCT.  Thus, patients with relapsed aggressive lymphoma who have previously had an autologous HCT or those medically unable to receive autologous HCT have a poor prognosis and are in need of novel treatments.    
 
3D.  Adoptive T cell therapy for human malignancy  
The potential for T cells to eradicate human malignancies is illustrated by [CONTACT_389721] -
versus-leukemia effect of allogeneic T cells administered as part of a stem cell transplan t 24, 25; 
and in melanoma patients who receive in vitro expanded, autologous T cells derived from the 
tumor infiltrate and administered after lymphodepleting chemotherap y 26. These approaches  have 
antitumor efficacy, but have been associated with some toxicity related to recognition of normal cells that express the antigen(s) targeted by [CONTACT_462460] T cells. Patients that receive allogeneic HCT or donor lymphocyte infusions often develop graft-versus-host disease as a consequence of 
donor T cell recognition of epi[INVESTIGATOR_462434] H antigens  
27, and melanoma 
patients treated with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) may develop vitiligo  due to 
recognition of normal melanocytes 26.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_462435], T cell therapy has cured a 
 7 subset of patients with advanced malignancy that was resistant to conventional chemo therapy 
and/or radiotherapy 26, 27. 
 
3E.  Transfer of tumor targeting receptors into T cells to confer tumor -specificity  
An obstacle for applying T cell therapy more broadly is the difficulty isolating tumor 
reactive T cells from patients with cancer. An approach to overcome th e low frequency of tumor-
reactive T cells in patients is to redirect the specificity of T cells by [CONTACT_462461] a transgene that 
encodes a receptor specific for a tumor -associated antigen  (TAA) . Vector systems to deliver 
transgenes into primary human T cells have been developed and clinical trials in which autologous T cells are modified to express a tumor -reactive T cell receptor (TCR) have been 
initiated with transient clinical  responses 
28, 29. However, redirecting T cells to recognize tumor 
antigens through TCR gene transfer is inherently constrained because of the requirement for major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) restricted peptide presentation by [CONTACT_20405], and 
because many tumors  including DLBCL express low levels of MHC molecules to avoid T cell 
recognition 
23.  
An alternative method for targeting T cells to tumor cells is to express an artificial 
chimeric non -MHC restricted  antigen  receptor (CAR) that recognizes a tumor cell surface 
molecule 30, 31. A CAR is typi[INVESTIGATOR_278528] a fusion gene that encodes a monoclonal 
antibody-derived single chain variable fragment (scFv), consisting of heavy (V H) and light (V L) 
chains joined by a flexible linker, and then fused through a transmembrane domain to a 
cytoplasmic signaling moiety consisting of CD3 ζ alone, or CD3ζ  combined with activation 
domains from costimulatory molecules such as CD28, 4-1BB or OX40 31, 32. CARs with 
specificity for tumor cell -surface epi[INVESTIGATOR_462436] “universal” in that they bind antigen in an HLA 
independent fashion, and one receptor construct can be used to treat all patients with tumors that 
express the molecule targeted by [CONTACT_419530].  T cells obtained from the blood of cancer patients can 
be modified with CARs to generate a nti-tumor effector cells (CAR -T cells) for adoptive therapy  
that can recognize tumor cells that have downregulated HLA molecules , thereby [CONTACT_462462] -restricted tumor -reactive T cells . CARs have been constructed for many 
tumor-associated cell surface molecules including CD19, CD20, EGFR, Her2neu, GD2, PSMA, mesothelin, CAIX and ROR1 
31-36. In vitro studies have demonstrated that both CD4+ and CD8+ 
T cell effector functions can be triggered via CARs, and studies in animal models and in small numbers of patients have demonstrated the capacity of adoptively transferred CAR- T cells to 
eradicate established tumo rs 
7, 8, 37, 38. 
 
3F.  Rationale for targeting CD19 on B cell malignancies with CAR-T cells   
Efforts to target B cell malignancies with CAR -T cells have focused predominantly on 
introducing receptors that recognize surface molecules such as CD19 and CD20 that are restricted in their expression to the B cell lineage. CD20 is present on B cell lymphomas and CLL, and has been targeted effectively with rituximab 
39, 40. However, rituximab is now routinely 
administered to most patients with B cell malignancies and the presence of antibody bound to CD20 can block target recognition by T cells engineered to express a CD20 -specific CAR. CD19 
is a type I transmembrane protein that associates with CD21, TAPA -1, and Leu13 to form a 
signal transduction complex that participates in regulating B cell proliferation  
41. CD19 is 
expressed on all human B cells beginning from the initial lineage commitment until terminal different iation into plasma cells, and is expressed homogeneously on  B cell CLL, indolent and 
mantle cell lymphoma, and  DLBCL. Importantly, CD19 is not expressed on any normal tissue 
 [ADDRESS_592185] epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130] 
42.  T cells specific for CD171 (L1CAM) were administered to 
patients  with neuroblastoma without toxicity  43. However, in each of these studies, T cell 
persistence was poor and sustained antitumor effects were not observed.  
Patients with advanced B -cell malignancies have also been treated with first generation 
CARs that were specific for CD20 or CD19. These patients experienced little or no toxicity, but the CAR-T cells persisted poorly and sustained antitumor efficacy was not observed  
28, 44. The 
suboptimal results in these initial trials may reflec t several factors including  the absence of 
signaling domains to provide costimulation necessary for sustained T cell proliferation and survival in first generation CARs; the methods used to engineer and expand T cells for adoptive transfer that required long term culture and favored infusing terminally differentiated effector cells; and the variability in phenotype of the starting population, which can  influence the 
capacity of T cells to persist and function long term in vivo  
44-48.  
To overcome the limitations identified in the initial trials  and e nhance potency , 
costimulatory endodomains were added to CD3 ζ to enhance signaling through the CAR 7, 8, 49-51, 
and improved methods for selecting and transducing T cells of defined phenotype have been developed that do not require long- term culture 
7, 8.The antitumor efficacy of T cells engineered 
to express a CD19-specific CAR and derivatives that include CD28 and/or [ADDRESS_592186] been superior to those that do not 49, 52 (Hudecek M, 
Riddell SR, unpublished data). Moreover, potent and sustained antitumor activity has been observed in a small number of patients with CLL and NHL treated with autologous CD19 CAR-T cells that include either a [ADDRESS_592187] impressive 
antitumor responses were observed in patients that did not receive IL-2 
7. The major toxicities of 
CAR -T cells include cytokine release and tumor lysis syndromes that occurred approximately 2 
weeks after infusion of CD19 CAR-T cells, and persistent depletion of normal CD19+ B cells, 
necessitating intravenous immunoglobulin treatment.  There was no o bvious correlation between 
efficacy, toxicity, T cell persistence and the  T cell dose administered to patients  in these initial 
trials  7, 8, 51, 53. The inconsistency in the behavior of the therapeutic products may be because 
polyclonal T cells from the patient were transduced to express the CAR, and the resulting cell products administered to each patient varied greatly in phenotypic composition (CD4, CD8) and subset derivation.  
3H.  Lymphodepleting chemotherapy improves persistence of transferre d T cells  
Clinical trials of T cell therapy for melanoma at the National Cancer Institute 
demonstrated that administering lymphodepleting chemotherapy such as fludarabine and 
 [ADDRESS_592188] to homeostatic regulation, 
and the induction of lymphopenia results in less competition for cytokines such as IL-15 and IL-7 that promote lymphocyte proliferation and survival, and leads to the proliferation of residual T cells including those that are adoptively transferred . Lymphodepleting chemotherapy may also 
eliminate CD4
+ CD25+ regulatory T cells, and activate antigen  presenting cells that may promote 
the function of transferred T cells. Studies in murine models subsequently confirmed the human data that lymphodepletion improves the persistence and  antit umor efficacy of transferred T
E cells  
56.  
 
3I.  Heterogeneity of T cell products in clinical adoptive transfer studies 
 Clinical trials of genetically modified T cells have typi[INVESTIGATOR_462437]. The T cel l 
pool is characterized by [CONTACT_462463], and this is further altered by [CONTACT_462464]. T cells can be broadly divided into CD45RA
+ 
antigen inexperienced naïve T cells (T N) that express CD62L+ and CCR7+ to enable their transit 
through lymph nodes where they survey for foreign antigens; and CD45RO+ memory T cells that 
have clonally expanded in response to prior antigen encounter, and can be subdivided into CD62L
+ central memory (T CM) and effector memory (T EM) subsets 57.  A subset of memory T 
cells that is intermediate between that naïve and memory cells has  also been described, and 
suggested to represent a “memory stem cell” based on the ability to self -renew, and give rise to 
effector (T E), and T CM and T EM subsets 58. As a consequence of heterogeneity in the distribution 
of T cell subsets in  the blood of different individuals, particularly cancer patients who may have 
had markedly different exposures with prior chemotherapy, the composition of T cell products obtained after gene transfer is often dramatically different, and the consequences of this variability for interpreting, cell persistence, and the toxicity and efficacy  of infused T cell 
products are not known.    
3J.  Rationale for deriving CAR-T cell products from defined T cell subsets  
It is possible to generate genetically modified T cells from a defined starting population 
of T cells that are enriched from PBMC based on the expression of distinct cell surface markers that define their lineage and differentiation. Studies in animal models including immunodeficient mice that were  administered human CD8
+ T cells s howed that cells from defined subsets have 
markedly different capacity to survive and function in vivo 45, 59. For example, effector CD8+ T 
cells derived from purified T CM have been shown to persist long term in vivo, migrate to memory 
cell niches in the bone marrow and lymph nodes, and establish functional populations of T CM and 
TEM [45] . Studies from our group have also d emonstrated that human CD4+ T cells modified with 
a CAR enhance the proliferation of CD8+ CAR -T cells  derived from T CM in response to tumor 
cells (Hudecek M, Riddell SR, unpublished data). These results suggest that preparing CAR T 
cells from purified CD8+ TCM and CD4+ T cells and combining these subsets to achieve a defined 
product composition may provide a more reproducible  safety profile of transferred T cells and 
improve therapeutic efficacy.  
    
 10 3K.   Development of a self -inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vector encoding a CD19 -specific 
CAR  
We have constructed a CD19-specific CAR consisting of an scFv derived from the 
murine IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) FMC63. The scFV is fused to the human IgG4 hinge 
region and the human 4-1BB costimulatory domain in tandem with CD3 ζ (Figure 1). The 
construct also encodes a truncated 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (tEGFR) downstream of a T2A sequence to provide coordinate expression of tEGFR, which can       serve 
both as a marker for cell selection and 
for tracking transduced T cells in vivo 
60. We have compared the activity of 
different CD19 CARs in vitro and in vivo 
using murine xenograft models, and found that the CD19 CAR containing 4-1BB as a co-stimulatory domain exerts superior antitumor activity compared with a CD19 CAR that contains an IgG4 hinge and CH2-CH3 spacer with CD28 as the costimulatory domain. This data is consistent with uncontrolled results of other groups in which a small number of patients have been treated with CD19 CAR-T cells containing CD28 or 4-1BB costimulatory domains 
7, 8, 50, 51, 
53. Based on the practical and theoretical advantages of lentiviral vectors, a SIN lentiviral vector  
([ZRX-014-LV provided by [CONTACT_462465], Inc), Seattle]  that encodes the CD19 -4-1BB-
CD3ζ-tEGFR CAR under transcriptional control of the elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1α ) 
promoter was produced under GMP conditions, and the virus supernatant subjected to quality control analysis for clinical applications.  Exposu re of primary human T cells to CD19-4-1BB-
CD3ζ-tEGFR SIN lentiviral vector results in efficient transduction and expression of the CAR 
and tEGFR, and confers recognition of CD19
+ target cells including primary CLL, and mantle 
cell and large cell lymphoma cell lines.  
 
3L.  Safety considerations for adoptive therapy with genetically modified T cells  
 There are several potential toxicities of adoptive therapy with CD19 CAR -T cells.  The 
first potential toxicity is particular to targeting  cells that express th e CD19 molecule, as re-
directed T cells  will recognize and eliminate non-malignant CD19+ B-cells, potentially resulting 
in a long-term B -cell immunodeficiency  7, 8, 50, 51, 53. Prolonged suppression of normal B cells in 
patients receiving rituximab therapy is common and does not appear to result in significant complications, providing immunoglobul in levels are maintained by [CONTACT_462466]  
61. Thus, in 
patients with advanced B cell malignancies that have failed conventional chemotherapy  and 
already have a B -cell deficiency from rituximab therapy, B-cell lymphopenia may be an 
acceptable side effect of T cell therapy if it is accompanied by a significant antitumor effect.  
 A second potential toxicity relates to the possibility of transformation of the adoptively 
transferred gene-modified T cells as a consequence of insertional mutagenesis. The development of T cell leukemia has been reported in a subset of patients on two gene therapy trials for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency sy ndrome (SCID), in which bone marrow derived 
CD34 cells were transduced with a retroviral vector encoding the common cytokine receptor gamma chain 
62-66. Currently, five cases of T cell leukemia res ulting from retroviral insertional 
mutagenesis have been described after successful correction of X -linked SCID. Four of the cases 
were associated with activation of the LMO2 oncogene 62-66. Animal studies have shown that  
Figure 1. Schematic design of the CD19 CAR with a  
short (hinge only) extracellular spacer domain.  

 11 mature T cells are resistant to transformation after retroviral integration  67, and leukemia has 
never been observed  in clinical trials involving gene transfer into mature T cells, despi[INVESTIGATOR_462438] 10 years of follow-up in some studies. Our study differs from the X-linked SCID trial in 
several important aspects: (a) we will use a lentiviral vector and not a retrovirus to genetically modify cells, which reduces the risk of integrating into a transcriptionally active site; (b) the target of the genetic modification will be a mature T cell and not hematopoietic progenitor cells; and (c) the genetically modified CD19 -specific T cells do not constitutively express a functional 
growth factor receptor as was the case with transduced cells in the X -linked SCID trial.  
 A third potential toxicity is that CD19 CAR -T cells might cause cytokine release after 
engagement of target cells or induce rapid tumor cell death resulting in a tumor lysis syndrome. Both cytokine release and tumor lysis syndromes have been observed in small clinical trials of 
CD19 CAR-T cell therapy in patients with high tumor burdens , but there has not been a clear 
correlation with T cell dose, with tumor burden or with the costimulatory domain in the CAR 
7, 
51. We anticipate that toxicity from cytokine release may be more predictable with T cell 
products of a defined composition. In this trial we will use a dose escalation of CAR-T cells that consist of a 1:1 mix of CD8
+ TCM and CD4+ T cells in cohorts of patients  to determine if a T cell 
dose can be defined that provides acceptable toxicity, long-term persistence, and reproducible depletion of CD19
+ B cells. To minimize the risk of tumor lysis syndrome, we plan to  administer 
standard chemotherapy prior to the T cell infusion to reduce tumor burden and induce lymphopenia to improve T cell persistence.   
3M.  Overview of the Study  
 This is a Phase 1/2, open -label, nonrandomized study t hat will  evaluate the safety and 
potential antitumor activity of adoptively transferring autologous CD19 CAR-T cells transduced with a lentiviral vector to express a CD19 -specific CAR  to patients with advanced CD19
+ B cell 
malignancies. To provide for greater reproducibility of T cell products and to facilitate safety and efficacy evaluation, we will enrich CD8
+ TCM and CD4+ T cells  separately  from the leukapheresis 
product or blood of each patient, transduce and expand each cell subset with the CD19 CAR lentivirus  independently, and pool T cells in a 1:[ADDRESS_592189] of two stages  – an initial dose escalation/de- escalation 
stage to  define a cell dose that has acceptable toxicity, and then an analysis of the safety of that 
cell dose in expanded cohorts of up to 45 patients each with ALL and NHL and up to 15 patients 
with CLL.   
 
3N.      Modification to extend Stage 1 of the trial :   
 
1. Analysis of disease specific cohorts for determination of optimal dose for ALL, NHL 
and CLL.   
Experience from the initial [ADDRESS_592190] had toxicity attributed 
to CD19 CAR -T cell therapy that has required dose de-escalation per protocol guidelines. 
Two patients with high tumor burden ALL (≥  15% bone marrow involvement) had dose 
limiting toxicity (one transient CNS toxicity and one patient death from cytokine storm ) 
at dose level 3.  In contrast, none of the 5 (2 at dose level 1 and 3 at dose level 2) patients 
 12 treated with low tumor burden ALL (< 15% bone marrow involvem ent at pre treatment 
evaluation) had dose limiting toxicity. After discussions with the FDA we propose to 
extend the Stage [ADDRESS_592191] to the experience in ALL, none of the 9 patients with NHL/CLL treated at any of the dose levels ( 2 at dos e level 1, 4 at dose level 2 , and 3 at dose level 3)  experienced a 
dose limiting toxicity  regardless of their tumor burden (marrow or nodal disease); 
therefore, we will not  separate NHL/CLL patients into disease burden cohorts, but will 
evaluate NHL and CLL patients in  separate disease-specific stage 1 cohorts.   
 Stage 1 will be extended to further examine dosing in disease specific cohorts outlined in 3N.1.a and the results used to identify a cell dose for Stage 2 evaluation to determine 
safety and efficacy in larger disease/ patient specific cohorts , as described  in 3N.2.a.  
Each of the Stage 1 cohorts will follow  the dose escalation and de- escalation rules based 
on dose limiting toxicities as defined in 14C.1.b .  
 
a. Stage 1 cohorts:   
 
A) ALL -High tumor burden defined as ≥  15% ALL in bone marrow at staging prior 
to treatment.  Treatment will start at Dose level [ADDRESS_592192] of 3-18 
patients.   
 B) ALL: Low tumor burden  defined as < 15% ALL in bone marrow at staging prior 
to treatment.  Treatment will start at Dose level [ADDRESS_592193] of up to 3-12 
patients; however, we have seen no dose- limiting  toxicity in ALL patients with low 
tumor burde n and do not anticipate that enrollment on this cohort will be prolonged  
before proceeding to stage 2.   C) NHL : Patients will be initially treated at Dose level [ADDRESS_592194] 
of up to 3-12 patients; however, we have seen no dose-limiting  toxicity in  the 9  NHL 
patients  previously treated, and do not anticipate that enrollment on this cohort will be 
prolonged before proceeding to stage 2.  D) CLL : We have limited experience with the treatment of patients with CLL. Based 
on the differences observed in ALL and NHL, we propose to formally examine dosing in a cohort of patients with CLL to determine the optimal dose for Stage 2. Treatment will start at Dose l evel [ADDRESS_592195] of up to 3-12 patients; 
however, we have seen no dose-limiting  toxicity in patients with low grade NHL and 
with concurrent DLBCL/SLL and do not anticipate that enrollment on this cohort will be prolonged. 
 13  2. Modification of Stage 2 cohorts:  
  
At the completion of the Stage 1 dose finding in disease specific cohorts, the identified 
dose/s will be used for treatment of patients in the specific Stage 2 cohorts.  Stage 2 for a 
given cohort/disease may begin immediately on identification of the optimal dose from the Stage 1 cohorts.  
a. Stage 2 cohorts:   
 
A) ALL patients with low (< 20% marrow disease) or high ( ≥ 20% marrow disease or 
bulky extramedullar disease) are eligible, n= 45. 
 B) Non Hodgkin Lymphoma.  All histologies expressing CD19 are eligible including Diffuse Large B cell, Follicular, Marginal cell, Mantle cell or other histologies , n=45. 
 C) CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma, n=15  
 
3O.  Modification to Refine D ose in NHL and CLL (following Cy/Flu lymphodepletion) 
 
1.  DL3 was selected for Stage 2 for patients with NHL based on no DLT in 3 patients treated in Stage 1.  However, poor CAR-T cell persistence and expansion were observed in part due to the development of immune responses to the CAR modified T cells.  The use of Cy/Flu for lymphodepletion improved CAR-T cell expansion and persistence and clinical response rate, but was unexpectedly associated with greater toxicity at DL3 in NHL patients.  While protocol sto ppi[INVESTIGATOR_004] (see section 14C2) were not met, there were 
[ADDRESS_592196] been treated (4 DL2, 1 DL3) in Stage 1.  However we observed a DLT at dose level 3 in a patient with Cy/Flu conditioning so we  will also 
return to dose escalate patients with CLL from DL1  prior to starting Stage 2 for this 
cohort.    
3P.  Planned Dose Dense Cohort Expansion for NHL: 
DL2 was found to be well tolerated and selected following dose refinement as discussed in section 3O with the use of Cy/Flu lymphodepletion and will be used for the completion of Stage [ADDRESS_592197] 
experience with second CAR -T cell infusions following Cy/Flu lymphodepletion to date 
in [ADDRESS_592198] levels and clinical activity  
with minimal increased toxicity .  Three of these four patients had evidence of additional 
anti-tumor activity.  Upon completion of Stage 2 for NHL we propose to evaluate an earlier sequential dosing strategy aimed to increase the peak levels and persistence of t he 
CAR -T cells.  Patients will receive a planned  second infusion at DL2 
(2x106 EGFR+ 
cells/kg ) of CAR-T cells between day [ADDRESS_592199] infusion without  
additional lymphodepletion and after initial toxicity including CRS and neurotoxicity has abated. Up to 20 patients will be treated.  
 
3Q.  Dose Revision for Low- Tumor Burden ALL for the remainder of Stage 2: 
Following treatment of 17 patients with low -tumor burden ALL (<20% bone marrow 
involvement) the protocol is being modified after discussions with the FDA to treat these patients at a lower initial CAR -T cell dose, Dose Level 1 (2 x 10
5/kg).  This was in 
response to the death of a patient due to severe neurotoxicity and CRS.  Following this modification, all  subsequent ALL patients (all tumo r burdens) will receive D ose L evel 
one (2 x 10
5 EGFRt+ cells/kg).   
 
3R. Dose Revision for Low-Tumor Burden ALL for expanded Stage 2: After the 
administration of the lower dose described in section 3Q, 3 of 5 patients (60%) with ≤10% marrow blasts who received Cy/Flu lymphodepletion and DL1 (2 x 10
5 EGFRt+ 
cells/kg) failed to achieve CR. In contrast 6 of 6 patients (100%) with ≤10% marrow blasts who received Cy/Flu lymphodepletion and DL2 (2 x 10
6 EGFRt+ cells/kg) prior to 
the dose reduction in section 3Q achieved CR without excessive toxicity attributed to CAR -T cell infusion. We propose an increase in CAR -T cell dose for patients with ≤5%  
marrow blasts, such that they receive CAR -T cells at DL2 (2 x 10
6 EGFRt+ cells/kg).   
 3S. Cohort expansion for CLL patients with concurrent Ibrutinib: In Stage [ADDRESS_592200] (ASH CLL reference) .  This often resulted in less than complete remissions.  In our study to date, the 
majority of patients have been previously treated with ibrutinib , but stopped the drug 
prior to T cell collection and were  off of the drug during therapy.  Discontinuation of 
ibrutinib is often associated with significant disease progression  and the rapid 
reoccurrence of bulky lymphadenopathy, while treatment with ibrutinib often rapi[INVESTIGATOR_462439]
70.  
In addition, recent data  suggest that the quality of T cells collected from patients who are 
on ibrutinib may be better for the manufactur ing of CAR -T cells and for the function of 
the CAR-T cells when used to treat CLL patients71. Further, ibrutinib may have 
additional activity by [CONTACT_462467] (either by [CONTACT_462468] T cells or by [CONTACT_462469] e or inflam mation  that can occur upon 
discontinuation of ibrutinib).  Lastly, multiple ongoing clinical trials support the ability to 
administer ibrutinib safely concurrently with chemotherapy including fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab
72.  All o f these observations support the continuation of 
ibrutinib for CLL patients considering treatment with CD19 specific CAR -T cells  rather 
than stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_462440]-T cell therapy.   
 [ADDRESS_592201] of two cohorts of patients - cohort 1 (n=5-15) : those 
who are continuing on ibrutinib, but with significant residual disease, and  cohort 2 (n=5 -
15): those who have previously failed ibrutinib in the past and who are now on subsequent treatments.  Both cohorts will be treated with ibrutinib  (continue or restart) 
for at least 2 weeks prior to leukapheresis and will continue on ibrutinib for up to 3 months after  the proceeding CAR -T cell infusion.  Ibrutinib dosing will be per the FDA 
label for patients with CLL. Patients who required dose reduction of ibrutinib for toxicity will continue or resume at the reduced dose of ibrutinib that was tolerated.  We will continue with the current Stage 2 CAR -T cell dosing for CLL  at DL2 (2 x 10
6 EFGRt+ 
cells/kg).  We will evaluate toxicity and response rates and compare them to our earlier 
experience.  This data will be used for the development of a multicenter CLL trial.  
 
3T. Special Consideration for Patients Previously Leukapheresed  but NOT Treated.   
Over the conduct of this clinical trial,  several patients with a variety of CD19 positive B 
cell malignancies were eligible for  and underwent leukapheresis and had CAR- T cell 
products manufactured and cryopreserved, but were unable or not eligible to receive  
their CAR T cell treatment during the conduct of the Stage [ADDRESS_592202] 
of this trial (m aximum of 12 months) from the treatment of the last patient.  
 4. OBJECTIVES 
4A.  Primary objectives  
1. To  evaluate the feasibility and safety of adoptive T cell therapy using ex vivo  expanded 
autologous CD8+ and CD4+ CD19 CAR-T cells for patients with advanced CD19+ B cell 
malignancies.  
 
4B.  Secondary objectives  
1. To determine the duration of in vivo  persist ence of adoptively transferred T cells, and 
the phenotype of persisting T cells . 
 
2. To determine if adoptively transferred T cells  traffic to the bone marrow and function 
in vivo . 
 
3. To determine if the adoptive transfer of CD19 CAR-T cells results in depletion of CD19
+ B cells in vivo  as a surrogate for functional activity. 
 
 [ADDRESS_592203] a high risk of progression of disease may be screened and undergo l eukapheresis. Enrollment for T cell therapy 
would require meeting the full disease state eligibility.  
 
2.  Confirmation of diagnosis  
 17 3.  Evidence of CD19 expression by [CONTACT_462470]19 expression based on 
disease histology.  
 4.  Karnofsky performance status ≥  60% ( Appendix B ) 
 5.  All patients of childbearing potential must be willing to use a contraceptive method 
before, during, and for at least two months after the T cell infusion.  
 6.  Ability to understand and provide informed consent. 
 
5C.  Exclusions for CAR-T cell Therapy  
1. Patients r equiring ongoing daily corticosteroid therapy at a dose of >15 mg of 
prednisone per day (or equivalent) . Pulsed corticosteroid use for disease control is 
acceptable.  
2. Active autoimmune disease requiring immunosuppressive therapy  is excluded unless 
discussed with the PI . 
3. Major organ dysfunction defined as: a. Serum creatinine > 2.5 mg/dL b. Significant hepatic dysfunction (SGOT > 5x upper limit of normal;      bilirubin > 3.0 mg/dL) c. Patients with clinically significant pulmonary dysfunction, as determined by [CONTACT_462471] . Those with an FEV1 of < 50 % of predicted or DL
CO (corrected) < 40% will 
be excluded.  
d. Significant cardiovascular abnormalities as defined by [CONTACT_54747]: NYHA class III or IV congestive heart failure, clinically significant hypotension, uncontrolled symptomatic coronary artery disease, or a documented ejection fraction of <35%. 
4.   Uncontrolled active infection .  
 
6. EVALUATION AND COUNSELING OF PATIENT  Patients will be seen at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance or the Fred Hutchinson Cancer 
Research Center (FHCRC) for consideration of treatment options for their disease. The protocol will be discussed thoroughly with the patient and other family members if appropriate, and all known and potential risks to the patient will be described. The procedure and alternative forms of therapy will be presented as objectively as possible, and the risks and hazards of the procedure explained to the patient. Consent from the patient will be obtained using forms approved by [CONTACT_4707] (IRB) of the FHCRC. A summary of the clinic visit detailing what was covered will be dictated for the medical record.  
  7. PROTOCOL REGISTR ATION  
 Eligible subjects will be identified and registered into the system by [CONTACT_462472] (CCO) (Intake Office) and assigned a UPN (Unique Patient Number). The CCO will register the subject on to the protocol through the Data Management Office.  
 18 Patients are initially screened and undergo an apheresis procedure. Enrollment to the 
therapy portion of the study occurs at the conclusion of the pre T cell work up when data is 
reviewed for all inclusion and exclusion criteria by [CONTACT_462473] A.  
 
8. STUDY AGENT  
 
8A. CD19 CAR-T cells  
1. The methods employed to derive CD19 CAR-T cells  from the patient’s CD8+ and 
CD4+ T cells enriched from PBMC, and release tests of the cell products prior to infusion are 
outlined in the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (CMC ) section of the Investigational 
New Drug (IND) application to the FDA . Modifications to the CMC section during the course 
of the study must be submitted for FDA review. 
 2. The autologous T cell product will be prepared and administered to the patient by 
[CONTACT_5204]. Patients will be pretreated with lymphodepleting chemotherapy and receive 
the T cell infusions 36-96 hours after completing chemotherapy (Section 9.B).  
 3. A schematic of the modified treatment plan including expanded stage 1 and 2 cohorts 
is shown in Figure 2. 
      
9. PLAN 
OF 
TREATMENT   
9A. CLL patients will be treated with ibrutinib (continue or restart) for at least 2 weeks prior to leukapheresis and will continue on ibrutinib for up to 3 months after CAR-T cell infusion.  Ibrutinib dosing will be per the FDA label for patients with CLL , except as 
noted above where patients with prior dose reductions for toxicity, will continue or  
CLL with concurrent ibrutinib: (n = 20) 
 

 19 resume the tolerated dose.  Otherwise, patients will receive treatment at 420 mg daily (3 
tablets), unless toxicity requires dose reductions or discontinuation of therapy as outlined 
in section 10.F 
 
9.B. L eukapheresis  or blood-draw to obtain T cells  for CD19 CAR-T cell manufacturing  
1. A leukapheres is will be performed on each patient by [CONTACT_462474]. Should a technical issue arise during the procedure or in the processing of the product, or insufficient CD19 CAR-T cells be manufactured for the prescribed CD19 
CAR -T cell dose, a second procedure may be performed.  
 Patients ineligible for a vein to vein apheresis may elect to have a percutaneous central venous access  catheter inserted to support this collection.  
 
Patients ineligible for leukapheresis and who have a hematocrit of >38 and a total 
non-malignant (normal) lymphocyte count of >[ADDRESS_592204] will be delivered to the Cell Processing Facility (CPF) at the FHCRC or the Cell Therapy Laboratory (CTL) at the SCCA. Cell selection may be performed in the FHCRC CPF or SCCA CTL. PBMC not required for cell selections may be archived for research.  If lymphocyte subset counts are considered adequate, the product will be divided into two aliquots. One aliquot will be enriched for CD8
+ TCM cells and the second aliquot 
will be enriched  for CD4+ T cells using clinical grade reagents and SOPs developed at 
the FHCRC/SCCA. Subsequent processing, after selection of CD4+ and CD8+ TCM 
cells and cryopreservation (if required), is performed in the FHCRC CPF. If processing of CD8
+ TCM and CD4+ cells is not considered suitable due to 
lymphopenia, low CD8+ TCM and CD4+ cell counts or other reasons, we may use 
other strategies to select and manufacture CD19 CAR-T cells that are approved for use in this protocol by [CONTACT_1622]. 
 
3. Quality control and release testing will be performed on the CD19 CAR-T cell product prior to its release for patient infusion .  
 
9C. Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy  
1. Prior to the first infusion of CD19 CAR-T cells, the patients will receive 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy that is appropriate for their underlying disease as 
determined by [CONTACT_462475] (PI ). The objectives of administering  chemotherapy are to reduce the 
tumor burden prior to infusion of CD19 CAR-T cells and to provide lymphodepletion to facilitate T cell survival.   
 
2. Refer to Appendix A  for suggested chemotherapy regimens based on disease cohort.  
For Stage 2, unless the clinical situation dictates changes, the preferred regimen will be with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide.  
 20 9D.  Clinical and/or Laboratory Exclusion Criteria for T Cell I nfusions 
1. CD19 CAR-T cells should be administered  between [ADDRESS_592205] 
one or more of the following exclusion criteria: 
• Pulmonary – Patients requiring mechanical ventilation  
• Cardiovascular – Patients requiring pressor support  
• Renal function – Patients with rapi[INVESTIGATOR_462441] ; unless due to 
malignancy.  
• Hepatic function – Patients with an elevated total bilirubin of >3.9 or 
transaminases of >  5x the upper limit  of normal values unless due to malignancy  
• Neurologic – Patients with encephalopathy or new focal neurologic deficits  unless 
due to malignancy  
• Uncontrolled, active and serious infection. 
• Treatment with other investigational agent(s) within [ADDRESS_592206] be met for each T cell infusion in patients who are eligible to receive more than one T cell infusion.  
 
3. Patients with one or more exclusion criteria in Section 9C.1 above may be eligible to 
receive a T cell infusion with or without chemotherapy at a later time if they 
subsequently resolve the clinical and/or laboratory abnormalities. 
 
9E. Infusions of CD19 CAR-T cells   
 
1. Stage 1: Identification of a cell dose for evaluation in expanded cohorts:  In Stage 1, 
cohorts of three or more patients will receive a single intravenous infusion of CD19 
CAR -T cells at one of three escalating dose levels beginning with dose level 1. Dose 
escalation or de-escalation is determined by [CONTACT_462476], as described in Section 14C.1. 
 
Dose level 0:   up to 2x104 EGFR+ cells/kg  
Dose level 1 :  up to 2x105 EGFR+ cells/kg  (Starting dose level)  
Dose level 2 :  up to 2x106 EGFR+ cells/kg  
Dose level 3 :  up to 2x107 EGFR+ cells/kg  
 
The weight used for cell dose determination is the current weight in kg as documented on the 
clinical anthropometry report . 
 
Treatment of patients in the dose -escalation /de-escalation  cohorts will be staggered 
with a minimum of a 14-day interval following infusion between each patient within 
each disease  cohort.  
 
2. Stage 2. Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of a single dose of CD19 CAR-T cells in 
an expanded cohort  stratified by [CONTACT_462477]:   
After the toxicity  data has been obtained from each dose escalation cohort  in Stage [ADDRESS_592207] dose 
level established to be safe. See section 3O for dose re-escalation in Stage 2.  The 
objective of Stage 2  is to derive data on safety  of a single dose of CD19 CAR-T cells 
of a defined composition and an estimate of antitumor activity  in patients with 1) ALL  
(both high and low tumor burden treated at the corresponding doses re-defined  in stage 2, 2) NHL , and 3) CLL
 with and without concurrent ibrutinib therapy. 
 
3.   Cell administration.  Individual aliquots of CD4+ and CD8+ CD19 CAR-T cells will be 
prepared for each T cell infusion according to protocols established in the GMP Cell Processing Facility and formulated to provide a single cell product at the specified cell dose. The specified T cell dose refers to CAR
+ T cells determined by [CONTACT_462478], which is expressed coordinately with the CAR in the vector. Each T cell infusion should be administered intravenously over approximately 20 – [ADDRESS_592208] that contains approximately 50% (+/- 15%) of CD19 CAR-modified CD4
+ T cells and CD8+ T cell s (i.e. CAR-modified T 
cells in 1:1 CD4+/CD8+ ratio) . If a T cell product cannot be formulated to meet this  
target cell dose specification because of low transduction efficiency, suboptimal growth of one of the subsets, or failure of either the CD4
+ or CD8+ T cell product to 
meet release criteria, the  cell product should be infused at or as close as possible to  the 
specified phenotype allocation and total T cell dose.  In the Stage [ADDRESS_592209] will be added to the cohort . In Stage 2, 
such patients will be included in analysis of each patient/tumor histologic cohort.  
 
5.   Retreatment of patients on the study . Patients enrolled in either stage of the study may 
be eligible to receive another  CD19 CAR-T cell infusion with or without additional 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy at the same  (for those that received the highest cell 
dose) or up to the next highest dose level if  adequate CD19 CAR-T cells can be 
produced and the following criteria are met : 
i) There is evidence of persistent/relapsed  disease at any time after the previous T cell 
infusion.  ii) There w ere no toxicities attributed to the prior infusion/s  that were dose-limiting or 
required dose de-escalation ( Section 14.C.1).  
iii) The patient is ≥ 21 days from the previous T cell infusion .  
iv) T here are no clinical and/or laboratory exclusion criteria (Section 9C.1). 
6.   Planned Dose Dense Cohort Expansion for NHL.  P atients enrolled in this cohort will 
be accrued following the completion of stage 2 for NHL.  An additional cohort of up to 20 patients will receive a planned second CD19 CAR -T cell infusion without 
additional lymphodepleting chemotherapy at the same dose level if adequate CD19 CAR -T cells can be produced and the following criteria are met:  
a. There were no toxicities attributed to t he first infusion that were dose-limiting 
or required dose de-escalation (Section 14.C.1) 
b. The patient is [ADDRESS_592210] CAR-T cell infusion.  
 22 c. There are no clinical and/or laboratory exclusion criteria (Section 9C.1).  
d. Afebrile for greater than [ADDRESS_592211] be resolved to less than 
or equal to grade 1.  
 
7.   Patient monitoring during T cell infusions. All patients will be monitored  during each 
T cell infusion  with  vital signs and O 2 saturation being monitored and recorded at the 
following approximate time points: before, [ADDRESS_592212] been observed  with T cell infusions.   
 
Examples of potential symptoms and signs  due to T cell infusions and their initial management 
are listed below:
 
 1.  Fever, chills, and temperature elevations >38.3°C may be manag ed with 
acetaminophen [ADDRESS_592213] a blood culture drawn. 
 2.  Headache may be managed with acetaminophen.  
 3.  Nausea, vomiting may be managed with diphenhydramine 25-50 mg IV or other 
antiem etics (excluding corticosteroids) . 
 4.  Hypotension should be managed initially by [CONTACT_462479].  
 5.  Hypoxemia should be managed initially with supplemental oxygen.  
 
If the following signs appear during T cell infusion, the infusion should be paused and the patient assessed. If after , assessment by [CONTACT_978]/designee the patient’s condition is stable then the infusion 
may be resumed .   
   Systolic BP < 80 mmHg AND > 30 mm Hg fall from baseline  
Heart rate > 140/min AND increase from baseline > 40/min (confirmed by [CONTACT_462480]) 
   Respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] > 35/min AND increase from baseline of > 10/min   
   Arterial O
2 saturation < 88%  on air AND fall from baseline > 5%  
 
 23 If a T cell infusion is terminated due to acute toxicity, the residual T cells should be returned to 
the Turtle Lab for analysis. Investigation of possible causes of observed signs should proceed and, if necessary, additional medical treatment will be instituted . 
 Patients requiring discontinuation of T cell infusion may be eligible for re- treatment if the cause 
is deemed not related to the T cell infusion.   
10B. Management of cytokine release syndrome 
If patients become febrile or develop symptoms of cytokine release, we may measure 
cytokine levels , serum ferritin, C-reactive protein and markers of tumor lysis syndrome (e.g. 
chemistry, uric acid, LDH) , and evaluate persistence and phenotype of the transgene-expressing 
cells, as clinically indicated . 
 
Any patient who develops clinical evidence of symptoms related to cytokine release will have a 
work-up to exclude infection or other causes. Initial treatment should consist of supportive measures as dictated by [CONTACT_462481], and may include fluid replacement,  
medications to support blood pressure, antipyretics, oxygen supplementation, and broad-spectrum antibiotics if infection cannot be excluded as a potential etiology for the signs and symptoms. Patients with G rade > 3 CRS (severe CRS; sCRS) and or Grade 2 CRS with 
progressive symptoms and signs should be treated with tocilizumab (4 -8 mg/kg IV) and 
corticosteroids (dexamethasone 10 mg IV every 12 hours). Higher doses of steroids may be given after discussion with the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_462442]. See Appendix G for cytokine release syndrome grading and Appendix H for recommended management guidelines .     
 
10C. Management of tumor lysis syndrome 
1. All patients will be considered at risk for tumor lysis and should receive allopurinol 
prophylaxis before chemotherapy begins , unless contraindicated . Allopurinol should be 
continued for as long as the medical team determines appropriate after the T cell infusion. They 
may receive additional hydration and urine alkalinization  for the first [ADDRESS_592214] patient management with guidance from the study staff  69.  
Conservative therapy, including allopurinol, urinary alkalinization, and IV fluid hydration may be instituted immediately for suspected tumor lysis syndrome. Hyperkalemia may be treated with potassium binding resins, diuresis, or insulin/dextrose therapy. Hyperphosphatemia may be treated with phosphate binding resins. In severe cases, rasburicase (in non-G6PD -deficient 
individua ls) or renal dialysis may be necessary.
  
  
10D. Management of neurotoxicity 
1. Neurotoxicity, manifest as delirium, seizures and/or focal neurologic deficits , has been 
reported after CD19 CAR-T cell therapy.  Patients with high tumor burden ALL (> 20% blasts) 
should receive prophylactic treatment with Keppr a 500 mg bid (or similar regimen) starting  at 
least 1 day prior to T cell infusion. Keppra can be discontinued when clinically appropriate. 
Neurotoxicity that is attributed to the T cell infusion/s sh ould be treated with corticosteroids (e.g. 
 24 dexamethasone 10 mg IV q 4-12 hours).  T ocilizumab may also be given , preferably after 
discussion with the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1461]. See Appendix H for recommended 
management guidelines . 
 
10E. Management of other toxicities  
1. If a new onset CTCAE v4.0 grade ≥ 3 toxicity is observed following any T cell 
infusion, the patients will receive investigation and medical treatment appropriate for the physiological abnormalities.  
 2. Grade ≥  3 toxicity that is attributed to the T cell infusion /s, and is unresponsive to 
supportive measures or persists for > 7 days may be treated with corticosteroids (e.g. dexamethasone 10 mg IV q 4-12 hours) or tocilizumab after discussion with the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1461]. 
 
3. Uncontrolled proliferation of CD19 CAR-T cells has not been observed in clinical 
trials to date. However, in the unlikely event uncontrolled proliferation of CD19 CAR-T cells occurred in a study subject, initial therapy may involve treatment with corticosteroids (e.g. methylprednisolone 1 g IV). Anti-lymphocyte globulin or cytotoxic drugs would also be considered in serious cases.  If we observe an increase in CAR positive cells to greater than 10% 
of T cells at more than [ADDRESS_592215] infusion we will analyze for clonal expansion by [CONTACT_462482] (Adaptive Biotechnology). 
 
10.F. Management of ibrutinib dosing   
 Patients with CLL who are enrolled in the expanded CLL cohort will receive oral 
ibrutinib at 420 mg daily (3 tablets ).  Ongoing dose reductions of 140mg  may be considered as 
needed for patients who are  intolerant of side effects. As ibrutinib can be associated with increased risk of bleeding, it should be held during severe thrombocytopeni a (platelet count 
unable to be sustained > 20,000 by [CONTACT_29470]), and then restarted upon platelet recovery.

 32 14.    EVALUATION AND STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
14A.  Type of study 
This is a phase 1/2  study t o assess the safety  and antitumor activity  of adoptive T cell 
therapy with autologous CD4+ T cells and CD8+ TCM cells transduced to express a CD19-
specific CAR  for patients with advanced CD19+ B cell malignancies.  
14B. Definition of endpoints  
1. Safety assessment (relevant data being obtained)  
   a.  General Toxicity Assessment  
• History and physical exam before and at intervals after T cell 
infusions. 
• Pulse oximetry before and during the infusion 
• Chemistry battery before and at intervals after the T cell infusion  
• Toxicity grading according to NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 
• Serum cytokine levels  
• B cell reconstitution  
• Replication competent lentivirus  
• Adverse event reporting 
 
2.  Efficacy Assessment  
a. Evaluation of the duration of persistence of adoptively transferred CD19 CAR-T cells  
b. Evaluation of the migration of adoptively transferred CD19 CAR-T cells  
c. Evaluation of antitumor activity of adoptively transferred CD19 CAR-T cell s 
by [CONTACT_462486], and determining progression free survival, and overall s urvival. 
 
14C.   Endpoint Evaluation  
1.  Safety Assessment  – Stage 1  
In Stage 1 of the study, patients will be treated in cohorts of three or more patients at one of four dose levels of CD19 CAR-T cells starting at dose level 1 ( Section 9D.1) to 
determine a single cell dose to evaluate in an expanded cohort of patients in Stage 2.  
 
  a. Dose limiting toxicities
 
1. Death  within 8 weeks of the study cell infusion thought to be definitely  or 
probably related to CAR T cell therapy. 
 
2. Other dose limiting toxicities will be defined as follows :  
 
  i. Grade ≥  3 non-hematologic toxicity in any major organ system that is 
probably or definitely attributed to T cell infusion AND is unresponsive (does not improve to < grade 3 toxicity) to treatment with dexamethasone 10 mg q 12 hours IV for ≥ 7 days  (or an equivalent corticosteroid dose) or 
tocilizumab 8 mg/kg IV for ≥ 3 dose s OR  of greater than  28 days duration. 
Hematologic toxicity is an expected complication of chemotherapy, and other than B cell depletion, has not been observed in prior trials of CAR T cell therapy, and therefore will not be considered for altering T cell dose. 
 33    
  ii. CTCAE grades 3-5 allergic reactions related to the study cell infusion.   
     iii. CTCAE grades 2 -5 autoimmune reactions, other than expected B cell 
depletion. 
 
3. Patients receiving CD19 CAR -T cells may develop serious toxicity due to T 
cell activation, proliferation and cytokine secretion after encounter with tumor antigen. Cytokine release syndrome, macrophage activation syndrome and neurotoxicity may occur and require intensive care support, and will not 
be considered DLTs unless they meet criteria as outlined in 14.C.1.a.2.i. 
 
b. Dose escalation or de- escalation  
If toxicity defined above (Section 14C.1.a.) develops in 0 of 3 patients at any cohort-specified dose level, as described in 9D.1, the next 3 patients may  receive the next 
higher dose of T cells. If such toxicity develops in 2 of 3 patients at any dose level, the next 3 patients will be treated at one dose level lower. If such toxicity develops in 1 of 3 patien ts, up to an additional 3 patients will be treated at the same dose level. If such 
toxicity occurs in 1 of 6 patients at a given dose level, subsequent patients may be treated at the next higher dose.  
 
If toxicity developed in 2 of 3 patients at the lowes t dose level (dose level 0), the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_462447] T cells was appropriate.  
 
The highest dose of T cells that is estimated to result in toxicity in < 1/3 patients  
within each Stage 1 cohort will be the dose selected for Stage 2 evaluation where patients will be stratified into one of 3 cohorts based on the histology of their disease.   
c. Dose de-escalation for the second CAR-T cell infusion for the “Planned Dose Dense 
Cohort Expansion for NHL” Eligible patients will be treated with a second infusion at DL2. Up to twenty patients will be treated in this expanded cohort.  If there ever exists sufficient evidence to suggest that the true toxicity rate after the second infusion exceeds 30%, where 
toxicity is as defined in Section 14C.1.a, consideration will be given to reducing the dose (DL1) and enrollment of patients will continue at this reduced dose.  We would analyze the basis for the toxicity (cytokine production, in vivo cell proliferation, tumor lysis) to  determine if treating additional patients at this lower T cell dose was 
appropriate.  
 
Sufficient evidence for this rule will be defined as any observed outcome whose lower 80% confidence limit exceeds 30%. Operationally, any of the following ratios of toxicities to patients treated would trigger such a rule: 2/2, 3/3 -5, 4/6-8, 5/9-10, 6/11-
13, 7/14-16, 8/17-19, 9/20. If the true probability of toxicity is 0.20, then the probability of this achieving this trigger  after 20  patients is approximately 0.12.  If the 
true toxicity rate is 0.50, then the probability after 20 patients is approximately 0.94.  
 34  
If all patients in this  cohort are treated without this stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_404200], then we 
will consider the true toxicity rate associated with this treatment to be consistent with 
an acceptable level (i.e. ≤ 30%) in this cohort and we may proceed to a larger trial that would formally analyze the antitumor effect of CAR -modified T cells as well as 
continue to assess the safety of this approach . 
 Additionally, we will assess the AUC (between day 0-28) of T cell persistence in this cohort, as the goal of the [ADDRESS_592229] seen 
before.  The benchmark that we will  use for assessment of this improvement is a mean 
of 715,000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ug  based on results observed in 11 patients treated with Flu/Cy and 
given DL2 CAR-T cells.   All [ADDRESS_592230]-deviation 
units aw ay from the benchmark of 715,000, then 20 patients will provide 80% power 
to detect a statistically significantly increased AUC (at the one-sided significance level of .05).  
 2.  Safety Assessment – Stage [ADDRESS_592231] 
that the true toxicity rate exceeds 30%  in any of the cohorts , where toxicity is 
as defined in Section 14C.1.a, enrollment of patients  in that disease cohort  will 
be suspended for safety reasons, pending a detailed review by [CONTACT_978], study monitor and statistician. We would analyze the basis for the toxicity (cytokine production, in vivo cell proliferation, tumor lysis) to determine if treating additional patients  in that cohort a t a lower T cell dose was appropriate.  
 
Sufficient evidence for this stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_462448] 80% confidence limit exceeds 30%. Operationally, any of the following ratios of toxicities to patients treated would trigger such a rule: 2/2, 3/3-5, 4/6-8, 5/9-10, 6/11-13, 7/14-16, 8/17-19, 9/20-22, 10/23-25, 11/26-28, 12/29-31, 13/32-34, 14/35-37, 15/38-40, 16/41-43, 17/44-45.. If the true probability of toxicity is 0.20, then the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_4425] 25 patients is approximately 0.12.  If the true toxicity rate is 0.50, then the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_4425] 25 patients is approximately 0. 94.  
 If all patients in a particular cohort are treated without this stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_404200], then we will consider  the true toxicity rate associated with this treatment 
to be consistent with an acceptable level (i.e. ≤ 30%) in this cohort and we may 
proceed to a larger trial that would formally analyze the antitumor effect of CAR -modified T cells as well as continue to assess the safety of this approach . 
 
2.  Study pause for treatment related mortality: If in the combined Stage 1 and 
Stage 2 portions of the study there is evidence of CAR -T cell  related mortality 
whose lower limit of one-sided 90% confidence limit exceeds 10% the study 
 35 will be paused and evaluated by [CONTACT_462487].  Operationally, 
any of the following ratios of CAR -T cell  related mortality  to total patients 
treated would trigger such a rule: 18/130, 20/140, 21/150, 22/160, 23/170, 24/180, 25/190 and 27/200.  This will be looked at after every 10
th patient is 
treated .   
 
3. Suspending enrollment for lack of efficacy: If in the Stage [ADDRESS_592232] 10 patients in any disease cohort exhibit an antitumor response, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_462449] a determination whether the cohort should be discontinued or if a modification of dose and or 
treatment regimen considered.    
 
4. The occurrence of a malignancy attributed to lentiviral modified T cells or 
detection of replication competent lentivirus (RCL) in either stage would result in termination of the protocol. 
 
3.  Assessment of e fficacy of transferred T cells  
Data should be collected for persistence, migration and efficacy of transferred T cells and descriptive statistics  will be used to summarize the changes from 
baseline where possible. For those patients with measurable disease at the time T cell therapy commences, res ponses will be evaluated using standard response 
criteria based on CT or PET imaging and histologic analysis of bone marrow or other tissue samples .   
 15.   GUIDELINES FOR REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS AND DATA SAFETY AND MONITORING PLAN. 
 
15A.  General issues and IRB reporting requirements  
1. Definitions associated with reportable events and reporting requirements can be 
found on the FHCRCs Institutional Review Office (IRO) extranet website (Table 1).  2. The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc_40
) 
will be used for grading and analysis of adverse events. All  grade [ADDRESS_592233] leukapheresis and again from the day 
of lymphodepletion through day 28 after each T cell infusion . 
 The collection of adverse events will stop at the time of commencement of new systemic anti-tumor therapy. 
 
To ensure that investigative treatment -related conditions are distinguished from disease-
related conditions, attribution of causality will be establ ished in grading adverse events. 
For each event, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1461], in conjunction with the physician or research nurse who examined and evaluated the research participant, will assign the attribution.  Data managers who are removed from the clinical assessment of the research participant should not perform this.  Attribution of adverse events attributed to the infused genetically modified T cells should be determined using the following criteria:  
 
 36 Definite - the adverse event is clearly related to the infused T cells  
Probable - the adverse event is likely related to the infused T cells  
Possible - the adverse event may be related to the infused T cells  
Unlikely - the adverse event is doubtfully related to the infused T cells  
Unrelated - the adverse event is clearly not related to the infused T cells  
 
3. The FHCRC IRB will be notified of reportable events by [CONTACT_462488] (PI) or study nurse according to current reporting obligations as found on the 
FHCRC Instit utional Review Office extranet website.  
4. The review and reporting of AEs will be in accordance with the Cellular 
Immunotherapy AE reporting for separate FH sponsor and Investigator SOP. 5. Reporting of unanticipated adverse effects to the FDA will be the respo nsibility of 
the sponsor. 6. The FHCRC PI [INVESTIGATOR_462450]  
(in person or via teleconference) to review all reported events.

15B.  Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
1. Definition of Risk Level This phase I/II trial involves genetic modification of somatic cells an d requires an IND. 
At the FHCRC, this type of trial has independent monitoring twice each year thro ugh the 
Clinical Trials Support Office at the FHCRC, and has a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (Section 16B.3).   2. Monitoring and Personnel Responsible for Monitoring 
 37 a) The Principal Investigator (P.I.) is responsible for every aspect of the design, 
conduct and final analysis of the protocol.  Regulations defining the responsibil ities for 
assessment and reporting of adverse events (AE), serious AE and unexpected AE are

   The study will be monitored by [CONTACT_462491] 
(IIRC) DSMB.  The DSMB  will be responsible for safeguarding the interests of trial 
participants and assessing the safety and efficacy of the interven tions during the trial.  
This responsibility will be exercised by [CONTACT_462492][INVESTIGATOR_30902].  To contribute to enhancing the integrity of the trial, the DSMB may also formulate recommendations relating to the selection, recruitment and retention of participants and their management; adherence to protocol-specified regimens; and the procedures for data management and quality control.   The DSMB will be advisory to the study Sponsor and the PI, who will be responsible for prompt review of the DSMB recommendations to guide decisions regarding continuation or termination of the trial and whether amendments to the protocol or changes in study conduct are required.  The external DSMB is an independent, multidisciplinary group consisting of 
clinical experts and a statistician who collectively have experience in leukemia, lymphoma, hematology, biostatistics, and the conduct and monitoring of clinical trials. The DSMB will meet approximately every 6 months to review data. The current 
members are listed in the IIRC DSMB charter.

 42 18. APPENDICES  
 
APPENDIX A - Suggested Cytoreduction/Lymphodepletion Chemotherapy Regimens 
 
The following is a general guide to accepted chemotherapy regimens to be used immediately prior to adoptive T cell therapy.  The selection of appropriate chemotherapy regimen  to provide 
tumor cytoreduc tion and lymphodepl etion is based on the tumor histology and on the types of 
prior treatment that the patient has undergone and should be discussed with the study PI’s.  Chemotherapy regimens that employ prolonged administration of corticosteroids that would continue after the T cell infusion cannot be used for prior to T cell infusion. Patients should be scheduled for T cell infusions starting 36-[ADDRESS_592236] dose of chemotherapy.  Patients 
should not receive Alemtuzumab or other T cell depleting antibodies in the 6 months prior to T cell therapy.   
 The preferred regimen for Stage 2 of the trial is the combination of Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide for all diagnoses unless the patients’ clinical situation dictates otherwise.  Suggested regimens include Cyclophosphamide up to 60 mg/kg day 1, followed by [CONTACT_453918] 25 mg/m
2 daily x 3 days. 
 Alternative regimens would include Cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m
2 day 1-3 and Fludarabine 30 
mg/m2 day 1-3.   
 Depending on the patients ’ clinical situation a number of additional regimes could be used after 
discussion with the study PI.  Possible regimens may include the following as a general guide.  
1) CLL 
a. High dose cyclophosphamide (2-4 grams/m
2) with MESNA  with or without anti-
CD20 antibodies such as rituximab or ofatumumab 
b. OFAR  
c. Bendamustine alone or  with rituximab or ofatumumab 
d. Fludarabine with rituximab or ofatumumab +/ - cyclophosphamide 
2) Indolent NHL and Mantle Cell NHL  
a. One or two cycles of aggressive salvage regimen such as ICE, DHAP, ESHAP alone or in combination with an anti-CD20 antibody.   
b. High dose cyclophosphamide (2-4 grams/m
2) with mesna alone or in combination 
with an anti -CD20 antibody. 
c. High dose etoposide alon e or in combination with an anti-CD20 antibody. 
3) Aggressive NHL  
a.   One or two cycles of aggressive salvage regimen such as ICE, DHAP, ESHAP 
alone or in combination with an anti-CD20 antibody.   
b.   High dose cyclophosphamide (2-4 grams/m2) with mesna  alone or in combination   
with an anti -CD20 antibody. 
c.   High dose etoposide alone or in combination with an anti -CD20 antibody. 
4) ALL  
a. High dose cyclophosphamide (2-4 grams/m2) with MESNA  
b. Any aggressive ALL regimen.

T cell infusion time points represent guidelines for performance of required ev aluations. Due to numerous factors influencing scheduling (pt and provider availability, testing 
services limitations etc), variation in evaluation performance dates is anticipated and acceptable to the protocol (e.g., wit hin +/ - 7 days of time points < day 30; +/ - 90 days  for 
time points > day 30 ).

 50 APPENDIX E – Response criteria for CLL and NHL  
 
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) 
 
Complete remission  (CR) :  Normal imaging studies (X-ray, CT, MRI) (nodes, liver, 
and spleen), peripheral blood by [CONTACT_462497], bone marrow by [CONTACT_462497], bone marrow by [CONTACT_462498] (or if present, nodules are free from CLL cells by [CONTACT_9064]), and the duration is at least 2 months.  
 CR with minimal residual  disease  (CR- MRD) :  CR by [CONTACT_462499]  >0 - <1 CLL cells/1000  
leukocytes (0.1%)  Partial remission  (PR) :  Absolute lymphocyte count in peripheral blood at least 
50% decreased and physical exa m/Imaging studies (nodes, liver, and/or spleen) at least 
50% decreased.  Duration is  at least 2 months. 
 Progressive disease (PD) :  at least one of: Physical exam/imaging studies (nodes, liver, 
and/or spleen) >50% increase or new, circulating lymphocytes by [CONTACT_422953]/or 
flow cytometry >50%increase, and lymph node biopsy with Richter’s transformation  Stable disease  (SD) :  Did not meet any of the above criteria for complete or partial 
remission or progression.   
Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) 
 Complete response  (CR) : Disappearance of all clinically detectable disease.  
 Partial response (PR) : >50% reduction of the sum of the products of the perpendicular 
diameters of marker lesions, no progression of any existing lesions, and no new lesions.  
 Stable disease  (SD) : Stabilization of all existing lesions with no new lesions (i.e. a <25% 
increase or <50% decrease in disease parameters defined above throughout the treatment  
period).  Progressive disease (PD) : >25% increase in the sum of the products of the perpendicular 
diameters of marker lesions, or the appearance of new lesions. 
 
 
Acute lymphoblast  leukemia  (ALL ) 
 Remission status will be determined by [CONTACT_462500], flow cytometry and molecular studies as appropriate.
  
 51 APPENDIX F - Long Term Follow-Up  
 
Study participants should be asked to participate in long term follow -up, as directed by 
[CONTACT_61127] – Gene Therapy Clinical Trials: Observing Subjects for Delayed Adver se Events. 
(
http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformati
on/Guidances/ CellularandGeneTherapy/ucm072957.htm#5 ). 
 Long term follow-up should commence one year after the final T cell infusion. The planned recommendations for follow-up are as follows:   Years 1 - 15: 
 
1. Recommendation that patients undergo at least annual histo ry and physical 
examination with their primary physician:  
• Adverse event screening guidance for the primary physician in the form of a gene therapy LTFU -directed screening survey may  be available.  
• A request for the study team to be notified of all new malignancies and 
unexpected illnesses.  
• The primary physician may  be provided with a blood draw courier kit to enable 
samples to be returned to the Turtle Lab for archival purposes, and for analysis 
for transgene and vector persistence, and RCL, as dictated by [CONTACT_462501] T cell persistence.  
 
2. Annuall y participants will complete  the “Immunotherapy Long Term Follow -up 
questionnaire ” to screen for adverse events. 
 
3. Offer the opportunity to return to FHCRC for an annual LTFU clinic visit. 
 
4. Compliance with 21 CFR 312.32 in adverse event reporting. 
 
5. Research studies 
5.i.  30 ml of blood in sodium heparin for evaluation for transgene vector 
sequence by [CONTACT_462502] 6 months for years 1 to 5 and every year for years 6-15 until the transgene becomes undetectable.  
5.ii. If > 1% of cells express the transgene or if clonality is suggested, vector 
integration sites or TCRB sequence utilization may be analyzed in PBMC , CAR-T cells or other tissue. If clonality is suggested, repeat 
testing may  be performed 3 months later. Persistent monoclonality, clonal 
expansion or vector integration near a known oncogenic locus should precipi[INVESTIGATOR_462456]. However, the need for additional intervention should be guided by [CONTACT_462503].  
5.iii. 10 ml of blood in sodium heparin for annual testing of PBMC for RCL 
by [CONTACT_462504]. If there is no evidence of transgene persistence, RCL assays may  be suspended after one year and samples may  be archived.  
 52 APPENDIX G – Grading Criteria for CRS  
 
Grade  Description of Symptoms  
1: Mild  Not life -threatening, require only symptomatic treatment such as antipyretics and 
anti-emetics (e.g., fever, nausea, fatigue, headache, myalgia, malaise)  
2: Moderate  Require and respond to moderate intervention:  
• Oxygen requirement < 40%, or  
• Hypotension responsive to fluids or low dose of a single vasopressor, or  
• Grade 2 organ toxicity (by [CONTACT_3989] v4.03)  
3: Severe  Require and respond to aggressive intervention:  
• Oxygen requirement ≥ 40%, or  
• Hypotension requiring high dose of a single vasopressor (e.g., 
norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238] ≥  20 µg/min, dopamine ≥ 10 µg/kg/min, phenylephrine ≥ 200 
µg/min, or epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] ≥  10 µg/min), or  
• Hypotension requiring multiple vasopressors (e.g., vasopressin + one of the above agents, or combination vasopressors equivalent to ≥ 20 µg/min 
norepi[INVESTIGATOR_238]), or  
• Grade 3 organ toxicity or Grade 4 transaminitis (by [CONTACT_3989] v4.03)  
4: Life -threatening  Life-threatening:  
• Requirement for ventilator support, or  
• Grade 4 organ toxicity (excluding transaminitis)  
5: Fatal  Death

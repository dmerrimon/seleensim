Original Protocol  11 May 2023  - - 
Overall Rationale for the Amendment:  
The Protocol Amendment 3 has been amended to allow for additional Day 31 interim 
analyses and to add a Part B to the study following the Day 15 interim analysis, during 
which a lower dose (3 µg) of the mRNA -CR-04 vaccine will be evaluated and sponsor 
personnel will be unblinded . 
Section # and Name  [CONTACT_9353] 1.1 (Synopsis), Section 1.2  
(Schema), Section 4.1 (Overall 
design), Section 4.2 (Scientific 
rationale for study design) , Section 
4.3 (Justification for dose), and 
Section 6.3.3 (Intervention allocation 
to the participant) .  This study is divided into two parts 
(Parts A and B) . Part B  will 
commence only after all Part A 
participants have completed their 
Day 15 study visits and the Day 15 
interim analysis is completed. In 
Part B, 42 more participants will be 
enrolled in parallel and randoml y 
assigned in a 3:3:1 ratio to receive : 
(a) 3 µg  mRNA -CR-04 vaccin e, or 
(b) 10 µg  mRNA -CR-04 vaccine , or 
(c) saline p lacebo . To explore a wider range of 
vaccine doses  and to repeat the [ADDRESS_1170411] in  standardiz ing the Part B to 
Part A  study groups . 
Section 1.1 (Synopsis), Section 1.2 
(Schema), Section 4.1 (Overall 
design ), Section 6.3.4 (Blinding and 
unblinding), Section [IP_ADDRESS] 
(Staggered administration of study 
intervention), Section [IP_ADDRESS] ( SRT 
and iSRC evaluation ), and Section 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 (Myocarditis and 
pericarditis: definitions and 
assessment ). Text modified to allow unblinding  of 
sponsor personnel  (includ ing the 
SRT) to individual level  treatment 
assignments following the Part A 
Day 15 interim analysis . The 
observer -blind will be maintained at 
the site level . Practical consideration to allow all 
sponsor personnel to use 
unblinded data analyses from this 
initial phase 1 trial to plan further 
clinical development of the 
investigational vaccine platform. 
The SRT will no lo nger need to rely 
on the iSRC as the sole reviewer of 
unblinded safety data.  
Section 2.2 (Background)  and 
Section 4.3 (Justification for dose) . FDA authorization of monovalent 
COVID -19 vaccine boosters 
encoding XBB.1.5 since 11 
September 2023 added  to text . Since the prior protocol 
amendment, the FDA has 
approved and authorized new 
monovalent COVID -19 vaccines 
encoding this variant for 
admi nistration as booster doses . 
Section 6.1 ( Study interventions 
administered) . Added a new table to specify the 
study intervention s to be 
administered to  Part B  study 
participants.  To align with the new interventions 
planned for Part B of the study . 
Section 8.2.3 (Immunological read -
outs) . Revised  the number of participants 
column  to add the planned 42 Part 
B study participants . To align with the planned additional 
study participants in Part B  of the 
study . 
Section 9.3 (Analysis sets) . Modified the p er protocol analysis 
set definition to clarify the 
immunogenicity endpoint of interest To align  the per protocol set 
definition immunogenicity endpoint 
of inter est with the endpoint

protein and removed the overall 
safety analysis set. specified  in the statistical analysis 
plan and to remove the redundant 
overall safety analysis set.  
Section 9.4.1 (Primary endpoint) , 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]  (Safety endpoints) , 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] (Immunogenicity 
endpoints) , and Section 9.4.3 
(Analyses of exploratory 
immunogenicity endpoints ). Clarified that  these statistical 
analyses  will be performed 
descriptively and separately for 
study Part A and Part B participants 
and will be pooled for model based 
analyses.  To align with the addit ional 
analyses required with the addition 
of the study Part B participants.  
Section 9.5.1 (Sequence of 
analyses).  Added text to perform a Day 31 
interim analysis on Part A 
participants and to allow for 
potential Day 15 and Day 31 interim 
analyses for Part  B participants.  To explicitly note  the known and 
potential additional interim 
analyses currently planned for this 
study .

Protocol  Amendment 3 Final  
07 Feb 2024   19 Adverse Drug Reaction:  An adverse event where a causal relationship between a 
medicinal product and the adverse event is at least a 
reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be 
ruled out.  
a. In the context of a clinical trial, an ADR can be 
serious or non -serious. Seri ous ADRs may be 
subject to expedited reporting if they are considered 
unexpected (see S[LOCATION_003]R definition).  
b. For marketed products, ADRs are subject to 
expedited reporting within the country where they 
are authorized  
Adverse Event (AE):  Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation participant, temporally associated with the 
use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered 
related to the medicinal product.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable  and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product. For 
marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure 
to produce expected benefits (i .e., lack of efficacy), 
abuse or misuse.  
Auxiliary Medicinal 
Product (AxMP):  Medicinal products used in the context of a clinical trial 
but not as investigational medicinal products, such as 
medicinal products used for background treatment, 
challenge agen ts, rescue medication, or used to assess 
end-points in a clinical trial. Auxiliary medicinal 
products should not include concomitant  medications, 
that is medications unrelated to the clinical trial and not 
relevant for the design of the clinical trial.  
a. Authorized AxMP : Medicinal product authorized in accordance with 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, or in any Member State 
concerned in accordance with Directive 2001/83/EC, 
irrespective of changes to the labelling of the medicinal 
product.  
Safety reporting with regard to auxiliary medicinal 
products shall be made in accordance with Chapter 3 of 
Title IX of Directive 2001/83/EC.

07 Feb 2024   24 1. PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
1.1. Synopsis  
Rationale:  [COMPANY_004] is developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a novel mRNA vaccin e platform where the SARS -CoV -2 
Omicron variant S glycoprotein will be used as an antigen model (hereafter referred to as 
mRNA -CR vaccine s). This mRNA vaccine platform development includes several 
mRNA constructs (mRNA -CR-XX) currently under development that will be progressing 
into clinical research in humans.  
Objectives, endpoints and estimands:  This exploratory, FT IH study  is to evaluate the 
safety, reactogenicity and immune responses of the mRNA -CR-[ADDRESS_1170423] 
when administered in healthy adults previously vaccinated with SARS -CoV -2 mRNA 
vaccines. For details on objectives, endpoints and estimands , refer to Section  3. 
Overall design:  This will be a  Phase 1, observer -blind, randomized,  placebo -controlled , 
multicenter, dose-escalation study evaluating in Part A of the study, 3 dose s (10 µg, 30 
µg, and 100 µ g) of the mRNA -CR-04 (Omicron BA.5 strain) vaccine . Approximately 72 
participants will be enrolled with 24 participants per group  (Group 1, Group 2 and Group 
3). Withi n each group, p articipants will be randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio to receive:  
• investigational mRNA -CR-04 vaccine (SPK001 -AC01 mRNA -LNP) or 
• saline placebo.  
For each group , [ADDRESS_1170424] completed their 
Day 15 study visits and the Day 15 interim analysis is complete d. In Part B, 2 doses ( 3 µg 
and 10 µg) of the mRNA -CR-04 (Omicron BA.5 strain) vaccine will be evaluated. 
Approximately 42 participants will be enrolled in parallel in Part B and there will be no 
sentinel participants. Part B participants will be randomly assigned in a 3:3:1 ratio to 
receive:  
• 3 µg investigational mRNA -CR-04 vaccine (SPK001 -AC01 mRNA -LNP) or  
• 10 µg investigational mRNA -CR-04 vaccine (SPK001 -AC01 mRNA -LNP) or  
• saline placebo.  
Data Monitoring/Other committees:  Safety monitoring and safety data review will be 
performed by a [COMPANY_004] SRT (blinded data review  until Part A Day 15 interim analysis, 
unblinded data review subsequently ) and a  [COMPANY_004] iSRC  (unblinded data review). Safety 
holding rules and safety monitoring are p resented in Section 8.3.7 .

1.2. Schema  
This is an exploratory, FT IH, observer -blind, randomized,  multicenter , controlled study . 
In Part A of the study, t hree doses (10 µg, 30 µg, and 100 µg) of the mRNA -CR-04 
vaccine will be evaluated. Approximately 72 eligible healthy adults, 18 to 49 years, 
inclusive, will be enrolled with 24 participants per group (Group 1, Group 2 and Group 
3). Within each grou p, participants will be randomly assigned in a 3:1 ratio:  
• 18 participants will receive the investigational mRNA -CR-04 vaccine and  
• 6 participants will receive a saline placebo (sodium chloride [NaCl] isotonic solution 
[0.9%]).  
In Part B of the study, two doses (3 µg and 10 µg) of the mRNA -CR-04 vaccine will be 
evaluated. Approximately 42 eligible healthy adults, 18 to 49 years, inclusive, will be 
enrolled in Part B and will be randomly assigned in a 3:3:1 ratio : 
• 18 participants will receive 3 µg of the investigational mRNA -CR-04 vaccine and  
• 18 participants will receive 10 µg of the investigational mRNA -CR-04 vaccine and  
• 6 participants will receive a saline placebo (sodium chloride [NaCl] isotonic solution 
[0.9%]).  
Study duration for all the participants will be approximately 6 months , and they  will be 
evaluated for safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity. Safety monitoring and safety 
data review will be performed by a [COMPANY_004] SRT (blinded data review  until Part A Day 15 
interim analysis, unblinded data review subsequentl y) and a [COMPANY_004] iSRC (unblinded data 
review).

2. INTRODUCTION  
2.1. Study r ationale  
As part of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a novel mRNA vaccine platform, [COMPANY_004] selected the SARS -CoV -2 
S glycoprotein as a  model  antigen (mRNA -CR vaccine). This is an exploratory, FT IH, 
observer -blind, randomized, controlled  study , evaluatin g various  doses of mRNA -CR-[ADDRESS_1170434] previously received:  
• 2-dose primary series and booster dose(s) of an authorized or licensed mRNA 
COVID -19 vaccine (only Moderna or [COMPANY_007] vaccines) with the last booster  dose 
administered at least [ADDRESS_1170435] been reported worldwide, leading to more 
than 6. 8 million deaths  [Mathieu , 2023 ]. To date, there are multiple licensed or 
conditionally approved vaccines available that rely on a variety of vaccine technologies.  
With the surge in Omicron predominance worldwide, its greater transmissibility, and a 
higher risk of SARS -CoV -2 reinfection with Omicron  [Garcia -Beltran , 2021;  Zhou , 
2021 ], it is reasonable to anticipate an urgent need for booster vaccine s to expand 
immunity against Omicron and additional future variants of concern. Bivalent boosters

2.3. Benefit/ risk assessment  
Detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and  expected AEs 
of mRNA -CR-04 vaccine can be found in the IB. 
With  any vaccine, administration site (e.g., pain, swelling, redness) and systemic (e.g., 
fever, fatigue, headache, myalgia) post -dosing events may occur within the first [ADDRESS_1170437]

risk Mitigation strategy  
All study vaccines  
Hypersensitivity reactions 
including allergic reactions 
such as anaphylaxis  Acute allergic reactions such as a 
rare case of anaphylactic event may 
occur with any vaccine -
administration. These are serious, 
but rare occurrences estimated in 
the range of 1 to 10 cases per 
million of vaccinations, depending 
on the vaccine studied [Rüggeberg , 
2007 ]. A history of hypersensitivity or severe 
allergic reaction (including anaphylaxis) is 
an exclusion criterion for study participation 
and a contraindication to vaccination.  
The onset of vaccine -related allergic 
symptoms is typi[INVESTIGATOR_784519]. To treat 
participants with a serious allergic 
vaccination  reaction, all participants will 
need to remain under observation (i.e.,  
visibly followed; no specific procedure) at 
the study site for at least [ADDRESS_1170438] the 
study site immediately for occurrence of 
any possible hypersensitivity reaction within 
1 day following stu dy intervention 
administration.  
Bleeding following 
intramuscular injection  As with other intramuscular 
injections, study intervention should 
be given with caution in individuals 
with bleeding disorders, such as 
hemophilia or on anticoagulant To minimize the risk of bleeding, study 
intervention should be given with caution in 
individuals with thrombocytopenia or any 
coagulation disorder.

in judgment of the investigator would make 
intramuscular injection unsafe will be 
excluded from study enrollment.  
mRNA -CR-04 vaccine  
Myocarditis/ pericarditis  Myocarditis/ pericarditis are 
considered as an important 
identified risk for  marketed mRNA 
COVID -19 vaccines [EMA, 2021a ; 
EMA , 2021b ; FDA, 2021a ; 
FDA, 2021b]  
 
The estimated  reporting rates of 
myocarditis in younger adults [25 - to 
29-year old ] following the first and 
the second doses of BNT162b2 
vaccine were 0.[ADDRESS_1170439] and the second doses of 
mRNA -1273 vaccine  were 1.8 and 
11.2 per 100 000, respectively 
[CDC , 2021] . The same reporting 
trend was observed following 
booster mRNA vaccination, except 
for age, with most cases reported in 
older adults [ACIP , 2021] . Participants at increased risk of 
myocarditis/ pericarditis  or with medical 
history of myocarditis/pericarditis are 
excluded from study enrol lment . 
Participants will also be instructed (via 
informed consent form) to be alert for 
symptoms of myocarditis/pericarditis and 
immediately contact [CONTACT_842252] . 
Participants will be tested for cardiac 
troponin  I and undergo E KG at the 
screening and on D8  after study 
intervention administration . 
Participants will receive close medical 
supervision and medical assessments (e.g., 
laboratory testing) during the study.  
Moreover, myocarditis/ pericarditis will be 
collected  as an AESI  and adjudicated (refer 
to Section 8.3.8 ,Section  8.4.4  and Section  
10.3.5 ) 
Vaccine -associated disease 
enhancement  Enhanced disease following 
vaccination has been observed in 
pre-clinical or clinical studies with 
various vaccines ( e.g., RSV, 
Dengue, SARS) and the m echanism 
is poorly understood [Peeples , 
2020 ]. While there are literature 
reports of enhanced disease in 
animals vaccinated with previous 
SARS vaccines, s ome other reports 
fail to see this effect.  During informed consent process, 
participants will be informed of this 
theoretical risk and asked to report any 
symptoms consistent with COVID -19 and/or 
for which they received medical attention at 
any point during the study.  
Any suspected, probable , or confirmed 
case of COVID -19 (regardless of severity) 
is an AESI; and will be captured and 
described  (refer to Section 8.4.4  and 
Section 10.3.5 )

4. STUDY D ESIGN  
4.1. Overall design  
Experimental Design:  Phase 1, observer -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, 
multicenter, dose-escalation study to evaluate in Part A of the study, 3 dose s (10 µg, 30 
µg, and 100 µg) of the mRNA -CR-04 (Omicron BA.5 strain)  vaccine ( Figure  1) in 3 
groups (Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3) ( Table 4). Part B of the study will commence 
only after all Part A participants have completed their Day 15 study visits and the Day 15 
interim analysis is completed. In Part B  (Table 5), 2 doses ( 3 µg and 10 µg) of the 
mRNA -CR-04 (Omicron BA.5 strain) vaccine will be evaluated  (Figure  1). The study 
will be conducted in the [LOCATION_002]  (US) . 
Duration of the study:  Approximately 6 months after dosing.  
Sentinel dosing : In Part A of the study,  each group will have 8 sentinel participants (6 
receiving the mRNA -CR-04 vaccine and 2 receiving a placebo) who will be enrolled and 
CONFIDENTIAL  
219112  (MRNA CLINRES -001) 
Protocol  Amendment [ADDRESS_1170443] 60 minutes will be maintained between the vaccination of sentinel 
participants across groups . 
Dose -escalation: In Part A of the study, e nrollment of participants in Group [ADDRESS_1170444] -vaccination from sentinel participants in both groups  will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_163538]  (unblinded r eview). The iSRC members will determine whether 
any of the pre -defined holding rules are met or if there is any other safety signal. If no 
safety signal is observed, vaccination of the non -sentinel participants in that group will 
continue . If no safety sig nal observed from sentinel participants in Group 1 and Group 2,  
enrollment and vaccination of the sentinel participants in Group 3  will be initiated.  In 
Part B,  irrespective of dose, all participants in the three study groups will be enrolled in 
parallel . 
Safety Data: Safety data will be collected for [ADDRESS_1170445] -vaccination. Solicited A Es 
will be collected for 7 days (day of vaccination and 6 subsequent days) and unsolicited 
AEs will be collected up to D ay 31. MAAEs, SAEs, pI[INVESTIGATOR_159170], and AESIs will be collected 
for the duration of the study. In addition to the review of unblinded data by [CONTACT_163537], blinded 
data until Part A Day [ADDRESS_1170446] of vendors .

4.2. Scientific rationale for study design  
To ensure maximum safety of the participants, as this will be the first time that the 
mRNA -CR-04 vaccine will be administered in humans, the study will follow an 
observer -blind  design with staggered enrollment and dosing  for Part A of the study , with 
study  holding rules and close safety monitoring throughout the study  as specified in  
Section 4.1 and Section  8.3.7 . Part B of the study adds a n even lower  dose (3 µg) of 
CONFIDENTIAL  
219112  (MRNA CLINRES -001) 
Protocol  Amendment 3 Final  
07 Feb 2024   38 mRNA -CR-04 vaccine  group to allow exploration of a wider range of vaccine doses, as 
well as a repeat of the Part A low dose ( 10 µg) of mRNA -CR-[ADDRESS_1170447] in standardizing the new 3 µg dose group in Part B to the earlier Part A study  
groups.  
4.3. Justification for dose  
The proposed doses will be 3 µg, 10 µg, 30 µg, and 100  µg. The monovalent  SARS -
CoV -2 mRNA vaccines ([COMPANY_007] -BioNTech Comirnaty mRNA vaccine [FDA , 2023 a] and 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_842235] -19 Vaccine [FDA , 2023b]) have been  licensed in the US as a 
2 or 3-dose primary series. Bivalent  formulations of the Moderna and [COMPANY_007] -BioNTech 
COVID -19 vaccines encoding  S protein sequences  from Omicron BA.4/[ADDRESS_1170448] been authorized  for primary and booster vaccinations  [FDA , 2023a; FDA , 
2023b]. 
The maximum planned dose is 100  µg. The rationale for evaluating doses from 3 µg to 
100 µg is based on the following considerations:  
• The optimal d ose required to confer cross -protective immunity against non -Omicron 
variants, including new/emerging variants needs to be determined.  
• Moderna has evaluated doses up to 250  µg (2 -dose regimen) in their Phase 1 studies  
[Jackson , 2020 ]. 
• The doses of the authorized bivalent booster vaccines from [COMPANY_007] -BioNTech and 
Moderna are [ADDRESS_1170449] completed the study if he/she returns for the last visit 
as described in the protocol.  
EoS: LSLV ( Visit 5, Month 6) or date of the last testing  released of the human biological 
samples, related to primary and secondary endpoints, whichever occurs later.  EoS must 
be achieved no later than 8 months after LSLV. E oS cannot be before LSLV.

The randomization of study interventions  will be performed using the IRT system . 
6.3.3.  Intervention allocation to the participant  
In Part A of the study, a pproximately 72 participan ts will be enrolled with 24 participants 
per group . These  24 eligible participant s will be randomly assigned to investigational 
mRNA -CR-04 vaccine or saline placebo in a (3:1) ratio. In Part B of the study, 
approximately 42 participants will be enrolled and randomly assigned to 3 µg 
investigational mRNA -CR-04 vaccine , 10 µg investigational mRNA -CR-04 vaccine , or 
saline placebo in a ( 3:3:1) ratio.  
6.3.4.  Blinding and unblinding  
In Part A of th e study, d ata will be collected in an observer -blind manner. The 
participant, the site and sponsor personnel involved in the clinical evaluation of the 
participants are blinded while other study personnel may be aware of the treatment 
assignment. To do so,  study interventions will be prepared and administered by [CONTACT_842261], evaluation, review,  or the 
entry of any study endpoint data (i.e., reactogenicity, safety, immunogenicity ). In Part B 
of the study  (i.e., following the Part A Day 15 interim analysis) , continuation of the 
observer -blind design will be restricted to study participant s and site personnel involved 
in the clinical evaluation of the participants , while  sponsor perso nnel will no longer 
remain blinded to treatment assignment.

Protocol  Amendment 3 Final  
07 Feb 2024   46 Unblinding a participant’s individual study randomization number should occur ONLY in 
case of a medical emergency when this information is essential for the clinical 
management or welfare of the p articipant.  
In case of emergency, the investigator can have unrestricted, immediate and direct access 
to the participant’s study intervention information via  the IRT . The investigator may 
contact [CONTACT_842262] (refer to Table 8) if help is needed to access participant’s 
study intervention information (i.e. , if the investiga tor is unable to access  IRT).

8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
Protocol waivers or exemptions are only permitted when necessary for the management 
of immediate safety concerns for the participant.  
Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the CRO team  as soon as they occur 
or when the study team becomes aware of them. The purpose of this communication is to 
determine if the participant(s) should discontinue the study intervention.  
Study pro cedures and their timing are summarized  in the SoA (Section 1.3). 
All screening evaluations must be completed , and the results reviewed before confirm ing 
that potential participants meet all eligibility criteria.  
The investigator will maintain a log of all participants screened. All relevant information, 
such as confirmation of eligibility and reasons for screening failure will be mentioned in 
this scre ening log.  
Procedures conducted as part of routine clinical management (e.g. , hematologic profiles), 
and obtained before the participant  signed the ICF, may be used for screening and/or for

Protocol  Amendment 3 Final  
07 Feb 2024   50 establishing a clinical baseline (provided the procedure met proto col specified criteria 
and was performed within the time frame defined in the SoA in Section 1.3). 
The PM provides the investigator and site personnel with detailed administrative and 
technical information that does not impact participant safety.  
During special circumstances (e.g., COVID -19 pandemic), certain study procedures may 
be adapted to protect the participant’s welfare, and as far as possible to ensure the 
potential benefit to the participant and promote data integrity. See Section 8.10. 
8.1. Administrative procedures  
All screening procedures, except the SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1170460], need to be performed within 
14 days of Visit 1 (see Section 5.1). A SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_1170461] needs to be performed 
within 7 days of Visit 1. A sample may be collected for repeat testing at any time (but 
only once to assess eligibility) before Visit 1.  
8.1.1.  Collection of demographic data  
At screening, record demographic data such as year of birth, sex, race, and ethnicity in 
the participant’s eCRF.  
Collection of sex, race and ethnicity data is necessary to assess and monito r the diversity 
of the trial participants , and to determine if the trial participants  are truly representative  of 
the impacted population.  
8.1.2.  Medical/vaccination history  
At screening, obtain the participant’s medical/vaccination history by [CONTACT_680400]/or review of the participant’s medical records. Record any pre -existing 
conditions, vaccination history, signs and/or symptoms present prior to  study intervention 
in the eCRF.  
8.1.3.  Distribution of eDiary or installing the application for devices  
Participants will be encouraged to bring their own devices at screening visit, or if not 
feasible, at Visit 1 (Day 1). The study staff will check the compatibility of participant’s 
device (e.g., smart phone or tablet) with respect to eDiary application.  
At Visit 1 (Day 1), participant will download the eDiary application on his/her own 
electronic device or will receive an electronic device to record information related to 
his/her health and participation in the study. The participant will also be trained on the 
use of eDiary.

8.3.1.  Physical examination  
• At screening and prior to dosing at Visit 1 (Day 1), the investigator will perform a 
physical examination of the participant. The following information needs to be 
recor ded in the eCRF:  weight, oral temperature , resting vital signs (before blood 
collection for laboratory test ); systolic/diastolic blood pressure and heart rate after at 
least [ADDRESS_1170470]. If the participant reported any pre -existing medical 
condition , the investigator would extend the physical examination according to 
his/her medical judgment to ensure that the participant meets all the eligibility  
criteria.  Height  and BMI w ill only be recorded at screening.  
CONFIDENTIAL  
219112  (MRNA CLINRES -001) 
Protocol  Amendment 3 Final  
07 Feb 2024   55 • A targeted physical examination at each study visit after the Screening visit, will be 
performed only if the participant indicates during questioning that there might be 
some underlying pathology(ies) or if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_254841].  
• If the investigator determines that the participant’s health on the day of study 
intervention administration temporarily precludes dosing, the visit will be 
rescheduled. Refer to the Section 5.[ADDRESS_1170471] of criteria for temporary delay of 
study intervention administration.  
• Treatment of any abnormality observed during post-vaccination  visits must  be 
performed according to local medical practice outs ide this study or by [CONTACT_842270].  
8.3.2.  Pre-dosing body temperature  
The body temperature of each participant needs to be measured orally  prior to the study 
vaccine administration and recorded in the eCRF. If the participant has fever on the day 
of dosing, the study intervention administration visit will be rescheduled. Refer to the 
SoA (Section 1.3) for the definition of fever for this study and preferred location for body 
temperature measurement.  
8.3.3.  Pregnancy test  
Female participants of childbearing potential must perform a urine  pregnan cy test before 
the administration of the study intervention. At screening, if time allows, a serum 
pregnancy test can be done, in place of the urine pregnancy test, as per local 
requirements.  Pregnancy testing must be done even if the participant is menstruating at 
the time of the study visit. The study intervention may only be administered if the 
pregnancy test is negative.  
Refer to Section 8.4.[ADDRESS_1170472] in the 
eCRF.  
8.3.4.  EKGs  
• 12-lead EKGs will be obtained as outlined in the SoA (see Sec tion 1.3) using an 
EKG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, 
QT, and QTc intervals.

after at least [ADDRESS_1170473] for each participant needs to be measured prior to 
administration of study intervention, i.e., at Visit 1. Collected information will be 
recorded in the eCRF.  
8.3.6.  Clinical safety laboratory tests  
• See Section 10.2.[ADDRESS_1170474] of clinical laboratory tests to be performed in 
accordance with lab manual and the SoA (Section 1.3). 
• The investigator must review the laboratory results, document this review, and 
record any clinically significant changes occurring during the study as an AE. The 
laboratory results must be retained with source documents.  
• Abno rmal laboratory findings associated with the underlying disease are not 
considered clinically significant unless judged by [CONTACT_266941]’s condition . 
• All laboratory tests with values considered clinica lly significantly abnormal during 
participation in the study or within [ADDRESS_1170475] dose of study intervention 
should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer 
considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_842271].  
• In the absence of a diagnosis, abnormal laboratory findings assessments or other 
abnormal results the investigator considers clinically significant will be recorded 
as an AE or SAE, if they meet the definition of an AE or SAE (refer to  Section 
10.3.1  and Section 10.3.2 ). 
• If clinically significant values do not return to normal/baselin e within a period of 
time judged reasonable by [CONTACT_093], the etiology should be identified, and 
the sponsor notified.  
• If laboratory values from non -protocol -specified laboratory tests performed at 
the institution’s local laboratory require a change in participant management or 
are considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_093] (e.g ., SAE or AE), then 
the results must be recorded.  
• Analyses  of safety laboratory samples collected at Day 1 through the EoS will be 
performed at the central laboratory using the same grading standards . 
• Laboratory data will be graded according to the FDA guidance for industry “Toxicity 
grading scale for healthy adults and adolescent volunteers enrolled in preventive 
vaccine clinical trials” dated September 2007 [FDA , 2007 ]. These laboratory values 
serve as guidelines and are dependent upon laboratory  normal parameters. Normal 
reference ranges should be provided to demonstrate that they are appropriate.  Any 
laboratory parameters not listed in Table 19 and Table 20 (Section 10.2.2 ) will not be 
graded and will be assessed on case -by-case basis.

Safety monitoring is specified in the  SoA (Section 1.3), Section [IP_ADDRESS]  and Table 12. 
For the vendors that will perform safety monitoring activities, please refer to the separate  
list of vendors.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Staggered administration of study intervention  
Part A  of the study will be condu cted in a staggered manner to ensure maximum safety of 
the participating participants.  
• Within each group , 8 sentinel participants (6 receiving the mRNA -CR-04 vaccine 
and 2 receiving the placebo) will first be enrolled and vaccinated.  
• Enrollment of participants in Group [ADDRESS_1170476] and second sentinel participant in 
each group will be vaccinated and followed -up for 24 hours before the next sentinel 
participant can be vaccinated . If no safety concerns are identified (as confirmed 
through individual phone call – TC1, see Table 1), vaccination of the remaining 
sentinel partici pants in the same group will then continue with an interval of at least 
[ADDRESS_1170477] 60 minutes will 
be maintained between the vaccination of sentinel participants across groups.  
• If no safety concerns are identified by [CONTACT_842272] 8 safety data of sentinel participants  from Group 1 an d Group 2 , the remaining 
participants in these groups  may receive the study intervention without limitation of 
the number of participants per day or the time between consecutive participants . 
Additionally, vaccination of sentinel participants in Group 3  may be initiated . 
• If no safety concerns are identified by [CONTACT_842273] D ay 8 safety 
data of sentinel participants from Group 3 , the remaining participants in Group 3  
may receive the study intervention without limitation of the number of parti cipants 
per day or the time between consecutive participants.  
All participants will be closely observed (visibly followed, no specific procedure) during 
the [ADDRESS_1170478] escalation to 
the GSB to address any potential safety concerns or study holds at any point during the 
study.  See Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
In Part B  of the study , irrespective of dose, all participants will be enrolled in parallel, 
and the S RT will also be able to review unblinded data.

[CONTACT_842274], authorizing the investigator to start the 
enrollment and study intervention administration to the remaining participants in the 
group  and the sentinel participants in the next group . 
• If a safety signal  is observed during the safety evaluations or if any of the holding 
rules is met, the iSRC Chair  is responsible for the urgent communication and 
escalation of the concern to the GSB . The GSB will decide and communicate 
whether to suspend, modify or continu e the conduct of the study on all groups or on 
selected groups, including the rationale for the decision to put the study intervention 
administration on hold or not.  
• The study sponsor will be accountable for notifying the decision whether to suspend, 
modif y or continue the conduct of the study on all groups or on selected groups  to 
the CRO . The CRO  will be responsible to inform all investigators  of this decision.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Study holding rules  
The safety holding rules are defined in the Table 12. Holding rules 1a -d will be assessed 
by [CONTACT_30036] a continuous basis. Meeting any of these holding rule s will trigger 
a hold of study intervention administration irrespective of number of participants enrolled 
and/or timing of the event. Holding rules 2a -c will be assessed by [CONTACT_842275].  
These holding rules have  been written under the assumption that the safety data from all 
participants will be available. If the data from all participants are not available (i.e., in 
case a participant is lost to follow -up), then the holding rules will be assessed on a pro -
rata b asis (expressed as percentage of participants to be evaluated) i.e., 3 out of 6 sentinel

07 Feb 2024   62 [IP_ADDRESS].  SRT and iSRC evaluation  
The study will be overseen by [CONTACT_489757] a charter. Core members of the 
iSRC will include a [COMPANY_004] safety physician, a CSL and a biostatistician who are not 
otherwise involved in the conduct of the project. The iSRC safety reviews will  be 
conducted using unblinded data. The iSRC will have access to the participant 
randomization and will review unblinded data.  
In addition to the iSRC, the project SRT will review blinded data until the Part A Day [ADDRESS_1170481] -vaccination.  The iSRC will include all safety data sources in 
their Day 8 safety review  (i.e., solicited safety data, unsolicited safety data, SAEs  and 
AESIs , as well as laboratory safety data ). If no pre -defined  holding rule is met (refer to 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) or if no safety signal is observed the remaining participants in the group 
can be vaccinated  and vaccination in the next group can be initiated.  
In case the iSRC, through the in -stream data monitoring of all the accumulated safety 
data available detects that a holding rule is met, the study vaccination will be temporarily 
paused in all study groups and sites pending review of safety data by [CONTACT_163538]. The iSRC 
will make relevant recommendation s to the G SB chair(s), who will make the final 
decision whether vaccination can be safely resumed or not.  
In addition, at any time during the study, if one of the holding rules 1a through 1d (refer 
to Table 12 for details) is met, the investigator will immediately inform the CRO team . 
Vaccination will be paused and an urgent ad -hoc meeting of the iSRC will be called to 
thoroughly review the event(s) and recommend to the GSB whether vaccination can be 
safely resumed or not. The GSB chair(s) will make the final decision whether vaccinat ion 
can be safely resumed or not.  
In Part B of the study, the iSRC will only be requested to review unblinded data if a study 
holding rule is met or if the SRT identifies a safety concern through in -stream data 
monitoring of unblinded data.  
8.3.8.  Cardiac adjudic ation  
Myocarditis and pericarditis are considered as important potential  risk and are collected 
as AESI. All surveillance EKGs occurring at Screening, Day 8, and unscheduled visits, 
will be reviewed by [CONTACT_842279] a blinded fash ion to identify 
potential myocarditis or pericarditis cases . All EKGs identified with changes suggestive 
of potential myocarditis and pericarditis and related available medical records  requested 
from treating cardiologists evaluating potential cases of myo carditis and pericarditis , will 
then be provided to an independent external adjudication committee for case adjudication 
according to the case definition from the Brighton Collaboration [ Sexson , 2022]. The 
committee members will remain blinded to study intervention assignment.

For definitions relating to safety information see Section 10.3. 
The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, 
and recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and other safety 
information and remain responsible for following up A Es that are serious, considered 
related to study intervention or study procedures, AESIs for this study and A Es leading to 
discontinuation (see Section 7). This includes events reported by [CONTACT_2299] (or, when 
appropriate, by a caregiver or surrogate).  
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of A Es/SAEs /AESIs and 
the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Section 10.3. 
8.4.1.  Time period and frequency for collecting AE, SAE and o ther 
safety information  
All SAEs will be collected from the start of study intervention until Visit 5  at the time 
points specified in the SoA  (Section 1.3). 
SAEs as sessed as related to study participation (e.g., study intervention, protocol -
mandated procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therapy) or related to a [COMPANY_004] 
product (non -IMP) will be recorded from the time a participant consents to participate in 
the study.  
All A Es will be collected from the start of study intervention until Visit 4 at the

07 Feb 2024   66 All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the s ponsor immediately and under no 
circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Section 10.3.The investigator 
will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available.  
A poststudy AE/SAE is defined as any event that occurs outside of the AE/SAE reporting 
period defined in Table 13. 
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek information on AEs or SAEs after 
conclusion of the study participation . However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, 
including a death, after a participant has been discharged from the study, the investigator 
must record it in the medical records. If the investigator considers the event to be 
reasonably related to the stu dy intervention or study participation, the investigator must 
promptly notify the sponsor . 
8.4.2.  Method of detecting A Es and SAEs  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting A Es and SAEs. Open -ended and 
nonleading verbal questioning/eDiaries of the p articipant  is the preferred method to 
inquire about AE occurrences.  
8.4.3.  Follow -up of A Es and SAEs  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs and AESI (as defined in Section 8.4.4 ) 
will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the 
participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 7.3). Further information on follow -
up procedures is provided in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] .

be available to investigators at study start.  
The investigator(s) must exercise their medical/scientific judgment to determine whether 
other diseases have an autoimmune origin (i.e., pathophysiology involving systemic or 
organ -specific pa thogenic autoantibodies) and should also be recorded as a pI[CONTACT_28839]. In 
addition, the investigator should categorize each pI[INVESTIGATOR_330488] a new onset condition (if 
it started following vaccination) or as an exacerbation of a pre -existing chronic condition 
(if it exacerbated following vaccination) in the eCRF.

• Prompt notification by [CONTACT_330225]/AESI is essential so 
that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities toward the safety of participants and 
the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met. See 
Section  8.4.1  for reporting timeframes.  
• For SAEs/AESIs, the investigator must always provide an assessment of causality at 
the time of the initial report, as defined in the Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
• An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or 
other specific safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor 
will review and then file it along with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if 
appropriate according to local requirements.  
• Once an investigator (or designee) becomes aware that a study participant has 
experienced an SAE/AESI/pregnancy, it must be reported to the CRO medical 
monitor using the required documentation and within the timeframes mentioned in 
Table 15. This is essential for [COMPANY_004] to meet legal obligations and ethical 
responsibilities f or participant safety and the safety of a study intervention  under

9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1. Statistical hypotheses  
There is no hypothesis testing in th is study; all analysis will be performed in a descriptive 
manner. Means and proportions for different objectives will be computed with their 9 5% 
CIs. 
9.2. Sample size determination  
The sample size is based on clinical considerations to inform dose regimen decis ions for 
continued clinical development.  
With 18 participants receiving mRNA -CR-04 vaccine in each group, there is a 60.3% 
probability to observe at least 1 AE if the incidence rate is 5% and 85% probability to 
observe at least 1 AE if the incidence rate i s 10%.  
With 16 participants receiving mRNA -CR-04 vaccine in each group ( PPS for 
immunogenicity, 10% unevaluable), and a standard deviation of 0.45 for log 10 
transformed increase from Day 1, the ratio of the upper limit of a 2 -sided 95% CI and the 
point estimate of GMR is 1.74.

investigator is responsible for verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by 
[CONTACT_642825].  
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate source documents and study 
records that include all pertinent observations on each of the site’s study participants (see 
Definition  of terms  for the exact definition of source documents ) that supports 
information entered in the eCRF.  
The investigator must permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and 
regulatory agency inspections and provide direct access to source documents or certified 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_448832].  
The sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of this study including 
quality checking of the source data (see Definition  of terms  for the exact definition of 
source data ). 
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered 
in the eCRF by [CONTACT_499118], legible, contemporaneous, 
original, accurate, and complete. Changes to source data must be traceable, not o bscure 
the original entry, and be fully explained if necessary (e.g ., via an audit trail). The safety 
and rights of participants must be protected, and the study conducted in accordance with 
the currently approved protocol and any other study agreements, I CH GCP, and all 
applicable regulatory requirements.  
QTLs will be pre -defined in the centralized monitoring  plan to identify systematic issues 
that can impact participant safety and/or the reliability of study results. These pre -defined 
parameters will be m onitored during the study. Important deviations from the QTLs and 
remedial actions taken will be summarized  in the CSR . 
Study records and source documents pertaining to the conduct of this study, including 
signed ICFs, must be retained by [CONTACT_1732] 25 years from issuance of the final

07 Feb 2024   92 10.3.  Appendix 3: AEs and SAEs: Definitions and procedures for 
record ing, evaluating, follow -up, and reporting  
10.3.1.  Definition of AE  
AE definition  
• An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, 
temporally associated with the use of a study intervention, whether or not 
considered related to the study intervention.  
• NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) 
temporally associated with the use of a study intervention.  
Events Meeting the AE Def inition  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or 
urinalysis) or other safety assessments (e.g., E KG, radiological scans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically 
significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator (i.e., not 
related to progression of underlying disease).  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New condition detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected intervention - intervention 
interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
intervention or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as 
an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -
harming int ent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae.  
• Events that occur as a result of protocol -mandated procedures (i.e. invasive 
procedures, modification of participant’s previous therapeutic regimen).  
Events NOT  Meeting the AE Definition  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments that are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_11009]’s condition.  
• Medical or surgica l procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that 
leads to the procedure is the AE.  
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], admission for routine examination.).  
CONFIDENTIAL  
219112  (MRNA CLINRES -001) 
Protocol  Amendment 3 Final  
07 Feb 2024   93 • Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) 
present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. Pre -existing 
diseases will be recorded in the medical history section of the eCRF.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition (known or 
diagnosed before signing the informed consent) that did not worsen from baseline.  
10.3.2.  Definition of SAE  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, meets one or 
more of the criteria listed:  
a. Results in death  
b. Is life threatening  
The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the 
participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, 
which hypotheti cally might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
c. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12994] (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1083]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the 
physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_42244]. If a complication prolongs hosp italization or fulfills any 
other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether 
“hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing condition that did not 
worsen from baseline is not considered an AE.  
d. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
• This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) that may interfere with or 
prevent everyday life functions but do not constitut e a substantial disruption.  
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study participant  
f. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, 
congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy)  
g. Other situations:  
• Possibl e Hy’s Law case: ALT ≥ 3x ULN AND total bilirubin ≥ 2x ULN (>35% 
direct bilirubin) or INR >1.[ADDRESS_1170522] be reported as SAE  
CONFIDENTIAL  
219112  (MRNA CLINRES -001) 
Protocol  Amendment 3 Final  
07 Feb 2024   94 • Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised by [CONTACT_842299]. These events should usually be considered serious.  
• Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive 
treatment for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, convulsions, or 
development of intervention dependency or intervention abuse.  
10.3.3.  Solicited events  
• Definition of solicited event  
• Solicited events are predefined events administration site events and systemic 
events for which the participant  is specifically questioned, and which are noted by 
[CONTACT_842300].  
a. Solicited administration site events  
The following administration site events will be solicited:  
Table 21 Solicited administration site events  
Pain at administration site  
Redness at administration site  
Swelling at administration site   
Lymphadenopathy  
(Axillary swelling/ tenderness ipsilateral to the site of injection)  
b. Solicited systemic events  
The following systemic events will be solicited:

Protocol  Amendment 3 Final  
07 Feb 2024   95 10.3.4.  Unsolicited AE  
Definition of unsolicited AE  
• An unsolicited AE is an AE that was either not included in the list of solicited 
events or could be included in the list of solicited events but with an onset outside 
the specified period of follow -up for solicited events. Unsolicited AEs must have 
been communicated by [CONTACT_842301]. Unsolicited 
AEs include both serious and nonserious AEs.  
• Potential unsolicited AEs ma y be medically attended (i.e., symptoms or illnesses 
requiring a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], emergency room visit, or visit to/by a healthcare 
provider). The participants  will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_103088](s) , as well as any events that, though not 
medically attended, are of participant concern. Detailed information about reported 
unsolicited AEs will be collected by [CONTACT_103734]’s records.  
• Unsolicited AEs that are  not medically attended nor perceived as a concern by [CONTACT_842302].  
10.3.5.  Recording, assessment and follow -up of AE, SAE, AESIs and 
pregnancies  
[IP_ADDRESS].  AE, SAE and AESI recording  
• When an AE/SAE /AESI  occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review 
all documentation (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory reports, and diagnostics 
reports) related to the event.  
• The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE /AESI  information.  
• It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914]’s

participant number, will be redacted on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_842247] . 
• The investigator will attempt to establ ish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not 
the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.  
• An eDiary will be used in this study to capture solicited admin istration site or 
systemic events. The participant should be trained on how and when to complete the 
eDiary.  
• Anyone who measures administration site or systemic events and who will record the 
event in the eDiary should be trained on using the eDiary. This training must be 
documented in the participant’s source record.

Protocol  Amendment 3 Final  
07 Feb 2024   96 • For each solicited and unsolicited AE the participant experiences, the participant will 
be asked if they received medical attention (defined as unscheduled visit to or from 
medical personnel f or any reason, including emergency room visits). This 
information will be recorded in the participant’s eDiary (for solicited AEs) and in the 
participant’s eCRF as part of normal AE reporting (for unsolicited AEs) . If the 
collection of solicited AEs was not possible for any reasons via the eDiary and 
solicited AEs were reported to the investigator by [CONTACT_2299], then it would be 
possible for it to be reported directly to the site staff and submitted (e.g. via the 
eCRF).  Medical attention received for  SAEs/AESIs will have to be reported using 
the normal AE reporting process in the eCRF.  
• Any unreturned eDiary will be sought from the participant  through telephone call(s) 
or any other convenient procedure.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Assessment of intensity  
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE, AESI  and SAE 
reported during the study and assign it to one of the following categories:  
• Mild:  
A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic i ntervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities 
of daily living.  
• Moderate:  
A type of AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, caus ing 
discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research 
participant.  
• Severe:  
A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects 
clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic interventi on. 
The intensity of the following solicited AEs will be assessed as described:

[IP_ADDRESS].  Assessment of causality  
• The investigator is obligated to asse ss the relationship between study intervention 
and each occurrence of each AE/SAE /AESI . The investigator will use clinical 
judgment to determine the relationship.  
• A reasonable possibility  of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, 
and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot 
be ruled out.  
• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other 
risk factors, as  well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention 
administration, will be considered and investigated.  
• For causality assessment, the investigator will also consult the IB and/or product 
information, for marketed products.  
• The investigat or must review and provide an assessment of causality for each 
AE/SAE /AESI  and document this in the medical notes There may be situations in 
which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include 
in the initial report to [COMPANY_004] . How ever, it is very important that the investigator 
always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial 
transmission of the SAE data to [COMPANY_004] . 
• The investigator may change their opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up 
information and sen d an SAE follow -up report with the updated causality 
assessment.  
• The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Assessment of outcomes  
The investigator will assess the outcome of all serious and nonserious unsolicited AEs 
recorded during the study as:  
• Recovered/resolved  
• Recovering/resolving  
CONFIDENTIAL  
219112  (MRNA CLINRES -001) 
Protocol  Amendment 3 Final  
07 Feb 2024   99 • Not recovered/not resolved  
• Recovered with sequelae/resolved with sequelae  
• Fatal (SAEs only).  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Follow -up of AEs, SAEs, AESIs, pregnancies or any other events of 
interest  
• The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_330547]/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may 
include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, 
or consultation with other health care professionals.  
• If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -
up period, the investigat or will provide [COMPANY_004]  with a copy of any postmortem findings 
including histopathology.  
• New or updated information will be recorded in the originally submitted documents.  
• The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to [COMPANY_004]  within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information.  
After the initial AE/SAE/AESI/pregnancy  or any other event of interest, the investigator 
is required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. will be 
followed until the event is r esolved, stabilized, otherwise explained, or the participant is 
lost to follow -up. 
Other nonserious AEs be followed until the participant is lost to follow -up. 
Follow -up during the study  
AEs/AESIs  documented at a previous visit/contact [CONTACT_842303] r ecovered/not 
resolved or recovering/resolving will be reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts until  
the end of the study or the participant is lost to follow -up. 
If a participant dies during their participation in the study or during a recognized follow -
up period, [COMPANY_004] will be provided with any available postmortem findings, including 
histopathology.  
Follow -up of pregnancies  
Pregnant participants will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. At the 
end of the pregnancy, whether full -term or premature, information on the status of the 
mother and child will be forwarded to [COMPANY_004] using the electronic pregnancy report and the 
AE Report if applicable. Generally, the follow -up period does not need to be longer than 
6 to 8 weeks after the estima ted date of delivery.  
Regardless of the reporting period for SAEs in this study, if the pregnancy outcome is an 
SAE, it should always be reported as such.  
CONFIDENTIAL

Protocol  Amendment [ADDRESS_1170527] report any SAE occurring as a result of a poststudy 
pregnancy that  is considered by [CONTACT_175077], to [COMPANY_004] as described in the Section [IP_ADDRESS] . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Updating of SAE,  AESI and pregnancy information after removal of 
write access to the participant’s eCRF  
When additional SAE, AESI or pregnancy information is received after write access to 
the participant’s eCRF is removed, new or updated information should be recorded on  the 
appropriate paper report, with all changes signed and dated by [CONTACT_093]. The 
updated report should be sent to the Study contact [CONTACT_103738] (refer to Section 
8.4.3 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Reporting of SAEs, AESIs and pregnancies  
SAE Reporting to CRO  via an Electronic Data Collection Tool  
• The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to CRO  will be the electronic data 
collection tool.  
• If the electronic system is unavailable, then the site will use the paper SAE data 
collection tool (see next section) to report the event within 24 hours.  
• The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes 
available.  
• After the study  is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be 
taken offline to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data.  
• If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated 
data on a previousl y reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been 
taken offline, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form (see next 
section) or to the CRO by [CONTACT_756].  
• If the site during the course of the study or poststudy becomes aw are of any serious, 
nonserious AEs, pregnancy exposure, related to any [COMPANY_004] non -IMP they will report 
these events to [COMPANY_004] or to the concerned competent authority via the national 
spontaneous reporting system.  These will be classified as spontaneous ICSRs.  
• Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in Section 8.4.7 . 
SAE Reporting to CRO  via Paper Data Collection Tool  
• Facsimile transmission of the SAE paper data collection tool is the preferred method 
to transmit this information to the CRO medical monit or. 
• Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to 
complete and sign the SAE data collection tool within the designated reporting 
timeframes.  
• Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in Section 8.4.7 .

[IP_ADDRESS].  WOCBP  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postm enopausal 
unless permanently sterile (see below).  
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Women not considered as WOCBP  (WONC BPs)  
• Premenarchal  
Menarche is the first onset of menses in a young female. Menarche is normally 
preceded by [CONTACT_330548].  
Additional evaluation should be considered if a participant’s fertility status is unclear 
(e.g., amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle cannot be 
confirmed before first dose of study intervention.  
• Premenopausal female with ONE of the following:  
• Documented hysterectomy  
• Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]  
• Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s: review of participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
• Postmenopausal female  
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high FSH level in the postmenopausal range may be used to 
confirm a postmenopausal state i n women not using hormonal contraception or HRT. 
However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, confirmation with more than 1 
FSH measurement >40 IU/L (or mIU/mL) is required . 
• Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use a 
non-hormonal, highly effective contraception method if they wish to continue their 
HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation 
of postmenopausal status before study enrol lment . 
10.4.2.  Contraception g uidance  
• Female partic ipants of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree 
to use a highly effective contraceptive method consistently and correctly according 
to the methods listed in [COMPANY_004]’s list of highly effective contraceptive methods ( Table 
24).

• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
Vasectomized  partner  
(A vasectomized  partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is the sole male sexual 
partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of 
contraception should be used.)  
Male p artner sterilization  prior to the female participant’s entry into the study, and this male is the sole partner for that 
participant,  
(The information on the male sterility can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical records; 
medi cal examination and/or semen analysis, or medical history interview provided by [CONTACT_163596]).  
Sexual abstinence  
(Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual 
intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs 
to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.)

The Protocol Amendment Summary of Changes Table for the current amendment 
is located directly before the TOC.  
Amendment 2  
Overall Rationale for the Amendment:  
The Protocol Amendment 2 has been amended to align with the updated guidance 
released by [CONTACT_8956] “Development and Licensure of Vaccines to Prevent COVID -
19”. In this guidance, the FDA indicated that safety monitoring longer than 6 months will 
only be “warranted for certain vaccine platforms (e.g., those that include novel 
adjuvants)”. Hence, the fo llow-up of participants has been reduced from 12 months to 6 
months.

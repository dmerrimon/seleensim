GDD-BSP-T-001 v2014.6  5 1. Introduction 
This document details the planned anal ysis for Study 191622-120.  This study is a 
multicenter, randomized, double-b lind, parallel group study to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of BOTOX for the treatment of urinar y incontinence due to neurogenic detrusor 
overactivity (NDO) in patients [ADDRESS_397908] not been adequately managed 
with anticholinergic therapy.     
There will only be one analysis for this study. When all patients in Study 191622-120 exit the 
study there will a database lock (DBL) and a cl inical study report (CSR) will be generated. 
This analysis plan outlines the outputs to be included in the CSR.  
1.[ADDRESS_397909] not 
been adequately managed with anticholinergic th erapy. Patients in this study are randomized 
to 1 of 3 treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio: 
• 50 units (U) BOTOX (not to exceed 6 U/kg) 
• 100 U BOTOX (not to exceed 6 U/kg) 
• 200 U BOTOX (not to exceed 6 U/kg) 
In order to ensure that the upper dosing limit of 6 U/kg is not ex ceeded, the actual dose 
administered is adjusted based on patient weight, if necessary. 
Patients will be evaluated during a screening peri od for eligibility.  Eligible patients will be 
randomized and receive treatment/injection on Day 1. Patients are centrally randomized. In 
order to ensure balance across treatment groups, patients are stratified by [CONTACT_654] (< 12 years or 
≥ 12 years), and baseline daytime urinar y incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (a total of ≤ 6 epi[INVESTIGATOR_11642] 
> 6 epi[INVESTIGATOR_173460] 2-day diary collection period). 
Patients will participate in the study until one of the following exit criteria is met, whichever 
occurs first: 
• patient has qualified for retreatment (retr eatment to occur in the extension study 
191622-121,  for patients who elect and qualify to enroll),  
• patient has completed 48 weeks after trea tment (BOTOX injection), if qualification 
for retreatment does not occur (i.e., completes the 48 week visit), or 
• patient prematurely di scontinues the study

Study 191622-120 Analysis Plan 
GDD-BSP-T-001 v2014.6  6 In this study, patients are evaluated at scheduled visits at 2, 6, and 12 weeks after 
treatment/injection (week 2, 6 and 12 visits).  After the week [ADDRESS_397910]. The pr imary efficacy assessment is daytime urinary 
incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_322339]. 
2. Analysis Populations and Data Conventions 
2.1 Analysis Populations 
Patients in this study are randomized to one of three treatment groups, namely, 50, 100 or 
200 U BOTOX treatment groups. Within each randomization group, the dose that is actually 
received by a patient can vary due to the dose limit of 6 U/kg (i.e., the dose is adjusted based 
on the patient’s weight). Table 1  presents the BOTOX treatment arms to be used for analysis, 
if different than randomized.

Study 191622-120 Analysis Plan 
GDD-BSP-T-001 v2014.6  7 In order to maintain blinding of the BOTOX dose received, the drug is  reconstituted by [CONTACT_322355] (IDR) base d on randomization assigned by [CONTACT_54537]/IWRS 
(which also includes the patient’s weight as provided in IVRS/IWRS).  Study drug 
accountability and reconstitution records are th en reviewed and confirmed by [CONTACT_322356] (IDM).  If an incorrect dose was administered, the IDM will complete the “Incorrect Unit Dose Administered” form and the “incorrect unit dose administered” will be 
entered into the electronic case report form (eCRF).  
Patients will be assigned to actual treatmen t groups for analysis purposes as follows: 
1. If the “incorrect unit dose administered” is  populated in the eCRF, this dose will be 
used and adjusted per Table 1  above. 
2. If the “incorrect unit dose administered” is not populated in the eCRF, then the randomized dose (ie, 50U, 100U, or 200U) and the patient’s weight recorded in 
IVRS/IWRS at the time of randomization will be utilized to determine the actual dose 
administered as described in section 12.1 of the study protocol.  The dose administered will then be adjusted per Table 1  above. 
Two populations will be used in the statistical anal ysis of this study:  modified intent-to-treat 
(mITT) and safety. 
The analysis of demographics, baseline characteristics and efficacy will be based on the 
mITT population while the safety population will be used for all safety analysis. 
Modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) Population 
The mITT population will include all randomi zed patients who received BOTOX injection 
on Day 1 (randomization day and date of injectio n).  Patients in the mITT population will be 
analyzed on an as-randomized basis, except for patients who received less than their 
randomized dose due to the patient’s weight and the dose limit of 6 U/kg (a s per the protocol).  
Such patients will be grouped to the nearest dose group based on the dose they actually received.  Thus, patients that receive a dose of < 75 U will be assigned to the 50 U treatment 
group, patients that received a dose in the range of ≥ 75 U and < 150 will be assigned to the 
100 U treatment group, while patients that received ≥  150 U will be assigned to the 200 U 
group ( Table 1).  Patients who received a different dose for any other reason than the 6 U/kg 
cap, will be analyzed according to the dose they were randomized to.

Study 191622-120 Analysis Plan 
GDD-BSP-T-001 v2014.6  8 Safety Population 
The safety population will include all patient s who underwent the treatment procedure and 
received study drug on randomization/day 1.  Safety analyses will be based on actual 
treatment received.  Patients who received  a different dose than the dose they were 
randomized to (as a result of either the 6 U/kg weight cap or any other reason) will be 
grouped according to the nearest dose group based on the actual dose received, as presented 
in Table  1.  
2.1.[ADDRESS_397911], the actual 
strata will be used instead of th e strata assigned at randomization.

GDD-BSP-T-001 v2014.6  9 2.3 Data Conventions 
The following data conventions will be applied to all analyses. 
• A patient's weight adjusted dose will be derived using the randomization information 
and the patient's actual weight provided in IVRS/IWRS at baseline.  
• Unless stated otherwise, all statistical tests will be at a 2-sided significance level of 
 0.05. P-values ≤ 0.050 will be considered statistically significant. 
• Since the qualification for retreatment ma y occur anytime from week 12 onwards, no 
statistical tests for pairwise comparison of  treatment groups will be performed for any 
visit beyond week 12. 
• The type III sums of squares will be used  for all analysis of covariance models 
(ANCOV A). 
• The variance for Kaplan-Meier estimates will be calculated using Greenwood’s 
formula. 
• Descriptive statistics for continuous variable s include the sample size (N), mean, SD, 
median, minimum (min), first quartile (Q1), third quartile (Q3),  and maximum (max). 

Allergan Confidential  Study 191622-120  Analysis Plan 
Study 191622-120 Analysis Plan 
GDD-BSP-T-001 v2014.6  10 • Summary statistics for categorical variables include the sample size (N), frequency 
 count and percent. 
• The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) dictionary will be used 
to code all adverse events (AEs) and medical history. 
• World Health Organization Drug Dictionary Enhanced (WHO DDE) preferred name 
[CONTACT_322372]. 
• Study duration from day 1 (injecti on date) will be calculated as:  
Study day in study = visit date –  day 1 date + 1. 
• For vital signs and laboratory summary tables, baseline is defined to be the last assessment prior to BOTOX injection. 
• For by [CONTACT_765], vital signs and laboratory summa ry tables, there will also be a summary 
of the last post-baseline assessment.  
• The algorithm presented in Table 3 , together with the rules below will be used to 
impute incomplete or missing dates for adve rse events and medications as follows:  
(a) AE start dates will be imputed as the minimum of the following: 
• initial imputed date, where target  date = study drug injection date 
• complete end date 
(b) Medication start dates will be imputed as the minimum of the following: 
•  initial imputed date, where target date = study drug injection date – 1 
• complete end date 
(c) AE and Medication end dates will be imputed as the minimum of the following: 
•  initial imputed date, where target date = study exit date + 30 
• death date 
• Concomitant medication will be classified using the following convention: 1) If the start date of medication is after or on study drug injection date, then it will be counted 
as concomitant medication; 2) If the start date of medication is prior to the study drug 
injection date and stop date is on or afte r study drug injection da te, then it will be 
counted as both prior medication and concomitant medication.

YYYY = available start date year; MM = available start date month; LD = last day of the month. 
 
2.3.1 Diary Data Conventions 
• For baseline and post-treatment visits, analyses will be based on the diary data collected over two consecutive days. “Wak e time information” will be collected for 
each diary day including the time the patient woke up in the morning and presence/absence of night time leaking by [CONTACT_21317] (from the previous night), as well 
as the time and volume of urine collected on  the first morning catheterization. “Day 
time information” will be collected for each diary day including date, time, and type of voiding epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] [leak by [CONTACT_21317] (i.e. urinar y incontinence), urinated with catheter, 
urinated without catheter (i.e. voluntary void)] for each daytime epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] (from time 
after waking up to start the day and doing the first morning catheterization, and going 
to bed to sleep for the night). Lastly, “bed  time information” will be collected for each 
diary day including the time the patient went to bed for the night. 
• Note:  Recording day time urinary events should begin after  the 1
st morning 
catheterization (as the urine expelled is from  the previous night).  In cases where 
the patient erroneously re-e ntered the first morning cat heterization event as a day 
time event (ie, the time of 1st morning catheterization and the time of the first day 
time urinary event are the same), the event will not be included in the analysis for 
day time events.  
• The visit windows  will be used to derive a patient’s diary 
parameters for each visit.  
• A valid diary day is defined as a day wher e there are one or more urinary epi[INVESTIGATOR_322340] (incontinence, catheterization,  or voluntary void) during the daytime 

Allergan Confidential  Study 191622-[ADDRESS_397912] one valid diary day 
within a visit window, the 2-day frequenc y of daytime urinary incontinence will 
be prorated with the value from the valid diary day. 
• If  there are no valid diary days within the window, the 2-day diary data will be 
set as missing for the visit. 
• For baseline and post-treatment visits, th e 2-day diary will be determined based 
on the following algorithm: 
1) Apply visit windows  which are based on days from the 
date of study drug injection. 
2) Determine the time of the first daytime  urinary epi[INVESTIGATOR_322341] (in the example below, 8:30 am on May 4).  Count forward two 
consecutive daytime  dairy collection days. Note: the second daytime period 
should end within the window, i.e., prior to  or on the last day specified in the 
window definition; otherwise, the nighttime or daytime data will not be used for the corresponding window.  For baselin e diary data, any urinary epi[INVESTIGATOR_322342] w ill be counted towards the baseline diary 
data. 
3)  Using the example below, the first daytime period (used to determine normalized day time period) starts with a wake time of 7:30 am on May 4 and 
ends with a bedtime of 11:00 pm (going to  bed to sleep for the night).  The 
bedtime for May 4 starts at 11:00 pm a nd ends at the wake time of 12:00 pm 
on May 5.  The second daytime period starts on 12:00 pm on May 5 (wake 
time)
 and ends at 1:00 am May 6.  Note that the wake time and bedtime can go 
over 2 calendar days.  In the data set, fo r a given daytime, even if the daytime 
period goes over 2 calendar dates it will be recorded under the same calendar 
date. The time of the day will be used to accurately attribute the date of the event.

• Missing daily average frequency of epi[INVESTIGATOR_322343]-missing values at baseline 
within the same treatment group.  For th e primary analysis, for scheduled diary 
assessments up to the week [ADDRESS_397913] (LOCF) approach .  For scheduled diary assessments after 
the week 6 visit, no imputation method will be applied.  
• The daily frequency of daytime urinary incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_322344] 
a 12-hour daytime period. The following normalization algorithm will be used: 
1) Apply visit window  which uses days from treatment as 
reference. 
2) Identify wake time and bedtime within the visit window. Daytime period (in hours) 
is determined by [CONTACT_322357]. 
3) Using the example below, [ADDRESS_397914] daytime period of 16 hours (7:00am to 11:00pm), and 7 epi[INVESTIGATOR_322345] 14 hours (8:30am to 10:30pm).   Nighttime

On a given day, the number of daytime urinary incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_322346] a 12-hour daytime period will be calculated by  
 
,  
 
which, in the example, adjusts to 3 (= (12/16) × 4) and 6 (=(12/14 )× 7) 
normalized urinary incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], respectively. The daily average frequency of daytime urinary incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_322347] a given visit window will be 4. 5 (= (3 + 6)/2) in this example. 
 
• If wake time is missing, the missing wake time will be imputed by [CONTACT_322358].  If both the wake time and the first 
morning catheterization are missing then the morning wake time will be imputed by [CONTACT_322359][INVESTIGATOR_322348] a ny type recorded on that day or 7:[ADDRESS_397915] urinary epi[INVESTIGATOR_322349] 10:00 pm,

Study 191622-120 Analysis Plan 
GDD-BSP-T-001 v2014.6  18 5.1 Collection of Primary Efficacy Measurement(s) and Derivation of 
Primary Efficacy Variable(s) 
The primary efficacy variable is the change from  baseline to post-treatment in the normalized 
daily average frequency of daytime urinary in continence epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (daytime is defined as the 
time between waking up to start the day and 1st morning catheterization, and going to bed to 
sleep for the night). The daily average frequenc y of daytime urinary incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_322351] a 2-day 
bladder diary divided by 2, and baseline freque ncy is defined as the daily average frequency 
of epi[INVESTIGATOR_322352] (ie, obtained from 
the screening diary).  
Each daytime period recorded in the bladde r diary is normalized to represent a 12-hour 
period to account for differing durations of th e daytime period between and within different 
patients (see  Section 2.3 for further details). Furthermore, if there is just 1-day of valid 
bladder diary data, this will be used as th e daily average frequency of daytime urinary 
incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (see Section 2.3 for further details). 
The primary time point for this change from baseline endpoint will be week 6 posttreatment. 
5.2 Primary Efficacy Analyses 
5.2.1 Primary Analyses of Primary Efficacy Variable 
For each of the BOTOX doses of 200 U and 100 U, the null hypothesis is that there is no 
difference between that dose group and the 50 U BOTOX dose group in mean change from 
baseline in daily average frequency of daytime urinary incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_322353] 6. The 
alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference in mean change from baseline in daily 
average frequency of daytime urinary inc ontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_322354] 50 U dose group at week 6. 
The hypotheses will be tested using an ANCOV A model with baseline value as covariate and 
treatment group, age (< 12 years or ≥ 12 years), baseline daytime urinary incontinence 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (a total of ≤ 6 epi[INVESTIGATOR_11642] > 6 epi[INVESTIGATOR_173460] 2-day diary collection period), and 
use of anticholinergic therapy (no/yes) at baseline (on day of inj ection) as factors. 
Furthermore, the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method of imputation will be used 
to impute missing week 6 assessments. The fitted model will be used to derive the adjusted 
mean treatment differences in the primary variable (least-squares [LS] mean difference) and

5.3 Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
The following secondary efficacy variables that are based on patient diary data will be 
assessed. 
• the percentage of patients that have a ≥50%, ≥ 75%, ≥ 90%, and 100% reduction from 
baseline in the number of normalized daytime urinary incontinence epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] 
• change from baseline in average urine volume at first morning catheterization (mL) 
• presence or absence of night time urinary incontinence 
The following secondary urodynamics efficacy va riables will be assessed at week 6 
posttreatment 
• change from baseline in maximum cystometric capacity (mL) (MCC) 
• The proportion of patients with presence of  involuntary detrusor contraction (IDC) 
• if an IDC is present, change from baselin e in maximum detrusor pressure during the 
first IDC (Pdet Max1stIDC ) (cm H 2O) 
• change from baseline in maxi mum detrusor pressure (Pdet Max) (cm H 2O)  during the 
storage phase  
• if leak occurs, change from baseline in de trusor leak point pressure (DLPP) (cm H 2O) 

Allergan Confidential  Study 191622-[ADDRESS_397919] Morning Catheterization (mL) 
For urine volume at first morning catheterizati on (mL), the mean baseline, mean raw values 
and mean change from baseline at each visi t and associated 95% CI for the mean change 
from baseline will be derived for each treatment group. For visits up to week 12 
posttreatment, an ANCOV A model similar to th e primary ANCOV A model will be fitted to 
the change from baseline value. The model will include the baseline value as covariate and  treatment groups, age (< 12 years or ≥ 12 years), baseline daytime urinary incontinence 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (a total of ≤ 6 epi[INVESTIGATOR_11642] > 6 epi[INVESTIGATOR_173460] 2-day diary collection period), and 
anticholinergic therapy use(no/yes)  at baseline as factors. The resulting adjusted treatment 
difference (LS mean difference) and associated 95% CI of the treatment difference in mean 
change from baseline will be derived for the comparison of the higher BOTOX dose groups 
versus the 50 U BOTOX group.  
5.3.3  Presence or Absence of Nigh t Time Urinary Incontinence  
For the analysis of night time urinary incontin ence, the numbers (percentage) of patients who 
experienced night time urinary incontinence on 0, 1, or 2 nights will be presented at study baseline and at each visit.

GDD-BSP-T-001 v2014.6  22 5.3.4 Analysis of Urodynamics Parameters 
Urodynamics parameters are only assessed at  screening (baselin e) and at week 6 
posttreatment.  For urodynamic parameters only the central reviewer's assessment will be 
analyzed.  
For the following urodynamics parameters: 
1. maximum cystometric capacity (mL) (MCC),  
2. maximum detrusor pressure (Pdet Max) during the storage phase (cm H 2O),  
3. if IDC is present, maximum detrusor pressure (Pdet Max1stIDC ) during the first IDC (cm 
H2O), and  
4. if leak occurs, detrusor leak point pressure (DLPP) (cm H 2O) ,  
values at the two visits (baseline and week 6) and change from baseline values for week 6 
posttreatment will be summarized. Furthermore, an ANCOV A model will be fitted and used 
to derive adjusted treatment means and treatm ent difference estimates for the comparison of 
the lower dose (50 U) with the higher BOTOX dose groups. The explanatory variables in the 
model will include the same explanatory variables listed for the primary efficacy variable 
analysis however, the covariate will be the baseline effect for each parameter under 
consideration. 
For urodynamics parameter #3, change from baseline value can only be derived when  
maximum detrusor pressure (Pdet Max1stIDC ) during the first IDC is present at both baseline and 
post-baseline visit (ie, an IDC occurs at bot h baseline and at week 6).  Similarly, for 
urodynamics parameter #4, change from baseline value can only be derived if a leak occurs 
during the urodynamics procedure at  both baseline and week 6 visit. In both cases (analysis 
of #3 and #4), if  less than 25% of the mITT pa tients have change from baseline values, the 
ANCOV A model may not be fitted.  
The number (percentage) of patients with presen ce  of an IDC at baseline and at week 6 
posttreatment will be summarized by [CONTACT_6660]. Associated 95% confidence interval 
will also be generated. The difference at baseline and at week [ADDRESS_397920] will be evaluated by [CONTACT_322366]. 
• Time between study drug injection (inject ion) and patient's first request for 
retreatment

Study 191622-120 Analysis Plan 
GDD-BSP-T-001 v2014.6  25 • Time between study drug injection (inject ion) and qualification for retreatment 
(study exit date for patients that requ ested and qualified for retreatment) 
Patients who did not request retreatment will be treated as censored at the time of study exit. 
For each treatment group, the Kaplan-Meier su rvival methodology will be used to estimate 
the median time to request for re-treatment. Furthermore, the 25th and 75th percentiles of the 
time to request for re-treatment will be estimated. The associated 95% CIs will also be 
presented for each treatment group. The proportion of patients requesting re-treatment during 
the study will also be presented. 
The time to qualification for re-treatment will be summarized in a similar manner.

6.2 Adverse Events  
Adverse events (AEs) will be coded by [CONTACT_322367] (MedDRA).  
Pre-treatment AEs are AEs that have start date  on or after the signi ng of consent form and 
prior to the BOTOX injection. 
An AE will be considered a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) if it was present after 
the first dose of study treatment or was presen t before the date of the first dose of study 
treatment and increased in severity or became serious after the first dose of study treatment.  
The number and percentage of patients re porting TEAE in each treatment group will be 
tabulated by [CONTACT_322368], by [CONTACT_6657], 
and further categorized by [CONTACT_322369] l relationship to the study drug and study drug 
injection procedure. If more than [ADDRESS_397921] se verity for the summarization by 
[CONTACT_322370].

Sections Revision Rationale 
 
Section 2.1: 
Analysis Populations The following text:  
“If the “incorrect unit dose administered” is not 
populated in the eCRF, then the randomized dose (ie, 
50U, 100U, or 200U) and the patient’s weight at the 
screening visit will be utilized to determine the actual dose administered as described in section 12.1 of the study 
protocol.” 
 
was replaced with  “If the “incorrect unit dose administered” is not 
populated in the eCRF, then the randomized dose (ie, 
50U, 100U, or 200U) and the patient’s weight recorded in 
IVRS/IWRS at the time of randomization will be utilized to 
determine the actual dose administered as described in 
section 12.1 of the study protocol.”  To clarify that 
patients weight used in this derivation will be taken from 
IVRS/IWRS records. 
Section 2.3.1: 
Diary Data Convention The text in the first bullet point was modified to make it clearer to understand.   The following new paragraph was added: 
Note:  Recording day time urinary events should begin 
after the 1
st morning catheterization (as the urine expelled 
is from the previous night).  In cases where the patient erroneously re-entered the first morning catheterization 
event as a day time event (ie, the time of [ADDRESS_397922] day time urinary 
event are the same), the event will not be included in the 
analysis for day time events.  
 
 
To clarify how this 
diary entry errors made by [CONTACT_322371]. 
Section 5.3.3: Presence or 
Absence of 
Night Time Urinary 
Incontinence  Deleted the following text: 
For each visit there will be two sets of percentages. The 
first set of percentage will be for patients that have just 
one valid diary day and the sec ond set will be for patients 
that have two diary days i.e., the numerator for the percentage calculation will be the patients that have the given number of diary days. Makes it much easier to understand the 
summary to be 
presented here.

Study Protocol and Statistical A nalysis Plan  
 
Date 2/13/[ADDRESS_519434] -time wheezing presumed to be bronchiolitis; again, no significant 
difference was found.xii  However steroids are largely ineffective for bronchiolitis,  so it is impossible to 
apply the results of that study to the treatment of asthmaxiii. 
 
II. SPECIFIC AIMS   
 
Our aim is to compare the effect of single versus repeated doses of oral dexamethasone on the rate of 
treatment failure in patients treated for a mild  to moderate acute asthma exacerbation in the pediatric 
emergency department of an urban community hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].   
 
III. SUBJECT SELECTION  
 
Subjects will be  children aged [ADDRESS_519435].   
 
Exclusion Criteria will include:  
1. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_411888]  
2. Course of oral steroids within the past month  
3. History of chronic pulmonary disease including cystic fibrosis or bronchopulmonary dysplasia,  
[LOCATION_001] Methodist Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  
 4. History of any other severe chronic metabolic, endocrine, neuromuscular, cardiac, rena l or hepatic 
disorder  
5. Severe asthma exacerbation (PIS >11 )   
6. Girls and women over [ADDRESS_519436] symptoms consistent with an asthma 
exacerbation will be seen as soon as possible after arrival by a provider [ NP, resident, attending, fellow or 
4th year medical student].  The severity of their exacerbation will be determined using a validated clinical 
assessment tool, the Pulmonary Index Score.  The PIS will be charted in the medica l record and used to 
select an appropriate clinical pathway corresponding to the severity of exacerbation.  As part of the 
standardization effort, all patients with a mild or moderate exacerbation [ PIS ≤ 11  ] will receive oral 
dexamethasone 0.6 mg/kg up t o [ADDRESS_519437] the patient’s name, contact [CONTACT_3031], 
preferred method of contact, primary care physician’s name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_411894] a locked file cabinet.  The patient’s ED provider 
will place a computerized medication order for study medication.   
 
Once a medication order is place, our pharmacy will randomize the patient to either the treatment or control 
groups.  They will pr epare a syringe with the appropriate volume of dexamethasone injectable solution 
mixed with cherry syrup, or an equivalent volume of taste - and texture -matched placebo.  This will be 
labeled with the patient’s name [CONTACT_411897].  The pharmacy will 
maintain records of group allocation in a locked and sealed location, which will be broken only in the event 
of a significant adverse event, for planned interim analysis and after enrollment has been completed.   
  
In the event th at a caregiver loses the medication prior to administration, or the child vomits it at home, 
they will be instructed to call the ED, further management will be at the discretion of the provider present 
at that time, and the patient data will analyzed  with their initial group under the intention -to-treat principle.  
 
[LOCATION_001] Methodist Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_411889] a letter to take to their primary care physician, or any other follow -up provider, 
explaining their participation in the study and a request to contact [CONTACT_411895] -up visit.  
 
At the time of discharge families will be given a symptom questionnaire (Patient Self Assessment Score, 
PSAS) to complete every 24 hours.  They will be asked to return to Emergency Department on day 5 for re -
examination.  They will be seen by a study investigator; a repeat PIS will be calculated at that time.  A brief 
structured questionnaire will be administered asking about presence of any primary outcomes.  If the family 
does not return for 5 day follow -up, they will be contact[CONTACT_411896] - phone, text message or e -
mail the same questionnaire will be administered.  
 
VI. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 
● Primary Outcome:  
○ Treatment failure  as defined by [CONTACT_39132]: unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_411890]; unplanned return to emergency department, urgent care or clinic for 
asthma symptoms; or prescription of additional course of steroids within 5 days of 
enrollment.  
  
●.○.1.  Relative Risk of treatment failure between the experimental and control groups  
 
●.○.2.  Relative risk of treatment failure in each of the predefined subgroups (mild and 
moderate)  
●.○.3.  Time to treatment failure will be compared between the two groups using the 
Kaplan M eier analysis  
 
● Secondary Outcomes:  
● Change in PIS between initial and follow -up visit  
● Change in PSAS over time -   
● Presence of adverse events including vomiting in the ED or at home, symptomatic 
hyperglycemia, subjective behavior change or subjective insomnia -  
● Caregiver preference for treatment regimen compared to prior steroid treatments.  
 
Categorical variables will be analyzed with the Chi -squared test.  
Continuous variables will be analyzed with the Mann -Whitney -U test  
Survival curves will be analyzed with t he Kaplan -Meier test  
 
● Sample Size and Power Analysis  
○ We estimate a sample size of [ADDRESS_519438] a 9% difference in 
treatment failure at a significance of 0.05, inferring effect size from prior published 
studies comparing various dosing regimen of dexamethasone to prednisolone.   
 
● VII RISKS & DISCOMFORTS  
○ Significant side effects of single or multiple doses of dexamethasone are rare, and do not 
vary significantly from those experienced with prednisolone, with the exception of 
vomiting which is less common with dexamethasone.8 
 
 
 
VIII.      BENEFITS & RISKS  
Potential benefits to study participants include potentially decreased exposure to steroids, decreased 
caregiver burden, increased ease of medication compliance.  Potential risks to participants include toxicities 
associated with dexamethasone, potentially  increased risk of treatment failure, potential need for unplanned 
or emergent return to ED or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].   
[LOCATION_001] Methodist Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_411891].  The ideal regi men would be that which involves the fewest doses of medication and 
least burden on caregivers in terms of having to fill prescriptions and administer medications to often -
recalcitrant patients without an increased risk of relapse or treatment failure.   
 
 
IX. MONITORING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
a. Independent monitoring of source data  
- Not applicable  
b. Safety monitoring (e.g., Data Safety Monitoring Board, etc.)  
- A Data Safety Monitoring Board will be composed of the Principle Investigator, 
Departmental Research Coordinator and Pediatric Emergency Medicine physicians to 
investigate any serious side effects that occur during the study.  
c. Outcomes monitoring  
- Preliminary statistics will be computed when we have enrolled 50% of the expected number 
of participants, if a significant difference ( RR > 4)  in favor of the control group is found 
in terms of the primary endpoint, the study will be ended at that point..  
d. Adverse event reporting guidelines  
- Any unexpected or serious adverse events will be reported to the IRB, any security breaches 
will be reported to Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_411892].

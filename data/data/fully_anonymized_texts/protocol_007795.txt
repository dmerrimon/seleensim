 Screening p eriod ( 3-35 days)  
 Open -label period (12 weeks)  
 Double -blind period (up to 26 weeks)  
 Safety f ollow -up period (approximately 4 w eeks)  
The schedule of assessments is provided in Table  S–1 and Table  S–2. 
Screening Period ( 3-35 Days ) 
During the screening period, subjects will be assessed for study 
eligibility and prohibited medications will be discontinued when 
medically appropriate. Subjects  and partner/caregivers will also receive 
a standardized psychosocial therapy training.  
Investigators should not withdraw a subject ’s prohibited medication for 
the purpose of enrolling them into the study . Medications should be 
discontinued only if it is d eemed clinically appropriate to do so.  
Open -label Period (12 Weeks)  
During the open -label period, eligible subjects will begin receiving 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] 34 mg once daily (QD) beginning at Week 0 (open -label 
Baseline); subsequent clinic visits will occur at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. 
Dose adjustments are permitted at scheduled or unscheduled visits until 
Week 4. After Week 4, the subject ’s dose will remain fixed at either 
[ADDRESS_872850] meet the 
following response  criteria at Weeks 8 and 12:  
 Subject experiences a ≥30% reduction (improvement) from Week 0 
(open -label Baseline ) on the SAPS -H+D Total Sc ore AND  
 Subject has a CGI-I score of 1 (very much improved) or 2  (much 
improved) , relative to Week 0 ( open -label Baseline ) 
A subject who does not meet response  criteria at Week 8 and 12 will be 
withdrawn from study drug and enter the safety follow -up period of the 
study . 
Double -blind Period (up to 26 Weeks)  
Randomization will occur at the double -blind Baseline visit (Week  12). 
Subjects will be randomly assigned 1:1 to continue their pi[INVESTIGATOR_650877] (34  mg or 20  mg) or matching placebo . Randomization will be 
stratified by : 
1. Most likely dementia subtype or most prominent cause of 
dementia :

The p rotocol -defined relapse criteria for dementia -related psychosis are: 
 Subject experiences a ≥30% increase (worsening) from Week 12 
(double -blind Baseline) on the SAPS -H+D Total Score AND has a 
CGI-I score of 6 (much worse) or 7 (very much worse) , relative to 
the double -blind Baseline ; OR  
 Subject is treated with an antipsychotic (other than pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256]) 
for dementia -related delusions and/or hallucinations ; OR 
 Subject stops study drug or withdraws from study for lack of 
efficacy (as reported by [CONTACT_3433] e subject or  study partner/caregiver ) or 
the Investigator  discontinues study drug due to lack of efficacy; OR 
 Subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_650878] -related psychosis  
Relapse criteria will be assessed weekly for the first 2 weeks after 
randomization (Weeks 13 and 14), every [ADDRESS_872852] s who discontinue the study between randomization and  
Week 38  should complete an  ET visit, if possible , and an indepe ndent 
adjudication committee (IAC) will review those cases that occurred 
before the study discontinuation date to determine if protocol -defined 
relapse criteria were met.  
Safety Follow -up Period ( Approximately 4 Weeks)  
Approximately [ADDRESS_872853] will review safety 
information on a regular basis throughout the study.  
Pharmacokinetic 
Assessments  During the open -label period, PK samples will be collected at Weeks 0, 
8, and 12.  
During the double -blind period, PK samples will be collected at Weeks 
13, 22, and 38/EOT.

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1  Date: [ADDRESS_872854] 2018  
 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 13 of 100 Pharmacokinetic  samples will also be collected, if possible,  at any ET 
visit or the visit immediately following an y SAE or following an AE 
leading to discont inuation.  
For all PK samples (scheduled and unscheduled), the dates and times of 
administration of the last [ADDRESS_872855] dose of study drug prior t o 
the SAE or AE should also be recorded.  
Optional 
Pharmacogenomic 
Assessments  A blood sample will be collected at Visit 2 ( open -label Baseline ) or later 
from consenting subjects for potential future pharmacogenomics 
analyses (where local regulations permit).  
Data for genetic analyses  will be anonymized, as is the customary 
approach according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  
Sample Size 
Calculations  The sample size calculation was based on the following assumptions: a 
placebo relapse event rate of 60% over 26 weeks; a pi[INVESTIGATOR_650879] 35% over 26  weeks; a dropout rate of 25% over 
26 weeks; an overall two -sided alpha level of 0.05; use of a one -sided 
(0.025) O ’Brien -Fleming stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_650880] a single 
interim analysis that will be performed when one half of the total 
planned number of post -randomization relapse events have occurred; 
and a power of 90% . The total number o f post -randomization relapse 
events required at the final analysis is 75 and the calculated sample siz e 
is 89 in each of the two treatment groups (giving a total of 178) . 
Study enrollment will be closed when approximately [ADDRESS_872856] occurred. In the event that the 
randomization rate is lower than anticipated and/or the relapse event 
rate is lower than anticipated, the number enrolled and randomize d may 
be increased up to a maximum of [ADDRESS_872857] occurred . The s tudy 
may be terminated early if the interim analysis results meet prespecified  
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_650881], if there are exactly 38 relapse events at 
the interim analysis,  the significance level will be 0.0054. If the study is 
not stopped early and the f inal analysis includes exactly 75 relapse 
events (including the 38 events from the interim analysis), the 
significance level for the final analysis will be 0.0479. The actual 
significance levels to be used at the interim and final analyses will be 
calculat ed based on the actual number of events observed. The interim 
efficacy analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_55467] . 
Investigators, subjects, and Sponsor personnel will remain blinded 
throughout the study.

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 14 of 100 Statistical 
Methods  The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the Intent -to-treat (ITT)  
population, defined as all randomized subjects . The time from 
randomization to relapse in the double -blind period will be compared 
between treatment groups using a Cox regression model with effects for 
treatment group, dementia subtype, and region. The nominal p -value, 
hazard ratio, and 95% confidence interval will be reported. Subjects 
who discontinue early or complete the study without having 
experienced a relapse event will be censored at the time of last 
assessment for relapse.  The key secondary endpoint of time from 
randomization to discontinuation  from the double -blind period  for any 
reason (other than termination of the study by [CONTACT_1034]) will be 
analyzed using the same methodology as for the primary endpoint.  
A hierarchical testing procedure will be used to control the overall 
type I error rat e for the primary  and key secondary  endpoints.  
Exploratory Efficacy Analyses  
All exploratory efficacy endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_569698] . For all exploratory SAPS endpoints, 
CGI-S, ZBI, KSS, and EQ -5D-5L; the change from double -blind 
Baseline  will be analyzed using mixed model repeated measures 
(MMRM) . The independent variables in the model will include the 
following: treatment group (pi[INVESTIGATOR_387379]), visit, treatment 
by [CONTACT_23259], double -blind Baseline  score, double -blind Baseline  
score by [CONTACT_23259], designated  dementia subtype , and region . 
CGI-I will be analyzed using a n MMRM model with the following 
independent variables: treatment group (pi[INVESTIGATOR_387379]), visit, 
treatme nt by [CONTACT_23259], double -blind Baseline  CGI-S score, 
double -blind Baseline  CGI-S score by [CONTACT_23259], designated  
dementia subtype , and region . 
The treatment comparisons will be based on the difference in least 
squares means and will be teste d at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. The 
double -blind Baseline  score is defined as the last value prior to the first 
dose of double -blind study drug.  
In addition to the MMRM analyses  described above , last-observation -
carried -forward analyses will also be performed.  
Descriptive summaries of efficacy endpoints, including the number and 
percent of subjects meeting response criteria, will be provided for the 
open -label period.  
Safety Analyses  
All safety results will be summarized using descriptive statistics . 
Separate summaries will be provided for the open -label and double -
blind periods . The double -blind summaries will be presented by 
[CONTACT_1570] . Adverse events will be classified into standard 
terminology using the Medical Dictionary fo r Regulatory Activi ties. 
Adverse events may also be categorized into categories of special

discontinuation, TEAEs related to study drug, TEAEs by [CONTACT_228647], serious TEAEs, and serious TEAEs related to study dr ug will 
all be summarized . Other TEAEs of special interest may also be 
summarized.  
Descriptive statistics for ECG, vital signs, GCAS, MMSE, ESRS -A 
total score and all subscales, and clinical laboratory parameters, 
including change from Baseline  when applic able, will be tabulated by 
[CONTACT_135355] . Additionally, categorical analyses will 
be conducted on the incidence of subjects with prolonged QTc intervals 
and changes in QTc intervals in accordance with International Council 
for Harmonisation  (ICH) guidelines. The incidence of clinically 
significant changes in selected laboratory parameters will also be 
summarized.  
Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Plasma concentration data for pi[INVESTIGATOR_650882] -279 will be listed 
and summarized using descriptive statistics.  
If data allow, population PK and PK/PD analyses will be performed to 
further characterize the PK profile and exposure response relationship 
of pi[INVESTIGATOR_650883] . The 
results of population PK and PK/PD  modeling will be presented in a 
separate report.  Investigators, subjects, and Sponsor personnel will 
remain blinded to p lasma concentration data from the double -blind 
period  until the unblinding of the clinical database at the end of the 
study.

This document is a research protocol and the described study will be conducted in 
compliance with the protocol  and International Council for Harmoni sation (ICH) Good 
Clinical Practice Guideline (GCP) . All key personnel (all individuals responsible for the 
design and conduct of this study) have completed or will complete human subjects p rotection 
training.  
1.[ADDRESS_872882] notably a decline in cognitive function, 
but with a variety of other manifestations that are rarely confined to one subtype. Alzheimer ’s 
disease (AD) is the most com mon and well -known cause of dementia. Most studies of 
dementia -related psychosis focus on AD. However the various subtypes of dementia have 
more features in common than they have distinguishing them. The current study allows 
enrollment of subjects with psy chosis associated with the most common subtypes of 
dementia: AD, vascular dementia (VaD), Parkinson ’s disease dementia  (PDD) , dementia with 
Lewy bodies (DLB ), and the frontotemporal dementia  (FTD) -spectrum  disorders  (including  
behavioral variant FTD [bvFTD ], progressive supranuclear palsy [PSP], and  corticobasal 
degeneration  [CBD ]). These subtypes of dementia overlap greatly in 1) their clinical 
presentation and nosology and in 2) their pathological findings on autopsy 
(Brenowitz  et al. 2017 ). 
Psychosis is common in dementia . It is typi[INVESTIGATOR_650886], very common in AD (Table  1–1) and 
occurs, although to a lesser degre e, in VaD and the FTD -spectrum  disorders . It is also a 
frequent complication of PDD . The psychosis in most dementias is typi[INVESTIGATOR_650887], with delusions often consisting of the reactions or rationalizations that 
follow . However delusions do occur as distinct phenomena, often taking the form of 
misinterpretations of real or imaginary objects, delusions of infidelity or abandonment, or 
beliefs such as thinking that spouses or relatives are duplicates of the original person . Among 
AD patients, delusions are more common than hallucinations ( Fischer et al. 2016 ; 
Ballard  et al. 1995 ) while hallucinations are more common in patients with DLB  and PDD . 
Patients with psychosis who had a clinical diagnosis of AD are often found on autopsy to 
have Lewy bodies or vascular lesions in addition to amyloidopathy (Fischer et al. 2016; 
Kim et al. 2017 ). Thus , the premortem diagnosis of dementia subtype may be less important 
when treating psychosis in dementia than the confirmation that the psychotic symptoms are 
associated with dementia and not with another psychiatric or medical illness such as 
schizophrenia or delirium.

Dementia -related psychosis  differs substantially from schizophrenia, mania with psychotic 
features, major depressive disorder with psychotic features , and other major mental illnesses . 
Jeste and Finkel ( 2000 ) laid out the ways in which the psychosis of AD is a different 
syndrome than the psychosis of schizophrenia in elderly patients . The same comparison can 
be made between dementia -related psychosis  in general and psychosis in  schizophrenia . 
Because of these differences , the assessment of psychosis in dementia is focused on a narrow 
set of symptoms (e.g., hallucinations and delusions) distinct from schizophrenia 
(Jeste  and Finkel  2000; Cohen -Mansfield and Golander  2011 ). There is evidence that 
psychotic features in AD, DLB, and PDD  are associated with polymorphisms in the 
serotonergic pathway genes, in particular the 5HTTLPR polymorphism in SLA6A4 , which 
codes for the serotonin transporter ( Sweet et al. 2001 ; Quaranta et al. 2009 ; 
DeMichele -Sweet  and Sweet  2010 ; Creese et al. 2014 ). 
Treatment of dementia -related  psychosis represents an area of high unmet need . Clinical 
experience and clinical trial data with atypi[INVESTIGATOR_650888] ( Devan and et al. 
2012 supplementary material ; DeDeyn et al. 1999 ; Devanand et al. 1998 ; Katz et al. 1999 ; 
Street et al. 2000 ). However, the CATIE -AD study concluded that the adverse effects of 
risperidone, olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] , and quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_650889] . Although the 
atypi[INVESTIGATOR_650890], adverse effects limited their 
overall effectiveness . The authors stated that use of these agents may be restricted to patients 
who have few or no side effects and for whom benefits can be discerned  (Schneider  et al. 2006 ).

1.4 Study Rationale  
As discussed above, dementia -related psychosis is an area of high unmet need. Psychosis is a 
common occurrence in the disease evolution of patients with dementia. The reported 
prevalence of psychotic symptoms in patients with dementia ranges from ~20 % to 90%. In 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_650899], currently  there is no pharmacologic treatment approved 
for dementia -related psychosis. Aty pi[INVESTIGATOR_650900] . 
Psychotic symptoms found in the various subtypes of dementia are similar to each other and 
quite different from the psyc hotic symptoms of major mental il lnesses such as schizophrenia. 
The clinical management of dementia -related psychosis does not differ among subtypes of 
dementia. The s ubtypes of dementia themselves overlap both clinically and pathologically. 
Most patients with dementia receive their diagnosis without further specification of dementia 
subtype.  
Clinical data presented above show p imavanserin to be  effective in the acute treatment of 
hallucinations and delusions in subjects  with PDP. Positive Phase 2 data in an acute treatment 
Study ACP -103-045 Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1  Date: [ADDRESS_872893] group of subjects with dementia -related psychosis.  
The relapse prevention design of this study maximizes the dur ation of exposure to  a 
potentially  effective treatment and minimizes the duration of exposure to ineffective 
treatment ( Temple and Ellenberg 2000 ; US FDA 2012a ). Enrichment is a powerful design to 
demonstrate a drug ’s effectiveness using clinical trial data. Further more , it is an efficient 
design to determine whether a new drug is safe and effective for its intended use in a 
population with serious illness that lacks good treatment alternatives.  
The advant ages of the relapse prevention design stem from the fact that all subjects will 
receive open -label pi[INVESTIGATOR_650901] ’s response to flex ible-dose, open -
label treatment. Subjects who do not respond positively to pi[INVESTIGATOR_650902] e 
open -label period will be withdrawn from the study. Subjects who respond positively (are 
stabilized according to predefined criteria) will be randomized in a doubl e-blind fashion to 
receive either pi[INVESTIGATOR_387379]. During this double -blind period, subjects who meet 
protocol -defined criteria for relapse  will be immediately withdrawn from study drug and 
enter the safety follow -up period of the study . Subjects w ho continue to benefit from 
treatment may continue treatment for the duration of the double -blind period (26  weeks).

3 STUDY DESCRIPTION  
3.1 Overview of Study Design  
This is a Phase 3, prospective, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multicenter, relapse 
prevention study in subjects with dementia -related psychosis.  Approximately 95 study sites 
will participate in this study.  
Study ACP -103-045 Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1  Date: [ADDRESS_872897] 2018  
 
 Confidential and Proprietary Inform ation of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 37 of 100 The duration of participation for individual study subjects will be up to 47 weeks, consisting 
of a screening period of up to 5 weeks; an open -label period of 12 weeks ; a double -blind 
period of up to 26 weeks ; and an approximately 4 -week safety follow -up period .  
The study discontinuation date is defined as  the day on which the S ponsor notifies sites that 
the study is ending (for example, in the event of a positive interim analysis or after 75 
adjudicated relapse events). The study completion date  is defined as  the day on which the last 
subject completes the l ast scheduled assessment (i.e.,  safety follow -up). A study schematic is 
provided in Figure  S–1. 
3.2 Screening Period  (3-35 Days)  
During the screening p eriod , subjects will be assessed for study eligibility and prohibited 
medications will be discontinued  when medically appropriate . Subjects and 
partner/caregivers will also receive a standardized psychosocial therapy  training . 
Investigators should not withdraw a subject ’s prohibited medication for the purpose of 
enrolling them into the study . Medications should be discontinued only if it is deemed 
clinically appropriate to do so.  
3.3 Open -label Period  (12 Weeks)  
During the open -label period, eligible subjects will begin receiving pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256] 34 mg once 
daily (QD) beginning at Week 0 (open -label Baseline ). Subsequent clinic visits will occur at 
Weeks 2, 4, 8, and [ADDRESS_872898] ’s dose will remain fixed at either [ADDRESS_872899] meet the following response criteria 
at Weeks 8 and 12:  
 Subject experiences a ≥30% reduction (improvement) from Week 0 ( open -label Baseline ) 
on the SAPS -H+D Total Score AND  
 Subject has a CGI -I score of 1 (very much im proved) or 2 (much improved), relative to 
Week 0 ( open -label Baseline ) 
A subject who does not meet response criteria at Week s 8 and 12 will be withdrawn from 
study drug and enter the safety follow -up period of the study . 
Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected at Weeks 0, 8, and 12 . Pharmacokinetic samples 
will also be collected, if possible, at any ET visit or the visit immediately following an y SAE 
or following an AE leading to discontinuation .

 Confidential and Proprietary Inform ation of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 38 of 100 3.4 Double -blind Period  (up to 26 Weeks)  
Randomization will occur at the double -blind Baseline visit (Week  12). Subjects will be 
randomly assigned 1:1 to continue their pi[INVESTIGATOR_650905] (34  mg or 20  mg) or matching 
placebo . 
The protocol -defined relapse criteria for dementia -related psychosis are designed to identify 
subjects with an impending relapse or relapse of psychosis:  
 Subject experiences a ≥30% increase (worsening) from Week 12 ( double -blind Baseline ) 
on the SAPS -H+D Total Score AND has a CGI -I score of 6 (much worse) or 7 (ve ry 
much worse), relative to the double -blind Baseline1; OR  
 Subject is treated with an antipsychotic (other than pi[INVESTIGATOR_4256]) for dementia -related 
delusions and/or hallucinations; OR  
 Subject stops study drug or withdraws from study for lack of efficacy, (as reported by [CONTACT_650941]/caregiver) or the Investigator discontinues study drug due to lack 
of efficacy; OR 
 Subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_650906] -related psychosis  
Relapse criteria will be assessed weekly for the first 2 weeks after randomization (Weeks 13 
and 14), every [ADDRESS_872901] who meets any of the relapse 
criteria after randomization will be withdrawn fro m study drug and enter the safety follow -up 
period of the study.  
All subjects who discontinue the study between randomization and Week 38 should complete 
an ET visit, if possible, and an independent adjudication committee  (IAC) will review th ose 
cases that occurred before the study discontinuation date to determine if protocol -defined 
relapse criteria were met.   
Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected at Weeks 13, 22, and 38 /EOT . Pharmacokinetic 
samples will also be collected, if possible, at any ET visit  or the visit immediately following 
any SAE or following an AE leading to discontinuation . 
3.5 Safety Follow -up Period  (Approximately 4 Weeks)  
Approximately [ADDRESS_872902] a safety 
follow -up telephone call visit.  
                                                 
1 For subjects with a Week 12 (double -blind baseline) SAPS H+D total score of “0”, any increase in the 
SAPS  H+D total score at any visit after Week 12 will satisfy the criteria for a >30% increase (worsening).  
Study ACP -103-045 Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1  Date: [ADDRESS_872903] me et all of the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria at Visit 1 (Screening), unless specified otherwise. Subject eligibility criteria 
will be verified prior to Visit 2 (open -label Baseline). This s tudy will randomize up to 
approximately 178 subjects with dementia -related psychosis who meet response criteria 
(Section  3.3). 
In order to participa te in the optional pharmacogenomics component of the study, subjects 
must sign a separate pharmacogenomics informed consent form (ICF), indicating their 
willingness to have their DNA sample stored for future use. Refusal to consent for this 
component does not exclude a subject from participation in the clinical study.  
Protocol waivers for eligibility will not be granted by [CONTACT_387435] . 
If, during the course of a subject ’s post-enrollment  participation in the study, it is disc overed 
that the subject did not me et all eligibility criteria, she or he will be discontinued, unless the 
discontinuation presents an unacceptable medical risk . The justification to allow the subject 
to continue in the study will be made by [CONTACT_1034], with medic al input from the 
Investigator, and will be documented . If allowed to remain in the trial, this will be reported as 
a major protocol deviation and not a waiver.  
Subjects who screen fail will be allowed to rescreen with the permission of the Medical 
Monitor , provided the screen failure was due to a temporary condition that subsequently 
resolved.

the schedule described in Table  S–1 for screening and the open-label period and as described 
in Table  S–2 for the double -blind period . Every reasonable effort should be made to complete 
the required procedures and evaluations at the designated visits and times.  
6.1 Screening Assessments  
6.1.1 Mini -Mental State Examination  
The MMSE  is a brief 30 -point questionnaire that is used to quantitatively assess cognition 
(Folstein et al. 1975 ). The MMSE includes simple questions and problems in a number of 
areas : the time and place of testing, repeating list s of words, arithmetic, language use and 
comprehension, and copying a drawing . The MMSE is being used in this study to screen for 
cognitive impairment  and as a safety measure . 
6.1.[ADDRESS_872927] ’s psychiatric history and treatment (including prior use of and response to 
antipsychotic medication), details of the subject ’s dementia diagnosis and treatment 
(including date of onset of cognitiv e impairment), and details of any neurologic diagnosis and 
treatment.  
Subjects may be asked to provide pharmacy or medical records to substantiate the medication 
history  (Section  4.5). 
Demographic information, including date of birth, sex, race, and ethnicity will be recorded as well  
(as allowed by [CONTACT_427]) . Any new medical condition reported after the ICF has been 
signed will be captured as  an AE . 
6.1.[ADDRESS_872928] or MRI scan completed (a) within the past 3 years AND (b) during or subsequent to 
the onset of dementia . If the Investigator believes a brain MRI with contrast or a head CT 
with contrast is clinically warranted, such a study may be done . The purpose of the scan is to 
evaluate criteria excluding a clinically significant CNS abnormality ( Section  4). 
6.1.4 Psychosocial Therapy  – Non-pharmacologic Intervention Prior to 
Randomization  
During the screening period, the designated study partner/caregiver  will receive instruction 
for engaging in a structured psychosocial interaction with the subject. This psychological 
intervention is intended to aid the subject and caregiver in managing the subject ’s

[CONTACT_650946]. It is recommended 
to conduct the intervention at a frequency of 5 times per week (minimum of 3  times per 
week) for the duration of t he screening period . 
6.2 Efficacy  Assessments  
6.2.1 Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms  – Hallucinations and Delusions  
The SAPS ( Andreasen 1984 ) was designed to measure positive psychotic symptoms . Positive 
symptoms inclu de hallucinations, delusions, abnormalities in language and behavior, and 
disordered thought processes . The SAPS Hallucinations and Delusions subscales (SAPS -H+D) 
will be administered in this study . The Hallucinations and De lusions subscales consist of 
20 items, including global ratings of severity both of hallucinations (H7) and of delusions 
(D13) , respectively . 
All efforts should be made to complete each visit in a single day. In the event of a split visit, the 
CGI-S/CGI -I and the SAPS H+D must be completed on the same day.  
6.2.2 Clinical Global Impression  – Severity  and Clinical Global Impression –
Improvement Scale s 
The CGI -S scale is a clinician -rated, [ADDRESS_872930] ’s hallucinations and delusions at the time of assessment using the Investigator ’s 
judgment and past experience with subjects who have the same disorder  (i.e., dementia -
related psychosis)  (Guy 1976 ). 
The CGI -I is a clinician -rated, [ADDRESS_872931] ’s hallucinations and delusions at the time of assessment, relative to the symptoms at 
Baseline  (relative to open -label Baseline  for response criteria and relative to double -blind 
Baseline  for relapse criteria).  
All eff orts should be made to complete  each visit in a single day. In the event of a split visit, the 
CGI-S/CGI -I and the SAPS H+D must be completed on the same day.  
6.2.3 Zarit Burden Interview  
The Zari t Burden Interview (ZBI) was designed to assess the stress experienced by [CONTACT_650947] ( Zarit et al. 1980 ). The ZBI will be administered as an interview . 
The interview consists of 22 statements reflecti ng how people sometimes feel when taking 
care of another person . The statements are phrased as questions for the family member study 
partner/ caregiver to  indicate how often they feel the way described in the statement . 
Responses are Never, Rarely, Sometime s, Quite Frequently, and Nearly Always.  When the 
study partner/caregiver is not a family  member , this scale will not be completed.

statement that most accurately describes their level of sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_650915].  
6.2.5 EQ-5D-5L 
The EQ -5D-5L is a standardized instrument used as a measure of health outcome 
(Kind  1996 ). It measures 5 dimensions (mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, 
anxiety/depression) each of which has [ADDRESS_872934] 5 l evels of 
severity (no problems/slight problems/moderate problems/severe problems/extreme 
problems) within a particular EQ -5D dimension . The EQ -5D-5L Proxy version 1 will be 
used. For this version, a study partner/ caregiver (the proxy) is asked to rate subject's health -
related quality of life in their (the proxy ’s) opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649].  
6.3 Safety Assessments  
6.3.1 Physical and Neurological Examinations  
A general physical examination will be conducted.  The physical exam procedures will

6.3.4 Electrocardiograms  
All 12 -lead electr ocardiograms (ECGs) will be complete, standardized recordings . The 
subject must rest in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_387382] . ECG tracings (paper or 
electronic) will be reviewed and interpreted by a qualified clinician . All ECGs will be 
centrally r ead; the interpretation by [CONTACT_650948]. ECG tracings and results (ventricular rate, PR, QRS, QT, QTcF and QTcB 
intervals) will be included and summarized in the subject's study records.   
The ECG will b e completed in triplicate at Visit 1 (Screening)  and as a single tracing at all 
other visits . The following conditions apply:  
 If a site performs additional ECGs beyond the set of triplicate ECGs prescribed at 
Screening or the single ECG prescribed at Baseline, the mean QTcF/QRS values of all the 
tracings of adequate quality will be used to determine eligibility.  
 If the mean QTcF  value from the set of  ECGs done at Screening is  prolonged  due to an 
identifiable cause, and it is medically appropriate to address that cause, a repeat set of 
triplicate ECGs may be performed during Screening at the discretion of the Medical 
Monitor. In  this case, the repeat set of triplicate ECGs will be used in determination of 
subject eligibility.  
 At Baseline, a subject may be enrolled based on the machine read of the locally 
completed ECG. If the interpretation of the ECG by [CONTACT_650949], the subject will be discontinued from the study, but 
enrollment of the subject will not be considered a protocol deviation.  
6.3.[ADDRESS_872937] ’s suicidality 
based on the report of the subject, the report of the study partner/caregiver, and the clin ician ’s 
global assessment. Ratings can be 0 (“Absent ”), 1 (“ Feels life is not worth living ”), 
2 (“Wishes he/she  were dead or any thoughts of possible death to self ”), 3 (“ Suicidal ideas or 
gesture ”), or 4 (“Attempt at suicide ”). The Investigator will record a subject rating , a study 
partner/caregiver rating, and a clinician rating.  At Visit  1 (Screening) lifetime s uicidality and 
suicidality for the past 3 months will be assessed and at all other visits, suicid ality since the 
previous visit will be assessed.  
6.3.6 Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale

7 ADVERSE EVENTS  
7.1 Specification of Safety Para meters  
7.1.1 Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as “any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related ” (US FDA 2012 b). 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any 
judgment about causality or seriousness . An AE can arise from any use of the drug 
(e.g.,  off-label use, us e in combination with another drug) and from any route of 
administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the  
drug caused the AE.

 Confidential and Proprietary Inform ation of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 58 of 100 AEs do not include the fo llowing:  
 Stable or intermittent chronic conditions (such as myopia requiring eyeglasses) that are  
present prior to Baseline  and do not worsen during the study  
 Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion) . 
The con dition that leads to the procedure is an AE if not present at the open -label 
Baseline . 
 Overdose of either study drug (see Section  7.4.4 ) or concomi tant medication without any 
signs or symptoms unless the subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115913]  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_120004] (situation where an untoward  
medical occurrence has not occurred)  
 Pregnancy will not be considered an AE, but if it occurs, it will be reported on a 
pregnancy form  
 
Adverse events  will be recorded from the time informed consent is obtained through [ADDRESS_872945] should be referred for appropriate treatment.  
Serious AEs occurring after the safety follow -up period should be reported if in the judgme nt 
of the Investigator, there is “a reasonable possibility ” that the event ma y have been cause d by 
[CONTACT_5257].  
7.1.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
In addition to the severity rating, each AE will be classified by [CONTACT_5256] “serious” 
or “not serious. ” The seriousness of an event will be defined according to the applica ble 
regulations and generally refers to the outcome of an event . An SAE is one that meets one or 
more of the following:  
 Is fatal  
 Is immediately life threatening  
 Results in disability or permanent damage  
 Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
 Prolongs existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1838]  
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect (in an offspring)  
 Is medically significant

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1  Date: [ADDRESS_872946] had an outcome of death  had it 
occurred in a more severe form . 
Definition of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_650918] a full admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_387385] . This 
includes prolongation of an existing inpatient ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_059] .  
Examples of visits to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149691]:  
 Emergency room visits (that do not result in a full hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063])  
 Outpatient surgery  
 Preplanned or elective procedures  
 Protocol procedures  
 Social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], defined as admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1315] a result of inadequate 
family support or care at the subject ’s primary residence  
 
Definition of Disability or Permanent Damage  
Disability is defined as a persistent or sign ificant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions.  
Definition of Medically Significant  
Important medical events (medically significant events) that may not result in death, be life 
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_650919], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition . Examples of 
such events are inte nsive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149694].  
An SAE may also include any other event that the Investigator  or Medical Monitor judges to 
be serious or that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaut ion.

 Confidential and Proprietary Inform ation of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 60 of 100 7.2 Classification of an Adverse Event  
7.2.1 Severity of Event  
The severity of each AE will be graded on a 3 -point scale and reported in det ail as indicated 
on the eCRF:  
 Mild : awareness of sign or symptom but easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort, 
and not interfering with normal everyday activities  
 Moderate : sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities  
 Severe : incapacitating and/or preventing normal everyday activities  
7.2.2 Relationship to Study Drug  
The causality of each AE should be assessed and classified by [CONTACT_5256] “related ” or 
“not related. ” An event is considered related if there is a reasonable po ssibility that the  event 
may have been caused by [CONTACT_542708] (i.e., there are facts, evidence , or 
arguments to suggest possible causation).  
Consider the following when assessing causality:  
 Temporal associations between the agent and the event  
 Response to cessation (de -challenge) or re -challenge  
 Compatibility with known class effect  
 Known effects of concomitant medications  
 Pre-existing risk factors  
 A plausible mechanism  
 Concurrent illnesses  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Duration  
The start and stop dates for AEs will be recorded using the following criteria:

last report or visit.  
Note that any use of medication (and specifically any newly prescribed medication) during 
the course of a study may indicate the occurrence of an AE that  may need to be recorded on 
both the AE and the concomitant medication  page.  
All AEs will be coded by [CONTACT_542709] . 
All AEs, serious and not serious, will be recorded on the AE eCRF page using appropriate 
medical terminology . Severity and relationship to study drug will be assessed by [CONTACT_149726].  
When possible, clinical AEs should be described by [CONTACT_149724] (e.g., 
“cold” or “seasonal allergies ” instead of “runny nose ”). 
All AEs, whether or not rel ated to the study drug , must be fully and completely documented 
on the AE eC RF and in the subject ’s notes.  
7.4.[ADDRESS_872951] be reported within 24  hours of discovery

9.3 Sample Size D etermination  
This study will enroll approximately 356 subjects in order to randomize approximately 
178 subjects with dementia -related psychosis who meet response criteria ( Section  3.3). 
The sample size calculation was based on the following assumptions: a placebo relapse event  
rate of 60% over 26 weeks; a pi[INVESTIGATOR_650923] 35% over 26 weeks  (hazard 
ratio =  0.47) ; a dropout rate of 25% over 26 weeks; an overall two -sided alpha level of 0.05; 
use of a one -sided (0.025) O ’Brien -Fleming stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_650880] a single interim  
analysis that will be performed when one half of the total planned number of post-
randomization relapse events have occurred; and a power of 90% . The total number of post -
randomization relapse events required at the final analysis is 75 and the calculated sample  
size is 89 in each of the two treatment groups (giving a total estimat e of 178  subjects).  
Study enrollment will be closed when approximately [ADDRESS_872957] 
occurred. In the event that the randomization rate is lower th an anticipated and/or the relapse 
event rate is lower than anticipated, the number enrolled and randomized may be increased 
up to a maximum of [ADDRESS_872958] -randomization

A sensitivity analysis will be performed based on the Investigator assessment of relapse. 
Additional sensitivity analyses to assess the potential impact of informative censoring will be 
specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
Kaplan -Meier curves of time from randomization to relapse will be presented for each 
treatment group. In addition, Kaplan -Meier estimates of the proportion of sub jects who 
relapse along with pointwise 95% confidence intervals will be provided for the 26 -week 
double -blind period.  
9.5.2 Key Secondary Analyses  
The key secondary endpoint of time from randomization to discontinuation from the double -
blind period for any reaso n (other than termination of the study by [CONTACT_1034]) will be 
analyzed using the same Cox regression model described above for the primary endpoint  
along with the Kaplan -Meier estimates . 
9.5.3 Exploratory Efficacy Analyses  
All exploratory efficacy endpoints wi ll be summarized by [CONTACT_21753] . For all exploratory SAPS  endpoints , CGI -S, ZBI, KSS , and EQ -5D-5L, the change 
from double -blind Baseline  will be analyzed using mixed model repeated measures 
(MMRM) . The independent variables in the model will include the following: treatment 
group (pi[INVESTIGATOR_387379]), visit, treatment by [CONTACT_23259], double -blind Baseline  
score, double -blind Baseline  score by [CONTACT_23259], designated dementia subtype,  and 
region . 
CGI-I will be analyzed using a n MMRM model with the following independent variables: 
treatment group (pi[INVESTIGATOR_387379]), visit, treatment by [CONTACT_23259], double -blind 
Baseline  CGI-S score, double -blind Baseline  CGI-S score by [CONTACT_22986] t interaction, designated 
dementia subtype, and region . 
The treatment comparisons will be based on the difference in least squares means and will b e 
tested at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. The double -blind Baseline  score is defined as the 
last value pri or to the first dose of double -blind study drug.  
In addition to the MMRM analyses  described above , last observation carried forward (LOCF) 
analyses will also be performed.  
Descriptive summaries of efficacy endpoints , including the number  and percent of sub jects 
meeting response  criteria, will be provided for the open -label period.

analyses will be conducted on the incidence of subj ects with prolonged QTc intervals and 
changes in QTc intervals in accordance with ICH guidelines. The incidence of clinically 
significant changes in selected laboratory parameters will also be summarized.  
9.5.5 Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Plasma concentration data for pi[INVESTIGATOR_650882] -279 will be listed and summarized using 
descriptive statistics.  
If data allow, population PK and PK/PD analyses will be performed to further characterize 
the PK profile and exposure response relationship of pi[INVESTIGATOR_650924] . The results of population PK and PK/PD modeling will be presented 
in a separate report . Investigators, subjects, and Sponsor personnel will remain blinded to 
plasma concentration data from the double -blind period  until the unblinding of the clinical 
database at the end of the study.  
9.5.[ADDRESS_872964] (DSMB) will review safety information 
on a regular basis throughout the study. The DSMB will be independent o f the Sponsor and 
will be empowered to recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_29921] . The DSMB may 
review blinded, unblinded , or partially unblinded  data, but the Sponsor and the Investigators 
will remain blinded to the data provided to the DSMB until the official unblinding of the 
database at the completion of the study . The membership, activities, responsibilities, and 
frequency of meetings will be described separately in the DSMB charter.  
9.5.7 Independent Adjudication Committee  
An IAC will be established to perform validation of protocol -defined relapse events. The 
validation is based on review of predefined clinical data related to: 1) a relapse (identi fied by 
[CONTACT_737] ) occurring before the study discontinuation date , and 2) all early termination

 Confidential and Proprietary Inform ation of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 68 of 100 events which occur in the double -blind period before the study discontinuation date 
(Section  3.1). 
Predefined clinical data consist of copi[INVESTIGATOR_650925] t he 
investigational sites. The IAC will review copi[INVESTIGATOR_36229] (translated if necessary) of 
medical documenta tion received in the adjudication packages. The Investigator must provide 
medical documentation as soon as possible after early termination . 
The IAC is composed of permanent members covering required medical specialties. IAC 
members must disclose any poten tial conflicts of interest and must be independent of the 
Sponsor.  
The events will be reviewed by [CONTACT_650952] a blinded manner.  
Only events that have been adjudicated will be used in the primary efficacy an alysis 
(Section  9.5.1 ) and the interim analysis (Section  9.5.8 ). Furthermore, only adjudicated events 
will be used to guide the decision to close enrollment in the study, which is based on the 
number of relapse events observed ( Section  9.3). 
The IAC will work in accordance with written guidelines included in the IAC charter 
describing in details the composition, tasks, responsibilities and work processes of the 
committee.

analysis results meet prespecified stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418] . For example, if there are exactly 38 
relapse events at the interim analysis, the significance level  will be 0.0054. If the study is not 
stopped early and the final analysis includes exactly 75 relapse events (including the 38 
events from the interim analysis), the significance level for the final analysis will be 0.0479. 
The actual significance levels to be used at the interim and final analyses will be calculated 
based on the actual number of adjudicated events observed . The interim efficacy analysis will 
be performed by [CONTACT_55467]. Investigators, subjects, and Sponsor personnel  
will remain blinded throughout the study.  
9.5.9 Additional Subgroup Analyses  
Selected analyses will be performed in subgroups defined by [CONTACT_650953]:

analyses will be performed for both the open -label and double -blind periods.  
9.5.10  Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity  
Adjustment of the primary efficacy analysis to account for the interim efficacy analysis is 
described in Section  9.5.8 . 
A hierarchical testing procedure will be used to control the overall ty pe I error rate for the 
primary and  key secondary efficacy endpoints.  Hypothesis testing will occur in the following 
sequential order:  
1. Primary endpoint  
2. Key secondary endpoint  
Statistical significance for the key secondary endpoint may only be claimed if the primary 
endpoint is statistically significant. The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_650926] y to be used for the key secondary 
endpoint will be specified in the SAP.  
9.6 Enrollment, Randomization, and Masking Procedures  
Eligible subjects will be randomized into 1 of 2 treatment groups (pi[INVESTIGATOR_387379])  
in a 1:1 ratio using an interactive resp onse technology (IRT) system . Randomization will be 
stratified by:  
1. Most likely dementia subtype or most prominent cause of dementia:  
 AD or FTD -spectrum disorders  
 VaD 
 PDD or DLB  
2. Region  
The assignments will be based on a pre -generated permuted -block randomiz ation schedule . 
Blinding will be assured by [CONTACT_431843]/o r 
designee to the treatment codes, and providing identical tablets and packaging for the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_387390].  
9.6.1 Breaking the Study Blin d/Subject Code  
For the final analysis, the treatment codes for all subjects will be released to the Sponsor after 
all subjects have completed the study and the clinical database is locked.  
For DSMB safety reviews, and for the interim efficacy analysis, the treatment codes will be 
released to an independent statistician/programmer to produce unblinded statistical outputs . 
The Sponsor and the Investigators will remain blinded.

No prospective entry criteria protocol deviations are allowed; all subjects must me et all 
eligibility criteria in order to participate in the study.  
Protocol waivers for eligibility and use of prohibited medication during the study 
(Section  4.5.1 ) will not be granted by [CONTACT_387435] . If, during the 
course of a subject ’s post-enrollment participation in the trial it is discovered that the subject 
did not me et all eligibility criteria, he or she will be discontinued, unless the discontinuation 
presents an unacceptable medical risk . The justification to allow the subject to continue in the 
trial will be made by [CONTACT_941] S ponsor, with medical input from the Investigator, and will be 
documented . If allowed to remain in the trial, this will be reported as a major protocol 
deviation and not a waiver . All follow -up safety assessments must be completed and 
documented as outlined  in the protocol ( Section  6.3.8 ). The Investigator must report any 
protocol deviation to the Sponsor and, if required, to the IRB/EC in accordance with local 
regulations, within reasonable time.

 Confidential and Proprietary Inform ation of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 79 of 100 16 APPENDICES  
Appendix A  NIA-AA Guidelines for All-cause Dementia and Alzheimer ’s Disease  
All-cause Dementia  
Dementia is diagnosed when there are cognitive or behavi oral (neuropsychiatric) symptoms 
that: 
1. Interfere with the ability to function at work or at usual activities; and  
2. Represent a decline from previous levels of functioning and performing; and  
3. Are not explained by [CONTACT_369944];  
4. Cogni tive impairment is detected and diagnosed through a combination of (1) history -
taking from the patient and a knowledgeable informant and (2) an objective cognitive 
assessment, either a “bedside ” mental status examination or neuropsychological 
testing. Neur opsychological testing should be performed when the routine history and 
bedside mental status examination cannot provide a confident diagnosis.  
5. The cognitive or behavioral impairment involves a minimum of two of the following 
domains:  
a. Impaired ability to a cquire and remember new information ––symptoms 
include: repetitive questions or conversations, misplacing personal belongings, 
forgetting events or appointments, getting lost on a familiar route.  
b. Impaired reasoning and handling of complex tasks, poor judgme nt––symptoms 
include: poor understanding of safety risks, inability to manage finances, poor 
decision -making ability, inability to plan complex or sequential activities.  
c. Impaired visuospatial abilities ––symptoms include: inability to recognize faces 
or common objects or to find objects in direct view despi[INVESTIGATOR_369895], 
inability to operate simple implements, or orient clothing to the body.  
d. Impaired language functions (speaking, reading, writing) ––symptoms include: 
difficulty thinking of common words wh ile speaking, hesitations; speech, 
spelling, and writing errors.  
e. Changes in personality, behavior, or comportment ––symptoms include: 
uncharacteristic mood fluctuations such as agitation, impaired motivation, 
initiative, apathy, loss of drive, social withdr awal, decreased interest in 
previous activities, loss of empathy, compulsive or obsessive behaviors, 
socially unacceptable behaviors

Meets criteria for all -cause dementia (see above) and in addition, has the following  
characteristics:  
1. Insidious onset. Symptoms have a gradual onset over months to years, not sudden over 
hours or days;  
2. Clear -cut history of worsening of cognition by [CONTACT_124526]; and  
3. The initial and most prominent cognitive deficits are evident on  history and 
examination in one of the following categories:  
a. Amnestic presentation: It is the most common syndromic presentation of AD 
dementia. The deficits should include impairment in learning and recall of 
recently learned information. There should als o be evidence of cognitive 
dysfunction in at least one other cognitive domain, as defined earlier in the 
text. 
b. Nonamnestic presentations:  
i. Language presentation: The most prominent deficits are in word -
finding, but deficits in other cognitive domains should  be present.  
ii. Visuospatial presentation: The most prominent deficits are in spatial 
cognition, including object agnosia, impaired face recognition, 
simultanagnosia, and alexia. Deficits in other cognitive domains should 
be present.  
iii. Executive dysfunction: Th e most prominent deficits are impaired 
reasoning, judgment, and problem solving. Deficits in other cognitive 
domains should be present.  
4. The diagnosis of probable AD dementia should not be applied when there is evidence 
of  
a. substantial concomitant cerebrova scular disease, defined by a history of a 
stroke temporally related to the onset or worsening of cognitive impairment; or 
the presence of multiple or extensive infarcts or severe white matter 
hyperintensity burden; or  
b. core features of dementia with Lewy bo dies other than dementia itself; or  
c. prominent features of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia; or  
d. prominent features of semantic variant primary progressive aphasia or 
nonfluent/agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia; or  
e. evidence  for another concurrent, active neurological disease, or a non -
neurological medical comorbidity or use of medication that could have a 
substantial effect on cognition.

A diagnosis of possible AD dementia should be made in either of the circumstances 
mentioned in the following paragraphs.  
Atypi[INVESTIGATOR_650929], but either has a sudden onset of cognitive impairm ent or demonstrates 
insufficient historical detail or objective cognitive documentation of progressive decline,  
OR 
Etiologically mixed presentation  
Etiologically mixed presentation meets all core clinical criteria for AD dementia but has 
evidence of (a) co ncomitant cerebrovascular disease, defined by a history of stroke temporally 
related to the onset or worsening of cognitive impairment; or the presence of multiple or 
extensive infarcts or severe white matter hyperintensity burden; or (b) features of demen tia 
with Lewy bodies other than the dementia itself; or (c) evidence for another neurological 
disease or a non -neurological medical comorbidity or medication use that could have a 
substantial effect on cognition.

1. Central feature (essential for a diagnosis of possible or probable DLB)  
a. Dementia defined as progressive cognitive decline of sufficient magnitude 
to interfere with normal social or occupational function.  
b. Prominent or persistent memory impairment may not necessarily occur in 
the early stages but is usually evident with progression.  
c. Deficits on tests of attention, executive function, and vis uospatial ability 
may be especially prominent.  
2. Core  features (two core features are sufficient for a diagnosis of probable DLB, 
one for possible DLB)  
a. Fluctuating cognition with pronounced variations in attention and alertness  
b. Recurrent visual hallucinatio ns that are typi[INVESTIGATOR_650932]  
c. Spontaneous features of parkinsonism  
3. Suggestive features (If one or more of these is present in the presence of one or 
more core features, a diagnosis of probable DLB can be made. In the absence of 
any core features, one or more suggestive features is sufficient for possible DLB.  
Probable DLB should not be diagn osed on the basis of suggestive features alone.)  
a. REM sleep behavior disorder  
b. Severe neuroleptic sensitivity  
c. Low dopamine transporter uptake in basal ganglia demonstrated by [CONTACT_650961]  
4. Supportive features (commonly present but not proven to have diagnostic 
specificity)  
a. Repeated falls and syncope  
b. Transient, unexplained loss of consciousness  
c. Severe autonomic dysfunction (e.g., orthostatic hypotension, urinary 
incontinence)  
d. Hallucinations in other modalities  
e. Systematized delusions  
f. Depression  
g. Relative  preservation of medial temporal lobe structures on CT/MRI scan

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1  Date: [ADDRESS_873001] time at a stage of severe dementia  
6. Temporal sequence of symptoms  
 DLB should be diagnosed when dementia occurs before or concurrently 
with parkinsonism  (if it is present). The term Parkinson disease dementia 
(PDD) should be used to describe dementia that occurs in the context of 
well-established Parkinson disease. In a practice setting the term that is most 
appropriate to the clinical situation should be  used and generic terms such as 
LB disease are often helpful. In research studies in which distinction needs 
to be made between DLB and PDD, the existing 1 -year rule between the 
onset of dementia and parkinsonism DLB continues to be recommended. 
Adoption o f other time periods will simply confound data pooling or 
comparison between studies. In other research settings that may include 
clinicopathologic studies and clinical trials, both clinical phenotypes may b e 
considered collectively under categories such a s LB disease or alpha -
synucleinopathy.

 Confidential and Proprietary Inform ation of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 90 of 100 Appendix G  VASCOG Criteria for Vascular Dementia  
A. One of the following clinical features:  
1. The onset of the cognitive deficits is temporally related to one or more 
cerebrovascular events (CVE). [Onset is often abrupt with a stepwise or fluctuating 
course owing to  multiple such events, with cognitive deficits persisting beyond three 
months after the event. However, subcortical ischemic pathology may produce a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_650934], in which case A2 applies]. 
The evidence of CVEs is one of the following:  
a. Documented history of a stroke, with cognitive decline temporally associated 
with the event  
b. Physical signs consistent with stroke (e.g., hemiparesis, lower facial 
weakness, Babinski sign, sensory deficit including visual field defect,  
pseudobulbar syndrome – supranuclear weakness of muscles of face, tongue 
and pharynx, spastic dysarthria, swallowing difficulties and emotional 
incontinence)  
2. Evidence for decline is prominent in speed of information processing, complex 
attention and/or fr ontal -executive functioning in the absence of history of a stroke or 
transient ischemic attack. One of the following features is additionally present:  
a. Early presence of a gait disturbance (small step gait or marche petits pas, or  
magnetic, apraxic -ataxic o r parkinsonian gait); This may also manifest as 
unsteadiness and frequent, unprovoked falls  
b. Early urinary frequency, urgency, and other urinary symptoms not explained 
by [CONTACT_650965]  
c. Personality and mood changes: abulia, depression, or emotional incont inence  
B. Presence of significant neuroimaging (MRI or CT) evidence of cerebrovascular disease 
(one of the following):  
1. One large vessel infarct is sufficient for Mild VCD, and two or more large vessel 
infarcts are generally necessary for VaD  (or Major VCD).  
2. An extensive or strategically placed single infarct, typi[INVESTIGATOR_650935] (or Major VCD).  
3. Multiple lacunar infarcts (> two) outside the brainstem; 1–2 lacunes may be 
sufficient if strategical ly placed or in combination with extensive white matter 
lesions.  
4. Extensive and confluent white matter lesions  
5. Strategically placed intracerebral hemorrhage, or two or more intracerebral 
hemorrhages  
6. Combination of the above

1. History  
a. Early onset of memory deficit and progressive worsening of memory and 
other cognitive functions such as language (transcortical sensory aphasia), 
motor skills (apraxia), and perception (agnosia), in the absence of 
corresponding focal lesions on brain imaging or history of vascular events.  
b. Early and prominent parkinsonian features suggestive of Lewy body disease  
c. History strongly suggestive of another primary neurological disorder such as 
multiple sclerosis, encephalitis, toxic or metabo lic disorder, etc. sufficient to 
explain the cognitive impairment.  
2. Neuroimaging  
a. Absent or minimal cerebrovascular lesions on CT or MRI  
3. Other medical disorders severe enough to account for memory and related symptoms  
a. Other disease of sufficient severity to cause cognitive impairment (e.g., brain 
tumor, multiple sclerosis, encephalitis ) 
b. Major depression, with a temporal association between cognitive impairment 
and the likely onset of depression.  
c. Toxic and metabolic abnormalities, all of which may require specific 
investigations  
4. Other medical disorders severe enough to account for memory and related symptoms

Class  Patient Symptoms  
I No limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does 
not cause undue fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea (shortness of breath).  
II Slight limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Ordinary 
physical activity results in fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], dyspnea (shortness of 
breath).  
III Marked limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest. Less 
than ordinary activity causes fa tigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], or dyspnea.  
IV Unable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. 
Symptoms of heart failure at rest. If any physical activity is 
undertaken, discomfort increases.

Abbreviations: ACA=anterior cerebral arteries (including the anterior cerebral artery, anterior communicati ng 
artery, and pericallosal artery) ; ICA=internal carotid artery; MCA=middle cerebral artery; Pcom=posterior 
communicating artery ; posterior=posterior circulation (including the vertebral artery, basilar artery, 
cerebellar arteries, and posterior cerebral artery) ; SAH=subarachnoid haem orrhage  
Note: To calculate the PHASES risk score for an individual, the number of points associated  with each indicator 
can be added up to obtain the total risk score.

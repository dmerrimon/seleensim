TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  prior to enrollment to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria requirements 
will be required to return to the clinic within 45 days to complete the 
remaining activities. Subjects who require “washout” for longer than 45 days will be re -consented. A brief physical examination including vital 
signs, UPT (if applicable), electrocardiogram (ECG), Fitzpatrick Skin Type a ssessment, clinical evaluations (lesions counts, IGA, as well as 
baseline local skin reactions (LSRs) pre- application), and photographs 
will be performed at this visit. Prior and concomitant therapy and 
concomitant medications/procedures will be reviewed. Subjects will be 
randomized and assigned a test article kit number. Test article and 
Subject Diary will be dispensed. Subjects and parent/guardian (if 
applicable) will be instructed on how to apply the test article and to 
record applications in the Subject  Diary. The first dose will be applied 
during this visit under supervision of the investigator. Adverse events 
(AEs) and LSRs post -application will be assessed. The subject will be 
scheduled for the first follow -up visit.  
 
2. Visits 2 and 3 (Weeks 4 & 8) : Sub jects will return after the initial 
treatment for clinical evaluations (lesion counts, IGA, AEs, and LSRs), UPT (if applicable), and review of concomitant medications/procedures. Test article application and compliance will be reviewed (from Subject Diary) , test article and Subject Diary will be dispensed/returned (as 
required), and photography will be performed. The subject will be 
scheduled for the next follow -up visit.  
 
3. Visit 4 (Final Visit, Week 12 & Early Termination): Subjects will return 
for the fina l visit for review of concomitant medications/procedures, 
UPT (if applicable), ECG, clinical evaluations (lesion counts, IGA, AEs, and LSRs), and photography. All test article will be returned and 
compliance documented (from Subject Diary).  
Study Measurem ents Efficacy  will be assessed by [CONTACT_3470]:  
• Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) : Overall severity of acne 
using a five -point scale from 0 = clear to 4 = severe will be conducted 
at each visit. This is a static morphological scale that  refers to a point 
in time and not a comparison to Baseline.  
• Acne Lesion Counts:  Total lesions, including inflammatory lesions 
(papules, pustules, and nodules) and non- inflammatory lesions (open 
and closed comedones), on the face will be accurately counted , but 
recorded separately at each visit. 
 Safety  will be assessed by [CONTACT_229772] (Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, and 12, or at the end of treatment). ECGs will also be assessed at Baseline and  Week 12.  
 
LSRs including telangiectasia, skin atrophy, striae rubrae, erythema, edema, and scaling/dryness will be assessed by [CONTACT_229773] a 
five-point ordinal scale (0 = none, 1 = trace, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = 
severe). Subjects will be asked to rate the severity of stinging/burning and 
pruritus using a four -point scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = 
severe) at each visit (Baseline [pre- and post -application], and Weeks 4, 8, 
and 12).

Primary Efficacy Analysis  
Hypothesis tests on the primary endpoints will be conducted in hierarchical order for P1 through P3.  
 
P1: A logistic regression model with treatment and analysis center as fixed 
effects will be used to compare the proportion of subjects achieving 
“success” in each treatment group at Week 12, where “success” is defined as an IGA score of “clear (score=0)” or “almost clear (score=1)” AND at least a two -point improvement in IGA compared to Baseline.  
 P2: An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to compare the 
absolute change from Baseline in non -inflammatory lesion counts in each 
treatment group at Week 12, with treatment and analysis center as fixed effects and the Baseline non -inflammatory lesion count as the covariate.  
 
P3: An ANCOVA will be used to compare the absolute change from 
Baseline in inflammatory lesion counts in each treatment group at Week 12 , 
with treatment and analysis center as fixed effects and the Baseline 
inflammatory lesion count as the covariate.  
 
Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
Hypothesis tests on the secondary endpoints will be conducted in 
hierarchical order for S1 through S4.  
 S1: An A NCOVA will be used to compare the absolute change from 
Baseline in total lesion counts in each treatment group at Week 12, with treatment and analysis center as fixed effects and the Baseline total lesion count as the covariate.  
 
S2: An ANCOVA will be used  to compare the percent change from Baseline 
in total lesion counts in each treatment group at Week 12, with treatment and 
analysis center as fixed effects and the Baseline total lesion count as the covariate. 
 
S3: An ANCOVA will be used to compare the percent change from Baseline 
in non -inflammatory lesion counts in each treatment group at Week 12, with 
treatment and analysis center as fixed effects and the Baseline non -
inflammatory lesion count as the covariate.  
 S4: An ANCOVA will be used to compare the percent change from Baseline 
in inflammatory lesion counts in each treatment group at Week 12, with

TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06  1. BACKGROUND  
CB-03-01 (cortexolone 17α-propi[INVESTIGATOR_16865] e) is a steroidal antiandrogen that is being developed 
as a 1% cream for the topi[INVESTIGATOR_112930], an androgen -dependent skin 
disorder. CB -03-[ADDRESS_276504], is a physiological 
component of the pool of endogenous corticosteroids, and is an intermediate in the synthesis of glucocorticoids, but it only exhibits weak glucocorticoid properties [ 1]. 
 In single -dose studies in mouse and in rat, and following repeated subcutaneous 
administration in rats, and dermal administration in rabbits and minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], the drug was well tolerated with no significant local or unexpected systemic effects. CB -03-[ADDRESS_276505] been completed with CB-03-01 cream in Europe and the [LOCATION_002], with over 500 subjects exposed to CB -03-01 
creams. All studies were conducted using CB -03-01 cream, 1%; additional concentrations 
of CB -03-01 cream (0.1% and 0.5%) were also used in the most -recent Phase 2 Dose-
Escalating study. The studies included:  
1. A Phase 1 Single Dose Pharmacokinetics (PK) Study in 24 healthy volunteers [randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, single-ascending dose],  
2. A Phase 1 Repeat Dose PK Study in 24 healthy volunteers [randomized, vehicle -
controlled, 14- day repeat -dose], 
3. A Phase 1 Steady State PK Study in 8 subjects with acne vulgaris [single center, open-label, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], 6- week repeat -dose] 
4. A Phase 1 Three- week  Cumulative Skin Irritation Study in 36 healthy volunteers, 
5. A Phase 2 Hypothalamic- Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -Adrenal axis (HPA)/PK study in 42 subjects 
with acne vulgaris [open-label, 14- day repeat -dose] 
6. A Phase 2 Comparator Proof of Concept Study in 72 adult subjects wit h facial acne 
vulgaris [randomized, double -blind, vehicle -controlled, active -comparator ( Retin -
A
® [tretinoin] 0.05% cream), 8- week repeat -dose], and 
7. A Phase 2 Dose -Escalating Study in 363 subjects with facial acne vulgaris [multi-
center, randomized, double-blind, vehicle controlled, 12- week repeat -dose] 
 Overall, the data that resulted from the completion of the aforementioned studies has demonstrated that CB -03-01 creams selected for clinical development (a) are well tolerated 
locally, (b) result in minimal systemic exposure when applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_897], (c) have a clinical safety profile without any concern and similar to the placebo, and (d) at 1% concentration

non-inflammatory lesions counts in adolescent and adult subjects. 
 
CB-03-01 could offer advantages over existing products for acne vulgaris due to its 
potential efficacy and lack of systemic antiandrogen activity. Because its pharmacological action appears to be limited to the local site of application, use of CB -03-01 may be able 
to mitigate the side effects related to systemic exposure to hormonal agents currently used in the treatment of acne.  
2. RATIONALE  
The concentration of CB -03-01 selected for the initial clinical studies (1%) was based on 
antiandrogenic activity in the hamster flank organ test in which the best effective concentration was 0.8% [ 1]. The results of the Phase 2 Dose Escalation Study demonstrated 
that CB -03-01 cream, 1% applied BID had more favorable results than other treatments 
(0.1% BID, 0.5% BID, and 1% QD) and no material safety issues were noted with any of 
the concentrations of CB -03-01 cream [ 2]. Based on the collective findings of the previous 
Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies, CB -03-01 cream, 1% BID appears to be the best treatment 
candidate to advance for further clinical study and development as a topi[INVESTIGATOR_229755]. Thus, the present Phase 3 study has been designed to determine and compare 
the efficacy of treatment with CB -03-01 cream, 1% and the vehicle cream applied twice 
daily for 12 weeks in subjects with moderate to severe facial acne vulgaris.  
3. OBJECTIVE  
The primary objective of this study is to determine the safe ty and efficacy of CB -03-01 
cream, 1% versus the vehicle cream applied twice daily for 12 weeks in subjects with facial acne vulgaris.  
4. STUDY DESIGN 
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, vehicle -controlled, parallel -group 
comparison study of safe ty and efficacy for CB -03-01 cream, 1% in male and female 
subjects, [ADDRESS_276506] acne vulgaris of the face (which can include the nose) with an Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score of [ADDRESS_276507] 30 to a maximum of 75 inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, and nodules), and at least 30 to a maximum of 100 non-inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones). At least 700 subjects will be enrolled at approximately 38 sites. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment groups:  
 
1. CB-03-01 (cortexolone 17α-propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847]) cream, 1% 
2. Vehicle cream

Section 6). 
 In addition, a separate open- label long -term extension study is planned. Subjects 
completing the treatment -phase of this trial will be offered the  opportunity to participate in 
this follow -on study (CB -03-01/27).  In this open label study, all subjects will apply the 
active medication (cortexolone 17α- propi[INVESTIGATOR_229756], 1%) twice daily for up to 9 
additional months of treatment (for a total of up to 12 months; 0 or 3 months in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_61493] 3 trial and an additional 9 months in the open-label long- term extension study).

9. STUDY PROCEDURES  
The study will consist of a Screening/Baseline Visit and three (3) scheduled visits.  
 
Specific activities for each study visit are listed below.  
9.1 Visit 1 (Day 1): Screening/Baseline 
Subjects can be screened for the study up to 45 days before Visit 1. During screening, the study requirements will be reviewed, written informed consent/assent obtained, and eligibility confirmed. If app licable, the washout from prohibited medications or treatments 
will be determined and implemented. Subjects who require “washout” for longer than 45 days will be re -consented.  
 At Screening, the investigator or designee will:

At every study visit, overall severity of acne using a five -point scale from 0 = clear to 
4 = severe will be conducted at each visit. This is a static morphological scale that refers 
to a point in time and not a comparison to Baseline. Subjects must have an IGA score of 3 
(moderate) or 4 (severe) at Baseline.  
 
[ADDRESS_276528] Clear  Rare non -inflammatory lesions with no more than one small 
inflammatory lesions.

inflammatory lesions but no more than one nodular/cystic lesion. 
4 Severe  Up to many non -inflammatory lesions and inflammatory lesions 
but no more than a few nodular/cystic lesions. 
10.2 Acne Lesion Counting  
The number of inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, and nodules) and non-inflammatory lesions (open and closed comedones) on the face vertically from the hairline 
to mandible rim and horizontally from ear to ear, including those on the nose will be 
counted to determine subject eligibility at Visit 1. Subjects must have at least 30 to a maximum of 75 inflammatory lesions and 30 to a maximum of 100 non- inflammatory 
lesions on the face (which can include the nose) at Baseline.  
 Lesions are defined as follow s: 
• Comedones- open (blackheads) and closed (whiteheads).  
• Papules - raised inflammatory lesions with no visible purulent material.  
• Pustules- raised inflammatory lesions with visible purulent material.  
• Nodules- Any circumscribed, inflammatory masses greater or equal to [ADDRESS_276530]’s skin phototype (I -VI)

 These LSRs will be collected independently of AEs. Only LSRs that require medical intervention (e.g., prescription medication) or require withholding the application of the test articles will be documented as AEs. Any LSRs that are not listed above will be recorded as AEs.  
11. PHOTOGRAPHY  
Photography documentation is required in this study. Photographs taken as part of this 
study will be used to document the effects of treatment, AEs, or other findings during the trial. Color photographs (both sides of the face and the front of the face) of the areas with 
acne lesions of all enrolled subject s will be performed at the Baseline Visit prior to 
application of the test articles and at Visits 2, 3, and 4. The study sites will be provided with suggested guidelines to assist them in taking standardized photographs. In addition, investigators at all s tudy sites may take photos as they deem appropriate to document the 
clinical status of the subject (e.g., an AE, etc.).  Photographs taken for this study are for 
informational purposes only and are not to assist in grading or for any other assessment.  Note: Subjects may decline to have photographs taken during the conduct of the study. If a subject initially consents to photographs, then declines further photography, the Sponsor may use the photographs taken under consent for the purposes noted above.

14. ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING  
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a 
drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. 
 
 
An AE (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. An AE can arise from any use of the drug  (e.g., off -label use, use in combination with any drug) and from any route of 
administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
Information on the medical condition of subjects should begin following the subject’s written consent/assent to participate in the study and a medical history should be taken at screening. During any wash out and baseline periods, any changes in the health of subjects should be recorded as changes in medical history unless the event occurred as a result of a study- related procedure and is unanticipated, in such cases, the event should be recorded 
as an AE and reported to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) as an “unanticipated problem” in accordance with local procedures. Other changes in subject health information becomes AE data when the subject begins dosing with the test article and therefore AE data should be collected from the date of the first dose of test article. These data are considered treatment -emergent AEs.  
 Timely and complete reporting of all AEs assists Therapeutics, Inc. (TI) in identifying any untoward medical occurrence, thereby [CONTACT_17155]:  
1) protection of the safety of study subjects;  
2) a greater understanding of the overall safety profile of the test article;  
3) recognition of dose- related test article toxicity;  
4) appropriate modification of study protocols;  
5) improvements in study design or procedures; and  
6) adherence to worldwide regulatory requirements.

being tes ted or used as a reference in the study, whether blinded or unblinded. AEs may be 
either spontaneously reported or elicited during questioning and examination of a subject. All AEs must be completely recorded on the AE CRF. If known, the investigator shoul d 
report the diagnosis of the underlying illness or disorder, rather than its individual symptoms. Subjects experiencing AEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of test article, or those experiencing AEs that are present at the end of their particip ation in the 
study should receive follow -up as appropriate. If possible, report the outcome of any AE 
that caused permanent discontinuation or that was present at the end of the study particularly if the AE is considered by [CONTACT_47747]- related (i.e., 
definitely, probably, or possibly related to test article). 
14.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
All AEs must be recorded on the AE CRF. AEs should be followed to resolution or 
stabilization (if possible), and reported as serious adverse events (SAEs) if they become serious.  LSRs that have been reported in subjects treated with CB -03-01 creams (0.1% -1% 
concentration) include (with decreasing frequency) erythema, pruritus, scaling/dryness, skin atrophy, striae rubrae, stinging/burning, edema, and telangiectasia; however most LSRs were typi[INVESTIGATOR_229765]. No subjects discontinued treatment due to these LSRs.  
 AEs that have been reported in subjects treated with CB -03-01 creams (0.1 -1% 
concentration) were minimal, typi[INVESTIGATOR_229766], a nd most were recovered/resolved 
without sequelae at the end of the study. Only two AEs in one (1) subject were judged as probably or possibly related to treatment; both of these treatment -related AEs (burning and 
cold at application site) were mild in seve rity. Two SAEs have been reported to date; both 
were not related to treatment and were resolved at the end of the study. In addition, one subject discontinued early from the study due to an AE (urinary tract infection), which was not related to treatment.  
 The investigator will instruct the subject to report any AEs that may occur during the study. At each visit, the investigator should ask the subject, in non- directive fashion, about any 
change in the subject’s overall condition since the previous visit.  The severity of each AE, as judged by [CONTACT_093], will be recorded on the appropriate AE CRF and will be graded according to the following scale:  
Mild - The AE is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].  
 
Moderate - The AE causes the subject d iscomfort and interrupts the subject's usual 
activities.

activities, and may be incapacitating or life -threatening. 
 
The investigator must determine the relationship of the AE to the test article according to 
the following categories:  
Definite  - An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the test article; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the test article; and that is confirmed b y improvement on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_28214], and reappearance of the event on repeated exposure (re- challenge).  
 
Probable  - An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the test article; that follows a known or expected response pattern 
to the test article; and that is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_229767]; and that is unlikely to have been caused by [CONTACT_28260]/underlying illness or other drugs, procedures, or other causes. 
 
Possi ble - An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the test article; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the test article; but may have been caused by [CONTACT_28260]/underlying illness, other drug, procedure, or other causes.  
 
Unlikely  - An event that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the test article; that does not follow a known or expected response pattern to the test article, or most likely was caused by [CONTACT_28260]/underlyin g 
illness, other drug, procedure, or other causes, because of their known effects.  
 
Not Related  - An event almost certainly caused by [CONTACT_28260]/underlying illness, 
other drug, procedure, or other causes.  
The investigator should categorize the outcome of  the AE according to the following 
categories:  
  Fatal - Termination of life as a result of an AE.  
  Not Recovered/Not Resolved - AE has not improved or the subject has not 
recuperated.  
  Recovered/Resolved - AE has improved or the subject has recuperated.  
  Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae - subject recuperated but retained the 
pathological conditions resulting from the prior disease or injury.

TI SOP 305 -A Protocol Template, Version 06   Recovering/Resolving -  AE is improving or the subject is recuperating.  
 
 Unknown - Not known, not observed, not recorded or subject refused. 
 The investigator should report the action taken with the test article due to the AE according to the following categories:  
Dose Not Changed  - An indication that a medication schedule was maintained.  
 Dose Increased  - An indication that a medication schedule was modified by 
[CONTACT_60267]; either by [CONTACT_60268], strength or amount.  Dose Reduced  - An indication that a medication schedule was modified by 
[CONTACT_58413], either by [CONTACT_60268], strength or amount.  Drug Interrupted  - An indication that a medication schedule was modified by 
[CONTACT_229782] a prescribed regimen of medication.  
 Drug Withdrawn  - An indication that  a medication schedule was modified through 
termination of a prescribed regimen of medication.  
 Not Applicable  - Determination of a value is not relevant in the current context. 
 Unknown - Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused. 
 The investigator should report any other action taken due to the AE.  An adverse reaction  is any AE caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all 
suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the event. For the purposes of prescription drug labeling, the term adverse reaction means an undesirable effect, reasonably associated with the use of a drug that may occur as part of its pharmacological action or may be unpredictable in its occurrence.  
 A suspected adverse reactio n is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the event.   For the purposes of IND safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. A suspected a dverse reaction 
implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug.  
 An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not lis ted at the specificity or severity that has been observed; 
or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk

application. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14213]) if the investigator brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14214]) if the investigator brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents. "Unexpected," as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
14.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An event that is serious must be recorded on the AE CRF and on the TI SAE Report Form, 
and requires expeditious handling to comply with regulatory requirements.  An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_28216], it results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death.  
• Life-threatening event.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. 
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions. 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Is an important medical event - defined as a medical event(s) that may not result in 
death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient/subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition above. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convuls ions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 Events NOT considered to be SAEs are: 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28217], which was elective or pre -planned, of a pre -
existing condition that did not worsen, and 
• Treatment on an emergency, outpatient basis, for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of “serious” given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. 
 
AEs classified as “serious” by [CONTACT_229783]. All serious AEs, 
whether related or unrelated to test article, must be immediately reported by [CONTACT_28262], in the event that he/she is unavailable, to  the

Sponsor Name: [CONTACT_229771] S.p.A.  Protocol Date: August 06, [ADDRESS_276537] include an 
assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event.  
 
Study endpoints that are SAEs (e.g., all -cause mortality) must be reported in accordance 
with the protocol unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the drug and the event (e.g., death from anaphylaxis). In this case, the investigator must immediately report the event to the Sponsor. In addition, such information should also be provided to the site’s respective IRB per their gov erning guidelines for SAE reporting.  
 If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. Should the 
investigator become aware of an SAE (regardless of its relationship to test article) that occurs within [ADDRESS_276538] be reported in accordance with procedures specified in this protocol. In the event of death, if an autopsy is performed, a copy of the report should be sent to TI, if available.  As required, TI will notify participating  investigators of all suspected adverse reactions 
that are serious and unexpected. This notification will be in the form of an IND safety report of potential serious risks as soon as possible but no later than 15 calendar days after the Sponsor determines that the information is “reportable” according to the criteria listed 
in 21 CFR Section 312.32. These are:  
i) Serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions,  
ii) Findings from other studies including epi[INVESTIGATOR_9037], pooled analyses, or other clinical studies that suggest a significant risk in humans 
exposed to the test articles,  
iii) Findings from animal or in vitro tests that suggest a significant risk to humans exposed to the test articles or reports of significant organ toxicity at or near the expected human exposure, and 
iv) Clinically important increases in the rate of occurrence of serious suspected adverse reactions.  
 Upon receiving such notices, the investigator must review and retain the notice with the Investigator Brochure and immediately su bmit a copy of this information to the responsible 
IRB according to local regulations. The investigator and IRB will determine if the informed consent/assent requires revision. The investigator should also comply with the IRB procedures for reporting any other safety information. Where required, submission of safety updates by [CONTACT_428].  
14.3 Pregnancy  
WOCBP (see Section 5.1.1 for definition) must have a negative UPT prior to study 
enrollment and must use a highly effective method of birth control during the course of the study, in a manner such that risk of failure is minimized. Prior to study enrollment, 
Product Name: [CONTACT_229808] 17α- Propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847] (CB -03-01) Protocol: CB-03-01/25 
Sponsor Name: [CONTACT_229771] S.p.A.  Protocol Date: August 06, [ADDRESS_276539] and parent/guardian must sign an informed consent/assent form documenting this discussion. 
 
During the study, all WOCBP should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_229784] (e.g., missed or late menstrual period).  
 WOCBP enrolling into the study must have a pregnancy test prior to study therapy, and monthly throughout the course of the study. The study therapy must be withheld until the results of laboratory pregnancy testing are known, and a negative UPT must be confirmed to continue in the trial. If pregnancy is confirmed during screening, the subject must not receive test article and must not be enrolled in the study.  
 If a subject or investigator suspects that a subject may be pregnant at any time during the study, the test article must be withheld until the results of la boratory pregnancy testing are 
available. If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not apply further test article and must be discontinued from the study.  If following initiation of study treatment, it is subsequently discovered that a trial subject was pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of test article exposure, the investigator 
must immediately notify the Medical Monitor of this event, and record the pregnancy on the appropriate pregnancy surveillance form. The form will be sent to TI. The  investigator 
must notify the IRB of any pregnancy associated with the study therapy and keep careful source documentation of the event.  Protocol- required procedures for those subjects that are discontinued from the study must 
be performed on the subject unless contraindicated by [CONTACT_8663] (e.g., x -ray studies).  
Other appropriate pregnancy follow -up procedures should be considered if indicated, 
including counseling of the subject by [CONTACT_28266] (e.g. , obstetrician). In addition, the investigator must report to TI, on 
the appropriate TI pregnancy surveillance form(s), any follow -up information regarding 
the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome. Although pregnancy itself is not an AE, any complications during pregnancy should be recorded as 
AEs (or SAEs, if they fulfill the SAE criteria). Abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous should be reported as an SAE. Offspring should be followed for a minimum of eight  weeks. Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a subject exposed 
to the test article(s) should be recorded as an SAE and details documented in the pregnancy surveillance form.  
15. BLINDING/UNBLINDING  
Blinding is important for the integrity of this clinical drug trial. However, the blind may be broken in the event of a medical emergency in a subject, in which knowledge of the test article identity is critical to the subject’s management. Before breaking the blind for a 
Product Name: [CONTACT_229808] 17α- Propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847] (CB -03-01) Protocol: CB-03-01/25 
Sponsor Name: [CONTACT_229771] S.p.A.  Protocol Date: August 06, [ADDRESS_276540], the investigator s hould determine that the information is necessary (i.e., that it will 
alter the subject’s immediate management). In many cases, particularly when the 
emergency is clearly not test article related, the problem may be effectively managed by [CONTACT_229785]. The 
need to break the blind should first be discussed with the responsible Medical Monitor and the best method to do this will be determined. 
16. CLINICAL SUPPLIES  
16.[ADDRESS_276541] articles will be packaged and labeled by [CONTACT_16015]. Detailed information 
on the packaging/labeling, blinding/unblinding, storage and preparation, dispensing,

• UPTs in all WOCBP at every visit (Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, and 12). 
• Material changes from Baseline in ECGs at Week 12.  
17.2 Sample Size Calculations and Power Considerations  
Assumptions used for sample size calculation were estimated from Phase 2 Dose Escalation Study (171 -7151- 201) [ 2], using a subset of subjects with 30- [ADDRESS_276542] to be performed at the same significance level α=0.[ADDRESS_276543] a null hypothesis will imply 
the failure of rejecting all of the subsequent null hypotheses.  In order  to keep the overall Type II error β=0.1 for the whole study, the sample size for the 
three hypothesis tests on the primary endpoints will be calculated considering an individual Type II error β=0.033.  
 For an IGA success rate of (continuity corrected) 14.00% for CB -03-01 cream and 2.17% 
for vehicle cream (odds ratio=7), sample size was estimated to be 202 subjects per treatment group.  
 For a mean absolute change from Baseline in non- inflammatory lesion counts of -22 for 
CB-03-01 cream and -1 for vehicle cr eam (standard deviation=17), sample size was 
calculated to be [ADDRESS_276544] Name: [CONTACT_229808] 17α- Propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847] (CB -03-01) Protocol: CB-03-01/25

subjects per treatment group.  For a mean percent change from  Baseline in total lesion counts of -35 for CB -03-01 cream 
and - 14 for vehicle cream (standard deviation=40), sample size was calculated to be 77 
subjects per treatment group.  For a mean percent change from Baseline in non -inflammatory lesion counts of -33 for 
CB-03-01 cream and -5 for vehicle cream (standard deviation=40), sample size was 
calculated to be 43 subjects per treatment group.  For a mean percent change from Baseline in inflammatory lesion counts of -37 for CB -03-

be [ADDRESS_276546] 350 subjects in each treatment group (CB -03-01 
cream, 1% BID and vehicle BID) will be included in each Phase 3 study to pr ovide 
sufficient power (90%) with the chosen primary endpoints. 
17.3 Statistical Methods  
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS
® unless otherwise stated. Summary 
tables (descriptive statistics and/or frequency tables) will be provided for baseline 
variables, efficacy variables, and safety variables. Continuous variables will be described by [CONTACT_9086] (n, mean, standard  deviation, CV%, minimum, median, and 
maximum). Frequency counts and percentage of subjects within each category are provided for categorical data. Summaries will be provided for each treatment group.  
 The Safety set will include all subjects who received at least one application of the test article. The ITT set will include all randomized subjects. The PP set will be a subset of the ITT set and will include subjects who completed the study without any significant protocol deviations. The analysis of safety  will be conducted on the Safety set. The analysis of 
efficacy will be conducted on both the ITT and PP sets, with the ITT set considered as the primary set for statistical analysis. Multiple imputation will be used to impute missing values for the primary  endpoints and absolute change in total lesions count (S1) in the ITT

obtained on the ITT set for the primary endpoints (change from Baseline in non-inflammatory and inflammatory lesion counts and IGA “success” at Week 12). Missing 
values for the other secondary endpoints (i.e., S2- S4: percent change in lesions counts) will 
be calculated using the values obtained from the multiple imputation of the primary efficacy  endpoints and secondary efficacy endpoint #1 (S1). 
17.3.1  Efficacy Analyses 
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Analysis  
Hypothesis tests on the primary endpoints will be conducted in hierarchical order for P1 through P3.  P1: A logistic regression model with treatment and analysis center as fixed effects will be 
used to compare the proportion of subjects achieving “success” in each treatment group at Week 12, where “success” is defined as an IGA score of “clear” (score=0) or “almost clear” (score=1) AND at least a two -point improvement in IGA compared to Baseline.  
 P2: An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to compare the absolute change 
from Baseline in non -inflammatory lesion count in each treatment group at Week 12, with 
treatment and analysis center as fixed effects an d the Baseline non- inflammatory lesion 
count as the covariate.  
 P3: An ANCOVA will be used to compare the absolute change from Baseline in 
inflammatory lesion count in each treatment group at Week 12, with treatment and analysis center as fixed effects and  the Baseline inflammatory lesion count as the covariate.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
Hypothesis tests on the secondary endpoints will be conducted in hierarchical order for S1 through S4.  S1: An ANCOVA will be used to compare the absolute change from Bas eline in total lesion 
counts in each treatment group at Week 12, with treatment and analysis center as fixed effects and the Baseline total lesion count as the covariate.  
 S2: An ANCOVA will be used to compare the percent change from Baseline in total lesi on 
counts in each treatment group at Week 12, with treatment and analysis center as fixed effects and the Baseline total lesion count as the covariate.  
 S3: An ANCOVA will be used to compare the percent change from Baseline in non-
inflammatory lesion count s in each treatment group at Week 12, with treatment and 
analysis center as fixed effects and the Baseline non -inflammatory lesion count as the 
covariate.

analysis center as fixed effects and the Baseline inflammatory lesion count as the covariate.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Imputation of Missing Data  
Missing values for the primary endpoint in the ITT analyses will be imputed by 
• Multiple imputation using missing at random assumption;  
• Missing at worst value (for the entire set); 
• Worst case;  
• Last observation carried forward; and 
• Baseline observation carried forward. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Sensitivity Analyses  
Sensitivity analyses will be performed to investigate the robustness of the results obtained 
on the ITT set for the primary endpoints. The first sensitivity analysis will be the Per Protocol analysis. Four additional sensitivity analyses will be performed using different methods of imputation on t he ITT set. On a per -subject basis, missing values for the 
primary endpoints will be imputed with the  
1) Worst value (for the entire set);  
2) Worst case;  
3) Last observation carried forward; and 
4) Baseline observation carried forward. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Multicenter Studies  
Each center will conduct the clinical study under a common protocol. Consistency in study 
execution at each center will be emphasized. The study is to be conducted in such a manner as to have a minimum of eight ITT subjects enrolled in each of the treatment groups at each 
center (i.e., 16 ITT subjects enrolled overall per study center). In the event that there are too few subjects in a treatment arm for a center, then this center’s data will be combined with another center’s data in order to achieve the desired minimum  number of subjects per 
treatment arm. The combining of data across centers will be accomplished by [CONTACT_229788]. The sequence of combination will be based on the total number of subjects enrolled in each center (combining the lowest with second lowest and so on). Combining center data to achieve sufficient subjects per treatment arm will result in combined centers. T hese combined centers, as well as 
individual centers with sufficient subjects per treatment arm, will be referred to as “analysis centers” in the statistical analysis.

overall for the ITT and PP sets. The proportion of compliant and non- compliant subjects 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_229789]. Subjects with an overall compliance not evaluable (due to missing data) or less than 
80% will be excluded from the PP set. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Extent of Exposure 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize exposure to test article for the ITT, PP and 
Safety sets. The total amount of test article used (grams applied) will be calculated for each 
subject from the weights of the returned test articles. The mean daily amount of test article applied (total amount of test article used/number of days of treatment) will be calc ulated 
for each subject and summarized by [CONTACT_53846].

  Purpose of the study   
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent and the main cause of global disability worldwide (Kupfer 
et al., 2012). About 20 –40% of patients do  not benefit sufficiently from the existing antidepressant interventions, 
including trials of medication and psychotherapy (Greden, 2001). Pharmacological treatments have limited 
efficacy, side effects are common (Carvalho et al., 2016), and one -third of p atients are medication -resistant failing 
to achieve remission after using three or more antidepressants (Rush et al., 2006) and experiencing recurrent 
depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (Nemeroff, 2007).  
For patients with medication -resistant MDD, a number of neuromodulation strategies are available, including 
electro -convulsive therapy (ECT) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). These are effective 
interventions, which nonetheless present relatively high costs, may have side -effects and risk s (e.g. complications 
of anesthesia in the case of ECT or risk of seizure induction in the case of rTMS), and require specialized 
equipment, trained personnel and suitable clinic facilities. This can pose a challenge for some patients as ready 
access to sp ecialized clinics or treatment centers is not available in all areas of the US or worldwide. The 
challenge is particularly acute among seniors who have additional limitations in mobility and need help and 
support to make it to outpatient clinics. And yet, it is estimated that approximately 15% of the elderly (aged > 65) 
living in the community suffer from clinically significant depressive symptoms (Blazer 2003). Depression in the 
elderly is a cause of particularly high morbidity and early mortality (Schulz et al. 2002), and older age is a 
significant predictor of an unfavorable course of depression (Mitchell & Subramanian 2005), reduced likelihood 
of treatment response (Licht -Strunck et al 2007; Tedeschini et al. 2011), diminished chance of functional recove ry 
(Little et al 1998), and increased risk of relapse (Beekman et al 2002).  
At present, given the COVID -[ADDRESS_1159686] current 
stimulation (tDCS) offers a suitable and readily available solution.  
Study design  and purpose :     We pro pose a safety/feasibility st udy designed to determine whether it is possible 
for transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) interventions to be successfully delivered by a caregiver at the 
homes of  adults who have medication -resistant MDD.    
Study objectives:  
Primary objective :  Demonstrate that remote tDCS sessions applied by a caregiver are feasible , complied and 
adhered to, and are safe in individuals with severe depression  
Secondary objective : Gather pi[INVESTIGATOR_835116] -based tDCS to induce clinically meaningful 
improvements in the severity of depression in individuals who would otherwise be offered rTMS or ECT 
treatment . 
 
Page [ADDRESS_1159687].  
Specifically, in the present protocol we seek to offer participation to : 
 Patients with medication -resistant MDD who have undergone rTMS or ECT and responded to it but whose 
benefit has lapsed, and they need repeat  a rTMS or ECT course that they cannot access  
 Patients with medication -resistant MDD who are undergoing rTMS or ECT and responding, but cannot 
continue to get the rTMS or ECT course due to COVID -19 pandemic -related regulations or other access 
concerns  
 Patients with medication -resistant MDD who are referred to rTMS or ECT and are found well qualified 
but cannot access rTMS or ECT due to COVID -[ADDRESS_1159688] address a present need due to  the COVID -19 pandemic, but also go beyond the present 
situation and address a larger, pre -existing need.  
Across all these potential groups of participants, prospective participants will : 
1. Need to have a primary psychiatrist who agrees to their participatio n in the study and is willing to continue 
to follow the patient and work collaboratively with the study team  
2. Need to be assessed by [CONTACT_835130]  
3. Need to be living with an adult willing and capable to provide oversight and learn to deliver the home -
based tDCS  
4. Have the capability to connect with the study team for daily supervision of the intervention sessions and 
close safety  monitoring, and be willing to commit to doing so  
 
Background  
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)   tDCS is a painless method for focal brain stimulation. tDCS is 
based on decades -old observations that neuronal firing is modulated by [CONTACT_835131] e electrical direct current 
(DC). Specifically, when applied to the cerebral cortex, cathodal DC inhibits neuronal firing (Creutzfedt, 1962, 
Nitsche, 2000). The mechanisms by [CONTACT_835132]‐polarization 
of the soma membrane which occurs when the api[INVESTIGATOR_835117] a 
constant electric field. The practical application of tDCS is simple: low amplitude DC is administered via scalp 
electrodes such that the cerebral cortex is exposed to cathodal DC beneath one of the electrodes, and the return 
(anodal) electrodes can be placed anywhere else on the body, or in more complex arrangements to minimize 
currents at any site. tDCS methods have also recently been adapted to rats for work with disease models (Kabakov 
2012, Rotenberg, 2014). Hundreds of tDCS trials have demonstrated the technique to be well tolerated and safe. 
Direct electrical current stimulation is presently FDA -approved for extracranial use, and FDA applications for 
cranial stimulation (tDCS) for management of mood disorder and chronic pain are in progress. tDCS units are also 
inexpensive and lightweight. The electrical supply can be derived from  conventional 9 -volt batteries.  The scalp 
electrodes can be fastened in seconds. tDCS can be combined easily with other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as those that may 
be required for resuscitation of an acutely injured patient. tDCS is presently under investigation as a treatment for 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_002] (IDE attached to this one), where excess cortic al excitability is a prominent feature of the disease 
Page 5 of 22 
 process, and where neuronal inhibition may be beneficial.  The tDCS stimulator used in this clinical study is the 
STARSTIM device (Neuroelectrics, Inc). Starstim has an associated software that allows to  personalize treatment 
per pathology an d target different brain regi on.  
tDCS and Depression  
Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) delivers weak currents into the brain through two or more 
electrodes placed on the scalp. When appropriate guidelines are followed, tDCS is safe and extremely well 
tolerated (Antal et al., 2017). The mechanisms of action remain insufficiently understood but appear to involve 
polarity -dependent shifts in neuronal membrane potentials, thus leading to purely neuro modulatory effects that 
modify likelihood of neuroplasticity effects (potentiating or suppression plasticity depending on anodal versus 
cathodal effects). Notably tDCS effects spread across functional brain networks and thus enable modulation of 
brain conn ectivity related to mood disorders and MDD.  
There has been a fairly large number of studies, including randomized, sham -controlled clinical trials (RCTs) on 
the effects of tDCS in MDD. Results have been variable and in part discrepant. For example, Brunoni  et al., 
(2017) found tDCS to have similar efficacy to antidepressant medications, while Loo et al., (2018) found no 
efficacy of real tDCS over sham in MDD. Nonetheless, several meta -analyses have concluded that tDCS is 
effective for MDD (Mutz et al., 2018 ; Brunoni et al., 2016). Most recently, Razza et al. (2020) completed a 
systematic review of all studies of tDCS for treatment of acute major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_835118] 
2020. They included all randomized, sham‐controlled clinical trials (R CTs) enrolling participants with an acute 
depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], a total of [ADDRESS_1159689] profile comparable to sham. Moffa et al. (2020) also recently published an individual patient data (IPD) 
meta -analysis evaluating the efficacy and acceptability of tDCS for treatment of acute major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. 
The IPD meta -analysi s is more accurate in estimating the efficacy of an intervention and also superior to the 
aggregated data approach for obtaining predictors of treatment outcome since it uses the raw data of each 
participant collected from each study (Riley et al., 2010). Moffa et al. included data from all published placebo -
controlled trials on tDCS as only intervention in MDD conducted until December -2018. This included 9 eligible 
studies with a total of 572 participants. They found active tDCS to be significantly superio r to sham for an 
antidepressant response (30.9% vs. 18.9% respectively; OR = 1.96), remission (19.9% vs. 11.7%, OR = 1.94), and 
depression improvement (effect size β = 0.31). Moreover, they found a consistent continuous clinical 
improvement after the end o f the tDCS treatment course. It is noteworthy that the clinical efficacy was 
substantially higher in the studies where the tDCS course was longer (3 -4 weeks versus 1 -2 weeks).  
The variability in the literature on the antidepressant effects of tDC S may reflect differences in patient selection as 
well as in the tDCS protocol. Longer courses of treatment seem particularly important to ensure sustained, lasting 
benefits. Consistent with current understanding of mechanisms of action, tDCS antidepressan t effects may involve 
long-term neuroplastic changes that take time to develop and may in fact continue to evolve and mature even after 
the tDCS treatment course has ended. This makes long treatment courses with maintenance phases important, and 
home -based  interventions appealing. Importantly, across all studies, active tDCS has been well tolerated and there 
have been no significant adverse or side effects.  
Home Use of tDCS  
tDCS, as a relatively simple and portable technology, is particularly well suited fo r remotely -supervised, home -
based treatment, which would facilitate longer periods of treatment as well as offer a suitable therapeutic option at 
the present time as we aim to deal with the COVID -[ADDRESS_1159690] developed tDCS systems for remotely -supervised, home -based use, where 
the treatment is admini stered by [CONTACT_76409] a care giver.  
Treatment parameters, scheduling and outcomes can be monitored remotely by [CONTACT_63659]. To date, 
this has been pi[INVESTIGATOR_835119] a number of conditions including neuropathic pain (Garcia -Lorrea et al., 
2019), auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia (Andrade, 2013), multiple sclerosis (Charvet et al., 2017; Charvet 
et al., 2018; Kasschau et al., 2016; Kasschau et al., 2015), Mal de Debarquement Syndrome (Cha et al., 2016), 
Parkinson's disease (Agarwal et al., 2018; Dobbs et al., 2018), trigeminal neuralgia (Hagenacker et al., 2014), 
vascular dementia (André et al., 2016) and Prader -Willi syndrome (Azevedo et al., 2017)  with promising results.  
Palm et al. (2018) completed a systematic review of all available evidence on home use of tDCS until May 2017. 
They identified 22 original research papers, trial protocols or trial registrations involving home -use tDCS, mostly 
as an add -on intervention to cognitive or physiotherapeutic intervention. Study samples were small, and many 
were single -blinded studies focused on feasibility and safety. Nonetheless, Palm et al. were able to show that 
treatment adherence was high and side -effects minimal, and thus they concluded that remotely controlled and 
supervised home -used tDCS was feasible and promising. The experience with home -use tDCS has continued to 
grow since then.  
In the setting of depression, Clayton et al., (2018) reported a ca se of one patient with comorbid multiple sclerosis 
and recurrent depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_835120] a course of remotely supervised tDCS following ECT treatment. 
Fatigue and mood ratings improved. More recently, Alonzo et al. (2019) completed a proof -of-principle, open -
label trial in 34 participants who were taught to self -administer 20 –28 tDCS sessions (2 mA, 30 min, F3 -anode 
and F8 -cathode montage according to 10 –20 EEG placement) over [ADDRESS_1159691], and confirmed with the Mini International 
Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI; Version 5.0.0) (Sheehan et al., 1998). Inclusion criteria included a current 
major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_835121] a uni - or bipolar depression; and a sco re of at 
least 20 on  the Montgomery –Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) at trial entry. Exclusion criteria were any 
DSM -IV-TR psychotic disorder; drug or alcohol abuse or dependence in the preceding 3 months; concurrent 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_109459]; high s uicide risk; history of clinically defined neurological disorder or insult; metal in 
the cranium or skull defects; skin lesions on the scalp at the proposed electrode sites; and pregnancy. Participants 
on antidepressant medication were permitted to enter t he trial provided the medication dose was unchanged for 4 
weeks prior to trial entry and during the acute treatment phase of the study. One participant was withdrawn from 
the study due to too many missed sessions. The remaining 33 participants completed 93 % of the scheduled 
sessions in the initial 4 -week phase. Ten of thirteen participants (77%) who qualified for the maintenance phase 
opted to continue. Mood improved significantly from baseline (27.5 on MADRS) to 1 month after the end of 
acute treatment (MA DRS 15.5; p < 0.001). Side effects reported across a total of 1,149 sessions were minimal, 
primarily mild to moderate tingling or burning/heat sensation during stimulation and redness at the electrode sites. 
This study provides clear, initial evidence that  home -based, remotely supervised tDCS treatment is feasible for 
depressed patients and offers a potentially effective intervention.

Process of Consent  
Potentially eligible individuals (Participants with MDD and their participant  caregiver -administrators) will each 
be emailed or snail -mailed (per request, and according to their preference) a copy of the informed consent for 
them to review at their own pace prior to the telephone screening call. Written or verbal  informed consent w ill be 
obtained by [CONTACT_349486] -person screening call, depending on the ability of the 
research team to have personal contact [CONTACT_835133] -19 precautions.  
Home -use device and training to caregivers  
Alonzo et al. (2019) used a tDCS device that required the placement of individual, large sponge electrodes onto 
the scalp in positions defined by [CONTACT_941] 10 -20 EEG electrode placements (F3 and F8) The large sponge electrodes 
needed to be held in place by [CONTACT_835134]. The procedure posed substantial challenges and precluded some 
caregivers from achieving appropriate level of competency. In addition, the interface with a programmable device 
for specification of stimulation parameters was challenging and again represented a hurdle for some patient -
caregiver pairs.  
Neuroelectrics has developed a system for home -based tDCS that effectively overcomes these challenges and is 
being used in several studies, e.g. Garcia -Lorrea 2019  https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/ [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). The 
Starstim Home Kit® (Neuroelectrics Corp) is commercially available and approved in Canada for use in treating 
chronic pain, depression and addictive disorders. It utilizes the company’s industry leading Starstim system, with 
additional fe atures that enable researchers and clinicians to “prescribe” and monitor home -based tDCS to end 
users. Briefly, the Starstim system resembles a swimming cap that fits loosely on the head, but with small 
electrodes that lie on the scalp and deliver low -level electrical currents to targeted brain regions. Within the Home 
Kit, the relevant electrode positions are marked on the headcap with different colors and numbers, and the 
corresponding electrode leads (cables) from the tDCS device are marked with the same  colors and numbers. This 
ensures that the user places the electrodes in the correct position and secures the correct lead to each electrode. 
The Home Kit also utilizes a tablet that provides the user with step -by-step instructions to set up the Starstim 
device, check electrode impedance, and record side effects. The user may also videoconference with remote staff 
in real -time. The researcher uses Neuroelectrics online Portal (NE Portal) to remotely schedule sessions and 
monitor in real -time specific treatm ent events to ensure safety.  
At the Marcus Institute we have developed a training and in -home supervision program to accompany the 
Starstim Home Kit and have established its feasibility in two ongoing studies (one focused on gait and balance 
and the other on epi[INVESTIGATOR_835122]). In these studies, to date we have completed the assessments of 
eight participant ‘pairs;’ that is, an individual to receive tDCS along with a family member, friend, or care -giver 
willing and able to administer tDCS. Each po tential administrator was initially screened to ensure that they would 
be available throughout the intervention period and to ensure they had at least minimal computer proficiency. 
They were then trained by [CONTACT_835135] -reported comfort in the process and were deemed proficient as determined with a custom -
developed checklist. For all eight participant -pairs, the administrators, who ranged in age from [ADDRESS_1159692] eight sessions of the 10 -session 
intervention. No adverse events were reported. Transient skin redness and tingling sensations under the electrode 
were the only reported si de effects and the frequency and severity of these side effects were similar to that 
reported in published staff -administered interventions. Upon exit interview, all administrators —and the 
participants who received the stimulation —stated that the Home Kit and training materials were easy to use, that

required suppli es and documentation.

Page [ADDRESS_1159696] medical occurrence in a participant, whether or not is is causally related to the 
study. An adverse event can there fore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom or disease temporally associated with the study.  
Adverse events will be recorded on the appropriate case report forms and source documents. The inv estigator 
and/or trained staff member will evaluate all adverse events as to their severity and relation to the test article. The 
severity of adverse events will be graded as follows:  
Mild: Awareness of a sign or symptom but easily tolerated.  
Moderate: Dis comfort sufficient to cause interference with usual activity or to affect clinical status.  
Severe: Incapacitating with inability to do usual activity or to significantly affect clinical status.  
Life Threatening: The participant was at immediate risk of death from the adverse event as it occurred.  
The Investigator will also assess the relationship of any adverse event to study, based upon available information, 
using the following guidelines:  
0 = Unlikely: No temporal association, or the ca use of the event has been identified. 1 = Possible: Temporal 
association, but other etiologies are likely to be the cause; however, involvement of the study procedures cannot 
be excluded.  
2 = Probable: Temporal association, other etiologies are possible, b ut not likely.   
 
A serious adverse event  is any experience that results in any of the following outcomes: death,is life threatening,  
results in  inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_835124], a persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_372203] a serious adverse event when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the 
patient or participant a nd may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition.

Risks  
The medical risks are described in the adverse event section. Other risks related to the loss of confidentiality are 
described in the confidentiality section with steps we will take to mitigate any such risk.  
Participant Burden:  Participation in this protocol will require moderate subject time and effo rt. Therefore, in 
addition to recommended safety measures described below, additional efforts will be taken to minimize subject 
burden and maximize retention throughout the study. It is of note that our study team has a strong track record of 
successful cl inical research requiring similar participation and retention has been high in these efforts.  
Several strategies will be employed to minimize subject burden and maximize adherence to the protocol.  
Specifically we will:  
 Develop a personal relationship between subjects and members of the staff by [CONTACT_835142].  
 Schedule appointments at convenient times with familiar staff.  
 Explain to subjects all aspects of their participation.  
Page 14 of 22 
  Provide reminders of all appointm ents. 
 Include personal notes in the subject's data file to remember events in the life of the participant; these can 
be commented on at future visits (e.g. birth of a grandchild)
Any participant who suffers an adverse event dur ing the conduct of study protocols will be triaged immediately 
by [CONTACT_253294], and the study psychiatrist.  The study PI [INVESTIGATOR_835125] A/E’s.  If follow up care is needed to treat an A/E,  the investigators will arrange to have  
this care provided at a nearby [CONTACT_14189] , convenient to the study participant. . The treating provider will bill the 
insurance company or other third parties, if appropriate, for the care a participant receives for any  injury. We will 
try to have these costs paid for, but the participant may be responsible for some of them. For example, they may 
be responsible for payment of any deductibles and  co-payments required by [CONTACT_349511]. There are no plans to 
provide any compe nsation for an injury beyond what is described above, should one occur.  
If there is a change in the clinical condition of the participant, the study psychiatrist will contact [CONTACT_423]’s 
treating/primary psychiatrist so that appropriate primary clinical care can be prov ided. 
If, during the course of this study, the participant experiences an urgent medical need, he/she will be advised to  seek 
immediate medical care, including contact[CONTACT_835143]/psychiatrist as indicated.  
 
There is no cost to the participant or insurer for the device. 
 
Benefits  
While there are no definitive benefits to participants as a result of participation in this study, MDD participants 
who received tDCS interventions in prior studies  showed improvement of symptoms.
Most recently, Razza et al. (2020) completed a systematic review of all studies of tDCS for treatment of acute 
major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_835118] 2020. They included all randomized, sham‐contro lled clinical 
trials (RCTs) enrolling participants with an acute depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], a total of [ADDRESS_1159697] profile comparable to sham.  
Moffa et al. (2020) also recently published an individual patient data (IPD) meta -analysis evaluating the efficacy 
and acceptability of tDCS for treatment of acute major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] s. The IPD meta -analysis is more 
accurate in estimating the efficacy of an intervention and also superior to the aggregated data approach for 
obtaining predictors of treatment outcome since it uses the raw data of each participant collected from each study  
(Riley et al., 2010). Moffa et al. included data from all published placebo -controlled trials on tDCS as only 
intervention in MDD conducted until December -2018. This included 9 eligible studies with a total of 572 
participants. They found active tDCS to b e significantly superior to sham for an antidepressant response (30.9% 
vs. 18.9% respectively; OR = 1.96), remission (19.9% vs. 11.7%, OR = 1.94), and depression improvement 
(effect size β = 0.31). Moreover, they found a consistent continuous clinical impr ovement after the end of the 
tDCS treatment course. It is noteworthy that the clinical efficacy was substantially higher in the studies where the 
tDCS course was longer (3 -4 weeks versus 1 -2 weeks).  
Page 15 of 22 
 The ultimate goal of this work is to identify the potenti al of tDCS as a home therapy to induce improvements of 
MDD for patients with the disease. We anticipate that this specific study will demonstrate that remote tDCS 
sessions are feasible in this population, and offer an important and convenient alternative f or multi -session tDCS 
administration in adults with MDD.  
 
Visits (All visits will be conducted remotely)  
For this study, participant caregiver administrators will be provided  remote step -by-step training to administer the 
tDCS sessions to the participants with MDD.  Participant caregiver -administrators will be directly supervised 
remotely, until they demonstrate proficiency, without coaching by [CONTACT_3476].  We have developed a step by 
[CONTACT_835144], and have successfully trained older adult ca regiv ers to administer the tDCS .

End of study: Results sent to participant with MDD  and treating psychiatrist  
Daily sessions (28 daily sessions) : The device will be used to apply 20 minutes of tDCS to the participant 
with MDD's scalp in each of 28 daily sessions.    
 
Thereafter, participants with MDD will undergo a taper phase of an additional 9 sessions of tDCS applied in 
progressively decreasing frequency until day #60 of the study as follows:  
(1) First taper phase : three  30 minute s tDCS sessions applied every other  day; 
(2) Second taper phase:  three [ADDRESS_1159701]  day; 
(3) Third and final taper phase:  three final [ADDRESS_1159702] convenient two hour window for the  
home  administration.  During remote tDCS administration, the study team  will be notified electronically by 
[CONTACT_835149],  or if the tDCS session 
was aborted, or not completed during the predetermined two hour  window.  
 
The device will contain a sequence of simplified screen prompts for the participant,. To move to the next 
screen the participant will press a circl e on the screen to continue (or to stop)  
For example:  
1. Hello  
2. Battery status is  GOOD  
3. Today is Monday (date) It is now ( )  o'clock  
4. Wear the  Cap 
Page 18 of 22 
 5. Check  the electrodes  - 1 green  is in the 1 green  hole and secure,  2 yellow  is in the 2 yellow hole and  
secure.  
6. Are you ready for your 30 minute s session? If yes, press  continue  
7. Session  has started,  please  stay in place  until session  is over [clock  appears  on screen  to count down 
the minutes]  
8. Session has ended, please stay in place while the device powers  off. 
9. Session is now completed! You may turn off the tablet, and remove the cap and  electrodes  
 
Daily sessions (28 daily sessions) : The device will contain a block that will only allow one session  to be 
administered  within  a 24 hour period.  If a session  is started  and aborted,  the participant  will not be able to 
administer  a new session  until the next day, 24 hours  later.  
 
During the taper phas e - the device block will only allow:  
 
First taper phase : Thre e sessions, one every other day . If a session is started and aborted, the participant 
will not be able to administer a new session until [ADDRESS_1159703] been 
administered, (which will include any session that was started and aborted), a new session will not be 
availab le until the next scheduled session. The study team will monitor participant study adherence through 
completed sessions and through video conferencing and telephone contact.  
 
Second taper phase:  Three sessions, once every third day. If a session is started  and aborted, the participant 
will not be able to administer a new session until [ADDRESS_1159704] been 
administered, (which will include any session that was started and aborted),  a new session  will not be 
available  until the next scheduled  session.  The study  team will continue to monitor participant study 
adherence through completed sessions and through video conferencing and telephone  contact.  
 
Third and final taper phase : Three sessions, once every fourth day. If a session is started and aborted, the 
participant will not be able to administer a new session until [ADDRESS_1159705] been 
administered, (which will include any session that was started and aborted), the sessions will be completed.  
 
Statistical  Methods and  Analysis  
 
Primary  
Feasibility and tolerability/safety will be evaluated using home -based data as it is collected by [CONTACT_835150] . 
 
The primary outcome  will be change in the observer rated MADRS score from baseline to the 1 -month follow -
up.  
 
Clinical response is defined as ≥ 50% improvement in MADRS score from baseline to the 1 -month follow -up.
Remission is defined as a MADRS score ≤ 10 . 
 
The secondary outcome  measures will include the participant -rated Quick Inventory of Depressive 
Symptomatology (QIDS -SR) (Rush et al., 2003) and the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction 
Questionnaire Short Form (Q -LES-Q-SF) (Endicott et al., 1993), both administered at the same time points as 
the MADRS. A computer -based cognitive test battery, CogState (https://www.  cogstate.com), will provide an 
additional safety outcome measure. This bat tery includes tests designed to assess verbal learning and memory 
(International Shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_96063]), attention and psychomotor function (Detection Task), visual attention 
(Identification Task), visual learning and memory (One Card Learning Task), working memory (Two Back 
Task), and executive function (Set Shifting Task).  
 
Statistics  
Page 19 of 22 
  
Primary Analysis Plan for efficacy  
The primary outcome measure is the median percentage change (across study subjects) in s MADRS from 
baseline to [ADDRESS_1159706]; however, since this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_835127], demonstration of a significant 
effect is not a defined goal of the study . 
 
Sample Size  
The samples size of 50 is well within the sample size of previous published studies.  
Withdrawal and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_835128] a participant's participation include the participant's request, as well as any 
unexpected life -threatening or potentially disabling event.  
 
A study subject may be withdrawn from the study at any time if the study subject, the investigator, or the 
Sponsor feels that it is not in the study subject’ s best interest to continue.  
 
All study subjects are free to withdraw from participation at any time, for any reason, specified or 
unspecified, and without prejudice.  
 
Reasonable attempts will be made by [CONTACT_29170] a reason for study subje ct withdrawals. The 
reason for the study subject’s withdrawal from the study will be specified in the study subject’s source 
documents.  
Stimulation Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_835129]  8-week treatment period:  
 
 Clinician impression of substantial worsening of medical condition  
 If the study subject misses more than 10 stimulation visits.  
 
Study subjects will be withdrawn from the study for the following:  
 
 If the study  subject  is not compliant  with the study  procedures  as determined  by [CONTACT_1275].  
 
 If, in the investigator’s  opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649],  it is not safe for the study  subject  to continue  with participation in the  
study.  
 
 If the study  subject  is withdrawn  from  the study,  the subjects  treating  psychiatrist  will be notified 
so that arrangements can be made for continued treatment of his/her  MDD.  
 
 The study team will be notified by [CONTACT_835151], and immedia te follow up will occur.  
 
 Any adverse events that take place during testing will be reported to the PI ([CONTACT_835155] -
Leone  )and recorded in the database. Drs. Pascual -Leone, Metzger and Lipsitz will have primary 
responsibility for monitoring participant safety in the trial. The investigators will be responsible for 
reviewing each adverse event in a timely fashion and preparing a summary report for submission to 
the IRB.

Protocol ADVM -043-[ADDRESS_796426] treatment. 
The advantage of adeno -associated viral ( AAV ) vectors in gene therapy is the low propensity of 
vector genome integration in the host DNA. However, recently there has been attention to potential AAV -induced genotoxicity from systemic or liver -directed gene therapy . To date, 
mouse studies have varied in their findings in neonatal, juvenile, and  adult animals . 
AAV genome integration has been observed in neonatal mice that demonstrated a higher risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_601436] ( Bell 2005; Chandler 2015). This 
insertional mutagenesis to an oncogenic locus (Rian) reported after neonatal gene delivery is thought to be influenced by [CONTACT_601438], as juvenile and adult rodents have not demonstrated similar findings. Furthermore, the site of AAV integration in mice has no analogue in humans ( Bell 2005; 
Chandler 2015). Long-term larger animal studies in dogs (through 8 years) and nonhuman primates (through 5 years) have not shown such genotoxicity ( Niemeyer 2009; Nathwani 2011).  
To date, there has been no evidence of tumor formation or long- term hepatotoxicity in a 
hemophilia B gene therapy trial where [ADDRESS_796427] 4 years after vector delivery ( Nathwani 2014 ). 
In alpha -1 antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency, intramuscular delivery of an AAV1 vector containing 
a functional A1AT transgene was administered to 18  human subjects ( Gruntman 2015). One of 
the subjects in the highest dose group followed for at least [ADDRESS_796428]- treatment for safety and 
protein expression still demonstrated measurable A1AT levels without any negative sequelae (Mueller 2017). This suggests gene therapy has the potential for long-term protein expression 
and consequent disease impact .

6.0 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
6.1 Safety Parameters  
• Adverse events  
6.[ADDRESS_796436] should be collected 
and reported. 
Adverum Biotechnologies, Inc. ADVM -043 (AAVrh.10hA1AT)  
Protocol ADVM -043-[ADDRESS_796437] include the following : 
• new malignancy 
• new incidence or exacerbation of a pre -existing neurologic disorder 
• new incidence or exacerbation of a prior rheumatologic or other autoimmune disorder 
• unexpected hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
6.[ADDRESS_796438] that results in death; is 
immediately life -threatening; requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_253733]; results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; or is a congenital 
anomaly or birth defect. Only SAEs related to ADVM -[ADDRESS_796439]’s daily 
activities . The intensity of the AE will be rated according to the Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) ( National Cancer Institute 2017):  
• Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. 
• Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activity of daily living (preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money). 
• Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self -
care activi ty of daily living (bathing, dressing, and undressing, feeding self, using the 
toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden). 
• Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. 
• Grade 5: Death related to AE.  
Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity . AEs characterized as intermittent do not require 
documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
6.5 Assessment of Causality  
The Investigator ’s assess ment of relationship of an AE to ADVM -043 is part of the 
documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported. If there is 
any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event is to be reported. 
Adverum Biotechnologies, Inc. ADVM -043 (AAVrh.10hA1AT)  
Protocol ADVM -043-03 Amendment 2 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 15 of 25 Investigator should assess potential causes of each AE  and events should be considered related if 
there is “a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship” rather than if “a causal relationship 
cannot be ruled out.” When assessing causality, Investigators should assess biological balancing — the probability that the suspect drug caused the AE must be weighed against the probability that an alternative candidate caused it.  
Causality of AEs should be assessed in relation to ADVM-043, and not prior concomitant medicati ons or study procedures in the previous treatment study. The relationship or association 
of ADVM -043 in causing or contributing to the AE is to be characterized using the following 
criteria:  
• Definitely Related: A definite causal relationship exists between  study drug 
administration and the AE; including a plausible time relationship to study drug administration, and it cannot be explained by [CONTACT_305827]/exposures. 
• Likely Related:  There is a reasonable possibility that th e study drug caused the AE ; 
the event is unlikely attributed to underlying or concurrent disease or other drugs/exposures ( i.e., alternative explanation) . There is a reasonable time sequence to 
administration of the study drug. 
• Unlikely Related:  Underlying or concurrent disease or other drugs/exposures provide plausible alternative explanations. Temporal relationship to study drug administration makes a causal relationship improbable. 
• Not Related: There is no association between the study drug and the reported event; there is a clear alternative explanation; a causal relationship is non -plausible.

(Section 6.2 and Section  6.3).

Information to be collected includes event term per CTCAE Version 5.0 ( National Cancer 
Institute 2017); date of onset; Investigator assessment of seriousness, severity, and relationship to ADVM -043; date of resolution of the event; any required concomitant medication  or treatment ; 
evaluations for malignancies and results such as biopsy results; and outcome.

Classes of mutagenic medications  / agents  include, but are not limited to: 
• alkylating agents ( e.g., cyclophosphamide) 
• anthracyclines (e.g., doxorubicin) 
• platinum- based agents ( e.g., carboplatin) 
• retinoids (e.g., tretinoin)  
• vinca alkaloids (e.g., vincristine)  
• topoisomerase inhibitors (e.g., etoposide) 
• antimetabolites  / nucleotide analogues ( e.g., methotrexate)  
• aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., benzene)  
• toxic heavy metals and metalloids (e. g., arsenic)

 Specific Aims 
The purpose of this study is to determine if  a customized therapy, Acoustic Coordinated 
Reset (CR) Neuromodulation (also referred to  as Desyncra) reduces tinnitus-related 
distress with comparable efficacy as for C ognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for people 
who have bothersome tinnitus.  Inclusion Criteria

 Dominant tinnitus frequency measured between 0.2 and 10 kHz 
 Tinnitus Questionnaire (TQ) score ≥30 at screening (to confirm moderate to 
severe tinnitus) 
 No current participation in other tinnitus therapy program 
 Willing and able to listen to the acoustic prescription for 4-6 hours daily during the 
trial 
 Able to pass the Tone Audibility Assessment with fact or of 1.1   
 Exclusion Criteria 
 Secondary/somatic tinnitus due to a su spected underlying disease (defined by 
[CONTACT_317489]-HNSF guidelines) 
 Atonal, pulsatile, intermittent, or occasi onal tinnitus (determined by [CONTACT_6270]-report 
and by [CONTACT_317490])

aminoglycoside antibiotics, daily high dose non-steroidal anti-in flammatory drugs 
≥1000 mg, salicylates (when not prescribed as  a low dose for cardiac health), 
loop diuretics and chemotherapy  agents like cis-platin] at  the discretion of the 
Principal Investigator

3 
 than two frequencies in one ear

 Desyncra Group.  Subjects randomized to the Desyncra group will be fit with the 
devices. The Research Audiologists will be trained by a Desyncra representative to 
dispense the Desyncra for Tinnitus Therapy System according to company guidelines. 
The devices are fitted and programmed based on the subject’s tinnitus characteristics 
and hearing ability at the first visit and the subject will use the device for 4-[ADDRESS_390885] reporting his/her ti nnitus has completely vanished, the subject 
will be instructed to reduce t he amount of time using the therapy device to [ADDRESS_390886]’s tinnitus characteristics become outside the range where tinnitus is 
treatable (e.g., too-high or too- low tinnitus pi[INVESTIGATOR_23025]), the clinicia n may stop therapy for up to 
[ADDRESS_390887] as per the recommendations 
outlined in the AAO-HNSF gui deline (Tunkel et al 2014).

 Statistical Analysis Plan 
A Bayesian approach to the analysis of outcome data will be used. Based on simulations across several conditions, we ant icipate requiring a total of no more than 
[ADDRESS_390889] 80% power to identify a significant benefit of Desyncra 
therapy compared to CBT.  Data from this study will be provided to t he NCRAR Data Manager who will develop and 
maintain a database with all study data. Either the Data M anager or other study 
personnel (e.g. Research Assistant) will enter  the data. The Data Manager will perform 
double entry of the data and che ck for any errors, which will be remediated. After the 
study is complete and all data are entered and verified, the Data Manager will conduct 
preliminary analyses of the data to determine if there are any differences in outcomes 
between groups. These analyses will be overs een by [CONTACT_317492].   A preliminary analysis will be conducted afte r a total of ~[ADDRESS_390890] formal interim analysis 
will be conducted after a tota l of ~[ADDRESS_390891] been r andomized and completed the 
24 week follow-up visit or ~16 subjects per  treatment arm. A second formal interim 
analysis will occur after a total of ~[ADDRESS_390892] been randomized (~31 subjects per 
treatment arm) and completed the 24-week follow-up. The primary endpoint of this 
study occurs 24 weeks after being dispensed the Desyncra device at which time the 
primary outcome measure,  the TQ, is repeated.  
 The efficacy of Desyncra will be assessed by [CONTACT_317493]’ change from baselin e on the TQ outcome. The δ parameters describe the 
overall change from baseline comm on to both treatment arms. The φ parameters 
describe the benefits of Desyncra over CBT in  this study. We assume that the TQ 
observations are Gaussian random variables  with population mean defined above plus 
a subject-specific random intercept θ
i, and with residual standard deviation σ.

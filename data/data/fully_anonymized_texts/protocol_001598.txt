1.0 INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND  
1.1 Disrupt CAD III IDE Study  
The objective of the Disrupt CAD III investigational device exemption (IDE) study was to 
assess the safety and effectiveness of the Shockwave Intravascular Lithotripsy (IVL) 
System with Shockwave C2 Coronary Intravascular Lithotripsy (IVL) Catheter, hereafter 
referenced as the Shockwave Coronary IVL System, to treat de novo, calcified, stenotic, 
coronary lesions prior to stenting against objective performance goals.  
A total of 431 subjects (47 roll -in, 384 pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735]) were enrolled from 47 centers in the United 
States, [LOCATION_009], [LOCATION_013] and the [LOCATION_006]. Enrollment began in January 2019 and was 
completed in March 2020. The primary safety endpoint was freedom from major adverse 
cardiac events (MACE) through 30 days and the primary effectiveness endpoint of 
Procedural Success (defined as stent delivery with a residual stenosis < 50% without in -
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13715]) was evaluated at discharge. The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_89318] (n=384) was the 
prima ry analysis cohort used to assess the primary safety and effectiveness endpoints.  
The study met its primary safety endpoint. The observed freedom from 30 -day MACE was 
92.2% (353/383) and the lower bound of the one -sided 95% confidence interval was 89.9%, 
greater than the performance goal of 84.4%. As such, the null hypothesis was reject ed, and 
the primary safety endpoint was met (p<0.0001).  The study also met its primary 
effectiveness endpoint. The observed rate of Procedural Success was 92.4% (355/384) and 
the lower bound of the one -sided 95% confidence interval was 90.2%, greater than  the 
performance goal of 83.4%. As such, the null hypothesis was rejected, and the primary 
effectiveness endpoint was met (p<0.0001).  
On February 12, 2021, the Shockwave Coronary IVL System was granted FDA approval. 
As part of the FDA Conditions of Approval, Shockwave Medical is conducting a Post 
Approval Registry leveraging the ACC NCDR® CathPCI Registry®.  Established registries 
like the CathPCI Registry® are an efficient way to collect objective clinical endpoint data on 
large, real -world populations from a broad spectrum of institutions.  
1.[ADDRESS_98169]® CathPCI Registry® 
Developed in 1997 by [CONTACT_9664] (ACC), the NCDR® was created 
as an exploration into strategies for improving cardiovascular care through the use and 
application of clinical data. Today, the NCDR® is a reputable and dependable quality 
improvement resource that continues to evolve to meet the demands of the changing health 
care environment.  
Currently, the NCDR® suite of cardiovascular data registries covers several clinical areas 
including acute myocardial infarction (MI) treatment, diagnostic cardiac catheterization and 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and transcatheter valve therapy procedures.

The CathPCI Registry® assesses the characteristics, treatments and outcomes of cardiac 
disease patients who receive diagnostic catheterization and/or PCI procedures. The tool 
captures the data that measure adherence to ACC/AHA clinical practice guideline 
recommendations, proce dure performance standards and appropriate use criteria (AUC) 
for coronary revascularization.  Over 1700 institutions currently participate in the CathPCI 
Registry®, representing over 95% of US centers performing PCI procedures. Data o n over 
750,000 patients undergoing PCI are collected annually. The CathPCI Registry® is 
approved as non -exempt human subject research under [ADDRESS_98170] Coronary IVL System 
in a ”real -world” setting following FDA approval.

2.0 DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS  
2.1 Data Collection Forms  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_89319]® Data Collection Form. All data in the registry is site -reported; there is no independent 
adjudication of adverse events or core lab assessment of angiographic characteristics.  
The CathPCI Registry® data collection form will be used for this study and captures information 
on each PCI case including:  
• Demographics  
• History and Risk Factors  
• Pre-Procedure information (diagnostics, medications)  
• Procedural details  
o Concomitant procedures  
o Target lesion characteristics (site -reported)  
o Devices used  
o Post-intervention stenosis (site -reported)  
• Intra and post -procedure adverse events  
• Discharge information  
• Follow -up information at 30 days (adverse events, medications) (for sites that have 
opted in to report data beyond discharge)  
Observational information on IVL -specific data will be collected on a separate IVL Addendum 
developed by [CONTACT_89322].  The IVL Addendum form captures procedural 
information including:  
• Ventricular arrhythmias during IVL pulses  
• IVL balloon loss pressure or burst/rupture  
• Serious dissections related to IVL burst/rupture  
• Inappropriate ICD shocks during delivery of IVL pulses  
• Adverse interactions between IVL and the PPM  
2.[ADDRESS_98171] on procedures in the CathPCI Registry® 
where a Shockwave C2 Coronary IVL catheter was used.  The reports will include all fields 
contained in the Data Collection form and all fields in the IVL Addendum.   
Shockwave will filter the data to identify patients with clinical characteristics similar to the 
population studied in the Disrupt CAD III study using the eligibility criteria outlined above .

2.[ADDRESS_98172]® employ a multipronged 
approach to ensure that high quality data are captured by [CONTACT_89323]: 
(1) National audit program, (2) data quality checks and system alerts, (3) trained data capture 
personnel, (4) data capture software r ules, and (5) data dictionary development.  
1. National Audit Program  
Each registry within the NCDR® has a data audit conducted annually. Facilities are 
randomly selected for participation in the audit , which compares the medical record data 
provided to the auditor by [CONTACT_89324].  
2. Data Quality Checks and System Alerts  
Patient data are entered directly and securely to the registries through a web -based data 
collection tool. The Data Quality Check function provides real -time alerts that identify 
out-of-range errors and incomplete data so that participants may return to th e relevant 
fields and correct/complete them.  
Prior to any large -scale analysis of any registry data, a number of additional range and 
logic checks will be conducted to ensure data completeness and validity.  
3. Trained Data Collection Personnel  
Facilities participating in the NCDR® may employ varied personnel for data capture and 
entry. Physicians provide clinical and programmatic oversight and each facility has an 
assigned Registry Site Manager (RSM) to oversee data collection and registry reporting.  
4. Data Capture Software Rules  
The NCDR® provides participating facilities a web -based tool to capture patient data that 
conforms to clinical and technical specifications for core elements, definitions, coding, 
editing, transmission, and encryption protocols. The rigor of these technical 
specifi cations explicitly impacts the quality of data captured by [CONTACT_18120] a series of 
rules that create a uniform platform for data to be collected across multiple facilities.  
5. Data Dictionary Development  
The selection of registry data elements are based on input from clinical experts, 
regulatory agencies, and industry. These evidence -based elements are intended to 
measure clinical practice and patient outcomes for each patient, as well as identify 
patterns  of clinical care and facilitate risk judgment.  
2.4 Statistical Analysis  
Interim results and final results will be analyzed using descriptive statistics; there is no formal 
hypothesis testing for the PAS.  The sample size of 1000 is sufficient to accommodate 
approximately 30 PPM/ICD patients.

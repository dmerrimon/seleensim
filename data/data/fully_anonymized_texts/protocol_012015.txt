Clinical phase II
Trial rationale The aim of this trial is to investigate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, PK and PD of three oral doses of BI [ADDRESS_738857] of care according to respective guidelines. The results of this trial will be crucial for the decision about further development of BI 685509 and will support the dose selection for future trials.
Trial objectives The main objectives of the trial are to demonstrate the effectiveness of BI 685509 and to characterize the dose-response relationship for BI 685509 in patients with DKD by [CONTACT_58833] 3 doses and placebo.
Trial endpoints Primary endpoint:Change from baseline in log transformed UACR measured in 10-hour urine after 20 weeks of trial treatment.
Secondary endpoints:
Change from baseline in log transformed UACR measured in First Morning Void urine after [ADDRESS_738858] 20% from baseline after [ADDRESS_738859] 20% from baseline after 20 weeks of trial treatment.
Trial design Randomised, parallel design comparison of 3 dose groups over 20 weeks of treatment, double-blind within dose group, placebo controlled

Duration of treatment [ADDRESS_738861] of treatment at each visit, and the fixed continuous effects of baseline log transformed UACR at each visit. Visit will be treated as the repeated measure with an unstructured covariance matrix used to model the within-patient measurements. The adjusted mean change from baseline (and the related standard error) will be calculated for each group and will be used for the MCPMod to determine therapeutic dose. The analyses for dose-finding will be performed using MCPMod whereby [CONTACT_195873] (patterns) will be evaluated to identify the best-fitting model or subset of models.
Regarding analyses of the secondary endpoints,
1. MMRM will be used for the analysis for the change of UACR 
in First Morning Void.

ivThe timepoint of first treatment (Visit 3) defines Day 1.
vVisits [ADDRESS_738866] an End of Treatment (EoT) visi t, if they agree. Please see section 6.2.4 for details.
viiThese visits can either be performed at the Investigational site or at the patient’s home. All local approvals for this must be  in place and confirmed by [CONTACT_456]. Consent for home visits 
must also be obtained from the patient. See section 6.2.1 for further details.
viiiThere are various ways that Telemedicine contacts (phone call or video call) can be used during this trial:
1. Telemedicine contact [CONTACT_195875]’s urine sampling. Before the patient does their first UACR and eGFR sampl ing at home (before Visit 2) the investigational site 
staff should contact [CONTACT_195876]. The other timepoints marked as  ‘(X)’ are suggested times to contact [CONTACT_562334][INVESTIGATOR_562327]. The site may, at their discre tion, offer support with further home sampling according 
to the individual needs of a patient. 
2. Telemedicine calls at visit 6 (marked as “O”) and/or FUp2. If this visit is being performed at the patient’s home by a nurse,  a telemedicine contact [CONTACT_562335], patient and an Investigator who will guide the nurse through the physical exam (see section 6.2.1 ).
3. FUp1 must be performed as telemedicine contact [CONTACT_195879], unless they prefer to come to the trial site.
4. Phone/ video calls may also take place at any other time if needed to support the patient.
ixInformed consent does not need to be obtained on the day of the screening visit but must be obtained before the first screening  assessment and within 35 days of randomisation (Visit 3). 
The consent discussion should include showing the patient the home sampling kits and explaining this procedure.
xOnce screening assessments have been completed, a member of the trial team will contact [CONTACT_195880].
xiAt Visits [ADDRESS_738867] at Screening (Visit 1 ), thereafter a urine pregnancy test will be performed.
xviiiTo confirm eligibility at Visit 1, UACR measured in spot urine (midstream urine sample) by [CONTACT_195881].  Should the first test for UACR at screening be borderline 
out of range and not match inclusion criteria due to UACR variability, this test can be repeated once. The result must be avail able and eligibility confirmed before the baseline UACR 
sampling starts. If the second result does not meet the eligibility criteria the patient should be screen failed.
xixTraining on how to use the  device and how to do the FMV and 10-hour sampling will be provided to the patient at the screening visit. This will include instructions 
regarding sample shipments / what to bring in for clinic visits.

should return the samples to the investigational site. Countries may be exempted from microsampling if use of the  is not permi tted in that country.
xxiPatients will need to complete 2 different diaries. The ‘Diary for Urine and Blood Collection and Trial Drug Times’ will enable  the site to record information entered during urine and 
blood collection at home and 2 days prior to PK sampling including times of trial drug intake, start and stop times of collecti on and volumes. The ‘Daily Diary for Trial Drug 
Intake’ will help to check the compliance of the patient and a possible need for down-titration. If the patient chooses they wi ll be able to download an app containing the diaries to their 
phone at visit [ADDRESS_738870] dose.
xxiiiAll AEs, SAEs and AESIs will be collected from informed consent until FUp1 (end of residual effect period). Please see section [IP_ADDRESS].1 .
xxivAfter FUp1 until the individual patient’s end of trial, the investigator should report any cancers of new histology and exacerb ations of existing cancer, all trial treatment related SAEs and 
all trial treatment related AESIs. Please see section [IP_ADDRESS].1 .
xxvAs detailed in section [IP_ADDRESS].1 after the individual patient’s end of the trial the investigator does not need to actively monitor the patient for new AEs but should report any occurrence of 
cancer and trial treatment related SAEs and trial treatment related AESIs of which the investigator may become aware of by [CONTACT_31617] m eans of communication, e.g. phone call. Those AEs 
should be reported on the BI SAE form (see section [IP_ADDRESS].2 ), but not on the CRF.

(8 to 10 patients) were responders, compared with no patients receiving placebo [ c30365927-
01].
Based on recent data from a clinical trial (1366-0020) in patients with cirrhosis Child-Pugh 
stage A (24 patients) and B (25 patients), an effect of BI 685509 on the predicted placebo-corrected change from baseline QTcF ( ∆∆QTcF) was seen. Dosing regimens up to [ADDRESS_738895] dose group in this trial, were used. In both patient groups, there was a dose dependent increase of ∆∆QTcF up to 13.7 ms, with the upper 90% CI >20 ms. In one 
patient group (Child-Pugh B) this was concomitant with a change of the predicted placebo-corrected change from baseline heart rate ( ∆∆HR) of > 10 beats per minute (bpm), but not in 
the other patient group. No such effect was seen in a healthy Caucasian volunteers trial (1366-0010) for dosing regimens used in this trial. In a healthy Asian volunteers trial (1366-0013), at a dose regimen relevant for this study (i.e. starting with 1 mg tid up to a final dose of 3 mg tid), an increase of ∆∆QTcF was seen up to 11.7 ms with 90% CI <20 ms, 
concomitant with an increase of ∆∆HR of nearly [ADDRESS_738896] on human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) channel at doses used 
in this clinical trial, and no effect on QT-interval was seen in conscious animal studies.

1.3 RATIONALE FOR PERFORMING THE TRIAL
Although ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) have 
demonstrated efficacy in slowing the progression of diabetic kidney disease, the relative risk reduction was moderate (16% in the RENAAL [Reduction of Endpoints in NIDDM with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan] trial and 19% in the IDNT [Irbesartan Diabetic Nephropathy Trial]) for the triple composite primary endpoint of all-cause death, ESRD and doubling of serum creatinine [ R02-0327 ], [R02-2101 ]. The residual risk remains high. Even 
with the advent of SGLT2 inhibitors that will provide an additional treatment option for 
renally compromised patients, there is still a large unmet medical need for effective and safe treatments that can further slow, halt or reverse the progression of diabetic kidney disease, and positively impact the patient’s quality of life.
The aim of this trial is to investigate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, PK and PD of three oral 
doses of BI [ADDRESS_738897] of care according to respective guidelines. The results of this trial will be crucial for the decision about further development of BI 685509 and will support the dose selection for future trials.
In order to be able to address future scientific questions, patients will be asked to voluntarily 
donate biospecimens for banking (please see section 5.5 ). If the patient agrees, banked

Treatment with BI 685509 will potentially result in decreased progression towards dialysis or kidney transplantation due to preventing the progression of renal damage, which may directly translate into relevant improvements for patients’ morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. Beyond that, it may reduce the number of cardiovascular events in the target population.

1.4.3 Discussion
Based on pre-clinical results, BI 685509 has the potential to slow progression of renal 
damage, delay end stage renal disease (ESRD) and reduce cardiovascular events such as cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23224], in patients with DKD. In addition, clinical studies in healthy volunteers and DKD patients have shown that it is well tolerated when up-titrated to the doses to be administered in this trial.
A placebo arm is needed to allow for a true assessment of the effects of BI [ADDRESS_738905] on progression of 
DKD in humans and based on the safety profile of BI 685509, the benefit-risk evaluation of the compound is considered favourable for the intended trial population.

3.1 OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN
This trial is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind (within dose groups), parallel, placebo-
controlled clinical trial to compare three doses of BI [ADDRESS_738911] of care according to respective local guidelines.
A schematic illustration of the trial design is presented in Figure 3.1: 1 .
Figure 3.1: 1 Trial design
Patients will be enrolled (screened) in the trial once they have signed the informed consent. 
They will undergo a screening period of up to 3 weeks from the time of informed consent.
After their eligibility has been confirmed at screening, patients will continue in a 2-week 
baseline run in period. Patients who successfully complete the screening and baseline run-in period and meet the inclusion / exclusion criteria will be randomised equally into one of three parallel dose groups, and in each dose group to treatment either with BI 685509 or matching placebo in a 3:1 ratio (see Figure 3.1: 1 ).
From the start of the run-in until the end of the trial, at various time points patients will 
collect their urine for UACR sampling. These timepoints are listed in the UACR and eGFR 
flow chart . For each day that UACR is collected patients will start by [CONTACT_54315] a First 
Morning Void urine in the container provided. As soon as the First Morning Void sample is 
collected the clock starts for the 10-hour urine collection. During this 10-hour period every time the patient urinates, they collect their urine into the provided container. An aliquot of this urine will be taken and used as the 10-hour UACR sample.
Once at each time point of urine collection patients will also give blood samples for eGFR 
analysis. For each time point where a physical visit to the site is not foreseen, the patient will

confounding effect, treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors will have to be kept stable prior to trial 
participation and throughout trial treatment (see section [IP_ADDRESS] ). An approximate of 10%

A first follow-up telephone call (FUp1) at least [ADDRESS_738915] Period (REP). Until the end of REP all AEs and changes to concomitant medication need to be collected, documented and reported.
During the entire follow-up period the patient will not be treated with trial medication, but 
should if possible continue with any background treatment they were on, and will collect additional urine and/or blood samples at home. At the end of the 4-week follow-up a last physical visit will occur where again blood and urine samples will be collected. Depending on local regulations and approvals this visit may occur at the site or the patient’s home. With the conclusion of this visit the trial participation is complete for the individual patient.Historical serum creatinine data will be collected in the trial over a period of [ADDRESS_738916] completed their final visit.

UACR was chosen as primary endpoint (10-hour collection) and secondary endpoint
(responder rate and First Morning Void (FMV)) because it was shown in previous phase II trials by [CONTACT_195885], differentiating different doses, broad in its dynamic range and reaching a stable plateau within a reasonable time after start of treatment. It has been accepted by [CONTACT_195886]. In the MRD phase I trial in patients (1366-0004) UACR in 10-hour urine collected over the day (approximately starting with the morning dose) showed a greater difference to placebo compared to FMV urine. It is considered that 10-hour urine is able to capture the drug effect during the dosing schedule, while FMV urine contains the urine produced over night. While a 10-hour urine at daytime may be easier for patient to collect, a 24-h collection would be more burdensome and prone to error during night time collection. Also 10-hour UACR may be superior to FMV urine as the latter is depending on many factors such as nocturia and time of the first urination in the morning.
Furthermore, the change in UACR upon treatment within approximately 16 weeks of full 
dose correlates with long-term patient relevant outcomes. Based on this and including a 4-week up-titration, until the target dose is achieved, the full duration of treatment has been selected to be 20 weeks. Since UACR is a parameter that varies intra-individually over time, multiple measurements are required at baseline and during the treatment period especially towards the end of treatment where a stable response to the drug should be achieved.Sequential collection of urine during a 4-week follow-up period may deliver exploratory results of response stability and potential rebound effects.
To further characterise haemodynamic effects and potential early benefit on renal function 
serum creatinine will be measured at regular intervals for exploratory analysis.
In this parallel design, double-blind conditions regarding the patient’s treatment (active or 
placebo) are maintained within each dose group. It is not feasible to apply double-blind conditions between dose groups because the individual tablet strengths and matching placebo look different. Therefore investigators will know which dose group their patient is in but will be blinded to whether they are on active drug or placebo. Patients will be blinded to both the dose group they are on and whether they are taking active drug or placebo. Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_562329] a day on top of the extensive background medication they already receive, which is considered too burdensome for this clinical trial. However, in order to minimise possible observer bias with regard to dose dependent effects, the dose group will be blinded to the patient as much as possible by [CONTACT_195887]:
The trial medication label will not include dose strengths so the dose will not be identifiable 
to the patient from the label.

Pseudo-titration is a term used to describe when patients are told that they are potentially 
assigned to a higher dose, but actually remain on the same dose:
oPatients in Dose Group 1 (1 mg TID) will be “pseudo-titrated” to 1 mg TID after 
two weeks and to 1 mg TID two weeks after that.
oPatients in Dose Group 2 (2 mg TID) will be up-titrated from 1 mg TID to 2 mg 
TID after two weeks and then “pseudo-titrated” to 2 mg TID two weeks after that.
oPatients in Dose Group 3 (3 mg TID) will be up-titrated from [ADDRESS_738920] dose already.
3.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL POPULATION
It is expected that 240 patients will be randomised from approximately 100 sites. Screening 
of patients for this trial is competitive, i.e. screening for the trial will stop at all sites at the same time once a sufficient number of patients has been screened. Investigators will be notified about screening completion and will then not be allowed to screen additional patients for this trial unless screening needs to be re-opened due to a higher rate of screen failures.
A log of all patients screened into the trial (i.e. who have signed informed consent) will be 
maintained in the Investigator Site File (ISF) irrespective of whether they have been treated with investigational drug or not.
If a patient is randomised in error (does not meet all inclusion criteria or meets one or more 
exclusion criteria), the sponsor should be contact[CONTACT_15608].

Patients may discontinue trial treatment or withdraw consent to trial participation as a whole
(“withdrawal of consent”) with very different implications; please see sections [IP_ADDRESS] and 
[IP_ADDRESS] below.
Every effort should be made to keep the patients in the trial: if possible on treatment, or at 
least to collect important trial data (UACR and eGFR sampling) according to the flow chart .
Measures to control the withdrawal rate include careful patient selection, appropriate 
explanation of the trial requirements and procedures prior to trial enrolment, as well as theexplanation of the consequences of withdrawal. The decision to discontinue trial treatment or withdraw consent to trial participation and the reason must be documented in the patient files and CRF. If applicable, consider the requirements for Adverse Event collection reporting (please see sections [IP_ADDRESS].1 and 
[IP_ADDRESS] ).
[IP_ADDRESS] Discontinuation of trial treatment
An individual patient will discontinue trial treatment if:
∀The patient wants to discontinue trial treatment, without the need to justify the decision.
∀The patient has repeatedly shown to be non-compliant with important trial procedures 
and, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_15566], the investigator and sponsor representative, is not willing or able to adhere to the trial requirements in the future. 
∀The patient needs to take concomitant medication that interferes with the safety of the 
investigational medicinal product, refer to sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 . If there is no safety 
concern then the Sponsor will review on a case-by-case basis as to whether it is 
appropriate for the patients to continue.  This decision will be based on factors such as duration of treatment, dose etc. If the patient needs to modify a dose, where a stable dose is permitted only, this will not automatically require a discontinuation. In this case the sponsor should be consulted.
∀The patient develops Acute Kidney Injury as per clinical judgment by [CONTACT_737].
The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definition[ R17-2439 ] should 
be used for guidance:
oIncrease in serum creatinine by ≥ 0.3 mg/dL ( ≥ 26.5 μmol/L) within 48 hours; 
or
oIncrease in serum creatinine to ≥ 1.[ADDRESS_738929] 
occurred within the prior 7 days; or
oUrine volume < 0.5 mL/kg/h for 6 hours.
∀The patient progresses to end stage renal disease and needs to obtain renal replacement 
therapy.
∀Patients with a QT or QTcF interval > 500 ms, or an increase of QT or QTcF of > 60 ms 
from the pre-dose value at Visit 3 (baseline). Such cases must be reported as AEs.
∀The patient experiences a severe infection, e.g. with SARS-CoV-2 that precludes their 
safe participation in the trial, as determined by [CONTACT_093].

After the assessment of all in- and exclusion criteria at Visit 3, each eligible patient will be 
randomised according to a randomisation plan.

Randomisation codes will be generated through a validated software and kept blinded to the 
trial team, sites and patients. An Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system will be used to screen patients, perform drug assignment, manage initial/ re-supply ordering of drug supplies and handle emergency un-blinding.
The investigator will receive all necessary instructions from the sponsor to access the IRT. 
Detailed IRT functions and procedures will be documented in the User Requirement Specifications mutually agreed by [CONTACT_562338]. Note that the medication number is different from the patient number (the latter is generated during screening via the IRT System).
4.1.4 Drug assignment and administration of doses for each patient
All patients, regardless of dose group assigned, will start on a dose of 1 mg TID of BI 685509 
or matching placebo. Up-titration or pseudo up-titration will occur after 14 days and after 28 days in each dose group, until the maximum planned dose for that dose group is reached. Patients who do not tolerate an up-titration, e.g., due to orthostatic dysregulation, should follow the guidance in section [IP_ADDRESS] .
The treatment assignments and dose regimen are detailed in Table 4.1.4: 1 .

If no true up-titration is required for a patient at regular timepoints (i.e. Visit 4 and again at Visit 5), then the patient will still get new medication on the same dose as before. All patients will be told that the medication could either be the same or a higher dose depending on the treatment and dose group to which the patient is allocated.
During a COVID-19 or similar pandemic, physical visits to the sites may need to be restricted 
to ensure patient safety. Based on a thorough assessment of the benefits and risks, the investigator may still decide to continue the trial treatment and trial medication may be shipped to the patient’s home if acceptable according to local law and regulations (for more details see section 6.2.1 ). Shipment of trial medication to the patient’s home will also be 
allowed to support regular visits performed at the patient’s home.
Potential down-titrations (dose reductions) can be done based on the dose group known by 
[CONTACT_2727]. This will be managed via the IRT system. Dose reductions must not be performed by [CONTACT_195894]. While the patient will not get to know the precise rules as listed in sections [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS] , the 
patient will be informed that down-titrations may be needed as decided by [CONTACT_093].
[IP_ADDRESS] Rules for titration in case of interruption of trial treatmentSince an interruption of trial medication may have an influence on the tolerance, the 
following rules will apply for the safety of the patient:
Boehringer Ingelheim 14 Mar 2022
BI Trial No.: 1366-0005c32274622-05 Clinical Trial Protocol Page 47 of 107
Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_738940]-03 (18 0) / Saved on: 10 Jul 2019An interruption of trial treatment is defined as any occurrence where 4 consecutive doses* or more were not administered (i.e. missed or dosing temporarily discontinued). *One dose 
refers to an individual timepoint e.g. morning dose, or middle dose or evening dose.
oIf less than 4 consecutive doses of trial medication are missed then the next dose 
of trial medication should be taken as scheduled.
After an interruption of trial treatment the patient should be restarted at 1 mg BI 685509/ placebo TID independent from the dose the patient was on before unless the patient was down-titrated due to an adverse event (see section [IP_ADDRESS] ) in which case:
oIf they had been on 2 mg/3 mg BI 685509/ placebo they would re-start on 1 mg 
BI 685509/ placebo.
oIf they had been on 1 mg BI 685509/ placebo then they should restart on placebo 
(matching 1 mg BI 685509).
Before any up-titration occurs the patient must have taken the preceding dose for at least 7 consecutive days. This applies throughout the treatment period.
oThis may mean that a patient due to be up-titrated at Visit 4 or 5 (as per Table
4.1.4: 1 ) is held at their current dose until their next scheduled visit. They could 
also be up-titrated at an unscheduled visit once this requirement is met.
If interruption for any reason occurs after Visit 5, subsequent up-titration will be allowed either at a scheduled or unscheduled visits.Patients with an interruption on 2 mg or 3 mg or matching placebo will need to return to the clinic either for the next scheduled or an unscheduled visit to receive 1 mg tablets before continuation of trial treatment.
[IP_ADDRESS] Rules for down-titration in case of intolerance to trial treatmentIf a patient has an adverse event that the Investigator believes may be related to trial 
medication then the Investigator may either interrupt a patient’s trial medication (re-start to follow the rules above (see section [IP_ADDRESS] ) or dose reduce the patient as described below. See 
Appendix 10.3 for a schematic guidance on down-titration:
If the patient is on 1 mg TID or matching placebo the patient will be down-titrated to placebo 
matching 1 mg.If the patient is on 2 mg TID or 3 mg TID (or corresponding matching placebo) and interrupts trial treatment

[IP_ADDRESS] Blinding
Patients, investigators and everyone involved in trial conduct or analysis or with any other 
interest except the Trial Pharmacometrician, PK programmer and Trial Bioanalyst in this double-blind trial will remain blinded with regard to the randomised treatment assignmentswithin each dose group until after database lock. The access to the randomisation code will be kept restricted until its release for analysis.
The randomisation codes will be provided to bioanalytics prior to last patient completed to 
allow for the exclusion from the analyses of PK samples taken from placebo patients. Bioanalytics will not disclose the randomisation code or the results of their measurements until the trial is officially unblinded.
In order to expedite the population PK and PK-PD analyses and ensure timely delivery of 
PK/PD results after DBL, specific data must be unblinded and the treatment information must be made available to selected individuals. The unblinding procedure and logistics specific to this purpose will be provided in a separate document. It should be noted no PK/PD results will be communicated to the project and trial team prior to database lock.
[IP_ADDRESS] Unblinding and breaking the codeEmergency unblinding will be available to the investigator via IRT. It must only be used in
an emergency situation when the identity of the trial drug must be known to the investigatorin order to provide appropriate medical treatment or otherwise assure safety of trialparticipants. The reason for unblinding must be documented in the source documents and/or appropriate CRF page.
Due to the requirements to report Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
(S[LOCATION_003]Rs), it may be necessary for a representative from BI’s Pharmacovigilance group to access the randomisation code for individual patients during trial conduct. The access to the code will only be given to authorised Pharmacovigilance representatives for processing in the Pharmacovigilance (PV) database system and not be shared further.
4.1.6 Packaging, labelling, and re-supply
The investigational medicinal products will be provided by [CONTACT_23292] a designated CRO. They 
will be packaged and labelled in accordance with the principles of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP).
Re-supply to the sites will be managed via an IRT system, which will also monitor expi[INVESTIGATOR_195859].
For details of packaging and the description of the label, refer to the ISF.

Investigational drugs are not allowed to be used outside the context of this protocol. They 
must not be forwarded to other investigators or clinics. Patients should be instructed to return unused investigational drug.
The investigator or designee must maintain records of the product’s delivery to the trial site, 
the inventory at the site, the use by [CONTACT_6904], and the return to the sponsor or warehouse / drug distribution centre or alternative disposal of unused products. If applicable, the sponsor or warehouse / drug distribution centre will maintain records of the disposal. 
These records will include dates, quantities, batch / serial numbers, expi[INVESTIGATOR_4061] (‘use- by’) dates, 
and the unique code numbers assigned to the investigational medicinal product and trialpatients. The investigator or designee will maintain records that document adequately that the patients were provided the doses specified by [CONTACT_15616] (CTP) and reconcile all investigational medicinal products received from the sponsor. At the time of return to the sponsor’s appointed CRO, the investigator or designee must verify that all unused or partially used drug supplies have been returned by [CONTACT_23295]’s possession.

No contraceptiveis required for the WOCBP participant’s partner.Highly effective methods of birth control per ICH M3 (R2) that results in a low failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly include (examples depending on approval status in each country):Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal birth control that prevents ovulation (oral, intravaginal, transdermal).Progestogen-only hormonal birth control that prevents ovulation (oral, injectable, implantable).Intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS).Bilateral tubal occlusion.
A male trial participant must be vasectomised with documented absence of sperm or use a 
condom until at least [ADDRESS_738954] trial drug intake , if their sexual partner is a WOCBP. No contraceptive is required for the male participant’s partner.
Alternatively, WOCBP participants and male participants able to father a child must abstain 
from male-female sex. This is defined as being in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods; declaration of abstinence for the duration of exposure to study drug; and withdrawal are not acceptable.

5.1 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY
5.1.1 UACR
Urinary albumin and creatinine measurements are the basis for the calculation of urine
albumin creatinine ratio (UACR). FMV and 10-hour urine samples will be collected by [CONTACT_558884]. 
The first morning void is the first urination after the patient wakes up at their usual time to 
start their day. Thus, if the patient goes back to sleep after urinating early in the morning this void does not need to be collected or documented. This applies also to any urinations earlier during the night in patients who have nocturia. There may be cases when a patient might go back to bed after their usual rising time. In those cases, the void at their usual rising time constitutes the first morning void.
Starting with the baseline run-in period, UACR will be determined on two consecutive days 
to average biological variability at the timepoints indicated in the flow chart . On each 
collection day a sample must be obtained from the patient’s FMV and from the total of urine 
collected over [ADDRESS_738957] and store their urine samples. Further collection and sample storage instructions are given in the laboratory manual in the ISF and instructions to the patient.
Urinary albumin and creatinine will be analysed at a central laboratory using routine 
validated methods. Urinary creatinine may also be used for normalisation of exploratory urinary biomarkers (see section 5.4.1 ).

Lab tests may need to be repeated in case of required medical follow-up due to an adverse 
event or if a test was not successful due to incorrect specimen handling or storage. Should a patient not fulfil all lab requirements to take part in the trial due to a transitional medical condition, the patient may continue in the run-in phase but not be randomised until the re-test of the lab result has shown eligibility of the patient.

[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions of AEs 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_738969] a causal relationship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
The following should also be recorded as an AE in the CRF and BI SAE form (if applicable):
∀Worsening of the underlying disease or of other pre-existing conditions.
∀Changes in vital signs, ECG, physical examination and laboratory test results, if they 
are judged clinically relevant by [CONTACT_093].
If such abnormalities already exist prior to trial inclusion, they will be considered as baseline 
conditions and should be collected in the eCRF only.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Serious adverse eventA serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any AE, which fulfils at least one of the 
following criteria:
- results in death,- is life-threatening, which refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if more severe,
- requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15574]- results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity,- is a congenital anomaly / birth defect,

on appropriate medical judgement which may jeopardise the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definitions. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23236].
For Japan only: An event that possibly leads to disability will be handled as ‘deemed serious 
for any other reason’ and, therefore, reported as an SAE.
[IP_ADDRESS].3 AEs considered “Always Serious”In accordance with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) initiative on Important Medical 
Events, Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of AEs, which by [CONTACT_15623], can always be considered to be “serious” even though they may not have met the criteria of an SAE as defined above.The latest list of “Always Serious AEs” can be found in the eDC system. A copy of the latest list of “Always Serious AEs” will be provided upon request. These events should always be reported as SAEs as described in section [IP_ADDRESS] .
Cancers of new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer must be classified as a serious 
event regardless of the time since discontinuation of the drug and must be reported as described in section [IP_ADDRESS] , subsections “AE Collection” and “AE reporting to sponsor and 
timelines”.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_738971] (AESI) relates to any specific AE that has been 
identified at the project level as being of particular concern for prospective safety monitoring and safety assessment within this trial, e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compounds in the same class. AESIs need to be reported to the sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department within the same timeframe that applies to SAEs, please see section [IP_ADDRESS].2 .
The following are considered as AESIs:
∀Severe orthostatic dysregulation as judged by [CONTACT_093]
∀Severe hypotension as judged by [CONTACT_093]
∀Syncope
∀Potential Severe DILI:
A potential severe DILI that requires follow-up is defined by [CONTACT_195900]: 
∀An elevation of AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) and/or ALT (Alanine 
Aminotransferase) ≥[ADDRESS_738972] combined with an elevation of

drawn within 30 days of each other, or
∀ALT and/or AST elevations ≥[ADDRESS_738975].
These lab findings constitute a hepatic injury alert and the patients showing these lab 
abnormalities need to be followed up according to the “DILI checklist” provided in 
the eDC system.
In case of clinical symptoms of hepatic injury (icterus, unexplained encephalopathy, 
unexplained coagulopathy, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab results (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the investigator should make sure these parameters are analysed, if necessary in an unscheduled blood test. Should the results meet the criteria of hepatic injury alert, the procedures described in the “DILI checklist” should be followed.
[IP_ADDRESS].5 Intensity (severity) of AEsThe intensity (severity) of the AE should be judged based on the following:Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or symptom(s) that is/are easily tolerated.
Moderate: Sufficient discomfort to cause interference with usual activity.Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability to work or to perform usual activities.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_738976] that there is a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship 
could be:
∀The event is consistent with the known pharmacology of the drug.
∀The event is known to be caused by [CONTACT_23320].
∀A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure.
∀Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re-introduced.
∀No medically sound alternative aetiologies that could explain the event (e.g. pre-
existing or concomitant diseases, or co-medications).
∀The event is typi[INVESTIGATOR_23239]-related and infrequent in the general population not 
exposed to drugs (e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome).
∀An indication of dose-response (i.e. greater effect size if the dose is increased, smaller 
effect size if dose is reduced).
Arguments that may suggest that there is no reasonable possibility of a causal relationship 
could be:
∀No plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure is evident 
(e.g. pre-treatment cases, diagnosis of cancer or chronic disease within days / weeks

account the pharmacological properties of the compound (e.g. after 5 half-lives).
Of note, this criterion may not be applicable to events whose time course is prolonged

∀Additional arguments amongst those stated before, like alternative explanation (e.g. 
situations where other drugs or underlying diseases appear to provide a more likely 
explanation for the observed event than the drug concerned).
∀Disappearance of the event even though the trial drug treatment continues or remains 
unchanged.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse event collection and reporting5.[IP_ADDRESS] AE CollectionThe investigator shall maintain and keep detailed records of all AEs in the patient files.The following must be collected and documented on the appropriate CRF(s) by [CONTACT_1275]:From signing the informed consent onwards until the follow-up visit 1 all AEs (non-serious and serious) and all AESIs.After follow-up-visit 1 until the individual patient’s end of trial:cancers of new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer, all trial treatment related SAEs and all trial treatment related AESIs.After the individual patient’s end of the trial: the investigator does not need to actively monitor the patient for new AEs but should reportany occurrence of cancer and trial treatment related SAEs and trial treatment related AESIs of which the investigator may become aware of by [CONTACT_23321], e.g. phone call. Those AEs should be reported on the BI SAE form (see section [IP_ADDRESS].2 ), but not on the 
CRF.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_738978] report SAEs, AESIs, and non-serious AEs which are relevant for the 
reported SAE or AESI, on the BI SAE form immediately (within 24 hours) to the sponsor’s unique entry point (country specific reporting process will be provided in the ISF). The same timeline applies if follow-up information becomes available. In specific occasions, the investigator could inform the sponsor upfront via telephone. This does not replace the requirement to complete and send the BI SAE form.
With receipt of any further information to these events, a follow-up SAE form has to be 
provided. For follow-up information the same rules and timeline apply as for initial information. All (S)AEs, including those persisting after individual patient’s end of trial must be followed up until they have resolved, have been assessed as “chronic” or “stable” , or no further information can be obtained.

In rare cases, pregnancy might occur in a clinical trial. Once a patient has been enrolled in the 
clinical trial and has taken trial medication, the investigator must report any drug exposure during pregnancy in a trial participant immediately (within 24 hours) by [CONTACT_15627] A of the Pregnancy Monitoring Form to the sponsor’s unique entry point.
Similarly, potential drug exposure during pregnancy must be reported if a partner of a male 
trial participant becomes pregnant. This requires written consent of the pregnant partner.Reporting and consenting must be in line with local regulations. The ISF will contain the trial specific information and consent for the pregnant partner.
The outcome of the pregnancy associated with the drug exposure during pregnancy must be 
followed up and reported to the sponsor’s unique entry point on the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Studies (Part B).The ISF will contain the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Studies (Part A and B).
As pregnancy itself is not to be reported as an AE, in the absence of an accompanying SAE 
and/or AESI, only the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Studies and not the SAE form is to be completed. If there is an SAE and/or AESI associated with the pregnancy an SAE form must be completed in addition.
5.3 DRUG CONCENTRATION MEASUREMENTS AND 
PHARMACOKINETICS
5.3.1 Assessment of pharmacokinetics
PK sampling times and periods are indicated in the Flow Chart for Procedures . Date and 
clock time of drug administration(s) and PK sampling will be recorded in the eCRF. Patients 
do not need to come fasted to visits, but the fasting status needs to be recorded for PK sampling.
Noncompartmental PK parameters will be calculated based on actual sampling times using a
validated PK software (Phoenix
®WinNonlin®8.1). Further PK parameters will be calculated 
as feasible and may include, but are not limited to:C
max (maximum measured concentration of the analyte in plasma)
tmax(time from dosing to maximum measured concentration of the analyte in plasma)

Additional PK parameters may be calculated as appropriate.
Individual plasma concentration data and the PK parameters calculated thereof will be tabulated and graphically displayed. A subject’s PK data will be flagged and excluded from the PK analyses in case of protocol deviations relevant to the evaluation of PK or in case of PK non-evaluability (as revealed during data analysis, based on the criteria specified below). Reasons for exclusion of a subject’s data will be documented in the CTR.
Protocol deviations relevant to the evaluation of PK may be
Incorrect trial medication takenIncorrect dose of trial medication taken
PK non-evaluability applies, if for example
The subject experienced emesis that occurred in the time window of two times median t

(median t maxis to be determined excluding the subject(s) experiencing emesis)
The subject has missing samples/concentration data at important phases of the PK disposition curve
5.3.2 Methods of sample collection
For quantification of analyte plasma concentrations of BI 685509 blood will be taken from an 
antecubital or forearm vein at the times indicated in the flow chart . Blood will be withdrawn 
by [CONTACT_23325] a metal needle. 
Further details of sample processing for plasma generation will be described in the study-
specific lab manual (see ISF) .
After analysis the samples may be used for further methodological investigations (e.g., for 
stability testing or assessment of metabolites) or to address Health Authority questionsregarding the results/methodology. However, only data related to the analyte and/or its metabolite(s) will be generated by [CONTACT_21659]. The study samples will be discarded after completion of the additional investigations, but no later than 5 years after the final study report has been archived.

6.1 VISIT SCHEDULE
All visits should should be scheduled according to the flow chart . Each visit date (with its 
window) is to be counted from Day 1 (randomisation). If any visit has to be rescheduled, 
subsequent visits should follow the original visit schedule. The trial medication packs contain 
sufficient medication to allow for these time windows.
All trial visits should be initiated preferentially in the morning. Patients should be instructed 
to not take their morning dose of the study medication at home at scheduled visit days as they will be dosed whilst at the study site.
Patients do not need to come fasted to study visits, but their fasting status will have to be

SAMPLE SIZE
This is a Phase II, randomised, double-blind (within dose groups), placebo-controlled and 
parallel group trial to investigate the effect of different doses of BI 685509 on UACR reduction over 20 weeks in patients with diabetic kidney disease.
The primary endpoint for patients is Change from baseline in log transformed UACR 
measured in 10-hour urine after 20 weeks of trial treatment. The purpose of this trial is to demonstrate PoC (proof of concept) of clinical activity of BI 685509 on the primary endpoint and to determine the optimal dose for phase III. The methodology for dose finding employing both multiple comparison procedures and modelling techniques (MCPMod) will be applied to the [ADDRESS_738995] protecting the overall probability of Type I error (one-sided α of 5 
%). The pre-specified models and their parameters used for this test are outlined in section 
7.2.1 .
7.2 PLANNED ANALYSES
7.2.1 General considerations
The following analysis sets will be defined for statistical analyses:
Entered Set (ES): This patient set includes all patients who signed informed consent. The ES
will be used for the analysis of patient desposition.
Randomised Set (RS): This patient set includes all entered and randomised patients. The RS
will be used for the analyses of protocol deviations as well as demographics and baseline characteristics.
Treated Set (TS): This patient set includes all patients who received at least one dose of study
medication. The TS is used for safety analyses and exposure.
Full Analysis Set (FAS): The patient set includes all patients who had at least one baseline 
measurement of UACR in week -2, -1, or [ADDRESS_738996]-baseline measurement after week 6. The FAS is the main analysis set for the analysis of efficacy.

The same process will be repeated for the supplemental 1 and 2 approaches in Table 7.2.2: 1 .
Dose finding
The second primary objective is to determine therapeutic dose. The trial will characterize the dose-response curve for BI 685509 in patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) by [CONTACT_58833] 3 doses and placebo. The response is the change from baseline in log transformed UACR measured in 10-hour urine after 20 weeks of trial treatment. Patients will be evaluated in the dose group they were assigned to at randomisation for primary analysis in the MCPMod analysis.
The analyses for dose-finding will be performed using MCPMod whereby [CONTACT_562344] (patterns) will be evaluated to identify the best-fitting model or subset of models (refer to Figure 7.5: 1 ). If PoC is established, the statistically significant (best 
fitting) model(s) from the candidate set are refitted to the data to generate new estimates for 
all model parameters from the data. The final model will be obtained via model averaging across the significant models based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The target dose(s) can be estimated from that model by [CONTACT_195910]. Doses within the dose range investigated (0 to 9 mg, total daily dose) will be considered.
7.2.3 Secondary endpoint analyses
The analysis for the change of UACR in FMV urine will be performed by [CONTACT_562345].
Descriptive statistics will be provided for the change of UACR in FMV urine/10-hour urine
and the UACR response rate along with figures.
7.2.5 Safety analyses
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). Standard BI summary tables and listings will be produced. All adverse events with an onset between start of treatment and end of the REP, a period of [ADDRESS_738998] dose of trial medication, will be assigned to the on-treatment period for evaluation.
All treated patients will be included in the safety analysis. In general, safety analyses will be 
descriptive in nature and will be based on BI standards. No hypothesis testing is planned.

The block size will be documented in the Clinical Trial Report. Access to the codes will be controlled and documented.
In order to ensure a balance of patients who are on SGLT2 inhibitors and who are type 1 or 2 
diabetes mellitus compared with those who are not, the trial will be stratified according to SGLT2 inhibitor use and type of diabetes mellitusat randomisation. Patients will be randomised to 1 mg tid, matching placebo, 2 mg tid, matching placebo, 3 mg tid, and matching placebo in a 3:1:3:1:3:1 ratio. There will be 60 patients on BI 685509 and 20 on placebo in each dose group (240 in total).

suspected acute coronary syndrome, when the patient is on trial treatment, close monitoring of the blood pressure is required.”
Rationale for change Clarification on use of restricted nitrates in an emergency.
Section to be changed 4.[ADDRESS_739037] non-sterilized women <[ADDRESS_739038] been updated as it is 
unnecessary for a women who is not, for whatever reason, of 
child bearing potential to undergo pregnancy testing. 
S-creatinine has been added as an important lab parameter to 
monitor kidney function.
Further clarifications.
Section to be changed 5.3.2 Methods of Sample Collection
Description of change Rephrased the following:
“After completion of the trial the plasma samples may be used for further methodological investigations, e.g., for stability testing, assessment of metabolites. However, only data related to the analyte and/or its metabolite(s) will be generated by [CONTACT_21659]. The study samples will be discarded after completion of the additional investigations, but no later than 5 years after the final study report has been signed.”

The study samples will be discarded after completion of the additional investigations, but no later than 5 years after the final study report has been archived.“
Rationale for change Samples may be used for the described purposes directly 
after their originally intended analysis.
Section to be changed 5.4.1 Exploratory biomarkers
Description of change Added further explanation on capi[INVESTIGATOR_195870], which 
can be assisted by [CONTACT_6624]/nurse or a caregiver.
Rationale for change Further clarification.
Section to be changed 6.2.1 Telemedicine Contacts and Home Visits
Description of change Added further clarification on shipments to and from 
patient’s home and physical examinations by a qualified nurse.
Rationale for change Clarifications.
Section to be changed 7.2.[ADDRESS_739040] was randomised, and the treatment at the onset of AE for the drug-related AE rather than the treatment at end of the up-titration period as was before.
Rationale for change The original wording was reliant on a patient completing the 
up-titration period which may not be the case for all patients. The new wording is aligned with the Sponsor’s Company standards.
Section to be changed 8.3.1 Source documents
Description of change Deleted the following sentence: 
“This includes the values for eGFR and UACR and their method of analysis at or before screening to confirm eligibility.”
Rationale for change Since this is performed by [CONTACT_195915], this sentence has been removed for clarification.

placebo-controlled and parallel group trial to investigate the effects of different doses of oral BI 685509 given over 20 weeks on UACR reduction in patients with diabetic kidney disease
Global Amendment due to urgent safety reasons
Global Amendment X
Section to be changed 3.1
Description of change Removed duplicate Figure 3.1: 1 from previous protocol 
version with 2 weeks screening instead of now 3 weeks.
Rationale for change Correction. The removal of the figure was missed in global 
amendment 2.

Section to be changed Flow chart footnote xi
Description of change The following text has been added:
“…..If applicable this must occur prior to the ECG and PK samples. See FLOW CHART FOR PROCEDURES for details on the timing of ECGs."
Rationale for change For clarity and consistency.
Section to be changed Flow Chart for Procedures (Formerly PK Flow Chart)
Description of change The PK flow chart has been expanded to include all the 
assessments/ procedures to be performed and the order in which they should be done.
The PK Flow Chart has been renamed to “Flow Chart for 
Procedures”. These changes apply throughout the protocol.
Rationale for change It is important that procedures are done within the order 
mentioned in section 6.2. The table has been added to make this easier to follow and to include the timings.
Section to be changed UACR and GFR sampling flow chart
Description of change Reference added to flow chart for visit windows.

was seen. Dosing regimens up to [ADDRESS_739047] dose group in this trial, were used. In both patient groups, there was a dose dependent increase of ∆∆QTcF up 
to 13.7 ms, with the upper 90% CI >20 ms. In one patient group (Child-Pugh B) this was concomitant with a change of the predicted placebo-corrected change from baseline heart rate (∆∆HR) of > 10 beats per minute (bpm), but not in the 
other patient group. No such effect was seen in a healthy Caucasian volunteers trial (1366-0010) for dosing regimens used in this trial. In a healthy Asian volunteers trial (1366-0013), at a dose regimen relevant for this study (i.e. starting 
with 1 mg tid up to a final dose of 3 mg tid), an increase of 
∆∆QTcF was seen up to 11.7 ms with 90% CI <20 ms, 
concomitant with an increase of ∆∆HR of nearly [ADDRESS_739048] on human ether-a-go-go related 
gene (hERG) channel at doses used in this clinical trial, and no effect on QT-interval was seen in conscious animal studies.
Rationale for change To provide new information this also serves as the detailed 
rationale behind the additional measures being included in this amendment.
Section to be changed Section 1.4.2, Table 1.4.2:1 Overview of Trial Related Risks
Description of change Potential QT-interval prolongation was added as a risk along 
with the summary of data, rationale for the risk and the mitigation strategy.
Rationale for change Updated due to the new data available.
Section to be changed Section 3.2 discussion of the trial design
Description of change From: 
“In order for patients and investigators to be blinded to dose group, patients would be subjected to taking multiple tablets three times a day on top of the extensive background medication they already receive, which is considered too burdensome for this clinical trial.”
To:
“Therefore Investigators will know which dose group their patient is in but will be blinded to whether they are on active or placebo medication. Patients will be blinded to both the dose group they are on and whether they are taking active drug or placebo. Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_562333] a day on top of the extensive background medication

Rationale for change To clarify blinding within this trial.
Section to be changed Section 3.3.3 Exclusion Criteria
Description of change Exclusion criteria 11) Removal of lactose monohydrate as an 
example of an excipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].
Rationale for change Lactose monohydrate is not used  in the Phase II formulation.
Section to be changed Section 3.3.3 Exclusion Criteria
Description of change Addition of the following exclusion criteria:
17. QTcF -interval > 450 ms in men or > 470 ms in women 
at any time from screening (Visit 1) until start of treatment.18. A family history of long QT syndrome.19. Concomitant use of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_15128] a known risk of Torsade de Pointes at screening (Visit 1) and throughout screening and baseline run-in or planned initiation of such therapi[INVESTIGATOR_195858] (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
Rationale for change Added to ensure patients with QTc prolongation or with the 
potential for QTc prolongation do not participate.
Section to be changed [IP_ADDRESS] Discontinuation of trial treatment
Description of change “• The patient needs to take concomitant medication that is 
not permitted, see section 4.2.2. However, if the patient needs to modify a dose, where a stable dose is permitted only, this will not automatically require a discontinuation. In this case the sponsor should be consulted.
Was rephrased to:
“•The patient needs to take concomitant medication that interferes with the safety of the investigational medicinal product, refer to sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2.  If there is no safety concern then the Sponsor will review on a case-by-case basis as to whether it’s appropriate for the patients to continue.  This decision will be based on factors such as duration of treatment, dose etc. If the patient needs to modify a dose, where a stable dose is permitted only, this will not automatically require a discontinuation. In this case the sponsor should be consulted.”
Rationale for change The patient may remain on trial treatment in an exceptional 
case once the patient uses restricted medication, if there are no safety concerns. The patient will be analysed according to the TSAP.
Section to be changed [IP_ADDRESS] Discontinuation of Trial Treatment
Description of change The following was added:

Rationale for change An additional patient safety measure.
Section to be changed [IP_ADDRESS] Discontinuation of Trial Treatment
Description of change “The patient develops Acute Kidney Injury according to the 
Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definition[R17-2439]” 
Was changed to:
“The patient develops Acute Kidney Injury as per clinical 
judgment by [CONTACT_737]. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definition[R17-2439] should be used for guidance”
Rationale for change The KDIGO guidelines are for use within a clinical setting. 
Patients with low urine output for reasons other than AKI, for example poor fluid intake, potentially could have been incorrectly discontinued.
Section to be changed 4.1.4
Description of change The following text was added: “The last dose of trial 
medication will be administered in the evening of the day before the EoT visit.“
Rationale for change Clarification. 
Section to be changed [IP_ADDRESS] Restrictions Regarding Concomitant Medication and 
Table [IP_ADDRESS]:1 Concomitant Medication Restrictions 
Description of change The following text was added:
“In addition, intake of concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_15128] a known 
risk of Torsade de Pointes must not be co-administered with BI 685509 (also refer to Table 1.4.2: 1). These restrictions apply from screening (Visit 1), until Visit FUp3. In the event of temporary concomitant use of such a therapy, trial medication must be temporarily stopped and can then be re-started after a period of at least 5 half-lives after the concomitant therapy with the known risk of Torsade de Pointes has been stopped, as long as the interruption rules are followed. Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for rules for re-starting up-titration in case of interruption of trial medication.”
The restricted medication table was updated to include drugs 
with known risk of Torsade de Pointes.
Rationale for change Update to exclude medications that could impact QTc

Description of change “Vital signs will be evaluated at the time points specified in 
the flow chart.”
Was changed to:
“Vital signs will be evaluated at the time points specified in the flow chart, prior to the 12-lead ECG and prior to blood sampling as applicable.”
Rationale for change For consistency with other changes in this amendment to 
ensure vitals are done prior to ECG.

 A. Study Hypothesis and  Objectives  
Dry eye disease (DED) is defined as a “multifactorial disease of the tears and ocular surface that results in 
symptoms of discomfort, visual disturbance, and tear film instability with potential damage to t he ocular 
surface. It is  accompanied by [CONTACT_2401] [1].” 
This condition may also compromise  surgical  outcomes and patient sat isfaction following cataract,  refract ive 
surgery [2], and corneal tr ansplants [3].  DED can also impact  everyday tasks such as reading, using a 
computer, driving , and watching television which can be up to three times more difficult [4].  Worker productivity 
is potentially  adversely affected by [CONTACT_2402] [5]. In addition, depression is m ore 
prevalent in DED  patients [6], further evidence of the disease’s debilitating effects.   Current t reatments options 
are limited and a  recent study found 75% of DED  patients report inadequate relief despi[INVESTIGATOR_2391] .  There is 
a critical barrier to provide efficacious treatment modalities to improve quality of life and to improve ocular 
surface health affected by [CONTACT_2403].  
A new treatment called Intense Pulsed Light  (IPL)  shows promise to reduce signs and symptoms in preliminary  
studies .  IPL is a broad spectrum, non- coherent light treatment applied to the face and lower lids followed 
immediately by [CONTACT_2404].  Unfortunatel y, rigorous  peer-reviewed studies on IPL are largely 
missing.  Additional controlled, clinical studies are  critical to better understand the potential of IPL to minimize 
objective measures of DED and improve patient quality of life.   
i. Study Aim   
The aim of this project  is to rigorously evaluate the efficacy  of IPL and to determine whether quality 
of life improvements  can result from its implementation.  Our hypothesis  is that I PL can p rovide 
reduction and potential  elimination of symptoms for  patients with the evaporative form of DED by 
[CONTACT_2405] a more stable, intact 
tear layer.  We believe that the IPL treatment will deliver  these results above and beyond 
meibomian gland expression alone.  
ii. Research Goals  
a. Substantiate the efficacy of IPL treatment for DED.  Our study will collect objective measures of DED disease at baseline and after each of four IPL treatments.  Our study 
design is a prospective, randomized, single masked trial.  This evidence will assist 
practitioners, patients, and third parties to understand the value of this procedure and who 
will most likely benefit.
 
b. Determine the potential improvement in quality of life measures with IPL.   DED has a 
substantial negative impact on quality of life.  We will measure patient symptoms before and after each IPL treatment to assess the change in subjective quality of life measures using 
two validated questionnaires.
 
c. Demonstrate that IPL treatment improves DED above and beyond meibomian gland 
expression alone.  There is limited evidence to support if the efficacy of IPL treatment is 
merely from IPL or the meibomian gland expression alone.  Our proposed study is intended 
to clarify whether adding IPL before meibomian gland expression improves the outcomes.  
To our knowledge, no previous studies have addressed this question.   
 
 
B. Background Information 
3 
 Dry eye  symptoms are common complaints in an estimated 25% of  all eye doctors visits [7].  In the U S 
population over  50 years  of age, there are  approximately 1.68 million men and 3.23 million women with 
diagnosed DED [8, 9].  The U.S. healthcare cost attributed to DED is approximately $3.84 billion[ 5].  The 
symptoms of this disease can range from a mild annoyance to extremely debilitating. Common symptoms 
include burning, stinging, tearing, blurred vision, foreign body sensation, contact [CONTACT_2406], redness, 
chronic pain, and photophobia. Current treatments include topi[INVESTIGATOR_2392], environmental modifications to minimize tear evaporation, punctal occlusive treatments, ocular surface barriers, lid 
treatments, and immunomodulatory agents.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_2393], inadequate relief is common 
and there is a critical barrier  to provide efficacious treatment modalities to improve quality of life and to improve 
ocular surface health  affected by [CONTACT_2403].  We propose to test the hypothesis  that IPL therapy will provide relief of 
evaporative DED symptoms  by [CONTACT_2407] . 
IPL uses  a xenon lamp that delivers pulsed, broad spectrum, non- coherent light with  wavelengths from 500-
1200nm.  During this selective photothermolysis, the light is absorbed by [CONTACT_2408], melanin, and hemoglobin and converted to heat[ 10]. 
IPL was first FDA approved in 1995 for dermatology [11] and is commonly used for treatment of facial rosacea, 
acne,  and hair, wrinkle and lesion removal.  IPL for dry eye and ocular rosacea is currently off - label but is in 
the process of approval and is already approved for us e in Europe and Australia.    
The exact mechanism for the impact of IPL on dry eye is not completely understood.  The theories include: ablation of superficial blood vessels which may deliver inflammatory mediators to the glands, connective tissue remodeling, reduction in eyelid bacterial and parasitic growth, such as demodex , and liquefication of the 
meibomian gland secretions [12].   
i. Preliminary Data
 
We have previously performed IPL at our center on a total of 22  patients ( age range 37 -90, 18 
females/4 males).  Prior to treatment, the mean  baseline total Ocular Surface Disease Index ( OSDI ) 
score was 23.79  and improved to 12.4 after three treatments (Figure 1) .  The baseline mean TBUT 
(tear break -up time)  was 1.05 seconds  and improved to 5 sec onds  after three treatments (Figure 2).  
Both subjective and objective measure s suggest a positive impact on DED with IPL treatment.  
 
ii. Safety D ata  
In our preliminary treatments , no severe adverse events occurred.  One patient noted a small blister 
on the cheek  that resolved after one day and they continued with future treatments.  Toyos [13]

 noted of 91 subjects in a retrospective study, 14% had an adverse event that was most often mild, 
transient peri orbital sw elling and no serious events occurred.  This treatment appears to be safe.  
C. Study Design   
There are two classifications of DED: aqueous deficient and evaporative[ 1].  There is some overlap, but the 
vast majority of dry eye is ev aporative.  Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is the most common cause of 
evaporative dry eye. Intense Pulsed Light (DermaMed Solutions, Lenni, PA ; Lumenis Ltd., Yokneam, Israel ) 
will be applied to the lower eyelids and face with the intent to improve MGD.  We will test our hypothesis and 
complete our goals by [CONTACT_2409] a control to 
compare the effects of IPL in patients who have evaporative DED due to MGD.  
The study is a prospective, randomized, controlled, single masked  trial.  The randomizat ion is based on IPL 
treatment to one eye and sham treatment to the fellow eye.  The randomization will occur via a random number 
generator. The masking is based upon the cornea specialist’s examination.  The primary  outcome measures 
include tear break up time (TBUT ) and the Ocular Surface Disease Index ( OSDI ) symptom survey.  Exploratory 
outcome measures will include the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI -VFQ) , changes in 
MGD  quantitated by [CONTACT_2410] m eibography before and after IPL , and other standard dry eye 
clinical evaluation tools.    
All enrolled participants  will be assigned a number, and the link between the number and participant  will be 
secured. All data collection will comply with HIPPA guidelines. Data collection wi ll include: clinical exam data, 
eyelid and facial photography, and meibography  which will be de- identified.

ii. Study Procedures  
Potential participants  will provide written informed consent prior to any baseline testing  (visit 1) . All 
participants  will be asked to  complete [ADDRESS_2206] at subsequent visits if they deem necessary.   
The p atient s will be evaluated at baseline (visit 1) and return once a month for a total of 5 months  
(visits 2, 3, 4 and 5) . They will be asked to complete study testing and will be evaluated by a 
masked corneal specialist  at each visit . The phenotypic characterization for dry eye will include the 
following tests  for both eyes : tear break -up time (TBUT)  in triplicate using a timer, lissamine green 
staining of conjunctiva (grading 1- 4, noted te mporally and nasally ), corneal staining with fluorescein 
(grading 1 -4, breaking the cornea into 4 sections), meibomian gland health with the Meibomian 
Gland Evaluator (TearScience, Morrisville, NC), tear osmolarity , and 5- minute Shirmers under 
anesthetic using a timer. All patients will also undergo standardized slit lamp eyelid margin 
photography that includes upper and lower lids , have facial photography and meibography of the 
lids. Other testing that will be completed at certain time points include pi[INVESTIGATOR_2396]. We will also obtain information about the 
participant ’s medical history (review of systems), and current ocular and systemic medications.  
All participants  will take the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) [15] and 25-item Nat ional Eye 
Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire (NEI -VFQ) [16]. Both questionnaires will be administered 
at each visit . These surveys do not allow for separating the response between each eye.  
The participants will also be contact[CONTACT_2415] a member of the study team 
approximately [ADDRESS_2207]’s eyes will be randomized with one eye/side of the face  receiving IPL 
treatment (Figure 3 ), and the fellow eye serving  as a control. At the first IPL treatment, the 
energy level (range of 8- 18 joules) will be individually determined based the patient’s skin 
Fitzpatrick scale phototype. The IPL instrument, Quadra Q4®, includes four pulse levels (1 -
4) each with six sublevels (A -F).  The pulse intens ity is inversely related to the skin 
phototype scale, and as noted in subject inclusion and exclusion criteria above, we will only 
treat patients who are phototype [ADDRESS_2208] device requires the user to input fluence (joules/cm2) level prior to treatment. The below graph shows the fluence levels of the Dermamed Quadra Q4®  that

b. Sham Treatment  
With the eye shields still in place, the fellow  eye will be treat ed with a pproximately [ADDRESS_2209] will be asked to use 
ketorolac twice a day for three days and to wear SPF 30 sunscreen for one week . During 
the course of the treatment period, any adverse events will be noted per the adverse 
reporting guidelines outlined in section D.  
d. 1 Week  Safety  Follow Up Phone Call  (+/- 2 days ) 
Approximately one week a fter the participants  have completed the baseline visit and 
received the IPL and sham treatments, a member of the study team  will contact [CONTACT_2416] s to answer any questions and to document any adverse events.  
e. Follow Up Visits  (+/- 10 days)  
Participants will return to the clinic for 4 additional visits after  the baseline visit (visit  1).  
At visits 2, 3, and 4, participants will  be evaluated by a corneal specialist who is masked to 
the IPL treatment randomization,  complete the testing outlined in the schedule of events 
(appendix A ), and receive IPL and sham treatments  accordingly . Participants will receive a 
total of [ADDRESS_2210] or sham treatments.  
f. 7 Month Follow Up Phone Call  (+/- 5 days)  
After the participant’s final visit  (visit 5 ) a member of the study team will contact [CONTACT_2417] [ADDRESS_2211] 
treatment on both  eyes free of charge. Patient ’s that do not wish to come in for the optional 
visit and IPL treatment s, end their participation after completing the questionnaires , if they 
did not choose to end it sooner.  
D. Reporting Procedures  
i. Adverse Events  
a. Adverse events (AEs) and complications determined by [CONTACT_2418] “possibly ”, 
“probably”  or “definitely” related to the IPL treatment or study procedures will be recorded 
and reported to the IRB  according to their reporting guidelines .  
b. Any AE that is determined by [CONTACT_2419] 7 days to the IRB  if is 
determined to be a serious problem. If the unanticipated problem is determined to be non-
serious, it will be reported to the IRB within 14 days.  
ii. Serious Adverse Events  
a. Any AE which meets the FDA definition of serious and determined by [CONTACT_2418] 
“possibly ”, “probably”  or “definitely” related to the IPL treatment or study procedures will be 
recorded and reported to the IRB  within [ADDRESS_2212] of the part icipant.  
E. Statistical Methods  
i. Sample Size and P ower  
The primary study outcome (pre to post change in TBUT within the treated eye and also the 
untreated, control eye) dictated the use of a paired statistical approach to sample size estimation.  
Based on our preliminary data , other published dry eye studies [17], and recent meeting abstract 
(ASCRS 2014; Gupta PK et al.)  the expected, clinically relev ant pre to post TBUT increase of  [ADDRESS_2213] for a non- pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397], 0.05 & 0.20.  The estimated the sample size needed detect 
this difference in TBUT is  27 subjects.  We will recruit 30 subjects allowing for a n anticipated  10% 
drop- out rate.  
All three study goals have a paired desi gn wherein the first two goals  contrast pre-  to post -treatment 
measures in the treated eye, and the 3rd compares the treated eye to the control eye.  The primary 
analysis for each objective will apply the paired, Student’s t -test to contrast th e continuous outcome 
variabl es for efficacy assessment (TBUT , Shirmer’s test, corneal staining) in the treated eye (Goal 
1) and the patient’s quality of life ( Goal 2), and the treated vs. control eye measures ( Goal  3) from 
pre-treatment to post -4th treatment times. If the parametric assumptions of this test are not met, the 
non-parametric equivalent test, the Wilcoxon signed rank test, will be applied. In all cases, the null 
hypothesis to be tested is one of no change from pre-  to post treatment, wit h a Type I error 
probability of 0.05 for the primary outcome assessment.  The pattern of change over the 4 
treatment visits in these continuous variables will be assessed using mixed, linear regression. SAS 
version 9.4 statistical software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) will be used.  
F. Summary and Long- Term Plan  
Dry eye disease is a prevalent ocular condition with inadequate treatments available for proper relief.  IPL has 
the potential to help those with evaporative dry eye due to meibomian gland dysfunction. Thi s is a new 
treatment that needs to be studied with more rigor  to understand the magnitude of the benefit  for the relief of 
sympto ms and reduced clinical signs.  This study will provide answers to these questions in a prospective, 
masked design with the hope of providing an improved quality of life to those with DED.  
We plan to use the anticipated results from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2398]  a larger, prospective study 
on a specific population at high risk for severe DED, those with graft versus host disease.  These patients often have extreme dry eye due to damage to the lacrimal and meibomian glands.  Kellogg Eye Center has a large 
volume of these patients from the University of Michigan Cancer Center.  Often the current dry eye treatments 
are not  sufficient to effectively treat their DED.  There are currently no studies on the efficacy of IPL on this 
population.  This project would require additional funding through another grant.   With addition funding, we also

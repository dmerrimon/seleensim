Protocol: [ADDRESS_435848] western countries and the leading 
cause of cancer death worldwide. For locally advanced (stage II -IIIB) non -small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC), the current treatment of choice is concurrent chemother apy and conformal photon 
radiotherapy (XRT) (1).  However, the effectiveness of concurrent chemoradiation remains modest 
because of treatment -related  pneumonitis ( TRP), an acute, dose -limiting toxic effect of chemoradiation 
for NSCLC that limits the delive ry of tumoricidal doses and thus can result in high rates of local and 
distant failure.  
 
TRP is mediated by [CONTACT_350686] (2). Most such cytokines, including tumor necrosis fac -tor alpha (TNF -), the interleukin (IL) -1 
family, and IL -6, are pro -duced within the treatment field and can evoke  autocrine, paracrine, or 
endocrine responses (3).   
 
The diagnosis of TRP, which typi[INVESTIGATOR_350663] 3 -9 months after Radiotherapy  (RT), is 
established by a history of RT, radiographic evidence (areas of ground -glass opacity and/or 
consolidation in the irradiated lungs that conform to the shape and size of the treatment portals (4)) and 
clinical presentation (most often dry cough, low -grade fever, chest pain, and shortness of breath) as 
well as ipsilateral pleural effusion and consolidation of the lung. Untreated TRP eventually advances to 
lung fibrosis, leading to loss of lung volume and poor pulmonary function, which negatively affect quality 
of life (5). Treatment for TRP is largely empi[INVESTIGATOR_350664], consisting of oral or intravenous 
steroids, oxygen, and sometimes assisted ventilation. Currently, the most effective way to reduce TRP  
is by [CONTACT_350687].  
 
TRP is directly linked with radiation dose and the volume of the irradiated tissue. In clinical practice, the 
total radiation dose that can be t olerated depends on the volume of tissue irradiated. Indeed, preclinical 
and clinical studies have shown that morbidity from TRP depends on the volume (6 -7) and region of the 
normal lung irradiated (8 -10). Dosimetric factors such as mean lung dose (MLD) (1 1) and percentage of 
lung volume receiving more than a threshold dose (Vdose) (11 -13) are also well -known predictive 
factors for TRP. We recently demonstrated in a retrospective analysis that the actuarial incidence of 
grade >3 TRP in patients with locally  advanced NSCLC receiving 3 -dimensional conformal radiotherapy 
(3D-CRT) and concurrent chemotherapy was 22% at 6 months and 32% at 1 year. In univariate 
analyses, the MLD, relative V5 (rV5), and V25 -V55 were significantly associated with grade > 3 TRP. In 
multivariate analyses, rV5 was highly predictive of grade > 3 TRP, with 1 -year actuarial rates of 3% f or 
those with rV5 < 42% and 38% for those with rV5 > 42% ( P = 0.001) (10).    
 
1.1.1  Intensity -modulated radiation therapy  
Techniques that reduce radiation dose and volume to the 
normal lung can reduce the incidence of TRP.  One such 
technique, intensity -modulated RT (IMRT), can increase 
conformality and provide greater sparing of normal 
tissues that traditional 3D -CRT (14). Mu rshed et al. (15) 
reported that using IMRT led to median absolute 
reductions in V10 of 7% and V20 of 10%. This 
corresponded to a decrease of > 2 Gy in the total MLD 
and 10% in the risk of TRP.  Using  the parameters 
described by [CONTACT_350688] (16-17), we 
estimated that the median risk of TRP would decrease 
from 13% -36% with the 3D -CRT plans to 7% -9% with 
the IMRT plans, a statistically significant reduction.  
 
In our own use of IMRT with concurrent chemotherapy  
for the definitive treatment of advanced NSCLC (15,18),

pneumonitis in patients with NSCLC treated

we found significant reductions in the rates of grade > 3 TRP (8% for IMRT vs  29% for 3D -CRT); at 1 
year, the corresponding rates were 9% vs 33% ( P=0.028) (Fig 1). These reductions were due to 
significant reductions in irradiated volumes of and doses to normal tissue (mean dose to normal lung 
was 16.6 Gy [range, 2.5 –28.5] for IMRT and 22.1 Gy [range, 1.0 –38.9] for 3D -CRT). IMRT also led to 
significant decreases in median irradiated volumes at several dose levels, including V15 –V65 (P < 
0.0001). However, V5, V10, and V70 were no different between the two techniques, suggesting that 
IMRT is of limited benefit in terms of minimizing lung exposure to low -dose radiation (19).  
 
1.1.[ADDRESS_435849] been limited by [CONTACT_350689], especially V5 (15) or rV5 (10). 
Analyses of a su bgroup of patients with an rV5 > 70% suggested that higher rV5 levels are associated 
with increased risk of severe pulmonary toxicity, confirming our 3D -CRT experience that rV5, in addition 
to other higher -dose factors, is a parameter that needs to be cont rolled (10).  
 
Other clinical studies also support the concept that low -dose radiation to large volumes of lung can 
increase the risk of toxicity. Loss of the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide was observed in lungs 
exposed to as little as 13 Gy (20), and the risk of complications in another study rose steeply above an 
MLD of 10 Gy (21). For patients already at risk of pulmonary complications because of large tumor 
volumes requiring extensive coverage or medical conditions that compromise respi[INVESTIGATOR_350665], 
irradiating a large volume of lung poses a concern that cannot be addressed with the use of photon 
irradiation.  
 
1.1.[ADDRESS_435850] that use of proton beams (rather than photon 
beams) ca n reduce the radiation dose to and volume of normal tissue, including low -dose volumes. 
This is of particular interest in the treatment of lung cancer, as proton therapy would reduce the volume 
of lung irradiated to a low dose, whereas IMRT involves a grea ter volume of the lung in low -dose 
regions if more than five beam angles are used.   
 
In our planning study comparing IMRT and proton therapy (22,23), we found that proton therapy spared 
15%–17% of total lung and 19% –23% of contralateral lung from receivin g 5 Gy compared with IMRT, a 
difference that could greatly reduce lung toxicity. Photon therapy at a prescribed dose of 63 Gy led to a 
mean total lung dose of 20.1 Gy, with V5, V10, and V20 values of 58.5%, 45.3%, and 34.5%; the 
corresponding values for pr oton therapy at a prescribed dose of 63 cobalt Gray equivalent (CGE) were 
17.5 Gy, 43.1%, 37%, and 30.8% ( P = 0.002), and those for proton therapy with dose escalation to 74 
CGE were 21.2 Gy, 44%, 39.3%, and 33.2%. Low -dose exposure (i.e., V5) in the contr alateral lung 
from photon therapy was 45.5% at 63 Gy and 49.7% at 74 Gy; with proton therapy, those values were 
reduced to 26.6% at 63 CGE and 27.1% at 74 CGEProton therapy also led to reductions in mean 
whole -body nontarget integral dose: with photon ther apy, the doses were 6.8 Gy at 63 Gy and 8.1 Gy at 
74 Gy, but with photon therapy they were only 4.5 Gy at 63 Gy and 5.4 Gy at 74 Gy, a 33% absolute 
improvement. Even in patients with contralateral hilar disease, proton therapy significantly reduced low -
dose exposures of contralateral lung (V5 25%) relative to IMRT (V5 45%). Doses to heart V40, spi[INVESTIGATOR_36232], and esophagus V55 were also reduced. These findings indicate that even in extreme cases that 
pose challenges for proton planning, proton therapy still ac hieved a better dose -volume histogram than 
did IMRT (22,23).  
 
Preliminary findings from a clinical study of 25 consecutive patients with NSCCL who underwent 
proton -beam radiation and concurrent chemotherapy showed that even with a higher median radiation 
dose (74 CGE vs 63 Gy with XT), proton -beam therapy permitted higher total doses (17%+) to be given 
with concurrent chemotherapy yet were associated with reduced esophageal reactions compared with 
3D-CRT (24).  Moreover, no increase in the incidence of TRP has been noted.  
 
 
 
Protocol: [ADDRESS_435851] photon and 
proton radiation in terms of the development of TRP.    
 
We hypothesize that proton therapy will expose significantly smaller lung volumes to damaging dose 
levels and spare larger volumes of normal tissue than does photon therapy without compromising local 
regional tumor control.  
 
Specifically, we propose that i mage -guided adaptive proton therapy (IGAPT) will lead to lower rates of  
TRP and equivalent tumor control compared with image -guided adaptive photon therapy (IGAXT) for 
patients with stage II -IIIB NSCLC who are receiving concurrent chemotherapy. The primary  objectives 
of this Bayesian adaptive randomization trial are to compare time to the appearance of (1) grade  3 
pneumonitis (according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 
[CTCAE v4.0]) and (2) locoregional recurrence among  patients given 74 Gy in 37 fractions (2 Gy each) 
of protons vs. photons.   
 
This clinical trial will be the first Bayesian randomization trial to compare IGAXT and IGAPT in patients 
with locally advanced, surgically unresectable NSCLC. Patients who are ca ndidates for concurrent 
chemoradiation will be randomly assigned to undergo either standard IGAXT or IGAPT to [ADDRESS_435852] positron emission tomography (PET) images and blood samples and document 
comorbidity and symptoms by [CONTACT_350690].  
Inflammatory cytokines and genomic DNA will be extracted from the serum and lymphcytes to analyze 
tha correlations of these biomarker and TRP after the completion of the study.

and modified as deemed necessary based on PET and other clinical studies.  
 
iGTV  GTV plus margin for tumor motion.  A structure will be created equal to the union of the 
GTV on all respi[INVESTIGATOR_350666].  This may 
be created by [CONTACT_350697] a reference phase to othe r phases or by 
[CONTACT_350698] a maximum intensity projection (MIP) dataset.  The delineated 
iGTV will be compared with the actual position of the GTV on each of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_350667], if necessary, to encompass the extent of mo tion of the 
GTV (hence iGTV).  The iGTV may also be modified as deemed necessary based on 
PET and other clinical studies that may better distinguish the true GTV from other near 
unit density tissues.  
 
CTV  Clinical target volume is the subclinical involvem ent around the GTV. The CTV is the 
GTV plus an 8 -mm margin for microextensions of the tumor (CTV=GTV+8 mm).  
 
ITV  Internal target volume is the envelope of the CTV during the time of irradiation, thus 
accounting for intrafractional motion.  In this study, the ITV will be created by [CONTACT_350699] 8 mm to include subclinical microscopic disease; this volume will be 
reviewed and edited if necessary based on clinical experience, as is our current clinical 
practice standard.  
 
PTV  Planning target volume is ITV plus a margin to ensure that the prescribed dose is 
actually delivered to the ITV. This margin accounts for variations in treatment delivery, 
including variations in setup between treatments. The ITV is expanded by [ADDRESS_435873] ance with our current clinical practice.  The PTV is relevant 
to photon planning.  
 
7.2 Radiation Doses  
7.2.1  The total radiation dose for the tumor target will be  according to the specification in 
section 7.5 and delivered at 2 CGE per fraction, once a day, 5 fractions per week.  100% 
of the ITV will be covered by [CONTACT_342581] .  Greater than or equal to 95% of the 
prescribed dose to the ITV will be acceptable  if 100% cannot be reached . 
 
7.2.2  Normalization of the treatment plan will cover 95% of the PTV with the prescription dose. 
The minimum PTV dose must not fall below 95% of the prescription dose. For passively 
scattered proton therapy (PSPT), the PTV is a ssumed to be beam -specific PTV (see 
section [IP_ADDRESS]).  
 
7.2.3  Deviations from dose prescription for target volumes:  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  No deviation:  ≥ 99% of the PTV receives ≥ 95% of the prescribed dose, and a 
contiguous volume of no more than 2 cc inside PTV excee ds 120% of the 
prescribed dose.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Minor deviation: Deviations of this magnitude are not desirable, but are 
acceptable.  Coverage that is equal to 95% of the prescribed dose and falls 
between 99% and 95% of the PTV, or a contiguous volume of no mor e than 2 cc 
inside the PTV exceeds 1 40% of the prescribed dose  at the discretion of the 
attending physician . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment interruptions :  Interruption of radiation therapy up to 5  consecutive 
fractions for any reason will be considered as minor devia tion.

7.2.4  Tolerance Limits for Critical Structures  (See Table 3b ) 
Note: if any po rtion of a critical structure is part of the planning target volume 
(PTV), the treating physician should make the decision based on medical 
necessity on the maximal radiation dose to that portion of the critical structure to 
ensure adequate tumor dose.   
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Normal lung (right lung + left lung - GTV):  V20 ≤ 37%; and mean lung dose 
(MLD) ≤ 20CGE.  MLD of ≤ 22 CGE or V20 up to 40% will be acceptable as 
minor deviations.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Esophagus:  33% volume must be ≤ 6 5 CGE, 66%  55 CGE and whole volume 
mean dose  ≤ 45 CGE.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Brachial Plexus:  V663.0 cc, V70   2.0 cc, V74   1.0 cc, V75   0.5 cc. For 
superior sulcus tumor or upper lobe tumors where the brachial plexus is part of 
the target volume, the involved segment should  be excluded from the contour  of 
the normal brachial plexus .   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]:  Maximum dose to [ADDRESS_435874] dose volume ≤ 50 CGE.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Heart:  The mea n dose to the whole heart should be ≤33CGE .  V70 ≤ 45% and 
V45≤ 70%. Dose constraints to atria and ventrical of the heart is specified in table 
3b. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Liver:  V50 ≤ 35% and the whole liver must be ≤ 25 CGE.   
 
7.2.5  Major deviation:  Doses outside the limits of the minor deviation for target volumes and 
exceeding normal tissue tolerance limits or greater than the limit of minor deviation 
(where indicated) will be considered major deviations and not acceptable.  
 
Interruption of radiati on therapy more than 5  consecutive fractions for any reason will be 
considered as major deviation.  
 
 
7.2.6  Dose reporting:  The digital dose distribution data to be reported includes the complete 
treatment plan.  Its components include patient images, con tours of all structures, beam 
configurations and characteristics including beam shapi[INVESTIGATOR_350668], treatment couch parameters, dose distributions, dose volume histograms 
for target volumes and critical normal structures.  In a ddition summary data shown in

7.3 Simulation, Immobilization, Image -Guided Radiation  
 
7.3.1  Simulation:  All simulations will be done on CT scanners capable of acquiring 4D CT 
image data sets.    
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  For proton planning, only CTs which have been calibrated for protons should be 
used.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Each patient will be positioned in an immobilization device in the treatment  
 position on a flat table.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]   The imaging session will consist of acquisition of CT image data sets. 
These may include 4D CT, free breathing CT, and/or breath hold CTs.  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] The pretreatment diagnostic PET/CT should be performed together with [ADDRESS_435875] 
simulation if at all possible.  
 
7.3.2  Localization image studies with the patient in the treatment position will be obtained at 
the time of treatment.  
 
7.3.3  Image -guided adaptation  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients will be treated only on units with image guided capabilities.  Such units 
include on es with on -board imaging, CT -on-rails, or other dedicated patient 
positioning image systems, e.g. those associated with the proton delivery 
system.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] In addition to the  CT data sets obtained for planning of treatments, CT scans will 
be obtained at l east in weeks 2, 3, 4 and 7 from the start of the treatments.  
Optionally, additional CTs may be acquired in weeks 1, 5 and 6.  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] The original CT will be fused with the weekly CT.  The original contours will be 
transferred to the new CT and reviewed  by [CONTACT_350702].  If deemed necessary by [CONTACT_198671], new contours will be drawn and 
new dose distribution calculated using the original beam configuration.  If the 
changes in DVHs derived from new dose distribution exceed the level of minor 
deviation of the target or normal tissue dose constraints, a new treatment plan 
will be designed for the remainder of the treatments.  Target and normal tissue 
dose constraints and the limits of minor deviations are given in Table 3 .   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Composite dose distribution received by [CONTACT_350703].  Such computations are necessary mainly to 
correlate dose distributions with response.  They need to be performed only at 
the time of outcomes ana lyses.   They involve, for each patient, computation for 
Protocol: 2008 -0133 
February 19, 2013  
Version 17  
Page 13 
dose distributions for each of ten phases of the respi[INVESTIGATOR_50126]. These will be 
deformed to a reference phase (typi[INVESTIGATOR_350670] -exhale phase) and averaged.  
Such calculations will be performed for each of the CT scans acquired over the 
course of RT.  All these dose distributions will be deformed to the reference 
phase of the initial 4D CT and averaged.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Patients randomized to be in proton therapy arm may receive up to five fractions 
with photons in the event the proton machine is not available.  
  
7.4 Treatment Planning  
7.4.1  Critical structures  
[IP_ADDRESS]  The normal tissues including the right lung, the left lung, the esophagus, the  
heart, liver, brachial plexus, and the spi [INVESTIGATOR_350671] .  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  The lungs are expected to be the primary dose -limiting structure  and basis for 
randomization . Every effort should be made to keep the total lung dose (defined 
as the volume of both lungs minus the GTV in the appropriate respi[INVESTIGATOR_350672], the mid -ventilation phase of [ADDRESS_435876] for ITV based 
treatments or the mid position of gated plann ing CTs for gated treatments) to a 
minimum.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  The tolerance doses to various organs shown in Table 3b above are to be used 
as guidelines. The treating radiation oncologist/dosimetrists should make every 
effort not to exceed these tolerance levels. ( All tolerance doses are assumed to 
be delivered at 2 CGE/fx.)  
 
7.4.2  IGAXT and IGAPT planning  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  All patients on this protocol will have one or more treatment plan(s) 
created for treatment with photons and one or more plan(s) created for 
treatment w ith protons to assess eligibility for randomization.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  This protocol does not mandate any specific field arrangement to be used. In 
photon planning, the PTV is to be treated with any combination of coplanar or 
noncoplanar 3D conformal fields shaped  to deliver the specified dose while 
restricting the dose to the normal tissues. Field arrangements will be determined 
by 3D or inverse IMRT planning to produce the optimal conformal plan in 
accordance with volume definitions.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Tumor Motion Managem ent: If the centroid of the GTV is determined to 
move more than +/ -0.5 cm, additional motion assessment tests will be 
performed either in the same simulation session or additional simulaiton 
sessions when the treatment plan is evaluated to determine if the  limits of 
deviations for target coverage specified in Table 3 are exceeded.   The 
final decision on the use of any particular motion management strategies, 
such as gating, breath -hold, or the ITV approach, will depend on patient’s 
physical condition, leve l of irregular breathing, ability/inability to hold 
breath, and/or the availability of respi[INVESTIGATOR_350673]., at the discretion of treating radiation oncologist . 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition of B -PTV (beam specific PTV) and treatment planning for 
IGAPT:  For proton planning, each beam has an individual and unique 
PTV expansion from the ITV. In the plane perpendicular to the proton 
Protocol: 2008 -0133 
February 19, 2013  
Version 17  
Page 14 
beam axis, the PTV expansion from the ITV is  consistent with the method 
used for photons. However, along the direction parallel with the proton 
beam axis, the PTV expansion from the ITV distal margin and proximal 
margins, which are computed using established algorithms based on 
range uncertainty of the beam.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment planning parameters including distal and proximal margins, 
block margin and smearing radius will be calculated b ased on published 
formulae, modified locally and adopted as standard of practice.  
 
7.4.3  Dose calculation  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Doses are to be calculated with heterogeneity correction, i.e., correction 
is to be made for density differences between air spaces, lung, water -
density or bony tissue.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Treatment planning should be performed in accordance with the 
prescribed doses to each target, together with restrictions in dose to 
normal tissues.

7.5 Randomization  
Radiation therapy component of the study is s hown in the flow chart below:  
 
 
 
 
7.5.1  The proton (PT) and photon (IMRT or 3DCRT) plans will be designed and 
evaluated by [CONTACT_350704], meaning that the dose constraints for normal tissue toxicity 
specified on Table 3b have been met.  
 
Radiation dose will be prescribed at 1 of  2 dose levels: 74 Gy (CG E), 66 Gy (CGE) .  
If either proton or photon plan at 74 Gy (CGE) is not acceptable, prescribed tumor 
dose will be  reduced to 66 Gy (CGE) and another pair of proton and photon plans 
will be designed.  If the plans at one of prescribed dose levels of 66 or 74 Gy 
(CGE) are achievable, the patient will be randomized between photons (Group 1) 
and protons (Group 2) at the highest achieved dose level.  Patients not 
randomizable will be treated in Group 3 as described in section 7.6.  
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Patients randomized to Group 1 or 2 will be treated with the approved IGAXT or IGAPT 
plan.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients randomized to Protons (G roup 2) and subsequently denied insurance 
reimbursement may elect to forego treatment with Protons and be treated with Photons. 
Such patients will be removed from the randomized part of the study and moved to 
Group [ADDRESS_435877]  practical  dose (74 CGE, 66 CGE).  
 
 

Protocol: [ADDRESS_435878] website (  
https://biostatistics.mdanderson.org/boutiquetrials ) which is housed on a secure server at 
MDCC and maintained by [CONTACT_350705]. Access to the website will be 
gained through usernames and passwords provided by [CONTACT_350706], review ing, 
and analyzing patient data.  
 
 Training on the use of the Clinical Trial Conduct website to randomize and enroll patients on 
the study will be provided by [CONTACT_350707]. The i mporance of timely updating the follow -up times and 
occurrence of events, if any, will be emphasized.  
 
 Patients described in section [IP_ADDRESS] will be removed from the randomization website.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_435879] stratification dose level of 6 6 Gy (CGE) will be treated without  randomization (Group 3) .  
They will be treated with the modality (protons or photons) that allows the higher dose at the 
limits of normal tissue to lerances. We hypothesized that the toxicity for protons and photons will 
be similar and the modality allowing higher dose to the target  will lead to improved outcomes. 
The data of such patients will be used to compare local control, overall survival, progression -
free survival, median survival and toxicities of protons vs. photons.  
 
 
7.[ADDRESS_435880] of 
peer review at each participating institution.   
 
7.7.2  All plans will also be reviewed by [CONTACT_350708] t or his/her designee at each 
participating institution for compliance with the protocol  and stardard of practice at each 
institution . 
 
7.7.3  Plan review for the patients from one institution by [CONTACT_350709] , when 
performed,  will utilize the resources of Image -Guided Therapy QA Center (ITC) at

Version 17  
Page 17 
• IDMS -measured creatinine (the serum creatinine valued reported in ClinicStation) should 
be used to in calculations that estimate GFR.  
 
2)   The maximum va lue of GFR calculated by [CONTACT_350711] -based 
dosing should not exceed 125 mL/min .  
• For an AUC of 6, this would mean a maximum dose to be administered would be 900 mg  
• For an AUC of 2 the maximum dose to be administered would be 300 mg  
 
                        3)  Consider adjusting the creatinine to a higher value (i.e. 1 mg/dL) in:  
• elderly patients (those over the age of 70)  
• those with cachexia  
• patients that weigh less than 50 kg  
 
4)  When concerned about safety in a specific patient, measure the GFR (using 24 -hour urine 
collection).  
 
The chemotherapy will be given once a week for seven weeks. Each treatment will last 3 -4 
hours.  
 
8.1.3  Etoposide and cisplatin (EP 50/50) is allowed as an alternative non -taxane based 
chemotherapy regimen.   
 
EP 50/50 dose schedule is as follows:   
Etoposide (50 mg/m2/day IV, days 1 -5) and cisplatin 50 mg/m2 IV days 1 and   8) every

Time to development of CTC v3.0 grade > [ADDRESS_435888], in both 
treatment groups  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  An outcomes review committee has been formed to discuss every patient who 
develops symptons suggesting clinical symptomatic TRP, local failure, or regional 
failure to ensure consistent and unbiased grading of study outcomes. The Charter of 
this committee i s the following:  
 
Outcomes Review Committee  
 
The primary outcome for trial 2008 -0133 is time to local failure or grade 3 treatment 
related pneumonitis (TRP), according to CTCAE v3. Local failure after radiation could 
be confused with lung fibrosis or infe ction. CTCAE v3 is a subjective grading system, 
and grading of TRP could vary between physicians and research nurses.  
 
Committee will be chaired by [CONTACT_36942].  Its membership will include MDACC 
thoracic radiation oncologists, MGH CO -PI, MDACC radiati on physicists, dosimetrists, 
research nurses, data coordinator, and statistician participating in the conduct of this 
trial. The treating physician (or his or her designee) and at least one other radiation 
oncologists, one physicist, one research nurse , statisrician  and the data coordinator 
would comprise the quorum. Meeting will be open to others provided no HIPPA 
regulations are violated.  
 
The committee will meet as needed  to review all patients who are suspected of 
achieving either study outcome (local f ailure, TRP). All relevant medical, dosimetric, 
and treatment related information will be reviewed. The committee will reach a 
consensus as to whether the outcome has been achieved. For local failure the 
committee will reach consensus on the type of local failure (see section 13.1.1 of the 
protocol) and the date of local failure. For TRP the committee will reach consensus on 
the CTCAE v3 grade (see section 9.9 of the protocol) and attribution (i.e., relationship 
to treatment). Outcomes for a patient will no t be recorded in the randomization website 
until the committee has reached consensus on the patient.  
 
The committee will also review patients who were decided to have outcomes before 
the formation of the committee. However, the outcomes and dates of outco mes for 
these past cases will not be changed in the randomization website. The committee’s 
review of each past case will be noted for inclusion in sensitivity analyses and for 
discussion in the final study report. Meeting minutes will be recorded to docume nt the 
discussion and final decision of the committee for all cases brought before it.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  TRP is defined and graded according to CTCAE v3.0. Since the CTCAE grading 
criteria for TRP is quite subjective, the grading of TRP could vary among individual 
treating physicians.  The outcomes review committee will meet to discuss each and 
every patient reported to have developed symptomatic TRP. The final grading of  TRP 
will be decided by [CONTACT_350716].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Procedure in diagnosing and grading radiation pneumonitis  for 2008 -0133 
(CTCAE v. 3)  
1) The following factors must exist to diagnose radiation pneumonitis (RP):  
a. Patient must have had radiation treatment that included certain volume of the 
normal lung  
b. There must be radiographic changes suggesting inflammation consistent with 
radiation dose distribution   
c. Time of scoring: 1 – 12 m onths after starting of chemoradiation  
d. Symptoms attributable to RP  
Protocol: 2008 -0133 
February 19, 2013  
Version 17  
Page 21 
2) The following steps are used in grading radiation pneumonits:  
a. Grade 1:   a + b + c + d only  
b. Grade 2:  (1), a + b + c + d, plus (2), or (3), or plus (2)+(3).   (2) Symptomatic 
with one or more related symptoms (e. g. persistent dry cough, shortness of 
breath, reduced exercise tolerance, short term ER visit, oral steroids, cough 
medicine, etc)  and/or (3) affect activities of daily living (ADL) related to work  
c. Grade 3: (1), a+b+c+d plus ( 2), or (3), or (4), or plus any combination of (2) or 
(3) or (4).   (2) Symptomatic (severe) requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], (3) O2 indicated, 
(4) bed ridden or unable to care for self due to RP  
d. Notes:  The following toxicity should be scored as independent cate gory 
i. Pleural effusion will be diagnosed and scored under pleural effusion  
ii. Hypoxia without a+b+c+d will be scored under the category of hypoxia  
iii. ARDS will be scored under the category of ARDS  
The differential between RP and ARDS is best made as follows:   A CT scan 
of the chest should be obtained.   If the inflammatory changes correspond to 
the radiation therapy dose distribution as seen on the axial slices, one can 
assume it is RP.   On the other hand, if the symptoms are acute and the CT 
reveals generalized i nterstitial infiltrates outside the radiation treatment 
volume, e.g. infiltrates in the lower lobes when only an upper lobe tumor 
was treated, the diagnosis is ARDS or other type of inflammation such as 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_350679].  
iv.  Fibrosis is scored under the category of fibrosis  
v. Pulmonary edema is scored under the category of pulmonary edema  
vi. Pulmonary embolism is scored under the category of pulmonary embolism  
vii. Hemoptysis is scored under the category of Hemoptysis  
viii. Pneumonia is sco red under the category of Pneumonia  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Local failure is defined as any of the following that occurs inside the PTVp and/or 
PTVn, or ≤ 1cm outside the margin of the PTVp and/or PTVn:  
 
a) Tumor recurrence after achieving complete response,  
b) Residual tumor enlargement of 20% or more on CT according to RECIST criteria,  
c) Recurrence of PET FDG Avidity after achieving complete metabolic response,  
d) Increase in FDG avidity in residual tumor,  
e) Pathologically proven recurrence .  
 
Regional failure  is defi ned as disease occurrence on the same side of the thorax that 
is > 1 cm outside the PTVp and/or PTVn boundary.  
 
The PET or CT images that reported local failure will be fused with the radiation dose 
distribution to allow accurate assessment of the location  of the local failure. Biopsy to 
allow difnitive documentation of local failure is highly recommended whenever 
possible, but not required. When in question, the case will be discussed  by [CONTACT_350717].

disease that occurs outside of the thorax and/or disease that occurs in the 
contralateral lung).  
 
 [IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluate the role of functional imaging with FDG -PET in assessing and

13.2 Sample Size Calculation and Data Analysis Plan  
 
13.2.1  Hypothesis  
 The primary endpoint of the study is time to treatment failure, defined as the interval from 
the time of randomization to the development of treatment -related pneumonitis (TRP) or 
local failure , whiche ver occurs first.  We are interested in studying whether IGAPT can 
reduce the TRP rate compared with IGAXT. Although local disease control rates are thought 
to be similar for IGAPT and IGAXT, this assumption needs to be prospectively tested, and 
hence we c hose a combin ed endpoint of TRP and local failure  as the primary endpoint.  
 
 Our primary outcome is time to treatment failure. Treatment failure is defined as TRP or 
local failure . These 2 types of failure are equally important.  Based on the preliminary d ata, it 
is assumed that the time to treatment failure follows a log -normal distribution, with 6 -month 
and 12 -month treatment failure rates for the IGAXT arm of 30% and 40%, respectively (27). 
We also assume that under the null hypothesis (H0), failure in t he IGAPT arm is the same 
as failure in the IGAXT arm, and under the alternative hypothesis (H1), IGAPT can reduce 
the corresponding failure rates to 20% and 25%, respectively.   
 
 Eligible patients will be assigned to receive either IGAXT or IGAPT based on the Bayesian 
adaptive randomization method.  Adaptive randomization will allocate more patients to the 
treatment that yields more favorable outcomes based on the interim observed data. This 
design is appealing ethically because if a difference is found in treatment efficacy, more 
patients in the trial can be treated with the more effective treatment.  If no difference is found 
in treatment efficacy, patients will be assigned with e qual probability to either treatment, as 
is the case in the conventional randomized trials with equal allocation ratio.  With a 
maximum of [ADDRESS_435889] 81% power to detect this difference with a 
one-sided type I error rate of 10% or  less (see subsequent sections and Table 4 [Operating 
Characteristics] for details).   Under H1, there is a 48% chance of early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_350680]: 2008 -0133 
February 19, 2013  
Version 17  
Page 23 
58% of the patients randomized into the IGAPT group in a median sample size of 128. The 
sample size calculation assumes an accrual rate of [ADDRESS_435890] 
dose of IGAXT possible (74 CGE, 66 CGE).  
 
 
13.2.2  Model specification for Bayesian adaptive randomization design using time -to-treatment -
failure as the endpoint.  
The time to treatment failure is assumed to follow a log -normal distribution.  A Bayesian 
lognormal regression model with adaptive randomization will be used. Let ti be the time to 
development of CTCAE v3.0 grade > 3 treatment -related TRP or loc al failure  for individual i; 
then the distribution of  ti  will be  
 
                    log(ti) ~ N(IGAXT, IGAXT2) if ti   is in IGAXT group,  
                    log(ti) ~ N(IGAPT, IGAPT2), if ti   is in IGAPT group.  
 
We assume conjugated prior, i.e., the prior distributions are normal distribution (1, 100) 
distributions for β ’s and gamma (0.00 01, 0.00 01) distributions for the inverses of the ’s.  
We are particularly interested in treatment failure rates for each treatment group, which give 
us an insight about the treatment effect (IGAXT vs. IGAPT).   
 
The probability for treatment assignment in the adaptive randomization is chosen to be 
propor tional to the posterior 1 -year treatment failure rate.  Two steps are followed to 
complete the assignment of treatments for the next patient given current data.  
 
(1) Determine the parameters, ’s and ’s, based on their posterior estimates.  
 
, 
, 
 
where data i contains the information of previous i subjects.  
 
(2) Estimate the 1 -year treatment failure rates ( TF),TF IGAXT and TF IGAPT based on the s.  
 
 
 
Then, the chance that the next patient is assigned to the IGAPT group will be  
              
1 - TF IGAPT  / (TF IGAXT + TF IGAPT). 
 
13.2.3  Decision rule for comparing treatment efficacy  
  IGAPT is considered better than IGAXT (i.e., with lower failure rates t han IGAXT) if  
 
                         
Pr( tIGAPT > tIGAXT | tIGAXT < 24 OR  tIGAPT < 24, data ) > PL. 
 
 
  On the other hand, IGAXT is considered better if

Version 17  
Page 24 
 
Pr( tIGAXT > tIGAPT | tIGAXT < 24 OR tIGAPT < 24, data ) > PL. 
     
Specifically, we will conclude that IGAPT is better if, given the current data, the probability of 
time to treatment failure for IGAPT being longer than for IGAXT is greater than PL.  The 
proposed design allows continuous monitoring.  The trial can be stop ped early should the 
interim results indicate a high probability of one treatment being better than the other.  
Specifically, we set PL = 0.[ADDRESS_435891] = 0.59  in the final analysis.  The probability calculation is 
confined to within the 24 -month period, which corresponds to the clinical implication of  the 
relevance and importance of recurrence or TRP during this period.  
 
Patients will be randomized to the achie vable radiation dose [74, 66 ] as described in section 
7.5. We assume that approximately 1/[ADDRESS_435892] to the treatment 
effects on TRP or local  failure. The calculations of randomization probabilities and decision 
rules described above will include all data across dose levels . 
 
 
13.2.4  Operating characteristics  
The operating characteristics from 1,000 simulation runs are summarized in Table s 4a, 4b 
and 4c .  According to the specifications given in the above two sections, a total of 150 
eligible patients are uniformly enrolled during the 24 -month accrual period. An event of 
either grade > [ADDRESS_435893] not yet developed an events. The 
early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_350681] a total of 20 events is observed in the entire sample. The 
decision rules for declaring that one treatment is better than the other are given in the 
previous s ection.  
  
Under H 0 (Scenario 0 in Table 4 a), where IGAPT is assumed to produce the same 1 -year 
treatment failure rate (40%) as IGAXT, there is a 4.9%  chance of early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_350682] a 5.3%  chance of early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_350683]. 
The 2.5th, 50th, and 97.5th percentiles for the proportion of patients randomized into the 
IGAPT group are 37%, 50%, and 65% , respecti vely. The median sample sizes are  75 and 
74 for the IGAPT and IGAXT groups, respectively.  There is an 8.7%  chance to claim IGAPT 
as being better and an 8.1%  chance to claim IGAXT as being better at the end of the study. 
The average trial length is  3.70 years. 
  
Under H 1 (Scenario 1 in Table 4 a), where IGAPT is assumed to produce lower 1 -year 
treatment failure rates than IGAXT (25% versus 40%), there is a 48% chance of early 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_350684], but there is virtually  no chance of early 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_350683]. The  2.5th, 50th, and 97.5th percentiles for the proportion 
of patients randomized into the IGAPT group are 44%, 58%, and 73%,  respectively. The 
median sample sizes are  74 for the IGAPT group and 54 for the IGAXT group. There is an 
81% chance to claim IGAPT as  being better and virtually no chance to claim IGAXT as 
being better at the end of the study. The average trial length is 2.[ADDRESS_435894] more than a 90% chance 
to claim IGAPT as being better and  virtually no chance to claim IGAXT as being better at the 
end of the study for a situation where the treatment failure rate decreases with dose for both

IGAXT and IGAPT (Scenario 2). We also have more than an 80% chance to claim IGAPT as 
being better and virtually no chance to claim IGAXT as being better at the end of  the study 
for a situation where the difference in treatment failure rates between IGAXT and IGAPT 
decreases with dose (Scenario 3). 
 
Simulations summarized in Table 4b show that with 10% of patients randomized to IGAPT 
and then denied insurance coverage for their treatment, we still have at least 80% power for 
Scenarios 1 -3 and about a 10% significance level under Scenario 0. With 10% of patients 
randomized to IGAPT and then denied insurance coverage for their treatment the trial will 
need to enroll a few more patients on average, it will last a little longer, and the proportion of 
patients treated on IGAPT will be a 2% -3% less than if there was no insurance denial.  
 
Simulations summarized in Table 4c show that with 25% of patients randomized to IGAPT 
and then denied insurance coverage for their treatment, we still have at least 80% power for 
Scenarios 1 and 2, about 80% power for Scenario 3, and about a 10% significance level 
under Scenario 0.  With 25% of patients randomized to IGAPT and then denied insurance 
coverage for their treatment the trial will need to enroll a few more patients on average, it will 
last a little longer, and the proportion of patients treated on IGAPT will be a 7% -8% les s than 
if there was no insurance denial.  
 
In both cases of 10% or 25% insurance denial, the trial will have only modest (<10%) 
increases in the total sample size and study duration.

Protocol: [ADDRESS_435895] statistical methods including descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis will 
be applied for checking data quality; identifying outliers, patterns, or associations; and 
providing summaries of the data distribution.  Patients’ medical -demographic information at 
baseline will be tabulated by [CONTACT_350718]. Student’s t tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests will be used to compare 
continuous variables between the two different groups.  C hi-square tests or Fisher’s exact 
tests will be applied to assess the association between two categorical variables.  Time -to-
event outcomes, including overall survival, progression -free survival, time to radiation 
esophagitis, time to treatment -related pn eumonitis (TRP), time to local failure , as well as 
time to treatment failure, will be estimated by [CONTACT_33480] -Meier method.  Log -rank 
tests will be used to test the difference in time -to-event distributions between treatment 
groups. Cox proportional hazards models will be used for multi -covariate time -to-event 
analysis to test the treatment effect adjusted by [CONTACT_350719].   In addition, the association of relevant pharmacogenetic endpoints 
and gen e polymorphisms with the time to the development of TRP or local failure  will also 
be analyzed by [CONTACT_350720].  Toxicity data will be summarized 
using frequency tables. Associations between the types and severity of toxicity a nd 
treatment will be evaluated as well. We will also perform subset analyses by [CONTACT_15994]. 
Patients who are not randomized (Group 3 and Group 4) will be analyzed using descriptive 
statistics separately from those who are randomized.  Patients in Group 3 an d Group 4 will 
be analyzed separately. Exploratory analyses may also be performed by [CONTACT_350721] 3 
and Group 4.

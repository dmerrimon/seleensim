 1.0   Background and R ationale  
 
The acute leukemias in adults are characterized by [CONTACT_497039].  Acute 
myeloid leukemia ( AML) and acute lymphoid leukemia ( ALL) are aggressive malignancies that 
lead to the accumulation of immature myeloid or lymphoid precursors, resulting in progressive 
marrow failure and death 1. They affect approximately 19,000 people per year in the United 
States; despi[INVESTIGATOR_286889], the overall 5 -year survival rema ins a disappoin ting 30 -40% 
2-4. The current treatment is intensive induction chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_497040] a stem cell transplant  2,5.   
 
Selecting patients for intensive therapy is a major c hallenge  in the acute leukemia s. 
There are multiple prognostic factors in the acute leukemias that are used to try and select the 
best candidates for intensive induction therapy. The most powerful single prognostic factor in 
the acute leukemias is cytogenetics. Using standard karyotypi[INVESTIGATOR_497031] 3 prognostic categories; good, intermediate and poor. They are characterized by 5 
year overall survival rates of 55%, 24% and 5% respectively 6. Age is also a powerful prognostic 
factor in the acute l eukemias. For patients over [ADDRESS_638943]  
(five-year survival of less than 10%)  7-9. These patients have many co -morbidities and increased 
resistant disease  2,5. Both acute leukemias in adulthood disproportionately affect the elderly 
(median age of onset of 72 and >60 for A ML and ALL, respectively) 4,10.  The presence of poor -
risk cytogenetic factors is increased in elderly patients as well as expression of multi -drug efflux 
pumps 11-12. Performance status is another important prognostic factor and the ability to tolerate 
induction therapy decreases as performance status worsens regardless of age  8. For older 
patients with poor performance status i t is currently acceptable clinical practice to offer only 
supportive care. In AML t his has led some authors to conclude that standard induction 
chemotherapy should not be offered to elderly patients13. In contrast other groups have found a 
positive clinical impact of standard therapy in older AML patients with increased survival and 
less time in hosp ital than those offered only supportive care14. In order to better help clinicians 
decide what patients should be offered intensive therapy a number of prognostic scoring 
systems have been developed15. The majority of these systems rely heavily on the cytogenetics 
of the leukemia and this information is generally not available at the time of diag nosis. An 
additional prognostic factor that could be easily obtained at the time of diagnosis would a major 
step forward. In addition to deciding on what initial therapy to give an AML patient there is 
another major clinical decision point. A nadir marrow is obtained on day [ADDRESS_638944] University

Phase Angle in Adults Treated for Newly Diagnosed  Acute Leukemia  
  
Page [ADDRESS_638945].  This study seeks to establish the 
feasibility and prognostic power of standardized phase angle in acute leukemia patients 
undergoing intensive induction chemotherapy.   
 
2.0  Objectives  
 
2.1 To  determine the feasibility of obtaining standardized phase angle measurements on 
patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_497032].  
 
2.2 To evaluate the association between standardized phase angle  measured at the 
start of therapy and treatment -relate d outcomes including : 
Primary outcome : Treatment related mortality (defined as 60-day mortality )  
Secondary outcomes : Evaluate the association of the day 14 standardized phase angle 
and treatment related outcomes, 30-day mortality, length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  transfer to 
intensive care unit  during induction, treatment response (14 day bone marrow  response , 
complete remission),  receipt of post -remission therapy , overall survival . 
 
2.3 An exploratory analysis investigating associations with the p rimary and secondary 
outcomes using different ways to categorize the baseline standardized phase angle 
measurement (obtained on the first day of treatment) and, for AML patients, the 
standardized phase angle measure obtained  just prior to the nadir marrow.

7.0 Statistical Considerations  
 
Description of measures  
 
Standardized phase angle  
Standardized phase angle will be calculated as in 20 (standardized phase angle = 
(measured phase angle−phase angle  ref)/SD  ref). Reference values and standard 
deviation come from measurements of phase angle in over 200,[ADDRESS_638950] University

 Treatment response  
14 day bone marrow response is defined as  hypoplastic marrow with less than 20% 
cellularity and 5% blasts.  
 
Complete  remission is defined as  less than 5% marrow blasts, absolute neutrophil count 
>1000, platelet count >100,[ADDRESS_638951] year of accrual it will be  deemed 
unlikely to meet its ultimate accrual goal and the study will be terminated.  
 
Primary analysis  
This study’s primary endpoint is the association between standardized phase angle and 
[ADDRESS_638952] deviation of one and investigate  the 
effects of a one unit  change . A sample si ze of 102 patients would give us 80% power to 
detect an odds ratio of 2.1, using a logistic regression model with a 0.05 significance 
level and a 60 day mortality rate of 20% . With an expected accrual rate of 50 patients 
per year, the study should complete  accrual in approximately two years and complete 
follow -up (two year follow -up) four years after the first patient is enrolled.   Descriptive 
statistics will be used for baseline characteristics .  Important baseline characteristics , 
such as age , will be add ed to the regression model as covariates for additional analysis.  
 
Secondary analysis  
We will use logistic regression to analyze the association between standardized phase 
angle and the secondary outcomes of [ADDRESS_638953] 
prior to the  nadir marrow (for AML patients).  
 
8.[ADDRESS_638954] (IRB). All subjects will provide written informed consent prior 
to enrollment in the study.

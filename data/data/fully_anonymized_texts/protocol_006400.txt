CONFIDENTIAL 8 1 INTRODUCTION 
This Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) was developed after review of United Therapeutic 
Corporation (UTC) Study Protoc ol DIV-SCLC-301 (Amendment 2, dated 19-December-2017) 
and the associated electronic case report form  (eCRF).  The SAP contains definitions of 
analysis sets, derived variables, and statistical methods to be us ed for the analysis and reporting 
of all efficacy and safety data collected for these subjects. The statistical considerations in this 
SAP supersede those identified in the protocol; wh ere considerations are substantially different, 
they will be identified as such in this documen t.  Protocol amendment(s), if required, will not 
necessitate an amendment to the SAP unless they have an impact on the statistical analysis 
methodology. This SAP was develope d and finalized prior to any unblinding of the clinical 
database for Protocol DIV-SCLC-301. Exploratory analyses  of pharmacokinetics (PK), 
immunogenicity, and pharmacodynamics data will be covered by [CONTACT_899722]. If 
additional analyses are required to supplement the planned analyses described in this SAP, they 
may be performed a nd will be identified in the Clinical Study Report (CSR).   
The SAP was written in accordance with reco mmendations outlined in the International 
Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E91 Guideline entitled “Guidance for Industry: Statistical 
Principles for Clinical Trials” and the most recent ICH E32 Guideline, entitled “Guidance for 
Industry: Structure and Conten t of Clinical Study Reports.” 
2 OBJECTIVES 
2.1 Primary Objective 
The primary objective of this study is to compare overall survival (OS) in subjects treated with 
dinutuximab and irinotecan versus subjects tr eated with irinotecan alone as a second-line 
treatment for relapsed or refract ory small cell lung cancer (SCLC). 
2.2 Secondary Objectives The secondary objectives of the study are: 
x To compare progression-free survival (PFS),  objective response rate (ORR) (complete 
response [CR] + partial response [PR]) and c linical benefit rate (CR + PR + stable 
disease [SD]) in subjects treated with dinutuximab and irinotecan versus subjects 
treated with irinotecan alone. 
x To compare the safety of subjects treated with dinutuximab and irinotecan versus 
subjects treated with irinotecan alone. 
United Therapeutics Corporation

CONFIDENTIAL 9 x To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of  subjects treated with dinutuximab. 
x To compare OS, PFS, ORR, and clinical benefit rate (CBR) in subjects treated with 
dinutuximab and irinotecan versus s ubjects treated with topotecan alone. 
2.3 Explorator y Objectives 
The exploratory objective of the study is to assess  the relationship between  selected biomarkers 
and survival of subjects treated with dinutuximab. 
3 OVERALL STUDY DESIGN AND TREATMENT PLAN 
This study is an open-label randomized Phas e II/III study of dinutuximab and irinotecan 
compared to irinotecan alone with an intrasubject dose-escalation lead-in phase in subjects with 
relapsed or refractory SCLC. 
At the time of Amendment 2, the lead-in phase of the study (referred to as Part 1) had enrolled 
12 subjects with SCLC, meeting the enrollment target of approximately 10 subjects.  In Part 1,  
dinutuximab is being administered at increasing doses, as tolerated, together with irinotecan at a dose of 350 mg/m
2 IV on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle.  Subjects receive dinutuximab at a 
starting dose of 10 mg/m2 IV, with increases administered in 2 mg/m2 increments per cycle in 
subsequent cycles if maximal pain with the prior dose LV*UDGHRU*UDGH that in the view 
of the Investigator is adequately managed and the drug is otherwise tolerated.  The maximum dose of dinutuximab that may be administered is 17.5 mg/m
2 (If this dose is reached, the last 
dose increment would be 1.5 mg/m2).  Dinutuximab dose is to be decreased in 2 mg/m2 
decrements per cycle depending on the t oxicity observed to as low as 8 mg/m2.  If a dose 
decrease from 17.5 mg/m2 is required, the initial dose reduction should be 1.5 mg/m2 (and 
2 mg/m2 for any subsequent decrements).   Subjects enrolled in Part 1 will remain on study 
treatment until objective disease progression or intolerance. 
The study safety review committee (SRC) met after 12 s ubjects in Part 1 were exposed to 
irinotecan and dinutuximab for a mean of 3.2 cycles and initially reco mmended opening Part 2 
at a starting dose of dinutuximab of 14 mg/m2/day.   At the next meeting, the SRC reviewed 
additional safety data (after 8 of 12 subjects in Part 1 had received 16 mg/m2/day) and voted to increase 
the starting dose to 16 mg/m2/day.   
In Part 2, approximately 460 additional subjects with relapsed or refra ctory SCLC will be 
randomized in a 2:2:1 allocation ratio ( 184/irinotecan group, 184/dinutuximab combination 
group and 92/topotecan group) to one of three groups as specified below.  Randomization will

product inventory control (RPIC) system provided by a third-pa rty vendor.  Specific procedures 
for randomization through RPIC are contai ned in the study procedures manual. 
x Group A: Irinotecan; or 
x Group B: Dinutuximab + Irinotecan; or 
x Group C: Topotecan. 
Subjects randomized to Group A or Group B will re ceive irinotecan at a dose of 350 mg/m2 on 
Day 1 of each cycle. 
Subjects randomized to Group B will also receive dinutuximab on Day 1 of each cycle 
beginning with a starting dose of 16 mg/m2 IV.  Dose escalation and de-escalation for 
dinutuximab will occur as in Part 1.  The maximum dose of dinutuximab that may be 
administered is 17.5 mg/m2.  If this dose is reached, the last dose increment would be 
1.5 mg/m2. 
Subjects randomized to Group C will receive topotecan 1.5 mg/m2 IV for the first [ADDRESS_1261471] cycle (initial treatment should begin within 3 working days of enrollment or 
randomization).  All subjects (Part 1 and Part 2) will be treated until disease progression or 
intolerance.  All subjects will be followed for disease progression even those discontinuing 
study drug for other reasons (e.g., intolerance). 
An end of treatment (EOT) visit will occur appr oximately [ADDRESS_1261472] administration 
of all study drugs (dinutuximab and/or chemotherapy) or prior to the in itiation of subsequent 
treatment (whichever occurs first). For subjects receiving dinutuximab, immunogenic ity follow-up will continue for up to [ADDRESS_1261473] dose of dinutuximab to assess anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and 
neutralizing antibodies (NAb). 
Follow-up for survival will continue until the subject has withdrawn consent, is lost to follow-
up, has died, or until the Sponsor makes a decision to close the study.  It is important that all subjects are followed for survival.  No crossove r is allowed given OS is the primary endpoint.

4 STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY 
4.1 General Statistical Considerations 
Data from subjects enrolled in Part 1 will primarily be displayed in listing format and simple 
statistics summaries.  Part 2 da ta will be summarized in tables according to the treatment 
groups: Dinutuximab + Irinotecan, Irinotecan, and Topotecan. Unless otherwise specified, Part 1 data will be summarized in the same table as Part 2, but will not be included in any inferential analyses.   
Descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation [Std Dev], median, minimum [min], and 
maximum [max]) for continuous variables, and frequency distributions and percentages for 
discrete variables will be utilized.  In general, the baseline measurement for Part [ADDRESS_1261475] measurement obtained prior to the date of 
randomization.   
All tabulations of summary statistics, graphical presentations, and statistical analyses will be 
performed using SAS
® Version 9.4 or higher. 
4.2 Determination of  Sample Size 
The sample size for Part 1 (approximately 10 subjects) was not based on statistical power calculations.  It is considered adequate from a clinical perspective to judge the safety of the combination of dinutuximab and irinotecan, two approved products with known and distinct 
toxicities.   
Power calculations for the randomized portion of the study (Part 2) were based on the primary 
efficacy objective: to demonstrate significantly longer OS with combination therapy (dinutuximab + irinotecan) vs. irinotecan alone.  A 2:2:1 randomization scheme was chosen to 
increase exposure to dinutuximab and to maximize statistical power for the primary efficacy 
comparison (dinutuximab combination vs. irinotecan).  A total 306 deaths in these two groups will provide approximately 80% power to detect a HR of 0.725 or a 2.3 month gain in median OS (from 6 to 8.3 months); this calculation is ba sed on a log-rank test (2-sided alpha=0.05).  If 
at least 82 deaths occur in the topotecan group, the power will be approximately 65% to detect 
United Therapeutics Corporation 
Protocol: DIV-SCLC-[ADDRESS_1261476] ratio of 0.725, or a 2.3-month gain in median OS (6 to 8.3 months) with the 
combination versus topotecan alone (a secondary objective).  Overall, a total of approximately 
460 subjects (184 each in dinutuximab combination and single-agent irinotecan groups and 92 in the topotecan group) is expected to yield the requisite number of deaths assuming uniform enrollment over [ADDRESS_1261477] is enrolled.  The mortality rate will be tracked by [CONTACT_1578] (DMC) and, if lower than 
anticipated, additional subjects may be enrolled to maintain original power specifications for 
the primary efficacy comparison.  
Any decision to extend enrollment will be based on the total number of deaths observed, not on 
the basis of the observed hazard ratio or other unblinded efficacy data.  There is no plan to re-
estimate the sample size in any manner that would affect the Type 1 error rate. 
4.3 Analysis Data Sets 
The following analysis sets will be used in the study: 
Safety Analysis Set:  All subjects who receive at least one dose of any study medication (even 
a partial dose), grouped by [CONTACT_147246].  This set will serve as the basis for the 
evaluation of all safety data, as well as demogra phic and baseline disease characteristics, prior 
cancer therapy, study drug exposure, and dose modi fications. Unless noted otherwise, safety 
data will be summarized or listed separately for Part 1 and Part 2.   
Intent to Treat (ITT) Analysis Set: All subjects randomized in Part 2 of the study, as assigned 
to treatment.  The ITT population is the primary po pulation for the analysis of Overall Survival 
(OS) and will also be used to evaluate a ll secondary efficacy endpoints and subject 
characteristics.  
Modified Intent to Treat (mITT) Analysis Set:  All subjects who were randomized and 
received at least one dose of the study drug in Part  2 of the study, as assigned to treatment.  The 
mITT population is the primary population for the se nsitivity analysis of Overall Survival (OS) 
and all secondary efficacy endpoints.   Efficacy Evaluable: All subjects randomized in Part [ADDRESS_1261478] 
one measurable lesion. Measurable lesions are defined (according to RECIST) as those that 
can be accurately measured in at l HDVWRQHGLPHQVLRQORQJHVWGLDPHWHUWREHUHFRUGHGDV

Together with the ITT population, the Efficacy Evaluable group will be us ed to evaluate ORR 
and other tumor response endpoints. 
Per Protocol Population:  All subjects randomized in Part 2 of the study who satisfy the 
following criteria: 
1) Completed at least 2 cycles of the assigned treatment 
2) Qualified for the study based on SCLC diagnosis  and prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (i.e., met protocol 
inclusion criteria 3.1.3, 3.1.4, 3.1.5; did not meet exclusion criterion 3.2.2) 
3) Received at least 80% of the prescribed st udy drug (i.e., their average dose during the 
treatment period was at least 80% of the planned dose). 
This population will be used for sensitivity an alysis of the primary  efficacy endpoint. 
4.4 Disposition of Subjects 
The disposition of all randomized subjects will be summarized according their status at the 
time of analysis. This information will include:   the number of subjects randomized, treated, 
discontinued from treatment, discontinued from the study, and continuing in follow-up.  The 
summary will include reasons for discontinuing study treatment or withdrawing from the study 
as recorded on the eCRF.   
Additionally, data listings will identify any subjects who were randomized into the study but 
did not meet all of the inclusion criteria, met any exclusion criterion, or experienced a major 
protocol violation during the study.   
4.5 Protocol Deviations and Violations 
Subjects with major protocol de viations/violations will be liste d by [CONTACT_1570].  Protocol 
deviations will be identified vi a clinical review based on aspe cts of study conduct that include 
(but are not limited to): (1) eligibility criteria; (2) treatment compliance; (3) subject safety; (4) 
efficacy assessment deviation.  Protocol deviations/v iolations will be closely monitored during 
the execution of the study and the specific set of  protocol deviations/v iolations that merit 
consideration in the statistical analysis will be finalized before database lock.  
4.6 Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics 
All demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized for the ITT, mITT, and safety 
analysis sets using descriptive statistics. The following baseline data will be summarized to 
describe the study population: 
United Therapeutics Corporation 
Protocol: DIV-SCLC-301 21 December 2019 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 14 x Demographic and Baseline Characteristics (including age, sex, race/ethnicity, 
performance status, region of enrollment, tobacco use, height, weight, and body surface 
area) 
x Cancer History and Baseline Pain (e.g., SCLC stage at initial diagnosis, time since initial diagnosis, time since relapse/progre ssion, best response to prior therapy, and 
pre-existing pain assessment) for each treatment group.   
x Tumor Burden at screening visit, defined by:  
o Size of target lesions - sum of recorded diameters for all target lesions 
o Number of non-target lesions (1, 2-3 vs. > 3) 
o Number of involved sites (1, 2-3 vs. > 3) – distinct locations of target and 
non-target lesions 
The [ADDRESS_1261480] from analysis of variance (ANOVA)  for continuous data. Any significant imbalances 
detected among the treatment groups w ill be considered in the analysis. 
4.6.1 Medical and Surgical History 
Medical history data will be coded using the Medical Dictionary of Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA), version 20.0 (or hi gher), and listed by [CONTACT_1130]. 
4.7 Prior/Concomitant Treatment 
The WHO Drug Dictionary will be used to classify prior and concomitant medications by 
[CONTACT_24621].  Prior medications will be defined as medications taken 
within [ADDRESS_1261481] dose 
(dinutuximab and/or chemotherapy). 
4.7.[ADDRESS_1261482]-line 
platinum therapy ( FODVVLILHGDVPRQWKVRUPRQWKV ) will be summarized by [CONTACT_899723] (i.e., number and percentage of subjects in each category).  The type of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], details 
of the administration, and best response to e ach regimen will be listed for each subject. 
United Therapeutics Corporation 
Protocol: DIV-SCLC-301 21 December 2019 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 15 4.7.2 Concomitant Treatments 
Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug 
Dictionary, version September 2016 (or higher).   
The number and percentage of subjects taking concomitant medications during the treatment 
period will be summarized by [CONTACT_899724] c chemical (ATC) and preferred term (PT).  
Although a subject may have take n the same medication multiple times, the subject is counted 
only once within an ATC classification.  The same subject may contribu te to two or more 
preferred terms in the same ATC classification.  
4.8 Study Drug Exposure  
4.8.1 Exposure 
A frequency table will display the number (%) of  patients in each treatment group according 
to the total number of cycles initiated, as of the cut-off date for analysis. Duration of treatment 
for each subject will be calculate d as the number of days from the date of the first dose of study 
medication to the date of the last dose taken, in clusive.  Duration of treatment, total number of 
doses administered, cumulative dose, dose intensity, and relative dose intensity will be summarized for each treatment group and each trea tment using descriptive statistics (n, mean, 
median, SD, inter-quartiles, minimum, and maximum) based on the Safety Analysis Set. 
For Part 2 subjects, methods for calculating cu mulative actual dose, cumulative planned dose, 
dose intensity, and relative  dose intensity for each medication are as follows: 
x Cumulative actual dose (mg/m
2): Sum of {Starting dose level for each cycle}; 
x Cumulative planned dose (mg/m2): Sum of {Planned dose level for each cycle}, i.e.; 
o Dinutuximab – (Number of cycles that should have been initiated between the first dose 
date and the last dose date – 1) x 17.5 + 16, if number of cycles 2; otherwise, 16 mg/m2 
if number of cycles = 1; 
o Irinotecan – (Number of cycles  that should have been initiated between the first dose 
date and the last dose date) x 350; 
o Topotecan – (Number of cycles that should ha ve been initiated between the first dose 
date and the last dose date) x 1.5 x 5; 
x Dose intensity (mg/m2/day): Cumulative actual dose / (Last dose date – first dose date + 
21); 
United Therapeutics Corporation 
Protocol: DIV-SCLC-301 21 December 2019 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 16 x Relative dose intensity (%): Dose intensity  / {Cumulative planned dose / [(Number of 
cycles that should have been initiated between the first dose date and the last dose date) x 
21]} x 100.   
For each treatment administered, infusion start and stop times, the volume infused, and reasons 
for any dose reductions or interruptions will be listed for each subject.  The number of subjects requiring a dose modification (reduction, delay or interr uption) will be summarized 
descriptively by [CONTACT_1570].   
4.9 Efficacy Analysis 
A closed, hierarchical testing procedure will be used to control the overall false-positive rate at 
5% (two-sided) for the primary comparison of dinutuximab + irinotecan versus irinotecan.  The 
primary efficacy endpoint (Overall Survival) will be tested first and, if it achieves statistical 
significance, the se condary endpoints will be tested in the following sequence: PFS, ORR and 
CBR. All the analyses described below will be performed for the purpose of displaying 
summary statistics, but once the first in the seque nce of tests yields a p-value that exceeds 0.05, 
the nominal p-value for this and subsequent endpoints in the series will be declared non-significant. 
4.9.1 Overall Survival (OS) 
OS is defined as duration of time  from the date of randomization to the date of the subject’s 
death from any cause.  Subjects who are alive or permanently lost to follow-up at the cut-off 
date for the analysis will be censored at the last date the subject was known to be alive. 
The primary analysis of OS will be performed in the ITT set using a stratified log-rank test (two-sided, alpha=0.05) to evaluate the difference between survival curves for the dinutuximab 
combination group versus the irinotecan group.  Stratification will be base d on the same factor 
used for randomization, i.e., the subject’s resp onse to prior platinum  therapy (relapse-free 
period during prior platinum treatment < 3 months vs. PRQWKV  Similarly, the stratified 
log-rank test will be used to compare OS fo r the dinutuximab combination group versus the 
topotecan group (an exploratory analysis, not part  of the hierarchical procedure described 
above). 
Median OS in each treatment group and the co rresponding 2-sided 95% confidence interval 
(CI) will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method (Brookmeye r
3, 1982).  Kaplan-Meier 
curves for OS distributions will be pl otted over time for e ach treatment group. 
United Therapeutics Corporation 
Protocol: DIV-SCLC-301 21 December 2019 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 17 In addition, two-sided 95% CIs for the OS rate for each treatment will be constructed at pre-
specified time intervals (i.e., 6 months, 12 months, …, etc.), using the log-log transformation 
methodology of Kalbfleisch and Prentice (Kalbfleisch4, 1980) where the estimated variance of

Note that the stratified log-rank test will be used for evaluating the treatment difference. The 
Kaplan-Meir plots as well as the summary statis tics for median OS and the OS rate will be 
derived from analyses without adjus ting for the stratification factor. 
The treatment effect of the dinutuximab combin ation on OS, as compared to irinotecan, will 
be estimated by [CONTACT_899725] 95% CI; the Cox proportional hazards model will be 
used for this analysis, stratified by [CONTACT_423]’ s response to prior plati num therapy.  Similarly, 
the hazard ratio and 95% CI comparing the dinutuximab combination group and the topotecan group will be provided. 
Sensitivity analyses for the OS endpoint will in clude an analysis of subjects in the mITT and 
Per Protocol populations (as de fined above). An additional sensitivity analysis will be 
performed that considers ITT subjects who were lost to follow as having died on their last 
follow-up date.  In addition, Cox proportional hazar ds model will be used to explore the potential impact of 
stratification factors and other baseline covariates on the primary OS endpoint.  The potential 
influence of the following factors will be examined:  age, gender, geographic region of

CONFIDENTIAL 18 4.9.2 Progression-Free Survival (PFS) 
PFS is defined as the time from the date of rando mization to the date of  first documentation of 
tumor progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Tumor response 
assessments will be performed using Response Ev aluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 
version 1.1. 
PFS will be evaluated using the stratified log-rank test, as described for OS, with specific 
conventions for censoring.  PFS data will be censored on the date of th e last tumor assessment 
documenting absence of PD for subjects who 1) are given anti-tumor treatment other than the 
study treatment prior to observing objective tumo r progression; 2) are removed from the study 
prior to documentation of objective tumor progression; 3) are ongoing and do not have 
objective tumor progression at the time of the an alysis.  Death or disease progression that 
occurs after more than one missed visit (i.e., 12 weeks) will be censored on the date of the last tumor assessment prior to the first missed vi sit.  Subjects with no post-baseline tumor 
assessments will be censored on the date of randomization. 
4.9.3 Overall Response Rate (ORR) 
ORR is the percentage of subjects with best overall response (BOR) of either CR or PR.  
Subjects with no post-baseline results will be  considered non-responders. ORR will be 
calculated by [CONTACT_899726].  Both confirmed and 
unconfirmed CR/PR will be  tabulated.  The rates will be pr esented along with two-sided 95% 
exact confidence intervals.  The 95% CIs will be derived using the Clopper-Pearson method.  
This method is commonly used in the literature  for reporting tumor response rates and is 
conservative, providing no less than 95% coverage probability even for small N.   
4.9.4 Clinical Benefit Rate (CBR) 
The CBR is the percentage of subjects with either a CR or PR, or SD.  The rates and the exact 
95% CIs will be provided for each treatment group.  Subjects with no post-baseline tumor 
assessments will be considered to have achieved no clinical benefit.  Subjects will be classified 
as having stable disease if assessed as SD (or better) at least [ADDRESS_1261483] dose date. 
Binary endpoints (ORR and CBR) will be analyzed using stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel 
chi-square tests, with two-tailed alpha=0.05.  Odds ratios will be presented along with 
corresponding 95% confidence intervals. 
United Therapeutics Corporation 
Protocol: DIV-SCLC-[ADDRESS_1261484] criteria (version 1.1): 
 
Best Overall Response (BOR) 
The BOR is the best response observed from the start of study treatment until the last 
assessment of tumor response recorded during follow-up or the start of any post treatment 
cancer therapy (whichever is sooner), taking into account any require ment for confirmation 
(i.e., at least 4 weeks apart). The number and percentage of subjects in each BOR category (i.e., 
CR, PR, SD, PD, and unevaluable) will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. Subjects with 
unconfirmed CR or PR assessments will be categorized separately.  The table will include a 
category for subjects who died or discontinued th e study due to disease progression prior to the 
first tumor assessment, as well as ongoing subjects  without a tumor assessment prior to the data 
cut-off date for analysis.  Subjects will be classified as having stable disease if assessed as SD 
(or better) at least [ADDRESS_1261485] dose date.   
Data listings will display ta rget lesion measurements a nd non-target lesion response 
assessments at each timepoint, together with the level of tumor response assigned by [CONTACT_1275].     
Time to Response (TTR)  
The TTR is defined as the time interval between the date of randomization and the date of first 
documented CR or PR.  CR or PR requires confir mation at least [ADDRESS_1261486] documented CR or PR will be considered as the start of the response. TTR 
will be descriptively summarized  for subjects who responded. 
Duration of response (DOR)  
The DOR is defined as the time interval between the date of first documented PR or CR and 
the subsequent first date of disease progression as determined by [CONTACT_899727] (version 1.1) or death. 
Subjects who do not experience disease progression and have not died will be censored on the 
date of their last tumor assessment.  Disease progression that occurs after more than one missed visit (i.e., 12 weeks) will be censored on the date of the last tumor assessment prior to the first 
United Therapeutics Corporation 
Protocol: DIV-SCLC-301 21 December 2019 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 20 missed visit. For OS, the death date will be used as an event time, no matter how many prior 
visits were missed. 
DOR for subjects who achieve a PR and then a CR  will be calculated starting from the date of 
the PR.  Duration of response will be derived as (earliest date of progression or death) – (date 
of first documented objective response) + 1.  Duration of response will be summarized descriptively for each treatment group using Kaplan-Meier methods, as appropriate.   
4.9.6 Subgroup Analysis 
For exploratory purposes, the anal ysis of OS will be performed within subgroups of subjects 
in the ITT Analysis Set defined by [CONTACT_5133]. The same method used for the analysis 
of the primary efficacy endpoint (OS) will be applied except th at the stratification factor will 
not be included in the analysis of the prior platinum response subgroups.

4.10 Safety Analysis 
4.10.1 Adverse Events – Part 1 
Toxicities reported during Part 1 (intrasubject dose escalation) will be listed for individual 
subjects by [CONTACT_899728].  Pain severity scores will also be listed by 
[CONTACT_899729], cycle, and time since start of infusion. 
4.10.2 Adverse Events – Part 2 
AEs will be coded usi ng MedDRA Version 20.0 or higher.  Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) 
will be grouped and tabulated by [CONTACT_899730] (SOC) and Preferred Term 
(PT).  An AE that starts or increases in seve rity after the first dose of study medication and up 
United Therapeutics Corporation 
Protocol: DIV-SCLC-[ADDRESS_1261487] dose will be considered  a TEAE.  Severity of the AEs will be graded 
according to the NCI CTCAE Version 4.03.   
All safety summaries will be generated for the Safety Analysis Set.   
A safety overview table will present the number (%) of subjects in each treatment group with 
events in the following categories:

AEs, all treatment-related AEs, all SAEs, AEs that lead to discontinuation of any study treatment, AEs with a fatal outcome, and all deaths.  The listing of deaths will include the date 
and cause of death, number of days from randomiz ation, and number of days from last dose of 
study treatment. 
4.10.3 Pain Medications and Infusion Related Reaction Medications 
Pain medications and other treatments administered to prevent or alleviate pain and infusion 
reactions (including drugs initiated during the infusion period) will be summarized separately 
for each treatment group. The num ber and percentage of  subjects in each treatment group will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_157840]. All concomitant medications, including name [CONTACT_61144], indication, dose, frequency, mode of administration, and start/stop day relative to start of study 
treatment, will be listed by [CONTACT_1130]. 
United Therapeutics Corporation 
Protocol: DIV-SCLC-[ADDRESS_1261489] and will be structured to permit review of 
the data over time relative to the start of treatment.  Values outside the normal ranges will be flagged and toxicity grades will be displayed for relevant parameters.   
Serology testing was not mandato ry and discontinued during the study. Serology data collected 
will be included in the database, but will not be presented in data listings for the CSR. 
4.10.5 Vital Signs 
Vital sign measurements will be summarized at each infusion, by [CONTACT_3148], using descriptive 
statistics; change from baseline values will be  presented for each timepoint for the Safety 
Analysis Set.  Summary sta tistics by [CONTACT_899732] v ital sign assessments 
obtained prior to the first dose of each cycle.  Clinically significant post-baseline vital sign 
findings will be reported as AEs. A by-subject data listing of all vital sign data will be generated.

medication(s) taken into  consideration.  Details regarding DMC member roles, the frequency 
of DMC meetings, contents of safety reports, and procedural aspects of DMC meetings will be 
described in the DMC charter.  Excess risk w ill be determined according to the lower 97.5% 
lower confidence bound on the difference between incidence rates for Group B (dinutuximab 
+ irinotecan) minus Group A (i rinotecan alone).  Incidence calculations will depend on the 
respective numerators and denominators at the tim e of each interim look. Wilson scores method 
will be used to calculate confidence limits to ensure  that actual coverage is close to the nominal 
level.  
In addition to the safety monitoring, the DMC will review risk-benefit based on investigator-
assessed tumor response rates a nd consider stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_899718]. 
A short-term endpoint, ORR, will be used for futility assessment.  Futil ity will be based on 
interim ORR values and the resulting conditiona l power (CP).  The DMC will use CP values 
to judge the likelihood that the completed tria l will demonstrate significantly higher ORR in 
Group B (dinutuximab + irinotecan) versus Group A (irinotecan alone ). The methodology for 
conditional power estimation is described in Proschan, Lan and Wittes (2006). No formal interim analysis of OS is planned. However, the number and causes of death in each 
treatment group will be reviewed by [CONTACT_899733] a safety perspective. Mortality rates will 
also be assessed using confidence bo XQGVDVGHVFULEHGDERYH$ORZHUOLPLWޓZRXOGEH
grounds for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_899719].   
The planned approach to interim data monitoring will not impact the Type I error rate for the primary efficacy analysis because there is no po ssibility of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_34303].  Any decision 
to stop the study would be based on safety issues or futility (the absence of an efficacy signal 
for tumor response), not a positive effect on survival. 
Selected safety and efficacy tables, listings, and figures will be provided for DMC review meetings.  Details of the DMC analysis plan will be provided in the DMC Charter.

Protocol: DIV-SCLC-[ADDRESS_1261494] page numbers. TLFs should be internally paginated in  relation to the total 
length (i.e., the page number should appear sequentially as page n of N, where N is the total 
number of pages in the table). 
7.1.3 Display Titles 
Each TLF will be identified by a numeral, and th e designation (i.e., Table 1) should be centered 
above the title. A decimal sy stem (Table 14.x.y.z, Figure 14.x.y. z, and Listing 16.2.x.y) should 
be used to identify TLFs with related contents. The title will be centered in initial capi[INVESTIGATOR_899720]. The analysis set will be identified on the line immediately following the title. The title and table designation will be single spaced. A solid line spanning the margins will separate the titles from the column headers. There will be [ADDRESS_1261495] Line of Title

7.1.4 Column Headers 
1) Column headings will be displayed immedi ately below the solid line described above, 
in initial upper-case characters. 
2) For numeric variables, units will be included in column or row heading when 
appropriate. 
3) Analysis set sizes will be pres ented for each treatment cohort in the column heading as 
(N=xx) (or in the row headings if applicable).  This is distinct from the ‘n’ used for the 
descriptive statistics representing the num ber of subjects in the analysis set. 
4) The order of treatments in the tables and listings will be: (listing only), Dinutuximab + Irinotecan, Irinotecan, Topotecan, a nd Total [if applicable]). 
United Therapeutics Corporation

CONFIDENTIAL 29 7.1.5 Body of the Data Display 
1) Listings will be sorted for presentation in order of schedule, treatment cohort, subject 
ID, collection day, and collection time. 
2) If the categories of a parameter are ordered, then all categories between the maximum 
and minimum category will be presented in the table, even if n=[ADDRESS_1261496] ribution for symptom severity would appear 
as: 
Severity Rating n 
Grade 1 20 
Grade 2 5 
Grade 3 3 
Grade 4 5 
Grade 5 0 
Where percentages are presented in these tabl es, any counts of 0 will be presented as 0 
and not as 0 (0%). 
3) If the categories are not ordered (e.g., Medi cal History, Reasons for Discontinuation 
from the Study, etc.), then only those categorie s for which there is at least [ADDRESS_1261497] 
represented in 1 or more  groups will be included. 
4) An Unknown or Missing categor y will be added to the summary of any categorical 
parameter for which information is not  available for 1 or more subjects. 
5) Unless otherwise specified, the estimated mean and median for a set of values will be 
presented to [ADDRESS_1261498] deviations 
will be presented to 2 more significant digits than the original values. The minimum 
and maximum will report the same number of significant digits as the original values. 
For example, for systolic blood pressure: 
n XX 
Mean (SD) XXX.X (X.XX) 
  Median XXX.X Min - Max XXX, XXX 
  
6) Data in columns of a table will be formatted as follows: 
United Therapeutics Corporation 
Protocol: DIV-SCLC-301 21 December 2019 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 30 x alphanumeric values left-justified; 
x whole numbers (e.g., counts) right-justified; and 
x numbers containing fractional portions decimal-aligned. 
7) Percentage values will be formatted with 1 digit to the right of the decimal point in 
parentheses, 1 space after the count (e.g., 7 (12.8%), 13 (5.4%)). Less-than signs (e.g., 
“<0.1%”) will appear when values are >0.0% and <0.1% (but not e qual to 0.0%). Unless 
otherwise noted, for all percentages, the numbe r of subjects in the analysis set for the 
treatment cohort who have an  observation (i.e., at risk) will be the denominator. 
8) Tabular displays of data for prior/concomita nt medications and all tabular displays of 
adverse event data will be presented by [CONTACT_3433] e drug class, or SOC with the highest 
occurrence in the MTD cohort(s) (Schedule 1 and Schedule 2 separa tely), in decreasing 
order. Within the drug class and SOC, drugs (by [CONTACT_157840] ), and adverse events (by 
[CONTACT_6214]) will be displayed in decreasing order. If the incidences for multiple terms are 
identical, they will be sorted alphabetically. 
9) Missing data will be represen ted on subject listings as either a hyphen (“-”) with a 
corresponding footnote (“ - = unknown or not eval uated”), or as “N/A” (footnote “N/A 
= not applicable”), whichever is appropriate. Missing descri ptive statistics or p-values 
due to non-estimability will be reported as “-” with a co rresponding footnote (“- = not 
estimable”). 
10) Dates will be formatted in SAS®ISO date format yyyy-mm-dd (e.g., “2000-07-01”). 
Missing portions of dates will be represented on subject listings as blank (e.g., “2000-
07”). Dates that are missing because they are not applicable for the particular subject will be presented as “N/A”, unless otherwise specified. 
11) All observed time values will be presented using a 24-hour clock in hh:mm:ss format (e.g., “01:35:45”, “21:26”).  Time values will be  reported only if they were measured as 
part of the study. Vital signs measured rela tive to dinutuximab infusion are captured on 
a single date. If clock times run past 24:00 for a given cycle, then add +1 to date. 
7.1.6 Footnotes 
1) A solid line spanning the margins will sepa rate the body of the data display from the 
footnotes.  
United Therapeutics Corporation 
Protocol: DIV-SCLC-301 21 December 2019 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 31 2) All footnotes will be left justified with single-line spacing immediately below the solid 
line underneath the data display. 
3) Informational footnote will begin with “Note:”. Annotation footnotes will begin with 
an asterisk and other non-numeric symbol. Each new footnote will start on a new line. 
4) Footnotes will appear on each page. Subject  specific footnotes will be avoided. 
5) Footnotes will be used sparingly, and only if they add value to the table, figure, or data 
listing. If a data display has more than 4 footnotes, then a cover page may be used to 
display footnotes, and only those footnotes essential to comprehension of the data will be repeated on each page. Footnotes will not repeat definitions al ready provided in the 
SAP. 
6) The last line of the footnote section will be a standard source line, indicating the data source used by [CONTACT_899734], the name [CONTACT_899741], and r unning date/time. 
7.2 Data-Ha ndling Rules 
This section describes naming c onventions and rules for calculati ons common to all applicable 
tables. Some rules specific to a table can be found in the relevant mock-ups. 
7.2.1 Unit Conversion to Months 
If months are calculated for a durati on, the following conversion is used. 
1) Duration (months): {Duration (days)} / 30.42 
7.2.2 Visits 
1) Relative Study Day: The first day of study treatment is Day 1. A minus (-) sign indicates 
days prior to the start of st udy treatment (e.g., Day -5 represents 5 days before start of 
the study treatment. There is no Day 0.). The relative study day for a specific visit is 
calculated as (Visit Date – Date of First Dose +1). 
2) Baseline: For all study variable s, baseline is defined as the last measurement obtained 
prior to the first dose of the study treatment.  
7.2.3 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
1) Age = (Date of informed consent–Date of birth + 1) / 365.25 and tr uncated to complete 
years. 
United Therapeutics Corporation 
Protocol: DIV-SCLC-301 21 December 2019 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 32 2) Conversion factors and calculations for height, weight, BMI and BSA: 
a) Height (in cm) = hei ght (in inches) * 2.54 
b) Weight (in kg) = weight (in lbs) * 0.4536 
c) BMI (kg/m2) = Weight(kg)/[Height(m)2] 
d) BSA (m2) = ([Weight (kg) x Height (cm)] / 3600)1/2  
3) Geographic regions will be defined as follows:   
North America  Canada, US  
Western Europe  [LOCATION_009], Italy, Spain, [LOCATION_006]  
Central/Eastern Europe  Bulgaria, Georgia, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia  
Russia & Ukraine  Russia, Ukraine  
Asia-Pacific  Australia, Hong Kong, India, Korea,  Malaysia, Philippi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], Taiwan, and 
Thailand  
 
7.2.4 Prior and Conc omitant Medications 
1) Prior and concomitant medications will be c oded and classified using the World Health 
Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary (September 2016 or higher). The specific 
dictionary version will appear in the footnote of the SAS tables/listings. 
2) Counting rules for prior/concomitant medications: Prior medications include 
medications that were taken prior to the start of study tr eatment but stopped before the 
first dose of study treatment. Concomitant medications duri ng treatment period include 
medications that started at any time and were taken at a ny time after the start of study 
treatment until the 30 days afte r the end of study treatment. 
3) Medications missing both start and stop dates, or having a start date prior to [ADDRESS_1261499] dose of study treatment with th e stop date missing, or having a stop date 
after the start of study trea tment with the start date missing, will be counted as 
concomitant. When partial dates are present in the data, both a partial start date and/or a partial stop date will be evaluated to determine whether it can be conclusively 
established that the medication either ende d prior to the start of study treatment or 
started after [ADDRESS_1261500] the end of study trea tment. If the above ca nnot be conclusively 
established based on the partial and/or present dates, then the medication will be 
counted as concomitant. 
United Therapeutics Corporation 
Protocol: DIV-SCLC-301 21 December 2019 
 
CONFIDENTIAL 33 7.2.5 Safety 
1) Adverse events will be coded and classified  using MedDRA 20.0 or higher. The specific 
dictionary version will appear in a footnote of the SAS tables/listings. 
2) Counting rules for AEs: AEs with missing start dates, but with stop dates either 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_899721], will be counted  as treatment-emergent, 
taking the worst-case approach. Special care will be taken regarding partial dates, 
applying similar logic to that of the prior/concomitant medications. 
3) For purposes of flagging individual subject data, laboratory test result abnormalities are 
defined as values above or  below the normal range. 
7.2.6 SAS® Procedures 
This section provides sample SAS® code to illustrate statistical analyses specified in the 
statistical methods section. All computer output from SAS® statistical procedures serving as a 
basis for extracted results (e.g., LIFETEST) will be  retained for quality control procedures and 
will be included in CSR appendices.

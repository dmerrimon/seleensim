Abstract
Objectives:
Primary Objective
 
1.1 To compare the efficacy of eltrombopag and placebo as defined by [CONTACT_346382] >/= 30 x 109/l by [CONTACT_4475] [ADDRESS_430374] hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).
Secondary Objectives
1.2 To describe and estimate toxicity graded as per National Cancer Institute (NCI) 
criteria.
1.3 To estimate clinical benefit as defined by: 
1.3.1 Proportion of patients achieving platelet count >/= 50 x 109/l by [CONTACT_4475] [ADDRESS_430375] treatment thrombopoietin levels and correlate these 
with platelet response.
1.6 To measure drug level and correlate it with response. 
Rationale: (Be as concise as possible)
2009-[ADDRESS_430376] is 34%, which is moderate or severe in 23% of the patients. Currently regular platelet transfusion remains the mainstay of therapy, with most patients requiring platelet transfusion several times a week. This imposes a significant burden on transfusion services and increases the cost. 
Reduced platelet production is a major cause of thrombocytopenia post transplant with 
increased platelet destruction playing a minor role. Platelet recovery occurs between 11 – [ADDRESS_430377] transplant.  Delayed platelet recovery (primary thrombocytopenia) occurs in 5%-25% of patients [ADDRESS_430378]. Furthermore, 20% of patients develop secondary thrombocytopenia, defined as a drop in platelet count not due to disease relapse after an initial platelet recovery. Secondary thrombocytopenia is caused by [CONTACT_346383]. It is often associated with Graft versus host disease and drugs like ganciclovir.
Thrombopoietin (TPO) is the primary regulator of platelet production, and is required for 
proliferation and differentiation of its precursors. Eltrombopag  is a nonpeptide small molecule that stimulates thrombopoiesis by [CONTACT_346384]. 
Eltrombopag received approval from the FDA for the treatment  of chronic Idiopathic 
Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP).   In a randomized placebo controlled trial in patients with ITP, 59% eltrombopag patients and 16% placebo patients responded achieving a platelet count >/= 50,000 per µL with an odds ratio of 9.61 (95% CI 3.31-27.86; p<0.0001). It also increases platelet counts in patients with thrombocytopenia and cirrhosis due to hepatitis C. 
In light of its significant efficacy in increasing platelet production and modest toxicity, It 
is certainly a promising agent for patients who develope thrombocytopenia post stem cell transplantation.

Statistical Considerations:
Overview
This will be a randomized, double-blind Phase II trial to compare eltrombopag and 
placebo in patients with thrombocytopenia post transplant.  The primary endpoint will be 
development of a platelet count >/= 30 X 109/l by [CONTACT_4475] 57 without platelet transfusion.  
Adaptive Randomization
We will use a Bayesian adaptive algorithm (Berry, 1994) to randomize patients between 
the two treatment arms.  The first 20 patients will be randomized fairly (i.e. fixed allocation of 1:1) between the two arms, after which the response adaptive randomization will begin.  As the trial progresses and data accrue, the randomization will be become unbalanced in favor of the treatment that, on average, has better results in terms of response, so that each successive patient is more likely to receive the treatment showing better results.
The randomization algorithm based upon this method will be implemented by [CONTACT_346386] M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. 
The target enrollment for the study is a maximum of [ADDRESS_430390] to enroll 
an average of 2 patients per month.  We will follow all patients until they go off study.  We assume a Beta(0.4, 1.6) prior distribution for the probability of response in each arm.  We use the following notation:  We denote the response rate in the placebo arm as R
P, and the response rate in the eltrombopag arm as RE.  We then denote PP as the 
probability that the response rate in the placebo arm is greater than the response rate in the eltrombopag arm.  Formally,
P
P = Prob (RP  >  RE | data from patients evaluated at day 57) and     
PE = 1-PP = Prob (RE  >  RP | data from patients evaluated at day 57)     
The trial will be stopped early and eltrombopag (placebo) selected as being superior if 
at any time during the course of the trial PP > 0.98 (< 0.02).  If the trial is not stopped 
early and all 64 patients are enrolled and evaluated at day 57, then eltrombopag will be declared superior (inferior) if P
P > 0.975 (< 0.025).  
2009-[ADDRESS_430391] 20 patients are randomized fairly, patients will be randomized to the 
eltrombopag arm with probability max(0.20, PP) and to the placebo arm with probability 
max(0.20, PE).  In other words, randomization probabilities are subject to the constraint 
that the minimum randomization probability to either arm is 20%. 
The primary endpoint is development of a platelet count >/= 30 X 109/l at day 57 
without platelet transfusion within 7 days.  Patients who drop out of the trial before 
completion of day 57 with a platelet count >/= 30 X 109/l at the time of discontinuation will be considered successes with respect to the primary endpoint.
Patients who drop out of the study after being randomized but before receiving any 
study drug will not be included in the analysis and will be replaced.  All patients who receive a single dose of study drug will be included in the analysis.
Safety Monitoring
Patient safety will be monitored during this trial by [CONTACT_346387], relapse, and mortality.  
If a patient develops a grade 3 or higher toxicity attributed to the drug, the study drug 
will be stopped in that patient. This may be recommenced at the discretion of PI [INVESTIGATOR_346379]. 
For grade 4 toxicity, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_346380] a high rate of unexpected grade 4 toxicity is noticed.  The case report form used for data collection will be PDMS/CORE.
We will use a formal Bayesian monitoring rule to monitor the rate of death or relapse on 
this study.  We wish to ensure that the rate of death/relapse at day 57 is no more than 30% in either study arm.  If there is a high probability that this rate is greater than 30% in either arm, we will temporarily halt and review the data with the MDACC IRB and FDA before continuing. 
The method of Thall, Simon, and Estey will be employed separately in each arm to 
perform this monitoring.  We will assume a noninformative Beta(0.6, 1.4) distribution on the prior probability that a patient experiences death or relapse, which has a mean of 30% but carries little prior information.  We will start monitoring with the first patient in each arm and will use the following rule:  halt accrual onto an arm if at any time during the course of the study:
Pr{57-day death/relapse on the arm > 30% |
data from patients evaluable at day 57} > 0.[ADDRESS_430392] - Page 8

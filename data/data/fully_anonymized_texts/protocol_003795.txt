1. Study Protocol 1. Objectives/Specific Aims:  
The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of a hemostatic collagen sponge, a collagen sponge sealed with a 
bio-adhesive material, a Platelet rich fibrin and a physical barrier(stent) on the palatal donor sites with the purpose 
of minimizing postoperative pain after epi[INVESTIGATOR_736548]. 
 
2. Materials and Method:  
Study population:  
A total of 80 patients seeking treatment at the UAB SOD Graduate Periodontology clinics will be recruited to 
participate in this study. The potential candidates will be approached during the treatment planning and/or pre -
surgical visit in the periodontal clinic. The investigator/research staff will give the information sheet to the potential 
participants, explain the study and obtain the patient demographics if the patient participate in the study . 
Conventional oral impressions will be made to fabricate a customized acrylic stent for the patient who will receive 
palatal stent.  
This study will conduct a survey using the (VAS) Visual Analog Scale of the postoperative pain following the (FGG) 
Free Gingival Graft pr ocedure technique with four different methods for coverage of the palatal donor site and 
evaluating differences in the patient painkiller consumption and willingness to repeat the surgery in the future. On 
the day of the surgical procedure participants wil l be given copi[INVESTIGATOR_1309] a pain survey (Visual Analog Scale) to be filled 
every day for two weeks (14 days). The participants will receive a reminder phone call daily to complete the survey. 
The completed survey (VAS) forms will be collected/returned to the re search staff on the day of their follow -up visit.  
Study Group:  
1: Collagen Plug + Sutures (CPS)  
2: Collagen Plug with cyano -acrylate (CPC)  
3: Platelet -rich Fibrin (PRF) + sutures  
4: Palatal Stent (PS)  
 
3. Study Background:  
Periodontal plastic surgery has l ong been successfully performed for the treatment of gingival recessions and 
mucogingival deformities. Numerous techniques have been proposed in an attempt to obtain predictable root 
coverage outcomes. However, the results do not only depend on the techniq ue selected but also on a variety of 
factors including but not limited to patient - and site -related factors.   
 
Harris in [ADDRESS_1006255] group 1 will be 
protected with Platelet rich Fib rin (PRF) while the test group [ADDRESS_1006256] of collagen protection with the application of a physical 
barrier (Stent) to cover the donor area.   
 
4. Statistical Analysis  
Patients’ demographics and clinic characteristics at baseline will be summarize with descriptive statistics such as 
mean, standard deviation (SD), frequency, and proportion where appropriate. The group comparisons at baseline 
will be c onducted with analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Fisher’s exact test. Outcome variables – number of 
analgesics consumed and need for additional analgesics – will be summarize as median and range in each group and 
the group comparisons will be conducted with K ruskal -Wallis’s test followed by [CONTACT_736549] -corrected 
Wilcoxon rank -sum tests. All the other outcome variables including pain score, swelling level, amount of bleeding, 
activity tolerance, and the need for additional analgesics will be summarize w ith mean ± SD, and analyzed using a 
general linear mixed regression model to account for the repeated measures. Similar general linear mixed regression 
models will also use to explore the associations between outcome variables and graft length, width, area , and 
thickness. All analysis will be conducted using SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003]) under the significance level of 0.05.

 SCHEMA  
 
This is a Pi[INVESTIGATOR_399300] -613 in combination with high dose 
cytarabine and mitoxantrone : 
 
Salvage Induction : CPI-613 at dose s of 1,500  mg/m² /day will be given  over 2 hours  on days 1 -5. 
Cytarabine will be given at 3gm/m2 for age <60 or 1.5 gm/m2 for age >60 in 500  mL NS over 3 
hours every 12 hours for 5 doses starting on day 3. Mitoxantrone will be given at 6mg/m2 daily for 
[ADDRESS_503258] doses at the discretion of the treating physician . 
 
 There will be 20 patients recruited at a CPI -613 dose of 500mg/m2/day following the same 
treatment guidelines outlined above. Individuals recruited to this dose level of CPI -613 will remain 
on this dose level for consolidation and maintenance therapy.  
 
Salvage Consolidation : All responding patients are eligible for consolidation therapy with up to 2 
cycles of the shortened 3 course of CPI -613 (same dose as induction cycle) , high dose cytarabine 
and mitoxantrone. Responding patients can be removed from trial at any time to receive a  stem cell  
transplant at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients can move to maintenance following 1, 
2 or no cycles of consolidation at the discretion of the treating physician.     
 
Maintenance Therapy : Any patient who has completed all planned consolida tion therapy  (i.e. 0, 1 or 
2 cycles)  and is not eligible  for, faces a significant delay  or refuses  a stem cell transplant may 
receive maintenance therapy with CPI -613 at a dose of 2,500 mg/m²/day over 2 hours on days 1 -5 
of a 28 day cycle . Patients treated  during induction and consolidation at the 500 mg/m2 dose will 
receive  that dose during maintenance therapy. Patients may continue on maintenance therapy until 
evidence of disease progression or occurrence of intolerable side effects.

Revision Date: 06/04/18  1.0 Introduction and Background  
1.1 Proposed Mechanism of Action  
CPI-613, the investigational drug, is a novel anti -tumor compound presumably 
with a novel mechanism of action that does not belong to any existing 
pharmacological class of anticancer agents currently used in the clinics. 
Specifically, CPI -613 is referred t o as an Altered Energy Metabolism -Directed 
(AEMD) compound, and it is selective against tumor cells (but not normal cells) 
according to preclinical studies. The anti -tumor effects of CPI -613 are believed to 
be exerted by [CONTACT_399323] (PDC).  
 
In both normal and tumor cells, energy is derived from glucose, first by [CONTACT_399324]. Once 
formed in mammalian cells, pyruvate is then converted by [CONTACT_399325] l-CoA 
that is in turn metabolized via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in the 
mitochondria.  
 
Most tumor cells display profound perturbation of energy metabolism that tightly 
correlates with malignant transformation (Baggetto 1992). The PDC is regulated 
by [CONTACT_399326] E1 subunit. When phosphorylated by [CONTACT_399327] -CoA is 
inhibited. Preclinical studies have shown that CPI -[ADDRESS_503269] University

Revision Date: 06/04/18  1.2 Background on Preclinical Studies  
CPI-613 is being developed as an anti -tumor agent for the treatment of cancer. A 
number of preclinical anti -tumor efficacy studies; Administration, Distribution, 
Metabolism, and Elimination (ADME) studies; safety pharmacology studies; and 
toxicity studies of CPI -[ADDRESS_503270] been conducted. These studies are briefly 
described below, and the Investigator’s Brochure provides detailed information 
regarding t hese preclinical studies.  
 
In Vitro and Animal Efficacy Studies  
In vitro cell culture studies have shown that CPI -[ADDRESS_503271] a 
variety of tumor cell lines such as human BxPC -3 pancreatic tumors, human 
AsPC -1 pancreatic tumors, human H -460 non -small cell lung carcinoma 
(NSCLC), and human A2780 ovarian tumors, as well as explants of different 
types of fresh human tumors including NSCLC, colon, breast, and pancreatic 
tumors. Additionally the drug has activity against human AML cell lines 
includin g MV4 -[ADDRESS_503272] resistant and parental tumor cell l ines is consistent with the proposed 
novel mechanism of action of CPI -613 that is not shared by [CONTACT_399328]. The drug -resistant 
tumor cell lines and the parental studied are listed below:  
 
Parental Tumor Cell Lines  Drug -Resistant Derivative  
MCF -[ADDRESS_503273] carcinoma line  NCI/ADR -RES adriamycin -resistant derivative(Recently 
reclassified as an Ovarian Cancer derivative of OVCAR -8 
FYI)  
A2780 ovarian carcinoma cell line  A2780DX doxorubicin -resistant derivative  
NCI/H69 small cell lung cancer cells  H69-AR anthracycline -resistant derivative  
MES -SA uterine sarcoma cells  MES -SA/MX2 mitoxanthrone -resistant derivative  
 
Pharmacokinetic Studies  
In rats, the toxicokinetic  profile of CPI -613 administered 2x weekly for 3 
weeks by [CONTACT_399329] 25, 30 or 35 mg/kg (i.e., 150, 
180 or 210 mg/ m2, respectively) was characterized by [CONTACT_399330] – an initial distribution phase followed by [CONTACT_399331].

Revision Date: 06/04/[ADDRESS_503275] article accumulation or sex differences in exposure. In minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], the 
toxicokinetic profile of CPI -613 administered 2x weekly for 3 weeks by [CONTACT_399332] 45, 42 and 46 mg/kg (i.e., 1575, 1470 and 
1617 mg/m² , respectively) was also characterized by [CONTACT_399330].There was also no evidence of test article accumulation or sex 
differences in exposure.  
 
ADME Studies  
A PK study in minipi[INVESTIGATOR_399301] -life (t1/2) values 
tended to be directly and linearly related to the log of the dose. Specifically, 
t1/2 was ~1hour at 3 mg/kg (105 mg/m²), ~1.7 hours at 10 mg/kg (350 
mg/m²), and 10 hours at 30 mg/kg (1050 mg/m²).  
 
The tissue distribution pattern of radioactivity, after an intravenous (IV) 
administration of 14C-labeled CPI -613 in rats showed that:  
1. The liver might be involved in the metabolism of CPI -613 and/or 14C-
containing  metabolites of CP I-613. 
2. Both the GI tract and the kidneys might be involved in the elimination 
of CPI -613 and/or 14C-containing metabolites of CPI -613. 
3. CPI -613 and 14C -containing metabolites of CPI -613 were mostly 
present in the  extracellular space in the circulation .  
 
An in vitro human plasma protein binding study showed that CPI -613 
exhibited 99.7% binding to human plasma proteins, a value that was similar to 
warfarin. These results are consistent with findings from tissue distribution 
studies (see above) which sho wed CPI -613 was mostly present in the 
extracellular space in the circulation, consistent with findings of extensive 
plasma protein binding.  
 
An in vitro human CYP450 enzyme inhibition study showed CPI -613 does 
not significantly inhibit various CYP450 isoz ymes, including 1A2, 2C9, 
2C19, 2D6, and 3A4.  
 
An in vitro human liver S9 fraction hepatocyte study showed that CPI -613 
was oxidized to form a sulfoxide metabolite rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], with a half -life of <19 
minutes. CPI -613 was also glucuronidated  rapi[INVESTIGATOR_399302], with a half -life of <15 minutes. Due to oxidation and glucuronidation, 
potential metabolites are a sulfoxide, a metabolite with glucuronidation in the 
terminal carboxyl group; and/or a metabolite with combination of  
sulfoxidation and glucuronidation.

Revision Date: 06/04/18  In Vitro and Animal Pharmacology Safety Studies  
An in vitro study showed that CPI -613 did not inhibit Ether -a-Go-Go-Related 
Gene (hERG) channels. Since hERG channel inhibition is the predominant 
cause of QTc interval prolongation which has been linked to Torsades de 
Pointes conditions such as sudden cardiac death and ventricular arrhythmia, 
this study suggested that CPI -[ADDRESS_503277] drug administrat ion procedures in the elimination of dead air space 
within indwelling IV catheters should be followed, since air in the catheter air 
space may enhance the acute toxicity of CPI -613 at supra -antitumor doses.  
 
The acute toxicity of CPI -613 administered IV as  a bolus vs. by [CONTACT_399333] a preliminary study in rats. The results suggested that CPI -
613 at supra -antitumor doses might be less toxic when administered as a 1 -hr 
IV infusion than as a 1 -min IV bolus.  
 
Animal Toxicology Studies  
 
Single Dose : A toxicology study involving a single IV administration of CPI -
613 in mice has been conducted. The results indicated that 0.3 -3 mg/kg (0.9 -9 
mg/m²) of CPI -613 did not induce any toxicity, whereas 10 -100 mg/kg (30 -
300 mg/m²) also did not induce toxici ty, except inflammatory reactions at or 
around the site of injection with intensity that was dose -related.  
 
Twice Weekly for 1 Week Dosing : Animal toxicology studies involving IV 
administrations of CPI -[ADDRESS_503278] been conducted in 
mice and minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107]. In mice, CPI -613 at 100 mg/kg (300 mg/m²) induced 
mortality in all female mice but not male mice. Also, CPI -613 at 30 and 75 
mg/kg (90 and 215 mg/m², respectively) did not induce any toxicity, except 
inflammation around the site of injectio n and a small increase in the spleen 
weight in mice treated with 75 mg/kg (215 mg/m²) and in the surviving mice 
treated with 100 mg/kg (300 mg/m²) of CPI -613.  
 
In minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], when given 2x weekly for 1 week, CPI -613 at doses up to 30 
mg/kg (1,050 mg/m²), th e highest dose investigated in this study, did not 
induce toxicity, other than local inflammatory reactions at and around the site 
of injection. These results are consistent with those observed with the mouse 
study (see above).

Revision Date: 06/04/18  Twice Weekly for 3 Weeks D osing : Animal toxicology studies involving IV  
administrations of CPI -[ADDRESS_503280] been conducted in 
rats and minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], as described below.  
 
In rats, when administered at dose levels of 25, 30 or 35 mg/kg (i.e., 150, 180 
or 210 mg/m², r espectively), CPI -613 enhanced inflammatory responses in the 
body in a dose related manner, as reflected by [CONTACT_2715] -related exaggeration in the 
incidence and severity of granulomatous or acute, chronic, or chronic active 
inflammation at the administration sit e inguinal vein), skin and subcutaneous 
tissue near the port, and inguinal skin and subcutaneous tissue near the 
inguinal vein, when compared to control treatment. CPI -613 at the 
toxicological doses of 30 -35 mg/kg (180 -210 mg/m²) in rats induced dose -
related incidence of mortality. The cause of death was due to significant 
systemic inflammation, and might be related to an over enhancement of the 
inflammatory responses induced by  [INVESTIGATOR_357398]-613. Deaths due to significant 
systemic inflammation were also observed in  minipi[INVESTIGATOR_399303] 46.2 mg/kg (i.e., 1617 mg/m²) of CPI -613 in 
another toxicology study. CPI -613 at 25, 30 and 35 mg/kg (i.e., 150, 180 and 
210 mg/m², respectively) elevated GGT levels in a dose -dependent manner in 
rats. This elevation is not associated with histopathology findings or other 
parameters of kidney or liver functions, and therefore not related to toxicity of 
the kidney or liver. However, it may be related to systemic inflammation 
(Yamada J, Tomiyama H, et. al. 2006), since systemic inflammation was 
observed in CPI -613 treated rats in this study. Finally, CPI -613 at the rat 
toxicological doses of 30 and 35 mg/kg (i.e., 180 and 210 mg/m², 
respectively) increased reticulocyte levels, which appeared to be associa ted 
with hematopoietic cell proliferation of the spleen, and sternal bone marrow 
hyperplasia that were secondary to inflammation initiated at the 
administration site or port in rats. The no -observable -adverse effect levels 
were 25 mg/kg (150 mg/m²) CPI -613. The LD10 or STD10 is approximately 
35 mg/kg (210 mg/m²).  
 
In minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], when administered at dose levels of 42, 45, 46.2, 50 and 55 
mg/kg (i.e., 1470, 1575, 1617, 1750 and 1925 mg/m², respectively), CPI -613 
at all dose levels induced transient vomiting t hat was transient and reversible. 
Mortality (2 of 8 minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107]) was observed in minipi[INVESTIGATOR_399304] -613 at 
46.2 mg/kg (i.e., 1617 mg/m²), due to significant systemic inflammation. 
Significant systemic inflammation was also observed in rats treated with  CPI-
613, resulting in dose -dependent incidence of mortality at the toxicological 
doses of 30 -35 mg/kg (180 -210 mg/m²) and might be due to an over 
enhancement of inflammatory responses induced by [CONTACT_399334] -613, 
as supported by [CONTACT_2715] -related exagger ation in inflammatory effects according 
to gross necropsy and  histopathology findings (see below).

patients with solid tumors and lymphomas is ongoing.  A phase I clinical study 
involving CPI -613 as a single agent in patients with advanced hematologic 
malignancies is ongoing. A phase I study of CPI -613 in combination wit h high 
dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone has recently been completed. This trial 
established the MTD of  CPI-613 as 2,500 mg/m2. A Phase I/II clinical study 
involving CPI -613 in combination with Gemcitabine is ongoing.   
1.4 Rationale  
Chemotherapy resistance is a  major cause of death in patients with relapsed or 
refractory AML . CPI-613 can increase the sensitivity of leukemia cells to 
chemotherapy in petri dishes and mice. As a single agent in a phase I clinical trial 
several relapsed/refractory AML patients had a n objective response. Additionally, 
a phase I study of CPI -613 in combination with high dose cytarabine and 
mitoxantrone has recently been completed. This trial established the MTD ofCPI -
613 as 2,500 mg/m2. Preliminary analysis of the study revealed an ove rall 
complete remission or complete remission with incomplete count recovery rate of 
45%. This compares favorably with our historical experience of this regimen 
without CPI -613. In this trial patients with poor risk cytogenetics had a 46% 
response rate, fa r superior to the 19% response seen with historical data. This trial 
established that CPI -613 can be safely administered at 2,500 mg/m2 in this 
combination and results in superior response rates. The novel mechanism of 
action, non -cross resistance with che motherapeutic agents, lack of CPI -613-
related myelosuppression cl inically  and increase response rate  make this regimen  
a suitable candidate for the proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] .

Revision Date: 06/04/18  1.5 Justification of the Dose of CPI-613 
WFUCCC [ZIP_CODE], a phase I study of CPI -613 in combination with high dose 
cytarabine and mitoxantrone given exactly as proposed in the current study 
established the MTD of CPI -613 to be 2,500 mg/m2.  A detailed analysis of the 
response data indicated that similar response rates were seen at the 2 ,000 m g/m2 
dose with less toxicity.  Further studies have indicated a dose of 1500 mg/m2 has a 
similar efficacy profile as 2,000 mg/m2 but with even less toxicity . The rationale 
behind using a dose of 500mg/m2 is supported by [CONTACT_399335]: 1) pre-
clinical evidence in mice suggesting lower doses may be more efficacious 
overtime than higher doses , 2) a traditional dose response effect of CPI -613 is not 
observed in AML patients thus far , and 3) a previous study in pancreatic cancer 
that showed remarkable s ynergy between CPI -613 at 500mg/m2 in combination 
with standard chemotherapy .

This is an open -label study, and investigators and subjects are not blinded to the 
treatment. The reason this is an open -label study is because this is a feasibility  
trial, and the investigators need to determine whether this regimen is feasible to be 
tested in larger clinical trials . The assignment of patients wil l not be randomized, 
since this is a feasibility  trial. The dose s of CPI -613 for the induction and 
consolidation phases of treatment in this study are 500 mg/ m2 or 1,500 mg/m2 
with 20 patients in each cohort for both 500 and 1,500 the study has already 
accrued 17 patients at 2,000 mg/ m2 cohort ; the dose for the maintenance phase of 
treatment in this study is 2,500 mg/m2 except for patients who received 500mg/m2 
at induction.  P atients receiving 500mg/m2 at induction  will continue wi th this

Revision Date: 06/04/18  5.4 CPI-613 Administration Guidelines  
Since information on the use of CPI -613 in humans is limited, investigators 
should be aware of potential AEs and toxicities observed in preclinical studies, as 
described below.  
 
According to animal toxicology studies, IV administration of CPI -613 can induce 
reactions at and around the site of administration.  These reactions are consistent 
with l ocal inflammation, which include red/purple/black color, swelling, necrosis, 
warm to touch, etc.  These local reactions occurred more severely when there was 
accidental leakage of CPI -[ADDRESS_503315] be administered IV by [CONTACT_104482] (not bolus), via a central venous 
catheter that is free flowing, with D5W running at a rate of about 125 -150 mL/hr, 
and free of air in the dead space of the IV catheter.  This is to minimize vascular 
irritation, inflammation and acute toxicity of CPI -613.  Accidental co -
administrati on of extra air that is present in the dead space of an IV catheter has 
been shown to induce excessive acute toxicity of CPI -613 according to animal 
studies (Study NCL -049).  
 
CPI-[ADDRESS_503316] be diluted prior to administration, as described in Section 5.3.  
Dilution of CPI -613 prior to administration reduces the rates of delivery of CPI -
613 to the body, thus minimizing the acute toxicity of CPI -613. 
 
Accordingly, the following procedures in administering CPI -613 should be taken 
to minimize local reactions and a cute toxicity of CPI -613: 
 
A. Confirmation of the placement of the IV line to ensure that there is a lack 
of leakage of CPI -613 into the perivascular space.  
B. Confirmation that the IV line is free flowing and with D5W running at a 
rate of about 125 -150 mL /hr. 
C. Confirmation that the IV line is free of air in the dead space.  
D. If necessary, r otate the site of administration for different doses of CPI -
613. 
E. Dilute CPI -[ADDRESS_503317] with D5W, as instructed in the study 
protocol.  
F. Administer CPI -613 b y infusion, not bolus, as instructed in the study 
protocol.  
G. Upon completion of administering CPI -613, “slowly” flush the IV line

Revision Date: 06/04/18  Investigators should be aware of the following toxicity observed in animals 
treated with toxic doses of CPI -613: 
1. CPI-613 at the toxicological doses of 30 -35 mg/kg (180 -210 mg/m² ) 
induced dose -related incidence of mortality in rats.  The cause of death in 
most rats was due to significant systemic inflammation, and might be 
related to an over enhancement in the inflammatory responses induced by 
[INVESTIGATOR_357398]-613.  Deaths due to significant systemic inflammation were also

For physical exams and vital signs, they are to be performed during screening 
(performed within 2 weeks prior to treatment with CPI -613) and after CPI -613 
administration  in Cycle 1.  Beyond Cycle 1, physical exam and vital signs will be 
assessed within 5 days of the next cycle doses .  
 
For clinical pathology (i.e., clinical chemistry, renal function, hematology and 
coagulation), they are to  be performed during screening (performed within 2 
weeks prior to treatment with CPI -613), and within [ADDRESS_503321] day 1 and  5 
of each cycle  rather than prior to beginning each cycle.  
 
For left ventricular ej ection fraction  assessments, they are evaluated during 
screening  and prior to consolidation therapy. Additional assessments can be 
made at the discretion of the treating physician.   
 
Anti-Tumor Efficacy – A Secondary Endpoint:  Baseline anti -tumor efficac y (i.e., 
bone marrow biopsy ) will be obtained within [ADDRESS_503322] dose of 
treatment cycle 1.   Follow -up anti -tumor efficacy will be obtained on day 14 of 
cycle 1 .  In patients treated with additional treatment cycles beyond Cycle 1, 
anti-tumor efficacy will be assessed upon count recovery (defined as 
ANC>1000, freedom from RBC transfusions and platelets>100k)  or day [ADDRESS_503323]. Anti-tumor efficacy 
assessment will also be based on investigator and institutional routine 
monitoring of the disease progression of the patients, together with baseline

B. The investigator has the right to withdraw patients from the study according to 
his/her discretion, if the investigator determines that cont inued participation is 
not in the patient’s best interest. As an excessive rate of withdrawals can 
render the study not interpretable, unnecessary withdrawal of patients should 
be avoided. When a patient discontinues investigational treatment, the 
investig ator should make every effort to contact [CONTACT_399336] a 
final evaluation. The reason(s) for withdrawal must be recorded. Criteria for 
terminating subject's participation in the study are listed below:

appropriate types of IV catheters, IV bags, syringes and clinical solutions that can 
be used in mixing and administering CPI -613 to patients.  
 
Leaching of Diethylhexyl Phthalate (DEHP) :  CPI -613 can cause leaching of 
DEHP from IV in fusion sets and IV bags (Study COM -003).  Therefore, 
DEHP -containing IV infusion sets, IV bags or syringes should not be used in 
mixing or administration of CPI -613.  Examples of syringes and extension set 
for syringe pump that do not contains DEHP (and th erefore can be used in the 
administration of CPI -613) are:  
 
Syringes:  Kendall Monoject syringes, all  mono -ject syringes are DEHP free.  
 
Extension Set for Syringe Pump Use:  All extension sets from MED -RX do not 
contains DEHP.  
 
IV Infusion Sets :  A compati bility study has been conducted showing that CPI -
613 is compatible with 4 commonly used IV infusion sets (Study# COM -001).  
Therefore, these 4 types of IV infusion sets, and IV infusion sets that are made

toxicity of CPI -613 (Study NCL -049). Accidental co -administration of extra air in 
the dead space of IV catheters during administration of CPI -613 has demonstrated 
the potential to induce acute toxicity of CPI -613 according to animal studies 
(Study NCL -049). Also, accidental leakage of CPI -613 into the perivascular space 
during IV administration, which prolongs exposure of perivascular tissue to CPI -
613, can induce significant local inflammation according to animal studies 
(Studies NCL -027 and  NCL -030).

Revision Date: 06/04/18  The investigator, or the designee, will be responsible for dispensing and 
accounting of CPI -613 provided by [CONTACT_399344].  
 
Records of inventory, dispensation and disposition (vials received, source an d 
dates) must be maintained. In addition, all doses dispensed should be accounted 
for by [CONTACT_108888], study number and name, patient identification, patient 
initials, patient medical record number and balance forward. These records must 
be maintaine d and kept at the study site, and will be reviewed by [CONTACT_399345] , or its 
designee, during periodic monitoring visits.  
 
Disposal of CPI -613 
 
The following procedures are to be taken in disposal of CPI -613: 
 
- During the study, store the used CPI -613 vials (which must be separate from the 
unused CPI -613 vials) at room temperature in an access -limited area.  
Alternatively, destroy the used CPI -613 vials according to institutional policy 
after documentation of the number of used CPI -613 vials and remaining 
volume in each used vial.  
- At the end of the study, deface the label (both used and unused vials) with a 
permanent marking pen.  
- For used CPI -613 vials (if not already destroyed according to institutional 
policy), after documentation of the number of used C PI-[ADDRESS_503362] be returned to Rafael  at the address shown

10.0 Statistical Considerations  
 
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_399312] -613 (500, 1500, and 2,000 
mg/m2. We plan to accrue between 10 and 15 patients per year for a total of 67 
patients (20 at 500 , 1,500 mg/m2  and 3 additional patients  at 2,00 0 mg/m2 ). Of 
note 17 patients at 2,000 mg/m2 and 7 patients at 2,500 mg/m2 were already 
accrued .  
  
Analysis Plan:  
 The primary objective of determining the feasibility  of administering CPI-[ADDRESS_503368] 3 
cycles . If ≥50% of eligible patients complete 3 cycles of maintenance therapy  we 
will consider this regimen feasible for future study. Given an estimated response 
rate of 50% and a 25% attrition to stem cell transplant , if we enroll 60 patients we 
should be able to assess feasib ility of maintenance in approximately 22 patients.  
With 22 evaluable patients,  a two -sided 95.0% confidence interval using the large 
sample normal approximation will extend 22% in either direction  from the 
observed value when the ex pected value is 50%.   Within a dose we should be able 
to estimate feasibility in 7 patients with a 95% confidence interval extending 36% 
in either direction.

Revision Date: 06/04/18   Participants will also be followed and analyzed for secondary outcomes of 
response rate and overall survival  both overall and by [CONTACT_2715] .  Participants will be 
monitored for survival through routine follow -up visits .  Confidence intervals will 
be calculated around the estimate s of the response rate (CR and CRi ).  Assuming 
a response rate of 0.5, with 60 participant s, we would be able to create 95 percent 
confidence intervals with a 0. 13 margin of error ( 0.37, 0.63).  We will use 
Kaplan -Meier estimation to analyze overall survival.   The frequency of toxicities 
experienced by [CONTACT_399346].  
 In exploratory analysis we plan to compare both complete response and early 
mortality (death within 60 days of beginning of treatment) to the observed rates in 
a historical cohort of subjects (CCCWFU [ZIP_CODE]) , both overall and by [CONTACT_2715] .  In 
the historical cohort the response rate was estimated to be 41%.  Using a one -
sided chi -square test, a 0.05 significance level, null hypothesis of 41%, and 
assuming 70% power, we would be able to show significant improvement in 
response if we are able to achieve a response rate of 56% or higher.  Early 
mortality in the historical cohort was estimated to be 29% at [ADDRESS_503370] for a single proportion, a 0.05 significance l evel, a null 
hypothesis of 29%, and 70% power.  To show a significant decrease in early 
mortality in this study we would need to observe a 60 day mortality rate of 16.8% 
or lower.

Rules used by [CONTACT_39785] e ntities (Institutional Review Board (IRB), Ad EERS, MedWatch, etc.) should 
NOT be used to evaluate whether an event should be reported to STRC. Only the rules for 
reporting described in this document should be considered.  
 
As defined in the NCI Data Table 4  reporting guidelines, CCCWFU Institutional  Interventional  
studies covered by [CONTACT_399348]: In-house, internally reviewed 
trials, including those collaborative studies conducted with industry sponsorship in which the 
center is a primary contributor to the design, implem entation, and monitoring of the trial, or 
participation in a multi -site trial initiated by [CONTACT_399349].   
Institutional trials are almost  always authored by a researcher here at CCCWFU. Institutional 
protocols are labeled  NCI Code=”I” for Institutional on the protocol screen in ORIS. Cooperative 
group protocols are not considered Institutional, but Research Base trials are classified as 
Institutional.  
 
The STRC  is responsible for reviewing SAEs for CCCWFU Institutional Interventional studies, as 
defined above. STRC currently requires that unexpected grade 4 and all grade 5 SAEs on these 
trials be reported to the STRC  for review. All Clinical Protocol and Data Management  (CPDM) 
staff members assisting a PI [INVESTIGATOR_399316] a clinical member of the STRC by [CONTACT_648]  (or in -person) , 
followed by [CONTACT_399350].  
 
THESE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO any faculty or staff member on the study team 
for a CCCWFU Institutional Interventional trial. Once an event is observed, it is the 
responsibility of the person who observed the event to be sure that it is reported.

Revision Date: 06/04/18  Any unexpected grade 4  event and all grade 5 events  (death during protocol intervention ) 
should be reported. These events should be reported if they occur while a patient is on study 
treatment or if they occur within [ADDRESS_503406] study treatment (even if patient begins a new 
treatment during the 30 days). This window of [ADDRESS_503407] that a shorter 
window can  be used to identify events.  In addition, if it is not clear whether the Grade 4 is 
unexpected it should be reported.  
Table 1: Summary of STRC Reporting Requirements for Institutional Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], Phase 1, Phase [ADDRESS_503408] be specified in 
the text of the approved protocol.  
 
STRC notification responsibilities of the person handling the reporting/documenting of the 
SAE:  
1. Make a phone call  (or speak in person)  to the appropriate clinical member of the STRC as 
listed below (page if necessary) —see note [ADDRESS_503409] knowledge of the event. This 
form is  found at either the ORIS main menu page or by [CONTACT_399351]://ccc.wfubmc.edu/oris/strc.aspx . 
This will ensure that all persons that need to be made aware of the event (i.e., study team 
members and STRC members) will be notified; remember to file a copy of your 
confirmation.  (Form instructions will walk you through the required fields, consult the help

Definition of Unavailable:   
As a general guideline if the first clinician that is contact[CONTACT_399353] a reasonable amount of time, then initiate contact [CONTACT_399354].  Give the 
back -up a reasonable amount of time to respond to a phone call  or page before contact[CONTACT_399355]. This is a general guideline.  You must use your best judgment as a clinical 
research professional given the time of day, severity of the SAE, and other circumstances as to 
when it is appropriate to contact [CONTACT_380247].  If the event occurs near the end of day, 
then leave messages (voice or email) as appropriate and proceed with submitting your STRC 
notification form.  The important criteria is that you have taken reasonable steps to notify and 
document that y ou have initiated some type of contact [CONTACT_399356].  
 
STRC CLINICAN RESPONSIBILITY:  
It is the responsibility of the STRC clinician to review all reported events, evaluate the events as 
they are reported; and communicate a response to the Investigator, event reporter and the 
members of STRC. The review will include but not be limited to the information reported; there 
may be times when additional information is needed in order for an assessment to be made  
and further communi cation directly with the investigator may be warranted. STRC reserves the 
right to agree with the investigator’s assessment if STRC does not agree with the investigator . 
STRC reserves the right to suspend the trial pending further investigation.  
Is there a ny immediate danger or harm that could be present for a future patient based on the 
information provided in the STRC report – and if so an immediate suspension of enrollment 
should take place.  
 
AMENDMENTS TO PREVIOUS REPORTS  
If you are not able to supply a ll pertinent information with the initial submission, once the 
additional information is available do not submit a new report . Go to the original email that 
was received by [CONTACT_399357] “reply to all” and entitle your email “ Amendment for (list date 
of event and patient ID) this will avoid duplications of the same event. List the additional 
information which you are reporting.

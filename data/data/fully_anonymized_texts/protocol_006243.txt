Version: 2.7  11/08 /[ADDRESS_418929], Form BB, 11- 08-21, AMD.docx     CONFIDENTIAL  1. Introduction 
 This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study will be conducted according to Good Clinical 
Practice guidelines as adopted by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ), applicable government 
regulations, and institutional research policies and procedures.   1.1. Background 
 Transposon biology. Transposable elements, known colloquially as “jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_8582],” constitute approximately 45% of the human genome
1. Transposable elements are a diverse superfamily of genomic DNA species that have 
the ability to either copy themselves and insert the DNA copy into a new genomic location (retrotransposons) or excise themselves from the genome and insert in a new genomic  location (transposons). Retrotransposons 
outnumber DNA transposons [ADDRESS_418930] the ability to mobilize due to truncation and mutation. Some human retrotransposons, however, retain mobilization potential, including specific long and short interspersed nuclear element ( LINE and SINE, respectively) subfamilies
3. Retrotransposon activation has been identified as a 
disease mechanism in several human disorders, including cancer
4, Aicardi Goutières Syndrome5, amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis (ALS)6, frontotemporal dementia7, Alzheimer’s  disease  
and related tauopathies8–10.  
Retrotransposons are structurally akin to retroviruses. 
Retrotransposition occurs through a copy- and-paste mechanism 
involving transcription of retrotransposon DNA to RNA, reverse transcription of retrotransposon RNA into a new DNA copy, and reinsertion of  the DNA copy into the genome
3 (Fig. 1). 
Retrotransposition is carried out by [CONTACT_338900], including a reverse transcriptase, encoded by [CONTACT_338901].   Evidence of retrotransposon activation in Alzheimer’s disease and related tauopathy. Alzheimer’s  disease is a 
progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects  over 5.8 million  Americans  and has no curative  
treatment
11. Recent  evidence suggests that Alzheimer’s  disease  pathophysiology begins decades  prior to 
symptoms12. A poor understanding of mediators  that drive disease onset and progression during the long 
prodromal, asymptomatic  stages  presents  a large barrier  for developi[INVESTIGATOR_338876]. We 
have reported that pan -neuronal transgenic expression of human tau in Drosophila activates retrotransposons by 
[CONTACT_338902]: 1) heterochromatin- and 2) pi[CONTACT_16638] -mediated silencing8. 
Consistent with the increase in DNA copy number of select retrotransposons in brains of tau transgenic Drosophila
9, we demonstrated active retrotransposition as a consequence of human tau in neurons of the adult 
Drosophila brain. We found that genetic manipulation of retrotransposon regulatory machinery modifies tau-
induced neurodegeneration, supporting a causal link between retrotransposon dysregulation and neurodegeneration
8.  
RNA- seq analysis of brain lysates from post -mortem human controls, Alzheimer’s disease and progressive 
supranuclear palsy , a “primary” tauopathy, revealed elevated levels of specific retrotransposon transcripts, 
including LINE -1, human endogenous retrovirus (HERV), and SVA, and decreased levels of Alu family 
members8. Consistent with our work, Shulman and colleagues reported a significant association between 
decreased cognitive performance in the year prior to death and elevation of specific HERV subfamilies in human Alzheimer’s disease brain, as well as an association between tau tangle burden and increased transcript levels of 
select LINE -[ADDRESS_418931] additional data suggesting that retrotransposon activation 
occurs early in human Alzheimer’s disease, which we describe below. Together with reports of heterochromatin relaxation
13,[ADDRESS_418932] -mortem human Alzheimer’s disease brain, these studies 
suggest that tau- induced heterochromatin decondensation, pi[INVESTIGATOR_338877]-AD, IRB # HSC20 0396H   Page 4 
Version: 2.7  11/08 /[ADDRESS_418933], Form BB, 11- 08-21, AMD.docx     CONFIDENTIAL  element activation is a novel, conserved, pharmacologically targetable driver of neurodegeneration in 
Alzheimer’s  disease and related tauopath ies.  
 Use of antiviral reverse transcriptase inhibitors in human diseases associated with retrotransposon activation.  
Based on the similarities between exogenous retroviruses and retrotransposons, numerous studies have 
investigated the therapeutic efficacy of antiviral medications, including NRTIs, to prevent retrotransposition
8,17–
19. The Lighthouse trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), for example, an open label, multi -center study to investigate the safety 
and tolerability of Triumeq in  patients with ALS, has recently completed phase 2a. Triumeq consists of two 
NRTIs, abacavir and 3TC, and an integrase inhibitor, dolutegravir, which blocks epi[INVESTIGATOR_338878]. 35 out of 40 patients completed the 24- week treatment period. Non- serio us adverse events that 
occurred in three or more participants included nausea and rash. While five deaths were expected based on modeling
20, only one death was observed five months after conclusion of the trial. DNA copy number of 
retrotransposon DNA was significantly reduced by [CONTACT_124808], and the ALS functional rating scale demonstrated a declining trend
21. The trial is slated for phase 3, in which overall survival and disease progression 
will be measured in a larger cohort. An additional trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) for a retroviral combination therapy (darunavir, ritonavir, dolutegravir, and tenofovir alafenamide,) in ALS is currently in phase 1. A recently-completed 12 month clinical trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) in children with Aicardi -Goutières Syndrome, in which the 
body mounts a viral response due to activation of retrotransposons, reports that patients administered 3T C, 
zidovudine, and abacavir have a significantly reduced blood interferon score after treatment
22.  
3TC was approved by [CONTACT_338903] -1 and hepatitis B virus in the late 1990’s, and 
continues to be prescribed as both a mono-  and combination therapy for retroviral infection. Combination 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_338879], as the virus demonstrates a high mutation rate that can overcome an individual NRTI
23. It is not clear, however, that retrotransposons have a mutational capacity that requires a combinatorial 
approach. We aim to reduce the risk of negative health consequences associated with polypharmacy in older patients by [CONTACT_2329] 3TC as a monotherapy at a  dose that is cost -effective and currently recommended for treatment 
of HIV+ patients in the clinic
24. Of relevance to older patients, who are often subject to polypharmacy, 3TC has 
few clinically -relevant pharmacological interactions due to its low metabolic clearance, minimal binding to 
plasma protein, and no detectable effects on liver function25. While 3TC is considered to be generally safe and is 
widely prescribed, no study to date has specifically investigated the use of 3TC in older individuals with cognitive 
impairment. Outcomes of this 24 -week open label  phase 2a clinical trial include i) target engagement, ii) CNS  
penetration, iii) efficacy based on cognitive scores and biomarkers of neurodegeneration, and iv) safety and 
tolerability of 3TC in patients with early stage Alzheimer’s disease.  
 1.2. Innovation  
 Traditionally, therapeutic development in Alzheimer’s disease has been focused on targeting amyloid beta, pathological forms of tau protein, or strategies to boost neuronal function. Rather than targeting the initiating 
proteins that have been present in brains of affected individuals for decades prior to symptom onset, we will target a mechanism that is downstream of pathogenic forms of tau that is well -connected to neuronal death.  
 1.3. Preliminary data   
 
Evidence of transposable element activation in brains of tau transgenic mice . Based on our previous work 
showing that transposable element mobilization is significantly increased in an age -dependent manner in tau 
transgenic  Drosophila and that endogenous retroviruses are aberrantly expressed in late -stage Alzheimer’s 
disease and p rogressive supranuclear palsy
8, we determined the time course of retrotransposon activation in a 
mouse model of tauopathy. We analyzed RNA -sequencing data from non- transgenic controls versus  JNPL326 
human tau transgenic mice that harbor the disease -associated  tau P301L  mutation . We find that elevated 
retrotransposon expression occurs prior to neurofibrillary tangle formation and neuronal loss  in this model , 
suggesting that tau drives aberrant transposable element expression early in disease, considerably before symptom

Staging of transposable element activation in human A lzheimer’s disease . Increased retrotransposon DNA copy 
number  (Fig. 1)  suggests that a given retrotransposon is activated and mobilization- competent. We have 
quantified retrotransposon DNA copy number in Braak III and V/VI postmortem human Alzheimer’s disease 
brain relative to control (tissue provided by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Dennis Dickson). Since some retrotransposons reverse transcribe 
in the cytoplasm and then import the new DNA copy into the nucleus, we isolated DNA from nuclei in order to 
reduce contribution from epi[INVESTIGATOR_338880]. To quantify DNA copy number, we created a custom 
NanoString codeset to detect [ADDRESS_418935] significantly increased DNA copy number at Braak III ( Fig. 2c, retrotransposons in red are 
significant). Interestingly, Braak V/VI brains do not feature significant elevation of retrotransposon DNA copy number with this relatively small sample size  (Fig. 2d ). As our experiments i n Drosophila indicate that 
retrotransposon activation is toxic, we speculate that cells  that undergo retrotransposon activation die, and that 
cells surviving into a Braak V/VI brain are cells in which transposable elements have not been activated.  These 
data, along with data from JNPL3 tau transgenic mice, which we find exhibit a similar early increase and late decrease in retrotransposon expression at the transcript level , serve as rationale for targeting early -stage 
Alzheimer’s disease in our clinical trial.

3TC mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics . 3TC 5’ -triphosphate , the active analog of 3TC, competitively 
inhibits viral reverse transcriptase, resulting in proviral DNA chain extension termination. 3TC  is one of two 
NRTIs used in the most well -tolerated and common antiretroviral therapy, Triumeq, and has mild brain 
penetration in pediatric patients25. Importantly, we8 and others19,27,[ADDRESS_418937] shown that 3TC effectively inhibits 
activation of retrotransposons, which, like retroviruses, encode a reverse transcriptase. 
3TC is absorbed rapi[INVESTIGATOR_279159], with an absolute bioavailability of 82% in adults. 3TC 
5’-triphosphate peaks in serum within 0.5- 1.5 h, with an elimination half -life of 5 -7 hours. 2- 4 hours following 
treatment, the concentration of 3TC in cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) is 4- 8% of serum concentrations in adults25. In 
collaboration with [CONTACT_338930], w e have successfully detected 3TC in brains of older mice and in CSF of 
humans who have taken 3TC.  For mouse studies, we administered a five day, 50mg/kg dose of 3TC in drinking 
water, corresponding to the current recommended dosage for HIV  adjusted to body area  (0.026 and 0.30 m2/kg 
of body weight in humans vs. mice, respectively18). The quantity of 3TC dissolved into drinking water was 
determined  based on a daily liquid consumption of 5 m L per mouse . Daily liquid intake is   not affected by 3TC 
treatment , and stability  of 3TC in drinking water is 90- 103% of the initial value over one week18. Using 
HPLC/MS /MS chromatography29, we measured 3TC levels in  plasma ( Fig. 3a)  and brains ( Fig. 3b)  of 24-25 

ART-AD, IRB # HSC20 0396H  Page 7 
Version: 2.7  11/08 /[ADDRESS_418938], Form BB, 11- 08-21, AMD.docx     CONFIDENTIAL  month old 3TC -treated mice, and calculated the brain  to plasma  ratio (Fig. 3c ). Similarly, we have used 
HPLC /MS/MS chromatography to quantify 3TC levels in plasma ( Fig. 3d ) and  CSF (Fig. 3e ) of humans who are 
actively taking 3TC . With this very limited human sample size, 3TC CNS penetration does not significantly differ 
between younger individuals and older individuals ( Fig. 3f , young=average age of 28 years old, old=average age 
of 65 years old).  In mice and in younger and older human individuals, we find that the CNS harbors approximately 
20% of the levels of circulating 3TC. 
 
 
 
1.4. Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
 The study will consist of a screening/baseline period of [ADDRESS_418939] -intervention visit one month following treatment . During the treatment period, daily 300 mg 
3TC will be taken orally with or without food. The selected dosage is what is currently prescribed for HIV -1 
patients. 3TC is widely prescribed and well -tolerated. While 3TC has fewer  side effects than many other 
antiretroviral treatments, side effects  can include cause vomiting, weakness, diarrhea, headache, and nausea.  
 2. Study Objective  
 The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of 3TC to suppress neurodegeneration based on fluid- based 
biomarkers and neuropsychological assessment, the ability of 3TC to engage its intended target (retrotransposon-derived reverse transcriptase), and the safety , tolerability and CNS penetration of 3TC in patients with early stage 
Alzheimer’s disease. This research, if positive,  may provide the  initial data on target engagement and Alzheimer’s 
disease-relevant outcomes for future trials.  3. Study Design  
 3.1. Subjects  
 
The study staff will pre -screen up to [ADDRESS_418940] 12 men and women aged 50- 99 
years with a clinical diagnosis of early Alzheimer’s disease based on a CDR of 0.[ADDRESS_418941] initial proof -of-concept data on 3TC efficacy, target engagement, CNS 
penetration, and safety in older adults with early stage Alzheimer’s disease. If successful, data will be used to 

ART-AD, IRB # HSC20 0396H   Page 8 
Version: 2.7  11/08 /[ADDRESS_418942], Form BB, 11- 08-21, AMD.docx     CONFIDENTIAL  design a  larger phase 2 clinical trial.  We aim to I ) Quantify 3TC CNS penetration and target engagement, II) 
Determine if 3TC suppresses Alzheimer’s disease -relevant outcomes, and III) Asses s the safety and tolerability 
of 3TC in older individuals with early Alzheimer’s disease. The study will consist of a screening/baseline period 
of [ADDRESS_418943] CSF, and a 
blood draw. Participants will return to clinic on day one of treatment and at weeks 8, 16, and 24 of treatment  to 
complete medication checks, physical examinations, brief cognitive screening, and blood draw (see Table 2 for additional details) . At week [ADDRESS_418944] CSF, and a blood draw. One month after the final dose of 
medication, participants will return to the clinic for a final safety assessment and disenrollment.  
 
3.3. Study Endpoints   
 Primary outcome:   
Quantify 3TC CNS penetration and target engagement.   3TC 5’ -triphosphate competitively inhibits viral reverse transcriptase, resulting in proviral DNA chain 
extension termination. 3TC is absorbed rapi[INVESTIGATOR_279159], with an absolute bioavaila bility of 
82% in adults. 3TC 5’ -triphosphate peaks in serum within 0.5- 1.5 h, with an elimination half -life of 5 -7 hours. 
2-4 hours following treatment, the concentration of 3TC in CSF is 4- 8% of serum concentrations in adults
25. 
We will determine the extent of CNS penetration in older patients with Alzheimer’s disease by [CONTACT_338904] 3TC 5’ -triphosphate using HPLC/MS /MS chromatography31 using plasma and 
CSF collected during the clinic visit corresponding to the last dose of 3TC (week 24 of treatment).  
 To quantify target engagement, we will measure reverse transcriptase activity in plasma and CSF collected 
from participants prior to (day 1) and following treatment (week 24 of treatment) using a modified version of 
the EnzCheck Reverse Transcriptase Assay . This assay utilizes a Pi[INVESTIGATOR_150951] -based reagent to detect double 
stranded DNA or RNA- DNA heteroduplexes formed by [CONTACT_338905] a biological sample. 
As samples can be read by a microplate reader, this assay is suitable for rapid, sensit ive and large -scale testing 
of many biological samples.  
 As an additional indicator of the ability of 3TC to suppress endogenous reverse transcriptase activity, we will compare retrotransposon DNA copy number in PBMCs and CSF prior to (day 1) and following treatment 
(week 24 of treatment) using the NanoString codeset that we have developed to detect retrotransposon DNA 
(Fig. 2c , d).  
 
Secondary outcomes:   
 
a) Assess changes in cognition , functional status , and neurodegeneration .  
 
We will use neuropsychological testing and fluid- based biomarkers of neurodegeneration to assess the degree 
of neurodegeneration. Following 24 weeks  of treatment, we will measure cognitive change from baseline 
using the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (PACC -5) score. The PACC score was designed to 
serve as a primary outcome to evaluate subjects  with prodromal Alzheimer’s disease, and studies have shown 
that cognitively healthy individuals with pathologic evidence of Alzheimer’s disease perform worse on the 
PACC when compared to healthy controls without pathologic evidence of AD
32,33. More recent updates to the 
PACC paradigm include measures of semantic memory. The newly -adopted PACC -5 is thought to 
demonstrate improved detection of early Alzheimer’s disease -related cognitive decline34. We therefore 
ART-AD, IRB # HSC20 0396H   Page 9 
Version: 2.7  11/08 /[ADDRESS_418945] measure  to capture Alzheimer’s disease- related 
cognitive change  over time.    
  
In addition to pre - and post -treatment PACC -5 assessment, participants will undergo serial cognitive 
screening using the tablet -based Brain Health Assessment ( BHA)  at the initiation of treatment and weeks 8, 
16, and [ADDRESS_418946] reliability is not dependent upon familiarity with tablet use – an important caveat when introducing new technology i n 
a cohort of older adults. As such, all subjects will complete the BHA at clinic visits, and cognitive functioning 
will be captured every [ADDRESS_418947] -treatment, we will quantify biomarkers of  neurodegeneration 
and neuroinflammation including neurofilament light chain (NfL)
35, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)36, 
and inflammatory cytokines .  
 
b) Establish  the safety  and tolerability  of 24-week  3TC  treatment  in older adults  with  early  
symptomatic  Alzheimer’s  disease.   
 Participants will be assessed at clinic visits every two months during the 24- week  treatment period to track 
adverse events and compliance to study drug regimen. Physical examination, vital signs, cognitive functioning (BHA), and blood draws for laboratory assessments of safety and compliance (complete blood count  (CBC) , 
comprehensive metabolic panel  (CMP), plasma 3TC levels)  will be performed at each visit, and the long- term 
effects of chronic 3TC treatment will be evaluated a month post -treatment.  
 3.4.  Potential Risks to Subject Safety  
 
a) Drug Administration  
 3TC is indicated  for use in HIV and HBV. In clinical trials  of 3,[ADDRESS_418948]  
frequently reported  (≥ 15%) adverse event s are headache, nausea, malaise, fatigue, nasal sign s and symptoms, 
diarrhea, and cough . Other  common adverse reactions are decreased appetite, musculoskeletal pain, and 
dizziness  (Please refer to Attachment C, Full Prescribing Information ). 3TC treatment  may result  in 
neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <  750/mm
3), elevated amylase (> 2x upper limit of normal) and liver 
enzymes ( aspartate transaminase/ alanine transaminase > 5x upper limit of normal). Clinical adverse reactions 
are similar for subjects receiving 3TC  [ADDRESS_418949] serious side effects : exacerbation of 
hepatitis B, lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, immune reconstitution syndrome, and 
pancreatitis (more common in pediatric patients) . Female sex and obesity are considered risk factors for lactic 
acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis in patients treated with antiretrovirals such as 3TC. 
 
b) Blood withdrawal   
 
o Pain, bleeding, bruising, or swelling a t the site of the needle stick  
o Hematoma  
o Nerve damage  
ART-AD, IRB # HSC20 0396H   Page 10 
Version: 2.7  11/08 /[ADDRESS_418950], Form BB, 11- 08-21, AMD.docx     CONFIDENTIAL  o Infection  
o Fainting or light -headedness  
 
* To minimize these risks, a qualified phlebotomist will perform venipunctures  
 
c) Cognitive Assessment   
 
o Psychosocial -  embarrassment, discomfort or a nxiety upon testing memory and thinking 
o Patient or s tudy partner -reported outcomes include questionnaires related to Alzheimer’s disease 
symptoms, cognition, and mood scales  
 
d) Lumbar Puncture  
 
o Temporary pain and discomfort in the back  
o Headache  
o Persistent low -pressure headache due to leakage of CSF. If headache persists, it may require additional 
treatment.  Uncommonly, a blood patch (injection of some of participant blood into the lumbar puncture site to patch the CSF leak) may be require d. 
o Infection  
o Damage to nerves in the back  
o Bleeding into the CSF space  
o Allergic reaction to the local anesthetic (lidocaine) used for the lumbar puncture, such as swelling or rash at the puncture site  
 
The use of anticoagulants increases the risks of bleeding and thrombotic complications during lumbar 
punctures. Subjects will be screened for use of anticoagulants before the lumbar puncture is scheduled. Subjects  taking anticoagulants will not be scheduled for the lumbar puncture procedure.  
 Subjects will have their medications screened before the lumbar puncture. Subjects taking antiplatelets and NSAIDS will stop medication for 5 days before the lumbar puncture. Subjects taking acetic acid 
derivatives, Cox2 inhibitors, mefenamic acid, cilostazol (P letal), vorapaxar  (Zontivity ) will discontinue 
medications for [ADDRESS_418951]’s 
primary care doctor to determine if it would be safe to discontinue the subject’s medications for 3 or 5  
days.   If clinically indicated and upon the providing physician’s discretion, t he lumbar puncture may be 
completed with fluoroscopy. Fluoroscopy involves exposure to radiation. The amount of radiation 
exposure received from the procedure is equivalent to a uniform whole -body dose of 300 mrem (a unit of 
radiation exposure) which is approximately 0.5 times the amount of environmental radi ation exposure 
(620 mrem dose) that each member of the general public receives  per year. There is no known minimum 
level of radiat ion exposure that is recognized as being totally free of the risk of causing genetic defects 
(abnormal cells) or cancer. However, the probability of harm from such risk associated with the amount of radiation exposure received from fluoroscopy is considere d to be low when compared to other everyday 
risks each member of the general public receives each year, depending on the amount of radiation each participant  has personally been exposed to in the past, particularly in the previous year.  
 
*To minimize these risks, a qualified provider specifically trained in the procedure will perform the lumbar punctures.

Additional methods  may include posted study fliers in medical offices or senior centers, community 
engagement activities, and/or newspaper or web -based advertisements.  A UT Health website detailing the 
project  will be published online and can  be referenced by [CONTACT_338906]. The study will be 
published on clinicaltrials.gov. All these strategies will be considered, made available and 
implemented/adapted according to the local policies and regulations . Telephone pre -screening prior to the 
clinic screening visit may be employed to ensure potential candidates will meet inclusion and exclusion 
criteria for enrollment.  
 
b) Retention  
 
Transportation, parking and/or meal vouchers may be provided to participants according to local policies.  
 4.4. Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
 4.4.1. When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
 
Subjects have the right to withdraw fully or partially from the study at any time and for any reason without prejudice to their future medical care by [CONTACT_8018]. Withdrawal of full consent for 
a study means that the subject does not wish to receive further investigational treatment and does not wish to or is unable to continue further study participation including any follow -up in person, by [CONTACT_648], through 
third pa rties including relatives or friends, via discussion with other treating physicians, and by [CONTACT_338907]; subject data up to withdrawal of full consent will be included in the analysis of the study. Any subject may withdraw full consent to partic ipate in the study at any time during the study. The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_119251]-investigator will discuss with the subject appropriate procedures for withdrawal from the study.  
 
4.4.2. Data Collection and Follow -up for Withdrawn Subjects  
 
“Lost to follow -up” will be defined as a subject missing two  or more consecutive visits, not answering or 
responding to three follow up phone calls to subject or emergency contacts, or returned receipt of one  
certified letter. Investigator will consult with Study Statistician with regard to any incomplete data set as 
compared to the full data set that fully supports the analysis.  If a subject withdraws consent to participate in the study, attempts will be made to obtain permiss ion to record survival data up to the protocol -described 
end of subject follow -up period. Investigator and designated research staff make it a high priority to obtain 
survival data on all subjects lost to follow up.  
 5. Study Drug  
 5.1. Description  
 
a) Drug Properties  
 
3TC is a first -generation, synthetic nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor approved in the US 
in 1995 for the treatment of HIV and Hepatitis B virus . The CAS number for 3TC  is 134678- 17-4. The 
molecular formula is C 8H11N3O3S , which corresponds to a formula weight of 229.26 g/mol. 3TC is a 
white to off -white  crystalline  solid with a melting point of 160–162°C. 3TC is soluble  in water ( 70 mg/mL) 
at 20°C. 3TC tablets contain the following inactive ingredients: black iron oxide, hypromellose, 
magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, polysorbate 80, sodium starch glycolate and titanium dioxide . 
 
ART-AD, IRB # HSC20 0396H   Page 13 
Version: 2.7  11/08 /[ADDRESS_418954], Form BB, 11- 08-21, AMD.docx     CONFIDENTIAL  b) Mechanism of Action  
 
The nucleoside analog 3TC inhibits the activity of reverse transcriptase to prevent retro viral (or 
retrotransposon27) replication.  3TC is phosphorylated intracellularly to its active metabolite, 3TC  5’-
triphosphate , which  is incorporated into newly synthesized DNA by [CONTACT_922], causing DNA 
chain termination. Antiviral activity is detected  at concentrations without toxicity in humans and is 
detected at low nanomolar concentrations (EC 50 of 0.003- 15 mM) in cell culture25.  
 5.2. Treatment Regimen  
 
a) Administration  Protocol  
 Study subjects will come to the  Clinical Research Center of the San Antonio Claude D. Pepper Center i n the  
Barshop Institute building  on the first day of each drug schedule (i.e. day 1 of each drug cycle). At this visit , 
subjects will be given a two -month supply of 3TC, which consists of a bottle of 6 0 tablets. Two -month r efills 
will be provided at week s 8 and 16. Participants will receive 24 weeks of drug in total .  
 
b) Assigning Subjects  
 In this open- label  pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], all subjects will receive drug with the same dose and frequency. The study staff  
stores the Enrollment key, which is kept in a locked cabinet at the site or on a secure server. Study staff maintains source documents, data records and specimens in a de -identified manner labeled with a  unique 
Subject ID number.  
 5.3. Preparation and Administration of Study Drug  
 Study drug will be stored at the Research Pharmacy in the Barshop Institute Clinical Research Center and dispensed by [CONTACT_3647] . A two-month quantity of 3TC  will be  dispensed to patients on day 1 of Visit 1 , and 
day 1 of weeks 8 and 16 (Visits 2, and 3, respectively)  of treatment. 
 5.4. Subject Compliance Monitoring  
 Study staff will perform follow -up phone calls at designated intervals to monitor compliance to the treatment 
regimen  and safety monitoring following lumbar puncture procedure  (see Study Visits beginning Section 6.4). 
Participants and/or their study partner will be asked  to bring empty pi[INVESTIGATOR_338881]. The s tudy coordinator will complete medication reconciliation at each visit.    
 5.5. Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
 Exclusionary medications: Current use of drugs containing sorbitol (e.g. orlistat and sorbitol) , current use of 
memantine, and current  use of NRTIs or non- NRTIs .  
 5.6. Packaging    
 
a) Nature and c ontents of the c ontainer  
 
o Drugs for individual subject use will be clearly labeled and identified as “ 3TC” and “For 
Investigational Use only —Not for Resale. ”

5.6.1. Receipt of Drug Supplies  
 
Any damaged or unusable study drug in each shipment will be documented by [CONTACT_338909].  The Research Pharmacist will notify the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_338883]. Upon 
receipt, t he Research Pharmacy reconciles inventory received per local standard operating procedure and 
makes copi[INVESTIGATOR_338884]. 
 5.6.2. Storage  
 
3TC tablets should be stored at 25° C (77° F); excursions permitted between 15° – 30° C (59° –86° F) (see 
USP Controlled Room Temperature ). For more details, please see also EPI[INVESTIGATOR_122498] ® (lamivudine /3TC ) Full 
Prescribing Information 05- 2019, Attachment  C, Pharmacy Manual.  
 5.6.3. Dispensing of Study Drug  
 
Designated staff from the Research Pharmacy maintain the Drug Inventory and Dispensing Logs to track how, when and to 3TC  was dispensed to subjects. Study clinical staff will document administration in 
research records regarding dosing, unused drug, drug damaged, or wasted. Study subjects are instructed to swallow 3TC  whole, and not to chew or crush medication when administered.  
 5.6.4. Return or Destruction of Study Drug  
 
Procedures for final reconciliation of the site’s drug supply at the end of the study will be in accordance with local site Pharmacy standard operating procedures. Procedures for proper handling and disposal of 
antiviral drugs should be considered. There is no general agreement that all the procedures recommended 
in the guidelines are necessary or appropriate. 3TC tablets consist of a core tablet (containing the active drug substance), surrounded by a film coating to prevent exposure of pharmacy and clinica l personnel to 
the active drug substance. However, if tablets are crushed or broken, pharmacy and clinical personnel should wear disposable gloves.  
 6. Study Visits and Procedures  
 6.1. Visit 0, Consent and Screening Visit  
 
The participant will come  to the research site  accompanied by a Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) for 
the consenting process.  
 
In line with recommendations put forth by [CONTACT_338910], Aging, and Dementia 
Task Team, researchers will first attempt to seek consent from the study participant with AD. In order to have 
appropriate safeguards, decision- makin g capacity specific to participation in the research study (i.e., 
understanding the purpose, procedures, risks and benefits of study participation) will be evaluated using a 
standardized instrument for assessing capacity to consent developed by [CONTACT_338911] , 2007 and tailored to the 
study  (see attachment D) . In the event of questions regarding capacity, the research coordinator and/or research 
nurse practitioner will consult with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_338885]. If the study participant is found 
to lack capacity to consent, researchers will obtain consent from a legally authorized representative (LAR) who 
will be instructed to respect the will and preferences of the study participant. When a LAR is necessary, the

Version: 2.7  11/08 /[ADDRESS_418970] data on brain penetrance and target engagement  of a study medication. The 
sample size is feasible given the budget constraints of the grants from the William and Ella Owens Medical 
Foundation and Bartell  Zachry Endowment for Research in Neurodegenerative Disorders .  
 7.2. Statistical Methods  
 Analytical  Approach  
 Similar to an early phase 2 trial, we seek  preliminary evidence of CNS  penetrance, changes in reverse transcriptase 
activity and neuroinflammatory and other Alzheimer’s disease- relevant markers, with secondary evaluation of 
safety and tolerability to estimate the pre/post differences in pertinent laboratory values and adverse event reporting. We will report the change in post intervention laboratory values relative to baseline with the 95% 
confidence interval. Experimental results will be expressed as means ± SE.   
We will  assess cognitive performance at two timepoints: prior to 3TC and after six months of treatment. Primary 
outcomes will investigate change in PACC -5 score over the course of 3TC. Secondary analyses will similarly 
investigate change in cognitive performance over two timepoints, but analyses will emphasize significant change (>1.[ADDRESS_418971] deviations below published norms on > 2 tests OR scoring > 2.[ADDRESS_418972] deviations below 
published norms on > one test) in general and within specific cognitive domains (memory, executive functioning, 
language). Exploratory analyses will examine the sensitivity and utility of the BHA in tracking cognitive change over the course of 3TC.  
 8. Safety and Adverse Events 
 8.1. Definitions  
 
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  - Any incident, experience, or outcome that 
meets all  the following criteria:  
 
o Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency (i.e. not described in study- related documents such as the  
institutional review board  (IRB)-approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc.) 
o Related or possibly related to participation in the research  (i.e. possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]) 
ART-AD, IRB # HSC20 0396H  Page 23 
Version: 2.7  11/08 /[ADDRESS_418973], Form BB, 11- 08-21, AMD.docx     CONFIDENTIAL  o Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm). 
 
Adverse Event (AE)  - Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, including any 
abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the research , whether or not it is considered related to the subject’s 
participation in the research.  
Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as AEs .  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are 
considered to be AEs if the abnormality: 
 
o Results in study withdrawal 
o Is associated with a serious AE  
o Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
o Leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
o Is considered by [CONTACT_338913] (SAE)  - AEs  are classified as serious or non -serious.  An SAE  is any AE that:  
 
o Results in death  
o Is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred)  
o Results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
o Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
o Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
o Based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s health and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition (examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in the emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse). 
 AE Reporting Period  - The study period during which AEs  must be reported is normally defined as the period 
from the initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study treatment follow -up.  For this study, the study 
treatment follow -up is defined as up to [ADDRESS_418974] administration of study treatment or procedures.  
 Pre-existing Condition  - A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A pre -existing 
condition should be recorded as an AE if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during 
the study period.  General Physical Examination Findings  - At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be 
recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an AE  must also be recorded and documented as an AE .  
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values  - A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an AE  if any one of 
the following conditions is met:  
 
o The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality 
o The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity 
o The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of dose, discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow-up assessments, further diagnostic investigation, etc.

protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an AE if the condition meets the criteria for and AE. Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an AE 
in the following circumstances:  
 
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14841] a preexisting condition.  
o Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an AE  if the purpose of the surgery was elective or 
diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful. 
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14842]. 
o Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14843], unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14844]. 
 
8.2. Recording of AEs 
 At each contact [CONTACT_1155], the investigator or study staff will seek information about AE  by [CONTACT_28812], if appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all AEs will be recorded immediately in the source document, and in the appropriate AE section of the case report form.  AEs will be tracked using the HSC IRB AE tracking form or  REDCap data management tool (See Section 9.3) to be reviewed by [CONTACT_338914] a monthly and ad hoc  basis, depending on severity and expected/unexpected nature of the event.  
 All AEs occurring during the study period will be recorded. The clinical course of each event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  SAEs that are still  ongoing at the end of the study period will be followed up to determine the final 
outcome.  Any SAE that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study participation will be recorded and reported per  Institutional policy and according to FDA 
requirements.  
 8.3. Reporting of SAEs  and Unanticipated Problems  
 Any incidents, experiences, and outcomes reported or discovered during clinic or telephone assessment that meet AE criteria will be documented.  Any AE reported as SAE requires submitting a Prompt Report Form
 to the IRB 
with a copy of the SAE or Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk of Subjects of Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961]) prompt report submitted to the Pepper DSMB for review as well as the funding agency Program Officer within 24 hours of notification to PI. All AE that are not serious nor UPI[INVESTIGATOR_338887], FDA  (if applicable) or other pertinent research committees with oversight of the 
study. 
 SAE and or UPI[INVESTIGATOR_338888]. Events that do not involve AE or SAE (non-
AE UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961]), and which are a result of study participation may also require prompt reporting to the IRB per local policy. The report will include a description of the event, when and how it was report ed, as well as any official 
chart records or documentation to corroborate the event or the reporting of the event. All AE will be graded as mild, moderate, or severe. Any action resulting in a temporary or permanent suspension of this study (e.g. local site IRB actions) will be reported per funding agency, DSMB, and IRB stipulations. 
 SAE s still ongoing at the end of the study period will be followed up to determine the final outcome and or 
referred to participant’s primary care provider.  Any SAE that occurs after the study period that is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study participation will be recorded and reported per Institutional policy and according to FDA requirements.

document approved by [CONTACT_338916].
 
 8.4. Medical Monitoring  
 The investigator initiating the study  will review the safety and progress of this study on a frequent  basis or when  
needed if protocol deviations/violations, SAE or SAE -UPI[INVESTIGATOR_338891] .  If one is  designated, the Medical Safety 
Monitor  (MSM) will be a Staff Physician at UTHealth San Antonio in the Department of Neurology, with 
appropriate expertise to objectively adjudicate events and safety.  If no MSM is assigned, the Pepper Center 
DSMB shall serve in this capacity and receive notification of SAE or SAE-UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961]. (See Section 10.1)  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_128821]- PI [INVESTIGATOR_338892].    8.4.1. Investigator reporting of Protocol Deviations /Violations  
 Departures during the conduct of a research study constitute a protocol deviation, violation or exception and as such must be reported to the UTHSCSA IRB.  Tracking and reporting of protocol deviations and violations to the IRB is the responsibility of the PI. To determine whether deviations or violations require prompt reporting or other action, refer to the IRB document entitled “ Decision Tree – Evaluating Departures
” on the IRB website. Failure to report departures from the 
protocol according to IRB policy may constitute possible non- compliance, which will require a Prompt Report 
Form  and possible FDA reporting by [CONTACT_1744].  
 
Deviations and violations may be identified in a number of ways including:  
 
o A report by [CONTACT_338917].  
o The IRB may learn of event through its continuing review of ongoing research.  
o Compliance reviews (audits) conducted by [CONTACT_338918].

Version: 2.7  11/08 /[ADDRESS_418978], Form BB, 11- 08-21, AMD.docx     CONFIDENTIAL  o A report by [CONTACT_338919] (Hotline) or one of the HSC affiliated institutional compliance offices.  
o A report by [CONTACT_338920], department, institution, or official.  
o An audit or report from the study sponsor or sponsor’s monitoring entity. 
 
8.4.2. Definitions of Protocol Deviations/Violations  
 Definitions of protocol deviations , protocol violations, and emergency violations can be found in the UTHSA 
Glossary of Human Research Terms . For more information, refer to UTHSCSA IRB Policy  
 
 
8.5. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_338893] a study- related death or SAE occurs, the decision to stop the trial, either temporarily 
or permanently, will be the responsibility of the MSM or Pepper Center DSMB  in collaboration with the 
Sponsor Investigator.  Reasons why the researchers may need to end the subject’s participation in the study:  
 
• The researcher believes that it is not in the subject’s best interest to stay in the study  
• Adverse drug reaction that does not resolve by [CONTACT_338921]  
• Subject becomes ineligible to participate due to concomitant use of an exclusionary medication  
• Subject’s health condition changes and needs treatment that is not allowed while participating in the study 
• Subject does not follow instructions from the research team. 
• The study is stopped  
  9. Data Handling and Record Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  
 9.1. Confidentiality  
 Information learned about all subjects will be kept confidential.  All data and protected health information in paper form will be kept confidential by [CONTACT_338922] (password protected and/or double locked). Subjects will not be identified in any way in any publication.    9.2. Source Documents  
 Source data will be originated both electronically and on paper. Electronic data may be originated in either the medical record or in REDCap (questionnaires answered verbally). The study team will maintain a list of forms to identify where source data are generated for this protocol.  Print all entries legibly in black ink.  Erasures and white -out material are prohibited. If any entry error has been 
made on paper , to correct such an error, draw a single straight line through the incorrect entry and enter the 
correct data above it. All changes must be initialed and dated. To clarify  illegible or uncertain entries, print the 
clarification above the item, then initial and date it.  
 9.2.1. REDCap and origination of electronic source data  
 Contemporaneous medical histories, physical exams, concomitant medications, checklists of consent 
ART-AD, IRB # HSC20 0396H   Page 27 
Version: 2.7  11/08 /[ADDRESS_418979] at the research 
site. Other electronically originated data in REDCap include: AE  assessments and AE logs, enrollment logs, 
protocol deviation logs, and other study management checklists. Other electronic medical record data (VA 
CPRS , UT Health EPIC, University Health System Sunrise ) including pre -existing history, exams, medication 
lists, and such may be accepted as source data.  
 
Missing data will be routinely queried, corrected, and or explained. If a space on the c ase report form is left 
blank because the procedure was not done or the question was not asked, write “N/D .”  If the item is not 
applicable to the individual case, write “N/A .”   
 9.2.2. Paper source data  
 Paper source data will be collected from handwritten subject diaries, pharmacy logs, then entered into the REDCap database. All missing data will be routinely queried, corrected, and or explained.  If a space is left blank on paper because the procedure wa s not done or the question was not asked, write “N/D ,” initialed and 
dated by [CONTACT_20782].  If the item is not applicable to the individual case, write “N/A .”   
 Lab reports originating from medical records will be printed and filed in paper participant files to facilitate 
investigator review. Lab data will be entered to REDCap to facilitate analysis.  Questionnaires and assessments 
(e.g., cognitive assessments verbally administered according to purchased test booklets and copyrighted 
material) may be originated electronically in REDCap. Otherwise, it may be necessary to originate survey data on a paper source and transfer the data elements to REDCap for calculation, data management and analysis. 
Paper sources will be filed in paper subject records . Supervising physician investigators will sign and date paper 
records upon review.  
 
9.2.3. Handwritten entries  
 Handwritten entries will be created contemporaneously to the visit or phone call, and legibly in blue or black 
ink.  Erasures and white -out material are prohibited. If any entry error has been made on paper, to correct such 
an error, draw a single straight line through the incorrect entry and enter the correct data above it. All such changes must be initialed and dated.  To clarify  illegible or uncertain entries, print the clarification above the 
item, then initial and date it.  
 9.3. Data Management  
 All data will be input using a web front -end interface. All users are individually assigned authorization for access 
to specific components of the database application. Information that is input is checked for logical and range consistency and mandatory da ta fields must be entered in order to input a record.  
 
a) Database Management Software : All data collection for this project will be maintained using the UT 
Health San Antonio REDCap platform which is managed by [CONTACT_338923][INVESTIGATOR_69637].  
 
b) Data System: REDCap is a computing environment developed by [CONTACT_338924] a collection of instruments, under the management of UT Health San Antonio’s Information Management systems, policies, and procedures that govern its informatics operations. Data projects are designed to be 
end-user oriented and constructed to optimize workflow and minimize errors.

Dated: 04 September  2020 (Ver. 5.0)   Page [ADDRESS_910201] ( DSMB ) will be established to advise 
the Sponsor on safety and ethical issues of the study.  The DSMB and Study Chair, 
Medical Monitor and Sponsor Representative will be in charge of reviewing safety 
data. The independent DSMB will be comprised of a total of five members with  at least 
three MDs , a biostatistician  and the DSMB chair .  The DSMB  will meet periodically to 
discuss procedures and review unblinded data related to study status and enrollment, 
adverse events, previous/concomitant medications, hematology, blood pressure, 
relapses and the EDSS scores.  All other serious and non -serious adverse events will 
be documented, managed for each subject including review of the safety data by [CONTACT_95946] ’s discretion.  
Information on these meetings will be provided per the DSMB Charter. Statistical analyses  required for planned DSMB meetings  will be prepared and disseminated to 
the DSMB members.  The committee will receive unblinded safety data to allow review 
and assessment by [CONTACT_1570]. In addition, the committee will receive unblinded 
efficacy data to perform benefit /risk ratio assessment. Based on  their reviews and 
analyses of safety and  efficacy data, the committee shall have the right to advise the 
sponsor to stop the study after any meeting.  
 
MS Relapses  During the Study  
Subjects enrolled into the study will be closely monitored through the study course by 
[CONTACT_95947]’s perso nnel as well as by [CONTACT_52880] i ndependent Data Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB) to ensure subjects’ welfare.  
 
Relapses that occur after study drugs are withdrawn will be assessed  over the 
remainder of the study period and this data will be utilized as part of additional 
sensitivity analysis (described in the statistical plan) as long as the subject has not 
withdrawn their consent to be in the trial.  
 
The confirmation of a protocol-defined relapse will be determined by [CONTACT_95948] ( IRAP) . The steps for confirming a relapse are as 
follows:  
 
1. Subject R eported Relapse  
Subjects who experience new or worsening neurologic symptoms are instructed to 
contact [CONTACT_95949] [ADDRESS_910202] reported  relapse will be documented in the  
dedicated page  eCRF  (subject reported) by [CONTACT_95950] . 
 The following should be recorded in the eCRF (subject reported) by [CONTACT_673547] d esignee : 
• Date and time of symptom onset as reported by [CONTACT_423]  
• Symptoms and events reported by [CONTACT_423] (both neurological and non -
neurological) 
• Date of initial contact [CONTACT_95952]  
• Time of initial contact [CONTACT_95953]1101 -RMS302   
Dated: 04 September  2020 (Ver. 5.0)   Page [ADDRESS_910203]  or designee  will document in the eCRF 
the following:  
• Time and date of neurological and physical exam ination  
• Clinical findings of neurological and physical exam ination  
• Review of previously documented concomitant medications and medical 
history  
• Safety assessment, including vital signs, CBC, B -cell count, lymphocyte counts, 
fibrinogen, quantitative immunoglobulin  
 Subjects with suspected clinical relapses reported to the Treating Neurologist or 
designee will be referred to the blinded Examining N eurologist who will  use 
Neurostatus to assess the EDSS independently  of the Treating Neurologist.   
 The Examining Neurologist or designee will document in the eCRF the following:  
• Date and time of assessment  
• EDSS score  
• FS Scores  
 
In addition, subjects may not begin IV  methylprednisolone (IVMP) treatment of a 
relapse until the Examining Neurologist has completed his/her examination.   
Treatment of relapses may proceed at the discretion of the Treating Neurologist 
only after the Examining Neurologist has completed his/her exam. The Treating 
Neurologist will not know the results of the EDSS  assessment . When making 
determination to treat a potential acute relapse the Treating Neurologist can use IVMP 
(1.0 g/day for at least 3 days and can be extended to 5 days) and will not affect the subject eligibility to continue in the study.   
 The subject must re-consent at the time of each IRAP -confirmed or Treating 
Neurologist medically confirmed relapse to continue.  
 
The findings from either the Treating Neurologist and Examining Neurologist will not 
be shared.  The Examining Neurologist must be blinded to the Treating Neurologist’s 
assessment and vice versa. 
 
Following the completion of assessments by [CONTACT_673548].  
 
3. Confirmation of Relapse by [CONTACT_673549], will be sent to an Independent Relapse Adjudication 
Panel (IRAP) . IRAP adjudicates each case based on all available data provided for that 
case and members are not permitted to contact [CONTACT_673550]1101 -RMS302   
Dated: 04 September  2020 (Ver. 5.0)   Page [ADDRESS_910204] be confirmed by [CONTACT_95954], based on the neurological 
assessments performed independently by [CONTACT_95955]/or Examining Neurologist 
by [CONTACT_95956]:  
 
• ≥ [ADDRESS_910205] the selected FS (i.e., pyramidal, ambula tion, cerebellar, brainstem, sensory or visual).  Note, the change in FS 
scores should correspond to the patient’s symptoms (e.g. , patient reported 
change in visual acuity should correspond to a change in the vision FS score).  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_95907], sexual dysfunction, fatigue, mood change or bladder or bowel 
urgency or incontinence will not suffice to establish a relapse ; 
• An increase of ≥0 .5 points in the EDSS score (unless EDSS score = 0, then an 
increase of at least 1.0 points is required) from the previous clinically stable 
assessment.  
 
MS relapses are defined  as a new or worsening neurological symptoms lasting 
≥[ADDRESS_910206] is ≥ 0.5 increase or ≥ [ADDRESS_910207] the selected FS (i.e., pyramidal , ambulation, cerebellar, brainstem, sensory 
or visual).  Note, the change in FS scale scores should correspond to the patient’s 
symptoms (e.g. , patient reported change in visual acuity should correspond to a 
change in the vision FS score).  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_95907] , sexual dysfunction, fatigue, mood 
change or bladder or bowel urgency or incontinence will not suffice to establish a 
relapse.  Please note: sexual dysfunction and fatigue will not be scored.  If the symptoms occur less than [ADDRESS_910208] be reviewed and confirmed by [CONTACT_95954]; Appendix D.  The 
IRAP will then notify the CRO and Treating Neurologist of the results of its review.  
Treating Neurologist/ designee  will enter into the eCRF whether the neurological 
symptoms identified were a result of a n IRAP- confirmed relapse.  
IRAP- confirmed relaps es are the sole confirmation of a protocol -defined relapse . 
However , for instances where IRAP -confirmed relapses may not be feasible, 
provisions are provided within Section 4.4.2 ( Treating Neurologist  medically 
confirmed relapse).  
The subject must re -consent at the time of each IRAP -confirmed  or  Treating 
Neurologist medically confirmed relapse to continue.  
 
Signing the informed consent form for re -consent (if the subject  has a confirmed 
relapse), to proceed with the study at the next scheduled office visit  should be within 
[ADDRESS_910209] reporting  of relapse.

Dated: 04 September  2020 (Ver. 5.0)   Page 10 of 140   
Re-consent criteria  after relapse  
In case of a n IRAP -confirmed MS relapse (as defined in the protocol, Appendix C) or 
Treating Neurologist  medically confirmed relapse during the study, the following 
actions will be taken:  
• The subject will be reminded of the current approved MS medications/treatments 
and the opportunity to terminate the study and be treated with an approved MS 
medication.  
• The subject will be requested to re- sign an informed consent form  within [ADDRESS_910210] reporting of the suspected relapse if he/she chooses to continue to 
participate in the study, in the same treatment assignment.  
 
Disability Progression  
The method of disability progression calculation will be different than that of the 
relapse confi rmation. The EDSS score will be used to assess disability progression . 
EDSS assessment  will be  performed by [CONTACT_95957] . The Examining 
Neurologist  must not  share the EDSS score with the Treating Neurologist. T he EDSS 
assessment  for disability  progression  will be performed at screening and on Week 1  
Day 1 (prior to randomization) and Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, [ADDRESS_910211] (disability 
progression is a  post hoc  analysis  based on the EDSS scores ). 
 
Disability progression is defined as an increase of ≥1.0 point from the baseline EDSS 
score that is not attributable to another etiology (e.g., fever, concurrent illness, or concomitant medication) when the ba seline score is 5.5 or less, and ≥0.[ADDRESS_910212] 12 or 24 weeks 
after the initial documentation of neurological worsening.

Versio n 2.0 (dated 7 June 2017) is the first amendment to this protocol and contains the following updates:  
• A sentence was added to include additional analysis of relapses from a more specific timeframe. The sentence 
reads as follows: “ Relapses that occur after study drugs are withdrawn will be assessed over the remainder 
of the study period and this data will be utilized as part of additional sensitivity analysis (described in the statistical plan) as long as the subject has not withdrawn their consent to be in the trial.”,  
• The interface between IRAP and the study sites have been updated to as follows: “IRAP adjudicates each case based on all available data provided for that case and members are not permitted to contact [CONTACT_673551].”,  
• The change in EDSS score for defining progression of disability has been updated to state as follows: “…if a subject experiences at least 1.0 point increase on the EDSS when a baseline score is < 5.5…”,  
• The assessment tables now stipulates EDSS must be assessed 1 day prior to randomization,  
• Intent to treat definition was updated in the body of the protocol  
• Now included is a hierarchy analysis, sensitivity analysis for secondary endpoints and subjects who  
withdraw from study  
• The timeframe of relapse assessment was further defined  
• Interim sample size reassessment for relapses was further defined  
• Minor typographical errors  
Version 2.1 (dated 26 July 2017) is the second amendment to this protocol and contai ns the following updates:  
• Endpoints are now numbered instead of bulleted  
• Examining and Treating Neurologists will act independently. Any scores from evaluations performed by 
[CONTACT_95959].  
Version 3.0 (dat ed [ADDRESS_910221] 2017) is the third amendment to this protocol and contains the following updates:  
• Include information regarding a new vial size for ublituximab  
• Update Section s [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS]  to reflect changes in adverse events as reported in the revised  
Investigator Brochure (Version 5.0; dated [ADDRESS_910222] 2017 ) 
• Minor typographical errors  
Version 3.1 (dated 20 October  2017) is the fourth amendment to this protocol and contains the following updates:  
• Minor administrative updates and typographical errors were corrected throughout

1.1 BACKGROUND  
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS).  
Although it can occur at any age, it is often seen in young adults between the ages of [ADDRESS_910230] been diagnosed with the disease.[1]  Pr ior to 2014 , MS ha d 
been classified into four clinical subtypes: relapsing -remitting MS (RRMS), secondary progressive MS (SPMS), 
primary progressive MS (PPMS) and progressive relapsing MS (PRMS). [2]  In 2014, the International Advisory 
Committee on Clinical Trials of MS revised the MS phenotypes to the following disease modifier phenotypes: 
Clinically Isolated S yndrome (CIS; not active or acti ve), RMS (not active or active), progressive disease (active and 
with progression; active but without progression; not active with progression; not active and without 
progression). [3]  The progression, severity and specific symptoms of MS vary amongst each  subjects  and are 
unpredictable.  Since 1993, twelve disease modifying therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (DMTs) have been approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA) to treat MS.  These include 7 injectable  agents , 3 orals and 3 infusions.  The main target in the 
majority of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_95910] T cells.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_95911] 65% [4] and slowing the progression of the disease, subjects  continue to experience disease relapses and 
progression.  Furthermore, some of the T cell directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_95912].  Recent immunopathologic and clinical studies have demonstrated that B cells also play a central role in the pathogenesis of the disease, perhaps upstream of the T cell mediated pathology .  As such, targeting 
aberrant autoimmune activity in B cells in MS may represent the next leap forward in treating MS.   Phase [ADDRESS_910231] generation chimeric anti -CD20 monoclonal antibody bioengineered for potent activity, 
exhibiting a unique glycosylation profile with a low fucose content, designed to introduce superior antibody -
dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC).  Ublituximab has maintained competitive complement -dependent cytotoxicity 
(CDC) and has also demonstrated to induce programmed cell death (PCD) upon binding to the CD20 antigen on B -
lymphocytes.  Ublituximab  has a unique protein sequence, and targets epi[INVESTIGATOR_95913]20 not targeted by [CONTACT_95961], both currently approved anti -CD20 antibodies in oncologic diseases and rheumatoid arthritis 
(rituximab only).  
 PRE -CLINICAL EVALUATIONS OF UBLITUXIMAB  
[IP_ADDRESS] IN V ITRO ACTIVITY  
In an in- vitro assay using B -CLL cells from subject  donors, ublituximab demonstrated an enhanced ability to kill CLL 
cells compared to rituximab.  Ublituximab demonstrated improved Fcγ receptor IIIA (FcγRIIIA)/CD16 binding and 
FcγRIIIA depen dent effector functions compared to rituximab.  Additionally, ublituximab induced higher ADCC 
against CLL cells, and a higher FcγRIIIA mediated interleukin  (IL)-2 production by [CONTACT_95962]γRIIIA+ Jurkat cells (5).  
Ublituximab demonstrated high ADCC against both subject -derived CLL cells and NHL cell lines. Against the NHL cell 
line Ramos, ublituximab was observed to inhibit the constitutively active NF -κB survival pathway and  induce the 
expression of PTEN along with inhibition of the PI3K -AKT pathway.  Ublituximab also induced the expression of pro -
apoptotic factors, sensitizing Ramos cells to TRAIL mediated  apoptosis (6).  

TG1101 -RMS302   
Dated: 04 September  2020 (Ver. 5.0)   Page 30 of 140  [IP_ADDRESS] IN VIVO ACTIVITY  
The antitumor effect of ublituximab was compared to that of rituximab with chemotherapy in follicular lymphoma 
(FL), and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) xenograft murine models.  Single agent ublituximab demonstrated dose -
related anti -tumor acti vity with 100% tumor growth inhibition in the FL xenograft at a dose of 100  mg/kg, and a 
superior tumor growth delay (21 days) compared to rituximab. Ublituximab also demonstrated superior anti- tumor 
activity compared to rituximab against MCL xenografts at  all dose levels ( 7).  
[IP_ADDRESS] TOXICOLOGY  
In single -dose and repeat dose toxicology studies perform ed under GLP, ublituximab displayed a safety profile 
similar to what might be expected for anti -CD20 monoclonal antibodies. Single administration of up to 100 mg/kg 
ublituximab in cynomolgus monkeys was well tolerated, with no local irritation with intrave nous administration.  
Genotoxicity studies (Ames test) showed that ublituximab was not mutagenic.  Monkeys that received a single injection of 0.3 mg/kg of ublituximab developed an anti -ublituximab response, whereas anti -ublituximab antibodies 
were not detected in the animals which received 10 or 100 mg/kg (see Ublituximab Investigator Brochure).  
 CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT OF UBLITUXIMAB  
[IP_ADDRESS] PHARMACOKINETICS  
After infusion of ublituximab (previously known as LFB -R603) at [ADDRESS_910232] to dose (450 mg vs . 150 mg) and time ( Week 
4 vs . Week 8); and more than proportional increase of Cmax and AUC∞ due to a clearance decrease.  The volume of 
distribution at steady state was small (~5 L), approximately equal to blood volume.  This non -linear 
pharmacokinetics  may be explained by [CONTACT_673552], with a large component of target-
mediated elimination after the first dose that is decreased after subsequent infusions due to a reduction in the available target.  However, limited data for each dose level cohort and considerable variability in baseline subject  
characteristics, particularly in terms of tumor burden, make firm conclusions difficult.  
The linear mean serum concentration -times profile after the first, the fourth and the eight infusion of ublituximab 
are presented in Figure 1.  A s ummary of non -compartmental PK parameters after the first, the fourth and the eighth 
infusion of ub lituximab are presented in Table 2.

Dated: 04 September  2020 (Ver. 5.0)   Page 32 of 140  compared to placebo at 24 weeks.  More recently, ocrelizumab demonstrated promising results in its 2 Phase III 
trials (OPERA I and OPERA II)  [20] .  In OPERA I and II, subjects  treated with ocrelizumab had significantly lower 
Annualized Relapse Rates (0.156 and 0.155, respectively) compared to subjects treated with IFNβ -1a, 44µg (0.292 
and 0.29, respectively).  Further, in OPERA I and II, subjects treated with ocrelizumab had approximately 46% 
reduction in  ARR as  compared to those treated with IFNβ -1a 44μg ; TG Therapeutics is powering this study for a 40% 
reduction in ARR. [14]  
 RATIONALE FOR THE T RIAL  
Ublituximab  has been studied extensively in the treatment of B- cell malignancies and has been shown to be a potent 
B-cell depleting agent.  Based on the success of other CD20s in the treatment of RMS, ublituximab is being studied in 
RMS.  
TG Therapeutics has performed a phase 2a clinical trial using ublituximab as a single agent to examine the level of B cell depletion by [CONTACT_95964].  Based on the results of the Phase 2a study with a dosing of 150 mg (infused for 4 hours) on Week 1 Day  1 
and a dosing of 450 mg (infused for 1 hour) on Week 3 Day 15, a median of >9 9% B cell depletion was achieved on 
Week 4 and sustained until Week 24.  The dosing regimen was well tolerated by [CONTACT_95965] I nfusion Related 
Reactions (grade 1 and 2) being the commonly reported adverse event.  
TG Therapeutics also performed a phase  1 clinical study using ublituximab as a single agent to examine the safety 
and tolerability of a single dose ublituximab at 450  mg in subjects diagnosed with acute N euromyelitis Optica 
relapse.  Although the single dose of 450 mg ublituximab infused for 4  hours was safe and well tolerated, the study 
demonstrated that after 3 months, B cells started to replete after being deplete for >99% upon the initial 
administration of ublituximab on Week [ADDRESS_910233] generation anti -CD20s due to its glycoengineering, we believe we may be able to optimize the 
therapeutic window and/or safely decrease infusion times, offering subjects  comparable efficacy with a more 
convenient infusion.

3.3 DISCONTINUATION FROM STUDY  TREATMENT 
Subjects  will be discontinued  from trial treatment or withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons:  
• Irreversible or intolerable toxicity or abnormal laboratory values thought to be related to drug toxicity  
• Subject  requests to withdraw consent or discontinue treatment  
• Pregnancy (see Section 3.3.1)  
• Inability of the subject  to comply with trial requirements  
• Conditions requiring therapeutic intervention not permitted by [CONTACT_760]  
• Inter -current illness (this will be at the Principal I nvestigator and/or Treating Neurologist discretion)  
• Malignancy  
• Discontinuation of the study by [CONTACT_95967]  (other than those who withdraw consent  and refuse to 
enter into the 20 week Follow -up Period ) should  undergo an accelerated teriflunomide elimination procedure with 
either oral cholestyramine or oral activated charcoal and be followed for safety  for [ADDRESS_910240] dose of 
ublituximab /oral placebo  or teriflunomide /IV placebo .  All new AEs occurr ing during this period must be reported 
and followed until resolution, unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_95918]/or Treating Neurologist , these values are not likely 
to improve because of the underlying disease.  In this case the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or Treating Neurologist must record his or her 
reasoning for this decision in the subjects ’ medical records and as a comment on the electronic Case Report Form 
(eCRF).  
All subjects who have Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE;  Ver 4.03)  grade [ADDRESS_910241] returned to grade 1 or 2, unless it is, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_95918]/or Treating Neurologist, not likely that th ese 
values are to improve because of the underlying disease.  In this case, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_95919]’ medical records and as a comment on the eCRF.  
Any subject that withdraw s their consent to participate in the study will have all data collection stop on that day and 
will not be followed -up on. These subjects, however, could be followed further if they agree to  sign  the Early 
Termination ICF  and enter the 20 week Follow -up Perio d. 
 PREGNANCY  
During the course of the trial, all female subjects  of childbearing potential (the definitions of “women of childbearing 
potential” are listed in Appendix A ) must contact [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or Treating Neurologist  immediately if they suspect that 
they may be pregnant (a missed or late menstrual period should also be reported to the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or Treating 
Neurologist ).   

TG1101 -RMS302   
Dated: 04 September  2020 (Ver. 5.0)   Page [ADDRESS_910242] should be informed of the potential teratogenic 
effects, therefore consideration to withhold further teriflunomide/oral placebo dosing shoul d be made and follow -
up appointment should be scheduled as soon as possible where a serum pregnancy test will be performed for 
confirmation.  
If a pregnancy is confirmed  via serum pregnancy test , the trial drugs must be stopped immediately and permanently . 
The subject will complete the Withdrawal from Treatment Visit as soon as possible and will then enter the 20-week 
Follow- up Period  inclusive of accelerated teriflunomide elimination procedure with either oral cholestyramine or 
oral activated charcoal.  The  subject will be expected to complete the full Follow -up Period regardless of the outcome 
of the pregnancy.  T he investigator must record the pregnancy on a Pregnancy Report Form within 24 hours of

 TREATING N EUROLOGIST 
The Treating Neurologist  will be responsible for subject s’ care, eligibility evaluation, supervision of study  medication 
administration, recording and treating of adverse events, serious adverse event s and assessing and treating of MS 
relapses, performing neurological examinations and  monitoring of safety assessments, including routine laboratory 
results and concomitant  medications. The Treating Neurologist will provide no information to the Examining 
Neurologist. The MSFC and SDMT assessments may be performed by [CONTACT_95970], or may be delegated 
to another qualified team member, but must not be performed by [CONTACT_95957].  The Treating 
Neurologist  (who does not perform the E DSS assessment) , other investigative site staff  and subject  should not have 
access to Examining Neurologist ’s EDSS score s. It is encouraged that  the same physician maintain the role of Treating 
Neurologist  for a given subject  throughout the study.    
 EXAMIN ING N EUROLOGIST (EVALUATING NEUROLOGIST)  
The Examining Neurologist (EDSS Rater) will be responsible for conducting and documenting all EDSS assessments.  
The Examining Neurologist will not share the findings of the EDSS assessment when evaluating relapses with the 
Treating Neurologist. The Examining Neurologist  must possess current EDSS rater certification (Level C) .  
Throughout the study, the Examining Neu rologist  is blinded to all subject information collected by [CONTACT_95971], concomitant medications, laboratory results, and any clinical MS 
examination for enrolled subjects . Additional ly, the Examining Neurologist  should not have access to  any prior EDSS 
scores  from any time throughout the study  or any clinical information when performing their examination.  
 The Examining Neurologist will also be responsible for entering the EDSS assessment data into the electronic Case 
Report Form (eCRF). The entry of EDSS assessment data into eCRF may be delegated to another staff member, provided that the staff member has been trained in the eCRF, maintains the same level of blinding as that of the 
Examining Neurologist  and is not involved in any other study- related activities, other than EDSS  assessments .

 MS RELAPSE D URING THE S TUDY  
MS Relapses  During the Study  
Subjects enrolled into the study will be closely monitored through the study cours e by [CONTACT_95947]’s 
perso nnel as well as by [CONTACT_95975] M onitoring Board (DSMB) to ensure subjects’ welfare.  
 Relapses that occur after study drugs are withdrawn will be assessed over the remainder of the study period and this data will be utilized as part of additional sensitivity analysis (described in the statistical plan) as long as the 
subject has not withdrawn their consent to be in the trial.  
 
The confirmation of a protocol -defined relapse will be determined by [CONTACT_95976] (IRAP) . The steps for confirming a relapse are as follows:  
 
1. Subject Reported Relapse  
Subjects who experience new or worsening neurologic symptoms are instructed to contact [CONTACT_95977] [ADDRESS_910249] reported relapse will be documented 
in the dedicated page eCRF (subject reported) by [CONTACT_95978] . 
 
The following should be recorded in the eCRF (subject reported) by [CONTACT_95979] : 
• Date and time of symptom onset as reported by [CONTACT_423]  
• Symptoms and events reported by [CONTACT_423] (both neurological and non -neurological) 
• Date of initial contact [CONTACT_95952]  
• Time of initial contact [CONTACT_95980] [ADDRESS_910250]  
 

TG1101 -RMS302   
Dated: 04 September  2020 (Ver. 5.0)   Page [ADDRESS_910251]  or designee  will document in the eCRF the following:  
• Time and date of neurological and physical exam ination  
• Clinical findings of neurological and physical exam ination  
• Review of previously documented concomitant medications and medical history  
• Safety assessment, including vital signs, CBC, B -cell count, lymphocyte counts, fibrinogen, quantitative 
immunoglobulin  
 
Subjects with suspected clinical relapses reported to the Treating Neurologist or designee will be referred to the 
blinded Examining Neurologist who will  use Neurostatus to  assess the EDSS independently of the Treating 
Neurologist.   
 
The Examining Neuro logist or designee will document in the eCRF the following:  
• Date and time of assessment  
• EDSS score  
• FS Scores  
 
In addition, subjects may not begin IV  methylprednisolone (IVMP) treatment of a relapse until the Examining 
Neurologist has completed his/her examination.   
Treatment of relapses may proceed at the discretion of the Treating Neurologist only after the Examining 
Neurologist has completed his/her exam. The Treating Neurol ogist will not know the results of the EDSS  
assessment . When making determination to treat a potential acute relapse the Treating Neurologist can use IVMP 
(1.0 g/day for at least 3 days and can be extended to 5 days) and will not affect the subject eligibility to continue in 
the study.   
 
The subject must re -consent at the time of each IRAP -confirmed or  Treating Neurologist medically 
confirmed relapse  to continue.  
 The findings from either the Treating Neurologist and Examining Neurologist will not be shared.  The Examining 
Neurologist must be blinded to the Treating Neurologist’s assessment and vice versa.  
 
Following the completion of assessments by [CONTACT_95981].  
 
3. Confirmation of Relapse by [CONTACT_95982], 
will be sent to an  Independent Relapse Adjudication Panel (IRAP). IRAP adjudicates each case based on all available 
data provided for that case and members are not permitted to contact [CONTACT_95983]. The IRAP will, in turn, make the final determination of whether the neurological events meet the criteria 
for a protocol -defined relapse.  
 
Each epi[INVESTIGATOR_95923], based on the neurological assessments performed by [CONTACT_95955]/or Examining Neurologist independently by [CONTACT_95956]:  
 
• ≥ [ADDRESS_910252] the selected FS (i.e., pyramidal, ambulation, cerebellar, brainstem, sensory or visual).   Note, the 
change in FS scores should correspond to the patient’s symptoms (e.g. , patient reported change in visual 
acuity should correspond to a change in the vision FS score).  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_95907], sexual dysfunction, fatigue, 
mood change or bladder or bowel urgency or incontinence will not suffice to establish a relapse ; 
• An increase of ≥0.5 points in the EDSS score (unless EDSS score = 0, then an increase of at least 1.0 points is 
required) f rom the previous clinically stable assessment.  

TG1101 -RMS302

MS relapses are defined as a new or worsening neurological symptoms lasting ≥[ADDRESS_910253] 
is ≥ 0.5 increase or ≥ [ADDRESS_910254] the selected FS (i.e. , pyramidal, ambulation, cerebellar, brainstem, sensory or visual).  Note, 
the change in FS scale scores should corre spond to the patient’s symptoms  (e.g. , patient reported change in visual 
acuity should correspond to a change in the vision FS score).   Epi[INVESTIGATOR_95907], sexual dysfunction, fatigue, mood 
change or b ladder or bowel urgency or incontinence will not suffice t o establish a relapse.  Please note: sexual 
dysfunction and fatigue will not be scored.  If the symptoms occur less than [ADDRESS_910255] be reviewed and confirmed by [CONTACT_95954]; Appendix D. The IRAP will then notify the CRO 
and Treating Neurologist of the results of its review.  
Treating Neurologist  or designee  will enter into the eCRF whether the neurological symptoms identified were a 
result of a n IRAP- confirmed relapse.  
IRAP- confirmed relapses are the sole confirmation of a protocol -defined relapse. However, for instances where 
IRAP- confirmed relapses may not  be feasible, provisions are provided within Section 4.4.2 (Treating Neurologist 
medically confirmed relapse).  
The subject must re-consent at the time of each IRAP -confirmed or Treating Neurologist medically 
confirmed relapse to continue. 
 
Signing the inf ormed consent form for re -consent (if the subject  has a confirmed relapse), to proceed with the study 
at the next scheduled office visit should be within [ADDRESS_910256] MEDICALLY CONFIRMED RELAPSE  
In suspected relapse events for which IRAP confirmation is pending, may not be logistically possible , and/or 
complete case profile s for IRAP review are not available, the Treating Neurologist will medically evaluate the 
suspected relapse event.   In these cases, all information from the Treating Neurologist’s medical evaluation should 
still be entered into the eCRF and provided to the IRAP for adjudication .  This is to ensure each suspected relapse is 
documented.   Treating Neurologist medically confirmed re lapses will not be included in the ARR calculation for the 
primary endpoint.  For any relapse that is Treating Neurologist  medically confirmed, subjects should re -consent to 
continue participation in the trial.   
 RE-CONSENT CRITERIA AFTER RELAPSING 
If a relapse is confirmed by [CONTACT_95984]/ or deemed a Treating Neurologist  medically  confirmed  relapse , the following 
actions will be taken:  
• The subject will be reminded of the current approved MS medications/treatments and the opportunity to 
terminate the study and be treated with an approved MS medication.  
• The subject will be requested to re -sign an informed consent form within [ADDRESS_910257] reporting of the 
suspected relapse if he/she chooses to continue to participate in the study, in the same treatment assi gnment.

 ASSESSMENT OF R ELAPSE  
MS Relapses  During the Study  
Subjects enrolled into the study will be closely monitored through the study course by [CONTACT_95990]’s perso nnel as well as by [CONTACT_52880] i ndependent Data Safety M onitoring Board (DSMB) to 
ensure subjects’ welfare.  
 
Relapses that occur after study drugs are withdrawn will be assessed over the remainder of the 
study period and this data will be utilized as part of additional sensitivity analysis (described in 
the statistical plan) as long as the subject has not withdrawn their consent to be in the trial.  
 
The confirmation of a protocol- defined relapse will be determined by [CONTACT_95991] ( IRAP) . The steps for confirming a relapse are as follows:  
 
1. Subject Reported Relapse  
Subjects who experience new or worsening neurologic symptoms are instructed to cont act the 
Treating Neurologist within 48 hours of symptom onset. All new or worsening neurological events, 

TG1101 -RMS302    
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page [ADDRESS_910275]; the time and date of suspected subject reported relapse will be documented in 
the dedicated page eCRF (subject reported) by [CONTACT_95978] . 
 The following should be recorded in the eCRF (subject reported) by [CONTACT_95992] : 
• Date and time of symptom onset as reported by [CONTACT_423]  
• Symptoms and events reported by [CONTACT_423] (both neurological and non -neurological) 
• Date of initial contact [CONTACT_95952]  
• Time of initial contact [CONTACT_95952] . 
 
Within [ADDRESS_910276] or designee will document in the eCRF the following:  
• Time and date of neurological and physical exam ination  
• Clinical findings of neurological and physical exam ination  
• Review of previously documented concomitant medications and medical history  
• Safety assessment, including vital signs, CBC, B -cell count, lymphocyte counts, fibrinogen, 
quantitative immunoglobulin .  
 
Subject s with suspected clinical relapses reported to the Treating Neurologist or designee will be 
referred to the blinded Examining Neurologist who will use Neurostatus to  assess the EDSS 
independently of the Treating Neurologist.   
 
The Examining Neurologist or  designee will document in the eCRF the following:  
• Date and time of assessment  
• EDSS score  
• FS Scores . 
 In addition, subjects may not begin IV  methylprednisolone (IVMP) treatment of a relapse until the 
Examining Neurologist has completed his/her examination .  
 Treatment of relapses may proceed at the discretion of the Treating Neurologist only after the 
Examining Neurologist has completed his/her exam. The Treating Neurologist will not know 
the results of the EDSS assessment . When making determination to tre at a potential acute relapse 
the Treating Neurologist can use IVMP (1.0 g/day for at least 3 days and can be extended to 5 days) 
and will not affect the subject eligibility to continue in the study.   
 
The subject must re -consent at the time of each IRAP -confirmed or Treating Neurologist

case based on all available data provided for that case and members are not permitted to contact [CONTACT_95993].   The IRAP will, in turn, make the final determination 
of whether the neurological events meet the criteria for a protocol -defined relapse.

vision FS score).  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_95907], sexual dysfunction, fatigue, mood change or b ladder or 
bowel urgency or incontinence will not suffice to establish a relapse ; 
• An increase of ≥0.5 points in the EDSS score (unless EDSS score = 0, then an increase of at 
least 1.0 points is required) from the previous clinically stable assessment.

than [ADDRESS_910281] be reviewed and confirmed by [CONTACT_95954]; Appendix D. The IRAP will then 
notify the CRO and Treating Neurologist of the results of its review.  
Treating Neurologist/ designee  will enter into the eCRF whether the neurological symptoms 
identified were a result of a n IRAP -confirmed relapse.  
IRAP- confirmed relapses are the sole confirmation of a protocol -defined relapse. However, for 
instances where IRAP -confirmed relapses may not  be feasible, provisions are provided within 
Section 4.4.2 (Treating Neurologist medically confirmed relapse).

Signing the informed consent form for re -consent (if the subject  has a confirmed relapse), to proceed 
with the study at the next scheduled office visit should be within [ADDRESS_910283]  Medically Reported Relapse  
In suspected relapse events for which IRAP confirmation is pending, may not be logistically possible 
and/or complete case profiles for IRAP review are not available, the Treating Neurologist will 
medically evaluate the relapse event .  In these cases, all information from the Treating Neurologist’s 
medical evaluation should still be entered into the eCRF and provided to the IRAP for adjudication.  
This is to ensure each suspected relapse is documented.   Treating Neurologist medica lly confirmed 
relapses will not be included in the ARR  calculation for the primary endpoint.  
For any relapse that is Treating Neurologist  medically confirmed, subjects should re -consent to 
continue participation in the trial.  
Re-consent criteria  
In case of an IRAP -confirmed relapse (as defined in the protocol, Appendix C) or  Treating Neurologist  
medically confirmed relapse  during the study, the following actions will be taken:  
• The subject will be reminded of the current approved MS medications/treatments and the 
opportunity to terminate the study and be treated with an approved MS medication.  
• The subject will be requested to re- sign an informed consent form within [ADDRESS_910284] 
reporting of the suspected relapse if he/she chooses to continue to p articipate in the study, in the 
same treatment assignment.  
 
Re-consenting may occur at the next scheduled office visit, but may require an unscheduled visit if 
the relapse occurs between Weeks 24 and 96 (where the frequency of scheduled visits is every 12 
weeks).  
 DISABILITY  EVALUATION  
Disability Progression  
The method of disability progression calculation will be different than that of the relapsed 
confirmation. The EDSS score  will be  used to assess disability progression . EDSS assessment will be  
performed by [CONTACT_95957] . The Examining Neurologist  must not share  the EDSS score  
with the Treating Neurologist. The EDSS assessment for disability progression  will be performed at 
screening and on Week 1 Day 1 (prior to randomization) and Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, [ADDRESS_910285] neurological examination, incorporating the following function 
systems ( pyramidal, cerebellar, brainstem, sensory, bowel and bladder, visual, and cerebral) and 
ambulation rated and scores as function system scores (FS).   Each FS score is an ordinal clinical rating 
scale ranging from 0 to 5 or 6.  These ratings are then used in conjunction with observations and 
information con cerning ambulation and used of assistive devices to determine the EDSS score.   The 
EDSS is a disability scale that ranges in 0.5 -point steps from 0 (normal) to 10 (death).

Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page [ADDRESS_910286] and is documented  before treatment is assigned.  
Disability progression can only be assessed from the EDSS scores performed at baseline and on Week 
1 Day 1 and Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84 and 96.  
 
Disability progressio n is defined as an increase of ≥1.0 point from the baseline EDSS score that is not 
attributable to another etiology (e.g., fever, concurrent illness, or concomitant medication) when the 
baseline score is 5.5 or less, and ≥0.[ADDRESS_910287] 12 or  24 weeks after the initial documentation of neurological 
worsening.   
 
 RADIOLOGICAL EVALUATION  
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a useful tool for monitoring CNS lesions in MS.  Different MRI 
derived parameters  have been related to clinical activity and T1 weighted  gadolinium- enhancing 
lesions or new and/or enlarging hyperintense T2 lesions have been related to relapses.  It is hypothesized that changes in brain volume may reflect brain atrophy as a result of MS -related tissue 
loss and may thereby [CONTACT_95995] -term clinical outcomes in RMS subjects.  
Brain MRI scans will be obtained in all subjects as detailed in the Schedule of Assessments in S ection 
6. In addition, brain MRI scans will be obtained in subjects who had withdrawn from the trial.  Scans 
will be performed by [CONTACT_95996].   
Assessment of effect on Gd enhan cing lesion and new , enlarging T2 lesions, brain volume, T1 
hypointense  will be evaluated as outlined in the schedule of events  by a central reader.  The following 
time windows apply:  
• “Baseline” MRI should be performed after informed consent is obtained , but preferably 10 days 
prior to the Week  1 Day 1  visit.  
• MRI a re scheduled as follows:  Weeks 12  (+/- 7 days) , 24 (pre -dose; - 7 days), 48  (pre -dose; - 7 
days)  and 96 (+/- 7 days)   
• MRI scans may be performed on the day of withdrawal or  within [ADDRESS_910288] enhancement.  

TG1101 -RMS302    
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 63 of 140 
 MRI scans will be read by a central ized reading center located in Montreal, Canada for efficacy 
endpoints.  The centralized reading center is blinded to the treatment assignment and the reading is 
performed in the absence of clinical information.  Additional details on scanning acquisition sequences, methods, handling and transmission of the scans, certification of site MRI 
radiologists/technicians, and the procedure for the blinded  analysis of the scans at the central 
reading center will be described in a separate MRI Manual.  
All MRI scans will also be reviewed locally by a radiologist for safety (identify any new clinical 
relevant abnormal MRI findings that are not consistent with the diagnosis of MS, with particular attention to the possibility of progressive multifocal leuko encephalopathy) and the MRI report  will 
be provided to the Treating Neurologist /PI.  After randomization, the MRI reports provided to the 
Treating Neurologist/PI [INVESTIGATOR_95925] -MS pathology .  At the investigational site, only the 
local radiologist/ technician assigned to this study may have access to the MRI scan  post -
randomization ; the Treating Neurologist should not review the MRI scans unless a safety 
concern arises .   
 NEUROLOGICAL EVALUATION  
Assessment of effect on relapse rate will be evaluated as outlined in the schedule of events  (see Study 
Evaluation Tables 5, 6, and 7 and Appendix F ).  EDSS score will be calculated  via Neuro status as stated 
in Sections 6.3.1. and 6.3.2. 
Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite  (MSFC) score will be assessed as outline d in the schedule of 
events (see Study Evaluation Tables 5, 6, and 7 and Appendix F ).  The MSFC consists of three 
subscales, including the [ADDRESS_910289] (PASAT) and T imed 25 -
Foot Walk (T25FW), which provide a global quantitative estimate of MS progression. The MSFC 
assessments may be performed by [CONTACT_95970], or may be delegated to another qualified 
team member, but must not be performed by [CONTACT_95957] .

 COGNITION ASSESSMENT  
The Symbol Digit Modality Test (SDMT) has demonstrated sensitivity in detecting not only the presence of cognitive impairment, but also changes in cognitive functioning over time and in 
response to treatment.  The SDMT is brief, easy to administer verbally and  involves a simple 
substitution task that normal ch ildren and adults can perform.  Using a reference key, the examinee

TG1101 -RMS302    
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 66 of 140 
 Subjects may be re -screened under the following conditions:  
 
• After a relapse recovery (see Section 4.4.1 ) and upon re -consent  
• Varicella titer does not indicate immunity at initial screening and subject is re -immunized 
(see Section 3.2)  
• He/she, at initial screening, is not eligible to participate in the study based on 
inclusion/exclusion criteria ( Sections 3.1 and 3.2) and wishes to re -assess eligibility after a 
waiting period deemed sufficient by [CONTACT_6962].  
• The subject was determined  eligible, but [ADDRESS_910300] infusion ( Week 1 Day 1).  
 Re-screening procedures are identical to initial screening procedures (Appendix F ), but with the 
following modifications:  
• Medical history does not need to be taken again.  
• Screening MRI may not  need to  be repeated  if there was one obtained within 30 days  prior to 
this screening  
6.10  END OF S TUDY FOLLOW -UP 
After early termination of trial or at the end of study visit at Week 96, subjects will enter a 20 -week  
Follow- up Period inclusive of the accelerated elimination of teriflunomide .  The 11 -day elimination 
procedure will commence at Week 100 for all subjects who completed all study visits including Week 
96.  For those subjects who had terminated early (discontinued or withdrawn from the study), the 11-day elimination procedure will commence  the day after the Early Withdrawal from Treatment 
Visit.  The follow up period  will include  visits at W eeks [ADDRESS_910301]. If he/she elects not to participate in the 20 -week  Follow -up inclusive of the  
accelerated teriflunomide elimination procedure , after w ithdrawing consent and after discussion 
with the site, it should be documented in the eCRF.  
 
For subjects who will participate in the 20 -week Follow- up Period inclusive of the accelerated 
teriflunomide elimination procedure after withdrawing consent for this study, a new consent form 
to participate in the 20 -week Follow- up Period inclusive of the accelerated teriflunomide elimination 
procedure will need to be signed. If he/she re -consents, the sites will complete the eCRF for Weeks 
100, 104, 108, 112, and 116 , accordingly .  
 The purpose of this follow -up is to monitor safety and relapses after the discontinuation of study 
medications and to eliminate residual teriflunomide  from the study subjects.  Because blinding is 
maintained until the data from the treatment period (through Week 96)  is locked , all subjects will 
undergo the accelerated teriflunomide elimination procedure regardless of whether they were 
randomized to ublituximab /oral placebo  or teriflunomide /IV placebo .  Study subjects that enter the 
Follow- up Period  of TG1101 -RMS302 (post -Week 96 to Week 116) are not allowed to receive DMTs.  
Please refer to the exclusion criteria of the protocol for a list of MS therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (Section 3.2).  It should be noted that u se of systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of a relapse  is allowed .  Whe n deciding

7.3 ORDERING STUDY MEDICATIONS  
Once the clinical trial site receives both IRB/ EC and Regulatory Authorities  approval, the Sponsor’s 
or its designee will  perform the Site Initiation Visit and inspection of pharmacy. Following completion 
of these tasks the site can then be officially open  and an automatic shipment of pre- determined 
quantity of all study medication  (ublituximab, teriflunomide, IV placebo and oral placebo ) and 
treatment supplies (i.e., normal saline, infusion kit, cholestyramine, activated charcoal)  will be 
shipped to the clinical trial site , accordingly .  A separate Drug Distribution Plan will detail country 
variances and specifics.  
Upon receipt of study m edication and treatment supplies, the Pharmacist or the appropriate person 
of the site should update the accountability forms.  
If any abnormality on the s hipment invoice compared to what was actually shipped  is observed, the 
Pharmacist or the appropriate person must document that on the acknowledgement of receipt and contact [CONTACT_3433] e CRO .

[IP_ADDRESS] GUIDELINES FOR INFUSION TREATMENT OF UBLITUXIMAB  OR IV PLACEBO  
• Necessity of MS Center /Neurology Department : Center must have pers onnel and equipment 
necessary to provide adequate emergency treatment for anaphylaxis, hypotension and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506].  
• Method of Administration: Ublituximab or IV placebo must be administered as an intravenous 
infusion through a dedicated intravenous line and will be done under the supervision of the study investigator  or a designee  
• Potential Drug Interactions :  No drug interactions have been reported to date.  
• Pre- medications:  Pre-medicate 30- 60 minutes p rior to each dose of ublituximab  or IV placebo 
with an antihistamine (diphenhydramine 50 mg  or equivalent ), and corticosteroid 
(dexamethasone 10 -20 mg or equivalent).  Oral acetaminophen, 650 mg  (or equivalent; only 
used for intervention) should be restricted to subject who experience fever or pyrexia after Week 1 dose, or as clinically warranted and additional medication (which needs to be 
documented) may be used at discretion of the physician if adverse reactions occur.  
Note: In case the above referenced medications are not available, equivalents can be used at the Investigator’s discretion. If medications are given intravenously, the IV line used for 
ublituximab/IV placebo should not be used. If needed, please consult the Medical Monitor.  
• Subject Care Implications :   
o Ublitux imab  or IV placebo  should not be administered as an IV push or bolus.  
o Ublituximab  or IV placebo  should only be diluted in 0.9% NaCl.  
o Diluted ublituximab  or IV placebo  should be checked before administration for 
cloudiness, color, or deposits.  Ublituximab  or IV placebo  should not be administered if it 
does not conform to the manufacturer’s specifications. The  Monitor/Sponsor must be 
informed immediately of any quality concerns or questions about the product. 
o It is recommended that ublituximab  or IV placebo be administered immediately after 
dilution within 24  hours .

 o Subsequent Doses of 450mg ublituximab/IV placebo (Week 3 Day 15, Weeks 
24, 48, and 72):  
 The suggested initial rate of infusion should be 100 mL/hr. If 100 mL/hr is 
tolerated for [ADDRESS_910317]/ PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106] (rates of 100 mL/h r up to a 
maximum of 400 mL/hr).  
 At Treating Neurologist/ PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106], subjects may receive ublituximab/IV 
placebo at even slower rates, as long as the known stability profile of diluted 
ublituximab is not violated (see ublituximab IB). An example of such  an 
infusion scheme is 25 mL/hr for 30 minutes, increasing to 50 mL/hr after 30 minutes, then 75 mL/hr after 30 minutes, concluding at 100  mL/hr for 1 hour 
and 45 minutes.  
 If there are any questions about a particular infusion scheme, please contact 
[CONTACT_96002] O or Sponsor.  
 If there is a second interruption of the infusion  on the same infusion  day due to IRR symptoms, the 
infusion of ublituximab  or IV placebo  must be stopped and the subject should be scheduled for the 
next day. IRR is not a reason to discontinu e a subject from the study  or future infusions . 
 
Infusion Delays due to Relapse  
For subjects reporting a suspected relapse the T reating Neurologist  should perform an U nscheduled 
Relapse Visit. The next scheduled infusion visit is postponed until the subject is back to baseline or 
PI/Treating Neurologist  does not expect any improvement.  
 CO-ADMINISTRATION  FOR UBLITUXIMAB/ ORAL P LACEBO AND 
TERIFLUNOMIDE /IV P LACEBO ON U BLITUXIMAB/ PLACEBO ON INFUSION DAYS   
Ublituximab or IV placebo infusion days are defined as Week [ADDRESS_910318] dose of teriflunomide or oral placebo will 
occur on Week 1 Day2 . On other ublituximab or IV placebo infusion days, if vomiting occurs during 
infusion , do not administer t eriflunomide or oral placebo  on that day.  Resume administration of 
teriflunomide or oral placebo  the next day.

 8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This section describes the statistical methods to be used to analyze the efficacy and safety 
endpoints.  Safety related analyses are described in Section 9. Full details will be provided in a  
formal statistical analysis plan (SAP) .  The final Clinical S tudy Report  will describe deviations from 
the SAP, if any.   
The statistical analyses will be done once all subjects have completed Week 96 (Week 96 visit or 
earlier if withdrawn).  
8.[ADDRESS_910319] on relapses will be conducted at the two -sided type I error set to 0.0 5.  All 
tertiary  hypothes es will be conducted at a two -sided significance level of 0.05.  P -values will be 
presented with 4 decimals and p -values that are less than 0.00 01 will be presented as <0.00 01. 
Continuous (non- survival related) data will be summarized using descriptive statistics: number of 
observations (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, 25th and 75th percentiles, minimum, and 
maximum.  Frequencies and percentages will be used to summarize categorical (discrete) data.  
Presentations of categorical data will generally suppress percentages for items where the cou nt is 
zero in order to draw attention to the nonzero counts.  
8.3 STATISTICAL ANALYSES WILL BE  DESCRIBED IN  DETAIL  IN THE 
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  COMPLETED PRIOR TO FINAL

measures. The analyses of baseline characteristics will be presented  for the Safety, ITT, mITT, and PP  
Population s by [CONTACT_1570].    
8.6 MEDICAL HISTORY  
Medical history will be captured  at the Screening visit.  Medical history will be coded using MedDRA 
and will be listed and summarized by [CONTACT_96006] . 
All prior and concomitant medications and procedures will be classified by [CONTACT_96007] (WHO) Drug Dictionary  and will be summarized by [CONTACT_96008] . Prior medications and procedures are those 
which have a stop date prior to the randomization date, and concomitant medications and 
procedures are those which have a stop date after treatment start  date or are ongoing . Concomitant 
medications will  be assessed at both scheduled and unscheduled visits.  
8.7 EXTENT OF EXPOSURE  
The dose (mg) of study drugs administered, the total number of doses of study drugs, and the duration of treatment will be summarized with descriptive statistics.   
For ublituximab or IV placebo infusions,   treatment exposure is summarized as the total 
number of infusions (greater than 50% complete) received over the 5 expected infusions.  
Furthermore, the overall number of infusions, number and percentage (based on all 
infusions) of  infusions completed with/without interruption and infusions not completed 
will be calculated per arm.  The number and percentage of patients (based on all patients with at least one infusion) with and without any infusion complication (interruption or sto p) 
per arm will be presented as well.  The percentage of planned total infusion received will also be calculated.  
 
For teriflunomide or oral placebo, the proportion of at least 80 percent of taken oral medication will 
be calculated.  These proportions will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
8.8 INTERIM SAMPLE SIZE REASSESSMENT  
An independent committee, Blinded Assessment Relapse Team (BART), reporting to TG 
Therapeutics, and the DSMB will reassess the sample size for the study when [ADDRESS_910323] been randomized.  Assuming a uniform rate of recruitment, we need an estimate as to how many person years of exposure will occur before an interim adjustment occurs.  If 

TG1101 -RMS302    
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 83 of 140 
 recruitment is going to be accomplished in 8 to 10 months, the aver age exposure time when 210 
subjects per group are recruited would experience half of the recruitment period or 9/2=4.[ADDRESS_910324] approximately 4.5 x 210 
= 945 person months or approximately  43 person years of observation (the denominator to compute 
the ARR).   
The Table below provides the sample sizes (total adjusted sample sizes) needed per group per study 
based on the findings at the interim (Columns of the Table) for reductions in the ARR  of teriflunomide 
by 40%.  As an example, if the estimated ARR in the pooled population is 0.20 and we are assuming 
an hypothesized 40% reduction in the ARR rate by [CONTACT_673553], then the ARR in the individual groups (red numbers in the table below) can be derived by [CONTACT_47929] a simple equation; (N
U*0.6 P T + N T*PT)/( 
NU + N T)=0.20 where P T is the ARR in the teriflunomide group and N T and N U are the sample sizes, 
assumed to be equal.  Thus, if the combined ARR=0.20, then this equation under the hypothesized 
reduction of 40% yields an estimated ARR of 0.25 in teriflunomide and 0.15 in ublituximab.  
Calculating the required sample size using a negative binomial comparison with 1.75 years of observation overall, results in an updated sample size of 219 per group.  Thus, the original sample 
size of N=[ADDRESS_910325] by [CONTACT_1583] 19 participants per treatment group, plus the 
10% for dropouts yielding a total of [ADDRESS_910326] two (2) characteristics - o ne, they require smaller 
sample sizes and two, they are unlikely to occur because the ARR rate in the teriflunomide group 
would have to exceed 0.31 (arbitrarily chosen, but some level is reasonable as an upper limit on what 
the rate is likely to be).  Either way, if the blinded ARR falls in the green area or above, the sample size will not be reduced since we do not plan to reduce the sample size and [ADDRESS_910327] already been enrolled. The yellow area is the range for the combined to tal rates. If 
the overall ARR =0.19 then the estimated teriflunomide rate would be estimated at 0.2375 and ublituximab would be estimated at 0.1425 and the sample size required would be 233 per group.  Thus, a rate <= 0.19, the sample size will be increased by [ADDRESS_910328] the additional sample size if warranted.  

TG1101 -RMS302    
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 85 of 140 
 Relapses that occur after study drugs are withdrawn will be assessed over the remai nder of the 
study period and this data will be utilized as part of additional sensitivity analysis (described in the 
statistical plan) as long as the subject has not withdrawn their consent to be in the trial.  
 The trea tment  group will have 2 levels  (teriflunomide / IV placebo  or ublituximab /oral placebo).  In 
order to  acco unt for diffe rent treatment d urations  am ong subjects, the  log- transforme d 
stand ardized treatment duration  (randomization to date last treatment before early withdrawal  or 
completion of Week 96 asses sment ) will be  included in the  mod el a s an “offset” variable fo r 
appro priate computation of the Annualized Relapse Rate .   will be used to assess 
the overall model with subjects  in a repeated stateme nt using a G enera lized Estim ating  Equation 
(GEE) approach . 
 
Two -sided 95% conf idence intervals of  the ra te ratio will be  provid ed for the c omp arisons of  
Ublituximab /oral placebo  versus teriflunomide /IV placebo .  The  estimated r elapse rate and its 2-
sided  95% confide nce int ervals will be  provided f or each treatment group.
 
 SECONDARY E FFICACY VARIABLES  
The key secondary outcomes will be tested using a hierarchical approach with the order specified  
below  using a step -down procedure where each test is at a Type I error 0.05. If any endpoints fail to 
reach significance, then formal testing of significance of the subsequent secondary outcomes will not 
be performed.  
1. Total  number of gadolinium enhancing (Gd -enhancing) T1 -lesions per MRI scan by [CONTACT_10585] 96.     
2. Total  number of new and enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions (NELs) per MRI scan by [CONTACT_10585]  
96. 
3. Time to Confi rmed Disability Progression (CDP) for at least 12 weeks occurring during the 
96-week, double -blind treatment period. *   
4. Proportion of subjects with No Evidence of Disease Activity (NEDA) from Week 24 to Week 
96.   
5. Proportion  of subjects reaching impaired SDMT (Symbol Digit Modalities Test) from baseline 
to Week  96.   
6. Percentage change in Brain Volume from baseline to Week 96 . 
 
* Confirmed Disability Progression for at least 12 weeks during the 96 -week treatment period will 
be analyzed using pooled data from the two identical studies TG1101 -RMS301 and TG1101-
RMS302 . 
The total number of gadolinium enhancing (Gd -enhancing) T1 -lesions will be calculated as the sum 
of the individual number of lesions at weeks 12, 24, 48, and 96, divided by [CONTACT_96009].  The total number of new and enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions will be calculated 
as the sum of the individual number of lesions at weeks 24, 48, and 96, divided by [CONTACT_96010].  The MRI count variabl es will be assessed for differences between the 
treatment groups using negative binomial regression with an offset based on time on study and covariates, region , baseline EDSS strata, and baseline MRI counts.   Percent brain volume change will 
be assessed between the two groups using linear mixed effects models  with 
covariates region , baseline EDSS strata, and baseline brain volume.

 Disability progression is defined as an increase of ≥1.0 point from the baseline EDSS score that is not  
attributable to another etiology (e.g., fever, concurrent illness, or concomitant medication) when the 
baseline score is 5.5 or less, and ≥0.[ADDRESS_910329] 12 weeks during the 96 -week 
treatment period will be analyzed using pooled data from  the two identical studies TG1101 -
RMS301 and TG1101 -RMS302.  With the exception of this endpoint (CDP), which  will be an alyzed 
at the pooled level, all other secondary efficacy endpoints will be tested if and only if the individual 
study secondary endpoint listed ahead of it has reached the significance level at 0.05.    
All pre -s
pecified pooled analyses are listed below.  However, only CDP for at least [ADDRESS_910330] 12 weeks (secondary analysis)

3. Time to Confirmed Disability Improvement for at least 12 weeks (tertiary analysis)  
4. Time to Confirmed Disability Improvement for at least 24 weeks (tertiary analysis)  
 
 Summary tables  of progression to CDP will present the proportion who achieved CDP at Week 96  and 
associated 95% CIs for each treatment group. The median time -to-event with 2-sided  95% CIs as well 
as the proportion of subjects remaining event -free at times of interest will be estimated using Kaplan -
Meier methods implemented with .  All time to CDP (and CDI) endpoints will 
be analyzed similarly.  
 
 
The p roportion  of subjects with  No Evidence of Disease Activity  (NEDA) will be calculated at Week 
96. A subject with NEDA is defined as a subject without relapses confirmed by [CONTACT_95954], without MRI activities (no T1 Gd+ lesions and no new/enlarging T2 lesions), and no 12 -week Confirmed D isability 
Progression. Any evidence of disease activity from Week 24 to Week 96 will be counted as not 
reaching NEDA.  Any evidence of disease activity before Week 24 will not count.  NEDA rates will be 
compared using logistic regression  with baseline adjustments the same as 
used in the primary analysis plus baseline MRI counts and without an offset to take into account time 
on study.     
 Change in c ognition (SDMT)  will be assessed  using  the total score at each SDMT  visit which is defined 
as the total number of correct answers reported in the CRF.  Impaired SDMT is defined as a decrease from baseline of at least [ADDRESS_910331] -baseline assessment  up to the Week 96 visit .  The 
propor tion of impaired SDMT will be analyzed in all subjects in the mITT population .  SDMT rates 
will be compared using logistic regression  with baseline adjustments the 
same as used in the primary endpoint analysis, without treatment duration offset, but including log -
transformed baseline MRI counts (T1 unenhancing, T2, Gad enhancing).  To avoid zero values for the 
log transformation of MRI counts, 1 will be added to each observation before transforming . 
 SENSITIVITY ANALYSES

Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 87 of 140 
 Sensitivity Analysis  
1.  The primary analysis will be repeated based on all reported MS relapses (rather than just 
confirmed ones).  
2.  A time to relapses analysis using Cox proportional hazards model with first IRAP -confirmed 
relapse as the primary event will be conducted to compare with the primary analysis in a negative 
binomial model. The  Cox proportional hazards model will be specified with treatment, region, 
number of relapses in previous year, baseline EDSS  score , baseline number of T1 Gd -enhancing 
lesions sex and the subject’s age at baseline as covariates.  
3.  To assess the effects of treatment withdrawals, the primary analysis will be repeated using the 
information on relapses which occur during the period following drug withdrawal to the end of the study period regardless of whether additional treatment were utilized.  Relapses which  occurred 
after permanent discontinuation of study medication will be included and natural log (time on study in years) rather than the natural log  (time on study drug in years) will be used as the offset variable 
in the negative binomial model, which is the primary analysis.  
4. We will examine the dropouts from the trial using all participants who provided withdrawal of 
consent excluding deaths.  Multiple imputation will be used to impute the expected number of relapses a participant would have had if they had continued to participate in the trial.  To perform 
the imputation, [ADDRESS_910332] the imputations will include: treatment, region, 
number of relapses in previous year, baseline EDSS  score , baseline number of T1 Gd -enhancing 
lesions sex and the subject ’s age at baseline as covariates.  
5.  For secondary outcomes T1 Gd enhancing, T2 NELs, and 12 week CDP, the effects of dropouts and 
study discontinuations will be similarly evaluated as number 4 above.   
6.  Additional sensitivity analyses may be defined in the analysis plan prior to database lock.  
 
 TER TIARY EFFICACY AND OTHER VARIABLES  
All tertiary analyses will be assessed at a Type I err or of 0.05 with no adjustment for multiplicity.

 Change in MSFC  and Health Outomes (MSQoL -54 (inclusive of SF36), FIS), will be analyzed using  
linear Mixed Models .  including results with baseline as a covariate along with region and other 
covariates if used in the primary analyses.   
 
The analysis  of CDI at 12 and 24 weeks will utilize the same approach as that used for CDP.     12 Week 
Confirmed Disability Improvem ent (12 Week CDI) is defined as a reduction from the baseline EDSS 
score of at least 1.0 point (or 0.5 points if the baseline EDSS score was >5.5) that was sustained and 
confirmed at the next scheduled visit at least 12 weeks after the initial documentatio n of neurological 
improveme nt.  Simi larly, 24- week Confirmed Disability Improvement (24 Week CDI) requires an 
initial reduction from baseline EDSS score and a subsequent confirmation of the reduction at all 
regular scheduled visits for at least [ADDRESS_910334] as the primary endpoint.  
For analysis of lesion volume related variables (Total volume of Gd enhancing T1 lesions per MRI 
scan over the treatment period, Volume of T2 lesions, Volume of hypointense T1 lesion component (black holes)) Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) analyses will be implemented via  
 
Time to first confirmed rel apse is defined as (date of relapse onset – date of randomization + 1) and 
will be regarded as censored at the end of treatment. The analysis will be similar to the one of time 
to confirmed disability progression. The proportions of subjects with a relapse  and subjects free of 
disability progression at different time points will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method.

 9 SAFETY REPORTING AND ANALYSIS  
9.1 SAFETY ANALYSES  
To evaluate the safety of ublituximab /placebo  and teriflunomide/oral placebo , as determined by 
[CONTACT_20721] (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs), including MS worsening.   
Safety will be tabulated as described below in the safety section.  Tables will summarize the 
proportion of subjects ever ex periencing a particular AE, and in select tables will also include  the 
number of times a particular AE occurs.  
Safety evaluations will be based on the incidence, intensity, and type of adverse events, as well as on 
clinically significant changes in the su bject ’s physical examination, vital signs, and clinical laboratory 
results.  Safety analyses will be performed using the safety population.  Safety variables will be 
tabulated and presented by [CONTACT_96011].  Exposure to study treatment and reasons 
for discontinuation of study treatment will also be tabulated .  Must obtain expert evaluations of brain 
MRI images of subjects with suspected opportunistic CNS infections including PML.   
For select laboratory values, box plots of the values over time will be used for displays of these 
parameters . In the event of higher than expected incidence rates of abnormalities, further exploration 
of combinations of events, such as Hy’s law, will be examined.  
9.2 ADVERSE E VENTS  
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject  or clinical investigation 
subject  administered a pharmaceutical product. An AE does not necessarily have to have a causal  
relationship with this treatment.   An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporarily associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether  or not considered related to the 
medicinal product. This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or 
frequency from the baseline condi tion.  
9.3 ADVERSE EVENT CHARACTERISTICS  
The descriptions and grading scales found in the revis ed NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.[ADDRESS_910335] access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 3.  A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 3 can 
be downloaded from the following  web site 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic applications/ctc.htm.     
The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0 3 is to be used for the 
grading of severity of symptoms and abnormal findings.  For adverse events not covered by [CONTACT_6812] -
CTCAE Version 4.0 3 grading system, the following definitions will be used:  

TG1101 -RMS302    
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 91 of 140 
 • Grade 1 : Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
• Grade 2:  Moderate; minimal, local or non -invasive intervention indicated.  
• Grade 3 : Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12342].  
• Grade 4 : Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
• Grade 5 : Death related to AE. 
9.4 ADVERSE EVENT EXPECTEDNESS  
AEs can be ‘Unexpected’ or ‘Expected’ for expedited reporting purposes only . Expected AEs are thos e 
listed in the Investigator Brochure s for either ublituximab or teriflunomide.  
9.5 TREATMENT EMERGENT ADVERSE EVENTS (TEAE’S)  
The frequency and percentages of subjects with treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be 
tabulated by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC ) and preferred term ( PT), where treatment -emergent is 
defined as any AE with an onset on or after the first dose of study medication and through [ADDRESS_910336] study drug administration will be 
summarized.  
9.6 ADVERSE E VENTS / SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT CA[LOCATION_003]LITY ASSESSMENT 
The Investigator must also assess the relationship of any adverse event to the use of study drug, 
(whether none, one, or all) based on available information, using the following guidelines:  
1. Not Related : Clear -cut temporal and/or mechanistic relation to a cause  other than the 
study drug.  
2. Doubtful: There is no reasonable possibility that the event is related to the study 
medications but a definite cause cannot be ascertained.  
3. Possible : There is still a reasonable possibility that the cause of the event was the st udy 
medications but there exists a more likely cause of the event such as complications of 
progressive disease.  
4. Probable : The most likely cause of the event is the study medications  but other causes 
cannot be completely excluded.  
5. Definite: Clear cut tempor al and/or mechanistic relation to the study medications .  All 
other causes have been eliminated.  Events classified as definite will often be confirmed 

TG1101 -RMS302    
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 92 of 140 
 by [CONTACT_96012].  
In the summary of drug related AEs, “Not Related” and “Doubtful”  will be considered as “Not Drug 
Related” and “Possible”, “Probable”, and “Definite”  will be considered as “Drug Related.”   In the event 
that causality is missing for an AE, it will be considered as “Drug Related.”  
 RECORDING OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
All adverse events of any subject  during the course of the trial will be reported on the electronic 
CaseRreport F orm, and the investigator will give his or her opi[INVESTIGATOR_95928] (i.e., whether the event is related or unrelated to trial drug 
administration –ublituximab /IV placebo or teriflunomide /oral placebo ).  If the adverse event  is 
serious, it should be reported as soon as possible and no greater than [ADDRESS_910337] events occurring in the framework of a clinical trial are also to be recorded as AEs (i.e., AEs that occur prior to assignment of trial treatment that are related to a protocol-mandated intervention, including invasive procedures such as biopsies, medication washout, or no 
treatment run -in). 
All AEs regardless of seriousness or relationship to ublituximab /IV placebo  and/or 
teriflun omide /oral placebo  treatment , as well as all pregnancies, spanning from the signing of the 
informed consent and  until [ADDRESS_910338] , are to be recorded on the e CRF /Pregnancy 
Report Form .  
 ABNORMAL LABORATORY VALUES AND VITAL SIGNS  
The reporting of abnormalities of vital signs as adverse events should be avoided.  Abnormalities of 
vital signs should not be reported unless any criterion for an SAE is fulfilled, the vital signs abnormalities cause the subject  to discontinue trial treat ment, or the investigator insists that the 
abnormality should be reported as an AE.  Abnormal laboratory results should be noted in the eCRF as an adverse event if they are associated with an overdose, require prolong in-patient  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or are oth erwise considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_093]. If an abnormal 
laboratory value or vital sign is associated with clinical signs and/or symptoms, the sign or symptom 
should be reported as an AE, and the associated laboratory value or vital sig n should be considered 
additional information that must be collected in the relevant eCRF.  If the laboratory abnormality is 
a sign of a disease or syndrome, only the diagnosis needs to be recorded on the SAE Report Form or 
AE eCRF.  
Clinical Laboratory Res ults will be summarized.  Summary statistics for actual values and for changes 
from baseline will be tabulated for laboratory results by [CONTACT_96013].  Subjects  with laboratory 
values outside of the normal reference range at any post -baseline assessment  will be summarized, 
and graded per NCI CTCAE Version 4.[ADDRESS_910339] . 
 HANDLING OF ADVERSE EVENTS

on the e CRF.  After 20 weeks , only AEs, SAEs, or deaths assessed by [CONTACT_96014] . 
9.7 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 DEFINITIONS OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
The definitions of serious adverse events (SAEs) are given below.  The P rincipal Investigator is 
responsible for ensuring that all staff involved in the trial are familiar with the content of this section.  
An SAE or reaction is defined as any untowa rd medical occurrence that:  
• Results in death, is immediately life -threatening,  
• Requires in -patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, and/or  
• Causes a congenital anomaly /birth defect.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the subject  or may require 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the previous definition.  These should also usually be considered serious.  Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
A S[LOCATION_003]R is defined as a suspected unexpected SAE, and S[LOCATION_003]R reporting is encompassed within SAE reporting guidelines as defined in this section.  
Treatment within or admission to the following facilities is not considered to meet the criteria of “in -
patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” (although if any other SAE criteria are met, the event must still be treated as 
an SAE and immediately reported):  
• Emergency Department or Emergency Room  
• Out- patient  or same -day surgery units  
• Observation or short -stay unit  
• Rehabilitation facility  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64341]  
• Nursing homes, Custodial care or Respi[INVESTIGATOR_95929]1101 -RMS302    
Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page [ADDRESS_910341] the reporting status of the SAE.  
Events related to underly ing MS disease (i.e., MS progression) also do not require reporting as an 
SAE.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95930] a pre -planned surgical or medical procedure (one which was 
planned prior to entry in the trial), does not require reporting as a serious adverse event to the 
Sponsor . 
 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING BY [CONTACT_96015] “serious” and “severe” adverse events, as the terms are not synonymous.  Severity is a measure of intensity; however, an AE of severe intensity need not 
necessarily be considered serious.  For  example, nausea which persists for several hours may be 
considered severe nausea, but may not be considered an SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke which results in a limited degree of disability may be considered only a mild stroke, but would be considered an SAE.  Severity and seriousness should be independently assessed when recording AEs and SAEs 
on the e CRF.  
Adverse events classified by [CONTACT_673554].  Serious adverse events 
may occur at any time from the signing of the informed consent form through the [ADDRESS_910342] knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_96017].   
To report an SAE, see the appropriate SAE e CRF page.  
All SAEs and medically confir med deaths (regardless of causality assessment) spanning from the 
signing of the informed consent and  until [ADDRESS_910343] be expeditiously 
reported to the sponsor as SAEs within the e CRF and followed until resolution (with autopsy r eport 
if applicable).  
The investigator must review and sign off on the SAE data on the SAE report.  The SAE will be reported to the Sponsor (or Sponsor designee) as outlined in the Safety Monitoring Plan.   
If an SAE is reported to the sponsor or designee via fax, the same information must be entered on the 
eCRF within 24 hours (1 business day).  The SAE transmission should be confirmed by [CONTACT_96018].  
Follow- up information for SAEs and information on non -serious AEs that become  serious should also 
be reported to the sponsor or designee as soon as it is available; these reports should be submitted using the appropriate e CRF.  The detailed SAE reporting process will be provided to the sites in the 
Investigator Study Guide .

Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page [ADDRESS_910344] (IRBs /EC)/Independent Ethics Committee according to the policies of the responsible IRB  or 
Ethics Committee . 
9.8  SPONSOR SAE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
Sponso r is responsible for reporting relevant SAEs to the Competent Authority, other applicable 
Regulatory A uthorities, and participating investigators, in accordance with ICH guidelines, FDA 
regulations, and/or local regulatory requirements.  
Sponsor is responsible for reporting related, unexpected fatal or life -threatening events associated 
with the use of the trial drugs to the regulatory agencies and competent authorities via telephone or 
fax within 7 calendar days after being notified of the event.  The Spons or will report all related , 
unexpected SAEs including non- death/non -life-threatening SAEs associated with the use of the trial 
medications to the applicable Regulatory  Authorities , investigators, and central IRBs  or EC by a 
written safety report within [ADDRESS_910345] medical terminology/concepts when recording AEs or SAEs on the 
SAE Report Forms and AE e CRF.  Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.  
All AEs, including th ose that meet SAE reporting criteria, should be recorded on the AE e CRF; AEs 
that meet the definition of an SAE should additionally be reported . 
9.[ADDRESS_910346] ’s own words (verbatim) unless, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_95931]/or Treating Neurologist , the AEs constitute components of a recognized condition, 
disease, or syndrome.  In the latter case, the condition, disease, or syndrome should be named rather 
than each individual sign or sympto m.  If a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be 
medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded as an AE or SAE as appropriate on the relevant form(s) (SAE Report Form and/or AE e CRF).  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it should be reported, as follow -up 
information is available.  If a diagnosis is determined subsequent to the reporting of the constellation 
of symptoms, the signs/symptoms should be updated to r eflect the diagnosis . 
 PERSISTENT OR RECURRENT ADVERSE EVENTS  
A persistent AE is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between subject  evaluation time 
points.  Such events should only be recorded once on the SAE Report Form and/or the AE e CRF.    If 
a persistent AE becomes more severe (changes from a Grade 1 or 2 AE to a Grade 3 or 4 AE) or lessens 
in severity (changes from a Grade 3 or 4 AE to a Grade 1 or 2 AE), it should be recorded on a separate 
SAE Report Form and/or AE e CRF.

Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page [ADDRESS_910347]  evaluation time points, and 
subsequently recurs.  All recurrent AEs should be recorded on an SAE Report Form and/or AE  eCRF 
for each recurrence . 
 ABNORMAL LABORATORY VALUES  
Abnormal laboratory results should be noted in the eCRF as an adverse event if they are associated 
with an overdose, require or prolong in -patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or are otherwis e considered 
clinically significant by [CONTACT_093]. If an abnormal laboratory value or vital sign is associated 
with clinical signs and/or symptoms, the sign or symptom should be reported as an AE, and the 
associated laboratory value or vital sign sho uld be considered additional information that must be 
collected in the relevant eCRF.  If the laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome, only 
the diagnosis needs to be recorded on the SAE Report Form or AE eCRF. 
 DEATHS  
All medically confirmed  deaths, regardless of attribution, spanning from the signing of the informed 
consent and  until [ADDRESS_910348] “Death NOS” on the e CRF Adverse Event page . 
 HOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_55108], PROLONGED HOSPI[INVESTIGATOR_55108], OR SURGERY  
Any AE that results in  in-patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95932].  There are some hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95933] (refer to Sections 9.7.1 and 9.7.2) .   
 PRE -EXISTING MEDICAL CONDITIONS  
A pre -existing relevant medical condition is one that is present at the start of the trial.  Such 
conditions should be recorded on the study’s appropriate medical history e CRF.  A pre -existing 
medical condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the trial.  When recording such events on the appropriate SAE Report Form and/or AE  eCRF, it is importan t to convey the concept that the pre -existing condition has 
changed by [CONTACT_9672]. 
 PROTOCOL -DEFINED EVENTS OF SPECIAL INTEREST  
Reference the ublituximab  Investigator Brochure for Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) . AEs 
that are considered AESIs are to be reported in the appropriate eCRF. SAEs that are considered 
AESIs should be reported following the timeline and reporting process outlined in Section 9.7.2.

 Pregnancy:  
Since pregnancy as such is not considered to be an adverse e vent, it does not need to be reported as 
an AESI.  However, if pregnancy is associated with adverse events, it is these adverse events that 
need to be reported in eCRF.  Pregnancy reporting requirements outlined in Appendix A must be 
followed. 
Overdose: 
All instances of overdose , whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, of either ublituximab/IV placebo 
or Teriflunomide/oral placebo must be reported in eCRF on the Overdose form .  Anything over the 
prescribed daily dose is considered an overdose.  
If an overdose is associated with adverse events, it is these adverse events that need to be reported 
in eCRF.  If an adverse event associated with an overdose meets a seriousness criterion, it must be 
expeditiously reported as an SAE.  
Suicidal ideation and behavior will be identified by [CONTACT_96019] “Suicide/self -injury”.

Dated: 04 September 2020 (Ver. 5.0)  Page 100  of 140 
 The ICF will be submitted for approval to the IRB /EC that is responsible for review and approval of 
the trial.  Each consent form must include all of the relevant elements curr ently required by [CONTACT_96024] A uthority, as well as local county authority or state regulations and national 
requirements.  
Before recruitment and enrollment into the trial, each prospective candidate will be given a full 
explanation of the trial.  Once the essential information has been provided to the prospective 
candidate, and the investigator is sure that the individual candidate understands the implications of 
participating in this trial, the candidate will be asked to give consent to participate in the trial by 
[CONTACT_21006].  A notation that written informed consent has been obtained will be made in the subject ’s medical record.  A copy of the informed consent form, including the subject ’s 
signature, will be provided b y the investigator to the subject .   
If an amendment to the protocol substantially alters the trial design or the potential risks to the subjects, the subject ’s consent to continue participation in the trial must be obtained .  Additionally, 
upon either IRA P-confirmed or  Treating Neurologist  medically confirmed  relapse, subjects should 
re-consent to continue participation in the trial.  
11.[ADDRESS_910353] ’s personal data will be protected in accordance with the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA ; for [LOCATION_003] only ), and national data protection laws. 
HIPAA regulations require that, in order to participate in the trial, a subject  must sign an 
authorization from the tr ial that he or she has been informed of following: 
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this trial;  
• Who will have access to that information and why;  
• Who will use or disclose that information;  
• That health information may be further disclosed by [CONTACT_1955][INVESTIGATOR_64343], and that if the information is disclosed the information may no longer be protected by [CONTACT_96025];  
• The information collected about the research trial will be kept separate from the subject ’s 
medical records, but the subject  will be able to obtain the research records after the 
conclusion of the trial;  
• Whether the authorization contains an expi[INVESTIGATOR_320]; and  
• The rights of a research subject  to revoke his or her authorization .  
In the event that a subject  revokes authorization to collect or use his or her PHI, the investigator, by 
[CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject  
authorization.  For subjects that have revoked a uthorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be 
made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e., that the subject  is alive) at the end of 
their scheduled trial period.

(eCRF) will be utilized for the collection of all data and all data will be entered using the English language and should be kept current to enable the monitor to review the subjects’ status throughout 
the course of the trial.  
In order to maintain confidentiality, only subject  number and year  of birth wil l identify the subject  in 
the eCRF.  If the subject ’s name  [CONTACT_96045] (e.g. , laboratory 
report), it must be obliterated on the copy of the document to be supplied to the investigator site and 
replaced instead with the subject  number and subject ’s year of birth .  The investigator will maintain 
a personal subject  identification list ( subject  numbers with corresponding subject  identifiers) to

 14 APPENDIX A; PREGNANCY  
Women Not of Childbearing Potential are Defined as Follows:  
Women are considered post -menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 
months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g., age 
appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea  (based on 
the subject’s medical history)  with serum FSH levels > 40 mIU/mL [for US only: and estradiol 
< 20 pg/mL] or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at least 
six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the rep roductive status of the woman 
has been confirmed by [CONTACT_96035].   In addition, f emale patients with hysterectomy but with available ovaries  are not 
considered WOCBP because of their belonging to surgically sterile category of patients.  
Contraceptive Guidelines for Women of Child-Bearing Potential:  
Women of child -bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming 
pregnant, must use effective contraception during the study and for [ADDRESS_910367] study 
drug was administered . The effective contraception is defined as either:  
1. True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject . 
Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods) and 
withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
2. Sterilization:  have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks ago.  In case of oophorectom y alone, only when the 
reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by [CONTACT_96036].  
3. Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post -vasectomy documentation of the 
absence of sperm in the ejaculate). For female subjects o n the study, the vasectomised male 
partner should be the sole partner for that subject . 
4. Oral contraception, injected or implanted hormonal methods.  
5. Use of a combination of any two of the following (a+b):  
a. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intraut erine system (IUS).  
b. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or 
cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository.  
The following are unacceptable  forms of contraception for women of childbearing poten tial: 
 
• Female condom  
• Natural family planning (rhythm method) or breastfeeding  
• Fertility awareness  
• Withdrawal  
• Cervical shield

Fertile Males:  
Fertile males, defined as all males physiologically capable of conceiving offspring must use condom 
during treatment, and for an additional [ADDRESS_910369]/male subject’s partner will be asked to provide informed consent to allow the pre gnancy to be followed up for the 
full duration (or until termination) to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary

 17 APPENDIX D; INDEPENDENT RELAPSE A DJUDICATION PANEL 
(IRAP)  
Independent Relapse Adjudication Panel  (IRAP)  
The Phase III  study includes an objective definition of relapse and a standardized procedure for 
assessment of all suspected relapses as described in Section 4.4.1.  As outlined in this section, the 
Treating Neurologist will, within these guidelines, exercise his or her best clinical judgement in 
treating the suspected relapse.  However, neither the Treating  Neurologist  nor the blinded 
rater/Examining Neurologist will make the final determination of whether a suspected event is 
counted as a relapse for the purpose of calculating the primary study outcome of Annualized Relap se 
Rate (ARR).  Instead, an independent, blinded IRAP will make all relapse determinations in the Phase 
III study.  The purpose of the IRAP is to ensure that relapses are scored in a manner that is co nsistent 
and objective as possible, and to minimize the variability between sites.  
The IRAP will review all subject records pertaining to suspected on -study relapses (i.e., new or 
worsening neurological symptoms of acute onset ) that occur outside the sche duled study visits and 
are reported by [CONTACT_60259] [ADDRESS_910372] , of a suspected 
relapse/acute neurological event, the Treating Neurologist and Examining Neurologists will in an 
independent manner, and blinded t o the results of their separate examination s follow the procedures 
and timelines as described below and outlined in Appendix E.   All  suspected relapses initially 
reported by [CONTACT_673559] T reating  Neurologi st 
considered the subject ’s symptoms to be the result of a relapse.  
The IRAP comprises of [ADDRESS_910373] Researc h Organization 
(CRO) who manages  all I RAP activities throughout the study.  IRAP members a re required to review 
trial data and perform adjudications in accordance with the protocol - specified definition (S ection 
4.4.1).     
The CRO  transfers blinded data  that a re relevant to assessment of relapses  (entered into the  eCRF  by 
[CONTACT_673560]) and prepares  blinded case dossiers to 
be reviewed by [CONTACT_941] I RAP via a secure electroni c portal.  The dossiers include  a standardized listing 
for each suspected relapse that specified onset date, type and severity of reported symptoms, 
whether the event had disqualifying characteristics (e.g., lasted less than 24 hours , or symptoms not 
MS- related), and whether event has been  treated with methylprednisolone.  The dossiers also include  
vital signs, AEs related to the potential relapse, physical examinations, and EDSS scores with all supporting data from the standardized Neurostatus exam; values from baseline and the most recent prior quarterly assessment a re provided as context for values from the relapse evaluation visit.  
Medical/surgical history  and clinical epi[INVESTIGATOR_95944] a re also provided.  In order to minimize the 
potential f or inclusion of data which can  potentially unblind an individual case under review (e.g., 
inclusion of adverse event with details that could sugg est a treatment as signment), the CRO will 
perform additional programmatic checks on text fields pertaining to Adverse Events and p hysical 
examination findings for data points that a re part of the relapse case listing.  
Each potential relapse is  reviewed by [ADDRESS_910374] worked and entered their 
evaluations independently, on cases randomly assigned to them by [CONTACT_2024].  The I RAP adjudicates

For the  Phase III  study, the results of I RAP adjudications a re transferred to the Sponsor only after the 
last subject  completes the study. The Sponsor has no knowledge of  IRAP ad judications while the 
study is ongoing.

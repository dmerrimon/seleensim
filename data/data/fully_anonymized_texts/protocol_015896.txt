1.0 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND/OR  SCHEMA  
 
This is an open -label,  single  institution,  phase  Ib/phase  II non-randomized  trial that evaluates  
the safety,  tolerability  and anti-tumor  activity  of fulvestrant  and Debio  1347  in patients  with 
ER+/HER2 - metastatic  breast  cancer  (MBC)  that are FGFR -amplified  (as confirmed  by a CLIA  
certified  laboratory).  The phase  Ib portion  will evaluate  2 dose  cohorts  (80mg  (cohort/dose  
level 1), and one dose  de-escalation  cohort  (60 mg dose  level -1) in case  dose  level [ADDRESS_48933]  doses.  Total  number  of patients  
expected  in the phase  1b portion:  minimum  4 and maximum  12. 
The phase  2 portion  will be comprised  of an optimal  Simon  two-stage  design  to determine  the 
efficacy  (defined  as clinical  benefit  rate (CBR): overall  response  rate (ORR)  + Stable  disease  
(SD) ≥ 24 weeks)  of Debio  1347  plus fulvestrant.  Patients  enrolled  to the phase  II portion  will 
be treated  at the recommended  phase  2 doses  (RP2D)  identified  from the phase  Ib portion  of 
the study.  Total  number  of patients  expected  in the phase  2 portion:  minimum 18, maximum  
43. 
Briefly,  patient’s  eligibility  criteria  will include:  pre/peri/post -menopausal  women  and men with 
metastatic  ER+/HER2 -/FGFR -amplified  breast  cancer,  in first or second  line of treatment  in the 
metastatic  setting  (phase  II portion)  without  prior use of a FGFR  inhibitor;  ECOG  performance  
status  ≤1, normal  baseline  blood  counts  and chemistry  laboratory  profile;  and no intercurrent  
uncontrolled  illness.  Treatment  will be given  until disease  progression  or unacceptable  toxicity.  
To assess  theanti-tumor effect  of therapy,  we will estimate  the overall  tumor  burden  at baseline  
to which  subsequent  measurements  (performed  every  [ADDRESS_48934] 6 months  and then 
every  12 weeks  thereafter  using  the Solid  Tumor  Response  Criteria  [RECIST]  v1.1)  will be 
compared.  
Pharmacokinetic  and pharmacodynamic  data will be obtained  throughout  the phase  Ib/Phase  
II portion  of the study.  A baseline  biopsy  of a metastatic site will be required  for all the patients  
enrolled  on the trial, with the acquisition  of at least [ADDRESS_48935]. Jorge  Reis- 
Filho.  
Plasma  will also be serially  obtained,  for measurement  of plasma  cell-free tumor  DNA (cfDNA)  
at baseline,  Cycle  1 Day15,  Cycle  3 D1 and at disease  progression).  This would  allow  us to 
determine  biomarkers  of response  and/or  resistance  associated  with FGFR  inhibition.

cancer  (MBC)  remains  incurable  and is one of the leading  causes  of cancer -related  mortality.  
Breast  cancer  is a molecularly  heterogeneous  disease  with three  distinct  molecular  subtypes  1. 
The first group  is characterized  by [CONTACT_46430]  (ER) expression  positivity  and/or  
progesterone  receptor  (PgR)  positivity  with the absence  of over-expression  or amplification  of 
HER2.  The second  group  is characterized  by [CONTACT_46431]-expression  or amplification  of HER2,  with 
more than half of these  tumors  being  positive  (+) for expression  of ER/PgR.  The third group  
lacks  detectable  ER and PgR,  and overexpression  of HER2,  and is thus referred  to as triple - 
negative  breast  cancer.  Approximately  65% of newly  diagnosed  breast  cancers  are ER/PgR+  
and HER2 - negative  (also  referred  to as luminal  tumors),  while  an additional  20% of newly  
diagnosed  cases  are HER2+.  ER-targeted  drugs,  specifically  drugs  that antagonize  estrogen  
binding  to the ER (tamoxifen),  drugs  that block  estrogen  biosynthesis  (non-steroidal  and 
steroidal  aromatase  inhibitors  [AI] - only effective  in postmenopausal  patients),  and drugs  that 
antagonize  and downregulate  the ER (fulvestrant),  have been  the mainstay  of systemic  
treatment  for patients  with both localized  and metastatic  ER/PgR+  breast  cancers  2. 
 
Fulvestrant  is the most  recent  addition  to the armamentarium  of hormonal  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_46400].  However,  acquired  resistance  (and occasionally  primary  resistance)  to 
antiestrogen  therapy  universally  develops  in patients  with ER+ MBC3. Interestingly,  even after 
acquired  resistance  develops,  breast  cancer  cells appear  to still depend  on low-level ER 
activity  in addition  to signaling  through  sometimes  acquired  oncogenic  signaling  pathways  4. In 
addition,  in patients  initially  diagnosed  with ER/PgR+  localized  breast  cancer  who later recur,  
tumors  usually  demonstrate  some  degree  of resistance  to antiestrogen  therapy  at the time of 
recurrence5. Therefore,  improving  the efficacy  of endocrine  therapy  would  be of great  benefit  
to patients  with breast  cancer  and represents  a large  unmet  medical  need.  
 
3.1.[ADDRESS_48938]-line or second -line therapy  for ER+ MBC  
 
Fulvestrant  (a selective  estrogen  receptor  down -regulator  or SERD)  is currently  a standard  of 
care hormonal  therapy  option  in patients  with ER+ MBC6. Fulvestrant  has an affinity  for ER 
comparable  to estradiol.  It blocks  the trophic  actions  of estrogens  without  any partial  agonist  
(estrogen -like) activity  and is currently  indicated  for the treatment  of ER+ MBC  in 
postmenopausal  women  with disease  progression  following  primary  antiestrogen  therapy.  
Clinical  trials in postmenopausal  women  with primary  breast  cancer  have shown  that 
fulvestrant  significantly  downregulates  tumor  ER protein  levels  compared  with placebo.  There  
was also a significant  decrease  in PgR expression  consistent  with inhibition  of ERα 
transcription.  Further,  treatment  with fulvestrant  inhibits  tumor  cell proliferation  as measured  
by [CONTACT_15915]67 immunohistochemistry7. 
 
Two phase  III clinical  trials were  completed  in a total of [ADDRESS_48939]  cancer  who had disease  recurrence  on or after adjuvant  endocrine  therapy  or 
progression  following  endocrine  therapy  for advanced  disease8. These  trials compared  the 
safety  and efficacy  of monthly  administration  of fulvestrant  250 mg vs. the non-steroidal  AI 
anastrozole  at 1 mg/daily.  Monthly  [ADDRESS_48940] as effective  as anastrozole

in terms  of PFS,  OR, and time to death.  The combined  data showed  an objective  response  
rate for fulvestrant  of 19.2%  compared  with 16.5%  for anastrozole.  The median  time to death  
was 27.[ADDRESS_48941]  ratio of fulvestrant  250 mg to anastrozole  for time to death  was 1.01 
(95%  CI 0.86 to 1.19).  
 
Doses of fulvestrant  higher  than [ADDRESS_48942]  of care.  A phase  III clinical  trial (CONFIRM)[ADDRESS_48943]  cancer  who had disease  recurrence  on or after adjuvant  endocrine  therapy  
or progression  following  endocrine  therapy  for advanced  disease.  The study  included  423 
patients  whose  disease  had recurred  or progressed  during  antiestrogen  therapy  and 313 
patients  whose  disease  had recurred  or progressed  during  AI therapy.  This trial compared  the 
efficacy  and safety  of fulvestrant  500 mg (n=362)  vs. 250 mg (n=374).  PFS for fulvestrant  500 
mg was 6.5 months  compared  to 5.5 months  for fulvestrant  250 mg. Overall  survival  data from 
the time of final analysis  showed  a median  time to death  of 26.4 months  for fulvestrant  500 mg 
vs. 22.3 months  for fulvestrant  250 mg [HR (95%CI)  0.81 (0.69,  0.96),  p=0.016].  
 
More  recently  results  from the randomized,  double -blind,  multicenter  phase  III FALCON  
(Fulvestrant  and Anastrozo Le COmpared  in hormonal  therapy  Naïve advanced  breast  cancer)  
trial for the treatment  of locally -advanced  or metastatic  breast  cancer,  in post-menopausal  
women  who have not had prior hormonal  treatment  for hormone -receptor -positive  (HR+)  
breast  cancer  was published  in Lancet10. That trial enrolled  a total of 462 patients,  (n=230)  
were  randomized  to 500mg  intramuscular  injections  of fulvestrant  (Days  0, 14, 28, then every  
28 days),  and (n=232)  to 1mg of anastrozole  daily.  Patients  were  also allowed  one prior line of 
chemotherapy.  After a median  follow -up of 25 months,  patients  treated  with fulvestrant  had a 
statistically  significant  21% improvement  in progression -free survival  compared  to  those  
treated  with anastrozole  (16.6  months  vs. 13.8 months,  p = 0.048).  Further,  subgroup  analysis  
showed  an even greater  impact  on progression -free survival  in patients  whose  disease  had 
not spread  to the liver or lungs  at baseline  (22.3  vs. 13.8 months).  These  data therefore  support  
the use of fulvestrant  even in the first-line metastatic  setting.  
 
3.1.2  Resistance  to Endocrine  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_46401]  4/6 Inhibitors  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_46402]+ breast  cancer,  many  patients  progress  
after initial  endocrine  therapy.  Resistance  mechanisms  are incompletely  understood.  One 
mechanism  known  to contribute  to resistance  is ligand  independent  ER signaling  in the setting  
of acquired  ESR1  mutation  (ESR1  is the gene  which  codes  for the estrogen  receptor).  Highly  
recurrent  mutations  in the ESR1  ligand  binding  domain  (LBD)  (p.Tyr537Ser/Asn  and 
p.Asp538Gly)  are present  in approximately  20% of metastatic  ER+ breast  cancer  tumors  after 
treatment  with endocrine  therapy  but rarely  prior to treatment  with endocrine  therapy11,12. 
Mutant  forms  of ER mediate  clinical  resistance  to aromatase  inhibitor  therapy13. Mutant  
receptors  also require  higher  doses  of tamoxifen  or fulvestrant  to antagonize  mutant  ER 
signaling.  Two other  emerging  mechanisms  of endocrine  resistance  include  a decoupling  of

the cell cycle  control  from ER-signaling  (e.g. genetic  mechanisms  such  as CCND1  
amplification)  and alternate  proliferation  signals  via receptor  tyrosine  kinases  (RTK)  and their 
intracellular  signaling  cascades  via phosphatidylinositol  3-kinase  (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian  target  
of rapamycin  (mTOR)14-16. These  proposed  mechanisms  of endocrine  therapy  resistance  result  
in tumor  cells that have by[CONTACT_46432].  
 
While  preclinically,  oral serum  ER down -regulators  are thought  to be similar  or better  than 
fulvestrant  against  the mutant  ESR1  and many  agents  are in various  phases  of clinical  
development,  none  are approved  to date.  
 
The introduction  of CDK4/6  inhibitors  into the treatment  of ER+ breast  cancer  was supported  
by [CONTACT_46433]17. Cyclin  D proteins  are critical  in cancer  cell division  
and complex  with the CDK4  and CDK6  protein  kinases  to promote  G1 progression  by 
[CONTACT_46434]  (pRb)18. Abnormalities  that 
result  in CDK  activation  are highly  enriched  in luminal  A and B breast  cancer  subtypes,  ~85%  
of which  were  ER+/HER2 − (Cancer  Genome  Atlas Network  2012).  The luminal  subtypes  also 
maintain  expression  of pRb19, which  is essential  for benefit  from treatment  with a CDK4/6  
inhibitor.  ER+ breast  cancer  cell lines are among  the cancer  models  most  sensitive  to single  
agent  CDK4/6  inhibition  as well as to the combination  of endocrine  therapy  and CDK4/[ADDRESS_48944]  to the oral SERDs,  clinically,  CDK4/[ADDRESS_48945] recently  
demonstrated  efficacy  in ER+ breast  cancer  and have led to the FDA approval  of the first-in- 
class agent,  palbociclib.  The PALOMA -1 trial demonstrated  that the combination  of letrozole  
and palbociclib  was more  effective  than letrozole  alone  (median  PFS 20.2 months  versus  10.2 
months)  in the front line setting21. The confirmatory  phase  III randomized  PALOMA -2 study  
completed  accrual  and its results  corroborate  the benefit  of CDK4/[ADDRESS_48946]-menopausal  patients  with no prior systemic  therapy  for ER+ 
MBC  were  randomized  2:1 to receive  letrozole  with palbociclib  or letrozole  with  placebo.  
Median  PFS (primary endpoint)  was 24.8 months  vs. 14.5 months  in favor  of the palbociclib  
arm (HR=0.58  [0.46–0.72],  p < 0.000001).  Response  rate was also improved  in the palbociclib  
arm (42.1%  vs. 34.7%,  p=0.031;  55.3%  vs. 44.4%  in patients  with measurable  disease  
[p=0.013]),  and clinical  benefit  rate was 84.9%  vs. 70.3%  (p < 0.0001)22. Similarly,  the 
combination  of fulvestrant  with palbociclib  (median  PFS = 9.2 months)  in the PALOMA -3 trial

The family  of fibroblast  growth  factors  (FGFs)  and FGF receptors  (FGFRs)  plays  a critical  role 
in cell behaviours,  such  as proliferation,  differentiation,  migration  and survival,  and are 
fundamental  to embryonic  development,  regulation  of angiogenesis,  and skeletal  
development.  
 
The FGFR  family,  which  is phylogenetically  closely  related  to the VEGFRs  and PDGFRs,  
comprises  of five members,  of which  four are receptor -type tyrosine  kinases  (FGFR1 -4)24. By

alternative  splicing,  they form seven  FGFR  proteins  (FGFR1b,  FGFR1c,  FGFR2b,  FGFR2c,  
FGFR3b,  FGFR3c,  and FGFR4)  which  are expressed  in a tissue  specific  manner  and with 
differing  ligand -binding   specificities.  
 
Each of the [ADDRESS_48948] IG domains  of different  FGFR  receptors  and splice  variants  
creating  ligand  binding  specificity.  Ligand  binding  causes  receptor  dimerization,  enabling  
transphosphorylation  of intracellular  kinases  and phosphorylation  of intracellular  signaling  
proteins25. This downstream  signaling  occurs  through  two main  pathways  - the intracellular  
receptor  substrates  FGFR  substrate  2 (FRS2)  and phospholipase  C γ (PLCγ), leading  
ultimately  to upregulation  of the Ras-dependent  mitogen -activated  protein  kinase  (MAPK)  and 
Ras-independent  phosphoinositide  3-kinase  (PI3K)–Akt signaling  pathways26. 
 
FGFR  are susceptible  to be hijacked  by [CONTACT_46436].  These  receptors  are also known  to be involved  in cancer  cell 
proliferation,  angiogenesis,  cell migration,  invasion  and metastasis.  Activation  of FGFRs  as a 
result  of amplification,  mutation  or translocation  of FGFR  genes  or over-expression  of FGFR  
proteins  or overproduction  of FGF ligands  has been  shown  to be oncogenic.  Genes  encoding  
FGFRs  have been  identified  as among  the most  commonly mutated  kinase  genes  in human  
cancer,  with mutations  in FGFR2  and FGFR3  being  most  prevalent27. Gene  amplification  or 
aberrant  transcriptional  regulation  can result  in receptor  overexpression,  whilst  a number  of 
point mutations  have been  identified  that produce  receptors  that are either  constitutively  active  
or exhibit  a reduced  dependence  on ligand  binding  for activation.  In addition  translocations  can 
result  in expression  of FGFR -fusion  proteins  with constitutive  FGFR  kinase  activity28. Finally,  
isoform  switching  alters  the ligand  binding  specificity  of resulting  receptors  and hence  
sensitizes  cells to FGFs  that they would  not normally  be responsive  to 29,30. 
 
Activating  oncogenic  FGFR2  mutations  confer  sensitivity  to FGFR  inhibition.  Aberrant  
expression,  amplification  and/or  overexpression  of FGF proteins,  as well as altered  gene - 
splicing  of FGFRs  represent  other  mechanisms  through  which  FGF/FGFR  signaling  can 
become  deregulated  in cancer29,31,32. 
 
Inhibition  of FGFR  may have clinical  utility  in cancers  that overexpress  FGFRs,  such  as 
breas t33,34, esophageal,  bladder35, gastric,  and lung cancers34,36, or display  a prevalence  of 
FGFR  mutation s, such  as bladder  cance r37,38. FGF/FGFR  signaling  may also serve  as an 
escape  pathway  in tumours  that are being  treated  with inhibitors  of other  cellular  signaling  
components,  such  as vascular  endothelial   growth  factor  receptor  (VEGFR).

4 amplifications  in 1% of breast  cancer.  
 
Furthermore,  ER+ luminal  B tumors  overexpressing  FGFR1  exhibited  increased  proliferation  
and decreased  distant  metastasis -free survival.  FGFR1  amplification  was also shown  to be an 
independent  predictor  of overall  survival  in patients  with ER+ breast  cancer  treated  with 
tamoxifen40. In fact, preclinical  studies  have demonstrated  that FGFR1  amplification  conferred  
resistance  to endocrine -based  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_46403]3K 
pathways.40,41 About  30-40% of breast  tumors  with FGFR1  amplification  also exhibit  
amplification  of CCND1 , FGF3/4/19  in chromosome  11q29.  This co-amplification  is also 
associated  with a reduction  of patients’  surviva l42. 
 
Based  on these  data,  several  pharmaceutical  companies  have developed  selective  and non- 
selective  FGFR  inhibitors,  focusing  their clinical  development  on tumor  subtypes  with a high 
likelihood  of dependence  on FGFR  pathway  signaling,  including  in metastatic  breast  cancer.  
 
A phase  1/2a clinical  trial of lucitanib,  a pan VEGFR,  PDGFR  and FGFR  inhibitor  in women  
with FGFR1 - or 11q (FGF3,  FGF4,  Cyclin  D1, or FGF19) -amplified  MBC  demonstrated  a 
promising  objective  response  rate [ORR]  of 50%43. However,  the larger,  phase  [ADDRESS_48951]  ORR  of 3.5%  (6/178)  and SD 29.5%.  median  PFS was 2.9 months  (95%  
CI 2.7, 3.8). Toxicities  reflected  those  of a potent  anti-angiogenic  agent  and most  frequent  
adverse  effects  were  hypertension,  fatigue,  nausea,  hypothyroidism,  and headache.  Both 
patients  with FGFR1  amplification  and/or  11q amplification  were  enrolled  and the clinical  
activity  could  not be linked  to a particular  biomarker  or selection  factor.

The orally -active  small  molecule  Debio  1347  is an ATP competitive  and highly  selective  
inhibitor  of FGFR1,  FGFR2  and FGFR3  at the low nanomolar  level in cell-free systems  (IC50:

The activity  of Debio  1347  was evaluated  in vitro in a large  panel  of human  cancer  cell lines.  
In cancer  cells,  Debio  1347  demonstrated  a similar  potent  inhibition  of phosphorylation  of 
FGFR2  and of its downstream  signaling  molecules  AKT and ERK1/2.  In addition,  Debio  [ADDRESS_48952]  and colon  cancer  cell

vitro antiproliferative  activity  in several  bladder  cancer  cell lines with FGFR3  fusions  (IC50:  18

3.3.3  Toxicology  and Safety  Pharmacology  
 
The toxicology  profile  of Debio  1347  was assessed  after single  and repeated  oral 
administration  of up to four weeks  duration  in Wistar  rats and Cynomolgus  monkeys.  In the 4- 
week  studies,  a recovery  period  of four weeks  was included  to evaluate  the reversibility  of any 
findings.  The safety  of Debio  1347  was also assessed  in a battery  of safety  pharmacology  in 
vitro and in vivo tests.  
In the single  dose  studies  in rats, a Debio  1347  dose  of 100 mg/kg  - the highest  dose  tested  - 
was well tolerated,  but slight  reductions  in body weight  and food consumption  were  observed.  
In monkeys,  except  for loose  stools  observed  in one animal  on the day after dosing,  there  were  
no observations  at 10 mg/kg.  
In the GLP 4 week  toxicity  study  in rats (0, 3, 10, 30 mg/kg/day),  no deaths  occurred at any 
Debio  [ADDRESS_48954]  dose,  30 mg/kg/day.  At 30 mg/kg/day,  thoracic  deformity  
was seen  in the general  condition  observations,  and changes  in cartilage  and bone  including  
the sternum  were  seen  in the histopathological  examinations.  Also seen  were  mineralisation  
in multiple  organs,  changes  in epi[INVESTIGATOR_46404],  and changes  in parameters  of blood  and urine  
related  to renal  function.  At 10 mg/kg/day  or less, the above -mentioned  histopathological  
changes  were  not seen;  at those  doses,  mainly  changes  in parameters  of blood  and urine  that 
suggested  effects  on bone  were  observed.  At the lowest  dose  of 3 mg/kg/day,  high blood  
TRACP -5b (tartrate -resistant  acid phosphatase  5b, a bone  resorption  marker)  was seen,  so 
the no observed  adverse  effect  level (NOAEL)  was judged  to be less than 3 mg/kg/day.  The 
NOAEL  was considered  to be lower  than 3 mg/kg/day.  
In the GLP 4-week  repeated -dose toxicity  study  in monkeys  (0, 0.4, 1.3, and 4 mg/kg/day),  no 
deaths  occurred  at any Debio  [ADDRESS_48955]  dose,  4 mg/kg/day.  At 4 mg/kg/day,  
very slight  histopathological  changes  in bone  and cartilage  and related  changes  in parameters  
of blood  and urine  were  seen,  and in one female,  very slight  histopathological  changes  in 
kidneys  were  observed.  At the middle  dose  of 1.3 mg/kg/day,  only high urinary  excretion  of 
inorganic  phosphorus  in females  was seen.  No effects  were  observed  at the lowest  dose  of 
0.4 mg/kg/day,  so that was judged  to be the no observed  adverse  effect  level in this study.  On 
the basis  of these  results,  the highest  non-severely  toxic dose  for monkeys  (HNSTD)  was set 
at 4 mg/kg/day  (NOAEL:  0.4 mg/kg/day).  The principal  target  organs  of Debio  1347  toxicity  in 
rats and monkeys  were  bone/cartilage,  epi[INVESTIGATOR_46405].  In addition,  effects  
on lymphohematopoietic  tissues,  liver and the gastrointestinal  tract were  observed.  
Mineralisation  in multiple  organs  was also seen,  with a broader  range  of organs  and tissues

affected  in rats than in monkeys.  On the other  hand,  periosteal  changes  occurred  only in 
monkeys  but not in rats. Except  for thoracic  deformity  and mineralisation  in multiple  organs  in 
rats, the changes  seen  in rats and monkeys  in the 4-week  repeated -dose  toxicity  studies  either  
reversed  or tended  to reverse  over the 4-week  recovery  period.  
The genotoxic  potential  of Debio  1347  was assessed  in several  in vitro and in vivo tests:  no 
mutagenic  potential  was observed  in the Ames  test and no increases  in structural  chromosome  
aberrations  or in polyploid  cells were  observed  in a chromosomal  aberration  test using  human  
peripheral  blood  lymphocytes.  In an in vivo micronucleus  test in rats, however,  the numbers  of 
micronucleated  immature  erythrocytes  were  slightly  increased,  suggesting  a micronucleus - 
inducing  potential.  In vitro, the principal  mechanism  of micronucleus  induction  seems  not to be 
due to abnormal  chromosome  segregation.  Based  on these  results,  Debio  [ADDRESS_48956] an in vivo phototoxic  risk based  on 1) 
an in vitro phototoxicity  test using  a fibroblast  cell line, where  the compound  was suggested  as 
a phototoxic  substance  (absorbance  wavelengths  of 200 nm to 400 nm); 2) a whole -body  
autoradiography  in rats after single  oral dose  of 1 mg/kg  of [14C]  Debio  [ADDRESS_48957]  reproduction  and development.  
In the safety  pharmacology  studies,  no effects  on the central  nervous  system or respi[INVESTIGATOR_46406]  1347  doses  up to 100 mg/kg.  Debio  1347  was a potent  
hERG  inhibitor  in vitro (IC50:  677ng/mL).  However,  in the monkey  telemetry  study,  Debio  1347  
did not modify  the blood  pressure,  heart  rate, and ECG  or body temperature  at doses  up to 10 
mg/kg.  
No carcinogenicity  studies  or local tolerance  studies  have been  conducted  to date.

3.3.4.  Clinical  data 
 
Based  on these  data a phase  [ADDRESS_48958] –in-human  trial was undertaken,  and it has now completed  
the patients’  enrollment  in the dose -escalation  portion.  
A total of [ADDRESS_48959] one dose  of Debio  1347  
and were  assessable  for safety.  Of these,  54 were  evaluable  for efficacy.  Eight  dose  levels  
had been  tested  at the time of cut-off (10, 20, 30, 40, 60,80,  110 and 150 mg daily).  
The MTD is 80mg  since  2 DLTs  were  observed  at110  mg daily.  Five patients  experienced  
DLTs:  NCI-CTCAE  Grade  2 intolerable  dry mouth  and dry eyes at 60 mg, Grade  3 
hypercalcaemia  and Grade  3 hyperamylasaemia  both at 80 mg, and Grade  3 bilirubin  increase  
and  Grade   3  hyperphosphatemia   and  Grade   3  stomatitis   in  two  patients   at  110  mg,

respectively.  At cut-off, treatment  emergent  adverse  events  (TEAEs)  had been  reported  by [CONTACT_45830].  At data cut-off, the most  common  treatment -emergent  adverse  events  (TEAE)  were  
hyperphosphatemia  (75%),  fatigue  (40%),  diarrhea  (39%),  nausea  (40%),  and inappetence  
(32%).  Eighteen  patients  (32%) experienced  a grade  ≥ 3 related  TEAE.  Twenty -eight patients  
(49%)  required  dose  modification,  primarily  due to hyperphosphatemia  and cutaneous  toxicity.  
Decreased  left ventricular  ejection  fraction  (LVEF)  was reported  in 1 patient  (Grade  2) and 2 
patients  experienced  respectively  non-clinically  significant  Grade  1 and 2 ECG  QTc 
prolongation.  
Clinical  activity  started  at the dose  of 30 mg. Five patients  had a partial  response  (PR):  an 
endometrial  cancer  patient  with FGFR1  amplification  (30 mg), a cervical  cancer  patient  with 
FGFR2  mutation  (80 mg), an urothelial  cancer  harbouring  a FGFR3 -TACC3  translocation  (80 
mg), a cholangiocarcinoma  patient  with FGFR2  mutation  (110 mg), and a colon  cancer  patient  
with FGFR2  fusion  (110 mg) and an urothelial  cancer  with FGFR3  harbouring  a FGFR3 - 
TACC3  translocation  (150 mg). An additional  10 patients  had target  regression  < 30%.  Two 
out of these  patients  had a breast  cancer.  A triple-negative  breast  cancer  patient  with FGFR1  
amplification  showed  a reduction  in the target  lesions  of 19% (40 mg), while  a HR+ Her2 - 
breast  cancer  patient  with FGFR1  amplification  showed  a reduction  in the target  lesion  of 12% 
(60 mg). 
Preliminary  PK data from 54 patients  treated  with 10-150 mg/day  during  the dose  escalation  
part indicate  that Debio  [ADDRESS_48960]-dose.  Apparent  oral clearance  (CL/F)  and volume  of distribution  
(Vz/F)  were  on average  7 L/hour  and 120 L, respectively.  Inter-patient  variability  was moderate  
to high, but PK appeared  overall  linear.  Debio  1347  mean  plasma  exposure  increased  with 
dose  in an approximately  proportional  manner  in the 10-150 mg range.  Half-life was 14 hours  
on average,  with a limited  accumulation  (1.7-fold on average)  after 28-day repeated  once  daily 
dosing.  The Debio  1347  PK profiles  and plasma  exposure  of the capsule  and tablet  
formulations  used  in the trial were  comparable.

3.4 Study  Rationale  
 
As discussed,  even after acquired  resistance  develops,  ER+ breast  cancer  cells appear  to still 
depend  on low-level ER activity  in addition  to signaling  through  sometimes  acquired  oncogenic  
signaling  pathways4. FGFR  amplification  confers  resistance   to  endocrine -based  
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].40,41 Additionally,  in ER+ breast  cancers,  most  FGFR1  amplifications  can coexist  
with 11q amplification  (CCND1,  FGF3/4/19 ). 
Ongoing  clinical  trials with FGFR  inhibitors  are being  enriched  for tumors  harboring  specific  
FGFR  mutations  and amplifications  presumed  to be highly  addicted  to this pathway.  
Preliminary  clinical  data demonstrated  that FGFR  and/or  FGF3/4/19  ligand  amplification  is 
associated  with clinical  benefit  from FGFR  inhibitors43,44, suggesting  that these  could  be 
biomarkers  of tumor  dependence  on the FGF/FGFR  pathway.  However,  the recently  presented

larger  phase  2 trial of lucitanib  did not reproduce  the promising  clinical  activity  reported  in the 
phase  1/IIa study.  Additionally,  no specific  biomarker  could  be identified  that would  benefit  from 
lucitanib  therapy.  This could  be related  to the following:  
1. Lucitanib  is a non-selective  FGFR  inhibitor  with toxicity  profile  similar  to anti-angiogenic  
therapy  
2. Patients  were  treated  with monotherapy  and not in combination  with endocrine  therapy  
 
3. Additionally,  the amplicon  containing  FGFR  (8p) in lung cancer  is more  focal;  in breast  
cancer  this amplicon  is rather  broad  and complex  and therefore  it remains  to be seen  if these  
differences  influence  the degree  of addiction  to FGFR1.  The lucitanib  trial allowed  patients  with 
11q amplification  without  co-occurring  FGFR  amplifications  to the study.  
We plan to address  these  issues  in our proposed  clinical  trial with Debio  1347  + Fulvestrant  
as follows:  
1. In 2015,  we sequenced  tumors  from approximately  [ADDRESS_48961] a large  pool of pre-identified  FGFR  amplified  
(N=87 ) and 11q amplified   co-occurring  with FGFR1  amplified  tumors  (N=35)  using  our in 
house,  next generation  sequencing  assay - MSK-IMPACT.  We will exclude  patients  with 11q 
amplification  without  co-occurring  FGFR  amplifications.  
2. We also have a lot of experience  with non-specific  and specific  FGFR  inhibitors,  including  
Debio  1347  (IRB # 13-131; PI: [INVESTIGATOR_46407]).  Preliminary  evidence  with FGFR  blockade  using  
the selective  FGFR  inhibitor,  Debio  [ADDRESS_48962] varied  in trials reported  to date 45. Although  amplification  of FGF3/4/[ADDRESS_48963]. Jorge  Reis-Filho  and plan to perform  FISH,  protein  expression  
and mRNA  expression  from fresh  tumor  biopsies  that we plan to obtain  for all patients  enrolled  
on to this study.  Beyond  this, we plan to leverage  our state  of the art molecular  profiling  
program  to help further  clarify  biomarkers  of response  and/or  resistance  in this subtype.  For 
instance,  we could  use outlier  analyses  together  with further  genomic  analyses  to attempt  to 
better  define  the subset  of tumors  for which  FGFR  amplification  represents  a driver  event.  
Hence,  we hypothesize  that combination  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_46408]  (in this 
case  Debio  1347)  along  with standard  endocrine  therapy  (such  as fulvestrant)  may lead to 
better  responses  in patients   with  ER+/  FGFR -amplified  breast  cancer.  This study  will also

3.4.1  Rationale  for the dose  of Debio  1347  
 
Based  on the preliminary  analysis  from the dose  escalation  portion  of the phase  1 study,  the 
recommended  dose  of Debio  1347  to be further  explored  in the expansion  part of the study  
was chosen  as 80mg  once  daily.  60 mg once  daily is proposed  as reduced  dose  in the case 
of intolerable  toxicity.  Due to non-overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_46409],  we plan to start with 
dose  level 1/cohort  1 also at 80mg  in this study.  A dose  de-escalation  cohort  (dose  level - 
1/60mg)  is also built in if dose  level 1 is deemed  intolerable.  Patients  in the phase  2 portion  
will be treated at the MTD/RP2D of Debio 1347 from the phase 1b portion of the study without 
concomitant  prophylaxis  for hyperphosphatemia  (see section  9.2.1).  
 
4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
This is an open -label,  single  institution,  phase  Ib/phase  II non-randomized  trial that evaluates  
the safety,  tolerability  and anti-tumor  activity  of fulvestrant  and Debio  1347  in patients  with 
ER+/HER2 - metastatic  breast  cancer  (MBC)  that are FGFR -amplified  (as confirmed  by a CLIA  
certified  laboratory).  
The phase  I portion  of this trial will have 2 dose  levels:  dose  level 1 (80mg)  and a de-escalation  
level (60mg)  if the 80mg  dose  level has intolerable  toxicities  (N= minimum  4 and maximum  
12). Fulvestrant  will be administered  intramuscularly  at standard  doses  ([ADDRESS_48965] month,  then maintenance  dosing  every  28 days,  ±3 days)  
with no dose -escalation.  Only the dose  of Debio  1347  will be de-escalated  as shown  below.  
There  will be no intra-patient  dose  escalation.  1 cycle  = 28 days.  
The Dose  Limiting  Toxicity  (DLT)  observation  period  includes  Day 1 to Day 28 of Cycle  1, plus 
the assessments  prior to drug administration  on Cycle  2, Day1.

additional  patients  will be evaluated  at this dose  level.  Patients  who withdraw  before  
completing  a full cycle  of treatment  for reasons  other  than development  of a DLT will be 
replaced.  
The phase  2 portion  will be comprised  of an optimal  Simon  two-stage  design  to determine  the 
efficacy  (defined  as clinical  benefit  rate (CBR):  proportion  of patients  who have a best overall  
response  of a complete  response,  a partial  response,  or stable  disease  (SD) for at least 24 
weeks  (SD ≥ 24 weeks)  of Debio  1347  plus fulvestrant  (N: [ADDRESS_48966] a CBR ≥ 24 weeks) . The dosage  in the phase  2 
portion  will be the RP2D  determined  in the phase  1b dose -escalation  portion.  The treatment  
schedule  and duration  in the phase  2 portion  will be identical  to the phase  1b part except  that 
concomitant  prophylaxis  for hyperphosphatemia  will not be required . Patients  enrolled  in the 
phase  1b portion  will not be eligible  for the phase  2 component.  
4.3 Intervention  
 
Fulvestrant  will be administered  according  to its approved  dose  of 500 mg intramuscularly  on 
days 1, 15, 28 and then every  28 days (+/-3 days)  thereafter.  Debio  1347  will be administered  
orally  daily (1 cycle is 28 days)  and the dose  of Debio  1347  could  be de-escalated  as detailed  
in section  4.1. The dosage  in the phase  2 portion  will be the MTD/RP2D  determined  in the 
phase  1b portion.  
Pharmacokinetic  and pharmacodynamic  data will be obtained  throughout  the phase  Ib/Phase  
II portion  of the study.  A baseline  biopsy  of a metastatic  site will be required,  with the acquisition  
of at least [ADDRESS_48967]. Jorge  Reis- 
Filho.  
Plasma  will also be serially  obtained,  for measurement  of plasma  cell-free tumor  DNA (cfDNA)  
at baseline,  at Cycle  1 Day 15, Cycle  3 Day 1 and at disease  progression.  This would  allow  us 
to determine  biomarkers  of response  and/or  resistance  associated  with FGFR  inhibition.

9.1 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION PLAN 
 
This is an open -label,  single  institution,  phase  Ib/phase  II non-randomized  trial that evaluates  
the safety,  tolerability  and anti-tumor  activity  of fulvestrant  and Debio  1347  in patients  with 
ER+/HER2 - metastatic  breast  cancer  (MBC)  that are FGFR -amplified  (as confirmed  by a CLIA  
certified  laboratory).

The phase  I portion  of this trial will evaluate  2 dose  cohorts  (dose  level 1 (starting  dose  level)  
80mg  Debio  1347,  and dose  level -1, 60mg  Debio  1347).  Fulvestrant  will be administered  at 
standard  doses.  Only the dose  of Debio  1347  will be de-escalated  as per section  4.1. 
Phase  2 portion:  The phase  2 portion  will be comprised  of an optimal  Simon  two-stage  design  
to determine  the efficacy  of Debio  1347  plus fulvestrant  (N: [ADDRESS_48986] a CBR  ≥ 24 weeks) . The dosage  in the phase  2 
portion  will be the MTD/RP2D  determined  in the phase  1b portion  (80mg  daily) , except  that 
concomitant  prophylaxis  for hyperphosphatemia  will not be required.  
 
1 cycle:  [ADDRESS_48987] visit (including  follow -up) will be recorded.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_48988]  pain, nausea,  vomiting,  constipation  and diarrhea,  and 
granulocyte  colony -stimulating  factors  (G-CSF)  are allowed  as per the Investigator ’s decision.  
Since  drugs  that alter gastric  pH (e.g.,  proton  pump  inhibitors,  histamine  receptors  antagonists,  
antacids)  may interfere  with the absorption  of Debio  1347,  they should  be administered  at least 
2 hours  after Debio  1347  administration.  
Treatment  of pain should  be done  according  to severity  and recommended  drugs.  Study - 
specific  guidelines  will be provided  separately.  
Concomitant  radiotherapy  may only be given  for the control  of bone  pain or as indicated  to 
30% of the bone  marrow.  Irradiated  lesions  will not be evaluable  for response.  Radiotherapy  
should  start no sooner  than 24 hours  after the previous  dose  of Debio  1347,  and study  
treatment  may be resumed  with the resolution  of any radiation  toxicity  to ≤ grade  1. 
Any other  medication  necessary  for the well-being  of the patient  (with the exception  of those  
mentioned  as prohibited/excluded  concomitant  medications,  see Section  below)  may be given  
at the Investigator ’s discretion.  Particular  attention  should  be paid to treatment  that could  
influence  the intended  effects  or mask  side effects  of treatment.

for premenopausal  women.  
• Concurrent  use of hormones  for non-cancer -related  conditions  (e.g.,  insulin  for diabetes)  
is acceptable.  
• Immunosuppressive  medications  including,  but not limited  to systemic  corticosteroids  
(>10 mg/day  prednisone  or equivalent),  methotrexate,  azathioprine,  and tumor  necrosi s

In nonclinical  studies,  Debio  [ADDRESS_48990]  lenses,  and the patient  should  be monitored.  
 
Although  the possibility  of Debio  1347  affecting  cardiac  function  in nonclinical  studies  is low, 
caution  should  be exercised  when  using  Debio  1347  with drugs  with a known  risk of QTc 
prolongation  (see Arizona  CERT  database  at website  ttp://www.crediblemeds.org/).  
The hepatic  oxidative  metabolism  of Debio  1347  has been  shown  in vitro to be mainly  mediated  
by [CONTACT_097] 4F3b,  with no or only minor  contribution  of other  metabolic  enzymes.  Furthermore,  
according  to bi-directional  permeability  experiments  in Caco -2 cells,  Debio  1347  is not a 
substrate  of P-glycoprotein  (P-gp) or breast  cancer  resistance  protein  (BCRP)  efflux  
transporters.  Therefore,  based  on current  knowledge,  Debio  [ADDRESS_48991],  as per in vitro results available  
so far and Debio  1347  plasma  exposure  achieved  in patients,  Debio  1347  is considered  at 
possible  risk of perpetrating  drug-drug interactions  through  CYP3A  inhibition,  CYP3A  induction  
(some  transporters  such  as P-gp might  also be co-induced),  CYP1A2  repression,  or inhibition  
of several  transporters  (P-gp, BCRP,  multidrug  and toxin extrusion  protein  1 [MATE1],  organic  
cation  transporter  2 [OCT2];  bile salt export  pump  [BSEP]  is also 
inhibited).  
The clinical  impact  of these  in vitro observations  is not known.  While  patients  are not 
precluded  from receiving  any drugs   based  upon  the potential  for a PK drug interaction,  
patients  who are taking  concurrent  drugs  that are known  substrates  of either  CYP3A,  
CYP1A2,  P-gp, BCRP,  MATE1  or OCT2  should  be  carefully  monitored.  
Notably,  due to the irreversible  nature  of CYP3A  inhibition  by [CONTACT_46445]  1347  and also its in vitro 
potential    for  enzyme   induction,   it  should   be  noticed   that  the  potential    for  drug-drug

interactions  with CYP3A  substrates  (and possibly  also with P-gp substrates)  is time- 
dependent;  it may increase  with time as patients  continue  to take Debio  1347,  and it may 
persist  for some  days after Debio  [ADDRESS_48992] of drugs  that are sensitive  or narrow -therapeutic -range  substrates  of CYP3A,  CYP1A2,

9.2 Supportive  Care  
 
The following  are the supportive  care guidelines  for the study:  
 
9.2.1  Hyperphosphataemia   prevention  
 
• All treated  patients  should  receive  adequate  instructions  concerning  dietary  phosphate  
restriction.  The main  natural  sources  of phosphate  are: 
▪ Dairy  products  (milk,  cheese,  ice-cream,  yogurt)  
▪ Meat 
▪ Dried  beans  
▪ Peas  
▪ Nuts and peanut  butter  
▪ Wholegrains  
▪ Cola 
• During  the dose -escalation  phase  of the debio  1347  trial, only 50% of patients  
needed  to be treated  with phosphate  chelators.  In the expansion  phase,  three  
patients  did recieve  prophylactic  sevelamer,  and there  was no clear  difference  with 
regard  phosphate  levels  in these  patients.  In view of the side-effects  associated  with 
use of phosphate  chelators,  prophylaxis  will not be required  in phase  2 portion  of the 
study.  Phosphate  levels  will be measured  on cycle  1 D4 (+/-1 day),  and treated  
according  to the guidelines  provided  in section  9.4.2.  At the time of this amendment,  
all patients  on the phase  [ADDRESS_48993]  of care.  Since  drugs  that alter 
gastric   pH  (e.g.,   proton   pump   inhibitors,   histamine   receptors   antagonists,   antacids)  may

IRB Number: 17 -379 A(7)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_48994] 2 hours  after 
Debio  1347  administration.  
9.2.3  Haematological  support  
 
• The use of red blood  cell transfusions  will be permitted  as clinically  indicated  during  the 
study.  
• The use of bone  marrow  colony  stimulating  factors  (such  as granulocyte  colony - 
stimulating  factor  or granulocyte -macrophage  colony -stimulating  factor) is permitt ed as 
clinically  indicated.  Prophylactic  use is prohibited.  
9.2.4  Infections  
 
• CR-BSI (Catheter -Related  Bloodstream  Infection)  should  be managed  according  
current  Clinical  Practice  Guidelines46. 
• Febrile  neutropenia:  Antibacterial  and antifungal  prophylaxis  for fever  and treatment  of 
neutropenia  should  be managed  according  the current  Clinical  Practice  Guidelines  47,48 . 
• MSRA  (Methicillin -Resistant  Staphylococcus  Aureus)  infection  should  be managed  
according  the current  Clinical  Practice  Guidelines49. 
9.2.5  Pain 
 
• The management  of pain should  be done  according  to severity  and recommended  
drugs.  
9.2.6  Hypercalcaemia   prophylaxis  
 
Patients  with asymptomatic  hypercalcaemia  do not require  immediate  treatment  if calcium  
remains  < 12 mg/dL  (3 mmol/L).  However,  the patient  should  be advised  to avoid  factors  that 
can aggravate  hypercalcaemia  (such  as thiazide  diuretics,  volume  depletion,   prolonged  bed 
rest or inactivity,  and a high calcium  diet [> 1000  mg/day]).  
Adequate  hydration  (at least 6 to 6 glasses  of water  per day) is recommended  to minimise  the 
risk of nephrolithiasis.  
9.2.7  Prophylaxis  for skin toxicity  and alopecia  
 
Guidelines  for prophylaxis  are detailed  in Appendix  A. 
 
9.3 Dose -limiting  toxicity  during  Phase  1 
 
The following  AEs or laboratory  abnormalities,  graded  according  to NCI-CTCAE  version  4, 
are considered  to be DLTs  when  occurring  during  the DLT evaluation  period  (Day  1 to Day 
28 of Cycle  1, plus the assessments  prior to drug administration  on Cycle  2, Day 1 and the 
Investigator  feels  are possibly,  probably,  or definitely  related  to Debio  1347  excluding  those  
that are clearly  and incontrovertibly  due to disease  progression  or extraneous  causes.:

• Grade  4 neutropenia  persisting  for more  than 7 days.  
• Grade  4 thrombocytopenia  persisting  for more  than 7 days or Grade  3 
thrombocytopenia  requiring  platelet  transfusion.  
• Grade  3 diarrhea,  constipation,  nausea,  vomiting  or skin toxicity  that lasts longer  than 
72 hours  despi[INVESTIGATOR_46413].  
• Any Grade  4 diarrhea,  constipation,  nausea,  vomiting  or skin toxicity.  
• Grade  3 or higher  liver function  tests (ALT,  AST,  ɣGPT)  and ALP unless  as clarified  
below  
• Grade  3 or higher  non-hematologic  toxicity  including  Hy’s law: AST and/or  ALT > 3x 
ULN and bilirubin  > 2x ULN,  and without  initial  findings  of cholestasis  (serum  alkaline  
phosphatase  (ALP)  activity  < 2x ULN)  and no other  reason  that could  explain  the 
combination  of increased  transaminases  and serum  total bilirubin,  such  as viral 
hepatitis  A, B, or C, preexisting  or acute  liver disease  (including  preexisting  liver 
metastases),  or another  drug capable  of causing  the observed  injury.  
• The following  non-hematologic  AEs are not considered  DLTs:  
a. Grade  3 electrolyte  abnormalities  lasting  <24 to 72 hours,  is not clinically  
complicated,  and resolves  spontaneously  or responds  to conventional  medical  
interventions;  and ≥ Grade  3 amylase  or lipase  that is not associated  with symptoms  
or clinical  manifestations  of pancreatitis.  
b. Grade  3 or higher  of ALP clearly  related  to bone  metastases  evolution.  The 
relationship  should  be discussed  with the study  Medical  Monitor  on a case  by [CONTACT_46446].  
• Hyperphosphataemia:  
a. Serum  Pi > 7.0 mg/dL  for > [ADDRESS_48995] 14 days.  
b. Serum  Pi > 9.0 mg/dL,  despi[INVESTIGATOR_46414] 14 days.  
c. Serum  Pi > 10.0 mg/dL.  
• Any treatment  delay  more  than 7 days because  of treatment -related  AEs or 
laboratory  abnormalities  occurring  during  the DLT period.  
• Any other  life-threatening  toxicity.  
• Other  AEs considered  intolerable  by [CONTACT_737].  
• Death  not clearly  due to the underlying  disease  or extraneous  causes  
 
Patients  experiencing  a DLT during  the DLT period  may continue  treatment  after treatment  
adjustments  if there  is a potential  benefit  from treatment.  
9. 4 Dose  Modifications  or Scheduling  Delays  
 
• This study  will use the NCI Common  Toxicity  Criteria  (CTC)  AE version  4.0 for toxicity.  
• Study  treatment  will be temporarily  or permanently  discontinued  due to the 
occurrence  of AEs as specified  in Table  1 below,  for both the phase  1 and 2 portions  
of this study.  
• Additionally,   non-treatment  related  or unexpected  toxicities  may require  interruption  of 
therapy  at the discretion  of the Investigator.

• Failure  to recover  to the specified  levels  following  temporary  discontinuation  within  7 
days in the phase  1b portion  and 14 days in the phase  2 portion  will result  in 
permanent  treatment  discontinuation.  The treating  Investigator  and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_46415] 7 or 14 
days,  respectively,  who they think may benefit  from continued  treatment,  prior to 
resuming  treatment.  
• In addition,  if Grade  2 or higher  toxicity  occurs,  treatment  may be temporarily  
discontinued  at the discretion  of the Investigator.  The patients  may resume  at the 
same  dose  level when  toxicity  has resolved  to Grade  1 or below  or the baseline  level 
if resolution  is achieved  within  7 days in the phase  1b part and 14 days in the phase  2 
part. 
• In the event  the patient  requires  temporary  treatment  discontinuation,  the Investigator  
may choose  to increase  the frequency  of the assessments  performed  to weekly  
collections  until resolution.  
• Only in the phase  2 portion,  one dose  reduction  can be undertaken  except  for dose  
level -1 (60mg).  Patients  resuming  treatment  following  a temporary  discontinuation  
can do so at their original  dose  level or at one lower  dose  level.  
• Patients  experiencing  a DLT during  the DLT period  may continue  treatment  after 
dose  adjustments  if there  is a potential  benefit  from treatment  after discussion  with 
the PI 
• Patients  will be permanently  discontinued  if reduction  beyond  <60mg/day  is 
necessary  in both phase  1 and phase  2 portions  of the study  
• Reduced  doses  may not be re-escalated.  
• If a patient  discontinues  Debio  1347  purely  due to toxicity,  they can stay on study  and 
continue  to receive  fulvestrant.  The patient  will be captured  as coming  off of Debio  
1347  due to toxicity  and report  TTF.

 GENERAL  RECOMMENDATIONS 
• In subjects  whose  serum  phosphorus   control  improves   after Debio  1347  dose  reduction,   de- 
escalation  of the hyperphosphatemia   treatment  can be considered  at the discretion  of the 
Investigator.   Subsequent   to any such  adjustment,  serum  phosphorus   level  should  be 
reassessed  within  7 days.  
• In case  of subjects  with hepatic  or renal  impairment,   it is recommended   not to change  
hyperphosphatemia   treatment  even  in the case  of Debio  1347  dose  reduction.   
 
 
 • Add treatment  with oral acetazolamide  250mg  twice  a day 
• Reassess  serum  phosphorus   level  within  7 days:  
o If serum  phosphorus   level < 5.5 mg/dL,  resume  Debio  1347  with 
dose  reduction  
Note:  • Sevelamer   should  be preferably   taken  in the mid of meals  
• Lanthanum   carbonate  should  be taken  just after meals  
• Sevelamer   and lanthanum  must  be administered  at least  2 hours  after or 
4 hours  before   Debio  1347  
• Acetazolamide  should  be preferably   taken  just after breakfast   and dinner

9.4.4  Guidelines  for significant  QTc prolongation  
 
Significant  QTc prolongation  is defined  as an interval  > 500 ms or an interval  which  increases  
by 60 ms over baseline.  
If the prolongation  is confirmed  on 2 out of the 3 ECGs  by [CONTACT_46448]  (i.e., QTc interval  > 
500 ms or > 60 ms increase  from baseline)  treatment  with Debio  1347  should  be stopped  
and the following  actions  will be taken:

• The patient  will be withdrawn  from Debio  1347  treatment.  
• The patient  will be monitored,  treated  appropriately,  and closely  followed  (ECGs  at 
least three  times  per week)  until the QT and QTc interval  return  to within  [ADDRESS_48997]  replacement  strategy  
 
• Patients  not eligible  for the MTD/RP2D  determination  of the phase  1b portion  will be 
replaced  (see section  12.3.3)  
• Patients  not eligible  for efficacy  evaluation  for the Phase  II portion  of the study  will 
also be replaced

with an AE of Grade  > [ADDRESS_49001]. 
10.1.3  End-of-Treatment  Criteria  
 
Treatment  with Debio  1347  will continue  until any of the following  occur:  
 
• Patient  withdraws  consent.  
• Disease  progression  documented  by [CONTACT_3610],  physical  exam  or other  objective  
method  of measurement.  An exception  could  be made  for patients  who progressed  
due to brain  metastases;  patients  may continue  treatment  with Debio  1347  if, in the 
Investigator ’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649],  there  was reasonable  evidence  of ongoing  clinical  benefit.  
• Unacceptable  toxicity.  
• Pregnancy.  
• Patient's  interests  as judged  by [CONTACT_737].  
• In the event  of a Debiopharm  International  SA decision  to no longer  supply  study  
drug,  ample  notification  will be provided  so that appropriate  adjustments  to subject  
treatment  can be made.  
Patients  who are removed  from study  treatment  due to AEs are to be treated  and followed -up 
according  to accepted  medical  practice.  All pertinent  information  concerning  the outcome  of 
such  treatment  will be recorded.

Patients  will undergo  the EOT assessment  and exit from the study,  unless  they are prematurely  
discontinued  from the study  for any of the following  reasons:  
1. Patient  requests  to leave  the study.  
 
2. Adverse  event,  e.g. intercurrent  illness  that would,  in the judgment  of the Investigator,  affect  
assessments of clinical  status  to a significant  degree;  or intercurrent  illness  that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_46417].  
 
3. Patient  non-compliance.  
 
4. Patient  lost to follow -up. 
 
5. If, in the Investigators  opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649],  continuation  in the trial would  be detrimental  to the patient’s 
wellbeing.  
6. A major  protocol  violation  occurs.  
 
7. Prohibited  medication  as indicated  in Section  9 is required/used  during  the course  of the 
trial. In the event  a patient  is found  to be taking  a prohibited  medication  during  the trial, the site 
should  immediately  contact  [CONTACT_46449].  The decision  to withdraw  the patient  will be 
made  in conjunction  with the Sponsor.  
 
8. Non-drug related  reason;  e.g. patient  relocates  too far from study  centre.  
 
9. Study  is terminated.  
 
Should  a patient  be withdrawn,  EOT assessments  should  be performed  prior to any further  
therapeutic  intervention  whenever  possible.  Results  of these  assessments  will be recorded  
together  with a description  of the reasons  for study  discontinuation.  
10.1.5  Correlative  analyses  
 
Plasma  samples  for pharmacokinetics  (PK) will be collected  during  both phase  1 and 2. Phase  
1 PK will be collected  prior to dosing  on day 1 and 15 of cycle  1 and then day 1 of each  cycle  
thereafter.  Phase  2 PK will be collected  prior to dosing  on day 15 of cycle 1  and day 1 of cycle  
2. These  samples  may be analyzed  by [CONTACT_29864]-MS/MS  to assess  the PK (trough  levels  at steady - 
state)  of both fulvestrant  and Debio  1347  in combination.  These  data will be compared  with 
historical  PK data in monotherapy  (Faslodex®  prescribing  information;  PK results  from Study  
Debio  1347 -101),  in order  to investigate  potential  PK interactions  and to support  interpretation  
of safety  and/or  efficacy  results  in the trial, and tumor  specimens  will be studied.  
Archival  tissue  will be obtained,  whenever  available  as well. 
 
Baseline  tumor  biopsies  will be obtained.  We will perform  FISH,  protein  and mRNA  expression  
analyses  from formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded  tissue  samples  in the laboratory  of [CONTACT_46471]-Filho  along  with the MSKCC  Integrated  Genomics  Operation  (IGO)  and MSKCC  Molecular  
Cytogenetics  Core  facilities.

1) FGFR1  FISH  will be performed  as follows:  FGFR1  amplification  will be assessed  using  the 
ZytoLight  SPEC  FGFR1/CEN  8 Dual Color  Probe  (ZytoVision,  Bremerhaven,  [LOCATION_013]).  Tissue  
processing,  hybridization,  post-hybridization  washing,  and fluorescence  detection  will be 
performed  according  to standard  lab procedures.  Slides  will be scanned  using  a Zeiss  Axioplan  
2i epi[INVESTIGATOR_46418] a CCD  camera  (CV-M4+CL,  JAI) controlled  by [CONTACT_46450] 
5.5.9  (MetaSystems  Group  Inc.).  Marked  region(s)  within  a given  tissue  section  will be scanned  
at 63X or 100X  and at least five images  per representative  region  captured,  each  image  being  a 
compressed  stack  of 12 z-section  images  taken  at 0.5 µm intervals.  Signal  counts  will be 
performed  on the captured  images  and a minimum  of 100 discrete  nuclei  scored. Amplification  
will be defined  as >10 copi[INVESTIGATOR_46419]  (>4 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014];  representing  tandem  duplications/repeats).  Tumors  will be considered  as FGFR1 - 
amplified  under  one of the following  conditions:  a) The FGFR1/CEN8  ratio is ≥2.0;  b) Average  
number  of FGFR1  signals  per tumor  cell nucleus  is ≥6; or c) Presence  of large  or small cluster  
of signals  FGFR 1/CEN8  ratio will be also reported  as a continuous  variable.  
2) Immunohistochemistry : the expression  of FGFR1  at the protein  level will be assessedusing 
immunoh istochemistry, using the monoclonal D8E4 antibody (Cell Signaling, [LOCATION_011], MA). 
Antibody  dilution  and antigen  retrieval  is currently   being  optimized.  Stained  slides   will be 
analyzed  in a semi  quantitative  manner  using  the H score  method.  
3) mRNA  expression : We will quantify  the mRNA  expression  levels  of FGFR1  along  with other  
key targets  using  Nanostring.  RNA will be extracted  the RNAeasy  Mini Kit (Qiagen)  according  to 
the manufacturers'  instructions.  One hundred  ng of total RNA will be hybridized  to a custom  
designed  gene  CodeSet  (non-enzymatic  RNA profiling  using  barcoded  fluorescent  probes)  
according  to the manufacturers  protocol  (Nanostring  Technologies).  Barcodes  will be counted  
(600 fields  of view per sample)  on an nCounter  Digital  Analyzer  following  the manufacturer’s  
instructions  (NanoString®  Technologies)  and normalized  to housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_46420].  Further  
analysis  will follow  previously  published  methods  to identify  the range  of FGFR1  expression  
levels,  which  will be compared  to IHC and FISH  findings.

12.0 CRITERIA  FOR THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  
 
Tumor  response  is based  on the RECIST  v.1.1.  A copy of the full article  is provided  as 
Appendix  B. Key elements  of the criteria  are summarized  below.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_49003]  v.1.1 provides  the following  definitions  for designating  the tumor  lesion/lymph  node  
as measurable  or non-measurable  at baseline.  
 
12.1.1  Measurable  Lesions  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Tumor  Lesions  
 
Must be accurately  measured  in at least one dimension  (longest  diameter  in the plane  of 
measurement  is to be recorded)  with a minimum  size as follows:  
o [ADDRESS_49004] scan  (CT scan  slice thickness  no greater  than 5 mm; see Appendix  II of 
Eisenhauer  et al, 2009  for imaging  guidance)  
o 10 mm caliper  measurement  by [CONTACT_40133]  (lesions  which  cannot  be accurately  
measured  with caliper  should  be recorded  as non-measurable)  
o [ADDRESS_49005]  X-ray

[IP_ADDRESS]  Malignant   Lymph  Nodes  
 
To be considered  pathologically  enlarged  and measurable,  a lymph  node  must  be ≥ [ADDRESS_49006] scan  (CT scan  slicethickness recommended  to be no greater  
than 5 mm). At baseline  and in follow -up, only the short  axis will be measured  and followed.  
For additional  information  on lymph  node  measurement,  see notes  in Eisenhauer  et al, 2009  
under  the heading  “Baseline  documentation  of target  and non-target  lesions,”  as well as a 
companion  paper  on lymph  node  assessment  using  RECIST  50. 
 
12.1.2  Non-measurable  Lesions  
 
Non-measurable  lesions  are all other  lesions,  including  small  lesions  (longest  diameter  < 10 
mm or pathological  lymph  nodes  with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short  axis) as well as truly non- 
measurable  lesions.  Truly  non-measurable  lesions  include  leptomeningeal  disease,  ascites,  
pleural  or pericardial  effusions,  inflammatory  breast  disease,  lymphangitic  involvement  of skin 
or lung, and abdominal  masses/abdominal  organomegaly  identified  by [CONTACT_46451].  
 
12.1.3  Special  Considerations  Regarding  Lesion  Measurability  
 
Bone  lesions,  cystic  lesions,  and lesions  previously  treated  with local therapy  require  
particular  comment.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Bone  Lesions  
 
Bone  scan,  PET scan,  or plain films are not considered  adequate  imaging  techniques  to 
measure  bone  lesions.  However,  these  techniques  can be used  to confirm  the presence  or 
disappearance  of bone  lesions.  
Lytic bone  lesions  or mixed  lytic-blastic  lesions,  with identifiable  soft tissue  components,  that 
can be evaluated  by [CONTACT_12783] -sectional  imaging  techniques  such  as CT or MRI can be considered  
as measurable  lesions  if the soft tissue  component  meets  the definition  of measurability  
described  above.  
 
Blastic  bone  lesions  are non-measurable.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cystic  Lesions  
 
Lesions  that meet  the criteria  for radiographically  defined  simple  cysts  should  not be 
considered  as malignant  lesions  (i.e., neither  measurable  nor non-measurable)  since  they are, 
by [CONTACT_108],  simple  cysts.  
Cystic  lesions  thought  to represent  cystic  metastases  can be considered  as measurable  
lesions  if they meet  the definition  of measurability  described  above.  However,  if non-cystic  
lesions  are present  in the same  individual,  these  are preferred  for selection  as target  lesions.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Lesions  with Prior Local  Treatment  
 
Tumor  lesions  situated  in a previously  irradiated  area,  or in an area subjected  to other  loco- 
regional  therapy,  are usually  not considered  measurable  unless  there  has been  
demonstrated  progression  in the lesion.  
 
12.1.4  Methods  of Tumor  Measurement  
 
Please  refer to Eisenhauer  et al, 2009,  Section  3.2 for details  concerning  details  of how 
measurements  of lesions/lymph  nodes  should  be done.  For the current  study,  CT is the only 
acceptable  measurement  method.  
 
12.2 Tumor  Response   Evaluation  
 
12.2.1  Designation  of Target  and Non-Target  Lesions  
 
When more  than one measurable  lesion  is present  at baseline,  all lesions,  up to a maximum  
of 5 lesions  (and a maximum  of 2 lesions  per involved  organ)  representative  of all involved  
organs  should  be identified  as target  lesions  and will be recorded  and measured  at baseline.  
In the current  study,  the baseline  measurement  will be based  on the scans  and measurements  
taken  at the end of the pre-study  standard  chemotherapy,  as submitted  by [CONTACT_093].  
Target  lesions  should  be selected  on the basis  of their size (lesions  with longest  diameter)  and 
be representative  of all involved  organs,  but in addition  should  be those  that lend themselves  
to reproducible  repeated  measurements.  It may be the casethat on occasion,  the largest  lesion  
does not lend itself to reproducible  measurement;  in such cases,  the next largest  lesion  that 
can be reproducibly  measured  should  be selected.  
A sum of the diameters  (longest  for non-nodal  lesions,  short  axis for nodal  lesions)  for all target  
lesions  will be calculated  and reported  as the baseline  sum diameters.  The baseline  sum 
diameters  will be used  as the reference  to characterize  any objective  changes  in the 
measurable  dimension  of disease.  
All other  lesions  or sites of disease  (i.e., non-measurable  lesions),  including  pathological  lymph  
nodes,  should  be identified  as non-target  lesions.  Measurements  of non-target  lesions,  even if 
measurable,  are not required,  as they are intended  to be assessed  qualitatively  and should  be 
designated  as present  or absent  at baseline.  It is also possible  to record  multiple  non-target  
lesions  in the same  organ  as a single  item,  e.g., “multiple  enlarged  pelvic  lymph  nodes.”  
 
12.2.2  Definitions  of Response  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Target  Lesions  
 
Definitions  of response  for individual  patients  at each  assessment  time point for target  
lesions  are shown  in Table  2.

CR Disappearance  of all target  lesions.  Any pathological  lymph  nodes  (whether  target  or non- 
target)  must  have  reduction  in short  axis  to < [ADDRESS_49007] a 30% decrease  in the sum of diameters  of target  lesions, taking  as reference  the 
baseline  sum diameters.  
PD At least a 20% increase  in the sum of diameters  of target  lesions,  taking  as reference  the 
smallest  sum on study  (this includes  the baseline  sum if that is the smallest  on study).  In 
addition  to the relative   increase  of 20%,  the sum must  also demonstrate  an absolute  increase  of 
at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance  of one or more  new lesions  is also considered  
progression).  For this study , PD should  be confirmed  at least  [ADDRESS_49008]  sum diameters  while  on study

[IP_ADDRESS].1  Special  Notes  on Designation  of Progression  in Non-Target  Disease  
 
The concept  of progression  of non-target  disease  in the setting  of concurrent  measurable  
disease  as in this study  requires  further  explanation.  In this setting,  to assign  unequivocal  
progression  on the basis  of the non-target  disease  (see determination  of overall  response  in 
Section  0), there  must  be an overall  level of substantial  worsening  in non-target  disease  such 
that, even in the presence  of SD or PR in the target  disease,  the overall  tumor  burden  has 
increased  sufficiently  to warrant  discontinuation  of therapy  (see examples  in the RECIST  v.1.1 
guidelines  in Appendix  B). A modest  increase  in the size of one or more  non-target  lesions  is 
usually  not sufficient  to qualify  for a designation  as unequivocal  progression.  The designation  
of overall  progression  solely  on the basis of change  in non-target  disease  in the face of SD or 
PR of target  disease  will therefore  be extremely  rare. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  New Lesions  
 
The appearance  of new malignant  lesions  denotes  disease  progression.  Refer  to RECIST  
v.1.1 in Appendix  B for notes  concerning  the detection  of new lesions.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Missing  Data 
 
When  no imaging/measurement  is done  at all at a particular  time point,  the subject  is not 
evaluable  (NE) at that time point.  If only a subset  of lesion  measurements  is made  at an 
assessment,  usually  the case  is also considered  NE at that time point,  unless  a convincing  
argument  can be made  that the contribution  of the individual  missinglesions would  not change  
the assigned  time point response.  This would  be most  likely to happen  in the case  of PD. For 
example,  if a subject  had a baseline  sum of [ADDRESS_49011] achieved  PD status  regardless  of the contribution  of the missing  lesion  measurement.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_49012]  v.1.1,  patients  with a global  deterioration  of health  status  requiring  discontinuation  
of  treatment   without   objective   evidence   of  disease  progression   should   be  reported   as

progression  even after discontinuation  of treatment.  Symptomatic  deterioration  is not a 
descriptor  of an objective  response;  it is a reason  for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_46422].  The objective  
response  of such  subjects  is to be determined  by [CONTACT_46452]-target  disease  
as shown  in Table  17 and Table  18. In the current  study,  scans  are to be done  every  3 cycles  
and at any time deemed  appropriate  by [CONTACT_093]  (i.e., when  progression  is suspected).  
PD at first response  scan  must  be confirmed  at least 4 weeks  later.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Overall  Response  for Each  Subject  at Each  Assessment  Time  Point  
 
Overall  response  at each  assessment  time point  is based  on the totality  of the responses  for 
target  and non-target  lesions,  as shown  in Table  19.

14.0 BIOSTATISTICS 
 
Phase  I: The phase  I portion  of this trial will evaluate  2 dose  cohorts  including  1 de-escalation  
cohort  (N= minimum  4 and maximum  12) as shown  in the table below.  Only the dose  of Debio  
1347  will be de-escalated.  There  will be no intra-patient  dose  escalation.  1 cycle  = 28 days.  
The Dose  Limiting  Toxicity  (DLT)  observation  period  includes  Day 1 to Day 28 of Cycle  1, plus 
the assessments  prior to drug administration  on Cycle  2, Day1.  
 
Cohort/Dose   level  Debio  1347  Fulvestrant  
-1 60mg  500mg  IM 
1 (Starting  dose  cohort)  80mg  500mg  IM 
 
 
If none  or one of the initial  3 patients  in dose  level 1 has DLT,  3 additional  patients  will be 
treated  at the same  dose  level.  If 2 or more  patients  experience  DLT at this dose  level,  then 
dose  level -1 will be evaluated.  Should  2 or more  patients  experience  DLT at dose  level -1, the 
study  will stop accrual.  If only 1 of the 3 initial  patients  experiences  a DLT at dose  level -1, 3 
additional  patients  will be evaluated  at this dose  level.  Patients  who withdraw  before  
completing  a full cycle  of treatment  for reasons  other  than development  of a DLT will be 
replaced.  
Selected  non-hematologic  and hematologic  toxicities,  as measured  by [CONTACT_46455]  4.0, will be described  by [CONTACT_46456],  by [CONTACT_46457],  with the 
maximum  grade  over all cycles  used  as the summary  measure  per patient.    In a descriptive  
secondary  analysis,  clinical  benefit  rate will be estimated  by [CONTACT_2715].  
 
We anticipate  accruing  1-2 patients/month  in the phase  1b portion  of the study.  
 
Phase  II:  The purpose  of the phase  II portion  of the study  is to evaluate  the efficacy  of this 
regimen,  using  the MTD/RP2D  as determined  in the Phase  Ib part of the trial.  Efficacy  will be 
measured  by [CONTACT_46458]: proportion  of patients  who have a best overall  response

of a complete  response,  a partial  response,  or stable  disease  (SD) for at least 24 weeks  (SD 
≥ 24 weeks)  i.e. (CR+PR+SD  >=24  weeks).   In the PALOMA -3 trial where  ER+ MBC  patients  
were  randomized  to fulvestrant  plus palbociclib  versus  fulvestrant,  the CBR  (ORR  + SD > 24 
weeks)  was 34%(95%  CI, 29.0 to 39.3)   vs 19% (95%  CI, 13.4 to 25.6).   There  is no historic  
data available  for patients  who have progressed  on palbociclib.  Since  this trial will allow  
patients  who have received  prior palbociclib,  it was decided  that a target  clinical  benefit  rate 
below  10% will not be worthy  of further  consideration  and a response  rate of 25% will be 
considered  promising.  
Simon’s  two-stage  optimal  design  will be used  to study  the treatment  efficacy  since  it permits  
early termination  of the study.  We will allow  early termination  only if the data at the first stage  
indicate  that the treatment  is highly  inactive.   18 patients  will initially  enter  the study.   If there  
are 2 or fewer  patients  with clinical  benefit  (CR, PR or SD>=24)  observed,  the study  will be 
terminated  early and declared  to have a negative  result.   If [ADDRESS_49017] a positive  result  and this regimen  would  be considered  worthy  of further  
testing  in this disease.  The probability  of early termination  is 0.73 if the true clinical  benefit  
probability  is < 10%.  This design  would  effectively  discriminate  between  true clinical  benefit  
rates  of < 10% and > 25%.   This design  has 80% power  and a type I error of 5%. 
 
Upon  completion  of the study,  the true clinical  benefit  rate will be estimated  via the observed  
rate and an exact  confidence  interval  will be constructed.  
The maximum  of 43 patients  requires  about  2 years  of patient  accrual  with an anticipated  
enrollment  of 1-2 patients  per month.  
In secondary analyses  for the Phase  Ib portion  of the trial, the ORR  will be summarized  as a 
proportion  with a 95% exact  confidence  interval.  TTP,  PFS and OS will be evaluated  using  
Kaplan -Meier  methods.   All toxicities  as measured  by [CONTACT_46459]  4.0, will be 
described  by [CONTACT_46456],  by [CONTACT_46457],  with the maximum  grade  over 
all cycles used  as the summary  measure  per patient.  All patients  will be included  in the safety  
analyses  regardless  of whether  a patient  is not evaluable  for the efficacy  endpoint.  
All exploratory  analyses  will be conducted  for each  phase  of the trial separately.   PK/PD  
measures  such  as AUC,  Cmax,  and Cmin  will be calculated  and summarized.  Exploratory  
endpoints  that aim to investigate  biomarkers  of clinical  benefit  and/or  resistance  will be 
evaluated  descriptively  and graphically.  If there  are a sufficient  number  of clinical  benefit  
even ts, nonparametric  tests  (Fisher’s  exact  or Wilcoxon  rank sum)  will be used  to test the 
exploratory  hypotheses  depending  on the distribution  of the biomarker.  
Deaths  will be censored  for the TTP endpoint  in secondary  analyses.  However,  we will also 
evaluate   PFS  which   treated   deaths   and  progression   as  events.     These   are  secondary

analyses,  and if there  are a sufficient  number  of events  and types  of events,  we can consider  
other  approaches,  such  as the calculation  of cumulative  incidence  functions.  
15.1 RESEARCH PARTICIPANT REGISTRATION AND RANDOMIZATION PROCEDUR ES 
 
15.2 Research  Participant  Registration  
 
 
 
Confirm  eligibility  as defined  in the section  entitled  Inclusion/Exclusion  Criteria.  Obtain  
informed  consent,  by [CONTACT_11093].  During  the registration  process  registering  individuals  will be required  to complete  
a protocol  specific   Eligibility  Checklist.  The individual  signing  the Eligibility  Checklist  is 
confirming  whether  or not the participant  is eligible  to enroll  in the study.  Study  staff are 
responsible  for ensuring  that all institutional  requirements  necessary  to enroll  a participant  to 
the study  have been  completed.  See related  Clinical  Research  Policy  and Procedure  #401  
(Protocol  Participant  Registration).  
15.3 Randomization  
 
If the research  study  requires  randomization  procedures,  this section  should  be referenced  by 
[CONTACT_46460]  (14.0).  Describe  in detail  the process  of randomization,  when  it should  
occur,  how it is being  conducted  and who is responsible  for carrying  it out. 
16.1 DATA MANAGEMENT ISSUES 
 
A MSKCC  Research  Study  Assistant  (RSA)  and Research  Project  Coordinator  (RPC)  will 
assist  the PI, [CONTACT_46470]  with the oversight  and conduct  of this study.  The RSA will be 
responsible  for protocol  compliance,  data collection,  data reporting,  AE tracking  and reporting,  
SAE reporting,  regulatory  submissions,  and for coordinating  all study  participant  research  
activities.  The RPC  will be responsible  for regulatory  compliance,  overall  project  compliance,  
data quality  assurance,  SAE review,  and Medidata  database  management.  Both the RSA and 
RPC  will report  to and regularly  meet  with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_46423],  data and enrollment  status;  
protocol  aberrations,  regulatory  requirements  and any participant  toxicities  on study.  
16.2 Quality Assurance 
 
Throughout  the life of the study,  the study  team  comprising  of the PI, research  fellows,  research  
nurses,  RSA,  and RPC will meet  regularly.  During  these  meetings,  they will address  accrual  
rates,  review  adverse  events,  and discuss  any  challenges  with using  the device  in this 
population.  Regular  registration  reports  will be generated  to monitor  patient  accruals  and 
completeness  of data.  Routine  data quality  reports  will be generated  to assess  missing  data 
and inconsistencies.  Accrual  rates  and accuracy  of evaluations  and follow -up will be monitored  
periodically  throughout  the study  and potential  problems  will be brought  to the attention  of the 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_46424].  
Random  sample  data quality  audits  will be performed  by [CONTACT_46461].

16.3 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM)  Plans  at Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Cancer  Center  were  
approved  by [CONTACT_40137]  2001.  The plans  address  the new 
policies  set forth by [CONTACT_28643]  “Policy  of the National  Cancer  Institute  
for Data and Safety  Monitoring  of Clinical   Trials”  which  can  be  found  at:  
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html . The DSM  Plans  at MSKCC  were  
established  and are monitored  by [CONTACT_46462].  The MSKCC  Data and Safety  
Monitoring  Plans  can be found  on the MSKCC  Intranet   at:  
http://mskweb2.mskcc .org/irb/index.htm 
 
There  are several  different  mechanisms  by [CONTACT_46463],  safety  
and quality.  There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  protocol  
monitoring,  compliance  and data verification  audits,  therapeutic  response,  and staff education  
on clinical  research  QA) and departmental  procedures  for quality  control,  plus there  are two 
institutional  committees that are responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our clinical  trials 
programs.  The committees:  Data and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  for Phase  I and II 
clinical  trials,  and the Data and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  for Phase  III clinical  trials,  
report  to the Center’s Research  Council  and Institutional   Review  Board . 
During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each  protocol  will be assessed  for its 
level of risk and degree  of monitoring  required.  Every  type of protocol  (e.g.,  NIH sponsored,  
in-house  sponsored,  industrial  sponsored,  NCI cooperative  group,  etc.) will be addressed  and 
the monitoring  procedures  will be established  at the time of protocol  activation.  
17.1 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 
 
Participants  will be informed  that information  collected  during  their participation  in this study  is 
considered  confidential.  All data gathered  will be kept in a secured  location  and available  only 
to members  of the research  study  team.  Findings  will be presented  in aggregate  form only - 
with no references  made  to the individual  participant’s  data.  Confidentiality  of each  participant’s  
data will be protected  with utmost  care;  data will be identified  solely  by a code  number.  A list 
matching  participant’s  names  and code  numbers  will be maintained  on a secureand passwo rd 
protected  database  in MSKCC  servers.  Participation  in this study  is entirely  voluntary.  All 
participants  will be required  to sign a statement  of informed  consent  that adheres  to MSKCC  
guidelines.  Should  a patient  decide  not to participate  in this study  or to withdraw  their consent  
to participate  at any time during  the study,  their treatment  at MSKCC  or participating  institutions  
will in no way be compromised.  
17.2 Privacy  
 
MSKCC’s  Privacy  Office  may allow  the use and disclosure  of protected  health  information  
pursuant  to a completed  and signed  Research  Authorization  form.  The use and disclosure  of

17.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting 
 
An adverse  event  is considered  serious  if it results  in ANY of the following  outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
• An adverse  event  that results  in inpatient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46425]  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct  
normal  life functions  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important  Medical  Events  (IME)  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or 
require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_28613],  based  upon  medical  judgment,  
they may jeopardize  the patient  or subject  and may require  medical  or surgical  
intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition  
 
Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46426] a planned  procedure/disease  treatment  is not considered  an 
SAE.  
 
SAE reporting  is required  as soon  as the participant  starts  investigational  
treatment/intervention.   SAE reporting  is required  for 30-days after the participant’s  last 
investigational  treatment/intervention.  Any event  that occur  after the 30-day period  that is 
unexpected  and at least possibly  related  to protocol  treatment  must  be reported.  
 
Please  note:  Any SAE that occurs  prior to the start of investigational  treatment/intervention  
and is related  to a screening  test or procedure  (i.e., a screening  biopsy)  must  be reported.  
 
All SAEs  must  be submitted  in PI[INVESTIGATOR_46427].  If an SAE requires  submission  to the HRPP  office  per 
IRB SOP  RR-408 ‘Reporting  of Serious  Adverse  Events’,  the SAE report  must  be submitted  
within  [ADDRESS_49019]  be submitted  within  30 calendar  
days of the event.  
 
The report  should  contain  the following  information:

Study design:  
This is a randomised, double -blind, placebo- controlled, proof -of-concept, Phase 2 study assessing 
setanaxib co -administered with pembrolizumab in patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN. The 
safety and efficacy of setanaxib 800 mg twice daily [BID] will be assessed against matching placebo over up to 105 weeks of treatment.  
The study design is outlined in Figure 1  (Study Schematic), and the visit schedule and planned 
assessments at each visit are detailed in Table [ADDRESS_428243] of a n up to  35-day Screening Period, an up to 24 -month Treatment Period (Day 1 
to Week  105), and a 28 -day Safety Follow -up Period. The total duration of the study for patients 
remaining in the study until their final f ollow -up assessment will be up to approximately 114  weeks 
(approximately 2  years and 2  months).  
Patients will be assessed for eligibility during the Screening Period. Patients will attend the Screening Visit within 35 days of Day  1, such that all of the results of the screening tests will be available at the 
time that patient eligibility is reconfirmed prior to dosing. If serum pregnan cy (see Footnote  ‘d’ of Table
 
1) retest is required, it should be repeated within [ADDRESS_428244] be assessed by a central laboratory and an 
elevated tumour CAF s level demonstrated. For Baseline biomarker determination and determination of 
eligibility, a  fresh tumour biopsy will be required from all patients before dosing in the study (unless 
there is tumour material available from a biopsy taken within 30 days prior to the Screening Visit, which can be used for the Baseline biomarker analysis). In addition, for patients with a suitable archival tumour biopsy sample available, the archival sample 
may be used to assess CAF s level and determine eligibility  (Note: this can only be performed after the 
patient has provided signed informed consent ). This will not dispense from the  need for a recent pre-
study tumour biopsy, collected  during or within [ADDRESS_428245] been collected within 6  months  prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1) , and the patient must 
have  received no further anti -cancer therapy since then.  
Eligible patients will be randomised to the investigational medicinal product (IMP) setanaxib tablets 800 
mg BID, or placebo, according to a 1:1 randomisation ratio, stratified by [CONTACT_108079][INVESTIGATOR_28597] (HPV ) 
status. Treatment with pembrolizumab will be initiated on the same day (Day 1) as the first dose of IMP ,

    and will be administered according to current clinical guidelines and labe lling, ie, 200 -mg IV infusion 
every 3 weeks  (q3w) . 
Treatment with pembrolizumab will continue until: RECIST v1.1 -defined disease progression as 
determined by [CONTACT_093] , unacceptable toxicity , or a maximum of 24  months. If progression is 
suspected, but not confirmed, study treatment may continue until confirmation of radiological 
progression. Treatment with setanaxib or placebo will continue throughout the period of pembrolizumab therapy. When pembrolizumab is discontinued, blinded study
 treatment will be discontinued at the same time.  
Baseline assessments will be performed on Day  1 (Visit 2). Post -Baseline assessments will be performed 
every 3 weeks up to pembrolizumab discontinuation. Following permanent IMP discontinuation at any time during the study, patients will undergo an End- of-Treatment (EoT) Visit as soon as possible and a 
Safety Follow -up Visit at [ADDRESS_428246] occurred . AEs will be recorded up to 28 days after study treatment 
discontinuation, while a ny further a nti-cancer medication will be recorded until progressio n. 
Throughout the study, particular attention will be given to the detection and management of potential cases of anaemia and potential cases of hypothyroidism.  
Safety  and
 tolerability data will be  regularly  reviewed by a n unblinded Independent Data Monitoring 
Committee  (IDMC ), with the first assessment after approximately 12 patients (6 per treatment group) 
have  had the opportunity to complete  at least 1 cycle of pembrolizumab +/ - setanaxib, followed by 
[CONTACT_344801] a frequency defined in the IDMC Charter. The IDMC may recommend change(s) to the setanaxib dose regimen or study conduct based on the safety data reviews, as defined in the IDMC Charter.
 
After approximately 12 patients (6 per treatment group) have completed their B aseline and post -
treatment biopsy, initial gene expression and biomarker data in tumour tissue may be reviewed by [CONTACT_103], who will remain masked to randomised treatment assignment. A second review may be 
performed, if required.  
Study duration:  
The start of the study will be the date on which the first patient provides informed consent, and the end 
of the study will be the last patient’s last assessment . 
The maximum study duration for an individual patient is up to approximately 114  weeks (approximately 
2 years and 2  months): A n up to 35-day Screening Period, a n up to  24-month Treatment Period (Day  1 to 
Week  105), followed by [CONTACT_344802] a Safety Follow -up Visit at [ADDRESS_428247] IMP dose. 
Planned number of patients : It is planned to r andomise  approximately 50 patients; however , depending 
on the number of patients providing evaluable Week 9 biopsy and imaging data, an additional up to 20 
patients (making a maximum of 70 patients) may be randomised to ensure an adequate amount of data is available for the efficacy and biomarker analyses .  
Target population:  
Patients aged ≥18 years with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN who are eligible for treatment with 
pembrolizumab monotherapy.  
Inclusion criteria:  
1. Male or female patients aged ≥18 years, inclusive, at the time of informed consent.  
2. Willing and able to  give informed consent and to comply with the requirements of the study.

discretion of the investigator.  
5. A positive CAF s level (defined as CAF s level in tumours ≥ 5%), performed at a central laboratory, 
with a fresh tumour biopsy taken during or within 30 days prior to the Screening Period. If 
available, s uitable archival tissue  (taken within 6 months prior to the Screening Visit and where 
the patient has received no further anti -cancer therapy during this 6- month period)  can be used to 
assess tumour CAF s level and determine patient eligibility  (Note: patients found to have low CAF 
levels in archival tissue material should not proceed to have further biopsies or screening 
activities) . 
6. Measurable disease, in accordance with RECIST v1.1, and with tumour accessible and of 
sufficient volume for pre -treatment and on -treatment biopsy.  
7. Combined positive score ( CPS) ≥1, as determined on the archival or fresh tumour biopsy taken

Statistical methods:  
Sample size 
An overall sample size of approximately 50 patients (25 per treatment group ) is considered sufficient to 
assess the primary endpoint of the best percentage change in tumour size following treatment with 
setanaxib when administered with pembrolizumab, versus placebo when administered with 
pembrolizumab, in patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN. With [ADDRESS_428257], there will be 85% power to detect a 20% mean difference between the treatment 
groups in best percentage change in tumour size, with an estimated standard deviation of 30% and a 2-
sided alpha of 20%.  To mitigate risks from a higher than expected number of patients discontinuing the 
study early or declining to have imaging or biopsies at Week 9, an additional up to 20 patients (making a 
maximum of 70 patients) may be randomised.  
The key secondary  endpoints of numbers of CAF s, CD8+ TILs , and regulatory T -cells in tumour tissue , 
and gene expression analysis in tumour tissue will be used to determine proof- of-concept. With 25 
patients per treatment group , there will be 90% power to detect a limit fold change (LFC) of more than 
1.[ADDRESS_428258] >80% power to demonstrate a statistically 
significant difference in PFS with 2 -sided p<0.2.

    For qualitative variables, the population size (N for sample size and n for available data) and the percentage 
(of available data) for each class of the variable will be presented. Quantitative variables will be 
summarised using descriptive statistics, inc luding n, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, 
and maximum values. Graphical presentations of the data will be produced to aid interpretation.  
An initial data cut- off will occur approximately [ADDRESS_428259] of the setanaxib + pembrolizumab versus placebo + pembrolizumab. The 
primary efficacy analysis will be based on  the Full Analysis Set (FAS)  and will evaluate the effect of  
setanaxib on best percentage change in tumour size from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model 
including a term for the best percentage change tumour size , a covariate for Baseline tumour size and a 
term for treatment. The number of patients, unadjusted mean, and adjusted least -square means (lsmeans) 
for each treatment group will be presented, together with the difference in adjusted lsmeans, 80% confidence interval , and corresponding p- value from the fitted ANCOVA model.  
The key secondary endpoint of PFS will be summarised by [CONTACT_5263]- Meier plots presented by [CONTACT_98540] . Median PFS and the proportion of patients who are progression- free at 3, 6, and 12 months will 
be summarised  along with 80 % confidence interval s presented for each treatment group. Patients who 
have  not progressed by [CONTACT_344803] -off for the updated analysis will be censored. The 
comparison between the treatment groups of PFS will be performed by [CONTACT_6486] a Cox proportional hazard 
model with treatment group as the only covariate. The hazard ratio for PFS, based on the profile partial likelihood from the fitted using Cox proportional hazards model, will be calculated as a measure of the 
treatment effect along with the respective 95% Wald confidence interval and the asymptotic p- value from 
the Wald test for the difference in the log hazards in the fitted model.  
The secondary endpoint of OS will not be formally compared between the groups but will be 
summarised in a Kaplan -Meier plot together with descriptive statistics, as described for PFS.  
The secondary endpoint s of ORR , DoR , and DCR  will be summarised using descriptive statistics for each 
treatment group and associated  90% Agresti -Coull confidence interval.  
For the key secondary endpoints of numbers of CAF s, CD8
+ TILs,  and regulatory T -cells,  and the 
secondary endpoint of PD -L1 expression analysis in tumour tissue, it is hypothesised based on the mode 
of action of setanaxib that there will be a reduction in CAF s level and an increase in the number of CD8+ 
TILs. Data  will be summarised descriptively and will be graphically presented by [CONTACT_344804] s displayed for 
each treatment group and individual patient profiles displaying pre - and post -doses counts. Changes 
within treatment groups (ie, across paired tissue samples) and between treatment groups will be 
summarised. An ANCOVA model will be used to assess for significant differences after adjustment for Baseline differences. The treatment effect from the fitted ANCOVA model will  estimate the treatment 
difference based on mean score. A logarithmic transformation will be applied prior to analysis, if 
appropriate.  
For the secondary endpoint of changes in patterns of gene expression and differential gene expression in tumour tissue, data will be displayed graphically and will be assessed by [CONTACT_344805].  
Changes in tumour biomarkers will be correlated with change in tumour size and other efficacy parameters.

malignancy, representing approximately 6% of all cases; worldwide, approximately 830,000 patients develop head and neck cancer each year, and approximately 430,000 will die from this disease  (Bray et al  2018). Although the head and neck region contains a 
wide diversity of structures and cell types, the vast majority (>90%) of head and neck cancers arise from the mucosa of the upper aer odigestive tract and are squamous cell in 
origin (squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck [SCCHN]). 
The median age of diagnosis of SCCHN is in the seventh decade, and there is an 
approximately two-fold higher incidence in m en. Alcohol and tobacco use are thought to 
be important risk factors implicated in approximately 75% of cases of SCCHN; infection with cancer -causing types of human papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] (HPV), especially HPV type 16, is 
also an important risk factor for oropharyngeal cancers that involve the tonsils or base of the tongue. 
Two-thirds of patients with SCCHN present with locally advanced, S tage III or IV 
disease, commonly involving regional lymph nodes. Distant metastasis at initial 
presentation is uncommon, arising in approximately 10% of patients. The 5- year survival 
for all stages combined on the basis of Surveillance Epi[INVESTIGATOR_70299] 
(SEER) data is about 60%. 
The treatment of SCCHN at initial presentation usually comprises a combination of 
chemotherapy, radiotherapy and/or surgery, which is often considered “definitive”. Surgery is a standard treatment for SCCHN but may be limited by [CONTACT_344806]; radiotherapy is similarly an integral 
part of primary or adjuvant treatment of SCCHN. Initial chemotherapy regimens are usually reserved for locally advanced disease and typi[INVESTIGATOR_344777] a combination of platinum plus paclitaxel or fluorouracil. 
Treatment is associated with significant morbidity and a relatively static 5 -year survival 
rate of approximately 50% to  60% in patients with HPV- negative (HPV
-ve) disease 
(patients with HPV -positive [HPV+ve] tumours have significantly better survival) ( Ward 
et al 2014, Ferlay et al  2015). At least 50% of patients with locally advanced SCCHN 
develop locoregional or distant relapses, which are usually detected within the first 2 
years of treatment ( Argiris et al 2008, Chow 2020). A minority of patients present with 
locally recurrent, non- metastatic SCCHN  that is amenable to salvage surgery and/or re-

    irradiation, where long-term survival is possible; however, for the majority of patients, 
treatment options are limited and historical survival rates have been poor. 
In the setting of recurrent and/or metastatic disease ( R/M), first -line treatment with 
platinum combined with fluorouracil or a taxane has typi[INVESTIGATOR_344778] a 30% response 
rate and median progression-free survival (PFS) of 3 to 4 months, and median overall survival (OS) of 6 to 8 months ( Gibson et al 2005, Colevas  2006). Addition of the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) -target therapy cetuximab to a platinum- based 
chemotherapy with fluorouracil (platinum–fluorouracil) has been shown to significantly prolong median OS from 7.4 months (chemotherapy- alone) t o 10.1 months 
(chemotherapy plus cetuximab) with an increase in PFS from 3.3 to 5.6 months (Vermorken et al  2008).  
1.1.2 Setanaxib (Investigational Medicinal Product)  
Setanaxib is a first -in-class, selective inhibitor of the human protein nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) isoforms 1 and 4. It is a low molecular weight member of the pyrazolopyridine dione chemical class. It selectively inhibits human isolated NOX4 (Ki 0.09 μM) and NOX1 (Ki 0.15 μM) but is less active at inhibiting isolated human NOX2 (Ki 2.13 μM), NOX3 (Ki 0.36 μM) , and NOX5 (Ki 
0.33 μM). This selectivity  against NOX2 means that setanaxib does not compromise 
phagocyte function. There is no evidence from literature evaluating the effect of gene deletion of NOX isoforms to indicate that chronic inhibition of NOX1 and NOX4 is likely to result in safety concerns. 
Setanaxib is being investigated in fibrotic and inflammatory disorders, with clinical 
studies completed or underway in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), type 2 diabetes with albuminuria, type 1 diabetes with micro-albuminuria, and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).  
In vitro studies have shown  that setanaxib  attenuate s the induction of multiple fibrogenic 
pathways including tumour growth factor beta 1  (TGF -β1), platelet -derived growth factor 
(PDGF), toll -like receptor  4 (TLR4), Hedgehog, and angiotensin 2. Specifically, 
setanaxib markedly reduced the induction of markers of myofibroblast activation including alpha smooth muscle action (αSMA), fibronectin, and pro-collagen 1. In addition, setanaxib has shown potent anti-inflammatory effects including reduced expression of adhesion molecules, cytokines, and chemokines. These effects were observed in human podocytes, primary human hepatic stellate cells, macrophages, human aortic endothelial cells, and in rat retinal microglial and Müller cells.  
These direct anti -inflammatory and anti- fibrogenic effects translate in to anti-
inflammatory and anti- fibrotic activity in multiple in vivo models of liver fibrosis. 
Specifically, setanaxib attenuated the development of liver fibrosis induced by [CONTACT_331443] (bile duct ligation and multidrug resistance protein 2 [M DR2] -/- 
mouse models). Setanaxib also prevented liver inflammation and fibrosis in models of

    nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH) (stelic animal model [STAM] and fast food diet 
models) and in toxic hepatitis (carbon tetrachloride [ CCl 4]-induced liver injury). Reduced 
in vivo fibrogenesis was associated with a marked reduction in markers of myofibroblast 
activation. In addition, setanaxib prevented the induction of adhesion molecules, cytokines, and chemokines. These effects on innate immunity resulted in a profound reduction of macrophage infiltration. 
In addition, setanaxib was shown to prevent lung fibrosis in the bleomycin model of IPF. 
In contrast to the spontaneously reversible fibrosis induced in young mice, bleomycin 
causes irreversible fibrosis in aged mice. Setanaxib was able to reduce lung fibrosis in both young and aged mice, and also improved survival in aged mice. In these age d mice, 
setanaxib again prevented the activation and persistence of lung myofibroblasts and facilitated their clearance through apoptosis. These data are consistent with  results 
obtained in mice lacking NOX4, who showed protection in the bleomycin model. NOX4 over-expression in lung tissue of IPF patients has been reported by [CONTACT_52297], suggesting that NOX1/[ADDRESS_428285] s were enrolled and received single oral doses of setanaxib of up 
to 1600 mg (N=30) or multiple oral doses of setanaxib of up to 800 mg twice daily ( BID) 
(total daily dose 1600 mg) for 10 days ( N=32). In the Phase 1 program, setanaxib was 
well tolerated with low incidence of AEs . There were no deaths, no serious AEs ( SAEs ), 
and no AE  of severe intensity. Most were treatm ent-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
and were mild and self -limiting and were considered by [CONTACT_344807].

    In PBC, setanaxib has been evaluated in a total of 111 patients with inadequate response 
to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA); patients were randomised to receive setanaxib 400 mg once daily (OD), 400 mg BID or matching placebo for 24 weeks in addition to continued treatment with a stable dose of UDCA. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percent gamma -glutamyltransferase (GGT) reduction from B aseline to Week 24; secondary 
efficacy endpoints included alkaline phosphatase (ALP) changes, liver stiffness measured by [CONTACT_331436] (Fibroscan
®), and quality of life (QoL). Overall, setanaxib was 
safe and well tolerated at all doses; treatment with setanaxib attenuated markers of cholestatic injury (GGT, ALP), markedly reduced liver stiffness in patients with elevated liver stiffness, and improved QoL  by [CONTACT_344808]. In addition, setanaxib did not worsen pruritus.

Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanised monoclonal antibody (mAb) 
of the immunoglobulin G4 ( IgG4 )/kappa isotype designed to directly block the 
interaction between programmed cell death 1 (PD -1) and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. 
The PD -[ADDRESS_428287] hijacked by [CONTACT_344809]. The normal function of PD- 1, expressed on the cell surface of activated 
T-cells under healthy conditions, is to down-modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including autoimmune reactions. The ligands for PD- 1 (PD -L1 and PD- L2) 
are constitutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types, including non-hematopoietic tissues as well as in various tumours.  
The safety and clinical activity of pembrolizumab was first evaluated in patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN in an open -label, multicentre, Phase 1b study 
(KEYNOTE -012) ( Seiwert et al  2016). In this study, 60 patients with PD- L1-positive 
SCCHN were enrolled and treated. The proportion of patients with an overall response by [CONTACT_193382] 18% (8/45 patients); the proportion was higher in HPV
+ve 
(5/20 [25%]) than HPV-ve patients (7/36 [19%]). Pembrolizumab was well tolerated, with 
10 (17%) of [ADDRESS_428288] common of 
which were increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and in aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) , and hyponatraemia, each occurring in two of 60 patients; one 
patient developed a Grade 3 drug-related rash. A total of 27 (45%) of 60 patients experienced an SAE . There were no drug- related deaths.  
In a second study (KEYNOTE-055) in 171 patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN who had experienced disease progression within 6 months of platinum and cetuximab treatment, an overall response rate (ORR) of 16% and a median duration of response (DoR) of 8  months was observed following treatment with pembrolizumab 200 mg every 
3 weeks (q3w) ( Bauml  et al  2017). Response rates were similar in all HPV and PD- L1 
subgroups; median PFS was 2.1 months, and median OS was 8 months. At the time of the analysis, 109 patients (64%) experienced a treatment- related AE , with 26 patients (15%)

    experiencing a G rade ≥3 event. Seven patients (4%) discontinued treatment, and one died 
of treatment -related pneumonitis.  
Two Phase [ADDRESS_428289] further evaluated the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in 
patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN. In KEYNOTE -040 ( Cohen et al  2019), 
495 patients with SCCHN who  had progressed during or after platinum-containing 
treatment for recurrent or metastatic disease (or both), or whose disease recurred or progressed within 3 to 6 months of previous multimodal therapy containing platinum for locally advanced disease, were randomly assigned to treatment with pembrolizumab 200 mg q3w or investigator’s choice of standard doses of methotrexate, docetaxel or cetuximab (“standard -of-care”). In this study, the median OS was 8.[ADDRESS_428290]-of- care (p=0 .0161). Fewer patients treated 
with pembrolizumab than with standard-of- care had G rade 3 or worse treatment -related 
AEs (33 [13%] of 246 pembrolizumab-treated patients versus 85 [36%] of [ADDRESS_428291]-
of-care- treated patients). The most common treatment- related AE was hypothyroidism in 
33 (13%) patients with pembrolizumab and fatigue in 43 (18%) patients treated with standard -of-care. Treatment -related death occurred in 4 patients treated with 
pembrolizumab (unspecified cause, large intestine perforation, malignant neoplasm progression, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome) and [ADDRESS_428292] -of-care 
(malignant neoplasm progression and pneumonia). 
KEYNOTE -048 was a Phase 3, randomised, open-label study conducted in patients with 
recurrent or metastatic SCCHN that was not curable by [CONTACT_193385] ( Burtness et 
al 2019). Patients were randomly allocated (1:1:1) to pembrolizumab alone, 
pembrolizumab plus a platinum and 5-fluorouracil (pembrolizumab with chemotherapy), 
or cetuximab plus a platinum and 5-fluorouracil (cetuximab with chemotherapy); randomisation was stratified by [CONTACT_4002]-L1 expression, p16 status, and performance status. A total of 882 patients were allocated to receive pembrolizumab alone (n=301), pembrolizumab with chemotherapy (n=281), or cetuximab with chemotherapy (n=300); of these, 754 (85%) patients had a PD -L1 combined positive score (CPS) of 1 or more 
and 381 (43%) had CPS of 20 or more. 
At the second interim analysis, pembrolizumab alone improved OS versus cetuximab 
with chemotherapy in the CPS of 20 or more population (median 14.9 versus 10.7 months, p=0.0007) and CPS of 1 or more population ( median 12.3 versus 10.3 months, 
p=0.0086) and was non-inferior in the total population. Pembrolizumab with chemotherapy improved OS versus cetuximab with chemotherapy in the total population (13.0 versus 10.7 months, p=0.0034) at the second interim analysis and in the CPS of 20 or more population (14.7 versus 11.0 months, p=0.0004), and CPS of 1 or more population (13.6 versus 10.4 months, p<0.0001) at final analysis. 
At final analysis, G rade 3 or worse all -cause AEs  occurred in 164 (55%) of 300 treated 
patients in the pembrolizumab -alone group, 235 (85%) of 276 in the pembrolizumab with 
chemotherapy group, and 239 (83%) of 287 in the cetuximab with chemotherapy group.

    Adverse events led to death in 25 (8%) patients in the pembrolizumab-alone group, 
32 (12%) patients in the pembrolizumab with chemotherapy group, and 28 (10%) patients in the cetuximab with chemotherapy group. 
Based on the efficacy and safety outcomes of KEYNOTE -048, it was concluded that 
pembrolizumab plus platinum and 5-fluorouracil is an appropriate first- line treatment for 
recurrent or metastatic SCC HN and pembrolizumab monotherapy is an appropriate first-
line treatment for PD -L1-positive recurrent or metastatic SCCHN.  
1.[ADDRESS_428293] immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformation has been known for decades ( Disis  2010). Accumulating evidence shows 
a corr elation between tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and 
favourable prognosis in various malignancies ( Dong et al  2002, Sharpe & Freeman  2002, 
Brown et al  2003, Thompson et al 2007, Francisco et al  2010). In particular, the presence 
of cluster of differentiation 8 ( CD8
+) T-cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector T -
cells/ forkhead box P3+ (FoxP3+) regulatory T- cells seems to correlate with improved 
prognosis and long-term survival in many solid tumours. 
Studies treating recurrent  or metastatic SCCHN patients with anti- PD-1/PD- L1 
checkpoint inhibitors have produced ORR of approximately 15% ( Ferris et al  2016, 
Cohen et al  2019), and these drugs are now approved for subsets of patients with 
advanced disease. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 efficacy is predicated upon boosting a pre-existing 
anti-tumour immune response; the morphological correlate of this in cancer tissues is the 
presence of TILs; in numerous cancer types, including SCCHN, high TIL levels correlate significantly with longer survival ( Ward et al  2014 , Chakravarthy et al  2016 , Ottensmeier 
et al 2016, Wood et al  2016, Chakravarthy et al  2018), and many patients who respond to 
checkpoint inhibitors fall into this category. This perhaps explains the better survival in HPV
+ve SCCHN patients, where the majority of tumours (~85%) contain significant TIL 
levels ( Ward et al  2014).  TIL low tumours are commonly categorised as ‘immune desert’ 
(absent T -cells) or ‘immune excluded’ (excluded T -cells). For the latter group, strategies 
for promoting T-cell infiltration into tumours could significantly improve response to anti-PD-1 therapy. 
Although now recognised as a heterogenous cell population ( Sahai et al  2020), the term 
cancer -associated fib roblast (CAF) has been used mostly to refer to cells with an 
‘activated’ myofibroblastic phenotype (myCAF). These contractile, αSMA -positive cells 
are generated principally through TGF- β signalling/mechanotransduction ( Calvo et 
al 2013), and secrete extracellular matrix analogous to myofibroblasts found in healing 
wounds and fibrotic disorders. MyCAFs are a prominent component of most solid tumours and are generally associated with poor prognosis ( Hanley et al  2018); multiple 
studies have shown their positive influence on tumour progression, promoting metastasis, immune evasion, and therapy resistance ( Gaggioli et al 2007, Kraman et al  2010, Arwert 
et al 2020, Orimo et al 2005). Recent analyses of clinical studies and murine tumour

 Confidential   
    models indicate that myCAF s promote resistance to anti- PD-1 checkpoint 
immunotherapy ( Mariathasan et al  2018, Dominguez et al  2020, Ford et al  2020, Kieffer 
et al 2020), and specifically exclude CD8+ T-cells from tumours, thereby [CONTACT_344810] -PD-1 (Ford et al  2020). Notably, some 50% 
of HPV-ve SCCHN are dominated by [CONTACT_344811], which are invariably 
present in metastasis ( Marsh et al  2011). Notably, ‘immune hot tumours’ frequently 
harbour sub- clonal immune -resistance mutations ( Chakravarthy et al  2018); the relative 
paucity of immune- resistance mutations in ‘immune cold’ myCAF -rich tumours 
(presumably due to the lack of immune selection pressure for them) suggests that 
immunotherapy could be particularly effective in these tumours if lymphocyte exclusion could be overcome. 
Previous attempts to target myCAF s clinically have been unsuccessful ( Hofheinz et 
al 2003, Narra et al  2007, Catenacci et al  2015); therapeutic possibilities include myCAF s 
depletion or inhibiting myCAFs differentiation and/or function. Recent studies have 
shown that CAFs are a plastic population of cells that are not fixed in a state of terminal differentiation ( Öhlund et al 2017, Hanley et al  2018); a further possibility , therefore, is 
to skew myCAFs to a normal or immune permissive fibroblast phenotype ( Grauel at 
al 2020), which may suppress tumour progression ( Chen & Song 2019).  
Recently it has been shown that the reactive oxygen species (ROS) -producing enzyme 
NOX4, is a critical regulator of fibroblast- to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation (acting 
downstream of TGF- β1), regulates myCAF s accumulation in multiple tumour types, and 
is relatively specific to myCAF s (Hanley et al  2018, Ford et al  2020). Genetic (small 
interfering [si] RNA /short hairpin [sh] RNA) or pharmacological (setanaxib) inhibition of 
NOX4 suppresses myCAFs differentiation and slows growth of myCAF-rich tumours (Hanley et al  2018). Notably, inhibiting NOX4 in myCAFs, cultured ex vivo, reverts cells 
to a quiescent, fibroblastic phenotype, abrogating their tumour-promoting functions (Hanley et al  2018, Ford et al  2020), and suggesting that NOX4 is required not only 
during myCAFs differentiation, but is also needed to maintain the differentiated phenotype. Studies have shown that myCAFs can be targeted in vivo using setanaxib. Setanaxib suppressed intratumoral myCAFs accumulation and tumour growth ( Chen & 
Song 2019), overcoming CD8
+ T-cells exclusion and promoting an influx of intratumoral 
CD8+ T-cells into the tumour ( Ford et al  2020). Treatment of mice with setanaxib 
overcame myCAF -mediated resistance to both anti- cancer vaccination (TC -1; E7 DNA 
vaccine) and anti -PD-1 (MC38) immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ( Ford et al  2020).  
In summary, CAF-rich tumours respond poorly to anti- PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy, and 
currently there are no pharmacological means of targeting this cell type specifically. Studies suggest that CAF-mediated immunotherapy resistance results from the exclusion of CD8
+ T-cells from the tumour mass. In preclinical studies, this phenomenon can be 
successfully overcome by [CONTACT_344812]4 inhibition using setanaxib, a drug with considerable data in both healthy volunteers and patients, and which has an acceptable safety profile. A significant proportion of solid cancers are CAF-

immunotherapy would improve clinical outcome in these tumours. 
This study is being conducted to determine the tumour response in recurrent or metastatic 
SCCHN patients treated with setanaxib and pembrolizumab versus patients treated with placebo and pembrolizumab . 
The results of this study may be used to aid further development of setanaxib and potentially be used for submission to regulatory authorities. 
1.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment  
Setanaxib is a selective inhibitor of NOX1 and NOX4 isoforms of the NADPH oxidase 
family of enzymes and is the first drug in this class of NOX inhibitors to enter the clinic. The NOX1 and NOX4 isoforms have been shown to play a key role in a broad range of inflammatory and fibrotic disorders ( Krause & Bedard, 2008; Paik et al  2014; Liang et 
al 2016; Teixeira et al  2017). Inhibition of NOX1 and NOX4 with setanaxib has resulted 
in marked anti-inflammatory and anti- fibrotic effects in multiple in vitro and in vivo 
models of inflammatory and fibrotic disorders. Therefore, setanaxib is being investigated in inflammatory and fibrotic disorders, with several clinical studies completed or underway. 
CAFs are important cells in the tumo ur stroma of many cancers , and their presence is 
often associated with a poor prognosis. CAFs are involved in the adaptive anti- tumo ur 
immune response and contribute to the exclusion of CD8
+ T lymphocytes from the 
tumo ur microenvironment, and therefore, represent a brake on the action of 
immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_344779]. CAFs also affect the biology of dendritic 
cells by [CONTACT_344813], maturation , and their ability to present the antigen. 
CAFs can also participate in the development of a fibrous capsule around tumours and within tumo urs around the vessels. This barrier affects the recruitment and activity of 
cells of the immune system. The NOX enzymes participate in establishing conditions that are favo urable to the growth and to the local or remote extension of malignant tumours. It 
has been shown that NOX4 is strongly induced in many human cancers and plays a role in activation of CAFs. Pre-clinically, setanaxib has been shown to inhibit t he activation 
of CAFs and thereby [CONTACT_344814]8
+ T lymphocytes to reach and infiltrate the tumour.  
Immune checkpoint inhibitors are now a widely used therapy in many cancer settings, including SCCHN. However, of the proportion of cancer patients who can be treated with these agents, only a minority generally respond positively to the treatment. Identifying and overcoming the mechanisms that  prevent immune checkpoint inhibitors being 
effective is a key goal within the oncology arena. The ability of tumours to exclude immune system elements is known to be a main cause of resistance to immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , 
such as immune checkpoints inhibitors that target inhibitory receptors such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 ( CTLA4 ) or PD1 and its ligand PD- L1.

minority of patients (~20%) show a response to treatment. Increasing response to immune checkpoint inhibitors represents a major challenge, and there is a high unmet medical need for safe and efficacious treatment options in this disease setting. The addition of setanaxib therapy to pembrolizumab may enhance the ability of CD8

lymphocytes to reach and infiltrate the tumo ur and thereby [CONTACT_344815], thus increas ing the proportion of patients who respond to 
pembrolizumab therapy, and thereby [CONTACT_344816] . 
Participation in this study provides the patient with a standard- of-care treatment option in 
the form of the approved agent pembrolizumab, and a potential opportunity to take setanaxib, which is being evaluated for efficacy in this clinical study. While NOX1/[ADDRESS_428296] yet to be demonstrated. During this study patients will undergo the 
regular medical evaluations and assessments for their cancer, as part of the study procedures. 
Potential Risks  
As summari sed in Section  1.1.2, setanaxib has been extensively investigated in 
nonclinical and clinical studies.  
In the completed P hase 1 and P hase 2 studies, the safety profile of setanaxib has been 
shown to be acceptable, with no clinical safety signal and no dose limiting toxicity 
identified. The safety signals identified in the toxicology studies (thyroid function, electrocardiogram [ ECG ] abnormalities, h aematological changes) have been carefully 
monitored in all clinical studies completed to date. No treatment -related clinical or 
pathological findings have been observed, irrespective of dose, treatment duration or type of clinical study. 
The dose of setanaxib under investigation in this study has been evaluated in healthy 
subjects but is higher than that used in clinical study of PBC patients in the GSN000300 study; the duration of dosing in this study will be longer than in the healthy volunteer studies, with an anticipated median duration of dosing of [ADDRESS_428297] not been observed to date in the previous clinical studies. 
Safety  and tolerability data will be regularly reviewed by [CONTACT_101815] (IDMC), with the first assessment after approximately 12 patients

 Confidential   
    Potential Risk:  
Drug -drug interaction  Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 
and uridine diphosphate (UDP) -
glucuronosyltransferase 1A9 
(UGT1A9 ) are the  major 
metabolic pathways  for 
setanaxib. Potent CYP3A4 and 
UGT1A9 inhibitors and inducers 
should be avoided.  
When administered at a dose of 300 mg BID  for 10 days or 800 
mg BID for 6 days, setanaxib 
increased the plasma area under the concentration -time curve 
(AUC ) of the sensitive CYP3A4 
substrate midazolam by 34% and 24%, respectively, and thus 
setanaxib is not considered to be 
an inhibitor of CYP3A4 in vivo 
at the 800 mg BID  dose level.  
When administered at a dose of 800 mg BID  setanaxib increased 
the plasma AUC of the sensitive substrates of CYP2C9 (losartan) 
and CYP2C19 (omeprazole) by 
45% and 60% , respectively. 
Setanaxib is considered a weak inhibitor of these enzymes at the 800 mg BID  dose level.  
Setanaxib also has potential induction effects on CYP2B6. Thus , sensitive substrates of 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19  and 
CYP2B6 should be used with caution.  
Since setanaxib has been shown to inhibit organic anion transporter (OAT) [ADDRESS_428298] of setanaxib 800 mg BID  has been assessed 
on substrates of OAT1 
(adefovir) and OAT3 
(sitagliptin) in healthy subjects. The AUC of adefovir and sitagliptin was increased by 18 % 
and 33%, respectively , and thus 
setanaxib is considered a weak 
inhibitor of OAT3 and not to be 
an inhibitor of OAT1. It is 
recommended that  medications 
that are primarily eliminated through OAT3 should be used 
with caution. . 1. Setanaxib should not be 
administered concomitantly with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers, nor 
with potent UGT 1A9 
inhibitors and inducers . The 
medications being taken by a patient will be carefully evaluated by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator 
before the patient is enrolled into the study, and 
concomitant medications will 
be recorded throughout the study.  
2. Setanaxib should be used with caution when co-administered with drugs that 
are sensitive substrates of 
CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 , 
CYP2B6, OAT3,  BCRP or P -
gp.

In addition, setanaxib inhibited 
BCRP and MDR1 (P -
glycoprotein [P -gp]) in vitro. 
This may result in increased 
exposures of applicable 
concomitant medications, hence caution should be exercised with use of sensitive BCRP and P -gp 
substrates . 
 
Potential Risks based on 
preclinical studies:  
Abnormal thyroid function  In canine toxicology studies, 
chronic administration of high -
dose setanaxib was occasionally associated with increases in plasma thyroid -stimulating 
hormone  (TSH) levels, reduced 
plasma free thyroxine ( T4) 
levels, and with thyroid cell follicular hypertrophy.  
Hypothyroidism is an identified risk for the concomitant study drug, pembrolizumab. The 
combined regimen could 
theoretically lead to an increased risk of hypothyroidism due to 
setanaxib use.  1.  Patients with TSH levels >  
upper limit of normal ( ULN) 
at Screening will be excluded.  
2. Patients included in the study will have regular laboratory 
blood tests that include 
thyroid function tests . 
3. In the case of TSH ≥10 mIU/L, IMP administration will be interrupted while the patient undergoes evaluation 
for hypothyroidism.  
Electrocardiogram (E CG) 
abnormalities  In canine studies, chronic 
administration of high doses of setanaxib was associated with 
reversible QT prolongation and atrioventricular  block events. 
Significant, but limited, increases in QT interval were observed at 3- [ADDRESS_428300] -dose 
in dogs receiving doses of 100 mg/kg or above. Setanaxib and its main active metabolite have no effect on the  human ether -a-
go-go related gene ( hERG ) 
channel, with a half maximal 
inhibitory concentration ( IC
50) >

common medications that should be avoided.

Haematological changes  In canine toxicology studies, 
administration of high -dose 
setanaxib was associated with a 
reduction in bone marrow 
erythroid precursors, reduced 
reticulocyte and red blood cell counts in peripheral blood, leading to severe aplastic anaemia in a dog. 
In clinical studies, there has been 
no evidence of bone marrow 
toxicity related to setanaxib exposure.  1. Setanaxib should not be 
administered concomitantly with drugs that have known bone marrow toxicities.  
2. Patients included in the study will have regular laboratory blood tests that include haematology (including haemoglobin and reticulocytes count ). 
3. Patients with a history of bone marrow disorder, including aplastic an aemia, or 
any current marked ana emia 
defined as haemoglobin <9.0 g/dL will be excluded from 
the study. 
4. In the case of significant anaemia ( Grade ≥3) not 
attributable to other causes , 
setanaxib administration will be interrupted while the 
patient undergoes further 
evaluation.  
Study intervention : setanaxib in combination with pembrolizumab  
Pembrolizumab is an approved 
established standard -of-care for 
the indication under study, and a key risk of treatment is  immune -
related adverse reactions 
(including immune -related 
pneumonitis, colitis, hepatitis, nephritis and endocrinopathies); severe and fatal cases have 
occurred in patients receiving 
pembrolizumab. Severe infusion- related reactions, 
including hypersensit ivity and 
anaphylaxis have occurred.  
 
Potential overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_344781]: Thyroid disorders . Risks identified based on clinical 
data from the pembrolizumab  
summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC) . 
 
Thyroid disorders, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and thyroiditis, have been reported in patients 
receiving pembrolizumab and 
can occur at any time during treatment. Hypothyroidism is more frequently reported in patients with SCC HN with prior 
radiation therapy.  Risk minimisation activities are 
reflected in the study protocol specific inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, alongside the safety 
monitoring strategy and toxicity management guidelines ( Section 
[IP_ADDRESS]).  
1. Patients with TSH levels >ULN at Screening will be

Study intervention: study procedures - tumour bio psy 
Injury from requirement for up 
to [ADDRESS_428302] up to 2 
biopsies of the tumou r during the 
study.  
The risks of biopsy are primarily:  
• Bleeding  
• Infection  
• Accidental injury to 
adjacent structures  Biopsies are routinely performed 
in patients with SCCHN for 
diagnostic purposes and will be 
performed by [CONTACT_344817]. Patients with tumour location or other factors that make it challenging to safely perform a biopsy will 
not enter the study. Archival 
tumo ur material can be used 
where available to check that patients are eligible for the study and thus minimise the number of 
patients who have a biopsy but 
are fo und to be ineligible.  
It is the sponsor’s position that setanaxib does not have immunosuppressive properties. In 
addition, the available literature and expert assessment concludes that patients taking pembrolizumab and other immune checkpoint inhibitors should be considered for Covid-[ADDRESS_428303] labelling . Risks due to tumour biopsies 
are minimised by [CONTACT_344818], qualified physicians. Risk minimisation activities are reflected in the study protocol specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, restrictions on concomitant medications alongside the safety monitoring strategy and toxicity management guidelines ( Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Section [IP_ADDRESS]). These risks are 
monitored via routine pharmacovigilance and managed via routine risk minimisation activities and standard treatment practices.  
Overall Benefit /
 Risk Conclusion 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_159613], outcomes for patients with SCCHN have remained mostly unchanged for the past few decades, especially for HPV
-ve SCCHN, and short -
term and long- term treatment -associated morbidities are still substantial. Most patients 
Sponsor Name: [CONTACT_344874]: GSN000400   
Version and Date: Version 4.0 (25 April 2023 ) Page [ADDRESS_428304] therapy, the incidence of AEs  of any grade and of Grade 3 or worse was lower with pembrolizumab 
monotherapy. In the CPS of 1 or more population, median OS  with pembrolizumab alone 
was 12 .3 months versu s 10.3 months for cetuximab with chemotherapy (hazard ratio 
0.78; 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 0.96, p=0.0086). Nevertheless, there remains a considerable unmet medical need for new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_13265]/or combinations to further improve treatment outcome in this poor prognosis group of patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN.  
Considering the measures taken to minimis e risk to the patients participating in this 
study, the potential risks identified in association with setanaxib are justified by [CONTACT_344819]. All patients will 
receive a standard -of-care agent in the form of the approved treatment , pembrolizumab. 
The nonclinical  profile and emerging clinical safety profile from the early clinical studies 
with setanaxib have not identified risks that would preclude investigation in this setting. 
Moreover, the study design aims to minimis e potential risks in several ways . Adverse 
drug r eactions to setanaxib will be managed as per the toxicity management guidelines. 
Adverse drug reactions to pembrolizumab will be managed as per the local product labels 
or clinical practice guidelines at the discretion of the investigator. Furthermore, a dose modification strategy for the management of setanaxib and pembrolizumab related toxicities is in place for those risks deemed to be most likely or serious ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS], 
and Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). Appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria in the study protocol 
ensure patient  safety. For example, to be enroll ed, patients  must be eligible for 
pembrolizumab treatment (as per local investigator assessment) , which is administered in 
both groups of the study. Second, the protocol includes safety monitoring in excess of standard -of-care monitoring, with the intent of protecting pa tients involved in the study. 
Taking into account the measures to minimise risk to the patients participating in this study, the potential risks identified in association with setanaxib and pembrolizumab are justified by [CONTACT_344820] .

America and Europe. However, depending on the number of patients providing evaluable 
Week 9 biopsy and imaging data, an additional up to 20 patients (making a maximum of 70 patients) may be randomised to ensure an adequate amount of data is available for the efficacy and biomarker ana lyses . 
The study design is outlined in Figure 1 (Study Schematic) , and the visit schedule and 
planned assessments at each visit are detailed in Table [ADDRESS_428307] of an up to 35-day Screening Period , an up to 24- month Treatment 
Period (Day  1 to Week  105), and a 28- day Safety Follow-up Period. The total duration of 
the study for patients  remaining in the study until their final follow- up assessment will be 
up to approximately 114 weeks (approximately 2 years and 2  months). 
The investigator will obtain signed informed consent from the patient  before any study 
procedures are performed. For further details regarding the informed consent process, see  
Section 9.3. Patients will be assessed for eligibility during the Screening Period. Patient s 
will attend the S creening Visit within 35 days of Day  1, such that all of the results of the 
screening tests will be available at the time that patient eligibility is reconfirmed prior to dosing. If serum pregnan cy (see Footnote ‘d’ of Table 1 ) retest is required, it should be 
repeated within [ADDRESS_428308] be assessed by a central 
laboratory and an elevated tumour CAFs level demonstrated. For Baseline biomarker 
determination and determination of eligibility, a  fresh tumour biopsy will be required 
from all patients before dosing in the study (unless there is a tumour material available 
from a biopsy taken within 30 days prior to the Screening Visit, which can be used for the Baseline biomarker analysis) . 
In addition, for patients with a suitable archival tumour biopsy sample available, t he 
archival sample may be used to assess CAF s level and determine eligibility  (Note: this 
can only be performed after the patient has provided signed informed consent).
 This will 
not dispense from the need for a recent pre -study tumour biopsy, collected  during or 
within [ADDRESS_428309]

on suitability) . Elevated CAF levels in suitable archival tumour tissue will meet the 
eligibility requirement based on CAF levels, but an additional pre-study biopsy (during or 
within 30 days of the Screening Period) is needed for reliable Baseline biomarker  
analysis . 
Eligible p atient s will be randomised to the investigational medicinal product (IMP)  
setanaxib 800 mg BID, or placebo, according to a 1:1 randomisation ratio, stratified by [CONTACT_344821] . See Section 6.3 for further details on the method of assigning patient s to the 
treatment groups, and see  Section 6.4 for further details on the dose and administration of 
setanaxib and placebo. T reatment with pembrolizumab  will be initiated on the same day 
(Day 1) as the first dose of IMP, and will be administered according to current clinical 
guidelines and labelling , ie, 200-mg intravenous ( IV) infusion q3w. See Section 6.7 for 
further details on the dose and administration of pembrolizumab. 
Treatment with pembrolizumab will continue until: RECIST v1.1 -defined disease 
progression as determined by [CONTACT_093] ( Eisenhauer et al 2009), unacceptable 
toxicity , or a maximum of 24 months. If progression is suspected, but not confirmed, 
study treatment may continue until confirmation of radiological progression. Treatment with setanaxib or placebo will continue throughout the period of 
pembrolizumab therapy. When pembrolizumab is discontinued, blinded study treatment will be discontinued at the same time . 
Baseline assessments will be performed on Day  1 (Visit 2). Post- Baseline assessments 
will be performed every 3 weeks up to pembrolizumab discontinuation. Following permanent IMP discontinuation at any time during the study, patients will undergo an End-of-Treatment (EoT) Visit as soon as possible and a Safety  Follow- up Visit at [ADDRESS_428311] occurred. AEs will be recorded up to 28 days after study treatment discontinuation, while any further anti -cancer medication will be recorded until 
disease progression. 
Throughout the study, particular attention will be given to the detection and management 
of potential cases of anaemia  (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), and potential cases of hypothyroidism 
(see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]).  
Safety  and tolerability  data will be regularly reviewed by [CONTACT_344822] , with the

2019) and offers greater statistical power that the traditional categorical response of ORR for comparison of treatment groups. Waterfall plots of best percentage change in tumour 
size clearly display both the magnitude and the variability of the response. Traditional efficacy endpoints of PFS, ORR, DoR, and DCR are retained as secondary endpoints.  
The secondary endpoints related to numbers of CAF s, CD8
+ TILs , and regulatory T- cells 
in tumour tissue, and gene expression analysis in tumour tissue will be used to demonstrate the underlying mechanisms of action of setanaxib and support the primary objective.

    single oral doses of setanaxib of up to 1800 mg and multiple oral doses of setanaxib of up 
to 900 mg daily for 10 days. A sixth Phase 1 study has recently also been performed, to evaluate higher multiple oral doses of setanaxib than previously assessed. A total of 46 healthy male and female subjects were enrolled and received single oral doses of 
setanaxib of up to 1600 mg (N=30) or multiple oral doses of setanaxib of up to 800 mg BID (total daily dose 1600 mg) for 10 days (N=32 ). 
In the Phase [ADDRESS_428314] were 
TEAEs and were mild and self -limiting and were considered not related to treatment by 
[CONTACT_093]. 
In a clinical study in patients with PBC (GSN000300), a total of 111 patients with PBC 
and inadequate response to UDCA were random ised in equal proportions to receive 
placebo, setanaxib 400 mg OD, or setanaxib 400 mg BID for 24 weeks. This dosing regimen was considered safe and well tolerated, and the treatment was pharmacologically active (based on observed dose-related improvements in liver enzymes); however, the observed clinical efficacy in the target patient population was considered insufficient, and a Phase 2b/3 clinical study in patients with PBC is planned in which doses of up to 
800 mg BID for 52  weeks will be evaluated  (GSN000350). 
In this study in SCCHN, setanaxib [ADDRESS_428315] dose in the planned Phase 2b/3 study in PBC (GSN000350) and represents a two -fold increase compared to the highest dose evaluated in the previous 
study in patients with PBC (GSN000300), where there were no safety signals of concern. At this dose, the expected exposures will be around the defined no- observed -adverse-
effect  level ( NOAEL ) for both the parent (setanaxib) and metabolite (GKT138184); 
however, the NOAEL defining toxicology signals can be monitored in the clinical setting, and were not observed in either healthy volunteers at 800 mg BID for 10 days or patients at 400 mg BID for 24 weeks.  
In this study in SCCHN, setanaxib (or placebo) will be co- administered with 
pembrolizumab until pembrolizumab is discontinued. It is anticipated that approximately 20 patients (80% of the 25 patients randomised to setanaxib) will receive treatment with setanaxib for ≥3 months, 12 patients (approximately 50%) for ≥6 months, and 8 patients 
(approximately 30%) for ≥12 months. The maximum duration of pembrolizumab treatment (and , hence, corresponding setanaxib/placebo treatment) is 24 months. 
 For the proposed dose (setanaxib 800 mg BID [total daily dose 1600 mg]), toxicology studies in the dog, the most sensitive species, provide a safety margin of ≥1, when the combined concentration of setanaxib and its main active metabolite (GKT138184) is considered. The safety margin of setanaxib alone is also ≥1. However, for the main active 
metabolite GKT138184, the safety margin is calculated to be 0.7. Please see Table 3 for the calculation of safety margins based on the 39-week repeat dose study in the dog.

4.3 Screen Failures  
Screen failures are defined as patient s who consent to participate in the clinical study but 
who do not meet one or more criteri on required for participation and are not subsequently 
entered in the study. A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure patient s, to meet the Consolidated Standards of 
Reporting Trials publishing requirements, and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any SAE.  
Patients who are screen failures may undergo full rescreening once at the discretion of 
the investigator and medical monitor if there is a reasonable expectation that the patient is potentially eligible for the study. In these cases, the rescreened patient should be assigned a new unique screening number. 
Of note, during the Screening Period, some assessments (eg, laboratory tests, ECGs, vital 
signs) can be repeated if abnormal without being considered as screen failure. In these cases, a whole new rescreening is not required. 
4.3.[ADDRESS_428326] 
Patient s should discontinue the IMP if any of the following occurs: 
1. The patient  withdraws his/her consent to participate in the study. 
2. The patient  develops an illness that would interfere with his/her continued 
participation in the study, at the investigator’s discretion. 
3. The patient  is noncompliant with study procedures or medication, that  in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_8574], impacts patient safety and/or the integrity of the study results. 
4. The patient  takes a prohibited medication that warrants the IMP discontinuation at the 
discretion of the investigator (see Section  6.7).  
5. The patient  is confirmed to be pregnant. 
6. The sponsor or regulatory agency requests withdrawal of the patient .

    7. The patient is withdrawn for safety reason per the investigator’s judgment. 
8. IMP rechallenge results in an aemia or hypothyroidism IMP interruption criteria being 
met again (see Section  6.4.2).  
At the time of premature I MP discontinuation, the patien t should complete the 
assessments indicated at the EoT Visit ( see Table 1 ). The patient  will also be required to 
attend a Safety Follow- up Visit at [ADDRESS_428327] ensure all decisions are appropriately documented. 
4.3.2 Premature Discontinuation from the Study  
Participation in the study is strictly voluntary. A patient  has the right to withdraw from 
the study at any time for any reason, without any reprisal. The investigator has the right to terminate participation of a patient  for any of the 
following reasons: 
• Violation of the protocol jeopardising patient safety and/or integrity of study results 
• Any other reason relating to the patient's safety 
• Any other reason relating to the integrity of the study data

 Confidential   
    Investigators should make every effort to discuss with the study monitor/sponsor before 
discontinuing a patient from the study. 
If a patient  is withdrawn from the study, the study monitor/sponsor will be informed 
immediately. If there is a medical reason for withdrawal, the patient  will remain under the 
supervision of the investigator until satisfactory health has returned. If the patient  withdraws consent for disclosure of further information, the sponsor may 
retain and continue to use any collected data before such a withdrawal of consent. If a 
patient  withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken 
and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study records. 
Although a patient  is not obliged to give his/her reason(s) for withdrawing prematurely 
from a study, the investigator should make a reasonable effort to ascertain the reason(s), 
while fully respecting the patient 's rights. 
At the time of premature study discontinuation, the investigator should make every effort to ensure the patient  completes the assessments indicated at the EoT Visit (see Table 1 ). 
Patient s who prematurely discontinue from the study cannot subsequently re -join the 
study. 
For details on the discontinuation of study sites or the study as a whole, see Section 14. 
4.3.[ADDRESS_428328] to follow-up if he/she repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_9298]. The following actions must be taken if a patient  fails to return to the clinic for a required 
study visit: 
• The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_166533], counsel the patient  on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule, and ascertain whether or not the patient  wishes to and/or should continue in 
the study. 
• Before a patient  is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator (or designee) must 
make every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_10970]  (where possible, 2 telephone 
calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the patient ’s last known mailing address or 
local equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_11395] ’s medical notes . 
• Should the patient  continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study.

    5 DESCRIPTION OF STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
Refer to Table 1  for the schedule of assessments.  
Patients will be reminded to bring the IMP with them to each study visit. On visit days, 
pa
tients will take their morning doses of IMP with food (or up to 30 minutes after a meal) 
after the study procedures have been completed. In general, study assessments may be 
performed on any days within the allowed visit windows around nominal visit dates, in particular tumour assessment (biopsy and imaging) may be carried out on a different day to the main study visit, refer to Section 5.2 for details of efficacy assessments .  
I 
n general, the assessments will be conducted in the following order: 
• AEs/concomitant medications recording 
• Physical examinations/vital signs/ECGs  
• Laboratory assessments /Tumour assessment (tumour assessment must be performed 
before tumour biopsy when applicable)  
• Dispense IMP  
• Patient takes morning dose of IMP with food (or up to 30 minutes after a meal)  
(see Section  6.4) 
5.1 Demographics and Other Screening Assessments  
Patients will attend the Screening Visit within 35 days of Day 1. If serum pregnancy (see Footnote ‘d’ of Table 1 ) retest is required, it should be repeated within 7 days prior to 
randomisation. Screening Period extensions of up to 7 days may be considered on a case-by-case basis, if agreed by [CONTACT_173875]. 
Demographics , ECOG performance status,  and relevant medical history will be collected 
as described in Sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.1, respectively. Safety assessments, including laboratory assessments, that are also part of the screening 
assessments are described in Section 5.3. 
The screening assessment of tumour response will be assessed as described in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
A fresh tumour biopsy will be taken during the Screening P eriod for assessment of 
tumour biomarkers (CAFs , CD8
+ TILs , regulatory T- cells, and PD1- L1) and gene 
expression analysis, as described in Section  5.2.2.

    Prior medications will be assessed at Screening, as described in Section  6.6. 
5.1.1 Demographics 
Demographic data, including year of birth/age, sex, and race, will be recorded in the 
electronic case report form ( eCRF ). 
5.1.2 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status 
ECOG performance status will be  assessed as described in Appendix II  and recorded in 
the eCRF.  
5.1.3 Medical History  
Medical history, including any ongoing illnesses up to the time the patient has provided informed consent, will be recorded in the e CRF, with the start date and stop date (if 
applicable) of the illness/condition.  
Any pre-study procedures will be recorded in the e CRF as part of the medical history 
assessment.  
5.2 Efficacy Assessments  
5.2.1 Tumour Imaging and A ssessment  of Disease 
Tumour assessments will include all known or suspected disease sites. For all patients, study imaging assessments will include computed tomography ( CT) or magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Other imaging assessments, eg, positron emission tomography (PET) CT and bone scans, may be performed if needed to further investigate or delineate abnormalities seen on CT/MRI. 
The same imaging technique regarding modality, ideally the same scanner, and the use of 
contrast should be used in a patient throughout the study to optimise the reproducibility of the assessment of existing and new tumour burden and improve the accuracy of the assessment of response or progression based on imaging. During follow-up, lesions should be recorded on the eCRF page in the same order as they were recorded at screening. Note: for the purposes of assessing tumour imaging, the term “investigator” refers to the local investigator at the site and/or the radiological reviewer located at the 
site or at an offsite facility. Expedited confirmation of measurable disease based on RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_428329] guidelines v1.1 for measurable (target) and non-measurable (non- target) 
lesions, and the objective tumour response criteria (CR, PR, SD, or PD) are presented in Appendix IV . The RECIST criteria will be used to programmatically determine ORR, 
DoR, and DCR.

Initial tumour imaging at Screening must be performed within [ADDRESS_428330]  v1.1. This scan will also be used as the B aseline scan for 
the tumo ur assessments in this study.  
All measurable lesions confirmed and assessed by [CONTACT_344824] (CT or MRI scans) up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions, recorded and measured at Baseline, and at the time points specified in the protocol. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumo ur Imaging During the Study 
The first on study imaging assessment should be performed at Visit 5 (Week 9 ±1 week ), 
and then every 6 weeks (±1 week ) through the first year, and every 9 weeks (±1 week) 
thereafter for up to [ADDRESS_428331] progression of target lesions, 
unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, or the appearance of one or more new lesions during follow-up. Death will be regarded as a progression event in those patients who die before disease progression. Unequivocal malignant disease not identified prior to starting study treatment on additional anatomical imaging (eg, CT, MRI or bone scan confirmed by X-ray) prompted by [CONTACT_23805], is considered disease progression and should be recorded as new lesions. If progression is uncertain, patients may continue on- treatment until the next scheduled assessment. If an unscheduled 
assessment is performed, it is important to return to the correct scanning schedule for subsequent scans relative to randomisation, so that the 2 treatment groups are comparable. If the investigator is in doubt as to whether progression has occurred, it is advisable to continue treatment and reassess at the next scheduled assessment, or sooner, if clinically indicated.  
To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of non- measurable disease, there must 
be an overall level of substantial worsening in non- target disease such that, even in the 
presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumour burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of treatment. A modest increase in the size of one or

 Confidential   
    more non- target lesions  is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal disease 
progression status. 
Response will be calculated in comparison to the baseline tumour measurements obtained 
be
fore starting treatment. Progression will be calculated in comparison to when the 
tumour burden was at a minimum (nadir). Overall visit response will be recorded on the eCRF. A copy of the CT/MRI scans and radiologist report performed for tumour 
assessment may be collected by a Calliditas appointed representative and analysed 
centrally for further scientific determination of changes in tumour size by [CONTACT_344825]. 
Refer to Appendix I V for further details on RECIST v1.1 methodology. 
5.2.2 Tumour Biopsy 
Up to 2 mandatory fresh tumour biopsies will be collected for assessment of tumour biomarkers (CAF s, CD8
+ TILs , regulatory T- cells, and PD1-L1) and gene expression 
analysis.  
Tumour biopsies can be taken f rom primary tumour site, involved lymph node or 
metastasis site.  Any decision to perform the on-treatment biopsy must consider the 
patient’s condition at that time point, and not be done if the risk to the patient appears unacceptable. I nvestigators must ensure appropriate clinical judgment  is applied when 
considering whether to perform tumour biopsies as this is a surgical procedure that may not intrinsically benefit individual patients but may benefit medical research.  
The first biopsy will be collected during or within 30 days prior to the Screening P eriod  
and will be used to determine the CPS score and CAF s level in tumour tissue as part of 
eligibility criteria , in case no archival tissue was available. Other assessments will 
include: 
• Levels of PD -L1 expression in tumour tissue using the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx 
assay (Agilent), a qualitative immunohistochemical assay using monoclonal mouse 
anti-PD-L1 clone 22C3 intended for use in the detection of PD-L1 protein in 
formalin -fixed , paraffin -embedded non- small cell lung cancer, gastric or 
gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, cervical cancer, urothelial carcinoma, SCCHN, and triple- negative breast cancer 
tissues, using EnVision FLEX visualisation system on Autostainer Link 48 
• Number of CD8
+ TILs and regulatory T- cells in tumour tissue 
• RNA sequence analysis  
To be considered suitable for initial determination of CAF level s, archival tissue biopsy 
material must have been collected within 6  months prior to the Screening Visit, and the 
Sponsor Name: [CONTACT_344874]: GSN000400   
Version and Date: Version 4.0 (25 April 2023 ) Page [ADDRESS_428332] received no further anti-cancer therapy since then. To be considered 
suitable for full Baseline (pre -treatment) biomarker assessment, tumour biopsy specimens 
must have been collected within [ADDRESS_428333] been obtained by [CONTACT_344826] 18 gauge (or larger core diameter) biopsy needle. If smaller needle is used, then additional biopsy cores are to be provided in the block. 10% Neutral buffered formalin is recommended as the tissue fixative.  
Samples meeting any of the criteria below are not acceptable:  
• Archived tissue with limited tumour content: preferably at least 30% of viable tumour cells  
• Cytology samples and fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026] 
• Tissues fixed with other unacceptable fixatives, including 95% alcohol, alcohol formalin acetic acid, and PREFER ™ 
• Specimens from bone lesions are generally not acceptable unless there is significant soft tissue component or there is no bone tissue in the biopsy 
The second biopsy (mandatory for all patients) will be performed 9 weeks (±1 week) 
after the start of study treatment or earlier if progression occurs before [ADDRESS_428334] optional tumour biopsy can be performed at disease progression (only for patients 
who had their second biopsy at [ADDRESS_428335] sample). 
CAFs will identified in formalin -fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections using 
immunohistochemistry for αSMA. CAFs are positive for α -SMA, and tumour stroma will 
be assessed for CAFs as previously described ( Marsh et al  2011) . SMA staining and 
evaluation of CAF scores will be performed by a single pathologist (or a suitably 
qualified and trained deputising pathologist) at a central laboratory. The semi- quantitative 
scoring system separates tumours into 3 groups: low (<5% stroma positive), moderate (5 to 50% stroma positive) and high (>50% stroma positive). Patients with tumours containing moderate or high levels of CAFs will be eligible for the study.

    The tumour samples will be used for analyses of biomarkers related to SCCHN. The 
biomarker analyses results will be used to explore the potential relationship with 
setanaxib response and/or disease progression data obtained in this study. 
The samples may be analysed as part of a multistudy assessment of genetic factors 
involved in the response to setanaxib or IMPs of this class to understand study disease or related conditions. 
The tumour sample will be collected, processed, stored, sent for central review, and 
analysed as defined in the central laboratory manual. Refer to the central laboratory manual for further details.  
5.2.3 Peripheral Blood for Circulating Biomarkers A nalysis  
Blood samples (20 mL whole blood) will be collected for analysis of exploratory circulating biomarkers, before commencing study treatment, during treatment and at progression, as outlined in Table 1. The blood samples will be used for analyses of circulating biomarkers related to SCCHN. The results of biomarker analyses will be used to explore the potential relationship with setanaxib response and/or disease progression data obtained in this study. Samples collected before treatment will be analysed for predictive biomarkers of response to treatment and may be used to develop future in vitro diagnostic tests. Samples collected during treatment and at progression will be used for additional explorator y research which may include but is not limited to  interrogation of 
changes in genetic expression and potential mechanisms of resistance to treatment. A range of oncology and immunological biomarkers that may corelate with drug response will be examined; these may include but are not limited to panels of cytokines, chemokines and other soluble biomarkers; T- cell receptor repertoire analysis ; and 
analysis of gene expression biomarkers associated with immunomodula tory effects . 
The samples may be analysed as part of a multistudy assessment of genetic factors involved in the response to setanaxib or IMPs of this class to understand study disease or related conditions. 
The blood samples will be collected, processed, stored, sent for central review, and 
analysed as defined in the central laboratory manual. Refer to the central laboratory manual for further details.

stabilised and are no longer considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_10982].  
If such values do not return to normal/Baseline within a period of time judged reasonable by [CONTACT_093], then the aetiology should be identified,  and the sponsor (or designee) 
notified. 
If required due to Covid -19-related restrictions , laboratory samples to follow up an 
AE, including the retests for haemoglobin (see  Section [IP_ADDRESS]), or TSH and free T4 (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), may be collected by a qualified healthcare professional at a location 
other than the study site. For other circumstances pertaining to patient safety during 
Covid-19- related restrictions, follow -up with the sponsor (or designee). 
Laboratory samples taken to follow up an AE , including the retests for absolute 
haemoglobin, or TSH and free T4 noted above, may be tested locally so that the results are communicated to the investigator’s site promptly. If required due to Covid-19- related 
restrictions, the results of local safety laboratory tests may be provided to the investigator by [CONTACT_756]. Local laboratory results will not be entered into the eCRF. However, where unscheduled central laboratory confirmation is not possible for protocol- specified retests 
for evaluation of potential anaemia or hypothyroidism, the retest results may be requested.

5.3.3 Pregnancy 
All patients are required to meet the requirements relating to pregnancy and use of contraception described in the inclusion and exclusion criteria (see Section 4.1 and 
Section 4.2, respectively).  Male and female patients of childbearing potential must 
receive pregnancy prevention counselling and be advised of the risk to the foetus if they become pregnant or father a child during treatment and for [ADDRESS_428340] dose of IMP or pembrolizumab, whichever is the later . Additional medications given during the 
study may alter the contraceptive requirements. These additional medications may require female patients to use highly effective methods of contraception and/or for an increased length of time. In addition, male patients are also required to use contraception. The investigator must discuss these contraceptive changes with the patient. 
For female patients who are considered postmenopausal but have less than 12 months of 
amenorrhea and who are not on concomitant oestrogen replacement therapy, a high FSH level in the postmenopausal range will be required  at Screening.  Confirmation with more 
than one FSH measurement is required. 
Serum (beta human chorionic gonadotrophin) or urine pregnancy tests will be performed 
for female patients of childbearing potential at the time points indicated in Table [ADDRESS_428341] result is positive, 
Sponsor Name: [CONTACT_344874]: GSN000400   
Version and Date: Version 4.0 (25 April 2023 ) Page [ADDRESS_428342] result is required at 
Baseline/Randomi sation and at each visit before dosing. Urine pregnancy tests will be 
analy sed locally.  
Any pregnancies in female patients and the partners of male patients will be recorded  
from the patient’s inclusion in the study until [ADDRESS_428343] dose of IMP or pembrolizumab, whichever is the later. The investigator should inform the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy or partner pregnancy by [CONTACT_344828] a Pregnancy Report F orm to the sponsor 
(or designee) using the contact [CONTACT_344829]. (Note: Sites are not required to provide any information on the pregnancy notification form that violates the country or regions local privacy laws).  
If a patient becomes pregnant, she will permanently discontinue IMP and attend an EoT Visit as soon as possible and a Safety Follow- up Visit at [ADDRESS_428344] dose of 
IMP, after which the patient will be encouraged to continue study assessments until disease progression. 
After obtaining the female patient’s signed authorisation for release of pregnancy and 
infant health information, the investigator will collect pregnancy and infant health information and complete the pregnancy questionnaire for any female patient who beco mes pregnant while taking IMP or pembrolizumab through [ADDRESS_428345] dose of IMP or pembrolizumab, whichever is the later . This information will be 
forwarded to sponsor (or designee). Generally, infant follow-up will be conducted up to 12 months after the birth of the child (if applicable).  
Any termination of pregnancy will be reported to sponsor (or designee), regardless of foetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure. 
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy 
complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be reported as an AE or SAE. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, foetal death, stillbirth, congenital abnormalities, ectopic pregnancy) will be considered SAEs. 
Any SAE occurring as a result of a post-study pregnancy which is considered reasonably 
related to the study treatment by [CONTACT_093], will be reported to sponsor (or designee). While the investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information in former study patients, he or she may learn of a SAE through spontaneous reporting. 
For any male study patient’s partner who becomes pregnant, the i nvestigator will attempt 
to collect pregnancy information on the male patient’s partner while the male patient is in 
this study until [ADDRESS_428346] dose of IMP or pembrolizumab, whichever is the

submit it to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s 
pregnancy. The investigator will obtain informed consent from the female partner to 
collect information about the pregnancy and its outcome. Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the sponsor (or designee). Generally, infant follow-up will be conducted up to 12 months after the birth of the child (if applicab le). Any 
termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless of foetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, foetal death, stillbirth, congenital abnormalities, ectopic 
pregnancy) will be considered SAEs. 
5.3.4 Breastfeeding  
Breastfeeding women will be excluded from the study. 5.3.5 12-lead Electrocardiogram 
12-lead ECG will be obtained as outlined in Table 1 . 
At Visit 2 (Study Day 1) and Visit 3, 12- lead ECG will be recorded pre -dose and 2 hours 
(± 30 minutes) post setanaxib/placebo dosing. From Visit 4 onwards, 12- lead ECG are 
only required before setanaxib/placebo dosing; additional ECGs may be recorded as 
clinically indicated.  
The ECGs will be conducted in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_55848] 5 minutes’ rest. 
The ECG tracing printout should be signed and dated by [CONTACT_344830] (for purposes of patient safety management); the tracing printout will be archived at the study site. The machines will provide heart rate, PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals.  If the ECG tracing printouts are in a non -archivable quality, including 
fading ink, a certified copy should be printed, signed and dated by [CONTACT_344831]  “certified copy”.  Electronically archived ECG tracings a re 
acceptable as source data provided the electronic archival system is validated.  
If there is any evidence of the cardiac conditions or abnormalities noted in Section  4.3.1, 
IMP is to be permanently discontinued. 
Further details regarding the ECG assessments are provided in the site operations manual 
or manual provided by [CONTACT_55899]. 
5.3.6 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be measured as outlined in Table 1  with the patient in a sitting  position

patient’s health.  
Body weight and height (height at Screening Visit only) will also be measured and recorded. The patient should be dressed in light clothing, without shoes. 
Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious 
illnesses. Any new abnormalities or worsening of existing abnormalities that are associated with signs and/or symptoms (except for SCCHN related -pre-existing - conditions, including disease progression) should be reported as AEs or SAEs , 
as appropriate (see Section 7).  
5.4 Pharmacokinetics  
Blood samples will be collected for measurement of plasma concentrations of setanaxib and its metabolite GKT138184 for all patients during the study at the visits specified in Table 1 . The PK blood volumes to be collected during the study will be provided in the 
ICF and/or in the central laboratory manual.  
PK samples will be collected just before the start of pembrolizumab infusion and before the IMP morning dose at Day 1, Week 3, Week 24, Week 51 , and Week 105, and 
anytime for the PK samples taken on the day of the second biopsy and at EoT Visit. 
Instructions for the collection and handling of biological samples will be provided by [CONTACT_103] (or designee) and will be included in the central laboratory manual. The actual date and time that each sample is collected will be recorded.  
The measurement of plasma setanaxib and GKT138184 concentrations will be performed by a central laboratory.

Breaking of the blind is only allowed in the case of an emergency, when knowledge of 
the IMP is essential for the clinical management of the patient. In such emergency 
situations, the responsibility to break the treatment code resides solely with the investigator. The investigator will have immediate access to break the blind through the interactive response technology (IRT). The investigator must contact [CONTACT_86622] 1 working day after the event, without revealing to the sponsor (or contract research organisation [CRO]) the results of the code break, except to the designated global patient safety representative.  The investigator must document the date of unblinding and the 
reason.  
Emergency unblinding will be organised through IRT. The investigator must record the 
date of unblinding and the reason. All breaks of the blind must be adequately documented.

Once the patient  has been successfully screened and the investigator has determined that 
the patient  is eligible, the patient  will be confirmed as enrolled within the I RT. 
Randomis ation will be performed via a centrali sed I RT. On Day 1, eligible patient s will 
be assigned to setanaxib or placebo in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by [CONTACT_344821] . Each patient  
will receive a unique randomi sation number when he/she is  assigned treatment. Patient s

that require permanent discontinuation of IMP are listed in Section  4.3.1. 
Dose reduction of setanaxib to 400 mg BID to manage anaemia, hypothyroidism, or any Grade 3 or otherwise intolerable toxicity, which is considered related to setanaxib may be instituted at the investigator ’s discretion  after discussion with the medical monitor.  
6.4.[ADDRESS_428359] should be interrupted in cases of ana emia (as described 
in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) or hypothyroidism (as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). If the criteria 
specified in those sections are met, IMP may be resumed. If the rechallenge results in the IMP interruption criteria being met again, the IMP must be permanently discontinued (see Section  4.3.1).  
6.4.3 Intervention A fter the End of the Study  
Continued access to IMP is not planned beyond the completion of the study. 
6.5 Precautions and/or Lifestyle Considerations  
There are no other lifestyle considerations (such as dietary or physical activity 
restrictions) for this study further to those listed in the inclusion/exclusion criteria (Section 4).  
6.6 Prior Medication  
See Section 4 for details of the prior medication that is permitted or prohibited according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
The following medications are prohibited: 
• Anti-cancer mAb  treatment within 4 weeks prior to study Day 1 
• Chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy or radiation therapy within 2 weeks 
prior to study Day 1 (radiation therapy can be allowed for palliative therapy of bone 
metastasis only)

    • Treatment with any investigational agent within 12  weeks of Screening Visit 1 or 
5 half -lives of the IMP (if known), whichever is longer 
• Current enrolment in another interventional clinical study 
• Medications known to be potent CYP3A4  inhibitors or inducers, as well as potent 
UGT1A9  inhibitors or inducers, within 21 days prior to IMP administration 
Live-attenuated vaccines should be avoided where possible within 30 days before study 
treatment but may be used where other alternatives are not available, considered inferior, 
or otherwise unsuitable. 
6.7 Background T reatment  
Setanaxib or matching placebo will be administered in combination with pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA, [COMPANY_006]) is a PD -1-blocking antibody indicated for the 
first-line treatment of patients with metastatic or unresectable recurrent SCCHN. 
Pembrolizumab is administered as 200- mg IV infusion q3w. Treatment will be initiated 
on Day 1, i e, at the same time as the first dose of IMP.  
Pembrolizumab is considered as a non-investigational product and will be administered 
according to current clinical guidelines and labelling. 
Refer to the pharmacy manual for full details for labelling and shipment of 
pembrolizumab. 
6.8 Concomitant Medication 
See Section 4 for details of the prior medication that is permitted or prohibited according 
to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The prohibited (prior) medications and devices listed in Section  6.6 are also prohibited during the study. The following medications are 
prohibited during the study:

• Potent CYP3A4 inducers (avasimibe, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], enzalutamide, mitotane, nevirapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampin, rifapentine, St John’s wort) 
• Potent UGT1A9 inhibitors/inducers (UGT1A9 inhibitors/inducers include belumosudil, cannabidiol, cannabinol, deferasirox, diflunisal, eltrombopag, fosphenytoin/phenytoin, isavuconazole, medical cannabis, mefenamic acid, methylene blue, morniflumate, niflumic acid, perampanel, regorafenib, rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513], 
sorafenib, umifenovir) 
Setanaxib is considered to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and OAT3. Sensitive CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and OAT3 substrates , such as warfarin and phenytoin 
(CYP2C9), S-mephenytoin (CYP2C19), and acyclovir, cefaclor, ceftizoxime, famotidine, furosemide, methotrexate, oseltamivir carboxylate, and penicillin G (OAT3), should be used with caution when co- administered with setanaxib  due to risk of increased drug 
concentrations. Setanaxib has potential induction effects on CYP2B6. S ensitive 
substrates of CYP2B6, such as tamoxifen, valproic acid, and cyclophosphamide should be used with caution due to risk of decreased drug concentration and reduced efficacy. 
In addition, setanaxib inhibited BCRP and MDR1 (P-gp) in vitro. This may result in 
increased exposures of applicable concomitant medications, and hence caution should be exercised with use of sensitive BCRP and P -gp substrates, such as digoxin. 
Appendix III contains a list of common medications that should be avoided or used with caution . 
Regarding Covid-[ADDRESS_428360] immunosuppressive properties based on nonclinical and clinical safety data, and as the available literature and expert assessment concludes that patients taking pembrolizumab and other immune checkpoint inhibitors should be considered for Covid-19 vaccination, the sponsor considers that study patients may undergo Covid-19 vaccination during the study. All approved Covid-19 vaccines are allowed in setanaxib studies and are to be recorded as a concomi tant medication.  It is important that the Covid -19 vaccinations are not delayed. 
If patients receive a prohibited medication, investigators should consider whether  IMP 
administration should be temporarily interrupted or permanently discontinued. Additionally, if a patient has taken a prohibited medication (eg, short- term antifungal 
therapy) and the investigator learns about it later, this might not lead to the permanent discontinuation of IMP.

For this study, a single intake of 5 or more setanaxib tablets and/or a total daily dose of 
7 or more tablets will be considered an overdose. 
The sponsor does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose with setanaxib. Decisions regarding dose interruptions will be made by [CONTACT_344835].

supplies of IM P will be accounted for in accordance with Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ). 
The pharmacist or ( designee) should maintain accurate records of all IMP supplies 
received during the study. These records should include the dates and amounts of IM P 
that were received at the site, dispensed, and destroyed or returned to the sponsor ( or 
designee). The records should include dates, quantities, batch/serial numbers, expi[INVESTIGATOR_1659] (if applicable), and the unique code numbers assigned to the IMP and study patient s. If errors or damage in the IMP shipments occur, the investigator should cont act 
the sponsor (or its designee) immediately. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_1093] I MP accountability records will 
be provided by [CONTACT_344838]. The study monitor will periodically check the supplies of IMP held by [CONTACT_344839]. 
The investigator (or designee) will dispense the I MP only to the identified and 
randomised patient s in this study, according to the procedures described in this study 
protocol. Details of IM P dispensed to patient s will be recorded in the eCRF. Investigators 
should maintain records that document adequately that the patient s were provided the 
doses specified by [CONTACT_344840] ( or 
designee). Patients will be reminded to bring the IMP with them to each study visit. 
Details of returned IMP will be recorded in the eCRF and accountability records. 
After the end of the study, all unused IMP and all medication containers should be 
destroyed at the study cent re or returned to the drug depot for destruction , as instructed in 
the pharmacy manual . In either instance, complete documentation will be returned to the

relationship with this treatment. An AE can , therefore , be any unfavou rable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.  
AEs that occur, having been absent before the date and time of the first dose of the IMP, or having worsened in severity or seriousness after initiating the IMP until [ADDRESS_428365] dose of IMP, will be classified as TEAEs.  
An event solely attributed to tumour progression should not be reported as an AE, unless the signs and symptoms of the event are more severe than expected for the patient`s condition. If the criteria for an AE is not met, disease progression will be recorded as efficacy data. Any event that meets one or more of the seriousness criteria will be reported as an SAE per the procedures outlined in S ection 7.4. 
7.1.2 Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is any event that meets any of the following criteria: 
• Results in death  (investigators should identify 1 SAE that is the leading cause of 
death).  
• Is life -threatening. 
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_36118] . 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity . 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
• Is an important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15537] . The event will be considered an SAE when, based upon 
appropriate medical and scientific judgment, the event may jeopardis e the patient  and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
above. Examples of such events include: intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not

 Confidential   
    result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], or the development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.  
Definition of Terms  
Life-threatening: an AE is life -threatening if the patient  was at immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred; ie, it does not include a reaction that, if it had occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. For example, drug-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life-threatening even though drug-induced hepatitis can be fatal. It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956]: AEs requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_344784]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_344785], or for procedures planned prior to the patient  
providing informed consent, or routine clinical procedures that are not the result of an AE (eg, elective surgery for a pre-existing condition that has not worsened) need not be considered AEs or SAEs. If anything untoward is reported during the procedure, that occurrence must be reported as an AE, either 'serious' or 'nonserious' according to the usual criteria.  
In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_344786] (usually involving 
at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician's office or outpatient setting. When in doubt as to whether hospi[INVESTIGATOR_344787], the AE should be considered serious. 
Disability/incapacity: an AE is incapacitating or disabling if the experience results in a 
substantial and/or permanent disruption of the patient ’s ability to carry out normal life 
functions. 
7.1.3 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions  
A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) is defined as an untoward and 
unintended response to a study drug, which is not listed is the applicable product information  (eg, IB for an unapproved IMP or the SmPC for an authorised medicinal 
product), and meets one of the following serious criteria: results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_344788], 
results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly or birth defect , or is an important medical event that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_73256] ; and is assessed as causally related to the I MP. For 
S[LOCATION_003]Rs, the blind will be broken for safety reporting purposes.

 Confidential   
    7.1.4 Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments  
Laboratory abnormalities without clinical significance should not be recorded as AEs or 
SAEs. However, laboratory abnormalities as per the investigator’s assessment (eg, clinical chemistry, h aematology, and urinalysis abnormalities) that require medical or 
surgical intervention or lead to IMP interruption, modification, or discontinuation must be recorded as an AE or SAE, as applicable. In addition, laboratory or other abnormal assessments (eg, in ECGs, X-rays, or vital signs) that are associated with signs and/or symptoms must be recorded as an AE or SAE if they meet the definition of an AE or SAE as described in Sections  7.1 and 7.1.2. Any worsening of existing abnormalities that 
are associated with signs and/or symptoms (except for SCCHN -related pre-existing 
conditions, including disease progression [see Section  7.3]) should be reported as AEs or 
SAEs, as appropriate. If the laboratory abnormality is part of a syndrome, record the syndrome or diagnosis (eg, ana emia), not the laboratory result (ie, decreased 
haemoglobin). 
For specific information on handling of clinical laboratory abnormalities, see 
Section  5.3.2. 
7.1.[ADDRESS_428366]  
The AESIs for this study are anaemia and hypothyroidism. 
AESIs of anaemia will be defined as  CTCAE Grade ≥3 anaemia . Please refer to 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for details regarding the detection and management of potential cases of 
anaemia. AESIs of hypothyroidism will be defined as TSH levels of ≥10 mIU/L . AESI will be 
unconfirmed with only one test. Please refer to Section  [IP_ADDRESS] for details regarding the 
detection and management of hypothyroidism. The AESI should be reported by [CONTACT_344841] 24 hours of learning about the event by [CONTACT_344842]. The documentation and processing of AESIs is furthe r 
detailed in the investigator site file.  
Investigators will indicate on the relevant Adverse Event eCRF page if the event meets the criteria for an AESI.  
7.2 Assessment of Adverse Events  
7.2.1 Severity  
The terms serious and severe are not synonymous. The general term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event; the event itself, however, may

 Confidential   
    be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a Grade 3 headache). This is NOT 
the same as serious, which is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient ’s life or ability to function (see Section 7.1.2). A severe AE (classified as 
Grade 3) does not necessarily need to be considered serious. For example, a WBC count of 1000/mm
3 to less than 2000/mm3 is considered Grade 3 (severe ) but may not be 
considered serious. Seriousness (not intensity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
Investigators will grade all AEs by [CONTACT_344843] (Version 5.0).  
If an AE is not listed in the CTCAE criteria, a corresponding grading is to be performed 
by [CONTACT_166551]/her best medical judgment as follows: 
• Mild (Grade 1): asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated 
• Moderate (Grade 2): minimal, local , or noninvasive intervention indicated; limited 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)  
• Severe (Grade 3): medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_344789]; disabling; or limiting 
self-care ADL  
• Life-threatening (Grade 4): life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention 
indicated  
• Death (Grade 5): death related to an AE  
7.2.2 Causality  
Investigators are required to systematically assess the causal relationship between the 
AEs and SAEs and the exposure to the IMP using the following definitions: 
Related:  
• The AE has a reasonable possibility of an association with the IMP because: 
o The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence to I MP administration, and 
cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_102]’s clinical state or other risk 
factors (eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, or concomitant 
medications).  
o The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence to I MP administration, and it 
is a known reaction to the drug under study or a related chemical group or is 
predicted by [CONTACT_344844] .

    Not Related:  
• The AE does not follow a reasonable sequence from IMP administration, or it can be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_102] ’s clinical state or other  risk factors (eg, disease 
under study, concurrent diseases, and concomitant medications). 
7.[ADDRESS_428367] IMP administration . 
Occurrence of AEs may be volunteered spontaneously by [CONTACT_102] ; discovered as a 
result of general, nonleading verbal questioning by [CONTACT_5984]; or determined by 
[CONTACT_166552]. All AEs will be monitored and recorded in the eCRF throughout the entire study. Note that worsening of SCCHN- related 
pre-existing conditions, including disease progression, will not be reported as AEs. An 
event solely attributed to tumour progression should not be reported as an AE, unless the 
signs and symptoms of the event are more severe than expected for the patient`s 
condition. If the criteria for an AE is not met, disease progression will be recorded as efficacy data. Worsening of other existing abnormalities that are associated with signs and/or symptoms should be reported as AEs (or SAEs), as appropriate.  Any event that 
meets one or more of the seriousness criteria will be reported as an SAE per the procedures outlined in S ection 7.4. 
For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information (a description of the event, severity, time of occurrence, including whether the AE onset was before, during, or after the I MP administration if the AE started on a dosing day, duration, and 
any action, eg, treatment/follow-up tests). The outcome of the event should be provided along with the investigator’s assessment of the relationship to the IMP. The investigator must also assess whether the event meets the criteria for classification as an SAE.  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all documentation (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11533], laboratory reports, and diagnostic reports) related to an AE. Wherever possible, the investigator’s diagnosis, not the individual signs and symptoms, will be documente d as 
the AE.  
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or unrelated SAEs after the patient ’s 
conclusion of study participation. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including death, at any time after a patient  has been discharged from the study, and 
he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the I MP or study participation, the 
investigator must promptly notify the sponsor. The investigator is expected to follow a potentially related SAE until it has resolved, it has resolved with sequelae, or the patient is lost to follow -up.

    7.4 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
For SAEs with an onset inside the reporting period (ie, onset after provision of informed 
consent and up to the EoT Visit) and SAEs considered related to IM P that occur after this 
reporting period ( ie, after the EoT until the Safety/Efficacy Follow- up Visit s), the 
investigator must immediately (no later than 24 hours after becoming aware of the event) inform the sponsor (or designee) of the SAE utilising the safety report form (refer to the SAE contact [CONTACT_344845]). 
The investigator is obliged to respond to any request for follow-up information ( eg, 
additional information, event outcome, final evaluation, or other records where needed) 
or to any question the sponsor (or designee) may have concerning the SAE within the same timelines as those noted above for initial reports. This is necessary to ensure prompt assessment of the event by [CONTACT_456] (or designee) and , as applicable, to allow the 
sponsor to meet strict regulatory timelines associated with expedited reporti ng obligations 
for events of this nature. 
7.5 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Follow- up 
During the study (and after the patient’s participation in the study has ended), all AEs and 
SAEs should be followed proactively by [CONTACT_344846] a level acceptable to the investigator, until the event is otherwise 
explained, or until the patient is lost to follow -up. At the time the patient ’s study 
participation ends, all ongoing AEs and SAEs should be evaluated for resolution. New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed e CRF , and the 
investigator will submit any updated SAE information to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of receipt of the information. 
7.6 Safety Reporting Oversight  
In accordance with ICH guidelines GCP, the sponsor (or designee) will inform 
investigators of “findings that could affect adversely the safety of patients, impact the 
conduct of the study, or alter the  Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics 
Committee  (IEC) ’s approval/ favourable opi[INVESTIGATOR_43932].” 
The sponsor (or designee) has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of an IM P under clinical 
investigation. The sponsor (or designee) will comply with country-specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRB/IEC, and investigators. To support compliance with these requirements, the investigator must provide requested information in a timely m anner.

8.1 General Procedures  
The statistical analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_344847].  
With the exception of the unblinded statistician and programmers supporting the IDMC , 
all personnel involved with the analysis of the study will remain blinded until database 
lock and identification of protocol deviations. Analyses will be performed using SAS® 
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC, US) by [CONTACT_17091]. 
A detailed description of all statistical analyses to be performed for this study and any 
deviations from the analysis detailed in the protocol will be outlined in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). A first version of the SAP will be prepared prior to the inclusion of the first study patient, and the SAP will be approved prior to database lock and unblinding of the study data. 
All data will be presented by [CONTACT_1570]. For qualitative variables, the population 
size (N for sample size and n for available data) and the percentage (of available data) for each class of the variable will be presented. Quantitative variables will be summarised using descriptive statistics, inc luding n, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, 
minimum, and maximum values. Graphical presentations of the data will be produced to aid interpretation.  
Baseline is defined as the last nonmissing measurement before or on the date of first administration of I MP, unless otherwise stated in the SAP. 
A strategy for dealing with data affected by [CONTACT_344848], pharmacokineticist and statistician prior to database lock. Data from patients who discontinue from the study, or who have missing values for ot her 
reasons, will be included in the analysis in such a way as to minimise any possible bias. 
An initial data cut-off will occur approximately [ADDRESS_428368] been reported. During ongoing review of the overall progression event count, if the predicted timing of the initial and updated analyses are expected to be close in proximity, one analysis may be performed. 
Investigators and patients will continue to be blinded to randomised study treatment after 
initial unblinding of data for the primary analysis until the final database lock.

After approximately  12 patients (6 per treatment group) have completed their Baseline 
and post-treatment biopsy, initial gene expression and biomarker data in tumour tissue 
may be reviewed by [CONTACT_456], who will remain masked to randomised treatment assignment. A second review may be performed, if required. Analyses will be descriptive only. Further details will be provided in the SAP. 
8.2 Analysis Populations 
The Full  Analysis Set (FAS)  will include all randomised patients who receive at least

8.3 Sample Size 
An overall sample size of approximately 50 patients (25 per treatment group ) is 
considered sufficient to assess the primary endpoint of the best percentage change in 
tumour size following treatment with setanaxib when administered with pembrolizumab, 
versus placebo when administered with pembrolizumab, in patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN. With [ADDRESS_428371], there will 
be 85% power to detect a 20% mean difference between the treatment group s in best 
percentage change in tumour size, with an estimated SD  of 30% and a 2-sided alpha of 
20%. To mitigate risks from a higher than expected number of patients discontinuing the

tumour tissue, and gene expression analysis in tumour tissue will be used to determine proof-of-concept. With 25 patients per treatment group, there will be 90% power to detect a limit fold change (LFC) of more than 1.[ADDRESS_428373] >80% power to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in PFS with 2 -sided p<0.2. 
8.4 Statistical Methods  
8.4.1 Statistical Hypothesis  
The statistical hypothesis to be tested for the primary analysis with change in tumour size as the primary endpoint is as follows: 
• H0: the average change in the tumour size between the treatment groups are the same  
• HA: the average change in the tumour size between the treatment groups are 
different  
The simple null hypotheses (H0) for the primary analysis using the t- test assumes that the 
observation for the difference in the best percentage change in tumour size for patients 
between the 2 treatment groups will follow a normal distribution with mean zero and a constant unknown variance. The composite alternative hypothesis (HA) assumes that the observation for the difference in the best percentage change in tumour size for patients between the [ADDRESS_428374] on which the primary analysis is based. For the sample size calculation this non-centrality parameter was assumed to be 20%.

analysis will be based on the FAS and will evaluate the effect of setanaxib on best percentage change in tumour size from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model including a term for the best percentage change in tumour size , a covariate for B aseline 
tumour size and a term for treatment. The number of patients, unadjusted mean, and adjusted least -square means (lsmeans) for each treatment group will be presented, 
together with the difference in adjusted lsmeans, 80% confidence interval, and corresponding p- value from the fitted ANCOVA model.  
The primary estimand considered here is to compare the best percentage change in tumour size per RECIST v1.1 in recurrent or metastatic SCCHN adult patients treated with setanaxib and pembrolizumab versus patients treated with placebo and pembrolizumab. 
The attributes of the primary estimand considered are listed as follows: 
• Population: patients aged ≥18 years with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN who are 
eligible for treatment with pembrolizumab monotherapy 
• Treatment: s etanaxib + pembrolizumab versus placebo + p embrolizumab  
• Variable: best percentage change in tumour size defined as the percentage change from Baseline in the sum of diameters of target lesions, as assessed by [CONTACT_393] v1.1 
• Population level summary: to evaluate the percentage mean difference in the tumour size between the competing treatment groups. The main results to ascertain the difference w ill be the p -value of treatment comparison obtained from the coefficient 
from the fitted ANCOVA model and the value of the coefficient as an estimate of the treatment effect of the percentage change between the competing treatment groups 
with its 80% confidence intervals  
• Intercurrent e vents: premature study discontinuation, study drug 
interruption/premature discontinuation, use of certain alternative or additional therapy including a new anti- cancer therapy  
The PFS follow-up will continue to objective progression regardless of the stated intercurrent events. Patients who withdraw completely from the study will be right-censored. For the patients who are right-censored, the time until which they were in the study from the randomisation would be recorded as the right- censored time. The 
treatment policy strategy used addresses the intercurrent events listed above. The occurrence of the intercurrent event in this case is considered irrelevant in defining the

whether or not the intercurrent events occur. For example, when specifying how to address use of additional anti-cancer therapy prior to disease progression as an intercurrent event, the values of the variable of interest will be used whether or not the 
patient takes the additional anti- cancer therapy. In the case of premature study 
discontinuation, and whether or not a patient experiences changes in other treatments (eg, background or concomitant treatments), the intercurrent event will be considered to be part of the treatments being compared. In that case, this reflects the comparison under the usual intent- to-treat principle as the effect of a treatment policy.

An updated analysis may be performed after [ADDRESS_428379] been reported. At the updated analysis, ORR, PFS, DoR, DCR, and OS will be summarised and safety data summaries will be updated as appropriate.  
The key secondary endpoint of PFS  will be summarised by [CONTACT_5263]- Meier plots presented 
by [CONTACT_6660]. Median PFS and the proportion of patients  who are progression- free 
at 3, 6, and 12 months will be summarised  along with 80% confidence intervals presented 
for each treatment group. Patients who have not progressed by [CONTACT_344803]- off 
for the updated analysis will be censored. The comparison between the treatment groups of PFS will be performed by [CONTACT_6486] a Cox proportional hazard model ( Cox 1975) with 
treatment group as the only covariate. The hazard ratio for PFS , based on the profile 
partial likelihood from the fitted using C ox proportional hazards model, will be 
calculated as a measure of the treatment effect along with the respective 95% Wald confidence interval and the asymptotic p- value from the Wald test for the difference in 
the log hazards in the fitted model. 
The secondary endpoint of OS will not be formally compared between the treatment 
groups but will be summarised in a Kaplan- Meier plot together with descriptive statistics, 
as described for PFS.  
The secondary endpoints of ORR , DoR, and DCR will be summarised using descriptive 
statistics for each treatment group and associated 90% Agresti -Coull confidence interval.  
For the key secondary endpoints of numbers of CAF s, CD8
+ TILs , and regulatory T- cells, 
and the secondary endpoint of PD -L1 expression analysis in tumour tissue, it is 
hypothesised based on the mode of action of setanaxib that there will be a reduction in CAF s level and an increase in the number of CD8

within treatment groups (ie, across paired tissue samples) and between treatment groups will be summarised. An ANCOVA model will be used to assess for significant differences after adjustment for Baseline differences . The treatment effect from the fitted 
ANCOVA model will estimate the treatment difference based on mean score.  A 
logarithmic tra nsformation will be applied prior to analysis, if appropriate. 
For the secondary endpoint of changes in patterns of gene expression and differential gene expression in tumour tissue, data will be displayed graphically and will be assessed by [CONTACT_344849]. Detailed analysis methodology will be described in the SAP.

residuals for each treatment groups. The ASSESS statement with ODS Graphics  in 
PROC PHREG step in SAS will perform this using both graphical and numerical methods of Lin, Wei, and Ying 1993 ( Lin et al  199
 3). A violation of the proportional 
hazard assumption will indicate that the results obtained from the fitted Cox proportional hazard model w ill be invalid. In such circumstances, a modified max combo 
(Roychoudhury et al 2021) using the Fleming and Harrington 1981 weights ( Fleming & 
Harrigton 1981) such as FH(0,0), FH(0.5,0.5), FH(0,0.5), FH(0.5,0) will be implemented for estimating the performance of the competing treatment groups for PFS. The p- value 
obtained from each of the modified max combo tests will be reported. 
For each of the fitted ANCOVA models in the primary efficacy analysis and the 
secondary efficacy analyses , a plot of the residuals against the fitted values from the 
ANCOVA model will be produced to check for randomness in the plot. This is to check for the assumption of constant variance of the fitted model. Any systematic effect in this residual plot will indicate that a suitable transformation should be applied on the response of the model as appropriate to stabilise the variability of the error. A normal probability plot will also be plotted of the residuals of each of the fitted ANCOVA model to check if this fairly fits a straight line. Significant deviation from a straight line in this residual plot 
will indicate the violation of the ANCOVA model assumptions of the errors being normally distributed. In such cases, logarithmic transformations on the response will be applied, as appropriate, to normalise the data. The ANCOVA in such scenario will be fitted again on the log-normal response with log baseline values as the covariate, and the validity of the assumption of the fitted transformed model will be check ed similarly. The 
response here for the fitted ANCOVA is the post- dose baseline ratio. If the assumptions

censored. A competing risk approach w ill therefore be implemented by [CONTACT_344850] (1999) model ( Fine & Gray 1999).  A treatment effect in such cases w ill be 
estimated using the cumulative incidence function for a given cause. This is defined as the probability of a patient facing an event due to a given cause before a pre- specified 
time in the clinical study. The  Fine and Gray (1999) model w ill be fitted considering time 
to disease progression as the main cause of interest and death due to any cause as the competing cause with treatment as the only explanatory variable. Similar to the Cox proportional hazard model, the placebo + pembrolizumab treatment group w ill be 
considered as the comparator group in the fitted model with the regression coefficient in the Fine and Gray (1999) model comparing the difference in the log-sub-distribution hazards between the competing treatment groups. The estimated ratio of the sub -
distribution hazard for disease progression w ill be an estimator of the treatment effect and 
will be obtained by [CONTACT_344851] (1999) model. This estimate w ill be reported along with the 95% profile partial 
likelihood based Wald confidence interval for the estimated ratio of the sub-distribution hazard for disease progression. 
A plot of the Cumulative Incidence Functions for facing disease obtained from the fitted 
Fine and Gray (1999) model at various time during the study w ill also be depi[INVESTIGATOR_1230] , and

    800 mg BID of s etanaxib  has been shown to increase the plasma concentration of 
sensitive CYP2C9 , CYP2C19 and OAT3 transporter substrates  less than two -fold. 
Caution should be exercised during concomitant use of such drugs with setanaxib  due to 
risk of increased drug concentrations . Setanaxib has potential induction effects on 
CYP2B6 . Sensitive substrates of CYP2B6 should be used with caution due to risk of 
decreased drug concentration and reduced efficacy. In addition, setanaxib inhibited 
BCRP and MDR1 (P -gp) in vitro. This may result in increased exposures of applicable 
concomitant medications, and hence caution should be exercised with use of sensitive BCRP and P -gp substrates. 
Some examples of sensitive CYP2C9 , CYP2C19, CYP2B6, OAT3 , BCRP, and P-gp 
substrates are included in Table 7, however the list is not comprehensive.

    17.4 APPENDIX I V – RECIST v1.1 Methodology 
Response evaluation criteria in solid tumours: Revised RECIST criteria  (Eisenhauer et al 
2009) are summari sed below. 
Measurable/Non -Measurable Lesions . Each tumour lesion or site of disease identified 
at baseline is categori sed as either a measurable lesion or a non -measurable lesion 
according to the following definitions. 
Lesion Type  Qualifying Definition  
Measurable  Tumo ur lesions: Must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest 
diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of [ADDRESS_428409]  or MRI  scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm.). 
 
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be [ADDRESS_428410] or MRI scan (CT 
scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in 
follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.  
Non-Measurable  All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological 
lymph nodes with 10 to <15 mm short axis) as well as truly non- measurable lesions. 
Lesions considered truly non- measurable include leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic 
involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly i dentified 
by [CONTACT_87415].  
Special considerations regarding lesion measurability: 
Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treated with local therapy require 
particular comment: 
Bone lesions: 
• Bone scan, PET scan, or plain films are not considered adequate imaging 
techniques to measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to 
confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions. 
• Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic- blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
components, that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_344872]. 
• Blastic bone lesions are non -measurable.  
Cystic lesions:  
• Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since 
they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts. 
• ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above.

 Confidential   
    However, if non- cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred 
for selection as target lesions.  
Lesions with prior local treatment:  
Tumo ur lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other 
locoregional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been 
demonstrated progression in the lesion. All measurements should be recorded in metric 
notation, using calipers if clinically assessed. All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than [ADDRESS_428411] diameter (LD) for all target lesions provides a quantitative means of characteri sing objective tumour response to 
treatment as follows:  
Evaluation Criteria Used for Categori sing Treatment Response of Target Lesions  
Response Category  Definition  
Complete Response 
(CR)  Disappearance of all target lesions  
Partial Response (PR)  >30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking 
as reference the baseline sum LD  
Progressive Disease 
(PD)  >20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the 
smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one 
or more new lesions  
Stable Disease  
(SD)  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify 
for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started  
Non-Target Lesions. Non -target lesions are other lesions (or sites of disease) not 
identified as target lesions at baseline. These include both non- measurable lesions as well 
as measurable lesions exceeding the maximum number allowed per organ or in total. The 
response of non- target lesions to treatment is evaluated on the basis of their presence or 
absence as follows:  
Evaluation Criteria Used for Categori sing Treatment Response of Non -Target Lesions  
Response Category  Definition  
Complete Response (CR)  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normali sation of tumo ur 
marker levels initially above upper limits of normal  
Progressive Disease (PD)  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression 
of existing non -target lesions  
Non-CR/Non -PD Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of 
tumo ur marker level above the normal limits  
To achieve “unequivocal progression” on the basis of non- target lesions, there must be an 
overall level of substantial worsening in non- target disease such that, even in presence of 
SD or PR in target lesions, the overall tumour burden has increased suffic iently to merit

For example, a patient w ho has SD at first assessment, PR at second assessment, and PD on last 
assessment has a best overall response of PR. In the case of SD, follow -up measurements 
must have met the SD criteria at least once with a minimum interval of at least 6  weeks 
from randomisation.

Duration of Response. The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive dis ease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). 
Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for progression

Version and Date: Version 4.0 (25 April 2023 ) Page [ADDRESS_428414] measurements recorded since the treatment 
started.  
Response review  
For studies where the response rate is the primary endpoint it is strongly recommended that all responses be reviewed by [CONTACT_13461](s) independent of the study at the study’s completion. Simultaneous review of the patients’ files and radiological images is the best approach. 
Reporting of results  
All patients included in the study must be assessed for response to treatment, even if there are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible.  
All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria should be included in the main analysis of the response rate.  
All conclusions should be based on all eligible patients. 
Sub-analyses may then be performed on the basis of a subset of patients, excluding those 
for whom major protocol deviations have been identified (eg, early death due to other reasons, early discontinuation of treatment, major protocol violations, etc). However, these sub -analyses may not serve as the basis for drawing conclusions concerning 
treatment efficacy, and the reasons for excluding patients from the analysis should be clearly reported.

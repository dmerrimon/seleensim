 2.0 Introduction 
 
2.1 Background and Rationale  
Focal dystonia is a neurological movement disorder characterized by [CONTACT_570125], severely impairing a person’s ability to function in 
their daily life. Often patients are misdiagnosed and receive years of unnecessary treatment.  
Adductor spasmodic dysphonia (AdSD) is the primary form of laryngeal dystonia and is characterized by [CONTACT_570126], leading to intermittent hyper -adduction of the true vocal folds (‘vocal cords’) during speech ( Aminoff  
et al. , 1978). This results in severe difficulty in speaking, hindering effective 
communication and severely reducing quality of life.   The cause of AdSD is unknown and there are no treatments that produce long -term 
benefits. Neuroimaging and neurophysiology studies have suggested that AdSD and other focal dystonias are associated with decreased inhibition and excessive plasticity in 
sensorimotor areas in the brain ( Kimberley  et al. , 2009; Kimberley and Pi[INVESTIGATOR_41274], 2012; 
Kimberley  et al. , 2013; Kimberley  et al. , 2015a ; Samargia et al. , 2016 ). However, to our 
knowledge, no studies have investigated the effects of modulating excitability of the 
laryngeal motor cortex in healthy individuals or AdSD. This gap in the field is likely due to challenges in recording corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_570103].  
 [CONTACT_570144]’s team has developed a transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) method to 
assess the cortical representation and excitability of the thyroarytenoid, a muscle affected in AdSD. Using this method, TMS data indicate differences in inhibition in people with 
AdSD vs. healthy controls. For this pi[INVESTIGATOR_16080], we  propose to further explore this 
excitability difference by [CONTACT_570127] -frequency inhibitory r epetitive 
TMS (rTMS) applied to the laryngeal motor cortex of individuals with AdSD and healthy 
controls. Considering that rTMS at low frequencies (≤1 Hz) produces lasting inhibition in a process analogous to long -term depression, and that AdSD is associated wit h decreased 
cortical inhibition, the purpose of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_570104], feasibility and 
response to 1Hz rTMS to the laryngeal motor cortex in individuals with AdSD and healthy people.  
2.2 Device Description  
We will utilize two Magstim 2002 devices (US FDA #K060847) with a Bistim 70- mm 
figure -eight coil. rTMS will be deliver ed with air-film coils (real) and a Magstim Ra pid2 
device (US FDA #K051864). For data acquisition, the electrode wires will be  connected to 
a bipolar  electromyograph y (EMG ) pre-amplifier (Y03, Motion Lab Systems, Inc., LA, 
[LOCATION_003]) with the gain of x300. The EMG signal will be passed through a band- pass filter with 
the cutoff frequencies of 15Hz and 2000Hz and then digitized by [CONTACT_570128] -to-digital 
convertor (NI 9234, National Instruments Corporation, Austin, TX, [LOCATION_003]) with a resolution of 24-bits at a sampling rate of 6400Hz.  Both TMS devices are used for investigational purposes and labeled with  the following 
statement: CAUTION – Investigational Device. Limited by [CONTACT_570129] l law to 
investigational use. 
[ADDRESS_747924]’s possession at any 
time.   
 
3.[ADDRESS_747925]  is to determine safety, feasibility and response to 1Hz rTMS to 
the laryngeal motor cortex in individuals with AdSD and healthy people . The following 
Aims will be tested : 
 
Aim 1: D etermine safety and feasibility for the a pplication of 1 Hz rTMS to the laryngeal 
motor cortex. 
Hypothesis: rTMS to laryngeal motor cortex will be safe and feasible as measured by [CONTACT_570130] 100% study completion by [CONTACT_4317]. 
 
Aim 2 : Determine amount of intracortical inhibition in the laryngeal motor cortex as 
measured in the thyroarytenoid both within and between groups before and after rTMS. 
Hypotheses:  
• The AdSD  group will demonstrate less inhibition in the laryngeal motor cortex at 
baseline.  
• rTMS  will increase intracortical inhibition for the laryngeal motor cortex in both 
groups, but AdSD individuals will show greater changes. 
• There will be no difference between groups at posttest suggesting a normalizing of 
intracortical inhibition.  
 
Aim 3 : Explore changes in voice quality following rTMS with a blinded assessment by a 
voice expert.  
Hypothesi s: Clinical scores will show a trend toward improved voice quality  in people with 
AdSD. 
 
4.0 Study Design  
 4.1 Overview of Study Design 
This experiment is a  pi[INVESTIGATOR_570105] s: AdSD 
compared to healthy controls , before and after rTMS delivery. Participants will be asked to 
come to the University of Minnesota for 1 session . 
 
4.2 Anticipated Duration of the Clinical Inves tigation 
The study’s duration is anticipated to require [ADDRESS_747926] participation, subjects would be withdrawn in accordance with Section 5.10.  
11 
 4.3 Evaluation Criteria/Effectiveness  
 
4.3.1 Primary Endpoint  
The primary clinical endpoint will be c orticospi[INVESTIGATOR_570106]- frequency rTMS . 
 
4.3.2 Secondary Endpoint s 
Secondary endpoints will include clinical voice measures collected before and after 
rTMS procedures  with a blinded assessment by a voice expert  (Cara Donohue , SLP, 
and Sharyl S amargia , CCC- SLP, PhD ) (Zraick  et al. , 2011; Samargia et al. , 2016). 
In addition, s elf-reported voice disability will be assessed prior to rTMS delivery. 
 
4.[ADDRESS_747927] size 
calculations for future investigations. 
 We plan to enroll 40 subjects  (20 people with AdSD and 20 healthy controls). Due to 
the voluntary nature of our recruitment efforts, we expect a small number to dropout or fail screening qualifications. To ensure the needed number of enrollees, [ADDRESS_747928] Recruitment  
Healthy participants : Subjects will be recruited from the general public. University 
and local community advertisement will be made. Subjects will then self -identify if 
interested to learn more about the study. 
 
Spasmodic dysphonia participants : Subjects will be recruited fro m several sources:  
1. People with AdSD who have directly contact[CONTACT_183774]. Teresa Kimberley  about 
research opportunities and patients that have participated in other studies from our team will be inquired if they are interested in this new pi[INVESTIGATOR_16080]. Study 
staff will contact [CONTACT_570131]. 
2. [CONTACT_414071] will ask his patient’s that have AdSD if they are interested in hearing more about a study they may qualify for and if so will give him/her a flyer or direct him/her to talk to other study staff to learn more.  
3. University and local community advertisement will be made. Postings also will 
be made on support group websites and organizations for dystonia. Subjects will 
then self -identify if interested to learn more about the study. 
  
[ADDRESS_747929] at the CTSI and, 
if positive, they will not be allowed to participate.  If they refuse testing as they are 
certain there is no risk they are pregnant, they will sign a waiver to clarify and be  
allowed to participate.  
 
4.4.4 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
The risk of seizures is acknowledged but we emphasize that because of standards set for rTMS  (Rossi  et al. , 2009; Rossini  et al. , 2015) this risk has been very well 
contained. Particularly due to our low rate stimulation and exclusion criteria we have minimized risk to participants. Our rTMS  parameters are well within these safety 
guidelines ( Rossi  et al. , 2009; Rossini  et al. , 2015) . However, we still recognize that 
this remote risk requires a rigorous safety plan. We will ask subjects if they have any 
other medical conditions and if they are taking any medications. Important medication  information such as any pro- epi[INVESTIGATOR_570107] a TMS -induced seizure. Subjects 
will also be screened for previous surgeries that might include metal, indwelling medical devices, etc. In the event of a seizure during rTMS, subje cts may be given 
oxygen by [CONTACT_570132], if the seizure does not abate in the expected time frame, the on -call physician may administer lorazepam or a related medication to 
interrupt the seizure. In the event of a headache from rTMS treatment, subject s may 
be given acetaminophen. See Brain Plasticity Lab white paper on TMS safety  
(attached) . 
 Patients with AdSD who  are currently receiving botulinum toxin injections will be 
asked about the duration between shots and scheduled to participate when their 
symptoms are reported to be the worst. This will typi[INVESTIGATOR_570108] [ADDRESS_747930]:

Primary exclusion for healthy participants (controls): 
(1) Any health condition or disability that would interfere with participation  
(2) Contraindications to TMS*  
(3) Medications with effect on CNS  
(4) Adult lacking ability to consent 
 *TMS contraindications: (1) The only absolute contraindication to TMS/rTMS is the presence of metallic hardware in close contact [CONTACT_570133] (such as cochlear implants, deep brain stimulator, or medication pumps). In such instances there is a risk of inducing malfunctioning of the implanted devices. 
(2) Conditions classified as of increased or uncertain risk are listed below  (Rossi  et 
al., 2009; Rossini et al. , 2015) . Persons under those circumstances will be 
excluded from the study.  
a. Pregnancy  
b. Bipolar disorder 
c. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_570109] 
d. Vascular, traumatic, tumoral, infectious, or metabolic lesion of the 
brain, even without history of seizure, and without anticonvulsant medication  
e. Use of medications that potentially lower seizure threshold  
f. Severe or recent heart disease  
(3) There is a small risk of fainting and hearing impairment with TMS/rTMS. For these reasons, the following precautions will be taken:  
a. Fainting: To avoid fainting, we will ask subjects to eat a full meal and drink extra decaffeinated fluids before study visits. We will also apply TMS and rTMS in a reclini ng chair.  
b. Hearing impairment: Participants will wear earplugs during the experiment to avoid hearing damage.

1. Subject voluntarily withdraws from the study. 
2. Subject death.  
3. Subject acquires any of the listed exclusion criteria.  
4. Subject completes the protocol. 
5. Subject’s wellbeing, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_570110].

5.0 Study Procedures  
 5.1 Informed Consent  
                 
5.1.1 Informed Consent   
All potential participants  will receive a consent form describing this study and 
providing sufficient information for subjects to make an informed decision about their participation in th e stud y. Please see consent form for specific wording that is 
tailored for each par ticipan t category: spasmodic dysphonia or healthy participant.  
 The consent form will be submitted with the protocol for review and will only be used once approval by [CONTACT_570134]. The formal consent of a 
subject, using the IRB -approved consent form, will be obtained before that subject is 
submitted to any study procedure. This consent form will be signed by [CONTACT_24484] -designated research prof essional obtaining the consent. A copy 
of the IRB -approved consent form will  be kept on- site and by [CONTACT_456] -
investigator.  
 
5.1.2 Vulnerable Populations      
No vulnerable populations are included.   
5.2 Allocation Scheme  
Individuals will be assigned to each group based on their diagnosis and symptoms. 
All subjects will be  assigned to the same procedures . 
 
5.3 Clinical Procedures  
Clinical assessment : Voice measures consisting of standard and published clinical 
scales will be  collected for all participants  to explore changes in voice quality 
(Zraick  et al. , 2011; Samargia  et al. , 2016). Voice quality will be measured by  
[CONTACT_7939] s ubjects to repeat 10 sentences with a high number of initial adductor 
phonemes, which ofte n elicit symptoms in those with AdSD. These voice samples 
will be acquired digitally using a microphone. The frequency of voice breaks in the 
15 
 recorded 10 sentences will be co unted. These voice breaks will be the measure of 
disease severity. Other voice characteristics will be assessed using the Consensus 
Auditory- Perceptual Evaluation of Voice ( CAPE -V) and the Voice Handicap Index 
(VHI). The CAPE -V is a reliable, valid clinica l measure used by [CONTACT_570135]. During a video recording, participants will be  asked to repeat 6 
sentences and then describe their voice problems. Voice experts will use  the 
recording to rate voice quality based on several criteria  (loudness, pi[INVESTIGATOR_23025], strain, 
breathiness, roughness, overall severity and others). In the current study, the total score in this scale will be used to rate the voice quality of participants before and after rTMS.  The VHI is a self -administered questionnaire with questions about how 
often a given voice -related problem affects the life of participants. It reliably 
measures the influence of the subjects’ voice disorder on their quality of life across three dimensions including: physical, functional and social. T he total score for each 
participant will be measured before rTMS to assess how the voice disorder affects  
quality of life.  
 
TMS testing : TMS testing will be performed to measure the corticospi[INVESTIGATOR_570111]. TMS testing will be completed according to 
established methods (Kimberley and Di Fabio , 2010; Samargia et al. , 2014; 
Kimberley  et al. , 2015a ; Kimberley  et al. , 2015b). Single  and paired -pulse TMS 
testing will be delivered with a 70 -mm figure -of-eight coil connected to a Magstim 
200 stimulator (Magstim Company, Dyfed, [LOCATION_006]), positioned on the scalp area over 
the left primary motor cortex . The laryngeal motor cortex will be identified by 
[CONTACT_570136] ( MEP ) of the thyroarytenoid muscle . Cortical 
stimulation will be spatially tracked with a neuronavigation system (BrainSight, 
Rogue Research Inc. Quebec, Canada) to decrease variability of stimulus delivery .  
 The TMS variables that will be measured in the study include single pulses that evoke a response in the muscle. The variable of interest is the amplitude of motor evoked potential (MEP) in response to different stimulation intensities and duration of silent period after the evoked response. Testing will include no more than 200 pulses (rTMS delivery will involve 1200 pulses  — see below) . Overall, the  testing 
procedures will take approximately 60 minutes (30 minutes before and 30 after 
rTMS).  
Fine-wire electrodes : All participants will undergo vocal muscle testing using fine -
wire EMG. With the subject seated in a supportive chair, fine- wire EMG electrodes 
will be inserted in the thyroarytenoid muscle s (the “vocal cords”) by a trained 
physician, [CONTACT_414072]. The skin on the throat will be numbed using a lidocaine 
cream and also an injection of a lidocaine (numbing) agent. Once the skin  has been 
numbed, the electrode will be placed into the muscle. To place the electrode, two fine wires will be inserted using a small gauge needle (30MM, 27 guage) with the edges of the wire electrode hooked around the tip of the needle and connected to an  
EMG machine. The needle will be passed through the skin and into the larynx. When the vocal cord is entered, an increased EMG signal associated with speech is detected. The needle will then be removed, leaving only the flexible wires in place. 
[ADDRESS_747932]. At the end of the testing for vocal muscles, the electrodes will be gently pulled out. This process is nearly unnoticeable due to the very small diameter of the wires.  
Procedures will be the same as previous study (IRB # 0608M91226. Study Title  
“Pathophysiology of Spasmodic dysphonia: a TMS study” ). 
 
rTMS application: rTMS will be delivered to the left laryngeal motor cortex with a 
hand-held figure -of-eight coil  positioned over the scalp and connected to a Rapid2 
magnetic stimulator (Magstim Company, Dyfed, [LOCATION_006]) . The protocol described below  
is FDA approved and has been used extensively by [CONTACT_570137]. The risk of seizure is minimized by [CONTACT_2329] a low rate of stimulation and a sub -threshold level 
of intensity.  
 All participants  will receive low-fr equency r TMS pulse s. rTMS at a low frequency is 
known to be inhibitory to the neurons re ceiving the stimulation. rTMS  will be 
delivered at  90% of the threshold which elicits MEPs in the thyroarytenoid muscle, 
as determined during TMS testing. Pulses will be delivered at a frequency of 1 Hz 
without interruption (total = 1200 pulses) which has been shown to alter cortical 
excitability and behavior  (Gerschlager  et al. , 2001). rTMS delivery will take [ADDRESS_747933] preliminary data for feasibility and 
safety, sham rTMS will not be tested. 
 
5.4 Follow- Up Procedures and Therapy Transitions  
There are no follow -up procedures or therapy transitions. Subjects receiving 
botulinum toxin will be allowed to continue with injections as they desire.  
  
5.5 Study Timetable / Schedule of Events   
Pre-screening of all participants will be completed by [CONTACT_648], email or in person. 
Onsite testing  will include answering to study questionnaires , voice quality 
assessments, completing TMS tests, and the rTMS protocol. Testing  will occur prior 
to botulinum toxin injection  for those patients with AdSD currently being treated 
with the toxin . Data will be collect when symptoms are at their worst according to 
the patient’s self -report. However, due to the demanding time commitment placed on 
participants, flexibility will be allowed to modify the schedule if needed. B otulinum 
toxin injections will be administered by [CONTACT_20908]’s physician and the costs 
associated with injection will not be covered by [CONTACT_1758].

5.6 Study Protocol Compliance / Treatment Adherence  
Subjects will be notified of the voluntary nature of participation. In the consent 
forms, subjects are made aware of the resources for those who wish to withdraw from the study. Criteria and procedures for withdrawing subjects are noncompliance and disqualification by [CONTACT_570138], such as a developed neurological 
disease, implanted device, or pregnancy. See section 5.[ADDRESS_747934] Withdrawal  
 
5.8.1 How to Withdraw Subjects  
Subjects may be withdrawn from the study for the following reasons: 
o occurrence of intolerable pain or discomfort during testing  
o failure to attend scheduled testing or treatment sessions  
o subject consent withdrawal 
 In the event of subject withdrawa l, all collected data and personal information will 
be documented and kept private. If a subject is withdrawn from the study, they will keep their identifier code and an additional subject will be recruited to account for the needed subject sample. Withdrawn subjects will be documented and future participants will start at the beginning of the study.  Additional subjects will be drawn 
from the same pool of candidates who expressed interest in the study. The same 
recruitment procedures and experimental proced ures will be followed for all 
subjects.

explore for the effects of rTMS . Self-reported  voice disability will be measured 
before TMS testing  in participants with AdSD.  
 
6.2 Statistical Methods  
For both groups, c hanges from baseline will be ex plored for effects of rTMS in 
cortic ospi[INVESTIGATOR_570113]. Since this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_570114] , data will be analyzed with 
descriptive statistics  (measures of central tendency and variability) to look for trends 
related to rTMS  effects  and group. 
 
7.0 Safety and Adverse Events  
 
7.1 Definitions  
Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that 
develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study. Intercurrent  
illnesses or injuries will be regarded as adverse events. Abnormal results of 
laboratory or diagnostic procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality: 
• Results in study withdrawal 
• Is associated with a serious adverse event  
• Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• Leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• Is considered by [CONTACT_125943].  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event that is:  
• Fatal  
• Life-threatening  
• Requires or prolongs a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• A congenital anomaly or birth defect  
Important medical events are events that may not be immediately life -
threatening, but are clearly of major clinical significance and may be SAEs.  
[ADDRESS_747938], and may require intervention to prevent one 
or the other serious outcomes noted above.   
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_570115] (even if less than 24 hours) 
to a healthcare facility as a result of a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_355818]; to include transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_427807]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_570116] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], clinical advers e effect (e.g., for a preexisting condition not associated with a new 
adverse effect or with a worsening of the preexisting condition; admission for a protocol-specified procedure) is not, in itself, a serious adverse effect.  
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE)  
An unanticipated adverse device effect is any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated 
with, a device, if that effect problem, or death was not previously identified in natur e, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan, or any other 
unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk To Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845]) 
An adverse event that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_570117], related to the device, and serious. 
 7.2 Safety Monitoring Plan      
Plans to minimize risks to study participants: 
• All investigators and study staff have completed required training re: human 
subject protections. Study staff will comply with all related regulations and 
laws, included, but not limited to 45CFR parts 60 and 64, and HIPAA Privacy 
Regulations. 
• Subjects will be rigorously screened against inclusion/exclusion criteria to 
ensure that their participation is safe.  
• Research staff conducting clinical research procedures will be appropriately 
trained, licensed, credentialed and supervised  
• PI [INVESTIGATOR_570118] e events, feedback from 
subjects, observations from nurses, study staff, investigators and other safety 
indicators on a continuous basis.  
• To monitor symptoms or changes in health status due to TMS testing and rTMS 
delivery, participants will be asked to c omplete the form “Subject Report of 
Symptoms” before TMS testing, right after rTMS application, and at the end of 
the experiment so that the required actions are taken.  
• Study visits will be conducted at the CTSI Masonic Clinical Research Unit 
(MCRU)  or Delaware Clinical Research Unit (DCRU) which are staffed with 
back -up personnel and ha ve immediate access to Fairview’s emergency 
response personnel if needed.  
20 
 • PI [INVESTIGATOR_570119], completeness, clarity and timeliness of all study 
records.  
• Study data & information will be kept confidential and managed in accordance 
with requirements of HIPAA. All data will be stored in locked offices and not 
released without subject permission. 
• Subjects may discontinue participation at any time, for any reason.  Any subje ct 
observed to have unacceptable responses to research procedures, or to be unable 
to safely tolerate participation in the study will be withdrawn.  
7.2.1 Anticipated Risks / Risk Mitigation  
1. Personal information: There is a small risk of loss of confidentiality. S ubjects will 
be asked if they have any medical conditions and if they are taking any medications. 
This is important to know so that only those subjects who meet the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria are accepted into the study. A number of procedures are in place to 
protect participant confidentiality. Every participant enrolled in the study will 
receive a unique code number. All records and results will be labeled with this code 
number and the  code will be shared only with the study investigators. Any 
information that is included in published manuscripts (e.g. demographic 
information) will not be linked to any other information that would identify who the 
subject was.  
 
2. TMS: Risks associated with TMS are rare but should be recognized and prevented 
with appropriate precautions. Serious adverse risks include the induction of a 
seizure. There have been reports of a seizure and induced mania from rTMS but 
none of these side effects have been reported with the type of rTMS that we are 
doing in this study. Mild adverse effects include fainting, headache, dental pain, and 
other changes in memory, mood, and hearing. The overall occurrence of a mild 
adverse event is 5% in sham and real TMS sessions combined (Maizey  et al. , 2013 ). 
Participants will be asked to complete the form “Subject Report of Sym ptoms” 
before TMS testing and at the end of the experiment so that the required actions are 
taken in case there are any changes to their health status.  Participants will be 
instructed to contact [CONTACT_570139] e symptoms listed above 
after participation in the study . In addition, s tudy staff may contact [CONTACT_4317] (via 
email or phone call) to follow- up on any issues or symptoms that occur during the 
experiment . People with a history of seizure within the last two years or a history of 
bipolar disorder will not be allowed to participate in this study. The tests may be 
discontinued without the participant’s consent  if the study team observes any 
abnormal responses. TMS delivery may also interfere with implanted devices and, 
thus, TMS is not appropriate for persons with medical devices such as deep brain 
stimulators, pace makers and medication pumps. Currently, the effects of TMS on 
hormonal cycles and the unborn fetus are unknown. 
 
3. Needle ( fine- wire) electrodes: Risks associated with the electrode placement are 
very rare and include vocal cord hemorrhage, hoarseness of voice, infection, or 
dysphagia (difficulty swallowing). Participants should not be on any blood thinner 
medication to avoid vocal cord hemorrhage. We will clean and prep are the skin 
[ADDRESS_747939] findings to determine  
1) if the abnormal test finding should be classified as an adverse effect;  2) if there is a reasonable possibility that the adverse effect was caused by [CONTACT_67001], if applicable, other study treatment or diagnostic product(s); and  3) if the adverse effect meets the criteria for a serious adverse effect.  
If our fin al determination of causality is “unknown and of questionable relationship 
to the investigational device or, if applicable, other study treatment or diagnostic product(s)”, the adverse effect will be classified as associated with the use of the 
investigational device or study treatment or diagnostic drug product(s)  for reporting 
purposes. If our final determination of causality is “unknown but not related to the 
investigational device or, if applicable, other study treatment or diagnostic product(s)”, this determination and the rationale for the determination will be 
documented in the respective subject’s case history.  
 
22 
 7.4.1 Adverse Events:   
All observed or volunteered adverse effects and abnormal test findings, regardless of 
treatment group, if applicable, or suspected causal relationship to the investigational 
device or, if applicable, other study treatment or diagnostic product(s) will be recorded in the subjects’ case histories.  For all adverse effects, sufficient information 
will be pursued and/or obtained so as to permit: 
1) an adequate determination of the outcome of the effect (i.e., whether the 
effect should be classified as a serious adverse effect) and;  
2) an  assessment of the casual relationship between the adverse effect and the 
investigational device or, if applicable, the other study treatment or diagnostic product(s).   Adverse effects or abnormal test findings felt to be associated with the investigational device or, if applicable, other study treatment or diagnostic product(s) will be followed until the effect (or its sequelae) or the abnormal test finding resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the Sponsor -Investigator.  
 Adverse Events that do not qualify as Serious Adverse Events, or as Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects will be reported the IRB with the continuing review progress report.  These events will be reported to FDA with the IDE Annual Report. 
 
7.4.[ADDRESS_747940] information for Serious Adverse Event Notification: 
Mo Chen, PhD 612/624-5220 (Telephone)

7.4.3 Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects    
We will submit a completed Form  FDA 3500 A to the FDA’s Center for Devices 
and Radiological Health for any observed or volunteered adverse effect that is determined to be an unanticipated adverse device effect.  A copy of this completed 
form wil l be provided to all participating sub- investigators.   
 The completed Form FDA [ADDRESS_747941], meet the requirements for reporting; we will submit a completed Form  FDA 
[ADDRESS_747942] in light of the previous, similar repo rt(s).  
 We will report to the IRB any observed or volunteered adverse effect that is determined to meet all of the following criteria:  
1) associated with the investigational device or, if applicable, other study treatment or diagnostic product(s);  
2) a serious adverse effect; and  
3) an unexpected adverse effect.   
Applicable adverse effects will be reported to the IRB as soon as possible and, in no event, later than 10 calendar days following the Sponsor -Investigator’s receipt of the 
respective informatio n.  
 Adverse effects which are  
1) associated with the investigational drug or, if applicable, other study treatment or diagnostic product(s);  
2) fatal or life -threatening; and  
3) unexpected  
will be reported to the IRB within [ADDRESS_747943] of 1996 (HIPAA).  This study does not include the collection of PHI and hence will not

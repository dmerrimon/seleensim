1. Protocol Title  
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_555299]: A Randomized Controlled Trial  
2. Objectives  
Objective  
Our primary objective will be to determine if a strong opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], oxycodone, given at a dose 
recommended for severe pain in addition to ibuprofen decreases maximum pain scores 
compared to ibuprofen and placebo in women undergoing medical abortion. Results of 
this study will help future providers understand whether prescribing opi[INVESTIGATOR_555300].  
 
Hypothesis  
Women undergoing medical abortion up to 10 0/[ADDRESS_729034] 2 points lower on a numerical rating scale (NRS) 
compared to women receiving ibuprofen and placebo.   
 
Primary Outcome  
Maximum self-reported pain score on a NRS during the 24 hours after administration of 
misoprostol.   
 
Secondary Outcomes  
1. Maximal pain score stratified by [CONTACT_58032] (<7wks, 7 -10 0/7wks). We have powered 
our study in  order  to have sufficient sample size for this outcome.  
2. Pain level at time of participant -reported expulsion using 11 point NRS (Do you think you 
have passed the pregnancy? (yes/no).  If yes: What was your worst  pain at that time?  
3. Proportion  of women reporting a maximum pain score >7 pain score  
a. Oxycodone versus p lacebo arm  
b. Stratified by [CONTACT_555312] ( oxycodone versus placebo arm ) 
4. Number of tablets of oxycodone  and ibuprofen tablets used during the 24 hours after 
administration of misoprostol  
5. Use of rescue medication (yes/no)  
6. Number and chief complaints of subject initiated phone calls to the provider or clinic from 
time of mifepristone administration to scheduled f ollow -up appointment ; for participants 
who do not  show up to the follow -up visit, we will collect data on phone calls and 
complaints for 21 days following mifepristone administration. This information will be 
accessed through the Planned Parenthood of Colu mbia Willamette (PPCW ) electronic 
medical record.  
7. Presence of Nausea/Vomiting within  24 hours  
8. Participant satisfaction with pain management (collected by [CONTACT_555313]: “Were 
you satisfied with the pain medications you received? (Yes/no)”  
9. Need for additional pain medications (marijuana, opi[INVESTIGATOR_555301]): “Did you use 
any additional pain medications  or substances  other than what was given to you through 
the study ? (Yes/no)”; If yes: “ What  did you use? Freetext response)”

3. Background  
Medical abortion is very common with over a quarter million performed in the [LOCATION_002] in 
2011.1 Medical abortion, induced by [CONTACT_555314] -receptor modulator, 
mifepristone, and prostaglandin analogue, misoprostol, has been widely researched to optimize 
dosing.2 However, abortion -related pain has not been systematically studied in clinical trials, 
limiting our ability to recommend app ropriate analgesia.3 Medical abortion has been described 
as painful in 36 -86% of patients.4-[ADDRESS_729035] of women reported more pain than 
anticipated and found the magnitude of pain unacceptable.5,7 
 
Nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the cornerstone of analgesia regimens for 
abortion -related pain. NSAIDs inhibit the action of cyclooxygenase, an enzyme responsible for 
the formation of prostaglandins, which are known to cause crampi[INVESTIGATOR_109688].[ADDRESS_729036] to NSAIDs to aid in pain control for medical 
abortion, with up to 79% of patients using at least one dose when  prescribed .12 However, there 
is scant evidence to support using this treatment for reducing  crampi[INVESTIGATOR_555302]; only one randomized controlled trial exists, and it did not demonstrate an 
improvement in pain.[ADDRESS_729037] .  
 
Immediate release oxycodone has a rapid onset with analgesia noted as early as 10 minutes, 
peaking at one hour, and lasting for 4 hours, and is prescribed for severe pain. In a randomized 
double blind control trial  in patients with moderate to severe pain , oxycodone 5mg/ibuprofen 
400mg provided significantly greater  analgesia compared to oxycodone 5mg/acetaminophen 
325mg and hydrocodone 7.5mg/acetaminophen 500mg.14,[ADDRESS_729038] a benefit of using opi[INVESTIGATOR_555303].

routinely prescribing opi[INVESTIGATOR_555304]. An internal review revealed no changes in 
overall patient satisfaction and no increase in provider pho ne calls. They performed [ADDRESS_729039] year.  
 
4. Study Design  
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial of women undergoing medical abortion 
through 10 0/[ADDRESS_729040] (IRB) at Oregon Health and Science 
University (OHSU) as well as approval from Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) . 
 
Following written informed consent, women will be  stratified based on gestational age of <7 weeks 
or 7-10 weeks and then  randomized to either oxycodone  or placebo arm. Randomization will occur 
using a predetermined computer -generated blocked randomizati on and will be allocated using 
sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes prepared and pre -packaged by [CONTACT_555315]. Study staff, investigators, and participants will be blinded to study arm 
allocation. Placebo and study drugs will be si milar in appearance due to over -encapsulation of 
study drugs by [CONTACT_555316]. Study drug allocation and study medications will be 
given out in a consecutive fashion stratified by [CONTACT_58032]. For example, study medications 
will be labelle d as follows: subject #5, <[ADDRESS_729041] her phone . Text 
messages through the TextIt platform will be utilized to send timed questions for data collection. 
The account will be linked to a dedicated study telephone and the number will be provided to study 
participants.  
 
Drug Dosing Guidelines for Pain  
Initial dosing:  
 Placebo Arm: Subjects will take ibuprofen 800mg just prior to misoprostol administration. 
They will take placebo at the start of painful uterine contractions.  
 Study drug (o xycodone ) Arm: The oxycodone arm will take ibuprofen 800mg just prior to 
misoprostol administration. They  will take oxycodone 10mg at the start of painful uterine 
contractions .  
 
Re-dosing: Subjects will be able to re -dose ibuprofen 800mg every 8 hours as needed.

8. Data Analysis  
We will use descriptive statistics to characterize the sample and test for differences in baseline demographic 
and clinical characteristics between treatment groups using Student’s t -test, the Wilcoxon rank -sum test, 
Pearson’s chi -squared test, or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate.

model, o r a linear model on transformed data, depending on distribution of the data and model fit, with 
treatment group as the main predictor and adjusted for gestational age group and baseline demographic 
and clinical variables.  
 
To make use of the repeated pain measures, we will use a generalized estimating equation (GEE) 
to model pain scores during the first 24 hours.  
 
We will use logistic regression models to examine differences between groups in the following outcomes 
(all mod els will have treatment group as the main predictor and will be adjusted for gestational age group 
and baseline demographic and clinical characteristics):  
 Proportion of women reporting a maximum pain score of 7 or higher.  
 Use of rescue medication; this mo del will also adjust for the number of ibuprofen and oxycodone or 
placebo doses taken.  
 Presence of nausea or vomiting  
 Satisfaction with pain medication  
 Need for additional (non -prescribed) pain medication  
 
To examine differences between groups in the amoun t of ibuprofen and oxycodone or placebo used during 
the 24 hours after administration of misoprostol, we will use Poisson, negative binomial, or zero -inflated 
Poisson or negative binomial regression models, depending on the distribution of the data.  
 
We wi ll use descriptive statistics to characterize the number and chief complaints of patient -initiated phone 
calls to the provider or clinic. We will use Student’s t -test or a Wilcoxon rank -sum test to test for differences 
between groups in the number of calls  placed. We will group chief complaints into broad categories and 
test for differences across treatment groups using a chi -squared test. Similarly, we will group non -
prescribed medications used for pain into broad categories and use descriptive statistics to characterize 
them.  
 
 Finally, we will use descriptive statistics to summarize adverse events.  
 
Previous studies suggest that the 11 -point numeric pain scale are as sensitive to changes in clinical pain as 
the visual analog scale.18 We will administer numeric pain scales via text message that will prompt 
participants to rate their pain on a scale of 0 -10. Significant difference in pain intensity for the numeric 
pain scale is a change in >2.[ADDRESS_729056] on data 
simulated from specified parameters (delta=2, sigma=2.6, alpha=0.05). It is difficult to simulate 
categorical data unless we assume a specific probability for each possible value of the NRS, which 
would be far too strong of a set of assumptions to make. For this reason, we treated the outcome 
as continuous and used a standard devi ation as a measure of spread for the purpose of simulating 
data, and then used the more conservative rank -based test to calculate the sample.  To calculate

 Page 13 of 17 Revised: 6.11.[ADDRESS_729057] deviations. We selected these continuous and 
symmetric measures of center and spread in the absence of the availability of any other 
distributional assumptions of NRS data. The simulated pools of data were constraine d to integer 
values ranging from 0 to 10. We repeatedly sampled from the simulated pools of data at sample 
sizes ranging from 10 to 100 per cell to calculate the probability of a significant (at alpha=0.05) 
Wilcoxon rank -sum test at each sample size. A sam ple size of 34 participants per group provided 
80% probability of detecting the 2 -point difference in the simulated data. Initially, we anticipated a 
10% drop -out or study non -adherence and planned to enroll  38 participants per block cell (a total 
of 152 p articipants).  After an interim analysis, 25% of participants are not using the study drug. 
While this is useful information for a secondary analysis, by [CONTACT_555327] 
15%, we can allow for 25% drop -out or study non -adherence in o rder to analyze our primary 
outcome. This would increase our overall enrollment goal to 172 (43 participants per group).  
 
9. Privacy, Confidentiality, and Data Security  
Data collection and storage:  Standard institutional practices will be followed as describ ed in the 
OHSU Information Security and Research Data Re source Guide 
(http://ozone.ohsu.edu/cc/sec/isg/res_sec.pdf) to maintain the confidentiality and security of 
data collected in this study. Study staff will be trained with regard to these procedures. Paper 
files will be stored in locked filing cabinets in restricted acc ess offices at PPCW and OHSU. 
Electronic data will be stored in the secure web -based data collection system, REDCap,  and 
TextIt  which is housed on an OHSU secure server. Access to data is restricted to study personnel .  
Data coding:  Upon enrollment, subjec ts will be assigned a code that will be used instead of their 
name, medical record number or other personally identifying information. Electronic files for 
data analysis will contain only the subject code. Codes will not contain any part of the 18 HIPAA

a. Risks to Subjects  
A foreseeable risk to participants participating in this research would be a breach of 
confidentiality. There are no anticipated inconveniences to study subjects related to 
participation in the research, as no additional procedures, tests or interventions w ill be 
performed apart from routine medical services provided to women seeking abor tion care at 
Planned Parenthood.  
 
Another  risk to taking part in this study is that the study drug or the dose a participant  receive 
may not be effective in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_555310]. This means subjects  may spend time in the 
study and experience side effects taking a drug that may not provide subjects  with any health -
related benefits. If a subject is  not in the study, their  treatment for pain during medical abortion

PROJECT TITLE:    
Changes in 18F-fluciclovine Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in Patients with 
Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer Treated with Life-Prolonging Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] : A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_55217] :  
Prostate cancer is the most common non -cutaneous cancer in men and the second leading 
cause of cancer -related death in the United Sates , with 164,[ADDRESS_59577] in part, due to the change in the recommendations for prostate -specific 
antigen (PSA)  screening  by [CONTACT_941] U.S. Preventive Task Force2, the number of patients diagnosed with 
metastatic prostate cancer has increased over 2.7% per year after 2012.[ADDRESS_59578] cancer, prostate cancer is a hormonally driven  disease and androgens are 
key in the growth of both normal prostate and prostate cancer cells. While androgen deprivation 
therapy (ADT) has become the cornerstone of medical treatment for metastatic disease after the 
studies from Charles Huggins and Clare nce Hodges in 1941, ultimately all patients eventually 
progress in the setting of castrate levels of serum testosterone (< 50 ng/dL) and thus develop 
metastatic castration -resistant prostate c ancer (mCRPC).4,[ADDRESS_59579] patients 
receive a second -generation hormonal therapy to further suppress the synthesis of androgens 
(abiraterone) and to block androgen receptor (AR ) activation, nuclear translocation and DNA 
binding (enzalutamide).6,7 Abiraterone acetate  (abiraterone)  and enzalutamide were  approved in this 
setting based on the results of two large phase III trial in patients with mCRPC who had not 
received previous chemotherapy.8,[ADDRESS_59580] to assess these 
patients relatively early in their treatment course.8,10 
In addition to novel hormonal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], life-prolonging therapi[INVESTIGATOR_55218] 11,12 and cabazitaxel13, the alpha -emitter radium -[ZIP_CODE] and the 
autologous active cellular immunotherapy sipuleucel -T15 based on the  pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] 3 trials that 
demonstrated an overall survival advantage in CRPC  setting . More recently, the poly ADP -ribose 
polymerase (PARP)  inhibitor olaparib has also demonstrated a survival advantage over the 
physic ian’s choice of enzalutamide or abiraterone among men with mCRPC who had qualifying

alterations in homologous recombination repair genes and whose disease has progressed during 
previou s treatment with a next generation hormonal agent.[ADDRESS_59581] shown cabazitaxel to be 
superior to next generation hormonal agent for mCRPC patients previously treated with docetaxel 
and next generation hormonal agent, the sequence of two novel hormonal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_55219].18 
While data with f unctional imaging  in the metastatic setting is lacking, c onventional imaging 
of prostate cancer has  known  limitations in staging, restaging after biochemical relapse , and response 
assessment. Functional imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) can target various aspects 
of tumor biology and is clearly superior in the detection of extra -prostatic disease. A number of PET 
tracers are available  and/or in development , including FDG, 18F-NaF, 11C-choline, 18F-choline, 68Ga-
PSMA, 18F-PSMA,  and 18F-fluciclovine (Axumin ).  
                   18F-fluciclovine is a synthetic amino acid transported across mammalian cell membranes by 
[CONTACT_55245].19,20 18F-fluciclovine  was 
approved by [CONTACT_55246] (PSA) following prior definitive treatment.[ADDRESS_59582].

The results of this study can potentially leverage further data supporting the use of 18F-
fluciclovine for response assessment in the metastatic setting. Furthermore, we are extremely 
interested in understanding disease heterogeneity and how PET scan s depi[INVESTIGATOR_55220].  
We hypothesize that using 18F-fluciclovine  PET scanning will allow a more sensitive 
assessment of mCRPC patients at the initiation of  systemic therapy and changes observed in 18F-
fluciclovine  PET will correlate better with the serologic changes in PSA, allowing superior  disease 
monitoring , as compared to conventional imaging modalities . In addition, we hypothesize that 18F-
fluciclovine  PET will detect heterogeneity in disease response and thus identify potential lesions 
amenable to targeted therapy . We hypothesize that the PET scan will detect more disease than 
conventional scanning and thus provide more sensitive, and earlier information about tumor 
response to life prolonging -therapi[INVESTIGATOR_55221] c onventional scanning. Exploratory objectives are to 
understand disease heterogeneity and possible heterogen eous progression and change in patient 
management as well as to c ompar e the  18F-fluciclovine PET findings with genomic alterations 
found in ctDNA  especially in the AR gene,  using a n NGS  assay of patients  with mCRPC treated 
with life prolonging -therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] .  
 
STUDY DESIGN: This is  a pi[INVESTIGATOR_32731] [ADDRESS_59583] 
a baseline 18F-fluciclovine PET scan , then treated with a life -prolonging therapy ( ie, abiraterone  
acetate, enzalutamide, docetaxel)  for mCRPC . After [ADDRESS_59584] a second 18F-
fluciclovine PET scan and then move to the follow -up phase of the study for 2 years.  
 
TREATMENT PLAN:   
We will include adult patients with mCRPC, with a detectable baseline PSA of at least 2 
ng/mL. Evidence of metastatic disease is required but measurable disease (RECIST version 1.1) is 
not a prerequisite on conventional staging scans (CT and bone scans) done within 42 days of 
starting a life -prolonging therapy . The use  of docetaxel in the hormone -sensitive setting is allowed.  
After informed consent , patients will get a screening  18F-fluciclovine PET scan before 
starting a life -prolonging therapy for CRPC and only patients with a positive PET scan  (study 
procedure)  will be included in the study.  Patients will repeat both 18F-fluciclovine PET scan and 
conventional CT and bone scans 12 weeks after starting abiraterone therapy  or earlier  if disease 
progression (by [CONTACT_55247]) is noted , per physician’s discretion . All 18F-

fluciclovine PET/CT scans will be interpreted by a single trained reader and with the same camera 
at Tulane University.  
When feasible, a  next generation sequencing  (NGS ) testing of ctDNA (Guardant360  assay ) 
and a germline testing (Invitae assay)  will be conducted  at baseline ; a repeated NGS testing of 
ctDNA will also be repeated at 12 weeks  following initiation of the therapy of choice.   
Patients will be treated with any of the approved life -prolonging therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]: abiraterone 1000 
mg daily plus prednisone 5 mg (or dexamethasone 0.5 mg) daily , enzalutamide 160 mg daily, or 
docetaxel 50 mg/m2 every two weeks or 75 mg/m2 every three weeks . All patient s will remain on 
luteinizing hormone -releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy, except those who have been 
surgically castrated. At week [ADDRESS_59585] labora tory measures includin g but not limited to complete 
blood count, complete metabolic panel , prostate specific antigen ( PSA) and testosterone . The 
clinical evaluation  will be at the discretion of the treating physician  with clinical visits, imaging and 
laboratory tests based on routine clinical practice.  Objective response for patients with measurable 
disease will be defined using RECIST version 1.1. PSA progression will be defined as  a repeated  
increase in PSA of at least 2 ng/dL and 25% from nadir values , at least [ADDRESS_59586] version 1.1.25 PSA response 
will be  defined as  a ≥50% decline from baseline.  
 Patients may remain on  their assigned  therapy  in the setting of PSA progression, if the treating 
physician believes the patient is still gaining clinical  benefit. Patients with a treatment delay of 
longer than 4 weeks due to toxicity will be discontinued from treatment. The duration of therapy 
and dose adjustments is allowed at the discretion of the treating physician  to ensure patient´s safety.  
 
OBJECTIVES:  The primary objective of the study is to describe the 18F-fluciclovine PET findings 
for patients with mCRPC prior to starting treatment with first line  life-prolonging therapy (i .e., 
abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, docetaxel -based regimen) , and at [ADDRESS_59587]-line mCRPC treatment, and at 12 
weeks later; and to correlate these changes with PSA respon se and progression . 
Exploratory objectives are to understand disease heterogeneity and possible heterogen eous 
progression and change in patient management as well as to compar e the  18F-fluciclovine PET

[ADDRESS_59596] about 60% greater incidence of being diagnosed with prostate cancer and 
nearly two -fold greater chance of dying from the disease than Caucasian  men, yet the underlying 
cause for this increased mortality remains controversial.26,[ADDRESS_59597] patients receive a second -generation hormonal therapy 
to further suppress the synthesis of androgens (abiraterone) and to block AR activation, nuclear 
translocation and DNA binding (enzalutamide), based on pi[INVESTIGATOR_55224].6,[ADDRESS_59598] patients respond to abiraterone or enzalutamide initially, but

and next generation hormonal agent, the sequence of two novel hormonal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_55219].[ADDRESS_59600] time in 1995, Hellman and Weichselbaum  introduced the concept of oligo - 
(Greek “oligo”: few) metastatic state as an intermediate state in the malignancy spectrum between 
localized disease and prior to disseminated disease.[ADDRESS_59601] of all advances in imaging techniques.34  
Conventional imaging of prostate cancer has  known  limitations in staging, restaging after 
biochemical relapse , and response assessment. Functional imaging with  PET scans  (study 
procedure)  can target various aspects of tumor biology and is clearly superior in the detection of 
extra -prostatic disease. A radionuclide produced from either a cyclotron or a generator is attached to 
a biologically active molecule to form a PET radiotracer . A number of PET tracers have been 
developed specifically for prostate cancer in the last few years and are now available  or under 
investigation  (18F-NaF, 11C-choline, 18F-choline, 68Ga-PSMA , 18F-PSMA  and 18F-fluciclovine ). 
PSMA agents labeled with 68Ga, 18F and 18F-fluciclovine  are being increasingly used in this 
field. 18F-fluciclovine is a synthetic amino acid transported across mammalian cell membranes by 
[CONTACT_55245].19,20 18F-Fluciclovine  was recently 
approved by [CONTACT_55249] (PSA) following prior definitive treatment.21 This approval was 
based on two prospective studies comparing 18F-fluciclovine  (Axumin) with histopathology 
results22,23 and with 11C-choline  PET in patients with biochemical recurrent prostate cancer.24 These 
studies compared the efficacy and safety of 18F-fluciclovine  with 11C-choline  PET/CT and biopsy 
results, revealing a very good performance in terms of lesion detection rate for low, intermediate and 
high PSA levels, with higher sensitivity than 11C-choline  PET.  
While the benefit of 18F-fluciclovine  PET is established, the role of this imaging to monitor 
response to mCRPC therapi[INVESTIGATOR_55227]. We hypothesize that using 18F-fluciclovine  PET 
scanning will allow a more sensitive staging of mCRPC patients at time of starting systemic therapy 
and changes observed in 18F-fluciclovine  PET will correlate better with the serologic changes in 
PSA, allowing better disease monitoring . In addition, we hypothesize that 18F-fluciclovine  PET will 
 
Axumin  protocol  
Protocol Version 4 January 5, 2021  
 
 
15 | P a g e  Investigator Initiated Trial   
 
detect  heterogeneity in disease response and thus identify potential lesions for SBRT. We 
hypothesize that the PET scan (study procedure)  will detect more disease than conventional 
scanning and thus give more sensitive, and earlier, information about tumor response than 
conventional scanning. Lastly, w e hypothesize that the functional changes observed in 18F-
fluciclovine PET scans will correlate with genomic alterations found in ctDNA , especially in the 
AR gene, using a commercially available NGS assay (Gua rdant) of mCRPC patients.

3 Objectives of the Trial 
3.1 Primary objective  
• To describe the 18F-fluciclovine PET findings for patients with mCRPC prior to starting 
treatment with first line  mCRPC  life-prolonging therapy  and at 12 weeks later,  with an 
emphasis on understanding the heterogeneity of lesions.  
 
3.2 Secondary Objectives  
• To compare  18F-fluciclovine PET with conventional CT and bone scans, as well as PSA 
changes  for patients with mCRPC prior to starting treatment for mCRPC , and at 12 weeks 
later;

18 | P a g e  Investigator Initiated Trial   
 
• Comparison of PET results with PSA changes.  
 
3.3 Exploratory  Objectives  
• Understand disease heterogeneity and possible heterogen eous progression and change in 
patient management  
• To compar e the  18F-fluciclovine PET findings with genomic alterations found in ctDNA  
especially in the AR gene,  using  a commercially available  NGS  assay (Guardant360) in 
patients  with mCRPC  treated with first -line therapy . 
 
[ADDRESS_59609] and bone scans  (standard of care) . 
Patients will be treated with  any of the approved life -prolonging therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]: abiraterone 1000 mg 
daily plus prednisone 5 mg (or dexamethasone 0.5 mg) daily , enzalutamide 160 mg daily, docetaxel 
50 mg/m2 every two weeks or 75 mg/m2 every three weeks . All patients will remain on luteinizing 
hormone -releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy, except those who have been surgically 
castrated. We will assess patients on day one of  each cycle for toxicity both clinically, and with 
standard laboratory measures including complete blood count, complet e metabolic panel  and 
prostate specific antigen (PSA). Patients will repeat both 18F-fluciclovine PET /CT scan and 
conventional CT and bone scans 12 weeks after starting  a life prolonging  therapy  or earlier if 
disease progression (by [CONTACT_55247]) is noted, per physician’s discretion . Objective 
response for patients with measurable disease will be defined using RECIST version 1.1. PSA 
progression will be defined as a repeated increase in PSA of at least 2 ng/dL and 25% from nadir 
values, at  least [ADDRESS_59610] version 1.1.35 
 Patients may remain on therapy  in the setting of PSA progression, if the treating physician 
believes the patient is still gaining  clinical benefit. Patients with a treatment delay of longer than 4

weeks due to toxicity will be discontinued from treatment . The duration of therapy and dose 
adjustments is allowed at the discretion of the treating physician .  
 
4.1.[ADDRESS_59611] PSA level  checked  on day 1 of  every cycle. Staging scans (CT 
and bone scans) as well as 18F-fluciclovine PET scan will be done at baseline and then 12 weeks 
after starting a life prolonging  therapy . Patients will remain on treatment until evidence of clinical 
or radiographic progression as determined by [CONTACT_079]  (PI), RECIST version 1.135 
(for measurable disease) or PCWG 3 criteria25 (if no measurable disease)  respectively . PSA 
progression will be defined as repeated  increase in PSA of at least 2 ng/dL and 25% from nadir 
values, according to PCWG 3 criteria25. Patients may remain on therapy in the setting of PSA 
progression without clinical and/or radiographic progression, per treating physician´s choice. 
Patients with a treatment delay of longer than 4 weeks due to toxicity will discontinue treatment and  
proceed to the 30-day safety follow -up visit.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose Adjustments  
 Therapy of choice will be started  on day [ADDRESS_59612] of ca re. Patients will be evaluated for safety and tolerability of the 18F-
fluciclovine PET . Patients will be evaluated for safety and tolerability  of their therapy per routine  
clinical practice.  
 Dose modifications are allowed according to the approved guidelines  for each therapy  (see 
package inserts) .   
Patients may temporarily suspend study treatment if they experience toxicity that is considered 
related to study drugs and requires a dose to be held.  Dose may be held for up to 4 weeks.  
Dose interruptions for reason(s) other than toxicity, such as surgical procedures, patient 
travel, etc. may be allowed with Principal Investigator´s  approval. The acceptable length of 
interruption will depend on agreement between the Investigator and the Principal Investigator . 
 
4.1.2  Criteria for Removal of Patients from Study  
A patient may be removed from the study for a number of reasons, including:

ng/dL and 25% above baseline , at least 1 week apart ;  
• Patients with PSA decreases >50% below pretreatment baseline while on abiraterone 
will be consider ed a PSA responder;  
• Patients with an increasing PSA  that then declines from peak levels but does not 
drop >50% below baseline will not be consider ed a PSA responder;  
• Patients with an increasing PSA that subsequently de clines from peak levels  to > 
50% below baseline will be consider ed a PSA responder;

metastatic  bone lesions ). At [ADDRESS_59622] of care. Regardless, 
subjects will still complete study and come back to clinic for 30 Day safety follow -up visit.  
 
6.3 Correlative Studies  
6.3.1  AR-genomic alterations studies  
As described in the background section, we aim to serially evaluate the genomic aberrations 
in AR that commonly occur with life-prolonging therapy  and establish a strategy for assessing 
clonal evolution and correlate with radiographic and functional (PET) changes.  
To fulfil this objective , we will use a commercially available targeted ctDNA assay . cfDNA 
NGS will be performed by [CONTACT_55253] (Guardant360; Redwood City, [LOCATION_004]), a Clinical 
Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) -licensed, College of American Pathologists -
accredited, [LOCATION_001] State Department of Health -approved clinical laboratory, using their s tandard 
collection protocol. This comprehensive genomic test performs complete exon sequencing of all 
critical exons (those with known hotspots) and reports all 4 major classes of GAs (single -nucleotide 
variants [SNVs] in 73 genes, indels in 23 genes, fusi ons in 6 genes, and copy number amplifications 
[CNAs] in 18 genes). As per Guardant360’s standard protocol, blood is collected in two [ADDRESS_59623] and bone scans. Therefore, no formal statistics are required, and 
this study is mainly descriptive.

Supplier  
Commercial supplies of abiraterone will be used and charged to the patient and/or his insurance 
company.  
 
Summary of Adverse Events Associated with Abiraterone  
The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) reported in the two randomized clinical trials that 
occurred more commonly (>2%) in the abiraterone arm were fatigue, joint swelling or discomfort, 
edema, hot flush, diarrhea, vomiting, cough, hypertension, dyspnea,  urinary tract infection and 
contusion. The most common laboratory abnormalities (>20%) reported in the two randomized 
clinical trials that occurred more commonly (≥2%) in the abiraterone arm were anemia, elevated 
alkaline phosphatase, hypertriglyceridemia , lymphopenia, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, 
elevated AST, hypophosphatemia, elevated ALT and hypokalemia.  
 
The following warnings are associated with the use of abiraterone (from the April 2017 prescribing 
information):  
• Hypertension, Hypokalemia and Fluid Retention Due to Mineralocorticoid Excess: Abiraterone 
may cause hypertension, hypokalemia, and fluid retention as a consequence of increased 
mineralocorticoid levels resulting from CYP17. In the two randomized clinica l trials, grade 3 to 4 
hypertension occurred in 2% of patients, grade 3 to 4 hypokalemia in 4% of patients, and grade 3 to 
4 edema in 1% of patients treated with abiraterone. Use caution when treating patients whose 
underlying medical conditions might be c ompromised by [CONTACT_55254], hypokalemia 
or fluid retention, e.g., those with heart failure, recent myocardial infarction or ventricular 
arrhythmia. Use abiraterone with caution in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease. The 
 
Axumin  protocol  
Protocol Version 4 January 5, 2021  
 
 
28 | P a g e  Investigator Initiated Trial   
 
safety of abiraterone in patients with LVEF < 50% or NYHA Class III to IV heart failure is not 
established.  
 
• Adrenocortical insufficiency: Adrenal insufficiency occurred in the two randomized clinical 
studies in 0.5% of patients taking abiraterone and in 0.2% of patients taking placebo. 
Adrenocortical insufficiency was reported in patients receiving abiraterone  in combination with 
prednisone, following interruption of daily steroids and/or with concurrent infection or stress. Use 
caution and monitor for symptoms and signs of adrenocortical insufficiency, particularly if patients 
are withdrawn from prednisone, ha ve prednisone dose reductions, or experience unusual stress. 
Symptoms and signs of adrenocortical insufficiency may be masked by [CONTACT_55255].  
 
• Hepatotoxicity: In post -marketing experience, there has been abiraterone -associated severe hepatic 
toxicity, including fulminant hepatitis, acute liver failure and deaths. In the two randomized clinical 
trials, grade [ADDRESS_59625] increases (at least 5X ULN) were reported in 4% of patients who 
received abir aterone, typi[INVESTIGATOR_55230] [ADDRESS_59626] elevation than those 
beginning with normal values. Treatment discontinuation due to liver enzyme increases occurred in 
1% of patients taking abiraterone. No deaths clearly related to abiraterone were reported due to 
hepatotoxicity events. The safety of abiraterone re -treatment of patients wh o develop AST or ALT 
greater than or equal to 20X ULN and/or bilirubin greater than or equal to 10X ULN is unknown.  
 
Prednisone and dexamethasone  
Prednisone and dexamethasone are synthetic adrenoglucocorticoids. They are commercially 
available as generics in tablet form for oral administration. They are indicated for a variety of 
medical conditions, including cancer.  
 
Summary of Adverse Events Associated with Prednisone /dexamethasone   
See reference for a more complete summary of AEs associated with glucocorticoids.[ADDRESS_59627] 
virtually all body systems. Common side effects include thinning of the skin, purpura, Cushingoid 
appearance, weight gain, sleep disturbance and mood cha nges. Hyperglycemia is common if these 
agents are used in patients with pre -existing diabetes or those at risk of diabetes for other reasons.

Cataracts are also common with prolonged (>1 year) of glucocorticoids. Other risks of concern with 
glucocorticoids include an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and hypertension (particularly 
when glucocorticoids are prescribed in patients with pre -existing cardiac or renal disease), increased 
risk of peptic ulcer disease and gastritis (especially when patients are also taking nonsteroidal anti -
inflammatory agents), osteoporosis, increased fracture risk, osteonecrosis, myopathy, edema, and 
immunosuppr ession with an increased risk of infection. With the exception of cataracts and some of 
the cardiac and bone toxicities, adverse effects from glucocorticoids are at least partially reversible 
upon discontinuation.[ADDRESS_59628] information (s ee

Summary of Adverse Events Associated with Enzalutamide  
The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) reported in the two randomized placebo -controlled 
clinical trials that occurred more commonly (>2% over placebo) in the enzalutamide arm were 
asthenia/fatigue, back pain, decreased appetite, constipation, arthralgia , diarrhea, hot flush, upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], peripheral edema, dyspnea, musculoskeletal pain, weigh decreased, 
headache, hypertension, and dizziness/vertigo. The following warnings are associated with the use 
of enzalutamide (from the October 2016 prescribing information):  
• Seizure: Seizure occurred in 0.5% of patients receiving enzalutamide in clinical studies. Seizure 
occurred from 31 to 603 days after initiation of enzalutamide. Patients experiencing seizure were 
permanently discontinued from therapy and all seizure even ts resolved. There is no clinical trial 
experience re -administering enzalutamide to patients who experienced seizure. Limited safety data

are available in patients with predisposing factors for seizure because these patients were generally 
excluded from the trials. Because of the risk of seizure associated with enzalutamide use, patients 
should be advised of the risk of engaging in any activ ity where sudden loss of consciousness could 
cause serious harm to themselves or others.  
• Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES): There have been reports of PRES in 
patients receiving enzalutamide. PRES is a neurological disorder which can present with rapi[INVESTIGATOR_55231], headache, lethargy, confusion, bl indness, and other visual 
and neurological disturbances, with or without associated hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES 
requires confirmation by [CONTACT_14548], preferably MRI.

9 18F-Fluciclovine PET /CT Scan   
9.1 Administration  
The recommended dose is 370 MBq (10 mCi) administered as an intravenous bolus 
injection. The (radiation absorbed) effective dose resulting from this dose of 18F-fluciclovine  is [ADDRESS_59630] patients received a single administration of 18F-
fluciclovine , a small number of subjects (n = 50) received up to five administrations of the drug. 
The mean administered activity was 370 MBq  (range, 163 to 485 MBq).

41. In general, the results of these studies are consistent. The primary evidence on the biodistribution 
and radiation dosimetry from the phase I study conducted by [CONTACT_55256]41,42 is reviewed in more 
detail below. This trial (GE -148-001) in [ADDRESS_59632] part of the trial investigated the saf ety, biodistribution, and internal radiation dosimetry of 18F-
 
Axumin  protocol  
Protocol Version 4 January 5, 2021  
 
 
32 | P a g e  Investigator Initiated Trial   
 
fluciclovine injection in 6 healthy volunteers (3 males and 3 females). Overall, there was no 
evidence indicating that 18F-fluciclovine  is metabolized in vivo .  
Qualitative assessment of the distribution of 18F-fluciclovine  activity in all [ADDRESS_59633] imaging time point, on average 7.9 mins (6.5 to 10.2 mins) post 
injection. Initial uptake of 18F-fluciclovine  activity in the liver, pancreas, and the red bone marrow 
of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae and skull was immediately evident in all subjects. There was 
very little brain uptake, 1.6% (0.7% to 2.2%). With increasing time post injection, distributed 
uptak e was apparent and, on the basis of the anatomical distribution, was mostly associated with 
skeletal muscle. This uptake could not be isolated for quantification as it was not possible to 
segment the muscle in the whole -body image. Hence, muscle was includ ed in the “remaining 
tissues” category. Uptake in the spleen was apparent in some subjects. Uptake in the uterus was 
apparent in some female subjects and initial activity uptake in the uterus was limited, 1.2% (0.3% 
to1.7%). It was assumed, based on the ge neral skeletal muscle uptake, to be associated with the 
muscle of the uterine wall. The four organs with the highest initial uptake of 18F-fluciclovine  were 
the liver at 13.8% (8.3% to 17.1%), red bone marrow at 11.1% (4.8% to 20.4%), lung at 7.1% 
(5.2% to  8.6%), and pancreas at 4.2% (3.4% to 5.2%). Based on comparison with washout of 
activity from the whole -blood samples, washout of activity from the lung was consistent with 
washout of activity from the pulmonary blood content. Excretion of 18F-fluciclovine  activity was 
limited and was only found for the renal pathway, reaching 3.2% (1.1% to 7.4%) at the last imaging 
time point an average of 4.[ADDRESS_59634] injection (3.8 to 4.7 hours). The small amount of activity 
entering the gastrointestinal (GI) tract co uld not be clearly identified due to the surrounding activity 
in muscle and mesentery. On the basis of activity washout from the liver and the pancreas, and 
assuming that all of this activity was to enter the duodenum through hepatobiliary and pancreatic 
transport, the activity excreted via the GI tract was estimated to be of the order of 10 % or less.  
Although this could not be accurately quantified, any activity present in the contents of the 
GI tract was grouped within the “remaining tissues” category for evaluation of internal radiation

9.3 Safety  
According to clinical review of 18F-fluciclovine by [CONTACT_55257] (Reference ID: 3897370) that 
supported the approval of 18F-fluciclovine for patient with recurrent prostate cancer, no deaths were 
reported in any of the studies evaluated in this review. Two serious adverse events were reported for 
the BED001 study; one subject was from the Norway site and one was from the Bologna site. Table 
1 summarizes the treatment emergent adverse events and adverse reactions in healthy volunteers 
(N=12) . Moreover, a dverse  reactions were reported in ≤1% of subjects during clinical studies with 
18F-fluciclovine . The most common adverse reactions were injection site pain, injection site 
erythema and dysgeusia.

[ADDRESS_59639] of the protocol. During these 
meetings the investigators will discuss the safety of protocol participants, validity and integrity of 
the data, enrollment rate relative to expectation, characteristics of participants, retention of 
participants, adherence to protocol (potential or real protocol violations), data completeness, and  
progress of data for secondary objectives.  Criteria for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_55235], significant, or unacceptable risk to patients;  or insufficient 
compliance to protocol requirements . 
Monitoring plan has been established in a separate document, which will be filed in the 
electronic study file.  
 
11.1 Case Report Form Submissi on 
Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) will be provided by [INVESTIGATOR_678] (PI) and 
should be handled in accordance with instructions from PI. The investigator is responsible for 
maintaining adequate and accurate eCRFs which have been designed to reco rd all observations and 
other data pertinent to the clinical investigation. Each eCRF should be filled out completely by [CONTACT_55258]. All data captured for the study is 
planned to be electronic.  
11.2 Adverse Event Monitoring and Reporting  
 An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence or experience in a 
patient or clinical investigation subject which occurs following the administration of the trial 
medication regardless of the dose or causal relationship. As patients will be treated with standard of 
care while the intervention is the 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT  at two time  points , AEs occurring until 
two days after the imaging test and related with 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT will be reported. This can 
include any unfavorable a nd unintended signs (such as rash or enlarged liver), or symptoms (such as 
 
Axumin  protocol  
Protocol Version 4 January 5, 2021  
 
 
36 | P a g e  Investigator Initiated Trial   
 
nausea or chest pain), an abnormal laboratory finding (including blood tests, x -rays or scans) or a 
disease temporarily associated with the use of the protocol treatment . Laboratory  abnormalities will 
only be reported as AEs when deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_779]’s investigator.  
 An Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) is defined as any response to a medical product, that is 
noxious and/or unexpected, related to any dose. Response to a medicinal product (used in the above 
definition) means that a causal relationship between the medicinal product and the adverse event is 
at least a reasonable possibility, i.e. the relationship cannot be ruled  out. 
 An Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction is any adverse reaction for which the nature or 
severity is not consistent with the applicable product information (e.g., Investigators’ Brochure).  
 A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is defined as any undesirable experience occurring to a 
patient, whether or not considered related to the protocol treatment. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
which is considered related to the protocol treatment is defined as a Serious Adverse Drug Reaction 
(SADR).  
 Adverse events and adverse drug reactions which are considered as serious are those which 
result in:  death ; a life-threatening  event (i.e. the patient was at immediate risk of death at the time 
the reaction was observed) ; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318] ; persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity ; a congenital anomaly/birth defect ; any other medically important 
condition (i.e. important adverse reactions that are not immediately life threatening or do not result 
in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_55236] ). 
11.2.[ADDRESS_59640]/NCI Common Terminology Criteria, CTCAE version 5.0. All appropriate treatment areas 
should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 5.0. Study staff must use one of the CTCAE 
criteria to define the event. Adverse even ts not included in the CTCAE v.5 .0 should be reported and 
graded under the “Other” adverse event within the appropriate category and grade 1 to 5 according 
to the general grade definitions, mild, moderate, severe, life -threateni ng, fatal or disabling, as 
provided in the CTCAE.  
The event will be determined to be expected or unexpected. The determination of whether an AE is 
expected is based on agent -specific adverse event information provided in Section 8 Pharmaceutical 
 
Axumin  protocol  
Protocol Version 4 January 5, 2021  
 
 
37 | P a g e  Investigator Initiated Trial   
 
Information. Unexpected AEs are those not listed in the agent -specific adverse event information 
provided in Section 9 Pharmaceutical Information.  
The event will be evaluated for relationship to the medical treatment or procedure. The  
Investigator should document his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_55237] 
(18F-fluciclovine ) as follows:  
• Unrelated - The adverse event is clearly not related to the investigational agent(s).  
• Possible -The adverse event may be related to the investigational agent(s).  
• Probable -The adverse event is most likely related to the investigational agent(s).  
• Definite - The adverse event is clearly related to the investigational agent(s).  
 
 Based on this information, a decision will be made whether an adverse event should be 
reported as an expedited report in addition to the routinely reported clinical data. All expedited 
adverse event reports should be submitted to the Institutional Review B oard (IRB) and to the FDA.  
11.2.2  Documenting Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (as defined in Section 10.2 
and as further specified below) observed by [CONTACT_55259]’ medical records  and in the CRF. These adverse events will include the 
following:  
• All serious and non -serious adverse events (as defined in Section 1 0.2) that occur after the 
subject has signed the informed consent form and for 2 days after each 18F-fluciclovine  
PET/CT scan will be documented.    
The following serious adverse event attributes must be assigned by [CONTACT_093]: adverse 
event diagnosis or syndrome(s) (if known, signs or symptoms if not known); event description (with 
detail appropriate to the event); dates of onset and resolution; severity; assessment of relatedness to 
18F-fluciclovine  PET scan ; and action taken. The investigator may be asked to provide follow -up 
information, discharge summaries, and extracts from medical records.  
For all adverse events, sufficient information should be obtained by [CONTACT_47515] (e.g. 18F-fluciclovine  PET scan or other cause ). The 
relationship of the adverse event to the imaging study  will be assessed as described at 10.2.1.

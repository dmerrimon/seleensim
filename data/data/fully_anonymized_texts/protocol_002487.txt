Version 1.0      Page 2 of 61 Sec�on  1. Introduc�on 
Moun�ng evidence indicates that it is the reduc�on in brain A β clearance, rather than its overproduc�on 
which is likely to be the underlying mechanism for late- onset AD (>99% cases in the general 
popula�on).1, 2 Furthermore, brain A β and tau accumula�on accelerates age -related cogni�ve decline , 
even in cogni�vely normal older adults.3-6 The recognized brain A β clearance pathways include: 1) 
astrocyte phagocytosis and enzyma�c degrada�on of aggregated A β;7 2) transporta�on of soluble A β 
from the inters��al ﬂuid ( ISF) to CSF with subsequent reabsorp�on into venous blood and/or the 
cervical lympha�c system; 8-11 and 3) direct transporta�on of A β across the blood brain barrier ( BBB) into 
the venous blood.2  At present, the rela�ve contribu�ons of these pathways in brain A β and tau 
clearance remain unknown. A recent study in young and middle aged subjects suggests that direct 
transport of A β across the BBB accounts for ~ 25%, and the CSF reabsorp�on pathw ay accounts for 
another ~ 25% of brain A β clearance.2 
Importantly, the presence of intracranial pulsa�lity has been recognized as the driving force for brain A β 
and tau clearance through these pathways, and altera�ons in intracranial pulsa�lity have been linked to 
the changes in brain A β and tau .8, 12 However, whether this mechanism func�ons similarly in humans 
remains unknown. In this project, we will determine whether changes in intracranial pulsa�lity alter 
brain A β and tau homeostasis in older adults with hypertension.   
Hypertension exacerbates brain atrophy and WMH in older adults.13-[ADDRESS_274197] brain changes in hypertension at an early stage.16-18 For example, 
disrup�ons in brain white mater microstructural integrity and neural network func�onal connec�vity were observed prior to the appearance of WMH.
16, 18 Furthermore, a “dose -response” rela�onship 
between elevated SBP and reduc�ons in brain white mater integrity has been observed.[ADDRESS_274198] of these ﬁndings are from cross -sec�onal studies, and it remains to be determined whether 
intensive BP treatments improve brain white mater integrity and neural network func�onal connec�vity.  
In this project, we will determine the eﬀects of intensive an�hypertensive treatment on brain white mater integrity and neural network func�onal connec�vity, with a focus on the default -mode neural 
network ( DMN ) and the frontoparietal network ( FPN), as  these neural networks are sensi�ve to brain 
vascular damage, A β and tau deposi�on even before morphological changes such as brain atrophy and 
WMH.

adults.23, [ADDRESS_274201] also will determine whether intensive reduc�on of 24 -hour   SBP has more 
beneﬁts on improving neurocogni�ve func�on and reducing WMH in older adults ( ≥75 yrs.) when 
compared to the standard care.[ADDRESS_274202]. However, the aims and 
outcome measures as well as the study popula�on in these studies are diﬀerent from this project.  
 
Sec�on  2. Objec�ves  
The overarching goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that intensive an�hypertensive treatment 
alters intracranial pulsa�lity , which in turn aﬀects brain A β and tau protein homeostasis. Furthermore, 
we will determine whether changes in intracranial pulsa�lity, A β and tau are associated with brain white 
mater integrity and neural network func�onal connec�vity. To achieve this  goal, w e will enroll [ADDRESS_274203] normal BP (24 - hour  BP< 125/75  mmHg) and [ADDRESS_274204] hi gh SBP (24 - 
hour  SBP ≥125 mmHg ).26 Ambulatory 24 - hour  BP is used because it is a stronger predictor of 
cerebrovascular disease and cogni�ve decline in older adults than oﬃce BP .25, 27 Pa�ents with 
hypertension will be randomized into a 12 -month intensive treatment arm (24 - hour  SBP≤12 0 ) and a 
control arm of the standard care (24 -H SBP≤  130) (1:1) to accomplish the following aims:  
Aim 1 : Determine the eﬀects of hypertension on intracranial pulsa�lity, CSF A β and tau concentra�on, 
brain white mater integrity and neural network func�onal connec�vity . Hypotheses: Hypertension is 
associated with: 1) augmented central pulsa�lity, but reduced intracranial pulsa�lity measured with CINE 
phase -contrast MRI ( PC-MRI ); 2) reduc�ons in CSF soluble A β42, but increases in phosphorylated tau and 
total tau; 3) disrup�ons in brain white mater integrity inferred by [INVESTIGATOR_121732]ﬀusion tensor imaging ( DTI), and 
func�onal connec�vity by [INVESTIGATOR_6054]�ng- state fMRI ( rs-fMRI ), with a focus on the default -mode neural network 
(DMN ) and the frontoparietal network ( FPN).18, 20 We will determine whether group diﬀerences in 
intracranial pulsa�lity, brain A β and tau are associated with white mater integrity and func�onal 
connec�vity.  
Aim 2 : Determine the eﬀects of intensive BP reduc�on on intracranial pulsa�lity, CSF A β and tau 
concentra�on, brain white mater integrity and neural network func�onal connec�vity . Hypotheses: 
compared to standard care, intensive treatment confers more beneﬁts by:  1) reduc�ons in central 
pulsa�lity, but increases in intracranial pulsa�lity; 2) increases in CSF A β42, but reduc�ons in

hypertension will be compared to accomplish Aim 1 to determine the eﬀects of hypertension on intracranial pulsa�lity, brain A β and tau, white mater integrity and func�onal connec�vity. A�er baseline 
measurements, pa�ents with hypertension will be randomized into a 12 -month inten sive treatment arm 
(24- hour SBP≤120 ) and a control arm of the standard care (24 - hour SBP≤13 0) to accomplish Aim 2 to 
determine the eﬀects of intensive BP reduc�on on intracranial pulsa�lity, brain A β and tau, white mater 
integrity and func�onal connec�vity. Aim [ADDRESS_274207]

3.2 Recruitment   
Recruitment of healthy subjects will be conducted mainly by [CONTACT_227651]�sement in local newspapers and 
from health fairs and senior centers. We have used these methods successfully to recruit older adults in our previous studies. Recruitment for pa�ent with hypertension will be conducted mainly through the UTSW Medical Center aﬃliated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_227596]. [CONTACT_227691] is the director of 
hypertension sec�on at the UTSW Medical Center. She has regular contact [CONTACT_227652] o will facilitate pa�ent recruitment. Addi�onal recruitment will be conducted via the [LOCATION_007] 
Health Resource (THR) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48196], which is the largest health care system in the North [LOCATION_007] and includes [ADDRESS_274208]. Zhang’s Cerebrovascular Laboratory is 
located at the Ins�tute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine(IEEM), which is aﬃliated with THR. [CONTACT_211240] has established close collabora�ons with THR clinicians to conduct clinical studies in hypertension and other chronic diseases in old adults. The experience learned and methods used for pa�ent 
recruitment will be used in this project. Addi�onally we will use the Research Registry Database within UTSW Medical Center, social media adver�sements, and Craigslist pos�ngs.   
Adherence and reten�on:   BP treatment eﬀects are monitored during each study visit, and via regular 
telephone contact.  Par�cipants will be asked to return all study medicines and botles (used and 
unused) at each visit to monitor compliance. Every eﬀort will be made to provid e a friendly clinic 
environment and to minimize the study burden. Clearly writen instruc�ons for each of follow -up visits 
will be provided and kindly reminded and conﬁrmed with e -mails or phone calls. Time constraints and 
develo pment of medical condi�ons are likely to occur in older adults. Study inves�gators and staﬀ 
members will work closely with par�cipants to iden�fy and resolve problems if they would occur to 
enhance adherence. Our previous year -long longitudinal studie s in olde r adults  had a 10 -15% of dropout 
rates. We an�cipate that we will be able to maintain a similarly dropout rate in this project.

3.3.2 Informed Consent and Screening  Visits  
Overview of study events  -  Phone screening: Ini�al phone screen will assess the key inclusion and 
exclusion criteria and willingness and suitability for this study.  In-person screening  will include informed 
consent, a physical exam including 12 lead ECG, a comprehensive review of medical history and 
medica�on, and further evalua�on of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Baseline evalua�on  consists of 2 or 
3 visits  within ~ 6 weeks to complete all measures ( Table 1 , procedures will be combined as much as 
possible to reduce visit burden). Control subjects will complete only baseline evalua�on. A�er baseline, 
pa�ents with hypertension will be randomized to the interven�on arms. Follow -up evalua�ons  will be 
perfor med at 6 and 12 months to track  changes in intracranial pulsa�lity, brain perfusion, structure and 
func�on ( Table 1 ). All visits at each follow -up will be completed within a �me window of ± 3 weeks. 
Scheduled in -person and phone checks : Research personnel  will meet with the study par�cipants and/or 
conduct phone assessments to review  medica�on bi -weekly during the ﬁrst 1 -3 months a�er 
randomiza�on and monthly a�erwards during the whole study period to monitor safety and to enhance compliance. Similar contacts will be made in the standard care and intensive treatment arms.

Version 1.0      Page 12 of 61 3.4.1 Blinded Research Personnel  
Study personnel performing outcome assessments will be blinded to group assignment . The sta�s�cian 
performing primary data analysis will also be blinded. Interven�on staﬀ,  site safety oﬃcers, and 
individuals  not involved in outcome measures will be considered unblinded in order to address safety 
concerns or adverse events.   
In case of an emergency, [CONTACT_227691]  will determine  if unbinding of a subject’s treatment 
assignment is warranted. Subject safety must always be the ﬁrst considera�on in making such a decision . 
If an inves�gator or site staﬀ performing assessments is unblinded , the subject may remain in the study 
a�er obtaining approval from the site PI [INVESTIGATOR_227599](s) for making such a decision will be 
documented . 
3.4.2 Randomiza�on and Study Arms   
Hypertensive subjects will be randomized into one of 2  study arms ( The standard care arm  and intensive 
treatment arm ). BP target for the standard care group is chosen to be 24 -hr SBP≤130 mmHg, equivalent 
to a clinic SBP≤140 mmHg.  The 24h SBP target for intensive arm is 24 -hr SBP≤120 mmHg, equivalent to a 
clinic SBP≤[ADDRESS_274214]’s randomiza�on s cheme  and obtain 
the study arm assignment during the o rienta�on visit. During this visit, the c oordinator  or designate, will 
provide the par�cipant with a summary of informa�on regarding their group assignment and will 
schedule the ﬁrst visit with the interven�on staﬀ based  on the par�cipant’s assigned group. The 
Orienta�on Visit will be considered Day [ADDRESS_274215].

BP group  in order to minimize poten�al drug eﬀects on the study outcome. the BP target for the 
standard care group is chosen to be 24 -H SBP≤130 mmHg, equivalent to a clinic SBP≤140 mmHg  (Figure 
1).
25, 26 Par�cipants in this group may or may not be on treatment with one or more an�hypertensive 
medica�ons at the ini�al visit. Par�cipants on diﬀerent an�hypertensive drugs  are eligible  during 
enrollment. They  will be switched to the medica�ons used in this project a�er baseline measurement.

Version 1.0      Page 13 of 61 All clinical visits will be the same for the two groups. We will �trate an�hypertensive drugs according to  
the protocol to achieve 24 -Hr SBP to ≤130 mmHg (Figure 1). At each visit, par�cipants will be asked 
about changes in medica�ons.  The study clinician may add, increase or reduce the dose, stop, or change 
an�hypertensive drugs to reach the goal of lowering 24 -Hr  SBP to < 130 mmHg  or clinic SBP <[ADDRESS_274217] discomfort during �tra�on of an�hypertensive medica�ons, 24 -Hr  
ambulatory BP (ABP) will not be obtained during all clinic visits but will be used to verify if the SBP 
reaches goal when clinic SBP is < 14 0 mmHg, unless par�cipants  are suspected to have signiﬁcantly 
lower out -of-oﬃce BP than clinic BP .  
 
4.2 Intensive Treatment  
We will �trate an�hypertensive drugs according to  the protocol to achieve  24-H SBP to < 120 mmHg , 
which i s equivalent to a clinic SBP<130  mmHg  (Figure 1). Calcium channel blocker (CCB , amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] ) and 
angiotensin II receptor blocker  (ARB, losartan)  will be used as the ﬁrst line an�hypertensive  to treat 
hypertension; low dose chlorthalidone diure�c, potassium -sparing diure�c spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407], or doxazosin 
will be added if needed to reach the BP goal.  
The study clinician may add, increase or reduce the dose, stop, or change an�hypertensive drugs to

4.2.2.  [ADDRESS_274221] Randomiza�on  
Obtain random blood draw for basic metabolic panel and seated/standing BP measurement.  
Blood Pressure Management  
 
1) If clinic SBP is s�ll above target (≥[ADDRESS_274222] arm and ≥130 mmHg for intensive 
arm) , double the dose of amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_227602] 10 mg daily (e.g., if pa�ent is 
taking 2.5 mg daily, increase to 5 mg; if pa�ent is taking 5 mg daily, increase to 10 mg). 
2) If subject is taking maximal dose of amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (10 mg) and repeated serum K is < 5.0 and 
serum crea�nine (Cr) increases by < 25% from baseline (screening) lab results, double the 
dose of losartan up to maximal dose of 100 mg daily,(e.g., if pa�ent is  taking 25 mg daily, 
increase to 50 mg; if pa�ent is taking 50 mg daily, increase to 100 mg).  
3) If clinic SBP is s�ll above target (≥[ADDRESS_274223] arm and (≥130 mmHg for intensive 
arm) and pa�ent is already taking maximal dose of amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (10 mg) plus losartan [ADDRESS_274224] 25% from baseline (screening) lab results while on less than maximal dose of losartan, add a THIRD drug from the following choices : 
 
• If serum Cr  increases by 25% or more from baseline (screening) lab results regardless of 
serum K, add doxazosin 2 mg daily. 
• If repeated serum K is ≥ 3.8 and serum Cr increases by < 25%, add Chlorthalidone 12.5 
mg daily.  
• If repeated serum K is < 3.8 and serum Cr increases by < 25%, add spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407] 25 mg 
daily.  
 
 
4) If clinic SBP reaches target goal ( <[ADDRESS_274225] arm and < 130 mmHg for intensive 
arm), obtain 24 -Hr ambula tory BP monit oring to conﬁrm.  If 24 -Hr SBP does not reach goal (<[ADDRESS_274226] arm and < 120  mmHg for intensive arm), use the same protocol for BP 
�tra�on based on corresponding clinic SBP from 1 -3. 
 
Electrolyte Management :  
 
1) If serum K  is between 5 -5.5, stop K supplement (if applicable) and reduce losartan and 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_227603] 50%.  
STU102017- 029, Zhang, FormA3 -ResearchProtocol, Mod_21, 10 -05-21 (1)  
Version 1.0      Page 16 of 61   
2) If K is between 5.5 -5.9, hold losartan and spi[INVESTIGATOR_227604]�l K+ <4.8, then consider 
resuming at 50% reduced dose.  
  
Repeat basic metabolic panel in 2 weeks. If needed, increase or add another BP 9medica�on to 
control BP (amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 5 -10 mg once daily, doxazosin 4 -8 mg once daily, hydralazine 25 -100 BID 
either alone or in combina�on).  
 
3) If serum K  is ≥ 6.0 mmol/L , subjects should visit emergency department immediately for 
further management to avoid life threatening arrhythmia.  
 
4) If serum Cr  increases ≥ 50% from the baseline (screening), hold losartan, spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407], 
and chlorthalidone and repeat basic metabolic panel in 2 weeks.  Increase or add other BP 
medica�on to control BP , if needed (amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 5 -10 mg once daily, doxazosin 4 -8 mg on ce 
daily, hydralazine 25 -100 BID, either alone or in combina�on).  
 
5) If serum Na  is < 132 or K < 3.0, reduce chlorthalidone by 50% (i.e. if pa�ent is taking 25 mg 
daily, reduce to 12.5 mg. if pa�ent is taking 12.5 mg daily, then stop chlorthalidone).  
 
6) If serum K  is between 3.0 -3.5, start KCl supplement 40 meq daily and repeat basic metabolic 
panel in 2 weeks.  
 
7) If serum K  is between 2.5 -2.9, start KCl supplement dose 40 meq BID, stop chlorthalidone 
and any thiazide diure�cs, and repeat basic metabolic panel in 1 week.  
 
8) If serum K  is <2.5 mmol/L, subjects should visit emergency department immediately for 
intravenous K supplement and for further management to avoid life threatening arrhythmia.  
 
The dose of K supplement may be individualized according to clinical judgment.  
 
Management of Low BP/Orthosta�c Symptoms  
If average seated systolic BP (SBP) < [ADDRESS_274227] standing systolic BP is < 90 mmHg or 
orthosta�c symptoms (dizziness upon standing, near fain�ng, or syncope) are reported, reduce 
doxazosin and/ or losartan by 50%.  
 
Reﬁll an�hypertensive drugs according to the BP and lab results. Lab results may not be available at the 
�me of visit. However, only Losartan, diure�cs (chlorthalidone and spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407]), and potassium

“Clinical iner�a” in hypertension management, where clinicians fail to intensify therapy despi[INVESTIGATOR_227615]�ents 
not being at goal BP , has been observed in both clinical prac�ce and clinical trial se�ngs. For this reason, 
“Milepost Visits” were used in the intensive BP group in the ACCORD and SPRINT trials to assist in 
reaching goal SBP . For all par�cipants Milepost Visit date will be assigned at 6 months . 
Between these dates, an�hypertensive medica�ons should be adjusted and/or addi�onal an�hypertensive medica�ons should be added within the recommended dose range to achieve the 
target BP . However, once a milepost date has been reached and the par�cipant’s 24-SBP is not under 
target goal, the inves�gator is required to add to the exis�ng regimen another  an�hypertensive drug 
from a drug class diﬀerent from what is being taken, unless there are compelling reasons to wait. The 
par�cipant should be seen monthly un�l the clinic SBP reaches goal .

Version 1.0      Page 28 of 61 If the inves�gator believes that the addition of another drug may potentially be harmful to the

case report form and reviewed by  [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Vongpatanasin.  
 
4.5  Diastolic Blood Pressure Treatment  
The primary BP goal is SBP < 130. Once the SBP goal is achieved, the an�hypertensive regimen should be 
intensiﬁed to achieve 24-Hr  DBP < [ADDRESS_274265] arm and < 70 mmHg for intensive arm . If clinic 
DBP remains ≥ 95  mmHg at a single visit or ≥ 90 mmHg at two successive visits, an�hypertensive 
treatment should be intensiﬁed. The visit intervals and decisions for �tra�on (other than the BP levels) 
will be similar to those used for the SBP goal.  
 
4.6  Drug Dispensing  
All study medica�ons dispensed to par�cipants will be labeled with the medica�on, study and 
par�cipant’s name, strength and quan�ty, direc�ons for use, and authorized prescriber’s name. An emergency study -related phone number for study drug informa� on will also appear on the label. All 
par�cipants are to be counseled verbally on medica�on administra�on. Writen instruc�ons will also be provided.  
Par�cipants will receive a 30 -day medica�on supply at each regular visit during the ﬁrst  3 months a�er 
randomiza�on. A�er  3 months, a 90 -day supply may be provided to reduce unnecessary visits to the 
study sites. Medica�on may be dispensed in the intervening periods between visits in case of emergency, loss, or schedule change. A tracking record is maintained for all dispensing ac�ons. It is recommended that the number of authorized dispensing personnel be limited to assure proper adherence to established accountability and dispensing procedures.  
 
4.7  Drug Storage  and Disposal  
Clinical Sites are responsible for destroying expi[INVESTIGATOR_227616]�ng destruc�on.  
4.8  Concomitant Medica�ons  
STU102017- 029, Zhang, FormA3 -ResearchProtocol, Mod_21, 10 -05-21 (1)  
Version 1.0      Page 29 of 61 Combina�ons of RAS blockers (ACE inhibitor, ARB, and/or renin inhibitor) are strongly discouraged in 
HIPAC , based on lack of beneﬁt and adverse outcomes seen in several large randomized controlled trials.  
The use of 2 nodal blockers ( beta blocker  and a non -dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker) is strongly 
discouraged. Addi�ve reduc�ons in heart rate, cardiac conduc�on, and cardiac contrac�lity may occur when non -dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (e.g., verapamil or dil�azem) are use d 
concomitantly with beta blockers. While this combina�on may be useful and eﬀec�ve in some situa�ons, poten�ally serious cardiovascular adverse eﬀects such as conges�ve heart failure, heart block, severe bradycardia, ventricular asystole, and sinus arrest have been reported. If a non -dihydropyridine CCB 
(e.g., dil�azem) is to be used, it should not be combined with a beta -blocker.  
An HIPAC  par�cipant who cannot achieve SBP at target goal despi[INVESTIGATOR_227617] ﬁrst to ﬁ�h line 
drug therapy outlined may require Minoxidil to achieve target BP . Since Minoxidil is a potent vasodilator, 
par�cipants not receiving adequate doses of a diure�c (usually a loop diure�c with or without a thiazide 
diure�c) will face a substan�al risk of ﬂuid overload. Therefore, whenever a par�cipant is prescribed 
Minoxidil, addi�onal therapy with either chlorthalidone or a loop diure�c is strongly  encouraged. 
Although the diure�c dose requirement may vary from pa�ent to pa�ent, most pa�ents on Minoxidil will require at least 12.5mg/day chlorthalidone or loop diure�c equivalent to furosemide 40 mg/day 
(usually BID unless prescribed with a thiazide diure�c). Par�cipants on Minoxidil doses above 20 mg/day will require even higher diure�c doses and the need for a combina�on of a thiazide and loop diure�c is not uncommon. Par�cipants prescri bed Minoxidil without also receiving chlorthalidone o r a loop diure�c 
will receive email alerts and messages similar to those described above for discouraged combina�ons.  
The use of simvasta�n with calcium channel blockers including amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], verapamil, and dil�azem 
should be avoided due to increased risk of muscle damage (htp:// Safety Oﬃcer 
.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm256581.htm). Similarly, simvasta�n should not be used at the dose of 80 
mg because of increased risk of myopathy. Simvasta�n should not be used in HIPAC . 
Some prescrip�on or over -the-counter drugs (as shown in the following list) may reduce 
an�hypertensive eﬃcacy of BP medica�ons or directly increase BP . The use of these drugs should be 
discouraged or minimized as much as possible.

4.9  Medica�on Adherence  
Par�cipants will be asked to return study medic a�on botles, used and unused, at each visit; pi[INVESTIGATOR_227618]. The percentage of pi[INVESTIGATOR_38947]/dispensed will be used to 
document drug adherence. HIPAC  will strive to achieve a goal >80% treatment adherence. Poten�al 
eﬀects of interven�on adherence on study outcome measures will be assessed as secondary data 
analysis.  
Monthly phone or in -person follow -up and three month clinic visits to monitor study safety and 
compliance will be conducted with all par�cipants in order to maintain the same level of study contact 
[CONTACT_227664].  
 
4.10 Assessment of Orthosta�c Hypotension (OH), Measurement of Standing Blood Pressure  
Standing BP will be measured at screening, and all subsequent visits, using the same BP device that is 
used to measure seated BP . A�er seated BP measurements, par�cipants will be asked to stand. Beginning when their feet touch the ﬂoor, BP will be taken  one minute later in the same arm used for the 
seated measurements. Par�cipants will be asked a�er the standing BP measurements if they had any symptoms of orthosta�c hypotension during the standing BP measurement.  
Par�cipants with standing SBP <100 mm Hg will not be eligible for randomiza�on (may be rescreened if corrected). However, the detec�on of asymptoma�c orthosta�c hypotension, i.e., orthosta�c hypotension unaccompanied by [CONTACT_227665]�c symptoms of dizzin ess, presyncope or syncope will not 
STU102017- 029, Zhang, FormA3 -ResearchProtocol, Mod_21, 10 -05-21 (1)  
Version 1.0      Page 31 of 61 inﬂuence the an�hypertensive drug treatment algorithm. Symptoma�c orthosta�c hypotension will be 
managed as follows.  
Deﬁni�on  
Orthosta�c hypotension (OH) is usually deﬁned as a decline of systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥20 mmHg or a decline of diastolic BP ≥10 mmHg that occurs within 3 minutes a�er moving from a supi[INVESTIGATOR_227619] a standing posi�on.  
Symptoms  
OH may be asymptoma�c or may be accompanied by [CONTACT_80355], lightheadedness, feeling faint, or 
syncope. Generally, asymptoma�c OH should not change adherence to the HIPAC  protocol, although 
medica�on classes may be adjusted to con�nue appropriate  BP control while minimizing postural 
hypotension (see below Management of OH ).  
Predisposing Condi�ons  
In epi[INVESTIGATOR_227620] . Diabetes mellitus and other autonomic neuropathies, volume deple�on, varicose veins, alcoholism, and certain medica�ons are also associated with OH.  
Note:  Occasionally, hypotension occurs if a pa�ent previously nonadherent to prescribed medica�ons 
begins taking the medica�ons. Because BP typi[INVESTIGATOR_227621] a�er a meal due to splanchnic blood pooling, standing BP should not be measured within 90 minutes a�er a meal if possible.  
Predisposing Medica�ons  
Some classes of medica�ons are more likely to cause OH than others. The most frequent oﬀenders currently in use are alpha -blocking drugs, such as prazosin, terazosin, or doxazosin, and central alpha 
agonists, such as clonidine, methyldopa or guanfacine. Although beta -blockers are perhaps the least 
likely an�hypertensive class to cause OH, one of the most common adverse eﬀects of combined alp ha-
beta blockers, such as labeta lol or carvedilol, is OH or dizziness, primarily because of the alpha- blocking 
com ponent of these drugs. Rarely, beta -blockers may cause OH because of severe bradycardia (e.g., 
heart rate <40 -50 beats/min) and inability to increase heart rate/cardiac output in upright posture, 
especially if other drugs or condi�ons have lowered BP excessively. Occasionally, reserpi[INVESTIGATOR_050], nitrates, or 
STU102017- 029, Zhang, FormA3 -ResearchProtocol, Mod_21, 10 -05-21 (1)  
Version 1.[ADDRESS_274266] notably 
phenothiazines, can also cause OH.  
Thiazide diure�cs rarely cause OH, unless the pa�ent is signiﬁcantly volume depleted or another agent is added to a diure�c that may cause ﬁrst -dose hypotension (e.g., a short -ac�ng ACE inhibitor like captopril 
or a short -ac�ng alpha blocker like pr azosin). High dose loop diure�cs, such as furosemide, or 
combina�ons of diure�cs may lead to excessive volume deple�on and hypotension, with or without OH.  
Management of OH  
Pa�ents with poor oral intake, dehydra�on from any cause, GI or renal causes for excessive ﬂuid loss, or hemorrhage, may need to have their diure�c or other an�hypertensive medica�ons stopped temporarily un�l the volume- deple�on is corrected. If a par�cipant with symptoma�c OH has no obvious cause of 
excessive volume deple�on, the medica�on regimen should be reviewed. Psychotropic drugs may need to be reduced in dose or changed to alterna�ve agents (many newer ones are equally eﬀec�ve without hypotensive eﬀects). If the pa�ent is on an alpha -blocker, alpha -beta blocker, or central alpha agonist, 
the dose should be reduced or the poten�ally oﬀending agent discon�nued. If necessary for BP control, that drug should be replaced with another class of an�hypertensive that is less likely to cause symptoma�c OH. If the par�cipant requires an alpha -blocker for BPH/bladder outlet obstruc�ve 
symptoms, a more selec�ve alpha -blocker (e.g., tamsulosin) may be considered.  
Pa�ents with symptoma�c OH should eat small meals and avoid standing up rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375] a�er ea�ng. Such individuals should avoid hot showers and other excessive heat exposure. An increase in sodium intake may be considered in pa�ents without hypertension or heart failure. In individuals with large varicose veins, ﬁted elas�c hose or compression stockings may reduce venous pooling in the legs. In refractory 
cases of symptoma�c OH, drug therapy with vasoconstrictors such as midodrine or dihydroergotamine 
or with mineralcor�coids may be considered. This is unlikely to be needed in HIPAC.  
Implica�ons for protocol  
The presence of orthosta�c hypotension, par�cularly if asymptoma�c, should not be considered as an exclusion from the study, par�cularly since some studies indicate that control of hypertension can lead to improvement in orthosta�c hypotension. Likewi se, decisions regarding up -�tra�on toward protocol 
blood pressure targets should be made primarily on the basis of the seated blood pressure measurements. Orthosta�c hypotension should also not preclude up -�tra�on toward blood pressure 
targets. When symptoma�c, it is suggested that ini�al eﬀorts described above should be directed toward 
STU102017- 029, Zhang, FormA3 -ResearchProtocol, Mod_21, 10 -05-21 (1)  
Version 1.0      Page 33 of 61 iden�ﬁca�on of other causes (e.g., psychotropic drugs, recent meal inges�on) and preferen�al use of 
hypertension medica�on classes that have less predilec�on to orthosta�c hypotension.  
 
4.11  Dietary / Lifestyle Modiﬁca�on  
Dietary modiﬁca�ons are recommended based both on blood pressure control and preven�on of CVD 
risk factors. The main focus of nutri�on interven�on for HIPAC  par�cipants without chronic kidney 
disease will be the DASH Diet recommenda�on. Pa�ents with stage 3 or greater kidney disease will receive alternate dietary instruc�on. Recommenda�ons will also be made for alcohol intake.  
DASH Diet  
The DASH diet is an ea�ng plan that is low in saturated fat, cholesterol, and total fat. It emphasizes fruits, vegetables, fat -free or low -fat milk and milk products, and includes whole grain products, ﬁsh, poultry 
and nuts. Red meat, sweets, added sugar s and sugar -containing beverages are reduced on the DASH 
ea�ng plan. The DASH diet is rich in potassium, magnesium and calcium as well as protein and ﬁber.  
HIPAC  par�cipants who do not have chronic kidney disease should be introduced to the DASH diet by 
[CONTACT_95002]. Each par�cipant will receive a copy of the DASH diet recommenda�on  prepared 
especially for HIPAC  par�cipants at the study enrollment. Study coordinators should review the table 
that provides the number of daily servings for the DASH ea�ng plan with study par�cipants. 
Diet for Chronic Kidney Disease  
The DASH diet is high in nutrients and foods which can be detrimental to par�cipants with chronic 
kidney disease. Par�cipants mee�ng the criteria for chronic kidney disease should instead be counseled 
on a prudent renal diet and provided with the Na�onal Kidney Founda�on educa�onal material (see htp:// Safety Oﬃcer .kidney.org/atoz/index.cfm). Speciﬁcally, pa�ents with chronic kidney disease 
should be counseled to limit foods that are high in phosphorus. They may also need to limit their potassium intake and their intake of protein. Protein -rich foods include red meat, poultry, ﬁsh and other 
seafood, eggs, dairy product and vegetables and grains.  
Reduced Sodium Diet  
Dietary sodium intake should be reduced to less than 1500 mg/day for the HIPAC  study popula�on.

Version 1.[ADDRESS_274267], garlic, spi[INVESTIGATOR_187621], herbs and salt subs� tutes. Par�cipants with chronic kidney disease should be 
counseled to discuss use of salt subs�tutes with their health care provider or clinical nutri�onist before 
using. Many of these products subs�tute potassium for sodium. Increased potassium intak e is not 
recommended for pa�ents with CKD. Emphasize choosing more fresh foods - vegetables, fruits, grains, 
meats, and minimally processed foods. Encourage more home prepara�on of foods and reading food 
labels to help make lower sodium choices. Examples  of diet high in sodium are shown in the table below 
which should be avoided or minimized.  
4.12 Study Drug  Supply and Dispensing  
4.12.1 Drug Dispensing  
Drugs will be labeled and iden�ﬁed with the study name, par�cipant’s name, medica�on name, strength 
and quan�ty, direc�ons for use, and authorized prescriber’s name. An emergency study -related phone 
number for study drug informa�on will also appear on the label. All par�cipants are to be counseled verbally on medica�on administra�on. Writen instruc�ons will also be provided.  
Par�cipants will receive  a 30 -90 day medica�on suppl y during each  regular visit  (the amount of drug 
dispensing will be site speciﬁc). Medica�on dispensing may occur in the intervening periods between visits in case of emergency, loss, or schedule changes. A tracking mechanism is maintained for all dispensing ac�ons. It is recommended that authorized dispensing personnel be limited in  number to 
assure proper adherence with established accountability and dispensing procedures.  
 
4.12 .2 Drug Storage  
Research personnel  is responsible for storing the study drug supplies in a locked, secure area with 
limited access. Manufacturer recommenda�ons and local policies for drug storage must be followed.

The randomiza�on procedures will be explained fully to the par�cipants during enrollment and their 
understanding and willingness to be randomized into one of the 2 study arms will be conﬁrmed. 
Par�cipants will be encouraged to stay with the interven�ons they have received . Any changes in the 
health -related behavior or medica�on, which may impact study outcome, will be reviewed, discussed 
and documented during regular study visits.   
Treatment eﬀects of BP will be monitored at each study visit. Par�cipants will be asked to return study an�hypertensive drug botles, used and unused, at each visit ; pi[INVESTIGATOR_227622].  The percentage of pi[INVESTIGATOR_38947]/dispensed will be used to document drug adherence. Poten�al 
eﬀects of interven�on adherence  on study outcome measures will be assessed as secondary data 
analysis.  
Monthly phone or in -person follow -up and three month clinic visits to monitor study safety and 
compliance will be conducted with all par�cipants in order to maintain a same level of study contact 
[CONTACT_227666]. At each visit, par�cipants will be asked about any changes in their medica�ons 
and health to monitor and record poten�al inﬂuences on study outcome measures.  
 4.14 Reten�on Strategies  
Every eﬀort will be made to provide a friendly clinic environment for study visits, to foster personal 
rela�onships between study staﬀ and par�cipants, and to minimize study burden. Clearly writen 
instruc�ons for follow -up visits will be provided and reminder calls will be made before each study vi sit.  
 
 
Sec�on  5. Outcome Measurements  and Follow -Up 
Post -randomiza�on follow -up schedules for outcome  measure ments  and safety  monitoring  are 
summarized in Table  1. Par�cipants will be monitored and interviewed during monthly  phone or in -
person visits and clinic visits at 6, 9, 12, months  for all study arms .  All follow -up visits will be completed 
within a �me window of ± 2 weeks. Vital signs, physical exam and laboratory tests will be performed if 
suggested by [CONTACT_227667].

Version 1.0      Page 38 of 61 5.5 Discon�nua�ons  
5.5.1 Discon�nua�on of Subjects  
Subjects may be discon�nued from the interven�on , but remain in the study , or may be withdrawn from 
the study by [CONTACT_227669]�gator for any of the following reasons  : 
1)  Persistently low eGFR of < 15 ml/min/1.73 m2 or serum K+ > 5.5mmol/L that does not 
respond to an�hypertensive dose reduc�on or adjustment.  
2) Systolic BP equal or greater than 180mmHg and/or diastolic BP equal or greater than 110 
mmHg.  
3) Comorbidi�es that make con�nued par�cipa�on in the study  medically inappropriate or 
impossible.  
4)  Signiﬁcant cogni�ve decline  deﬁned as a decrease in MMSE by 3 points and/or  clinical 
manifesta�on of confusion, disorienta�on, problems with judgment or  bizarre behavior that 
may impair subject’s  safety and/or ability to par�cipate in the study.  
 
5) Subjects may withdraw their consent at any �me by [INVESTIGATOR_8614]�fying study staﬀ.  
 Any subject who withdraws or is discon�nued will be referred to their trea�ng physician/ PCP for 
follow -up during reduc�on or discon�nua�on of sta�ns or an�hypertensive  in order to monitor 
and resolve any drug- related abnormali�es . Subjects who withdraw or discon�nue due to 
signiﬁcant  cogni�ve decline will be evaluated by [CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_227625]�a  or other diseases are  present. Previous cogni�ve  test results will be reviewed and 
Clinical Demen�a Ra�ng (CDR) scale  will be used to assist clinical judgment. Subjects who 
discon�nue from the study  early  will be encouraged to have an early termina�on visit at the 
�me  of discon�nua�on  so that  study staﬀ can perform as many outcome measures  as possible  if 
judged clinically safe for par�cipants .

Version 1.0      Page 39 of 61 5.5.2 Temporary Discon�nua�ons  
An�hypertensive drugs may be temporarily discon�nued if par�cipants develop low BP (<90/60 mmHg)  
and renal dysfunc�on (eGFR reduced by > 50%) related to severe dehydra�on, nausea, vomi�ng, 
diarrhea, reduced oral intake, or febrile illness that may inci dentally occur during the trial. BP treatment 
may be re started a�er side eﬀects are reduced and it is judged clinically safe  to restart study medica�on . 
5.5.3 Discon�nua�on of the Study   
The study may be discon�nued by [CONTACT_1201], SO, NIH or other government agencies as part of their du�es 
to ensure the protec�on of research par�cipants.  In addi� on, DSMB may require an interim safety data 
analysis based on the overall safety proﬁle and AE or SAEs  monitoring to make recommenda�ons to the 
NIH and the PIs  concerning discon�nua�on of the study  if the adverse eﬀects during the study period 
exceed what would be expected under the study treatments (BP reduc�on ) in older adults when 
compared with similar trials reported previously . 
 
 
 
Sec�on  6. Safety Monitoring and Repor�ng  
6.1 Introduc�on All an�hypertensive agents  in the study  have been approved by [CONTACT_227670]�on (FDA) 
and have been rou�nely prescribed for lowering BP and blood lipid level in older adults . Pa�ent safety 
will be monitored carefully beginning from the enrollment and throughout  the whole study . Each 
par�cipa�ng inves�gator has  primary responsibility for the safety of par�cipants under his/her care. In  
addi�on, an independent HIPAC Safety Oﬃcer (SO)  will monitor the study safety  and any poten�al 
treatment -related adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) to protect  the safety of study 
par�cipants . 
 6.2 Safety Monitoring  
STU102017- 029, Zhang, FormA3 -ResearchProtocol, Mod_21, 10 -05-21 (1)  
Version 1.0      Page 40 of 61 Several safety issues related to the side eﬀects of an�hypertensive agents may be a  concern  (discussed 
below) . Poten�al side eﬀects of an�hypertensive drugs will be reviewed and discussed with par�cipants 
during the enrollment . Par�cipants  will be asked to inform the study clinician or staﬀ immediately if side 
eﬀects occur and persist. Par�cipants will be monitored and interviewed during each of the follow -up 
visits to ensure that any symptoms are addressed early and properly.  
An�hypertensive medica�on  
Poten�al adverse eﬀects of the blood pressure drugs used in HIPAC  have been well documented.  For 
example, electrolyte abnormali�es (hyponatremia or hypokalemia are known to be associated with 
thiazide diure�cs; hyperkalemia and short -term decline in GFR with losartan, hyperkalemia with 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_8407]; as well as brady cardia with beta blockers). Par�cipants will be monitored rou�nely with 
interviews, vital signs, targeted physical examina�on and regular laboratory tests to ensure safety (see Figure 1, Table 2).  In addi�on, site clinicians may also obtain lab tests and/or ECG if safety is a concern at 
non-scheduled intervals. Clinical alerts are generated when the safety parameters exceed the established 
thresholds (see Table 2).  Expected events associated BP drugs will not be considered as SAEs unless they 
meet the criteria for a SAE.

 6.3 Protec�on Against Risk  
STU102017- 029, Zhang, FormA3 -ResearchProtocol, Mod_21, 10 -05-21 (1)  
Version 1.0      Page 41 of 61 Risk associated with an�hypertensive medica�ons : All an�hypertensive medica�ons used in the study 
are approved by [CONTACT_1622]. The side eﬀects and risks are not more than the expected risk in the clinical 
se�ng. However,  we plan to m odify treatment in response to safety concerns  as below:  
 
If serum K+ > 5.0 mmol/L : 
1. If serum K+ is between 5 -5.5, stop K supplement (if applicable) and reduce losartan and spi[INVESTIGATOR_227626] 50%.  
2. If K+ is between 5.5 -5.9, hold losartan and spi[INVESTIGATOR_227604]�l K+ < 4.8, then consider resuming at 50% 
reduced dose. Repeat BMP  in 2 weeks. Increase or add other BP medica�on to control BP if needed 
(amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 5 -10 mg once daily, doxazosin 4 -8 mg once daily, hydralazine 25 -100 BID either alone or in 
combina�on).  
3. If serum K+ is  ≥  6.0 mmol/L, pa�ents should visit emergency department immediately for further 
management to avoid life threatening arrhythmia.  
4. Increase or add Amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], Doxazosin, hydralazine, chlorthalidone to control BP , if needed.  
5. Recheck BP and BMP 1 -2 weeks a�er drug adjustment.  
 
 
If serum K+ < 3.5 or serum Na+ < 13 0 mmol/L:   
1. Reduce chlorthalidone dose by 50%.  
2. Increase or add other BP m edica�on to control BP , if needed.  
3. If serum K+ is between 3.0 -3.5, subjects will receive KCl supplement 40 meq daily and BMP will be 
repeated in 2 weeks.  
4. If serum K+ is between 2.5 -2.9, subjects will receive KCl supplement 40  meq bid, stop chlorthalidone 
and any thiazide diure�cs, and BMP will be repeated in 1 week.  
5. If serum K+ is < 2.5 mmol/L, pa�ents will be asked to visit emergency department immediately for 
intravenous K supplement for further management to avoid life threatening arrhythmia.  
6. Recheck BP and BMP in 1 -2 weeks a�er drug adjustment.  
 
HR < 40 bpm or evidence of AV or new bundle block : 
1. Reduce the dose of Beta Blockers by 50%.  
2. Increase or add other an�hypertensive  drugs to control BP , if needed.  
3. Recheck BP a�er drug adjustment.  
STU102017- 029, Zhang, FormA3 -ResearchProtocol, Mod_21, 10 -05-21 (1)  
Version 1.0      Page 42 of 61  
Standing SBP < 90 mmHg or seated SBP <100 mmHg :  
1. Reduce the dose of Doxazosin, or amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], or diure�cs or Losartan by 50 %.  
2. Recheck seated and standing BP 2 weeks a�er drug adjustment. If the standing BP con�nues to be 
<90, discon�nue Doxazosin, or other an�hypertensive drugs, as needed.  
 
Magne�c Resonance Imaging 
MRI is a safe procedure, used rou�nely in the clinical evalua�on of brain disorders. There are no known 
risks from exposure of older adults to 3T magne�c ﬁelds  that will be used in this study . Claustrophobia 
occurs occasionally in the MRI scanner, but there are no known long -term adverse eﬀects . Usually, 
conversa�on and reassurance will remove such anxie�es. If subjects experience severe anxiety during 
MRI, they will be free to end the session  at any �me . However, metallic objects are hazardous in M RI 
environment because they can interact and be atracted to the scanner. As a result, e ach subject will be 
screened with a standard MRI safety form before each MRI scan to rule out poten�al safety hazards. A par�cipan t who is wearing a pacemaker, neuros�mulator, or any other implanted device will not be 
allowed to par�cipate in MRI. All metallic objects (keys, watches, and the like) will be removed from the researchers and subjects before the MRI experiment begins.  
 
The risk of MRI to pregnant women and unborn babies is not known. For this reason, women who are 
pregnant are not allowed to enter the scanner environment. Thus female par�cipants will be asked to ﬁll out the pregnancy screening form. We will provide a pregnancy test to each female par�cipant who is 
unsure if she is pregnant. If par�cipants have a posi�ve pregnancy test, or are not sure whether they are 
pregnant, but don’t want to take the pregnant test, they will not be able to par�cipate in this stu dy. 
 
Phlebotomy Venous catheters are placed for blood sampling  
There is a small (<5%) risk of superﬁcial thrombus at the inser�on site, and a smaller risk (<2%) of bleeding or infec�on.  To make the blood draw procedure safe and easy for the par�cipants, only trained 
and experienced Phlebotomist/Nurses will be delegated to perform venipuncture. All measures will be taken to ensure infec�on preven�on.

Ques�onnaire administra�on and neuropsychological tes�ng  
Every eﬀort will be made by [CONTACT_227669]�gators to minimize the possible risks of psychological and/or 
physiological discomfort of par�cipants during either interviews or studies by [CONTACT_227671] oﬀering rest breaks if needed or requi red.  Par�cipants  can skip any ques�on that they do not 
wish to answer and any test that they do not want to perform.  
 
Loss of Conﬁden�ality  
The data obtained from this project will be used exclusively for the purpose of the research and will not be iden�ﬁable to individual subjects when published. All informa�on obtained that can be iden�ﬁed with an individual subject will remain conﬁden �al and will be disclosed only with a subject’s permission.  
We will retain whatever blood and cerebral spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304] ﬂuid are le� over a�er all the analyses are complete in case other tests become available that might be useful to explain the eﬀects of aging on the brain. The samples will be kept in the freezer in the Stowe lab at UTSW. All samples will be labeled and coded, with each subject’s personal informa�on de -iden�ﬁed. Only the study inves�gators will have access to these 
samples. All data collec ted will be coded with an experiment and subject speciﬁc code to maintain 
conﬁden�ality. Only the members of the research team will be able to access to this coding informa�on. All samples will be kept un�l the end of the study then de-iden�ﬁed for future research.  
 
Other Risks  
Unan�cipated problems or side eﬀects  of BP lowering  drugs  that are unknown at this �me may be 
possible. The inves�gators will make e very eﬀort to minimize poten�al risks of par�cipants experiencing 
either psychological or physiological discomfort s during either interviews or studies by oﬀering 
reassurance and rest breaks if needed. All  study procedures and protocols will be approved by [CONTACT_227672] Oﬃcer (SO). 
 
6.4 Safety Repor�ng  
STU102017- 029, Zhang, FormA3 -ResearchProtocol, Mod_21, 10 -05-21 (1)  
Version 1.0      Page 44 of 61 6.4.1 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse Event  (AE) 
Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human study par�cipant, including any abnormal 
sign (e.g. abnormal physical exam or laboratory ﬁnding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the par�cipants’ involvement in the research, whether or not considered related to par�cipa�on in the research.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
Any adverse event that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening, or places the par�cipant at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred  
• Requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_182910]�on  
• Causes persistent or signiﬁcant disability or incapacity  
• Results in congenital anomalies or birth defects  
• Is another condi�on which inves�gators judge to represent signiﬁcant hazards   
 
Par�cipants will be queried for AEs and SAEs at regular phone and clinic visits. Informa�on on SAEs may 
also be reported to study staﬀ by [INVESTIGATOR_57967]�cipants at any �me between visits.  
 
6.4.2 AE Repor�ng  
All AEs , expected or unexpected, are collected on an Adverse Event Form . All AEs experienced by [CONTACT_227655]�cipant during the �me frame of the study  (e.g. screening, baseline, follow -up visits or close -out), 
under a speciﬁc condi�on and loca�on will  be reported. The repor�ng  �me frame and procedures will 
meet the requirements of the local IRB, HIPAC  SO and NIA.  
 
6.4.3 SAE Repor�ng  
SAEs will be reported to the UT Southwestern Medical Center and [LOCATION_007] Health Presby[CONTACT_24021][INVESTIGATOR_227627]�tu�onal Review Boards as soon as the event is known. A ll SAEs  will be recorded by [CONTACT_227673]. Zhang and Vongpatanasin  within 48 hours  of knowledge of the 
event. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_227628]�fy the Safety Oﬃcer and NI A Program Oﬃcer within 24 hours of the event being 
STU102017- 029, Zhang, FormA3 -ResearchProtocol, Mod_21, 10 -05-21 (1)  
Version 1.0      Page 45 of 61 reported. The SO and NIA will receive no�ﬁca�on about all SAEs within 72 hours of when the event is 
known and reported by [CONTACT_227674]ﬀ.  The repor�ng �me frame and procedures to the local IRBs will follow 
the guidelines of the local IRB. SAEs will be collected and reported from screening to the end of the 
study follow -up period for an individual par�cipant. SAEs will be followed un�l resolu�on, stabiliza�on, 
or un�l it is determined that study par�cipa�on is not the cause.  If a par�cipant is seen  in the ER and 
within seven days is admited to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34092] a procedure related to that ER visit, a separate SAE does not need to be completed. The original SAE for the ER visit should be edited to reﬂect the ER visit and the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_182910]�on.   
Drs. Zhang and Vongpatanasin  will be responsible for �mely repor�ng to the NIH and the SO  and provide 
reports of SAEs  for review by [CONTACT_227675] e- mail or at their mee�ngs.  
 
The expedited report will be followed by a detailed, writen SAE report as soon as possible. Follow up 
informa�on may be required and asked directly  by [CONTACT_49529], or NIA Program Oﬃcer or his/her 
representa�ve.  
 
6.4 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP ) 
According to the NI H  guidelines, the Safety Oﬃcer is an independent individual who performs data and 
safety monitoring ac�vi�es in low -risk, single site clinical studies. The Safety Oﬃcer advises the NI H 
Program Director and Principal Inves�gator (PI) regarding par�cipant safety, scien�ﬁc integrity and 
ethical conduct of a study. The Principal Inves�gator typi[INVESTIGATOR_227629] Oﬃcer, usually a physician, with relevant study and di sease speciﬁc exper�se, and submits the ind ividual's name 
[CONTACT_227690] [CONTACT_153518] H Program Oﬃcer. 
Safety Oﬃcer (SO) will receive  the manual of opera�ng procedures, which typi[INVESTIGATOR_227630], before study enrollment begins.  
 To remain objec�ve,  SO will maintain independence from the study.   Accordingly, SO will not be directly 
involved in the conduct of the study and should not have scien�ﬁc, proprietary, ﬁnancial or other 
interests that may aﬀect independent decision -making. 
STU102017- 029, Zhang, FormA3 -ResearchProtocol, Mod_21, 10 -05-21 (1)  
Version 1.0      Page 46 of 61 At predetermined intervals, the study sta�s�cian will prepare adverse event reports to be reviewed by 
[CONTACT_49517].  The adverse events are reported in aggregate as requested.   Serious adverse events are generally 
reported as they occur. The safety monitoring plan should specify how data are to be presented.   In 
addi�on, the safety monitoring plan should specify the process for repor�ng safety concerns among the 
Ins�tu�onal Review Board, the Safety Oﬃcer and the NI H Program Oﬃcer.   
SO will provide  independent safety monitoring in a �mely fashion to assure pa�ent safety and study 
quality. 
At the beginning of the trial, SO will review the manual of opera�ng procedures, containing the study 
protocol, study forms, and safety monitoring plan, for scope and comprehensiveness. The monitoring 
plan should delineate data prepara�on func�ons, the review process, and the role of the Safety Oﬃcer. The monitoring plan also speciﬁes the contents and format of the reports, their frequency, and triggers for ad hoc reviews. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], if appropriate, should outline the condi�ons under which a stu dy may 
be stopped prematurely. The Safety Oﬃcer may suggest modiﬁca�ons to the protocol, the monitoring plan and the reports that will rou�nely be prepared by [CONTACT_227676]�s�cian.   
The primary focus of the Safety Oﬃcer’s monitoring ac�vity is par�cipant safety.   The Safety Oﬃcer 
reviews adverse event reports prepared by [CONTACT_227676]�s�cian.   
Serious adverse events are generally reviewed as they occur. The Safety Oﬃcer will no�fy the NIA if a patern of events occurs and will suggest preven�on measures.  
For unexpected and/or related serious adverse events,  SO  will contact [CONTACT_153518] H  Program representa�ve. 
In addi�on, the Safety Oﬃcer may request individual pa�ent records, including laboratory data, clinical records, and other study related data, to evaluate these events against the known safety proﬁle of the study treatment and  the disease. The Safety Oﬃcer may recommend ac�ons including par�al or 
complete unblinding, and/or modifying or termina�ng the study.   
In addi�on to safety monitoring, the Safety Oﬃcer may review enrollment data, demographic informa�on, reten�on status, and other reports prepared by [CONTACT_227676]�s�cian that describe study performance and progress.  SO will provide a report to NI H  that describes study safety, progress and 
performance and provides recommenda�ons regarding safe con�nua�on or early termina�on of the trial. 
STU102017- 029, Zhang, FormA3 -ResearchProtocol, Mod_21, 10 -05-21 (1)  
Version 1.0      Page 47 of 61  The monitoring plan may require SO to evaluate the general performance of the study, including 
periodic assessment of par�cipant recruitment, accrual and reten�on, protocol adherence, and data 
quality and �meliness.  SO may also review any interim analyses to ensure that once the objec�ves of 
the study are met, outcome diﬀerences are detected or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_98496], the study 
will conclude.  
 Conﬁden�ality must be maintained throughout all phases of the trial, including monitoring, prepara�on 
of interim results, review, and response to monitoring recommenda�ons.   Thus, SO will not receive 
pa�ent iden�ﬁers, will maintain study conﬁden�ality and will not share data.  
A�er review and evalua�on of the speciﬁed periodic reports prepared by [CONTACT_227677]�s�cian, SO  will prepare  
a summary cover leter for submission to the NIA. The leter provides comments on the report, discusses 
any concerns or sugges�ons for change, and recommends to NIA con�nua�on or cessa�on of the trial . 
  
Sec�on7. Sample Size and Sta�s�cal Methods  
Aim 1 : Determine the eﬀects of hypertension on intracranial pulsa�lity , CSF Aβ and tau, white mater 
integrity and neural network func�onal connec�vity . Hypotheses : Hypertension is associated with: 1)  
augmented central pulsa�lity, but reduced intracranial pulsa�lity; 2) reduc�ons in CSF soluble A β42, but 
increases in phosphorylated tau and total tau; 3) disrup�ons in brain white mater integrity and 
func�onal connec�vity.  
Ra�onale and an�cipated results  We an�cipate that central pulsa�lity is increased, while intracranial 
pulsa�lity is reduced in pa�ents with hypertension, which are associated with increases in cerebrovascular impedance and/or reduc�ons in brain �ssue compliance.
47, 48 We an�cipate that CSF 
Aβ42 is reduced, but total tau and phosphorylated tau are increased in hypertension, sugges�ng impact 
of intracranial pulsa�lity on brain A β and tau homeostasis via reduc�ons in glympha�c A β and tau 
clearance.9, [ADDRESS_274273] that brain white mater integrity in the regions related to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_227631]�ve func�on is reduced in hypertension, which is associated with reduc�ons in DMN and FPN 
connec�vity. We focus on a neural network approach to assess the impact of hypertension on brain 
structure and func�on because it is likely to detect early brain changes.16, 18, 22, 36 Gray mater atrophy, 
white mater lesions, and execu�ve dysfunc�on are observed in older adults with hypertension, and are likely inﬂuenced by [CONTACT_227678].
15 We do not propose to use PET amyloid imaging to 
assess brain A β burden because it is expensive, and only measures the amount of aggregated ﬁbrillary

Version 1.0      Page 48 of 61 Aβ in the cerebral cortex (extracellular plaques), which manifested only in about one- third of cogni�vely 
normal older adults.5, [ADDRESS_274274] a steady -state homeostasis (or a metabolic equilibrium) between the produc�on and 
clearance of brain A β and tau which may change in response to modiﬁable risk factors such as lowering 
BP , thus suitable for the purpose of this project.50, 51 
Sta�s�cal analysis and sample size jus�ﬁca�on Descrip�ve analysis will be performed where we 
summarize con�nuous variables by [CONTACT_227679]�on, and categorical variables by [CONTACT_227680]. Appropriate transforma�on will be performed when necessary so that the normality 
assump�on  is not violated. Comparisons between groups will be performed using two -sample T test or 
Chi-square test. The nonparametric Wilcoxon –Mann –Whitney test and Fisher’s exact test will be 
employed when necessary. We report sta�s�cal signiﬁcance for a p -value of <0.05 for the primary 
outcome measure of group diﬀerences in the magnitude of intracranial pulsa�lity. Due to the 
exploratory nature of the proposed study, no adjustments for mul�ple comparisons ar e planned a priori 
for other outcome measures. Adjustments for mul�ple comparisons for neuroimaging data analysis will be performed using the established methods.

media�on analysis to assess whether the eﬀects of hypertension on brain A β and tau, neural network 
structure and func�on are mediated by [CONTACT_227681]�ons in intracranial pulsa�lity. Speciﬁcally, to estab lish that 
the eﬀect of X (diﬀerences in BP) on the outcome Y (e.g., brain neural network structure or func�on) is mediated by M (intracranial pulsa�lity), the following four steps need to be sa�sﬁed: 1) The eﬀect of X on Y must be signiﬁcant; 2) The eﬀect of X on M much be signiﬁcant; 3) The eﬀect of M on Y controlling for X must be signiﬁcant; 4) the eﬀect of X on Y adjusted for M should be smaller than that observed in 
the step 1. We will use linear models, and the diﬀerence- in-coeﬃcients tests will be performed.
52 Sample 
size and power analysis  are based on group diﬀerences in the magnitude of intracranial pulsa�lity, that 
is, measurements of pulsa�le oscilla�ons in brain �ssue volume and regional brain �ssue movements 
(local pi[INVESTIGATOR_227632]). Previous studies and our pi[INVESTIGATOR_227633] e that the magnitude of pulsa�le 
oscilla�ons in total brain �ssue volume during a cardiac cycle is about 0.80 ± 0.15 ml, while the local brain �ssue movement at the edge of the lateral ventricle is about 0.165 ± 0.042 mm in all three spa�al direc�ons .
38, 43, 44 With a total of 120 subjects (40 normotensive and 80 hypertensive), a two -sample T 
test can detect a mean diﬀerence of 0.083 ml of changes in brain �ssue volume between the two groups with 80% power and 5% two -sided type I error. In addi�on, a mean diﬀ erence of 0.023 mm of local brain 
�ssue movement can be detected between the two groups with 80% power and 5% two -sided type I 
error.
53 All sta�s�cal analysis will be performed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Ins�tute, Cary, NC).  
STU102017- 029, Zhang, FormA3 -ResearchProtocol, Mod_21, 10 -05-21 (1)  
Version 1.0      Page 49 of 61 Poten�al problems  We do not an�cipant major problems in the proposed MRI and TCD studies because 
the proposed procedures have been used in our previous studies.35-37, 45 However, the magnitudes of 
pulsa�le oscilla�ons in brain �ssue movement and CSF in a cardiac cycle are rela�vely small (Fig 3), thus 
robust velocity post -processing procedures are essen�al to improve the accuracy and reliability of these 
measurements . The procedures for velocity post -processing have been developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Zhu (Co -PI [INVESTIGATOR_227634]) and their accuracy and reliability are demonstrated in previous studies.38, 54, 55 Essen�ally, to 
reduce the possibility of a spa�ally dependent oﬀset velocity due to eddy currents or head mo�on, the velocity at each pi[INVESTIGATOR_227635]�on will be corrected by [CONTACT_227682]�on of the �me- average “velocity” of a nearby 
[CONTACT_227683] �ssue “backgr ound” within a 29 mm × 29 mm region having the interested pi[INVESTIGATOR_227636].
38, 44, 56 In calcula�on of the velocity of the brain �ssue, the velocity at each pi[INVESTIGATOR_227635]�on will be 
corrected by a subtrac�on of the �me- average “velocity” of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_227637] a full cardiac 
cycle. This approach is based on the fact that brain  �ssue is unlikely to accumulate a net displacement 
over a cardiac cycle.38, 44, 56 The CINE PC -MRI also assumes that blood ﬂow, CSF ﬂow and brain mo�on 
paterns remain rela�vely constant and are in sync with the cardiac cycle. Following this assump�on, we will collect PC -MRI data at the second half of the scan session a�er the subjects are accustomed to the 
MRI environment and relaxing music will be provided to reduce poten�al discomfort. rs -fMRI 
connec�vity may be inﬂuenced by [CONTACT_227684]-processing methods to remove vascular contamina�on 
that is not related to neuronal ac�vi ty.
37, [ADDRESS_274276] controversial debate on the pre-processing steps is 
the global signal removal strategy.57 Our team is ac�vely working on a beter understanding of the 
impact of global signal removal on fMRI connec�vity, and has developed more un -biased noise -removal 
techniques.37 rs-fMRI reproducibility is also important to quan�fy the within -subject modiﬁca�on of the 
DMN and FPN. To improve the reproducibility, we propose to collect a rela�vely long but s�ll durable [ADDRESS_274277] considered that CSF samples may not be obtained from all study 
par�cipants. We plan to use an educa�on video as well as other materials provided by [CONTACT_104412]'s 
Disease Coopera�ve Study to improve par�cipant’s understanding of LP procedures and to increase enrollment. Based on our own experience and other trials, CSF samples are likely to be obtained from 
about 50 -60% of study par�cipants.
32, [ADDRESS_274278] about 50% of par�cipants being enrolled in the project. Finally, we acknowledge that we cannot measure directly brain A β and tau clearan ce 
through the glympha�c system. CSF soluble A β and tau reﬂect a steady -state homeostasis between the 
produc�on and clearance of A β and tau which ul�mately inﬂuences brain aging and AD.
2, 50 Thus, an 
associa�on between intracranial pulsa�lity and CSF A β and tau only suggest, but cannot prove a causal

Version 1.0      Page 50 of 61 rela�onship. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_227638], ﬁndings from this project will provide signiﬁcant new insights into the 
eﬀects of hypertension and an�hypertensive treatment on intracranial pulsa�lity, AD biomarkers, brain neural network structure and func�on.                
Aim 2: Determine the eﬀects of an�hypertensive treatments on intracranial pulsa�lity, CSF A β and tau, 
brain white mater integrity and neural network func�onal connec�vity. Hypotheses: compared to 
standard care, intensive treatment confers more beneﬁts by: 1)  reduc�ons in central pulsa�lity, but 
increases intracranial pulsa�lity; 2) increases in CSF Aβ 42, but reduc�ons in phosphorylated tau and total 
tau; 3)  improvement in brain white mater integrity and func�onal connec�vity.  
Ra�onale and an�cipated results The primary outcome measures of Aim 2 are BP treatment induced 
changes in intracranial pulsa�lity, CSF A β and tau. We an�cipate that cerebrovascular 
resistance/impedance is reduced, and brain �ssue compliance is improved a�er BP lowering, and these changes in turn increase global as well as regional intracranial pulsa�lity.
47, 48 We an�cipate 
an�hypertensive treatment alters central and/or intracranial pulsa�lity as well as the dynamic rela�onships between them. An important strength of this project is that we will be able to assess whether and to what extent each of the systemic and cerebrovascular factors contribute to the changes in intracranial pulsa�lity. Recent studies including our own work have demonstrated that increases in SBP and PBP are associated with increases in brain A β burden and elevated CSF tau in older adul ts, 
sugges�ng a poten�al link between hypertension and AD pathology.
4, 5, 49 We an�cipate that compared 
to the baseline, CSF A β42 level will be higher, and total and phosphorylated tau level will be lower a�er 
an�hypertensive treatment, and that larger changes are conferred by [CONTACT_227685].
50 We will determine whether changes in CSF A β42 and tau are associated 
with changes in intracranial pulsa�lity, sugges�ng improvement in brain A β and tau clearance through 
the glympha�c system.8, 12 Furthermore, we an�cipant that brain white mater integrity in the regions 
related to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_227595]�ve func�on, DMN and FPN func�onal connec�vity is improved a�er intensive BP treatment and that these improvements are associated with improvement in global and domain speciﬁc neurocogni�ve func�on. We expect that the eﬀects of BP treatment on brain 
white mater integrity, neural network structure and func�on are related to the magnitude of BP 
lowering. We have considered that althou gh the presence of intracranial pulsa�lity is cri�cal for brain A β 
and tau clearance,
10, 59 changes in intracranial pulsa�lity may have direct eﬀects on brain perfusion and 
brain neural network structure and func�on through either A β and tau dependent or independent 
mechanisms.3, 15, 60, [ADDRESS_274279] mul�variable

53 In addi�on, 
we will conduct media�on analysis to assess whether the eﬀects of BP lowering on CSF A β and tau 
concentra�ons, white mater microstructural integrity and neural network func�onal connec�vity are mediated by [CONTACT_227686]� lity. The causal-steps approach will be employed for the 
media�on analysis,
62 and linear models and the diﬀerence-in -coeﬃcients tests will be performed.52 We 
will build mul�variate regression models to assess the associa�on between the magnitude of BP reduc�ons and changes in intracranial pulsa�lity. The outcome and predictor variables will be the within -
subject changes in intracranial pulsa�lity and B P at one year from the baseline, respec�vely. The 
regression model will control for other confounding variables including interven�on, age, sex, BP medica�on and central arterial s�ﬀness. The ﬁnal model will be determined based on step -wise variable 
selec�on as well as clinical considera�ons. Sample size for the comparison of the slope of the magnitude 
of pulsa�le oscilla�ons in brain �ssue volume or regional brain �ssue movement between the treatment 
groups : We conducted power analysis based on  the GEE sample size approach developed for the test of 
slopes using longitudinal measurements.63, [ADDRESS_274281] 
devia�on of 0.15 ml for the two groups.43 At a 5% two -sided type I error and 80% power, by [CONTACT_79323] 40 
pa�ents in each group, we can detect a diﬀerence of 0.11 ml/year in the slope between the two groups. This calcula�on assumes a compound symmetric correla�on structure, a moderate within -subject 
correla�on of 0.25, and a dropout rate of 10% over the [ADDRESS_274282] correla�on on power analysis. For example, when the within -subject correla�on 
changes from 0.1 to 0.5, the diﬀerence in  the slopes that can be detected ranges from 0.1 to 0.13 
ml/year. Sample size for the comparison of changes in CSF at one year from baseline between the 
treatment groups: Assuming that a minimum of 50% of pa�ents (that is, 20 pa�ents from each group) 
will contribute to both baseline and [ADDRESS_274283] devia�on of annualized change in CSF A β42 is ~ 0.84 pg/ml.58 With 20

middle -aged and older adults suggests that the sta ndard devia�on of annualized change in global

Sec�on8. Risk/Beneﬁt Assessment  
To the study subjects: Occasionally, an unknown condi�on that might require medical aten�on (such as 
a brain tumor, hypertension and diabetes) could be discovered during a careful history and physical 
exam, and with MRI scan. In addi�on, being followed clinically by [CONTACT_227687]��oner, and par�cipa�ng in the proposed interven�on of intensive reduc�on of blood pressure are 
likely to be beneﬁcial for the par�cipants to improve cardiovascular and brain health.  
To others with similar problems:  This project will study the impact of hypertension and intensive 
an�hypertensive treatment on brain structure and func�on. The new knowledge obtained will provide 
mechanis�c understanding of eﬀects of hypertension and an�hypertensive treatments on br ain health in 
older adults.  
To society in general More than 60% of older adults age ≥ [ADDRESS_274286] hypertension which is an important 
risk factor for age -related cogni�ve decline and Alzheimer's disease. Understanding of the underlying 
mechanisms by [CONTACT_227688]�al bene ﬁts of an�hypertensive 
treatments on brain structure and func�on is fundamentally important for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] eﬀec�ve 
interven�ons to prevent age- related cogni�ve decline and demen�a - one of the signiﬁcant challenges 
we are facing with the aging popula�on. The rela�vely minor risks, associated with the poten�al beneﬁts 
to the individuals and society in general reﬂect a favorable risk/beneﬁt ra�o.

* 24 -h ABP will be performed during week 2 -10 when clinic BP reaches goal, and during wk 12 or M3 (unless 24 -h ABP 
already reaches goal between wk 2 -10), M6, and 12            
✝ BMP will be performed at wk 2, and prn only when diure�cs, ACEI, or ARB are added to regimen or the 
doses of these drugs are increased.         
** LP will be performed only in subjects who agree to this part of the study               
Baseline Visit Procedures can be done at diﬀerent order with some restric�ons: MRI cannot be fas�ng, must give snacks prior to MRI if paired with fas�ng blood draw

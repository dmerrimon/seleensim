RESEARCH STRATEGY  
1.1. Research Design:  
1.1.1.  Study Design:  
This is a proposal for the Phase II portion of our  unblinded Phase I/II trial1,2. It is a safety , feasibility  
and dose f inding study of AS for the treatment of RDS in spontaneously breathing PT neonates receiving NIV . 
To remove selection bias and control temporal trends, i nfants will be  randomiz ed to 4 parallel fixed dosing 
schedule  groups1,2. This Phase II study will identify 1 or 2 optimal doses,  and provide additional data for safety , 
feasibility and early indication of efficacy that will be the basis for designing a definitive Phase III trial.  Optimal 
dose(s) will be identified based on evidence of a significant positive trend with increasing dose, even if no two 
groups are significantly different3,4. Equitable representation of GAs  within each dose group  will be achieved by 
[CONTACT_39512]. Equitable representation of two FDA -approved  nebulizers  will be achieved by [CONTACT_659019] [ADDRESS_889094] efficacy  but may influence caregiver

Study procedures are described below and their time frame is summarized in Table 9 ; greater detail is 
provided in  the draft s of the standard operating procedures  (Appendix VII)  and study forms (Appendix  VIII).  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Ascertainment of Study Eligibility:  
Research staff will screen  admission database s at HWH and CHM NICU for  infants 240/7 to 366/7 weeks  
GA admitted at ≤ 24 hours of age for study eligibility and maintain a screening log. Informed parental consent 
will be sought  for study participation of potentially eligible infants after a member of the clinical team obtains 
permission for research staff to approach the parent(s) (Appendix V) . To minimize treatment delays, attempt s 
will be made to obtain  consent antenatal ly or soon after admission . Once the clinical team initiates NIV in  a 
potentially eligible infant , the research team will determine that all inclusion criteria have been met, none of 
the exclusion criteria are present  and fill out an Eligibility form . The infant will be assigned the next available 
pre-printed randomization number from the r andomization log for the appropriate GA stratum . Research staff 
will determine the treatment assignment corresponding to the randomization number by [CONTACT_659020] 24/7 . As confirmation of  randomization, an order form documenting the 
randomization will be placed in the infant’s electronic medical record  (Appendix VII [Study Flow, Table A1]) .  
Diagnosis of RDS will be based on5 (i) presence of at least two of four classic symptoms  (need of 
supplemental O2, tachypnea, intercostal retractions or grunting ), and (ii) exclusion of other causes of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399] , and (iii) Clinical team  plan to administer surfactant if infant requires intubation . A chest x -
ray (CXR) is not mandatory prior to enrollment; however, if obtained clinically, severity of RDS will be graded 
and results recorded  (Appendix VII [ Table A 4])6. We have not mandated a radiologic diagnosis of RDS  because 
classic radiologic findi ngs may evolve over the first 12 -24 hours  and be modified by [CONTACT_659021] ; furthermore,  the 
need for a CXR may unnecessarily delay study intervention7,8.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Timing of Aerosolized Surfactant:  
Enrolled infants will receive AS at ≤24 hours of age & within [ADDRESS_889096] shown that earlier administration of surfactant to PT babies with RDS improves outcomes .   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Study Intervention – Aerosolized Surfactant Preparati on and Dose:  
For this study, Survanta ([ADDRESS_889097]/8 ml) (Beractant, Abbvie Inc. ) will be used  at two doses – 100 
mg/kg and 200 mg/kg and two dilutions  (1:1 and 1:2 ) resulting in 4 dose  schedule  groups .  
Survanta has been chosen as the surfactant for this study as this is the surfactant  used exclusively at our 
institution ; it is  also the most commonly used surfactant with the longest duration of use in the US9,10. We will 
validate aerosolized use of other surfactants in subsequent studies.  Many studies have compared Survanta 
with other animal derived surfactants, however, consensus regarding the best preparation  has yet to be 
determined10. Although several  relativel y small randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) showed significant 
reductions in mortality and need for redosing with high -dose (200 mg/kg) but not low -dose (100 mg/kg) 
poractant alfa vs. beractant  (100 mg/kg)11,12; three large recent retrospective cohort studies of surfactant use in 
the US (n=51,282 and 14,173) and Australia (n=515) published in [ADDRESS_889098] indicated that with  surfactant  instilla tion a minimum of 19 mg lipid/kg natural 
surfactant was required to improve gas exchange and 53 mg lipid/kg  resulted in greater improve ment in  
pressure -volume curves in PT lambs15. Consequently, an empi[INVESTIGATOR_658969] 50 mg/kg has been accepted as the 
minimal amount of surfa ctant required to effectively treat neonates with RDS  although most centers use 100 
mg/kg16, a dose that ex ceeds ten -fold the amount necessary to establish a monolayer. On the other hand, 
pharmacokinetic and clinical data suggest that [ADDRESS_889099]/kg of instilled surfac tant has a longer half -life and a 
better acute response compared to 100 mg/kg17,18. Therefo re both these doses will be tested in this Phase I/II 
trial.  Several investigators have shown that even quite low amounts of inhaled surfactant might be more 
effective in improving gas exchange than large amounts of instilled substance19-23.  
Initial reports evaluating aerosolized surfactant in lung injury demonstrated significant improvements 
in oxygenation with as little as 0.5 -2 mg/kg surfactant deposited in lung tissue19. This is lower than the 
endogenous surfactant pool size of 3 -4 mg/kg that is required to increase compliance in PT rabbits24 and is 
comparable to the theoretical dose of 3 mg/kg that would be  necessary to form a monomolecular film on the 
alveolar surface25,26. As surfactant delivery techniqu es have improved, the deposition efficiency has increased. 
In one study, 31% of the total quantity of surfactant aerosolized into the system was deposited in lung tissue Feasibility:     x      
  CRIB -Clinical Risk Index for Babies ;   RD – respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506]; D7 = 7 days, D14 = 14 days, D28 = 28 days  
representing a lung dose of 4.5 mg lipid/kg27. Furthermore, a dose -response relationship existed for AS in this 
model. There is in vitro evidence that even with lower alveolar delivery with aerosolized as compared to 
instilled surfactant, surfactant retains its anti -inflammatory properties and actually decreases leukocyte 
infiltration in the alveolus and the interstitium and improves oxygen ation28. Our Preliminary data and reports 
in literature suggest that diluted surfactant solutions a re most favorable for aerosolisation  (Section 3.4.1  & 
3.4.2 )19,29-32. 
Based on the above, we will evaluate two doses and dilutions of Survanta : 
1. Dosing Schedule I:  Survanta 4 ml (or [ADDRESS_889100])/kg + equal volume of NS  
2. Dosing Schedule II:  Survanta 4 ml (or [ADDRESS_889101])/kg + 2x volume of NS  
3. Dosing Schedul e III:  Survanta 8 ml (or [ADDRESS_889102])/kg + equal volume of NS  
4. Dosing Schedule IV:  Survanta 8 ml (or [ADDRESS_889103])/kg + 2x volume of NS  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Administration of Aerosolized Survanta:  
a) Aerosol Generating Device :  
Our goal is to study safety and feasibility of AS ; optimal dose and dilution; and to get an estimate of 
efficacy of AS using existing modes of NIV  and aerosol delivery. We do not mandate the mode /manufacturer  of 
NIV or the aerosol generating device used in the study  as there is no evidence of significant  differences in 
outcomes among various commercial devices  approved for use in infants ; we will record the mode of NIV  and 
nebulizer type  to be able to evaluate  safety, feasibility and  associations with response. The MH jet and VM 
nebulizer s are FDA -approve d for use in infants, and have been shown to be efficacious in delivery of AS ; this is 
supported by [CONTACT_77886]. The op erating characteristics of the  nebulizers are different – the VM 
nebulizer puts out more aerosol in a shorter period of time  which may result in a quicker response and may be 
better tolerated by [CONTACT_659022];  however this may be associated with increased 
condensation in the NIV circuit and deliver y of only part of the surfactant  placed in the reservoir.  In addition 
the VM nebulizer has a tendency to stop because of clogging of pores by [CONTACT_659023]. This can be 
remedied  by [CONTACT_53737][INVESTIGATOR_658970] . In contrast to the VM nebulizer, the MH jet  
nebulizes the surfactant placed in the nebulizer slowly, resulting in a lower output compared to the VM 
nebulizer; less condensation in NIV circuit and a more prolonged period of aer osol delivery . This may lead to 
slower onset of action and also  impact its ac ceptance by [CONTACT_659024][INVESTIGATOR_46175].        
b) Non -Invasive Ventilator Circuit:  
Non -invasive respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413], defined as any form of respi[INVESTIGATOR_658971], will include NCPAP, NIPPV, and HFNC  for this study . Studies have shown that the 
commercial system of delivering NIV is of little importance, short binasal prongs are a better interface than 
single longer prongs, and that there is  no difference between NIPPV or HFNC compared to CPAP  7,33-41. 
Although four small RCTs (n = 41 to 64) have reported consistent superiority of NIPPV compared with 
NCPAP in reducing re-intubation  rates after extubation  in PT infants , these findings did not correlate with 
improvements in long term respi[INVESTIGATOR_658972]42-46 and are not substantiated by [CONTACT_659025]33,39. When used as  the primary mode of respi[INVESTIGATOR_658973] (24-34 weeks GA) infant s with RDS , 
two small RCTs (n=76 & 84) showed lower intubation rates with NIPPV compared to NCPAP whereas  two 
other RCTs (n=40 & 200) showed no difference in re -intubation rates ; three o f the se four RCTs showed no 
difference in rates of BPD and/or death46-50. In the recently published , largest RCT (n=1009) comparing NIPPV 
with NCPAP in PT neonates <[ADDRESS_889104] pressures generated51. Recently it has been shown that pharyngeal pres sures generated by [CONTACT_659026] 2.2 to 4.9 cmH2O  at flow rates of 2 -8 LPM with an increase of 0.4 -
0.5 cmH2O for each LPM flow (r2=0.97 -0.99)52. Moreover , four  recent studies have  shown comparability of 
efficacy of HFNC and NCPAP /NIPPV  in PT neonates  with the potential of reduced nasal trauma  with 
HFNC34,36,38,40,53. In two RCTs , compared to NCPAP, HFNC used for  post -extubation respi[INVESTIGATOR_658974] <32 weeks GA  (n=132  & 303 ) resulted in  similar rates of extubation failure with significantly reduced 
nasal trauma scores36,40,53. Another smaller RCT  (n=49) reported that HFNC is as effective as NIPPV in 
preventing intubation  in PT neonates <[ADDRESS_889105] (n=432) demonstrated similar efficacy and safety of HFNC as NCPAP  when applied immediately post -
extubation or early as initial NIV  support in neonates 28 weeks GA34. 
At our institution, as demonstrated  by [CONTACT_659027]  (Section 3.4.5) , NIPPV and NCPAP are the 
modes of NIV used for primary respi[INVESTIGATOR_658975]  32 weeks GA ; and NCPAP and HFNC as 
primary modes of respi[INVESTIGATOR_658976] >32 weeks GA. A common ventilator circuit is used for 
NIPPV and NCPAP with short binasal prongs as the patient interface  (INCA). For HFNC, the Fisher & Paykel 
heated humidified syst em is used with short binasal prongs.    
The neonatal ventilator circuit will have heated and humidified gas flow a s is standard of clinical care. 
The MiniHeart Lo-Flo jet nebulizer (WestMed ) will be placed in the inspi[INVESTIGATOR_658977] t 
close to the patient interface wherever there is a natural break in the circuit. The gas flow in the nebulizer will 
be 2LPM and will have the same FiO2 as the NIV  circuit. The output of this nebulizer is 8 ml/hr at a flow rate 
of 2 LPM. After the flow f rom the nebulizer is introduced, the ventilator parameters and or gas flow through 
the ventilator will be adjusted to keep pressures constant. Every attempt will be made not to change ventilator 
settings during nebulization unless patient’s well -being mandates it. The AeroNeb Solo nebulizer (Aerogen ) 
will be placed in the ventilator circuit close to the patient interface wherever there is a natural break . Although 
in pediatric a nd adult  MV, vibrating mesh nebulizer placement  proximal to the humidifier was associated with 
increase d aerosol delivery54, during NIV in pediatric and infant models, aerosol delivery was greater  if the 
nebulizer device was placed closer to the patient interface55,56.  
Surfactant dose determined from  the Dosing Schedule Table (Appendix I V) will be diluted with saline, 
mixed by a gentle swirling motion and placed in the nebulizer chamber  and a erosolize d till the nebulizer runs 
dry. If the volume is in excess of the capacity of the nebulizer reservoir, the reservoir will be replenished as the 
level of medication drops in the reservoir by [CONTACT_659028] a syringe pump to deliver the 
dose depending upon availability. Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_658978] a lower level tha n the nasal 
prongs to prevent reflux  of condensed fluid from these tubes into the nasal prongs30,57. 
c)  Patient Interface:  
Only  short binasal prongs will be used for aerosol delivery in the NIV circuit. Since the ventilator circuit 
for NCPAP and NIPPV is identical, only one type of neonatal nasal  prongs  (INCA) will be used. For the HFNC 
circuit, onl y the neonatal F isher & Paykel  short binasal prongs will be  used. Nasal cannulas will be applied with 
recommendations that the prong outer diameter occupy ~50% o f the nares internal diameter  to allow free 
egress of flow around the cannula34.  
d) Number of doses of Aerosolized Surfactant  & Intervals between Doses :  
Infants will be eligible to receive a 2nd dose of AS [ADDRESS_889106] dose of AS if there is continued 
need for NIV with FiO2 25% or PEEP  4 cmH20 or HFNC rate  [ADDRESS_889107] PT infants with RDS receive [ADDRESS_889108] if the infant meets criteria.  
e) Duration of nebulization:  
Time to nebulize each dose will depend upon volume of diluted surfactant, type of nebulizer, and 
ambient humidity and temperature . It is expected that for each dose nebulization will be <[ADDRESS_889109] infants and <4-[ADDRESS_889110] infants. Th is Phase II study will provi de critical  information 
regarding time for nebulization of various doses for PT babies and will be crucial  in determining tolera nce of 
intervention both by [CONTACT_659029]. This will be one factor  in selecting the optimal 
dose and dilution of AS for the definitive Phase III trial.         
[IP_ADDRESS].  Gestational Age Group Strata:  
Enrolled infants will be strati fied by [CONTACT_659030] ( 240/7-286/7; 290/7 - 326/7, 330/7 - 366/7) because need for 
intubation and MV has been reported to be higher in more immature infants along with higher co -morbidities 
of prematurity and mortality. Infants <[ADDRESS_889111] are likely to receive intubation. 59,60 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Randomization Procedures: Assignment to Surfactant dosing schedule:  
An a priori  computer -generated stratified block randomization  list will be used to assign patients to 
each of the 4 parallel fixed dosing schedules  (allocation ratio 1:1:1:1, total subjects = 120) . To ensure 
randomization of equal number of subjects to both nebulizers, block size of [ADDRESS_889112] to known or unknown confounding baseline variables, 
remove selection bias and control temporal trends2,62-66. The balance resulting from blocked stratification can 
improve the power of trials by [CONTACT_659031] , reduce Type I and II error rates, increase  
efficiency, and improve subgroup analyses . 
  The structure of Table 1 0 shows 
breakdown of the sample by [CONTACT_659032] ( GA [stratifying  factor ] & 
nebulizer type [blocking  factor ]) with columns 
represent ing treatment groups. Therneau showed 
that balance in covariates begins to fail when the 
number of blocks approaches half the sample size 
(n/2)64,67. Therefore studies using stratified 
assignment should not attempt to balance on 
more than [ADDRESS_889113] balance d 2 important factors (GA, nebulizer type); 
the resulting number of blocks (3 GA strata x 2 nebulizers x 4 dosing schedule groups =24) is <n/2  (120/2=60 ).  
Multiple births, common in this premature population, will be randomized independently  and not as a un it as 
the latter can lead to bias in the randomization process . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Allocation Concealment:  
The randomization list with treatment assignments corresponding to randomization numbers will be 
generated by [CONTACT_659033] s. The research 
pharmacist , also not involved in screening or enrollment, will receive the list and keep it concealed.  For each 
infant  enrolled, the research staff will obtain the treatment assignment corresponding to the infant’s  
randomization number from the research pharmacist by  [CONTACT_659034]68.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Blinding:  
All enrolled infants will receive active medication; only the research staff and pharmacist will be aware 
of the infants’ assigned group. Study medication will be reconstituted by [CONTACT_445885] a designated private 
space in the NICU. The clinical caregivers and subjects will be blinded to dose and dilution, a lthough an 
experienced clinical caregiver may be able to guess the dose and dilution. Research staff monitoring the 
enrolled infants during study intervention will collect objective data thus minimizing bias. It is not possible to 
blind nebulizers as they are of very different configurations  and c overing them will interfere with monitoring 
during clinical  care. Infants will remain on their allocated nebulizer device for the duration of the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Clinical Care of Enrolled Infants:  
The attending neonatologi st and clinical team will make all decisions for initiation of NIV support and 
need for intubation and/or intratracheal surfactant instillation. Consensus guidelines have been agreed upon 
by [CONTACT_659035]7,33,34,69-74.  
Suggested initial and maximum settings for NIV support  are provided although clinicians may  
individualize care  (Table 1 1)33,34,74. Escalation of NIV will be recommended for increasing FiO2  (>10% from 
baseline) , partial pressure of CO2 (PCO2, >10 mmHg from baseline) , or clinical respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506] . Weaning 
will be recommended for SpO2 and PCO2 maintained at 90 -95% and <65 mmHg respectively for 4 hours in the 
absence of significant clinical signs of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506]34.

In our unit, infants  32 weeks GA with RDS being treated with  NIV receive  caffeine  shortly af ter 
starting NIV as recommended/reported in the literature7,74. Enrolled infants will receive the 1st dose of caffeine 
prior to study intervention as standard clinical care  in this study .  This will prevent confounding of assessment 
of efficacy of study intervention both within and between subjects by [CONTACT_659036]. Caffeine therapy will 
consist of an i ntravenous loading dose of 20 mg/kg caffeine citrate/kg body weight followed by a daily 
maintenance dose of 5 mg/kg; duration of treatment will be determined by [CONTACT_6098].  
Recommended criteria for intubation  will be same as defined under Exit criteria (Section 3.6. 5). If in 
an enrolled infant respi[INVESTIGATOR_658979], the infant will exit the study and rescue therapy w ill be instituted immediately. 
Recommended criteria for adjustments to v entilator settings on conventional and high frequency ventilation 
include maintaining PaO2 50 to 70 mmHg, or oxygen saturation 90% - 95%, and PaCO2 <[ADDRESS_889114] dose of intratracheal surfactant if other clinical criteria are met75. Criteria for 
subseque nt clinical intratracheal surfactant doses  (drawn from a clinical stock of Survanta) will include need 
for MV with FiO2 >0.[ADDRESS_889115] pressure >7 cm H2O for 20 min at [ADDRESS_889116] dose69,76.  
It will be recommended that extubation be attempted  within 24 hours after the infant meets all of the 
following criteria: PaCO 2 <65 mm Hg, pH >7.20, SpO 2 90-95% with an FiO2 < 0.50, mean airway pressure 
<10 cm of water, ventilator rate < [ADDRESS_889117] radiogra ph (CXR ) as standard 
clinical care ; a CXR is not mandatory prior to enrollment  for this study. Echocardiography  and c ranial 
sonography, will be performed at the discretion of the clinical team based  on infants GA and clinical status.  
For PT infants  with RDS to have the best outcome it is essential that they have optimal supportive care , 
including  delivery room care, maintenance of normal body temperature, proper fluid management, nutritional 
support , circulat ory support to maintain blood pressure & tissue perfusion , and skin -to-skin contact [CONTACT_659037]7. Clinical  protocols in place for the care of preterm infants  in our unit will be followed.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Monitoring During & After Aerosol Administration:  
Every attempt will be made to administer AS with  the infant in stable condition, with heart rate >120 
bpm, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) >85%. Prior to or concurrent with enrollment, capi[INVESTIGATOR_1396]/arterial blood gas 
(CBG/ABG) analysis , vital signs including pulse oximetry (SpO2) , respi[INVESTIGATOR_658980] & receipt of medication s 
such as caffeine, pressors or sedation  will be recorded . Newborn r espi[INVESTIGATOR_658981] e used in the Acute 
Care of At -Risk Newborns ( ACoRN ) program ( adapted from Downes ) will be used to objectively evaluate 
changes in respi[INVESTIGATOR_658982]77,78 (Appendix  VII [Table A 5])). Severity of illness will 
be determined using the CRIB (Clinical Risk Index for Babies) score79,80 (Appendix  VII [Table A 6])).  
 Adverse events  (AEs) during study aerosol administration will be recorded including: desaturations, 
apnea, bradycardia, tachycardia, air leaks, need for resuscitation, occurrence of coughing/gagging, surfactant 
reflux from the nose/mouth, need for positive pressure inflations, residual surfactant in nasal prongs or 
nebulizer chamber, and raino ut in the ventilator tubing  (Appendix VII [Tables A 8-A9]). We will take pi[INVESTIGATOR_658983] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_290036] – but this will not be mandatory. 
60 ±30 minutes after end of nebulization, a CBG/ABG will be o btained and SpO2 values noted. It will be 
requested that clinical team make no changes to respi[INVESTIGATOR_658984]/ABG 
60±30 minutes after end of nebulization has been obtained. However, if for patient well -being these cha nges 
are deemed necessary during this time by [CONTACT_6098], a note will be made in the research records.  
 Nasal trauma  will be scored prior to AS, at end of AS and at 24 hours after AS53,81 (Appendix VII [Table 
A7]). At each time point, t he nasal prongs  will be  briefly slid out of the nares and scores assigned for redness, 
bleeding, ulceration, or skin breakdown  (Nasal Trauma Score) by [CONTACT_3647] . In addition at the conclusion 
of the study intervention, the bedside nurse and respi[INVESTIGATOR_658985] a Feasibility  Questionnaire  
to determine impact of study intervention on clinical care ( Appendix VIII ).   
     Ventilator parameters and vita l signs  will be monitored  every 15 min during administration of aerosol,

aerosol. CBG/ABGs  are generally followed every [ADDRESS_889118]

transfusions ); morbidities ; outcomes at discharge ; and laboratory and imaging results.    
[IP_ADDRESS].  Cerebral Ox imetry  Using Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS):  
Participation in this part of the research protocol will be mandatory. Cerebral oxygen saturation (RCO2) 
will be monitored before, during and after administration of AS using NIRS . Monitoring will be started once 
consent is obtained and will continue for [ADDRESS_889119] dose of AS. RCO2 reflects oxygen saturation 
in veins (70 –80%), capi[INVESTIGATOR_11037] (5%) and arteries (15 –25%), and can be used as a surrogate for oxygen 
saturation in jugular venous blood82,83. A near infrared spectrometer (Covidien ) will be used. A neonatal 
transducer, containing a light -emitting diode and two distant sensors, will be placed on the forehead in the 
midline. RCO2  will be calculated from differential signals obtained from the two sensors, expressed as the 
venous -weig hted percentage of oxygenated hemoglobin (oxygenated hemoglobin/total h emoglobin)84. To 
investigate the balance between O2 delivery and consumption, relative cerebral fractional tissue oxygen 
extraction  (cFTOE ) will be calculated as: (SaO2 - RCO2)/SaO2  where Sa O2=arterial oxygen saturation85. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Gastric Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_658987] -MS: 
Parent (s) will be given an option for their infant’s participation in this part of the study involving 
assessment of surfactant activity at baseline and end of AS in gastric aspi[INVESTIGATOR_26594] . Surfactant activity will 
be determined by [CONTACT_659038] -MS at the Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_658988]  (Support letter 
from [CONTACT_659053], Director Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_658989]) . Baseline values will help us predict if an infant will 
respond to AS and levels after AS will help to assess  efficacy of delivery and response to AS. 
Gastric aspi[INVESTIGATOR_658990] e ligible  infants prior to starting AS and at the end of AS using a

assigned coded labels , frozen at –20C and transported to the Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_658992] .  
1.1.5.  Historical Controls:  
              The Phase I/II Clinical Trial under this protocol does not have a placebo group; all randomized subjects 
receive active treatment. Preterm  infants 24 0/7 - 36 6/7 weeks gestation that were admitted to the Hutzel 
Women's hospi[INVESTIGATOR_658993] (Dec 10, 2014 to Aug 31, 2017) will serve a s historical 
controls to be able to compare intubation rates in infants enrolled and those not enrolled in the study. This will 
also allow comparison of other in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_95209], give an idea of numbers of infants available for the future 
Phase III clini cal trial and the optimal time for admin istering study intervention.  
 
1.1.6.  Exit Criteria/Treatment Failure Criteria:  
  It will be suggested that infants be intubated and receive MV if they met 2 or more of 5 failure criteria:   
i). worsening clinical signs of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506] (increasing tachypnea; expi[INVESTIGATOR_658994]; intercostal, 
subcostal, and/or sternal recession);  
ii). apnea treated with positive pressure ventilation (PPV) by [CONTACT_659039] 2 or more occasions in 1 hour;  
iii). FIO2 >0.5 to maintain pulse oxygen saturati ons 90%-95% for >30 minutes;  
iv). pH <7.2 on 2 arterial or capi[INVESTIGATOR_658995] >30 minutes apart; and  
v). partial pressure of CO2 (PCO2) of >65 mm Hg on 2 CBG/ABGs taken 30 minutes apart.  
1.1.7.  Primary outcome : 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Safety:  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_659040], apnea, bradycardia /tachycardia , 
hypotension, air leaks, need for resuscitation, nasal trauma score , agitation, blockage of nasal prongs or NIV 
circuit,  and cerebral oxygen saturation prior to, during and after study drug administration  (Adverse Event 
[AE] Monitoring Form, Appendix  VII [Table A 8, A9]). Other safety measures that will be monitored include  
increased secretions requiring suctioning, coughing/gagging, surfactant reflux from nose/mouth, rainout in 
ventilator tubing, dislodged nasal prongs, abdominal distension, and nebulizer malfunction. It is expected that 
need for intubation is likley to be higher in the lower GA group strata.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Feasibility : 
We define feasibility for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_658996]: 
i). Safely deliver AS to PT infant s with RDS without interrupting clinical care because of clogged nasal 
prongs or  ventilator alarms related to inline nebulization . At the end of AS a  Feasibility Questionnaire 
will be administered to bedside nurses & respi[INVESTIGATOR_658997] (A ppendix  VIII). 
ii). Secure cooperation of clinical bedside nurses and respi[INVESTIGATOR_658998].  
iii). Identify  and randomize a sufficient number of patients within a reasonable study  period.  This includes 
ability to identify eligible infants, obtain informed consent, and prepare  and deliver aerosolized stu dy 
medication in the defined time frame.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Dose Finding:  
We will randomize infants to receive one of 4 fixed dosing sc hedules . Data collected during this Phase 
I/II trial will be critical in selecting the optimal dosing schedule for the definitive Phase III trial. Optimal 
dosing schedule will be determined by [CONTACT_659041], lack of adverse effects, and tolerance by 
[CONTACT_659042].   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Efficacy : 
The primary efficacy outcome for this Phase I/II trial is the need for n eed for intubation  and MV within 
72 hours of study intervention  (treatment failure) . This will be compared to a historical control rate of 0.5 for 
need for intubation in PT infants 24 -36 weeks GA undergoing NIV.  Treatment failure criteria are defined a 
priori  in Section 3.6.5. We chose treatment failure within 72 hours of randomization as our primary efficacy 
outcome  as failure within that time would likely be due to RDS, whereas failure after this time would more  
likely be due to secondary causes like sepsis, PDA, pneumonia, NEC , IVH, or apnea of prematurity .  
1.1.8.  Secondary Efficacy Outcomes:  
1. CBG/ABG, pulse oximetry , vital signs at 60±30 minutes after end of AS 
2. Number of doses of surfactant – aerosolized & intratracheal  
3. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_158728] 24, 48 & 72 hours , 7 days  (D7) , D14, D28 , 36 weeks corrected GA and Discharge .  
4. Pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum or other air leak  
5. Changes in cerebral oxygenation as evaluate d by [CONTACT_160087]   
6. Changes in surfactant activity in gastric aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026]  
7. Cumulative duration of NIV and invasive ventilation on D3, D7, D14, D28, 36 weeks CGA and discharge  
8. Duration of supplemental oxygen, intensive care, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
9. Age at  start of feeds, feeding progression , age at full  enteral feeds  
10. Need for blood  transfusions  
11. Growth parameters at 7 days, 28 days, 36 weeks corrected GA and discharge  
12. Morbidities associated with prematurity: PDA, IVH  (Grade III -IV), NEC, periventricular leukomalacia, 
ventriculomegaly, ROP  (stage>3 or requiring treatment) , and BPD. Two definitions of BPD will be used:  
a) Physiological definition: receipt of > 30% supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks or the need for 
positive -pressure support or, in the case of infants requiring < 30% oxygen, the need for any 
supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks after an attempt at withdrawal of oxygen86.  
b) Receipt of any supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks.   
13. Survival to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]   
14. Survival to discharge without severe morbidity, defined as any of the following: BPD , late onset sepsi s, 
ROP , or serious brain abnormality ( IVH , periventricular leuk omalacia, or ventriculomegaly)   
1.1.9.  Monitoring for Adverse E vents (AEs) : 
Adverse events (AEs) that will be monitored during the study  and a  toxicity grading scale for potentially 
serious and life -threatening AEs is defined in Appendix  VII [Table s A8, A9]87.   
1. Plugging of nasal prongs , increased secretions requiring suctioning , occurrence of coughing/gagging, 
surfactant reflux from the nose/mouth, residual surfactant in nasal prongs or ne bulizer chamber, 
rainout in ventilator tubing , dislodged prongs, abdominal distension , and agitation   
2. Nebulizer malfunction – clogge d, no visible mist, disconnected ventilator tubing  
3. Bradycardia , tachycardia  or hypotension  requiring treatment during  or within 6 hours after study 
intervention  
4. Desaturations and/or a pnea during or within 6 hours after study intervention  
5. Need for resuscitation  (positive pressure ventilation , chest compression or cardiac medications ) during 
or within 6 hours after intervention  
6. Air leak (p neumothorax, pneumomediastinum) during or within 6 hours after study intervention  
7. Nasal trauma score  (Appendix VII [Table A4]) before  AS, at end of AS and 24 hours after end of AS  
8. Death  
1.1.10.  Sample Size:  
In this safety, feasibility and dose finding Phase II  trial , 30 infants will be assigned to each of the 4 dose 
schedules4,88. The aim of phase II trials is to explore different doses , evaluate safety & tolerability , and obtain 
early indication of efficacy88. The dose -safety relationship is more important than the dose -efficacy one  as 
efficacy is irrelevant if the dose is unsafe89. Phase II trials are generally inadequate with respect to size, 
outcome, precision, and control of bias to provide  formal proof of efficacy3,90. Rather these trials provide 
baseline data , potential primary outcome  and effect size  justifying  the larger, l onger , and more expensive Phase 
III trial . Recognizing that  our Phase II trial is not powered for efficacy, sample size calculations based on 
precision of the estimate of the primary outcome & the null hypothesis and error rate are presented below.   
Sample Size Based on Precision for the Primary Efficacy Outcome:  
The efficacy goal of Phase II studies is typi[INVESTIGATOR_658999] a clinical endpoint with a specified precision. 
The primary efficacy outcome in this study is the need for intubation & MV within  72 hours of AS. Using the 
normal approximation to the binomial as described by [CONTACT_25715][INVESTIGATOR_37341]88 (𝑤=𝑍𝛼×√𝑝(1−𝑝)/𝑛; or more simply 
n=1/w2 for estimated proportions  (p) ranging from 0.2 to 0.8, where Z is the quantile from the normal 
distribution corresponding to the two -sided probability,  n=sample size, w=width of the 95% confidence 
interval  [CI] or precision ), a sample size of 30 per dos ing schedule  group will allow evaluat ion of  a failure rate 
of 0.25 - 0.4 with 95% CI of ±0. 15 to ±0.17 (15 to 17 % precision)  (Table 12) . The precision of this estimate is 
increased i f we collapse the dilution groups corresponding to dose of 100 mg/kg & 200 mg/kg  (<12%) or 
consider our entire sample  of 120 subjects all of whom receive the study intervention (<9%).

Sample Size Based on the Null Hypothesis & Error Rates : 
We will also compare the primary efficacy outcome to that of historical controls.  The eligibility cri teria, 
baseline factors , clinical management protocols, criteria for NIV and MV, & outcomes in our study are similar 
to those of recently published clinical trials. The  use of historic controls will decrease sample size, shorte n 
duration, and enhance efficiency of our Phase II study ; definitely an advantage for testing four dosing regimens 
in this orphan population1,90-94. Additionally , since AS has been shown to be potentially beneficial, this will 
allow all patients to receive study medication early and non-invasively thus enhancing study feasibility.  
 The rate of intubation following NIV for RDS among 24 -36 weeks GA PT infants is ~50%75,95. We 
estimated  a 50 % relative risk reduction  to be clinically significant and plausible based on our preliminary data 
& reports in literature. Studies of MIST during NIV in PT infants 24 - 36 weeks GA with RDS  show an absolute 
risk reduction of the need for MV of 10 -50% and a relative risk reduction of 21 -63% (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.57, 
0.79) with a lower treatment threshold (FiO2 0.45) conferring a greater advantage (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.59, 
0.87) compared to a higher threshold (FiO2>0.45) (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.40, 0.77)5,33,75,92,93,95-104. 
A sample size of [ADDRESS_889120] 81.8% power to detect a relative 
risk reduction of 50% (absolute risk reduction 25%) in the primary outcome of the need for intubation in 72 
hours compared to a historical control value of 0.5 in a two -tailed type I error rate of 0.05  (Table 13) . 
Collapsing dilution groups corresponding to dose of 100 mg/kg & 200 mg/kg or considering our entire sample 
of [ADDRESS_889121] si ze with greater power .  
An alternative strategy  for sample size of Pha se II trials  is to reduce the level of rigor required by 
[CONTACT_659043] I error rate  to as large as 25%90,105. This increases the risk of erroneously concluding  that 
the treatment is worthy  of further investigation  but does not increase the risk of missing an efficacious  
treatment.  This approach would allow us to evaluate the effect sizes in Table [ADDRESS_889122] GA stratum. The data monitoring committee (DMC) recommended:  
a. Re-distribution of sample size for the study (n=120) between  the two higher GA strata (60 infants per 
stratum compared to previous sample size of 40 infants per stratum). This will allow retention of power of 
the sample size calculations in the original proposal for analysis in the margins.  
 
b. Aim to enroll addition al [ADDRESS_889123] (maximum 40)  patients in the lowest GA stratum to address 
feasibility of study intervention in this group and generate hypothesis for effect size estimate for efficacy in 
this stratum.  
 
On July 21, 2016, we submitted a clarification amen dment to the IRB requesting continued enrollment in 
Stratum I upto a maximum of 40 subjects as originally proposed till the enrollment targets for the higher two 
GA strata were met (approved 07 -29-2016). This was based on our enrollment patterns, making it  seem 
unlikely that we would reach our enrollment targets ahead of the timeline (30 -36 months for study accrual) in 
the three GA strata.  
         
In Dec 2016, we attained accrual goals for the two higher GA strata. We observed a change in enrollment 
patterns in the last [ADDRESS_889124] likely to benefit from this 
intervention , having as much data as possible about feasibility and efficacy in this GA group will be valuable in 
designing the future definitive Phase III randomized controlled trial.  
 
        This amendment was discussed with the FDA grant officer who recommended (02 -17-2017) proceeding 
with amendment submission to IRB and IND review Division if the DMC concurs.  
 
        The DMC met on [ADDRESS_889125] GA Stratum (I) 
till Dec 2017. In addition, the DMC recommended continuing subject accrual in the two higher GA Strata 
subject to availability of resources; enrollment in excess will increase power and confidence in the results.  
 
        We propos ed increasing the sample size by [ADDRESS_889126] ed that the sample size  for the study be increased by 20 to accommodate for current 
and future screen failures (estimating a maximum of 10 screen failures in the future). These two changes will 
increase the total sample size of the Phase II portion of the study to 220 subjects, and overall sample size of the 
study including the 17 subjects enrolled in the Phase I portion of the study will be 237.

1.1.12.  Statistical Analyses : 
Data will be analyzed  according to the intention -to-treat principle  using SAS and PASW (IBM Inc .). We 
will report descriptive statistics for demographic , clinical  and respi[INVESTIGATOR_659000] 4 dosing schedule groups  (Appendix  IX [Table M1, M2]). In  addition, 
three subgroup analyses are planned – according to dose regardless of dilution (100 vs. 200 mg/kg), GA strata,  
nebulizer device  using  logistic regression incorporating an additional treatment -by-subgroup interaction term .  
  Analysis plan to address Aim #1 – Safety and Feasibility Assessment : Safety will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_659044]/diluti on 
groups and two types of nebulizers . Indicators include cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_659001], blockage of NIV circuit and 
cerebral oxygen  saturation  (Appendix IX [Table M5] ). Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, 
proportion, inter -quarter range [IQR]) will be used  to quantify these indicators; confidence intervals will be 
preferred to hypothesis testing  as considerable imprecision is expected arising from low fre quencies of these 
AEs3. ANOVA  or t-test (continuous measures) and χ2 test (categorical variables)  will be used for comparative 
analyses though we may not find statistically significant differences . Paired t-test will be used to compare heart 
rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressure, SpO2, PCO2, cerebral oxygenation  (RCO2, cFTOE) , ACoRN score and 
nasal exam score before and after AS . These parameters will also be compared between infants who get 
intubated within 72 hours of study intervention and those who do  not; and before and after intubation within 
subjects that get intubated . Feasibility will be assessed by [CONTACT_659045] s and respi[INVESTIGATOR_105489] s on the 
feasibility questionnaire  (Appendix  IX [Table M6] ). Because of the high inherent variability of these factors and 
small  effect sizes, we do not expect to show significant  differences between groups given our sample size. 
However this information will be useful in making the final decision to proceed with a Phase III RCT.  
Analy sis plan to address Aim #2: - Determination of Optimal Dilution and Dosage of AS:  The 
optimum dose is one that produces low toxicity w hile nearly maximizing the biological response89. The optimal 
dosage will be determined by [CONTACT_659046] , feasibility items  and primary and 
secondary efficacy treatment outcomes ( rates of intubation,  diagnosis of PDA, need for blood transfusions, 
postnatal growth, duration of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413], length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], and incidence of complications of 
prematurity including IVH, sepsis, pneumonia, BPD,  NEC , ROP , and death ) across the four dosing sche dules  
(Appendix IX , Mock Tables ). The optimal dosage/dilution will be the one with the minimum level of adverse 
responses and highest clinical treatment outcomes.   
Analysis plan to address Aim #3 - Short -term efficacy of AS : The primary outcome variable for short -
term efficacy is the n eed for intubation & MV within 72 hours of AS. We will estimate the unconditional 
probability of benefit for the four dosing schedule groups (I, II, III, IV), the 2 dose groups (100 vs. 200 mg/kg) 
and the entire study cohort of 120 subjects . We will also compar e with reported rates of intubation in historical 
controls (50%) . A special χ2 test to compare sample proportion with population proportion will be conducted to 
test the study hyp othesis that AS is ef ficacious. In the comparison analysis, different dosages/dilutions will also 
be considered as weight using the “optimal” dosage/dilution obtained from Aim #2 as reference. A significantly 
lower rate of intubation in infants  treated with AS  in this study as compared to the reported rate of ~0.5 at 
p<0.05 level (two -sided) will be used as evidence supporting the efficacy of AS . However, it is likely we may not 
have power to achieve statistically significant results. Nevertheless t hese prelimin ary efficacy data will be 
crucial in determining outcome measures and effect size for  the definitive placebo -controlled  Phase III trial .  
A number of secondary outcomes will be asses sed using the same methodology. Vital signs, SpO2 , FiO2, 
NIV parameters (p ressure, rate, flow) and ABG/CBG components (pH , PO2, PCO2 ) will be evaluated before 
and after study intervention (paired t-test) and over time (Longitudinal data analysis) . Other  secondary 
outcomes include  change in surfactant activity in gastric aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026], changes in cerebral oxygenation, diagnosis 
of PDA, need for blood transfusions, postnatal growth, duration of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413], length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], 
and incidence of complications of prematurity i ncluding IVH, sepsis, NEC , BPD,  pneumonia, ROP ,  and death . 
We will describe and compare primary and secondary outcome data overall and by [CONTACT_659047] , and in 
three pre -planned subgroup analyses – by [CONTACT_659048] (100 mg/kg vs 200 mg/kg), GA group 
stratum and nebulizer type , recognizing that we may observe trends of differences between groups without 
having power to determine statistical s ignificance . We will report dichotomous secondary outcome data as 
proportions and compare the groups using χ2 and nonparametric tests. We will report secondary continuous 
outcome da ta as mean (SD) for normally distributed data and median (interquartile ran ge [IQR]) for skewed 
data , and w ill compare the groups by [CONTACT_659049] ( t-test, ANOVA ) and nonparametric tests (Mann -
Whitney U test, Wilcoxon’s test ) as appropriate. Pairwise group comparisons of the four dosing schedule 
groups will also be performed, although we may lack power to detect significant differences. In a final posthoc 
analysis, we will compare infants who received intubation within 72 hours to those who di d not to understand 
risk factors for intubation and their modification by [CONTACT_62240]. This analysis will be presented for the 
entire group and by [CONTACT_659050] . In adjusted analyses , dosing schedule, GA group , nebulizer type, 
mode of NIV, antenatal steroids, and presence of PDA or IVH will be included as covariates recognizing that 
these analyses are exploratory and need to be interpreted cautiously . We will consider  a p value  of <0.05 for 
statistical signi ficance. Mock tables for the plann ed analyses are presented in  Appendix  IX.  
Recommendations for statistical analyses by [CONTACT_1578]  (DMC)  during the 
conduct of the trial:  
1. Additional factors associated with intubation in enrolled infants – clinical team, time of day/shift, clinical 
variables (e.g. sepsis, NEC)  
2. Performing a survival curve analysis to present timing of intubation in infants who were intubated  
3. Control for mode of ventilation at baseline and exploring a GA cutoff at which this i ntervention may be 
most beneficial.   
4. Detailed caffeine data in relation to AS to be provided  
5. DMC requested data for intubation rates in the three GA strata outside this clinical trial setting (as reported 
in the literature and at Hutzel Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] b y initiating an observational study) as there is no placebo 
group in this analysis  
6. Handling of infants that exited study prior to study intervention   
a. DMC recommended performing a dual level analysis  
i. The primary “intent to treat analysis” should include all  enrolled subjects.  
ii. A secondary “experimental analysis” should also be presented that only includes subjects 
that received study intervention.

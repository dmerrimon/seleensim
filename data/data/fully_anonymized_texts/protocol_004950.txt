Study Design  Prospective study  
Primary Objective  The primary objective of the study is to compare the 
accuracy of manual palpation of surface landmarks versus 
ultrasonography for identification of the appropriate 
interspace for lumbar  puncture and spi[INVESTIGATOR_737024] 1 year of age.  
Secondary 
Objective(s)  The secondary objective is to assess the level of the conus 
medullaris in infants in the sitting and lateral position .

2.0 Objectives  
2.1 The primary objective of the study is to compare the accuracy of manual palpation of surface landmarks versus ultrasonography for identification of the appropriate interspace for lumbar puncture and spi[INVESTIGATOR_737025] 1 year of age.  
2.2 The secondary objective is to assess the level of the conus medullaris in infants in the lateral position and also in the sitting position. 
2.3 The hypothesis is that ultrasonography will be more accurate than the traditional method of palpation of surface landmarks in the identification of the appropriate interspace for lumbar puncture and spi[INVESTIGATOR_737021] 1 year of age. 
3.0 Background   
3.1  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_737026]. The conus medullaris ends at L3- L4 in 
children less than 1 year of age and therefore the L3-4 or L4- 5 interspace is 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Accuracy of manual palpation vs ultrasound for spi[INVESTIGATOR_737022] [ADDRESS_1006912] shown that manual palpation can be inaccurate in up to 30% of cases.

4.0 Study Endpoints   
4.1 The accuracy of manual palpation of surface landmarks for identification of the appropriate interspace ( L3-4/L4-5) for lumbar puncture and spi[INVESTIGATOR_57273].

The research anesthesiologist performing the ultrasound will confirm whether or not the appropriate interspace (L3 -4/L4 -5) has been identified. Also, the 
interspace where the conus medullaris ends will be identified in the sitting position. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_737029].

 Page 4 of 9  HRP -503  v.12.10.18  9.0  Study Timelines*  
• An individual study subject’s participation in the study should last 
approximately 15- 30 minutes total.  
• All study subjects should be enrolled within 1 year of study start. 
• The study should be completed within 2 years of study start.  
10.0 Inclusion  and Exclusion Criteria*  
10.1 Potential subjects will be identified by [CONTACT_737034] -op area prior to their 
surgery.   
10.2 Inclusion criteria:  Patients less than 1 year of age scheduled for spi[INVESTIGATOR_737030], urologic, or lower extremity surgery at Nationwide Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].

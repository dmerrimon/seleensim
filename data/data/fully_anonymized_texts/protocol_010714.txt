IV or Recurrent S quamous  Cell Lung Cancer  (Lung- MAP Sub-Study )” 
  
NCT Number:  03574753

Description:  
S1400 [NCT 02154490] is the parent study to S1400 K [NCT 03574753].  
The S1400 Lung -MAP study is considered one study under one IND consisting of:  
• S1400 Version Control Protocol  
• S1400 Main Screening Protocol Component  
• Multiple Sub- Studies (or sub- protocols) Components  
Each component is contained in its own separate document.   
S140 0K is one of these components.  Each “component” consists of the protocol 
document and its associated informed consent document(s).  Since each screening 
and sub -study component operates independently from the other components contained 
in Lung -MAP, each has its own version date and NCT number . This is due to the complexity 
of the study and how it must be entered into different computer programs.

 METHODOLOGY:  
Overview of Study Design  
RIV-HU6-[ADDRESS_341301] dose that is permissible.  Once qualified, patients will be randomly assigned to one of the HU6 treatment groups or the matched placebo control group and dosed once daily (fasting) for a total of 61 days. Subjects will return to the clinic for frequent assessment visits during the 61 days of dosing as demonstrated in the Schedule of Assessments (Section 8.1). A follow-up visit will occur within 10-14 days following the completion of dosing.  
  Subjects will be instructed to maintain their same diet and activity/exercise level throughout the study as they had prior to participation in the study.  -45 to -3 DaysScreening / Visit 1Dosing Starts Day 1Baseline / Visit 2Placebo QD (n = 20)150 mg QD (n = 20) 300 mg QD (n =20) 450 mg QD (n = 20) Day 61End of TreatmentDay 71 -75Follow up

14  DOSAGE, DOSE FORM, A ND ROUTE OF ADMI NISTRATIO N: 
Study drug will be supplied to the clinic as  bulk capsules  in a polyethylene bag contained in 
high-density polyethylene (HDPE) secondary container. The study drug is prepared by [CONTACT_5925] 
[ADDRESS_341302] during dispensation visits in a ‘pi[INVESTIGATOR_279551]’ with the 
appropriate pharmacy label that will include the subject’s study number. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_279552] a t controlled room temperature, away from direct 
light.   
Bulk matching placebo capsules (each size 00 HPMC capsule containing 150 mg of mannitol)  
will be supplied . The unblinded pharmacist will prepare placebo capsules in the same method 
as for the active s tudy product.  
HU6 will be administered orally  in the fasted state (after a minimum [ADDRESS_341303]) . STATISTICAL METHODS:  
Size and power assumptions  
A sample size of [ADDRESS_341304] 80% power to detect a 30% difference 
in the mean relative change from baseline in liver fat content at Day 61, when the standard 
deviation is 30% [PASS 2020: Two sample t -test, alpha=.05]. Assuming a  15% dropout rate, 
up to [ADDRESS_341305] 68 subjects, 17 per group, are 
evaluable for the primary efficacy endpoint analysis.  
Statistical Methods  
Descriptive statistical methods will be used to summarize the data from this study, with statistical 
testing performed for the efficacy endpoints. Unless stated otherwise, the term “descriptive 
statistics” refers to number of subjects (n), mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and 
maximum for continuous data, and fre quencies and percentages for categorical data. Statistical 
testing, if performed, will be 2 -sided and will be performed using a significance (alpha) level of 
0.05.  There will be no adjustment for multiple comparisons for this exploratory study. All 
availab le data for enrolled subjects will be listed by [CONTACT_1130]. Unless otherwise noted, the data 
will be sorted first by [CONTACT_279585]. All statistical 
analyses will be conducted with the SAS® System, version 9.4 or hi gher.

Other PK parameters may be calculated, as data allow and appropriate.  As data permit, noncompartmental analysis of HU6 parent and metabolites, DNP and M1. The following PK parameters will be calculated: Cmax, AUC, and accumulation.  Modeling of exposure response relationships of HU6, DNP and M1 and efficacy/pharmacodynamic endpoints, as appropriate. 5.2.3 Exploratory Endpoints  Change from baseline in metabolomic and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_279545] (One Way Liver-[OWL] metabolomic and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_279546]) at Day 61.  Change from baseline in proteomic profiles (SomaScan®) at Day 61.  Change from baseline in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) concentrations at Day 61, as data allow. 5.3 Study Design This is a Phase 2a, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, double-blind, repeated-dose study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of three oral dose levels of HU6 compared to placebo over the course of 61 days in subjects with high BMI and evidence of elevated liver fat. Subjects will be screened over a 45 day period to determine their eligibility based on specific history, physical, laboratory and imaging evaluations as per the Schedule of Assessments (Section 8.1). Due to scheduling of the procedures, multiple visits will likely be necessary to complete the screening process. However, if all screening assessments and procedures, including the MRI, can be completed within [ADDRESS_341311] dose, then a single screening visit is permissible (see Section 8.2.1).  Once qualified, patients will be randomly assigned to one of the HU6 treatment groups or the matched placebo control group and dosed once daily (fasting) for a total of 61 days. Subjects will return to the clinic for frequent assessment visits during the 61 days of dosing. A follow-up visit will occur within 10 to 14 days following the completion of dosing (

  Subjects will be instructed to maintain their same diet and activity/exercise level throughout the study as they had prior to participation in the study.  Dosing will take place once daily in a fasted state. Eligible subjects will be randomized equally (N = 20 per group) to 1 of 4 treatment groups:  Group 1: matched placebo orally once daily for 61 days.   Group 2: 150 mg HU6 orally once daily for 61 days.  Group 3: 300 mg HU6 orally once daily for 61 days.   Group 4: 450 mg HU6 orally once daily for 61 days. The randomization will be blocked and stratified by [CONTACT_13505]1c (normal range versus between 5.7% and 9.0% inclusive). 5.[ADDRESS_341312] approximately 120 days (up to [ADDRESS_341313] approximately 5 months: first subject in May [ADDRESS_341314] anticipated being completed in September 2021.  -45 to -3 DaysScreening / Visit 1Dosing Starts Day 1Baseline / Visit 2Placebo QD (n = 20)150 mg QD (n = 20) 300 mg QD (n =20) 450 mg QD (n = 20) Day 61End of TreatmentDay 71 -75Follow up

28  6 STUDY DRUG 6.1 Supply and Storage Study drug will be supplied to the clinic as bulk capsules in a polyethylene bag contained in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) secondary container. The study drug is prepared by [CONTACT_5925] [ADDRESS_341315] during dispensation visits in a ‘pi[INVESTIGATOR_279551]’ with the appropriate pharmacy label that will include the subject’s study number. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_279555], away from direct light.  Bulk matching placebo capsules (each size 00 HPMC capsule containing 150 mg of mannitol) will be supplied. The unblinded pharmacist will prepare placebo capsules in the same method as for the active study product. The unblinded pharmacist will prepare study drug such that the double-blind is maintained.  Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for more information about study drug preparation and dispensing.  6.[ADDRESS_341316].  Study drug will be administered in-clinic during each on-treatment study visit (Visits 2 through 9). Subjects should not take their dose of study drug at home on these mornings. Subjects should present to the clinic in the fasted state. Predose assessments will be conducted, and subjects will be dosed by [CONTACT_279587]-treatment study visits. Subjects will remain fasted (from food and drink other than water) for at least 1-hour postdose. Capsules will be swallowed with approximately 240 mL (8 fluid ounces) of room temperature water.  On all other dosing days, subjects will take their assigned dose of study drug at home in the fasted state (minimum 8-hour fast), and subjects should remain fasted from food until at least 1-hour postdose. Clear liquids are permitted.  Study drug will be dispensed at Study Visits [ADDRESS_341317]. The log will ask for information such as:  Date  Did you take your dose of study drug this morning? (Yes/No)  What is your body temperature?  In the last 24 hours prior to this morning’s dose, did you eat Less/Same/More than you normally do? The purpose of the Daily Log is help ensure and reinforce compliance to subject instructions as a result of the review and discussion with the study coordinator. Individual results are not to be entered into the case record form (CRF). An AE that is identified by [CONTACT_279588] (Section 11.7). 6.2.3 Compliance Subjects will be instructed to bring any used (empty bottles), partially used, or unopened bottles to each study visit. During the study, the clinic staff will monitor adherence by [CONTACT_279589]. Clinic staff will reinforce compliance with study procedures and troubleshoot any problem that may be influencing treatment adherence. Should there be consistently poor compliance with dosing, despi[INVESTIGATOR_279556], there should be a discussion with the medical monitor to determine next steps. 6.3 Packaging and Labeling Study drug will be supplied to the clinic as bulk powder in a polyethylene bag contained in an HDPE container.  The label on the bulk product will contain the following information in the English language:  Protocol number: RIV-HU6-203  Expi[INVESTIGATOR_320]  Lot number   Contents  Weight  Storage conditions  The sentence, Caution: New Drug Limited by [CONTACT_4496] (US) Law to Investigational Use  Name [CONTACT_12166]  Name, address, and telephone number of the Sponsor. 
RIV-HU6-[ADDRESS_341318] is handled and stored safely and properly, and that it is only being given to subjects in accordance with this protocol.  Sites will keep a current log of drug accountability recording:   Study drug supply received from the Sponsor.  Study drug supply dispensed to each subject.  Study drug supply currently in inventory.  Study drug supply destroyed or returned to the Sponsor (or third party) for destruction. Note: Drug accountability is the responsibility of the Investigator; a written account will be required for all discrepancies. The Sponsor’s designated Monitor must verify all accountability records during periodic monitoring visits. Unused and used study drug must be stored on site until such accountability has taken place and authorization is received from the Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee that the study drug may be returned or destroyed. 6.5 Overdose/Toxicity Management No specific pharmacologic antagonist or antidote exists for HU6. Therefore, overdose or clinical toxicity should be managed with supportive care and pharmacologic treatments directed at specific symptoms (i.e. benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_279557].)  Should an overdose occur in the clinic which may impose on the subject significantly higher pharmacologic levels than have previously been studied, the subject (at the discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_279558]) may be more intensively monitoring, including but not limited to continuous telemetry. Should prolongation of QTc interval be seen in excess of [ADDRESS_341319]’s treatment assignment. The investigator will, whenever possible, discuss options with the Medical Monitor, or appropriate Sponsor study personnel before unblinding. If the blind is broken for any reason before the investigator is able to contact [CONTACT_279590], the investigator must notify the Medical Monitor or Sponsor as soon as possible following the unblinding incident without revealing the subject’s study treatment assignment, unless the information is important to the safety of subjects remaining in the study. In addition, the investigator will record the date, time and reason for revealing the blinded treatment assignment for that subject. 
RIV-HU6-203 Version 3.0  
31  If a serious adverse event (SAE; as defined in Section 11.8.1) is reported to the Medical Monitor or Sponsor and unblinding is agreed upon, the Investigator may unblind the treatment assignment for the individual subject. If an expedited regulatory report to one or more regulatory agencies is required, the report will identify the subject’s treatment assignment. When applicable, a copy of the regulatory report may be sent to investigators in accordance with relevant regulations, Sponsor policy, or both. Study drug will consist of HU6 and a matching placebo. The placebo will be identical in appearance to the active HU6. An unblinded pharmacist (or designee) at the study site will prepare medication before use according to instructions provided separately. The pharmacist will be required to maintain the blind, and the pharmacist will not otherwise participate in this study. Treatment assignments will be based on a computer-generated randomization code provided by [CONTACT_279591]. Sponsor personnel, including those involved in monitoring, data management, and data analysis, will not have access to the treatment codes during the trial. Access to the treatment codes will be restricted to personnel charged with generating and maintaining randomization files, preparing study drug, analyzing plasma concentrations, and reporting SAEs to regulatory agencies.  Once a randomization assignment has been made for a subject, it must not be reassigned. 7 STUDY POPULATIO N 7.1 Number of Subjects Assuming 15% drop-out rate, approximately [ADDRESS_341320] meet all the following inclusion criteria to be eligible: 1.

Major protocol violation (i.e., circumstances where confounding conditions make it impossible to derive sound scientific or medical conclusions from the primary endpoint data generated on a subject).  4. Any condition, injury, or disease that becomes apparent during the study and necessitates the termination of the subject from the study. 5. The development of an elevated temperature is not a cause for withdrawal of HU6 alone. Should a subject develop a temperature > 100○F, they should be instructed to repeat the measurement approximately [ADDRESS_341332] the investigational site to be evaluated by [CONTACT_093]. They should not take HU6 nor any anti-pyretic (acetaminophen, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) prior to evaluation by [CONTACT_093]. The investigator should assess the subject medically to ascertain the underlying cause of the elevated temperature. Appropriate laboratory tests, including those for COVID-19 or influenza, may be warranted to provide a diagnosis.  a) Should the investigator be unable to identify the cause for the elevated temperature, but the subject’s body temperature has returned to normal, dosing with HU6 may be restarted based on the medical judgment of the investigator and in discussions with the medical monitor. Appropriate follow-up should take place once dosing re-starts.  
RIV-HU6-203 Version 3.0  
37  b) Subjects with persistent temperature elevations after HU6 has been stopped for [ADDRESS_341333] practices for the detection, assessment, and management of suspected acute drug-induced liver injury (DILI) during clinical trial in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis which are applicable to the subjects being enrolled in this trial (Regev et al., 2018). Please see Appendix C for a table from that Consensus that shows the algorithm for monitoring and managing of hepatocellular DILI in phase 2-3 NASH clinical trials in patients with normal or elevated baseline ALT, as well as the listing of the Consensus and Recommendations. 7. Administrative reason (e.g., termination of the clinical study by a Regulatory Agency or the Sponsor). 8. Lost to follow-up. 9. Pregnancy. 7.4.[ADDRESS_341334] is “lost to follow-up” (i.e., fails to return for study visits), a reasonable effort (3 documented phone calls or 2 phone calls and 2 text messages, on separate occasions, and a follow-up letter sent by [CONTACT_279594]) should be made to contact [CONTACT_12552]/her to determine a reason for the failure to return. If the subject cannot be reached, they should be identified as “lost to follow-up” in the eCRF. 7.4.[ADDRESS_341335] will be given the same treatment assignment (by [CONTACT_63539]) as the withdrawn subject. A randomized subject who withdraws from the study after initiation of study drug dosing will not be replaced. 8 TREATME NT PLA N AND METHODS Study procedures should be completed as designated in the Schedule of Assessments (Section 8.1). However, if a participant is unable to attend a visit within a specified window, the Investigator (or qualified designee) should discuss appropriate scheduling with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor. 
RIV-HU6-203 Version 3.0  
38  Blood samples for HU6, DNP, and M1 PK are required for analysis of parameters and these samples should be collected as close to the protocol-defined times for sample collection as possible.  Whenever 12-lead ECGs, routine vital sign measurements, and blood draws are scheduled for the same time, it is preferable (but not required) that these assessments occur in the following order: 12-lead ECGs, vital signs, and blood draws. The timing of the assessments should allow the blood draws to occur at the approximate nominal time. The actual date and time should be recorded for all procedures and the Investigator should make every effort to perform procedures at the nominal dates and times. However, unscheduled procedures required for the evaluation of safety concerns take precedence over all scheduled routine procedures.

54 Protocol Version 3.0    10.1 Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Proton Density Fat Fraction (MRI-PDFF) Magnetic Resonance Imaging Proton Density Fat Fraction (MRI-PDFF) is a non-invasive, quantitative biomarker to assess liver fat content (steatosis). The percentage of fat in the liver, or proton density fat fraction (PDFF), is being measured using MR: MRI-PDFF at baseline and end of treatment. Liver volume will be assessed from an axial T1 weighted or dual echo gradient echo images covering the entire liver.  This advanced MRI technique measures the fraction of mobile protons in the liver attributable to liver fat (the PDFF), which is a direct measure of liver fat content and is a fundamental tissue property.  Subjects should be fasting for [ADDRESS_341349] to follow up with their primary physician. 10.2 Abdominal MRI An MRI image will be taken of the abdominal region to assess total fat.  The two primary measurements from this scan will estimate the total visceral adipose tissue (VAT), the type of fat stored within the body cavity, and the subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), the type of fat visible right underneath the skin.   10.3 Fibroscan® The Fibroscan is a non-invasive medical device which estimates liver fat content (steatosis) and liver stiffness (fibrosis). The assay works by [CONTACT_279595]. A 50-MHz wave is passed into the liver from a small transducer on the end of an ultrasound probe. The probe also has a transducer on the end that measure the velocity of the shear wave (in meters per second) as this wave passes through the liver. The shear wave velocity is converted into liver stiffness, which is expressed in kilopascals (VCTE score). A second measurement is also taken that estimates hepatic steatosis through measuring the ultrasonic attenuation of the echo wave, termed the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP).  Subjects will need to be fasting for 4 hours prior to the Fibroscan® being conducted. 10.[ADDRESS_341350] Liver Assays (OWL) 10.4.1 OWL – Metabolomics This metabolomics assay extracts metabolites from volunteer plasma and serum to take a snapshot of cellular function. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics is used to identify serum biomarkers that differentiate normal liver and NAFLD and between NASH and NAFLD. The metabolomics profile also provides insight into cellular function and inflammation through the examination of various cellular metabolites that provide insight into key molecular pathways. 10.4.2 OWL – Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_279563]-invasive blood assay that analyzes and identifies lipi[INVESTIGATOR_279564]. These lipi[INVESTIGATOR_279565], fatty acid derivatives, glycerolipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], glycerophospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], sphingolipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], and sterols.

55 Protocol Version 3.0    10.5 Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamer (SomaScan) SomaScan is a non-invasive blood assay. Blood plasma and serum samples will be assayed using oligonucleotide aptamers whose three-dimensional conformational shape binds specifically to a protein target of interest. Over seven thousand proteins will be assayed and quantified, enabling a proteomic snapshot of the body. Different mathematical models have been applied to large clinical data to establish algorithms with predictive value in cardiovascular health, metabolic rate, lean body mass, liver inflammation, cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_17863], and glucose tolerance.   10.6 Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) The ELF assay is a non-invasive blood test that measures three markers of liver inflammation and fibrosis:  hyaluronic acid, procollagen III amino-terminal peptide (PI[INVESTIGATOR_120861]), and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1). The values of these three markers, when used in conjunction with accompanying clinical data, are highly predictive of the inflammatory and fibrotic state of the liver, as evidenced by [CONTACT_279596]. 10.[ADDRESS_341351] in explaining the pharmacological actions of HU6.  11 SAFETY ASSESSME NTS 11.1 Adverse Events  Adverse events will be captured from the start of study-related procedures at Screening (including diagnostic assessments or after signing of ICF) onward during this study. Important medical events and conditions occurring prior to this period are not AEs; they will be captured within the medical chart and in the Medical History section of the Case Report Form. 11.2 Physical Examination  Height should be measured on a wall-mounted stadiometer at Screening.  Refer to Section 8 for physical examination time points.  Complete Physical:  At study visits in which a complete physical examination is required, the investigator should perform a thorough examination of all body systems (exception: genitourinary and reproductive should be symptom-directed). Neurological examination should include the assessment of strength. Targeted Exam:  A targeted physical exam that is symptom-based. Based upon change to subject symptoms or visual findings; in addition, each exam should include a limited neurological evaluation of the strength of muscle groups. The commonly accepted method of evaluating muscle strength is the Medical Research Council Manual Muscle Testing scale. This method involves testing key muscles from the upper and lower extremities against the examiner’s resistance and grading the patient’s strength on a 0 to 5 scale accordingly: 
RIV-HU6-203 Version 3.0  
56 Protocol Version 3.0    • 0  No muscle activation • 1  Trace muscle activation, such as a twitch, without achieving full range of motion • 2  Muscle activation with gravity eliminated, achieving full range of motion • [ADDRESS_341352] gravity, full range of motion • [ADDRESS_341353] some resistance, full range of motion • [ADDRESS_341354] examiner’s full resistance, full range of motion 11.[ADDRESS_341355] of the maculas of both eyes, and slit lamp evaluations will be performed at screening and at the completion of dosing (approximately Day 61) to characterize the subject’s baseline status and to monitor any changes from baseline over the course of treatment. Pupi[INVESTIGATOR_279566] 2.5% neosynephrine and 0.5% tropi[INVESTIGATOR_31424] (Mydriacyl) (unless there is a contraindication deemed by [CONTACT_1964]), one drop in each eye one time in light color eyes and up to two times, [ADDRESS_341356] has been supi[INVESTIGATOR_2525] ≥ [ADDRESS_341357] at home utilizing a Braun Thermoscan 7 inner ear thermometer which will be provided to them. The thermometer provides a color-coded display that displays the temperature as well as indicating normal, elevated (>99.9⁰ F, yellow display), or fever (>103⁰ F, red display) temperatures. There is an audible feedback system that ensures appropriate usage and alerts the user that the temperature has been acquired. Nine previous reading will be recorded on the thermometer. Temperature readings should be done daily at the time of dosing. Should the subject have symptoms that may indicate a fever, they should take their temperature and verify. For temperature elevations ≥100⁰ F, as indicated by [CONTACT_279597], the subject should stop taking HU6, avoid antipyretics (acetaminophen, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_855]-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents) and call the

Further guidance will be provided by [CONTACT_90021] (See Section 7.4 Withdrawal of Subjects). 11.5 Clinical Laboratory Tests Refer to Section 8 for clinical laboratory blood and urine collection time points.  Refer to the Study Procedure Manual for more information about sample collection, processing, storage, and shipment.  At Screening only:  Viral serology will include testing for the presence of hepatitis B antigen, anti-hepatitis C antibody and anti-HIV antibodies.   TSH and Free T4.   eGFR = CKD-EPI [INVESTIGATOR_91258] (NKF 2009; https://www.kidney.org/content/ckd-epi-creatinine-equation-2009).  Hematology testing will include erythrocyte mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume (MCV), hematocrit, hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and absolute counts of lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils and platelets. Serum chemistry analyses will include glucose, calcium, albumin, total protein, sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, chloride, magnesium, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, phosphate, uric acid, lactate dehydrogenase, ALT, AST, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), bilirubin (total and direct), amylase, and CPK.   Baseline ALT and AST = while each value will be recorded, the average of screening and Day [ADDRESS_341358] time points include glycated albumin, hs-CRP, ApoB, Lp(a), and HOMA-IR (includes glucose, insulin, and C-peptide; Wallace 2004), and PEth test.   For HOMA-IR, 3 blood samples for the 3 analytes (blood glucose, serum insulin, and C-peptide) will be drawn after a minimum of 5 minutes between each sample.  The PEth test is a serum biomarker that can assess recent alcohol consumption.  The value is dependent on both quantity of alcohol and time from consumption.  This will be assessed at screening and Day 28.  At the discretion of the investigator, it can be obtained at other times if there is concern for excessive alcohol consumption based on history, symptoms or laboratory evaluations (e.g. elevated liver function tests). The report lists several different assays, but this study will rely on the based on PEth 16.0/18.1 (POPEth) assay, which has been validated. Urinalysis will consist of dipstick evaluations, with a reflex microscopic evaluation if dipstick shows blood or protein is small (1+), moderate (2+) or large (3+). Spot urine protein and albumin to be done if urine > trace protein on [ADDRESS_341359] 10 minutes. External stimuli should be kept to a minimum. Video games, watching of TV, and talking will not be allowed during this time. A digital ECG machine will be utilized for the trial. If an ECG timepoint coincides with any blood samples, the ECGs will performed ± [ADDRESS_341360] a meal within 2 hours prior to an ECG being performed.  The ECGs will be measured using an ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, RR, QRS, QT, and QTcF (Fridericia correction formula). The same ECG machine should be used for the same subject throughout the study, if at all possible. ECGs should be conducted in adherence with a research unit SOP acceptable to the Sponsor.  11.7 Adverse Events  11.7.1 Definitions  Adverse Event  An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject undergoing a study procedure or administration of a study drug. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. Medical conditions present at the initial trial visit that do not worsen in severity or frequency during the trial are defined as baseline conditions (medical history) and are not to be considered AEs. The sources of AEs include but are not limited to:  The subject’s response to questions about his/her health (a standard nonleading question such as “How have you been feeling since your last visit?” asked at each visit).  Symptoms spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_423].  Investigations and examinations with findings that are assessed by [CONTACT_16426].   Other information related to the subject’s health becoming known to the Investigator.  For surgical or diagnostic procedures, the condition/illness leading to such a procedure is considered as the AE rather than the procedure itself. Laboratory Abnormality A laboratory abnormality will be considered an AE when it is clinically significant and suggesting a disease or organ toxicity and which is of a severity requiring active management (i.e., changes of dose, discontinuation of drug, more frequent follow-up, medical treatment or a diagnostic investigation).  
RIV-HU6-203 Version 3.0  
59 Protocol Version 3.0    Pretreatment Adverse Events  A pretreatment AE is any AE occurring during the pretreatment period (between informed consent and initiation of a study drug dosing).  Treatment-emergent Adverse Events  Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are all AEs occurring during the treatment period or a pretreatment AE that worsens in intensity during the treatment period. 11.7.2 Collection and Rating of Adverse Events  During the course of the study (i.e., from the signing of the ICF through the Follow-up Visit plus 30 days for any SAE) all AEs, irrespective of the relatedness to the study drug, will be collected and reported on the Adverse Event Report Form. The seriousness criteria should not be confused with the intensity of the event. In case of an SAE, a Serious Adverse Event Report Form must be completed and transmitted to the Sponsor or designee.  Overdoses and medication errors in the presence of clinical consequences should be recorded as AEs. The clinical consequence should be reported as “[enter AE] due to overdose.” [IP_ADDRESS] Onset Date The onset date is the date when the first sign(s) or symptom(s) were first noted. For example, if the AE is an abnormal laboratory test (such as “platelets low”), the onset date is the date when the sample was taken. If the subject was hospi[INVESTIGATOR_279567], and symptoms such as fever, headache and nausea started the day before the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the onset date is the day symptoms presented versus day of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. [IP_ADDRESS] Assessment of Intensity The intensity of each AE will be rated according to the following 3-point scale:  Mild:  Awareness of signs or symptoms, but no disruption of usual activity  Moderate:  Event sufficient to affect usual activity (disturbing)  Severe:  Inability to work or perform usual activities (unacceptable) The CTCAE system will be used to assess the severity of the SAEs, AEs. [IP_ADDRESS] Relationship to Study Drug The causal relationship of the study drug to an AE will be rated according to the following 4-point scale:  Unrelated: Clearly and incontrovertibly due only to extraneous causes, and does not meet criteria listed under unlikely, possible or probable  Unlikely:  Does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration; may have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_162839][INVESTIGATOR_279568]-HU6-203 Version 3.0  
60 Protocol Version 3.0     Possible:  Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration; may have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or by [CONTACT_162839][INVESTIGATOR_191293]  Probable:  Clear temporal association with improvement on cessation of study drug or reduction in dose. Reappears upon re-challenge or follows a known pattern of response to the study drug AEs considered ‘unrelated or unlikely’ will be considered unrelated causality, whereas ‘possible or probable’ will be considered related causality.  [IP_ADDRESS] Action Taken  The action taken toward the study drug in response to an AE will be listed as one of the following:   None:  no change in study drug regimen due to the event  Discontinued:  the study drug was permanently stopped due to the event  Interrupted:  the study drug was temporarily interrupted due to the event [IP_ADDRESS] Outcome of Adverse Event  The outcome of an AE will be recorded as one of the following:   Recovered:  fully recovered or the condition has returned to the level observed at baseline  Recovered with sequelae:  resulted in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; the nature of the sequelae should be specified  Ongoing  Death 11.7.[ADDRESS_341361] who has any AE (whether serious or non-serious) or clinically significant (in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]) abnormal laboratory test values will be evaluated by [CONTACT_29517] a monitoring physician, and will be treated and followed up until the symptoms or values return to normal or acceptable levels, as judged by [CONTACT_2725].  Adverse events that are unresolved at end of study or upon early withdrawal will be tracked at least weekly by [CONTACT_279598], for [ADDRESS_341362] to follow-up (defined as failure to respond to three phone messages left on separate days and one certified letter requesting follow-up).  Subjects will be instructed to inform site staff of any AEs occurring during the 30-day period after discharge or early withdrawal. Any follow-up information available at the time of the subject’s end of study will be included in the clinical study report. 
RIV-HU6-[ADDRESS_341363] medical occurrence that:   Results in death. Death is not an event per se but rather an outcome. Note that any event resulting in a fatal outcome must be fully documented and reported, including deaths that occur within 30 days after treatment ends and irrespective of the causal relationship to the study drug.  Is life-threatening. Life-threatening refers to an AE in which the subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which may have caused death, if it was more severe.  Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_279569] a result of an event. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_279570] a period of at least 24 hours. Over-night stays for observation; stays at the emergency room or treatment on an outpatient basis does not constitute a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. However, medical judgment must always be exercised and, when in doubt, the case should be considered serious (i.e. if the case fulfills the criterion for a medically important event). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_279571]. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2144]/or surgical operations planned before study inclusion are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the subject were enrolled in the study, provided that the condition did not deteriorate during the study.  Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability/incapacity means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. If in doubt, the decision should be left to medical judgment by [CONTACT_737].  Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Any congenital anomaly or birth defect observed in any offspring of the subject conceived during treatment with the study drug.  Is an important medical event. Important medical events are events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31348]. Examples of important medical events include AEs that suggest a significant hazard, contraindication or precaution, occurrence of malignancy or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether events qualify as medically important. An AE caused by [CONTACT_279599] a criterion listed in the definitions above is fulfilled. The following are not considered SAEs:  A pre-existing condition that is present prior to or at the start of the study that did not worsen 
RIV-HU6-203 Version 3.0  
62 Protocol Version 3.0     Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_279572], for a pre-existing condition unrelated to the indication under study that did not worsen  Admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_279573], not associated with any deterioration in condition. 11.8.[ADDRESS_341364] be reported to the Sponsor or the Sponsor’s agent immediately (within 24 hours) via telephone or facsimile. If initially reported via telephone, this must be followed-up by a facsimile of the written SAE report. The Investigator must report all SAEs occurring from the time the subject signs the ICF until [ADDRESS_341365] details as specified below:  Sponsor Representative and Contact [CONTACT_110364]: Roger Morgan, M.D. Vice President Medical Affairs MedSurgPI, LLC [ADDRESS_341366] Franklinton, NC  [ZIP_CODE] 11.8.3 Handling of Follow-up Information Follow-up information may be required, or additional information may be received by [CONTACT_1034] (e.g., evolution of the SAE, other signs or symptoms, final diagnosis, outcome, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458], or autopsy report). The same procedures and timelines as for initial reporting, listed above, should be followed for any follow-up information. If necessary, the study site will be visited to collect additional information. Follow-up information is required on all SAEs until one of the following criteria is satisfied:  The outcome of the case is known  The event is resolved, or the medical condition of the subject is stabilized  No further information is available  Sponsor assessment has been finalized 11.8.[ADDRESS_341367] from the study and follow the pregnancy until termination or until the child is 1 month old. The pregnancy will be reported immediately by [CONTACT_135699] a completed Pregnancy Report to the Sponsor within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. The pregnancy will not be 
RIV-HU6-203 Version 3.0  
63 Protocol Version 3.0    processed as an SAE; however, the Investigator should notify the Sponsor or the Sponsor’s agent of the outcome of the pregnancy by [CONTACT_17258] a follow-up Pregnancy Report. Additionally, if the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification of an SAE (e.g., spontaneous or therapeutic abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator will report the event by [CONTACT_80381] a completed SAE Report Form to the Sponsor within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. 11.8.5 Expedited Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  [IP_ADDRESS] Responsibilities The Sponsor is responsible for ensuring the timely reporting of SAEs to Regulatory Authorities and all Investigators who participate in the clinical development program of the study drug. It is the responsibility of the Investigator to provide the Sponsor with the case information such that reporting timeline demands of applicable Regulatory Authorities can be met. [IP_ADDRESS] Expedited Reporting All AEs that are serious, unexpected, and considered related to the study drug judged by [CONTACT_279600]. All available information relevant to the evaluation of the SAE will be reported. Serious adverse events will be considered reportable regardless of whether the study drug was used in accordance with the provisions in the protocol. Adverse events which are serious, but expected, or those which are not associated with the study drug will only be subjected to expedited reporting if they are required to be reported to an authority according to national requirements.  [IP_ADDRESS] Timelines Fatal or life-threatening serious unexpected related cases require rapid reporting. Regulatory Authorities shall be notified as soon as possible but no later than [ADDRESS_341368] knowledge by [CONTACT_279601]. It is the responsibility of the Investigator to support Sponsor activities needed to meet the timelines for Regulatory Authority reporting in the event of an SAE. 12 STATISTICAL METHODS 12.1 General Overview of the Statistical Analysis Plan Descriptive statistical methods will be used to summarize the data from this study, with statistical testing performed for the efficacy endpoints. Unless stated otherwise, the term “descriptive statistics” refers to number of subjects (n), mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for continuous data, and frequencies and percentages for categorical data. Statistical testing, if performed, will be 2-sided and will be performed using a significance (alpha) level of 0.05. There will be no adjustment for multiple comparisons for this exploratory study. All available data for enrolled subjects will be listed by [CONTACT_1130]. 
RIV-HU6-[ADDRESS_341369] number. All statistical analyses will be conducted with the SAS® System, version 9.4 or higher.   Additional statistical details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). In the event of higher than anticipated early terminations due to COVID-19, or other reasons, Rivus Pharmaceuticals, may extend enrollment in order to maintain the planned statistical power. 12.[ADDRESS_341370] 80% power to detect a 30% difference in the mean relative change from baseline in liver fat content at Day 61, when the standard deviation is 30% [PASS 2020: Two sample t-test, alpha=.05]. Assuming a 15% dropout rate, up to [ADDRESS_341371] 68 subjects, 17 per group, are evaluable for the primary efficacy endpoint analysis.  12.3 Data Analysis 12.3.1 Analysis Populations Intent-to-Treat (ITT):  includes all randomized subjects. Full Analysis Set (FAS): includes all randomized subjects who receive at least 1 dose of treatment.  PK Concentration Population: includes all subjects who receive at least one dose of HU6 and have at least one adequately documented plasma sample obtained and analyzed for measurable HU6, DNP and M1 concentrations. PK Parameter Population: includes all subjects who have an evaluable HU6, DNP and M1 plasma concentration data. 12.3.[ADDRESS_341372] are 2-sided tests comparing each active HU6 treatment groups to the placebo.

This estimand will include available MRI-PDFF evaluations that occur before discontinuation of treatment. The differences between treatment groups will be based on the least square mean (LSMean) differences between each HU6 group and placebo. A separate comparison of the combined HU6 groups and placebo may be conducted. The corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) will be presented. 
RIV-HU6-[ADDRESS_341373]-baseline assessments (changes from baseline in body weight, whole body adiposity, AVCTE, CAP, ELF, serum hs-CRP, Lp(A), Apo B, LDL, HDL, total cholesterol, triglycerides, FFA, plasma ceramides, HOMA-IR, fasting blood glucose concentrations, glycated albumin concentrations, and HbA1c) will be analyzed for the FAS using a Mixed Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM). This estimand will include available post-baseline response data that occur before discontinuation of treatment. The baseline score will be included as the covariate, and HbA1c stratification, treatment group, visit, and the interaction between treatment group and visit will be included as fixed factors in the MMRM. The difference between each HU6 level versus placebo at each visit will be estimated based on the LSMeans from the MMRM. 12.3.4 Safety Analysis The safety analysis will be conducted on the FAS. Should there be any subjects that receive a treatment other the randomized treatment, the treatment as received will be used for safety presentations. AEs will be assessed for toxicity grade using NCI CTCAE (Version 5 or higher) and will be coded for summarization using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA® Version 10.1 or higher). Concomitant medications will be coded using WHO Drug Dictionary (enhanced) Format C, 15 Aug 2005 or more recent updated version. Treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_9315], for each dose group (including placebo). Further summaries by [CONTACT_12917], severity, and relationship to study drug may be conducted.  Laboratory measures will be summarized by [CONTACT_85839]-point both as absolute values and as change from baseline, with descriptive statistics summarizing each group and time point. Similar presentation will be used for vital signs and for ECG interval measurements, and changes from pre-treatment baseline. ECG intervals will be calculated from ECG/continuous ECG recordings at each time point.  A separate statistical analysis plan may be developed for exploratory evaluations of HU6 concentrations and QTcF.  12.3.5 Pharmacokinetic Analysis Plasma concentration-time data of HU6, DNP and M1 will be displayed in tables and/or graphs. Individual plasma concentration-time data will be pooled, and population pharmacokinetics will be performed using a currently acceptable methods as permitted by [CONTACT_279602] a prospective analysis plan. PK parameters such as Clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (V) will be determined. In addition, the influence of various covariates (e.g., BMI) of the PK parameters will be examined. Individual PK parameter estimates will be used to calculate summary metrics of exposure including AUC and Cmax. Full details will be provided in a Pharmacokinetic Analysis Plan.  12.3.6 Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses PK/PD modeling may be conducted to better define exposure-response and dose determination for future studies, as appropriate.

All ethics approvals must be obtained, and regulatory obligations met before a subject is exposed to any study-related procedure, including screening tests for eligibility. 13.2.[ADDRESS_341377] information sheet will be revised or updated where necessary. Under these circumstances, all subjects (including those already being treated) should be informed of the new information, given a copy of the revised form and allowed to reevaluate their consent to continue in the study. 13.3 End of Study and Regulatory Notification The study can be terminated in part or in whole at the discretion of the FDA, an applicable Regulatory Authority or the Sponsor.  At the end of the study, the IRBs and Regulatory Authorities will be notified by [CONTACT_279603].

68 Protocol Version 3.0    13.4 Data Protection and Confidentiality The confidentiality of records that could identify subjects should be protected, respecting the privacy and confidentiality rules in accordance with applicable regulatory requirement(s). 13.[ADDRESS_341378] of the study is being done in accordance with applicable regulations and GCP guidelines. 13.6 Quality Assurance and Quality Control The Sponsor or its designee will perform the quality assurance and quality control activities of this study; however, responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of the study data presented to the Sponsor lies with the Principal or Qualified Investigator generating the data.  Prior to the study initiation, the Sponsor will explain the protocol, Investigator’s Brochure, and CRFs to Investigators. In addition, the Monitor will be available to explain applicable regulations and to answer any questions regarding the conduct of the study. At its discretion, the Sponsor may conduct audits as part of the implementation of quality assurance to ensure that the study is being conducted in compliance with the protocol, Standard Operating Procedures, GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements. Audits will be independent of and separate from the routine monitoring and quality control functions. The study center may also be compelled to an inspection by a Regulatory Authority. 13.[ADDRESS_341379] be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_11305] (or designee) for compliance with GCP. Study-specific data sheets may be used to document source information that would not normally be collected and documented in the routine management of the subject. Data sheets used for source 
RIV-HU6-[ADDRESS_341380]’s clinic records (preferably) or in the Investigator File. The Investigator will permit study-related monitoring, audit(s), IRB review(s), and regulatory inspection(s), with a direct access to all the required source documents and associated records. [ADDRESS_341381] procedures (including following data review guidelines, manual clinical review based on subject profiles, computerized validation to produce queries, and maintenance of an audit file which includes all database modifications) will be followed to ensure accurate data. Clinical personnel will review all data listings for outliers, data inconsistencies, and spelling errors. During the course of the study, a study monitor (CRA) will make site visits to review protocol compliance, compare eCRFs against individual subject’s medical records, assess drug accountability, and ensure that the study is being conducted according to pertinent regulatory requirements. Electronic CRF entries will be verified with source documentation. The review of medical records will be performed in a manner to ensure that subject confidentiality is maintained. Checking the eCRFs for completeness, clarity and cross checking with source documents is required to monitor the progress of the study. Direct access to source data is also required for inspections and audits and will be carried out giving due consideration to data protection and medical confidentiality. 14.[ADDRESS_341382] 15 years after the completion or discontinuation of/withdrawal from the study or [ADDRESS_341383] adequate current insurance to cover claims for negligence and/or malpractice.

oral   Known Risk of TdP - Substantial evidence supports the conclusion that these drugs prolong the QT interval AND are clearly associated with a risk of TdP, even when taken as directed in official labeling.   Drugs to Avoid in Congenital Long QT - Substantial evidence supports the conclusion that these drugs pose a risk of TdP for patients with congenital long QT. Drugs on this list include those in the above three risk categories and other drugs that do not prolong the QT interval per se but they have a theoretical risk of causing arrhythmia that is based on their known stimulant actions on the heart.

(whichever  occurs  first) Normal  or elevated  Severe  fatigue,  nausea, vomiting,  
right upper  quadrant  pain Interrupt study  drug.  Initiate  close  monitoring  and 
workup  for competing  etiologies.  Study  drug can be 
restarted  only if another  etiology  is identified,  and liver  
enzymes  return  to baseline.      ALP, alkaline phosphatase; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; DILI, drug‐induced liver injury; INR, international normalized ratio; TBL, total bilirubin, ULN, upper limit of normal. a. Baseline ALT is derived from an average of two pre‐treatment ALT measurements at least 2 weeks apart. Elevated baseline is defined as ALT ≥1.5× ULN. In patients with a sizable stable decrease in ALT (>50% of the baseline value) during treatment, a new baseline, corresponding to the ALT nadir, should be established on an individual basis for subsequent determination of a DILI signal. b. The actions of close observation, monitoring, and drug interruption often overlap. Occasionally, workup is initiated after drug interruption.

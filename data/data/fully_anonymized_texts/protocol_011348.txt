Caregivers of adults with heart failure (HF) a re an understudied group. HF is extremely common . Most HF

knowing that not  all HF patients will participate, w e will consent  a subgroup of the HF patients care d for by

Aim 1 : To compare  the efficacy  of ViCCY  vs. HI alone in improving self -care. We hypothesize that, a t [ADDRESS_205086]  H1a: Improved self-care 
measured with the Health Self -Care Neglect  scale35 (primary outcome ); H1b: Less self-reported stress 
measured with the Perceived Stress Scale36 (secondary outcome);  H1c: Better  copi[INVESTIGATOR_175797],  short form37,38(secondary outcome) ; and H1d: Better perceived mental

Aim 3 ( Exploratory ): To explore t he effect of caregiver outcomes  on HF patient  outcomes . We hypothesize 
that, a t 12 months  after enrollment , HF patients whose caregivers improve vs. not improve in self -care – 
regardless of group – will have H3a: Lower hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14285] ; H3b:  Fewer hospi[INVESTIGATOR_598] ; H3c: Lower

 Page [ADDRESS_205089] more stress ,43,44 worse self -care,10,45-48 poorer health 
status,8,27,49,50 and higher mortality than non- caregivers.48,51-55 Caregivers often feel left alone to cope with 
problems, which exacerbates  their stress.56 When stressed, caregivers are less vigilant and less motivated to 
engage in behaviors that will benefit them selves  and their charges .57,58 In a study of 121 mainly  female 
caregivers (mean age 61±13.4  years) of older  family members, healthy self -care behaviors were lowest in 
those with high stress scores.59 In another  study, after four years of follow -up, stressed caregivers were at 63% 
higher risk for mortality than non- caregiving controls.7 Together these studies illustrate the risk that informal 
care providers face when they defer sel f-care in response to the stress of caregiving.   
A.2. Informal c aregivers of patients with heart failure (H F caregivers)  are an understudied population.  
Although  informal  HF caregivers  face many of the same issues as other caregivers , they also face unique 
challenges . HF caregivers are older than other caregivers  (mean 55.7 vs 49.4 years ; p < 0.001) .[ADDRESS_205090]-wages and out -of-pocket expenses; in a study of end -stage HF patients, 23% of families had lost 
all or most of their savings by [CONTACT_175872].[ADDRESS_205091] on caregivers’ 
lives.76,77 While c aregivers of other populations often report satisfaction from caregiving, we see no  evidence of 
caregiving satisfaction in HF caregivers.  They  are burdened, stressed, and poor in self -care.30,69,71,78 
A.3. Effective i nterventions are needed for HF caregivers. Few randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) of 
interventions for HF caregiver s have been published, [ADDRESS_205092] focused on improving HF 
caregiver burden, stress , or health status  – not caregiver self -care.76,80,[ADDRESS_205093] common interventions 
involved psychoeducation facilitated by a registered nurse (RN), supplemented with face -to-face follow -up 
sessions, home visits, telephone calls and/ or virtual monitoring.[ADDRESS_205094] for patients, prior approval of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5394] , and team participation in 
discharge planning effectively reduced caregiver stress and improved health status , but patient care costs  
increased by 12 % at [ADDRESS_205095] been effective because of failure to include elements  argued to be essential in 
caregiving interventions:86 1) a psychosocial rather than purely  educational approach; 2) flexibility ; 3) 
multidimensional ity; and 4) sufficient intervention dose.   We developed ViCCY to address these elements . 
A.4. Internet -based v irtual approaches can be used to support homebound caregivers. Successful 
implementation of potentially effective interventions is impeded when caregivers are homebound with 
caregiving duties.30,[ADDRESS_205096] to deliver an intervention,  where distractions are 
predictable and privacy  can be optim ized.90 Home interventions are perceived as conv enient, requiring less 
time commitment, travel costs, and waiting times ; duration and timing of sessions can be  flexible and 
accommodate caregiver preferences. Support is important to the success of psychosocial interventions ,[ADDRESS_205097] PD/PI: [INVESTIGATOR_175792], BARBARA J

Intern et-based interventions were effective in r educing caregiver stress and improving their well -being.94 
According to the 2015  US Census,  77% of the US population has broadband Internet access at home.[ADDRESS_205098] -effectiveness acceptability curve98 indicated >99% chance of being 
cost-effecti ve in the short and longer term.99,[ADDRESS_205099] associated with informal caregiving of patients with HF in the US was estimated 
at $[ADDRESS_205100] majority of these studies are descriptive, and no one has 
tested the influence of an intervention for caregivers on HF patient outcomes . The mechanism by [CONTACT_175873].105-108 Relationship  quality 
influenc es burden,109 emotional distress,110 self-care behaviors,14,105 decision -making,111 and quality of life in

mortality , but there is  little evidence on this topic .28,29,113 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_175798] 30-days are especially high 
(20-25%)  in HF patients ,[ADDRESS_205101] been readmitted .117 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_175799],118 and 
the a nnual total costs attributable to HF are so high119 that HF is the primary contributor to the US Medicare

A.7. Theoretical Framework. The proposed  study  is based on the Transactional Model of Stress and Copi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 
(Figure 1).121 Stressful experiences such as caregiving demand – circumstances that give rise to real or 
percei ved stress  – are construed as person -environment transactions.121 Primary appraisal of demand involves 
assessment of its significance, which results in perceived burden. Secondary appraisal involves assessment of 
the resources available to cope with it. These appraisals lead to  the copi[INVESTIGATOR_175800].121 Without successful copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
self-care is poor, which 
decreases health status  in 
caregivers . Our virtual support 
intervention [ViCCY (“Vicky” ) – 
Virtual Caregiver Coach for You]  
addresses both appraisal and 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Because s tress does 
not affect all people equally , the 
intervention is tailored to 
individual appraisals and th e 
factors  most likely to influence 
demand and perceived 
burden.[ADDRESS_205102] PD/PI: [INVESTIGATOR_175792], BARBARA J
Research Strategy                                                                                             
 Page [ADDRESS_205103] of caregiver outcomes on 
HF patient outcomes. Although a growing body of research i llustrates the i nfluence of caregivers on patients 
and vice versa, (i.e., dyadic processes), very few intervention studies have explored the influence of the 
caregiver experience on patient outcomes.    
B.  INNOVATION  
Our proposed research is innovative for  several  reasons : 
1. We focus on a patient  population (those with HF)  with unique issues –  e.g., symptom burden, impaired 
cognition, frequen t hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], multi morbidity , and complex regimens  – that increase caregiver 
demand,  burden , and stress . While de mentia caregivers face many  of these issues,[ADDRESS_205104] 
studies of HF emphasize the caregiver’s role in promoting HF patient  self-care. T he proposed study will 
provide a robust description of HF  caregivers’  self-care and the manner in which it changes  with 
intervention.  
3. We have developed a unique approach to health coaching that targets stress and self -care concurrently . 
ViCCY is potentially more powerful than interventions addressing either issue alone because self -care is 
lower in stressed populations and self -care can potentiate stress reduction approaches.[ADDRESS_205105] of a stress intervention for caregivers on outcomes in HF 
patients.  Measuring QALYs in both caregivers and HF patients, we will be able to assess benefit in both.  
C.  APPROACH  
C.1. Research Team  (see Biographical Sketches and Letters of Support for details) . Our multidisciplinary 
team based at th e University of Pennsylvania ( Penn)  is well positioned to complete the proposed study . Team 
member s, most of whom  have worked together for the past decade,138-[ADDRESS_205106]  informed all dimensions of the propos al: Barbara Riegel , PhD  [Principal Investigator 
(PI)] HF, health coaching, motivational interviewing, caregivers, self -care]; Kathryn Bowles , PhD  (Co-I) virtual 
technolog ies; Karen Hirschman, PhD  (Co-I) interventions with older caregiver s; Joyce Wald , DO (Co-I), heart 
failure;  Norma B. Coe, PhD  (Co-I) cost-effectiveness analysis ; and Alexandra Hanlon, PhD  (Co-I) biostatistic s. 
Led by [CONTACT_978], members will share responsibility for the conduct and integrity of the study. See Budget Narrative for specific responsibilities and contributions . 
C.2. Preliminary Studies. We developed our intervention in patients and have modified it for caregivers. In the 
first study , we refined our tailored health coaching intervention in 15 HF patients (mean age 60 ± 13.3 
years, 53% White, 60% female) .
146 The intervention, provided by [CONTACT_175874] 3 ± 1.5 home 
visits over 3  months, focused on improving self -care. Motivational interviewing was used to elicit beliefs about 
the illness, personal goals, and self -efficacy. Reflective listening and empathy were used to provide support, 
decrease barriers and build skill  in self-care.  There was evidence of improvement in self -care in 80%  of HF 
patients after receiving the intervention.[ADDRESS_205107]

in the intervention group than the control group (19.7 ±  16.0 vs. 12.1 ± 18.3 improvement in standardized 
scores ), a clinically and statistically significant difference after adjust ing for confounding variables.[ADDRESS_205109] 
size was moderate (Cohen’s d = 0.44). Based on qualitative data collected in bot h studies, w e learned that 
face- to-face sessions were more effective than  telephone sessions , so we moved to using virtual technology.   
 In preparation for this proposal, we conducted three  pi[INVESTIGATOR_175801] . We first enrolled seven homebound female spouse caregivers of HF patients and interviewed 
them to identify stress ors associated with caregiv ing. When we described the planned program, all were 
receptive to the electronic intervention and five of the seven women wanted to participate (“I need help 
desperately ”).71 In the second pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] , we tested four methods of distance communication – telephone, 
tablet ( iPad) with video, laptop computer with video and a detachable webcam, and touchscreen videophone. 
The iPad facilitated privacy by [CONTACT_175875] a private place while conversing and was 
preferred over other devices (“the iPad is just less threatening”). In the  third study , we assessed feasibility of 
our planned methods and pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -tested the Vi CCY intervention.150 We enrolled four HF caregivers  (white female 
spouses, mean age 66 ± 8.5 years ) and gave each an iPad. Health coaches engaged each caregiver in [ADDRESS_205110] a strong Internet connection.

 We have used virtual technology to deliver numerous interventions, including some of the early work 
using virtual appr oaches  with older adults .138,140 In a field experiment funded by [CONTACT_175876],  
we enrolled 174 elderly diabetic home health patients  and provided a virtual intervention.151 Of th ose who 
refused, only 12% said the technology  was too complicated, in spi[INVESTIGATOR_175803] -generation 
technology that was far more complicated than that proposed in this study  – a virtual technology  approach with 
tablets. Satisfac tion with this delivery method was high. Our research staff has extensive experience in setting 
it up and  instructing those having no knowledge of tablets  to become proficient in its use.138,139,151-153  
C.3. Study Overview  (Figure 2) . We will use a RCT design to achieve robust and unbiased results , as 
detailed below . We will enroll 250 informal HF caregivers and, when possible, the HF patients for whom they 
care. After collecting baseline data,  we will block randomize the caregivers  1:1 to the intervention or control 
group, stratify ing randomization by [CONTACT_175877] (e.g., spouse, adult child)  – 
factors known to influence caregivi ng burden, 
perceived stress, and receptivity to the 
intervention.8,[ADDRESS_205111] 
caregivers  in both conditions  to the Internet so 
they can access the Internet  site providing 
Health Information (HI)  content, which will be 
the only  content provided to caregivers in the 
control group. In addition  to HI , the intervention 
group will receive 10 front-loaded sessions of 
ViCCY  over 6 months . Assessments of self -care, perceived stress, copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and health status will be co nduc ted 
at baseline (after enrollment but prior to randomization) and by [CONTACT_1555] 3, 6, [ADDRESS_205112] modeling framework, we will assess intervention efficacy  at 6 months  using 
intention- to-treat analysis . We chose to provide 10 health coaching sessions based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_175804] a shorter duration of health coaching  is not routinely effective.21 We chose to 
assess the primary aim at 6  months based on prior psychosocial intervention studies ,83,125,155 but w e will 
assess outcomes at 3 -month intervals  based on this  rationale: baseline (enrollment) , to generate consistent 
profiles of all enrollees at a consistent point in time and prior to implementation of the new intervention; at 3 -
months , very early effects, at 6 -months,  short -term effects; and at 12-months , the longer -term effects of ViCCY 
vs. HI. These 3- month intervals also will allow us to compare our results with others.156,[ADDRESS_205113] PD/PI: [INVESTIGATOR_175792], BARBARA J

C.4. Sample.   
C.4.a  Recruitment . We will enroll a consecutive sample of  informal HF caregivers  identified from the Penn 
Heart and Vascular Center  (PHVC) , the largest out-patient HF clinic  in the Philadelphia region and a site at 
which the PI [INVESTIGATOR_175805] . In 2017, there were 
5344 HF patient visits (mean 445 visits per month ). Of these, approximately 832 we re new HF patients (mean 
69 new patients per month). In a prior study at this site , we enrolled 139 HF patients over 18 months ; 84% of 
the screened and eligible patients enrolled.142 These 139 HF patients (45% female, 34% non- White, mostly 
Black) all lived at home with a family caregiver .   
 If recruitment  is slow er than expected, we will identify caregivers visiting HF patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_175806] (UPHS) sites, all of which use a single, integrated EMR with 
the level of f inancial data needed to address our cost -effectiveness aim. The Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_133199] (HUP) has 789 licensed acute care beds. Between July 2016 and July 2017, HUP admitted 1,859 HF patients. Presby[CONTACT_51616] (PMC) has 331 patient beds and admitted 1 ,621 HF patients in 
that year. Pennsylvania Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (PAH) has [ADDRESS_205116] caregivers and 
70% of these (63 caregivers) will be eligi ble, and 15% will enroll . Thus, we estimate enrolling [ADDRESS_205117]  
40 caregiver -patient  dyads ; [ADDRESS_205118] clinical 
information and track events  and, in the case that patients receive care outside the Penn health system, for the 
caregiver to report on patient health care resource use.  HF patients will not receive an intervention. If a 
caregiver  agree s to participate but the HF patient does not , we will still enroll the caregiver . It is not possible (or 
desirable) to exclude caregivers of patients with comorbid illnesses that may increase caregiv ing demand 
given the high prevalence of comorbid conditions in HF patients .162-164 Thus, whenever possible we will also 
gather EMR data on patients’ comorbid illnesses  using the Charlson Index categories of mild, moderate, or 
severe165 for use as a covariate in analyses.   
 Based on our prior studies, w e anticipate enrolling a diverse sample, with many in vulnerable racial, 
socio -economic, and geographically disadvantaged gr oups.160,166,[ADDRESS_205119] a study Research Assistant (RA) on 
site during PHVC clinic hours and anticipate that m any i nformal caregivers will be screened and enrolled 
during a HF patient clinic visit  because meet ing in person is anticipated to maximize enrollment .169 To obtain a 
consecutive sample we w ill seek a HIPAA waiver to screen the daily appointment schedule to identify every 
patient with a potentially eligible caregiver (e.g., living within 50 miles of the research office). Clinic staff will 
identify potential caregiver participants (e.g., speak  English) and determine  their interest in speaking with 
research staff about the study. If caregivers agree to speak with research staff, the RA will explain the study 
and screen the caregiver for inclusion and exclusion criteria with standardized testing (e.g., self-care) and 
interview (e.g., hearing).  Fully eligible caregivers who provide informed consent (see Human Subjects)  will 
complete the baseline assessment  (Section C. 9) before being randomized to study arm.  Table [ADDRESS_205120] 8 hours/week

If the caregiver is not able to complete the baseline assessment at the time of the clinic visit  or during the 
patient’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a home visit will be scheduled to complete baseline data collection. After all baseline 
data are collection, the caregiver will be randomized to study arm. At that time, participants will be trained in

of health care resource use and cost.   
C.4.c  Consideration of Sex as a Biological Variable . In accordance with NIH guidance, we will include sex 
as a biological variable i n study design (block randomization of men and women to each group), analyses , and 
reporting. We will report all primary and secondary outcomes separately by [CONTACT_175878]. We expect to enroll more female than male caregivers because most HF 
caregivers are female55 and support interventions are more appealing to women.[ADDRESS_205122] a focus

(e.g., spouse)  – factors shown to influence perceived caregiving burden176 and receptivity to intervention.[ADDRESS_205123] Manager  will notify the study staff and participants of their group assignment  (ViCCY or HI  only) by 
[CONTACT_756], email or message, as preferred  by [CONTACT_39359]. Although balance in sample size can be achieved 
with block randomization, the groups may not be fully comparable on other factors . Initial comparison of the 
groups  will allow us to  control  for important  covariates in the analys es.[ADDRESS_205124] Care –  Health Information (HI) . Caregivers in both the intervention and control 
arms will receive augmented standard  care content (HI) through the Internet. Standard care typi[INVESTIGATOR_175807], intermittent outreach by [CONTACT_175879]’  offices , but there is evidence that caregivers ’ 
needs  are not  met with this approach .16,[ADDRESS_205125] care (HI) in this study  will be based on 
informational resources from the [LOCATION_006] National Health Service ( http://www.nhs.uk/pages/home.aspx ). This rich 
Internet site (see Section C. 7 for Internet availability)  has educational pages on hundreds of conditions. The 
site offers self -help books and free self -help computer exercises designed for stress reduction  and healthy self -
care.  For instance,  one module,  Mood zone,  teaches  stress management  skills  with an interactive game, 
anxiety assessment, a downloadable relaxation audio, workbook, and feedback assessment. Using flashed diagrams and online exercises, Mood zone illustrate s the relationship between thoughts and emotions and 
works through the process of dealing with stress. Relaxation and meditation techniques are described. Live 
Well provides excellent, updated content on diet, exercise, substance abuse, immunizations, etc.  If a 
participant wishes  to use the self -help books —equivalent in content —instead of or in addition to the online 
materials or in addition, we will p rovide those materials . Participating caregivers in both study arms  will be 
encouraged to spend at least 30  minutes weekly  using the Internet modules or books for six months  and will 
receive monthly reminder cards by [CONTACT_2319]. We will track participant use of the website using Google Analytics , 
and those  who are not using the website will be telephoned and reminded  to do so. Those who choose to use 
books rather than the website will be asked to keep track of t he number of book chapters reviewed each 
month. Use of the website or book chapters will be used as a  measure of fidelity  in both arms  (see Section 
C.8). After  six months , we will pi[INVESTIGATOR_175808] (both groups) to minimize  bleeding of the intervention 
into the follow -up period, and w e will continue to track use of the website to identify if bleeding occurs.

receive 10 front-loaded sessions of virtual  health coaching by [CONTACT_175880] (Section C. 6.a) over 6 months with 
content based on the theoretical framework and our prior research ( Table 3 , next page ). As shown in Figure

rather than intensifying demand and burden ,71 thereby  [CONTACT_175881]’  ability to respond to stressors

and emotions with the knowledge, skills, and beliefs needed to engage in healthy behaviors.183-186  We discuss 
goal-setting and action- planning in early sessions. Consistent with motivational interviewing , information (e.g., 
reasons for specific  patient behavior) is  given  only if and when the caregiver is receptive to it.  
 A series of sessions is provided with the goal of achieving a lasting effect .[ADDRESS_205127] for differential 
effectiveness based on the dose received. If a brief check -in call becomes an intervention session, it will be 
tracked for use in analysis. We will mail monthly newsletters  to maximize ret ention (see Recruitment and 
Retention Plan) . Because w e found that early and intense contact [CONTACT_175883], 
engag es the participant in the treatment program ,189 and maximizes outcomes,190 we will front -load the 
intervention sessions ( Figure 3). Consistency  is important for trust building, behavioral change, and growth,[ADDRESS_205128] three  years of clinical Table 3.

research procedures begin. Caregivers will be left with a step -by-step manual and the research office phone

computers and ensure that it functions properly.  We will provide a camera for anyone in the ViCCY arm  who 
wishes to use her/his  own computer. If their personal technology proves to be inadequate, we will offer a tablet 
to ensure access to the website and the intervention.   
 ViCCY  sessions will be provided entirely by [CONTACT_98991]- conferencing technology . A secure cloud account will 
be set up for the ViCCY  session s, which will begin within one week of set -up. As described previously, w e 
have conducted several funded clinical trials using virtual technology that illustrate our experience with 
installing, teaching, trouble shooting, using,  and evaluating such  applications in participants’ homes.139,203-[ADDRESS_205132] all of these studies involved older adults . This experience taught us that the devices are easy to install

caregivers’ expectations are influencing outcomes, caregivers  in both groups will complete the Outcome 
Expectancy and Treatment Credibility Scale212 at baseline and 6 month s to facilitate  data interpretation. This  
scale has good internal consistency (α=0.85) and has been used in numerous prior studies, including trials in 
which an intervention is  delivered by I nternet.213,214

cover  to enhance treatment quality and consistency  
• Use a software program to monitor use of the HI website  
Plan for Implementation Setbacks   
(e.g. coach  drops out)  • Hire 2 RNs, maintain a pool of qualified RNs so that new ones can be trained as 
needed 
• Track attrition (Research Assistants (RAs), RNs, participants) and reasons for dropout  
Coach  Training  
Standardize training to ensure that it is 
conducted similarly for all RNs. Train 
RNs to well -defined performance criteria  • Train RNs together using standardized training manuals and the same instructor  
• Design training to accommodate individual styles while assuring standardization  
• Specify performance criteria a priori   
• Provide remedial training immediately when problems are detected  
Treatment Delivery  
Monitor and control for treatment 
differences  • Monitor a ll encounters, with deviations from protocol addressed quickly  
• Assure that a single RN is assigned to provide ViCCY for each caregiver for continuity  
• Randomly choose [ADDRESS_205133] and rate for fidelity  
• Provide routine supervisory oversight using fidelity ratings to minimize decay or drift  
• Assure that RNs s elf-monitor, completing an intervention log after each contact

central resource for data processing and management.  REDCap is a web application and back -end database 
model designed to support data capture for research.[ADDRESS_205142] operating procedures to guide all data management activities, such as the 
naming of variables, data cleaning and handling of missing data. Missing fields will not be allowed except in certain pre- specified cases (e.g., income).  
C.13. Power. We will enroll 250 caregivers (125 caregivers per  study arm) t o achieve over 90% power to 
detect significant overall differences in longitudinal profiles between the groups on the primary outcome of Health Self -Care Neglect Scale.
35 Assuming estimates similar to those in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299], and extrapolating 
through 6 months, along with control group scores that also decline over time (due to interaction that comes 
with participation in a clinical trial) but at a slow er rate than the intervention, it is assumed that ViCCY  
caregivers will demonstrate mean Health Self -Care Neglect scores of 3.2, 1.25, 1.1 while HI caregivers will 
demonstrate mean scores of 3.2, 3.0, 2.7 at baseline, 3,  and 6  months, respectively. Combini ng the two data 
sets, th is translates  to mean scores of 1.85 and 2.97 (D=1.12) overall for intervention and control group 
caregivers, respectively —in line with a clinically meaningful difference equal to 0.4*SD (SD 2.8)=1.[ADDRESS_205143] deviations (pi[INVESTIGATOR_175819] 2.5 and 1.3 at baseline and 3 months) 
are c onstant over time, equal to 2.8, and that the variance- covariance matrix pattern is generated using a 
mixed effects model design (congruent with the primary analytic plan) with a first -order auto -correlation 
parameter equal to 0.3. A design with three asse ssment points and 100 participants per group (200 total) 
achieves 99% power to test the overall between- group effect (intervention vs. control without regard to 
changes over time), 99% power to test the overall time effect, and 90% power to test the group x time interaction effect. All tests are based on simulations with 100 iterations, a 5% significance level, mean vectors 
and variance- covariance as described above. We anticipate 20% attrition based on our prior experience with 
the intervention, which was found to be helpful, supportive, and stress relieving  rather than burdensome. 
Further, we will remunerate caregivers for their time and effort (see Human Subjects).  
C.14. Data Analysis Plan.  All analyses will use an intent -to-treat approach. Descriptive st atistics will be used 
to characterize the sample, with measures of central tendency and variation for continuous measures, and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables . Distributional properties will be examined to determine if 
variance stabil izing or normalizing tra nsformations should be applied. Non -inferential interim analyses will be 
performed to ensure data collection and archiving procedures are operating correctly. Outliers will be assessed 
by [CONTACT_175888]. Once the database is locked, c omparisons by [CONTACT_175889] -collinearity and areas requiring statistical adjustment. For comparisons involving 
continuous variables, homoscedasticity will be evaluated using Levine’s tests. N ormality will be assessed using 
Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152]- Wilk tests. Should violations emerge, transformations will be applied or non -parametric tests used.  
 While every effort will be made to obtain complete data on every participant , some missing data are  
inevitable.254 The underlying mechanism —missing completely at random (MCAR), nonignorable or not missing 
at random (NMAR) —will be evaluated prior to adjusting to minimize bias from missing data.255-[ADDRESS_205144]  missing data to  be MCAR (e.g., finding data collection burdensome). However, systematic bias may exist

primary hypotheses will be tested using the complete observed data. If missing observations cannot be 
assumed to be MCAR, more complex approaches will be considered such as shared parameter models260 or 
random pattern -mixture models.261-263 Sensitivity analyses for these models will be performed.264 These 
approaches assume that participants  dropped out for either informative (e.g., illness exacerbation) or non -
informative reasons (e.g., withdrawing consent). If dropouts are informative, we will adjust for this potential bias 
by [CONTACT_2359] a covariate(s) into the analysis to help to explain why participants  dropped out early.  
 To assess changes in each of the primary and secondary outcomes  over time, separate mixed effects 
regression models will be generated with SAS Proc Mixed .265 We are not powered for secondary  outcomes  
(e.g., stress, copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], health status), but we will examine  effect sizes and confidence intervals  (CIs)  to 
determine if lack of power is driving nonsignificant  result s. Mixed models can account for correlation between 
repeated measures and handle non- excessive MAR or MCAR data better than traditional models and allow for 
use of time- independent and time -dependent covariates.[ADDRESS_205147] appropriate covariance structure will be examined. 
Scores will be analyzed as repeated observations, with mean- centered baseline outcome scores serving as a 
covariate. Other predictor variables will include group, assessment time, and the interaction of group time  
(primary effect of interest) . Baseline measures  and group will be analyzed as time- independent covariates . The 
evaluation of differences in outcome profiles over time according to group  will rely on the group x time 
interaction terms, while differences by [CONTACT_175890]- effects modeling of higher

C.14 .2. Aim 2:  To estimate the cost and cost -effectiveness of ViCCY over [ADDRESS_205149] H2a : Higher QALYs measured with the SF- 6D 
derived from the SF- 36;40 and H2b:  Lower health care resource use.  The primary outcomes of this analysis 
include the difference in c osts (intervention cost minus cost offsets), the difference in QALYs  measured with 
the SF- 6D,[ADDRESS_205150] effectiveness ratio (the difference in costs divided by [CONTACT_175892]). Costs will include both the costs of intervention implementation (number and l ength of intervention 
contacts , RN time to assess need for and delivery of the intervention, technology expenses, supervision time, 
and initial training) . Cost offsets include the  costs of health care (detailed below) and the difference in 
workplace productivity collected for both study groups . QALYs will be used to assess effectiveness. We 
hypothesize that compared to HI, ViCCY will require more resources for intervention implementatio n, but will 
reduce use of other health care resources. It is unclear if the changes in health care resource  use or labor 
productivity  will fully offset the intervention implementation costs (leading  to a finding of dominance: lower cost 
and greater effect)  or if net costs will be positive ( leading  to a finding of cost -effectiveness). We will follow a 
micro -costing approach in which all clinically relevant resources used in the study groups  will be tracked and 
converted to costs using appropriate price weights.   
 We will obtain and summarize all health care use and convert it to payer costs (i.e., a payer’s 
perspective) by [CONTACT_175893]. Many, if not most, of the anticipated participants will be over [ADDRESS_205151] -Effectiveness in Health and Medicine.98 Resources and 
costs associated with researc h and data collecti on will be excluded from analyses. Sensitivity analyses will be

using  the Pearson correlation test, the Pregibon link test, and the modified Hosmer and Lemeshow test , and 
families selected using  the modified Park test.276 Estimates of average total treatment costs and QALYs will be 
generated separately for each group . Non -parametric 95% CIs  will be determined for group differences in 
mean total costs using empi[INVESTIGATOR_175823] (1,000 iterations) generated with bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_175824].277,[ADDRESS_205153] -
effectiveness ratio. Reported measures of sampling uncertainty for this ratio will include 1) the plot of the joint 
distribution of the difference in cost and effect on the cost -effectiveness plane, 2) the confidence interval for the 
cost-effectiveness ratio calculated by [CONTACT_175894]’s theorem method, and 3) the acceptability curve.[ADDRESS_205154] uncertain precision.98 As more than one approach is often available to monetize outcomes, we 
will calculate a lower and upper bound estimate, as  relevant, for the benefit (QALYs) and cost calculations. We 
will combine this series of sensitivity analyses to form a lower and upper bound estimate for preliminary ICER.  
C.14.3. Aim 3 ( Exploratory ): To explore the effect of caregiver  outcomes  (self-care, stress, copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
health status)  on HF pati ent outcomes.  We hypothesize that at 12 months, HF patients whose caregivers 
improve vs. not improve in self -care (regardless of group) will have H3a: Lower hospi[INVESTIGATOR_14285]; H3b:  
Fewer hospi[INVESTIGATOR_598]; H3c: Lower mortality rates; and H3d:  Higher QALYs  measured with the SF- 6D.[ADDRESS_205155] over time, and accounts for the likely 
correlations of the repeated outcome measures for each participant.  An approach similar to that described for 
Aim 1 will be used within the GEE framework (different correlation structures will be examined, baseline 
outcomes will be included as a covariate) .  
 We will measure t ime to death from date of the caregiver’s enrollment in the study to the date of patient 
death.  Patients remaining free from an event will be censored at their last follow -up. Kaplan- Meier estimates 
will be plotted to provide a visual demonstration of time to death by [CONTACT_19313] (categorized caregiver outcomes) , 
and the log- rank test will be used for comparisons . GEE and frailty type multivariable modeling  will be applied 
to time -to-event data within the context of equally spaced time i ntervals .279-[ADDRESS_205156] interaction term (primary effect of interest) . Statistically significant findings will be concluded on the 
basis of a two- sided 0.[ADDRESS_205157] of caregiver outcome on HF 
patient outcomes in patient -caregiver dyads using the Actor -Partner Interdependence Model.282 
C.15. Methodological challenges. We hav e considered the following methodological challenges:  
1. There is the possibility of  differential compliance with the protocol –  for instance, if the HF patient has an 
exacerbation that distracts the caregiver and interferes with the intervention or assessments. We will allow 
some flexibility in the timing of ViCCY sessions to accommodate such events and increase the 
generalizability of study results. Caregivers in the ViCCY arm will be able to schedule calls with the RN 
coach during day, evening, and weekend hours to limit stress from study participation. For both arms, we 
will allow data collection calls to be completed up to two weeks before or after the planned contact [CONTACT_175895]. We will collect data on cancelled and delayed events for l ater analysis and adjust 
for delays and the dose of intervention received in analyses.  
2. A threat to validity  includes the potential for the control  group to receive a level of natural support sufficient 
to interfere with our ability to detect treatment eff ects from ViCCY.[ADDRESS_205158] stressed and bur dened caregivers who may see the trial as one 
more demand; however , in pi[INVESTIGATOR_175825].  
4. It is possible that the patient could die during the year in the study; half of all HF patients die within [ADDRESS_205159] PD/PI: [INVESTIGATOR_175792], BARBARA J

Recruitment and Retention Plan  
 
We plan to enroll a consecutive sample of 250 informal caregivers (125/arm)  of heart failure 
(HF) patients  (HF caregivers). The main enrolment site is  the Penn Heart and Vascular Center 
(PHVC), the largest outpatient HF clinic in the Philadelphia region and a site at which the 
Principal Investigator ( PI) has established relationships and success in past recruitment of 
participants.  If recruitment is slow er than expected, we will identify caregivers visiting HF 
patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_175860] (UPHS) sites .  
 
We anticipate identi fying [ADDRESS_205204] caregivers and 70% of 
these (63 caregivers) will be eligible, and 15% will enroll. Thus, we estimate enrolling [ADDRESS_205205] ( EMR ) to collect clinical information and track events and, in the 
case that patients receive care outside the Penn health system, for the caregiver to report on 
patient health care resource use . At the end of the study period (12 months), the HF patients will 
be asked to provide data on quality adjusted life years (QALYs).  
 
We will have a study Research Assistant (RA) on site during PHVC clinic hours so that the RA 
can meet the informal caregiver  in person because we anticipate that a face- to-face meeting will 
maximize enrollment . We plan to seek a HIPAA waiver to screen the daily appointment 
schedule to identify every patient with a potentially eligible caregiver (e.g., living within 50 miles 
of the research office). [CONTACT_115870], a co -investigator on the study, will ask clinic staff to identify 
potential caregiver participants (e.g., speak English) and determine their willingness to  speak  
with research staff about the study.  
 
To facilitate the engagement of clinic staff, we will meet with them before the study begins to tell 
them about the study. We will bring lunch to compensate their time in talking with us . We will 
use that forum to build enthusiasm about the study. We wil l hold similar events throughout the 
enrollment period to assure that engagement of staff in enrollment does not wane. During these subsequent events, we will update the clinic staff on our progress.   
 
We will prepare informational materials for the clinic  staff to use to engage the interest of 
informal caregivers. These materials will use clear and simple language with graphics  that 
portray caregivers of diff erent ages and races . We will place these materials in the waiting 
rooms, at the front desk, and in all the examination rooms. Research staff will make  sure that 
these materials are consistently available.  
 If we need to enroll from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_175861] , an 
RA will be available in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_175862]. We will obtain a HIPAA waiver to allow us t o screen the daily admission log 
to identify every HF patient with a potentially eligible caregiver (e.g., living within 50 miles of the 
research office). We will engage hospi[INVESTIGATOR_175863] a manner to that described above for clinic 
staff.

 Page [ADDRESS_205206] a dedicated telephone number and email  address for potential participants to learn more about the study . 
Anyone who contacts us in this manner will receive a response within 48 hours.  
 If we find that we are unable to recruit a diverse racial/ethnic sample , we will identify additional 
community agencies  and other clinics that serve different racial and ethnic populations. We will 
work with staff at those clinics t o facilitate successfully on-site recruitment . Recruitment flyers 
will reflect images and language that speak  to a diverse population.  
 Our training of staff will emphasize good clinical practice in working with study participants. Staff 
training will include developi[INVESTIGATOR_175864] (cultural awareness, knowledge, and skills) in working with diverse populations, participant rec ruitment, and follow -up activities. Our goal is 
to minimize language and communication problems to support retention and engagement. For example, we will make sure that the reading materials are written at a basic reading level. Print 
will be sufficiently large to accommodate age-related vision changes. Regular staff meetings will 
provide further opportunity for continued cultural competency training and discussion.  
 
From experience, we recognize that identifying the ideal way to recruit participants is 
challenging. Issues that impede enrolment include lack of staff engagement, resistance from 
unexpected sources, and RA staff turnover. We will meet with research staff at least weekly to 
monitor these issues and any others that arise. We will monitor our processes intensely until we 
have identified a successful method of enrolling caregivers. Thereafter, we will continue to 
monitor our processes regularly.  
 
Retention 
Once enrolled, it is important that we keep participants in the study for the full [ADDRESS_205207] ain the 
requirements of the study to all participants.  We will specify that we need to speak with them 
every 3 months, asking “ What is the best way for me to contact [CONTACT_10825]?”  We will o btain several 
phone numbers (home, work, and cell) and an email address whenever possible so that we  can 
follow up with them easily.  We will b e flexible when scheduling appointments. We will carefully 
train the RAs to be polite, thoughtful, and sensitive to the stresses these informal caregivers are 
experiencing.  
 
We will mail a regular newsletter that report s the progress of the study  to keep the participants 
engaged. We will write this newsletter it in such a way that it can be distributed to participants in 
both the intervention and the control groups.  
 
We will s end participants small tokens of appreciation that will remind them of the study: 
birthday cards, refrigerator magnets  and pens  with the study logo,  etc. For remuneration, we 
chose a market model of payment where the amount serves as an incentive rather than a 
reward. The advantage is more rapid recruitment and avoidance of subject financial sacrifice. 
Further, a completion bonus encourage s subject retention. Using this model, caregivers will 
receive $25 at enrollment, $50 after the 6-month data are provided, $[ADDRESS_205208] PD/PI: [INVESTIGATOR_175792], BARBARA J

are provided, and $100 when they complete the study  for a total remuneration of $[ADDRESS_205209] procedures planned and itemized in the research strategy for monitoring intervention 
fidelity. We anticipate that many of these procedures (e.g. health coach consistency for each 
participant in the intervention) will facilitate retention of participants.   
 
At the end of the study, we will distribute research results to all participants in formats  that are 
useful to the different  communities involved (e.g., participants, families of  participants, and 
referring practitioners ). For participants,  we will explain how the findings may ultimately improve 
their health.  For health care practitioners, we will summarizes the findings  succinctly to 
accommodate their busy schedules .

HUMAN SUBJECTS  
This Human Subjects Research meets the definition of ‘Clinical Research’.  
Protection of Human Subjects 
Human Subjects Involvement, Characteristics, and Design . In the proposed RCT we will enroll adults who are 
informal caregivers of adults  with heart failure (HF) and the HF patients they care for. The study focuses on the 
caregivers, but we will also enroll all willing HF patients to address our exploratory aim. We will seek HF patient 
consent to review their medical records for factors ant icipated to add to the demand of caregiving (e.g.,  number 
of comorbid conditions)  and health care resource use. QALYs will be collected from consenting HF patients.  
The informal caregivers and the HF patients are anticipated to be primarily older adults because HF is a 
condition affecting primarily elders. I n our most recent study of this population, the mean age of HF patient 
participants  was 62 ± 12.[ADDRESS_205211] 
scale ;1 we will enroll only those who are poor in self -care using a cut -point of ≥[ADDRESS_205212] be able to provide informed consent (spea k English, see, hear, cognitively intact) and 
complete the protocol. We recognize that we may need to make a home visit to complete enrollment and/or set up tablets, so caregivers must live within [ADDRESS_205213] caregivers are women and this type of intervention is more appealing to 
women.
2 Recruitment efforts will focus on enrolling a sufficient number of men so that we can analyze sex -
based differ ences in response to the intervention. We will balance sex and the nature of the relationship 
through block randomization to groups as we enroll. We will not include caregivers of children with HF; HF in a child is unusual. No caregivers who are < [ADDRESS_205214] Manager . Both 
groups will receive Health Information (HI) delivered by [CONTACT_165372] ( http://www.nhs.uk/pages/home.aspx ) in 
addition to standard care. The intervention group will receive virtual health coaching (ViCCY) by [CONTACT_175902], with 10 front-loaded health coaching contacts over six months. This dose is based on published 
data demonstrating that six months of health coaching is needed to be effective.  
No other collaborating sites are involved.  
Sources of materials.  The research material obtained from caregivers will be primarily self -report surveys (e.g., 
self-care, stress, health status ) and clinical information such as names of medications. The self-report  
measures will be collected five times over the course of 12 -months  (baseline and 3, 6, 9,  and 12  months ). On 
enrollment, i llness -related information and c aregiver burden will be  measured.  3,4 Quality of the relationship

number, email address if available, and address (needed to arrange data collection if no clinic visit is 
scheduled) will be kept by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_79755]. The research staff directly involved in data collection 
will have access to these data, but in the electronic file all identifying information will be removed and 
participants  will be identified only by [CONTACT_15750]. Only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_175865].  
Potential Risks . Participants  will be monitored continually for the occurrence of adver se events defined as any 
untoward or unfavorable occurrence. Potential risks for caregivers  include fatigue from data collection, stress  in 
response to data collection or some element of the intervention, and loss of confidentiality . The most likely risk  
is fatigue, discussed further below. Patients  are at risk for loss of confidentiality because we will be reviewing 
their medical records. Although the risk of a l oss of confidentiality is possible for both caregivers and patients, it 
is judged to be unlikel y as we are experienced in systems of protecting private information. All data are stored 
behind multiple firewalls . It is monitored regularly, and is accessible only to key personnel who receive private 
network/firewall, server/password, and data director y access rights . Thus , the risk of unlawful penetration is not 
a significant data safeguard concern.  
Fatigue is anticipated in this study ; some caregivers  will be fatigued by [CONTACT_175904] . Survey d ata collection will take place five times and is anticipated to require less 
than one hour. We  have streamlined data collection significantly by [CONTACT_175905]. W e will accommodate  any request to break up the data collection into two 
separate sessions  that can be scheduled up to two weeks apart.  
Stress from data collection and/or the intervention is possible as the  topi[INVESTIGATOR_33722] (e.g. demand of 
caregiving) may cause emotional distress.  Empathy will be emphasized in the training of health coaches as a 
way to minimize distress. All RAs will be trained on how to approach the topi[INVESTIGATOR_75745] a non -suggestive yet 
supportive and empathetic way to minimize distress.  
Adequacy of Protection Against R isks 
Recruitment and Informed Consent . After approval by [CONTACT_4707] (IRB) at Penn, the 
research staff  will work with staff from the HF clinic  to identify eligible caregivers  for referral to us. If enrollment 
from the clinic is slow w e will also look for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_175866]. Once identified, those caregivers will be 
contact[CONTACT_175906]. Those agreeing to 
speak with us will have the study carefully explained to them  by [CONTACT_16133] . Potential participants  will be 
fully informed regarding the interventions and the schedule of the data collection. Those willing to be screened 
will undergo preliminary screening to assess inclusion  and exclusion criteria.  
Written informed consent will be obtained from caregivers  and HF patients . Those who agree to participate will 
be asked to read and sign the consent form with integrated HIPAA  authorization information (i.e., specifics 
about data elements to be collected and use o f the private information). The consent for m will specify that 
some intervention sessions will be audiotaped to ensure the quality of the intervention and judge treatment 
fidelity. We will explain that t hese audiotapes will be transcribed for analysis and then destroyed. The RAs will 
answer questions and make sure that the procedures that are to be used are fully understood.  
As stress from study participation is the most concerning risk to caregivers, we will systematically monitor to 
assure that we identify it. We anticipate that stress may result in early withdrawal so we will monitor withdrawal 
rates methodically in each group. I f a participant  withdraw s, reasons will be carefully noted.  
As data collection is anticipated to require significant comm itment and effort on the part of subjects, 
remuneration will be provided. We carefully considered the amount to pay participants using the guidelines 
from Dickert and Grady.[ADDRESS_205216] 
retention. Using this model, caregivers will receive $25 at enrollment, $50  after the 6-month data are provided, 
$25 after the 9- month data are provided, and $[ADDRESS_205217] PD/PI: [INVESTIGATOR_175792], BARBARA J

$[ADDRESS_205218] likely risk of fatigue during data collection,  we selected 
surveys  that are as short as possible. Completion of the  self-report survey packet requires less than one hour. 
Testing will be scheduled at a time that is convenient for subjects . If participants  are too fatigued to complete 
all measures, sociodemographic and clinical data will be administered at enrollment and the baseline surveys 
will be gathered in a subsequent telephone call  (but before randomization) . All delayed data collect ion will 
occur within a two- week interval. The RAs will be trained to be sensitive to signals from participants  that a 
break is needed during testing. All p articipants  will be informed that they can stop their participation in the 
study  at any time.  For subjects who find data collection too fatiguing, we will offer the option of providing only 
the most essential data reflecting the key outcome variables (e.g., health self-care neglect ).  
Stress . To minimize the risk of stress during data collection the RAs will be trained to be supportive and helpful 
to participants  with questions about data collection. If a participant becomes stressed during data collection 
because of the questions asked, the burden of data collection, or for other personal reasons, data collection 
will be terminated , delayed, or abbreviated to only the most essential items  (e.g. primary outcome variable) . 
Significant stress will be reported to the P roject Manager  who will cont act the caregiver to discuss the issue if 
indicated (the PI [INVESTIGATOR_175867]) . The RAs will be trained to detect any signals that the participant  is becoming 
upset before stress escalates. In a  prior study we hired nursing and psychology students as RAs, which 
facilitated the assessment and management of participant  stress during data collection.  
RAs will be required to have sufficient maturity and background to interact appropriately with ill, aging, stressed 
individuals. The protocol for training of RAs, detai led in our operations manual, addresses enrollment methods 
and the collection of data in a uniform manner.[ADDRESS_205219] Manager will meet weekly or 
bi-weekly with staff (in -person or by [CONTACT_98991]) to discuss issues of enrollment and data collection. All decisions will 
be logged and filed for future reference. All issues will be reported immediately t o the IRB and the Data Safety 
Monitoring Board, as discussed in that plan.  
We will be enrolling a sample  of stressed individuals  and it is possible that we will identify someone  with severe 
distress. We have a previously tested detailed safety plan (Riegel R01HL084394), which has been refined for 
use in this study. This safety plan addresses the concerns associated with severe stress  that need to be 
handled in order to ensure that the research participants’ needs are addressed. This plan includes the 
requirement that research staff undergo training in this safety protocol and participate in ongoing regular 
supervision by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Riegel on these procedures. In addition, for participants randomized to the ViCCY  group, 
specific rules to ensure privacy and s afety will be discussed in the first session, such as being in a private 
place during sessions and not engaging in discussions  while driving.  
Confidentiality . To protect against any risk to subject confidentiality, all printed data forms will be coded wit h 
unique identifiers. The unique identification number will be kept separate from the files with protected health 
information (PHI) to protect subject confidentiality. Every effort will be made to prevent anyone who is not on 
the research team from knowing  what information was collected from a particular subject. As part of the 
consent process, subjects will be made aware of the fact that there are some circumstances where the 
research team may have to provide subject information to other people (regulatory  or legal circumstances).  In 
addition, as we are unable to ensur e total I nternet security , this limitation of privacy will be noted in the 
informed consent . In this manner caregivers will be informed that although it is highly unlikely that anyone 
would ac cess an audiotaped session, the prevention of such intrusions cannot be guaranteed.  The content of 
the intervention sessions is not anticipated to be confidential in nature.  
Data Storage. Since this data storage system is behind multiple firewalls, is monitored regularly, and is 
accessible only to key personnel who rec eive private network/firewall, server/password, and data directory 
access rights, the risk of unlawful penetration is not a significant data safeguard concern. Individually identifiable or deducible data will not be transmitted by [CONTACT_175907], which include the

Internet, email, and electronic File Transfer Protocol (FTP). Further, the data will not be physically moved or 
transmitted in any way from the server without written approval from the project manager. All output containing 
individual identifiable information is treated as confidential data. This information is never transferred 
electronically via email or other protocols.  
All data will be backed up daily and system backups will be done weekly. Batch validity checks will be run on 
the database at periodic intervals to identify data that violate predefined rules. Data will be de- identified and 
stored on the database server with strong access controls, software firewall, secure file transfe r protocols, 
network -wide virus protection software, and daily back -ups. The computers will be password- protected and  
maintained in a secure, locked location at the School of Nursing. Interim checks will be conducted regularly to 
ensure that data collectio n and archiving procedures are operating correctly and security and confidentiality are 
not compromised. A ll information obtained on paper  (e.g., consent forms) will be numerically coded and locked 
in a secure location, as described further below.  
Signed c onsent forms and other subject -specific information containing name s will be kept separate from the 
subject identification numbers. The master list and subject information will be stored in different locked file 
cabinets in the PI’s research offices at the  University of Pennsylvania, School of Nursing. Access to these 
master files will be limited to those directly involved in the study.  
Data will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_175868]. All 
identifying data will be eliminated from files before data are electronically transferred to the biostatistician. As a 
result of aggregation, no individual subjects will be identifiable from the written materials. Audiotaped 
interviews will be assigned a unique identif ier; any identifiable info rmation  in the interviews will be deleted 
during the transcription process.  
Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to Human Subjects and Others  
We cannot guarantee that any participant  will benefit by [CONTACT_4907], although all of the 
caregivers will receive health information. We acknowledge that subject burden may be an issue for these 
already -burdened caregivers . However, we believe that the benefits of the knowledge g ained will outweigh the 
burden and the risks to participants. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board will be used to ensure the validity and 
integrity of the data. We anticipate that the results of this study will benefit society most, by [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_175869].  It is our judgment that benefits outweigh the risk to study 
participants.  
Importance of the knowledge to be gained  
Heart failure is extremely common in the aging population worldwide. The vast majority of these patients are 
limited functionally and living at home with care provided to them by [CONTACT_175908]. Little attention has been 
given to these caregivers . This study has the potential to address this underserved and distressed segment of 
the population  by [CONTACT_175909] a loved one with a 
severe, debilitating, and chronic illness  and refocus their attentions onto themselves (self -care) . If perceived 
stress decreases in caregivers and they ar e able to care for themselves more effectively, this study will provide 
a new and innovative way to increase the support available for these caregivers .

 PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
1.1 Synopsis  
Protocol Synopsis  
Protocol Title  A Randomized, Open -label, Active -controlled Study Evaluating  the Efficacy and 
Safety of Dose Conversion from a Long-a cting Erythropoiesis -stimulating Agent 
(Mircera®) to Three Times Week ly Oral Vadadustat for the Maintenance 
Treatment of Anemia in Hemodialysis Subjects  
Protocol Number  AKB -6548-CI-0039 
Phase of Development  3b 
Indication  Anemia associated with  chronic kidney  disease  (CKD)  
Investigational Product  Vadadustat; 300 mg tablets  
Reference Therapy, as 
applicable  Methoxy polyethylene glycol -epoetin beta (Mircera), F. Hoffman -La 
[COMPANY_002] Ltd.  
Study Population  The study population will consist of subjects ≥18 years of  age and 
receiving chronic, outpatient in -center hemodialysis three times week ly 
(TIW), requiring erythropoiesis- stimulating agent (ESA) treatment and 
are on maintenance treatment currently receiving Mircera and with mean 
of 2 Screening hemoglobin (Hb) values between 8.5 and 11.0 g/dL 
(inclusive).  
Number of Study Sites  Approximately  50 investigative sites in the [LOCATION_002]  (US) at outpatient 
hemodialysis center . 
Planned Number of Subjects  Approximately 450 subjects . 
Rationale  During prior clinical trials, vadadustat has demonstrated dose proportional 
pharmacokinetic (PK) and dose dependent pharmacodynamics (PD). Vadadustat 
showed dose -dependent increases in erythropoietin (EPO) concentrations in 
Phase [ADDRESS_334043] been accompanied by [CONTACT_273524] 
(TIBC) and decreases in hepcidin and ferritin. Overall, the safety profile for vadadustat has been acceptable and has supported  further development.  
Akebia is 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_273510] a treatment for anemia associated with  CKD in adult 
patients. The development program to date included a number of phase 1, 2, and 
3 clinical trials in both populations. A majority of trials studied once daily (QD) 
dosing. TIW dosing is supported by [CONTACT_273525] -PD modelling data.  The rationale for this trial is to obtain 
safety and  efficacy data that supports DD -CKD patients switching from Mircera  
to vadadustat TIW.  
Primary Objectives  The primary objective of the study  is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of 
vadadustat  administered TIW  compared to long acting ESA (Mircera)  for the 
maintenance treatment of anemia in hemodialysis subjects . 
Efficacy  Endpoints  Primary:  
• Primary efficacy endpoint is mean change in Hb between Baseline 
(average pretreatment Hb) and the primary evaluation period (average Hb from Weeks 20 to 26, inclusive).  
Secondary:  
Secondary efficacy endpoint is mean change in Hb  between Baseline 
(average pretreatment Hb) and the secondary evaluation period (average 
Hb from Weeks 46 to 52 , inclusive ).

• Proportion of subjects with Hb <7.0, <8.0, <9.0 , or <10.0 g/dL . 
• Proportion of subjects with Hb increase >1.0 g/dL within any 2- week 
interval or >2.0 g/dL within any 4 -week interval.  
PK/PD Endpoints  The PK  endpoints include the following:  
• Maximum observed concentration (C max)  
• Pre-dose trough concentration (C tau) 
The PD endpoints include the following:  
• EPO 
• Reticulocyte  count  
• Markers of iron metabolism ( including iron, ferritin, total iron binding 
capacity [TIBC]).  
   
Methodology (study design)  A multi -center, randomized, open -label, active -controlled study of the efficacy 
and safety of conversion from long -acting ESA (Mircera) to vadadustat TIW for 
the maintenance treatment of anemia in hemodialysis patients . Following a 
Screening period of up to 8 weeks ( 56 days), subjects who meet all inclusion and 
none of the exclusion criteria , Mircera will be discontinu ed and subjects  will be 
randomized 1:1:1 to vadadustat 600 mg TIW, vadadustat  900 mg TIW , or to 
remain on  Mircera according to the dialysis center’s  protocol . 
Randomization will be stratified by  [CONTACT_273526]: 
Following randomization , there will be  2 periods during the study:  
• Conversion and Maintenance Period (Weeks 0 to 52): conversion to 
vadadustat TIW or to remain on Mircera (Weeks 0 to 20). There will be a primary efficacy evaluation period (Weeks 20 to 26 ) and a secondary 
efficacy evaluation period (Weeks 46 to 52 ). 
• Safety Follow -up Period  (Early Termination [ET]  and Follow -
Up): post- treatment safety follow up visit (ET/End of Treatment  
[EOT]  +4 weeks) either in person or via telephone . 
Study Duration  Individual subjects will participate in the  study for up to [ADDRESS_334044] meet the following inclusion criteria:  
1. ≥[ADDRESS_334045] 12  weeks prior to Screening  Visit (SV)1 .

Safety Oversight  An Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC ) will be established to 
review and discuss the available study data as subjects are enrolled and followed. The IDMC  will meet approximately twice per year throu ghout the course of the 
study. The IDMC will be unblinded and will include, at a minimum  2 physicians  
and a biostatistician. The discussions of the IDMC will include a review of key 
safety data (i .e., AEs, vital sign measurements, and  laborat ory assessments).   
Hepatic cases will be adjudicated by a hepatic panel of experts.  
Statistical considerations  The primary efficacy endpoint is defined as the mean change in Hb between  
Baseline  (average pretreatment Hb) and the primary evaluation period  (average 
Hb from Weeks 20 to 26 , inclusive).  
Akebia Therapeutics, Inc.    Version # 1.0 
Protocol No. AKB -6548 -CI-0039  16 September 2020  
Akebia – Company Confidential  Page 13 of 69    a. General analysis plan  
b. Rationale for number 
of subjects  The primary analysis of the primary endpoint will use the randomized population. 
Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with multiple imputation for missing data 
will be used to calculate the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference in 
mean change in Hb from baseline to the primary evaluation period between the 
vadadustat gr oup and Mircera® control group, with a randomization stratification 
factor and Baseline Hb as covariates.  
Noninferiority of vadadustat will be established if the lower limit of this CI is ≥  -0.75 g/dL . 
A hierarchical testing scheme will be used to correct for the multiplicity 
of the 2 comparisons of the primary efficacy endpoint: comparison between vadadustat TIW 600 mg versus  Mircera and comparison 
between vadadustat TIW 900 mg versus  Mircera .  
• Step 1: comparison between vadadustat TIW 900 mg versus . 
Mirc era  
If the noninferiority of vadadustat is established in step 1, then 
move to the step 2;  
• Step 2: comparison between vadadustat TIW [ADDRESS_334050] deviation for the 
mean change from Baseline will be assumed to be 1.2 g/dL. The noninferiority margin of -0.75 g/dL will be used (for vadadustat minus 
Mircera) . With the 1:1:[ADDRESS_334051] > 90% power with 
consideration of a 30% drop out rate. 
In addition to the final analysis which will take place when all subjects 
have completed study and will include all data collected, the 26- week 
efficacy and safety data may be summarized after the last patient 
completes the primary efficacy period (Week 26). As the study conduct and final analyses of primary efficacy endpoint will not be modified by 
[CONTACT_273528], no alpha adjustment is proposed. The decision about 
whether  this 26 -week analysis would be conducted  and details about the 
analysis will be described in the statistical a nalysis plan  (SAP) .

 INTRODUCTION  
This is an open -label , active-controlled, sponsor-blinded study to determine the safety and 
efficacy of dose conversion from a long-acting erythropoiesis- stimulating agent  (ESA)  (Mircera) 
to three times week ly (TIW) oral vadadustat dosing for the maintenance treatment of anemia in 
hemodialysis su bjects 
3.1 Study Rationale  
During prior clinical trials, vadadustat has demonstrate d dose proportional pharmacokinetic (PK) 
and dose-dependent pharmacodynamics ( PD). Vadadustat showed dose -dependent increases in 
erythropoietin ( EPO ) concentrations i n Phase [ADDRESS_334055] 
been accompanied by [CONTACT_273530] ( Hb) as well as increases in 
total iron binding capacity ( TIBC) and decreases in hepcidin and ferritin. Overall, the safety 
profile for v adadustat has been acceptable and has supported further development. 
Akebia is developi[INVESTIGATOR_273510] a treatment for anemia associated with  chronic kidney 
disease ( CKD) in adult patients. The development program to date included a number of phase 1, 
2, and 3 clinical trials in both populations. A majority of trials studied once daily (QD) dosing. 
TIW dosing is supported by [CONTACT_273531]- PD 
modelling data.  The rationale for this trial is to obtain additional safety and efficacy data that supports dialysis -
dependent ( DD)- CKD patients switching from Mircera to vadadustat  TIW . 
3.[ADDRESS_334056] between 8% to  16% of the population ( Jha 2013 ; KDIGO 2013). At the most advanced stages of 
CKD, end -stage kidney disease,  patients  require chronic dialysis , or kidney tr ansplantation to 
sustain life. Chronic kidney disease is not only a cause of end- stage kidney disease, but is also a 
significant risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) disease, infection, cancer, and mortality 
(Iseki  2007 ). 
The prevalence and severity of renal anemia in CKD increases as renal function deteriorates 
(Di Iorio  2007; Stauffer  2014). As CKD progresses, the combined e ffect of decreased red blood 
cell (RBC) produc tion from lower EPO  signaling, increased rate of RBC destruction, and 
reduced iron availability to the bone marrow results in the increased prevalence and severity of anemia ( Pergola 2016 ). Anemia is defined by [CONTACT_33308] (Hb) is less than 13.0 g/dL in men or 
less than 12.0  g/dL in women ( KDIGO 2012 ). Three principal factors contribute to the 
development of anemia as CKD progresses:  
• Peritubular fibroblasts, a type of cell in the kidney, are designed to sense the amount of oxygen carried by [CONTACT_33428]. These cells produce and secrete EPO to adjust the production of RBCs by [CONTACT_273532] c 
levels. As kidney disease progresses, the number of peritubular fibroblasts is reduced and 
EPO production and secretion is significantly decreased, leading to a reduction in RBC 
production ( Iseki  2007 ; Nurko 2006).

Protocol No. AKB -6548 -CI-0039  16 September 2020  
Akebia – Company Confidential  Page 22 of 69    • On average, the RBCs in CKD patients have a shorter lifespan (approximate lifespan of 
70 days) compared with the RBCs in healthy people (approximate lifespan of 90 to 120 days) 
(Ly 2004; Nurko 2006). Such a condition requires increased RBC production in CKD 
patients to maintain normal physiologic levels.  
• The availability of iron to the bone marrow is impaired. Iron is a required component in the formation of Hb, and is essential for the transport of oxygen to the tissues of the body. 
The main impact of anemia on organ function is reduced oxygen delivery to tissues leading to a constellation of symptoms including fatigue, shortness of breath, and exercise intolerance (Finkelstein  2019). In these patients, compensatory changes occur in cardiac structure and 
function including an increase in cardiac output and the development of left ventricular hypertrophy and eventually the development of heart failure (HF, Metivier 2000).  Other 
consequences from anemia in CKD patients include impaired cognitive function, sleep disorders, and depressed immune function which can impact the quality of life in patients (Iseki  2007 ; NICE 2011).  Overall, anemia contributes to a poorer prognosis in patients with 
CKD (Iseki  2007; Nurko 2006). 
Anemia associated with  CKD has been  treated with ESAs , blood transfusions, and iron 
supplementation. The risks associated with ESAs, including an increased risk of death and CV events  (Besarab  1998 ; Drüeke 2006;  Pfeffer  2009a ; Pfeffer  2009b;  Singh 2006),  highlight the 
need for additional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_273514] r ecombinant protein -based ESAs. Therefore, the unmet medical need for the 
treatment of anemia in DD-CKD patients remains high. To fulfill this unmet need, the vadadustat 
clinical program is focused on developi[INVESTIGATOR_273515].  
3.3 Hypoxia- Inducible Factor Prolyl -Hydroxylase Inhibitors 
Please see the vadadustat Investigator’s Brochure for additional discussion and information for the following section.  
Vadadustat  is a synthetic, orally bioavailable, small molecule being developed as an inhibitor of 
hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl- hydroxylases (HIF -PHs) for the treatment of anemia associated 
with CKD. HIF -PH enzymes are also referred to as prolyl 4 -hydroxylase domains (PHDs), of 
which the [ADDRESS_334057] commonly expressed isoforms are PHD2 and PHD3. Vadadustat inhibits PHD2 and PHD3 . The inhibition of PHD2 and PHD3 stabilizes hypoxia- inducible factor (HIF)-2α and 
HIF-1α, which in turn stimulates the production of EPO. In vi vo animal efficacy and messenger 
ribonucleic acid (mRNA) data indicate that vadadustat induces the production of EPO from both renal and extra- renal sites (liver and brain), and  this increase in EPO results in an increase in 
RBC production in the bone marr ow. In clinical studie s, vadadustat has been shown to facilitate 
iron homeostasis by [CONTACT_273533]. This enables iron transport mechanisms that should 
enhance the ter minal steps of erythropoiesis. Vadadustat may offer the potential of flexible oral 
dosing that provides a more gradual and reliable means of titration than injectable hormones. Therefore, vadadustat is being developed as an alternative to the existing protein hormone ESAs.

15 completed Phase 1 studies in healthy subjects including 1 ethno-bridging study in Caucasian 
and Japanese subjects, 1 completed Phase 1 study in subjects undergoing chronic hemodialysis, 3 completed Phase 2a studies in NDD- CKD subjects, 1 completed Phase 2b study in NDD- CKD 
subjects, and 1 completed Phase 2 study in DD- CKD subjects.  The [LOCATION_002] (US) Phase 2a 
studies evaluated Stages  3, 4, and 5 CKD (not on dialysis) subjects in a single-dose PK study, a 
multi- dose, 28-day, open-label, dose escalation pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], and a randomized, double-blind, 
placebo -controlled study with 5 different dose groups dosed for 42 days. The US Phase 2b, 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated Stages 3, 4, and 5 CKD (pre-dialysis) dosed for 20 weeks. The Japanese Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo -controlled study evaluated Stages 3, 4, and 5 CKD (pre -dialysis) dosed for [ADDRESS_334059] received vadadustat, including 553 healthy subjects, 450 subjects with CKD , and 8 subjects with hepatic impairment. Four additional Phase 
3 studies from Akebia’s co -development partner, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation 
(MTPC) have been conducted in Japan  with NDD- CKD and DD- CKD subje cts. As of 
[ADDRESS_334060] received vadadustat. Two of these studies (J02 and 
J04) have been completed and the clinical study reports (CSRs) are final. The other 2 studies 
(J01 and J03) have reported 24- week primary efficacy and safety data and CSRs for the 24- week 
data are final. The clinical conduct for the 52-weeks of treatment (J01 and J03) has been 
completed and CSRs are pending. One pharmacological study in 61 healthy subjects has also 
been completed (J05). 
Vadadustat has shown dose-dependent increases in EPO concentrations in P hase [ADDRESS_334061]- hoc analyses of the US Phase 2 DD -CKD study 
indicate the potential for an association between higher baseline ESA dose and a lower Hb 
response among subjects converted from ESA to vadadustat. Overall, the safety pr ofile for 
vadadustat has been acceptable and has supported further development. Vadadustat has 
demonstrated consistent bioavailability with area under concentration- time curve (AUC) and 
maximum observed concentration (C
max) in Phase [ADDRESS_334062] increase in subjects 
with NDD- CKD and DD- CKD. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_273516] -life in the CKD group, vadadustat 
plasma concentrations are not expected to accumulate with repeated QD or TIW administration.  
Vadadustat is extensively metabolized  and its metabolites are eliminated from the body by [CONTACT_273534] (both renal and f ecal). The urinary excretion of vadadustat and its metabolites 
has been shown to be less than 60% in healthy human subjects. In a clinical study conducted to evaluate the effect of hemodialysis on the exposures to vadadustat, hemodialysis did not have an

Protocol No. AKB -6548 -CI-0039  16 September 2020  
Akebia – Company Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_334063] been 
examined in healthy subjects. Vadadustat demonstrated dose -proportional PK and 
dose- dependent serum EPO concentrations that returned to baseline levels with treatment 
cessation . A higher incidence of adverse events (AEs) in the gastrointestinal System Organ Class 
(SOC) – nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia – was observed in groups treated with 700, 
900, or [ADDRESS_334064] AEs were mild  to 
moderate, short-lived (1 or 2 days), and assessed as unrelated by [CONTACT_431]. No AEs led to study withdrawal, and no serious advers e events (SAEs) were reported  in healthy subjects . No 
clinically meaningful changes or abnormalities in vital signs, s afety laboratory studies, or 
electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters were reported.  
A 16 -week, open- label, multicenter, Phase 2 study  evaluated vadadustat in 94 subjects receiving 
chronic hemodialysis previously maintained on epoetin alfa and intravenous ( IV) iron f rom the 
3 months prior to Screening. Epoetin alpha was discontinued and s ubjects were assigned to 1 of 
3 vadadustat dose cohorts:  [ADDRESS_334065] 8  weeks; for the subsequent 8 weeks dose was adjusted from 150 to 600 mg according to Hb 
response based upon a dose adjustment algorithm. Sixty -nine of the 94 subjects completed the 
study. The primary endpoint was the mean Hb concentration change from pre- treatment average 
(Screening Visit 1 [SV1], S creenin g Visit 2 [SV2], and Baseline Visit) to mid -study 
(Weeks 7 to  8) and end- of-study (Weeks 15 to  16) and was analyzed using observed Hb values 
(no imputation for missing data). No statistically significant mean change in Hb from pre-treatment average was observed for either of the 2 time points for any of the three treatment groups. 
Among subjects randomized to an initial dose of 300 mg QD, 450 mg QD , or 450 mg TIW, 
0% (0 of 30), 3% (1 of 33), and 19% (6 of 31) of subjects withdrew from the study due to 
worsening anemia, respectively. In a sensitivity analysis using last observation carried forward  
for the primary efficacy endpoint, no significant mean change in Hb from pre- treatment levels 
was observed in the [ADDRESS_334066] been completed or are ongoing. In 
the studies completed to date (Phase 1 and 2 studies), a total of [ADDRESS_334067] received study medication (vadadustat or comparator).  
Generally, in completed vadadustat studies with healthy subjects, there were a low number of 
AEs. The m ost frequently reported AEs in healthy subjects were in gastrointestinal disorders 
(nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, flatulence, dyspepsia) and nervous system disorders (headache, dizziness). The majority of the events were mild to moderate in severity. There were

Akebia – Company Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_334068] frequently reported AEs in subjects with CKD were in 
gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting), CV disorders (hypertension, hypotension, coronary artery disease), renal disorders (renal failure chronic, renal failure acute), infe ctions and 
infestations (gastroenteritis, urinary tract infection, pneumonia), and metabolism and nutrition disorders (hyperkalemia, fluid overload).  
The INNO
2VATE program is the global phase [ADDRESS_334069] relevant to this 
program is the preliminary safety data from Study CI-6548-0017, a study that demonstrated the 
efficacy and safety of vadadustat compared with darbepoetin alfa for the maintenance treatment 
of anemia in subjects with DD- CKD. The Conversion and Maintenance Period of this study was 
from Weeks 0 to 52: conversion to study drug for maintaining Hb (Weeks 0 to 23), primary 
efficacy period (Weeks 24 to 36), and secondary efficacy period (Weeks 40 to 52). 
One thousand seven hundred and seventy- seven  subjects were enrolled in the vadadustat arm of 
Study CI-6548-0017 of which 1768 received vadadustat. Based on these preliminary data, the 
overall incidence of TEAEs was similar between the vadadustat (88.3%) and darbepoetin (89.3%) comparator arm. Common TEAEs (≥5% for vadadustat- treated subjects) are as below:

Drug -related TEAEs were more frequently reported in the vadadustat treatment group (9.6%) 
than in the darbepoetin alfa treatment group (3.8%). Compared to the 5.3% incidence of 
Gastrointestinal disorders SOC in the vadadustat treatment group ( with the most common 
TEAEs being diarrhea [2.2%] and nausea [1.5%]), there was a 0.2% incidence of 
Gastrointestinal disorders SOC with darbepoetin alpha. With the exception  of Gastrointestinal 
disorders SOC, the incidence of drug- related TEAEs is similar between subjects treated with 
vadadustat (4.2%) and darbepoetin alfa (3.7%). 
There were 266 (15.0%) and 276 (15.6%) subjects that experienced TEAEs resulting in death in 
the vadadustat and darbepoetin alfa treatment groups, respectively. The most frequent TEAEs by [CONTACT_273535], and included cardiac arrest 
(2.0% and 2.1%), septic shock (1.3% and 1.2%), and cardio- respi[INVESTIGATOR_13374] (1.2% and 1.3%) 
for the vadadustat and darbepoetin alfa treatment groups, respectively.  
In the vadadustat treatment group, all deaths due to TEAEs were considered unrelated. In the 
darbepoetin alfa treatment group, only 1 death due to TEAE of acute MI was considered related. The TEAEs that resulted in death were similar across both treatment g roups. 
In addition to Study CI-6548-0017, Study CI-6548-0025, a Phase 2, randomized, open- label 
study to evaluate vadadustat for the treatment of anemia in hemodialysis subjects converting from epoetin alfa therapy,  has recently completed the active patien t phase but summary efficacy 
and data are not  available at this time. Subjects who were randomized to vadadustat were treated  
QD from Day 1 to Week 12 and if Week 12 criteria were met, then vadadustat was administered TIW from Weeks 12 to 20. Dose levels of vadadustat administered in this study include

vadadustat group and 88.9% of subjects in the epoetin group completed treatment and 76.7% of subjects in the vadadustat group and 94.4% of subjects in the epoetin group  completed the study. 
Overall, taking into account the entire vadadustat clinical development program, the safety profile to date supports the ongoing clinical development of vadadustat as an orally bioavailable agent for the treatment of anemia associated with CKD.

demonstrated an increased risk of CV events associated with higher Hb targets (Besarab  1998; Pfeffer 2009 a; Singh 2006). Post -hoc analyses performed by [CONTACT_33438] (FDA) and others have shown an association between these adverse outcomes and supraphysiologic serum EPO levels and/or Hb oscillations and overshoots (McCullough 2013; Unger 2010 ).   
In vadadustat nonclinical safety studies, the main findings originated from an exaggerated pharmacological response that results in increased erythropoiesis, polycythemia, blood hyperviscosity, and the formation of fibrin thrombi in multiple organs. Early mortality note d in 
the mouse and rat and moribundity in the dog were due to the sequelae associated with polycythemia. These findings were reproducible across species and studies, dose- depe ndent and 
showed reversibility. Dose -limiting toxicity in the exploratory toxicology studies was due to 
hemoglobinuric nephropathy (rat) and emesis associated with body weight loss (dog). 
In completed Phase [ADDRESS_334072] frequently report ed AEs were in the gastrointestinal 
disorders (i.e., nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, flatulence, dyspepsia) and nervous system 
disorders (i.e., headache, dizziness) SOC.  The majority of AEs were mild to moderate in severity.  
The most frequently reporte d AEs in completed Phase 2 studies of NDD - and DD- CKD subjects 
were in the following SOCs: gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting), 
CV disorders (hypertension, hypotension, coronary artery disease), renal disorders (renal failure chronic, r enal failure acute), infections and infestations (gastroenteritis, urinary tract infection, 
pneumonia), and metabolism and nutrition disorders (hyperkalemia, fluid overload).  Four deaths occurred in the completed Phase [ADDRESS_334073] been reports of drug- induced liver injury (DILI) possibly or probably 
related to vadadustat including one case of Hy's Law probably related to vadadustat. All subjects 
recovered with out sequelae.

Akebia – Company Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_334074] resulted in the following dose restrictions in 
subjects taking vadadustat and concomitant statins: the maximum recommended daily dose of rosuvastatin is 10 mg, and the maximum recommended daily dose of simvastatin is 20 mg.  Review of the Phase 3 safety data did not identify any safety signal for myopathy and/or rhabdomyolysis.   
Other non-important identified risks include abdominal pain, headache, and increased blood uric 
acid.   
3.5.2 Known Potential Benefits  
In studies to date, once-daily oral doses of vadadustat increased mean Hb with fewer  excursions 
above the target range of 10.0 to 11.0 g/dL when compared with darbepoetin alfa . In addition, 
serum EPO levels remained well below those reported with ESAs in the literature. As a result, 
there is the potential for the investigational drug vadadustat to provide an effective and safe therapeutic option for the treatment of renal anemia.  
In addition, vadadustat may enhance iron absorption, transport, and utilization. Phase  [ADDRESS_334075] demonstrated that HIF stabilization downregulates the iron absorption inhibitor hepcidin, and upregulates the iron-mobilizing 
regulators ferroportin and transferrin (and its receptor) ( Peyssonnaux 2007). Potential clinical 
benefits include enhanced erythropoiesis and decreased exogenous iron requirements. 
3.5.3 Overall Benefit: Risk Conclusion  
DD-CKD and associated anemia are serious chron ic conditions with significant morbidity and 
mortality due to the underlying  disease as well as associated conditions (including diabetes and 
cardiovascular diseases including hypertension). Subjects enrolled in this study will be receiving 
chronic, outpatient in-center hemodialysis TIW, requiring maintenance ESA treatment.   
The currently known risks of vadadustat most relevant to the study population are those 
associated with long-term vadadustat treatment in DD- CKD p atients as measured in 
Study CI -6548-0017. In this study, the overall safety profile was similar to that of darbepoetin 
alpha. The overall incidence of TEAEs was similar between the vadadustat treatment group 
(88.3%) and darbepoetin comparator group (89.3%). The most common TEAEs (> 10%) in the 
vadadustat treatment  group were diarrhoea, pneumonia and hypertension. 
Drug -related TEAEs were more frequently reported in the vadadustat treatment group (9.6%) 
than in the darbepoetin alfa treatment group (3.8%). With the exceptional of Gastrointestinal 
disorders SOC (with the most common TEAEs being diarrhea [2.2%] and nausea [1.5%]), the 
incidence of drug related TEAEs was similar between subjects treated with vadadustat (4.2% and 
darbepoetin alfa (3.7%) . 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI, see Section 9.11.8) for vadadustat are malignancy 
including renal cell carcinoma (also see  Section [IP_ADDRESS]), elevation in ALT or AST >[ADDRESS_334076] (also see Section [IP_ADDRESS]), hepatotoxicity, worsening of hypertension, pulmonary 
hypertension, thrombotic events, congestive heart failure and adrenal disorders.

Based on the totality of availa ble in formation for vadadustat in the proposed patient population, 
the benefits outweigh the risks for the proposed study.

 STUDY DESIGN 
5.1 Overall Design 
This is a multi -center, randomized, open- label, active -controlled study of the efficacy and safety 
of conversion from long- acting ESA (Mircera) to vadadustat TIW for the maintenance treatment 
of anemia in hemodialysis patients . Following a Screening period of up to 8 weeks (56 days), 
subjects who meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1:1 to 
vadadustat 600 mg TIW, vadadustat 900 mg TIW, or to remain on Mircera  according to the 
dialysis center’s protocol . 
Randomization will be stratified by  [CONTACT_273526] : 
Following randomization, there will be 2 periods during the study: 
• Conversion and Maintenance Period (Weeks 0 to 52) : conversion to vadadustat TIW 
or to remain on Mircera (Weeks 0 to 20). There will be a primary efficacy evaluation 
period (Weeks 20 to 26) and a secondary efficacy evaluation period (Weeks 46 to 52). 
• Safety Follow- up Period (Early Termination [ET] and Follow -Up): post- treatment 
safety follow up visit (ET/End of Treatment [EOT]  +4 weeks) either in person or via 
telephone. 
5.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
This study will eval uate the efficacy and safety of dose conversion from a long- acting ESA  
(Mircera) to TIW vadadustat for the maintenance of treatment of anemia in hemodialysis 
patients . Numerous studies have demonstrated that hemodialysis subjects requiring higher ESA

Akebia – Company Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_334081] a higher burden of comorbidities, a more inflammatory state, and 
a greater risk of adverse outcomes ( Besar ab 1998; Parfrey  2005; Unger 2010). As described 
above ( Section 3.4) in a Phase 2 hemodialysis study (CI-0011), a post-hoc analysis suggested 
higher pre- baseline ESA doses were associated with lower observed mean Hb levels. Subjects on 
higher pre-baseline ESA doses may benefit from a higher starting dose of vadadustat after initial conversion from ESAs.  
In this study, Mircera  was chosen as an active comparator as it is a  long- acting Continuous EPO  
Receptor Activator (CERA) and therefore can be administered less frequently than short - and 
middle-acting ESAs, while maintaining equivalent efficacy for the treatment of anemia in 
patients with CKD  (Biggar, 2017; Davey, 2018; Mircera  USPI 201 8; Palmer, 2014). Patients 
receiving CERA required less frequent ESA administration, demonstrated smaller decreases in Hb levels, and were less likely to require an ESA dose during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Overall, CERA showed comparable clinical performance to shorter-acting ESAs while reducing dose frequency in CKD patients receiving hemodialysis  (Davey et al, 2018 ). 
This is particularly relevant in the current medical and regulatory climate given the accumulating study findings that resulted in the FDA revising the prescribing information for the currently 
marketed ESAs. These study results indicate an increased risk of death and adverse CV events, 
such as stroke and HF, particularly when using ESAs to achieve a higher Hb concentration. In 
the US, the mortality and CV risks associated with ESAs are outlined in a black -box warning in 
the prescribing information of ESAs, with a recommendation to use the lowest dose p ossible to 
avoid transfusions. While no similar major warnings exist in the European Union ( EU) Summary 
of Product Characteristics (SmPC), there is caution suggested with use of ESAs, and recommendation to keep Hb levels below 12.0 g/dL. C linical practice guidelines ( Locatelli 2013) 
recommend that risk factors fo r stroke and malignancy should also be taken into account when 
making treatment decisions to use ESAs for the treatment of anemia.  
5.3 Justification for Dose  
In this trial, 2 different vadadustat starting doses will be explored. The  starting doses of 
vadadustat will be 600 mg TIW and 900 mg TIW in subjects converting from Mircera. The dose range for titration is 300 to 1200 mg TIW. Vadadustat 750 and 900 mg QD as titration doses are 
being studied in an ongoing Phase 2b trial in DD- CKD subjects and as fixed doses in an ongoing 
Phase 1b trial, DD-CKD subjects. In prior studies, t here was minimal  accumulation of vadadustat 
with repeat ed dosing of up to 900 mg. Given that the half-life of vadadustat in dialysis patients is 
approximately 8 to 10 hours and th e interval between doses will be a minimum of 48 hours 
(approximately 5 times the half- life), it is expected that during TIW dosing, vadadustat will be 
eliminated  from the systemic circulation without accumulation before the subsequent dose. 
Therefore, the exposures with 1200 mg single dose is  likely to be similar to 1200 mg TIW. 
Further, per total weekly dosing, 1200 mg TIW (3600 mg/week) is a lower dosing regimen compared to 900 mg QD (6300 mg/week). The starting doses and the proposed vadadustat Dosing and Dose Algorithm ( Appendix 1) in this study are designed to maintain Hb in a 
predictable and controlled manner while minimizing abrupt increases or exc essive rises in Hb 
levels. Based on plasma concentrations and PD measures from previously conducted clinical studies with vadadustat, a population PK/PD model was developed. Using this model and the proposed dosing algorithm, simulations were carried out t o evaluate the effects of different 
starting doses and the resulting Hb responses to support the dosing rationale. Results of the 
Akebia Therapeutics, Inc.    Version # 1.0 
Protocol No. AKB -6548 -CI-0039  16 September 2020  
Akebia – Company Confidential  Page 32 of 69    simulations indicated that the starting dose s of 300 and 450 mg QD along with the proposed 
dosing algorithm are optimal to maintain Hb levels of 10.0 to 11.0 g/dL in the US and 10.0 to 
12.0 g/dL outside of the US while minimizing excessive rises. The daily dose of 300 mg equates to a weekly dose of 2,100 mg. That weekly dose would equate to 700 mg TIW. The daily dose of 450 mg equates to a weekly dose of 3,150 mg. That weekly dose would equate to 1050 mg TIW. For dosing simplicity, a single dose strength of 300 mg is being used in this study. Therefore, 600 mg TIW (maximum weekly dosing of 1800) and 900 mg TIW (maximum weekly dosi ng of 
2700 mg) w ere selected as starting  dose s for this study. 
Hb monitoring, a dose adjustment algorithm ( Section  7.1.2 and Appendix 1), and phlebotomy 
will be implemented to mitigate the potential risk of a rapid Hb rise, as follows:  
• Hb measurements are scheduled at least every 2 weeks to Week 8  and thereafter every 
4 weeks. 
• The dose adjustment algorithm will target a narrow Hb range, 10.0 to 11.0 g/dL. 
• The protocol specifies that phlebotomy may be considered in the setting of high Hb levels (>14.0 g/dL) or a high Hb rate of rise, based on the investigator’s judgment.

 STUDY INTERVENTION 
7.1 Study Intervention(s) Administration  
7.1.1 Study  Intervention Description  
A multi-center, randomized, open- label, active -controlled study of the efficacy and safety of 
conversion from long- acting ESA (Mircera) to vadadustat TIW for the maintenance treatment of 
anemia in hemodialysis patients. Following a Screening period of up to 8 weeks (56 days), subjects who meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria , Mircera will be discontinued 
and subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to vadadustat 600 mg TIW, vadadustat 900 mg TIW , or to 
remain on Mircera according to the dialysis center’s protocol . 
Randomization will be stratified by  [CONTACT_273526] : 
The minimum dose of vadadustat will be 300 mg TIW and the maximum dose will be 1200 mg TIW.   
Following randomization, there will be 2 periods during the study: 
• Conversion and Maintenance Period (Weeks 0 to 52): conversion to vadadustat TIW or to 
remain on Mircera (Weeks 0 to 20). There will be a primary efficacy evaluation period 
(Weeks 20 to 26) and a secondary efficacy evaluation period (Weeks 46 to 52). 
• Safety Follo w-up Period (ET and Follow-Up): post- treatment saf ety follow up visit 
(ET/EOT +4 weeks) either in person or via telephone. 
7.1.2 Dosing and Administration  
The aim is to achieve and maintain Hb levels within the target range of 10.0 to 11.0 g/dL inclusive, while targeting the middle of the range and minimizing excursions outside the target range. 
Dosing will be initiated at Baseline and the first dose of vadadustat will be administered at the 
hemodialysis unit after other Baseline procedures hav e been completed. Thereafter, vadadustat is 
anticipated to be administered at the hemodialysis unit. Subjects may take vadadustat with or without food and will be instructed to swallow the tablet(s) whole. Subjects are to take vadadustat at roughly the same time each day. 
Mircera will be administered IV at the hemodialysis unit based on according to the dialy sis 
center’s protocol. 
Note : For all subjects, it is recommended that no additional ESA doses will be administered after 
SV2 after the subject has met all eligibility criteria and before Baseline.  For all subjects, it is 
required that a minimum of [ADDRESS_334092] dose of Mircera and the 
Akebia Therapeutics, Inc.    Version # 1.0

Akebia – Company Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_334093]’s Hb level or Hb trajectory or based on timing of last Mircera  dose 
given during Screening and the Baseline visit. 
For subjects who are randomized to the Mircera treatment arm, the initial dosing regimen in the 
study (starting from Baseline) will be according to the dialysis center’s protocol . The timing of 
randomization should align with next anticipated dose of Mircera. 
Study Drug Guidelines for Dose Adjustment 
Dose adjustments will be guided by [CONTACT_273537], interrupted, or maintained.  Mircera 
dosing will be based on standard of care laboratory measures according to the dialysis center’s protocol. 
Guidelines for vadadustat dose adjustment are as follows (see Appendix 1): 
• Dose adjustments are based on the Investigator’s clinical discretion, incorporating the 
protocol guidance below as well as the subject’s current Hb level, trajectory, and 
variability; symptoms; CV risk; and other features of his/her clinical condition(s).  
• If a dose increase or decrease is required to achieve and maintain Hb levels within the 
target range of 10.0 to 11.0 g/dL inclusive, dose is adjusted by 1 dose level 
(vadadustat 300 mg). 
• A one- time dose increase after the first [ADDRESS_334094]’s dose may be increased by 1 dose level (300 mg TIW) if the subject has a decline in Hb ≥0.5 g/dL from Baseline in the first 2 -week period 
(the initial period from Baseline to Week  2 following conversion from 
Mircera ) and if Hb is <10.0 g/dL. 
• Reduce the dose in the setting of a rapid rise in Hb (defined as >1.0 g/dL in any 
2-week period or >2.0 g/dL in any 4-week period).  
• Reduce the dos e in the setting of Hb >11.0 g/dL.  
• Interrupt the dose in the setting of a Hb >12.0 g/dL until H b value falls below 
11.0 g/dL. After Hb falls below 11.0 g/dL, restart study drug at a lower dose.  
The minimum dose of vadadustat will be 300 mg TIW (1  tablet TIW ) and the maximum dose 
will be [ADDRESS_334095] of care.  Dose adjustments will be made according to the 
dialysis center’s protocol .

Investigators will prescribe iro n supplementation (IV , oral or intradialytic) as needed th roughout 
the study to maintain ferritin and TSAT according to the Schedule of Activities (SoA) 
(Section  1.3). The use of iron-based phosphate binders (e.g., ferric citrate) is permitted. 
Important: Subjects  already receiving oral iron supplementation as part of their treatment plan 
may continue their current treatment regimen. Because of the potential for oral iron and phosphate binders to reduce the bioavailability of vadadustat, the trial medication is not to be administered concurrently with an oral iron supplement (including multivitamins containing iron), iron -containing phosphate binders, non- iron-containing phosphate binders, or any oral 
medications containing iron.  Subjects will be instructed to take  any non-iron-containing phosphate binders with a meal at least 
[ADDRESS_334104]  1 hour after the dose of  vadadustat. 
Investigators will prescribe IV iron as needed with dosing according to the dialysis center’s 
protocol. Iron supplementation details will be captured in the appropriate electronic case report 
form ( eCRF ).

Akebia – Company Confidential  Page 39 of 69    7.5.3 OATP1B1/1B3 Substrates (eg, Statins)  
Investigators should adjust the dose of these concomitant medication as follows: 
• Simvastatin, maximum daily dose of 20 mg. 
• Rosuvastatin, maximum daily dose of [ADDRESS_334105] Cancer Resistance Protein  Substrates, and Probenecid  
Exposures to sulfasalazine (moderately) and mesalamine (mildly) were increased with 
co-administration of vadadustat based on a study in healthy adults. In subjects t aking vadadustat, 
sulfasalazine and other clinically relevant substrates of the breast cancer resistance protein 
(BCRP) transporter (e.g., sulfasalazine, methotrexate, mitoxantrone, imatinib, irinotecan, lapatinib, topotecan, tenofovir, glecaprevir, pi[INVESTIGATOR_273519], or sofosbuvir), caution should be taken during the study. 
Probenecid, an inhibitor of U DP-glucuronosyltrans ferase (UGT ) and the organic anion 
transporter ( OAT )1/3 transporters , increased vadadustat area under the curve and is prohibited 
during the study 
7.5.5 Rescue Medicine  
To ensure the safety of subjects and to standardize the use of rescue in the study, rescue therapy 
guidelines are provided. 
 Red Blood C ell Transfusion  
Investigators will use their local institution’s transfusion guidelines when determining whether to 
transfuse a stu dy subject. In general, in the event of an acute or severe loss of blood, a RBC 
transfusion will be adminis tered as clinically indicated. In less severe instances but where there 
may be worsening of anemia or moderate to severe symptoms of anemia, RBC transfusions are permitted at the discretion of the Investigator given medical neces sity. Study drug may be 
continued during the transfusion period. 
Reasons for RBC transfusion will be captured in the appropriate e CRF.  
 Erythropoiesis- stimulating Agent Use 
ESA Rescue administration will be allowed when medically necessary at the discretion  of the 
Investigator or if a subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] . In the setting of ESA rescue therapy, the initial dose of 
ESA rescue therapy may be administered on the same day as the last vadadustat dose prior to 
vadadustat dose interruption if deemed medically nec essary at the discretion of the investigator. 
In general, ESA rescue will be allowed in subjects with Hb <9.0 g/dL, and ESA rescue will be 
stopped when Hb ≥9.5 g/dL. ESA therapy will be administered using an approved ESA and dosing as per the local institu tion’s guidelines and per the approved product label.   
While receiving ESA therapy, subjects randomized to vadadustat must tem porarily interrupt 
vadadustat. A minimum interval will be observed prior to restarting vadadustat after the last dose 
of ESA, and treatment will be resumed after the following minimum intervals:  
• [ADDRESS_334106] dose of epoetin alfa

• [ADDRESS_334108] dose of methoxy polyethylene glycol- epoetin beta (Mircera)  
Following ESA administration , vadadustat will be resumed at the same dose as previously used 
or one dose higher and adjusted according to the dose adjustment algorithms ( Section  7.1.2 and 
Appendix 1) at the discretion of the Investigator.  
Reasons for ESA Rescue use will be captured in the appropriate e CRF.  
 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION AND SUBJECT 
DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL

• AE 
• Missed hemodialysis visit  
• Investigator’s discretion  
• Rapid rise in Hb (defined in Section 7.1.2)  
• Hb above 11.0 g/dL 
• ESA use  
Unless contraindicated, treatment will be resumed whenever possibl e and assessed at every visit 
following study drug interruption. 
8.1.[ADDRESS_334110] their ET visit at the time of permanently

• Investigator’s discretion  
• Subject withdraw al of consent  
• Lack of efficacy  
• Lost to follow up despi[INVESTIGATOR_273520] 
• Death  
• Other reasons (pregnancy, kidney transplantation, specific reasons to be documented by 
[CONTACT_737])  
Lack of efficacy is defin ed as an inadequate response to vadadustat in the Investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649].  
Subjects who undergo a solid organ (including kidney), hematopoietic stem cell, or bone marrow transplantation will have vadadustat permanently discontinued.

Protocol No. AKB -6548 -CI-0039  16 September 2020  
Akebia – Company Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_334112]’s participation in the trial at any time if medically necessary.  
Withdrawal of consent is a critical trial event and, therefore, should be approached with the same 
degree of importance and care as is used in initial ly obtaining informed consent. The reasons for 
a subject’s intended withdrawal need to be completely understood, documented, and managed to protect the rights of the subject and the integrity of the trial.  
Details on the withdrawal of consent from the phar macogenomic (PGx) assessment and/or 
optional future biospecimen research (FBR) substudy are provided in the informed consent form (ICF). 
8.1.[ADDRESS_334113] fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit: 
• The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_273539]/or should continue in the study. 
• Before a subject  is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee will make every 
effort to regain contact [CONTACT_1155]  (where possible, [ADDRESS_334114]‘s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_9300]’s  medical record 
or study file.  
• Should the subject continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow-up. 
• For subjects who are lost to follow-up, the investigator may  search publicly available 
records to ascertai n survival status. This ensures that the data set(s) produced as an 
outcome of the study is/are as comprehensive as possible.

9.10 Safety and Other Assessments  
9.10.1 Adverse Event Assessments  
AE collection will begin from time of signing of the Informed Consent Form (ICF) through 
Safety Follow -up Visit. The investigator and study personnel will review each subject’s 
laboratory and clinical evaluation findings and query the subject directly regarding AEs (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). Subjects must be followed for AEs until the final required protocol visit or 
until all drug -related toxicities and SAEs have resolved (or are considered chronic/stable), 
whichever is later.  
9.10.2 Concomitant Medication Recording  
All medications (both presc ription and non-prescription, and including vitamins, herbals, 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_8593], inhaled, and intranasal), taken during the screening period and throughout the study, ending at the final protocol required visit, should be re corded on the appropriate e CRF. At each 
study visit, subjects will be asked whether they have started or discontinued any medication since their previous study visit. This includes single -use or as -needed medication use.  All 
medications and treatments, including vitamin supplements, over- the-counter medications and 
oral herbal preparations  must be recorded in the e CRFs. Heparin injections or saline flushes, are 
not required to be recorded unl ess relevant for an AE or SAE , however other concomitant 
medications administered in the dialysis unit wil l be recorded. In addition, the ESA, blood 
transfusion, and iron treatment regimen prior to randomization and date of last dose will be recorded.

that emerge during the protocol-specified AE reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with pre-existing underlying conditions that were not present prior to the AE reporting period. In addition, any worsening of a pre -existing condition that occurs during the protocol-
specified AE reporting period is also considered an AE and will be captured as “worsening” of pre-existing condition  
AEs therefore include the following:  
• All AEs, whether suspected to be causally related to study medication  or otherwise  
• All AEs secondary to any medication overdose, medication error, abuse, withdrawal, 
sensitivity, or toxicity  
• Illnesses apparently unrelated to study medication , including the worsening of a pre-
existing illness (see paragraph below on Pre-existing Conditions) 
• Injury or accidents. Note that if a medical condition is known to have caused the injury or 
accident (eg, a fall secondary to dizziness), the medical condition (dizziness) and the 
accident (fall) should be reported as 2 separate AEs.  
• Abnormalities in physiological testing or physical examination findings that require 
clinical intervention or further investigation (beyond ordering a repeat [confirmatory] 
test) 
• Laboratory abnormalities that require clinical intervention or further investigation (beyond ordering a repeat [confirmatory] test) unless they are associated with an al ready 
reported clinical event. Laboratory abnormalities associated with a clinical event reported 
as an AE (eg, elevated liver enzymes in a subject with jaundice) should be described under ‘Comments’ on the report of the clinical event rather than report ed as separate 
AEs.  
The following guidelines are to be used when reporting AEs for this study:  
Medical Diagnoses – Whenever possible, a medical diagnosis term should be used to report AEs 
instead of signs and symptoms due to a common etiology, as determined by [CONTACT_167440]. For example, pneumonia should be the reported AE term, instead of fever and dyspnea, when the diagnosis has been established. Signs and symptoms should be reported as 
event terms only when the medical diagnosis remains u nknown, and revised to a medical 
diagnosis term once it has been established.  
Procedures  – Diagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, 
should not be reported as AEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was 
performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. For example, an acute 
appendicitis that begins during the AE reporting period should be reported as the AE and the resulting appendectomy noted under ‘Comments’. 
Pre-planned therapeut ic procedures not associated with a new medical condition or worsening 
pre-existing condition should not be reported as AEs. Device related events (failures/malfunctions) should not be reported as AEs; however, the 
etiology or complication associated with the device failure/malfunction should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. 
Pre-existing Conditions  – In this study, a pre-existing condition (i.e., a disorder present before 
the AE reporting period started and noted on the pretreatment medical history/physical 
Akebia Therapeutics, Inc.    Version # 1.0 
Protocol No. AKB -6548 -CI-0039  16 September 2020  
Akebia – Company Confidential  Page 49 of 69    examination form) should not be reported as an AE unless the condition worsens or epi[INVESTIGATOR_245897]. 
Abnormal Test Findings – All laboratory test results will be  reviewed by [CONTACT_737]. The  
Investigator will utilize his/her judgment in determining if out-of- range laboratory values are 
clinically significant and will denote this using the abbreviation “CS” on the laboratory report for 
source documentation. Laboratory tests that are labeled as  clinically significant should be 
reported as AEs, either separately or as part of a description of a symptomatic AE.  If there are 
significant changes in a laboratory report from a previous visit that are determined to be clinically significant, these should also be reported as AEs. Any abnormal laboratory value 
which requires treatment or further diagnostic testing and/or results in discontinuation from stud y 
should be reported as an AE. An expected laboratory abnormality from a condition that is part of the medical history is not considered clinically significant for the purposes of the study unless it represents a worsening of the condition. 
Abnormalities in ALT, AST, and Total Bilirubin  – Abnormalities in ALT, AST, and total 
bilirubin should be reported to the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor or CRO designee within 24 hours 
of awareness as an SAE with ‘other medically important event’ criteria selected, if the following conditions are met: 
• New elevation in ALT or AST >[ADDRESS_334120] >[ADDRESS_334121], without  an elevation of total serum bilirubin >[ADDRESS_334122] are identified, the following steps are to be taken: 
• Temporary discontinuation of study medication; 
• Repeat testing of ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ), and total bilirubin, to be 
completed within 48 to 72 hours to confirm the abnormalities and to determine trend; 
• Study medication should not be resumed until monitoring indicates abnormalities have 
resolved or are stable.  
Details on the management of subjects with other ALT and AST abnormalities are further 
described in Section  7.1.3.   
Worsening of Anemia – In this study, it is possible that some subjects may experience a worsening of anemia. As the primary endpoint of this study assesses Hb  response, worsening of 
anemia is captured as part of this efficacy parameter. Worsening of anemia should not
 be 
considered an AE unless the worsening of anemia is associated with a cause other than the 
subject’s CKD.  
Transplantation – During this long- term study, it is anticipated  that some subjects may receive 
a kidney transplant. These events will not be recorded as AEs. Subjects will discontinue study 
medication for receipt of a kidney, other solid organ, hematopoietic stem cell or bone marrow transplant and should continue with the SoA and safety assessments as described in Section  8.1.2. 
Malignancy – During this long-term study, some subjects may develop a newly diagnosed malignancy or a recurrence of a malignancy. At the discretion of the Investigator, these subjects may continue study medication. For reporting of AEs of malignancy, see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Akebia Therapeutics, Inc.    Version # 1.0

 Serious Adverse Events 
Each AE is to be classified by [CONTACT_273542]. An AE that 
meets 1 or more of the following criteria/outcomes is  classified as serious:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening (see below for definition ) 
• In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] (see paragraph below 
on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) 
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (see paragraph below on disability) 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is considered a medically important event not meeting the above criteria, but which may 
jeopardize a subject, or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
criteria listed in this definition.  
In addition to the above criteria for classifying AEs as serious, the following situation will also be classified as serious for purposes of this study:  
• Malignancies – Newly diagnosed malignancies or a recurrence of a malignancy should be 
reported as an SAE with the seriousness criterion “medically important” if no othe r 
seriousness criteria are met. However, i f a subject  develops basal cell carcinoma of skin, 
squamous cell carcinoma of skin, or cervical carcinoma in situ during the study, or has 
worsening of these events from Baseline, the Investigator will determine if the event is 
reported as an AE or SAE. 
Serious also includes any other event that the Investigator or Sponsor judges to be serious. If 
there is any doubt whether the information cons titutes an AE or SAE, the information is to be 
treated as an SAE.  
Life-threatening – Any event in which the subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of 
the event; ‘life -threatening’ does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe. For example, drug-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life threatening, even though drug-induced hepatitis of a more severe nature can be fatal.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] – Hosp italization is defined as an overnight admission with observa tion of a 
minimum of [ADDRESS_334123] event occurs related to the procedure (eg, elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a total 
knee replacement due to a preexisting condition of osteoarthritis of the knee that has not worsened during the course of the study). 
Disability  – Defined as a substantial disruption in a person’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions.

Protocol No. AKB -6548 -CI-0039  16 September 2020  
Akebia – Company Confidential  Page 51 of 69    9.11.2 Classification of an Adverse Event  
 Severity of Event  
The Investigator wi ll assess each AE as either mild , moderate, or severe using the following 
guidelines to describe the m aximum severity of the AE: 
• Mild : Does not interfere with subject's usual function 
• Moderate: Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function 
• Severe: Interferes significantly with subject's usual function  
Note that a severe AE is not necessarily a serious  AE. For example, a headache may be severe in 
intensity, but would not be classified as serious unless it met [ADDRESS_334124] a causal relationship between the study medication  and 
the AE include the occurrence of an AE that is uncommon and known to be strongly associated 
with drug exposure (eg, angioedema, hepatic injury, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome) or an AE that is uncommon in the population exposed to the drug. 
The causal relationship of the AE is assessed using a binary system, and AEs are classified as 
either ‘related’ or ‘unrelated ’; 
• Related: There is ‘reasonable possibilit y’ that the drug caused the AE. The AE follows a 
reasonable temporal sequence from t he time of drug administration. There is supportive 
evidence (facts) to suggest a possible causal relationship, irrespective of the degree of 
certaint y between the observed AE and the drug. 
• Unrelated: An AE does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the product and/or there is no reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE. This 
assessment includes situations where the AE is related to other factors such as the subject’s clinical state, other therapeutic interventions, or concomitant drugs administered to the subject.  
Default assessments using the ‘related ’ category without supportive evidence for a causal 
relationship to study medication  is generally uninformative and do not contribute meaningfully 
to the development of the safety profile of the drug or to subject protection. 
Investigators are encouraged to choose the most plausible cause for the event(s) from the 
following list: medical history, lack of efficacy/worsening of treated condition, study medication , 
other treatment (concomitant, or previous), withdrawal of study medication , administration error,

 Expectedness 
The Sponsor will be responsible for determ ining whether an AE is expected or unexpected. An 
AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event exceeds the 
risk information previously described for the study intervention as descr ibed in the current 
Investigator’s Brochure. 
9.11.[ADDRESS_334125] will be questioned about AEs at each visit following the initiation of treatment.  
9.11.4 Adverse Event Reporting  
9.11.5 Reporting Period  
AE collection will begin from time of signing of the Informed Consent Form (ICF) through Safety Follow -up Visit.  
In addition, any AE that occurs subsequent to the AE reporting period that the investigator assesses as related to the study medication should also be reported as an AE.  
9.11.6 Reporting A dverse Events 
All AEs (serious and non- serious) are to be reported on the A E eCRFs.  
9.11.[ADDRESS_334126] be reported to the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor or CRO designee within 24 hours after the Investigator becomes aware of the SAE. Compliance with this time requirement is  essential so that the Sponsor may comply with its regulatory 
obligations. 
The initial SAE report should be completed as fully as possible but should contain, at a minimum:  
• Subject number/ID, sex, and age/date of birth 
• The date of report 
• Name [CONTACT_225982] 
• Name [CONTACT_225983] 
• A description of the event, including event term(s), seriousness criteria, and a clinical 
summary of the event 
• Causality assessment.  
Information about all SAEs (either initial or follow -up information) should be collected and 
recorded in English on the electronic SAE Report Form within the EDC system. The Investigator 
must provide an assessment of causality (relationship to study drug) for all events reported at the 
time of the report. If the event meets seri ous criteria and it is not possible to access the EDC 
system, a paper SAE Report Form should be sent to the CRO via email or fax, or the Investigator will call the CRO SAE hotline within 24 hours of being made aware of the SAE (reference the 
Akebia Therapeutics, Inc.    Version # 1.0 
Protocol No. AKB -6548 -CI-0039  16 September 2020  
Akebia – Company Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_334127] information). When the EDC system becomes available, the SAE 
information must be entered within [ADDRESS_334128] report follow -up information relating to an SAE to the Sponsor’s Medical 
Monitor or C RO designee within [ADDRESS_334129] should be observed and monitored carefully until the condition resolves or stabilizes.  
All deaths are to be thoroughly investigated and reported. Autopsy reports and/or death certificates are to be obtained, if possible.  
The Spo nsor and/or its designee are responsible for reporting SAEs to all applicable regulatory 
agencies and the central ethics committees within the required timeline.  
The Investigators are responsible for submitting required safety information to their local Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) as per local regulations. This information includes, but is not limited to, any safety alert letter received from the Sponsor and any SAEs occurring at their investigative site. 
9.11.[ADDRESS_334130]  
The following are considered to be AESIs for this study: 
• malignancy including renal cell carcinoma (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) 
• elevation  in ALT or AST >[ADDRESS_334131] (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) 
• hepatotoxicity 
• worsening of hypertension 
• pulmonary hypertension 
• thrombotic events 
• congestive HF 
• adrenal disorders  
Reporting and classification of these events as SAEs (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) will be as per usual 
practice.  
9.11.[ADDRESS_334132]’s participation in the trial ends (i.e., until a final report is completed for that subject).  
In addition, all SAEs and those nonserious events assessed  by [CONTACT_252622]'s parti cipation in the trial 
is over. Such events should be followed until they resolve or until the Investigator assesses them 
as “chronic” or “stable”. Resolution of such events is to be documented on the appropriate e CRF.

Akebia – Company Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_334133] be confirmed by a positive serum β human chorionic 
gonadotropin (β- HCG) test.  
The study medication should be immediately discontinued once the pregnancy of a female subject has been confirmed.  
If any subject becomes or is found to be pregnant while receiving a study medication  or within 
[ADDRESS_334134] be recorded on the Pregnancy Reporting Form/Exposure in Utero Form in the validated electronic system  within [ADDRESS_334135] should also be reported.  
The Pregnancy Reporting Form/Exposure in Utero Form must be completed with all known 
information regarding the pregnancy at the time of reporting. Investigative site personnel will 
update the form with additional information regarding the pregnancy and the outcome of the pregnancy as it becomes available until the outcome of the pregnancy is reported.  
The investigator will follow the subject (or female partner of a male subject) unti l completion of 
the pregnancy. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for classification as an SAE (i.e., spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death within 1 month of birth, or congenital 
anomaly [including an aborted fetus]), the investigator will also follow the procedures for reporting an SAE  within 24 hours of awareness. A pregnancy in and of itself is not considered an 
AE; however, unexpec ted complications are considered AEs.  
Additional information about pregnancy outcomes follows: 
• Note that “spontaneous abortion” includes miscarriage and missed abortion. 
• All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_334136] 
to causality, as SAEs. In addition, any infant death after 1 month that the investigator 
assesses as related or unrelated to the in utero exposure to the study medication should also be reported.  
• In the case of a live birth, the “normality” of the newborn can be assessed at time of birth.  
• The “normality” of an aborted fetus can be assessed by [CONTACT_252623] -abortion laboratory findings suggestive of a congenital anomaly. 
9.12 Special Situations  
Certain safety events, called ‘Special Situations’, that occur in association with study 
medication(s) may require reporting. These Special Situations include, but are not limited to, the following: 
• Medication error involving the medicinal product (with or without subject exposure to the 
sponsor’s medicinal product [e.g., name [CONTACT_2976]]) 
Akebia Therapeutics, Inc.    Version # 1.0 
Protocol No. AKB -6548 -CI-0039  16 September 2020  
Akebia – Company Confidential  Page 55 of 69    • Drug -drug interaction. 
• Overdose (see Section 9.12.1) 
Special situations should be reported on the Special Situations e CRF  whether they result in an 
AE/SAE or not. Special situations with associated AE/SAE should also be reported on the 
corresponding AE/SAE forms, following applicable AE or SAE process. 
9.12.[ADDRESS_334137] is a category of Special Situations:  
• Mircera  overdose – The [LOCATION_002] Prescribing Information (US PI) should be referenced 
for information on M ircera  overdosing.   
• Vadadustat overdose - There is no known antidote for vadadustat.  In cases of suspected 
overdose, s ubjects should be treated per standard medical practice based on the investigator’s 
judgment and dose delays, reductions, or discontinuation may be implemented as necessary. 
Withholding subsequent vadadustat doses immediately after a vadadustat overdose should be strongly considered.  
Note: Chronic overdosage with vadadustat may result in excessive production of RBCs and 
polycythemia.  Polycythemia can be potentially life threatening and may result in severe thrombosis and death (known as hyperviscosity syndrome).  If hyperviscosity syndrome is observed, vadadustat should be discontinued and standard treatment for polycythemic hyperviscosity syndrome should be initiated (i.e., phlebotomy). 
• Suspected abuse/misuse of the medicinal product 
• Inadvertent or accidental exposure to the medicinal product 
Overdose should be reported on the Special Situations e CRF whether it results in an AE/SAE or 
not. Overdose with associated AE/SAE should also be reported on the corresponding AE/SAE forms, following the applicable AE or SAE process.

10.3 Populations for Analyses 
The following analysis populations will be used in this study:  
• Randomized population: defined as all randomized subjects. 
• Full analysis population: defined as randomized subjects receiving [ADDRESS_334140]-dose Hb assessment . This population will be analyzed 
based upon the randomized treatment. 
• Per protocol (PP) population: defined as all randomized subjects who received study 
medication during the primary evaluation period, had at least [ADDRESS_334141] no protocol deviations affecting the primary endpoint analyses. Protocol deviations leading to exclusion from the PP population will be specified 
prior to database lock on a blinded basis and recorded in a separate document. 
• Safety population: defined as all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study medication. 
This population will be analyzed based upon the actual treatment received. Subjects who 
received in error some vadadustat and some mircera (excluding rescue therapy) will be classified by [CONTACT_273543]. 
Efficacy analyses will utilize the randomized, full analysis, and PP populations while safety analyses will utilize the safety population.

number and percentage of subjects in each category will be tabulated. Summaries will be 
provided by [CONTACT_245972] (as defined in Section  10.3 ) 
and by [CONTACT_7206]/time period, as appropriate. 
For Hb, Baseline will be calculated as the average of the last [ADDRESS_334144] dose of study medication. 
The primary efficacy endpoint as well as the secondary and all other efficacy endpoints will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_1570], as well as by [CONTACT_245975]/or 
analysis period as appropriate. Mean values of Hb as well as selected other efficacy parameters will be plotted across study visits/periods by [CONTACT_1570]. 
Hb values will be assessed through the central laboratory for dose adjustments, efficacy and 
safety evaluations.  
10.5.2 Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s)  
The primary efficacy endpoint is defined as the mean change in  Hb between  Baseline (average 
pretreatment Hb) and the primary evaluation period (average Hb from Weeks 20 to 26, 
inclusive).  
The primary analysis of the primary endpoint will use the randomized population. Analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) with multiple imputation for missing data will be used to ca lculate the 
95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference in mean change in Hb from baseline to the primary evaluation period between the vadadustat groups and Mircera
® control group, with the 
randomization stratification factor and Baseline Hb  as covariates.  
Noninferiority of vadadustat will be established if the lower limit of this CI is ≥-0.75 g/dL. 
A hierarchical testing scheme will be used to correct for the multiplicity of the 2 comparisons of 
the primary efficacy endpoint: comparison between vadadustat TIW 600 mg versus Mircera and comparison between vadadustat TIW 900 mg versus Mircera.  
• Step 1: comparison between vadadustat TIW 900 mg versus Mircera  
If the noninferiority of vadadustat is established in step 1, then move to the step 2; 
• Step 2: comparison between vadadustat TIW 600 mg versus Mircera  
 Sensitivity Analyses of Primary Efficacy Endpoint Screening  
The following sensitivity analyses will be conducted if necessary :  
• Primary analysis will be repeated using the full analysis population. 
• Primary analysis will be repeated using the PP population with the actual treatment received. 
• Primary analysis will be repeated with imputation of data which may have been affected by a 
subject’s having received any form of rescue (transfusion or ES A). De tails are provided in 
the statistical analysis plan ( SAP).

Akebia – Company Confidential  Page 58 of 69    • Primary analysis will be repeated with method of mixed model for repeated measures 
(MMRM).  
10.5.3 Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoint(s)  
Mean change in Hb between Baseline (average pretreatment Hb) and the secondary evaluation 
period ( average Hb from Weeks 46 to  52, inclusive ) will be analyzed using the same 
methodology as specified for the primary efficacy endpoint. Sensitivity analyses similar to those 
of the primary efficacy endpoint will be performed and details will be provided in the SAP. 
10.5.4 Exploratory Endpoint(s) 
A full description of the analyses performed on exploratory endpoints will be provided in the 
SAP. 
10.5.5 Safety Analyses 
All analyses of safety data will use the safety population.  
10.5.6 Analysis of Adverse Events  
AEs will be summarized using the number and percentage of subjects with AEs for all  subjects 
in the safety population.  
All A Es will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA). 
Treatment -emergent and post- treatment AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_273544] 
(PT) for each treatment group.  
Summaries will also be provided for the following types of AEs: 
• SAEs  
• Related AEs (including all categories for relationship to study medication other than 
“Unrela ted”, as determined by [CONTACT_093] ) 
• AEs leading to early discontinuation of study medication. 
10.5.7 Remaining Safety Endpoints  
The analysis of the safety endpoints will be detailed in the SAP: The analysis of proportion of subjects with Hb >11.0, Hb >12.0, Hb >13.0, or >14.0 g/dL post- Baseline will classify a subject 
as a “yes” if:  
• Any value Hb >11.0 g/dL at any time after Day 1 
• Any value Hb >12.0 g/dL at any time after Day 1 
• Any value Hb >13.0 g/dL at any time after Day 1 
• Any value Hb >14.0 g/dL at any time after Day 1  
• Any value Hb <7.0 g/dL at any time after Day 1 
• Any value Hb <8.0 g/dL at any time after Day 1

11.8.1 Criteria for Premature Termination or Suspension of the Study  
The following criteria may result in either temporary suspension or ET of the study:  
• New information regarding the safety or efficacy of the study drug that indicates a change 
in the known risk/benefit profile for the compound, such that the risk/benefit is no longer 
acceptable for subjects participating in the stu dy  
• Significant violation of GCP that compromises the a bility to achieve the primary study 
objectives or compromises subject safety  
• Request from regulatory agencies 
 
The sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study for other valid administrative reasons. If 
the study has been suspended or terminated, prompt notification will be given to investigators, IRBs, and regulatory authorities in accordance with regulatory requirements.  
11.8.2 Criteria for Premature Termination or Suspension of Study Sites  
The Sponsor may terminate this study prematurely, either in its  entirety or at any study site, for 
reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended

Sponsor terminates the study for safety reasons, the Sponsor will immediately notify the 
Investigator and subsequently provide written instructions for study termination. If the study has been suspended or terminated, prompt notification will be given to Investigators, IRBs, and regulatory  authorities in accordance with regulatory requirements.  
A study site may be terminated prematurely or suspended if the study site (including the investigator) is found to be in significant violation of GCP, protocol, contractual agreement, or is unable to ensure adequate performance of the study.  
The investigator will notify the sponsor if the trial is terminated by [CONTACT_273548]. If the investigator, IRB, or sponsor decides to terminate or suspend the trial conduct at a particular study site for safety, non-enrollment, non-compliance with the protocol, or other unanticipated reasons, the above parties will be promptly notified.  
11.8.3 Criteria for Premature Termination or Suspension of the Study or Study Sites  
In the event that the sponsor elects to terminate or suspend the study or the participation of an 
investigational study site, a study- specific procedure for ET or suspension will be provided by 
[CONTACT_456]; the procedure will be followed by [CONTACT_225980].

be stored at the biorepository with the same goal as the sharing of data with the biorepository . 
These samples could be used to research the causes of anemia in subjects receiving hemodialysis in CKD, its complications and other conditions for which individuals with anemia in subjects receiving hemodialysis in CKD are at increased risk, and to improve treatment. The biorepository will also be provided with a code- link that will allow linking the biological 
specimens with the phenotypic data from each subject , maintaining the blinding of the identity of 
the subject . 
During the conduct of the study, an individual subject  can choose to withdraw consent to have 
biological specimens stored for future research. However, withdrawal of consent with regard to biosample storage may not be possible after the study is completed.  
When the study is completed, access to study data and/or samples will be provided through the biorepository.

will be developed to descri be a site’s quality management.  
Quality control (QC) procedures will be implemented beginning with the data entry system and data QC checks that will be run on t he database will be generated. Any missing data or data 
anomalies will be communicated to the site(s) for clarification/resolution.  
Following written Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), the monitors will verify that the clinical trial is conducted and da ta are generated and biological specimens are collected, 
documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP , and applicable 
regulatory requirements (e.g., Good Laboratory Practices [GLP] , GMP ).  
The investigational site will provide direct access to all trial related sites, source data/documents, and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by [CONTACT_456], and inspection by [CONTACT_3482]. 
11.12.[ADDRESS_334154] periodic monitoring visits to e nsure 
that the protocol and GCP are being followed. The monitors will review source documents to 
confirm that the data recorded on the e CRFs  is accurate. The investigator/institution will allow 
the sponsor’s monitors or designees and appropriate regulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification.  
The study site may also be subject to Quality Assurance audits performed by [CONTACT_273549], and/or review by [CONTACT_1201], and/or to 
inspection by [CONTACT_4708].  
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.

• Entered into the study even though they did not satisfy entry criteria.  
• Developed withdrawal criteria during the study and not withdrawn.  
• Received wrong treatment or incorrect dose.  
• Received excluded concomitant treatment.  
 
When one of these deviations from the protocol is identified for an individual subject, the investigator or designee must ensure the sponsor  is notified. If the investigator determines that 
the deviation impacts the safety of a subject, the investigator must contact [CONTACT_8650].  The sponsor will follow- up with the investigator, as applicable, to assess the 
deviation and the possibl e impact to the safety and/or efficacy of the subject to determine subject 
continuation in the study.  
The investigator will also assure that deviations meeting IRB/IEC and applicable regulatory

Study Title  
A PI[INVESTIGATOR_318342]60  IN ALS

 Protocol Number  
RNS60 -01 
 
Study Indication  
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)  
 
Phase of Development  
IIa 
 
Rationale for the Study  
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal, neurodegenerative disease for which there is no cure.  
  
A substantial body of evidence implicates the neuroimmune system and specifically activated 
microglia in ALS pathophysiology. Activated microglia are increased in postmortem brain and 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_318347], and the number of activated microglia correlates positively with faster rate of disease progression. In addition, studies of blood cells in people with ALS have shown an increased activation of two of the major 
inflammatory cell types in the body, mo nocytes and T cells. Among T  cells, regulatory T cells 
(Tregs) have been recently proposed to play a role in ALS progression. Tregs and their FoxP3 
protein expressions were reduced in rapi[INVESTIGATOR_318348]. A 3.5- year prospective study revealed that early reduced FoxP3 levels were 
predictive of future rapid progression and attenuated surviva l. These data suggest that Tregs may 
influence disease progression rates in ALS.

(ALSFRS -R), slow vital capacity (SVC), strength (measured  by [CONTACT_318362] - Accurate Test of Limb 
Isometric Strength)] .  
For participants who elect to continue with the optional 24 week extension, safety parameters (labs, 
EKG, adverse events, C -SSRS) will continue to be monitored. We will also collect ALSFRS -R and 
SVC o utcome measures.

Number of Planned Subjects  
Up to [ADDRESS_391890] provide written informed consent prior to screening. 
Subjects on a stable dose of riluzole and those not taking riluzole, and women of child-be aring age 
at screening are eligible for inclusion as long as they meet specific protocol requirements.  Safety,  
tolerability , blood biomarkers, and clinical outcomes will be collected  on all subjects . In a subgroup 
of 10 study participants (“ Imaging group”) neuro- imaging will be performed . Detailed criteria are 
described in the body of the protocol.  
Treatment Plan  
RNS60 will be administered in two ways: by [CONTACT_33980] (IV) infusion one day a week (infusion dose: 375ml, infused over a 40 -min period) and by [CONTACT_12699] (the remaining 6 days a week, 4  
ml/day)  for [ADDRESS_391891] a 
Week 28 Follow- up Telephone Interview to assess for adverse events (AEs), changes in 
concomitant medications and to administer the ALSFRS -R. After the completion of the trial, 
subjects will be called by [CONTACT_318363] 3 months to ascertain ALSFRS -R and vital 
status for up to 2 years.

scale (ALSFRS -R), slow vital capacity (SVC), strength (measured by [CONTACT_318362] - Accurate Test of 
Limb Isometric Strength) . An additional primary objective is to measure the impact of RNS60 on 
several markers of neuro -inflammation measured by [CONTACT_318366] 
[11C]-PBR28 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in a subgroup of 13 subjects . 
3.2 Study Outcome Measures  
For all subjects enrolled in the study, t he following will be  primary  outcome measures:  
1- Safety, as measured by [CONTACT_318367], physical 
examination, and sta ndard clinical laboratory tests; 
2- Tolerability, defined as the ability of subjects to complete the entire 24-week treatment 
portion of study;  
3- Clinical outcomes: Measured by [CONTACT_191953] -R, SVC, and strength (measured by [CONTACT_318362]).  
4- Blood biomarkers of inflammation . 
 
For subjects in the “Imaging group” , the following additional outcome measures  will be 
obtained: 
1- Neuroimaging biomarker s ([11C]-PBR28 -PET)  including both regions of interest (ROI) 
and voxel- based analyses

4.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
During the enrollment period , approximately 25 subjects will be screened at the [LOCATION_005] 
General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (MGH) .  Approx imately  18 of these subjects are expected to be eligible to 
receive RNS60  per study protocol.  RNS60 will be administered in two ways: by [CONTACT_318368] a week (infusions to occur at MGH ) and by [CONTACT_12699]  (once a day for the remaining 6 days a 
week ). All visit windows (± 3 days) are consecutive calendar days and are calculated from the 
day the participant starts study treatment (the day of the Baseline Visit).

 Fifteen  (15) subjects will receive  RNS60 for  up to 48 weeks  per study protocol and will be 
followed up to 52 w eeks.  
5.2 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
5.2.1 Inclusion  Criteria  
 Study subjects meeting all of the following criteria will be allowed to enroll in the study:  
1- ALS volunteers must be diagnosed as having possible, probable, probable -laboratory 
supported, or definite ALS, either sporadic or familial according to modified El Escorial 
criteria.  
2- Age 18-80, able to provide informed consent, and comply with study procedures.  
3- Participants must not have taken riluzole for at least [ADDRESS_391903] 30 days, prior to screening (riluzole -naïve participants are permitted 
in the study).  
4- Women must not be  lactating or  able to become pregnant (e.g. post menopausal, 
surgically sterile, or using adequate birth control) for the duration of the study and 3 
months after study completion.  
5- Males should practice contraception for the duration of the study and 3 months after completion. 
 
Study subjects  in the “Imaging group” will also need to meet the following additional inclusion 
criteria:  
1- Ability to safely lie flat for 90 min for PET procedures  in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_318349].  
2- High or mixed affinity to bind TSPO protein (Ala/Ala or Ala/Thr) (Details below).  
3- Score of 25 or greater (out of 45) on the Upper Motor Neuron Burden (Details below).

1/29/[ADDRESS_391904]: venous blood will be drawn from all participants at Screening in order to 
have them genotyped for the Ala147Thr TSPO polymorphism  in the TSPO  gene (rs6971) . About 
10% of humans show low binding affinity to PBR2824. A recent study has demonstrated that the 
rs6971 polymorphism predicts PBR28 binding affinity in human platelets25. Since the low -
affinity binder phenotype is consistent across all tissues within the same person, testing for the  
Ala147Thr polymorphism can be performed to predict low affinity for PBR28 in all organs, 
including the brain25. High or Mixed affinity binders (Ala/Ala or Ala/Thr) will be considered 
eligible, whereas the low affinity binders (Thr/Thr) will be considered ineligible for the  study.

dification of Study Intervention/Investig ation al Product for a Subject  
Any dosage adjustment, including the reason for and dates of adjustment, will be documented in the CRF for each subject requiring this manipulation. The PIs or licensed physician Sub-
Investigator  may reduce the dosage of study drug or discontinue the study drug in its entirety for 
AEs thought to be related to the study drug or for other reason during the trial (the reason for, and dates of suspension or dose reduction must be documented).  If the AE is mild or moderate, 
the dosage may be reduced until the event improves.  The P Is may then choose to resume the 
higher dosage or maintain the subject at a reduced dosage. The option to continue with administration by [CONTACT_318374]. 
 
If the event is serious or life threatening, and deemed to be definitely drug related, the study drug will be discontinued immediately. Study subjects must remain off the study drug permanently. Subjects may not resume study drug.  All AEs will be followed to resolution.

Study subjects who discontinue study drug prematurely (early termination from study) will be 
encouraged to return for a Final Safety Visit and participate in a Follow -Up Telephone Call 28 
days (+ 5 days) after the last dose of study drug.  
6.4 Accountability Procedures   
Subjects will be provided with a drug diary at  each time point when drug for inhalation is 
dispensed (baseline, week 7, and week 15 for the core study, and week 23, week 30, and week 38 
for the extension phase ). Subjects will be instructed to return all drug for inhalation consumed 
and remaining, as well as a completed diary, at weeks 7, 15, 23, 30, 37, and 47. R econciliation of 
drug consumed  and drug remaining will be logged on the drug dispensing and return log , signed 
and dated.  Any discrepancies noted will be investigated, resolved, and documented prior to  
return or destruction of unused study drug.  Drug destroyed on site will be documented in the study files.

deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care provided that the medications are licensed in the [LOCATION_002].  All concomitant medications and/or treatments received by a subject should 
be recorded on the appropriate source document and eCRF. 
6.6.1 Prohibited Medications and Contraindications  
Prohibited Medications 
Prohibited medications for subjects in the Imaging group are as follows:  
1- immunomodulatory medications  
2- nicotine replacement products such as gum or patch 
 
Additionally, subjects in the Biomarker group should wash from benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_92650]-
steroidal anti- inflammatory medications one week prior to PET scan as these compounds would 
affect the results of the scan.

There are no adequate and well -control led studies in pregnant women.   Subjects or partners of 
male sub jects should not become pregnant during the study or [ADDRESS_391912] over a 90% chance of seeing at least one occurrence 
of any adverse event whose probability of occurrence is 15% or greater. Tolerability will be 
defined as the ability of subjects to complete the entire 24- week treatment portion of study. With 
15 par ticipants on active drug in this study, if 10 or more participants tolerate the drug , there is 
an 85% chance that the true tolerability among people with ALS is at least 75%.  Furthermore, if 
10 or more people tolerate the drug, there is only a 3% chance t hat the true tolerability will be as 
low as 40% in people with ALS. For people in the Biomarker group, primary outcomes will 
include changes in the ROI in the motor cortex as assessed by [11C] -PBR29 -PET. Our previous 
studies comparing mean PBR28 binding in the motor cortices in limb -onset ALS subjects (1.18 
units) with matching healthy volunteers (1.064 units) revealed 0.[ADDRESS_391913] a treatment difference at a o ne-sided

RNS60 in ALS  
V 4.0 
1/29/2016 
Page 40 of 67 trials of antidepressant drugs. One such assessment instrument is the Columbia Suicide Severity 
Rating Scale (C -SSRS)63. The C -SSRS involves a series of probing questions to inquire about 
possible suicidal thinking and behavior. 
Only investigators who have been fully trained in the administration of the C -SSRS will assess 
subject suicidality. As part of training, investiga tors are prepared to respond to and manage 
instances in which patients express suicidal ideation  or exhibit suicidal behavior. 
At the Baseline Visit, the C -SSRS Baseline  version will be administered. This version is used to 
assess suicidality over the subject’s lifetime and specifically for the previous [ADDRESS_391926]’s last visit.  
Information obtained from : http://www.cssrs.columbia.edu/  
8.1.9  Upper Motor Neuron -Burden (UMN -B)

on examination including pathologically brisk biceps, supi[INVESTIGATOR_318355], triceps, finger, knee and ankle reflexes, and extensor plantar responses assessed bilaterally and brisk facial and jaw jerks (9).  The scale is a combination of Ashworth, Reflexes, and Pseudobulbar Affect scale (Range score: 
0 to 32). 
 The UMN also includes scoring of the Center for Neurologic Study- Lability Scale (CNS -LS), a 
7-item self report scale that assesses pseudobulbar affect (PBA) by [CONTACT_318375][INVESTIGATOR_1841] (laughing or crying) and the Ashworth Spasticity Scale, a standard

a non- invasive device that allows measurements of  isometric strength in [ADDRESS_391929] protocol  (elbow and knee flexion and extension, grip, and 
dorsiflexion). ATLIS consists of a  frame with metal uprights. A wireless load cell is attached to 
adjustable testing stations positioned on the frame. The load cell transmits data (peak force) to a laptop computer using wireless technology.  The General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318356] a 
patent for this device by [CONTACT_318376] ( Patent # 7,493,812  issued 2/24/09). This device is 
not FDA approved. 
8.1.12 Neuroimaging  
Subjects in the Imaging group will undergo Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) / Positron 
Emission Tom ography ( PET) twice during the course of the study . MR-PET scanning will be 
performed simultaneously using the Siemens [ADDRESS_391930] scan will  occur 
between the Screening and the B aseline visits ( off treatment) , after subject eligibility has been 
confirmed by [CONTACT_318377]. The second scan will occur between the Week 1 8 and 
Week 23 visits ( on treatment). Neuroimaging will be performed at the MGH Martinos Center for 
Biomedical Imaging .  Subjects will be asked to lie still in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_318357], which will take approxima tely 90 min.

9.1 Definitions of AEs, Suspected Adverse Drug Reactions & SAEs  
9.1.1 Adverse Event and Suspected Adverse Drug Reactions  
An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
study, use of a drug product or device whether or not considered related to the drug product or 
device.  
 
Adverse drug reactions (ADR) are all noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product 
related to any dose.  The phrase “responses to a medicinal product” means that a causal 
relationship between a medicinal product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out.  Therefore, a subset of AEs  can be classified as 
suspected ADRs, if there is a causal relationship to the medicinal product.  Examples of AEs include: new conditions, worsening of pre -existing conditions, clinically 
significant abnormal physical examination signs (i.e. skin rash, pe ripheral edema, etc), or 
clinically significant abnormal test results (i.e. lab values or vital signs), with the exception of outcome measure results, which are not being recorded as AEs in this trial (they are being 
collected, but analyzed separately). St able chronic conditions (i.e., diabetes, arthritis) that are 
present prior to the start of the study and do not worsen during the trial are NOT considered AEs.  
Chronic conditions that occur more frequently (for intermittent conditions) or with greater severity, would be considered as worsened and therefore would be recorded as AEs . 
 AEs are generally detected in two ways:  
  
Clinical  symptoms reported by [CONTACT_243075]. 
 
Ancillary Tests  abnormalities of vital signs, laboratory tests, and other diagnostic 
procedures (other than the outcome measures, the results of which are not being captured 
as AEs).

Page 43 of 67  
For the purposes of this study, symptoms of progression/worsening of ALS, including ‘normal’ 
progression, will be recorded as AEs .     
 The following measures of disease progression will not be recorded as AEs even if they worsen 
(they are being recorded and analyzed separately): vital capacity results and ALSFRS -R results.  
 If discernible at the time of completing the AE log, a specific disease or syndrome rather than 
individual associated signs and symptoms should be identified by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_318358].  However, if an observed or reported sign, symptom, or clinically significant laboratory anomaly is not considered by [CONTACT_246413] a component of a specific disease or syndrome, then it should be recorded as a separate AE on the AE log.  Clinically significant 
laboratory abnormalities, such as those that require intervention, are those that are identif ied as 
such by [CONTACT_978]. 
 
Subjects will be monitored for AEs from the time they sign consent until completion of their 
participation in the study (defined as death, consent withdrawal, loss to follow up, early study termination for other reasons or following completion of the entire study).   
9.1.2 Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an adverse event that meets any of the following 
criteria:  
1. Results in death. 
2. Is life threatening: that is, poses an immediate risk of death as the event occurred. 
a. This serious criterion applies if the study subject, in the view of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_27362], 
is at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurs .  It does not apply if an AE 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
3. Requir es inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
a. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34096] (including elective PEG tube/g -
tube/feeding tube placement) or a routinely scheduled treatment is not an SAE by [CONTACT_246414] “procedure” or a “treatment” is not 
an untoward medical occurrence. 
4. Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
a. This serious criterion applies if the “disability” caused by [CONTACT_318378] a substantial dis ruption of the subject’s ability to carry out normal life 
functions. 
5. Results in congenital anomaly or birth defect in the offspring of the subject (whether the subject is male or female).

intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such medical events include blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 An inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_243048] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], treatment -emergent, clinical 
AE may meet criteria for "seriousness" but is not an adverse experience, and will therefore, not 
be considered an SAE.  An example of this would include a social admission (subject admitted 
for other reasons than medical, e.g., lives far from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], has no place to sleep).

9.[ADDRESS_391933] throughout the study for possible AEs.  All AEs will 
be documented on CRFs designed specifically for this purpose.  All AEs will be collected and reported in the el ectronic data capture (EDC) system. The PIs shall promptly review all 
information relevant to the safety of the investigational product, including all SAEs.  Special attention will be paid to those that result in permanent discontinuation of the investigational product being studied, whether serious or non-serious. 
9.2.1 Assessment of Adverse Events  
At each visit (including telephone interviews), the subject will be asked if they have had  any 
problems or symptoms since their last visit in order to determine  the occurrence of AEs.   If the 
subject reports an AE, the Investigator will probe further to determine: 
1. Type of event  
2. Date of onset and resolution (duration) 
3. Severity (mild, moderate, severe)  
4. Seriousness (does the event meet the above definition for an S AE) 
5. Causality, relation to investigational product and disease 
6. Action taken regarding investigational product 
7. Outcome 
9.2.[ADDRESS_391934] should be specifie d by [CONTACT_7676], using the 
following definitions:

Page 45 of 67  
1.  Not Related:          Concomitant illness, accident or event with no reasonable 
association with treatment.  
 2.  Unlikely: The reaction has little or no temporal sequence from administration 
of the investigational product, and/or a more likely alternative 
etiology exists.  
 
3.  Possibly Related: The reaction follows a reasonably temporal sequence from 
administration of the investigational product and follows a known response pattern to the suspected investigational product; the reaction could have been produced by [CONTACT_246415]’s clinical state or by 
[CONTACT_243079]. (Suspected ADR)  
 
4.  Probably Related: The reaction  follows a reasonably temporal sequence from 
administration of investigational product; is confirmed by 
[CONTACT_246416] -challenge; 
and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s clin ical state. (Suspected ADR)  
 5.  Definitely Related:  The reaction follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of investigational product; that follows a known or 
expected response pattern to the investigational product; and that is confirmed  by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_318360], and reappearance of the reaction on repeated exposure. (Suspected ADR)  
9.2.3 Recording of Adverse Events  
All clinical adverse events are recorded in the Adverse Event (AE) L og in the subject’s study 
binder. Study staff  should fill out the AE Log and enter the AE information into the EDC system 
within 48 hours of the site learning of a new AE or receiving an update on an existing AE.    Entries on the AE Log (and into the EDC)  will include the following: name [CONTACT_318381], the date of onset, the date of resolution, relationship to investigational product, action taken, and primary outcome of event.

10.1 Safety Monitoring  
The study PIs will review safety data throughout the trial and may stop the trial for safety if they 
determine that there is a significant difference in the rate of a particular adverse event that would 
indicate a risk that is greater than the possible benefit of the study drug.    
 Unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others including adverse events will be reported to the Partners Human Research Committee (PHRC) in accordance with PHRC unanticipated problems including AEs  reporting guidelines.

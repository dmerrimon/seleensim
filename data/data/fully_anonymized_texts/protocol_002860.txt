1.0 BACKGROUND  
1.1 Ovarian Cancer, Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma, and Fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_248853] 21,000 new cases of ovarian, primary peritoneal, and fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_248854] 2008 with approximat ely 15,520 
deaths caused by [CONTACT_248878]. [1]  Due to a paucity of effective screening 
modalities, most patients are diagnosed in the advanced stages of the 
disease.  The current standard of care consists of a total abdominal 
hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, and extensive tumor debulk ing followed 
by [CONTACT_248879] -weekly administration of carboplatin and paclitaxel.   With this treatment 
regimen, over 50% of patients achieve a complete initial clinical response, but 
the majority of patients recur within the first 2 years with only 10 -30% 
achievin g long -term survival. [2]  Additionally, this treatment combination is 
associa ted with high rates of fatigue, as well as hematologic and neurologic 
toxicity. [3, 4]  New first -line treatment regimens are being investigated in order 
to improve the initial response rate and prolong the time to r ecurrence in these 
patients while improving do se-delaying toxicity profiles.  
1.[ADDRESS_302584] -line and salvage chemotherapy in patients with ovarian 
cancer. [5-8]  Recent data demonstrated that patients treated with dose dense 
weekly administration of paclitaxel at 80 mg/ m2 given with carboplatin (AU 6 ) 
every [ADDRESS_302585] tri -
weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel (27.9 vs. 17.1 months, p=0.0014). [9]  Overall 
survival at 2 years was also longer in the patients receiving dose dense 
treatment (83.6% vs. 77.7%, p=0.05).  Toxicities were similar between both 
groups except grade 3 and 4 anemia was reported more frequently in the dose 
dense group.   As front -line therapy, Sehouli et al. treated patients with FIGO 
stages IIB -IV disease after optimal tumor resection with weekly paclitaxel (100 
mg/m2) followed carboplatin (AUC 2) and found the median progression free 
survival (PFS) and over all survival (OS) to be 21 and 43 months, 
respectively. [6]  Additionally, patients with recurrent disease treated with 
weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin were found to have an overall response rate 
of 80% with 100% response rate in platinum -sensitive patients. [8, 10]   Toxicity 
profile was also found to be improved with weekly chemotherapeutic dosing. [5-
7]  Reduced myelosuppression and  fewer side effects allow patients to 
continue their scheduled chemotherapy with fewer dose delays.  Additionally, 
the use of weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin in advanced breast cancer 
demonstrated comparable efficacy to the traditional tri -weekly regimen  with 
decreased incidence of grade 3 and 4 toxicities. [11] 
1.3 Angiogenesis -Targeted Therapeutics  
Angiogenesis and neovascularization are required f or tumor growth and 
invasion and play a significant role in disease metastasis. [12, 13]   Several 
studies have demonstrated that analysis of angiogenic factors may be 
correlated with ovarian cancer progression and p rognosis. [14-16]  Vascular -
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an angiogenic promoter and ligand that 
binds to the VEGF receptor [ADDRESS_302586] demonstrated 
potential therapeutic activity using these biological agents. [17, 18]  
1.4 Bevacizumab Clinical Experience  
Bevacizumab has been studied in a multitude of Phase I, II, and III clinical 
trials in more than 5000 patients and in multiple tumor types. In addition, data 
are available from 3,863 patie nts enrolled in two postmarketing studies in 
metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC).  Approximately 130,[ADDRESS_302587] or in clinical trials.  The 
following discussion summarizes bevacizumab’s safety profile  and presents 
some of the efficacy results pertinent to this particular trial. Please refer to the 
bevacizumab Investigator Brochure for descriptions of all completed Phase I, 
II, and III trials reported to date.  
In a large phase III study (AVF2107g) in pa tients with metastatic colorectal 
cancer, the addition of bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against 
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), to irinotecan/5 -
fluorouracil/leucovorin (IFL) chemotherapy resulted in a clinically and 
statistically s ignificant increase in duration of survival, with a hazard ratio of 
death of 0.67 (median survival 15.6 vs. 20.3  months; p  < 0.001). [19]  Similar 
increases were seen in progression -free survival (6.2 vs. 10.6 months; 
p < 0.001), overall response rate (35% vs. 45%; p  < 0.01) and duration of 
response (7.1  vs. 10.4 months; p  < 0.01) for the combination arm versus the 
chemotherapy only arm (Bevacizumab Investigator Brochure, October 2005).  
Based on the survival advantage demonstrated in Study AVF2107g, 
bevacizumab was desi gnated for priority review and was approved on [ADDRESS_302588] -line treatment in combination with 
IV 5-FUbased chemotherapy for subjects with metastatic colorectal cancer.  
Additional data from Phase III trials in metastati c colorectal cancer (E3200), 
nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC; E4599), and metastatic breast cancer 
(E2100) have also demonstrated clinical benefit from bevacizumab when 
added to chemotherapy. [20-22]  In Study E32 00, the addition of bevacizumab 
to FOLFOX chemotherapy resulted in improved overall survival compared with 
FOLFOX alone (13.0 vs. 10.8  months, respectively, HR   0.75; p   0.01) in a 
population of previously treated CRC patients. [22]   
There was also improved overall survival in first -line NSCLC patients treated 
with carboplatin/paclitaxel   bevacizumab compared with chemotherapy alone 
(12.3 vs. 10.3 months, respectively; HR   0.80; p  = 0.003). [20]  The results 
from this trial were the basis for FDA approval of bevacizumab for use in 
combination with carboplatin   paclitaxel as first -line treatment of patients with 
unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic, non -squamous 
NSCLC in October 2006.  Finally, patients with untreated metastatic breast 
cancer (E2100) who received bevacizumab in combination wit h weekly 
paclitaxel had a marked improvement in PFS compared with chemotherapy 
alone (11.8 vs. 5.9  months, respectively; HR   0.60; p   0.001) [21] (see the 
Bevacizumab Investigator Brochure for additional details).

Bevacizumab Safety Profile  
In the initial Phase I and II clinical trials, four potential b evacizumab -
associated safety signals were identified: hypertension, proteinuria, 
thromboembolic events, and hemorrhage.  Additional completed Phase II and 
Phase III studies of bevacizumab as well as spontaneous reports have further 
defined the safety profi le of this agent. Bevacizumab -associated adverse 
events identified in phase III trials include congestive heart failure (CHF) 
primarily in metastatic breast cancer, gastrointestinal perforations, wound 
healing complications, and arterial thromboembolic eve nts (ATE). These and 
other safety signals are described in further detail as follows and in the 
Bevacizumab Investigator Brochure.  
Hypertension : An increased incidence of hypertension has been observed in 
patients treated with bevacizumab.  Grade [ADDRESS_302589] included 
hypertensive crisis, hypertensive encephalopathy, and reversible posterior 
leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS). [23, 24]   
There is no information on the effect of bevacizumab in patients with 
uncontrolled hypertension at the time of initiating bevacizumab therapy.  
Therefore, caution should be exercised before initiating bevacizumab therapy 
in these patients.  Monitoring of bloo d pressure is recommended during 
bevacizumab therapy.  Optimal co ntrol of blood pressure according to 
standard public health guidelines is recommended for patients on treatment 
with or without bevacizumab.   
Temporary interruption of bevacizumab therapy is  recommended in patients 
with hypertension requiring medical therapy until adequate control is achieved.  
If hypertension cannot be controlled with medical therapy, bevacizumab 
therapy should be permanently discontinued.  Bevacizumab should be 
permanently discontinued in patients who develop hypertensive crisis or 
hypertensive encephalopathy.  
Proteinuria :  An increased incidence of proteinuria has been observed in 
patients treated with bevacizumab compared with control arm patients.  In the 
bevacizumab -containing treatment arms of clinical trials (across all 
indications), the incidence of proteinuria (reported as an adverse event) was 
up to 38% (metastatic CRC Study  AVF2192g). The severity of proteinuria has 
ranged from asymptomatic and transient events dete cted on routine dipstick 
urinalysis to nephrotic syndrome; the majority of proteinuria events have been 
grade 1. NCI-CTC Grade 3 proteinuria was reported in up to 3% of 
bevacizumab -treated patients, and Grade  4 in up to 1.4% of 
bevacizumab -treated patients .  The proteinuria seen in bevacizumab clinical 
trials was not associated with renal impairment and rarely required permanent 
discontinuation of bevacizumab therapy.  Bevacizumab should be 
discontinued in patients who develop Grade 4 proteinuria (nephrotic  
syndrome)  
Patients with a history of hypertension may be at increased risk for the 
development of proteinuria when treated with bevacizumab.  There is 
evidence from the dose -finding, Phase II trials (AVF0780g, AVF0809s, and 
AVF0757g) suggesting that Grade  1 proteinuria may be related to 
bevacizumab dose.  
2009 -0186  
Revised April 26, 2016  
Page 8 of 58 
Proteinuria will be monitored by [CONTACT_39701]:creatinine (UPCR) ratio at least 
every 6 weeks.   
Thromboembolic Events:  Both venous and arterial thromboembolic (TE) 
events, ranging in severity from cathete r-associated phlebitis to fatal, have 
been reported in patients treated with bevacizumab in the colorectal cancer 
trials and, to a lesser extent, in patients treated with bevacizumab in NSCLC 
and breast cancer trials.  
Venous thromboembolism (including dee p venous thrombosis, pulmonary 
embolism, and thrombophlebitis:  In the phase III pi[INVESTIGATOR_156623], there was a slightly higher rate of venous TE events in patients treated 
with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone 
(19% vs. 16%).  
In Study AVF2107g, a Phase III, pi[INVESTIGATOR_47273], VTE events, 
including deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and 
thrombophlebitis, occurred in 15.2% of patients receiving chemotherapy alone 
and 16.6% of patients receivi ng chemotherapy   bevacizumab.  
The incidence of NCI -CTC Grade   3 venous VTE events in one NSCLC trial 
(E4599) was higher in the bevacizumab -containing arm compared to the 
chemotherapy control arm (5.6% vs. 3.2%).  One event (0.2%) was fatal in the 
bevaci zumab -containing arm; not fatal events were reported in the 
carboplatin/paclitaxel arm (see Bevacizumab Investigator Brochure ).  
In metastatic CRC clinical trials, the incidence of VTE events was similar in 
patients receiving chemotherapy   bevacizumab and  those receiving the 
control chemotherapy alone.  
In clinical trials across all indications the overall incidence of VTE events was 
2.8%17.3% in the bevacizumab -containing arms compared with 3.2% 15.6% 
in the chemotherapy control arms.  The use of bevaciz umab with 
chemotherapy does not substantially increase the risk of VTE event compared 
with chemotherapy alone.  However, patients with metastatic CRC who 
receive bevacizumab and experienced a VTE event may be at higher risk for 
recurrence of VTE event.  
Arterial Thromboembotic Events :  An increased incidence of ATE events 
was observed in patients treated with bevacizumab compared with those 
receiving control treatments.  ATE events include cerebrovascular accidents, 
myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), and other ATE events.  
In a pooled analysis of data from five randomized Phase II and III trials 
(mCRC [AVF2107g, AVF2192g, AVF0780g]; locally advanced or metastatic 
NSCLC [AVF0757g]; metastatic breast cancer [AVF2119g]), the incidence rate  
of ATE events was 3.8% (37 of 963) in patients who received 
chemotherapy   bevacizumab compared with 1.7% (13 of 782) in patients 
treated with chemotherapy alone.  ATE events led to a fatal outcome in 0.8% 
(8 of 963) of patients treated with chemotherapy   bevacizumab and 0.5% (4 
of 782) of patients treated with chemotherapy alone.  Cerebrovascular 
accidents (including TIAs) occurred in 2.3% of patients treated with 
chemotherapy   bevacizumab and 0.5% of patients treated with 
chemotherapy alone.  Myocardia l infarction occurred in 1.4% of patients 
treated with chemotherapy   bevacizumab compared with 0.7% of patients 
2009 -0186  
Revised April 26, 2016  
Page 9 of 58 
treated with chemotherapy alone (see the Bevacizumab Investigator Brochure 
for additional details).  
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_33930] a standard therapy for primary a nd secondary prophylaxis of arterial 
thromboembolic events in patients at high risk of such events, and the use of 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] ≤ [ADDRESS_302590] to meta static colorectal cancer patients were 
presented at ASCO 2005. [25]  Further analyses of the effects of concomitant 
use of bevacizumab and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_51674].  
Gastrointestinal perforation : Patients with  metastatic carcinoma may be at 
increased risk for the development of gastrointestinal perforation and fistula 
when treated with bevacizumab and chemotherapy. Bevacizumab should be 
permanently discontinued in patients who develop gastrointestinal perforati on. 
A causal association of intra -abdominal inflammatory processes and 
gastrointestinal perforation to bevacizumab treatment has not been 
established. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when treating patients 
with intra -abdominal inflammatory proces ses with bevacizumab. 
Gastrointestinal perforation has been reported in other trials in non -colorectal 
cancer populations (e.g., ovarian, renal cell, pancreas, breast, and NSCLC) 
and may be higher in incidence in some tumor types.  
Fistula:   Bevacizumab use  has been associated with serious cases of fistulae 
including events resulting in death.  Fistulae in the GI tract are common (1% –
10% incidence) in patients with metastatic CRC, but uncommon (0.1% 1%) or 
rare (0.01% –0.1%) in other indications.  In addition , fistulae that involve areas 
of the body other than the GI tract (e.g., tracheoesophageal, bronchopleural, 
urogenital, biliary) have been reported uncommonly (0.1% –1%) in patients 
receiving bevacizumab in clinical studies and postmarketing reports.  Event s 
were reported at various timepoints during treatment, ranging from 1  week to 
 [ADDRESS_302591], discontinuation of bevacizumab 
should be considered.  
Wou nd healing complications : Wound healing complications such as wound 
dehiscence have been reported in patients receiving bevacizumab. In an 
analysis of pooled data from two trials in metastatic colorectal cancer, patients 
undergoing surgery 28 -60 days befor e study treatment with 5 -FU/LV plus 
bevacizumab did not appear to have an increased risk of wound healing 
complications compared to those treated with chemotherapy alone. [26]  
[ADDRESS_302592] to wound healing risk in patients receiving elective 
surgery; however, the estimated half life of bevacizumab is 21 days. 
Bevacizumab should be discontinued in patients with severe wound healing 
complications.  
Hemorrhage : Overall, grade 3 a nd 4 bleeding events were observed in 4.0% 
of 1132 patients treated with bevacizumab in a pooled database from eight 
phase I, II, and III clinical trials in multiple tumor types (Bevacizumab 
Investigator Brochure, October 2005). The hemorrhagic events that  have been 
observed in bevacizumab clinical studies were predominantly tumor -
associated hemorrhage (see below) and minor mucocutaneous hemorrhage.  
Tumor -Associated Hemorrhage :  Major or massive pulmonary hemorrhage 
or hemoptysis has been observed primaril y in patients with NSCLC.  
Life-threatening and fatal hemoptysis was identified as a bevacizumab -related 
adverse event in NSCLC trials.  These events occurred suddenly and 
presented as major or massive hemoptysis.  Among the possible risk factors 
evaluated  (including squamous cell histology, treatment with 
anti-rheumatic/anti -inflammatory drugs, treatment with anticoagulants, prior 
radiotherapy, bevacizumab therapy, previous medical history of 
atherosclerosis, central tumor location, and cavitation of tumor s during 
therapy), the only variables that showed statistically significant correlations 
with bleeding were bevacizumab therapy and squamous cell histology.  
GI hemorrhages, including rectal bleeding and melena have been reported in 
patients with CRC, and h ave been assessed as tumor -associated 
hemorrhages.  
Tumor -associated hemorrhages were also seen rarely in other tumor types 
and locations, including a case of CNS bleeding in a patient with hepatoma 
with occult CNS metastases and a patient who developed con tinuous oozing 
of blood from a thigh sarcoma with necrosis.  
Mucocutaneous Hemorrhage :  Across all bevacizumab clinical trials, 
mucocutaneous hemorrhage has been seen in 20% -40% of patients treated 
with bevacizumab. These were most commonly NCI -CTC Grade [ADDRESS_302593] also been less common events of minor mucocutaneous 
hemorrhage in other locations, such as gingiv al bleeding and vaginal bleeding.  
Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome :  There have been 
rare reports of bevacizumab -treated patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_248855], a rare neurologic disorder that can present wit h 
the following signs and symptoms (among others):  seizures, headache, 
altered mental status, visual disturbance, or cortical blindness, with or without 
associated hypertension.  Brain imaging is mandatory to confirm the diagnosis 
of RPLS.  In patients wh o develop RPLS, treatment of specific symptoms, 
including control of hypertension, is recommended along with discontinuation 
of bevacizumab.  The safety of reinitiating bevacizumab therapy in patients 
previously experiencing RPLS is not known. [23, 24]

Congestive heart failure :  In clinical trials CHF was observed in all cancer 
indications studied to date, but predominantly in patients with metastatic 
breast cancer.  In the Phase III clinical trial of metastatic br east cancer 
(AVF2119g), 7 (3%) bevacizumab -treated patients experienced CHF, 
compared with two (1%) control arm patients.  These  events varied in severity 
from asymptomatic declines in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to 
symptomatic CHF requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47276].  All the patients 
treated with bevacizumab were previously treated with anthracyclines 
(doxorubicin cumulative dose of 240 360 mg/m2).  Many of these patients also 
had prior radiotherapy to the left chest wall.  Most of these  patients showed 
improved symptoms and/or left ventricular function following appropriate 
medical therapy .[27] 
In a randomized, Phase III trial of patients with previously untreated metastatic 
breast cancer (E2100), the incidence of LVEF decrease (defined as NCI -CTC 
Grade 3 or 4) in the paclitaxel   bevacizumab arm was 0.3% versus 0% for 
the paclitax el alone arm  
No information is available on patients with preexisting CHF of [LOCATION_001] 
Heart Association (NYHA) Class II IV at the time of initiating bevacizumab 
therapy, as these patients were excluded from clinical trials.  
Prior anthracyclines exposure a nd/or prior radiotherapy to the chest wall may 
be possible risk factors for the development of CHF.  Caution should be 
exercised before initiating bevacizumab therapy in patients with these risk 
factors.  
A Phase II trial in patients with refractory acute m yelogenous leukemia 
reported 5  cases of cardiac dysfunction (CHF or LVEF decrease to  40%) 
among 48  patients treated with sequential cytarabine, mitoxantrone, and 
bevacizumab.  All but 1 of these patients had significant prior exposure to 
anthracyclines a s well. [28]  
Two additional studies investigated concurrent administration of 
anthracyclines and bevacizumab.  In [ADDRESS_302594] 
cancer treated with neoadjuvant docetaxel, doxorubicin, and bev acizumab, no 
patients developed clinically apparent CHF; however, patients had 
asymptomatic decreases in LVEF to  40%. [29]  In a small Phase II study in 
patients with soft tissue sarcoma, 2 of the 17  patients trea ted with 
bevacizumab and high -dose doxorubicin (75 mg/m2) developed CHF 
(one Grade 3 event after a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 591  mg/m2, one 
Grade  4 event after a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 420  mg/m2); an 
additional 4  patients had asymptomatic decr eases in LVEF. [30] 
Other studies in patients with various tumor types and either a history of 
anthracycline exposure or concomitant use with bevacizumab are ongoing.  
Patients receiving concomitant anthracycline s or with prior exposure to 
anthracyclines should have a baseline MUGA scans or echocardiograms 
(ECHOs) with a normal LVEF.  
Neutropenia :  Increased rates of severe neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, or 
infection with severe neutropenia (including some fatal ities) have been 
observed in patients treated with some myelotoxic chemotherapy regimens 
plus bevacizumab in comparison to chemotherapy alone. [20]

Transcription profiling utilizes large -scale gene -expression analysis 
technology to identify differentially expressed genes and molecu lar 
signatures. [31, 32]   Data obtained from expression analyses has been 
used to examine tumor biology and to identify potential biomarkers as 
clinical correlates. [32]    We hypothesize that transcription profiling will 
provide differential gene signatures in patients with advanced staged 
ovarian cancer who experience different progres sion-free survival times 
and may require individualized treatment regimens.  Thus, these 
discoveries will help determine the molecular and biochemical basis of 
disease in patients with advanced staged ovarian, fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916], and 
primary peritoneal carcino ma. 
1.6.[ADDRESS_302596] been evaluated as potential diagnostic and 
prognostic markers in ovarian cancer.  They function primarily to 
regulate immunity, hematopoeisis, and inflammation.  Systemic cytokine 
levels differ in cancer pa tients, possibly due to an interaction between 
the disease and the immune system resulting in cytokine 
production. [33]   Various cytokines, including IL -6, IL-7, and IL -8, have 
been associated with ovarian cancer and identified as potential 
therapeutic and diagnostic t ools for the disease. [34-36]  Additionally, 
levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have been found to 
correlate significantly with patient survival and to be an independent 
prognostic indicator in over all survival in patients with ovarian 
cancer. [37]  
Plasma studies are included as an optional procedure to evaluate the 
correlation between cytokine levels with progression -free and overall 
survivals in patients treated with the bevacizumab, carboplatin, and 
weekly paclitaxel.  Previous studies indicate that the pre -treatment 
levels of VEGF in plasma, not serum, are associated with pro gression -
free and overall survival in patients with persistent or recurrent 
endometrial cancer or uterine leiomyosarcoma. [38, 39]   The exact 
choice of biomarkers to be evaluated and assays to be performed on 
plasma  specimens will be reevaluated based on evolving data in the 
field.  At the appropriate time, the current translational research 
objectives will be amended to incorporate a definitive translational 
research objective regarding angiogenic markers and cytoki nes that can 
be tested and validated utilizing specimens submitted for this protocol.  
A summary of relevant laboratory data will also be provided at that time 
to establish the background and rationale for that amendment.  
1.7  Study Rationale   
The use of b evacizumab in gynecologic oncology has been studied in the 
setting of recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_76296].  GOG -0170 -D utilized single 
agent bevacizumab in persistent or recurrent ovarian or primary peritoneal 
cancer and examined clinical response by [CONTACT_12134]/R ECIST criteria and proportion 
surviving progression -free for at least 6 months. [40]  Sixty -two patients were 
treated with bevacizumab 15 mg/kg intravenously every 21 days.  Thirteen 
patients had clinical responses with approximately 40% surviving progression 
free for at least six months.  Median PFS and overall survival w ere 4.[ADDRESS_302597] udy with single agent bevacizumab 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks. [41] 
The combination of bevacizumab with other cytotoxic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_248856]. [42]  It is 
hypothesized that increased sensitization to apoptosis or revers al of 
chemotherapeutic drug resistance occurs when the VEGF pathway is 
interrupted. [43]  In a study publis hed by [CONTACT_248880]., 15 patients were treated 
with biweekly intravenous bevacizumab 10 mg/kg plus oral cyclophosphamide 
50 mg daily. [44]  Two patients (13.3%) had a complet e response to treatment 
with 6 patients (40%) experiencing a partial response and 3 with stable 
disease.   Median PFS was 4.4 months for these patients.  Another study 
2009 -0186  
Revised April 26, 2016  
Page 15 of 58 
evaluated 10 patients with advanced, recurrent, refractory ovarian cancer who 
were treat ed with biweekly bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) and weekly paclitaxel. [45]  
During the study, all evaluable patients experienced a decrease in CA125 
within the first treatment cycle, and all experienced improved levels of pain, 
nausea, and ascites.  No grade [ADDRESS_302598], and non -small cell lung cancer. [19-22]  A 
phase III trial randomized [ADDRESS_302599] cancer patients to receive either weekly  
paclitaxel alone or with bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) on days 1 and 15. [21]  
Prolonged PFS (median 11.8 vs. 5.9 months, p<0.001) and objective response 
rate (36.9% vs. 21.2%, p<0.001) was noted in patients receiving the 
combination of paclitaxel and bevacizumab.  
The observed spectrum and degree of toxicity, su ch as arterial thrombotic and 
renovascular events, is similar in these trials. However, GOG 170 -D observed 
no gastrointestinal perforations or fistulae, unlike Genentech AVF 2949.  
During this trial, 5 such events occurred in 44 patients.  This led to ear ly 
termination of AVF 2949 and an IND Action Letter in 2005.  Some of the 
events occurred after discontinuing bevacizumab for disease progression.  
The potential for gastrointestinal perforations or fistulae is unknown at this 
time in patients with advance d recurrent ovarian cancer, and statistical 
variation cannot be excluded without a controlled trial.  Han et al. reviewed 
published data of open -labeled trials using bevacizumab in ovarian cancer and 
revealed an overall 5.2% incidence rate of gastrointesti nal perforation. [46]  
The management of the perforations and fistulas has involved either surgery 
or abscess drainage with bowl rest.  Specific risk factors for these events have 
not been identified and are currently under investi gation in GOG 0218.  
Limited data exists for the utilization of bevacizumab as first -line therapy in 
newly diagnosed ovarian cancer patients.  Currently GOG 0218 and ICON7 
are in the process of examining the use of bevacizumab in front -line ovarian 
cancer therapy.  GOG 0218 is a three -arm placebo -controlled trial to compare 
the overall survival in patients with stage III or IV disease who receive 
carboplatin/paclitaxel alone, carboplatin/paclitaxel administered concurrently 
with bevacizumab, or carboplatin/ paclitaxel administered concurrently with 
bevacizumab for an additional [ADDRESS_302600] high -risk, early -stage disease and evaluates the PFS in a two -arm trial, 
carboplatin/paclitaxel alone compared to carboplatin/pacl itaxel given 
concomitantly with bevacizumab for an extended 12 cycles.   
A phase II study evaluated the response rate and toxicity of intravenous  
paclitaxel (175 mg/m2), carboplatin (AUC 5), and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) 
administered every 21 days as primary induction therapy for patients with 
stage III or IV ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916] 
`adenocarcinoma. [47]  Eighteen patients were evaluated with a total response 
rate of 80% (6 CR, 10 PR).  A total of  116 cycles were administered with grade 
3 and 4 neutropenia in 23.3% and 25% of cycles and no incidence of grades 3 
or 4 thrombocytopenia or anemia.  No incidence of bowel perforations 
occurred, and 2 patients developed grade 3 hypertension.   
Dose dense administration of paclitaxel with weekly carboplatin prolongs PFS 
and overall survival. [9]  Additionally, bevacizumab appears to be active as a 
[ADDRESS_302601] 4 cycles of therapy 
regardless of delay or dose modification.

expression correlates with progression -free survival of patients with 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_12253], peritoneal primary or fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_8916] c ancer treated 
with bevacizumab, carboplatin, and weekly paclitaxel.  
2.3.2  To assess the relationship among  cytokines /chemokines, angiogenic 
factors, novel targets of interest,  and clinical outcome including tumor 
response and progression -free survival in patients treated with 
bevacizumab, carboplatin, and weekly  paclitaxel.  
 
3.0 STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 Description of the Study  
Patients with newly diagnosed ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_248858] (AUC 5 ) and paclitaxel ( 80 
mg/m2) on Day 1 of Cycle 1.  They  will also receive paclitaxel (8 0 mg/m2) on 
Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1.  On Day 1 of Cycles 2 through 6, patients  will 
receive carboplatin (AUC 5 ), paclitaxel ( 80 mg/m2) and bevacizumab (15 
mg/kg).  They will continue to receive paclitaxel ( 80 mg/m2) on Days 8 an d 15.  
2009 -0186  
Revised April 26, 2016  
Page 17 of 58 
Patients will be treated for a total of 6 cycles.  One cycle of therapy consists of 
21 days.   
3.2 Rationale for Study Design  
A recent study performed by [CONTACT_248881]  
(JGOG) found the median progression -free survival and o verall survival to be 
longer in ovarian cancer patients receiving weekly paclitaxel with carboplatin 
compared to tri -weekly carboplatin and paclitaxel. [9]  Grade 3 and 4 anemia 
occurred more frequently, however, in the group receiving weekly treatment.  
Overall 60% of patients received at least 6 cycles of chemotherapy treatment 
on the study.  A prospective trial utilizing tri -weekly carboplatin (AUC 6), bi-
weekly bevacizumab (10 mg/kg), and weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) in 
melanoma patients found the regimen to be moderately well -tolerated with 
62.2% of patients requiring dose reduction for toxicity. [48]  This stud y is 
designed to evaluate the tolerability of combination bevacizumab and 
carboplatin with weekly paclitaxel as first -line treatment in patients with 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_12253], primary peritoneal, and fallopi[INVESTIGATOR_248859] a  single -
arm, non -randomized, open label phase II study.  
3.[ADDRESS_302602] 4 cycles of combination therapy 
(bevacizumab with carboplatin and weekly paclitaxel) regardless of 
delay or dose modification.  
3.3.2  Secondary Outcome Measures  
[IP_ADDRESS]  A secondary endpoint will be the evaluation of progression -free 
survival in patients treated with bevacizumab and carboplatin 
with weekly paclitaxel.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  The evaluat ion of response proportion based on RECIST v1.1 
criteria will be examined in patients treated with bevacizumab 
and carboplatin with weekly paclitaxel.  
 
4.0 Safety Plan  
See Section 4.1 for complete details of the safety evaluation for this study.  
4.1 Gener al Plan to Manage Safety  
a.  Bevacizumab -Specific  
A number of measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients 
participating in this trial.  These measures will be addressed through exclusion 
criteria (see Section 5.3) and routine monitoring as follow s. 
Patients enrolled in this study will be evaluated clinically and with standard 
laboratory tests before and at regular intervals during their participation in this 
study.  Safety evaluations will consist of medical interviews, recording of 
adverse events , physical examinations, blood pressure, and laboratory 
measurements.   Patients will be evaluated for adverse events (all grades), 
serious adverse events, and adverse events requiring study drug interruption 
2009 -0186  
Revised April 26, 2016  
Page 18 of 58 
or discontinuation at each study visit for the duration of their participation in 
the study.  Patients discontinued from the treatment phase of the study for any 
reason will be evaluated ~30  days (28 –42 days) after the decision to 
discontinue treatment (see Section 7.4.2) unless patients are discontinu ed 
from the study due to an ongoing bevacizumab -related Grade 4 or serious 
adverse event. These patients will continue to be followed until resolution of 
the event or until the event is considered irreversible.  
Specific monitoring procedures are as follows : 
 Hypertension will be monitored through routine evaluation of blood 
pressure prior to each bevacizumab treatment.  Optimal control of blood 
pressure according to standard public health guidelines is recommended 
for patients on treatment with or without be vacizumab.  
 Proteinuria will be monitored by [CONTACT_39701] -creatinine ratio (UPCR) at 
least every 6 weeks.

Bevacizumab specifically inhibits VEGF, which is responsible for 
formation of new blood vessels during development, and antibodies can 
cross the placenta.  
Therefore, bevacizumab should not be administered to pregnant 
women. Subjects will be  apprised of the large potential risk to a

bevacizumab should be re -calcula ted based on any body weight 
change ≥ 10%.   
6.1.6  Protocol therapy can be administered 1 day prior to or up to 1 week 
after scheduled administration date to allow for calendar events in 
patient’s life (e.g. holidays, weddings, vacations, etc.)  Any other

6.2 Translational Research  
6.2.1  Gene Expression Microarrays  
The tumor repository will supply frozen tissue samples from 10 patients 
with PFS <= 6 mos and 10 patients  with PFS >= 21 months. These 
subgroups will be chosen so that effects due to optimal/suboptimal 
debulking are separately estimable – we will avoid complete 
confounding. Once acquired, these samples will be profiled using gene 
expression microarrays (Affym etrix HGU133+v2) run 
contemporaneously as part of one operating batch, or in balanced 
blocks if multiple batches are needed.  Genomic analysis will identify 
distinct molecular signatures and provide a foundation for the discovery 
of tumor response biomarke rs in future larger, collaborative studies.  
The exact choice of biomarkers to be evaluated and validated will be 
reevaluated based on evolving data in the field.

7.2 PROTOCOL SPECIFIED C HEMOTHERAPY  
7.2.1  Paclitaxel  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Paclitaxel Administration  
Paclitaxel (Taxol) is a poorly soluble plant product from the 
western yew, Taxus brevifolia. Improved solubility requires a 
mixed solvent system with further dilutions of either 0.9% 
sodium chloride or 5% dextrose in water. Paclitaxel is 
commercially available from Bristol -Myers Oncology. A sterile 
solution concentrat e, 6 mg/ml available in 5 ml (30 mg/vial), 
16.7 ml (100 mg/vial) and 50 ml (300 mg/vial) in 
polyoxyethylated castor oil (Cremophor EL) 50% and 
dehydrated alcohol, USP, 50%. The contents of the vial must 
be diluted just prior to clinical use.  
Paclitaxel, at  the appropriate dose, will be diluted in 250 - 1000 
cc of 0.9% Sodium Chloride injection, USP or 5% Dextrose 
injection, USP [D5W (500 cc's is adequate if paclitaxel is a 
single agent]. Paclitaxel must be prepared in glass or polyolefin 
containers due to le aching of diethylhexlphthalate (DEHP) 
plasticizer from polyvinylchloride (PVC) bags and intravenous 
tubing by [CONTACT_248883]. NOTE: Formation of a small number of fibers in 
solution (within acceptable limits establ ished by [CONTACT_248884]'s) has been observed after 
preparation of paclitaxel. Therefore, in -line filtration is 
necessary for administration of paclitaxel solutions. In -line 
filtration should be accomplished by [CONTACT_8246] a hydro philic, 
microporous filter of pore size not greater than 0.22 microns 
(e.g.: IVEX -II, IVEX -HP, or equivalent) into the IV fluid pathway 
distal to the infusion pump. Although particulate formation does 
not indicate loss of drug potency, solutions exhibiting  excessive 
particulate matter formation should not be used.  
Thirty minutes before the paclitaxel infusion is to begin the 
patient is further premedicated with dexamethasone [ADDRESS_302623]: 
cimetidine 300 mg  IV, or ranitidine 50 mg IV, or famotidine 20 
mg IV.  
Paclitaxel, at the appropriate dose and dilution, will be given as 
a continuous IV infusion over 180 minutes + 15 minutes. 
Paclitaxel will be administered via an infusion control device 
(pump) using non -PVC tubing and connectors, such as the IV 
administration sets (polyethylene or polyolefin), which are used 
to infuse parenteral Nitroglycerin. Nothing else other than 0.9% 
sodium chloride is to be infused through the line where 
paclitaxel is being administ ered.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Paclitaxel Storage and Stability  
The intact vials should be stored under refrigeration (2 -8°C). 
Commercially available paclitaxel will be labeled with an 
2009 -0186  
Revised April 26, 2016  
Page 26 of 58 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_320]. All solutions of paclitaxel exhibit a slight 
haziness directly proport ional to the concentration of drug and 
the time elapsed after preparation, although when prepared as 
described above, solutions of paclitaxel (0.3 - 1.2 mg/ml) are 
physically and chemically stable for 27 hours.  
7.2.2  Carboplatin  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Carboplatin Admin istration  
Carboplatin is supplied as a sterile, pyrogen -free, 10mg/mL 
aqueous solution in multi -dose vials containing 50mg/5mL, 
150mg/15mL, 450mg/45mL, or 600g/60mL of carboplatin.  
Carboplatin aqueous solution can be further diluted to 
concentrations as l ow as 0.5mg/mL with 5% Dextrose in Water 
or 0.9% Sodium Chloride for Injection, USP.  
Carboplatin infusion will be administered following paclitaxel, at 
the appropriate dose and dilution and will be given as a 
continuous IV infusion over 30 minutes + 15 min utes. 
Carboplatin will be administered via an infusion control device 
(pump) using non -PVC tubing and connectors.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Carboplatin Dosing  
The Carboplatin dose will be calculated to reach a target area 
under the curve (AUC) according to the Calvert form ula using 
an estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from the 
Cockcroft -Gault formula.  
The initial dose of carboplatin will be calculated using GFR. In 
the absence of new renal obstruction or other renal toxicity 
greater than or equal to CTCAE Grade 2 [serum creatinine >1.[ADDRESS_302624]] or toxicity requiring dose modification, the dose of 
carboplatin will NOT be recalculated for subsequent cycles, but 
will be subject to dose modification as noted in the protocol.  
Carboplatin doses are based on the patient’s w eight at baseline 
and will not be recalculated unless the patient has a weight 
change of greater than or equal to 10% from baseline.  
In patients with abnormally low serum creatinine (less than 0.7 
mg/dl), the creatinine clearance will be estimated using a 
minimum value of 0.7 mg/dl.  
Calvert formula: Carboplatin dose (mg) = target AUC x (GFR + 
25) 
Note: The GFR used in the Calvert formula should not exceed 
125 ml/min.  
The maximum Carboplatin dose (mg) = target AUC (mg/ml x 
min) x 150 ml/min  
The maximum all owed doses of Carboplatin are:  
AUC 5 = 750 mg  
AUC 4 = 600 mg  
2009 -0186  
Revised April 26, 2016  
Page 27 of 58 
For the purposes of this protocol, the GFR is considered 
equivalent to the estimated creatinine clearance. The estimated 
creatinine clearance (ml/min) is calculated by [CONTACT_248885] -Gault using the following formula:  
Creatinine Clearance (mL/min) = [140–age (yrs)] x weight (kg) x 0.85  
 72 x serum creatinine (mg/dl)  
Actual weight is used for estimation of GFR for patients with a 
BMI of less than 25. Adjusted weight is used for patients wi th a 
BMI of greater than or equal to 25.  
Dose Modification for toxicity:  
If the creatinine at the time of dose modification is lower than 
the creatinine used to calculate the previous dose, use the 
previous (higher) creatinine; if the creatinine at the tim e of a 
dose modification is higher than the creatinine used to calculate 
the previous dose, use the current (higher) creatinine. This 
ensures that the patient is actually receiving a dose reduction.  
[IP_ADDRESS]   Carboplatin Storage and Stability  
Unopened vial s of carboplatin are stable to the date indicated 
on the package when stored at 25°C (77°F).  Excursions from 
15 to 30°C (59 to 86°F) are permitted.  Protect from light.  
Carboplatin multi dose vials maintain microbial, chemical, and 
physical stability for  up to 14 days at 25°C following multiple 
needle entries.   When prepared as directed, carboplatin 
aqueous solutions are stable for 8 hours at room temperature 
(25°C / 77°F).  Since no antibacterial preservative is contained 
in the formulation, it is recom mended that carboplatin solutions 
be discarded 8 hours after dilution.  
Aluminum reacts with carboplatin causing precipi[INVESTIGATOR_69090]; therefore, needles or intravenous sets 
containing aluminum parts that may come in contact [CONTACT_248886].  
7.3 CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS  
Low-dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (≤ 325 mg/d) may be continued in subjects at higher risk for 
arterial thromboembolic disease. Subjects developi[INVESTIGATOR_248869] 7.4.2 Table 1, Bevacizumab Dose

7.4  DOSE MODIFICATIONS AND TOXICITY MANAGEMENT  
7.4.1  General Modifications  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Management of Hypersensitivity Reactions  
In general, the occurrence of a hypersensitivity reaction to 
paclitaxel, carboplatin, or bevacizumab is not considered a 
2009 -0186  
Revised April 26, 2016  
Page 28 of 58 
dose -limiting toxicity.  Patients may be retreated at full doses 
after administratio n of medication to prevent hypersensitivity 
reactions, and adjustments to infusion rates should be made.  
However, if despi[INVESTIGATOR_248870] a recurrent 
hypersensitivity reaction, the inciti ng drug should be 
discontinued for the remainder of the study.   
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Hypersensitivity to bevacizumab  
Infusion of bevacizumab should be interrupted for 
subjects who develop dyspnea or clinically significant 
hypotension. Subjects who experience a CTCAE 
Grade 3 or 4 allergic reaction / hypersensitivity, adult 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], or bronchospasm 
(regardless of grade) will be discontinued from 
bevacizumab treatment.  
The infusion should be slowed to 50% or less or 
interrupted for subjects who experience a ny infusion -
associated symptoms not specified above. When the 
subject’s symptoms have completely resolved, the 
infusion may be continued at no more than 50% of 
the rate prior to the reaction and increased in 50% 
increments every 30 minutes if well tolerate d. 
Infusions may be restarted at the full rate during the 
next cycle.  
In the event of a prior bevacizumab hypersensitivity 
reaction, subsequent infusions should be delivered 
over 90 minutes, and the following prophylactic 
regimen is recommended upon re -exposure:  
 H1 blocker (diphenhydramine 25 -50 mg IVP or 
orally one hour prior to injection; or an equivalent 
dose of an alternate H1 blocker such as loratadine 
10 mg or fexofenadine 60 mg).  
 H2 blocker (famotidine 20 mg IVP or orally one 
hour prior to injection ; or an equivalent dose of an 
alternate H2 blocker).  
 Dexamethasone (10 mg administered PO 12 and 
6 hours prior to bevacizumab injection).  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Hypersensitivity to paclitaxel  
Hypersensitivity reactions to paclitaxel or its vehicle 
(Cremophor) occur almost unive rsally during the first 
few minutes of infusion. Continued treatment may be 
considered if the reaction was not life -threatening; 
however, patients must be cautioned of potential 
recurrences of the reaction. Should the patient 
decide to continue with treatm ent it is preferable that 
this be done on the same day of the occurrence.  
2009 -0186  
Revised April 26, 2016  
Page 29 of 58 
A suggested procedure would be to repeat the 
patient’s premedication with dexamethasone 20mg 
IV, cimetidine 300mg (or ranitidine 50mg) IV, and 
diphenhydramine 50mg IV [ADDRESS_302625] with 1 ml of 
the original IV solution diluted in 100 ml over one 
hour, then 5 ml in 100 ml over one hour, then 10 ml 
in 100 ml over one hour, and finall y the original 
solution at the original infusion rate. No additional 
dose adjustments should be made for other 
hypersensitivity reactions.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  General Guidelines for Hematologic Toxicity  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_302626] of cycl e 
delay and/or dose reduction as indicated below. The 
use of hematopoietic cytokines and protective 
reagents are restricted as noted:  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Treatment decisions will be based on the absolute 
neutrophil count (ANC) rather than the total white cell 
count  (WBC).  
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Lower Limits for ANC and Platelet Count  
Subsequent treatment with bevacizumab, 
carboplatin, and paclitaxel on Day 1 of each cycle will 
not be given until the ANC is ≥ 1500 cells/mm3 
(CTCAE Grade 1) and the platelet count is ≥ 
100,000/ul.  Therapy will be delayed for a maximum 
of three weeks until these values are achieved. 
Patients who fail to recover adequate counts within a 
three -week delay will be removed from study.  
Treatment with weekly paclitaxel on Days 7 and 14 of 
each cycle will n ot be given unless ANC is ≥ 1000 
cells/mm3 and the platelet count is ≥ 75,000/ul.  
Paclitaxel therapy will be delayed for a maximum of 
three weeks until these values are achieved. Patients 
who fail to recover adequate counts within a three -
week delay will be removed from study.  If day 7 
dosing criteria are not met, hold the paclitaxel dose 
and treat on day 14 as planned if toxicity has 
resolved.  If day 14 dosing criteria are not met, hold 
the paclitaxel dose.  Start the next full cycle (ie. Day 
1 treatmen t) one week later if toxicity has resolved.   
Exceptions:  
 Patients who received G -CSF prior to  the current 
cycle may begin with ANC ≥ 1000 cells/mm3, if 
clinically appropriate, to allow for transient 
reductions in ANC after discontinuation of G -CSF.  
2009 -0186  
Revised April 26, 2016  
Page 30 of 58 
 Patients who are delayed more than 7 days may 
begin with ANC ≥ 1000 cells/mm3, if clinically 
appropr iate, as they will receive G -CSF with 
subsequent therapy.  
[IP_ADDRESS].4  Use of Hematopoeitic Cytokines and Protective Agents  
 Patients will NOT receive prophylactic growth 
factors [filgrastim (GCSF), sargramostim (GM -
CSF)] unless they experience recurrent 
neutropenic complications after treatment 
modifications specified below (Section 7.4.4).  In 
particular, hematopoietic growth factors should 
not be used to avoid initial chemotherapy dose 
modifications as stipulated in the protocol.  
However, patients may also  receive growth 
factors for management of neutropenic 
complications in accordance with clinical 
treatment guidelines.  If required, it is 
recommended that growth factors be initiated the 
day after the last dose of chemotherapy and 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_248871] l the ANC is sustained 
above > 1000/ mm3.  Growth factors should be 
discontinued if the ANC exceeds 10,000/mm3 and 
should not be used within 72 hours of a 
subsequent dose of chemotherapy.   
 Patients will not be eligible to receive PEG -
filgrastim (Neulasta)  on study due to the weekly 
dose schedule of paclitaxel.  
 Patients will NOT receive prophylactic 
thrombopoietic agents unless they experience 
recurrent grade 4 thrombocytopenia after 
treatment modifications as specified below 
(Section 7.4.4).  
 Patients may r eceive erythropoietin (EPO), iron 
supplements, and/or transfusions as clinically 
indicated for management of anemia.  Treating 
physicians should be aware of the recent 
changes in prescribing information for the 
erythropoiesis stimulating agents (including 
Aranesp, Epogen, and Procrit) which note that 
there is a potential risk of shortening the time to 
tumor progression or disease -free survival and 
that these agents are administered only to avoid 
red blood cell transfusions.  They do not alleviate 
fatigue or  increase energy.  They should not be 
used in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.  
They can cause an increased incidence of 
thrombotic events in cancer patients on 
chemotherapy.  The updated package inserts

 Patients may NOT receive amifostine or other 
protective agents.  
 For first occurrence of febrile neutropenia, and/or 
documented grade 4 neutropenia persisting ≥ 7 
days, add growth factors. In this circumstance, it 
is recommend ed that growth factors (G -CSF) at a 
dose of 5 μg/kg/day (or equivalent dose of 
sargramostim) will be administered 
subcutaneously starting the day after the last 
dose of chemotherapy and continuing through 
hematopoietic recovery. Growth factors should 
not b e used within 72 hours of a subsequent dose 
of chemotherapy.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Special Modifications  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  For  any CTCAE Grade 3 non -hematologic adverse 
event (except controllable nausea/emesis) 
considered to be at least possibly related to study 
treatment, protocol directed treatment should be held 
until symptoms resolve to <= CTCAE Grade 1. If a

[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_302627]. Bevac izumab has a terminal half -life of 21 days; therefore, its 
discontinuation results in slow elimination over several months. There is 
no available antidote for bevacizumab.  
Subjects should be assessed clinically for toxicity prior to, during, and 
after eac h infusion. If unmanageable toxicity occurs because of 
bevacizumab at any time during the study, treatment with bevacizumab 
should be discontinued.  
Adverse events requiring delays or permanent discontinuation of 
bevacizumab are listed in Table 1.  
Patient s requiring permanent discontinuation of bevacizumab due to 
bevacizumab toxicities will continue on study with protocol -directed

Hypertension  
Patients should be monitored prior to each bevacizumab dose with measurement 
of blood pressure. Medication classes used for management of patients with 
Grade 3 hypertension receiving bevacizumab include angiotensin -converting 
enzyme inhi bitors, beta blockers, diuretics, and calcium channel blockers. The goal 
for blood pressure control should be consistent with general medical practice 
guidelines (i.e. <140/90 mmHg). The use of anxiolytics in conjunction with specific 
anti-hypertensive age nts is not prohibited.  
 For controlled hypertension, defined as systolic <140 mm Hg and diastolic <90 
mm Hg, continue therapy.  
 For uncontrolled hypertension (systolic >140 mm Hg or diastolic >90) or
  
symptomatic hypertension less than CTCAE Grade 4, hold b evacizumab and 
initiate or modify anti -hypertensive therapy as needed.  
 If hypertension is controlled and symptomatic hypertension has resolved by [CONTACT_248888], continue all therapy.  
 If hypertension remains uncontrolled or symptomatic hypertension less than 
CTCAE Grade 4 persists one week after holding treatment, the next treatment 
cycle should contain paclitaxel and carboplatin only with bevacizumab omitted.  
Patient may receive bevacizumab therapy if hypertension is controlled for

already been evaluated, if we determine th at there is less than a 5% chance that 
the treatment success rate is 60% or more we will stop the trial.  This decision rule 
gives the following stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877].  We assume a uniform prior distribution for the 
treatment success rate.  Stop the trial if

our 90% credible interval for the treatment success rate will be 61.7% to 86.5%.  We 
will also report  the posterior probability that the treatment success rate is 60% or

(longest dimension to be r ecorded). Each lesion must be ≥[ADDRESS_302645], and MRI, or ≥[ADDRESS_302646] x -ray.[51]  PET scanning information will not be 
evidence of disease progression or measurab le disease.  
PET CT Fusion studies may not meet technical 
requirements.  
To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node should be ≥15mm by [CONTACT_248893].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Baseline Documentation of “Target” and “Non -Target” 
Lesions  
 All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per 
organ and 5 lesions in total representative of all involved 
organs should be  identified as target lesions and will be 
recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions 
should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with 
the longest dimension) and their suitability for accurate 
repetitive measurements by [CONTACT_248894] (either by [CONTACT_14217]).  A 
sum of diameters for all target lesions will be calculated 
and reported as the baseline sum.  Only the short axis of 
lymph nodes classified as measurable will contribute to 
the baseline sum.  The baseline sum will be used as 
reference to further characterize the objective tumor 
response of the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 All other lesions (or sites of disease), including 
pathological lymph nodes ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis, 
should be i dentified as non-target lesions and should also 
be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required 
and these lesions should be followed as “present” or 
“absent”.  
 All baseline evaluations of disease status should be 
performed as close as possible to th e start of treatment 
and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of 
treatment.  
 Tumor lesions that are situated in previously irradiated 
area might or might not be considered measurable.  
2009 -0186  
Revised April 26, 2016  
Page 47 of 58 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Best Response  
Measurement of the longest dimension of ea ch lesion size is 
required for follow -up. Change in the sum of these 
dimensions affords some estimate of change in tumor size 
and hence therapeutic efficacy. All disease must be 
assessed using the same technique as baseline. Reporting 
of these changes in a n individual case should be in terms of 
the best response achieved by [CONTACT_248895] . 
 Complete Response (CR)  is disappearance of all target and 
non-target  lesions and no evidence of new lesions 
documented by [CONTACT_248896].  Any  pathological 
lymph node (whether target or non -target) must have 
reduction in short axis to <10mm.   
 Partial Response (PR)  is at least a 30% decrease in the sum 
of diameters of all target measurable lesions taking as 
reference the baseline sum of diameter s.  There can be no 
unequivocal progression of nontarget lesions and no new 
lesions. Documentation by [CONTACT_248897] 
4 weeks apart is required. In the case where the ONLY 
target lesion is a solitary pelvic mass measured by [CONTACT_248898], which is not radiographically measurable, a 50% 
decrease in the LD is required.  
 Increasing Disease  is at least a 20% increase in the sum of 
diameters of target lesions taking as references the smallest 
sum on study.  In addition to the 20% relative increas e, the 
sum must also have an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  
The appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progressive disease.  Unequivocal progression 
of existing non-target lesions, other than pleural effusions 
without cytological pr oof of neoplastic origin, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_248875] 8 weeks of study entry is also 
considered increasing disease (in this circumstance an 
explanation must be provided). In the case where the ONLY 
target lesion is a solitary pelvic mas s measured by [CONTACT_248898], which is not radiographically measurable, a 50% 
increase in the LD is required.  
 Symptomatic deterioration  is defined as a global 
deterioration in health status attributable to the disease 
requiring a change in therapy without o bjective evidence of 
progression.  
 Stable Disease  is any condition not meeting the above 
criteria.  
 Inevaluable for response  is defined as having no repeat 
tumor assessments following initiation of study therapy for 
reasons unrelated  to symptoms or signs of disease . 
2009 -0186  
Revised April 26, 2016  
Page 48 of 58 
 The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any 
effusion that appears or worsens during treatment when the 
measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable 
disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or 
stable disea se (an effusion may be a side effect of the 
treatment) and progressive disease.  
 Progression Based on Serum CA -125:    
Progression can be based upon serum CA -125, only during 
the period following completion of cytotoxic chemotherapy, if 
one of the three con ditions is met:  
1. Patients with elevated CA -[ADDRESS_302647] one week apart  
When disease progression is defined by [CONTACT_28474] -125 criteria 
alone, imaging using the same modality and encompassing 
the same field as in the initial pre -treatment evaluation 
should be o btained within 2 weeks that such progression is 
documented.  
 Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring 
discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of 
disease progression at that time should be reported as 
“symptomatic deter ioration” .  Every effort should be made to 
document the objective progression even after 
discontinuation of treatment.  
 In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish 
residual disease from normal tissue.  When the evaluation of 
complete response  depends on this determination, it is 
recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (ie. 
fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]/biopsy) before confirming the 
complete response status.  
 In some cases a discrepancy may exist between trends in 
CA-[ADDRESS_302648] or MRI 
(and physical examination) should take precedence over 
CA-125.  For example, if there is evidence of disease on CT, 
MRI, or physical examination, and none of these areas  
2009 -0186  
Revised April 26, 2016  
Page 49 of 58 
demonstrate any progression then rising CA -125 levels 
would be insufficient to determine disease progression.  
 Patients who are not evaluated for response will be 
classified as either: having no target lesions at the time of 
enrollment onto the study, not reassessed due to early 
death, or unknown (not assessable, or insufficient data).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Confirmatory Measurement/Duration of 
Response  
Confirmation :  In order for a patient to be assigned a status 
of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements must be 
confi rmed by [CONTACT_248899] [ADDRESS_302649] 
met. 
Duration of overall response :  The duration of overall 
response is measured from the time measurement criteria 
are met for CR or PR (whi chever is first recorded) until the 
first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively 
documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment 
started).  
The duration of overall CR is measu red from the time 
measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date 
that recurrent disease is objectively documented.   
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from 
the start of the treatment until the criteria for progression a re 
met, taking as reference the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started.  
[IP_ADDRESS]     Progression -Free Survival  
Progression -Free Survival  is the period from study entry until 
disease progression, death or date of last contact.  
The define d date of disease progression will depend on the 
method of determination as follows:  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_302650] a 20% increase in the sum of 
the LD of target lesions, the appearance of one or 
more new l esions, or unequivocal progression of 
existing non target lesions, the date of progression 
will be defined as the date such lesions were first 
found to be progressed by [CONTACT_204670].  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  For disease progression defined by [CONTACT_248900], the 
date of progression will be defined as the date of 
cytologic verification.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_302651] date of the initial CA125  of 
greater than or equal to two times the nadir value 
or upper limit of normal, whichever of these is 
applicable.  Given that imaging using the same 
modality and encompassing the same field as in 
the initial pre treatment evaluation is required 
within 2 w eeks of the confirmatory (second) 
CA125 value, if imaging criteria are met for 
progression, then the date of progression would 
be defined as the date of the imaging study.  
[IP_ADDRESS].4  In the case where the ONLY target lesion is a 
solitary pelvic mass measured by [CONTACT_248901], a 50% 
increase in the LD is required taking as reference 
the smallest LD recorded since study entry.  
[IP_ADDRESS].5   Death due to disease without prior objective 
documentation of progression.  
[IP_ADDRESS].6  Global deterioration in hea lth status attributable to 
the disease requiring a change in therapy without 
objective evidence of progression.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Overall Survival  
Overall Survival  is the observed length of life from entry into 
the study to death, regardless of cause or the date of last 
contact. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Subjective Parameters  
Subjective Parameters  including performance status, 
specific symptoms, and side effects are graded according to 
the CTCAE v3.0.  
11.2.2  Methods of Analysis  
 This is a traditional phase II study and, hence, no 
randomization or compariso n group is involved.  
 The principal parameters employed to evaluate the efficacy of 
each agent are:  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Progression -free survival (PFS)  
We will estimate the PFS with the Kaplan -Meier 
product -limit estimator stratified by [CONTACT_248902] 
(optimal, sub -optimal). [53]  We will use the Co x 
proportional hazards regression model [54] to assess 
the associati on of gene expression and cytokines with 
PFS as described below.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  The frequency and duration of objective response.  
We will estimate the frequency of objective response 
with a 95% confidence interval separately for optimally 
debulked patients and sub -optima lly debulked patients. 
2009 -0186

For those patients who achieve an objective response 
we will estimate the duration of objective response with 
a 95% confidence interval separately for optimally 
debulked patients and sub -optimally debulked patients. 
We will use logis tic regression methods to assess the 
association between cytokines and objective response.  
The frequency and severity of observed adverse effects.  
We will tabulate the frequency and severity of observed 
adverse events separately for optimally debulked 
patients and sub -optimally debulked patients, as well as 
for all patients together.  
11.[ADDRESS_302652] Multichip Analysis. [55]  
After quantification, we will fit Cox proportional hazards models on a gene by 
[CONTACT_248903], with gene expression levels and debulking status as covariates; 
we seek cases where the gene expression coefficients are significant.  We 
will adjust for multiple comparisons using beta -uniform mixture (BUM) models 
[56],  and seek genes that remain significant at a false discovery rate (FDR) 
of 0.2. Given the mechanism of action for bevacizumab, this analysis will be 
repeated with attention restricted to the subset of genes a ssociated with 
angiogenesis according to Gene Ontology.

baseline  cytokine levels at time of initial measurement, and (2) post -pre 
differences in cytokine levels. In both cases, we will assess significance by 
[CONTACT_248904] d ebulking status as an additional 
covariate, and looking at the significance of the cytokine coefficient term. We 
will correct for multiple testing using a conservative Bonferroni adjustment, 
dividing the target p -value for significance by [CONTACT_248905].

12.2 REPORTING OF SERIOUS  TREATMENT EMERGENT A DVERSE 
EVENTS  
All STEAEs should be recorded on a MedWatch 3500a Form and faxed to:  
1)  Genentech Drug Safety  Fax: (650) 225 -4682 or (650) 225 -5288  
AND  
2)  Judith Wolf, Principal Investigator   [CONTACT_7626]: (713)792 -7310   Fax: 
(713)745 -8276  
AND  
3) MDACC IRB Contact: [CONTACT_248906]: (713) 794 -
4589  
Please use safety reporting fax cover sheet in Appendix G for your fax 
transmission.  
MedWatch 3500a Reporting Guidelines:  
In addition to completing appropriate patient demographic and suspect 
medication information, the report should include the following information 
within the Event Description (section 5) of the MedWatch 3500a form:  
 Treatment regimen (dosing frequency, combination therapy)  
 Protocol description (and number, if assigned)  
2009 -0186  
Revised April 26, 2016  
Page 53 of 58 
 Description of event, severity, treatment, and outcome, if known  
 Supportive laboratory results and diagnostics  
 Investigator’s assessment of the relationsh ip of the adverse event to each 
investigational product and suspect medication  
Follow -up information:  
Additional information may be added to a previously submitted report by [CONTACT_248907]:  
 Adding to the original MedWatch 3500a report and sub mitting it as 
follow -up 
 Adding supplemental summary information and submitting it as follow -
up with the original MedWatch 3500a form  
 Summarizing new information and faxing it with a cover letter including 
subject identifiers (i.e. D.O.B. initial, subject number), protocol 
description and number, if assigned, suspect drug, brief adverse event 
description, and notation that additional or follow -up information is being 
submitted  (The subject identifiers are important so that the new 
information is added to t he correct initial report)  
Occasionally Genentech may contact [CONTACT_15483], 
clarification, or current status of the subject for whom and adverse event was 
reported.  
Assessing Causality:  
Investigators are required to assess wheth er there is a reasonable possibility 
that bevacizumab caused or contributed to an adverse event.  The following 
general guidance may be used.  
Yes: if the temporal relationship of the clinical event to bevacizumab 
administration makes a causal relationship possible, and other drugs, 
therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions do not provide a 
sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
No: if the temporal relationship of the clinical event to bevacizumab 
administration makes a causal relationship u nlikely, or other drugs, 
therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions provide a sufficient 
explanation for the observed event.  
12.3 Safety Reporting Requirements for IND Exempt Studies  
For Investigator Sponsored IND Exempt Studies , there are some rep orting 
requirements for the FDA in accordance with the guidance set forth in 21 CFR 
314.80.  
Postmarketing 15 -Day “Alert Report” : 
The Sponsor -Investigator is required to notify the FDA of any fatal or life -
threatening adverse event that is unexpected and as sessed by [CONTACT_248908] . An 
unexpected adverse event is one that is not already described in the 
Investigator Brochure. Such reports are to be submitted to the FDA (2 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014])

2 of 54  SUMMARY  
Indication:  
This trial will enroll subjects who received tremelimumab (prev iously known as CP-275,206) 
in other trials and are no longer going to receive tremelimumab  in the other trial.  
Rationale:  
Tremelimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody. It binds to the CTLA4 molecule, 
which is expressed on the surface of activated T lymphocytes. T he binding of CTLA4 to its 
target ligands (B7-1 and B7-2) pr ovides a negative regulatory s ignal, which limits T-cell 
activation.  Tremelimumab antagonizes binding of CTLA4 to B7 li gands and enhances 
human T-cell activation as demonstrated by [CONTACT_47505] ( interleukin-2, interferon-
gamma) production in vitro in whole blood or peripheral blood m ononuclear cells cultures.  
Tremelimumab is thought to stimulate subjects’ immune systems t o attack their tumors by 
[CONTACT_47506] a negative regulatory signal, as mentioned above.    
The anti-tumor activity of antibodies to CTLA4 has been demonst rated in a variety of murine 
tumor models. Tremelimumab has also been shown to induce durabl e tumor responses in 
subjects with metastatic melanoma in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinic al studies.    
More complete information is available in the current tremelimu mab Investigator Brochure.  
Objectives:   
Primary Objective  
x To allow access to tremelimumab for subjects who received treme limumab in other trials  
Secondary Objectives  
x To follow long-term survival and tumor status of subjects treat ed with tremelimumab in 
other trials  
x To monitor the safety and tolerability of tremelimumab  
 
Trial Design:  
This is a multi-center, international, open label study.  Eligi ble subjects are those who have 
received tremelimumab in another protocol but are no longer goi ng to receive tremelimumab 
in the other trial.  All subjects who are enrolled in this tria l will have the opportunity to 
receive tremelimumab.  Doses may be delayed under certain circu mstances at the discretion 
of the investigator.  Subjects not receiving tremelimumab shoul d be seen in the clinic or 
contact[CONTACT_47507] 6 months to determine their tumor stat us until the time of final 
analysis.

10 of 54  1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background 
Rationale for tremelimumab (previously known as CP-675,206) in Melanoma and Other 
Tumors:  
Tremelimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody.  It binds to  the CTLA4 molecule, 
which is expressed on the surface of activated T lymphocytes.  The binding of CTLA4 to its 
target ligands (B7-1 and B7-2) pr ovides a negative regulatory s ignal, which limits T-cell 
activation. Tremelimumab antagonizes binding of CTLA4 to B7 lig ands and enhances human 
T-cell activation as demonstrated by [CONTACT_47505] (interl eukin-2, interferon-gamma) 
production in vitro in whole blood or peripheral blood mononucl ear cells cultures.  
Tremelimumab is thought to stimulate subjects’ immune systems t o attack their tumors by 
[CONTACT_47506] a negative regulatory signal, as mentioned above.    
The anti-tumor activity of antibodies to CTLA4 has been demonst rated in a variety of murine 
tumor models. Tremelimumab has also been shown to induce durabl e tumor responses in 
subjects with metastatic melanoma in Phase [ADDRESS_50189] exper ienced long term survival 
and/or durable tumor responses.1 This protocol will allow long-term follow-up of subjects for 
survival and tumor status.  
1.1.2 Clinical Data for Tremelimumab  
The results of previous clinical trials are summarized in the c urrent Investigators Brochure.   
1.2 Tremelimumab Risks and Precautions 
Risks with tremelimumab monotherapy include, but are not limite d to, gastrointenstinal 
effects (colitis, diarrhea, enterocolitis, intestinal perforati on, and large intestinal perforation); 
endocrine disorders (hypo- and hyperthyroidism, hypophysitis, a nd adrenal insufficiency); 
skin effects (rash and pruritus); lipase and/or amylase elevati ons and clinical manifestations 
of pancreatitis; hepatic events (including immune-mediated hepa titis and liver enzyme 
elevations); pneumonitis and IL D; neurotoxicity (including ence phalitis, peripheral motor 
and sensory neuropathies, and Guillain-Barré syndrome); thrombo cytopenia, anemia, and 
neutropenia; infusion-related re actions and hypersensitivity/an aphylactic reactions; renal 
events (including nephritis/autoimmune nephritis and acute kidn ey injury); autoimmune

hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus.  
For information on all identified and potential risks for treme limumab, please always refer to 
the current version of the tremelimumab IB. 
In monotherapy clinical studies, AEs reported at an incidence o f > 20% include events such 
as diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, pruritus, decreased appetite, ras h, and vomiting. Approximately 
16% of patients experienced an AE that  resulted in permanent discontinuation of 
tremelimumab, and approximately 45% of patients experienced an SAE. Please see the 
current version of the tremelimumab IB for a detailed summary o f tremelimumab 
monotherapy data, including AEs, SAEs, and CTC Grade [ADDRESS_50190] received it in other trials, until this agent becomes commercially available or 
development is discontinued.

Subjects not receiving tremelimumab should be seen in clinic or  contact[CONTACT_47507] [ADDRESS_50195] withdraw from treatment in their other tremelimum ab trial prior to enrollment 
in this study.  
5.2 Drug Supplies  
5.2.1 Formulation and Packaging   
Tremelimumab is supplied as a sterile solution, packaged in 20 mL clear glass vials with a 
rubber stopper and an aluminum seal.  Each vial contains 20 mg/ mL of tremelimumab (with 
a nominal fill of 400 mg per vial), in 20 mM Histidine buffer, pH 5.5, with 84 mg/mL 
Trehalose dehydrate, 0.2 mg/ml Polysorbate 80 and 0.1 mg/mL diS odiumEDTA dehydrate.   
The standard supply of tremelimumab is delivered to the investi gator site in a white carton 
with 4 vials of tremelimumab within foam inserts. The vial and carton labels identify 
tremelimumab as “tremelimumab (clonal), 20 mg/ml IV VialSolutio n 400 mg/vial”.  The 
Tremelimumab  
D4881C00024 Protocol Amendment 2  26 December 2019 
[COMPANY_008] — Company Confidential 
 
[ADDRESS_50196] will be prepared in accordance with 
Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and local regulatory guidelin es. The label will fulfill 
GMP Annex [ADDRESS_50197] ies.  
5.2.3 Administration  
Tremelimumab may be diluted with sterile normal saline (supplie d by [CONTACT_093]) prior 
to administration according to specific instructions in the Inv estigational Product Manual.  
Tremelimumab should be administered open label as an intravenou s solution followed by 
[CONTACT_4171].  Specific dosing and administration instructions a re provided in the most current 
version of the Investigational Product Manual.  
Although tremelimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody, imm unogenicity remains a 
possibility, so acute and subacute hypersensitivity reactions a re possible. The subjects’ blood 
pressure, heart rate, and temperature should be recorded prior to treatment and monitored as 
needed during drug infusion and for approximately 1-hour post-i nfusion.    
Medications to treat hypersensitivity reactions should be avail able, such as IV saline, 
acetaminophen, and emergency drugs, including subcutaneous epin ephrine, 
diphenhydramine, methylprednisolone, and nebulized albuterol.  See Section 5.4.[ADDRESS_50198] report  this to the [COMPANY_008] study 
physician .    
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose Delays and Re-Dosing Criteria for Tremelimumab  
The initiation of a cycle may be delayed to allow recovery from  treatment-related toxicity.  
There is a concern that subjects with active brain metastases m ay be at risk for increased 
intracranial pressure if treated with tremelimumab. Subjects wi th brain metastases must not 
receive tremelimumab until after the metastases have been adequ ately treated with surgery 
and/or radiation.  
Subjects must not receive tremelimumab while pregnant or breast -feeding. Females of 
childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine preg nancy test within [ADDRESS_50199] 2 years are not considered to be of  childbearing potential. 
For details on dosing delays and re-dosing criteria, please ref er to the Dosing Modification 
and Toxicity Management Guidelines, which is delivered as an An nex document.

with the recognition and management of toxicities associated wi th the use of the immune-
checkpoint inhibitors durvalumab [Medi4736] (PD-L1 inhibitor) a nd tremelimumab (CTLA4 
inhibitor).  Given the similar underlying mechanisms of toxicit ies observed with these two 
compounds, these guidelines are applicable to the management of  patients receiving either 
drug as monotherapy or in combination.  Additionally, these gui delines are applicable when 
either drug is used alone or in combination and is administered  concurrently or sequentially 
with other anti-cancer drugs (i.e. antineoplastic chemotherapy,  targeted agents), as part of a 
protocol specific treatment regimen.  The TMGs provide informat ion for the management of 
immune-mediated reactions, infusion-related reactions, and non- immune mediated reactions 
that may be observed with checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy or c ombination checkpoint 
inhibitor regimens, with specific instructions for dose modific ations (including 
discontinuations) and treatment i nterventions.  Investigators a re advised however to use local 
practice guidelines and consult local references for the manage ment of toxicities observed 
with other cancer treatment. The most current version of the TM Gs entitled “Dosing 
Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines for Immune-Medi ated, Infusion-Related, 
and Non-Immune Mediated Reactions (MEDI4736) Monotherapy or Com bination Therapy 
with Tremelimumab or Tremelimumab Monotherapy” is provided to t he investigative site as 
an Annex document and is maintained within the Site Master File .  
Patients should be thoroughly evaluated and appropriate efforts  should be made to rule out 
neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin, or other etiologic ca uses of the imAE. Serologic, 
immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) data, as appropriate, shou ld be used to support an 
imAE diagnosis. In the absence of a clear alternative etiology,  events should be considered 
potentially immune related. In addition, there are certain circ umstances in which 
tremelimumab should be permanently discontinued (see Section 5. 2.3.2 of this protocol and 
the Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines).  F ollowing the first dose of 
IP, subsequent administration of tremelimumab can be modified b ased on toxicities observed 
as described in the Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management  Guidelines. These 
guidelines have been prepared by [CONTACT_47512]/her clinical judgment in treating these types of toxicities . These guidelines apply to AEs 
considered causally related to tremelimumab monotherapy  regime n by [CONTACT_47513].  
Dose reductions are not permitted . In case of doubt, the Investigator should consult with 
the Study Physician. 
5.4.1 Management of Hypersensitivity Reactions to Tremelimumab  
In case of hypersensitivity reactions, the Investigator should institute treatment measures 
deemed medically appropriate and notify the [COMPANY_008] Clinici an of the event.  The

1. Withdrawal due to adverse event. When a discontinuation is due to a serious adverse 
event (SAE), the serious adverse event must be reported in acco rdance with the 
reporting requirements and the discontinuation must be reported  immediately to the 
[COMPANY_008] clinical monitor or his/her representative. 
2. Disease progression, unless there is reasonable evidence of cli nical benefit to justify 
continuation on protocol. 
3. Subjects may decide to withdraw from treatment at any time. Sub jects who withdraw 
from treatment should be followed for tumor assessment and surv ival. If the subject 
also withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, no  further evaluations 
should be performed and no additional data should be collected.  The sponsor may 
retain and continue to use any data collected before such withd rawal of consent. 
4. Subjects who begin new investigat ional therapy, chemotherapy, o r other therapy for 
his/her disease must not receive further treatment.

8.2.2 Reporting of Adverse Events on Case Report Forms  
Adverse events (serious and non-serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the time the 
subject has taken at least one dose of trial treatment.   
An adverse event does not need to be recorded in the CRF for th is protocol if it is being 
recorded in the CRF for the patient’s prior protocol.  
If a subject begins a new anticancer therapy, the adverse event  reporting period for non-
serious adverse events ends at the time the new treatment is st arted.  Death must be reported 
if it occurs during the serious adverse event reporting period after the last dose of 
investigational product, irrespective of any intervening treatm ent.

x Drug misuse;  
x Drug interactions;  
x Drug dependency; 
x Extravasation;  
x Exposure in utero.  
Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under trial s hould be reported as 
adverse events in the appropriate section of the CRF, providing  they meet the reporting 
criteria in Section 8.1.  Disease progression assessed by [CONTACT_47517].  
8.[ADDRESS_50219] finding should be 
reported as an adverse event:   
x Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or  
x Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/s urgical intervention, 
and/or  
x Test result leads to a change in trial dosing or discontinuatio n from the trial, 
significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other the rapy, and/or  
x Test result is considered to be an adverse event by [CONTACT_47518].  
Merely repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of any of the  above conditions, does not 
constitute an adverse event.  Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does 
not require reporting as an adverse event.

safety reporting period. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47494]. If the malignancy has a fatal  outcome during the trial or 
within the safety reporting period, then the event leading to d eath must be recorded as an AE 
and as an SAE with CTC Grade 5 (see Section 8.7, Severity Asses sment).  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in determin ing whether an event is an 
important medical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life-
threatening and/or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. However,  if it is determined that the 
event may jeopardize the subject and/or may require interventio n to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in the definition above, the important medical event should be reported as 
serious.  
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.1

(e.g., for work-up of persistent pre-treatment lab abnormality) ; 
x Social admission (e.g., subject has no place to sleep); 
x Administrative admission (e.g., for yearly physical exam);

elective cosmetic surgery);  
x Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures should be noted i n the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual  subject.  
x Admission exclusively for the administration of blood products.  
Diagnostic and therapeutic non-invasive and invasive procedures , such as surgery, should not 
be reported as AEs. However, the medical condition for which th e procedure was performed 
should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. For exa mple, an acute appendicitis that 
begins during the AE reporting period should be reported as the  AE, and the resulting 
appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE.

4  LIFE-THREATENING OR DISABLING Adverse Event  
5  DEATH RELATED TO Adverse Event  
Note the distinction between the severity and the seriousness o f an adverse event. A severe 
event is not necessarily a serious event. For example, a headac he may be severe (interferes 
significantly with subject’s usual function) but would not be c lassified as serious unless it 
met one of the criteria for SAEs, listed above.  
8.8 Causality Assessment  
The investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for  all adverse events (serious 
and non-serious).  An investigator’s causality assessment is th e determination of whether 
there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to 
an adverse event.  If the investigator’s final determination of  causality is unknown and the 
investigator does not know whether or not investigational produ ct caused the event, then the 
event will be handled as “related to investigational product” f or reporting purposes.  If the 
investigator’s causality assessment is “unknown but not related  to investigational product”, 
this should be clearly documented on trial records.    
In addition, if the investigator determines a serious adverse e vent is associated with trial 
procedures, the investigator must record this causal relationsh ip in the source documents and 
CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordanc e with the serious adverse 
event reporting requirements, if applicable.  
8.9 Exposure in Utero  
For investigational products within clinical trials and for mar keted products, an exposure 
inutero (EIU) occurs if:  
1) a female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while rece iving or having been 
directly exposed to (eg, environmental exposure) the investigat ional product, or the 
female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant after discontinuing  and/or being directly 
exposed to the investigational product (maternal exposure);  
2) a male has been exposed, either due to treatment or environment al, to the 
investigational product prior to or around the time of concepti on and/or is exposed 
during the partner pregnanc y (paternal exposure).  
If any trial subject or trial subject’s partner becomes or is f ound to be pregnant during the 
trial subject’s treatment with the investigational product, the  investigator must submit this 
information to [COMPANY_008] on an Exposure in Utero Form.  In ad dition, the investigator must 
submit information regarding environmental exposure to a AstraZ eneca product in a pregnant 
woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been ex posed to a cytotoxic product 
by [CONTACT_4691][INVESTIGATOR_4598]) using the Exposure in Utero Form.  T his must be done irrespective 
of whether an adverse event has occurred and within 24 hours of  awareness of the pregnancy.  
Tremelimumab  
D4881C00024 Protocol Amendment 2  26 December 2019 
[COMPANY_008] — Company Confidential 
 
27 of 54  The information submitted should include the anticipated date o f delivery (see below for 
information related to induced termination of pregnancy).  
Follow-up is conducted to obtain pregnancy outcome information on all Exposure in Utero 
reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy until 
completion or until pregnancy termination (ie, induced abortion ) and then notify [COMPANY_008] 
of the outcome.  The investigator will provide this information  as a follow up to the initial 
Exposure in Utero Form.  The reason(s) for an induced abortion should be specified.  An EIU 
report is not created when an ectopic pregnancy report is recei ved since this pregnancy is not 
usually viable.  Rather, a serious adverse event case is create d with the event of ectopic 
pregnancy.  
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediat e classification as a serious 
adverse event (ie, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal d eath, or congenital anomaly 
[including that in an aborted fetus, stillbirth or neonatal dea th]), the investigator should 
follow the procedures for reporting serious adverse events.  
In the case of a live birth, the “normality” of the newborn can  be assessed at the time of birth  
(ie, no minimum follow-up period of a presumably normal infant is required before an 
Exposure in Utero Form can be completed).  The “normality” of a n aborted fetus can be 
assessed by [CONTACT_4692], unless pre-abortion test f indings are suggestive of a 
congenital anomaly.  
Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are classi fied as serious adverse 
events follows:   
• “Spontaneous abortion” includes miscarriage and missed abortion .  
• All neonatal deaths that occur within [ADDRESS_50221] to causality, as serious adverse events.  In addition, a ny infant death after 1 
month that the investigator assesses as possibly related to the  in utero exposure to the 
investigational medication should be reported.  
8.10 Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See also End of Treatment, 
Section 6.3)  
Withdrawal due to adverse event should be distinguished from wi thdrawal due to insufficient 
response, according to the definition of adverse event noted ea rlier, and recorded on the 
appropriate adverse event CRF page if it meets the protocol-spe cified criteria for reportable 
adverse events.    
When a subject withdraws due to a serious adverse event, the se rious adverse event must be 
reported in accordance with the reporting requirements defined below.

The investigator is to report all adverse events which meet the  criteria for adverse event 
reporting in this trial (Section 8.[ADDRESS_50222] will 
be questioned about adverse events.  
8.12 Reporting Requirements  
Each adverse event is to be assessed to determine if it meets t he criteria for serious adverse 
event.  If a serious adverse event occurs, expedited reporting will follow local and 
international regulations, as appropriate.  
All adverse events which meet the criteria for adverse event re porting in this trial (Section 
8.1) will be reported on the adverse event page(s) of the CRF.  An adverse event does not 
need to be recorded in the CRF for this protocol if it is being  recorded in the CRF for the 
patient’s prior protocol.  It should be noted that the form for  collection of serious adverse 
event information is not the same as the adverse event CRF.  Wh ere the same data are 
collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner.  For example, the same 
adverse event term should be used on both forms.  Adverse event s should be reported using 
concise medical terminology on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of serious 
adverse event information.  
8.12.[ADDRESS_50223] be made immediate ly, irrespective of the extent 
of available adverse event information.  This timeframe also ap plies to additional new 
information (follow-up) on previously forwarded serious adverse  event reports as well as to 
the initial and follow-up reporting of Exposure in Utero cases.     
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware o f the occurrence of a serious 
adverse event immediately (eg, if an outpatient trial subject i nitially seeks treatment 
elsewhere), the investigator is to report the event within 24 h ours after learning of it and 
document the time of his/her first awareness of the adverse eve nt.  
For all serious adverse events, the investigator is obligated t o pursue and provide information 
to [COMPANY_008] in accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above.  In addition, 
an investigator may be requested by [CONTACT_47520]-up 
information in an expedited fashion.  This information may be m ore detailed than that 
captured on the adverse event case report form.  In general, th is will include a description of 
the adverse event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case 
and independent determination of possible causality.  Informati on on other possible causes of 
the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses must b e provided.  In the case of a 
subject death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible 
to [COMPANY_008] or its designated representative.

11.1 Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record  
As used in this protocol, the term Case Report Form (CRF) shoul d be understood to refer to 
either a paper form or an electronic data record or both, depen ding on the data collection 
method used in this trial.  
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included sub ject.  The completed 
original CRFs are the sole property of [COMPANY_008] and should n ot be made available in any 
form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of  [COMPANY_008] or appropriate 
regulatory authorities, without written permission from AstraZe neca.  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure completion an d to review and approve all 
CRFs.  CRFs must be signed by [CONTACT_47521].  These 
signatures serve to attest that the information contained on th e CRFs is true.  At all times, the 
investigator has final personal responsibility for the accuracy  and authenticity of all clinical 
and laboratory data entered on the CRFs.  Subject source docume nts are the physician’s 
subject records maintained at the trial site.  In most cases, t he source documents will be the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s or the physician’s chart.  In cases where the source  documents are the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47499]’s chart, the information collected on the CRFs mu st match those charts.   
In some cases, the CRF may also serve as the source document.  In these cases, [COMPANY_008] 
and the investigator must prospectively document which items wi ll be recorded in the source 
documents and for which items the CRF will stand as the source document.  
11.[ADDRESS_50228] Retention  
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities  or [COMPANY_008], the 
investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects 
(sufficient information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed 
informed consent forms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_4600], serious adverse eve nt forms, source documents, 
and detailed records of treatment disposition.  The records sho uld be retained by [CONTACT_47522], local regulations, or as specifi ed in the Clinical Study 
Agreement, whichever is longer.  
If the investigator relocates, retires, or for any reason withd raws from the trial, [COMPANY_008] 
should be prospectively notified.  The trial records must be tr ansferred to an acceptable 
designee, such as another investigator, another institution, or  to [COMPANY_008].  The 
investigator must obtain [COMPANY_008]’s written permission befor e disposing of any records, 
even if retention requirements have been met.

Comprehensive toxicity management guidelines (TMG) have been de veloped to assist 
investigators with the recognition and management of toxicities  associated with the use of the 
immune-checkpoint inhibitors durvalumab [Medi4736] (PD-L1 inhib itor) and tremelimumab 
(CTLA4 inhibitor).  Given the similar underlying mechanisms of toxicities observed with 
these two compounds, these guidelines are applicable to the man agement of patients 
receiving either drug as monotherapy or in combination.  Additi onally, these guidelines are 
applicable when either drug is used alone or in combination and  is administered concurrently 
or sequentially with other anti-cancer drugs (i.e. antineoplast ic chemotherapy, targeted 
agents), as part of a protocol specific treatment regimen.  The  TMGs provide information for 
the management of immune-mediated reactions, infusion-related r eactions, and non-immune 
mediated reactions that may be observed with checkpoint inhibit or monotherapy or 
combination checkpoint inhibitor regimens, with specific instru ctions for dose modifications

to use local practice guidelines and consult local references f or the management of toxicities 
observed with other cancer treatment. The most current version of the TMGs entitled 
“Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines for Imm une-Mediated, Infusion-
Related, and Non-Immune Mediated Reactions (MEDI4736) Monothera py or Combination 
Therapy with Tremelimumab or Tremelimumab Monotherapy” is provi ded to the 
investigative site as an Annex document and is maintained withi n the Site Master File.  
Patients should be thoroughly evaluated and appropriate efforts  should be made to rule out 
neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin, or other etiologic ca uses of the imAE. Serologic, 
immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) data, as appropriate, shou ld be used to support an 
imAE diagnosis. In the absence of a clear alternative etiology,  events should be considered 
potentially immune related.  In addition, there are certain cir cumstances in which 
tremelimumab should be permanently discontinued (see Section 5. 2.3.2. of this protocol and 
the Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines).  F ollowing the first dose of 
IP, subsequent administration of tremelimumab can be modified b ased on toxicities observed 
as described in the Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management  Guidelines. These 
guidelines have been prepared by [CONTACT_47512]/her clinical judgment in treating these types of toxicities . These guidelines apply to AEs 
considered causally related to tremelimumab monotherapy  regime n by [CONTACT_47513].  
Dose reductions are not permitted. In case of doubt, the Invest igator should consult with the 
Study Physician.

54 of 54  Appendix 4  Medication Error 
For the purposes of this clinical study a medication error is a n unintended failure or mistake 
in the treatment process for an [COMPANY_008] study drug that eit her causes harm to the 
participant or has the potential to cause harm to the participa nt. 
A medication error is not lack of efficacy of the drug, but rat her a human or process related 
failure while the drug is in control of the study site staff or  participant. 
Medication error includes situations where an error. 
x occurred 
x was identified and intercepted before the participant received the drug 
x did not occur, but circumstances were recognized that could hav e led to an error 
 Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medica tion errors: 
x Drug name [CONTACT_2976] 
x Dispensing error e.g.  medication prepared incorrectly, even if  it was not actually given 
to the participant 
x Drug not administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or  wrong site of 
administration 
x Drug not taken as indicated e.g.  tablet dissolved in water whe n it should be taken as a 
solid tablet  
x Drug not stored as instructed e.g.  kept in the fridge when it should be at room 
temperature  
x Wrong participant received the medication (excluding IVRS/IWRS errors) 
x Wrong drug administered to participant (excluding IVRS/IWRS err ors) 
 
Examples of events that do not  require reporting as medication errors in clinical studies: 
x Errors related to or resulting from IVRS/IWRS - including those  which lead to one of the 
above listed events that would otherwise have been a medication  error  
x Participant accidentally missed drug dose(s) e.g.  forgot to ta ke medication 
x Accidental overdose (will be captured as an overdose) 
x Participant failed to return unused medication or empty packagi ng 
x Errors related to background and rescue medication, or standard  of care medication in 
open label studies, even if an AZ product  
Medication errors are not regarded as AEs but AEs may occur as a consequence of the 
medication error.

Page 2 of 15 Pro-Moms, Version 1.13 April 4, 2020 1. Background and specific aims: In the [LOCATION_002] (U.S.), Black women are three times more likely to experience iron deficiency (ID) in pregnancy compared to women from other racial/ethnic groups, for reasons that remain largely unknown1. Women who are iron deficient during pregnancy experience higher rates of maternal and infant mortality2, preterm birth3, low infant birth weight4, and irreversible neurocognitive defects in their children2,3. Indeed, the highest rates of adverse maternal-infant health outcomes occur in Black women, a phenomenon that may be driven by [CONTACT_722459]-optimal iron status1,3. Specific to Chicago, in some low income predominately Black neighborhoods (e.g. Englewood, Austin), preterm birth rates range between 18.5% and 34.8% far exceeding the national average of 9.6% and the state of Illinois at 10.3%.  Exposure to structural violence may compromise maternal iron status that contributes to adverse maternal-infant health outcomes in Black women in at-risk communities. Black women nationally and in Chicago are more likely to live in urban areas that are fraught with structural violence. Structural violence refers to the multiple ways in which social, economic, and political systems disproportionately expose particular populations to risks and vulnerabilities including poverty, crime, violence, and limited access to healthcare and healthy foods that contribute to excess morbidity and mortality.5,[ADDRESS_986729] maternal-infant health disparities in Black women including maternal ID7. Specifically, chronic exposure to structural violence can dysregulate the stress response (i.e., hypothalamic pi[INVESTIGATOR_80560] (HPA) axis)8 eliciting altered production of glucorticoids (i.e., cortisol) and a propagated pro-inflammatory immune cascade5. Such stress-induced changes can adversely affect the health of pregnant women and their offspring. In fact, exposure to chronic stress is associated with ID6 and decreased dietary iron absorption9. In pregnant women, exposure to chronic stress is also associated with lower infant iron status at birth which is concerning given iron is essential to postnatal neurodevelopment10. Stress-induced inflammation alters iron metabolism by [CONTACT_722460]-regulatory hormone hepcidin11-13. Elevated hepcidin reduces dietary iron absorption and access to body iron stores that leads to ID14. In our preliminary study, pregnant Black women exposed to structural violence (i.e., discrimination) had elevated hepcidin compared to those not exposed (Koenig, unpublished). Importantly, providing supplemental dietary iron to a stressed and iron deficient woman in pregnancy will not correct the underlying ID due to the negative effects of elevated hepcidin on dietary iron absorption15,16. Thus, interventions that can safely and effectively mitigate the physiologic effect of stress (i.e., inflammation) have the potential to improve maternal and infant iron status that reduces suboptimal pregnancy and birth outcomes.  There is growing evidence that probiotic bacteria can reduce stress and its adverse physiologic effects. For instance, daily probiotic consumption is associated with reduced cortisol output and decreased self-reported stress in healthy volunteers17. The gut, gut bacteria, and mental health are intimately linked through the gut-microbiota-brain axis18, a system that mediates the molecular interactions between intestinal bacterial communities and host neurological, immunological and endocrinological processes19,20. Therefore, the effect of probiotics on stress is likely mediated through modulation and recolonization of the gut microbiota with commensal microbes, such as lactobacilli, that promote positive effects on the HPA axis (i.e., cortisol output) and the pro-inflammatory immune response21. Presumably, such effects would also normalize iron metabolism. Notably, supplementation with Lactobacillus Plantarum 299v (Lp299v) has been linked to reduced cortisol in stressed patients22, decreased systemic inflammation23,24, and enhanced dietary iron absorption25. Probiotics are safe for use in pregnancy26, 27, 28, thus, Lp299v may be a safe and inexpensive daily probiotic therapy to improve iron status of women burdened by [CONTACT_722461]. Additionally, we recognize that health-related resources for pregnant women are limited in many of the marginalized neighborhoods of Chicago. Thus, along with pi[INVESTIGATOR_48124] a potentially innovative therapy aimed at reducing the physiologic effects of chronic stress from structural violence, we strive to build a sustainable university-community partnership to disseminate research findings and promote lifestyle and dietary approaches to mitigate the effects of chronic stress from structural violence for at-risk pregnant Black women in Chicago. Our specific aims are as follows:    Specific Aim 1: To determine the impact of consuming daily Lp299v + standard PNVI vs. standard PNVI + placebo beginning between 15-20 weeks gestation through delivery on maternal iron status and metabolism. To fully characterize maternal iron metabolism and regulators or maternal iron metabolism we will measure several blood-based markers including hemoglobin, hematocrit, ferritin, transferrin receptor, transferrin saturation, serum iron, erythropoietin, systemic inflammation and hepcidin at baseline, 24-28 and 34 - 36 weeks gestation, and at 
Page 3 of 15 Pro-Moms, Version 1.13 April 4, 2020 delivery. Hypothesis: Women consuming Lp229v will have superior iron status at –24-28 and 34 - 36 weeks gestation and at delivery compared to control women.   Specific Aim 2: To determine colonization and propagation of the gut microbial community with Lp299v from rectal swabs collected at baseline,24-28 weeks and 34 - 36 weeks gestation in women consuming Lp299v + standard PNVI vs. standard PNVI + placebo.  Hypothesis: Women consuming LP299v will have greater colonization and propagation of Lp299v in their rectal swabs at –24-28 week and 34 - 36 weeks gestation compared to women consuming PNVI + placebo.   Specific Aim 3: To explore the effect of daily oral Lp299v vs. placebo on infant iron status at delivery. Infant iron status will be measured (via cord blood at delivery) (i.e., hemoglobin, ferritin, transferrin, serum iron, and transferrin receptor). Hypothesis: Infant of women consuming LP299v will have higher iron status at delivery.  Specific Aim 4: To determine the feasibility and tolerability of daily oral Lp299v supplementation (15-20 weeks gestation-delivery. Hypothesis: Feasibility and tolerability will be high in both treatment groups of the study for the duration of the trial.  Exploratory Aim 1: There is some evidence that probiotic use can positively influence maternal health outcomes including mood. We will explore differences in the development of gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, and gestational diabetes using data extracted from the electronic health record (EHR). We will also examine changes to maternal stress response (i.e., serum 17-hydroxycorticosterone and hair cortisol via immunoassay) and self-reported stress, depression, anxiety, resilience, experiences of discrimination, childhood trauma, social support, post-traumatic stress, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_722433]299v + standard PNVI vs. standard PNVI + placebo.      Exploratory Aim 2: To build a sustainable university-community partnership to disseminate research and promote lifestyle and dietary approaches to mitigate the physiologic effects of chronic stress from structural violence for at-risk pregnant Black women in Chicago. We will conduct the Maternal Stress Reduction Project, “Happy Moms”, which entails focus groups and a demographic questionnaire to inform future programming and curriculum.   2. Methods.  I. Research participants. We will recruit and enroll 40 women early in pregnancy (< 20 weeks gestation) from the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) Obstetrics (OB) clinics located at the University of Illinois Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_722434] (UIHHSS) Outpatient Care Center, Center for Women’s Health. Women will be between the ages of 18 – 45 years old and at risk for maternal ID based on hemoglobin of 10.0 – 11.9 g/dl assessed as part of standard clinical care during the first prenatal OB visit.    II. Eligibility, recruitment, and informed consent: After obtaining a waiver of consent for recruitment purposes, we will complete a pre-screen eligibility checklist of women < 20 weeks gestation who are seeking prenatal care at the UIC Obstetrics Clinics at the UIHHSS Center for Women’s Health. Potentially eligible women will be identified through clinic schedules and eligibility assessed via Cerner/EHR (only if data is available, data will not be available for new UIC patients). Women identified as potentially eligible through the EHR data or new UIC patients attending their first OB prenatal appointment will be approached in clinic. A research team member will introduce the study, assess interest, and further determine eligibility using a screening checklist. Interested and eligible women will be asked to provide contact [CONTACT_3031]. As part of routine care, maternal hemoglobin will be assessed following the first OB visit. For women that express interest in the study and provide contact [CONTACT_3031], hemoglobin results will be followed up in Cerner. Women will be called regardless of their results to report on continued study eligibility. If hemoglobin is within the study defined range (10.0 – 11.9 g/dl) women will be invited to participate. Those who continue to express interest will be asked to schedule a baseline appointment at the UIC Clinical Research Center (CRC)s. Women will be consented at the baseline visit. Research personnel will explain to every eligible woman that their choice to participate will in no way affect their standard of care at UIHHS.

Page 9 of 15 Pro-Moms, Version 1.13 April 4, 2020 Maternal health data: We will abstract from the EHR data pertaining to recent illness or infection, new medications, and change in health status (i.e., development of a pregnancy related condition like gestational diabetes).   Pi[INVESTIGATOR_722441] (24-28 weeks and 34-36 weeks gestation): We will monitor adherence using electronic pi[INVESTIGATOR_722442]. Women will get a new 30-40-day allotment of pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]. During these visits, we will download data from the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_722443] a physical pi[INVESTIGATOR_692]. If a woman is found to be non-compliant (i.e., consuming <75% of pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]) with her permission, she will receive automated daily text messages around dinner time to help increase compliance with the supplement interventions.   Pi[INVESTIGATOR_722444] (approximately @ 18-19 weeks, 22-23 weeks, 30-31 weeks, 38-39 weeks). We will monitor adherence using electronic pi[INVESTIGATOR_722442]. Women will visit UIC approximately every [ADDRESS_986743] a physical pi[INVESTIGATOR_692]. If a woman is found to be non-compliant (i.e., consuming < 75% of pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]) with her permission, she will receive automated daily text messages around dinner time to help increase compliance with the supplement interventions. We will administer the GI symptoms checklist at each visit. c. Feasibility and Tolerability. Feasibility will be based on accrual and withdrawal/loss to follow-up rates at the end of the study and adherence determined using the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_722445]. The intervention will be considered feasible if 50% of women approached for participation enroll, overall withdrawal rate is ≤ 15% and adherence to the supplement regimen is ≥85%. Tolerability [(potential adverse events (AEs) (e.g., GI symptoms)] will be assessed via phone/email/text using the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_722446] 4 weeks and bi-weekly thereafter. The intervention will be deemed tolerable if no serious AEs (highly unlikely) are documented, and the rate of non-serious AEs is similar between study arms.  e. Labor and delivery.

During the 34–36 gestational week research visit and/or at the final pi[INVESTIGATOR_125814], women will be provided a laminated card with the study number and staff personal contact [CONTACT_3031]. Women will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_722470]. In addition, we will follow the progress of these women closely via phone call, text message, email and through the patient EHR until they are admitted to UIC labor and delivery. UIC labor and delivery staff will also be in-serviced regarding the study procedures.    1) Maternal venous blood draw: Following admission, as part of routine care, women will undergo a venous blood collection by [CONTACT_722471]. As part of this routine care, we will request an additional two tubes of blood (30 ml) for research purposes. If there is extra blood available from the venous blood sample and the patient consents, it may be used for future research to learn more about how to prevent, detect, or treat other health problems in pregnancy.  2) Umbilical venous cord blood collection (placental cord blood): Immediately following delivery, the research team will collect a maximum of three tubes of umbilical venous cord blood (~30 mL). If a research participant chooses to bank their umbilical cord blood, and therefore the research team cannot obtain [ADDRESS_986744], or treat other health problems in pregnancy.  3) Placenta (20 grams): After the cord blood has been obtained, the placenta will be placed in a basin with lid and transferred to the Tussing-Humphreys lab space in COMRB. Following placental 
Page 10 of 15 Pro-Moms, Version 1.13 April 4, 2020 characteristics will be examined (i.e., weight, length) and processed for analysis and stored at -80C until later analysis.   4) Maternal and infant labor and delivery data: Following participant discharge, a research team member will abstract pertinent maternal and infant L&D data (i.e., route of delivery, infant weight, and infant length) from the EHR.

Subjects will be sent labeled blood tubes to have their blood drawn at their 24-[ADDRESS_986749] Diagnostics.   4) Anthropometrics. Gestational weight at a date the coincides with our defined study visits (24-28 weeks, & 34-36 weeks) will be obtained from the EHR vs. physically measured. 5) Labor and delivery samples. Nurse mid-wives (Kylea Liese and Katherine Erbe) working clinically at the time of admittance for delivery, will assist with obtaining maternal blood and venous cord blood. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_722451].  IX. Rectal swabs processing and analyses. All maternal rectal swabs will be processed at [CONTACT_722487]-Humphreys 3060/[ADDRESS_986750] procedures. The microbial community will be assessed via 16s rRNA analysis, whole genome shotgun sequencing, and qPCR.    X. Placenta analysis. Placenta will be used to assess gene expression of iron regulatory, inflammatory proteins, and tissue iron content. Placenta will be weighed, measured, and systematically biopsied and frozen at -80C for gene and protein analysis.   i. Nucleic acid extraction:  total RNA will be extracted from homogenized placental samples by [CONTACT_722475]. ii. Gene (mRNA) expression:  8 representative biopsy samples will be taken, with the fetal and maternal membranes removed for later mRNA expression analyses (qPCR). The samples will be placed in RNAlater and stored at -80C until analyses.    XI. Hair analysis. Exposure to chronic stress will be assessed by [CONTACT_722476] a small hair sample   (70-100 strands) using a commercial ELISA kit (Alpco Diagnostics, Salem, NH)29. Hair cortisol has  been validated against 24-hour urine cortisol as a relevant biomarker of long-term cortisol exposure.  XII. Data management. Research staff will enter all data directly into a Research Electronic Data Capture (RedCap) (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN) data structure. Standard checks for outliers, duplicates, and other errors associated with data entry will be conducted. Dietary data will be collected using the online Diet History Questionnaire-II (NCI, Bethesda, MD).  XIII. Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis will be performed using SAS (v. 9.4., Cary, NC). Variables not normally distributed will be transformed and if normality not achieved, non-parametric tests will be utilized. Data that are left censored due to undetectable levels will be analyzed using imputation or tobit regression to avoid biased estimates. Descriptive statistics including means, medians and standard deviations for continuous variables and frequency for categorical variables will be used to describe the women, serum, and rectal swabs outcomes at baseline. Differences between treatment groups (Lp299v + standard PNVI vs. standard PNVI + placebo) for the baseline variables will be continuous variables will be compared by t-test or non-parametric equivalent with Bonferroni correction and categorical data via chi-square or Fisher exact text. The correlation between the continuous variables at each time-point, baseline, 20 – 24, 34 – [ADDRESS_986751] analysis of variance, using a general linear model for repeated measures between treatment groups and time-points will be examined. If significant effects are observed over time, single different pregnancy time-points (i.e., 24 - 28, 34 - 36 gestational week) will be tested. All P values were based on a two-sided test of statistical significance accepted at the level of P<0.05.   
Page [ADDRESS_986752]. Baseline  microbial  abundance,  diversity,  and  predicted  microbial  metabolisms  will  be  assessed.  For feasibility, # of  charts  screened,  prescreening  eligible,  approached,  and  enrolled  will  be  calculated.  The  #  of  visits  completed  at  each  time  point  and  end  of  study  attrition  will  be  determined  and  differences  between  groups  calculated.  Adherence  (#  of  pi[INVESTIGATOR_722452])  and  #  of  SAEs/AEs  will  be  calculated  and  compared  between  groups.  Maternal stress  response,  maternal  iron-related  parameters,  and  inflammation  at  baseline, 24-[ADDRESS_986753]  for  baseline  differences.  Infant iron status at delivery  will  be  compared  between  groups  (Student’s  t-test).  Microbial abundance, diversity and microbial metabolisms will  be  compared  between  groups  at  baseline, 24-28 weeks, 34-36 weeks (Student’s  t-test/Mann  Whitney  U)  and  within  group  changes  at  24-28 weeks and  34-36 weeks  will  be  determined.  The mediating effects of  maternal  rectal swabs microbiome,  systemic  inflammation  and  iron  regulatory  responses  on  the  relationship  between  Lp299v  on  maternal  stress-  and  iron-related  outcomes  will  be  explored  using  generalized  linear  models. Multiple comparisons and false discovery rate adjustments will be used accordingly.   XIV. Data and safety monitoring plan. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_722453] a data safety monitoring plan and follow all procedures for the protection of human subjects as required by [CONTACT_722477]. The purpose of this data and safety monitoring plan is: (1) to ensure the safety of study subjects and the validity of data; and (2) to produce high quality research while considering both risks and benefits. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_722454].  Assessment of study risk. The probiotic proposed for use in the study is not contraindicated during pregnancy and therefore has not been shown to pose any adverse risk to the pregnant woman or her fetus. All other study procedures, based on UIC guidelines should be determined as minimal risk.   Data monitoring plan. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_722455]: data quality, completeness, and timeliness; adequacy of compliance with goals for recruitment and retention, including those related to participation of minorities; adherence to the protocol; and adverse events reported by [CONTACT_722478]. If an adverse event is reported during the study, subjects will be requested to report the event to their physician and the PI. All adverse events will be documented and reported to the UIC IRB in a timely manner based on the type of adverse event (adverse event vs. serious adverse event).  We will also record and track reasons for dropout. All authorized study personnel will be required to notify the PI [INVESTIGATOR_722456]/adverse events immediately upon discovery. The PIs will immediately notify the UIC IRB. The study will be subject to annual review and recertification by [CONTACT_722479].   Experimental Aim 2: The Maternal Stress Reduction Project, “Happy Moms” Focus Groups Information collected from the focus groups will help inform the development of a curriculum focusing on lifestyle and dietary approaches to reduce chronic stress from structural violence. The curriculum will be developed into a series of classes that will be offered at the New Moms Austin Chicago location. The classes will be open to focus group participants and women currently participating in Family Support programs offered by [CONTACT_722480].   The Maternal Stress Reduction Project, “Happy Moms”: Recruitment, Eligibility, Informed Consent and Data Collection   Recruitment: will be conducted via informational handout by [CONTACT_722481]. New Moms offers both in-home and onsite programing for their clients. During these programs, members of the New Moms staff or a member of the research team will inform their clients about the opportunity to participate in a focus group centered around healthy diet and lifestyle choices. Interested individuals will be provided with a copy of the "Informational Handout" and instructed to contact [CONTACT_722482]. We will recruit up to [ADDRESS_986754] the study number will receive a call from a member of the research staff in a semi-private space in the Westside Research Office Building to determine eligibility and explain focus group activities. Only members of the research staff and focus group participants for that session will be aware of a participant’s status as a research participant.   Eligibility: A member of the study staff will return the call of a potential participant that leaves a message on the study number voicemail. When returning the call, the study staff member will follow the "Phone Script" to explain that the project is a research study and to describe the study purpose and activities to the potential participant.  During the call, eligibility will be determined by [CONTACT_722483]. If yes, they will be invited to participate in a focus group session and offered one of two focus group dates. The potential participant will choose the date that best fits their schedule. Once a date is selected, the potential participant will be provided with a location and time.  No additional information will be collected from the participant at this time. All focus groups will be conducted at New Moms Austin location in Chicago.    Informed Consent: will be conducted at the beginning of the focus group session. A member of the study staff will review each section of the consent form with the focus group members as a group. The focus group attendees will be given the opportunity to ask questions and be reminded that their participation in the study is completely voluntary and that they can discontinue participation at any time. Individuals that choose to participate in the focus group will be asked to sign and date two copi[INVESTIGATOR_79642] (one to keep and one to be given to study staff). Study staff will also sign and date both copi[INVESTIGATOR_722457]. Those that choose not to participate will be thanked for their time and asked to leave the focus group session before it begins.     Data Collection:  Once all participants are consented, the brief demographic questionnaire will be distributed. When all questionnaires are completed, a member of the study staff will collect the questionnaire and begin the focus group session. Participants will be asked about their barriers and challenges to a healthy diet and lifestyle. The focus group sessions will be audio recorded to allow research staff to capture the discussion in full. During the focus group session participants will use first names only. All name [CONTACT_722485]. For the Maternal Stress Reduction Project, “Happy Moms”, a 1-2-hour focus group session. We are audio recording the focus group sessions for immediate download onto a laptop with TruCrypt software. The focus group session audio recordings will not be stored on the audio recording device. The audio recordings will be transferred to the laptop with TruCrypt immediately following the focus group session and deleted from the audio recording device. All focus group participants will be asked not to discuss the focus group session or its participants with anyone not in the focus group session. During the focus group, participants will be issued name [CONTACT_722486].  Data Analysis: All qualitative data will be analyzed using qualitative analysis software (ATLAS.ti). We will identify emergent themes about experiences using the team consensus codes. Codes will be developed and discussed in team meetings to enhance consistency in application. Final codes will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_722458]. The data will be double-coded; after coding separately, the 2 coders will consult with the team to review discrepancies, refine code definitions and recode until intercoder reliability exceeds 85%. The most common themes will be used to inform the intervention. For example, if a top common theme is fast-food consumption as a means to reduce stress, this would be targeted in the future intervention/curriculum.   3. References.

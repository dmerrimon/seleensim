1.Objectives
1.1. Purpose, specific aims, or objectives:
The aims of this project are to: 
Aim 1:  Engage families  and health care providers  in: adapting the CDC's Acute  Concussion  Evaluation 
Care Guidelines  to be readable/useable by [CONTACT_909055][INVESTIGATOR_909039] (ED).  
Aim 2: Assess how treatment-as-usual is being experienced  by [CONTACT_909056]-
closed head injury  in the ED.  
Aim 3: Assess the impact of  strengthened post-closed head injury communication (as developed in Aim 
1)  on family adherence to evidence-based concussion management guidelines. 
Aim 4: Ensure the study measures used in this study are valid and reliable-  including ensuring that 
participants are not confused  by [CONTACT_909057], behavior, knowledge, and self-efficacy variables in predictable ways (e.g., to assess  
measure validity).
  
1.2. Hypotheses to be tested:
  
Aim 1: This research is qualitative and exploratory; our goal is to understand the perspectives of 
different stakeholders in order  to adapt materials  and develop an implementation  strategy  that 
better supports family adherence with evidence-based guidelines about  post-concussion  
management following discharge from the ED.
Aims 2 and 3: We expect  that families  who receive the adapted education  toolkit  (Aim 3) will 
report greater understanding of evidence-based guidance and will be more  prepared  to adhere to 
evidence-based guidance post-closed head injury as compared  to parents in the control  
condition. 
Aim 4: This research is qualitative and exploratory; our goal is to develop and validate measures 
of concussion-related behaviors, knowledge, and self-efficacy. We aim to get feedback from 
adults to ensure that the survey questions for Aims 2 and 3 are easily understood and that the 
measures are valid and reliable.
  
2.Background
2.1. Relevant prior experience and gaps in current knowledge:
  
Appropriate concussion  management reduces  concussion-related morbidity Every year,  
more than one million  U.S. youth are diagnosed with a concussion from sport or recreational 
activities.1 The Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention’s (CDC) recent Report  to Congress 
on the Management of Traumatic Brain Injury  in Children2 emphasizes that appropriate post-
concussion management  in the home, school and sport settings is critical  for minimizing  
morbidity. During the symptomatic  period post-injury,  which can range from several  hours  to 
months,[ADDRESS_1276151] or collision (e.g.,  sport) and, after a brief period of rest, 
moderating cognitive  demands  in the school and home setting in response to symptoms,  under 
the guidance of a medical professional.[ADDRESS_1276152]-concussion management in the home, school and 
sport settings.  This includes being observant for symptoms  at home, interfacing with medical 
providers and academic personnel and ensuring the child does not return  to sport prematurely

planning to support their child’s recovery.[ADDRESS_1276154]-concussion visit in 
the emergency department (ED) is the sole point of clinical contact  [CONTACT_447]-injury and a 
critical time for evidence-based knowledge  translation. Youth on Medicaid  who seek 
medical attention post-concussion are most likely to do so in an ED.[ADDRESS_1276155]-concussion are 
currently inadequate  without adaptation to meet the needs of parents with low health 
literacy. The CDC  has developed the Acute Concussion Evaluation (ACE) Care Plan,3 a two-
page handout  for healthcare  providers to share with families following their child’s injury  with 
information about returning  to daily activities, return to school and return  to sport.  Sharing these  
materials has been recommended as part of an evidence-based clinical pathway for acute  
pediatric post-concussion  evaluation and management40 and their utilization has been 
associated with improved youth outcomes.[ADDRESS_1276156], using visuals where possible, limiting the number 
of messages and clearly  stating the actions the reader  should take.34 Additionally, the readability 
of the CDC ACE Care  Plan handout3 is at a 10th grade level (Flesch  Reading Ease=49.0,  
Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level=10.0),  which  is higher than recommended guidelines.[ADDRESS_1276157] not been  translated into Spanish or any other language. Thus, there is a 
need to adapt the CDC ACE Care Plan to meet the learning  needs of parents  with low 
health literacy and limited  English proficiency  (LEP).   Well-designed  written materials  
alone are not sufficient  for effective  knowledge translation that supports behavior 
change. Among parents, recall of written discharge  instructions from EDs post-concussion  is 
greater when  they are accompanied by a verbal discussion from nurses in the ED.[ADDRESS_1276158] practices for concussion management  in this setting.46 Existing  approaches for 
discharge communication  can be adapted  to support  implementation of evidence-based

parent education about concussion management. The Agency for Healthcare  Research and 
Quality (AHRQ) has developed a Re-Engineered Discharge (RED) Toolkit19(p2) to help optimize 
the discharge  process in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_909040] a foundation  for acceptable  and 
equitable implementation of the CDC  ACE Care Plan. Core components of RED  guidance 
related to family-provider communication  include:  (1) ensuring that written materials are easily  
understood and available in the family’s  preferred language, (2) ensuring there is satisfactory 
explanation of these  materials, including  an opportunity  to ask questions, and (3) providing 
support in planning  next steps  for engaging in recommended behaviors19(p2). Ongoing  quality 
improvement efforts at Seattle Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_909041], such as having nurses work with families to 
gauge understanding and plan next steps.47 To realize improved discharge communication,  
ED providers  (physicians and nurses) require: (1) access to evidence-based information 
about concussion  management to share with parents post-injury and (2) support 
implementing such materials in their clinical  setting.

5.Procedures Involved
5.1. Study  design:8
  
Aim 1: Qualitative methodology, including  interviews.
Aims 2 and 3: Consecutive cohort design with randomization.
Aim 4: (1) Cognitive interviewing (one-on-one interviews  where participants talk through survey 
questions and identify challenging/confusing parts), and (2) cross sectional  study, with data 
collected through anonymous online surveys.
  
5.2. Research procedures:9
  
Aim 1: This aim involves qualitative interviews, following a semi-structured  questioning 
methodology, informed by [CONTACT_909058]. Interviews will be digitally  recorded and transcribed verbatim,  then 
coded for relevant  themes  using  a thematic analysis approach. We will announce  that the 
interview will be recorded  at the beginning of each interview, and that announcement will be 
recorded. We will conduct a one-on-one interview  with each parent and healthcare  participant 
that will last approximately  45 minutes. Parent interviews will be conducted remotely (e.g., by 
[CONTACT_909059]) or in person  at SCH  or the parent’s house  or a nearby 
[CONTACT_909060] (e.g.,  private room in public  library). Healthcare provider interviews will be 
conducted remotely  (e.g., by [CONTACT_909061])  or in person in a private room  at 
SCH. Interviews with parents will be conducted in their native language  (English or Spanish). 
Spanish language interviews will be conducted by a research team member who is fluent  in 
Spanish and is a Certified Bilingual  staff member,  with consent also obtained  by [CONTACT_437018].  As 
part of parent  data collection  for Aim 1, all parents will complete the 3-item Brief Health Literacy  
Screen as part of a demographic questionnaire  given  prior to the start of the interview. For remote  
qualitative interviews, the same procedures  will be followed, however, participants will be emailed 
the demographic questionnaire  and information sheet and they will participate via an online 
platform (i.e. Zoom). Please see timeline  (uploaded  in “Other Attachments”) for more information 
regarding the timing  of Aim 1.
Aims 2 and 3: We will assign participants to the intervention and control  groups  using a consecutive  
cohort design with randomization. In the first data collection  cohort (Aim 2), all participants will be 
assigned to the education-as-usual control condition. In the second cohort (Aim 3), participants will be

randomized to either the education toolkit intervention  condition or treatment-as-usual control  condition in 
a 2:1 ratio. For participants in the control group  (Aim 2 and those  randomized to control  group in Aim 3), 
there will be no change to the nature  of provider  communication with families about closed head 
injury/concussion. Data will be collected about  the experience that family’s  have seeking care in the ED 
for their child’s closed head injury. For both Aims 2 and 3, survey data will be collected from parents at 
three time points: at initial ED visit before discharge, one day post-visit,  and at 2-week follow-up. As part 
of parent data collection  for Aims  [ADDRESS_1276161] time point of survey data collection. Please see timeline (uploaded  in “Other 
Attachments” for more information regarding the timing of Aims [ADDRESS_1276162] of brief education from a member of the ED study team at enrollment,  followed by [CONTACT_909062]-based follow-up (audio/ voice and/or text). Parents will receive automated daily educational  
messages related to how they can provide  recovery support to their children during the 2-week study 
period. Automated messages will be delivered  via Twilio,  by [CONTACT_909063] “initiate  survey as SMS  
conversation” feature in REDCap.  Parents will also receive reminders to schedule a follow-up 
appointment, with an option to received  tailored support from research staff to help with scheduling. A 
more detailed description  and content of each toolkit component can be found  in “Aim 3 Parent  Education 
Toolkit Content” uploaded in “Other Attachments”.
All patient materials will be available  in both English  and Spanish.  Certified translations  will be uploaded  
prior to use. 
For both Aims 2 and 3, survey data will be collected from parents at three time points:  immediately post-
visit, one day post-visit, and at 2-week  follow-up. A purposive subset  of parents who complete all three 
surveys in Aim 3 will be invited to participate in optional  one-on-one qualitative  interviews. Interviews will 
be conducted remotely  (e.g., by [CONTACT_909064]) and will be recorded. As part of parent data 
collection for Aims [ADDRESS_1276163] 
time point of survey  data collection. 
Aim 4: (1) Cognitive interviewing: Parents will complete  a one-on-one conversation  with a research team  
member in or near the ED. In that conversation,  they will be asked to read through a series  of survey 
questions about parent  behaviors,  self-efficacy, and knowledge related to concussion and concussion  
management to help develop the final survey instrument for Aims 2 and 3 (a mock up of the cognitive 
interviewing survey instrument can be found in “Other Attachments”). Participants will then be asked to 
provide feedback about  how they would  think about answering these questions, with a particular focus on 
identifying anything that is confusing about the questions conceptually and any wording that is confusing  
or ambiguous.  They  will not be asked to answer  questions  about their personal health  status or the health 
status of their children.  All potential participants will complete the 3-item Brief Health Literacy  Screen as 
part of screening, with stratified purposive recruitment among adequate  and low health literacy parents 
until thematic saturation of survey feedback is reached. (2) Online  surveys: Participants will complete 
online surveys built in REDCap with the survey link posted on the participant recruitment tool Amazon 
Mechanical Turk (or MTurk). The surveys will consist of behavior,  belief, knowledge, and demographic  
questions that will help us validate the survey  measures  to be used in Aims [ADDRESS_1276164] a subset of the survey questions on MTurk  with 
potential corrected  wording for clarity based on participant feedback. Participation in the online surveys  
will be voluntary and anonymous.   A mockup of the online  REDCap surveys can be viewed  in “Other 
Attachments”. Please see the study timeline (also uploaded in “Other Attachments”) for more information 
regarding the timing  of Aim 4.

Protocol Template (HRP-503) Click Template  Version 4.1: January [ADDRESS_1276165] data about subjects:10
  
Aim 1: Data  will be derived  from qualitative participant feedback (interviews, participatory design sessions  
and usability  feedback). The source  records that will be used to collect data from participants (e.g. 
question guides) are attached  to the Click  Smartform.  The qualitative question guides will change 
iteratively based on feedback from participants, but themes explored will remain the same, consistent with 
best practices for qualitative data collection. Please  note that all materials will be translated  to Spanish 
and uploaded  as an IRB modification  prior to recruitment of Spanish speaking  participants.  
Aims 2 and 3: Parents  will complete surveys  at three time-points:  (1) at initial ED visit before discharge, 
(2) one day post-visit, and (3) approximately two-weeks  post-visit. The first survey will be administered 
over the phone by [CONTACT_118734]. Surveys will be translated  into Spanish using a certified 
translation service and the research  team  member involved in parent data collection will be certified  to 
use Spanish or use a professional interpreter. Participating parents will be contact[CONTACT_909065]-visit 
and two-weeks post-visit  to complete the follow  up survey by [CONTACT_756] (call or text linking to a survey 
hosted on REDCap), or by [CONTACT_6968] (linking  to a survey hosted on REDCap). 58 Subsequently, a purposively 
selected subset of twelve  parents will be invited to participate  in a one-on-one qualitative  interview about  
their experiences with the education toolkit; additional parents may be recruited if necessary to reach  
thematic saturation. Please note that all materials will be translated  to Spanish and uploaded  as an IRB 
modification prior to recruitment  of Spanish speaking  participants.
Aim 4: (1) Cognitive interviews: Data will be derived from qualitative participant feedback (e.g., cognitive 
interviews). The source records that will be used to collect data from participants (e.g., question  guides)  
are attached to the Click Smartform. (2) Online  surveys: Data will be collected  through an online surveys, 
built in REDCap with the survey link posted on MTurk.
  
5.4. Data to be collected,  including long–term follow– up data:11
  
Aim 1: The goal of the parent interview  will be to (1) explore their experiences with communication in the 
ED following their child’s concussion and (2) provide critical feedback on the content and design  of the 
CDC ACE Care Plan.3 The Cultural Treatment Adaptation  Framework50, will provide the foundation for the 
open-ended question guide for parents, with questions about the handout focusing on: (1) language  and 
semantics, (2) use of culturally relevant  examples, and 3) preferences for material delivery. The goal of 
the healthcare  provider interviews  will be to review  the CDC ACE Care Plan handout3 and the RED 
Toolkit,19 and provide feedback about (1) barriers and facilitators to implementation  in the ED and (2) the 
type of support (e.g., materials, training) that they believe  would be helpful  for implementation. CFIR24 will 
provide the foundation  for the open-ended question guide for healthcare providers, with a focus on 
individual characteristics (e.g., provider knowledge and self-efficacy), implementation toolkit 
characteristics, and aspects  of the inner  setting (e.g.,  time pressures in the busy  ED, compatibility with 
existing communication networks and tools such as the EHR  system) that may constrain implementation 
success.
Aims 2 and 3: Survey data will be collected from up to 200 parents at three time points:  at initial ED visit 
before discharge,  one day post-visit, and at 2-week follow-up. Primary outcome. Our primary outcome  
will be parenting behaviors at 2 week follow-up (emotional  support and instrumental support).  Secondary 
outcomes. Parent surveys  at initial ED visit before discharge, one day post-visit, and two-weeks  post visit 
will assess  parent cognitions related  to concussion  management  and proximal cognitions  (concussion 
management knowledge and self-efficacy), parental anxiety related  to concussion management, youth  
outcomes (health-related quality of life, post-concussion symptoms),  the nature  of provider-parent  
communication in the ED (e.g., did the parent  have an opportunity to ask questions?),  and additional

covariates (demographics  and environmental conditions). In Aim [ADDRESS_1276166]-visit will also include  questions about  their experiences with receiving  the education toolkit. 
Parent Interviews (Aim 3 only): Based on parents’ responses to their experiences with the education 
toolkit, a purposive  recruitment  strategy will be used to invite by [CONTACT_6968] [ADDRESS_1276167] practice guidance for eliciting  qualitative data about implementation  barriers and 
facilitators and communication  experiences,  the question guide will remain open ended so that 
interviewers can explore  other  themes raised by [CONTACT_4317].  
Aim 4: (1) Cognitive interviews: The goal of the cognitive interview will be to assess  understanding of 
survey questions and receive  feedback on survey  content. Research assistants  will talk through  questions  
with parents and identify  1) if question wording is confusing or challenging in any way, and 2) if questions 
could be asked in a way that is easier  to understand. (2) Online surveys: The surveys will primarily  assess 
parent behaviors,  knowledge,  and self-efficacy related  to concussion management in order to validate  our 
survey tool Additional covariates (such as demographic information,  previously  diagnosed concussion) 
will also be collected for the purpose of ensuring  the survey tool is valid and reliable for the general  
population. Survey questions will come from a bank of potential questions, which can be found  in the 
support document  “Aim 2 Parent Survey Questions”.

There is no anticipated benefit  of participating  in this study. The information from this study could benefit  
children who sustain concussions in the future.
  
14.Data Analysis/Management
14.1. Data analysis plan, including statistical procedures:
  
Aim 1: Qualitative data will be digitally recorded and transcribed  verbatim and coded for relevant themes  
using a thematic analysis approach. This analysis will begin with an intensive  review of audio-recordings 
and coded transcripts by [CONTACT_909066]: [CONTACT_909089]:  6   
Protocol Version Date: 3/9/2021
Protocol Template (HRP-503) Click Template  Version 4.1: January 2019 
Page 14 of 33
and settings.  Coded segments will then be entered  into Dedoose  software to facilitate analysis, and 
themes will be iteratively revised to better represent the overall tenor of the interviews, until a 
representative sample of themes  has been  developed that is independently supported by [CONTACT_909067]. 
Interim analyses will be conducted after 5 interviews in each category, and themes that develop will be 
used to iterate provider support materials. We will explore whether there are emergent differences  in 
groups of parents  (e.g., differences by [CONTACT_909068]) and healthcare providers (e.g., by [CONTACT_909069]) and within family dyads. Data analysis  will occur on an ongoing basis,  with emergent results  
iteratively informing adaptations to the question guide so as to appropriately  clarify  and contextualize 
responses related  to the target areas of questioning. 
Aims 2 and 3:  Primary outcomes. We will compare parenting behaviors (emotional support and 
instrumental support) at Time  3 between the two groups using chi-squared tests for each behavior and 
total proportion of behaviors. Secondary outcomes. For each group  (control and intervention), the 
percentage of parents reporting receipt of specific discharge components will be calculated and 
compared. We will also compare rates across  specific  subgroups, including high vs. low health literacy 
parents and between parents who speak English at home vs. those who do not. These percentages will 
be compared across subgroups using chi-squared  tests  to assess statistical  significance. We will also 
compare characteristics of subjects who (a) agree  to participate vs. those who do not, and (b) participate 
throughout follow-up  vs. any lost to follow-up. We will also conduct exploratory analyses  of the mean  
change in parent cognitions related to concussion management (concussion management  knowledge60, 
parental anxiety, and behavioral self-efficacy59) and child well-being scores (child PEDs-QL62 and PCSI61) 
from Time [ADDRESS_1276171]-concussion  symptoms/severity,  as well as covariates not 
determined to be effect modifiers, if associated with outcome and distributions vary by [CONTACT_1570]. 
Missing data will be examined for patterns  with covariates, sensitivity analyses used to assess  impact of 
missing data on results and imputation  used as appropriate to address missingness. Parent  experiences 
with enhanced education.  Survey data will be analyzed descriptively, with associations  by  [CONTACT_909070], language, and gender  assessed. For qualitative  data, audio-recorded and transcribed interviews 
will be coded using a deductive content  analytic  approach66,[ADDRESS_1276172], two independent  coders will review each interview transcript, applying codes from the 
CFIR,24 Communication  Accommodation Theory, and USE-EBPI [INVESTIGATOR_909045]. They will then compare codes and agree on final codes using a process  of deliberation and 
consensus. 
Aim 4: (1) Cognitive interviews: Analysis will be conducted by [CONTACT_909071]’ comments and 
responses to questions  about the survey tool. We will explore  if there are any emergent differences in 
understanding survey  questions  among  groups of parents (low vs. high health literacy). Data analysis will 
occur on an ongoing basis, with emergent results iteratively informing adaptations to the question  guide  
and the survey itself; (2) Online surveys: Survey responses  will be reviewed  with a focus on the 
psychometric properties  of items and scales (e.g., how are responses distributed),  with the plan to retain 
only items with adequate  variability and normal  or near-normal distribution. To limit redundancies in the 
final survey,  we will conduct exploratory analyses  to determine which survey questions are correlated. 
Finally, we will compare responses across  key parent  characteristics (e.g.,  age, gender,  prior concussion)  
to determine whether psychometric properties are similar  across groups.
  
14.2. Quality control procedures  for collected data:[ADDRESS_1276173], the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_909046](s)

15.Confidentiality34
15.1. Procedures to secure  the data and/or biospecimens during storage, use, and transmission:
  
During data collection, all research  materials  (including the audio recording device used for qualitative  
interviews) containing personally  identifiable information will be kept in a locked container while not in 
use. All interviews conducted online will be recorded  via the online platform  (Zoom)  and all data will be 
secured on Seattle Children’s servers. When conducting interviews online, we will be using the latest 
version of Zoom, we will make the meetings private, passwords will be required for meeting entry, private  
chat will be disabled, and consent will be obtained prior to recording. After data is collected, any 
information which would  identify the participant(s) will be removed and code numbers  used instead.  
All identifiers will be destroyed within [ADDRESS_1276174]  
chooses not to participate, the both the child and parent  identifiers  will be destroyed  within  one week.
Transcribed audio-recorded  interviews and surveys will be de-identified and stored on the secure Seattle 
Children’s servers, accessible only to the study team; a numeric code will be used to link audio  interviews 
and/or surveys to participants. Only coded segments (without identifiers)  of recordings will be entered into 
Dedoose software. The link between study code and participant information  will be kept in a password-
protected file overseen  by [CONTACT_079].
All PHI will be stored in password protected REDCap projects, housed at UW and only accessible to 
members of the study team. The study PIs will be gatekeepers  of access. There will not be paper records 
of PHI. All study databases  will use a study ID. We believe this is the best method for protecting identifiers 
from improper use and disclosure. Once the study is complete, the key that links participant identity to 
their study ID will be destroyed.
  
15.2. Location where the data and/or  biospecimens will be stored:  
Data will be stored  on secure  Seattle  Children’s servers and/or in a locked container.  
  
15.3. Length of time data and/or biospecimens will be stored:
  
Data will be stored  for 5 years
  
15.4. Individuals with access to data and/or  biospecimens:
  
Data will only be accessible  to study team members  as specified by [CONTACT_978]. 
  
15.5. Process for the transmission of data and/or biospecimens outside Seattle Children’s:
15.5.1. List of data and/or  biospecimens that will be transmitted:
  
Interview data and audio  recordings, and survey data.   Twilio does record information exchanged via 
SMS conversations,  however, the information is removed from their logs after the transaction.  
  
15.5.2. Individual(s)  who will transmit data:
  
If any identifiable  data is to be transported, it will be stored in a locked container until it returns to the 
Seattle Children's  Research  Institute. Research assistants will make every attempt to remove identifiable 
information before transporting data. Study team members may transmit de-identified  data electronically.

19.Recruitment Methods40
19.1. When, where, and how potential subjects will be recruited:
  
Aim 1: 
Parents: We will recruit  20 parents of youth who: (1) sought care in the SCH ED or Urgent  Care 
for closed head injury in the past 2 years and during  the study period, and were  not admitted for 
inpatient care and (2) were 5-17 years at the time of the concussion-related visit. We will engage  
our partners in the ED (including the ED research team described below in Aims  2 and 3) to 
screen for eligible participants  via chart review. Every year, SCH ED sees approximately 1500 
youth patients with concussion,  1300 of whom are discharged to self-care (not admitted). SCH 
provides care to patients  who are diverse  in terms of socioeconomic status  and race/ethnicity with 
financial subsidy for any family with household income  <400% of the federal  poverty level; 
approximately 64% of SCH patients are non-Hispanic white, 25% use public insurance and 9% 
require an interpreter,  most often Spanish. Patients will be stratified by [CONTACT_909072] 
(public, private) and then contact[CONTACT_283787] a random selection process  until we have reached 10 
consenting parents within each stratum for a total of 20 parent participants.  Where possible, we 
will also stratify by [CONTACT_909073] (English, Spanish) and aim for

Protocol Template (HRP-503) Click Template  Version 4.1: January [ADDRESS_1276175] provided  with a written (mailed)  letter, and then subsequently contact[CONTACT_28136] 
(call or text message). 
Healthcare providers: 20 healthcare providers who work in the SCH  ED will be invited to 
participate in one-on-one qualitative interviews using a stratified randomized  recruitment strategy 
that ensures a representative proportion of participants by [CONTACT_909074] (male, female),  and 
professional role (physician, nurse). Healthcare providers  will be invited to participate by [CONTACT_909075]. Among  physicians, 
participation will be balanced between pediatric emergency medicine  faculty and pediatric 
emergency medicine fellows. Among nurses, participation  will be balanced among  registered  
nurses (RN) and nurse practitioners (ARNP).
Aims 2 and 3: SCH  has a team of research assistants physically present in the ED 10 hours  per 
day, 7 days per week to screen and inform families about research studies, and consent eligible 
and interested  parents.  This team also has the ability  to screen and inform families about 
research studies  who come  into the SCH Urgent Care and consent eligible parents. We will 
engage this team to screen for study eligibility of parents  of youth age 5-17 who sought  care for a 
closed head injury  and were  not admitted  for inpatient care. Parents  will be eligible for inclusion if 
they speak English or Spanish. For Aim 3, recruitment and consent will occur prior to 
randomization. 
A purposively selected  subset of parents will be invited by [CONTACT_909076] a qualitative 
interview.. 
Aim 4: (1) Cognitive interviews: We will engage  the SCH ED research team  described in Aims  2 
and 3 to screen  for parents  of youth who sought care for their child in the SCH ED or Urgent Care 
for any health issue and were not admitted for inpatient care. Parents will be eligible for inclusion  
if they speak English or Spanish. The research team will approach the parents after their child 
has been seen by a health professional but before they are discharged. Because  study staff will 
only approach parents  whose child has not been admitted to inpatient care, parents  will only be 
approached and informed of the study if their child has a low acuity level; (2) Online surveys: 
Individuals will be recruited through Amazon Turk (MTurk), an online  recruitment  platform. Due to 
the nature of MTurk, only individuals aged [ADDRESS_1276176] potential  subjects’ privacy interests:41
  
Aim 1: All research  activities will take place  in a private clinic  room, telephone or video conference line, or 
another private location preferred by [CONTACT_2299]. Before any research procedures begin,  the Research 
Assistant will explain that participants may choose to skip any questions they do not want to answer and 
they may discontinue the research  study at any time. Research procedures will be conducted in English 
or Spanish, depending on the preference of the participant. The RA will take steps to make the qualitative 
interview feel like a conversation, based  on supervision and training from the Principal Investigators. 
All information  will be stored on secure servers at the Seattle Children’s Research Institute  overseen by 
[CONTACT_5844]. Study staff will have access to this data as needed  for participant contact 
[CONTACT_158874]. 
Aims 2 and 3:
Parents: Initial research activities  will occur over the phone  while the participants are in or near the SCH 
ED and Urgent  Care. Follow-up  (at one day post-visit and approximately [ADDRESS_1276177]-visit)  will occur 
remotely (by [CONTACT_756]—text, or phone  call--or email, depending on the participant’s  preferences  ). 
Before any research procedures begin, the study team member will explain that participants may choose

to skip any questions they do not want to answer and they may discontinue the research study at any 
time. Research procedures will be conducted in English or Spanish,  depending on the preference of the 
participant. All information  will be stored on secure servers at the Seattle  Children’s Research Institute  
overseen by [CONTACT_224045].  Study staff will have access  to this data as needed for participant 
contact [CONTACT_158874]. 
. Subsequent qualitative  interviews with parents will be audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim, with all 
data stored  on secure servers at the Seattle Children’s  Research Institute overseen by [CONTACT_440734]. 
Aim 4: (1) Cognitive interviews: All research  activities will occur in person in or near the SCH ED and 
Urgent Care. Before any research  procedures begin, the Research Assistant  will explain that participants 
may choose to skip any questions they do not want to answer and they may discontinue the research 
study at any time.  All information will be stored on secure servers at the Seattle  Children’s Research 
Institute overseen  by [CONTACT_224045].  No personal health information about  participants will be 
collected; (2) Online surveys: Prior to accessing the surveys, participants will receive information about 
the purpose of the study (validating  a survey tool to measure concussion related  behaviors, knowledge, 
and self-efficacy) and the eligibility criteria for the study.  They will be informed that participation  is 
voluntary and anonymous. No personal  health information about  participants will be collected.

20.Consent/Assent Process
20.1. Consent process overview:44
Aim 1: All participants will review an information sheet, with parents  participating remotely 
providing verbal consent and parents participating  in person providing written documentation 
of consent All participants participating via Zoom will be informed that the session will be 
recorded and consent to record via Zoom will be obtained  prior to beginning the interview.  
Children will provide  verbal assent.  Healthcare provider participants will review an information  
sheet and provide verbal consent.  Participants will be provided with an opportunity to read 
through all documentation (information sheet/consent form) and to ask questions of the 
research team member involved  in consent.  
 Aims  2 and 3: All parents  in the Aim [ADDRESS_1276178] a full verbal  consent conference via phone  with a patient’s  parent 
or legal guardian and review all elements  of the informed  consent form prior to enrollment.  
Though the discussion will take place  on the phone, the parent and patient will know that 
research team member is on site and available to answer  questions. Whenever  possible,  the ED

research team will email a link to an electronic copy of the consent (and when applicable, 
assent) documents for the potential participant(s) to review during the consent conference.  We 
will also email or mail participants a copy  of these documents after enrollment is complete. 
Aim 4: (1) Cognitive interviews: All parents  will review an information sheet and will have time to 
ask questions of the research team member conducting the interview before deciding whether or 
not they will participate;  (2) Online surveys: All parents will be informed of the study on MTurk  
and given information about the contents of the survey (including the amount  of time the survey 
is anticipated to take) before  clicking the REDCap  link to take the survey.  The first page of the 
REDCap survey  will contain  an information  sheet  that participants will review before deciding 
whether or not to participate. Participants will be informed  that by [CONTACT_909077], 
they are consenting to participate. 
20.2. Where the consent  process  will take place:
  
Aim 1: This will occur  remotely (e.g., over the phone or via video conferencing)  or in person  at a 
private location (e.g., community  library, SCH  conference  room) as preferred by [CONTACT_2299].  
Aim 2 and 3: The consent process will take place  in or near the SCH  emergency department or 
Urgent Care.
Aim 4: (1) Cognitive interviews: An information sheet describing the study will be shared with 
parents in the SCH Emergency Department or Urgent Care; (2) Online surveys: Participants  will 
review an information sheet about the study online before clicking on to complete the survey.   
  
20.3. Steps that will be taken to protect prospective subjects’  privacy interests:45
  
Aims 1, 2, 3, and 4: Before  any research  procedures  begin, the Research Assistant will explain that 
participants may choose to skip any questions they do not want to answer  and they may discontinue the 
research study at any time. Research procedures will be conducted in English  or Spanish, depending  on 
the participants’ preferences.  
  
20.4. Waiting period  available between approaching  a prospective subject and obtaining consent:
  
Aims 1, 2, 3, and 4: There is no waiting period between consent and research  procedures;  
consent/assent/permission will be obtained  immediately prior to conducting research procedures.
  
20.5. Process to ensure ongoing consent:
  
 If any new information  arises that (1)  may be relevant to the participant’s  willingness to 
continue participation, (2) affects the rights, safety, and well-being of study subjects,  and/or (3) 
has an impact  on study conduct and outcomes, the research team will update enrolled 
participants that are impacted by [CONTACT_909078].

20.9.1. Process used to determine whether an individual has not attained the legal age of 
consent under  the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which  the research will be 
conducted (e.g.,  individuals under the age of 18 years):50
  
Aims 1, 2, and 3: The age of the child patient will be determined by [CONTACT_909079] (e.g., child below the age of 18 is required for a parent to be eligible to 
participate in the study).
Aim 4: N/A. All participants in this aim will be ages 18 and older, therefore determining  age of consent 
does not apply.
  
20.9.2. Parental permission will be obtained from:51
☐  Both parents  unless one parent is deceased, unknown, incompetent, or not 
reasonably available,  or when only one parent has legal  responsibility for the 
care and custody of the child.
☒ One parent  even  if the other parent is alive, known, competent, reasonably 
available, and shares  legal  responsibility  for the care and custody  of the child.
☐ Neither parent.52

20.9.5. Procedures for obtaining and documenting assent:
  
Aim 1: The information sheet will be provided  to the child (ages 13-17), and 
reviewed verbally by [CONTACT_909080]. An opportunity to ask 
questions will be provided, and the child will have  the option of providing  verbal 
assent for their participation. For children consented  in Aim 1 in person, written 
assent will be documented on the consent/assent form. 
Aims 2 and 3:  When obtaining assent  from children  ages 13-17, the ED research 
team will conduct a full verbal consent/assent  conference via phone  with both the 
patient and the patient’s parent or legal  guardian. During the call, they will review all 
element of the informed consent form prior to enrollment. Children will only be asked 
to assent after parents  or legal guardians consent and give permission.

20.11. Waiver or Alteration of Consent Process
20.11.1. Reasons  for requesting a waiver  or alteration of informed consent:59
We are requesting a waiver of consent for participants  who turn  18 during the 
study period,  outside  of data  collection windows.  
  
20.11.2. Consent  Waiver/Alteration Criteria justifications:60
[IP_ADDRESS]. The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects 
because:
Adolescent participants will have no active participation  in the study.  
The procedures that their parent or guardian  will be involved  in are 
low-risk, such as responding to surveys.
[IP_ADDRESS]. The waiver or alteration will not adversely  affect the rights or welfare 
of the subjects  because:[ADDRESS_1276181] the participants’ 
care, and they will be informed of this prior to agreeing to 
participation. 
  
[IP_ADDRESS]. The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver 
or alteration because:[ADDRESS_1276182] be included in the 
study for results to be meaningful. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. If the research involves using identifiable private information or 
identifiable biospecimens , the research  could not practicably  be 
carried out without using  such  information  or biospecimens in an 
identifiable format because:
Identifiable information for the research is needed to track  data 
collection over time and carry  out various research procedures (for 
example, in order to contact [CONTACT_909081]).
  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Whenever  appropriate,  the subjects  will be provided with additional  
pertinent information after participation:

21.Process to Document Consent in Writing
21.1. If consent  will be documented in writing  (check  one):
☐ “SOP:  Written Documentation of Consent (HRP-091)” will be followed.
☒ “SOP:  Written Documentation of Consent (HRP-091)” will not be followed.  
Process of documenting consent:64
 
Aim 1: Consent will be obtained verbally  if individuals are participating remotely
Aims 2/3: Consent  will be obtained  verbally  after a full consent  conference via phone  with 
a study  team member.  
Aim 4: (1) Cognitive interviews: Consent will be obtained verbally after individuals review 
an information sheet; (2) Online surveys:  Consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_909082]. 
  
21.2. If consent  will not be documented in writing  (check  all boxes that apply):65
☒ A written statement/information sheet describing the research will be provided to 
subjects.66
☐ A written statement/information sheet describing the research will not be provided to 
subjects.  Explain:  Click here to enter text.
☐ A consent script will be used.67
22.HIPAA Authorization and RCW Criteria
22.1. HIPAA  Authorization (check all boxes that apply):
☐ The study  does not involve  the receipt, creation, use and/or  disclosure of protected health 
information (PHI).68
☒ HIPAA  authorization  will be obtained  as part of a signed consent  form.  
☒ The study  will access PHI without prior authorization from subjects (including for 
recruitment purposes – e.g., reviewing the medical  record to determine  eligibility).  See 
21.2 below  for required HIPAA  waiver/alteration criteria.
☒ Subjects will review  a written  statement/information sheet with the appropriate HIPAA 
language but will not provide a written signature.  See 21.2 below for required HIPAA 
alteration criteria.69
☐ Other.   Explain:70
Click  here to enter  text.
  
22.2. HIPAA  Waiver/Alteration Criteria: Explain why:
22.2.1. The use or disclosure of PHI involves  no more  than a minimal risk to privacy  of 
individuals, based on, at least  the presence of the following elements:
[IP_ADDRESS]. An adequate plan to protect the identifiers  from improper use and 
disclosure:

Aims 1, 2,3, 4: The PI [INVESTIGATOR_909047]. All study data will be stored on secure  servers  requiring password 
access. Participant names will be stored in a separate password protected file accessible only to study 
staff under the supervision of the Principal  Investigator.  
  
[IP_ADDRESS]. An adequate plan to destroy identifiers at earliest opportunity consistent 
with conduct  of research:
  
Aims1, 2,3, 4: All PHI and identifiers will be destroyed at the earliest opportunity consistent with the 
research protocol.  We anticipate  that this will mean destroying PHI of the child subjects prior to the end of 
recruitment. If a parent  subject chooses not to participate, the child’s identifiers  will be destroyed within  
one week. 
  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Assurances that PHI will not be reused or disclosed to any other party or 
entity, except  as required by [CONTACT_733067]:
  
Aims 1, 2,3, 4: The PHI will not be reused or disclosed to any other person  or entity, except  as required 
by [CONTACT_2371], for authorized  oversight of the research study, or for other research  for which the use or 
disclosure of protected health information for which an authorization or opportunity to agree  or object is 
not required
  
22.2.2. The research  could not practicably be conducted without the waiver or alteration of 
authorization:
  
Waiver of HIPAA authorization for recruitment (all aims): We are requesting a waiver of HIPAA for 
recruitment purposes because we will not obtain HIPAA authorization  prior to collecting  a limited set of 
information about potential  participants’  children to be used to determine whether or not they meet  study 
eligibility criteria,  It is not practicable to get HIPAA authorization prior to accessing records for screening 
because we would be  unable to target the children  who have previously suffered closed head injuries 
and do not return to sports. We are also requesting a waiver of HIPAA authorization to collect email 
addresses of interested participants prior to obtaining consent so that we may share an electronic version 
of our consent form. 
Alteration of HIPAA authorization (removal of the signature [CONTACT_39530]) (aim 1 subjects 
participating by [CONTACT_648]): 
We anticipate that most data collection for Aim 1 will occur remotely (e.g., by [CONTACT_648]); we want to allow for 
broad participation by [CONTACT_909083] —including families who live in rural 
communities, communities far from Seattle  (e.g., Yakima) and among families  who have  limited resources 
(e.g., computer access).  Requiring a signature [CONTACT_909086] (limiting  our ability to 
recruit families from outside of the Seattle region) or requiring that they document consent electronically, 
which our prior experience  suggests limits  the ability and willingness of individuals with fewer resources 
and/or lower technological literacy to participate. 
Alteration of HIPAA authorization (removal of the signature [CONTACT_39530]) (aims 2,3): 
We request an alteration of HIPAA to remove  the signature  [CONTACT_39530]. We have previously  been 
granted a waiver of documentation of consent and assent and alteration of HIPAA for this study, with the 
stipulation that we ask participants to electronically  sign the consent and assent forms (including HIPAA 
language) using the REDCap electronic consent tool.

Given the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]-wide shortage of personal protective  equipment  and call to action to use phones  as the 
primary method  of communicating into rooms of patients, the ED research team has transitioned to 
enrolling participants without entering or opening  the door to the patient  room, when possible. To do this, 
the ED research team has been calling the patient’s parent/guardian on the patient  room  phone and 
verbally reviewing  all elements of the informed consent form. Then, the study team  has then been 
passing a study iPad through a small “pass through” door typi[INVESTIGATOR_909048] a printer 
sitting outside  the room, so the parent may document their consent electronically in REDCap, and pass  
the iPad back to the study team. However,  concerns remained from both clinical leadership as well as 
research team members about the ability to minimize or control infection  risk when team members are still 
passing materials back and forth through the pass-through door. There is much that is unknown about 
how long the SARSCoV2  pathogen can live on surfaces like an iPad. We also don’t know the infection 
risk from passing  materials back and forth with a family  member when the research team is not donning 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_467008]. 
In response to the ongoing emergency operations and PPE shortage  related to SARSCoV2 circulation 
and COVID-[ADDRESS_1276183] to fully utilize  the power of our IRB waiver of documentation to mean 
that no consent  or HIPAA documentation, written or electronic, is required at the time of study enrollment.   
Alteration of HIPAA authorization (removal of the signature [CONTACT_39530]) (aim 4)
The data will be linked to the MTurk ID, which can be linked to identifiers, but per MTurk policy, collection 
of personally identifiable information is not permitted (e.g. asking  for a worker’s name, email  address, or 
phone number) therefore  requiring a signature [CONTACT_909087].  Also,  the study team will have no 
contact [CONTACT_59299]’s who participate through Mechanical Turk,  so obtaining  a written signature [CONTACT_909088].
  
22.2.3. The research  could not practicably be conducted without access  to and use of the 
PHI:71
  
Aims 1, 2, and3: The PHI collected during screening activities is necessary  for the research. The research 
cannot be practicably conducted without  the alteration because access  to and use of PHI is necessary for 
screening purposes.
  
23.Payments/Costs to Subjects72

requires one parent  to provide permission  for the child to participate.
52 If parental  permission  will not be obtained, please address  this in the Waiver  or Alteration of Consent Process 
below.
53 See HRP-013 for more information.
54 The IRB generally follows the following  guidelines for written assent: children  7-12 should provide written assent  on 
the “simple” assent form (HRP-502G); children 13-17 should provide written assent  by [CONTACT_3252]-signing the parental  
permission form (HRP-502A).  The IRB will consider other assent scenarios (e.g. verbal assent for some or all 
children; not requiring  assent for some or all children; or waiving assent):  please  provide  details  about the plan for 
your study.   See HRP-090 and HRP-416 for more information on waiving assent  and when assent is not necessary.
55 See Appendix  A-13  of the Investigator Manual  HRP-103 for requirements for re-consent at age 18.  If you think  you 
meet the conditions for a waiver at 18, please  address this in the Waiver or Alteration of Consent Process below.
56 See “HRP-417 Cognitively Impaired Adults” for further information.  
57 For example: durable power  of attorney for health  care, court appointed guardian for health care decisions, spouse, 
and adult child.  If you are following  HRP-013  in order  to make this determination, simply state that in this section. For 
research conducted  in the state, review “SOP: Legally Authorized Representatives, Children, and Guardians  (HRP-
013)” to be aware of which individuals in the state meet  the definition of “legally authorized representative.” For 
research conducted  outside  of the state, provide information that describes which individuals are authorized under 
applicable law to consent on behalf of a prospective subject  to their participation in the procedure(s)  involved in this 
research. One method of obtaining this information is to have a legal  counsel or authority review your protocol  along 
the definition  of “legally authorized representative” in “SOP: Legally Authorized Representatives,  Children, and 
Guardians (HRP-013).”  If the sites in other states  in the study are conducting their own IRB review, you do not need 
to worry about this--type N/A.  If you are conducting research  and are actively recruiting participants  outside of 
Washington who are NOT coming to Washington  to give consent  and who will be covered under SCH  IRB approval,  
this section should be addressed in your protocol.
58 The IRB may allow the person obtaining assent to document  assent on the consent document.
59 For example: consent/parental permission will not be obtained, required information will not be disclosed,  the 
research involves deception,  waiver for participants who turn 18, waiver for information collected about a non-present 
parent, or other waivers as necessary.
60 The IRB needs to make all the waiver findings and key to this determination is that the IRB understand why it is not 
practicable to do the research without  a waiver of consent.  You need to provide a rationale in order for the IRB to 
consider whether the waiver  criteria are met. See “HRP-410: Waiver or Alteration of the Consent Process” for further  
information.  
61 Possible reasons might  include: a) you are not collecting information that could  put subjects or their families at 
harm, e.g., affect eligibility for insurance,  employability, stigmatization; b) you are not collecting  information that would  
alter or affect the subject’s  care;  c) any publication  or presentation of research results would  be done in a manner that 
would never reveal an individual’s identity  either directly or indirectly.

62 Possible reasons could be: a) inability to locate  families because of the lengthy time period  over which  the 
records/samples were created; b) many of the subjects  whose  records, data, or biospecimens will be used may have 
died and contact[CONTACT_733077]; c) all eligible  patients

the agreed recruitment  period.  For example, how many  potential  subjects do you have access  to? What percentage  
of those potential subjects do you need to recruit? (2) Describe the time that you will devote to conducting  and

Statistical Analysis Plan
Power analysis A sample power analysis using G*power (Erdfelder et al., 1996), and using an 
effect size from this treatment protocol in stroke with an alpha level of .05, power of .80, [ADDRESS_361531] deviations for 
these treatments within a Parkinson’s disease population.
We propose to recruit  approximately [ADDRESS_361532] of 96 semantically neutral sentences of between 
five to seven words, spoken in one of four emotional tones of voice (24 each of happy, sad, 
angry and fear), presented in randomized order, will be administered before initiating treatment, 
after treatment is commenced, and at one month post treatment commencement. All sentences 
will be rated acoustically and perceptually. Repeated measures ANOVAS (or nonparametric 
equivalents) will be used to compare on the primary measure of acoustic variability: (a) pi[INVESTIGATOR_296103], and (b) intensity or loudness. If measurement time is a significant predictor  
of Fo range at a .05 Type I error level, we will use Tukey’s method for pairwise comparisons to 
maintain the Type I error at .[ADDRESS_361533] adequately captured any change, the prosodic expression  
outcome measure will also be perceptually rated offline by [CONTACT_296104] (0-5). The blinded judges for these 
and subsequent evaluations will be trained in evaluating the prosody of emotionally intoned 
sentences. Training for these judges will include familiarization with the descriptions of features 
for each emotion with respect to changes in pi[INVESTIGATOR_23025], loudness, and rate. Both intra- and inter-
judge reliability will be calculated for these blinded judges.
Secondary outcome. Performance on identification, discrimination, and naming of facial and 
prosodic expressions of emotion.  These will be assessed using the FAB before and right after 
treatment. Paired samples t-tests were used to compare performance on standardized tasks of 
affect recognition before and immediately following treatment.
Intra- and Inter-Judge Reliability.  To evaluate intra-judge (test-retest) reliability, we will calculate 
mean and standard deviation of differences in the three perceptual outcome measures between 
the first and the second administration. Furthermore, we will calculate an intraclass correlation 
coefficient (ICC) estimate as well as a 95% confidence interval for ICC. In addition, ICC and 
related 95% confidence interval will also be calculated for inter-judge reliability at the first and 
the second administration, separately

1.1 Study  Objectives
The following objectives are ongoing from  STUDY00001243 previously approved by [CONTACT_1201]: 
(1) To evaluate the effectiveness of the eLearning Module (iLook Out for Child Abuse) created 
to train and inform childcare providers (CCPs);
(2) To identify CCPs’ current knowledge and attitudes regarding child abuse and its reporting;
(3) To evaluate the impact of  an online educational program on CCPs’ knowledge, attitudes, and 
patterns of decision-making regarding suspected child abuse and its reporting;
(4) To explore the factors influencing the impact of an online educational program on CCPs’ 
knowledge and attitudes regarding suspected child abuse and its reporting.
Study Objectives unique to the new study: 
(1) To  evaluate the impact of iLookOut on the incidence of “High Yield” reports of suspected 
child abuse. A high yield report is defined as a report for which: child abuse was confirmed or 
social services were recommended by [CONTACT_591905]/family.  
(2) To  evaluate the impact of iLookOut on the costs to the state from “low yield” childcare 
provider reports of suspected child abuse.
(3) To  be conducted with Childcare providers (CCPs) in the state of Maine.
(4) To  evaluate the effectiveness of after learning “pi[INVESTIGATOR_14839]” on learner retention.
1.2 Primary  Study Endpoints
Primary Outcomes are 1) child abuse confirmation rates among CCP-reported cases of suspected 
child abuse; 2) rates of social services recommended for children/families who were reported for 
suspected abuse; and 3) costs associated with intake by [CONTACT_591906].
1.3 Secondary  Study Endpoints
Secondary outcomes are 1) changes in the number of CCP reports of suspected abuse; 2) number 
of CCPs in each study arm who complete iLookOut and Standard training; 3) CCP knowledge 
and attitudes regarding suspected child abuse and its reporting; and 4) CCPs’ evaluation of the 
iLookOut and Standard training.
2.0 Background 
2.1 Scientific  Background and Gaps
1) children <5 years-old are particularly vulnerable to being abused; 2) despi[INVESTIGATOR_591878], childcare providers (CCPs) 
currently identify and report less than half of 1% of substantiated cases of child abuse; 3) CCPs 
are not adequately prepared to identify at-risk children and protect them from abuse; 4) reports of 
suspected abuse from CCPs are less likely to be substantiated (compared to other mandated 
reporters); 5) evidence-based interventions are needed to help CCPs better serve their crucial role 
STUDY00004740
Approval: 12/1/2021
Page 4 of  33 (V.04/20/2016) in child protection; and 6) online interventions have particular advantages for standardization, 
easy dissemination, follow-up reinforcement, and tracking of outcomes.
2.[ADDRESS_780517] was a field study that was completed with 60 
Penn State Harrisburg undergraduate students majoring in early childhood education to pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] a 
draft of the present study’s pre-/post-assessment instrument.  A subset of the pre-/post-
assessment’s knowledge items were subsequently pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]-tested with CCPs actively employed at 
area childcare facilities.
The second study was a randomized controlled trial involving 735 CCPs in Pennsylvania, which 
demonstrated that participants who completed the iLookOut learning module: 1) had significant 
improvements in knowledge, compared to baseline; 2) showed significant changes (in the 
expected direction) in their attitudes toward child abuse and its reporting, compared to baseline; 
and 3) reported high satisfaction with the learning program.
Additionally, there is an ongoing “open enrollment” trial in which >10,[ADDRESS_780518] 
identical to the previous randomized controlled trial of iLookOut.
2.3 Study  Rationale
The purpose of the present study is to examine whether (compared to Standard mandated 
reporter training, and also Control –i.e., no intervention), iLookOut affects the actual reporting 
behavior of CCPs.
3.0 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
3.1 Inclusion Criteria
1)Childcare  providers  (CCPs) in the state of Maine
a. “ CCP” refers to the various childcare professionals and others who work with young 
children, including teachers, aides, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], administrators, support staff, 
volunteers, and others.
2) CCPs who work (paid or volunteer) at a licensed childcare establishment in Maine.
3)  >18 years of age
3.2 Exclusion  Criteria
1) CCP  working in a non-licensed facility
2) <[ADDRESS_780519] will be 
excluded from analysis, except for the purposes of identifying factors correlated with 
non-completion of the learning program.  CCPs who report that they are <18 years of age 
also will be excluded from study analysis.

Childcare facilities along the I-95 corridor in southern Maine will be randomized to 3 study 
arms: iLookOut, Standard, and Control.  Any childcare facility within the recruitment area will 
have an equal chance of being in each study arm.  Those randomized to the iLookOut and 
Standard arms will be contact[CONTACT_591908] 2, 3, 
and/or 4 of the study, while those in the Control Arm will only be contact[CONTACT_591909] 2020  to complete the iLookOut program.
Directors of the childcare facilities will be provided with cards to distribute to their staff 
(uploaded as iLookOut- Recruitment Individual Access Cards), which will provide access to the 
online training (iLookOut or Standard) to which their childcare facility has been randomized.  
Additionally, brief questionnaires will be distributed at the end of years 2, 3, 4, and 5 to all  
childcare facilities groups (iLookOut, Standard, and Control ) to learn about CCP exposure to the 
various mandated reporter trainings.

pi[INVESTIGATOR_591879] (iLookOut Email Recruitment Communication ALL)
In the spring of 2020, the iLookOut learning module will be publicly available to CCPs who have 
access to a program license number throughout the state of Maine.  In the summer of 2021, 
iLookOut will be available to all licensed and non-license CCPs throughout the state of Maine.  
The program will be publicly listed as a Maine mandated reporter training for CCPs in Maine 
and on CCP professional development lists.  
After the October 2021 submission, learners who selected that they would participate in future 
research during program registration and completed the iLookOut  Core Mandated Reporter 
training will be sent a one-time follow-up REDcap survey.  The survey will be offered through 
December 2021.  
4.2 Recruitment  Process
Early childhood groups in Maine such as Maine Roads to Quality (MRTQ), Child Abuse and 
Neglect Councils, Home childcare alliance, and other similar groups may share approved Email 
and blanket messaging throughout the study with child care providers in our catchment area.  
The language that early childhood groups may use is included in the Community Group Support 
Language and Email.

Page 6 of  33 (V.04/20/2016) The iLookOut project has developed a website (www.ilookoutproject.org) and a Facebook page 
as a way to inform colleagues and community groups about the study.  The website and 
Facebook page is publicly available, and it is included in study team email signatures and could 
be shared by [CONTACT_591910]; therefore, it may be viewed by [CONTACT_42148].  Approved 
Facebook posts may be placed into Facebook ads.  
Any information created by [CONTACT_591911].  If the iLookOut team is sharing information 
from a community partner, we will use one of a few pre-approved postings and share the 
information from our community partner or other relevant organization.  
Once active enrollment has ended, the iLookOut program will remain publicly available to all 
CCPs in the state of Maine.  It will be listed on various CCP websites and listservs as training 
opportunities for mandated reporter and professional development credit.  
Those randomized to the iLookOut and Standard arms will be contact[CONTACT_426] a study team member 
to complete an online training during years 2, 3, 4 and/or 5 of the study, while those in the 
Control Arm will only be contact[CONTACT_591912] 2020 to complete iLookOut.  
Directors/owners of licensed child care facilities in the state of Maine will be sent a mailing with 
information about the study.  Additionally, the directors/owner will receive an email contact 
(included in uploaded iLookOut- Recruitment Email Communications ALL) The study team will 
also contact [CONTACT_591913].  If requested during a phone conversation, the study 
team will visit the center in-person to answer questions.  
The study team will contact [CONTACT_591914]/owner by [CONTACT_591915] s/he would like 
additional information and/or in-person contact.  If the study team is not able to make contact 
[CONTACT_591916] (using the previously approved iLookOut- Phone Script), an email 
will be sent to directors/owners with emailed content that is similar to the phone script.  This 
email has been included in the 11-22-17 revision of the iLookOut email communication 
document (ALL).  
If the  director/owner does not respond to the initial email and/or call, the study team will 
continue to re-send the recruitment email 1 time per week for up to 8 months.  Follow-up phone 
calls will be made monthly for up to 8 months.  One phone call per month will be followed-up 
with the follow-up email included in the 11-15-17 revision of the iLookOut communication 
document (ALL).  If the director, owner, or other primary staff member indicates they no longer 
wish to be contact[CONTACT_38435], all contact [CONTACT_591917].

Individuals from the control arm who have asked to be notified when the program is available in 
their area will be emailed directly 1 time.    
The study mailing sent to directors/owners of the childcare facilities will include cards (upon 
request)
 and/or handouts to distribute to their staff, which will provide information about 
accessing the online training to which their childcare facility has been randomized.  In addition 
to contact [CONTACT_3265] a study team member, directors of the childcare facilities will receive handouts and 
other information about enrolling in the study, which will be sent by [CONTACT_3476], as well as 
various groups in Maine that provide educational resources to CCPs.
Additionally, brief questionnaires (uploaded as Maine End- of Year Survey) (about CCPs’ 
exposure
 to various mandated reporter trainings) will be distributed at the end of year [ADDRESS_780525], and control 
arms.  This survey will be sent out to the Maine Roads to Quality (MRTQ) email list  using a 
RedCap link.  MRTQ is the group who oversees child care professional development in the state 
of Maine.  MRTQ will not have access to any iLookOut data; they will simply distribute an 
iLookOut approved e-mail and RedCap link.  All data will go directly into the Penn State 
RedCap system.  MRTQ has a comprehensive list of all child care providers in the state of 
Maine- including those in all arms of our study (iLookOut; Standard; & Control).  This will give 
us an idea of bleed across all child care providers in the state of Maine.  
A one-time follow-up REDcap survey will be sent out only to learners who have selected that 
they are willing to be contact[CONTACT_5646].  This one-time survey and a new summary of

7.0 Study  Design and Procedures
7.1 Study  Design
This 5-year study will use a randomized controlled trial design to evaluate the efficacy of an 
innovative educational intervention, iLook Out for Child Abuse (iLookOut), for improving 
childcare provider (CCP) reporting of suspected child abuse. Year [ADDRESS_780528] arm will be recruited to complete Maine’s 
existing online mandated reporter training, read 4 brief articles, and answer 1 question for each 
article (needed to receive 1 hour of professional development credit).  CCPs in the iLookOut arm 
will be asked to complete iLookOut  (which includes follow-up engagement activities), and those 
in the Control arm will not be recruited to complete any training.  At the end of year 2, 
participants in all groups will be asked to complete an end-of-the year survey.  A separate 
summary explanation of research will accompany this survey.   
During Year 3, CCPs in both the iLookOut and Standard arms will be recruited to complete 
iLookOut (which includes follow-up engagement activities), and those in the Control arm will 
not be recruited to complete any training.   
In the spring of 2020, CCPs in all three study arms will be recruited to complete iLookOut 
(which includes follow-up engagement activities- pi[INVESTIGATOR_415724]).  
This sequential enrollment to receive the target intervention (iLookOut) is a uni-directional 
crossover design referred to as a “stepped wedge design.”  This study design will allow the 
research team to examine both the immediate effect of iLookOut, as well as its effect over time.
In the spring of 2020, iLookOut will be made available (free-of-charge) to all CCPs in Maine, 
and outcomes data will continue to be collected for analysis.  Child care license numbers will 
continue to be collected.  This will allow the study team to continue separating the data by [CONTACT_360960] (iLookOut, Standard, Control, and All other CCPs in Maine) without limiting the access to 
the mandated reporter program. 
To estimate uptake/penetrance of the iLookOut and Standard training in each arm, surveys 
(uploaded as Maine End-of Year Survey) will be administered at the end of year 2, asking if 
individuals have heard of either training, and if they completed either training.  This will be 
identified with the center licensing number, but it will not ask the individual participant for any 
private information.

Page 13  of 33 (V.04/20/2016) Data from Maine’s Office of Children and Family Services will be used to compare baseline and 
post-intervention outcomes for each of the 3 study arms, and over time.  In this examination of 
reporting behaviors of CCPs, the Primary Outcomes are 1) child abuse confirmation rates 
among CCP-reported cases; 2) rates of social services recommended by [CONTACT_591924]/families who were reported; and 3) costs associated with intake and investigation of 
reports in which abuse was not confirmed and no social services were recommended.  
Secondary Outcomes are 4) changes in the number of CCP reports of suspected abuse; 5) 
number of CCPs in each study arm who complete iLookOut and Standard training; 6) CCP 
knowledge and attitudes regarding reporting suspected child abuse; and 7) CCPs’ evaluation of 
the iLookOut and Standard training.  8) the impact of after learning engagement actives

7.2 Study  Procedures
7.2.1 Pre-Registration
During the randomization phase (years 2-3), the center director/owner will be asked to 
indicate if they would like to be contact[CONTACT_591925].     
In the spring of 2020the study will be available to the entire state of Maine.  The study 
team
 will continue to recruit center directors/owners by [CONTACT_591926].  Center license numbers will continue to be collected, so the study 
team can continue to analyze data by [CONTACT_30157].  Previously mentioned community 
partners –like Maine Roads to Quality and Maine Office of Children and Families- may 
also distribute information about the iLookOut training widely.   
7.2.[ADDRESS_780529] arm initially will be recruited during Year 2 to complete Maine’s current 
online child abuse training, and then during Years 3-5 will be recruited to complete 
iLookOut.  CCPs in facilities randomized to the Control arm will not be recruited to 
complete any training during Years 2-3, but then will be recruited beginning in the spring 
of 2020 (during Years 4 and 5) to complete iLookOut.
To accomplish recruitment goals, study staff will send mailings, call, and/or meet with 
Directors of childcare facilities and provide recruitment packets appropriate for the group 
to which that childcare facility was randomized.  This packet will include a summary 
explanation of the research, responses to frequently asked questions, fliers for the study, a 
study brochure, a study handout, and recruitment cards (optional) that will explain how 
CCPs in that facility can access the designated online training (the uploaded names of the 
documents used for each group can be found in appendix 3).  Study staff will follow-up 
with the childcare facility Directors/owners periodically to address questions and/or other 
issues related to the study, including ensuring that CCPs who completed the training have 
received their certificates documenting hours of earned professional development credit.

explanation of research, their participation, as well as data collection and use.  
7.2.3 Registration  and Learning Module
Because the study team will talk primarily with childcare facility 
directors/owners/administrators responsible for maintaining staff training, consenting 
must take place as a part of the study’s online registration process.  This will ensure that 
all study participants taking the online training receive the same standard summary 
explanation of research.
Participants will begin registration by [CONTACT_591927]’s state license number, their 
name, and email address.  The center state license number is required because center staff 
are randomized to the standard, iLookOut, or control training arms based on the center’s 
licenses number.  Then, participants will activate their online account through the link 
provided to them via email.  After authentication and registration has been completed, 
participants will be provided with a summary explanation of research, and participants 
will continue to complete the registration process and collection of demographic data.  
Participants will then be asked to complete the pre-assessment.  All participants will then 
be asked to complete the online training, followed by [CONTACT_7620]-assessment, followed by [CONTACT_591928].  This can be completed at one time point or at various 
time points, at the discretion of the participant.
After the participant completes the online training, the host of online training will store 
the research data and provide documentation necessary for participants to receive 
professional training credit and appropriate state credit for mandated reporter training.

During registration, CCPs randomized to receive iLookOut will be informed that they can 
receive additional educational resources via a web-based App that can be downloaded to 
a cell phone or tablet or accessed online using a computer.  This process of providing 
follow-up education is called pi[INVESTIGATOR_007]-ing, and the individual notifications “pi[INVESTIGATOR_14839].”  After the

Page 16  of 33 (V.04/20/2016) The iLookOut after learning program mentioned in the paragraph above will be 
temporarily taken down between October 1st 2018- Spring 2019.  This program will 
temporarily be down while we re-develop this learning content on a new platform with a 
different developer.  Learners who are actively engaged in the after-learning program or 
learners who complete the iLookOut learning program during this time will have the 
opportunity to complete 1 year of after-learning activities (Modules 1-53) between 
August 7th- October 1st.  We will notify learners of this opportunity by [CONTACT_591930], weekly iLookOut After-Learning (pi[INVESTIGATOR_415724]) email messages with the iLookOut 
Open Access Email included in this submission.  The iLookOut Open Access Email will 
be sent out weekly between August 7th-October 1st.  
The iLookOut learning program will remain active during this time.  Once the iLookOut 
after learning program is fully functional on the new platform in Spring of [ADDRESS_780537]-training  Data Collection
Over the course the study, the state of Maine will provide the research team de-identified 
aggregate data on CCP reports of suspected abuse, including: the number of reports; their 
outcomes (confirmed vs. unfounded); kinds of abuse identified; whether social services 
were recommended (and what kind); and whether the CCP making the report completed 
any training on child abuse (and if so, which).
To identify which CCP report data need to be examined for the research study, intake 
workers at Maine’s Office of Child and Family Services (OCFS) will ask all individuals 
making a report whether they have worked (paid or volunteer) at a childcare facility since 
Aug. 1, 2017.  Those who answer “yes” will then be asked whether they completed any 
training on child abuse, and if so which.  Responses to these questions will then be 
entered into a separate data field within Maine’s Automated Child Welfare Information 
System, which then can be queried to create the de-identified aggregate reports 
mentioned above.
As a back-up to ensure that participants in the iLookOut , Standard, and control arms are 
not missed, the names of CCPs who make reports of suspected abuse will also be cross-
checked against the names of CCPs who have completed the iLookOut  and Standard 
online trainings used in the research study.  Child Care providers will be informed that 
some registration information will be used to verify and connect various data sets 
including: learning module data, pi[INVESTIGATOR_591889], and data from Maine’s child abuse 
reporting system.  The connecting information will be kept as a code book and destroyed 
after all data are connected.  Because the vast majority (>99%) of CCPs do not report 
suspected child abuse during any given year, there is no expectation that a given 
individual who completes the iLookOut or Standard training will report suspected abuse.  
As such, it will not be seen as a red flag that a given study participant did not make a 
report.

In addition to data collection associated with the iLookOut  and Standard online trainings, 
research staff will distribute surveys at the end of Year 2 to CCPs in all three arms of the 
study to evaluate penetration of the study interventions.  These brief surveys will be sent 
out to the Maine Roads to Quality (MRTQ) email list using a RedCap link.  MRTQ is the 
group who oversees child care professional development in the state of Maine.  MRTQ 
will send out the end-of-year survey link and end-of-year survey message [ADDRESS_780538] access to any iLookOut data; they will simply distribute an 
iLookOut approved e-mail and RedCap link.  All data will go directly into the Penn State 
RedCap system.  MRTQ has a comprehensive list of all child care providers in the state 
of Maine- including those in all arms of our study (iLookOut; Standard; & Control).  This 
will give us an idea of bleed across all child care providers in the state of Maine. The 
survey will ask for the participant to provide the childcare facility license number that 
they used to complete training.  This number is not personally identifiable and only 
identifies a childcare facility.   The survey will not include (nor request) any personally 
identifying information.  These surveys will ask whether the individual has heard of, 
and/or completed, the iLookOut and/or Standard online trainings.  
Note that control group participants do not receive any training or research study contact 
[CONTACT_591931] 2-3, except for the end-of-year survey. Learners will receive a separate summary 
explanation of research (uploaded as Summary Explanation of Research to Accompany

CCPs who complete iLookOut will receive weekly after-learning messages (or “pi[INVESTIGATOR_14839]”) (via App 
and/or  email), whose content will include updates, supplementary training materials, practical 
resources, questions/quizzes, etc.  It is anticipated that these pi[INVESTIGATOR_591892] 1-5 minutes to read

may opt out of receiving these messages at any time.  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_591893].  Child care providers will not receive 
“pi[INVESTIGATOR_14839]” without completing the iLookOut program, and will be told that the iLookOut App will 
allow them to receive pi[INVESTIGATOR_14839] (i.e., updates, additional educational materials, and brief questions) 
after completing the iLookOut training.  Because the term “pi[INVESTIGATOR_415724]” is only used in specific 
learning gamification circles, our research population is not likely to be familiar with this term, 
and hence the term is not referenced in the materials shared with CCPs.  
The iLookOut after learning program mentioned in the paragraph above will be temporarily 
taken down between October 1st 2018- Spring 2019.  This program will temporarily be down 
while we re-develop this learning content on a new platform with a different developer.  Learners

STUDY00004740
Approval: 12/1/2021
Page 19  of 33 (V.04/20/2016) In the spring of 2020, CCPs throughout Maine will have access to iLookOut ,  which may result in 
additional numbers of research participants.
8.3 Sample  Size Determination
In the spring of 2020, iLookOut will be made available to all CCPs in Maine.  Therefore, while 
we will actively recruit ~4,[ADDRESS_780547] data from additional CCPs who choose to register and complete the 
iLookOut outside of the catchment area.  As such, there is no official limit at this time for the 
number of CCPs who may participate in the study.
Sample size estimation for the number of needed reports is based on multivariate analysis of 
variance (MANOVA) for the [ADDRESS_780548] 5 years from Maine (see Appendix 4.7). Assuming a medium 
effect size of 0.[ADDRESS_780549] to MANOVA analysis of the repeated measurements, at alpha 
level of 0.05, to obtain a statistical power of 80% to detect the effect of intervention and time, 22 
reports from each of the 3 arms (66 total), are needed annually. Given the nature of 
social/behavior research, a conservative drop-off rate of 20% will be expected (to account for 
CCPs recruited to the study, but who leave before outcomes are measured at year’s end). This 
results in a final sample size estimation of 84 (= 66 ÷ 0.8) in total (28 reports per arm).
8.4 Statistical  Methods
The primary statistical analysis will be the analysis for repeated measurement of the 2 primary 
dependent variables as defined in the Specific Aims, using the arm and time as the 2 primary 
independent variables, through MANOVA. According to recent literature on the stepped wedge 
design, the common linear mixed model (LMM) will be utilized instead of the generalized 
estimating equations (GEE) or generalized linear mixed models (GLMM), given that the [ADDRESS_780550] equal size. We will use the PROC MIXED software, version 9.4, including modeling the 
polynomial trends over time and comparisons of the 2 primary dependent variables among the 3 
groups at different time points. 
Additional analyses will be performed to explore the relationship between the primary dependent 
variables and the covariates, using appropriate statistical analyses (e.g., ANCOVA, t-test, non-
parametric tests, chi-square, etc.), whose choice will depend upon study outcomes data and their 
distribution. However, the results from these additional analyses should only be interpreted as 
exploratory (not confirmatory) because the sample size estimation is not based on these 
covariates, and therefore these analyses may not have enough power to detect any meaningful 
effect for these covariates. 
Moreover, since individual level data will be collected (e.g., CCPs’ knowledge and attitude 
scores), additional analyses of these data also will be performed (e.g., t-test, chi-square, 
ANOVA, non-parametric tests, and psychometric analyses), again based upon the data and their 
distribution –with the results likewise interpreted as exploratory. The same analytic approaches 
will be applied to the data on Report Rate, Confirmation Rate, Social Service Rate, and Cost 
data, as for the supplementary analyses.

The study poses no risk beyond those encountered in everyday life, nor does participation impose ay 
expectations (professional, legal, or otherwise) not already incumbent on child care professionals.  
Participants may experience psychological discomfort due to the subject matter, though efforts will 
continue to be made to minimize this discomfort.  There is no violence nor graphic images in iLookOut , 
and all scenarios and language are carefully constructed to reduce any potential discomfort.  
There is a risk of loss of confidentiality if participant information is obtained by [CONTACT_591933].  Precautions will be taken to prevent this from happening.  
For subjects who have elected to receive after-training contact [CONTACT_591934]/or online, we are 
including the following in the Summary Explanation of Research: 
“It is illegal in the state of Maine to text while driving.  It is also dangerous to pay attention to your cellular 
phone while driving, walking, or doing any activity that requires your attention. You should continue to 
exercise good judgment on this while participating in this study.”
12.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects and Others
12.2 Potential Benefits to Subjects
Successfully completing the online training that is part of this research study will provide 
participants with education about child abuse and their responsibilities as mandated reporters, as 
well as appropriate professional development credit.
12.3 Potential Benefits to Others
To the extent  that iLookOut is effective in improving participants’ awareness and knowledge, 
participants will be better prepared to take the appropriate steps to identify and report children at 
risk for child abuse –which would benefit society as a whole.
To the extent  that iLookOut causes an increase in high quality reports of child abuse and better 
use of limited resources for investigating child abuse reports, other states and society as a whole 
may benefit from implementing similar training.  A reduction in low quality reports also may 
reduce psychological burdens experienced by [CONTACT_591935].

Approval: 12/1/2021
Page 26  of 33 (V.04/20/2016) -legal  immunity so long as a report is made in good faith
3. Become  empowered and motivated to protect children who are at risk for abuse, including:
-What  to do when there are barriers to reporting suspected abuse

23.2 Appendix 2: Explanation of “Pi[INVESTIGATOR_007]-ing” 
Originally (and technically), to “pi[INVESTIGATOR_007]” someone (or their computer) involved sending a test unit of data that 
would
 generate a return message, allowing the sender to measure the lag time between sending and retrieving 
data.  As such, the term “PI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]” originally stood for “Packet Inter-Network Groper,” and was intended to mimic 
the term submarine operators used to indicate a returned sonar pulse.
Over the past decade, the term “pi[INVESTIGATOR_007]” has evolved to also mean "getting the attention of" or "to check for the 
presence of" another party online.  Forms of pi[INVESTIGATOR_007]-ing include tweets, Facebook alerts, and other instant 
messaging that provide updates, reminders, and queries.  Some pi[INVESTIGATOR_591898], while some 
have response-options for the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_591899], and others provide web-links to videos, download-able 
documents, or interactive activities.
There are multiple commercial services that allow individuals, businesses, and other groups to send out both 
generic and tailored pi[INVESTIGATOR_591900].  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], pi[INVESTIGATOR_591901]-phones or other mobile 
technology, but they can also be sent to emails or other computer-based addresses.
We have contracted with the company CAIT to use pi[INVESTIGATOR_007]-ing technology to send prompts to childcare providers 
(after they have completed iLook Out for Child Abuse) to both reinforce learning and provide opportunities for 
real-time interactive engagement that follows on the goals and learning objectives of the intervention.

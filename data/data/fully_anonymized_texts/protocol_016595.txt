2. Study Hypotheses and Specific Aims:  
 
1) Test the impact of the revised BAILAMOS© program on lifestyle PA at 4 months and 
BAILAMOS© maintenance activities on lifestyle PA maintenance at 8 months.  
o Hypothesis 1: Lifestyle PA (self -repor ted and accelero meter -assessed) will be 
significantly higher in the BAILAMOS© group at 4 and 8 months compared to the control 
group.  
 
2) Test the impact of the revised BAILAMOS© program at 4 months, and BAILAMOS© 
maintenance activities at 8 months, on self -efficacy (mediators) and on health outcomes 
(physical function, cognitive function, and self -reported functional limitations and disability).  
o Hypothesis 2a: Self -efficacy for PA, Balance, and Gait will be significantly higher in the 
BAILAMOS© group at [ADDRESS_162005] of the BAILAMOS© 
program on lifestyle PA a nd health outcomes.  
o Hypothesis 2b: Physical function, cognitive function, and self -reported functi onal 
limitations  and disability scores will be significantly better in the BAILAMOS© group at 4 and 8 
months compared to the control group.  
 
3. Background and Significance  
Older Latinos comprised 7% of the older adult population in 2002, but are expected t o constitute 
20%  by 2050.(1) Physical activity (PA; any body movement that results in energy expenditure)  
can influence potential decline s in the health outcomes of physical and cognitive function that 
lead to functional limitations (self -reported restrict ions in performa nce) and disability (functional 
limitations placed in a social context(2)). Self -efficacy  (confidence in one’s capabilities to 
successfully carry out courses of action/confidence in capabilities to exercise)  is both a 
determinant and an out come of PA(3) an d has been shown to predict functional limitations.(4) 
BAILA 
Version # 38; 6/6/2016  Pa ge 2 of 15 
 Unfortunately, Latinos aged 65 -74 are 46% less likely to engage in leisure time PA than older 
non-Latin o whites(5) and little is known about PA maintenance among ethnic minorities 
compa red to non-Latin o whites.(6) In part as a result of low levels of PA, the physical and 
cognitive function of older Latinos is poor relative to older non -Latino whites. Older  Latinos are 
almost twice as likely to report difficulty walking than non -Latino wh ites and their u se of 
assistive device s is 33% higher.(7-9) Moreover, the number of Latinos in the U.S. with 
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is projected to increase by 600% in the next 50 years(10) and AD 
symptoms may begin seven years earlier in Latinos than in non-Latino whites.(11)  
Participation in PA has substantial potential to help older Latinos maintain both physical and 
cognitive function as they age. Walking and dancing are the two most commonly reported forms 
of PA among older Latinos.(12-15) However, u rban older Latin os cite unsafe neighborhoods and 
extreme weather conditions as significant barriers to walking. Dance is a widely popular form of PA among Latinos of all ages(16, 17) and holds considerable promise as a culturally appropriate 
form of PA tha t challenges ind ividuals both physic ally and cognitively. To date, PA programs 
designed for older Latinos are lacking. BAILAMOS©  is an innovative dance program that has 
been developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Marquez (PI) based on focus group input from older community-dwe lling 
Latinos an d in collabor ation with an accomplished Latin dance instructor. A single group, pre -
post 3-month pi[INVESTIGATOR_142571]© demonstrated substantial program feasibility (only 3 of 12 
participants dropped out, and participants attended 85% of the 24 sessions). Effe ct sizes 
(Coh en’s d) indicated greater self -reported lifestyle PA ( accumulation of leisure time, household, 
occupational, and transportation PA over the entire day )(18) (d=1.38) and greater enjoyment of 
PA (d=.61) following the intervention . Imp rovements i n physical function (mobility, d= -.56; 
usual gait speed, d= -.10) and cognitive function (ds=.11 -.12) were also seen. Now, a larger 
efficacy trial conducted over a longer time period is necessary to examine the intervention 
effects.  
 The or iginal 3 -month B AILAMOS© dance program has been revised according to 
participant and dance instructor feedback. Eight se ssions (1 month) have been added to increase 
overall dose of PA from 24 sessions over 3 months to 32 sessions over 4 months. Also, 
discu ssion sessions c overing topi[INVESTIGATOR_142572]. We propos e a 
randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of the revised 4 -month BAILAMOS© 
program for improving lifestyle PA and health outcomes (physical and cognitive function, self -
reported functional limitations, disability) in sedentary older Latino s at risk for disability relative 
to an attention control group. We will also test whether lifestyle PA and health outcomes can be 
maintained over an additional 4-months  through BAILAMO S© maintenance activities, which 
include using indigenous dance leaders. This study will use an RCT (N=166 Treatment, 166 
Control) with a health education control group that will allow us to examine the adoption of PA 
and its impact on heal th outcomes (fir st 4 months), and the short -term maintenance of PA and its 
impact on health outcomes (8 months) among older Latinos.

(d) Difficulty/change with any one of the following four tasks: (1) walking a long distance (4 
blocks or ½ mile), (2) climbing 10 steps, (3) transferring fr om a bed or chai r, (4) walking a short 
distance on a flat surface. Two questions will be asked for each task: ‘‘Have you had difficulty 
(task)’’ and ‘‘Have you changed the way you (task) or how often you do this, due to a health or physical condition?’’ Ol der adults with difficulty/change with any one of the four tasks will be 
eligible for the study, similar to methods used by [CONTACT_142586]. and those used in our BAILAMOS© pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268].  Inclusion Criteria for Directors: Coordinate or oversee the day to day 
operati ons of a Senior C enter where our program took place.  
 
Exclusion criteria include presence of uncontrolled cardiovascular (CV) disease or uncontrolled 
diabetes mellitus, stroke  [ADDRESS_162007], healing or unhealed fracture(s), hip or knee 
replacement in  the last [ADDRESS_162008] 12 months. 
Also, regular use of a walker or wheelchair.  
Exclusion Criteria for Director’s: any individual that does not have the role of Director or 
Coordinator at Senior Centers where our program took  place.  
Participants will be administered the Exercise Assessment and Screening for You (EASY) for risk assessment during screening (Resnick et al., 2008). The EASY has recommendations for 
when medical clearance is needed before beginning a PA program. We will follow those 
recommendations, with some revisions (below). If participants need medical clearance, we will ask for participant permission for us to fax information about the study and a letter that the physician can sign and fax back to us giving perm ission for the participant to participate in the 
research. This document will assist the researcher in obtaining the required consent from his/her physician without being reliant upon the subject to remember to obtain and/or return this document.  
1. Do you have pain, tightness or pressure in your chest during physical activity (walking, climbing stairs, household chores, similar activities)?  
EASY recommendation:  
If you answered yes to this question and this is a NEW problem, see your health care provider first before starting any exercises. Ask your health care provider “Are there any exercises that I 
cannot do”?  Work with your doctor to identify activities that are appropriate for you.  
If it is not new, or has already been evaluated, begin  or continue your  exercise program.  
Our procedure:  
BAILA 
Version # 38; 6/6 /[ADDRESS_162009].  
2. Do you currently experience dizziness or lightheadedness?  
EASY  recommendation:  
If you answered yes, it is recommended that you talk with your health care provider before 
initiating a new activity p rogram. 
Ask if there are any exercises you cannot do. Work with your provider to identify exercises good for you.  
Our pro cedure:  
If they answered yes to this question, then they must get medical clearance first.  
3. Have you ever been told you have high blood pressure?  
EASY recommendation:  
If your blood pressure has not been checked in the last 6 months, get it checked by a h ealthcare 
provider.  
If you answered yes, you may continue to exercise to improve your overall heart health and prevent disease.  
Our procedure:  
If they answered yes to this question, and they have not had blood pressure checked within [ADDRESS_162010] be <180/100, as per [CONTACT_142604].  
4. Do you have pain, stiffness or swelling tha t limits or preve nts you from doing what you want 
or need to do?  
EASY recommendation:  
If you answered yes, continue to enjoy your exercise to prevent worsening of your arthritis and help manage your pain. If you have osteoporosis always avoid stretches tha t flex your spi[INVESTIGATOR_142573], and avoid making jerky, rapid movements.  
Our procedure:  
If they answered yes to this question, then we will make a note that no bending exercises should be done by [CONTACT_2299], should they qualify and participate. Given it is a dance program, and not an exercise program, this should not be problematic.  
5. Do you fall, feel unsteady, or use an assistive device while standing or walking?  
EASY recommendation:  
If you answered yes, it is recommended that you talk with your  health care provider before 
initiating a new activity program.  
Ask if there are any exercises you cannot do. Work with your provider to identify exercises good for you.  
BAILA 
Version # 38; 6/6 /2016  Pa ge 5 of 15 
 Our procedure:  
If they answered yes to this question because they fal l or use an assistive device, then they will 
be excluded as those are other exclusion criteria. If they answered yes to this question because 
they feel unsteady, then they must get medical clearance first.  
6. Is there a health reason not mentioned why you  would be concern ed about starting an exercise 
program? EASY recommendation:  
If you answered yes, SHARE this information with your health care provider  
Most reasons can be addressed and you can begin an exercise program that will improve your 
overall healt h and well -being.  
Our procedure:  
If they answered yes to this question, they are encouraged to share this information with their 
doctor. Apparently this question is meant as motivation to talk to their doctors, not as exclusion 
criteria (per [CONTACT_142604]) 
 
Additional reasons to require medical clearance:  
If participants report having the following:  Stroke, 1year or more post;  pacemaker in situ, severe 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, major head trauma within past [ADDRESS_162011]. Ma rquez (PI), who 
has been working with Chicago Latino communities since 2007. The Community Engagement 
Advisory Board (CEAB) of the Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) at UIC will also provide assistance. Recruitment will be done through pr esentations at gr oup functions, 
coalition meetings, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], word of mouth, flyers in mailboxes of senior housing facilities, 
presence at senior fairs, presence at health fairs, articles and ads in neighborhood and city -wide 
newspapers. More specifically , the following r ecruitment strategies will be employed, before any 
screening or testing takes place:  
- Study flyers and permission to contact [CONTACT_142587]  
- Study flyers will be made available for  volunteers to pi[INVESTIGATOR_142574]  
- Permission to contact [CONTACT_142588], and participants can put them in a 
sealed envelope for study staff to retrieve from the senior cen ter 
BAILA 
Version # 38; 6/6/[ADDRESS_162012] participants , potential participants will be screened using the 
document titled, “Introduction and  Screening Script” which includes the MMSE and EASY.   
After participants are deemed eligible they will be scheduled for a baseline assessment.  
 
 
 e. Description of Procedures  
• There are several ways potential volunteers can consent to b e screened: Learn ab out the 
study in person from a research staff member and be immediately screened; Learn about 
the study and sign a form agreeing to be called by a research member at a later time for 
screening; Learn about the study in another way and c all our office to be  screened.   
 
• Persons who respond to recruitment materials or face -to-face meetings will be asked for 
consent to be screened for eligibility. After participants are deemed eligible they will be 
scheduled for a baseline assessment, and t hey will be randomly  assigned to the dance 
treatment or to the health education control group using Study360 software .  
 
• Individuals who are not eligible for the study will be thanked for their time.  
 
• Testings will take place at Baseline, 4 -months (posttes ting), and 8 -months (end of 
maintenance intervention) at the Clinical Research Center (CRC) , participant’s home ,  
Senior Center , and our Lab Building  at UIC ; and the  intervention will take place at 
various senior centers, community centers, par ks, etc..  Data collection research staff will 
not be told to which experimental group (BAILAMOS  or control) participants are in. Participants will be offered a ride from FlashCab taxi service (using an established 
contract of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_142575]), which will transport participants fro m their homes to 
the UIC CRC and vice versa.  
 
• At the testing sessions a staff member will explain the study and read the Informed 
Consent form aloud to the participant. After participants agree to participate, they will sign the Informed Consent. All measu res are available in Spanish or English.  
 
BAILA 
Version # 38; 6/6/2016  Pa ge 7 of 15 
 • All participants will then have their heart rate, blood pressure, height and weight taken. 
Participants will then complete interviewer -administered questionnaires and tests of 
physic al functioning (balance, mobility, and strength).  
 
• Accelerometers. At testing they will be given an accelerometer to wear for one week and 
return to study staff. At the last class participants will be given an accelerometer to wear 
for one week. Participants will return for assessment a nd to return accelerometers.  
 
• Intervention. The BAILAMOS© program. BAILAMOS© includes a 4-month, twice -
weekly dance program. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238] a professional dance instructor co-developed an 
extensive BAILAMOS© Dance Manual and class-by -class schedule. A 4 -month 
maintenance intervention including the twice -weekly dance program will be completed.  
 
• Sedentary older Latinos randomly assigned to the health education control group will participate in classes developed for older adults and  offered by [CONTACT_142589] [ADDRESS_162013] as the treatment group.  
 
• If participants are put   into the health education program, they will be offered a short, 4-
session dance program during the  additional 4 -month period, consisting of one class for 
each of the four styles of dance taught in the larger BAILAMOS© dance program.  
 
• For the dance group and the health education group, separate lotteries will occur during  
the initial 4 -month program and the follow -up 4 -month maintenance program. All 
participants who meet criter ia of having attended 75% of classes over each 4 -week period 
are eligible for the lottery. One lottery will happen every four weeks (four lotteries total 
for the initial 4 -month pr ogram and four lotteries for the follow -up 4 -month maintenance 
program), and two participants from the dance group will win $50 and two participants 
from the health education group will win $[ADDRESS_162014] an equal chance of winning,  and the odds of winning are dependent 
upon the number of participants who meet lottery eligibility criteria (for example, if [ADDRESS_162015] a 1/10 or 10% chance of winning) . For each lottery, if 
you are e ligible, your name [CONTACT_142600] a hat; the winner will be randomly drawn 
from the hat; your name [CONTACT_142601]; and the names will be 
destroyed immediately after the lottery occurs.  
 
• At 4-months pos t-intervention , and at 8 -months,  testing will occur. Questionnaires and 
tests will be administered in the same order as baseline  and 4-month testing.   
• After the PRE-intervention testing (baseline/month 0) a $10 cash gift will be provided, 
and participants will be asked to w ear an accelerometer for 7 days. When that 
accelerometer is returned, participants will receive another $10 cash gift.  
BAILA 
Version # 38; 6/6 /2016  Pa ge 8 of 15 
 • After the initial [ADDRESS_162016]-intervention testing 
(month 4), a  $10 cash gift will be provided,  and participants will be asked to wear an 
accelerometer for 7 days. When that accelerometer is returned, participants will receive 
another $10 cash gift.  
• After the maintenance 4 -month program for dancers, testing will occur  for both 
participants from the dance group and the health education group. At this month 8 testing , a $10 cash gift will be provided, and participants will be asked to wear an accelerometer for 7 days. When that accelerometer is returned, participants wil l receive another $10 
cash gift.   Thus, a total of $60 is possible.  
 
• Through Amendment  # 16, we would like to allow research participants in the 
maintenance component of the program to invite 1 or 2 family member(s) or friend(s) to come dance with them. B oth of the sites which are in th e maintenance phase of the 
program are struggling with attendance adherence.   The person our participant invites  will not be involved with any of the study procedures, 
such as:  
• No visits to the University of Illinois at C hicago for questionnaires (No da ta 
collected on them)  
• No need to wear accelerometer  
• Not eligible for lotteries  
• Not eligible for compensation  
 In addition, in order to attend a dance session, the person will need to:  
• Be 55 years or older  
•           Be able to speak English and/or  Spanish 
• Not be in the Health Education group of the study   
• Be physically able to dance (no assistive devices permitted like canes, walkers, or 
wheelchairs)  
• Sign a one -time waiver  
• Sign-in at each class attended  
 
The investigator may stop a person from participating in the dance sessions of the 
maintenance program if the person is at risk of injury, or if he/she is disruptive or 
inappropriate during any session.  
 
 
Emergency Procedures for Study Participant  
In the event of an emergency, staff respond s quickly and calmly.  
All emergencies are documented in the participant’s file and if the project coordinator is 
not onsite, she is notified immediately by [CONTACT_142590] (Participant Leader). 
The emergency is brought to the attention of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_142576], so he is aware of the problem and can discuss how to prevent future emergencies. In addition, the Project Coordinator files an adverse report form with IRB 
BAILA 
Version # 38; 6/6 /2016  Pa ge 9 of 15 
 (Institutional Review B oard Office), stating nature of incident, extent of injury and 
reports participant injured by [CONTACT_142591].  
 
 
Medical Emergencies for Study Participant  
In the event of a medical emergency, staff responds quickly and calmly. The Project 
Coordinator is  notified of the emergency by [CONTACT_142590] (Study Participant), 
Project Coordinator notifies Principal Investigator. If a serious medical emergency arises, the Indigenous Leader (Study Participant) calls 911 and notifies participant’s emergency contact. In addition, the Project Coordinator files an adverse report form with IRB 
(Institutional Review Board Office), stating nature of incident, extent of injury and 
reports participant injured by [CONTACT_142591].  
 
 
Emergency Procedures for “Invitees” : 
In the event of an emergency, “Invitees” will follow the site protocol. The Indigenous Leader (Study Participant) responds quickly and calmly, following the site protocol for emergencies. The emergency is brought to the attention of the Project Coordinat or. 
Project Coordinator notifies  the Principal Investigator, so he is aware of the problem and 
can discuss how to prevent future emergencies.   
Medical Emergencies for “Invitees” 
In the event of a medical emergency, Indigenous Leader (Study Participant) responds 
quickly and calmly, following site protocol, which is to call 911. Indigenous Leader 
(Study Participant) notifies Project Coordinator and Principal Investigator.   Below are the medical emergency procedures for our current sites:  
 
• West Town Satellite Senior Center: Notify Senior Center Coordinator, who will then 
make Security aware of situation, and if necessary, Security will call 911 and make an 
incident report.  
 
• Pi[INVESTIGATOR_142577]: Call [ADDRESS_162017]/family member 
on record, center Coordinator will  file incident report.  
 
• Kelvyn Park Satellite Senior Center: Call [ADDRESS_162018]/family member on record, center Coordinator will file incident report  
 
Under Amendment #18, we  added  a short survey for Senior Center directors to be 
collect ed at 1 -month and 6-months after the Maintenance program ends to see if people 
are still dancing, and to get Directors’ thoughts, feelings, and perceptions of the 
program's sustainability.  
 
Under Amendment #21, we propose  to audiotape the Senior Center Dir ector ’s responses 
to our Questionnaire  (previously approved under Amendment #18) . This will allow us to 
BAILA 
Version # 38; 6/6 /[ADDRESS_162019] their response more accurately . These recordings will be transcribed within 6 
months of being collected; and will  be destroyed once the d ata has been published. 
To maintain confidentiality, Directors will be assigned an identification number ( ID). 
Only the ID will appear on the questionnaire. There will be no identifying information on 
the questionnaire. The ID and participant's name [CONTACT_142602] o n a password protected 
computer.  
The hardcopy Informed Consent documents will be kept in a locked drawer in [CONTACT_142605]' Lab (room 611, Applied Health Sciences Building). The hardcopy questionnaire will be kept separately i n the PI's lab. The Director's r esponse files and 
transcripts will be kept on a password-locked computer in [CONTACT_142606]' lab and on the secured College server.  Only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_142578]. Key Research Personnel will need access to the files in order to analyze data. All access to data will be granted by [CONTACT_978], [CONTACT_142606]. Hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_142579] a locked storage room of [CONTACT_142606]' lab for 5 years after the completion of the study. At that time all data will be destroyed.  
Inclusion criteria for Senior Center Directors: to oversee daily operations of senior center 
where our program takes place.  Exclusion: not oversee or coordinate daily operations of 
Senior Center.  
Under Amendment# 34

 f. Statistical Methods  
Aim 1. Hypothesis : Lifestyle PA (self -reported and accelerometer -assessed) will be significantly 
higher in the BAILAMOS© group at 4 and 8 months compared to the control group.  
The proposed study use s a between -groups design with two groups and individual covariates. 
Initially, descriptive statistics will be obtained (e.g., for continuous variables we will examine 
means and standard deviations) and we will screen for wild codes (e.g., extreme values as the 
result of typos in data entry).  
Using t -tests and chi -square tests, we will examine all baseline outcomes and covariates to 
determine whether randomization has produced equivalent groups. Variables exhibiting 
differences will be added as covariates to analyses. Transformations to achieve normality will be 
applied as needed; and residuals from analysis will be examined to detect multivariate outliers. Data will be examined for differ ential dropout but dropout is expected to be missing at random 
(MAR) and will thus not be imputed unless necessary.  
Analysis will be carried out using standard mixed model analysis of variance and covariance 
using the SAS program (i.e., PROC MIXED),  contr olling for antecedent factors measured at 
BAILA 
Version # 38; 6/6 /[ADDRESS_162021] whether there is greater improvement in self -reported 
and accelerometer -assessed lifestyle PA at 4 and 8 months in the treatment group compared to 
the control group.  
Aim 2. Hypothesis 2a : Self -efficacy for PA, Balance, and Gait will  be significantly higher in the 
BAILAMOS© group at [ADDRESS_162022] whether there is greater improvement in self -efficacy at 4 and 8 
months in the treatment group compared to the control group.  
Aim 2. Hypothesis 2a1: Self -efficacy for PA, Balance, and Gait will mediate the effect of the 
BAILAMOS© program on lifestyle PA and health outcomes.  
In connection with Aim 2, Hypothesis 2a, we will conduct mediation analysis following 
testing procedures recommen ded by [CONTACT_38722].  We will examine whether self -efficacy is a 
necessar y intervening variable to produce the PA and health outcome differences. We will use 
methods provided in the M -Plus statistical package, which offers special facilities for estimating 
standard errors of mediation terms.  
Aim 2. Hypothesis 2b: Physical function, cognitive function, and self -reported functional 
limitations and disability scores will be significantly better in the BAILAMOS© group at [ADDRESS_162023] 
whether there is greater improvement in physical function, cognitive function, and self -reported 
functional limitations and disability scores at 4 and 8 months in the  treatment group compared to 
the control group.  
  g. Safety Monitorin g and Assessment  
Risks:  
The risk level of the intervention is minimal. For the proposed study there is the potential that undocumented Latinos will want to participate and will be concerned about anonymity and confidentiality in participating.   
There is a  small possibility that the older adults could injure themselves during the testing or the 
dance program.  
 Possible risks associated with physical injury that could occur during the danc e intervention 
include those that one would experience with any physi cal activity, including (1) strains, sprains, 
muscle soreness, aggravation of arthritic conditions, etc. (2) slippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/trippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/falling; (3) bumpi[INVESTIGATOR_142580]; (4) a very sl im chance that cardiac irregularities can occur. 
This is very rare an d the benefits of exercise are known to outweigh the risks. Serious physical 
injury or severe pain is considered unlikely. In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_142581]© dance program, we had [ADDRESS_162024] two times per week. We experienced no serious injuries or falls.  
 
The following provides steps that we will take to (1) address the potential for risks, and (2) 
handle injuries should they occur.  
 
BAILA 
Version # 38; 6/6/2016  Pa ge 13 of 15 
 1) Addressing the potential for risks  
a. All participants will be free of medical conditions (e.g., uncontrolled diabetes) requiring 
higher levels of supervision, and will not have had hip or knee replacement in the last 6 months.  
b. Prior to participation, each participant will complete the Exercise Assessment and 
Screening for You (EASY), developed and successfully used by [CONTACT_142592], PhD, FAAN, 
for risk assessment during the screening. Participants with new risks based on EASY items will 
be required to discuss these risks with their healthcare provider and obtain medical approval 
before participating in the trial.  
c. During warm -up and cool -down participants will be advised to NOT attempt an 
activity/stretch/maneuver that they do not feel com fortable performing.  
d. The warm -up and cool -down sessions will decre ase the risk of straining a muscle.  
e. During discussion sessions and throughout the intervention participants will be educated 
on risks of physical activity and methods to minimize risks  (e.g., start low and go slow) and will 
receive safety tips and infor mation on warning signs and symptoms.  
f. To reduce and/or prevent any physical harm or injury, BAILAMOS© has been designed 
to present the easiest, least complicated dance styles first, fo llowed by [CONTACT_142593].  
g.  Participants will be advised on what clothing and shoes should/should not be worn.   
h. Participants will be encouraged to sit and/or take a break whenever they feel it is 
necessary.  
i. There will be adequate spacing between participants when dancing, decreasing the risk of 
slippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/trippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/falling or bumpi[INVESTIGATOR_142580].  
j. Emergency contact [CONTACT_142594], and emergency 
protocol will be posted on the walls of the study sites.  
k. We will employ dance leaders who have experience working with older adults.  
l. The surface area used for the dance classes will be a large, well -lit, unobstructed space 
that is not carpeted to reduce the risk of slippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/trippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/falling or bumpi[INVESTIGATOR_142582].  
 
2) Handling injuries, should the y occur  
a. All personnel who assist with instruction and/or testing will be CPR and First Aid 
certified, will have a comprehensive first -aid kit on -site, and all will be familiar with eme rgency 
protocol procedures of the study sites.  
b. Emergency contact i nformation will be collected at baseline. Should an injury or any 
other adverse event occur, we will contact [CONTACT_142595], followed 
by [CONTACT_142596], and the program officer assigned to this grant.  
c. We will tell participants tha t should they become injured due to dancing, they should 
notify the dance leader and/or research assistants in attendance and to consult their physician if 
necessary.  
d. If a participant injures him/herself and/or falls, we will assess and treat with first aid. 
e. If there are medical facilities and/or medical personnel available at the research site, we 
will inform them and request assistance, and also follow the stated protocols and proc edures of 
the site. For those sites without medical facilities, we will follow the stated protocols and 
procedures of the site.  
f. If needed, we will arrange for transport to the emergency room.

 Adverse events will be tracked and  categorized as "serious" (for example illness requiring 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or events deemed life -threatening) or “minor” adverse events. Serious events will 
be reported to the IRB immediately, whereas minor adverse events will be documented in the 
annual summary sent to the IRB.   
 
h. Data management  
To maintain confidentiality, all participants will be assigned an identification number (ID). Only 
the ID appears on the questionnaire  and other study documents . There is no identifying 
information on the questionnaire. The ID and par ticipant's name [CONTACT_142603] a password 
protected computer.  
 
Screening, t racking of participants, etc. will be done using Study360 software described in detail 
in the Initial Review Application. In short, Study 360™ (Almedtrac, Inc.) is a multi-component, 
web accessible software system designed to reduce management burden, incr ease efficiency and 
improve visibility of clinical trials. It is a highly secure application that uses a [ADDRESS_162025] party certificate authority encryption mechanism. Data a re maintained and stored in an 
Oracle 10g RDBMS running in a secure envi ronment on a Dell PowerEdge server running 
Windows Server 2003 in Entity-Attribute -Value (EAV) format. Data in the Oracle database are 
maintained in original and unedited format and the research team has the ability to connect to a 
view that is custom -desi gned for the project for the purpose of downloading a snapshot of the 
data into SPSS via an ODBC connection.  
 
The hardcopy Informed Consent documents will be kept in a locked drawer in [CONTACT_142606]' Lab 
(room 611 or 516, Applied Health Sciences Building). Q uestionnaires will be administered and 
answers recorded electronically using Pendragon software on iPads. The electronic data collected 
using iPads will be kept on a password-locked computer in [CONTACT_142606]' lab and on two secured 
College of Applied Health Sciences (AHS) servers: (1) Information collected on the iPads will be synced with a designated secured server, Host: AHS -KN-PENDRAG.ad.uic.edu, Security 
Measures: Access restricted by  [CONTACT_142597]; (2) Data will be backed up on the department 
virtual server hosted by [CONTACT_142598] "ahs -kn-nas." The research data is stored on a share called 
"MarquezLab." Authorization, that is Access to the share is controlled via an Active Directory group.  Only members of the group can access this directory. Authenticat ion is handled by

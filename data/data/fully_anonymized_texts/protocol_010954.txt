Residual Newborn Specimen 
Research  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
APPROVAL DATE: 3/6/2018  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_633843]  
3/6/[ADDRESS_846423] a “run -in” of the EICI in each  of the participating ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_66386] [ADDRESS_846424] a follow up interview with all of these participants.  
 
Inclusion and Exclusion Criterion  
 
Inclusion criteria for the intervention  include: adult ( > 18 years) English  speaking women who 
are already being approached for participation in the BioTrust.    
 
Exclusion criteria include mothers of infants that are in the NICU  and any situation adoption or 
legal guardianship is unknown  at the time of birth . 
 
Recruitment  
Our research procedures are designed to mirror the current practice at the individual hospoitals 
as much as possible. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], nurses discuss the BioTrust inf ormational brochure shortly after 
moving into the Mother & Baby [CONTACT_633845]. Once the baby [CONTACT_832] [ADDRESS_846425] consent at that time.    
 
Our approach will use a full time research assistant (RA) at each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. All potential 
participants will receive the brochure as part of standard practice during their welcome to the Mother & Baby [CONTACT_563546]. At some point after admission to the Unit , the RA will approach the 
patient, briefly describe the study and content of data collected, and seek verbal consent for participation in the study. If they consent, the RA will activate the study -provided electronic 
tablet to see the study group assignment; study staff and healthcare providers will be blind to 
the study group assignment until this point. P articipants  will be randomized into the video 
intervention group (Group A), interactive intervention group (Group B), or standard of care 
group (Group C). The patient will then complete the intervention (Groups A and B) or continue 
the BioTrust discussion with the nu rse (Group C).  
 
Intervention  Groups A and B  
Following randomization, participants in Groups A or B will be given the  electronic table t with 
the intervention loaded on the screen  and  provided with instructions . In order to allow 
particpants as much time as necessary to explore the app, the RA will leave the room while the patient is working on the tablet and return within an hour  to pi[INVESTIGATOR_633844] t.  Participants in 
Group A will be asked to watch a [ADDRESS_846426] the tablet and provide the 
participant with a $[ADDRESS_846427] to Amazon. The n ext day, the Nursery Tech  will  visit the 
patient’s room to gather NBS bloodspots and consent for the BioTrust, following the  standard 
consent process .  
 
 
Control Group C  
 
Participan ts who are randomized to Group C  will complete the questionnaires immediately 
following the BioTrust discussion with the nurse. The RA will stay in the room while the 
surveys are being completed then provide the participant with a $[ADDRESS_846428] to Amazon . The 
next day, the Nursery Tech will vi sit the patient’s room to gather NBS bloodspots and consent 
for the BioTrust, following the standard consent process . The RA will review collected consent 
cards to document the patient’s choice to consent or deny.  
 
Survey Tools  
All participating women wil l complete a survey 1) immediately following the 
intervention/control on the electronic tablet and 2) by [CONTACT_756] 2 -4 weeks follow up.  
Participants will receive an additional $[ADDRESS_846429] to Amazon after the follow -up survey. 
Outcome measures include:  
 knowledge of the elements of consent and key aspects of the biobank  
 decisional conflict  
 satisfaction with the consent process and attitudes toward the clinical program the 
samples were collected for and research  with these samples  
 rates of parental permis sion 
We will also collect demographic information on the participants and contact [CONTACT_633846] [ADDRESS_846430] (R01 HD058854).  
 
Analysis Plan  
Summary statistics for baseline demographics (age, ethnicity, race, income, etc.) will be 
calculated and reported for each intervention group (App or Video) versus Control. We will 
utilize multilevel generalized mixed modeling (via SPSS and R) under an intent -to-treat (ITT) 
approach to compare primary, secondary outcomes, and exploratory outcomes.  
 
Hypothesis Testing: To evaluate the fixed effect of  the two different groups upon knowledge 
we will utilize a single level model that includes the fixed effect of group (G).    
 
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖=[𝛾𝛾0+𝛾𝛾1𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖]+[𝜁𝜁𝑖𝑖+𝜖𝜖𝑖𝑖] 
 
where Y is the composite score for knowledge. G  is an indicator for the different groups (App 
or Video , Control). We will set alpha = 0.05. The two group model reduces to a [ADDRESS_846431] 
approach.

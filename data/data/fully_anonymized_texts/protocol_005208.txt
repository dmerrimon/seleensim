LIBERATE-LIposomal Bupi[INVESTIGATOR_714625]:
Pain control after orthopedic surgery can be challenging, especially in light of the goals of shortened 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_714626]-of-stay, reduced opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], and increased patient satisfaction. With the 
estimated incidence of new persistent opi[INVESTIGATOR_443435] 6.5% after surgery in the U.S. 1, reducing opi[INVESTIGATOR_17023] (and therefore the potential for addiction) has become a major objective in today’s 
healthcare environment. A multimodal analgesic approach that includes non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_714627] a means to accomplish 
this goal. Previous studies have demonstrated that the addition of adjuncts, such as dexamethasone, to 
local anesthetics can prolong peripheral nerve blockade to greater than 24 hours postoperatively 2–4, 5 . It 
has also been shown that adding non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, and 
gabapentin to pain control regimens in addition to peripheral nerve blockade decreases opi[INVESTIGATOR_714628].6
In 2011, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (ExparelⓇ), a 
sustained release formulation of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], for surgical site infiltration. Liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_714629] [ADDRESS_973424] on pain relief 
and opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556]. The majority of these studies focus on an intraoperative infiltrative technique by 
[CONTACT_714684] a lack of a statistical difference between the two 8;9;10. There are limited studies demonstrating its 
superiority over standard local anesthetics, like bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], in perineural blocks. 8,9,11–13 Only one study 
thus far has examined the use of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_714630], 12 but it 
was not until April 2018 that liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_714631]-approved for use in interscalene peripheral 
nerve blockade. Given the limited amount of evidence comparing liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_714632], it is unclear whether liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_714633] (as evidenced by [CONTACT_714685][INVESTIGATOR_2480]) or can reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_714634].
In this study, we are seeking to compare our standard approach of a single injection interscalene brachial 
plexus blockade using bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 20 mL 0.5%, 5 mg dexamethasone, and 5 mcg epi[INVESTIGATOR_714635] a single injection interscalene brachial plexus blockade using liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_714636] 0.5%. The primary endpoint of the study is the total amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_714637] (MMEs) by [CONTACT_714686] 0 through 3 (PODs #0-3) 
for primary total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) patients, including anatomic and reverse TSA.
Purpose/Aim:
We are seeking to evaluate the effect of liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (10ml liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 133 mg 
mixed with 10 mL of 0.5% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_291200] a total volume of 20 ml of injectate) in a single injection 
interscalene brachial plexus blockade, as compared to our standard approach single injection interscalene 
brachial plexus blockade using bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.5% + 5 mg dexamethasone + 5 mcg epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (20 mL 
volume of injectate).

Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that using liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_714641] a 
reduced total opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556] (in MMEs) during postoperative days 0 through 3, as well as increased 
duration of blockade (represented by [CONTACT_714688]).
Study Design:
This will be a single-center, prospective, randomized controlled cross-sectional study comparing the total 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_714642] 0 through 3 in two groups of patients undergoing primary 
TSA, both anatomic and reverse. The individuals collecting data will be blinded to the patient’s 
randomization group. Due to the differences in appearance of the medications used, blinding of the 
individual performing the procedure will not be possible as the anesthesiologist will see the medication 
when assessing for intravascular needle placement. IRB approval was obtained.

- Block failure, as defined by a lack of sensory and motor blockade over incisional areas/shoulder
- Loss to follow-up after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_714644]/Methods:
The surgeon’s medical executive assistant will notify the research team when a total shoulder 
arthroplasty surgery is booked with the surgeon. During the surgeons’ preoperative visit with the 
potential subject, the surgeon will explain the patient potentially will be approached during their 
PREPARE visit for this study. The research team will screen the potential research subject, and patients 
will be approached and consented for the study in the preoperative PREPARE clinic by a member of the 
research team, with an attending anesthesiologist or regional anesthesia fellow on the acute pain service 
immediately available to answer any questions regarding the study (see consent form).
Details of the procedure are as follows: Prior to any procedure, the patients are checked into the 
preoperative holding area (POHA), surgical consent is reviewed, and the patient’s operative site is marked.
A preoperative assessment of the patient’s motor and sensory function of the operative extremity
will be performed to establish a baseline to compare to postoperative function. Motor function will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_714690] 18. 
Sensory function will be assessed on the shoulder by [CONTACT_714691] a pin prick on the shoulder in 
the axillary nerve distribution using the end of a paperclip. The sensory function will be measured using a 
4-point scale (0-3) with 0 = no sensation, 1 = sensation to pressure only, 2 = paresthesia, and 3 = full 
sensation. A peripheral intravenous catheter is inserted and standard monitors, including pulse oximetry, 
blood pressure monitoring every 5 minutes, and 3-lead EKG are applied. Nasal cannula oxygen at 2L/min 
is administered. All patients receive mild sedation with midazolam or propofol prior to peripheral nerve 
blockade. Patients are positioned in a 45-degree semi-upright position with the head turned to the 
contralateral side of surgical site.
Single injection interscalene brachial plexus blockade is performed by [CONTACT_127958] [ADDRESS_973428] supervision of 6 attending regional 
anesthesiologists. A high-frequency linear ultrasound transducer is used to locate the brachial plexus at 
the level of the nerve roots in the neck (interscalene approach). Ultrasound guidance is utilized to monitor 
the distribution of local anesthetic deposited via a 22G short bevel needle using an in-plane approach. In 
the control group, the local anesthetic solution consists of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.5% + 5 mg preservative-free 
dexamethasone + 5 mcg epi[INVESTIGATOR_107541] a total of 20 mL volume deposited perineurally. The liposomal 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_714645] a total of 133 mg (10 mL) liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] + 10 mL 0.5% 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] (to account for early block coverage) for a total of [ADDRESS_973429] to the occurrence of any paresthesias during block placement for safety purposes. Due to the 
difference in physical appearance of the study and control medications, the syringe of medication for 
injection will be held under an opaque towel during the block procedure so the patient remains blinded.

should elapse between block placement and the pre-induction assessment of motor and sensory function.
The patients will be taken to the operating room (OR) for their primary TSA procedures, as performed by 
a specialty-trained shoulder surgeon. A standardized multimodal analgesic regimen for all patients will be 
followed, including preoperative oral acetaminophen [ADDRESS_973431] (EMR). Intraoperatively, induction of general anesthesia will be 
achieved using propofol 1-2 mg/kg, fentanyl 1-3mcg/kg, and lidocaine 0.5-1 mg/kg followed by 
[CONTACT_714692] 0.5-1 mg/kg prior to securing the trachea with endotracheal tube. IV 
fentanyl will be given periodically during the intraoperative course as needed for pain control. IV 
decadron will not be given for prophylaxis of postoperative nausea and vomiting, alternative medication 
will be utilized as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_24694]. Medications administered 
intraoperatively will be evaluated via query of electronic medical record (EMR). Postoperative analgesia 
in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) will consist of intravenous hydromorphone and/or fentanyl as 
needed. Medications administered in the PACU will be evaluated via query of electronic medical record 
(EMR).Postoperative analgesia after PACU discharge and while on the floor will consist of of 
scheduled acetaminophen, scheduled NSAID (celecoxib or ibuprofen), and as-needed opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536] 
(oxycodone, hydromorphone, or tramadol depending on patient requirements and tolerances).
All patients will be receive an in-person evaluation at the time of post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) 
discharge and on the morning of POD #1 using questionnaires modified from the validated Modified 
Brief Pain Inventory 19 (see attached questionnaires). Patients will receive a sensory and motor exam on 
the operative side in the PACU and on POD#[ADDRESS_973432] (EMR) system. Most patients are 
discharged home in the afternoon of POD #1. They will be discharged home on the standard of care 
pain regimen, which is similar to their in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_714646].
On POD #2, POD #4 and POD #60, if the patients have been discharged, they will be called via telephone 
and asked questions from a questionnaire regarding overall pain control and the amount of pain 
medications consumed each day. (See the following Questionnaires). Prior to discharge, the patients will 
be given and educated on using a medication diary (see medication diary), by a member of the research 
team, which they will mail back using an addressed, stamped envelope. On the medication diary, patients 
will record the number of opi[INVESTIGATOR_714647]#1-3. The medication diary will also be used for 
the patients to record their maximum, minimum, and average pain scores for each day using a 0 to 10 
scale. Patients will be asked to read back the information from this diary during phone calls on POD #2 
and POD #4. Patients will be asked the time that they first noticed their block wearing off. During the 
POD #4 phone call, patients are reminded to return their medication diary by [CONTACT_714693]. In the event that a patient’s medication diary is not received, a research team member will 
attempt to contact [CONTACT_714694]. 
Patients will be provided with a 24/[ADDRESS_973433] to their peripheral nerve blockade.

To assess for PONS, at the time of postoperative follow-up with the patient’s orthopedic surgeon, the  patient 
will be asked by [CONTACT_714695], tingling, or paresthesias of their 
operative extremity. The patients will also be asked about any of these symptoms during the phone calls in the first 
3 postoperative days, as well as on the POD #60 questionnaire. If the patient reports these symptoms, the patients 
will be asked to describe the location, severity, and type of sensory changes they are experiencing as well as any 
aggravating or alleviating factors.
Baseline demographic data and comorbidities for participants in each group will be collected using the 
EMR system, including: gender, age, body mass index (BMI), ASA class, home medications, and history 
of hypertension (HTN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], diabetes, 
rheumatoid arthritis, and chronic steroid use. Additionally, the EMR will be used to collect information 
on duration of surgery (min), duration of time to perform the block (min), length of PACU stay (min), 
time to discharge home (hrs), time to first dose of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536] (hrs), incidence of postoperative 
nausea and vomiting (as defined as receiving one or more antiemetic medications postoperatively in non- 
prophylactic administration) and incidence of complications from peripheral nerve blockade.
Randomization/Blinding:
Randomization will be performed using https://www.randomizer.org in 1:[ADDRESS_973434](s) performing the nerve 
block will not be blinded. The individuals collecting study data as well as the patient will be blinded to the 
randomizationassignment.
Risks/Benefits to the Patient:
Patients will be randomized to receiving a single interscalene injection using either (1) bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.5%
+ adjuncts or (2) liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] + bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.5%. Interscalene single shot peripheral nerve 
blockade is currently part of the standard of care for pain control in the total shoulder arthroplasty 
population at our institution.
Potential Risks:
Potential risks to the patients can be found on the provided consent form. Risks associated with peripheral 
nerve blockade are variable and often secondary to equipment, techniques, and anatomic location.
General risks of peripheral nerve blockade include risk of block failure, bleeding/hematoma formation at 
the site of needle entry, infection, potential allergic reaction to local anesthetic solution, including its 
liposomal, dexamethasone, or stabilization additives, intravascular injection leading to local anesthetic 
systemic toxicity (LAST), and transient or permanent neuropathy.20–23 With regards to the interscalene 
location of the injection, additional risks include the potential for hoarseness,24 dyspnea, 2526 respi[INVESTIGATOR_714648], 22 10,22,27,28 as well as rare case 
reports of inadvertent injection into the epi[INVESTIGATOR_714649]29;30. Additionally, there has also 
been documented hemodynamic instability in patients receiving interscalene blocks who are then in the 
sitting position during surgery31, 32, 33. Patients will be informed of these risks during the consent process.

patient’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_714651]/regional anesthesia team via a 24/7 paging 
system, which will result in prompt in-person evaluation and management. Adverse events include, but 
are not limited to, bleeding/hematoma at site of needle entry, allergic reaction to local anesthetic 
medication, infection at site of needle entry, transient (or rarely permanent) neurological dysfunction 
including dysesthesia or paresthesia, hemodynamic instability both intraoperatively and postoperatively, 
hoarseness, phrenic nerve palsy, dyspnea, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], or potential inadvertent injection into 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_714652].
Adverse events or patient concerns that occur up to [ADDRESS_973436]-discharge will be communicated to the 
on-call physician via the 24/7 pager for the acute pain service. This will prompt a return phone call to the 
patient to discuss the concern. If there is a need for urgent in-person patient evaluation, the patient will be 
instructed to come to the emergency department where they will be evaluated by [CONTACT_714697]-call physician

The risks associated with the current study are deemed greater than minimal for the following reasons:
1. We do not view the risks associated with the interscalene brachial plexus nerve block procedure 
as minimal risk.
2. We do not view the risks of sedation for peripheral nerve block procedure as minimal risk.
3. We do not view the risks associated with peripheral nerve block procedure as minimal risk. 
Although we have assessed the proposed study as one of greater than minimal risk, the potential exists for 
anticipated and/or unanticipated adverse events, serious or otherwise, to occur since it is not possible to 
predict with certainty the absolute risk in any given individual or in advance of first-hand experience with 
the proposed study methods. Therefore, we provide a plan for monitoring the data and safety of the 
proposed study as follows:
Attribution of Adverse Events:
Adverse events will be monitored for each subject participating in the study and attributed to the study 
procedures / design by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_85048]:
a.Definite: Adverse event is clearly related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s)
b.Probable: Adverse event is likely related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s)
c.Possible: Adverse event may be related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s)
d.Unlikely: Adverse event is likely not to be related to the investigational 
procedures(s)/agent(s)
e.Unrelated: Adverse event is clearly not related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s)
Plan for Grading Adverse Events:
The following scale will be used in grading the severity of adverse events noted during the study:
1. Mild adverse event
2. Moderate adverseevent
3. Severe adverse event
Plan for Determining Seriousness of Adverse Events:
In addition to grading the adverse event, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_22414] a Serious Adverse Event (SAE). An adverse event is considered serious if it results in any of 
the followingoutcomes:
1. Death
2. A life-threatening experience in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
3. A persistent or significant disability or incapacity
4. A congenital anomaly or birth defect
5. Any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in this definition
An adverse event may be graded as severe but still not meet the criteria for a Serious Adverse Event. 
Similarly, an adverse event may be graded as moderate but still meet the criteria for an SAE. It is

important for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_22415] “seriousness” when determining 
whether reporting to the IRB is necessary.
Plan for reporting unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others (including adverse 
events) to the IRB:
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_22416]: 
Any incident, experience or outcome that meets ALL 3 of the following criteria:
1. Is unexpected (in terms of nature, specificity, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved protocol and 
informed consent document and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; 
AND
2. Is related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156]); AND
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, legal, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]) may be medical or non- 
medical in nature, and include – but are not limited to – serious, unexpected, and related adverse events. 
Please note that adverse events are reportable to the IRB as UPI[INVESTIGATOR_22417] 3 criteria 
listed above.
These UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]/SAEs will be reported to the HHC IRB in accordance with HHC IRB Policy, using the 
appropriate forms found on the website. All related events involving risk but not meeting the prompt 
reporting requirements described in IRB Policywill be reported to the IRB in summary form at the time of 
continuing review. If appropriate, such summary may be a simple brief statement that events have 
occurred at the expected frequency and level of severity as previously documented.
Plan for reporting adverse events to co-investigators on the study, as appropriate the protocol’s 
research monitor(s), e.g., industrial sponsor, Protocol Review Committee (PRC), DSMBs, study 
sponsors, funding and regulatory agencies, and regulatory and decision-making bodies:
For the current study, the following individuals, funding, and/or regulatory agencies will be notified:
1.   All Co-Investigators listed on the protocol
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_48112] a review of all adverse events upon completion of every study 
subject. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_206497].
Data Use, Collection, Storage and Security:
Data collection and follow-up will be performed by [CONTACT_714698], research coordinators, 
assistants, and nurses. The physician(s) will only collect data for patients in which they did not participate 
in the nerve block placement in order to avoid bias. Data collection with regard to baseline demographics 
and surgical information, including type of surgery (anatomic vs reverse) and surgeon will occur via 
query of the EMR system. Patient pain scores and the amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_714654] (in

MMEs) will be obtained via in-person interview and query of the EMR system (during POD #0-1), via 
telephone call/questionnaire (POD #2, POD #4), and through the patient's mailed-in pain diary. If we are 
unable to reach the patient on the first phone call attempt, two additional attempts will be allowed in any 
given day. If the patient is not able to be reached on POD #4, up to 3 attempts will be made on POD #5 in 
order to complete the POD #4 questionnaire. Should the opi[INVESTIGATOR_714655], but the 
patient was able to read all of the data over the phone to us on POD #4 or #5, we will use the data they 
provided over the phone. Should the patient provide all of the data over the phone on POD #4 and then 
mail in the diary, we will default to the medication diary. If patients are unable to be reached via telephone 
during the data collection period (POD #1-5) but return by [CONTACT_2319] a completed opi[INVESTIGATOR_608094], the data
from the diary will be included in the data analysis. Should patients be lost to follow-up prior to 
collecting all of our data, these patients will not be included in the data analysis for our primary endpoint.
Data in one hard-copy format will be stored in a binder associated with each patient which will be kept in 
a double locked office with restricted access to only the individuals involved with data collection and 
analysis. After study conclusion, the binders will be kept in locked office for a period of 6 years. Data 
with all identifying patient information removed will be stored in the secure database REDcap. Access 
will be restricted to members of the research team involved in performing blocks, collecting data, and/or 
analyzing data and granted on a case-by-case basis by [CONTACT_978]. Additionally, IRB approval will be obtained 
and all key personnel (all individuals responsible for the design and conduct of this study) have completed

MMEs for the opi[INVESTIGATOR_714656].cms.gov (see citation below). The formula to calculate MME is as follows: 
Strength per Unit X (Number of Units/ Day) X MME conversion factor = MME/Day. The calculation 
will be repeated for each postoperative day during which data is collected.
Data and Statistical Analysis:
Demographic data amongst both groups will be analyzed after collection. Preliminary analysis will be 
done to determine the distribution of all continuous variables and the appropriateness of parametric data 
analyses. Descriptive data will be produced, mean and standard deviation for continuous variables where 
the assumption of normality ismet, median and interquartile range for continuous variables that are not 
normally distributed as well as ordinal data. Frequencies and proportions will be described for all 
categorical data. The primary analyses will compare the MME of opi[INVESTIGATOR_714657] 
(PODs #0-3) and the total for the four days. If distributions have been shown to be normal, an 
independent groups t-test will be run; alternatively a Wilcoxon Ranked Sum test will be done if there are 
distribution issues. Similar analyses will be done for reported pain and nausea scores. The time until first 
post-op analgesia, PACU and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_714658]. Complication data will be 
analyzed using chi square tests of proportion.  To the extent that the sample size allows, subgroup 
analyses will be done by [CONTACT_7995], by [CONTACT_422351] (anatomic vs reverse) and by [CONTACT_714699].

Power Analysis and Sample Size:
A power calculation was done based on the primary outcome of postoperative days 0-[ADDRESS_973437] size and 
our power calculation. Hannah et al reported large differences for the use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_714659] (comparisons of 112 mg to 37 mg morphine equivalents for 
day 2 and 20 mg versus 5 mg morphine equivalents for day 3). As they unfortunately do not report the 
related standard deviations, the effect sizes were ‘back calculated’ based on their sample size (groups of 
37 and 21) and reported p values (p = .001 and p = .002). This resulted in estimated effect sizes of .84 and
.74 for the two days. To achieve 80% power with an overall significance rate of .05, for an independent 
group t –test, sample sizes of [ADDRESS_973438] of communicating with 
these patients by [CONTACT_714700] (length of stay is usually one postoperative day), we 
still feel it is imperative to increase the proposed sample size to account for attrition. Assuming a loss-to- 
follow up rate of 25%, we propose a sample size of 40 patients per arm of the study with the total number 
of 80 participants.
An interim analysis will be done when approximately half (40) of the patients have completed surgery and 
at least POD4 medication data. The timing coincides with the departure of the one surgeon involved from 
HHC. If the continuation is approved and the interim analysis data indicate reason to continue the study, 
one or more different surgeons will be recruited to participate and the sample size adjusted . The interim 
analysis will provide basis for the power calculation to be redone with better empi[INVESTIGATOR_714660]. Finally, this timing also coincides with the first IRB 
renewal for the project. A full reporting of all adverse events is included in the continuation and will serve 
as the information for a safety review. These will be reviewed by [CONTACT_714701] 
(plan is for simultaneous review of the continuation and this modification).
The interim analysis will focus on the total post operative MMEs reported for days 1-4 for each day, (days 
0-4) and for the total use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_714661]. The time until the first administration of post-op 
analgesia will also be part of this analysis. As described above, each of the analyses will be done using 
either t-tests for independent groups or Wilcoxon Ranked Sum tests; we are anticipating skewed 
distributions for MME and time and thus expect the Wilcoxon statistic to be used. As is standard, a p 
value of .05 will be used to indicate statistical significance for all tests. In order to maintain this type one 
error rate over the entire study, the O’Brien- Fleming method for alpha spending will be used to determine 
the significance levels that will be used for the interim (α= .0054) and final (α= .0492) analyses.
If the continuation of the study is not approved by [CONTACT_1201], the interim analysis will not be completed as 
the study will be closed.

If the reported MMEs for the patients who received the liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_714662] (p<
.0054) than for patients receiving the standard of care, the study will be stopped as having demonstrated a 
significant difference.
If the difference in opi[INVESTIGATOR_714663]- 
investigators determine to be clinically meaningful and/or the redone power calculation indicates the need 
for a sample size that is so large as to not be feasible, the study will be stopped as futile.
The completion of the interim analysis in April, 2020 (detailed report appended) using a total of [ADDRESS_973439]- 
operative use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (total for days 1-4) as evidenced in the interim analysis data set. With a 
distribution that did not meet assumptions of normality for use of parametric analysis and included 
several outlier values, the calculation was done using group medians in place of group means and an 
estimate of pooled standard deviation derived from the interquartile range.[ADDRESS_973440] (the latter equal to .955 of the power of the 
former) and a 10% attrition rate, consistent with the interim data availability for days 1-4.36 The final 
calculation with these adjustments indicates the need for 45 patients in each group to achieve 80% power 
to detect differences equal to or greater than that found in the interim analyses with a significance level 
of .05. Due to the rate of attrition seen in the study during the accrual of the 45 subjects per group, the 
sample size is increased to 55 subjects per group to achieve 90 subjects with full data sets.
Clinical Significance:
We seek to examine whether liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_714664], reduces pain scores, or lengthens duration 
of analgesia as compared to the standard use of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_714665]. Should we find that liposomal 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_714666], it may contribute to a 
decreased risk of chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_9827]. Should liposomal bupi[INVESTIGATOR_714667], this also provides useful information regarding analgesic options for patients undergoing 
TSA. This study can also provide valuable information about the cost-benefit analysis of liposomal 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_714668].

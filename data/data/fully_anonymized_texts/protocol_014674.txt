STRATA2016 Clinical Study Protocol Incorporating Amendment [ADDRESS_914039] of care (SOC) for severe burns and other complex skin defects is surgical 
excision of a sheet of healthy skin from an uninjured site on the patient and transplantation of 
this autologous skin graft to the primary injury after excision of nonviable  tissue.  While this 
process can be effective in providing closure to the original wound, it is associated with 
significant morbidity due to the iatrogenic donor site wound created from surgical excision of 
the autograft tissue that is then transplanted to  the original wound.  These donor site wounds 
are extremely painful, are prone to scarring, dyspi[INVESTIGATOR_676092], are associated with 
a physiologic burden, and can convert to full -thickness wounds that must then be managed.  In 
addition, the amoun t of healthy skin available for autograft transplantation is frequently 
limiting in patients with large burns, necessitating sequential reharvesting of available donor 
sites.  As a result of these limitations, there is an urgent need for alternatives to th e practice of 
donor site harvest and autograft treatment of severe burns and other complex skin defects.  
The STRATA2016 phase III study is designed to evaluate whether treatment with StrataGraft 
skin tissue can promote the healing of complex skin defects due to thermal burns that  contain  
intact  dermal  elements  and for which surgical  excision  and autografts are indicated . 
StrataGraft skin tissue is an off -the-shelf, biologically active human skin substitute which is 
anticipated to provide immediate wound c overage, aid in wound bed conditioning, and 
promote autologous tissue regeneration and durable wound closure while reducing the amount 
of donor tissue harvested.  It is anticipated that StrataGraft skin tissue will remain in the wound 
long enough to promot e autologous tissue regeneration and be replaced over time by [CONTACT_1560]’s own cells rather than permanently engrafting.   
Stratatech, A Mallinckr odt Company  
STRATA2016 Clinical Study Protocol Incorporating Amendment [ADDRESS_914040] -in-human, dose escalation trial evaluating the 
safety of a single application of Strat aGraft skin tissue in subjects with full -thickness complex 
skin defects of 5 to 73% total body surface area (TBSA) resulting from thermal injury, trauma, or 
necrotizing fasciitis.  In STRATA2001, full -thickness wounds were temporized for 7 days with 
Strata Graft skin tissue or cadaver allograft prior to autografting.  Autograft take was 
comparable in wounds temporized with StrataGraft tissue as compared to cadaver allograft. 
There were no changes in the types of adverse events (AEs) as the dosage of StrataG raft skin 
tissue was increased [ADDRESS_914041] dermal elements 
and whose area of total injury ranged from 3 to 49% TBSA.  Each subject had 2 comparable 
wound areas identified, excised to remove nonviable tissue, and randomized to receive 
StrataGraft skin tissue or an autograft.  Thirty subjects were enrolled in this dose escala tion 
study.  Subjects in Cohort 1 received up to 220 cm2 of StrataGraft skin tissue while those in 
Cohort 2 received up to 440 cm2 of StrataGraft skin tissue.  Cohort 3 was completed as a clinical 
comparability evaluation of StrataGraft skin tissue that ha d been cryopreserved and stored 
frozen.  Subjects in Cohort 3 received up to 440 cm2 of thawed StrataGraft skin tissue.  None of 
the sites treated with StrataGraft skin tissue required autografting by [CONTACT_2006] 28.  Additionally, 27 
of the 28 per -protocol subjec ts had wound closure of treatment sites at the 3 month study 
session.  No safety signal was seen following application of StrataGraft skin tissue.  Molecular 
analysis of patient biopsy samples found no evidence of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from cells 
of StrataGraft skin tissue after 3 months, indicating that StrataGraft skin tissue had not 
engrafted but was replaced by [CONTACT_102]’s own skin.  
The STRATA2001 and STRATA2011 studies provided several important clinical findings that 
informed the development of this Phase III STRATA2016 protocol:  
None of the complex skin defects containing intact dermal elements treated with
StrataGraft skin tissue required autografting of these areas by [CONTACT_2006] 28.  These results
exceeded the metrics agreed to prior to the study that a 50% reduction in the
StrataGraft -treated area requiring autografting is clinically meaningful.
The absence of donor site harvest required for areas treated with StrataGraft skin tissue
resulted in significantly less pain, fewer sequelae, and superio r cosmesis relative to the
autograft donor site.

PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL  
  StrataGraft skin tissue did not permanently engraft and was replaced by [CONTACT_102]’s 
own cells by 3 months.  
 StrataGraft skin tissue remained intact, adherent, and viable in full -thickness skin 
defects for a t least [ADDRESS_914042] thermal burns of 3 to 49% 
TBSA, including an area that contains intact dermal elements for which surgical exc ision and

Two donor sites will be prospectively identified to provide sources of autografts for the control 
and StrataGraft treatment sites as needed.  After surgical excision of nonviable tissue, the 
StrataGraft tissue and autograft will be placed on the treatment sites in accordance with the 
randomization.  
 
Efficacy will be assessed by 1) evaluating the difference in the percent area of the StrataGraft -
treated and autograft -treated sites that are autografted by 3 months and 2) evaluating the 
proportio n of subjects achieving durable wound closure of the StrataGraft treatment site at 
[ADDRESS_914044] after topi[INVESTIGATOR_676093].  Routine safety monitoring will be performed by [CONTACT_1758]’s medical monitor (MM) 
and the Data and Safety Mo nitoring Board (DSMB).

TEST PRODUCT  
StrataGraft skin tissue contains an epi[INVESTIGATOR_676095], multilayered, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_676096] a single human donor grown on a collagen matrix embedded with 
fibroblasts from a second human donor.  StrataGraft skin tissue is not a patient -specific product 
but an allogeneic human skin substitute.  StrataGraft skin tissue is produced from well -
characterized cell banks of pathogen -free human keratinocytes and fibroblasts.  StrataGraft skin 
tissue reproduces many of the structural and biological p roperties of normal human skin and is 
intended to provide immediate wound coverage, barrier function, and sustained expression of 
wound healing factors to promote the healing of complex skin defects.

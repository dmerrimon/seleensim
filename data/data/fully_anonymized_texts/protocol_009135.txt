 1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Description of Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia 
Congenital adrenal hyp erplasia (CAH) consis ts of genetic disord ers affecting the 
synthesis of cortisol from the adrenal glands.  More than 90% of all CAH cases are due to 
defects in the cytochrome P 450 enzyme steroid 21-hydroxylase, a lso known as 
21-hydroxylase or CYP21A2.1  The enzyme 21-hydroxylase facilitates the conversion of 
17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) to 11-deoxycortisol , the immedi ate precursor of 
cortisol. Additionally, 21-hydroxylase is responsible for the c onversion of progesterone 
to 11-deoxycorticosterone, the precursor of aldosterone.[ADDRESS_1273459], partial or com plete glucocorticoid (GC) and mineralocorticoid (MC) 
deficiency may exist. Two forms  of 21-hydroxylase deficiency (2 1-OHD) have been 
defined: “classic” 21-OHD is asso ciated with cortisol insuffici ency and “nonclassic” 21-
OHD is associated with mild subclin ical impairment of cortisol synthesis.2  The 
remaining cases (<10%) of CAH are mainly due to four other enzy me deficiencies (i.e. 
P450scc, P450c17, 11 -hydroxylase, 3 -hydroysteroid dehydroge nase), a cholesterol 
protein defect (StAR) and one electron-transfer protein.3 
In the US, Newborn screening for CAH began in the late 1970’s w ith the ability to 
readily measure 17-OHP.4  Elevated 17-OHP, the hallmark of CAH due to 21-OHD, 
occurs in the setting of impaired ability to convert 11-deoxyco rtisol to cortisol and 
progesterone to deoxycorticoster one. Prior to screening measure s to identify CAH 
patients and treatment with G C therapy, undiagnosed/untreated CAH was associated with 
significant morbidity and mortality.   
Replacement GC and MC therapy are  the mainstays of CAH treatment. In spi[INVESTIGATOR_907183], CAH 
remains a challenging and difficult disease to manage. Lack of cortisol feedback 
inhibition results in markedly i ncreased ACTH production which over time results in 
enlarged adrenal glands. The adrenals of adult patients with CA H produce a large amount 
of only a few steroids: progesterone, 17-OHP, dehydroepi[INVESTIGATOR_77755] (DHEA) and its 
sulfate (DHEA-S).5   Management of classic CAH enta ils a difficult balance betwee n GC 
replacement required for survi val versus higher, supra-physiologic (pharmacologic) doses 
needed to suppress ACTH levels and decrease androgen production  without causing 
iatrogenic Cushing’s syndrome (CS). Women have the added challe nges of androgen 
excess (e.g., hirsutism, acne a nd alopecia) and potentially the  inability to conceive.5 
Women may also develop a secondary polycystic ovary syndrome (P COS) since 
androgens and 17-OHP also derive from the ovaries and may persi st even after adrenal 
suppression.[ADDRESS_1273460] complications of  androgen excess manifesting as 
suppression of gonadotropi[INVESTIGATOR_907184].7  Additionally, 
up to 50% of men may have testicular adrenal r est tumors which can become quite large 
and painful along with causing testicular dysfunction.8  Thus, there are three major 
concerns for the management of adults with 21-OHD: (1) preventi on of adrenal and 
gonadal hyperplasia and neoplasia, (2) prevention of long-term consequences of adrenal 
replacement therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and (3)  restoration of fertility in thos e who desire to have 
children.5  
Millendo Therapeutics,  Inc. ATR-101-201  
Confidential; [ADDRESS_1273461] non-
clinical proof of concept data and exposure of approximately 50  patients with 
adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) in a Phase 1 study.   
The mechanism of action of ATR- 101 has been studied extensively  in vitro and in vivo. 
ACAT1, the molecular target of  ATR-101, is highly expressed in the adrenal glands 
compared with other tissues
9 and ATR-101 is found at higher le vels in the adrenal glands 
compared to other sites in the body,10 both of which are likel y to contribute to the 
selectivity of ATR-101’s effects on the adrenal glands. ATR-101 disrupts adrenal 
cholesterol homeostasi s via ACAT1, an enzym e that catalyzes the  esterification of free 
cholesterol (FC) to cholesterol ester (CE). In the adrenal glan ds, CE serves as a substrate 
reservoir for steroid biosynthesis. At low doses/exposures, ATR -101 treatment results in 
reduction of the CE reservoir and leads to reduced synthesis of  adrenal steroids.  Higher 
doses/exposures of ATR-101 cause f urther disruption of the norm al FC/CE ratio which 
leads to endoplasmic reticulum stress and activation of the unf olded protein response. If 
left unresolved, this cascade res ults in apoptosis. The results present a clear molecular 
understanding of the dose-dependen t, novel mechanism of action of ATR-101. 
Two proof of concept dog studies  have been conducted which validate the mechanism of 
action studies.[ADDRESS_1273462] study in normal beagle dogs (N=3) were administered  ATR-
101 at 3 mg/kg/day for 7 days, f ollowed by 30 mg/kg/day for 7 days. At the conclusion of 
the study, adrenal CE levels we re markedly decreased and there were dose-and time-
dependent decreases in the level s of all adrenal steroids and steroid intermediates tested. 
The second study was conducted in dogs with natu rally-occurring  CS. Ten dogs with 
confirmed CS (three adrenal and s even pi[INVESTIGATOR_907185]) were treated as follows: four 
dogs received 2 weeks of treatme nt (3 mg/kg/day x 1 week, follo wed by 30 mg/kg/day x 
1 week); six dogs received 4 weeks  of treatment (3 mg/kg/day x 1 week, followed by 
30 mg/kg/day x 3 weeks). Nine out of [ADDRESS_1273463]- ACTH stimulated cortisol 
concentration was 51.5% at the ti me of study completion. ATR-101 was well tolerated in 
both dog studies with no meaningful  safety issues identified. T hese studies, along with 
the in vitro mechanism of action studies, s upport the use of ATR-101 in end ocrine 
diseases of adrenal dysfunction. 
Additional evidence of the adrenal-specific effects of ATR-101 comes from 4-week and 
13-week dog toxicity studies. I n the 13-week dog study, nine of  12 animals (four males, 
five females) at 30/20 mg/kg BID  and three of eight animals (on e male, two females) at 
10/7.5 mg/kg BID exhibited clinical  signs consistent with adren al insufficiency. The 
earliest presentation occurred on Day 17. Replacement glucocort icoid (GC) and 
mineralocorticoid (MC) therapy with subcutaneous prednisone and  fludrocortisone

in basal cortisol) were observed in the 4-week study and replac ement GC/MC therapy 
was not required. ATR-101-relate d gross pathologic changes cons isted of bilaterally 
small adrenal glands in both sex es at ≥3 mg/kg BID which correl ated with atrophy of the 
adrenal cortex microscopi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y.  Both 4-week and 13-week studies suggested that the 
effects of ATR-101, even at the higher doses, are partially rev ersible. The decreases in 
adrenal function (decreases in ba sal and ACTH-stimulated cortis ol measurements), 
decreased adrenal weights and histologic changes, were all anti cipated based upon 
published studies.11, [ADDRESS_1273465]-in-human, maxi mum tolerated dose (MTD) study, in ACC. ACC is a rare, 
but highly malignant and aggres sive cancer. ATR-101 doses for t his indication are 
markedly higher (i.e. currentl y approximately 97.9 mg/kg/day) a nd are targeted for 
apoptotic effects. Mean AUC 0-24 values as high as ~45,000 ng hr/mL have been observed 
with acceptable toxicity (i.e. MTD has yet to be defined).   
In summary, ATR-[ADDRESS_1273466] udy is to evaluate the efficacy  and safety of orally 
administered ATR-101 in subjects with CAH.

criteria will be a ssessed during this period. The 21 day period  provides flexibility to 
complete laboratory tests and clinical assessments.     
 
3.1.2 Baseline Lead-in Period 
Eligible subjects will enter a  placebo Baseline Lead-in Period.   This 14 day period allows 
subjects to get accustomed to being in a clinical trial (e.g. avoiding prohibited medications) 
and taking investigational medicinal product (IMP) on a regular basis. This period also provides an opportunity to develop a more accurate assessment o f adrenal steroids and 
steroid intermediates and documen tation of exogenous steroid replacement therapy (GC and 
MC).   In order to obtain unbiased information, the subjects will not know that the tablets received 
are placebo and do not contain activ e drug substance (ATR-101).  Placebo tablets for this 
period will look identical to ATR -101 125 mg tablets (i.e. Dose  Level 1). However, the 
study center personnel will be aware that the tablets are place bo.  
 At the conclusion of the Baseline Lead-in Period, subjects will  be assessed for protocol 
compliance, including IMP complia nce (tablet counts) and whethe r it is appropriate to 
proceed in the study.    
3.1.3 Dose Level 1 (ATR-101 125 mg B ID and matching placebo) 
All subjects will start at Dose Level 1 which uses ATR-101 125 mg tablets dosed twice per 
day (BID). ATR-101 will be taken for 14 consecutive days.   Efficacy and safety (including laboratory measures and clinical assessment) will be assessed during a study visit after the completion of the 14 day ATR-101  treatment period (i.e. 
morning of day 15). Subjects should take the last dose of ATR-101 Dose Level 1 on the 
evening of day 14.   Day 15 (of the dosing period) will be the start of the single-blind, placebo Washout Period. The morning dose for day 15 should be  taken from the new bottle  dispensed at the day 15

Subjects will take a placebo tab let BID. Study site personnel w ill know that this is a placebo 
period, but subjects should remain blinded (i.e. not know when they are receiving ATR-101 
and when they are receiving placebo).  At the end of the 28 day period ( i.e. 14 days of ATR-101 and 14 days of single-blind 
placebo washout), subjects will re turn to the study center. Lab oratory tests and safety 
assessments will be conducted at this visit. Prior to this visi t, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_907186]-101 treatment period (i.e. day 15). If the primary outcome measure is met (i.e. 17-O HP < [ADDRESS_1273473]) this visit will 
be designated the Final Study Vis it and the subject will not co ntinue to Dose Level 2. 
However, if the primary outcome measure is not met (i.e. 17-OHP  > [ADDRESS_1273474]) and there are 
no safety concerns, the subject wi ll continue to Dose Level 2.  
 
3.1.4 Dose Levels 2, 3, 4 and 5  
Dose Levels 2, 3, 4 and 5 will follow the same procedures as Dose Level 1. Dose Level 2, (ATR-101 250 mg BID) will be tak en for 14 consecutive days. At the completion of the 
14 day treatment period, subjects will return to the study cent er for assessment of efficacy 
and safety (including laborator y measures and clinical assessment).  The 14 day single-
blind, placebo Washout Period will then start. After completion  of the placebo Washout 
Period, subjects will return to the  study center (laboratory te sting and safety assessment will 
occur) and either a Final Study Visit will take place or the su bjects will continue to Dose

use of ATR-101 in CAH. 
 The starting dose for all subjects will be ATR-101 125 mg taken BID orally with food. This dose corresponds to approximately 3 mg/kg/day for a 75 kg indiv idual and is intended to be 
a non-effective dose. While the 3 mg/kg/day dose was efficacious in dog studies, the 
exposures (i.e. AUC
0-24 hr  mean ~4700 ng hr/mL) were much higher re lative to the projected 
corresponding exposures in humans.  Based on pharmacokinetic mo deling from the 
available human data (ACC subjects and healthy volunteer food e ffect study13), the 125 mg 
BID dose will provide a steady-state AUC 0-24 hr  of ~2308 ng hr/mL. Dose Level 2 (250 mg 
BID) will provide an AUC 0-24 hr of ~4616 nghr/mL. Each subsequent dose level (3, 4 and 5) 
will increase the ATR-101 dos e by 500 mg per day, with projecte d steady-state AUC 0-24 hr  
values of ~9234, [ZIP_CODE] and [ZIP_CODE] ng hr/mL, respectively. Thus, the projected exposures 
span a non-effective range up to approximately 4-times the effe ctive exposure observed in 
the dog studies which allows fo r potential pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic differences 
between dogs and humans.  
 The Phase [ADDRESS_1273477] ex posures observed (to date) 
in the ACC study have been ~45,000 nghr/mL. These exposures ha ve been well- tolerated 
and the study will continue to dose escalate until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or 
Phase 2/[ADDRESS_1273478] (all have advanced stag e cancer and most have 
undergone multiple prior treatment regimens) relative to the CA H patient population.

17-OHP is set at > [ADDRESS_1273484]. The primary efficacy 
outcome measure will be aligned to the clinical goal of achievi ng a mildly elevated 17-OHP 
level which for this study i s defined as < [ADDRESS_1273485] (andros tenedione, testosterone, DHEA, D HEA-S) will also serve to 
define efficacy. 
 The majority of CAH subjects will enter the study on both GC an d MC replacement (75% of 
classic CAH subjects have defici encies in both pathways). Howev er, plasma renin activity 
(PRA) and aldosterone will be assessed to determine the potential impact on the MC pathway.   
ACTH levels will be assessed to de termine potential effects on the hypothalamic-pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]-
adrenal (HPA)-axis. Glucocorticoid replacement doses are expect ed to remain unchanged so 
no significant changes in ACTH are anticipated. Confirmation of stable ACTH levels 
associated with decreases in 17-OHP and androgens will help to establish the ATR-101 
pharmacodynamic effects.  Increas ed GC levels, secondary to decreased hepatic metabolism 
(ATR-[ADDRESS_1273486]; see Section 5.4), could potentially lead  to decreased ACTH and 
subsequently decreased 17-OHP l evels. This could potentially co nfound assessment of 
direct ATR-101 effects on adrenal  steroid and steroid intermediate synthesis. Therefore, 
assessment of GC levels will also be done during the study. 
 
3.4 Safety Assessment 
 
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_12902], changes in physical examination (including vital signs) , changes in electrocar diograms (ECGs), and changes in laboratory 
parameters. Safety assessment will take place every [ADDRESS_1273487] entered the study on stable GC and MC re gimens. Monitoring and 
management of replacement steroids should continue per usual cl inical practice.

5.3.1 Timing and Administrative Dosing Conditions 
IMP should be taken approximate ly 12 hours apart (twice per day  dosing). The time of day 
that the dose is taken should be as consistent as possible (e.g. every morning at 8AM and every evening at 8PM).   IMP should be taken immediately after consumption of food. No specific food contents are required and subjects should maint ain usual eatin g practices. I f a full meal is not possible or 
not aligned with a subject’s us ual eating practices, a light sn ack should be consumed prior to 
taking IMP.   The first dose of each bottle will be administered at the site prior to PK sampling.  Subjects 
will be provided with food to consum e prior to dose administrat ion. See Pharmacy Manual 
for more details.  Grapefruit, grapefruit juice and other foods containing grapefr uit should be avoided to 
prohibit possible interactions in the metabolism of ATR-[ADDRESS_1273507] does not meet the p rimary outcome measure (i.e. 17 -OHP <[ADDRESS_1273508]) at the

Confidential; [ADDRESS_1273509] if there are no safety issues. There is the possibility o f receiving a maximum of 5 dose 
levels (Levels 1-5).  
 A subject must follow the dose levels in numerical sequence (i. e. Dose Level 1 followed by 
[CONTACT_83906] 2 etc.). Skippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a  dose level is prohibited and may result in termination from 
the study.   
5.3.[ADDRESS_1273510] cannot tol erate a given dose due to a safety issue then early 
termination from the study is th e recommended course of action.  Decreasing to a lower dose 
(e.g., once per day dosing or taking fewer tablets at each AM o r PM dose) or to the previous 
dose level is not permitted. Additi onally, increased doses are not permitted at any time other 
than those associated with the p rotocol design (i.e. advancing to the next dose level). Taking 
more tablets at a given dose is not permitted under any circums tances.  
 
5.3.[ADDRESS_1273511] forgets to take a dose on a given day (e.g. the AM dose was not taken), a “make up” dose should not be taken. In general, if more than [ADDRESS_1273512] passed beyond the usual 
time of day when the dose is tak en, that particular dose should  not be taken.   
5.3.5 Withholding IMP  
A “drug holiday” or “dosing break” is not recommended due to th e relatively short [ADDRESS_1273513] a medical event (e.g., dental emergency) that is considered to be transient or rev ersible within a few days that may potentially have a

6.10 Pharmacodynamic Assessments 
The effects of ATR-101 on adrenal  steroid synthesis will be assessed at each study visit by 
[CONTACT_907229], glucocorticoid 
and androgen pathways. Plasma renin activity (PRA) is not an ad renal steroid, but it will be 
measured as an assessment of min eralocorticoid a ctivity. In add ition, ACTH levels will be 
assessed to determine the poten tial impact on the HPA-axis.  
 
Pharmacodynamic measures:  
 Glucocorticoid pathwa y: 17-OHP, progesterone 
 Mineralocorticoid pathway: 11-de oxycorticosterone (11-DOC); PRA ; aldosterone 
 Androgens: androstenedione, total  testosterone, free testostero ne, DHEA, DHEA-S  
 HPA-axis: ACTH

is collected 
 Blood sample collection must be done prior to 10:[ADDRESS_1273537] not 
be collected; the visit procedu res should not be performed and the study visit must be 
rescheduled for the next day or  as soon as feasible.  The subje ct should continue taking 
study drug with the last dose o ccurring the evening prior to th e rescheduled visit. 
 Dosing of GC and MC may take place after collection of blood sa mples for adrenal steroids 
and steroid intermediates.    
Millendo Therapeutics, Inc. ATR-101-201 
Confidential; 14 January 2016 Page 37 of 66 
 Approximately 20 mL of blood will be collected for steroid horm one testing and 
approximately 10 mL of blood will be collected for testing synt hetic glucocorticoid levels.  
If exogenous GC levels are suspected of confounding the efficac y outcome measures, 
additional testing may be perfor med.  Further details on sample  collection and handling are 
provided in the Laboratory Manual. 
 
6.12 Adverse Events, Serious Adve rse Events, and Reporting 
6.12.1 Adverse Events, Severity, and Relationship 
 
Adverse Event (AE):  Any untoward medical occurrence in a subje ct or clinical 
investigation subject administered an investigational product.  An AE does not necessarily 
have a causal relationship with IMP.   
 All AEs reported for enrolled s ubjects during the clinical stud y will be recorded on the 
eCRF.  All AEs, regardless of r elationship to s tudy drug or procedure, should be 
collected beginning from the time the subject signs the study consent.  AEs in clinical 
investigation subjects include  any change in the subject’s cond ition.  This includes 
symptoms, physical findi ngs, or clinical syndromes. 
 An abnormal laboratory value ma y be considered an AE if the ide ntified laboratory 
abnormality leads to any type of intervention whether prescribe d in the protocol or not.  
It is up to the PI/SI to determine  whether an abnormal laborato ry value constitutes an 
AE.  If an abnormal laboratory value is caused by a disease pro cess, the disease process 
and not the laboratory abnormality should be listed as the AE ( e.g., if new onset viral 
hepatitis is causing elevated ala nine aminotransferase (ALT), hepatitis and not the 
elevated ALT should be listed as the AE). 
 Examples of laboratory abnormalities that should be considered AEs include those that 
result in withdrawal of the study treatment, withholding study treatment pending some 
investigational outcome, or additional concomitant treatment.  All laboratory 
abnormalities considered to constitute an AE should be recorded  on the appropriate AE 
page of the eCRF.  Laboratory abnormalities do not need to be l isted as separate AEs if 
they are considered to be part of  a clinical syndrome that is b eing reported as an AE.  It 
is the responsibility of the Investigator to review all laborat ory findings in all subjects.  
Abnormal values should be commented upon as to clinical relevan ce or importance on 
the eCRF or the laboratory repor t as appropriate.  Medical and scientific judgment 
should be exercised in deciding whe ther an isolated laboratory abnormality should be 
classified as an AE. 
 AEs will be collected from the time the subject signs informed consent until [ADDRESS_1273538] dose of IMP.     
 Every effort must be made by [CONTACT_941] P I/SI to categorize each AE ac cording to its severity 
and its relationship to IMP. 
 Subjects who develop toxicity on study will be followed until t he event resolves, 
stabilizes or returns to baseline. 
 
Millendo Therapeutics, Inc. ATR-101-201 
Confidential; [ADDRESS_1273539] be based on the Investigator’s clinical judgement.  
Maximum severity should be ass igned to one of the following cat egories: 
 
 Mild : An AE which is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423], causing minimal discomfort and 
not interfering with everyday activities. 
 Moderate : An AE which is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with n ormal everyday 
activities. 
 Severe : An AE which prevents normal everyday activities. 
 
An AE which is assessed as sev ere should not be confused with a  serious AE.  Refer to 
Section 6.12.5 for the definition of a serious AE. 
 
6.12.3 Assessing Relationship to Study Treatment 
Items to be considered when asse ssing the relationship of an AE  to the study treatment are 
as follows:  
 Temporal relationship of the onset  of the event to the initiation of the study treatment 
 The course of the event, considering especially the effect of d iscontinuation of study 
treatment or reintroduction of study treatment, as applicable 
 Whether the event is known to be associated with the study trea tment or with other 
similar treatments 
 The presence of risk factors i n the study subject known to incr ease the occurrence of the 
event 
 The presence of non-study treatme nt related factors which are k nown to be associated 
with the occurrence of the event 
 
Only AEs thought to be caused by [CONTACT_907230] “rel ated to IMP”.    
6.12.4 Classification of Causality 
The relationship of an adverse ev ent to the administration of t he study drug is to be assessed 
according to the following definitions: 
 No (unrelated, not rel ated, no relation) – The  time course betw een the administration of 
study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event  rules out a causal 
relationship and another cause ( concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], c omplications, etc.) is 
suspected. 
 Yes (related) – The time course between the administration of s tudy drug and the 
occurrence or worsening of the a dverse event is consistent with  a causal relationship and 
no other cause (concomitant drugs , therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc.) can be identified. The 
definition implies a reasonable  possibility of a causal relatio nship between the event and 
the study drug. This means that t
here are facts (evidence) or a rguments to suggest a 
causal relationship. 
Millendo Therapeutics, Inc. ATR-101-201 
Confidential; 14 January 2016 Page 39 of 66 
 Not Related :  A causal relationship betwee n the study treatment and the AE  is not a 
reasonable possibility. 
Related :  A causal relationship between t he study treatment and the AE  is a reasonable 
possibility.  The Investigator m ust further qualify the degree of certainty as “ possible, ” 
“probable ”, or “ definite .” 
6.12.5 Serious Adverse Events 
6.12.5..1 Definition of Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event (experi ence; SAE) or reaction is any un toward medical occurrence 
which: 
 Results in death 
 Is life-threatening (Note:  The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers 
to an event in which the subjec t was at risk of death at the ti me of the event; it does not 
refer to an event which hypothe tically might have caused death if it were more severe.) 
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_907192]: Any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_907193] w ill be considered an 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12191]. An emergency room visit without hosp ital admission will not 
be recorded as a serious adverse event (SAE) under this criteri on, nor will 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a procedure scheduled or planned before sig ning of informed consent. 
However, unexpected complicatio ns and/or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_907194]. 
 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 Is determined to be an important m edical event (at the discretion of the Investigator) 
 Medical and scientific judgmen t should be exercised in deciding  whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important  medical events that may not be 
immediately life-threatening or  result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_907195] e of the other  outcomes listed in the 
definition above.  These should als o usually be considered seri ous. 
The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_907196] “AE” 
(i.e., no untoward medical occurrenc e) associated with the hosp italization: 
 Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] r equired by [CONTACT_760] 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_907197] i nformed consent (where the co ndition requiring the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_907198]
d post study drug administration)

 9 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS 
9.1 General Considerations 
 
Sample size considerations are  based on a Simon 2-stage Minimax  design with 1-sided alpha of 
5% and 80% power.   Stage 1 consists of 9 completed subjects. The study will stop a t Stage 1 if either of the following 
conditions are met: 
 Futility criteria: defined as   <2 of 9 (22%) subjects meeting t he primary outcome 
measure (17-OHP <[ADDRESS_1273561])  
 Success criteria: defined as  >7 of 9 (78%) subjects meeting th e primary outcome 
measure (17-OHP <[ADDRESS_1273562])  
 
Stage 2 will commence if 3, 4, 5 or 6 of the 9 subjects meet th e primary outcome measure. In 
this scenario, accrual will continue with up to 8 additional su bjects for a total of no more than 
17 subjects. Accrual may stop earli er with sufficient evidence for further development if a total 
of 7 or more subjects respond (minimum observed response rate o f 7/17, 41%). 
 The study medical monitor along with the Sponsor may determine if a subject will be replaced in order to have a minimum of [ADDRESS_1273563] 11 days of ATR-
101 treatment at Dose Level 1 (th e lowest dose level) and have at least one post-baseline 
efficacy assessment (i.e.17-OHP) without having a significant p rotocol deviation.  
 The safety population will include  all subjects that received a t least one dose of IMP. 
 
9.[ADDRESS_1273564] deviations or medians/percentiles will summarize non-categorical variables.

9.6 Secondary Endpoints 
 Descriptive statistics and graphical summaries within each coho rt, and for each dose as 
appropriate, will be utilized to present the pharmacokinetic an d pharmacodynamics parameters 
assessed.  
9.7 Safety 
 
Safety parameters, including adverse events, treatment disconti nuations, laboratory changes and 
abnormalities, and changes in ECG parameters will be tabulated and each dose, as appropriate.  
 
9.8 Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Analyses 
 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments will be performed at each dose level to determine ATR-101 exposures and to profile PK/PD relationships. PK assessments wi ll include C
max, Area Under 
the Curve (AUC 0-4 hr), and trough levels. 
Individual subject PK data wil l be analyzed along with pooling of subjects’ data at each dose 
level.  
PK/PD analyses will be detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan.   
9.9 Interim Analysis 
 
No interim analysis is planned f or this study as neither the ef ficacy nor the safety results will be 
blinded to the PI/SI, study medical monitor or the Sponsor.

10.[ADDRESS_1273569] of the Study 
The guidelines of the World Medic al Association Declaration of Helsinki in its revised edition 
(48th General Assembly, Somerse t West, Republic of South Africa , October 1996), the 
guidelines of ICH GCP (CPMP/ICH/135/95), as well as the demands  of national drug and data 
protection laws and other applicab le regulatory requirements, w ill be strictly followed.  
10.[ADDRESS_1273570] Information and Consent 
The PI/SI is responsible for e nsuring that subjects do not unde rgo any study-related examination 
or activity before giving inform ed consent.  The subject must g ive written consent after the 
receipt of detailed informati on regarding the study.  The verba l explanation will cover all the 
elements specified in the writ ten information provided to the subject.  If the written informed 
consent is provided by [CONTACT_907232] i s unable to do so, a written or 
verbal assent from the subject must also be obtained. 
The PI/SI will inform the subject of the aims, methods, anticip ated benefits, and potential 
hazards of the study, including any discomfort it may entail.  The subject must be given every 
opportunity to clarify any points he/she does not understand an d must be provided with more 
information if requested.  At th e end of the interview, the sub ject may be given time to reflect 
and can request more time if need ed.  The subject and/or legal guardian will be required to sign 
and date the informed consent for m.  After completion, informed  consent forms will be kept and 
archived by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_907204]. 
It should be emphasized to the subject that he or she is at lib erty to either discontinue IMP 
and/or withdraw consent to par ticipate at any time, without pen alty or loss of benefits to which 
he or she is otherw ise entitled.  Subjects who refuse to give o r withdraw written informed 
consent may not be included or continued in this study, but thi s will not affect their subsequent

 Please refer to Title 21 of the CFR, Part 50 – Protection of Hu man Subjects for specific details 
on this regulation. 
10.[ADDRESS_1273571] Confidentiality 
Personal and sensitive data will  be treated as confidential.  T he results of the clinical trial will 
be made available for review by [CONTACT_907233] t he Sponsor and/or submitted to 
the IRB/IEC, and regulatory authorities.   
Prior to the subject’s enrollmen t in the clinical trial, the su bject’s consent is required for the data 
to be used for these purposes a nd to gain direct access to thei r medical records for data 
verification purposes.  The subjec t must be assured that their identity will be protected.  To 
facilitate this, a unique iden tification number will be assigne d and it will be used when reporting 
study-related data.  
Additionally, in the US, the Hea lth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 
(“HIPAA”) requires that all su bjects grant permission to use their personal health information.  
Therefore, in addition to the protocol-specific ICF, each subje ct located in the [LOCATION_002] 
(US) will be asked to provide aut horization to use his/her pers onal health information by 
[CONTACT_2960] a separate HIPAA Authorization Form.   
10.5 Study Monitoring 
It is understood that the Spons or or its designee (e.g., the CR A) will contact [CONTACT_907234]/SI 
regularly for monitoring purposes.  The CRA will be allowed, on  request, to inspect the various 
records of the clinical trial (i.e., eCRFs, source documents, a nd any other pertinent data), 
provided that subject confidentiality is maintained in accordan ce with local requirements.  It 
will be the CRA’s responsibility t o inspect the eCRFs at regula r intervals throughout the clinical 
trial, to verify adherence to the  protocol and to ensure the completeness, consistency, and 
accuracy of the data entered.  The CRA must have access to all subject records needed to verify 
the entries on the eCRF.  The PI/ SI (or a designee) agrees to c ooperate with the CRA to ensure 
that problems detected during t hese monitoring visits are resol ved. 
In addition, the Sponsor may perf orm a Clinical Quality Assurance (CQA) audit randomly at a 
sample of clinical sites, or for cause as warranted.  The CQA a udit will examine the accuracy of 
source documentation, record retention, data management, and co mpliance.  These audits will 
be independent of routine mon itoring by [CONTACT_907235]. 
10.6 Case Report Forms a nd Study Records 
This clinical trial will utilize an electronic data capture sys tem for the management of clinical 
data.  The data will be collecte d in electronic form (i.e., via  an eCRF) to allow for data entry at 
the site from source documentati on directly into the electronic  database.  Access to the 
electronic system will be res tricted, and users will only be ab le to access the system via 
authorized individual accounts.  A ll changes to data in the dat abase will be tracked and time 
Millendo Therapeutics, Inc. ATR-101-201 
Confidential; 14 January 2016 Page 55 of 66 
 stamped automatically, includi ng updates to data entries and re solution of data queries 
generated by [CONTACT_2689] o r data reviewer.  
Training will be provided to all system users based on their in dividual access and use 
requirements initially an d ongoing throughout the course of the  clinical trial as needed.  
Documentation of training will be k ept in the site regulatory f ile and in Sponsor’s TMF. 
A comprehensive Data Management Plan will be written outlining the standard operating 
procedures, internal/external security safeguards, system and change controls, and training 
procedures and will be filed in the Sponsor’s TMF.  A cumulativ e record will also be kept of the 
user and access privileges for all authorized users across the clinical trial.  
The system and procedures for el ectronic database set-up, entry , review, access, security, and 
auditing are designed in specific compliance with 21 CFR 11 and  the Food and Drug 
Administration's (FDA’s) Part  11 Guidance for Industry supplement “Computerized Systems 
Used in Clinical Investiga tions” dated May 2007.  Any additiona l electronic systems that may 
be used by [CONTACT_276623] (e.g., PK) or c linical sites (e .g., electron ic medical records used as source 
documents) should comply with the se same regulatory standards.  
As a final step in the data ma nagement process, a 100% quality control review will be 
performed on the key efficacy and safety parameters.  In addition, a random subject sample 
(approximately 10%) will be selec ted to perform a database audit.  The purpose of this audit is 
to detect systematic and random errors.   
10.[ADDRESS_1273572] (DSMB) is not planned for this s tudy since treatment is 
unblinded to study personnel and t he overall small size of the study generally limits the value of 
pooling data across the study popul ation. All study PI/SI will have the ability to assess 
benefit:risk for each subject i n almost real time.  The study medical monitor and Sponsor will 
have access to safety and efficac y data from across the entire study population. The study 
design limits the duration of ATR -101 treatment duration and as sesses safety every 2 weeks.   
10.8 Protocol Deviations 
Protocol deviations from inclusion/exclusion criteria, concomit ant medication restrictions, and 
from any other protocol require ments that could, at least hypothetically, result in significant risk 
to the subject and/or affect the outcome of the study will be collected.  Additionally, nonadherence to the study proce dures or schedule as defined by [CONTACT_174301] a missed 
procedure or an out-of-window st udy visit will be documented as  protocol deviations.    
10.9 Access to Source Documentation 
The PI/SI must permit the author ized Sponsor, agents of the Sponsor, and regulatory agency 
employees to enter and inspect  any site where the drug or records pertaining to the drug are held 
and to inspect and copy all records relating to an investigatio n including subject records.  To 
ensure the accuracy of data subm itted, it is mandatory that rep resentatives of the Sponsor and of 
the regulatory agencies have dir ect access to source documents (e.g., subject medical records,

the IRB/IEC, and regulatory author ities.  Prior to the subject’s enrollment in the study, the 
subject’s consent is required for  the data to be used for these  purposes and to gain direct access 
to their medical records for da ta verification purposes.  The s ubject must be assured that their 
identity will be protected.   To facilitate this, a unique iden tification number will be assigned 
and it will be used when reporting study-related data.

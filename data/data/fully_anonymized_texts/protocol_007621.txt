Study Title :  Vaccine effectiveness and seroconversion  to 23 Valent Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccination  
in Children with Type 1 Diabetes    
 
Protocol version number  and date:  Version 4, 4/22/2022  
 
Research Question and Aims  
 
Hypothesis : Childr en with Type [ADDRESS_960048] reduced immunological  response to  23 valent polysaccharide 
pneumococcal vaccination (PPSV23)  as assessed by [CONTACT_706668] . 
 
Aims, purpose, or objectives : 
Specific Aim 1 : To determine if children with type [ADDRESS_960049] adequate immune response to PPSV23 
vaccination and to assess factors affecting immune response . 
Hypothesis 1: Children with type 1 diabete s (T1DM)  will have a suboptimal immunological respo nse to 
PPSV23 as assessed by [CONTACT_706669] . Lower age of the patient, longer duration of diabetes and poor 
glycemic control will be associated with impaired immunogenic response to the PPSV23.  
 
Specific Aim 2 : To assess if patients with T1DM have waning  of immune response to PPSV23 six months 
following vaccination  and associated factors that  may be assoc iated with the vaccine response . 
Hypothesis 2: T1DM children will have higher waning of immunity as compared to general population without 
T1DM.  Lower ag e of the patient, longer duration of diabetes and poor glycemic control will be associated with 
impaired immunogenic response to the PPSV23.  
 
 
Background :  
Diabetics are at risk for invasive pneumococcal infections and are more lik ely to have severe outcomes with 
infection compared to the general population.1-3  Half of all school -age children with T1DM  are colonized with 
Streptococcus pneumon iae, underscoring  the need for pneumococcal vaccination.4  While the CDC 
recommends all children > 2 yea rs with type 1 diabetes receive  PPSV23  to prevent invasive pneumococcal 
disease , literature suggests lack of compliance and missed opportunities for PPSV23 vaccination in diabetic 
children .5,6  Furthermore,  it is unknown  if children with T1DM  mount sufficient  immunological response  to 
PPSV23 vaccination .

 PPSV23 immuno logical response relies upon the adaptive immune system  including adequate T -cell activation 
by [CONTACT_22653], T -cell proliferation, subsequent B -cells stimulation, and antibody production.  
While definitive data on the degree of global adaptive  immune impairment in diabetics remains unclear, there 
are likely some T -cell interactions with antigen presenting cells that explain the decreased antibody response to 
vaccination.  Adult studies indicate decreased antibody response to T -cell dependent an tigens  via altered 
antigen -presenting T -cell interaction s.7  Others describe f unctional immune impairments including abnormal 
CD4, CD8, and CD8 Treg proliferation as well as abnormalities in the antigen presenting cell including 
monocyte derived dendritic cells having reduced CD54 adhesion molecules and increased inhibitory cytokines 
(IL-10) in type  [ADDRESS_960050].  Assessing g lobal IgG studies  which include  all subtypes may 
better inform clinicians of immune response.  We hypothesize that  serological response to PPSV23 as assessed 
by [CONTACT_706670], IgM, and IgA response will be altered in  T1DM .  Better understanding the immune r espons e to 
PPSV23 may lead to better  timing of vacci nation in relation to diabetes diagnosis , optimize diabetes care to 
prevent sustained and uncontrolled hyperglycemia around the time of infection, and perhaps even inform the 
need for further booster PPSV23 vaccinations. Optimizing PPSV23 vaccination may decrease invasive 
pneumococcal infections and related morbidity in you ng patients with T1DM .   
Study Design and Methods  
 
Methods :  Describe  in lay terms , completely detail ing the research activities that will be conducted by [CONTACT_89723] . 
 
We aim to identify  children with T1DM 3-[ADDRESS_960051] not received pneumococcal polysaccharide 
vaccination (Pneumovax 23).  The diagnosis of T1 DM will be confirmed clinically based upon a hemoglobin 
A1C >  6.5% and history consistent with  T1DM .  Children with other diseases known to significantly 
compromise immunity and vaccine response will be excluded .  Target accrual will be 100 children.  
 
Seroconversion assessment:   Vaccine response as assessed by [CONTACT_706671] 6 months after 
immunization  (+/- 4 months) .  Blood draws will be aligned when possible with the participant’s quarterly 
clinical hemoglobin A1C checks, to minimize additional blood draws .  Key clinical information will be 
abstracted including hemoglobin A1C history, years of diabetes, glucose variability, diabetes technology use, 
and anthropometric  data.

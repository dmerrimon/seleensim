Methodology:  
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, efficacy and safety 
study of ciclesonide MDI for the treatment of symptomatic COVID -19 infection.  Enrolled patients will 
be male and female adults and adolescents ≥ [ADDRESS_494574] of an initial 
screening/enrollment/randomization visit, a 30-day treatment period, and a follow-up period. 
Following signature [CONTACT_56534], patients meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will be 
randomly assigned (1:1) to treatment with ciclesonide MDI 320 µg twice daily (BID) (morning [ AM] 
and evening [ PM]) plus standard supportive care (hereafter referred to as the ciclesonide arm) or placebo 
MDI BID ( AM and PM) plus standard supportive care (hereafter referred to as the placebo arm).  During 
the initial screening/enrollment/randomization visit, patients will be instructed on how to self -admini ster 
a MDI and will be discharged home with a [ADDRESS_494575] (ie, either 
ciclesonide MDI or placebo MDI), standard supportive care, a pulse oximeter for at -home oxygen 
saturation level monitorin g, and an electronic diary  (eDiary) .  A nasopharyngeal sample for viral load 
analysis will also be obtained at the initial screening/enrollment/randomization visit.  Patients will be instructed to record self -administration of investigational product and  oxygen saturation levels in the 
eDiary .  Prior to self -administration of the investigational product (ie, within 1  hour of administration), 
patients will also complete and record assessments in the eDiary  of severity of COVID-19- related 
symptoms of cough , dyspnea , chills, and feeling feverish (based on a 4-point scale where 0 = absent, 
1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe) and the presence/absence of COVID-19- related symptoms of 
repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and new loss of taste or smell .  
Qualified healthcare providers  will c ontact  patients on days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 21  ± 2 days, and 
30 ± [ADDRESS_494576] adverse event  and concomitant medication information, 
and to confirm/clarify information recorded in the eDiary .  During these patient contacts, m edical advice 
commensurate with standard of care for reported symptoms or adverse events will be provided.  On day 30 (wind ow of + 2 days) , the patient will return to the study site for collection of a nasopharyngeal 
sample for viral load analysis  and to return the eDiary  and investigational product (ie, used and unused 
MDIs) .  Qualified healthcare providers will c ontact  patients on day 37 ± 4 days and day 60 ± [ADDRESS_494577] follow -up safety and outcome data (the follow-up period). 
Patients (or their representatives) will be asked to notify study personnel directly in the event they visit 
an emergency department or are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_394160] . 
Patient duration on study is expected to be approximately 60 days, including the 
screening/enrollment/randomization visit, the 30-day treatment period and the subsequent follow-up 
period.  In the event the patient requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48285] 30-day treatment period, the patient will discontinue investigational product and scheduled follow-up procedures but will continue to be 
followed for the outcome of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_394161]. 
An independent and appropriately constituted Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be organized for 
this study.  A charter detailing the purpose of the committee as well as their roles and responsibilities 
will be put into place and will guide and direct their actions.  Covis Pharma GmbH, Ciclesonide Inhalation Aerosol

Statistical Methods:  
Efficacy  
The primary efficacy variable is  time to  alleviation  of COVID -19-related symptoms of coug h, dyspnea, 
chills, feeling feverish, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and new loss of 
taste or smell, defined as symptom -free for a continuous period of ≥ 24 hours (ie, ≥ 3 AM/PM 
assessments)  by [CONTACT_4475] 30.  The primary analysis will be based on the intent- to-treat population 
(all randomized patients).  To increase precision  of treatment effect estimation and inference, a Cox 
proportional hazards model will be used to allow for inclusion of additional prespecified prognostic 
baseline covariates.  The median time to event and 95% confidence intervals will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_2939], and Kaplan -Meier estimates of the survival curves will also be generated.  The s econdary

[CONTACT_4475] 7, by [CONTACT_4475] 14, and by [CONTACT_4475] [ADDRESS_494579] (eg, oral candidiasis).  
Interim Safety Review  
The DMC will conduct a review of blinded safety data once [ADDRESS_494580] been enrolled.  Details of 
the interim safety review will be described in detail in the DMC charter.  
Sample Size and Power:  
This study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of ciclesonide MDI plus standard supportive care 
compared with placebo MDI plus standard supportive care.  The primary endpoint is  time to  alleviation  
of COVID-19- related symptoms of cough, dyspnea, chills, feeling feverish, repeated shaking with chills, 
muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and new loss of taste or smell, defined as symptom -free for a 
continuous period of ≥ 24 hours (ie, ≥ 3 AM/PM assessments)  by [CONTACT_4475] 30.  Assuming a median time to 
alleviation of 7 days for the ciclesonide arm and 11 days for the placebo arm (hazard ratio of approximately 1.58) with a total study duration of 30 days and a total of 201 events observed in the 
2 arms combined , a sample size of approximately 232 patients (116 in each arm) is required to achieve 
90% power at α  = 0.[ADDRESS_494581] the overall power of the study, the planned sample size was increased to 400 patients (200 in each arm) for this study.  Note that these are best estimates at this point as there is still much uncertainty regarding COVID -19.

3 INTRODUCTION 
3.1 Background Information on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
There is currently an outbreak of respi[INVESTIGATOR_19538] a novel coronavirus that was first 
detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, and that has now been detected in many locations internationally, including cases in the [LOCATION_002].   The virus has been named Severe 
Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7531] 2 ( SARS -CoV-2) and the disease it causes has been 
named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19).  On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health 
and Human Services issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID -19 and 
on March 13, 2020, the President declared a national emergency in response to COVID-19. 
The [LOCATION_002] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CD C) has stated that symptoms 
compatible with COVID -[ADDRESS_494587] targets, such as interleukin -6 receptor inhibitors that may be helpful in reducing 
lung inflammation and improving lung function in COVID-19 patients, thereby [CONTACT_394183][INVESTIGATOR_1856]. 
3.2 Background Information on Ciclesonide and Rationale for Use in COVID-19 
Alvesco® (ciclesonide) Inhalation Aerosol is an inhaled corticosteroid that has been approved in 
the [LOCATION_002] for the indication of maintenance treatment of asthma as prophylactic therapy in adult and adol escent patients 12 years of age and older ( Alvesco
® Inhalation Aerosol US 
prescribing i nformation, 2019).  Alvesco (ciclesonide) Inhalation Aerosol is administered by [CONTACT_394184] a pressurized metered-dose inhaler (MDI) and is available in 2 strengths (80 µg/actuation and 160 µg/actuation) .  Additional summary information regarding Alvesco 
(ciclesonide) Inhalation Aerosol is provided in the product labeling (Alvesco
® Inhalation Aerosol 
US prescribing information, 2019). 
Systemic g lucocorticoid therapy is not currently indicated in patients w ith pneumonia or 
COVID-[ADDRESS_494588] Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7531] ( CDC , 2020).  However, inhaled 
glucocorticoids, such as ciclesonide, may demonstrate clinical ben efit in patients with less severe 
symptoms of COVID- 19 (Fu et al, 2020; Zhai et al, 2020).  
Institut Pasteur Korea has recently identified ciclesonide as a potential candidate against COVID-[ADDRESS_494589] SARS -CoV -2.  Of these, 24 drugs (including ciclesonide) showed antiviral 
activity against SARS -CoV -2 (Jeon et al, 2020).  This finding was corroborated in a recent 
publication by [CONTACT_394185], 2020, in which it was reported that ciclesonide blocked SARS -CoV-2 replication in cultured cells  at low concentrations.  Furthermore , a small number Covis Pharma GmbH, Ciclesonide Inhalation Aerosol

(n = 3) of p
atients in Japan with confirmed COVID -19 infection, all over 65 years of age and 
receiving supplemental oxygen, were treated with ciclesonide and demonstrated clinical 
improvement in 2 days ( Puiu, 2020), providing additional support for continued study of 
ciclesonide in the treat ment of COVID-19.  Interestingly, an underlying mechanism for the 
suppression of viral infection by [CONTACT_394186] a drug-r esistant 
mutant.  Isolation of this mutant indicated that NSP15, a viral riboendonuclease, is a mo lecular 
target of ciclesonide ( Matsuyama et al, 2020).  Thus, it is reasonable to consider that ciclesonide 
may exhibit a direct -acting antiviral activity in addition to its intrinsic anti-inflammatory function 
and, therefore, has the potential to manifest dual roles (antiviral and anti- inflammatory) in the 
treatment of COVID -19 infection. 
The systemic bioavailability is low for inhaled glucocorticoids (mean maximum concentration [C
max] of des -ciclesonide [pharmacologically active metabolite of ciclesonide prodrug] in plasma 
following once daily 320 µg inhaled ciclesonide was 0.369 ng/mL), whereas oral glucocorticoids such as prednisone and prednisolone have a mean C
max of 2.4 and 18.1 µg/L/1 mg dose, 
respectively ( Czock et al, 2005).  Therefore, it is hypothesized that use of Alvesco (ciclesonide) 
Inhalation Aerosol will reduce inflammation and viral replication in the lung in patients with COVID-[ADDRESS_494590] risk when expo sed to COVID -19 ( Yang et al, 2020;  
Zhang et al, 2020).  There is currently limited data describing how COVID-19 affects people with asthma.  In a study of 140 cases of COVID-19 patients no link to asthma was observed (Zhang et al, 2020).  The data reported thus far may support the hypothesis that inhaled corticosteroids could provide a protective effect for these patients against COVID -19. 
Covis Pharma B.V. (Covis) is assessing the safety and efficacy of Alvesco (ciclesonide) Inhalation Aerosol in non-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_377314]-19 infection in this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo -controlled study. 
3.3 Rationale for Dose Selection and Treatment Duration 
The dose of ciclesonide selected for use in this study is 320 µg  twice daily ( BID), which is the 
currently approved highest recommended starting dose for Alvesco Inhalation Aerosol (Alvesco
® Inhalation Aerosol US  prescribing information, 2019).  Patients will be instructed to 
self-administer Alvesco Inhalation Aerosol (hereafter referred to as ciclesonide MDI ) or placebo 
MDI at a frequency of BID concurrently with standard supportive care for 30 days.  The duration 
of treatment is  consistent with the limited information available regarding time to discharge for 
patients in China without hypoxemia or respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506] (mean time to discharge 17 ± 4 days) (Pan et al, 2020).  
Because there are  no proven or approved treatments for COVID -19, all patients will also receive 
standard supportive care according to the treating facility’s standard. Covis Pharma GmbH, Ciclesonide Inhalation Aerosol

3.[ADDRESS_494591] population (80%; Verity et al, 2020) and have been 
determined as the population with the highest likelihood of benefit from ciclesonide treatment due to earlier intervention potentially decreasing viral replication and, therefore , viral load.  It is 
hypothesized that treatment with ciclesonide will decrease duration of clinical symptoms, thereby [CONTACT_394187]. 
The study will enroll male and female patients [ADDRESS_494592] been treated with 
inhaled or intranasal corticosteroids within 14 days of screening/enrollment/randomization or any patient who has received oral corticosteroids within 90 days of screening/enrollment/ randomization will be excluded from the study in order to minimize potential confounding of data from background steroid use.

investigational product discontinuation  
5. Population- level summary measure:  difference in survival distributions between  treatment 
regimens  
The treatment -policy strategy for this estimand is the difference in survival distributions of 
time to alleviation of COVID -19-related symptoms of cough, dyspnea, chills, feeling feverish, 
repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and new loss of taste or smell, 
defined as symptom-free for a continuous period of  ≥  24 hours (ie, ≥  3 AM/PM assessments) by 
[CONTACT_4475] 30 between those assigned to ciclesonide and those assigned to placebo, regardless of 
patient’s use of rescue medications, protocol violations, or investigational product discontinuation.  Therefore, for all patients in the intent- to-treat (ITT) analysis set, all observed 
on-study data will be analyzed in accordance with the definition set forth above for inter current 
events.  
Since death and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_394170]-outcome definition, a composite strategy will be used to handle these situations.  If a patient dies or is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], regardless of when it occurs, the value attributed in that scenario would be a failure to respond or achieve alleviation of COVID -19-related symptoms by [CONTACT_2054] 
(day 30).  This ascribes a sufficiently unfavorable outcome under these scenarios. Covis Pharma GmbH, Ciclesonide Inhalation Aerosol

4.3.2 Key Seconda ry Endpoint Estimand 
The attributes of the estimand for the key secondary  endpoint included in the multiplicity control 
procedure of this trial are: 
1. Treatment regimens:  ciclesonide and placebo  
2. Populations of interest: patients meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria grouped according to 
randomized treatment assignment reflect the target population  
3. Patient -level outcome:  binary indicator of alleviation of COVID-19-related symptoms of 
cough, dyspnea, chills, feeling feverish, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, 
sore throat, and new loss of taste or smell, defined as symptom-free for a continuous period 
of ≥ 24 hours (ie, ≥  3 AM/PM assessments) by [CONTACT_4475] 14  
4. Intercurrent events:  regardless of the use of rescue medications, protocol violations, or 
investigational product discontinuation  
5. Population- level summary measure:  difference in response probabilities between treatment 
regimens  
The treatment -policy strategy for this estimand is the difference in probabilities of alleviation 
of COVID -19-related symptoms of cough, dyspnea, chills, feeling feverish, repeated shaking 
with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and new loss of taste or smell, defined as 
symptom-free for a continuous period of  ≥  24 hours (ie, ≥  3 AM/PM assessmen ts) by [CONTACT_4475] 14 
between those assigned to ciclesonide and those assigned to placebo, regardless of patient’s use 
of rescue medications, protocol violations, or investigational product discontinuation.  Therefore, for all patients in the ITT analysis set, all observed on- study data will be analyzed in accordance 
with the definition set forth above for intercurrent events. 
Since death and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_394171]-outcome 
definition, a composite strategy will be u sed to handle these situations.  If a patient dies or is 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], then the value attributed in that scenario would be failure to achieve alleviation of COVID-19-related symptoms which ascribes the most unfavorable value.

5 STUDY DESCRIPTION  
5.1 Study Design 
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, efficacy, and 
safety study of ciclesonide MDI for the treatment of symptomatic COVID-19 infection.  Enrolled 
patients will be male and female adults and adolescents ≥  [ADDRESS_494597] of an initial screening/enrollment/randomization visit, a 30-day treatment period, and a follow-up period. 
Following signature [CONTACT_56534] (ICF) , patients meeting inclusion/exclusion 
criteria will be randomly assigned (1:1) to treatment with ciclesonide MDI 320 µg BID (
AM and 
PM) plus st andard supportive care (hereafter referred to as the ciclesonide arm) or placebo MDI 
BID ( AM and PM) plus standard supportive care (hereafter referred to as the placebo arm).  
During the initial screening/enrollment/randomization visit, patients will be in structed on how to 
self-administer a MDI and will be discharged home with a 30-day supply of investigational 
product (ie, either ciclesonide MDI or placebo MDI), standard supportive care, a pulse oximeter 
for at -home oxygen saturation level monitoring, and a n electronic diary (eDiary) .  
A nasopharyngeal sample for viral load analysis will also be obtained at the initial 
screening/enrollment/randomization visit.   Patients will be instructed to record 
self-administration of investigational product and  oxygen saturation levels in the eDiary .  
Prior to  self-administration of the investigational product (ie, within 1 hour of administration), 
patients will also complete and record assessments in the eDiary  of severity of 
COVID-19- related symptoms of cough, dyspnea, chills, and feeling feverish (based on a 
4-point scale where 0  = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe) and the presence/absence 
of COVID -19-related symptoms of repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore 
throat, and new los s of taste or smell.  Qualified healthcare providers will c ontact  patients on 
days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 21 ± 2 days, and 30 ± [ADDRESS_494598] 
adverse event  and concomitant medication information , and to confirm/clarify information 
recorded in the eDiary .  During these patient contacts, m edical advice commensurate with 
standard of care for reported symptoms or adverse events  will be provided.  On day 30 
(window of + 2 days) , the patient will return to the study site for collection of  a nasopharyngeal 
sample for viral load analysis and to return the eDiary  and investigational product (ie, used and 
unused MDIs).  Qualified healthcare providers will c ontact  patients on day  37 ± 4 days and day 
60 ± [ADDRESS_494599] follow -up safety and outcome data (the follow-up period). 
Patients (or their representatives) will be asked to notify study personnel directly in the event 
they visit an emergency department or are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_394160]. 
Patient duration on study is expected to be approximately 60 days, including the screening/ 
enrollment/randomization visit, the 30-day treatment period and the subsequent follow-up period.  In the event the patient requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48285] 30-day treatment period, the patient will discontinue investigational product and scheduled follow-up procedures but will continue to be followed for the outcome of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_394161] (see section  5.3.4) .

7.1.2 Efficacy Assessments 
[IP_ADDRESS] Assessment  of COVID-19-Related Symptoms of Cough, Dys pnea, Chills, and 
Feeling Feverish  
Patients will assess severity of COVID-19-related symptoms of cough, dyspnea, chills, and 
feeling feverish using a 4- point scale where 0  = absent, 1  = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe.  
Assessment of these symptoms will be performed predose during the screening/enrollment/ 
randomization visit.  During the 30- day treatment period, patients will be instructed to assess 
these [ADDRESS_494617] (ie, within 1 hour of administration).  The patient will record results in the eDiary.  Covis Pharma GmbH, Ciclesonide Inhalation Aerosol

 
[IP_ADDRESS] Presenc
e/Absence of COVID-19- Related Symptoms of Repeated Shaking with 
Chills, Muscle Pain, Headache, Sore Throat, and New Loss of Taste or Smell 
Patients will assess the presence/absence of COVID-19- related symptoms of repeated shaking 
with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and new loss of taste or smell.  Assessment of 
these symptoms will be performed predose during the screening/enrollment/randomization visit.  During the 30- day treatment period, patients will be instructed to assess presence/absence of 
these symptoms at a frequency of BID prior to self -administration of the investigational product 
(ie, within 1 hour of administration).  The patient will record results in the eDiary. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Oxygen Saturation Levels Oxygen saturation levels will be measured  predose during the screening/enrollment/ 
randomization visit.  During the 30- day treatment period, patients will be instructed to measure 
oxygen saturation levels (using the provided pulse oximeter) at a frequency of BID.  The patient 
will record results of all as sessments in the eDiary.  The patient will be instructed to seek 
medical attention immediately  should oxygen saturation levels fall to 93% or below . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Viral Load Analysis 
A nas opharyngeal swab for viral load analysis will be collected by [CONTACT_394193]/enrollment/randomization visit and on day 30 (window of + 2 days).  For 
each patient, the same nostril should be used for collection of samples at both time points , if 
possible.  Sample collection, handling, labeling, storage, shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and methods of analysis will be performed according to procedures specified in separate documents. 
7.2 Safety 
7.2.1 Safety Endpoint 
Safety will be assessed based on adverse events.  
7.2.2 Safety Assessments 
Adverse events will be recorded starting with the signing of the ICF .  Adverse events occurring 
during the screening/enrollment/randomization visit will be recorded by [CONTACT_394194].  Information regarding adverse events occurring during the 30-day treatment period and post-treatment adverse events occurring during the follow-up period will be collected  by 
[CONTACT_394195]. 
Any new infection that occurs on study, regardless of the infecting agent (ie, viral or non- viral) 
should be captured as an adverse event.  In these cases, the site of infection and source of culture (eg, bronchoalveolar lavage, tracheal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337], sputum, blood, urine) should be recorded. 
Section  [ADDRESS_494618] in this study is  ciclesonide MDI  (supplied as Alvesco Inhala tion 
Aerosol, 160 µg) or a matching placebo MDI; all patients will also receive standard supportive 
COVID-[ADDRESS_494619] will be self -administered by [CONTACT_394196] 
(2 actuations  in the AM and 2 actuations  in the PM) for 30 days.  During the initial 
screening/enrollment/randomization visit, patients will be provided with investigational product for the duration of the 30-day treatment period and will be instructed on how to appropriately self-administer a MDI.  For pa tients in the ciclesonide arm, the total daily dose will be 640  µg 
(320 µg BID).   Patients will be instructed to rinse their mouth with water following inhalation of 
investigational product. 
8.2 Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups 
Following signature [CONTACT_48028], patients meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomly 
assigned (1:1) to treatment with ciclesonide MDI [ADDRESS_494620] met the necessary criteria and are ready to be randomized.  
All patients  will be assigned  a unique patient  number during the 
screening/enrollment/randomization visit .  After  a patient  number has  been  assigned, the 
number will not be reused even if  the patient withdraws  before receiving  any study drug. 
8.3 Blinding 
Patients and investigators/study personnel will be blinded to study treatment assignment.  
8.[ADDRESS_494621] will be administered following randomization during the screening/enrollment /randomization visit and recorded by [CONTACT_394197] .  During the 
30-day treatment period, patients will enter the dosing regimen taken (number of actuations, date, and time) BID  in the eDiary .  Patients should make every attempt to maintain consistency 
in the dosing schedule. 
Qualified healthcare providers  will c ontact  patients on days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 21 ± 2 days, 
and 30 ± [ADDRESS_494622] adverse event  and concomitant medication 
informa tion, and to confirm/clarify information recorded in the eDiary (including treatment 
compliance).  Based on these compliance checks, the patient may be counseled about the 
importance of taking the investigational product as instructed. Covis Pharma GmbH, Ciclesonide Inhalation Aerosol

8.5.[ADDRESS_494625] Handling and Disposal 
The sponsor will supply investigational products only to the investigator or designee.  The investigator or designee (eg, site pharmacist) is responsible for inventory, storage, and 
dispensing of investigational products.  The investigator will not allow use of the investigational products other than as directed by [CONTACT_3181]. 
The patient will retur n investigational product (ie, used and unused MDIs) to the study site 
during their visit on day 30 (window of + 2 days).  In the event the patient is withdrawn from the 
study, they should be instructed to return the investigational product to the study si te in a timely 
manner.  Covis Pharma GmbH, Ciclesonide Inhalation Aerosol

 
All u

Patien
ts who received treatment with inhaled or intranasal corticosteroids within 14 days or oral 
corticosteroids within 90 days of the screening/enrollment/randomization visit are excluded from 
study participation .  Patients are also excluded from study participation if they are participating 
in any other clinical study or have used any investigational agent within 30 days of the screening/enrollment/randomization visit or if they are currently receiving treatment with hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine.  These medications are also prohibited for the duration of the study. Covis Pharma GmbH, Ciclesonide Inhalation Aerosol

 
[ADDRESS_494628].  Any worsening of the patient’s disease under study or other medical conditions will also be considered to be an adverse event , unless it is within the normal range of 
disease fluctuation for that patient. 
Any new infection that occurs on study, regardless of the infecting agent (ie, viral or non- viral) 
should be captured as an adverse event.  In these cases, the site of infection and source of culture 
(eg, bronchoalveolar lavage, tracheal aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337], sputum, blood, urine) should be recorded. 
9.2 Reporting of Adverse Events 
Adverse events will be recorded starting with the signing of the ICF .  Adverse events occurring 
during the screening/enrollment/randomization visit will be recorded by [CONTACT_394202].  Information regarding adverse events occurring during the 30-day treatment period and 
post-treatment adverse events occurring during the follow-up period will be collected by [CONTACT_394195]. 
Investigators will review the reported adverse events on a regular basis during the course of the 
study.  A DMC  will conduct a review of blinded safety data once [ADDRESS_494629] been 
enrolled (see section  10.9 ). 
9.2.1 Severity of Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be graded for severity as follows: 
• Mild is defined as causing no limitation of usual activities.  
• Moderate is defined as causing some limitation of usual activities.  
• Severe is defined as causing inability to carry out usual activities. 
Severity of adverse events occurring during the screening/enrollment/randomization visit will be recorded by [CONTACT_394202].  Severity information for each adverse event occurring during the 30-day treatment period and post -treatment adverse events occurring during 
the follow-up period will be obtained by [CONTACT_394203].  
It should be noted that a severe adverse event need not be serious in nature and that a serious adverse event  need not, by [CONTACT_108], be s evere.  Covis Pharma GmbH, Ciclesonide Inhalation Aerosol

 
9.2.[ADDRESS_494630]  
The investigator will be asked to document his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_394176]: 
• Not related - The event can be readily explained by [CONTACT_102]’s underlying medical 
condition or concomitant therapy, and no relationship exists between the investigational product and the event. 
• Unlikely related - The temporal relationship between the event and the administration of the investigational product is uncertain, and the event can most likely be explained by [CONTACT_102]’s medical condition or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
• Possibly related - There is some logical temporal relationship between the event and the administration of the investigational product, and the event is unlikely to be explained by [CONTACT_102]’s medical condition or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
• Related - The temporal relationship is compelling between the administration of the investigational product, and the event cannot be explained by [CONTACT_102]’s medical condition or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
9.2.[ADDRESS_494631] will be documented as follows: 
• No change 
• Drug interrupted 
• Drug withdrawn 
• Not applicable 
• Unknown 
9.2.4 Outcome 
The outcome of the adverse event will b e documented as follows: 
• Recovered/resolved  
• Recovered/resolved with sequelae  
• Recovering/resolving 
• Not recovered/not resolved 
• Fatal  
• Unknown Covis Pharma GmbH, Ciclesonide Inhalation Aerosol

9.[ADDRESS_494632] medical occurrence that, at any dose: 
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening 
• Requires patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_73606] 
• Results in persistent or significant disability and/or incapacity  
• Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the patient 
was at immediate risk of death at the time of the serious adverse event .  It does not refer to a 
serious adverse event  that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the patient or may 
require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above.  These should also be considered to be serious adverse events. 
9.4 Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
All serious adverse event s that occur during the course of the study from the time informed 
consent is signed and up to the patient’s study completion or discontinuation, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the investigational product, must be reported by [CONTACT_68477]’s safety reporting group as described in the Sa fety Reporting 
Instructions.  In the event that the investigator becomes aware of a serious adverse event  that 
occurred after the patient completes or discontinues from the study, and the serious adverse event is suspected to be related to investigational product, it must be reported to the sponsor’s safety reporting group.  Any special reporting requirements are described in the Sa fety Reporting 
Instructions. 
All serious adverse event s must be reported within [ADDRESS_494633] becomes aware of the event.  Serious Adverse Event Report Forms will be provided to each 
study site.  Details on the process of reporting can be found in the Sa fety Reporting Instructions.  
The completed Serious Adverse Event Form should be sent to Premier Research by [CONTACT_290552]: 
 
 Covis Pharma GmbH, Ciclesonide Inhalation Aerosol

 
For al
l serious, unexpected adverse events potentially related to the use of the investigational 
product, Covis or its designee will notify the appropriate regulatory authorities and all 
participating investigators in accordance with ICH guidelines and local safety reporting requirements.  It is the responsibility of the investigator to notify the Institutional Review 
Board  (IRB) of all unexpected serious adverse drug reactions involving risk to human subjects in 
compliance with their IRB reporting requirements. 
Each serious adverse event must be followed until its resolution  or its resolution with sequelae.  
Any follow-up information to a serious adverse event must be reported to the sponsor within 
[ADDRESS_494634] supportive care.  The primary endpoint is time to  alleviation  of COVID -19-related symptoms of cough, dyspnea, chills, feeling 
feverish, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and new loss of taste 
or smell, defined as symptom-free for a continuous period of ≥  24 hours (ie, ≥  3 
AM/PM 
assessments)  by [CONTACT_4475] 30.  The Cox proportional hazards model will be used to compare treatment 
arms with respect to time to alleviation (or recovery) of COVID -19-related symptoms as defined 
in the primary endpoint.  Total number of events (recoveries) as well as the expected rate of 
recove ry (or hazard ratio) for treatment compared to placebo are key determinants of power.  
The expected  median survival time is  approximately 7 days for the ciclesonide arm and  
approximately 11 days for the placebo arm  (hazard ratio of approximately 1.58) with  a total 
study duration of 30 days.  For 90% power, approximately 201 events (recoveries) are required 
to detect this anticipated increase in rate of recovery between ciclesonide and placebo.  A sample 
size of 232 patients (116 per arm) is required to achi eve the specified 90% power at an α = 0.[ADDRESS_494635] the overall power of the study, the planned sample size was 
increased to 400 patients (200 in each arm) for this study.  Note that these are best estimates at this point as there is still much uncertainty regarding COVID-19. 
10.[ADDRESS_494636] (either ciclesonide MDI or placebo MDI ).  Safety analyses will compare groups defined 
by [CONTACT_394205].  The ITT population will include all randomized patients.  Analyses conducted on the efficacy dataset will be on an ITT basis where the treatment groups 
are defined by [CONTACT_394206]. 
Any additional analysis sets will be defined in the SAP. 
10.3 Statistical Methods  
10.3.1 General Principles 
Summary statistics will be presented by [CONTACT_1570].  For continuous variables, unless 
otherwise stated, the number of available observations (n), mean, standard deviation, median, and range will be provided.  For categorical variables, the number and percentage in each category will be determined. Covis Pharma GmbH, Ciclesonide Inhalation Aerosol

10.4 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographics and baseli ne characteristics, medical history, baseline physical examination 
findings, baseline vital sign data, baseline height, baseline weight, and baseline body mass index 
will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_1570]. 
10.5 Patient Disposition 
Patient disp osition will be summarized, including the reasons for discontinuation.  The number 
of patients in each analysis population will be displayed and an accounting of exclusions from each study population will be provided. 
10.6 Concomitant Medications 
Concomitant medications will be tabulated by [CONTACT_394207] (WHO) drug, preferred term, and treatment group.  A medication’s usage will be considered concomitant if it was started or continued after administration of investigational product .  If the start date is missing, it will be assumed that the medication was 
used concomitantly. 
10.7 Analysis of Efficacy Data 
10.7.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy variable is time to  alleviation  of COVID -19-related s ymptoms of cough, 
dyspnea, chills, feeling feverish, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, 
and new loss of taste or smell, defined as symptom-free for a continuous period of ≥  24 hours 
(ie, ≥ 3 AM/PM assessments) by [CONTACT_4475] 30.  The primary analysis will be based on the ITT 
population (all randomized patients).  To improve the precision of treatment effect estimation 
and inference, baseline covariate adjustments will be made for gender, age, race, and body mass index, as these are known COVID-19 risk factors.  A Cox proportional hazards model will be used to allow for inclusion of these additional covariates.  The median time to event and 95% confidence interval s will be summarized by [CONTACT_2939], and Kaplan -Meier estimates of 
the survival curves will also be generated.  
The SAP will describe how missing data will be handled in the primary analysis.  In addition, a sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint will be conducted using a tippi[INVESTIGATOR_394177].  Details will be provided in the SAP.  Covis Pharma GmbH, Ciclesonide Inhalation Aerosol

free for a continuous period of ≥  24 hours (ie, ≥  3 AM/PM assessments) by [CONTACT_4475] 7, by [CONTACT_4475] 14, and 
by [CONTACT_4475] [ADDRESS_494638] estimation and inference, baseline covariate adjustments will be made for gender, age, race, and body mass index, as these are known COVID-19 risk factors.  Analysis of the secondary efficacy endpoint of time to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_394180] .  The secondary efficacy 
endpoint of change from baseline in oxygen saturation levels will be summarized descriptively at all time  points captured in the eDiary.  The secondary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline 
in COVID -19 viral load in nasopharyngeal sample at day 30 will be summ arized descriptively.  
10.7.3 Multiple Comparisons 
In order to control the overall Type I error rate for the analyses of the planned primary and secondary endpoints, a fixed-sequence method will be utilized.  Under this methodology, all endpoints will be or dered sequentially; testing will begin with the first endpoint (primary 
endpoint) at the full alpha level and continue through the sequence only until an endpoint is not statistically significant.  The sequence of testing will be as follows: 
1. Time to alleviation of COVID -19-related symptoms of cough, dyspnea, chills, feeling 
feverish, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and new loss of 
taste or smell, defined as symptom-free for a continuous period of ≥  24 hours (ie, ≥  3 
AM/PM 
assessments) by [CONTACT_4475] 30 
2. Percentage of patients with alleviation of COVID -19-related symptoms of cough, dyspnea, 
chills, feeling feverish, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, and

10.8 Analysis of Safety Data 
The incidence of adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_12513] (MedDRA) body system classification and preferred term.  All treatment- emergent 
adverse events will be summarized overall and for each body system and prefer red term by 
[CONTACT_1570], relationship to investigational product, and severity.  For tabulations by [CONTACT_926], only a patient’s most severe event within the category (eg, overall, body system, or preferred term) will be counted.  “Treatment- emergent” wi ll be defined as starting or worsening 
after the first dose of investigational product.  If the start date is missing, the event is assumed to be treatment -emergent.  All serious adverse event s will be tabulated.  
In order to understand specific adverse events of special interest (eg, oral candidiasis), analyses will be conducted to compare the treatment arms with respect to differences in cumulative incidence rates with accompanying confidence intervals.  Details will be provided in the SAP.

13.1 Case Report Forms/Source Data Handling 
Source documents and source data will be captured electronically in this trial and will meet the 
same fundamental elements of data quality (eg, attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, and accurate) as paper records.  These data will be collected into a DDC system also known as the eSource that is fully validated according to [ADDRESS_494642] as the original point of data capture, there is no additional data entry step for the study site for data collected directly into the application; rather, the electronic source record 
directly populates the trial database.  At the end of the study, the investigator must certify that the data entered into the eSource system  are complete and accurate.  After database lock, the 
investigator will receive an electronic copy of the subject data.  
The investigator, or designee, will enter study data required by [CONTACT_394212] .  The eSource system has a variety of validations progr ammed which direct the site user 
to collect clean and complete data in the moment as well as clear indicators of incomplete forms so that they can be followed up on in a timely manner.  Clinical research associates will also remotely monitor the collected data via an online portal to review for completeness and accuracy.  Any questions about the collected data can be queried within the eSource system by [CONTACT_394213].  Appropriate study site personnel should then address th ose queries within the eSource system which will maintain a comprehensive audit trail.  
Uniform procedures for addressing queries will be discussed during system training as well as the study site initiation visits and will be documented in a da ta management plan . 
Designated data captured in the eSource system will automatically be included into the clinical database as specified in the da ta management plan.  Quality control and data validation 
procedures will be applied to ensure the validity and accuracy of the clinical database.  
Computerized and manual procedures should be used to review and check data within the eSource system  for omissions, apparent errors, and values that may require further clarification.  
Data queries requiring clarification  should be initiated within the eSource system for the study 
site to review and resolve.  Only authorized personnel can make corrections to the clinical database, and all corrections will be documented in the system audit trail.  
Adverse events will be coded using the most current MedDRA version.  Prior and concomitant medications will be coded according to the WHO Drug Dictionary. Covis Pharma GmbH, Ciclesonide Inhalation Aerosol

CONTROLLED & CONFIDENTIAL  Study Procedures  The study will consist of nine cli nic visits.  
 
Visit 1 (Day -30 to - 1): Screening.  Subjects can be screened for the study up 
to 30 days before Visit 2/Baseline. During Visit 1/Screening, the study 
requirements will be reviewed and written informed consent must be 
obtained prior to the initiation of any study -related procedures. 
Demographics, inclusions/exclusion criteria, medical history, and 
concomitant medications and procedures/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_28202]. A brief physical examination and vital signs will be 
perfo rmed. Height and weight will also be measured. Blood and urine 
samples will be taken for clinical laboratory tests (chemistry, hematology, 
and urinalysis) and a UPT (if applicable). Identification and clinical 
evaluations of Target Plaques (IGA, Target Pla que Area, Clinical Signs and 
Symptoms including Local Psoriasis Severity Index [LPSI], and Target 
Plaque Comparison) will be performed. If applicable, the washout from 
prohibited medications or treatments will be determined and implemented. 
The subject wil l be scheduled for Visit 2/Baseline.  
 
Visit 2 (Day 1): Baseline.  The subject will return to the clinic and be queried 
for any changes in health status since the previous visit, including 
concomitant medications and procedures/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Vital signs and UPT (if 
applicable) will be performed. Identification of two Target  Plaques will be 
re-confirmed and clinical evaluations of Target Plaques (IGA, Target Plaque 
Area, Clinical Signs and Symptoms including LPSI, and Target Plaque 
Comparison) will be performed. Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for Pruritus 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_28226]. Photography 
will be performed. Local skin reactions (LSRs) will be assessed prior to test 
article application. The subject will be randomized by [CONTACT_28227] (lowest) test article kit number in asc ending order. A Subject Diary 
and Subject Instruction Sheet will be dispensed. Subjects will be instructed 
on how to apply the test articles, perform occlusion, take a photograph once 
daily until the next clinic visit, and to record applications in the Sub ject 
Diary. Test article accountability will be documented. The first doses and 
occlusion will be applied at the site under supervision of study staff. LSRs 
will be assessed [ADDRESS_27528] article application. Adverse events 
(AEs) will be record ed. The subject will be scheduled for Visit 3.  
 
Visit 3 (Day 8 ± 1): Week 1, Visit 4 (Day 15 ± 2): Week 2, and Visit 5 (Day 
22 ± 2): Week 3. The subject will return to the clinic and be queried for any 
changes in health status since the previous visit, inc luding concomitant 
medications and procedures/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Photography and clinical evaluations 
of Target Plaques (IGA, Clinical Signs and Symptoms including LPSI, and 
Target Plaque Comparison) will be performed. Visit 4 only:  NRS for 
Pruritus will be assess ed by [CONTACT_28228].  LSRs will be assessed. A new Subject Instruction Sheet will be 
dispensed, if necessary. It is also important to review proper use of the 
“correct” test article for each of the two Target Plaques –  emphasizing 
the importance to use the same labeled test article on the same Target 
Plaque for the duration of the study.  Subject Diary will be collected, 
reviewed, and dispensed. Test article accountability will be documented. The 
site staff will remind the subject to continue to apply the test articles, perform 
occlusion, take a photograph once daily until the next clinic visit, and to

status since the previous visit, including concomitant medications and 
procedures/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. A directed physical examination, vital signs, and/or 
clinical laboratory tests will be performed if any of the results from the 
preceding visit are ma terially abnormal and clinically significant. 
Photography and clinical evaluations of Target Plaques (IGA, Clinical Signs 
and Symptoms including LPSI, and Target Plaque Comparison) will be 
performed. LSRs and AEs will be documented. The subject will be 
scheduled for the next visit, as appropriate.  
 
Visit 9 (Day 57 ± 3): End of Study (EOS).  The subject will return to the clinic 
and be queried for any changes in health status since the previous visit, 
including concomitant medications and procedures/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . A directed 
physical examination, vital signs, and/or clinical laboratory tests will be 
performed if any of the results from the preceding visit are materially 
abnormal and clinically significant. Photography and clinical evaluations of 
Target Plaques (IG A, Target Plaque Area, Clinical Signs and Symptoms 
including LPSI, and Target Plaque Comparison) will be performed. NRS for 
Pruritus will be assessed by [CONTACT_423]. LSRs and AEs will be documented. 
The subject will exit the study.  
Study Measurements  
 The following study measurements will be performed according to the 
Schedule of Events. The IGA, Clinical Signs of Psoriasis including LPSI, 
and the Target Plaque Area will be assessed individually for the two Target 
Plaques . Ideally the same evaluator should  grade a given subject during the 
entire study.   
 
Efficacy : 
Investigator’s Global Assessment  
The IGA score is a static evaluation of the overall or “average” degree of 
severity of each of the two Target Plaques by [CONTACT_28229]. This evaluation takes into 
consideration the three individual characteristics of psoriasis (plaque 
elevation, scaling, and erythema) with the IGA score at each visit 
representing the average of plaque elevation , scaling, or erythema  that is

CONTROLLED & CONFIDENTIAL  Clinical Signs of Psoriasis and Local Psoriasis Severity Index  
Plaque elevation (induration), scaling, and erythema will each be scored on 
a 5-point scale where 0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 
4 = severe. These evaluations are an assessment of the overall or “average” 
degree of each of three key characteristics present within each of the two 
Target Plaques by [CONTACT_28230] T arget 
Plaque. The LPSI is defined as the sum of scoring for plaque elevation, 
scaling, and erythema. LPSI will range from [ADDRESS_27529] individually be a minimum of 6 cm2 and a maximum o f 
64 cm2 in area.  
 
Target Plaque Comparison Score  
The overall appearance of the two individual Target Plaques will be 
evaluated as follows: Target Plaque A is better than Target Plaque B, Target 
Plaque A is the same as Target Plaque B, or Target Plaque A i s worse than 
Target Plaque B. This evaluation will not be a comparison with the condition 
at a previous visit, but a comparison of the two Target Plaques to determine 
which one appears better than the other. Note: the two plaques may have 
identical IGA sco res but still be different based upon the comparison score.  
 
Score  Comparison  
1A Target Plaque A is better than Target Plaque B  
0 Target Plaque A is the same as Target Plaque B  
1B Target Plaque A is worse than Target Plaque B  
 
Numeric Rating Scale for Pruritus  
Pruritus will be assessed using the Itch Numeric Rating Scale (I -NRS), a self -
administered Patient Reported Outcome questionnaire. Subjects will indicate 
itch severity for each target lesion by [CONTACT_28231] 24 hours on an 11 -point 
scale anchored at 0, representing “no itching” and 10, representing, “worst 
itch imaginable”  The study staff should review the NRS for Pruritus with 
each subject and ask them to indicate t he response that best describes their 
experience. Pruritus assessed by [CONTACT_28232].  
 
Digital Photography  
Digital photographic records of the two Target Plaques (A & B) will be 
generated for each plaque  site at each visit  (except Visit 1/Screening) before 
the first application of test article.  To help with treatment identification, each 
Target Plaque  site will be marked by a specific label on the photographs

much as possible,  to enable proper comparisons to be made as detailed in the 
Study Photo Guide.  
 
Safety:  
Adverse Events  
All AEs will be recorded. At each visit (except Visit 1/Screening), subjects 
will also be question ed specifically about the status of any ongoing AEs.  
 
Brief Physical Examination  
A brief physical exam will be performed at Visit 1/Screening and 
Visit 6/EOT. The exam will include examination of head and neck, 
dermatological, cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal (abdomen), and 
gross motor and gait. Abnormalities at Visit 1/Screening will be recorded as 
medical history. Any new or worsening abnormalities at Visit 6/EOT (and 
subsequent visits, if applicable) will be recorded as AEs. Directed physical 
exams will be performed at subsequent follow -up visits until the finding has 
resolved or stabilized in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871].  
 
Vital Signs  
Vital signs including temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart 
rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_28203] e will be measured at Visit 1/Screening, 
Visit 2/Baseline, and Visit 6/EOT. Assessments will also be performed at 
any subsequent follow -up visits if the results from the preceding visit are 
materially abnormal and clinically significant in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1101] t he 
investigator. Assessments will be made after the subject has rested in a seated 
position for at least five minutes. Height and weight will only be measured 
at Visit 1/Screening.  
 
Clinical Laboratory Tests  
Urine and blood samples will be collected from each subject for safety 
laboratory analysis at Visit 1/Screening and Visit 6/EOT. Clinical laboratory 
tests will also be performed at any subsequent follow -up visits if the results 
from the preceding visit are materially abnormal and clinically significant  in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. Any new or worsening clinically significant 
abnormalities at Visit 6/EOT (and subsequent visits, if applicable) will be 
recorded as AEs.  
 
Urine Pregnancy Tests   
A UPT will be performed at Visit 1/Screening, Visit 2/Base line, and 
Visit 6/EOT for WOCBP.  
 
Local Skin Reactions  
LSRs (burning/stinging, edema, and folliculitis) will be assessed at every 
visit (except Visit 1/Screening) using a 4 -point ordinal scale (0=none, 
1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe). Only LSRs that require medical 
intervention (e.g., prescription medication) will be documented as AEs. Any 
LSRs that are not listed above will be recorded as AEs.

CONTROLLED & CONFIDENTIAL  Sample Size 
Calculations  This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], proof of concept study, therefore, no formal sample size 
calculations were performed for this study.  
Statistical Methods  All statistical processing will be performed using SAS®. Summary tables 
(descriptive statistics and/or frequency tables) will be provided for Screening 
and/or Baseline variables, efficacy variables, and safety variables. Continuous 
variables will be described by [CONTACT_9086] (n, mean, median, standard 
deviation [SD], minimum, and maximum). Frequency counts and percentage 
of sub jects within each category will be provided for categorical data. 
Summaries will be provided for each treatment group.  
 
Study Populations:  
The Safety population will include all randomized subjects who received and 
applied test article. The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will include all 
randomized subjects who were dispensed the test article. The per -protocol (PP) 
population will include a subset of the ITT population who completed the study 
without significant protocol deviations (as will be determined prior to 
unblinding the randomization).  
 
Efficacy Analyses:  
The efficacy analyses will be conducted on the ITT and PP populations.  
 
For endpoints of change from Baseline, the comparison between DUR -[ADDRESS_27532] with a  significant alpha level 
of 0.05.  
 
For endpoints of treatment success outcomes, the comparison between 
DUR -928 and VEH will be conducted using McNemar’s test with a 
significant alpha level of 0.05.  
 
The within subject difference in the change scores and Target Plaque 
Comparison score between DUR -928 and VEH will also be calculated and 
summarized descriptively.  
 
Dosing Compliance  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize for each treatment group the 
duration of treatment (defined as last dose date –  first dose date +1), the total 
number of applications (determined from the doses reported in the Subject 
Diary), and the percent of expected doses applied for the ITT and PP 
populations. Subjects who apply at least 70% of the expected total number 
of appl ications and have no other evidence of material dosing non -
compliance will be considered to be compliant with test article dosing.  
 
Safety Analyses:  
The safety analyses will be conducted on the Safety population.

CONTROLLED & CONFIDENTIAL  3. OBJECTIVE  
The primary objective of this trial is to determine and compare the safety, tolerability, and 
efficacy of DUR -[ADDRESS_27538] two similar contralateral Target Plaques as described 
in Section  5.1.1. Approximately 20 subjects will be enrolled at approximately three study 
sites to obtain about 15 evaluable subjects. The maximum proportion of subjects to be 
enrolled with mild plaque psoriasis is approximately 25% of the total enrolled subjects.  Each subject will receive both of the following treatments with occlusion: 
1. DUR -[ADDRESS_27539] articles once daily to the two Target Plaques at approximately the same time and follow the instructions for application and occlusion. Subjects will be allowed to use triamcinolone cream, 0.1% and/or over the counter (OTC) hydrocortisone ointment or cream 1% or 0.5% on the face/neck, trunk, buttocks, and lower 
extremities only no more than twice daily . Subjects will also be allowed to use a bland 
emollient on all areas (face/neck , trunk, buttocks, lower extremities, upper extremities) that 
are not designated Target Plaques no more than twice daily. There will be nine study visits. Efficacy will be measured through Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA), Clinical Signs and Symptoms  of Psoriasis including Local Psoriasis Severity Index (LPSI), Target Plaque 
Area, and Target Plaque Comparison assessments by [CONTACT_28244] a blinded fashion. Efficacy will also be measured using the subject -assessed Numeric Rating 
Scale (NRS) for Pruritus. Safety will be measured by [CONTACT_28245], vital 
signs, clinical laboratory tests, urine pregnancy tests (UPTs, if applicable), local skin reactions (LSRs), and adverse events (AEs).

Plaque elevation (induration), scaling, and erythema will each be scored on a 5- point scale 
where 0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. These evaluations are an assessment of the overall or “average” degree of each of three key characteristics present within each of the two Target Plaques by [CONTACT_28255].

CONTROLLED & CONFIDENTIAL  10.2 Safety Evalu ations  
10.2.1  Brief Physical Examination  
A brief physical exam will be performed at Visit 1/Screening and Visit 6/EOT. The exam 
will include examination of head and neck, dermatological, cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], 
gastrointestinal (abdomen), and gross motor and  gait. Abnormalities at Visit 1/Screening 
will be recorded as medical history. Any new or worsening abnormalities at Visit 6/EOT 
(and subsequent visits, if applicable) will be recorded as AEs. Directed physical exams will 
be performed at subsequent follow -up visits until the finding has resolved or stabilized in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871].  
10.2.2  Vital Signs  
Vital signs including temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_28212] 1/Screening, Visit 2/Baseline, and Visit 6/EOT. 
Assessments will also be performed at any subsequent follow -up visits if the results from 
the preceding visit are materially abnormal and clinically significant in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070]. Assessments will be made  after the subject has rested in a seated position for 
at least five minutes. Height and weight will only be measured at Visit 1/Screening.  
10.2.3  Local Skin Reactions  
LSRs (burning/stinging, edema, and folliculitis) will be assessed for each Target Plaque at 
every visit (except Screening) using a 4 -point ordinal scale (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 
3=severe). Only LSRs that require medical intervention (e.g., prescription medication) will 
be documented as AEs. Any LSRs that are not listed above will be recorded as AEs.  
11. PHOTOGRAPHY  
Photography documentation is required in this study. Photographs taken as part of this 
study will be used to document the effects of treatment, AEs, or other findings during the 
study. All subjects will be asked to consent to the collectio n of photographs of their Target 
Plaques. Digital photographic records of the two Target Plaques (A & B) will be generated 
for each plaque site before the first application of test article and at each subsequent visit.  
To help with treatment identification, each Target Plaque  site will be marked by a specific 
label on the photographs taken. Photographs of test sites will be taken under identical 
conditions , as much as possible, to enable proper comparisons to be made as  detailed in 
the Study Photo Guide. Photographs shall be used as supportive documentation of efficacy 
and safety outcomes for this study but are not to be used by [CONTACT_28256] . An independent photo review may be performed at the discretion 
of the Sponsor. Any photographs taken of readily identifiable features (e.g., the face) will 
be de -identified (i.e., a masking bar over the eyes). In addition, photographs may be taken 
at the discretion of the investigator at an y time to document the subject’s progress in the 
study, AEs, or other findings of note.

CONTROLLED & CONFIDENTIAL  Note: Subjects who decline to have photographs taken during the conduct of study may not 
participate in the study given that photography is required. If a subject init ially consents to 
photographs, then declines further photography, the Sponsor may use the photographs 
taken under consent for the purposes noted above.  
 
Subjects will also be instructed to take daily photographs of the treatment area during the 
occlusion s tep. At each visit, the daily photographs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_28257]. Daily photographs will not be collected or used as supportive 
documentation of efficacy or safety outcomes for this study.  
12. LABORATORY TESTS  
12.[ADDRESS_27551] for safety laboratory analysis 
at Visit 1/Screening and Visit 6/EOT; clinical laboratory tests will also be performed at 
any subsequent follow -up visits if the  results from the preceding visit are materially 
abnormal and clinically significant in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. Subjects must be 
fasting (approximately 8 hours) for Visit  1/Screening and, if possible, for Visit 6/EOT (and 
subsequent visits, if applicable); however, if a subject arrives at the clinic for Visit 6/EOT 
(or subsequent visits, if applicable) without fasting for at least eight hours, laboratory 
specimens may be collected as non -fasting, at the discretion of the investigator, and with 
the appropriate fasting status documented on the lab requisition form. Any new or 
worsening clinically significant abnormalities at Visit 6/EOT (and subsequent visits, if 
applicable) will be recorded as AEs. At the discretion of the investigator, clinical labo ratory 
tests can be conducted at additional visits.

A UPT will be performed at Visit 1/Screening, Visit 2/Baseline, and Visit 6/EOT for 
WOCBP.  
 
The UPTs will be performed at the study site, if the site is registered and conforms to 
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) regulations for such testing 
(possesses a current valid CLIA Certificate of Waiver), or at an appropriately registered  
reference laboratory. The investigator will report the UPT results on the eCRFs, in the 
subject’s medical records, and in independent records maintained at the study site. The 
UPT used must have a minimum sensitivity of 25 mIU of β -hCG/mL.  
13. END OF STUDY CRITERIA  
At the end of each subject’s participation in the study, the investigator will complete an 
End of Study Disposition form for all completed and discontinued subjects.  
13.1 Completion of the Study  
Subjects who complete the four -week course of treatment as  specified in this protocol and 
return for Visit 9/EOS will be considered to have completed the study.

due to an AE then it should be classified as withdrawal due to an AE  
• Other (e.g., any reason that may affect the outcome of the study or safety of 
subjects)  
 
If a subject withdraws from the study prematurely for any reason, the site should make 
every effort to have the subject return to the clinic to perform all of the required visit 
activities for Visit [ADDRESS_27553] articles (if applicable). If the subject will not return to the clinic, the 
site should make every attempt to cont act the subject; otherwise the subject will be 
considered lost to follow -up. 
 
When a subject is withdrawn from the study for a test article related AE (as defined in 
Section  14.2), when possible, the subject should be followed until resolution or 
stabilization of the AE. If the subject is discontinued from the study due to pregnancy, the 
pregnancy and its outcome should be followed.  
 
Subjects who are prematurely withdrawn or discontinued from the study will be replaced 
until approximately [ADDRESS_27554] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
 
An AE (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with 
the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. An AE can arise from any use of

CONTROLLED & CONFIDENTIAL  the drug (e.g., off -label use, use in combination with any drug) and from any route of 
administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
 
A suspected adverse reaction  is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the dr ug caused the event. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the drug and the AE.  
 
An adverse reaction  is any AE caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all 
suspected adverse reactions for which  there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the 
event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality 
than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug. For the purposes of 
prescription drug labeling, the t erm adverse reaction means an undesirable effect, 
reasonably associated with the use of a drug that may occur as part of its pharmacological 
action or may be unpredictable in its occurrence.  
 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
Investigator Brochure (IB) or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been 
observed; or, if an IB is not required or available, the event is considered “unexpected” if 
it is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan 
or elsewhere in the current application. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis 
would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14213]) if the IB referred only to elevated 
hepatic enzymes or hepatitis . Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis 
would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14214]) if the IB listed only cerebral vascular 
accidents. "Unexpected," as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or suspected adverse 
reacti ons that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated 
from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as 
occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
 
Timely and complete reporting of all AEs assists the Sponsor and/or their designee in 
identifying any untoward medical occurrence, thereby [CONTACT_17155]:  
1) protection of the safety of study subjects;  
2) a greater understanding of the overall safety profile of the test article;  
3) recognition of dose -related test article toxicity;  
4) appropriate modification of study protocols;  
5) improvements in study design or procedures; and  
6) adherence to worldwide regulatory requirements.

(SAEs, see Section 14.3). If possible, the outcome of any AEs  that caused permanent 
discontinuation or that were present at the end of the study, especially those considered by 
[CONTACT_28259], should be reported.  
 
Information on the medical condition of subjects should begin following the subject’s 
written informed consent to participate in the study and a medical history should be taken 
at screening. During any wash out and baseline periods, any changes in the health of 
subjects should be recorded as changes in medical history unl ess an event occurred as a 
result of a study -related procedure and  is unanticipated; in such cases, the event should be 
recorded as an AE and reported to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) as an 
“unanticipated problem” in accordance with local procedures . Other changes in subject 
health information becomes AE data when the subject begins dosing with the test article; 
therefore AE data should be collected from the date of the first dose of test article until the 
date of the final study visit. These data ar e considered treatment -emergent AEs.  
 
The investigator will instruct the subject to report any AEs that may occur during the study. 
At each visit, the investigator should ask the subject, in non- directive fashion, about any 
change in the subject’s overall health status since the previous visit. 
 
The severity of each AE, as judged by [CONTACT_093], will be recorded on the appropriate 
AE eCRF and will be graded according to the following scale:  
 
Mild - The AE is usually transient and may require only minim al treatment or 
therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities 
of daily living.  
 
Moderate - The AE is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities o f daily living, causing 
discomfort, but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research 
participant.  
 
Severe  - The AE interrupts usual activities of daily living or significantly affects 
clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.  
 
The investigator must determine the relationship of the AE to the test article according to 
the following categories:  
 
Definitely Related  - An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the test article; that follows a known or expected response pattern 
to the test article; and that is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_28214], and reappearance of the event on repeated exposure (re -challenge).

CONTROLLED & CONFIDENTIAL  14.5 Pregnancy  
WOCBP (see Schedule of Events  for definition of WOCBP) must have a UPT prior to 
study enrollment. Prior to study enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance 
of avoiding pregnancy during the study and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy. The subject must sign an informed consent form documenting this discussion.  WOCBP should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_28265] (e.g., missed or late menstrual period). If a subject or investigator suspects that a subject may be pregnant at any time during the study, the test article must be withheld until the results of laboratory pregnancy testing are available. If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive or apply further test article and must be discontinued from the study unless the Medical Monitor elects to retain the subject to follow the subject for safety only for all or part of the remaining study period.  If following initiation of study treatmen t, it is subsequently discovered that a subject was 
pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of test article exposure, the investigator must immediately notify the Medical Monitor of this event and record the pregnancy on the appropriate pregnancy su rveillance form. The form will be sent to  The investigator 
must notify the IRB of any pregnancy associated with the study treatment and keep careful source documentation of the event.  Protocol- required procedures for those subjects that are discontinued from the study must 
be performed on the subject unless contraindicated by [CONTACT_8663] (e.g., x -ray studies). 
Other appropriate pregnancy follow -up procedures should be considered if indicated, 
including counseling of the subject by [CONTACT_28266] (e.g., obstetrician). In addition, the investigator must report to  on the appropriate pregnancy surveillance form(s), any follow -up information regarding the 
course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome. Although pregnancy itself is not an AE, any complications during pregnancy should be recorded as AEs or SAEs (if they fulfill the SAE criteria). Offspring should be followed for a minimum of eight weeks. Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a subject exposed to the test article(s) should be recorded as a SAE with details documented in the pregnancy surveillance form. Abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous should be reported as an SAE.  
 Male subjects who  are not surgically sterile (e.g., vasectomy performed at least six months 
prior to study entry) and are sexually active with a female partner who is of childbearing

study. Prior to study enrollment, subjects must be advised of the importance of avoiding 
pregnancy during study participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional 
pregnancy. The subject must sign an informed consent form documenting this discussion.  
 
During the study, all subjects should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_28267] (e.g., female sexual partner has 
missed or late menstrual period).  
 
If the subject suspects that their sexual partner may be pregnant at any time during the 
study, or if following initiation of study treatment, it is subsequently discovered that a trial 
subject’s sexual partner was pregnant or may have been pregnant at the  time of test article 
exposure, the investigator must immediately notify the IRB of any pregnancy associated 
with the study treatment and keep careful source documentation of the event, including 
abortion (accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous) and birth of offspring. Offspring should 
be followed for a minimum of eight weeks and any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a 
child born to a subject’s sexual partner that was exposed to the test article(s) should be 
documented.  
15. BLINDING/UNBLINDING  
Blinding is imp ortant for the integrity of this clinical study. However, the blind may be 
broken in the event of a medical emergency in a subject, in which knowledge of the test 
article identity is critical to the subject’s management. Before breaking the blind for a 
subject, the investigator should determine that the information is necessary (i.e., that it will 
alter the subject’s immediate management). In many cases, particularly when the 
emergency is clearly not test article related, the problem may be effectively mana ged by 
[CONTACT_28268]. The 
need to break the blind should first be discussed with the responsible Medical Monitor and 
the best method to do this will be determined.  
 
                                                 
 
11 WOCBP include any female who has experienced menarche or  is 10 years of age or older and who has not 
undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation [at least six months prior to 
initiation of treatment], or bilateral oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal (defined as amenorr hea >12 
consecutive months in women 50 years of age and older).  
12 Effective forms of birth control include: 1) male condom with spermicide; or 2) use by [CONTACT_28269] a) hormonal contraceptives [e.g., oral stabilized for at least one full cy cle (e.g., four to eight weeks); 
transdermal, injectable (e.g., Depo -Provera), implantable, or vaginal ring (e.g., NuvaRing) stabilized for at 
least one week prior to study entry or initiation of sexual relations], b) an IUD for at least one week prior to 
test article application, or c) a barrier method [e.g., female condom, contraceptive sponge, diaphragm, or 
cervical cap] with spermicide. Abstinence is also an acceptable method of birth control for subjects who are 
not sexually active. Subjects who become sexually active or begin to have relations with a female partner 
who is of childbearing potential during the study must agree to use an effective form of birth control for the 
duration of the study and for 90 days after completion of treatment (if needed) .

help smokers abstain from smoking during a 12 -week trial period by  [CONTACT_395883], stress, anxiety,  and 
sleep disturbances associated with the use of varenicline and with nicotine withdrawal.  
1.2 BACKGROUN D 
Cigarette smoking remains the leading cause of preventable death in the U.S ., and is one of the leading causes of 
preventable morbidity and mortalit y.1,2 An estimated 540,000 smokers d ie each year from smoking -related 
disease s.3 Existing treatments for tobacco cessation  yield , on average,  less than 25% long- term abstinence rates , 
with many  of the cessation failures occurring within the first month of abstinenc e.4 There is an urgent need to 
develop new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_395860] , including repurposing FDA- approved medication s.5 Current 
pharmacological approaches (e.g. nicotine replacement therapy, bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_2394], or varenicline)  increase efficacy for 
smoking cessation, but continue to have poor  long -term abstinence rates, with  potentially  concerning adverse 
events.  
Research into the predictors of smoking lapse, the initial step in smoking relapse and unsuccessful quit attempts, 
demonstrate the importance of stres s as it relates to smoking cessatio n.[ADDRESS_497728] smokin g.7 An individual’s  response to stress  from the discomfort of

may play an important role in failed  smoking cessatio n attempt s.[ADDRESS_497730] successful medications,

nightmare s.10–[ADDRESS_497731] -generation antihistamine  of the diphenylmethane and pi[INVESTIGATOR_395861] , anxiolytic, and sedative effects. Hydroxyzine’s effects are primarily derived  due to  its actions as a 
potent H [ADDRESS_497732] strong anxiolytic properties, as well as mild antiobsessive and 
antipsychotic pro perties.  Even with its  effective sedative, hypn otic, and anxiolytic effects, hydroxyzine  does not 
demonstrate any of the abuse, dependence, addiction or toxicity potential associated with medications within 
the same therapeutic range (such as benzodiazepin es or nonbenzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_82490] ).[ADDRESS_497733] (antihistamines) on the functional 
properties of cloned α7- nicotine acetylcholine receptor expressed in Xenopus  oocytes.[ADDRESS_497734] investigated antihistamines as potential aid s in quitting smoking. This  includes  animal models which

administration with  both a cute dosing and repeated injection s of this centrally acting antihistamin e.15(p1) A 
recent study at Duke University evaluated  meclizine (a first -generation nonselective H1 antagonist) as a 
potential smoking cessation treatment. In this  phase II stud y completed in 2013, participant s were given a 
divided dose of meclizine (either 25 mg a day or 50 mg a day, administered in two doses each day) with a 
nicotine patch for three weeks during the pre -quit period.  The study results demonstrate the high potential for 
this class of medications to provide improved rates of abstinence for smokers who desire to quit.[ADDRESS_497735] anxiolytic properties, and has a much shorter half- live, only 
six hours, compared to hydroxyzine which has a half -life of about 20 hour s.17,18 
This study investigates the potential  for decreasing the rate of adverse effects of varenicline and  increas ing the  
efficacy  of varenicline  when it is combined with hydroxyzine. Since hydroxyzine is an FDA- approved medication, 
mark eted in the [LOCATION_002], it does not require an IND  (Investigational New Drug)  application . This study is 
not intended to support a new indication, support a change in labeling, support a change in advertising, nor 
does it involve a change in dosage leve l or route of administration.  
 STUDY OBJECTIVE S AND ENDPOINTS  
2.1 EFFICACY OF VARENICLINE AND HYDROXYZINE FOR STRESS AND SLEEP 
A maximum of  fifty (50) smokers will receive the FDA -approved dosing for both  varenicline and hydroxyzine . 
These medications have been approved by [CONTACT_395884], non -pregnant adults at the dose s and 
frequencies  specifie d in this study.  
Participant s enrolled in the study  will take the FDA approved starter kit of varenicline  for the first week of 
medic ation administration  (0.5 mg nightly  for days 1 -3, then 0.5 mg twice daily for days 4 -7). During the first 
week, participant s will also receive hydroxyzine dosed in a similar manner, [ADDRESS_497736] week, participant s will receive the FDA-
approved dose of varenicline  (1 mg  twice daily ) combined with hydroxyzine, 25 mg in the morning and 50 mg at 
nighttime . All medications will be dosed orally. The FDA has approved  the 50 mg dose of hydroxyzine for 
treatment of nausea, anxiety, and insomnia. The morning dose of hydroxyzine is limited to 25 mg to minimize 
the sedative effects of this antihistamine, while the evening dose is prescribed at 50 mg to maximize the 
antieme tic, anxiolytic, and sedative properties.  Dose adjustments for hydroxyzine  by [CONTACT_395885] (e.g. daytime sedation…stop the AM dose of 
hydroxyzine, difficulty waking in the am… decrease nighttime dose of hydroxyzine). Participants will be contact[CONTACT_395886] a follow -up call by [CONTACT_395887] 72 hours of any dos e adjustment. Trial medications  will 
continue until the participant  returns for the End -of-Study visit, approximately 12 weeks after initiation of the 
medications.   
2.1.1 Stress  
Stress levels will be measured using the 10 -item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS -10) at each laboratory session.  
2.1.2 Anxiety and Depression  
Anxiety levels and depression will be monitored using the 6 -item  State-Trait Anxiety Inventory  (STAI)  and the 
Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ -9) provided during each laboratory sessions.  
Rose Research Center, LLC  Version 1.0 / [ADDRESS_497737] for Nicotine Dependence (FTND)  and the Minnesota Nicotine 
Withdrawal Scale  at each laboratory session after enrollment.  Participant s will also respond to t he Modified 
Cigarette Evaluation Questionnaire ( mCEQ, satisfaction with smoking)  and the “Wisconsin Predicting Patients’ 
Relapse” questionnaire ( WI-PREPARE, susceptibility to smoking relapse) a t Visit [ADDRESS_497738] assessments  at each visit.  
Participant s will be queried on their level of nausea via daily SMS text messages.  
2.2 EFFECTS OF VARENICLINE  ON SMOKING REDUCTION PRIOR TO TH E QUIT DATE 
Previous research has shown that abstinence at the end of treatment is strongly predicted by [CONTACT_395888]- smoking date. This finding was initially discovered by [CONTACT_458] (2009) 
using pre -quit date nicotine skin patch treatment and has been extended by [CONTACT_395889][INVESTIGATOR_395862]. This early marker of subsequent success can be extremely useful 
in clinical practice by [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_395863] a potential relapse occurs. We will 
assess the extent of smoking reduction in participants during the initial seven days of treatment (prior to their 
planned quit date) through the End -Of-Study , indexed by [CONTACT_395890] (expi[INVESTIGATOR_395864] ). We will correlate  these reductions with abstinence assessed at the end of treatment.

subjective ratings of the rewarding effects of smoking, craving for cigarettes and other nicotine withdrawal 
symptoms, assessed using standardized questionnaires; b ) demographic measures, including gender, age, 
socio economic status, and race; and c) smoking history variables, including baseline cigarette consumption, level 
of nicotine dependence, and number of prior quit attempts.

2.3.2 Self-reported Rewarding  / Aversive Effects of Cigarettes  
Rewarding and aversive effects will be evaluated using the validated modified Cigarette Evaluation 
Questionnaire (mCEQ)23, initially developed in the Principal Investigator’s laboratory. The mCEQ assesses the 
degree to which participant s experience the reinforcing effects of smoking, providing five subscale scores: 
smoking satisfaction (satisfying, tastes good, enjoy smoking), psychological reward (calms down, more awake, 
less irritable, helps concentrate, reduces hunger), aversion (dizziness, nauseated), enjoyment of respi[INVESTIGATOR_113189] (single -item assessment), and craving reduction (single -item assessment).

 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
3.1 STUDY DESIGN  
This study design has been developed to hasten the identification and evaluation of promising new smoking 
cessation treatments. This single -group, small- scale, open -label stud y (N= maximum of 50) will evaluate 
hydroxyzine combined with varenicline . The rate of nausea reported in  this study will be compar ed to the known 
nausea  rates associated with varenicline alone ( ~30%). Interim data analysis will occur after [ADDRESS_497741] 
reached the primary outcome. In choosing these thresholds, Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to determine the significance thresholds for both the N=25 and N=50 one -tailed binomial tests so that the overall 
false posit ive (Type I error) rate across all tests would be approximately 10%. Conversely, the overall false 
negative (Type II error) rate, whereby a promising treatment is discarded prematurely, would be approximately 
20%.  These initial results will fall into one o f three categories:  
3.1.1 Reported nausea  12% or less  of participants  
If three or less participants report nausea  with c ombination hydroxyzine and varenicline , this investigational 
treatment  will be viewed as having considerable promise and will immediately be advanced to a larger- scale 
(~N=200) randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) and this “pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]” study will stop recruitment . This RCT will be 
submitted as a separate protocol.  
3.1.2 Reported nausea in 16% to 24% of participants  
If 4 to 6  participants report nause a with combination hydroxyzine and varenicline , an additional 25 participants 
will be recruited to obtain a more precise estimate of the success rate.  If, cumulatively, reported nausea  is less 
than 20 % (10/50) , the combination of hydroxyzine and varenicline will be advanced to  a larger- scale (~N=200) 
RCT.  
3.1.[ADDRESS_497742] 28% of participants  
If 7 or more  participants report nausea  with combination hydroxyzine and varenicline , this investigational 
treatment will be viewed unpromising and no additional participant s will be enrolled.

potent H [ADDRESS_497754] strong anxiolytic pr operties, as well as mild antiobsessive and 
antipsychotic properties. Even with its effective sedative, hypnotic, and anxiolytic effects, hydroxyzine does not demonstrate any of the abuse, dependence, addiction or toxicity potential associated with medicat ions within 
the same therapeutic range (such as benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_395866]).

LLor ca et al.  demonstrated the safety and efficacy of hydroxyzine in the treatment of generalized anxiety 
disorder.20 A common adverse event for hydroxyzine (occurring 10% or more) is drowsiness. All other adverse 
events occurred less than 10% or were of unknown incidence. This includes dry mouth, cough, unusual tiredness, and irregular or slow heart rate.
21 
A Cochrane Review from 2014 which looked at interventions for nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy noted that hydroxyzine had a stat istically significant improvement in nausea at a dose  of 25 mg twice a day, when 
compared with placebo  (see figure 2) .
24 It also no ted that  only 7% of  the participant s using hydroxyzine reported 
only “slight drowsiness” while taking this medication at this particular dose.24 No other adverse effects were 
reported in this review.

A study published in 2012 evaluated the efficacy of combining hydroxyzine with ondansetron for treatment of 
side effects associated with chemotherapy regiments which utiliz ed highly emetogenic drugs. This study 
demonstrated that complete control of acute emesis was achieved in 56% of pediatric cancer patients utilizing 
both antiemetic  medications versus only 22% uti lizing ondansetron without hydroxyzine (p=0.006).25 This study 
also reported that patients and parents noted “ …significantly better sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_395867], appetite, activity and 
mood…” for those patients taking ondansetron with hydroxyzine versus withou t hydroxyzine. The dose of 
hydroxyzine used was 1 mg/kg/dose, equivalent to 77 m g for an average adult female  and 89 mg for an average 
adult male  (an average American female weighs 170 lbs.  and an average American  male weigh s 197 lbs. 
according to the CDC ).26 Dosing for this study will be based on minimizing the risk of sedation (25 mg AM dosing) 
while optimizing the beneficial effects of the study drug (50 mg PM dosing). Participant s will be titrated to these 
doses in a similar fashion as the titration of varenicline, allowing for dose adjustment based on daily evaluation 
of potential side effects.  
5.[ADDRESS_497755] USE TIMEFRAME  
Dosing will begin one week before a target quit- smoking date and will continue for a total of approximately 1 2 
weeks , the same dur ation as the FDA -approved dosing for varenicline. Since hydroxyzine does not demonstrate 
any dependence or addictive properties, there is no indication to taper the dose.   
5.3 DOSAGE  
• First 3 days o f treatment : PM – two 25 mg tablet  orally .  
• Starting on  the fou rth day of treatment  and continuing until the EOS : AM –  one 25 mg tablet  orally ; PM

each participant. Participants are informed that they may withdraw from participation in the study at any time 
without penalty.  
Because of the nature of this study and the number  of questionnaires that participant s are expected to 
complete, we do not recruit potential participant s who do not read, are blind or who do not read/understand 
English. We are not equipped to validate alternate versions of our questionnaires. Questio nnaires cannot be 
administered orally by a translator or by t echnicians to illiterate or blind participant s because the data obtained 
would not be comparable to self- administered questionnaires.

7.2.6 Medical History and Concomitant Disease  
Relevan t medical history and concomitant disease will be documented at the screening visit (V1). Medical 
history is defined as any condition that started and ended prior to V1. A concomitant disease is defined as any 
condition that started prior to V1 and is still ongoing at V1 (this may also include findings detected during the 
screening visit).  
7.2.7 Prior and Concomitant Medication  
All medication taken four weeks prior to the screening visit (V1) and during the study will be documented using 
a source document. Medica tions which are stopped before V1 will be considered as prior medication. 
Medication which was started prior to V1 and which is still being taken by [CONTACT_395902] V1 will be considered as a c oncomitant medication. This applies to both 
prescription and over- the-counter products (e.g., vitamins).  
Records of prior and concomitant medications taken include the drug name (preferably both generic and trade 
name), route of administration, dose/unit, frequency of use, indication, the start and if applicable, the stop date. 
Any therapy changes (including changes of regimen) during the study will be documented.  
The questionnaires will be administered to the participant s using paper questionnaires and/or an electronic data 
collection system. The timing of these questionnaires is outlined in the Schedule of Events 8.[ADDRESS_497765], abdomen, dentition, 
cardiovascular, musculoskeletal and neurological systems. The physical examination is to be conducted by a

position after the participant  has rested for at least [ADDRESS_497767] two minutes later in a standing position.  
7.2.14  Questionnaires  
The questionnaires will be administered to the participant s using paper questionnaires and/or an electronic data 
collection system. The questionnaires will be asked according to Section 8.5. 
 10-Item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS -10) 
Self-report questionnaire s are the simplest method for obtaining a rapid evaluation of a participant ’s realized 
stress levels. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) was developed in 1983 as a psychometrically valid measure of perceived stress. A 2011 study reviewed the use of the PSS in a sample of participant s who smoked, evaluating  
three different versions;  the PSS -14 (14- item questionnaire), the PSS -10 (10- item questionnaire), and the PSS -4 
(4-item questionnaire). The results from this 2011 study confirmed the psychometric properties of all three 
versions.
30 Our study will utilize the PSS -10 during all visits  after enrollment  (V2 through V7)  to evaluate self -
reported perceived stress levels.   
 6-Item State -Trait Inventory (STAI)  
In 2011, [CONTACT_395922] from University of [LOCATION_004], San Francisco, published a review of available validated 
methods for accurately measuring anxiety. Her review fo cused on self -reported measures of general anxiety. 
She reviewed three different models; the State- Trait Anxiety Index, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, and the anxiety 
subscale of the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5620]. The STAI demonstrated excellent relia bility and good 
validity, and is both responsive and sensitive to change.31,[ADDRESS_497768] AI during all visits  after enrollment  (V2 through V7)  to 
evaluate self- reported anxiety  levels.  
 PHQ -9 -- The Patient Health Questionnaire  
The Patient Health Questionnaire PHQ -9 for Depression will be used to screen for current (within 2 weeks) 
depression. Potential participant s who score >9 (or who score >0 on item #9 (“Thoughts that you would be 
better off dead, or of hurting yourself in so me way”) ) will be excluded from study participation, and, at the 
discretion of the study physician /physician assistants , referred to appropriate psychiatric treatment . Participant s 
will respond to this questionnaire at all visits. This questionnaire will b e administered at every visit, including the 
screening visit (V1 through V7).  
 Modified Cigarette Evaluation Questionnaire  (mCEQ)  
The mCEQ assesses the degree to which participant s experience the reinforcing effects of smoking . This 
questionnaire will be ad ministered after enrollment and prior to commencing the investigational products (V2 
and V3).  
Rose Research Center, LLC  Version 1.0 / 09 Apr 2019  Confidential - Page 24 of 70 
 MNWS –Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale  
The MNWS will be used  at all visits after “quit day” (V 4 through V7)  to assess nicotine withdrawal symptoms 
including cr aving and mood effects . Participant s will be asked to assess the following seven symptoms (on a 
5-point scale ranging from 0 to 4 , where 0 = none, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe):  
• Desire or craving to smoke  
• Anger, irritability, frustration  
• Anxiety or nervousness  
• Difficulty of concentrating  
• Impatience, restlessness  
• Hunger  
• Depression  
 FTND -- The Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence  
The Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence is a six- item questionnaire developed by [INVESTIGATOR_4933] -Olov Fagerström  
and is  used to determine someone’s level of nicotine dependence. The scores obtained on the test allow the 
classification of nicotine dependence in three different levels: mild (0 -3 points), moderate (4 -6 points), and 
severe (7 - 10 points).  This questionnaire will be given at all visits (V1 through V7).  
 WI-PREPARE  – Wisconsin Predicting Patients’ Relapse  Questionnaire  
The WI -PREPARE is a seven -item  questionnaire that is designed to assess a participant’s  susceptibility to smoking 
relapse. The questionnaire includes measures of physical dependency, environmental factors and smoking 
characteristics. Participants will respond to this questionnaire after enrollment and prior to the selected “quit 
day”  (V2 and V3).  
 Prior and Concomitant Medication  
At each visit, participant s will report an y changes in medication use, including the use of supplements, vitamins, 
over -the-counter medications, and prescription medications.  
 Smoking History Questionnaire  
The Smoking History is a questionnaire designed to hel p assess the participant ’s current and past smoking 
habits. This questionnaire  will be administered at screening (V1) and   will include questions about the  number of 
years participant s have smoked combustible cigarettes (CC) , the number of CC s per day smoked over the last [ADDRESS_497769] demographic information about participant s. It will be 
administered at screening (V1).  
 Medical History Form  
The Medical History form  is an internal questionnaire designed to help assess the participant ’s current health 
and any health history. This questionnaire also includes questions about all medications (include prescription 
medications, other -the-counter medications or supplements) taken in the past 30 days . It is  designed to help 
assess the participant ’s current health  and health history  and is used to help determine eligibility . This form is 
administered at the initial screening visit (V1) . 
Rose Research Center, LLC  Version 1.0 / 09 Apr 2019  Confidential - Page 25 of 70 
 Review of Systems  
The Review of Systems is an internal questionnaire  administered at screening (V1)  to help assess the 
participant ’s current health and health history by [CONTACT_395904] a list of symptoms.  
 Employment History  
The Employment History is an internal questionnaire designed to collect information about a participant s’ social 
econ omic status.  Participant s will be presented this questionnaire after enrollment, at the second visit (V2).  
 Adverse Effects  
During each visit after enrollment (V2 through V7) , participant s will respond to adverse events based on a 
mild/moderate/severe ratin g. The questionnaire will use both targeted questions and open -ended questions to 
access for any adverse effects/events.  Participant s will respond to SMS text message inquiries for study specific 
adverse effects, on a daily basis, commencing after enrollme nt (see Section 8.8).  
 Medication Compliance  
Participant s will be queried via SMS text messages whether they have been compliant with taking the study 
specific medications . These messages will  commenc e after the second visit and continue through the End of 
Study (see Section 8.8).  
 Smoking Status  
 SMS text messages will be sent to participant s starting after enrollment, through the End of Study, to ascertain 
the participant s smoking status (see Section 8.8).

 RISK / BENEFIT  INFORMATION  
9.1 POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
The participants will be encouraged to quit smoking, which would significantly reduce their risk of 
smoking -related diseases.  
Rose Research Center, LLC  Version 1.0 / [ADDRESS_497771] on public health.  
9.3 POTENTIAL RISKS 
Continuing to smoke carries significant health risks; if participant s are successful at maintaining 
abstinence (and possibly quit), the participants in the studies will realize a significant improvement in 
their health and a decrease in their risk of morbidity and mortality associated with smoking combustible 
cigarettes.   
9.3.[ADDRESS_497772] -generation antihistamine which has FDA- approval as an antiemetic , anxiolytic, and 
sedative medication. Even with its effective sedative, hypnotic, and anxiolytic effects, hydroxyzine does 
not demonstrate any of the abuse, dependence, addiction or toxicity potential associated with 
medications within the same therapeutic range (such as benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_395866]).
13 A common adverse event for hydroxyzine (occurring 10% or more) is drowsiness. All other 
adverse events occurred less than 10% or were of unknown incidence. This includes dry mouth, cough, 
unusual tiredness, and irregular or slow heart rate.[ADDRESS_497773] common adverse reaction reported is nausea, with 30 -40% of participants 
in randomized control trials reporting mild to moderate levels of nausea.33 Discontinuation/drop -out 
rates of nearly 10% have been noted during clinical trials due to these adverse effects.34 In addition to 
the potential drug- specific side effects noted , any medication may trigger a serious allergic reaction and 
may cause shock, seizures (convulsions, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], "fits"), loss of consciousness, tingling, swelling of the face, lips, tongue, throat and/or vocal cords, difficulty breathing, asthma, wheezing, rash, hives, itching, 
and possibly death.  
9.3.3 Nicotine  Withdrawal  
Participants may experience nicotine withdrawal symptoms, including craving, difficulty concentrating,  
nausea, insomnia,  headache,  mood disturbance and increased appetite/weight gain.  
9.3.4 Blood Draw  
The risks associated with venipuncture are minimal and include momentary discomfort and/or  bruising. 
Infection, excess bleeding, clotting, and fainting  are also possible, although unlikely.  
Rose Research Center, LLC  Version 1.0 / [ADDRESS_497774] number in the 
event that  side effects or adverse events occur between sessions.  
9.4.1 Blood Pressure Monitoring  
After study enrollment, if blood pressure during laboratory visits is above 160/100, then the following 
actions will be taken to enhance participant  safety:  
• If BP >210/12 0 with symptoms of malignant hypertension, all experimental interventions will 
be stopped immediately,  and the participant will be referred to appropriate medical 
treatment. Participation may  resume , with continued monitoring, if BP is no greater than 
150/100.  
• If BP > 160/[ADDRESS_497775] 
their BP checked weekly by [CONTACT_145482], local pharmacy, or home machine and call us with 
results.  Participant s will also be encouraged to see their PCP regarding evaluation, treatment, 
and further monitoring.  
 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
10.1 TRAINING OF STAFF 
The Investigator or designee will ensure that appropriate training relevant to the study is provided to all 
staff involved in the study, and that any new information relevant to the performance of this study is 
forwarded in a timely manner to the staff.  
10.2 AUDITS AND INSPECTIONS  
Good Clinical Practice regulations require independent inspections of clinical program activities. Such inspections may be performed at any time before, during, and after the study.  
Authorized representatives of the Sponsor, regu latory agencies and/or an IRB may perform audits or 
inspections, including source data verification. The purpose of an audit or inspection is to systematically 
and independently examine all study -related activities and documents to determine whether these 
activities were conducted,  and data were recorded, analyzed and accurately reported , according to the 
protocol, ICH/GCP guidelines and any applicable regulatory requirements. The Investigator or designee will contact [CONTACT_12559]  a regulatory agency about an inspection at their 
site.  
Rose Research Center, LLC  Version 1.0 / 09 Apr 2019  Confidential - Page 32 of 70 
The Investigator and study staff are responsible for maintaining a comprehensive and accurate filing 
system of all study -related documentation that will be suitable for inspection at any time by [CONTACT_429], its authorized representative , and other  regulatory agencies.  
 REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
11.1 DEFINITIONS  
11.1.1  Adverse Event  
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that may present during participation in the study and which ma y or may not have a causal relationship with study procedures 
and/or products tested in this study. An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease 
temp orally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
study procedures and/or products.  
Any increase in the severity and/or  the frequency of a concomitant disease is considered an AE.  
11.1.2  Serious Adverse Event  
A Serious Adverse Event is any adverse event that:  
• results in death;  
• is life -threatening;  
• results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
• results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity;  
• results in a congenital anomaly / birth defect;  
• requires immediate medical or surgical intervention.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening , or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_395871], when, based on appropriate medical judgment, the event  may jeopardize 
the participant , or the participant  may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in the above definitions.  
The term "life -threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers to an event in which the participant  was 
at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event, which  hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe.  
Any pre -planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_395872]; however,  they will be recorded as AE only. Any AE that occurs during this pre -planned 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_395873].  
11.2 COLLECTION OF SAFETY EVENTS FROM PARTICIPANT S 
Information recorded when collecting AE s will include: thorough  description of the AE, seriousness 
assessment, start and stop dates  (if known) , circumstances leading up to the event, clinical elements 
such as clinical course, specific vital signs and test results that may explain the pathophysi ology of the 
event, as well as alternative explanations to its occurrence, the action taken with the investigation 
Rose Research Center, LLC  Version 1.0 / [ADDRESS_497776] /procedures  due to the AE, the participant `s disposition in the study after the occurrence of the 
AE and the final outcome of the AE  (if known) . 
Any exacerbation/worsening or increased frequency of an AE or pre -existing condition shall be 
evaluated and recorded.  
AEs should be collected using questionnaires and face -to-face interviews with the participant . The 
Adverse Effects Form is a targeted checklist- based questionnaire with items selected to detect common 
side effects from product use. This questionnaire also contains an open -ended section for participant s to 
record any additional effects.  
Whenever a medically meaningful diagnosis is  available to comprise a set of reported signs and/or 
symptoms, it should be preferentially provided as the AE or SAE term, rather than the individual signs 
and/or symptoms. Otherwise, each one of those signs and/or symptoms should be reported separately 
as event terms.  
11.2.1  Period of Collection  
All existing health conditions identified during the Screening Period will be recorded as concomitant 
disease and the participant ’s eligibility will be reviewed. Any AEs which occur during the screening 
session will be c aptured by [CONTACT_395906].  
Any new, clinically relevant, abnormal finding detected during the study or worsening of a pre -existing 
condition/concomitant disease will be documented as an AE or  an SAE.  
11.3 ASSESSMENT OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
11.3.1  Intensity of Adverse Events  
For each AE /SAE , the intensity will be graded on a 3 -point intensity scale:  
• Mild:  The AE is easily tolerated and does not interfere with daily activity.  
• Moderate: The AE interferes with daily activity, but the participant  is still able to function.  
• Severe: The AE is incapacitating and requires medical intervention.  
11.3.2  Relationship to Study Procedures  
In general, all AEs and SAEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_395907] ‘related’ or ‘not  
related’ .  
• Not related: The temporal relationship of the clinical event to study procedures  and/or the 
study medication  makes a causal relationship unlikely, or, concomitant medication, 
therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions provide a sufficient explanation for the 
observed event.  
• Related: The temporal relationship of the clinical event to study procedures  and/or the study 
medication  makes a causal relationship po ssible, and concomitant medication, therapeutic 
interventions, or underlying conditions do not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
Rose Research Center, LLC  Version 1.0 / 09 Apr 2019  Confidential - Page 34 of 70 
11.4 FOLLOW -UP OF NON-SERIOUS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
Non -serious  AEs will not be followed -up by [CONTACT_395908] . The 
Investigator or designee will refer the participant  to their Primary Care Provider for follow up of those 
AE(s) until they have resolved, stabilized (i.e., no worsening of condition), or until an acceptable 
explanation has been found.  
Serious AEs will be followed up by [CONTACT_18370], despi[INVESTIGATOR_395874] , until their resolution, stabilization (i.e., no worsening of the condition), or an acceptable 
explanation has been found (e.g. a chronic condition).

operating procedures  and GCP reporting guidelines . 
11.6 REPORTING OF SAFETY EVENTS TO FDA 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_395875].  
11.7 REPORTING AND FOLLOW -UP OF PREGNANCIES  
All participant s who are determined to be pregnant after enrollment will be discontinued from the 
study. Advice on the risk  of smoking and smoking cessation will be provided by [CONTACT_39635]  (or 
qualified staff)  and participant s will be referred to the respective health care facility/health care 
provider for further support.  
The Investigator is responsible for informing the  IRB of any pregnancy that occurs during the study , and 
its outcome, according to local regulations.  
11.8 ADVERSE EVENT LEADING TO DISCONTINUATION  
If a participant  is discontinued from the study because of an AE, the Investigator or designee will follow 
up unti l the AE(s) has/have been resolved, stabilized ( i.e., no worsening of condition), or until an 
acceptable explanation has been found.  
 DATA MANAGEMENT  
12.1 DATA COLLECTION PROCEDURES  
Trained study personnel will be responsible for capturing the data from the obse rvations, tests, and 
assessments specified in the protocol and in the source documents.  
The Investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all data related to the 
clinical study and ensuring that the data are accurate, authent ic/original, legible, timely 
(contemporaneous), enduring, and available when required. Any corrections made to source documents

12.3.4  Medrio  
All smoking behavioral and self- report measures will be captured initially using Me drio. Medrio is an 
electronic data collection system that records and performs analysis and reporting of data. Participant 
data will be kept within Medrio’s secure servers and may only be transmitted through  a secure (SSL) 
download to our local server. Med rio’s servers are protected by [CONTACT_5019] -end firewall systems, with 
vulnerability scans performed regularly. All services have quick failover points with redundant hardware, 
and complete encrypted backups are performed regularly. Medrio uses Transport Layer Sec urity (TLS) 
encryption (SSL or HTTPS) for all transmitted internet data. All information collected within Medrio is compliant with 21 CFR 11 requirements.  
12.4 MISSING DATA 
Missing data will remain as missing, i.e., no attempt will be made to impute missing values and only 
observed values will be used in data summarizations  and analysis . 
12.5 DATA HANDLING  
Data of all participant s enrolled including screening failures and AE /SAEs  during the study (from the time 
of informed consent to the end of the study of the parti cipant ) will be captured in the source 
documents.  
12.6 DATA VALIDATION  
Data that are entered  will be verified and edit check ed to ensure accuracy. Inconsistencies that arise 
from these checks will be resolved and documented by [CONTACT_464].  
12.7 DATABASE LOCK 
Upon  completion of the trial, after data entry is complete, the data has been clean ed, and the principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_395876], the database will be locked,  and final write access will 
be removed.  
 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS  
All data measures (e.g., withdrawal symptoms questionnaires, smoking history, smoking diaries, etc.) are 
captured initially using paper or an electronic data capture system. Verified data files will be analyzed 
using Statview or SAS (Statview, SAS Institute, Cary NC). Data will be inspected for outliers and if 
sufficiently extreme (Chauvenet’s criterion, after verifying normality of distributions) will be censored from the data analysis.  
13.1 EFFICACY AND TOLERABILITY  
13.1.1  Abstinence Outcomes  
Abstinence at each time point will be defined by a self -report of no cigarette smoking (not even a puff) 
since the prior session, confirmed by [CONTACT_172549][INVESTIGATOR_395877]  5 ppm. The primary  
Rose Research Center, LLC  Version 1.0 / [ADDRESS_497780] 
relapsed prior to the end of  treatment (week [ADDRESS_497781]- quit) will be counted as non -abstinent  (in 
accordance with recent guidelines from the FDA) . A secondary smoking abstinence outcome will be [ADDRESS_497782] not relapsed prior to the end of 
treatment. The main  goal of the 6 -month follow -up is to assess the  persistence of therapeutic effects for 
those who do achieve end -of-treatment abstinence. This information will be helpful in determining the 
treatment duration in future Phase 3  clinical trials.  The main hypothesis to be evaluated in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_395878] t hat the incidence of varenicline -associated side effects, specifically nausea, will be diminished 
by [CONTACT_3252] -administration of hydroxyzine, relative to historical benchmarks (see below). A one -tailed test of 
abstinence will be conducted, however, comparing the proportion of participant s abstinent during 
weeks 8 -11 to the historical benchmark of 45% abstinence, to provide evidence that abstinence is not 
significantly lower than it would be with varenicline alone.  There is no reason to expect that abstinence 
rate would be reduced by [CONTACT_395909]; if anything,  abstinence would be expected to be enhanced by 
[CONTACT_395910] -associated side effects and by [CONTACT_395911] H1 antagonists to reduce 
nicotine reward.35 
13.1.2  Side Effects / Tolerability  
The hypothesis that hydroxyzine redu ces the incidence of nausea, one of the most common side effects 
of varenicline, will be evaluated by [CONTACT_395912] 30%  (20% above placebo rate of 
10%) observed in clinical trials of varenicline .36 Initially, 25 participant s will be recruited and then the 
possibility of recruiting 25 more (total N=50) depending on an interim  analysis, as follows : 
 
• If 0-3 participants out of 25 ( 12% or less) report nausea, we would  conclude the treatment is highly 
promising at the interim stage and go directly to an RCT (Branch 1) . 
• If 4-6 participants (out of 25) report the side effect, then  the treatment will be deemed sufficiently 
promising  to recruit an additional 25 participant s (Branch 2) . If [ADDRESS_497783] of nausea  (20% or less), a follow -up RCT would be warranted;  otherwise the 
treatment would be deemed unpromising.  
• If 7 or more out of 25 ( 28% or more ) report  the side effect of nausea in the interim analysis, then  we 
would  conclude it is  futile to continue the pi[INVESTIGATOR_395879]  (Branch 3) . 
The frequency of treatment- emergent side effects (i.e., those that begin or worsen after the i nitiation of 
treatment) will be tabulated. Due to the problem of Type II error posed by [CONTACT_395913] (especially if corrections are imposed for multiple comparisons), descriptive 
statistical methods will instead be use d, supplemented by [CONTACT_395914] p -
values as a flagging device to highlight differences worthy of further attention.37 Hypothesis testing will 
be conducted for only two outcomes: 1) proportion of participant s that withdraw from the study due to 
side effects; 2) overall adherence ( i.e., proportion of scheduled doses taken ) assessed by [CONTACT_395915].  
13.1.3  Statistical Power  
Monte Carlo s imulations conducted by [CONTACT_395916] ([CONTACT_395923]) revealed that if the 
combination hydroxyzine/varenicline treatment is no better than varenicline  alone (null of 30% 
incidence of nausea is t rue) the following would oc cur: 
-          3% go into Branch 1 (highly promising)  
-          31% go into Branch 2 (larger pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268])  
Rose Research Center, LLC  Version 1.0 / 09 Apr 2019  Confidential - Page 38 of 70 
-          66% go into Branch 3 (early evidence of futility)  
-          Overall Type I error rate of 9%  
If the new treatment yields a side effect rate of 15% (v ersus null of 30%) then:  
-          47% go into Branch 1 (highly promising)  
-          46% go into Branch 2 (larger pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268])  
-          7% go into Branch 3 (futile)  
-          Overall power of 86%  
If the new treatment yields a side effect rate no worse than placebo of 10% (versus null of 30%) then :  
-          77% go into Branch 1 (highly promising)  
-          22% go into Branch 2 (larger pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268])  
-          1% go into Branch 3 (futile)  
-          Overall power of 98%  
Thus, to detect a clinically important reduction in side effects (a relative reduction by [CONTACT_2669] 50%, from 
an incidence of 30% to 15% or less), the power exceeds 86%. The Type I error of the overall approach is 9%. 
13.[ADDRESS_497784] to participant s 
may be implemented immediately provided the reviewing IRB are notified within 10 working days.  
14.2 INVESTIGATIONAL NEW DRUG APPLICATION  
An Investigational New Drug (IND) application is not required for either medication since both 
medications have been approved by [CONTACT_395917] . Since varenicline and 
hydroxyzine are FDA- approved medi cations, marketed in the [LOCATION_002], they do not require an IND.  
This study is not intended to support a new indication, support a change in labeling, support a change in 
advertising, nor does it involve a change in dosage level or route of administrat ion. 
Rose Research Center, LLC  Version 1.0 / [ADDRESS_497785] be conducted in accordance with the regulations of the [LOCATION_002] 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as described in 21 CFR 50 and 56, applicable laws and the IRB 
requirements.  
14.4 PARTICIPANT  INFORMATION AND CONSENT  
It is the responsibility o f the investigator to provide each participant  with full and adequate verbal and 
written information using the IRB -approved informed consent form (ICF) , including the objective and 
procedures of the study and the possible risks involved before inclusion in  the study. Informed consent 
must be obtained prior to performing any study -related procedures.  
The signed and personally dated original and completed ICF(s) must be kept by [CONTACT_395918] ’s files and a copy must be given to the 
participant . The participant  will be informed that if they  discontinue from the study, the data collected 
until the point of discontinuation will be 
maintained as part of the study data  and the samples 
collected prior to discontinuation will be analyzed, unless they  refuse in writing.  
14.[ADDRESS_497786] been reviewed and 
approved by [CONTACT_395919] s are informed and s ign the amended ICF (including date and 
time). 
 ADMINISTRATIVE CONSIDERATIONS  
15.[ADDRESS_497787] to the participant s' state of health 
will be regarded as confidential. A statemen t to this effect will be written in the information provided to 
the participant . An agreement to disclose any such information will be obtained from the participant  in 
writing and signed by [CONTACT_2299] , in compliance with all local and national data protection and 
privacy legislation.  
Study records that identify participant s will be kept confidential as required by [CONTACT_2371]. Except when 
required by [CONTACT_2371], participant s will not be identified by [CONTACT_2300], social security number, address, telephone 
number, or any other direct personal identifier in study records disclosed outside of Rose Research Center. For records disclosed outside of Rose Research Center, participant s will be assigned a unique 
code number. The key to the code will be kept separate from the locked file where the study records are 
stored.  
Rose Research Center, LLC  Version 1.0 / [ADDRESS_497788] RETENTION  
All records of data, in any form, will be maintained by [CONTACT_395920]/GCPs. 
Essential documents will be retained for at least 15 years after completion of the study.  
Appropriate measures will be taken to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these documents.

Version 2.0  Page 9 Decision Rule and 
Sample Size  A total of 170 subjects (85/arm) in  1:1 ratio of  serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 5 mg or placebo will 
provide 90% power to detect a 25% relative reduction (placebo -adjusted ratio of 
0.75) in 24- hour objective  cough frequency or awake  objective  cough frequency 
using a two -sample t -test at a one -sided significance level of 0.05.  This assumes 
that 24-hour cough frequency or awake  cough frequency follows a log- normal 
distribution with a CV of 0. 64. This sample size also considers an expected 
dropout rate of 15%.  
The comparisons related to the primary and key secondary objectives will be 
done in a hierarchical manner to control the familywise error rate. The testing 
proced ure will start by [CONTACT_738038] 8.9.4.  
Analysis Sets : Efficacy Analysis Sets  
Full Analysis Set (FAS) – All randomized subjects who have taken at least one 
dose of study medication and provided at least one baseline and at least one 
post-baseli ne primary endpoint observation  during the treatment period. 
Participants will be analyzed according to the treatm ent group to which they are 
randomized. 
Safety Analysis Sets  
The safety analysis set will consist of all subjects randomized who receive at least one dose of study medication. Subjects will be classified based upon the treatment received . 
PK Analysis Set  
The PK analysis set will consist of all subjects who receive ≥ [ADDRESS_1008342]- dose PK blood sample available for 
analysis.  
Statistical Methods:  Efficacy Analyses:  
The FAS population will serve as the primary population f or the analysis of 
efficacy data in this study.  
The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is change from Baseline in 24 -hour 
objective cough frequency after 12 weeks (84 days) of treatment.   
As the change in [ADDRESS_1008343] a skewed and  wide 
distribution, the primary analysis for the primary endpoint will be analyzed on 
the natural log scale.  The difference between serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053]  (5 mg) and placebo 
will be estimated using a mixed effect repeated measures (MMRM) model. The 
model will include  factors for treatment, visit, country, sex, the interaction of 
treatment by [CONTACT_765]; and the log -transformed baseline value as a covariate. The 
MMRM model will use all available 24 -hour cough frequency data on Day 28, 
56, and 84. The geometric mean of the 24- hour coughs per hour will be 
presented by [CONTACT_690371]. The percent difference change between 
serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_737999] 100*(ediff - 1), where diff is the 
difference provided by [CONTACT_738039] .  
In order to evaluate the robustness of efficacy results and assess the effect of missing data, additional sensitivity analyse s for the primary efficacy variables 
will be employed.  
Safety Analyses:  
The incidence of all AEs and treatment -related AEs will be tabulated by 
[CONTACT_82153]. These AEs will be classified by [CONTACT_223264] (MedDRA). For incidence reporting, if a subject reported more than one AE 
that was coded to the sa me system organ class or preferred term, the subject will

Version 2.0  Page 16 1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Refractory Chronic Cough  
Cough is a common symptom frequently associated with other conditions such as an upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) , or asthma. In cough 
guidelines, such as those published by [CONTACT_223769], cough is characterized by [CONTACT_738040] a patient is coughing: Acute - up to 3 weeks, Sub Acute - from 3 to 8 weeks, and Chronic - greater than 8 weeks ( Irwin 2006) . Patien ts who present to 
a physician for a persistent cough are evaluated and treated for obvious and common causes of cough. If a patient continues to cough, he/she is evaluated for conditions that are commonly associated with chronic cough. These are asthma, ga stroesophageal reflux disease 
(GERD), and upper airway cough syndrome (UACS) ( Dicpi[INVESTIGATOR_18964] 2011 ). According to the 
cough guidelines, a patient may be evaluated for less common diseases based on the patient’s history, other symptoms, or physical findings. Patients in whom no treatable cause of their cough can be found are characterized as having “refractory chronic cough” ( Gibson 2016).  
Patients with refractory chronic cough may represent up to 12% of the general population. Patients are most commonly women (approximately 2/3 -3/4 of patients are women) of 
approximately [ADDRESS_1008350] commonly cough while awake for approximately 20 times per hour to as much as several hundred times per hour (Abdulqawi 2014). The cough may last for many years with some patients reporting having 
coughed for a median of 12 years in a recent study ( Abdulqawi 2014). Patients with 
refractory chro nic cough report that their condition is frequently disabling and has a marked 
effect on their quality of life as measured by [CONTACT_738041] (LCQ) ( Birring 2003, Kelsall 2008).  
Treatment options for refractory chronic cough are very limited. There are no approved drug treatments for this disease. Patients and clinicians frequently try over -the-counter agents such 
as dextromethorphan, guaifenesin, and antihistamines with little benefit. Prescription options in the U.S. include codeine and related opi[INVESTIGATOR_738003], and in the U.K. low-dose oral morphine. Studies have evaluated amitriptyline ( Dicpi[INVESTIGATOR_18964] 2014) and 
gabapentin with some patients having some benefit but with some important adverse events (Ryan  2012 ). Importantly, there have been no FDA approvals for a novel pharmaceutical 
agent to treat  cough in over 50 years.  
1.2 Substance P and the Neurokinin- 1 Receptor in Cough   
As the study of cough and the search for agents that can control the coughing in patients with refractory chronic cough advance, there has been a greater appreciation for the role of the abnormalities in the neuronal pathways that control cough. These pathways include peripheral sensory C and Aδ fibers that are contained in vagal afferent nerves  
(LaVinka 2013, Mazzone 2007). These nerves have their ganglia in the ju gular and nodose 
ganglion and project their terminals into the nucleus tractus solitarius of the brainstem. It has been proposed by [CONTACT_738042], in the central nervous system there are few mediators of the cough ( Canning 2009). One of these is through substance P/neurokinin pathway. Neurokinin

(Canning 2009, Grobman 2016, Mazzone 2005). Therefore, it is proposed that NK 1-R 
antagonism may play a key role in controlling cough. There have been two  recently reported 
studies with an NK 1-R antagonist in controlling cough. Aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], which is commercially 
available as an antiemetic, was successful in reducing cough in patients with lung cancer

Serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_357479], including chronic 
toxicology and carcinogenicity studies. In non-clinical chronic toxicology studies in rats, mice and dogs, treatment related findings of potential clinical significance included increased salivation, decreased body weight gain and food consumption, slight changes in hematology and serum biochemistry parameters, mild increases in liver weight and mild histomorphologic changes. The histomorphologic changes were seen only in rats (not in dogs or mice) and included: very slight ovarian interstitial cell hypertrophy, mammary gland and uterine atrophy; decreased corpora lutea; increased histiocytes in lung and mesenteric lymph nodes; sli ght skeletal and cardiac muscle degeneration; slight increased hematopoiesis in 
bone marrow; and slight to moderate vacuolation in kidney tubules. These nonclinical findings occurred at systemic exposures exceeding those anticipated to provide efficacy of serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_357480] (1 to 5 mg tablet daily). No cardiac lesions have been observed in dog toxicity studies up to [ADDRESS_1008354] level (NOAEL) in rats for histomorphological changes in the reproductive tract, mammary gland and bone marrow provides a 2.5-fold margin for the maximum- target ed exposure 
(5 mg tablet daily). The rat NOAEL for histomorphological changes in muscle and kidney 
provides a 5- fold margin for the maximum-targeted exposure (5 mg tablet daily).  
In summary, the nonclinical toxicity noted with serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_357481]. Findings in the developmental toxicity studies support inclusion of women of childbearing potential in clinical trials in accordance with the study protocol and local regulatory guida nces.

3 STUDY DESIGN 
3.1 Overall Study Design 
This is a 12- week randomized, parallel -group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 
serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_738020] c ough. 
Approximately 170 subjects who meet entry criteri a will be randomly assigned to serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 
5 mg or matching placebo in a 1:[ADDRESS_1008360] of three periods, for a total study period of approximately 18 weeks:  
• Screening period: 14 days 
• Treatment period: 84 days 
• Follow-up period: [ADDRESS_1008361] be willing to comply with restrictions on allowable concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_82482]. 
At the baseline visit, eligible subjects will be randomly assign ed to receive serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 5 mg 
or placebo. Subjects will take a loading dose (3 tablets taken orally) in the morning on the 
first day of the treatment period (Study Day 1). Starting on Study Day 2, subjects will take one tablet per day taken orally in the m orning. Subjects will be instructed to take all doses at 
approximately the same time each day and no sooner than [ADDRESS_1008362] an Early Treatment Discontinuation (ETD) visit within [ADDRESS_1008363] population of subjects (N = 257), including subjects with atopic diathesis (i.e. history of atopic dermatitis, asthma, and/or allergic rhinitis). The superior efficacy was observed at multiple timepoints with both the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 1 mg and 5 mg doses, but not with the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 0.25 mg dose. Safety profiles between the three serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_738021], and serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_357499] -tolerated at the doses evaluated . 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Proto col MTI -110 
Version 2.0  Page 21 The serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 5 mg dose was selected for this study based on the following factors: 
• The favorable efficacy, safety, and tolerability profile of serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_727319] [ADDRESS_1008364] 6 weeks, and ~[ADDRESS_1008365] been exposed for up to one year. 
• Huma n CNS PET receptor occupancy (RO) data for serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_727320] 
(Study P002) demonstrated a plasma concentration - RO relationship fitted with a maximum effect (E
max) model resulting in an E max of 97%, EC 50 of 22.9 nM, and EC 90 of 
294 nM. Based on this modeling the steady state trough concentration in adults taking serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 5 mg tablets once-daily is predicted to achieve ~93% RO. In previous dose- ranging experience with the NK
1-R antagonist aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], optimal clinical efficacy 
for the reli ef of chemotherapy -induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) was achieved at 
dose levels resulting in > 90% CNS NK 1 RO.

7 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
7.1 Definitions  
7.1.1 Adverse Event  
An AE is any untowar d medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug related. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g. an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. 
AEs include exacerbation s of pre -existing illness es and AE s that occur as a result of 
protocol-mandated interventions. 7.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is considered “serious” if it results in any of the following out comes:  
• Death  
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Proto col MTI -110 
Version 2.0  Page 40 • Life-threatening AE  (i.e. the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred. An event that might have led to death if it had occurred with greater severity is 
not “life -threatening”)  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25411]  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
• Congenital anomaly/ birth defect  
• Important medical event (i.e. an event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but which may be considered serious by [CONTACT_76617], as it may jeopardize the subject and may require medical/surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed above). Examples of such medica l events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 
The following are not considered SAEs: a visit to the emergency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_357512] < 24 hours that does not result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event), an elective surgery planned prior to signing consent, 
admission as per protocol for planned medical/surgical procedure, and/or routine health assessments requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (e.g.  routine 
colonoscopy). 
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous. Severity refers to the int ensity of an 
AE (e.g. m ild, moderate, or severe pain); the event itself may be of minor medical 
significance (e.g. s evere back pain). “Serious” is a regulatory definition, as defined above. 
Seriousness (not severity) serves as the basis for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
Severity and seriousness should be independently assessed when recording AEs and SAEs on 
the eCRF.  
7.1.[ADDRESS_1008387] dose of study drug 
should be recorded as AEs.  
Only a bnormal laboratory, vital sign, and ECG findings that are considered clinically 
significant by [CONTACT_093] (e.g. require active management or are associated with 
accompanying symptoms/signs ) will be recorded as medical history or AEs on the eC RF. 
Abnormal laboratory, vital sign, and ECG findings that occur prior to the first dose of study 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Proto col MTI -[ADDRESS_1008388] 
dose of study drug should be recorded as AEs. 
If the clinically s ignificant laboratory, vital sign, or ECG abnormality is a sign associated 
with a confirmed disease  or condition (e.g. el evated creatinine in a subject diagnosed with 
chronic kidney disease ), only the diagnosis (chronic kidney disease ) needs to be recorded  on 
the AE eCRF.  
Separate instances of the same clinically significant laboratory , vital sign, or ECG 
abnormality across visits should not be recorded as separate AEs or SAEs . 
7.1.[ADDRESS_1008389] be reported within 24 hours of investigator’s awareness of the death. See SAE and Pregnancy Form Completion Guidelines for complete instructions . 
The Sponsor should be provided a copy of any post-mortem findings and/or relevant medical reports, including histopathology. 
7.1.5 Pregnancies  and Contraception Requir ements  
For the purposes of this study, a female of childbearing potential is  defined as any female 
who has experienced menarche and is pre- menopausal; a postmenopausal state is defined as 
no menses for [ADDRESS_1008390] of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals: ICH M3(R2)  dated January 2010, and other available 
guidelines  (“U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use, 2010” 2010; 
“Recommendations related to contr aception and pregnancy testing in clinical trials” 2014; 
“M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals” 2010):  
a) All female subjects of childbearing potential must use highly effe ctive contraception, 
which includes the use of one or more of the following acceptable methods:  
i. Surgical sterilization (e.g., bilateral tubal occlusion or ligation , hysterectomy, 
bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], bilateral oophorectomy)  
ii. Total (as opposed to periodic or cyclic) abstinence 
iii. Hormonal contraception associated with consistent inhibition of ovulation; these may include (but are not necessarily limited to) oral, intravaginal, implantable, injectable, or transdermal delivery methods.  
i. Progesterone only oral contraceptives are excluded as a highly effective method, as they do not consistently inhibit ovulation. 
iv. Intrauterine device/system   
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Proto col MTI -110 
Version 2.0  Page 42 v. Exclusive monogamous heterosexual intercourse with a sterilized (i.e., 
vasectomized) or otherwise non- fertile (e.g., castr ated) male partner  
 
Any pregnancy occurring in a female subject or the female partner of a male subject , from 
the first study drug administration through the 4- week follow-up visit must be reported 
within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the pr egnancy. See SAE and Pregnancy 
Form Report Completion Guidelines  for complete instructions.  
The investigator will follow the pregnancy to delivery or other pregnancy outcome.  
Pregnancy in a female clinical trial subject or female partner of a male clinical trial subject is 
not an SAE per se. Complications of such pregnancies (for example, spontaneous abortion) may qualify as SAE s and should be reported as such  even if they occur after the Follow -up 
visit. Any congenital anomalies/birth defects must be rec orded and reported as SAEs. See 
SAE and Pregnancy Form Report Completion Guidelines for complete instructions.  
7.[ADDRESS_1008391] study drug administration  through the 
follow-up visit. After the 4- week follow-up visit, only SAEs that are believed to be drug -
related should be reported. After informed consent but prior to initiation of study drug, only SAEs considered by [CONTACT_357543] a protocol -mandated intervention will be collected (e.g. SAEs 
related to invasive procedures such as blood collection). These procedure- related SAEs 
should only be reported on the SAE form, not on the AE form of the eCRF. Subjects  who 
undergo screening procedures but are not randomized into the study will not have SAEs recorded in the clinical database.  
7.2.[ADDRESS_1008392] ’s medi cal record and on the AE eCRF page, 
and, if serious, on the SAE form. For each AE and SAE recorded, the investigator will make an assessment of seriousness, severity, and causality. 
7.2.3 Assessment of Severity 
All AE s entered into the eCRF will be graded for severity using the National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria  for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.03
 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Proto col MTI -110 
Version 2.0  Page 43 (“Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE )” 2010) to describe the 
maximum intensit y of the AE .  
If the AE cannot be found in the event- specific NCI CTCAE grading criteria, the i nvestigator 
should use the definitions for Grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 in T able 1. 
Table 1 Adverse Ev ent Grading  
Grade  Severity  Alternate Descriptiona 
1 Mild (apply event- specific NCI 
CTCAE grading criteria)  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or 
diagnostic observations only; intervention not 
indicated.  
2 Moderate (apply event- specific NCI 
CTCAE gra ding criteria)  Minimal, local or noninvasive intervention 
indicated; limiting age -appropriate 
instrumentation activities of daily living 
(ADL )b 
3 Severe (apply event -specific NCI 
CTCAE grading criteria)  Severe or medically  significant but not 
immediately life -threatening;  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12342];

5 Death related to AE   
aUse these alternative definitions for Grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 events when the observed or reported AE is not in 
the NCI CTCAE listing.  A semi -colon indicates ‘or’ within the alternate description  of the grade.  
bInstrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, 
managing money, etc.  
cSelf care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, 
and not bedridden.

(“Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)” 2010 ) 
 
Note that severity, a measure of intensity, is not equivalent to seriousness, a regulatory 
definition of outcome. Regardless of severity, some AEs may meet the criteria for seriousness. See Section 7.1.2 for the definition of an SAE. 
If an adverse event changes in severity during the same study period (e.g., treatment period), 
only the highest severity grade will be recorded on the eCRF . 
7.2.4 Assessment of Causality 
The investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AE s (serious and 
non-serious). An investigator’s causality asse ssment is the determination of whether there 
exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE. Causality of an AE will be assessed by [CONTACT_247067]:

The Sponsor, or its designee, is responsible for submitting reports of serious, unexpected related AE s to regulatory authorities on an expedited basis, according to the ICH E2A 
Guideline and to other regulatory authorities according to national and local regulations as required.

knowledge of the investigational product is e ssenti al for the welfare of a subject.  There is no 
specific antidote for serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_738031] a medical emergency.  
8 STATISTICAL METHODS  
Endpoints will be summarized with  descriptive statistics  by [CONTACT_6982]. For 
continuous variables, the following information will be presented: n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum. For categorical variables counts and percentages will be used. 
Baseline for all measures will be th e last recorded value prior to the start of treatment. 
8.1 Decision Rule and Sample Size  
The comparisons related to the primary and key secondary endpoints will be done in a 
hierarchical manner  to control the familywise error rate. The testing procedure will start by 
[CONTACT_738048] 8.9.4.  
A total of 170 subjects (8 5/arm) in 1:1 ratio to serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 5 mg or placebo will provide 90% 
power to detect a 25% relative reduction (placebo- adjusted ratio  of 0.75) in 24-hour objective 
cough frequency or awake objective cough frequency us ing a two -sample t -test at a 
one-sided significance level of 0.05. This assumes that 24-hour cough frequency or awake 
cough frequency follows a log- norma l distribution with a CV of 0.64. This sample size also 
considers an expected dropout rate of 15%. 
The sample size calculations have been performed in nQuery Advisor + nTerim .  
8.2 Handling of M issing D ata and Excluded Therapy Use  
For summary statistics results will generally be reported based upon observed data. Should a 
determination of treatment period (on treatment, pre -treatment) be required for AE s or 
concomitant medication but the corresponding date is missing, or is a  partial date , the 
event/medication will be considered on treatment unless the portions of the date that are available indicate this is not possible . 
In case of missing data for the primary efficacy endpoint, two selected imputation approaches are specified for the sensitivity analyses ( Section [IP_ADDRESS]). All other efficacy endpoints, 
analysis will be conducted based on the observed data only. 
8.3 Derivations of Efficacy Variables 
The 24-hour cough frequency (coughs per hour) for a specified visit is calculated as: 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Proto col MTI -110 
Version 2.0  Page 46 24-hour cough frequency = (total number of cough events during the monitoring period 
(24-hour interval))/24  
The awake cough frequency (coughs per hour) is defined as below: 
Awake  cough frequency = (total number of cough events during the monitoring period 
(24-hour interval) the subject is awake)/(Total duration (in hours) for the monitoring period 
the subject is awake)  
Awake duration (hours) is time between waking up and sleep during the 24-hour monitoring 
period.  
The cough data will contain all cough events occurring during that 24-hour monitoring 
period as well as the information about “sleep time” and “awake time”.  Any session with 
duration of recording < [ADDRESS_1008395] of session will be considered under the sleep monitoring period. For 
any session with both sleep time and awake time missing, the entire 24 -hour session will be 
considered under the awake monitoring period, unless the session has early termination of recording.   
On each collection day, the cough count, the actual cough monitoring duration (in hours), and the coughs per hour will be derived for the total 24-hour period, the awake period, and the sleep period, respectively. 
The percent change in 24 -hour coughs per hour is defined as below: 
Percent change in 24 -hour cough frequency =  
[(Change from baseline in 24-hour cough frequency×100)/( Baseline 24 -hour cough 
frequency)]  
The proportion of partici pants with ≥  30% of reduction from baseline in 24-hour cough 
frequency is the number of partici pants with ≤ -30% change in 24-hour cough frequency 
divided by [CONTACT_738049]. 8.[ADDRESS_1008396] of all subjects who receive ≥ [ADDRESS_1008397] Disposition  
An accounting of all randomiz ed subjects  by [CONTACT_247070]. Subjects  who 
discontinue study drug prem aturely or withdraw from the study will be summarized and 
listed, with a description of the reason for early termination/withdrawal.  
8.[ADDRESS_1008398]  Characteristics   
Demographic and other baseline characteristics will be summari zed. Duration of chronic 
cough (year s) will be derived as year of informed consent minus year of start date of the 
chronic cough medical history. 
8.7 Concomitant M edications   
Concomitant medications will be coded by [CONTACT_38375] (WHO) Drug 
Dictionary to Anatomical Therapeutic Cl assification (ATC) and preferred drug name. 
Concomitant medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_357546].  
8.[ADDRESS_1008399] as below:

A day within the study will be considered an “On- Therapy” day if the participant takes all 
required medication. If a subject misses a daily dose , that day is not considered an 
On-Therapy day.  
The duration of exposure for each participant will be evaluated by [CONTACT_738050].  
Percent compliance and duration of exposure to study medication will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics (mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum) for the safety analysis set.

Symbolically, the hypo theses for serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 5 mg compared to placebo can be written as:  
H0: µSP,Week 12  - µ SP,Baseline  = µPL,Week12  - µ PL,Baseline

baseline value as a covariate. The MMRM model will use all available 24-hour cough frequency data on Day 28, 56, and 84. An unstructured covariance structure will be applied for MMRM. In case the model will not converge with the unstructured covariance structure, the heterogeneous compound symmetry (CSH) will be used instead. Contrasts will be constructed to  compare the serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] [ADDRESS_1008404] -squares (LS) mean change from baseline (on the log scale) with the associated 
standard errors will be displayed for each treatment group. Estimated treatment differences (serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_140609]. placebo) along with corresponding CIs will also be presented .

An observation of zero coughs per hour will be replaced by a cough rate of 0.1/hr for the 
calculation of geometric means. If this rule is used t he table will have a footnote detailing the 
participant and treatment. Further details of the model specification, assumptions, and SAS implementation codes will be provided in the SAP. 
Furthermore, th e changes from baseline in 24 -hour cough frequency on t he original scale will 
be also analyzed using a the same MMRM model.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Sensitivity Analysis  
The primary analyses (MMRM) for assessing primary efficacy variable are valid if the 
missing data are missing at random (MAR), meaning that the probability of a value  being 
missing, conditional on the observed data and factors in the statistical model, is random and not dependent on the unknown value of the missing data point. Therefore, two sensitivity analyses under missingness not at random (MNAR) will be conducted for the primary 
efficacy variable to evaluate the robustness of efficacy results and the effect of missing data.   
Sensitivity analysis using a copy -reference multiple -imputation method will be performed to 
assess the robustness of the primary analysis base d on MMRM. In this sensitivity analysis, 
intermittent missing values will be imputed using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) 
methodology which assumes a multivariate normal distribution over all variables included in the imputation model.  This imputation  will be done by [CONTACT_1570], using MI procedure 
in SAS 9.4. This imputation will be done by [CONTACT_1570]. Then all the monotone missing values will be multiply -imputed using the imputation model built from the control group, i.e., 
assuming the missing data in the treatment group will have a profile that equals the profile of the control group for all time points (i.e., a copy-reference imputation). The missing data imputation will be implemented using PROC MI in SAS 9.[ADDRESS_1008405] variance, a pattern mixture model approximation method will also be used. Results from both the MIANALYZE and the pattern mixture model approximation will be presented as sensitivity analyses.  
An additional sensitivity analysis using the tippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] -point approach will be conducted. The 
Variant 3 of the tippi[INVESTIGATOR_738033]  (Ratitch 2013).  The technical details for the 
sensitivity analyses will be provided in the S AP.

Version 2.0  Page 52 8.9.4 Multiplicity Adjustment  
The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy profile of serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 5 mg versus placebo. The 
sequential testing procedure will be employed to control the overall Type I error rate at 5% with respect to multiple comparisons for the primary and key secondary endpoints. The procedure will be done in a hierarchical manner. The order of the testing is outlined below.  
1. Primary endpoint: serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 5 mg versus placebo 
2. Key secondary endpoint #1: serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 5 mg versus placebo 
3. Key secondary endpoint #2: serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 5 mg versus placebo 
4. Key secondary endpoint #3: serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 5 m g versus placebo  
5. Key secondary endpoint #4: serlopi[INVESTIGATOR_053] [ADDRESS_1008406] comparison is statistically significant, the comparison ranked as second will be tested, and the difference will be declared statistically significant if the one-sided p- value is 
less than 0.05. The testing will continue as long as the previously ranked objective was statistically  significant.  
All other efficacy variables will be tested at the 0.05 level of significance without multiplicity adjustment.

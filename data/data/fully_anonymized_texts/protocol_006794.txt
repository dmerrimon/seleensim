Title  
 
Oral probiotic supplementation and Group B Streptococcus rectovaginal colonization in 
pregnant women: a randomized double -blind placebo -controlled trial.  
 
Introduction and Specific Aims  
 
Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality, 
including neonatal sepsis and maternal puerperium infections. In light of significant 
consequences of GBS colonization in pregnancy, GBS screening at 35 -37 weeks’ 
gestational age and prophylaxis at time of labor is recommended in t he [LOCATION_002]. 
Although intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis effectively prevents perinatal transmission in 
colonized pregnant women, numerous challenges in this management remain, including 
allergic reactions to antibiotic use, antimicrobial resistance d evelopment, potential 
unpredictability of transient colonization, as well as drug and administration costs. 
Identifying strategies that decrease the rate of GBS colonization would be beneficial in 
reducing such obstacles.  
 
Probiotics are live microorganis ms that are thought to be healthy for the host organism.  
One of the mechanisms proposed for the potential benefit of probiotics includes balance 
of intestinal microbial environment and inhibition of pathogenic bacterial growth.  
Recently, lactobacilli -containing probiotics have been studied for use in intestinal and 
non-intestinal conditions, including urogenital infections.  Several studies have 
demonstrated that use of probiotics may reduce the incidence of bacterial vaginosis  (BV) .  
Given the potential benefits of probiotics in treatment of bacterial vaginosis, a similar 
beneficial effect of increased balance in normal vaginal microflora may reduce GBS 
colonization in pregnant women.  We hypothesize that supplementation with oral 
probiotics may reduce th e rate of GBS colonization in term pregnant women.  
  
We propose the following specific aims to examine the aforementioned hypothesis:  
1. Compare GBS rectovaginal colonization rate in pregnant women at 35 -37 weeks’ 
gestational age after oral supplementation w ith probiotics during the second and 
third trimesters with the rate in  pregnant women who receive placebo.   
2. Compare perinatal outcomes related to infectious morbidity between the two 
groups.  
 
Background  
 
Group B streptococcus (GBS) is an encapsulated gra m-positive diplococcus that 
frequently colonizes the human genital and gastrointestinal tracts, as well as the upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_265727].  Approximately 10 -30% of pregnant women in the 
[LOCATION_002] are colonized with GBS in the vaginal or r ectal area.(1) Colonization 
prevalence in pregnant women differs by [CONTACT_265736], geographic locales, and age.(1)  
 
GBS is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among newborn infants; is a common 
cause of maternal peripartum infections; and has been associated with adverse obstetric 
events. (2-8) GBS colonization of the mucous membrane is typi[INVESTIGATOR_265728].  
Vertical transmission of GBS  at the time of birth  occurs in 50 -70% of infants born to 
colonized mothers, and of these , 1-2% will develop ear ly-onset invasive disease. (2)  
Transmission may also occur per an ascending route and cause intrauterine fetal 
infection.  Maternal colonization is the primary risk factor for GBS infection in neonates 
and young infants (younger than 90 days of age).(4,9)  Other risk factors for neonatal 
infection include maternal GBS colonization density, with approximately 2.5 times 
greater risk of infant infecti on in pregnant women with heavy versus light  
colonization .(10)   
 
Neonatal infectious complications of GBS infe ction include bacteremia, sepsis, 
pneumonia, and meningitis , sometimes with  permanent neurologic sequelae, as well as 
neonatal death.(2 -4)  Maternal i nfections attributable to GBS in pregnancy include 
asymptomatic bacteriuria, urinary tract infections, int raamniotic infection or 
chorioamnionitis, and postpartum endometritis . Less commonly , pneumonia, puerperal 
sepsis, and bacteremia  can occur .  GBS colonization has  also been associated with 
obstetrical complications, including fetal demise, midgestation pre gnancy loss, preterm 
labor, preterm premature rupture of membranes, and preterm delivery. (2 -8)   
 
Consensus guidelines for prevention of perinatal GBS disease recommending either risk -
based or screening -based strategies have been issued since the early 19 90’s by [CONTACT_265737] (ACOG), American Academy of 
Pediatrics (AAP), and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  In 2002 
Schrag et al demonstrated that antenatal screening for GBS prevented approximately 
55% more cases of early -onset sepsis than the risk -based approach.(11) In August of 
2002 the CDC recommended universal prenatal screening for vaginal and rectal GBS 
colonization of all pregnant women at 35 -37 weeks’ gestation for the prevention of 
perinata l GBS disease.(4)  
  
Universal prenatal screening at 35 -37 weeks’ gestation with intrapartum antibiotic 
prophylaxis of colonized women during labor is thus far the most successful strategy for 
prevention of perinatal GBS disease .  However, there remain seve ral challenges 
pertaining to screening and treatment considerations. Although the accuracy of late 
antenatal screening cultures performed within [ADDRESS_323152] relatively high positive (87%)  and negative 
(96%) predictive values, this identification is not perfect . (12)  In reality, greater than 
10% of women may receive unnecessary treatment, while a small minority may not 
receive appropriate intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis.   
 
Overuse of a ntibiotics, which may lead to organism resistance and potential allergic 
reactions to antimicrobials, is another potential consequence of our current management 
strategy.   In women with rectovaginal GBS colonization at term, without use of 
intrapartum ant ibiotics, the incidence of invasive neonatal GBS disease ranges from 2 to 
3 cases per 1,000 live births. (3, 13) Thereby, large numbers of mothers and infants may 
be exposed to unnecessary antibiotics. Based on a [ADDRESS_323153] be treated with antibiotics to prevent 1.4 cases of 
disease. ( 14)  While administration of antibiotics does decrease GBS neonatal earl y-onset 
disease, in general the cost of large scale antibiotics use is out of proportion to the 
improvement in public health. Intravenous antibiotic therapy is costly and utilizes 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_265729].  Also, u p to 10% of women administered antibiotics in labor will 
experience some form of allergic reaction; 1 in 100,000 will die from anaphylactic  
shock.(4, 15) Women who are allergic  to penicillin and not candidates for cephalosporin 
therapy  are treated with  alternative antibiotic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_265730], 
clindamycin, and vancomycin . However, these are not well studied and may not achieve 
therapeutic levels in cord blood.  These alternative antibiotics have very limited human 
transplacental data and also may result in  greater maternal adverse events.  ( 16, 17)  
Widespread exposure to antibiotics r esults in  selectio n of resistant organisms a s recent ly 
demonstrat ed by [CONTACT_265738]  (>20%) and 
erythromycin (>30%); this resistance  may lead to reduction of anti microbial  
effectiveness.( 18-20)  Finally, risk of maternal candidiasis may increase with use of 
antibiotic s, which may in turn lead to breastfeeding difficulties.( 21)  Therefore, given 
these limitations to our current management of GBS during pregnancy and labor,  
strategies to decrease maternal colonization would be of tremendous benefit.     
 
According to the currently adopted definition by [CONTACT_265739], probiotics are defined as live 
microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on 
the host. (22) N umerous recent studies have been conducted investigating the potential 
therapeutic benefits of probiotics.  It has been proposed that the potential beneficial effect 
of probiotics  involves  improvement  of intestinal microbial balance and inhibit ion of  the 
growth of pathogenic bacteria. Recently, lactobacilli -containing probiotics have been 
studied for use in a number of intestinal and nonintestinal conditions, including 
Clostridium difficile infection, inflammatory bowel diseases, and urogenital 
infections. http://www.femalepatient.com/html/arc/sig/urog/articles/035_08_042.asp - 2#2 
(23) Investigators suggest  that imbalance in the normal vaginal bacterial flora may 
contribute to the pathogenesis of urogenital infections, especially  BV and UTI. (24)  
Thereby, r estoration of the normal vaginal flora with use of lactobacilli -containing 
probiotics has been proposed as a novel approach for the prevention and treatment of 
urogenital infections. ( 23)  
Genitourinary infections in women are often characterized by [CONTACT_265740], with a transformation from a predominance of lactobacilli to coliform pathogens . 
This can occur  as a result of multiple factors, inclu ding hormone deficiency, sexual 
activity, and contraception. (25)  In order for probiotics to be effective in the prevention or 
treatment of urogenital infections, lactobacilli must  exhibit antibacterial activity.(26)  One 
antibacterial property of lactobaci lli is the ability to maintain an acidic pH <4.5, which is 
conducive to lactobacilli replication and their subsequent production of antibacterial 
metabolites such as bacteriocin and hydrogen peroxide.  It has been noted that different 
strains of lactobacill i produce varying amounts of these substances. (27)  Lactobacilli -
containing probiotics also offer protection by [CONTACT_265741], which interfere 
with growth and adhesion of organisms such as Escherichia coli and Enterococcus 
faecalis to uroepi[INVESTIGATOR_265731].(28)  Finally, lactobacilli may also block adhesion or 
displace uropathogens that are adherent to vaginal epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663]. (29)  
Recent studies and reviews have demonstrated successful treatment of BV with 
probiotics  in majority of trials.(30 -39)   These trials generally included  young, healthy, 
premenopausal women who were treated with lactobacilli -containing probiotics. Several 
studies included pregnant women, as well.(31,32)  Most protocols included probiotics   
administered intravaginally , howe ver oral route has also proven successful for treatment 
of BV .(37) Studies differed by [CONTACT_265742], concentrations, and preparations of lactobacilli 
used, including Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus 
reuteri, and Lactobacillus cr ispatus. The utility of probiotics for either prevention or 
adjunctive treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis  and urinary tract infections  has yet to be 
proven, since most studies included in recent reviews showed no benefit and conflicting 
results. http://www.femalepatient.com/html/arc/sig/urog/articles/035_08_042.asp - 5#5 
(26,30)  The conflicting data may be due  to heterogeneity of the strains ,   preparations of 
lactobacilli used , route of administration, and duration of  treatment .   
Several recent studies have also reported  probiotics to be safe for use during pregnancy 
without  demonstrate d adverse perinatal outcomes.  (40, 41) However, a recent review of 
risks asso ciated with probiotic use identified major and minor risk factors for associated 
infectious morbidities, including immunocompromised status, premature infants, central 
venous catheter, impaired intestinal epi[INVESTIGATOR_170743], administration of probiotic by 
[CONTACT_265743], concomitant use of broad spectrum antibiotics, probiotics with high 
mucosal adhesion or known pathogenecity, and cardiac valvular disease. (42)  
Specifically, pregnancy was not included as a risk factor . While caution for adverse 
effects must be maintained with the growing use of probiotics, the majority of the 
available evidence to date suggests that probiotics are safe, except in limited 
circumstances. Larger studies have not yet reproduced these findings . Furthermore, no 
major side effects f rom the use of probiotics were reported in the studies on genitourinary 
infections. All preparations, regardless of strain and route of administration, were 
tolerable and caused minimal adverse effects in healthy, young, premenopausal women.  
 
Review of th e literature does not demonstrate any specific strains of probiotic organisms 
that are known to be effective in displacing GBS either in the gut or in the reproductive 
tract and no study has investigated whether probiotics may effect rectovaginal 
colonizat ion in pregnant women. However, the  biological  plausibility exists that there 
may be a beneficial effect of decreased GBS colonization given observed associations of 
reduction of other genital infections with probi otic therapy.

F. Agents:  
1. Treatment arm: Study probiotic dietary supplement arm will consist of 
1 capsule ( >1 billion CFU/capsule ) daily including t wo strains, 
Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR -[ADDRESS_323155] be en shown to reduce the incidence of bacterial vaginosis and 
candidiasis.  (43) Those two strains are present in Jarrow’s Femdophilus, 
which is produced by [CONTACT_265744]. Shelf life is two years w hen stored at room temperatu re (max 25 
degrees Celsius ).  
2. Control arm: Placebo arm will consist of one inert (heat inactivated) 
capsule daily.   
 
G. Study Drug and Placebo Supply, Transport, and Storage :  
1. Chr Hansen A/S will provide the  active  probiotic dietary supplement 
and p lacebo oral tablets for 372 patients  (186 per arm of the trial .)  
However, the company providing the study probiotic  dietary supplement 
and placebo will not have access to preliminary data during the conduct of 
the study and will not have the right of revi ew of the  results  prior to 
publication.  In summary, 27,[ADDRESS_323156] and 27,900 doses of 
placebo will be provided.  (Appendix 1) Ca psules will be packed in 
aluminum  tubes and these will then be packed in cardboard boxes and sent 
by [CONTACT_265745]. The tubes containing the 
capsules will be packed such that no physical damage will occur  to the 
individual capsules . Refrigeration is not necessary  since bacteria count  of 
minimum [ADDRESS_323157] sunlight when stored.  The manufacturer recommends 5 degrees 
Celsius storage to preserve bacterial potency if more than 6 months of 
storage is expected.  Study participants w ill be instructed to store capsules 
outside of children’s reach and at room temperature and to avoid direct 
sun exposure to capsules.  
 
H. Patient Recruitment:  
1. Pregnant study subjects who meet inclusion criteria will be recruited 
prior to 28 weeks’ gestational age at one of the following collaborative 
sites by [CONTACT_265746] -investigator or study staff:  LPCH Obstetrics 
Clinic and the collaborating sites of AWH Obstetrics and Gynecology 
Clinic, other private obstetric -gynecology offices in Santa Cruz, and 
homes of patients who have elected to receive prenatal care and delivery at 
home by [CONTACT_265747], one of the co -investigators of this study.      
 
I. Randomization Strategy:  
1. Manufacturer will send identica l probiotic and placebo capsules .  The 
probiotic and placebo capsules will be  originally  packed in separate 
containers, labeled as designated probiotic versus placebo  for each specific 
study enrollee  (with study material  information only available to the  
designated  pharmacist  at LPCH ). The designated  pharmacist  at LPCH will 
be responsible for randomization assignment  based on our pre -generated 
randomization table and distribution of study material to research 
coordinator for disbursement to enrollees  at all sites .  
a. Investigators will receive individual DEIDENTIFIED  study 
material ( patient  probiotic versus placebo tubes ) coded by a unique 
random number .  
b. Each enrolled patient will receive supplies at study visit. . 
c. At conclusion of study, the participant randomization arm will 
be identified by [CONTACT_265748].  
 
J. Compliance Assessment:  
1. Compliance with study dru g (probiotic versus placebo) will be assessed 
by [CONTACT_6270] -reported and provider mechanisms at monthly visits.  
2. Subjects will be asked by [CONTACT_265749].  
3. Investigators  will perform capsule cou nt of the subject ’s monthly 
distributed study drug.   
4. Investigators will provide subjects with a single aluminum tube of 30 
capsules for the next monthly period.  
 
 
I. Clinical P rotocol :   
1. Investigators will recruit study participants up to 28 weeks’  
gestational age.  
2. Following informed patient consent, patients  will be blindly randomized 
to either study probiotic dietary supplement  or place bo per computer 
generated randomization  table .   
3. A hard -copy questionnaire/ data sheet will be generated for each patient 
and will be labeled with patient’s unique number, name [CONTACT_265752] .  
4. Subjects will be initiated on probiotic  or placebo consisting of one 
capsule daily between 20 -28 weeks ’ gestation  and continued until 
delivery .  Once enrolled, patients will receive  a study  questionnaire to 
complete with study investigator(s) or study coordinator(s)  and a monthly 
supply of probiotic dietary supplement vs. placebo  either at enrollment or 
subsequent study visit.   Subjects will be instructed to store capsules away 
from sun an d consume  1 capsule  with food every day at the same time (as 
determined to be the most convenient time for that patient).  
5. Women diagnosed with GBS bacteriuria during the index pregnancy 
will be enrolled/maintained in the study, will have routine GBS cul tures at 
35-[ADDRESS_323158] of care, subjects will undergo rectovaginal 
culture  for GBS at 35-37 weeks ’ gestat ion. Any subject  who tests positive 
will be treated with intrapartum intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis  per 
routine GBS management protocol.  
7. Women who deliver preterm will receive chemoprophylaxis unless their 
GBS status within the most proximate 4 wee ks is known  per routine GBS 
management protocol.  We will obtain a culture prior to initiation of 
antibiotics in those women delivering preterm without known group B 
strep status . 
8. Study visits will be conducted during routine monthly prenatal 
appointment s to assess adverse events, study treatment compliance, and to 
dispense subsequent 30 -day supply of probiotic or placebo capsules. 
Patients will complete a study visit questionnaire  with the investigator (s)  
or study coordinator (s). Patients will also receive an additional monthly 
allotment of 30 capsules.  The capsule  bottle from the previous cycle will 
be collected and dated  if there are capsules remaining in the bottle.  
Remaining capsules will be counted and refrigerated for future use.  
9. Patient questionnaire/database assessing adverse events will be 
amended at each study visit, which will occur monthly.  The 
questionnaire/database will assess adverse events, includin g rash, 
significant nausea/vomiting, significant diarrhea, persistent fever, and 
compliance data.  The questionnaire will also remind patients that all 
adverse events must be reported to the Protocol Director immediately at 
all times.  
10. Additionally, sub jects may opt to have serial vaginal swabs collected 
to assess potential beneficial effects of probiotics on the vaginal 
microbiota  and BV status . Vaginal swabs will be collected (either by [CONTACT_265750] -collected by [CONTACT_87755]). Swab s will be 
inserted 1 -2 inches into the vaginal introitus and spun  for 20 seconds and 
then withdrawn. Swabs will be collected at the following time points: prior 
to probiotic/placebo initiation , every 1 -4 weeks from time of enrollment to 
time of delivery, and postpartum serially  up to 12 mont hs. These swabs 
will be stored at -20 degrees Celsius or colder for additional microbiologic 
analyses.  
11. Additionally, placental tissue may be collected at time of delivery 
for possible future microbiome and/or other analyses.  
12. Labor: The patient will receive standard delivery and newborn care. 
Patients with a positive GBS culture will be treated with standard 
antibiot ics in labor.  
13. Postpartum and neonatal care: The patient will receive routine 
postpartum care per the obstetric team. Data regarding her postpartum 
course and neonatal outcomes will be collected.  
 
G. Sample size calculation:  
1. The baseline rectovagin al GBS colonization is approximately 25% in  
recent years in  our practice, we have powered the study to identify a  40% 
reduction of GBS colonization to 15%.  Using a two -tailed alpha of 0.05, 
133 patients per arm (26 6 patients total) are needed to fulfill a  power of 
80% to detect a difference of 40% from current baseline GBS colonization  
of 25% . 
2. Given anticipated 30% drop out/lost to follow -up and 10% preterm 
delivery prior to 35 -37 weeks’ gestation, we propose increasing our 
sample size by 40% to account  for this subject loss.  Therefore, we 
propose recruitment of 372 patients total (186 in each arm).  
 
H. Statistics:  
1. Analysis will be by [CONTACT_118067].  Demographic data, specific 
information regarding the course of labor, and outcome variables wi ll be 
collected on printed and numbered data sheets and entered into a relational 
database (Access; Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). All data 
management and analysis will be performed using STATA version 7 
software (StataCorp – College Station, TX).  D escriptive statistics will be 
performed.  All tests of significance will be [ADDRESS_323159].  
 
I. Data safety and monitoring plans:  
1. The Protocol Director (PD) will be responsible for monitoring data 
collected.  
2.  Patient questionnaire/database assessing adverse events will be 
completed at each study visits, approxi mately every month.  The 
questionnaire will assess adverse events, including rash, significant 
nausea/vomiting, significant diarrhea, persistent fevers.  The 
questionnaire/database will also remind patients that such events must be 
reported to the Protocol  Director immediately at all times.  
3. Serious adverse events will be reported to the PD within one week.  An 
interim analysis will be conducted to when primary outcome data is 
available for [ADDRESS_323160] an will be assessed 
monthly.  
5. The following will be monitored:  
a. Side effects related to consumption of the probiotic or placebo 
capsules  
b. Rates of compliance  
c. GBS colonization culture results  
d. Neonatal morbidity or mortality, including but not l imited to 
infection and duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
e. Maternal morbidity and mortality, including but not limited to 
postpartum infection, complications, and duration of

depending on when all subjects are identified and treatment is completed.      
After obtaining consent, the study participant will undergo a complete history, head, neck, and 
cranial nerve exam. Facial functi on will be evaluated with House-Brackmann (H -B) scoring 
system.  For participants with a high suspi[INVESTIGATOR_103749], Lyme disease 
serology will be drawn. Electroneurography ( ENoG) and electromyography ( EMG) testing will 
be performed on patients with complete facial nerve paralysis.   Every participant will be treated 
with oral steroids (prednisone 60 mg for 5 days followed by a 5 day taper), unless they are 
unable to for medical reasons.  
The study participants will then be randomized into the control group or the treatment group. If 
randomized to the treatment group, the patient will undergo one intratympanic steroid injection 
every [ADDRESS_114766] group of patients 
will include those patients that are unable to take oral steroids for medical reasons (such as 
diabetes); these patients will only receive the intratympanic injection. An audiogram and 
tympanography testing will be performed on patients that are randomized to receive an 
intratympanic injection (Group 2) or are placed in Group [ADDRESS_114767] occurrence in the text.  
 
4.  Background Information  
 
Facial nerve paralysis is due to inflammation surrounding the facial nerve. Current clinical 
practice guidelines for treatment of  facial nerve paralysis recommend a 10 day course of oral 
steroids +/ - oral acyclovir. Treatment should begin within 72 hours of symptom onset. In patients 
with complete facial paralysis, electrodiagnostic testing should be offered to the patient (1- 2). In 
patients with 90% degeneration on electroneuronography (ENoG) testing, facial nerve 
decompression may be considered but is not a current recommendation.  
In 1973, Bryant reported on ten cases where intratympanic steroid injection was used for the 
treatment of Bell’s palsy (3). All but one of these patients had complete recovery of their facial 
nerve function. The remaining patient had 75% recovery. None of these patients suffered 
complications from the injections. The next study published on intratympanic steroid injection

 for Bell’s palsy was not published until 2014 (4). It was a randomized control trial that divided 
patients into standard treatment (oral steroids and acyclovir) versus standard treatment with 
intratympanic steroid injection. There was not a statistically s ignificant difference between the 
complete recovery rate of the control group and of the intratympanic steroid group; however, the 
time to recovery was significantly shorter in the intratympanic steroid injection group as 
compared to the control group.  Limitations of this study include small sample size and high 
attrition rate.  
There have not been any other studies published in the literature looking at improving facial 
nerve recovery in idiopathic facial nerve paralysis with the use of intratympanic steroid 
injections.  
 
5.  Trial Objectives and Purpose  
 
The question proposed by [CONTACT_103754]:  
Does intratympanic steroid injection improve the complete recovery rate of patients with 
idiopathic facial nerve paralysis?  
Does intratympanic steroid injection hasten the time to recovery in patients with idiopathic facial 
nerve paralysis?  
Are there significantly more adverse effects with the use of intratympanic steroid injection as 
compared to oral steroids in patients with idiopathic facial nerve paralysis?  
 
The trial seeks to provide evidence that intratympanic steroid injection are acceptable and 
successful adjuncts to treatment of idiopathic facial nerve paralysis.  
 
To answer this question, a prospective, single-blinded, randomized trial will be performed. The 
subjects will be randomized into the treatment group and the control group. The control group 
will receive oral steroids which is the current standard of care. Patients in the treatment group 
will receive oral steroids AND intratympanic steroid injections. The patient’s will not be blinded 
because the patient will be undergoing an in-office procedure. It has been found to be unethical 
to perform sham procedures in patients. A third group of patients will consist of those patients 
that are unable to take oral steroids for medical reasons.  These patients will only receive the intratympanic injection and they are placed in this group for medical reasons only (no 
randomization into this group). The patients will be examined and scored using House-
Brackmann scoring system by a blinded investigator trained in otolaryngology.

Methodology:   
Screening  
Patients age [ADDRESS_114768] ion will be evaluated with H -B scoring system. In patients where there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_103750], Lyme disease serology will be performed. Electroneurography ( ENoG) and 
electromyography ( EMG) testing will be performed on patients with complete paralysis  only.  
 
Treatment Phase  
Participant s in groups 1 & 2 will be treated  with steroids (prednisone 60 mg for 5 days followed 
by a 5 day taper).  Patients will then be randomized into either control group (Group 1) or  
treatment group (Group 2) . Patients in Group 2 will undergo intratympanic steroid injection. An 
audiogram and tympanography testing will be performed prior to injections.  
 
Participants unable to take oral steroids for medical reasons (such as diabetes) will be placed in 
Group 3. These participants will receive intratympanic steroid injections only. An audiogram and 
tympanography testing will be performed prior to injections.  
 
Injection will be up to 1cc of dexamethasone 24mg/ mL. The procedure will be performed at 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_103751] a microscope. Local anesthesia will be achieved with topi[INVESTIGATOR_103752]. A 
myringotomy will be made in the ty mpanic membrane. A [ADDRESS_114769]'s head turned [ADDRESS_114770]- specific factors.

[ADDRESS_114771] month after completion of treatment. From 
that point, patients will be evaluated monthly until complete recovery.  
 
Procedures:  
Participants are identified in clinic to have idiopathic facial nerve paralysis. If they meet 
inclusion criteria, they will then be asked to participate in the study and sign the consent form. 
Participants will undergo a complete medical history including facial nerve paralysis history, 
head, neck, and cranial nerve exam. Facial function will be evaluated with H -B scoring system.  
Lyme disease serology will be drawn on patients for which there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_103753] 
(SOC). Electroneurography ( ENoG) and electromyography ( EMG) testing will be performed 
only on patients with complete paralysis , as part of the standard of care (SOC) work -up. Next, 
patients in Groups 1 & [ADDRESS_114772] month 
after the completion of treatment. From that point, patients will be evaluated monthly. All 
patients Group 2 & [ADDRESS_114773]- treatment follow -up visits to allow for 2 independent blinded reviewers to determine facial 
nerve recovery and H -B score; a third unblinded review will be performed by [CONTACT_30780].  
 
Adverse effects of the treatment will be assessed at each visit.  
 
7.  Selection and Withdrawal of Subjects

Exclusion Criteria:  
1. Another cause of facial nerve paralysis that is not idiopathic 
2. Otologic disease including otitis media, temporal bone fracture, a previous history 
of facial nerve palsy in either side, history of otologic surgery, and suspected 
Ramsay Hunt syndrome .  
3. Systemic disease including history of tuberculosis, history of head and neck 
cancer, other neurological disorders, recent use of ototoxic medications, liver or 
renal dysfunction, and other illnesses that would contraindicate the use of high-
dose steroid therapy.  
4. Pregnancy  
 
Withdrawal Criteria:  
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to their care.  They may 
also be discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator for lack of adherence to 
study treatment or visit schedules or adverse events.  The Investigator may also withdraw 
subjects who violate the study plan, or to protect the subject for reasons of safety or for 
administrative reasons.  It will be documented whether or not each subject completes the clinical 
study. If the Investigator becomes aware of any serious, related adverse events after the subject 
completes or withdraws from the study, they will be recorded in the source documents and on the 
case report form.  
 
8.  Treatment of Subjects  
 
Participant s in Groups 1 & 2 will be treated with steroids (prednisone 60 mg for 5 days followed 
by 5 day taper) as defined by [CONTACT_103755]. Patients in Group [ADDRESS_114774] any 
further treatment. Patients in Group 2 & [ADDRESS_114775] of treatment associated with facial nerve paralysis, including any tests that the physician feels are necessary and all medications . Subjects who are randomized to one of the groups to 
receive the intratympanic injections  will not be responsible for the added costs of the injection 
(which include the medication and phenol), the audiogram and tympanometry, and extra office visits to receive each injection.

and when resolved will be recorded. 
 
All adverse events will be reported to the IRB and the Otolaryngology Department Quality 
Assurance.  Admission of a trial participant to an emergency room or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15349].    
 
11.  Statistics  
 
A sample calculation was performed for the number of subjects to be enrolled in order to prove 
superiority of oral steroids + intratympanic steroids over oral steroids alone. The assumption was 
made that a 20% increase in primary outcome of complete recovery would be significant.  A 
sample size of [ADDRESS_114777] a difference at a power greater than 80% and an alpha of 0.05.  To account for potential testing or data collection errors, we will collect data on 30 subjects treated with oral steroids and intratympanic steroid injections, as well as 30 controls 
treated with oral steroids on ly, for a total of 60 subjects. Data will be collected on up to 30 
additional subjects that are placed into Group 3 for medical reasons; therefore total number of 
subjects to be recruited is 90.
 
 
12.  Direct Access to Source Data/Documents  
 
The investigators will permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory 
inspection(s) by [CONTACT_20618]/documents.

13.  Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
 
The integrity of the data collected will be maintained by [CONTACT_103756] ( control vs. treatment) .  All subjects are being treated using standard protocols. 
Even though participants will not be fully blinded, the data collected is reliable because it is 
randomized and objective measures will  be obtained. Objective measures for this study include 
complete recovery of facial nerve function, time to complete recovery of facial nerve function, 
improvement of facial nerve function within 3 weeks, and time to initial improvement of facial 
nerve function. The University’s biostatistics group can view any data collected prior to 
publication.  
 
14.  Ethics  
 
A randomized study involving the adult population is subject to ethical as well as scientific 
considerations. The patients will not be blinded because it is unethical to perform a sham 
procedure. HIPAA guidelines will be followed in order to protect the privacy of study 
participants. The Otolaryngology community stands to benefit significantly from this study, as 
results will potentially yield information which will be used to improve outcomes of patients 
with facial nerve paralysis as this can be a debilitating disease process.

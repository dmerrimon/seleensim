3.Abstract:
It is important to highlight the fact that the bariatric surgery intervention itself is NOT a part of
this research protocol.  The UFHealth Shands Bariatric Surgical Team is operating
independently of this study, with regard to decisions involving the s uitability of candidates for
bariatric surgery.  The  research team is not involved in any of those patient and physician
decisions.  Once patients have decided to move forward with bariatric surgery , they  will be
provided information on the WISE Brain Study, and be given an option of participating in
research  that will run  in parallel to their  surgical intervention .  This study is designed to
examine the effects of the bariatric surgery  and resultant weight loss  on cognition.
The proposed study will delineate mechanism s underlying the effect  of chronic obesity on brain
functioning and determine if cognitive benefits of bariatric surgery and weight loss contribute to
enhanced cerebral metabolic or hemodynamic function a ssessed using multimodal
neuroimaging methods. The contribution of post -surgical improvements in diabetes -associated
insulin -glucose disturbances will be tested.  Obesity has reached epi[INVESTIGATOR_504751] a major public health problem, contributing to var ious comorbid medical conditions,
including brain disturbances. There is increasing evidence that chronic obesity may adversely
affect the brain, even in the absence of comorbid diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular
disease, and stroke. We have previo usly shown that elevated body mass index (BMI) is
associated with reduced cognitive function. Increasingly, bariatric surgery is being used as a

PI [CONTACT_15261] 1/20/[ADDRESS_649885], but  also changes in underlying risk factors, such as 
improved metabolic function, and remission of type -2 diabetes. Neuroimaging provides a 
potentially powerful biomarker of alterations in brain structure and function (e.g., FMRI), as well 
as cerebral pathoph ysiology. To date, no published studies have examined neuronal, 
metabolic and vascular brain changes following bariatric surgery as proposed in this study. Our 
preliminary neuroimaging data indicates enhanced functional brain response on FMRI, 
increased re gional cerebral blood flow on arterial spin labeling (ASL), and changes in cerebral 
metabolite levels on magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).   We hypothesize that: 1) 
Cerebral metabolic and hemodynamic disturbances linked to obesity adversely affect bra in 
function (evident from cognitive testing and FMRI); 2) Weight loss and associated metabolic 
changes post -bariatric surgery improve brain functions; and 3) Enhanced neurocognitive and 
neuronal function (FMRI) are due to improved cerebral metabolic ( MRS) and vascular (ASL) 
function. Remission of diabetes is expected to be one factor accounting for these effects, 
though this effect will also be tied to improved cerebral (MRS) and systemic (e.g., serum 
cytokines) metabolic health and cerebral perfusion (ASL). A prospective longitudinal cohort 
matched design will be used to assess changes in these neuroimaging indices, pre - and post -
surgery and relative non -surgical obese controls. The groups will have equal proportions of 
diabetics and non -diabetics with  obesity, enabling us to test its influence. By [CONTACT_504781], this study capi[INVESTIGATOR_340873] a powerful natural 
experimental manipulation that can provide a unique window into the effects of obesity and 
weight loss on the brain.   
 
4. Background:  
 
There is mounting evidence  that severe obes ity is a risk factor for brain dysfunction. This 
study e xamines the effects of obesity on the brain but moves beyond previous resea rch by 
[CONTACT_504782]. The proposed  study has 
compelling scientific, clinical, and public health significance. 
Public health/clinical significanc e: 1) Obesity is a major public health problem contributing 
to various medical p roblems that affect mortality and morbidity26; 2) Currently, over 15 million 
Americans  (1 in 20) a re severely obese,  and the prevalence  of severe obesity is 
acce lerating27. Severe obes ity has major pub lic health and  socioecono mic consequences,  
including increasing health care expenditures2 , and reducing produc tivity 28 29 and quality of 
life (QOL) 30; 3) Severely obese  people often experience  neurocogn itive impairments that 
further d iminish health status, health care beha vior and utilization, treatment adherence, and 
QOL; 4) No study has used neu roimaging approach es to examine whether dramatic weight

Protocol 201400034  
PI [CONTACT_15261] 1/20/2022  loss via bariatric surgery produces  changes  in obes ity-related brain dysfunction; 5) Evidence  
of improved brain function post-surgically would motivate future dose -respo nse resea rch to 
determine whether benefits are achieved from more modest weight loss through beha vioral 
and pharmacological treatments; 6) Biomarkers of obes ity-related brain disturbance  may be 
identified that may inform and  enhance  future clinical p ractice, providing additional rationale 
for agg ressively treating obes ity in peop le at risk for brain dysfunction; 7) Evidence  of obes ity-
asso ciated brain dysfunction may signal a need  for interventions to ensu re adherence  to post-
operative beha vioral de mands. 
Adult obes ity is highly prevalent and affects health as peop le age. Millions of obese  
Americans  are now  in middle age, a period of life when risk for more serious medical p roblems 
increases significantly31-33. Obesity affects over 40% of these  adults, and severe obes ity 
[body  mass index  (BMI) ≥ 40 kg/m2] is increasing at twice the rate of moderate obes ity27. 
Severely obese adults have increased  risk for co-morbidities, with over 75% developi[INVESTIGATOR_504752] (e.g., diabetes, h ypertension, a rthritis) with advanced  age 27,34-41. 
Cognitive dysfunction affects health status, QOL, and  treatment adhe rence. Brain 
dysfunction occu rs seconda ry to illness  that increases  mortality, and it adversely affects health 
status42-46. Even mild cogn itive deficits affect QOL, diet, physical ac tivity, and other health 
beha viors45,47-49, and they are often found to be a stronger predictor of health outcome than 
other c linical factors42, but they typi[INVESTIGATOR_504753] a ttention. 
Obesity-assoc iated metabolic and vascu lar disturbances  contribute to brain 
dysfunction. Diabetes and vascu lar disease  are among the most common cond itions 
resulting from se vere obes ity50-60. It is now well-established  that chronic diabetes and 
vascu lar disease con tribute to brain dysfunction19,20,61-68 25,58-60,69-71. These  
effects occur e ven in the absence  of large vessel s troke19,62,65,67, increasing the risk 
for de mentia later in life 14-15,18-20,22. Accordingly, obesity-assoc iated brain 
dysfunction has major pu blic health implications as the U.S. popu lation ages  and the 
obes ity epi[INVESTIGATOR_504754]. This provides a strong rationale for the proposed study. 
Cognitive dysfunction affects medical and surgical outcome42,43,72. Furthermore, 
people with cogn itive deficits lose less weight following bariatric surgery (see preliminary 
data; se ction C.10). 
Obesity is a modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline and diminished  brain health. 
Weight reduc tion has been  shown to improve health status and reduce  disease  risk73-75. 
Our past studies indicate that cogn itive functions also improves with weight loss following 
bariatric surgery (see preliminary data)17,18,76. 
Bariatric surgery is effective and increasingly popu lar. The prevalence  and refractoriness  
of severe obes ity led to bariatric surgery becoming an established  treatment for se vere obes ity 
77. Bariatric surgeries in the U.S. increased  over 14-fold (from 13 ,386 to > 210,000) from 1998  
to 2010 78. The surgery is an effective method for rapi[INVESTIGATOR_504755], 
 
4 
Protocol 201400034  
PI [CONTACT_15261] 1/20/[ADDRESS_649886] severely obese  patients lose 50% to 75% of their excess weight within two 
years post-surgery, with many maintaining this weight loss for [ADDRESS_649887]-effective relative to life-long 
pharmacological and  dietary manage ment 88. 
Neuroimaging may provide powerful biomarkers. Neuroimaging has revolutionized 
neuroscience, facilitating brain-beha vior research. Fun ctional magnetic resonance  imaging 
(FMRI) measu res brain respons es during cogn itive-beha vioral tasks89-93. Arterial sp in 
labeling (ASL) perfusion imaging and magnetic resonance spec troscopy  (MRS) enab le 
cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral metabolic dysfunction to be assessed.  These MR 
techn iques  are noninvasive, have excellent neuroana tomic resolution, and  have excellent 
sensitivity for detecting and measu ring subtle functional b rain changes  over time. Multimodal 
imaging is being used increasingly clinically, enab ling simultaneous  measurement of brain 
structure, function, and  pathoph ysiology. Neuroimaging is relatively inexpensive when 
performed concurrently and  is highly sens itive to treatment effects, 94-[ADDRESS_649888] shown greater white matter 
integrity103, as well as improvements on metabolic indices of oxidative stress and glucose 
metabolism75,104 and alterations in FMRI brain response  on attention-executive and cue 
reactivity tasks among peop le who succes sfully maintained weight loss 105-107. A few case  
reports of neuroimaging show  adverse brain effects from ba riatric surgery, although  these  
cases are not representative108-112. Studies of changes  in neuronal function (FMRI), 
cerebral pe rfusion (ASL), and  metabolic function (MRS) following significant weight loss are 
needed.  
Treatment implications. Findings from this study may lead to new strategies for treating 
and p reventing brain dysfunction, perhaps  even slowing the onset of neurodegenerative 
brain changes  26. Our findings may eventually influence  medical dec ision-making, 
particularly if the results sugge st that rapid and d ramatic weight loss reduces  subseque nt 
obesity-related brain dysfunction. The results may also signal a  need for add itional pa tient 
education/training to ensure adhe rence  to postoperative beha vioral recommendations. 
Positive findings would also motivate future research focused  on dose-response  and 
whether more modest weight loss via lifestyle intervention or pha rmacological treatment 
produc es some benefits for brain health. 
Scientific significance. The proposed  study provides a unique opportunity to examine 
the effects of severe obes ity and surgically induced  weight loss on the brain. Past studies 
of obes ity and the brain have largely been  either ep idemiological or  observational. By 
[CONTACT_504783] n euroimaging pre- and post-bariatric surgery, we can

Protocol 201400034  
PI [CONTACT_15261] 1/20/[ADDRESS_649889]-surgery.  
We will acco mplish several scientific objectives: 1) The study will provide the most 
comprehens ive information to date on the effects of obes ity on cerebral metabolic, 
vascu lar, and  neural functions; 2) The longitudinal des ign will elucidate the trajectory of 
cogn itive change  relative to weight loss and changes in diabetes 
and metabolite-vascu lar status; 3) We will determine whether changes  in specific risk factors 
(e.g., diabetes, sleep apnea) mediate these effects; 4) We will exp lore the potential value of 
functional ne uroimaging indices as biomarkers of subtle cognitive change;  5) We will 
characterize the relationship between systemic and cerebral inflammatory processes  by 
[CONTACT_504784]; 6) Bariatric surgery provides a unique 
experimental app roach  that goes  beyond what can be learned from pa st observational 
studies, pa rticularly since s ignificant weight loss will occur relatively quickly and without the 
intensity of effort required by [CONTACT_504785]; 7) The scientific significance  likely 
extends  beyond obes ity, providing insights into mechan isms that may contribute to vascu lar 
cogn itive impairment and cogn itive aging, and perhaps  even neurodeg eneration. 
 
5. Specific Aims:  
 
A. The proposed study is motivated by [CONTACT_504786] : 
 
1. To obtain preliminary multimodal neuroimaging  data on community dwelling adults, 
including :  
 
Cohort #1 - Surgical Candidates  for Bariatric Surgery (BMI> 35 kg/m2) the University of 
[LOCATION_012], (goal n=120 ) with Type 2 Diabetes (60) and Non -Diabetic (60)  
 
Cohort #2 - Obese Controls  (BMI >35 kg/m2) Individuals ages 20+ in the Gainesville  
community and North [LOCATION_012] region  (goal n= 60) with Type 2 Diabetes (30) and Non -
Diabetic (30)  who will not chose Bariatric Surgery  
 
  
 
 
 
Neuroimaging :  The rationale for incorporating neuroimaging is relatively intuitive. There is 
a compelling need for in vivo biomarker discovery and validation for the purposes of in vivo 
biomarkers that can be used to assess brain structure, function and pathophysiology, and 
that may also be predictive of subsequent functional change as people age, as well as 
responsive to interventions aimed at preventing cognitive decline, MCI and demen tia. There 
is mounting evidence that vascular and metabolic factors co ntribute to the development of 
brain dysfunction in the elderly, and that their effects likely begin long before overt 
symptoms are apparent. A greater understanding of the influence of these and other risk 
factors on the aging brain is needed, particularl y research directed at underlying 
neuropathological and potentially modifiable mechanisms linked to these factors. The 
proposed study will provide preliminary data from several neuroimaging modalities that will 
 
6 
Protocol 201400034  
PI [CONTACT_15261] 1/20/[ADDRESS_649890] data on the cognitive module of the NIH Toolbox . (See Appendix D for 
descriptions and summary screen shots)  
  
Cognitive assessment : The rationale for collecting cognitive data using the NIH Tool Box 
was ba sed on two major considerations:   
1) NIA has a vested interest in investigators using the Tool Box in large scale studies and 
randomized controlled trials of the aging brain;  
2) It was important for purposes of the proposed study to measure cognition at the same 
time point as the neuroimaging assessment; prior to surgical intervention, [ADDRESS_649891].  Cohen has attended an NIA sponsored meeting  in Washington, D.C, in  which the 
Toolbox was unveiled to researchers to determine its psychometric characteristics, feasibility 
of use and also to reinforce our willingness to consider this for inclusion in this study.  Data 
obtained to date suggests that it is highly reliable and has validity relative to established 
neuropsychological tests. The assessment approach’s inclusion in this large scale study 
illustrates its relevance in the mission of studying dia betes and metabolic factors affecting 
health and functional outcomes.   
3. To collect blood samples  from participants for analysis and comparison to other measures 
previously described.  
 
We will obtain a  serum biomarker panel of cytokines and other molecules sensitive to 
systemic inflammation, metabolic and vascular pathophysiology. Processing will occur in [CONTACT_504822]’s laboratory.  Potential analyses using Luminex technology include proteonic 
analysis on cytokines, inflammatory biomarkers, metabolic biomarkers and 
neurodegenerative biomarkers.  Concentrations of the biomarkers will be examined relative 
to the MRI indices, particularly the proton MRS cerebral metabolites, providing information 
the cor respondence between systemic inflammatory processes evident in the blood and 
cerebral metabolite disturbances.  The MRS indices (choline (Cho), myo-inositol  (MI), N -
acetyl aspartate (NAA) and glutamate -glutamine (GLX)) provide information regarding 
neuronal dysfunction and loss and also inflammatory processes occurring in the brain, as 
described in our previous studies.  A blood sample to measure HBA1C (3 month sugar 
level) will be sent off to Quest Laboratories, with a de -identif ied participant number only.    
Because only the CAM -CTRP billing information and a participant number will be submitted, 
there will be no opportunity for a billing mistake to take pla ce, w hich protects the 
participants. 5 mL aliquots of blood will be sent to Avera in South Dakota for genetic 
sequencing . The data produced by [CONTACT_504787] (digi tal strings of DNA nucleotides), as well as de -
identified demographic and comorbidity data from WISE, will be sent to Sarah Me dland 
laboratory in Australia for further analysis. The genetic  sequences that result from these 
analyses are short fragments of DNA from various genes that have relevance to the WISE 
study  (relation to obesity, cognition, etc.) . These sequences do not contain enough genetic 
information to enable for future identification of specific participants. Blood samples and 
accompanying  data will be  labeled with only a de -identified participant label and blood will 
be discarded as bi ohazardous waste after analysis. As part of our collaboration, t he genetic 
sequences derived by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Sarah Me dland in Australia will be entered into a larger database 
of the ENIGMA obesity workgroup, which contains similar data from investigators around the

PI [CONTACT_15261] 1/20/[ADDRESS_649892] an 
overnight in -lab sleep study and CPAP therapy prescribed as needed prior to undergoing 
surgery.  The results of the prescribed sleep study will be obtained from the participant ’s 
medical record.  
 
B. The specific study aims are as follows:  The goal of the proposed study is to delineate 
mechanisms underlying the effects of chronic obesity on brain functioning, and the basis for 
improved neurocognitive performance following bariatric surgery induced weight loss. We will use 
multimodal neuroima ging methods to determine whether these improvements correspond with 
enhanced cerebral metabolic or hemodynamic functioning following surgery.  We will also examine 
the contribution of insulin -glucose metabolism, diabetes and sleep apnea to these effects.   
Aim 1 : Demonstrate improved neural function ( FMRI)  post -surgery compared to obese 
non-surgical controls. H1:  Improved working memory, focused attention and memory recall 
following bariatric surgery will correspond with increased BOLD response in brain regions of 
interest (ROIs). On the [ADDRESS_649893] in 
dorsolateral and medial prefrontal cortex (DLPFC and MFC), and the supplementary motor area 
(SMA). On the CVMT, changes will be greatest in the medial temporal - hippocampal ROIs.  H2. 
Post-surgical changes will persist over [ADDRESS_649894], 
reflecting effects of bariatric surgery on diabetes and metabolic function.   
Aim 2 : Demonstrate that cerebral metabolites (MRS) and perfusion (ASL) improve post -
surgically.  H1:  Cerebral metabolite concentrations will improve in hippocampal and frontal 
ROIs. Decreased choline (Cho) and Myoinositol ( MI) and increased N -acetyl aspartate (NAA) 
will reflect reduced cerebral inflammation (Cho, MI) and neuronal damage (NAA). H2) Regional 
cerebral blood flow (ASL) in these same ROIs will increase post -surgically. H3) Cerebral MRS 
and ASL improvements will be greatest among participants wit h comorbid diabetes, reflecting 
benefits of improved glucose metabolism and diabetes status. H4) Cerebral MRS improvements 
will correspond with reduced concentrations of serum cytokines and other pro -
inflammatory/neurotoxic metabolites.  
Aim 3: Determine whether cerebral metabolite and perfusion effects contribute to 
enhanced post -surgical cognitive performance and brain function on the FMRI tasks.  H1. 
Cerebral MRS and ASL changes will be shown to mediate enhanced post-surgical 
neurocognitive and BOLD response.  H2. MRS, ASL and FMRI neuroimaging, and serum pro -
inflammatory biomarker improvements at 3  months will be predictive of 18 -month change; H3) 
Post-surgical glucose -insulin changes will also be predictive of improved brain function. H4) 
While reductions in glucose/insulin disturbances will contribute in part to improved 
neurocognitive and neural function, weight loss itself, and associated changes in cerebral 
metabolite and perfusion , will be the strongest predi ctors of improvements in these functions.  
Aim 4: We will examine t he influence of sleep apnea assessed by [CONTACT_504788] (PSG)  on obesity -associated brain dysfunction and improvements following 
weight loss . A sleep ap nea severity index will be derived and used as a covariant in the primary 
analyses for Aims 1 -3.

C. Approach:  
 
Using previously established neuroimaging methods , we will collect in vivo  MRI measures from 
participants at the University of [LOCATION_012] McKnight Brain Institute AMRIS facility  during a multimodal 
scanning session in the Phillips 3.0 Tesla scanner , or the UF Health/Shands Si emens 3T MRI 
Scanner,  lasting up to 2 hours , including a short tutorial on the functional task . The primary 
neuroimaging measures are as follows:  
 
• Structural: cortical and sub -cortical volumes (MPRAGE), white matter hyper -intensity             
volumes (FLAIR), measure of white matter integrity (DTI)  
• MRS: choline (Cho), myo-inositol  (MI), N -acetyl aspartate (NAA) and glutamate -glutamine 
(GLX)) obtained from two primary reagents of interest  
• ASL: cerebral blood flow measured from the hippocampus and frontal cortex   
• fMRI - Active cognitive tasks: continuous visual memory test, working memory test, visual 
matching to sample  and others . We will perform FMRI using echo planar BOLD imaging (EPI) 
methods, with data acquired concurrently with ASL  
Data from this assessment will provide information regarding brain structural, 
metabolic/physiological and functional disturbances.   
Neurocognitive function will be examined relative to each neuroimaging modality using statistical 
modeling methods to determine the extent to which they predicts performance in specific cognitive 
domains (learning -memory, attention -executive, motor -process ing speed).   
We will also collect a blood sample  (approx.  2 TBSP)  at the time of the cognitive assessment  or 
MRI visit , which will be stored and analyzed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Leeuwenburgh’s laboratory in the Institute on 
Aging (IOA)  in collaboration with [CONTACT_26021] to examine how cerebral metabolite abnormalities on 
MRS (Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy) correspond with cytokine , ceramide , DNA markers  and 
other metabolic disturbances  common to degenerative disease processes.   
 
6. Research Plan:  
 
A. Participant Cohorts and Recruitment - We will recruit 200  adult participants (men = 100; women = 
100; age: 20-75 years) to obtain and retain an eventual study sample of 180 severely obese adults. 
The sample will include 120 people from the UF Bariatric Surgery Service  undergoing Roux -en-Y 
Gastric By[CONTACT_6476]  (RYGB) or gastric sleeve surgery. We will recruit the non -obese controls from the 
general community.  We will recruit  both the bariatric surgery and obesity control groups so that 
approximately 50% of each will have a medical history and current diagnosis of type -2 diabetes 
based on ADA diagnostic criteria .

a. Potential participants will be pre -screened at the time of their initial contact  [CONTACT_504795] , either over the phone or in a private location  Participants may also be 
contact[CONTACT_504796] a phone screening.  (See Appendix K - Telephone Pre -Screen  
and Appendix JJ.2 – Email to Interested Candidates ).  
b. Potential p articipants identified in person will be asked to complete the WISE Brain Study 
Screening  Informed Consent  in order to begin their participation. This ICF will allow study 
staff to determine eligibility for the study and schedule study -related visits  in coordination 
with the participants’ clinical care . Participants who screen in will be invited back to complete 
the full ICF and complete the remainder of the study activities.  
c. If participant meets all inclusionary guidelines, they will be scheduled for their preferred 
study visit appointment s in coordination with their surgery  (if applicable) . 
d. Participants will be explained the study activities again, and the  Full Informed Consent will 
be reviewed with them in a private location.  Participants will have as much time as needed 
to discuss the information with their friends and family.  They will be given time to consider 
enrollment in the study. They will have many o pportunities to ask questions and get those 
questions answered prior to giving their official consent to participate.  
e. After informed consent is documented , participants will be screened for inclusion/exclusion 
factors, including pregnancy . 
f. Participants may have the MRI Measurement Device ( See Appendix AA.2 in Misc. 
Attachments ) demonstrated for them to visually see the size of the inside of the chamber of 
the MRI Scanner.  Participants may be asked to try the device on themselves to gain a 
greater understanding of the size constraints related to the MRI Scan, and to give them a 
chance to experience the snug fit inside the core of the scanner.  If participants can not fit in 
the measurement device, they will be thanked for their limited participation, and given a $[ADDRESS_649899] to thank them for their time and effort.  
g. Participants will be given a Medical History  evaluation , using the Medical History Form . (See 
Appendix  C)  
h. Participants will be assessed on cognitiv e ability, using the M oCA, CVLT-2, PASAT and 
[LOCATION_011] naming, commonly used in the assessment of MCI and early dementia , and included 
on the IRB list of approved Psychological Measures.  They will also be administered the NIH 
Toolbox Cognitive performance measures listed in Table 1  (See Appendix D for samples)  
This portion will take approximately 3  1/2 hours  and thus a portion may be done at the time 
for their MRI visit .

PI [CONTACT_15261] 1/20/[ADDRESS_649900]  the cognitive session s for quality assurance. These 
recordings are for the examiners to accurately note participant’s responses and score 
assessments. The audio recordings will be securely storage in our study’s secure computer 
system.  Only research assistants and coordinators who have conducted the study visit will  
have access to them. The recordings will be deleted upon their attended use.  
a. A research study staff certified phlebotomist will obtain the blood sample. Approximately 
(2TBSP. or less) of blood will be obtained from each participant and stored for analysis of 
metabolic biomarker panels, inflammatory and neurodegenerative biomarkers and 
cytokines, along with ge nomic analysis. Some of the blood specimens could be sent to 
study collaborators for further analysis. These samples will be coded and will not have any 
PHI associated with them. These collaborators will have signed Confidentiality Agreements 
with UF to secure privacy. Yo u will not get any information b ack regarding these blood tests; 
they are only being done for the purposes of this research . De-identified  blood  samples will 
be sent to Avera in North Dakota for genetic sequencing. Resulting data, along with de -
identified demographic and comorbidity data, will then be sent to Sarah Me dland laboratory 
in Australia , where analyses will be conducted on the genetic sequences to reduce the data 
to DNA coding of genes that have previously been shown to be of rele vance to obesity and 
cognition . Data and samples will only be labelled with the participant’s study ID and blood 
will be discarded as biohazardous waste after analysis.  Genetic s equences derived by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. 
Sarah Me dland in Australia will be entered into a larger database of the ENIGMA obesity 
workgroup . Only de -identified data and sparse demographic and clinical information is 
entered into the database. We will also look at the sugar levels you have in your blood as a 
result of your body’s processing the food that you eat. Blood specimens will be sent to 
Ques t Diagnostics for this test . The specimens will be coded.  
b. Participants may be asked to provide an optional stool sample at baseline , 12-week , and [ADDRESS_649901] them time

Institute  or the UFHealth Shands Si emens 3T scanner - and can be completed at a 
separate visit if preferred.  
 
d. Participants will be  accompanied by [CONTACT_504797] 3T 
Scanner which has a larger bore size, (for larger sized participants) where neuroimaging will 
be performed for approximately one hour. During the scanning session, brain MRI and MRS 
data will be obtained using a series of sequences in a pre -constructed imaging protocol: 1) 
T1 MPRAGE; 2) FLAIR; 3) DTI; 4) MRS -Frontal Voxel; 5) MRS -Hippocampal voxel; 6) ASL; 
7) Resting BOLD. ASL and BOLD sequences will be inte rleaved to reduce the required time.   
 
Participant Retention Plan : 
 In an effort to maximize study retention, le tters and thank you -notes may be sent to a participant’s 
home during follow -up periods or if a participant cannot be reached by [CONTACT_504798]/her next 
visit. Participants will be mailed or emailed  visit confirmations  with directions.  See Appendix JJ.  
 We may also contact [CONTACT_504799]-being  and 
ability to continue participation in order  to maintain contact [CONTACT_504800] -up periods. See Appendix KK.  
 A newsletter discussing study progress and other potential items of interest to the study population  will 
be mailed  quarterly to all enrolled participants. See Appendix LL.  
 We will offer  items stampe d with the study logo that may support the participants in their daily lives, 
particularly post -bariatric surgery , at specific time points throughout the study . See Appendix MM  for gift 
schedule . 
 
G. Compensation:    
 
Screen Fail: 
If a participant arrives for an appointment, but does not pass the screening measures for the MoCA 
(score < 20) or the MRI  (pregnancy, size, or claustrophobia) , they will be given a $[ADDRESS_649903] to thank them for their limited participation.  
 
Participation in study activity:  Participants that complete the cognitive assessment portion of the 
visit will be given a $[ADDRESS_649904] to compensate them for their time and effort.  If they 
participate in the blood draw, they will also receive a $[ADDRESS_649905] to compensate them 
for time and effort . If they participate in the  optional  stool sample, they will receive a $[ADDRESS_649906] for $ [ADDRESS_649907] Surgery.  
 
Travel:  If they have traveled 20 miles or more (one way), they will receive an additional $[ADDRESS_649908] at each visit to compensate them for  additional  gas expense .   
 
H. Data Storage:  There are [ADDRESS_649909] the PHI of participants.  That coded information will be kept in a secure area, with a locked 
door.                                                    
1. MRI scans/images - These images will be stored on password protected computers and 
encrypted 4T storage drives. Any DVD disks or memory sticks with image data will be 
coded, locked in a secure room, and in a locked area.   This data will also be stored on 
secure UF servers associated with the UF HiPerGator system , with all PHI removed.

PI [CONTACT_15261] 1/20/[ADDRESS_649910]. Leeuwenburgh.  
5. Stool -  All stool samples will be de -identified and labeled only with the WISE  Study ID# 
before transfer to the analyses site. There is not a way for offsite collaborators to link the 
samples to the participants. Research staff will then place a preprinted label on the stool 
collection vial with the study ID#.  
 
7. Possible Discomforts and Risks  
 
Participant Burden :  Participants will experience a t least two  study visit s at each time point , BL, [ADDRESS_649911] in the scanner.  Active fMRI tasks will also 
be administered though this will be limited to  approximately  15 minutes. They may also be asked to fill 
out questionnaires at home and bring them to their next visit.  
 
MRI:   During the MRI procedure, participants will be able to talk with the MRI staff through a radio 
intercom speaker system, and, in the event of an emergency, they can tell them to stop the scan  
immediately.  Participants will be asked frequently during the preparation and scanning period whether 
they are experiencing any discomfort , and corrections will be made as necessary.   
Participants may experience discomfort during the scanning process due to limited space inside the bore 
of the magnet. Subjects will be closely monitored and repeatedly checked by [CONTACT_504801].  Participants may also become uncomfortable  from lying still for an extended period of time, or  if 
they do not like to be in close spaces (have "claustrophobia").  Padding with blankets can be used to 
prevent discomfort while lying in the magnet.  
The MRI scanner produces a loud “hammering” noise, which has been reported to produce temporary 
hearing  loss in a very small number of  people . Participants will be provided with  earplugs to wear in the 
scanner, and also headphones to reduce this risk  and possible discomfort . 
 
Blood Draw:   The risks of drawing blood from a vein include discomfort at the site of puncture; possible 
bruising and swelling around the puncture site; rarely an infection; and, uncommonly, faintness from the 
procedure. These risks will be minimized by [CONTACT_504802].    
 
Stool Sample : The process of collecting a stool specimen, while potentially messy, has no risk beyond 
normal bathroom activity. Participants will be provided with the stool collection kit and protective 
material (gloves, etc) at no cost to them. Our research team will provide instructions regarding the 
process. Persons can either bring the sample form home, or they can provide it d uring the day of their 
study visits (using a bathroom at the research facilities).  A demonstration kit will be available during the 
study visit to show the components  and staff  will also instruct participants on how to properly seal the 
bio bag to prevent contamination during transportation. Participants may elect to collect the sample at 
home to reduce embarrassment.  
Computer based tests:  There is a risk that participants will find memory and concentration tests to be 
difficult, or frustrating, because it is a new task that they are not familiar with, and may be challenging to 
 
15 
Protocol 201400034  
PI [CONTACT_15261] 1/20/2022  their thinking and memory. Participants may skip any question they do not wish to answer. Research 
staff will explain what to do and help them do the tasks during their research visit.  
 
PHI:  Researchers will take appropriate steps to protect any information they collect about study 
participants.  However, there is a slight risk that information about them could be revealed 
inappropriately or accidentally.  Depending on the nature of the information, such a release could upset 
or embarrass participants, or possibly affect their insurability or employability. These risks will be 
minimized by [CONTACT_504803]; only authorized personnel will have access to the study documents and files.   
 
COVID -19: Upon arriving at the lab space, researchers will use one of several touchless thermometers 
to take their temperature. If their temperature is 100.[ADDRESS_649912] 
immediately and inform the PI.  Researchers are required to wear surgical masks and gloves , both of 
which are available within the lab space.  Before beginning a participant visit, researchers will use soap 
and water to clean any frequently used surfaces, such as door handles  and tables. These surfaces will 
then be sanitized with Clorox wipes; items that can’t  first be cleaned with soap and water, such as 
electronics, will only be wiped down with Clorox wipes.  
 
Researchers will greet participants outside the building and ask a series of screening questions to 
determine if the participant currently has any symptoms indicative of COVID -19, has recently traveled 
to an area with known local spread of COVID -19, or has  come into close contact [CONTACT_504804] a 
laboratory -confirmed COVID -19 diagnosis.  If the answer is yes to any of these questions, the 
participant will not be allowed to complete their visit until they are tested for the virus. If the participant 
did tr avel to a known area of COVID -19, but it was more than 14 days prior to participant examination 
and the participant is symptom free, the examination will be allowed . Researchers will also measure the 
participant’s temperature using the touchless thermometer. If the participants’ temperature is 100.[ADDRESS_649913] bins.  
 
Participants and study staff are required to wear a mask at the UF Health Shands MRI Suite. 
Researchers will maintain a 6 -foot distance between themselves and participants at all times. Study 
materials, including laptop, laptop bag, joystick for task, etc. , will be cleaned with Clorox wipes before 
and after each participant. Masks will also be required within the MRI scanner; the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_504759].  
 
 
8. Possible Benefits:  
 
There are no direct benefits to subjects from participating in this study. Results from this study may 
benefit future researchers and physicians with the diagnosis and prevention of cognitive decline and 
other brain pathologies  related to diabetes .  
 
9. Conflicts of Interest : 
 
There are no conflicts of interes t.

Rationale and 
back g round:  The treatment of COPD increasingly involves multiple therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including long -
acting bronchodilators (LAMAs and LABAs) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), 
with combinations of these drugs now formulated into single inhalers. The use of 
ICS has increased disproportionately with respect to COPD treatment guidelines 
and may be appropriate only  in a subset of these users [ P15-[ZIP_CODE]; P16-[ZIP_CODE] ]. 
New evidence suggests that patients can be safely weaned off ICS, including the 
WISDOM trial that observed no difference in the risk of moderate o r severe 
ex acerbations between patients who discontinued ICS and those who continued 
receiving ICS [ P14-[ZIP_CODE] ]. Moreover, discontinuation of ICS has been associated 
with a reduction in the risk of pneumonia [ P15-[ZIP_CODE] ]. The recent FLAME 
randomized trial reported that patients receiving the LABA/LAMA combination 
had fewer ex acerbations than those receiving the LABA/ICS combination over a 
one-year follow -up period.  The ENERG ITO study showed significant  
improvements in lung function with the LAMA/LABA FDC Tio+Olo versus 
LABA/ICS. Although, a recent population -based observational study showed no 
difference in ex acerbation risk for COPD patients with B -Eosinophils below 4% if 
treated either with LAMA or LA BA/ICS [ P18-[ZIP_CODE] ], this data have yet to be 
confirmed in population based studies in real world conditions. G iven high -cost 
adverse events associated with long -term use of ICS and inconsistent evidence 
concerning whether there  is a clinically relevant benefit of ICS combination 
therapy in terms of disease control, it is important to assess differences between 
subsets of COPD patients in terms of the effectiveness and cost of LABA/ICS 
combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_642851] -ICS o ptions, such as 
Tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_1890]+Olodaterol (Tio+Olo).  
The proposed study will investigate the comparative effectiveness of Tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_642852] (Tio+Olo) vs any LABA /ICS combination in COPD, describe 
differences in healthcare utilization, and compare cost  effectiveness. Whether 
associations with time to ex acerbation, community acquired pneumonia, 
escalation to triple therapy, and adverse outcome are modified by [CONTACT_642865] (measured based on individual history and eosinophil levels) will also be 
assessed.   
The intended audience is the scientific community, patients, payers and 
prescribers.  The results from the study will be published in the scientific 
literature.

Research question and 
objectiv es:  The primary objective is t o compare the effectiveness of maintenance therapy 
initiation with the combination treatment Tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_140395] 
(Olo+Tio) compared with LABA/ICS combination in COPD as the time to the 
first COPD exacerbation.  
Secondary objectives are to compare patients treated with  Tio+Olo and 
patients treated with LABA/ ICS combination: (1) Time to community 
acquired pneumonia, (2) time to escalation to triple therapy (3) time to an 
adverse outcome  including exacerbation, escalation  to triple therapy, or 
pneumonia , and (4) healthcare utilization outcomes and an analysis of all-
cause and COPD -specific cost overall and by [CONTACT_140421].  
Additionally , the study will  investigate the eff ect modification of circulating 
eosinophil levels and exacerbation history on the saf ety and effectiveness of 
Tio+Olo compared with any LABA/ICS. Analyses will be repeated in sub-
groups of patients under high  or low risk of exacerbation based on previous 
history of exacerbations in the year preceding cohort entry ( with exacerbation 
history  defined as either 1+ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26109] 2+  exacerbations  in emergency 
department or outpatients settings [R05-1384]),  as well  as based on circulating 
eosinophils (cut -off: B- Eos 300cells /uL [P18-[ZIP_CODE] ]) overall and among 
those without a history of exacerbation.  
S tudy des ig n:  A incident new-user cohort design will be used, with confounding controlled 
via fine stratification and reweighting of time-conditional propensity scores

Population:  The cohort will include all patients with a diagnosis of COPD who received 
at least one dispensing of  a long- acting bronchodilator, Tio+Olo, LABA  or 
for an inhaled corticosteroid from 1 January 2013 until 31 March 2019 (or the 
most recent date available at  the time of cohort extraction) . Only fixed-dose 
combinations products will be included in the main analyses.  To increase the 
likelihood of a diagnosis of COPD, we only include patients 40 years of age 
or older at initiation of study treatment (i.e.,  the index date ) and exclude all 
patients with a diagnosis of asthma  within the baseline year or lung cancer, 
interstitial lung disease, or lung transplantation at any time prior to the index 
date.  
Patient s will need to have at least one year of medical and pha rmacy health 
plan eligibility  prior to the date of Tio+Olo or LABA/ICS  initiation ( index 
date) to allow the identification of new use  and the measurement of baseline 
covariates . Patients w ill be followed until switching to the other treatment , 
the end of the individual’s health plan eligibility, escalation of therapy, 
discontinuation of COPD treatment, or the end of the study period, whichever 
occurs first.  Main analyses will be limited to the first year following the index 
date.  
Additional rest riction to individuals who have laboratory test result data 
showing eosinophil levels will occur for relevant sensitivity analyses.

6. RATIONALE AND BACKGROUND
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality 
throughout the world [P07-[ZIP_CODE] ]. It has recently risen to become the third leading cause of 
death in the US  [R13-1383 ]. Long-acting bronchodilator medications, that include long-
acting beta2 -agonists (LABAs) and the long-actin g muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) such as 
the anticholinergic tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_1890], have become central maintenance therapy to the management 
of COPD , with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) added with increasing severity [P07-[ZIP_CODE]].   
The treatment
 of COPD increasingly involves multiple therapi[INVESTIGATOR_381022]-acting 
bronchodilators (LAMAs and LABAs) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) with combinations of these drugs now formulated into single inhalers. Optimal treatment choice appears to be 
influenced by a variety of factors including exacerbation risk. Although the use of ICS has 
increased disproportionately with respect to COPD treatment guidelines, it may be 
appropriate only in a subset of these users [ P15-[ZIP_CODE]; P16-[ZIP_CODE]
]. For example, the recent 
FLAME randomized trial reported that patients receiving the LABA/LAMA combination had 
fewer exacerbations than those receiving the LABA/ICS combination over a one -year follow -

Boehr inger  Ingelh eim   Page 12 of 53

BI Study  Number  1237- 0093  c31403012-01  
Proprietary conf idential inf ormation © [ADDRESS_860445] -01 (4.0) up period. In the WISDOM trial, in patients on triple therapy the risk of moderate or severe 
exacerbations was similar among those who discontinued and those who continued ICS. The ENERGITO study showed significant improvements in lung function with the LAMA/LABA FDC Tio+Olo versus LABA/ICS. Further, pneumonia associated with long-term ICS use 
increases the risk of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], and is associated with substantial increases in cost  [
P07-
[ZIP_CODE] ; R18-2874 ]. 
Although, a rec
ent population- based observational study showed no difference in 
exacerbation risk for COPD patients with B -Eosinophils below 300 cells/uL) if treated either 
with LAMA or LABA/ICS [P18-[ZIP_CODE] ], this data have yet to be confirmed in population 
based studies in real world conditions.  Given high-cost adverse events associated with long-
term use of ICS and inconsistent evidence concerning whether there is a clinically relevant 
benefit of IC S combination therapy in terms of disease control, it is important to assess 
differences between subsets of COPD patients in terms of the effectiveness and cost of 
LABA/ICS combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_642851]-ICS options, such as Tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_1890]+Olodaterol ( Tio+Olo).  
The proposed study 
will investigate the comparative effectiveness of Ti o+Olo  vs any LABA 
/ICS combination in COPD, describe differences in healthcare utilization, and compare cost effectiveness. Whether associations with time to exacerbation, community acquired 
pneumonia, escalation to triple therapy, and adverse outcome  are modif ied by [CONTACT_642866] (measured based on individual history and eosinophil l evels) will also be assessed.  
7. RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND OBJECTIVES
The goal of this study is to investigate the risk of COPD exacerbations, community acquired pneumonia, and health care utilization in patients treated with Tio+Olo in comparison to 
patients treated with LABA/ICS combination therapy. All analyses will be co nducted for the 
total population, as well as in sub-groups of patients under high- or low risk of exacerbation 
based on (1) previous history of exacerbations in the year pr eceding cohort entry (cut -off: 0-1 
vs 2+ exacerbations  [R05-1384
], (2) circulating eosinophils (cut -off B-Eos 300 cells/uL 
[P18-[ZIP_CODE]]), and (3) as an exploratory analysis, a combination of exacerbation history and circulating eosinophils.  
Primary objectiv
e:  
The primary objective is to compare the effectiveness of new use of maintenance therapy 
initiation with the combination treatment Tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_140395] ( Tio+Olo ) compared 
with new use of LABA /ICS combination in COPD as the time to the first COPD 
exacerbation.  
Secondary object
ives:  
Secondary objectives are to  compare patients treated with Tio+Olo and patients treated with 
LABA/ICS combination therapy with respect to: Time to first community acquired pneumonia,  
Time to escalation to triple therapy,  and

date.  
Outpatient la
boratory data is available for a subset of patients. Some analyses will be further 
restricted to the subset of the population with at least one laboratory result showing 
circulating eosinophil levels within six months before  the index date . 
Individuals  in the 
study cohort  will be followed from the index date  until the earliest of the 
date of a switch in trea tment,  addition of either an ICS for the Tio+Olo  group or of LAMA to 
the LABA /ICS group, discontinuation of COPD treatment, the end of the study period, or the 
end of continuous health plan eligibilit y . Main analyses will be further limited to the first year 
after cohort entry, with sensitivity analyses considering all available data.  
8.4 VARIABLES  
8.4.1 Expos
ures  
The exposure  measures are based on pharmacy dispensings  of the t wo long-acting 
bronchodilator s under study, namely fixed -dose combination of Tio+Olo and a fixed -dose 
combination of LABA  and ICS, over one year of follow -up. As described in the data analysis 
section, the as -treated analysis , which is the main analysis,  will consider exposure as current 
use of Tio+Olo or LABA /ICS within the treate d groups  defined as within the days supply 
recorded at the time of pharmacy dispensing, allowing for a gap between dispensings of up to [ADDRESS_860449] adherence, and will be varied in sensitivity analyses (see Section 8.9.2
). The 
treatment segment ends at the earliest of the following events:  
1.Fifteen d ays after the end of the observed days supply for the medication
received on the index date without a subsequent dispensing of COPD medication (i.e., discontinuation)  
2.Initiation of triple therapy (i.e., addition of ICS to Tio+Olo or a LAMA toLABA/ICS (i.e ., treatment escalation)  
3.Any other change in use of study medication by [CONTACT_140423] , inclusive of
a change to a different combination therapy, change from a fixed form to a 
free form combination therapy, or a change from combination therapy to 
monotherapy (i.e., switch)  
Changes in dose for medications started on the index date will not impact the end of the treatment segment. Codes used to identify study medications are included in Annex 3.1.
 
8.4.2 Outcome (s) 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary outcome(s)  
The primary outcome event for effectiveness is time to first COPD exacerbation after cohort 
entry. The event is defined as follows:  
•Severe exacerbation:

Protocol for observati onal studies based on existing data  
BI Study  Number  1237- 0093  c31403012-01  
Proprietary conf idential inf ormation © [ADDRESS_860450] -01 (4.0) oHospi[INVESTIGATOR_18506] a principal discharge diagnosis of COPD.
•Moderate exacerbation:
oAn ED visit with a discharge diagnosis of COPD , and/or
oAn antibiotic for a respi[INVESTIGATOR_642853] a s an oral 
corticosteroid
Time to the first COPD exacerbation will be measured from cohort entry until the occurrence 
of a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_140398] (severe exacerbation) or ED visit for COPD or prescription of 
an antibiotic and an oral corticosteroid on the same day (moderate exacerbation). Severe and 
moderate exacerbations will be considered as a composite for main analyses. Sensitivity analys es will stratify by [CONTACT_642867].   
Although there is precedent for defining moderate exacerbation based on use of antibiotics 
for a respi[INVESTIGATOR_642854], we have chosen 
a more restrictive definit ion of exacerbation. Because diagnoses listed on outpatient claims 
often correspond to a patient’s past medical history in addition to acute problems, we expect limited ability to capture the indication for which antibiotics are prescribed. As such, 
includ ing antibiotics alone as a case definition for exacerbation would introduce potentially 
substantial misclassification of outcome where antibiotics were truly given for non-
respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073]. Given that our analyses will yield estimates on a ratio meas ure, non-
differentially reduced sensitivity is a less important threat to validity than reduction of 
outcome specificity, which produces an expectation of bias towards the null hypothesis. In 
order to test our assumptions that the sensitivity of our outcom e definition is not differential 
between the Tio+Olo and LABA/ICS groups, we would produce counts of patients with antibiotics alone during follow -up, and determine whether the proportion of potential 
exacerbations that we excluded through this design deci sion is comparable across groups.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary outcome(s)  
The first  secondary outcome is time to  first hospi[INVESTIGATOR_140400]-acquired 
pneumonia (serious pneumonia). Pneumoni a will be defined using ICD-9-CM diagnoses 
481.x-486.x; 487.0, 507.x, 507.0, 507.1, 507.8, 510.0, 510.9, 511.0, 513.0, 514.x, 517.1, 519.8, 530.84, and ICD-10 diagnosis codes  J10.0; J11.0; J12-J18; J22; J69; J85.0; J85.1; J86. 
This definition has  been used successfully in COPD  [P07-[ZIP_CODE]; P16-[ZIP_CODE]
].  
The second sec
ondary outcome is time to a pharmacy dispensing indicating escalation to 
triple therapy, (i.e., addition of ICS to Tio+Olo or a LAMA to LABA/ICS).  
The third secondary 
outcome is time to an adverse outcome including exacerbation, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_642855], and escalation to triple therapy, defined as time from cohort 
entry until the earliest primary or secondary outcome  as defined above (See Section [IP_ADDRESS] , 
[IP_ADDRESS] ).

We will identify and describe the following demographic characteristics as of the index date:  
•Sex
•Age (years , as both a categorical and a continuous variable )
•Calendar year  of cohort entry
•Season of index date (winter, spring, summer, fall)
•US census region of residence

•Number of  previous COPD treatment s
•Specific previous COPD treatments
oLAMA monotherapy
oLABA monotherapy
oICS monotherapy
oLAMA/ICS combination therapy
•Previous acute COPD exacerbation  (measured both overall and in the 30 days prior to

Chronic comorbidities will be defined using diagnoses identified during all available data prior to the index date, and will include:  
• Cardiovascular disease 
• Charlson comorbidity index  
• Diabetes  
• Thyroid disease  
• Renal failur e 
• Autoimmune disease  
• Pneumonia  
• Obesity* 
• Alcohol use disorder * 
• Tobacco use or cessation counselling * 
• Cancer (excluding basal cell carcinoma)  
 *We anticipate limited capture of l ifestyle variables  known to be risk factors and potential 
confounders, including obesity, smoking status and exce ssive alcohol consumption. Although 
we will describe them as identified in the HIRD, bias analyses to examine the extent to which residual confounding may impact results are also planned.  
Additionally to the covariates defined above, we will use the high-dimensional approach to identify variables entering a time -conditional propensity score.  
 Sub-populations with high or low risk of exacerbations will be defined as based on circulating eosinophils ( cut-off of  B-Eos 300 cells/uL) as identified based on the  laboratory 
result value that is closest but prior to the index date  (within 6 months) . Additional  
stratification will include previous history of exacerbations in the year preceding cohort entry 
(with exacerbation history defined as either 1+ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26109] 2+ exacerbations in 
emergency department or outpatients settings), and among those without a history of exacerbation at baseline, based on  circulating eosinophil results  as noted above . We will not 
present results stratified by [CONTACT_642870] (see Section 8.7
).

10 (ICD -10) since October, 2015. Laboratory result data are additionally available for those 
tests that have been performed using two large, national reference laboratories (Quest and LabCorp) [R14-4278
]. The database has been used for the study of numerous diseases, 
including studies of COPD [ R19-2324; R19-2321; R19-2323; R19-2322;  P15-[ZIP_CODE]; P14-

estimates that are impacted by [CONTACT_140429]. This is of particular importance in the 
case of lifestyle factors that are less critical to insurance billing and thus poorly captured in claims data. Quantitative bias analyses can form ally describe the extent to which these issues 
are present, but bias analysis parameters are informed by [CONTACT_642872][INVESTIGATOR_1649]. As such, the accuracy of bias corrected analyses is limited by [CONTACT_642873] . 
 
Second, there is the possibility of information bias due to misclassification of the outcomes or 
exposure or missing data, especially, differential missingness of some data (e.g. eosinophils, which may only be measured in sicker patients). The prescript ions dispensed by a pharmacy 
but not taken by [CONTACT_140432]. Pharmacy dispensing 
data does bring us one step closer to patient use than physician prescribing given that the 
patient has taken the effort to obtain the m edication as instructed, however, information such 
as indication can only be inferred based on diagnostic patterns .

exacerbation (hazard ratio 0.85) with over 90% power. As such, overall analyses are expected 
to have adequate power. Analyses that are stratified based on the presence of claims -based

be more limited. Given low expected sample size, stratification by [CONTACT_642874].  
8.[ADDRESS_860459] udy will be conducted using SAS version 9.4 or higher  (SAS 
Institute, Cary, NC). All sensitive data pertaining to the study will be stored on secured 
servers with access only permitted by [CONTACT_642875] . 
 A number of Information Security policies are enforced, audited, and in place at HealthCore, including complex password requirements and encryption systems. Security mechanisms and 
policies are in place HealthCore's facilities are standard corpor ate office space. Office space 
is segregated and managed by [CONTACT_140435]. HealthCore areas which contain 
project and study-related documents are only access by [CONTACT_642876]. All non-HealthCore associates must be accompanied by [CONTACT_140437]. All study related files are kept in locked cabinets and work areas. 
There are no visible labels or client listings viewable by [CONTACT_140438]. All passwords and user authent ication mechanisms are forced changed at regular intervals and 
there is automatic locking of workstations after a short period of time (< 15 minutes).  
 Data Center space is permitted on an as required basis and monitored by [CONTACT_140439]. HealthCore maintains a cumulative record that indicates, for any point in time, the names of 
authorized personnel, their titles, and a description of their access privileges to the Data

 networks have been designed to separate patient or physician identified data from de -
identified or masked data. Network security, firewalls, and password permissions control 
which HealthCore personnel have access to patient or physician identifiers . Unless the study 
protocol calls for patient or physician authorization or a waiver of authorization as granted by 
[CONTACT_2717], no research analyst will have access to patient or physician identifiers within 
HealthCore’s computer systems. All research analysis  databases have been de-identified. 
HealthCore’s Data Center is also physically secured by a controlled access facility, with only authorized personnel having access to network servers, tape libraries and other media that 
contains patient identifiers.  
 
Research analysis files used by [CONTACT_642877]; if such is the case, access will be made after 
receipt of the patient’s or physician’s authorization or IRB waiver of such authorization has 
been granted. It is also HealthCore policy to provide for secure storage of study materials, including data, reports, and other files after the study is completed, with a destroy date assigned based on study requirements. HealthCore reviews  data requirements for each study 
to assure that only the minimum of patient or physician information is obtained to answer the research question(s). For those studies where direct patient identifiers are needed for additional data collection such as medic al chart abstracts, access to information will be 
limited to the greatest possible extent within the research team. Both structural and 
contractual safeguards reinforce policies to minimize the risk of breaching patient or 
physician privacy. The structural  safeguards include a clearly defined data flow process. This 
process minimizes the risk of individual identifiers being improperly used or disclosed. The contractual safeguards include contractual binding to confidentiality of individuals involved 
in the research.  
8.9 DATA ANALYSIS  
8.9.1 Main analysis  
All analyses will be presented for each group (Tio+Olo vs LABA/LAMA/ICS) overall and stratified as follows: 
• History of exacerbation: 0 inpatient and 0-1 outpatient events  
• History of exacerbation: 1+ inpatient or 2+ outpatient events  
• Circulating eosinophils: B -Eos <300 cells/µL  
• Circulating eosinophils: B -Eos 300 cells/µL +  
• History of exacerbation: 0 inpatient and 0-1 outpatient events & circulating eosinophils: B -Eos <300 cells/u L  
• History of exacerbation: 0 inpatient and 0-1 outpatient events & circulating 
eosinophils: B -Eos 300 cells/u L+  
 
We will first describe formation of the study cohort. P atient characteristics at baseline in 
patients treated with Tio+Olo and patients treated with LABA /ICS will be described 
separately using standard descriptive statistics . Because eosinophil levels may vary based on 
exacerbation, we will also provide a count and percentage of the number of individuals whose eosinophil results were recorded within 30 days of an exacerbation event.  
Boehr inger  Ingelh eim   Page 21 of 53

Proprietary conf idential inf ormation © [ADDRESS_860461] -01 (4.0) 
  
High-dimensional propensity scores including both pre -specified and data -derived variables 
will then be calculated. We will use fine stratification and reweighting of the exposure propensity score to control for measured covariates  [R19-3030
]. Balance of patient 
characteristics between the cohorts will be described before and after propensity score application and compared using standardized differences (in the crude population and the reweighted pseudo-population). S tandardized differences greater than 0.10 (10%) will be 
taken to indicate imbalance and further refinement approaches will be applied.  
 For the analysis of the primary objective , a Cox proportional hazard regression model will be 
used to perform an as -treated analys is that assesses the effect of current use of Tio+Olo  
combination versus the LABA /ICS combination on the risk of a first COPD exacerbation . It 
will provide an estimate of the hazard ratio ( HR) of a COPD exacerbation  associated with 
Tio+Olo use relative to LABA /ICS use , along with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Current 
use will be defined based on the days supply during the period of overlap, allowing a grace period of [ADDRESS_860462] modification by B -Eosinophils and/or 
exacerbation history will be studied by [CONTACT_642878] s in stratum -specific estimates.  
 
The analysis of the secondary objective s related to the risk of pneumonia , treatment 
escalation, and an adverse outcome  will use a Cox proportional hazard regression model with 
an as -treated  approach, similar to that of the primary analysis.   
 In terms of healthcare utilization, we will present continuous and categorical variables using 
standard descriptive statistics to describe  total visits and total costs related to inpatient, 
outpatient, office visit, and emergency ca re as well as total pharmacy dispensings,  distinct 
medications used, and pharmacy costs. Utilization and costs will be stratified to facilitate comparison between Tio+Olo and LABA/ICS, and presented by [CONTACT_642879] a 
composite. All -cause and C OPD-specific data will be shown.

 8.10 QUAL
ITY CONTROL  
HealthCore operates observational research studies with the goal that the services provided to 
our clients are of high quality. To support this imperative we believe it is critic al 1) to have 
dedicated training and quality resources and 2) that all talking points and major processes to be implemented with the study be approved by [CONTACT_642880].  
 HealthCore’s quality control program is centralized within the Regulatory Compliance Office. The Regulatory Compliance Office Manager is responsible for quality control and reports directly to the Vice President of Operations of HealthCore on all quality matters. 
HealthCore’s quality system is organized around the Quality Manual, the quality checks 
within the project life cycle, and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). HealthCore has procedures for retention of protected health information (PHI) and project data. The study 
will be tracked at various levels to help ensure that all aspects including project delivery, 
infrastructure, quality processes, resource management, and financial issues are addressed. To help ensure the highest level of quality on every project, HealthCore has established several layers of quality assurance throughout the project lifecycle.  
 
Role Based Control Checks: Each member of the team is responsible to perform thorough 
quality control checks on their work. In addition, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_642857].  
 
Quality Check Points: Centralized “checkpoints” have been implemented during the data 
management cycle to help ensure accurate translation of programming requests.  
 Quality Assurance Standards: Standard review procedures have been developed and are 
applied throughout the project lifecycle.  
 Automation: HealthCore has developed standard definitions of many variables and disease states and developed programs to apply these standards as needed on projects. These 
standards help ensure consistency, repeatability and accuracy for each project.

 and may produce estimates that are impacted by [CONTACT_140429]. This is of particular 
importance in the case of lifestyle factors that are less  critical to insurance billing and thus 
poorly captured in claims data. Quantitative bias analyses can formally describe the extent to which these issues are present, but bias analysis parameters are informed by [CONTACT_140444][INVESTIGATOR_1649]. As s uch, the accuracy of bias corrected analyses is limited by [CONTACT_642881].

8.12 OTHER ASPECTS  
None  
9. PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 
HealthCore maintains Data Sharing Agreements (DSAs)  and Business Associate Agreements 
with covered entities  that provide protected health information (PHI)  incorporated into the 
HealthCore Integrated Research Database (HIRD). HealthCore’ s access, use, and disclosure 
of PHI are in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
(HIPAA)  Privacy Rule [45 CFR Part 160 and Subparts A and E of Part 164]. HealthCore 
does not access, use, or disclose PHI  other than as permitted by [CONTACT_140446] . When using PHI for research, this typi[INVESTIGATOR_642858], or when that is not feasible we may obtain a specific 
waiver of the HIPAA authorization requir ements from an Institutional Review Board (IRB). 
HealthCore also takes into consideration other federal and state laws and regulations that 
might limit use of certain types of data more than HIPAA, including those laws related to 
identifiable records relat ed to substance abuse and human immunodeficiency virus.  
The current study is designed as an analysis based on medical and pharmacy claims data from a large insured population in the [LOCATION_002] (US). There  is no active enrollment or active 
follow -up of study subjects, and no data will be collected directly from individuals.  
At no time during the conduct of this study will HealthCore provide patient or provider identifying information to Boehringer Ingelheim  All data and/or results will be in an 
aggregate d and de -identified format. Data variables with values ≤10 will be reported only as 
“≤10.” Boehringer Ingelheim  will not attempt to re -identify any r esults provided for the 
study.

 10. MANAGEMENT AND REPORTING OF ADVERSE 
EVENTS/ADVERSE REACT IONS 
Data is anonymized and extracted, analyzed, validated and reported in aggregate.  
There is no potential that any employee of BI or agent working on behalf of BI will access 
individual patient data in which the patient may be identified during data compi[INVESTIGATOR_642859], data 
reporting or data analysis.  
 Based on current guidelines from the International Society for Pharmacoepi[INVESTIGATOR_623] [ R11
 
4318] and the EMA [ R13-1970 ], non-interventi onal studies such as the one described in this 
protocol, conducted using health care records, do not require expedited reporting of suspected adverse events/reactions. Specifically, as stated in section VI.C.1.2.1 of Guideline on Good Pharmacovigilance Practices (GVP), Module VI – Management and Reporting of Adverse 
Reactions to Medicinal Products, for non-interventional study designs, which are based on 
use of secondary data, reporting of adverse reactions is not required.  
 
11. PLANS FOR DISSEMINATING AND COMMUNICATING 
STUDY RESULTS 
We plan to publish the study in a peer -reviewed medical journal.  
Authorship and publication will follow the corresponding BI SOP 001-MCS -00-002 and 
guidelines  of good scientific practice.

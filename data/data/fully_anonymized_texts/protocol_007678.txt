Section C:  Background Information
     Reduction mammoplasty is a procedure in which a volumetric reduction of the breast is done for cosmetic purposes. This
technique includes an infra-mammary perpendicular incision joined by a T-inframammary fold in it; central area, that further
continue vertically until surrounding the nipple perimeter .
The likelihood of poor healing outcomes and adverse events (e.g., wound dehiscence, thick scar , itchy or unsortable scars)
at the T-inframammary fold (anchor incision) of the breast wound incision is relatively high (estimated to be 10%-15%). This
pure outcome is attributed to the corner (as a result of the T-inframammary fold) low blood supply . Given the fact that there
are two corners in this particular procedure, the chances of adverse events are higher due to the point of most tension for
the entire breast. Continuous oxygen therapy may reduce the likelihood of poor outcomes and adverse events.
In our institution, the Plastic Surgery Department utilizes Dermabond glue (sano acrylic) and Prineotape (air and water
sealed) to close the wound around the areola and over the T-inframammary fold. Depending on the incision size, a JP  drain
could be placed (10% of the cases). Furthermore, the Prineo tape is kept on for a period of [ADDRESS_1111385]-operative week. Then, the Prineo tape has to be removed before the expected time period. Therefore, an
external dressing might be able to avoid wound dehiscence during this period.
Continuous Dif fusion of Oxygen (CDO) is a treatment modality that delivers pure oxygen to wounds using the same basic
mechanism as breathing, namely direct dif fusion into the wound from a moist surface. Because impaired blood flow results
in impaired oxygen supply to incisional wounds, investigators have researched the potential of oxygen saturation, or
supersaturation, to reinitiate or even accelerate wound healing. Oxygen has been shown to result in not only faster wound
closure, yet also better strength of repair and higher organization of collagen, which in turn can result in lower wound
recidivism and better scar appearance.
In this feasibility and proof of concept study , we plan to investigate the ef fects of oxygen on incisional wound repair and
scarring after mammoplasty . We will use a device (OxyGeni Oxygen Delivery System ) which continuously supplies oxygen
to the wound inside the wound dressing. The device we used, the OxyGeni System, (EO2 Concepts®, San Antonio, TX) is
small, wearable and silent. The system is FDA-approved and CDO therapy has been the subject of a growing body of
clinical experience and scientific investigations demonstrating good results. The therapy is similar in theory to the
intermittent application of oxygen through Hyperbaric Oxygen (HBO) and Topi[INVESTIGATOR_805038] (T O), with a few key dif ferences
summarizing in the following:
1) CDO provides continuous therapy , providing ~twenty-fold longer time of oxygen delivery versus intermittent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_805039] 90 minutes a day . 2) CDO allows for full patient mobility during treatment, thereby [CONTACT_805051]-compliance and reducing overall costs
We have successfully used CDO therapy to reduce likelihood of tissue necrosis after surgical closure post lower extremity
amputation as well as post anterior neck surgery , in which over [ADDRESS_1111386]-surgical closure by
[CONTACT_805052]. W e will examine the validity of this hypothesis
using a pi[INVESTIGATOR_805040] a convenient sample of 30 women undergoing bilateral mammoplasty .
 
Section D:  Purpose and Objectives
     This is an exploratory randomized controlled trial study to test feasibility , acceptability , and proof of concept ef ficacy of
Continuous Dif fusion of Oxygen (CDO) adjunct therapy for decreasing healing time and reducing tissue dehiscence post
breast reconstruction. W e will assess the benefit of this novel adjunct therapy on successful closure, tissue oxygenation,
scar appearance, and patients centered outcomes including perception of benefit, pain, sleep quality , and quality of life.
Since all procedures are bilateral, an internal randomization will be performed based on breast side (left or right). The
patients will be given CDO in one breast defined as intervention breast. A 5x5 cm CDO dressing will be placed by [CONTACT_805053] T-inframammary fold after the Dermabond glue and Prineo tape are placed. Then, Silagen (a
silicon sheet) will be placed on top of the CDO dressing to secure it in place. The remaining parts of the incision will be
covered with Dermabond Glue and Prineo tape. On the contrary , the control breast will be given the standard dressing
(Dermabond + Prineo tape). The study device OxyGeni is a Class II medical device which has US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance, CE-Mark approval and a Health Canada license for the treatment of wounds.
Outcomes will be assessed on weekly-basis up to 4 weeks. Here are the aims and hypotheses for this study:
Aim1: To assess ef fectiveness of CDO adjunct therapy in reducing the likelihood of wound complication post-surgical7/5/24, 12:09 PM Human Protocol Report
https://brain.bcm.edu/esp1/reports/Human/Protocol.asp?protocol=477460 3/14
closure.
H1: CDO adjunct therapy will reduce the likelihood of surgical wound complication including dehiscence and its volume,
infection or surgical revision, compare to standard of care dressing.
Aim2: To assess changes in skin perfusion in patients treated with CDO adjunct therapy .
H2: CDO adjunct therapy will improve tissue oxygen saturation in >50% of the patients as compared to baseline
(measurements at baseline, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks).
Aim3: To evaluate changes in quality of life, anxiety during dressing change, and psychosocial parameters in patients with
a surgical wound treated by [CONTACT_805054]
H3: CDO adjunct therapy will improve subject quality of life, reduce anxiety , and reduce perceived pain and physiological
stress response during dressing change compared to the control group.
Aim4: To assess feasibility , acceptability , user-friendliness, perception of benefit, and improved scar cosmetic appearance
H4: CDO adjunct therapy will be considered to be practical to use, easy to use, and is perceived to be beneficial from both
practitioner and subject as assessed by [CONTACT_805055] (assessment
at the conclusion of the study). This questionnaire is attached to the protocol.
H5. CDO adjunct therapy will improve scar cosmetic appearance as assessed by [CONTACT_805056] (SCAR) Scale.

infection; subject has a history of or any intercurrent illnesses or conditions that would compromise the safety of the subject
according to judgement of a qualified wound specialist.
F2.  Procedure
     Please note that subjects will be consented before performing any study related measurements. This study will not bring
any direct costs to the subject. The subject's medical insurance will be billed for all standard of care procedures.
Eligible subjects will be internally randomized and will receive the intervention for [ADDRESS_1111395] Continuous Dif fusion of Oxygen (CDO) therapy
using a novel dressing, which facilitates continuous supply of oxygen to the wound inside the wound dressing using a
portable device named OxyGeni . W e will collect patient demographics (e.g., age, sex, height, weight, race, ethnicity ,
marital status, level of education, etc), relevant medical history (e.g., comorbidity , type of surgery , number of prescription
and over counter medication, etc), and relevant social factors (e.g., marital status, years of education, type of work,
tobacco history , etc) at baseline. Primary outcomes include tissue oxygenation (assessed using Kent Imaging system) and
incidence of wound complications (e.g. dehiscence, infection, and surgical revision). Primary outcomes will be assessed at
baseline and on a weekly basis for up to 4 weeks. Secondary and exploratory outcomes include inflammation (assessed
using a KENT  camera), pain (assessed visual analog scale). The secondary and exploratory outcomes will be assessed at
baseline and week-4. Other optional assessments include quality of life (NIH Global Health PROMIS), depression (Center
for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_6328], CES-D), cognitive function MoCA), and psychosocial metrics (e.g. fatigue,
anxiety , frailty , sleep, etc). These assessments are optional and will be done upon time availability and patient acceptance.
We anticipate that duration of all assessments will not exceed 60 minutes. W e will be reviewing the billing records for our7/5/24, 12:09 PM Human Protocol Report
https://brain.bcm.edu/esp1/reports/Human/Protocol.asp?protocol=477460 5/14
patients to explore costs of both groups. W e may visit the patient's home for an appointment that doesn't require the
physician present or to fix any issues with the device.
There will be an optional follow up visit up to three and six months after the last visit to determine any potential wound
complications (e.g., patient unhappi[INVESTIGATOR_805041] , infection and quality of life etc). During this visit,
study coordinator will photograph both incision sites using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS, KENT  camera) and a digital
photo. Practitioner will assess scarring using the SCAR and/or POSAS scale.
Dressing Change: All patients will have their dressing changed weekly (screening/initial visit and visits 1-4), the intervention
site will be treated continuously with oxygen from the OxyGeni device. Prior to application of the OxyGeni, research staf f
will: Select a 5x5cm OxySpur O2 dressing that will cover the wound; W rap dressing as directed by [CONTACT_5936]. This may
facilitate delivery of oxygen to the incision site or wound bed.
Data collection: - Medical History: Relevant patient medical history (e.g. type of cancer , type of therapy , other comorbidity
such as diabetes and stroke, history of surgery , number of prescription and over counter medication, etc) will be collected
at baseline via questionnaire or patient electronic health record.
- Social Factors: marital status, years of education, type of work, tobacco history (pack years, current smoker , current use
of chewing tobacco, previous smoker , no tobacco history), drug history (current, previous history , no drug history), and
alcohol history . These factors will be collected at screening/baseline visit.
Tissue Oxygen Saturation (primary outcome): Tissue oxygenation level will be assessed using Kent Imaging system at
baseline and every study visit. The device uses light in the near-infrared spectrum that harmlessly passes through the skin
and reflects of f the blood supplying the tissue to determine tissue oxygen saturation, a key indicator of tissue health. The
NIRS light has two key features that make it useful for measuring the viability of living tissue. Firstly , NIRS light is not
absorbed by [CONTACT_805058]. Secondly , NIRS light is mainly absorbed by [CONTACT_805059] . Most importantly , the wavelength dependent light absorption of hemoglobin dif fers if it is carrying oxygen from when
it is not. This makes NIRS light very useful in detecting oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, which conveys a
comprehensive pi[INVESTIGATOR_805042].
Wound Assessment (primary outcome): A digital photo/video of wound will be taken for wound size verification, estimation
of wound size, success of wound healing, and determination of wound dehiscence. Measurement will be performed at
every visit.
Pain Intensity Assessment (V AS) (secondary outcome): The subject will be provided with a numeric pain scale where
he/she will report pain intensity . Research staf f will document subject's pain level. (Collected at every visit)
Adverse Event Reporting: Research Staf f will document and report any study/non study related incident as per institution
regulations. (Collected at baseline and visits 1- 4)
Device Acceptability Questionnaire: To determine patient perception of benefit, perceived ease of use, and attitude toward
the use of device, we will use a technology acceptance model (T AM) questionnaire tailored for the purpose of this study .
This assessment will be done at the conclusion of the study (week-4)
Questionnaires (optional): Quality of Life (PROMIS), functional status, Frailty Status (TSFI), Cognitive Assessment, and
Sleep Quality (PSQI). To evaluate functional status, we will use well accepted and validated general functional assessment
instruments. PFIBS for Pain Frequency , Intensity and Burden Scale, MOCA  for Mental Exam, and V isual analog scale for
pain. (All questionnaires are optional and may be done at any study visit upon time availability and patient acceptability).
We will add the already approved questionnaires for the parent study , which include pain. Additionally , we will include Likert
Scales (Moon SH et al, 201 1; Singer AJ et al 1997; Hollander JE et al 1995; and Ridway DM et al 2007) and Patient
Attitude to Scarring Scale (P ASS, Kantor J et al 2016) and Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) to
assess the following patient-reported outcomes: patient satisfaction and cosmetic appearance to evaluate scar itchy ,
perception of scar thickness, scar discomfort, and pain for each wound side (i.e., left and right breast). SCAR may be used
to assess plastic surgeon satisfaction with the scarring. These questionnaires will be answered to the best of the
participant's abilities. Should the participant lack certain capacities that make it dif ficult for them to respond to these
questionnaires, they will not be conducted with that participant.
The plastic surgeon (Dr . Sebastian Winocour) will perform the initial consultation with the patient in the clinical setting
(initial and pre-operative consult). Once the patient is aware of the study protocol, the study coordinator will obtain consent
on the day of surgery . Research coordinators are responsible to revise the medical records (e.g., Epic) on a weekly basis
in order to screen possible candidates undergoing reduction mammoplasty that could fit for the study . If the patient fits the
criteria, the research coordinator will communicate the candidate's information (e.g., name, date of surgery) to Dr .
Winocour . Candidates will be consented on the day of surgery upon plastic surgeon approval.
Baseline visit: After consenting the patient, the research coordinator will attend to the surgery . When the plastic surgeon
closes the incision, the research coordinator will obtain the tissue oxygenation image using (non-invasive) NIRS, and then
the surgeon will place the dressing immediately (The CDO dressing will be applied on the T-inframammary fold of the
breast incision), followed by [CONTACT_805060]. After surgery , the research coordinator will wait until the patient is
coherent in the post-operative recovery area. Then, they will educate the patient on proper device use.7/5/24, 12:09 PM Human Protocol Report

Section G:  Sample Size/Data Analysis
G1.  Sample Size
How many subjects (or specimens, or charts) will be used in this study?
     Local: 30              W orldwide: 30
Please indicate why you chose the sample size proposed:
     This is an exploratory proof of concept study . The anticipated sample size (n=30) is selected based on resource/budget
availability and feasibility to be completed within one year . This sample size is estimated to be suf ficient to determine
feasibility and proof of concept ef ficacy of Continuous Dif fusion of Oxygen (CDO) adjunct therapy to improve tissue oxygen
supply and reduce likelihood of adverse events. Upon initial results and availability of budget, the sample size may be
increased to clinically validate the initial observation. In this case, an addendum will be submitted to increase sample size if
needed.
G2.  Data Analysis
Provide a description of your plan for data analysis. State the types of comparisons you plan (e.g. comparison of means,
comparison of proportions, regressions, analysis of variance). Which is the PRIMAR Y comparison/analysis? How will the
analyses proposed relate to the primary purposes of your study?
     The primary outcomes of this study are 1) tissue oxygen saturation level measured using Kent Imaging system and 2)
incident of wound related adverse events (e.g., incident wound dehiscence , infection, scar size, and surgical revision).
Secondarily outcomes include pain, wound outcomes (e.g. wound size, scar size, wound healing rate, etc assessed using
digital photography), area of inflammation (assessed using KENT), and pain (assessed using V AS). Exploratory outcomes
include patient quality of life, sleep quality , anxiety , and depression. Baseline between group comparison will be dine using
two-sample t-tests, Mann-Whitney U-test, or Chi-square depend on scale/distribution of the variables (i.e., parametric, non-
parametric, or binary). W e will use general mixed linear model and post-hoc analysis to examine dif ference between7/5/24, 12:09 PM Human Protocol Report
https://brain.bcm.edu/esp1/reports/Human/Protocol.asp?protocol=477460 7/14
groups (time, group, and time X group ef fect) for skin perfusion. W e will adjust the results based on baseline incision
wound size and duration between baseline and last visit assessment. Subjects with at least one week continue treatment
will be included in the analysis. Controlled variables include age, BMI, baseline vascular health. W e will use chi-square to
estimate whether the number of wound complication incidents is less in the intervention group compared to the control
group. Chi-square or repeated ANOV A or Mann-U test depend on scale/distribution of the variable will be used for
secondary and exploratory outcomes.
 
Section H:  Potential Risks/Discomforts
H1.  Potential Risks/Discomforts
Describe and assess any potential risks/discomforts; (physical, psychological, social, legal, or other) and assess the likelihood
and seriousness of such risks:
     As any new investigational device, there are some risks, which are anticipated to be minimal in this study . Some of
potential risks could be: * Skin related discomfort, erythema (redness), skin rash, dryness and itching. * Skin allergic
reaction to dressing adhesive. * Tenderness/minor ache around the dressing application area * Heat sensation and/or
perspi[INVESTIGATOR_805043] * Some impairment of mobility due to dressing unit
Some of the study devices (OxyGeni, KENT) and technology are completely non-invasive, safe, non-toxic and non-
ionizing. The potential risks are minimal. However , like any battery powered systems, there is a minimum risk of sensor
malfunctioning. In addition, the study devices are not waterproof, and although they use a low powered battery (similar to a
cell-phone battery), in order to avoid any risk of shock the monitor should not be submerged or saturated with fluids during
operations or cleaning.
When wearing the study devices, there is a small risk of trippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. The dressing will be connected to the OxyGeni device
through a thin tube that will be placed comfortably along the subject's legs underneath their clothing. W e will instruct the
subject to place the tube correctly to minimize any risk of trippi[INVESTIGATOR_007].
Subjects must be willing to charge device battery daily . Otherwise they will not receive benefit from treatment. OxyGeni is a
wireless chargeable device to increase patient comfort.
The assessments described above are expected to be minimal risk and probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort
anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the
performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.

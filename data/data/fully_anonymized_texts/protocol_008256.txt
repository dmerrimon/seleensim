Exclu sion Criteria 1. History of severe or chronic immunosuppression, an immunocom promised 
condition, known or suspected HIV , extensive dermatomycoses, ex tensive 
recurrent herpes zoster or severe dermatitis affecting the feet  that would 
interfere with safety and tolerability assessments. 
2. Any systemic or dermatologic disorder, such as uncontrolled ps oriasis, 
severe eczema, or severe atopic dermatitis which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of the 
investigator, will interfere with the study results or increase  the risk of 
adverse events (subjects with m ild, controlled psoriasis, eczem a, or 
dermatitis may be included if the condition would not interfere with safety 
and tolerability assessments). 
3. Any severe and/or chronic disease that would affect a subject’s nail growth 
or interfere with the subject’s ability to complete the trial, such as severe 
renal failure, peripheral vascular disease, severe chronic obst ructive 
pulmonary disease, severe heart disease, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or 
other endocrine disease, or uncontrolled malignancy. 
4. History of toenail surgery or any significant injury to the tar get toenail matrix.

assessment of clear nail. 
12. Structural deformities of the ta rget toenail or foot (eg, gene tic or pi[INVESTIGATOR_432994], chemical damage, tumors) that would interfere with t reatment 
procedures or with assessments of efficacy, safety, or tolerabi lity. 
13. Suspected subungual dermatophytoma.  
14. Any  other condition that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_432995] s ubject 
unsuitable for participation in this study. 
EFFICACY 
ASSESSMENTS  Efficacy is determined in the target great toenail by  
x evaluation of clinical cure (complete clearance of signs and sy mptoms) 
using the Investigator Global Assessment Scale, further documen ted by 
[CONTACT_433017], and  
x laboratory confirmation of mycological cure (negative culture f or 
dermatophytes and negative KOH microscopy). 
From these assessments the efficacy outcomes of complete cure ( mycological 
cure and clinical cure), mycological cure, clinical cure and effect ive treatment  
(no more than  10% affected nail) will be  determined.  
  
 
SAFETY ASSESSMENTS Safety assessments include monitoring AEs and local tolerabilit y at the 
administration site using a 4-point scale.  Pain assessments at time of treatment 
and [ADDRESS_548707] procedure.  Results of physical examination and vita l signs 
measurements will be assessed. 
STATISTICAL METHODS Cure rates will be estimated along with 95% confidence interval s.  Interval 
parameters su ch as length and ratios will be characterized using descriptive 
statistics. The primary analysis population will be the intent -to-treat population. 
The analysis of safety is conducted in the population of all tr eated subjects.  
Rates of AEs and local tolerance assessments will be presented descriptively.  
Events of clinical significance will be identified individually  and described without 
inferential statistics.

4.2 Study Outcome Measures 
 
4.2.1 Primary 
The primary outcome measure, complete cure at Visit 10 (Week 48 ), is based on clinical 
evaluation of “clear nail” using the Investigator ’s Global Assessment (IGA) Scale 
(Section 9.1.1 ) and laboratory confirmation of mycological cure of the target  toenail 
(Section 9.1.2 ). 
 The investigator will evaluate the  extent of clear nail or abse nce of signs of residual 
onychomycosis using the IGA Scale ( Table 4-1 ), with a Grade 0 representative of a 
clinical cure.  The investigator ’s assessment will be documented by [CONTACT_433020], Inc.  
Subu
ngual samples will be assessed for KOH visualization by [CONTACT_433021] a laboratory.  Since subjects enro ll with both a positive 
KOH (fungal elements present at microscopy) and positive cultur e for dermatophytes, a 
mycological cure is declared when both laboratory assessments a re negative. DocuSign Envelope ID: E280DC56-9E9B-42D6-BB34-6F0330B38E6C

well as any clinical involvement of other toenails.  Thickness of subungual 
hyperkeratosis will be measured i n millimeters (one decimal poi nt) from the top of the 
nail plate to the nail bed, us ing a caliper.  Nail width will b e recorded in millimeters  
   
 
The a f

transverse demarcation extending across the distal digit that d ivides the hyponychium 
from the volar epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196]).  Subjects are therefore allowed to c ut their toenails, but not 
beyond the target nail’s distal gro ove so as not to interfere w ith the assessment of clear 
nail.  
 9.1.1 Investigator Global Assessment of Clear Nail Evaluation of clear nail will be based upon that portion of sur face area of the nail that is 
clear of signs of disease (ie, nail dystrophy, onycholysis or s ubungual hyperkeratosis) 
attributable to onychomycosis and active infection.  The invest igator will assess the 
involved great toenail for the ex tent of clear nail using the i nvestigator Global 
Assessment (IGA) Scale.  Missing nail is considered diseased na il.

10.4 Adverse Events 
 
10.4.1 Adverse Event Definition and Documentation An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a s ubject, administered 
an investigational product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with this treatment (21 CFR 312.32).  An AE (also referred to as an adverse 
experience) can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sig n (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated 
with the use of an investigational product, whether or not cons idered related to the 
investigational product. 
 
Adverse events may be volunteered spontaneously by [CONTACT_433047] a 
result of general, non-leading questioning, through physical ex amination, laboratory 
test, or other means.  Adverse events resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions t o concurrent illnesses, 
reactions to concurrent medicatio ns, or progression of disease states must be recorded.  
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subj ect is screened but does 
not deteriorate should not be reported as an AE.  However, if t he signs or symptoms 
associated with the medical condition deteriorate at any time d uring the study, it should 
be recorded as an AE.  
Abnormal laboratory values or test results will be recorded as AEs only if (1) they induce 
clinical signs or symptoms, (2) require therapy, or (3) are con sidered by [CONTACT_433048].  Prior medical conditions/disea ses are considered AEs only 
if they worsen after the start of protocol-specified study proc edures.  
 All AEs reported or observed from the time a subject signs info rmed consent until exit 
from the study must be recorded in detail on the appropriate pa ge of the CRF and 
followed until the event is resolved, the event reaches a clini cally stable outcome, or the 
subject is lost to follow-up.  For each AE, the AE record will include type of event, start 
and stop dates, severity (mild, moderate, or severe), seriousne ss, relationship to the 
study treatment (definite, probably, possibly, unlikely, or not  related), actions taken 
(required treatment or observations), and outcome. 
 
Adverse events that are prospectively collected as outcomes or observations include 
procedure related pain, post-treatment symptoms collected in a subject diary and an 
investigator assessment of the nail before and after treatment.   For the purpose of this 
study this prospectively collected information will not be agai n reported as AEs unless:  
x Considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_737], 
x Requiring treatment or study treatment modification, or 
x Meeting the criteria for a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
A temporary change in nail appearance reasonably associated wit h healing or clearing 
of disease is not considered an adverse event, unless any of th e 3 criteria above apply. DocuSign Envelope ID: E280DC56-9E9B-42D6-BB34-6F0330B38E6C
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol No.: HTS-002B Hallux, Inc. 
Version 3.0 12 September 2017 40 of 68  10.4.2 Serious Adverse Events 
An AE or SAR is considered “serious” (see 21 CFR 312.32) if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, the adverse event: 
x Results in death. 
x Is life threatening (i.e., the subject was at risk of death at  the time of the event; it 
does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have cause d death if it was 
more severe). 
x Requires insubject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] x Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial  disruption of the 
ability to conduct activities of normal life. 
x Is a congenital anomaly / birth defect. x Is considered to be an important medical event. 
 
Based upon medical and scientific judgment, important medical e vents that may not be 
immediately life threatening, or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12191], but may jeopardize the 
subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other  outcomes listed in the 
definition above may be considered  a serious adverse event (SAE ). 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_433010], not necessarily an overnight stay for observation or for an out-subject procedure.  If, however, the investigator feels that the 
cause of the out-subject procedure or overnight stay is medical ly significant, then the 
event will be considered an SAE with the serious criteria of Important Medical Event.  A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_433011] n ot an SAE.  Additionally, if 
a subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80529] a procedure that was planned prio r to the study, this will not 
be considered an SAE.  If a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4956], such as for a fever, then that 
fever will be considered an SAE. 
10.[ADDRESS_548755] all reportable events with start d ates occurring any time after 
informed consent is obtained until 7 (for non-serious AEs) or 3 0 days (for SAEs) after 
the last day of study participation in the CRF.  At each study visit, the investigator will 
inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit.  Events will be followed for 
outcome information until resolution or stabilization. 
10.6 Adverse Event Characteristics 
Each AE has three attributes as described in .  
Severity and relationship to study treatment are recorded in th e
  CRF by [CONTACT_093].  
The Medical Monitor and the Study PI [INVESTIGATOR_433012].  An adverse event will be considered unexpected if the 
nature, severity, or frequency of  the event is not consistent w ith the risk information 
previously described for the intervention.      DocuSign Envelope ID: E280DC56-9E9B-42D6-BB34-6F0330B38E6C

CONFIDENTIAL Protocol No.: HTS-002B Hallux, Inc. 
Version 3.0 12 September 2017 41 of 68  10.6.1 Adverse Event Severity 
The investigator will classify the severity (intensity) of each  AE according to the 
following definitions summarized in Table 10-1: 
 
Table 10-1  Adverse Event Severity 
Classification Definition 
Mild 
Moderate 
Severe 
 
It should be pointed out that the term “severe” is a measure of intensity and that a 
severe AE is not necessarily serious.  10.6.[ADDRESS_548756] related to any dose should be considered an Adverse Rea ction (AR).  The 
phrase “responses to a medicinal product” means that a causal relationship between a medicinal product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibilit y. 
 A suspected adverse reaction (SA R) therefore indicates any AE f or which there is a 
reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event, ie, there is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. 
 
The determination of the causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event 
will be based in part on the investigator’s a ssessment of the relationship of the AE to the 
investigational treatment.  An AE considered by [CONTACT_20616] r to be probably or 
definitely related to the study t reatment is to be considered a n AR, and an AE 
considered by [CONTACT_433049] a SAR, but not an AR.  An AE considered by [CONTACT_433050] t o be related, or to be 
unrelated, to the study treatment, is not a SAR, unless the spo nsor determines 
otherwise based on other evidence.  The investigator will assess th e likely relationship of each AE  to the investigational 
product according to the definitions outlined in Table 10-[ADDRESS_548757]

Investigator ’s Brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the ri sk 
information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amended.  “Unexpected” as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or SARs that are mentioned 
in the Investigator ’s Brochure as occurring with a cla ss of drugs or as anticipated from 
the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifi cally mentioned as 
occurring with the particular drug under investigation.

Follow-up information about a previously reported SAE must also  be reported to the 
medical monitor (or designee) within [ADDRESS_548759]’s subsequ ent course should be 
submitted until the SAE has subsided, the condition stabilized (in the case of persistent impairment), the subject receives alternative therapy, or the subject dies.  DocuSign Envelope ID: E280DC56-9E9B-42D6-BB34-6F0330B38E6C

unexpected to all concerned Investigators/Institutions, to the Institutional Review Boards 
(IRBs), where required, and to the regulatory authority(ies).  A single or small number of 
events of a specific AE must be r eported as a SAR only if there  is a reasonable 
possibility that study product caused the event (ie, there is e vidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study product and the AE).  For exampl e: 
x A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly 
associated with drug exposure (eg, angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens-Johnson 
Syndrome and acute liver failure); 
x One or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly assoc iated with drug 
exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed t o the drug (eg, 
tendon rupture); 
x An aggregate analysis of specif ic events observed in a clinica l trial (such as known 
consequences of the underlying disease or condition under inves tigation or other 
events that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) 
that indicates those events occur more frequently in the drug t reatment group than a 
concurrent or historical control group.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Increased rate of seri ous suspected adverse reactions 
The sponsor must also report any clinically important increase in the frequency of a 
serious SAR over that which is li sted in the protocol or Invest igator ’s Brochure.

Source data are all information, original records of clinical f indings, observations, or 
other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstr uction and evaluation of the 
trial.  Source data may be writt en or typed by [CONTACT_433054] q ualified study personnel 
directly from clinical observation, or they may be generated, o n paper or electronically, 
by [CONTACT_433055].  Source documents may include, for example, subject medical reco rds, screening or 
enrollment logs, laboratory repo rts, electrocardiograms, subjec t diaries, drug dispensing 
and collection records, drug accounting logs, study notes, and study-related 
correspondence. 
 
In order to ensure the integrity of the study data, procedures must be in place to allow 
every element of the study data to be traced to its source.  It  is the responsibility of the 
study monitor to verify that data recorded on the CRF are an ac curate transcription of 
the source data.  The source documents are typi[INVESTIGATOR_433013], 
and may include data that are not relevant to the study databas e and are therefore not 
subject to study-related quality control procedures.    The study site must maintain a list of originators (persons, de vices, and instruments) of 
all source data.  The list for persons should include signature s, initials, and user 
identification (user ID) tags that will permit a reviewer to tr ace the source data records to 
their originator.  
In order to facilitate source dat a verification of the CRF, all  source documents must be 
maintained at the study site in individual subject folders.  Wh ile not strictly a source 
document, the original signed Informed Consent document is to b e kept in the same 
folder for ease of review.  Sou rce documents must be maintained  in the same way for 
all enrolled study subjects and for screen failures (individual s who are screened for the 
study but who do not meet the entrance criteria).  The investigator must assure that the subject’s anonymity will be maintained.  On all 
study documentation, with the ex ception of the consent form and  subject identification 
logs, subjects will only be identified by [CONTACT_433056].  
All records will be kept in a se cure storage area with limited access.  Clinical information 
will not be released without the written permission of the subject (or the subject’s legal guardian), except as necessary for  monitoring and auditing by t he Sponsor, its

the EDC will be provided to study staff prior to study start.   
 Each page of the CRF is headed by [CONTACT_433066], 
subject number, and study visit number or time point. Entries t o the CRF are made by 
[CONTACT_433067] t o written CRF Completion Guide lines for the study or as 
instructed by a qualified trainer at study initiation.  Case report form entries may be written directly from clinical observation or they may be 
transcribed from source data recorded at an earlier time.  The originator of the data (ie, 
the individual making the observation or evaluation) date and t ime of the recorded event 
are captured electronically.   Each CRF must be completed within 5 days of a visit, reviewed, and subsequently 
signed, and dated by [CONTACT_433068] t timeline.  The completed 
CRF will be reviewed by [CONTACT_433069]. A copy of the 
completed CRF will be provided to the investigator. The copy wi ll remain at the site in 
the investigator ’s files.  
 Computer systems and devices which are used to produce electron ic source documents 
must conform to the principles described in relevant regulatory  guidances (eg, the 
FDA’s Draft Guidance [December 2010] on Electronic Source Docume ntation in Clinical 
Investigations, and references therein), which are designed to ensure the security and 
integrity of those data sources.

 A screening log will be kept to m onitor and analyze reasons for  screen failure.  
 The quality of subungual sampling will be assessed for the abil ity of the investigator to 
visualize septate hyphae.  In addition, results from the Center  of Medical Mycology will 
be reviewed for evidence of bacterial contamination of the samp le and the ability of a 
clinical diagnosis of DLSO to be confirmed by [CONTACT_433070].  The review may lead 
to modifications to the subungual sampling technique at the sit e. DocuSign Envelope ID: E280DC56-9E9B-42D6-BB34-6F0330B38E6C

  Revised 1/30/[ADDRESS_351051] Participation Duration 6 months 
Objectives  Evaluate the efficacy of the RestoreX penile traction device  in 
restoring length loss secondary to diabetes mellitus  
Number of Subjects 120 
Diagnosis and Main Inclusion Criteria  Men with diabetes mellitus, type II  
Study Device  RestoreX® , penile traction therapy 
Duration of Exposure Subjects in Groups 1 -3 will use device for 3  months for 30 minutes, 
twice daily .  Subjects in Group 4 will be control and will not use the 
device.  
 
After the randomized period, subjects using the device will switch to not using the device (Group 1), using the device once weekly x 30 minutes (Group 2), or continuing to use the device twice daily x 
3 months (Group 3).   
Reference therapy  The use of the device will be compared against a control group 
using no traction therapy.  Individuals will also be compared to 
themselves to evaluate changes from baseline.   
Statistical Methodology Stratification of subjects prior to randomization to assure an equ al 
representation based on baseline penile length.  Statistical comparisons will be made comparing total penile length prior to and following therapy.  Comparisons of subjective questionnaire responses will also be made between groups and at the various ti me 
points captured.   
   
 
 
IRB: 18 -006696   Version 4.0 
  Revised 1/30/[ADDRESS_351052] evaluated the role of traction therapy in men with diabetes.  The objective of the current study is to evaluate the efficacy of the RestoreX penile traction device (developed by [CONTACT_288009]) in restoring penile length in men with established diabetes mellitus.   
1.2 Investigational Device  
 
RestoreX is a PTT device developed by [CONTACT_288010].  The device is classified as class I (orthotic) and does not require clinical trials to prove safety or efficacy.  Mayo Clinic is currently conducting a randomized clinical trial to evaluate several clinically relevant factors including safety, comfort, and preference 
and to provide preliminary data on dosing and efficacy (IRB  17-001283).   
 The device has two functional aspects.  The first is the ability to provide direct traction on the penis.  The second is the ability to provide counter-bending forces, to treat conditions such as Peyronie’s disease (bent penis).  In the current study, only the direct traction aspects of the device will be investigated.   
1.3 Preliminary  Data  
 
Currently, there is a smal l amount of preliminary data available on the RestoreX® 
instrument.  During the developmental phase of the device, a quality improvement project was performed to evaluate the clampi[INVESTIGATOR_288001].  It was determined  that the clamp 
represented the most critical  aspect of the device, as this was where the majority of 
discomfort occurred with other devices.  Additionally, the clamp needed to provide sufficient friction to allow adequate traction without having the glans of the penis dislodge from the device.   
 A total of [ADDRESS_351053] supervision for 30 minutes. After the 30 minutes, all patients reported 0/[ADDRESS_351054] despi[INVESTIGATOR_288002].  This also resulted in a successful 
IRB: 18 -006696   Version 4.0 
  Revised 1/30/[ADDRESS_351055]. Ziegelmann    outcome, with all patients able to successfully achieve a mi nimum required tension of 1 kg, 
with a 36% safety factor achieved before any discomfort was reported among any patient.  
During the testing, patients reported improved comfort with the use of a wrap such as gauze or Coban, which permitted additional traction in all patients.    Regarding background data on the RestoreX device, currently, Mayo Clinic is conducting a randomized clinical trial evaluating its role in men with PD  (IRB
 17-001283).  Preliminary 
data have demonstrated efficacy of the device with all end points (improvement in length, curvature, satisfaction, and standardized questionnaires).  Detailed information is also captured on adverse events.  Among men in the treatment group, the most common adverse events were erythema (31 %), cold glans (4%), and minor discomfort (52%).  All symptoms 
resolved within 5 minutes of discontinuing use, with the exception of one patient (4%) who experienced minor discomfort for 15 minutes.  Findings are consistent with other traction device studies.       
1.4 Study Rationale and Risk Analysis ( Risk s to Benefits  Ratio) 
1.4.[ADDRESS_351056] evaluated the role of PTT in restoring penile length in men with diabetes mellitus (DM), a condition known to result in decreased penile length.  The current study is designed to address this gap in the literature.   
1.4.2 Potential Benefits  
 There are several potential benefits to using PTT.  As loss of penile length results in several issues including loss of sexual function, cosmetic concerns, and diff iculty in maintaining 
hygiene (incontinence resulting in yeast infections), the ability to maintain or restore length may mitigate thes e issues.  Additionally, men with DM have an increased rate of 
development of penile curvature (PD), which can be both functionally and psychologically distressing.  PTT has previously been demonstrated to limit the extent of penile curvature that men experience among those with early PD, and therefore, the use of PTT in men with DM may reduce the likelihood of either developi[INVESTIGATOR_288003].  It is unclear if PTT will impact (improve or worsen) erectile rigidity in men with DM, although preliminary data from the current PTT study in men with PD (IRB
 17-
001283) has demonstrated improvements in erectile function.     
1.5 Anticipated Duration of the Clinical Investigation  
 
The overall study will be scheduled for 3 years, to permit adequate time for enrollment and follow-up.  The intervention phase will include 6 months of randomized treatment (for the treatment arm) .

  Revised 1/30/[ADDRESS_351059]. Ziegelmann    3.2 Setting  
 
The current study will be conducted at the Mayo Clinic in [COMPANY_002]ster, MN Depar tment  of 
Urology.  All patients will be recruited from mailers to Mayo Clinic patients with a known 
history of DM.  
3.3 Recruitment  
Patients  with a known history of DM, type II will be sent a mailer and offered participation if 
meeting inclusion / exclusion criteria.  Those interested in proceeding with the trial will be 
invited to meet with a study coordinator. A t that  time, the  details of the study itself will be 
reviewed  with the potential participant.  Financial incentives will be provided, to include 
$[ADDRESS_351060] visit and $250 for each follow- up visit if meeting inclusion / exclusion 
criteria.  P articipants will also be given a Rest oreX® device at no charge. Patients will not be 
charged for any visits related to the study, and no labs or other testing will be obtained which require payment.    Patients may also be recruited directly from the DM clinical practice, however, it is not anticipated that this will be the primary source of recruitment.   
 
3.[ADDRESS_351061] in 
participating  at any of these time s, a formal consent will be reviewed  (see Attachment – 
Consent Form ).  
 At enrollment, all p articipants  will be assigned a study identifier, with a master list 
maintained in a password protected database (Mayo server  – RAVE database) linking the 
patient to the identifier.  A total of [ADDRESS_351062] been previously seen at Mayo Clinic for a condition of DM.  Following enrollment, key factors relating to their underlying condition will be abstracted from the chart by a study coordinator, including age, duration of disease (if known), number of DM medications, use of insulin, most recent fasting glucose and HbA1c, creatinine, and testosterone, HOMA1- IR, HOMA2 -IR, and BMI.  If any of these variables are not available, 
no additional attempts will be made to retrieve the information.   
IRB: 18 -006696   Version 4.0 
  Revised 1/30/[ADDRESS_351063]. Ziegelmann     
At the initial appointment, patients will also undergo a penile length assessment by a urology provider and Men’s Health Nurse and receive questionnaires (IIEF- 15 and disease specific 
history)  Once consent and study assessment s are completed , the patients will be randomized into one 
of four groups:  
1. PTT for 30 min 2x/day x 3 months, followed by [CONTACT_288011] x 3 months 
2. PTT for 30 min 2x/day x 3 months, followed by [CONTACT_288012] (30 minutes) x 3 months 
3. PTT for 30 min 2x/day x 6 months   
4. Control ( no treatment)  
 Patients in the treatment arm will record a daily journa l of their usage of the device. Patients 
will then begin using the device as instru cted for the ti mes appropriate to their group.  
 After 3 months of using the device (+1.5 months permitted), patients will return for subse quent assessments (see below)  and a follow-up questionnaire . At this time, patients will 
be encouraged to report any adverse events. They will also be requested to bring their devic e 
back to the clinic to review proper usage and any questions on the device. After completion 
of the subsequent assessme nts, patients will begin the second phase of the trial.   
 After 6 months (+ 1.5 months permitted) patients will return to the clinic to  undergo final 
assessments, which are identical to the 3-month assessments.    Since participants are being asked to travel to Mayo Clinic for subsequent assessments, we will provide a remuneration amount of up to $600. The purpose is to assist participants in their travel to and from Mayo Clinic. Those that provide consent will be provided $[ADDRESS_351064] visits (3 and 6-months, respectively), they will receive $250  for a possible total of $600.    
 
3.6 Randomization Protocol 
 
Following enrollment and completion of the initial length assessment, patien ts will be 
categorized into the appropriate strata based on their baseline stretched penile length ; strata 
categorized as <10 cm, 10cm -13cm , 13.1cm -16cm, >16cm stretched  length. Each stratum 
will have a separate randomization table provided such that one of three  possible outcomes 
will occur no less frequently than every other case. This is done to better account for baseline variables that may impact outcomes  and to assist with matching groupi[INVESTIGATOR_288004].   
 
The explanation of which groupi[INVESTIGATOR_288005], and if the 
patient subject is assigned to the treatment group, a RestoreX® device will be provided.

5.1 Data Handling 
 All data will be recorded either by [CONTACT_288013] (Attachments).  Information will remain de -identified throughout the 
remainder of the study period and will remain on password protected, Mayo servers.    After completion of the study, de-identified information will be shared with individuals associated with PathRight Medical, Inc. who may assist with portions of the data analysis and/or manuscript drafting.  No identifiable information will be sent.    
5.2 Statistical Analysis  
 
IRB: 18 -006696   Version 4.0 
  Revised 1/30/[ADDRESS_351067]-traction for individual participants will also be reviewed.    The data will also be analyzed in three ways: 1 - with all patients included, regardless of their 
compliance to utilize  the device for the recommended treatment time, 2 - with patients 
excluded if they failed to achieve 90% compliance with the recommended duration of 
treatment, 3 - with patients exclu ded if they failed to achieve 75 % compliance with the 
recommended duration of treatment.   Factors which will also be included to determine 
compliance will include frequency and duration of use and whether or not the device was used correctly (black rods buried, amount of time white line showing).    Comparisons will also be made on other subjective and objective variables obtained including number of adverse events, complications, subjective responses to questionnaires, or other information.  All data will be normalized by [CONTACT_288014].    
6 Safety and Adverse Events  
 Definition of Adverse Event  
 Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845]) - any unanticipated problem or adverse event that meets the following three criteria:   Serious: Serious problems or events that results in significant harm, (which may be physical, psychological, financial, social, economic, or legal) or increased risk for the subject or others (including individuals who are not research subjects). These include: (1) death; (2) life threatening adverse experience; (3) hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] - inpatient, new, or prolonged; (4) disability/incapacity - persistent or significant; (5) breach of confidentiality and (6) other problems, events, or new information (i.e. publications, interim findings, product labeling change) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_14846], safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or substantially compromise the research data, AND  Unanticipated: (i.e. unexpected) problems or events are those that are not already described as potential risks in the protocol, consent document, not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure, or not part of an underlying disease. A problem or event is "unanticipated" when it was unforeseeable at the time of its occurrence. A problem or event is "unanticipated" when it occurs  at an increased frequency or at an increased severity than expected, AND  
 Related: A problem or event is "related" if it is possibly related to the research procedures.  
 Adverse Event - an untoward or undesirable experience associated with the use of a medical product (i.e. drug, device, biologic) in a patient or research subject.  
IRB: 18 -006696   Version 4.0 
  Revised 1/30/[ADDRESS_351068]. Ziegelmann    Serious Adverse Event - adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  Serious 
problems/events can be well defined and include: 
 • Death  
• Life threatening adverse experience  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Inpatient, new, or prolonged; disability/incapacity • And/or per protocol may be problems/events that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_37021]-investigator may have adversely affected the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or substantially compromised the research data.  All AEs that do not meet any of the criteria for serious, should be regarded as non-serious AEs.   
6.[ADDRESS_351069] the study team to report any additional adverse events during the 6 months following study completion.   
6.2 Preexisting Condition 
 
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period.  At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.

6.4 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_288006] d as a serious AE.   
 
IRB: 18 -006696   Version 4.0 
  Revised 1/30/[ADDRESS_351071]. Ziegelmann    Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as 
an adverse event in the following circumstances:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_288007] a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an 
adverse event if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.  
6.5 Recording of Adverse Events  
 
The study team will seek information on adverse events by [CONTACT_288015] -up visits.  Information on all adverse events will be recorded 
immediately in the adverse event section of the specific questionnaire as well as in an adverse event form (see Attachment – Adverse Event Form).  All adverse events occurring during the study period will be recorded.  The clinical course will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been ultimately determined that the study treatment or participation is not the probable cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period will be followed up, to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be at least poss ibly related to the study treatment or study participation will be recorded and 
reported immediately.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_351072] the study participant and then complete the Adverse Event Form.  The sponsor-investigator will evaluate the event and determine the necessary follow-up and reporting required.  
6.6.1 Sponsor -investigator Reporting: Notifying the Mayo IRB 
 
An adverse event form will be completed for any serious adverse event.  This will be reported to the Mayo IRB in a de-identified manner.    The study team will report to the Mayo IRB any UPI[INVESTIGATOR_68258]-UPI[INVESTIGATOR_288008] s. 
 Information collected on the adverse event form (and entered into the research database)

  Revised 1/30/[ADDRESS_351073]. Ziegelmann    • Action taken to address  
• Relationship to study 
• Impact on study withdrawal • Classification as serious or not  The sponsor- investigator will review all adverse event reports to determine if specific reports 
need to be made to the IRB.  The sponsor- investigator will sign  and date the adverse event 
report when it is reviewed.  For this protocol, only directly related SAEs/UPI[INVESTIGATOR_205276].  
6.6.[ADDRESS_351074] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following: 
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why 
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI. 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to coll ect at least vital status (long term 
survival status that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period. 
7.2 Source Documents  
 
IRB: 18 -006696   Version 4.0

Protocol  Number:  mRNA -1325 -P101  
Title:  A Phase 1, Randomized, Placebo- Controlled, Dose -Ranging Study to 
Evaluate the Safety and Immunogenicity of mRNA -1325 Zika Vaccine 
in Healthy Adults in a Non -endemic Zika Region 
Study Phase:  1 
Study Sites:  At least 2 sites in the [LOCATION_002] or its territories  
Objectives:  Primary:  
• To assess the safety of a 2 -dose vaccination schedule of 
mRNA- 1325 Zika vaccine, given 28 days apart, across a range 
of dose levels in flavivirus -seronegative and 
flavivirus-seropositive subjects compared with  placebo. 
Secondary:  
• To assess the immunogenicity of a range of doses of 
mRNA- [ADDRESS_642337] into further development, based on changes from 
Baseline in the following tests: 
• Zika virus (ZikaV) -specific neutralizing antibody titer s 
measured by a Plaque Reduction Neutralizing Titer  EC50 
(PRNT50); 
Exploratory: 
• ZikaV antigen- specific stimulation of T cells measured by 
[CONTACT_499230] (IFN γ) enzyme -linked ImmunoSpot 
(ELISPOT) on subject -derived peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs) , if results of interim immunogenicity analys es 
warrant further analyses of samples.  
• To assess the impact of mRNA -1325 Zika vaccine on a range 
of other functional and diagnostic flavivirus assays. 
Study Design and 
Methodology: This is a Phase 1, double -blind, placebo- controlled, dose -finding study 
to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of  a range of dose levels o f 
mRNA- 1325 Zika vaccine given in a 2-dose vaccination schedule, 
28 days apart, and compared with  placebo  in healthy adult subjects 
(18 to 49 years of age, i nclusive). mRNA -1325 is an mRNA -based 
vaccine candidate being tested for its ability to safely indu ce an 
immune response expected to be able to prevent ZikaV infection. 
ZikaV is a single -stranded  RNA flavivirus, which is transmitted to 
humans by a mosquito vector (mainly Aedes aegypti  but other Aedes  
mosquitoes are believed to be competent vectors) or by 
[CONTACT_9702] -to-person spread, mainly through sexual transmission. 
Document Number: VV-CLIN-000234 eDMS Version: 2.[ADDRESS_642338] tropi[INVESTIGATOR_499217].  
This is a 2 -part study. Part  A includes dose -finding, safety, and 
immune testing through 28 days following the second vaccination. 
Once subjects complete the final visit in Part  A, they will be entered 
into Part  B. Part  B is a blind ed follow -up period with assessment of 
safety through 12 mont hs and immune persistence at 168 (±15) days 
and 364 (+15) days following the second vaccination in Part  A. 
Immune persistence at 168 days and 364 days will be evaluated if 
interim immunogenicity analyses  warrants long term analyses of 
persistence.  
Part A  
Subjects will be randomly assigned in a blinded fashion in a n 
approximate 4:1 ratio to receive mRNA-1325 or placebo at 1 of 3 dose 
levels ( 10 µg, 25 µg, or 100 µg), with each subject receiving 
2 vaccinations separated by 28  (+7)  days. Dosing will begin with 
10 µg (Cohort  2), followed by 25 µg (Cohort  3), and then 100 µg 
(Cohort 4). There will be no Cohort [ADDRESS_642339] 20 years by [CONTACT_5640]: a) military assignment in the previous 
20 years that requires a yellow fever vaccination; or 2) yellow fever 
vaccination documented on an international certificate or other

reactogenicity (Section 3.5.6) and safety laboratory results, prior to 
randomizing the remainder of the cohort. An internal safety team 
(IST) will oversee the safety of the trial and will review blinded safety 
data during Part A of the study to ensure  adherence to the protocol, 
monitor safety laboratory  test results  and reactogenicity , and raise 
concerns to the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) should there be safety issues or operational challenges that could affect subject safety. Only after review b

(reactogenicity, safety labs , and AEs) through [ADDRESS_642341] 
vaccination of the sentinel safety lead -in for each cohort planned will 
approval be given to allow randomization of the remainder of that cohort. The SMC will approve escalation to the next higher dosing 
cohort after review of blinded safet y data of the currently dosed  
cohort through 7 days following the second vaccination and any cumulative safety data of all cohorts as the trial advances. The SMC will also be convened (ad hoc meeting) if a pause rule is triggered.

Note : The SMC will approve escalation to the next higher dosing cohort after review of 
blinded safety data of the currently dosed cohort through 7 days following the second 
vaccination and any cumulative safety data of all cohorts as the trial advances.  
The v accine will be administered as an intramuscular (IM) injection 
(0.5 mL) into the deltoid muscle as a 2 -dose vaccination schedule at 
Visits  1 and 4 (at least a 28 -day interval between dosing). The second 
dose of study drug will be administered preferably in the same arm 
used for the first dose. Vaccine accountability, dose preparation, and 
vaccine administration will be performed by [CONTACT_499233] , who will not participate in any other aspect of the study. 
The remainder of the site staff and all subjects will remain blinded to treatment assignment.

 Page 11 Screening and consent will occur over a 28- day period before 
randomization ( West N ile virus ser ology screen can occur up to 
90 days prior to randomization). A total of 30 subjects for each dos e 
cohort will be assigned, 24 subjects to mRNA -1325 and 6 subjects to 
placebo ( approximate 4:1 ratio overall). The first [ADDRESS_642342] a blood 
pressure, heart rate or respi[INVESTIGATOR_499219] 2 or greater (even after relaxing/resting) in the clinic on the day of vaccination should not receive a vaccination on that day and will need to return on a subsequent day for their vaccination. Similarly, if a subject has a fever 
(>37.9°C ) or an in tercurrent illness , vaccination should be withheld 
until resolved (as specified in exclusion criterion 20). Each subject will 
be monitored in the clinic for at least [ADDRESS_642343] toxicity recording will be entered into the electronic case 
report form.  
Subjects will be instructed on recording reactogenicity, adverse events (AEs), and medications (prescription or over -the-
counter) on the 
memory aid (ie, diary card), and will be provided measuring tools, and instructed to call or return to the clinic within [ADDRESS_642344] 7  days 
following each vaccination to answer any questions and ensure that the memory aid is being completed correctly  and consistently . All 
subjects will return on 7  (+3) (cellular  PBMC testing ) and 28 (+7) 
(humoral neutralization testing ) days following each vaccination for 
safety assessments and blood sampling for immune testing. 
Safety assessments will include monitoring and recording of soli cited 
(local and systemic reactogenicity) events (first 7 days after each 
vaccination); clinical laboratory test results including hematology, 
serum chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis; vital sign measurements; 
and physical examination findings ( Day 7 after each vaccination) and 
unsolicited AEs (throughout Part  A). All unsolicited AEs and 
concomitant medication (including over the counter) usage will be 
collected.  Specific categories of safety data collected will include  
serious adverse events (SAEs), AEs of special interest (AESIs),  AEs 
leading to study withdrawal, and medically attended AEs. At clinic 
visits, the investigator will review, confirm, and grade the

 Page 12 reactogenicity recorded in the memory aid and inquire about and 
review AEs and medications.  
All safety laboratory tests will be performed according to Table  6-1. 
Safety laboratory tests will be performed during Screening (to allow 
for assessm ent of inclusion and exclusion criteria), on the day of first 
vaccination  (Visit 1) , 7 (+3) days following each vaccination (Visit 2 
and Visit  5), and 28 (+7) days following each vaccination (Visit 4 
[prior to second vaccination] and Visit  7). At 17  (±3) days following 
each vaccination  (Visit 3 and Visit 6) and at 21 ( +3) days after the first 
vaccination (Visit 3a) for the sentinel  subjects , a subset of safety 
laboratory tests will be performed as specified in Table  6-1. Blood test 
results  (pre-vaccination)  at Visit 1 will be the basis for evaluation of 
changes from Baseline after vaccination.  
Blood samples for immunogenicity assessments (cellular and 
humora l) will be collected the day of vaccination (before vaccination) 
and 7 (+3)  and 28 (+7) days , respectively,  following each vaccination. 
Subjects that miss the second vaccination due to noncompliance with the visit schedule and not due to a cohort pause will still be required 
to follow the original visit and testing schedule. These subjects will be 
asked to  undergo blood collection to comply with a second immune 
test at Visit 7 ( 56+[ADDRESS_642345] vaccination ). 
To allow cohort advancement, the f
ollowing data from the highest 
dosed cohort is expected to be reviewed by [CONTACT_4484]: 1)  toxicity 
scoring of safety laboratory test results through 7  days following the 
second vaccination (through Visit 5); 2) toxicity scoring of vital signs 
and reactogenicit y through [ADDRESS_642346] and second 
vaccination (through Visit  5); 3) all unsolicited AEs (with grading and 
relatedness ). Data will be prepared  by [CONTACT_499234] y and timing 
relative to the last vaccination. As safety data on all cohorts 
accumulate, the SMC will also  review ongoing AEs as well as 
cumulative safety laboratory test results, reactogenicity, and AEs 
across vaccine doses for  subjects remain ing in Part  A of the study, 
thereby [CONTACT_1541] a cumulative and comprehensive review of safety. Should a cohort pause occur due to pre -specified criteria, the SMC will 
be convened for an unscheduled (ad hoc) meeting and be provided with specific safety data related to the trigger of the pause.  
Part A is concluded for each subject at  the time when they return to the 
clinic for Visit 7 (28 days following the second vaccination). At that 
time, a subject will be entered into Part B of the study. Once query resolution and immune testing is completed for each cohort in Part A, the database will be locked. Results will be provided to the Sponsor, 
SMC, and IST. The Sponsor may determine whether dosing 
Document Number: VV-CLIN-000234 eDMS Version: 2.[ADDRESS_642347] -level individual treatment assignment will not be released  to 
the subjects or to those individuals involved in manag ing or assessing 
safety in Part  B of the study until that portion of the study is completed. 
 Part B  – [ADDRESS_642348] will be entered into a continued blinded follow -up period 
(Part  B). This period will be conducted such that subjects, observers, 
and safety monitors will remain blinded to treatment assignment. 
Part B of the study is initiated for  a subject once they have returned for 
Visit 7 (28 days following the second vaccination). The safety 
database utilized for Part  B may be accessed by [CONTACT_499235] a given vaccine candidate as well as for the 
mRNA platform technology.  
Once entered into Part  B, each safety contact [CONTACT_499236] (eg, telephone, text  message, internet) every 
28 (±7) days, and blood samples for immune persistence will  be 
collected from each subject at 168 (±15) days and 364 (+15) days 
following the second vaccination. Immune persistence at [ADDRESS_642349] (approximately [ADDRESS_642350] vaccination), immune testing is completed, and all queries resolved, the database will be locked and analyzed with a final  clinical study  report pro vided to regulators.

vaccination [Visits  4 and 7, respectively])  in the 
flavivirus-seropositive group  
• T-cell response (cytokine activation  to IFN γ or other cytokines) 
(Baseline [ pre-vaccination at Visit 1] and at 7 days fo llowing each 
vaccination [Visits  2 and 5, respectively]) , if results of interim  
immunogenicity analyses  warrant further analyses of samples.  
Part  B 
Immunogenicity Testing:  • Neutr alizing serum antibody titer s (PRNT50) to Zika viru s at 
168 (±15) days and 364 (+ 15) days ( Visits  12 and 19, respectively)  
following the second vaccination will be evaluated if interim 
immunogenicity analyses  
warrants long term analyses of 
persistence.  
Study Drug, Dosage, and Route of Administration:  10-, 25- , or 100- µg mRNA -1325 or placebo (0.9% Sodium Chloride 
Injection, USP or BP) will be prepared as outlined in the pharmacy manual and administered via IM injection (0.5 mL) into the deltoid muscle on designated vaccination days. The second dose of study drug will be adminis tered preferably in the same arm used for the first dose.  
Sample Size:  Approximately 90 subjects are planned to be 
randomly assigned to

1.1 Background  
Zika virus ( ZikaV ) is a single -stranded  RNA flavivirus, which is transmitted to humans by a 
mosquito vector (mainly Aedes aegypti  but other Aedes  mosquitoes are believed to be 
competent vectors) or by [CONTACT_9702]- to-person spread, mainly through sexual transmission. ZikaV  
has been found in blood and other body fluids (saliva, urine, semen) in which it can persist 
longer than in the blood ( Franca et al 2016 ). Due to the common vector, ZikaV  has a similar 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_499221].  Most infections are either 
asymptomatic or result in a mild febrile illness with a ras h. However, infection with ZikaV  is 
also causally associated with Guillain -Barré syndrome neuropathy and other neurological 
sequelae in infected adults as well as congenital malformation of  the brain (eg,  microcephaly, 
ventricular calcifications) and other  severe impairments (eg, intrauterine growth restriction) in 
infants born to mothers infected early in the pregnancy ( Brasil et al  2016).  
Currently there is no vaccine to protect against  this disease, which has spread rapi[INVESTIGATOR_499222]. The Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) has listed Zika V as a Level  1 alert  (Brann 2016) . The World 
Health Organization (WHO) has declared ZikaV  to be a global public health emergency and 
has initia ted a strategic framework to aid in rapid response ( WHO, 2016a ). 
Moderna Therapeutics, Inc. has developed a proprietary messenger RNA ( mRNA)- based 
vaccine platform. This is based on the principle and observations that antigens can be produced 
in vivo by [CONTACT_289616]. The mRNA then 
undergoes intracellular ribosomal translation to endogenously express the protein antigen(s) encoded by [CONTACT_499246]. This mRNA -based vaccine does not enter the cellular nucleus 
or interact with the genome, is non- replicating, and expression is transient. mRNA vaccines 
thereby [CONTACT_394409] a mechanism to stimulate endogenous production of structurally intact protein 
antigens in a way that mimics wild type viral infection  and is able to induce highly targeted 
immune responses against infectious pathogens such as ZikaV . 
mRNA-1325 is a n mRNA-based vaccine candidate being tested for its ability to safely induce 
an immune response with the intention to be able to prevent ZikaV  infection .

Therapeutics, Inc. has demonstrated that transfection of mRNA -[ADDRESS_642375] non- human primates from ZikaV  
(Larocca et al 2016 ). 
1.2.2 Distribution  
A branched DNA hybridization assay was developed for the quantification of mRNA in the 
plasma and tissues. This assay has been used successfully for detection of mRNA from another 
closely related influenza mRNA vaccine (VAL -506440 encoding the HA antigen from the 
H10N8 influenza strain). This assay provides excellent sensitivity (5 -fg mRNA in 100- μg 
tissue) and specificity (200 t o 400 base fragment of the mRNA with multiple probes) with a 
reasonable dynamic range (3 -4 orders of magnitude). 
A study describing lipid nanoparticle (LNP) distribution in tissues after extravascular 
(intradermal and intramuscular [IM]) administration ind icated that the bulk of the dosed 
mRNA-[ADDRESS_642376] article stayed near the site of administration (injection). It is highly 
improbable that a physiological mechanism exists that is capable of dramatic alteration of tissue distribution in closely related rode nt species (rat vs mouse). With this consideration, 
Moderna Therapeutics, Inc. believes that the data obtained for mice are relevant to rats as well.  
1.2.[ADDRESS_642377] to the safety of the novel excipi [INVESTIGATOR_499223] ( DLin -MC3 -DMA [ MC3 ] and PEG 2000- DMG), additional genetic toxicology 
studies consistent with International Council for Harmonisation  (ICH) S2 R1 have been 
completed and include in vitro and in vivo genetic toxicology assessments. In support of development of mRNA -1325, the in vivo component of this assessment was performed with a 
fully formulated, identical LNP -mRNA drug product containing a different mRNA sequence,

 Page 28 VA L -506440. The full results of these repeat -dose toxicity and genetic toxicology studies are 
provided in the investigator’s brochure. 
1.2.4 Genotoxicity  
mRNA-1325 is composed of not only mRNA, but also LNP components , cholesterol , 
1,2-Distearoyl -sn-glycero -3-phosphocholine (DSPC) , MC3, and PEG2000 -DMG. Cholesterol 
and DSPC represent commonly used lipid excipi[INVESTIGATOR_499224]. In contrast, MC3 and PEG2000- DMG represent novel lipi[INVESTIGATOR_499225] (FDA). MC3 is a custom -
manufactured, novel ionizable lipid that complexes with the active ingredient (mRNA) to form 
the LNP, while the 3 other commercial lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (cholesterol, DSPC, and PEG2000- DMG) 
contribute to the overall pharmaceutical properties of the LNP. This type of lipid vehicle 
composition is currently in late -phase clinical studies conducted by [CONTACT_499248] (IV)  infusion in patients 
suffering from transthyretin amyloidosis, and was shown to be well -tolerated in this population 
(Coelho et al 2013). Over [ADDRESS_642378], Moderna 
Therapeutics, Inc. contends that additional new genetic toxicity studies with mRNA -1325 or 
the same component lipi[INVESTIGATOR_499226]3 and PEG2000-DMG would not be informative. 
Moderna Therapeutics, Inc. has proposed completion of a Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) rat 
developmental and reproductive toxicology study, which will assess female Sprague Dawley rats only dosed at the highest anticipated clinical dose level and will include a control arm. 
Further details on all non -clinical research on mRNA -1325 can be found in the investigator’ s 
brochure.

Document Number: VV-CLIN-000234 eDMS Version: 2.[ADDRESS_642380] yet been licensed for prophylaxis of ZikaV  infection . Of the approaches 
currently in development, the VLP and live attenuated vaccines ( Akahata et al 2010 ; Darwin 
et al 2011 ; Wang et al 2008; Brandler et al 2013 ) show the greatest pre -clinical potential. 
However, both are expected to be more complex, costly,  and longer to develop  and scale-up 
than mRNA due  to the need to establish, optimize , and characterize vaccine specific growth 
substrates, formulations , and dedicated production facilities. In addition, live attenuated 
vaccines, such as yellow fever vaccines , pose the risk of recombination with circulati ng wild 
type flaviviruses, reversion to pathogenicity , and vaccine -virus associated disease, particularly 
in immunocompromised populations. The Sponsor believes that on the basis of pre -clinical 
data with this and other vaccines in the Moderna Therapeutics , Inc. development pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189], 
mRNA-[ADDRESS_642381] -in-human, randomized, placebo -controlled, dose -ranging , 
study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of mRNA-1325 in healthy adult subjects  in 
a non- endemic region . The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety profile of 
mRNA-1325 compared with placebo. The  study will also evaluate immunogenicity by 
[CONTACT_499249] -specific neutralizing antibody titers. The safety 
profile and immune response(s) will be compared between flavi virus- seropositive and 
flavivirus- seronegative subjects to i ndicate the ability of the selected dose to safely protect 
populations in both endemic and non- endemic regions. 
1.5 Rationale for Dose Selection  
Dosing will begin with 10 µg (Cohort  2), followed by 25 µg (Cohort  3), and then 100 µg 
(Cohort 4). There will be no Cohort [ADDRESS_642382] level (NOAEL) was established as 50 μ g for repeated IM dosing 
in the rat. This supports the starting dose of 10 µg in this study .  
In an ongoing clinical study with the Moderna mRNA H10N8 influenza vaccine, which utilizes  
the same the lipid composition as mRNA -1325, the tolerability profile of the vaccine 
administered according to a 2-dose vaccination  schedule in a dose range of 25 µg to 100 µg 
Document Number: VV-CLIN-000234 eDMS Version: 2.[ADDRESS_642383] immune response. According  to Bahl  and 
colleagues ( Bahl et al 2017) , the majority of solicited AEs repor ted in the 100- µg group were 
mild (107/163 events; 66%) or moderate (52/163 events; 32%). The majority of events were 
injection site pain, myalgia, headache, fatigue, and chills/common- cold-like symptoms. Only 
4 events (2.5%), reported by 3 subjects, were categorized as severe and included injection site 
erythema ( 1.2% ), injection site induration ( 0.6%), and chills/common cold (0.6%). No related 
SAEs occurred in the study.  
In order to inform dose choices in this study, Moderna performed a group unblinding analysis 
of immunogenicity data from the first dose cohort (ie, Cohort 2: 10 µg of mRNA -1325). The 
analysis confirmed that the vaccine is able to induce neutralizing antibodies against Zika virus in both flavivirus -seronegative and flavivirus -seropositive subjects. Follo wing review of the 
immunogenicity results from this cohort and consider ing the variability of the serological assay 
and the biological variability of the immune response , Moderna decided to increase the dose 
for Cohort [ADDRESS_642384] the 
optimal dose of mRNA-1325 for further development  in both endemic and non- endemic 
populations. Pre-clinical and clinical data support the expectation that a 2 -dose vaccination 
schedule, 1 month apart, will induce a protective immune response. This 2 -dose schedule will 
be explored at a  range of doses in 2 subpopulations: Non-endemic populations are represented 
by [CONTACT_499250].  This is confirmed through a baseline West Nile serology screening test, which if 
negative, excludes the most prevalent  flavivirus infection in the [LOCATION_002] . Cross-reactivity 
of this test with other flaviviruses will establish a high certainty of baseline flavivirus na ïvety 
in this population. In addition, a proportion of subjects will be recruited who  have received a 
flavivirus vaccination  (yellow fever) within the preceding 20 years in order to assess the safety 
and immunogenicity profile in a homogeneous flavivirus -seropositive population in order to 
represent an endemic population.

to [ADDRESS_642385] vaccination, with review of rea ctogenicity (Section 3.5.6) and safety laboratory results, 
prior to randomizing the remainder of the cohort. In addition, pause rules have been 
pre-established to trigger ad hoc SMC reviews , if required , and an internal safety team (IST) 
will review (blinded review) clinically significant safety laboratory test results, vital sign 
measurements, reactogenicity, and any AEs (all with toxicity scoring/grading) during the active vaccination phase of the trial.  
Immunogenicity will be assessed on the day of vaccination (before vaccination) and 
7 (+3) (cellular) and 28 (+ 7) (humoral) days following each vaccination. Longer- term safety 
and immune persistence  will be monitor ed for at least 1  year in a blinded follow -up period 
(Part  B). Immune persistence at 168 days and 364 days will be evaluated if interim 
immunogenicity analyses  warrants long term analyses of persistence. Data will be encoded 
into a safety database that wil l capture long -term safety across multiple Phase 1 (and possibly 
Phase 2) studies for this proprietary mRNA vaccine technology to allow safety to be monitored at the mRNA platform level.

3.1 Study Design  
This is a Phase 1, double -blind, placebo- controlled, dose -finding study to evaluate the safety 
and immunogenicity of a range of dose levels of mRNA -1325 Zika vaccine given in a 2 -dose 
vaccination schedule, 28 days apart, and compared with  placebo in healthy adult subjects (18 
to 49 years of age, inclusive). mRNA -1325 is an mRNA -based vaccine candidate being tested 
for its ability to safely induce an immune response able to prevent ZikaV infection. 
ZikaV is a single -stranded  RNA flavivirus, which is transmitted to humans by a mosquito 
vector (mainly Aedes aegypti  but other Aedes  mosquitoes are believed to be competent vectors) 
or by [CONTACT_9702] -to-person spread, mainly through sexual transmis sion. Currently there is no 
vaccine to protect against this disease, which has spread rapi[INVESTIGATOR_499227]. 
This is a 2 -part study. Part  A includes dose -finding, safety, and immune testing through 28 days 
following the second vaccination. Once subjects complete the final visit in Part  A, they will be 
entered into Part  B. Part  B is a blinded follow -up period with assessment of safety through 
12 months and immune persistence at 168 (±15) days and 364 (+15) days following the second 
vaccination in Part  A. Immune persistence at 168 days and 364 days will be evaluated if interim 
immunogenicity analyses  warrants long term analyses of persistence.  
 Part A  
Subjects will be randomly assigned in a blinded fashion in a n approximate 4:1 ratio to receive 
mRNA-1325 or placebo  at 1 of 3 dose levels ( 10 µg, 25 µg, or 100 µg), with each subject 
receiving 2  vaccinations separated by 28  (+7)  days. Dosing will begin with 10 µg (Cohort  2), 
followed by 25 µg (Cohort  3), and then 100 µg (Cohort  4). There will be no Cohort [ADDRESS_642387] 20 years by [CONTACT_5640]: a) military

The vaccine will be administered as an IM injection (0.5  mL) into the deltoid muscle as a 
2-dose vaccination schedule at Visits  1 and 4 (at least a 28 -day interval between dosing). The 
second dose of study drug will be administered preferably in the same arm used for the first 
dose. Vaccine accountability, dose preparation, and vaccine administration will be performed 
by [CONTACT_499252], who will not participate in any other aspect of the study. The remainder of the site staff and all subjects will remain blinded to treatment assignment.  
Screening and consent will occur over a 28- day period before randomization (W est Nile virus 
serology screen can occur up to 90 days prior to randomization). A total of 30 subjects for each 
dose cohort will be assigned, 24 subjects to mRNA -1325 and 6 subjects to placebo 
(approximate 4:1 ratio overall). The first [ADDRESS_642390] a blood 
pressure, heart rate or respi[INVESTIGATOR_499219] 2  or greater  (even after relaxing/resting) in 
the clinic on the day of vaccination should not receive a vaccination on that day and will need to return on a subsequent day for their vaccination. Similarly, if a subject has a fever (>37.9° C) 
or an inter current illness , vaccination should be withheld until resolved (as specified in 
exclusion criterion 20). Each subject will be monitored in the clinic for at least 1  hour following 
vaccination to assess for immediate reactogenicity, with vital sign measurements and local and 
Document Number: VV-CLIN-000234 eDMS Version: 2.[ADDRESS_642391] toxicity recordin g will be 
entered into the electronic case report form  (eCRF) . 
Subjects will be instructed on recording reactogenicity, AEs, and medications (prescription or 
over-the- counter) on the memory aid (ie, diary card), and will be provided measuring tools, 
and instructed to call or return to the clinic within [ADDRESS_642392] 7  days 
following each vaccination to answer any questions and ensure that the memory aid is being completed correctly  and consistently . All subjects will return on 7  (+3) (cellular PBMC testing) 
and 28 (+7) (humoral neutralization testing) days following each vaccination for safety assessments and blood sampling for immune testing. 
Safety assessments will include monitoring and recording of solicited (local and systemic 
reactogenicity) events (first 7 days after each vaccination); clinical laborat ory test results 
including hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis; vital sign measurements; and physical examination findings ( Day 7 after each vaccination) and u nsolicited AEs 
(throughout Part  A). All unsolicited AEs and concomitant medication (including over the 
counter) usage will be collected. Specific categories of safety data collected will include SAEs, 
AEs of special interest (AESIs), AEs leading to study withdrawal, and medically attended AEs. 
At clinic visits, the investigato r will review, confirm, and grade the reactogenicity recorded in 
the memory aid and inquire about and review AEs and medications.  
All safety laboratory tests will be performed according to Table  6-1. Safety laboratory  tests 
will be performed during Screening (to allow for assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria), on the day of first vaccination (Visit 1) , 7 (+3)  days following each vaccination  
(Visit 2 and Visit  5), and 28 ( +7) days following each vaccination (Visit 4 [prior to second 
vaccination] and Visit  7). At 17  (±3) days following each vaccination (Visit 3 and Visit 6) and 
at 21 [+3] days after the first vaccination (Visit 3a) for the sentinel subjects , a subset of safety 
laboratory tests will be performed as specified in Table  6-1. Blood test results (pre-vaccination) 
at Visit 1 wi ll be the basis for evaluation of changes from Baseline after vaccination.  
Blood samples for immunogenicity assessments (cellular and humoral) will be collected the day of vaccination (before vaccination) and 7 (+3) and 28 (+7) days , respectively,  followin g 
each vaccination. Subjects that miss the second vaccination due to noncompliance with the visit schedule and not due to a cohort pause will still be required to follow the original visit 
Document Number: VV-CLIN-000234 eDMS Version: 2.[ADDRESS_642393] at Visit 7 (56+[ADDRESS_642394] vaccination). 
To allow cohort advancement, the following data from the highest dosed cohort is expected to 
be reviewed by [CONTACT_4484]:  1) toxicity scoring of safety laboratory test results through 7 days 
following the second vaccination (through Visit 5); 2) toxicity scoring of vital signs and 
reactogenicity through [ADDRESS_642395] and second vaccination (through Visit 5); 
3) all unsolicited AEs (with grading and relatedness ). Data will be prepared  by [CONTACT_499253]. As safety data on all cohorts accumulate, the SMC 
also review ongoing AEs as well as cumulative safety laboratory test results, reactogenicity, 
and AEs across vaccine doses for subjects remain ing in Part  A of the study, thereby [CONTACT_1541] 
a cumulative and comprehensive r eview of safety. Should a cohort pause occur due to 
pre-specified criteria, the SMC will be convened for an unscheduled (ad hoc) meeting and be 
provided with specific safety data related to the trigger of the pause.  
Part A is concluded for each subject at the time when they return to the clinic for Visit 7 
(28 days following the second vaccination). At that ti me, a subject will be entered into Part  B 
of the study. Once query resolution and immune testing is completed for each cohort in Part  A, 
the database will be locked. Results will be provided to the Sponsor, SMC, and IST. The Sponsor may determine whether dosing adjustments are required  during the conduct of the 
study based on either safety or immune responses per cohort. As dose escalation occurs, cumulative analyses will be included for each subsequent data lock to allow for all prior dosing 
cohorts to be  analyzed by [CONTACT_9084], treatment assignment, and in aggregate for mRNA -[ADDRESS_642396] -level  individual treatment assignment will not be released to the subjects or 
to those individuals involved in manag ing or assessing safety in Part  B of the study until that 
portion of the study is completed. 
The full schedule of events for Part  A is shown in Table  6-1. 
Part B – [ADDRESS_642397] will be entered into a 
continued, blinded follow -up period (Part  B). This period will be conducted such that subjects, 
observers, and safety monitors will remain blinded to trea tment assignment. Part B of the study 
is initiated for a subject once they have returned for Visit 7 (28 days following the second 
vaccination). The safety database utilized for Part  B may be accessed by [CONTACT_499254]: VV-CLIN-000234 eDMS Version: 2.[ADDRESS_642398] will occur by [CONTACT_144891] (eg, telephone, text  
message, internet) every 28 (±7) days, and blood samples for immune persistence will be 
collected from each subject at 168 (±15) days and 364 (+ 15) days following the second 
vaccination.  Immune persistence at [ADDRESS_642399] (approximately  [ADDRESS_642400] 
vaccination), immune testing is completed, and all queries resolved, the database will be locked 
and analyzed with a final  clinical study  report provided to regulators.

in an approximate 4:1 ratio to mRNA -1325 or placebo at 1 of 3 dose levels ( 10 µg, 25 µg, or 
100 µg). The first [ADDRESS_642429] 20 years.  
3.4.2 Treatments Administered  
Dosing will begin with 10- µg mRNA-1325 or placebo (Cohort  2), followed by 
25-µg mRNA- 1325 or placebo (Cohort  3), and then 100- µg mRNA-1325 or placebo 
(Cohort 4).  The rationale for dose selection is described in Section  1.5. Dosing c ohorts will 
advance as described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Vaccine will be administered as an IM injection (0.5  mL) into the deltoid muscle as a 2 -dose 
vaccination schedule at Visits  1 and 4 (at least a 28 -day interval between dosing) . The second 
dose of study drug will be administered preferably in the same arm used for the first dose. 
The clinic will be appropriately staffed, trained on emergency resuscitation, and have stocked 
available rescue medications (such as epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], steroids, antihistamines, and IV fluids) 
should any severe reaction (eg, anaphylaxis or profound urticaria) occur that requires 
immediate intervention.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Dose Escalation  
Internal Safety Team  
An IST will oversee the safety of the trial and will review blinded safety data during Part  A of 
the study to ensure adherence to the protocol, monitor safety laboratory test results and 
reactogenicity,  and raise concerns to the SMC should there be safety issues or operational 
challenges that could affect subject safety. Pause rules have been pre -established to trigger ad 
hoc SMC reviews, if required ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), and the IST will review (blinded review) safety 
Document Number: VV-CLIN-000234 eDMS Version: 2.[ADDRESS_642430] results, vital sign measurements, reactogenicity, and any AEs (all with toxicity 
scoring/grading) during the active vaccination phase of the trial. In addition, recruitment rates, 
timing of vaccination sequence , and window adherence will be reported to the IST. The 
chairperson of the IST may request that additional data be provided to the SMC that relates to 
the safety of subjects (eg, study conduct, quality issues, or safety concerns). 
At minimum, the IST will be composed of the Sponsor ’s study medical monitor  lead, the 
contract research organization’s medical monitor , and the principal investigator (s). The 
medical monitor  will oversee safety aspects of the study  and will participate as needed . 
Additional ad hoc mem bers may be included as needed.  
Safety Monitoring Committee 
The SMC will review data for dose escalation w hen at least 90% of subjects dosed (eg, ≥27 
out of 30 subjects) in Cohort  2 (10-µg mRNA -1325 or placebo) have safety data inclusive of 
their visit 7  days following the second vaccination ( Visit 5). Once a recommendation is given 
by [CONTACT_4484], the Sponsor will approve advancing to Cohort  3 (25- µg mRNA -1325 or placebo). 
Cohort 4 ( 100-µg mRNA -1325 or placebo) will be randomized following SMC review and 
Sponsor approval of Cohort  3 (data inclusive of 7 days following the second vaccination of 
≥90% of subjects dosed [eg, ≥27 out of 30 subjects] ). 
To allow cohort advancement, the following data from the highest dosed cohort is expected to 
be reviewed by [CONTACT_4484]: 1)  toxicity scoring of safety laboratory test results through 7 days 
following the second vaccination (through Visit 5); 2) toxicity scoring of vital sign 
measurements  and reactogenicity th rough [ADDRESS_642431] and second vaccination 
(through Visit 5); 3) all unsolicited AEs (with grading and relatedness ). Data will be prepared  
by [CONTACT_499260]. As safety data on all cohorts 
accumulate, the SMC will include in their review ongoing AEs as well as cumulative safety 
laboratory test results, reactogenicity, and AEs across vaccine doses as long as subjects remain 
in Part  A of the study, thereby [CONTACT_1541] a cumulative review of safety. Should a coh ort pause 
occur due to pre -specified criteria ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS]), the SMC will be convened for an 
unscheduled (ad hoc) meeting and receive specific s afety data related to the trigger of the pause.  
The SMC may recommend advancement to the next dosing cohort, request additional 
information prior to providing a recommendation, recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098], recommend changes to study conduct and/or the protocol, or recommend additional operational 
Document Number: VV-CLIN-000234 eDMS Version: 2.[ADDRESS_642432]. The Sponsor has the 
authority to accept (or amend) the SMC recommendations, to stop the study at any time, to 
request a cohort pause for safety concerns (to be addressed by [CONTACT_4484]), and to request 
additional consultation during study conduct for either safety concerns or operational issues. The SMC will also be convened should a pause rule be triggered or at the request of the IST, 
the investigator(s), or the Sponsor. 
The SMC will be comprised of 3 voting and independent members who are medical doctors 
familiar with Phase 1 clinical trial and safety review and independent from the trial. In addition, a biostatistician not associat ed with the trial will prepare the safety data  (non- voting member) , 
and a coordinator not associated with the trial will organize and record decisions of the SMC  
(non- voting member). The SMC may decide to include a non- medical person to weigh in on 
ethical  issues if the need arises.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pause Rules  
During the active vaccination period, if any of the following events occur and are assessed to be potentially mRNA-1325 related, the cohort will be paused for further enrollment and 
vaccination, and an unscheduled S MC will be convened to assess specific data concerns and 
make recommendations: 
• Two or more Grade 3 (or greater)  reactogenicity events (whether systemic or local) within 
a dose cohort following any single (eg,  the first, the second) vaccination  
• Two or more Grade 3 (or greater) same laboratory toxicity score within a dose cohort 
• One or more SAEs assessed as vaccine related, including any systemic hypersensitivity 
reaction  
An unscheduled SMC may also be convened (with vaccination pausing if deemed necessary), 
by [CONTACT_093], IST, or Sponsor, if any other significant safety or tolerability issues are identified in the comprehensive review of available data that warrant further evaluation before additional subjects are dosed. This may include emerging non- clinical data, clinically relevant 
AEs, or relevant data from other sources indicating safety concerns even if the event(s) per se does not meet the criteria specified in this section.  
Document Number: VV-CLIN-000234 eDMS Version: 2.[ADDRESS_642433]’s visits will  continue until the next 
scheduled vaccination visit. Should a pause affect a subject’s vaccination visit, then the 
window for that subject’s vaccination visit will be suspended until the pause is lifted and vaccination can resume. Once the pause is lifted  at the site, vaccination should be reinstated as 
soon as possible. Visits should thereafter be scheduled as if they had received their second 
vaccination within the 28 (+7) day time window. 
Should a pause be prolonged such that the second vaccination takes place outside the 
28 (+7)  day time window, the S ponsor has the option to add additional subjects in a dosing 
cohort to achieve the original number of subjects planned to be dosed within the 28 (+7)  day 
time window. If a subject is in the screening period for more than [ADDRESS_642434] dosing due to the observed immune response or a change in the perceived 
benefit:risk ratio. However, treatment assignment will not be released to the subjects or to those individuals involved in managing or assessing safety in Part B of the  study until Part B of the 
study is completed.

The mRNA-1325 I njection consists of the mRNA drug substance, mRNA-1325, which 
encodes the ZikaV  prME polypeptide, in an LNP formulation intended for IM injection.  
The mRNA-1325 LNP formulation includes 4 lipid excipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]: MC3, an ionizable amino lipid 
(Jayaraman et al 2012 ), and the commercially available lipi[INVESTIGATOR_499229], DSPC, and 
PEG2000DMG ( Mui et al 2013), at a molar ratio of 50:38.5:10:1.5 for 
MC3:cholesterol:DSPC:PEG 2000- DMG. At pH below 6, the MC3 lipid is positively charged 
and binds to the negatively charged mRNA, thereby [CONTACT_499261]/lipid complexes. Cholesterol is incorporated to provide structure and physicochemical stability to the par ticles. The neutral “helper” lipid, DSPC, is incorporated in order to increase 
the fusogenic properties of the particles. The polyethylene glycol lipid conjugate PEG2000-
DMG confers surface stabilization to the nanoparticles. The drug product formulation 
comprises 1.3 mg/mL m RNA-1325 drug substance and 26 mg/mL total lipid concentration.

freezer. The freezers must be connected to a  back -up generator. The pharmacy must have in 
place a 24 -hour alert system that allows for rapid response in case of freezer malfunctioning. 
In addition, drug accountability study personnel (eg, the unblinded pharmacy staff) are required 
to keep a temperature log to establish a record of compliance with these stor age conditions. 
The placebo will be stored according to the instructions on the product label and must also comply with storage in a restricted access area. Only drug accountability ( eg, unblinded 
pharmacy staff) should have access to the products used in this study.  
The site is responsible for report ing any mRNA -1325 Injection  that was not temperature 
controlled during shipment or during storage to the unblinded site (pharmacy) monitor. Such 
mRNA-1325 will be retained for inspection by [CONTACT_499263].

It is the investigator’s responsibility that the unblinded pharmacy personnel maintain accurate 
records of receipt of all  mRNA-[ADDRESS_642439] 
also be recorded. To satisfy regulatory requirements regarding drug accountability, all 
mRNA-1325 Injection  will be reconciled and retained until study conclusion. At that time, 
mRNA-1325 Injection  will be destroyed or returned to the Sponsor according to applicable 
regulations. 
3.4.5 Blinding  
This is an observer -blind study. The investigator, study subjects, site monitors, and study site 
personnel will be blinded to the study drug administered, with the following exceptions: 
• Unblinded pharmacy personnel (of limited number) will be assigned to drug accountability 
procedures and  to prepare and administer mRNA -1325 (or placebo) to all subjects. The 
designee(s) will have no other study functions than study drug management, 
documentation, accountability, preparation, and administration. They will not be involved 
in subject evaluatio ns and will not reveal the study drug identity to either the subject or the 
study site personnel involved in the conduct of the study, unless this information is necessary in the case of an emergency.  
• An unblinded study monitor, not involved in other aspec ts of monitoring, will be assigned 
as the drug accountability monitor. They will have responsibilities to ensure the site is 
following all proper drug accountability, preparation, and administration procedures. 
• An unblinded statistician will provide a desc riptive analysis of safety and immunological 
endpoints after the completion of each dosing cohort. The interim analyses of 
immunogenicity data will be performed as outlined in Section  3.6.7. 
The treatment assignment will be concealed by [CONTACT_499264](s) 
(eg, unblinded pharmacy staff) prepare the study drug in a secure location that is not accessible 
to other study personnel. The syringe used will maintain the blind at the time of vaccination 
(eg, a sleeve will be used should the vaccine substance be distinguishable in appearance 
between the mRNA-1325 and placebo). Only pharmacy staff will conduct the vaccination 
Document Number: VV-CLIN-000234 eDMS Version: 2.[ADDRESS_642440]’s treatment options. In the event of a medical emergency requiring identification of the study drug administered to an 
individual subject, the investigator will make every attempt to contact [CONTACT_499265] [ADDRESS_642441] observation of study site personnel and appropri ately recorded (date and time) i n the eCRF. S ite personnel will 
confirm that the subject has received the entire dose of study drug. If a subject does not receive 
study drug or does not receive all of the planned doses, the reason for the missed dose will be 
recorded.  
Subjects that miss the second vaccination due to noncompliance with the visit schedule and not due to a cohort pause will still be required to follow the original visit and testing schedule. 
These subjects will be asked to undergo blood collection to comply with a second immune test 
at Visit 7 (56+[ADDRESS_642442] vaccination). 
The study site is responsible for ensuring subjects comply with the study windows allowed. 
Should a subject miss a visit, every effort will be made to contact [CONTACT_474513] a 
visit within the defined v isit window. I f a subject exceeds their post- vaccination visit in excess 
of 28 days from the scheduled visit or misses a vaccination  schedule by [CONTACT_726] 28 days (eg,

Moderna Therapeutics , Inc. mRNA -1325  
Protocol mRNA -1325- P101  Clinical Study Protocol version 6.0  
 Page 53 28 days beyond the scheduled time of vaccination) , then that visit will be classified as  a missed 
visit and the subject will continue with subsequent visits  for Parts  A and B of the study . All 
safety requirements of the missed visit will be captured and included in the follow -up visit (eg, 
safety laboratory testing, memory aid  review for reac togenicity , immune testing, as applicable).  
3.4.8 Prior and  Concomitant  Medications 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Prior Medications and Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_76815] (including any prescription or over -the-counter 
medications, vaccines, or blood products) taken by [CONTACT_11766] 30 days before 
providing informed consent (or as designated in the inclusion/exclusion requirement s) will be 
recorded in the subject’s eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Concomitant Medications and Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_474459]  A of the study, concomitant medications include all medications (including  vaccination 
outside of trial) taken by [CONTACT_499266] (ICF) 
through 28 days after the second vaccination ( Visit  7) and will be recorded in the eCRF. In 
Part B, receipt of immunomodulators (including vaccines), immunosuppressants, or other 
concomitant medications that could potentially impact immune response will be collected through Visit 19. 
Subjects are prohibited from receiving immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 
3 months preceding the administration of the study drug or at any time during the study. Acetaminophen may be allowed a t the discretion of the investigator. A daily dose of ≤100 mg 
of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_474458] a physician is not a contraindication to enrollment. 
To allow accurate assessment of analgesic/antipyretic use during the 7 days after each 
vaccination, subjects will be inquired directly as to use (absent or present) and if used will be 
inquired for treatment or prophylaxis. 
Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 continuous days) of an immunosuppressant 
or other immune modifying drug within 6 months prior to vaccine administration or any such products during the active vaccination period (through [ADDRESS_642443] planned 
vaccination) is prohibited. An immunosuppressant dose of a glucocorticoid will be de fined as 
a systemic dose of ≥10  mg of prednisone per day or equivalent. The use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], inhaled, 
and nasal glucocorticoids will be permitted.  
Document Number: VV-CLIN-000234 eDMS Version: 2.[ADDRESS_642444] received (at any time) a vaccine for ZikaV  or 
dengue vaccine, any live attenuated vaccines within  4 weeks before enrollment, or inactive 
vaccines within 2 weeks before enrollment, or plan to receive any vaccine during the active 
vaccination period (through [ADDRESS_642445] planned vaccination). 
Concomitant medications (including vaccinations) will be coded using the WHO Drug 
Dictionary. If prohibited drug therapy is taken, a joint decision will be made by [CONTACT_499267], and whether the 
use of the medication will compromise the subject safety or interpretation of the data. It is the 
investigator’s responsibility to ensure that details regarding the concomitant medication are 
adequately recorded in the eCRF.  
3.[ADDRESS_642446] signs the ICF. 
The investigator will also sign the ICF. Subjects will undergo study procedures at the time points specified in the schedules of events ( Table  6-1 and  Table  6-2).  
At any time during the study a subject can be seen for an unscheduled visit. This may be prompted by [CONTACT_474516], reactogenicity issues, or new or ongoing AEs. The site also has the discretion to make reminder phone calls or text  messages to inform the 
subject on visits, request further laboratory assessments, review memory aid content 
requirements, and follow up on ongoing or outstanding issues . As standard practice, a reminder 
call will be made to the subject by [CONTACT_779] a t least once during the first 7 days following each 
vaccination to ensure that the memory aid is being completed correctly and consistently . 
Specific activities for each visit are outlined in Table  6-1 and Table  6-2 and may include the 
following: 
• Confirm subj ect identification  and conta ct information  
• Record vital sign s (toxicity scored) and p erform physical examination  
• Review memory aid

message, internet), and blood samples for immune persistence will be collected from each 
subject at the time points indicated in Table  6-2. 
Safety contacts must be performed by [CONTACT_474518]. If the initial contact 
[CONTACT_474519], the study site staff should make a total of [ADDRESS_642448] by [CONTACT_474520] (every 28  days  plus window allowance ).  
These contacts will follow a script, which will facilitate the collection of relevant safety 
information. Each safety contact [CONTACT_499268]. Additional data 
may be requested thr ough medically attended visits, and medications and vaccination will be 
recorded as part of the medical intake for each telemedicine visit. All safety information

collection of AE information from the subject; this information is subject to potential change based on further questioning and/or follow -up by [CONTACT_464]. Each subject will be instructed 
to complete a memory aid  to describe: 
• Solicited local and systemic AEs ( Section 3.5.6) occurring ( with appropriate 
documentation to allow severity  scoring by [CONTACT_093] ) during the day of each dose 
administration and for the following [ADDRESS_642450] temperature reading will be 
recorded.  
o For solicited local AEs that require measurement, the measurement of size will be 
performed using the ruler provided by [CONTACT_3452]. 
• All medications (excluding vitamins and minerals) taken durin g the day of each vaccine 
administration and for the following 28 days  
• Any unsolicited AE during the first [ADDRESS_642451]’s source documents and the eCRF. 
3.5.3 Immunogenicity  Assessments  
Blood samples for immunogenicity (cellular and humoral) assessment s will be collected at the 
time points indicated ( Table  6-1 and Table  6-2). Sample aliquots will be designed so as to 
ensure that back up samples are available and adequate vial volumes will allow for testing 
needs. The actual time and date of each sample collected will be recorded in the eCRF and 
unique sample identification will be utilized to maintain the blind at the laboratory at all times

Safety assessments will include monitoring and recording of solicited (local and  systemic 
reactogenicity events ) and unsolicited AEs ; SAEs, AESIs, AEs leading to study withdrawal, 
medically attended AEs, clinical laboratory test results including hematology, serum chemistry, 
coagulation, and urinalysis; vital sign measurements; and physical examination findings . 
3.5.6 Solicited Safety Measurements  
The term “reactogenicity” refers to selected signs and symptoms (AEs) occurring after dose 
administration, to be collected by [CONTACT_474523] [ADDRESS_642453] 7 days following vaccination.  
The following AEs are included in the memory aid : 
Solicited local AEs include:  
• injection site induration/swelling  
• injection site tenderness  
• injection site erythema/redness 
• injection site pain  
Solicited systemic  AEs include: 
• body temperature  (oral)  
• generalized myalgia (muscle ache or pain)  
• generalized arthralgia (joint ache or pain)  
• headache  
• fatigue/malaise  (unusual tiredness)

Protocol mRNA -1325- P101  Clinical Study Protocol version 6.0  
 Page 59 • nausea/vomiting  
• diarrhea  
The solicited AEs will be recorded daily by [CONTACT_499269]; where appropriate 
reactogenicity measurements will be taken using the tools provided (oral thermometer and 
measuring device). The investigator will later review, confirm, and grade reactogenicity, 
according to  the Guidance for Industry: Toxicity  Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and 
Adolescent V olunteers Enrolled in Preventative Vaccine Clinical Trials ( Center for Biologics 
Evaluation and Research [ CBER ] 2007; Table  6-3). If a solicited local or systemic AE 
continues beyond 7 days after dose administration, it will also be recorded as an AE in the 
eCRF from 8 days after vaccination until resolved or stable. 
Other solicited reactions: 
Use of anal gesics  and/or antipyretics will be recorded as absent or present, and it will be 
indicated if they were used for treatment or for prophylaxis. 
Solicited local and systemic AEs (including body temperature) will be collected using the 
memory aid  during the day of each dose administration and for the following [ADDRESS_642454] incidence of unsolicited AEs and any 
medication (prescription and over the counter) using the memory aid for 28 days after each 
vaccine administration.  
All AEs necessitating an un scheduled physician visit, medical attention, or leading to 
withdrawal from the study will also be collected throughout Part  A of the study, and all AEs 
will be monitored until resolution or, if the AE becomes chronic, a cause is identified. If an AE 
is unresolved at the conclusion of Part  A of the study, a clinical assessment will be made by 
[CONTACT_499270] -up of 
the AE is warranted . The relationship of the study drug to any AE and any SAE will be 
determined by [CONTACT_499271]. All AEs resulting in withdrawal of the 
subjects from the study will be documented in the source documents and in the eCRF. 
For Part  B of the study, a script will be utilize d to query for any new SAE s or AESI s, and 
proper documentation will be obtained to allow an assessment of relatedness to vaccination or 
study participation. All SAEs and AESIs will be followed to resolution, to chronic stable state, 
Document Number: VV-CLIN-000234 eDMS Version: 2.[ADDRESS_642455] visit for Part B occurs. At that time , any ongoing AEs will receive their 
final classification so that the safety database can be locked.  
A tabulation of all SAEs and AESIs , categorized by  [CONTACT_194682] (MedDRA) preferred terms and assessed relationship to study drug , will be 
performed.  
3.5.7 Unsolicited Safety Measurements  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for reporting all AEs that are observed or reported during the 
study, regardless of their relationship to study drug or their clinical significance. If there is any 
doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be reported.  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_642456] any AEs (solicited or unsolicited)  in the memory aid . 
A treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) is defined as any event not present before exposure to study 
drug or any event already present that worsens in intensity or frequency after exposure. 
A suspected adverse reaction  is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the study 
drug caused the AE. For the purposes of investigational new dr ug safety reporting, “reasonable 
possibility”  means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study 
drug and the AE. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about 
causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a study drug. An adverse 
reaction is any AE caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all suspected adverse 
reactions for which there are reasons to conclude that the drug caused the event.  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction  is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
investigator ’s brochure or at the specificity or severity that has been observed with the study 
drug being tested; or, if an investigator ’s brochure is not required or available, is not consistent 
with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the 
current application. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14213]) if the investigator ’s brochure referred only to elevated hepatic 
Document Number: VV-CLIN-000234 eDMS Version: 2.0
Moderna Therapeutics , Inc. mRNA -1325  
Protocol mRNA -1325- P101  Clinical Study Protocol version 6.0  
 Page 61 enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be 
unexpected (by [CONTACT_14214]) if the investigator ’s brochure listed only cerebral 
vascular accidents. “Unexpected,” as used in  this definition, also refers to AEs or suspected 
adverse reactions that are mentioned in the investigator ’s brochure as occurring with a class of 
drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
Unsolicited AEs  will also be evaluated by [CONTACT_499272]: 
• Medically  attended AE: an AE that leads to an unscheduled vis it to a healthca re practitioner  
Any solicited AE that meets any of the following criteria must be entered as an AE  in the AE 
page in the database: • Laboratory test or vital sign measurements with a toxicity score of Grade 3 or greater  
• Solicited local or systemic AE leading  to the subject withdrawing from the study or the 
subject being withdrawn from the study by [CONTACT_093]  
• Solicited local or systemic AE lasting beyond [ADDRESS_642457]- vaccination  
• Solicited local or systemic AE that lead to subject withdrawal from study drug 
• Solicited local or systemic AE that otherwise meets the definition of an SAE  
[IP_ADDRESS].2  Serious  Adverse Events  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” (SAE) if, in the view of either the 
investigator or Sponsor , it results in any of the follo wing outcomes: 
• Death  
• Life-threatening AE  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions 
Document Number: VV-CLIN-000234 eDMS Version: 2.0
Moderna Therapeutics , Inc. mRNA -1325  
Protocol mRNA -1325- P101  Clinical Study Protocol version 6.0  
 Page 62 • Congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Other medically important event 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require  medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life threatening” if, in the view of either 
the investigator or Sponsor , its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does 
not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death.  The investiga tor must immediately (within 24  hours of awareness) 
report to the Sponsor any SAE through the agreed upon reporting mechanism. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_642458]  
Certain AESIs are evaluated after the administration of immunostimulatory agents. All subjects enrolled in the study will be monitored for AESIs from enrollment through the end -of-study 
(EOS ) visit. The occurrence of any of these AEs will be treated as an SAE, meeting the criterion 
of a “medically important event.”  
The list of AESIs is presented in Section  6.2. 
A diagnosis of an AESI will be reported to the Sponsor in an expedited manner similar to  an 
SAE. The AESI diagnosis, as well as any medications taken to treat the condition, will be recorded  in the subject’s eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS].4  Pregnancy  
The investigator is required to inform the Sponsor about any unexpected case of pregnancy 
occurring during the study (for female subjects), monitor the pregnancy until delivery, and 
report whatever outcome to the Sponsor ( no later than 1 week after becoming aware of the 
pregnancy). 
Document Number: VV-CLIN-000234 eDMS Version: 2.[ADDRESS_642459] immediately (within 24 hours of awareness) report to the Sponsor any 
case of pregnancy resulting in an abnormal outcome (miscarriage or newborn with congenital abnormality and/or stillbirth) according to the procedures described for SAEs. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Eliciting and Documenting Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs are recorded in the eCRF and reported to Moderna Therapeutics, Inc. In Part  A of the study, AEs  will be assessed from 
the time of the first dose administration at Visit 1 through Visit 7. However, for the time period 
after the ICF is signed until before receiving the study drug, AEs will only be recorded when 
they are defined as one or more of the following: SAEs, AESIs, or AEs leading to study 
withdrawal . In Part  B of the study, AESIs and SAEs  will be assessed from Visit [ADDRESS_642460] been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], had any accidents, used any new medications, or changed concomitant medication regimens (both prescription and over -the-counter 
medications).  
In addition to subject observations, data from clinical laboratory test results , physical 
examination findings , or other documents relevant to subject safety classified as an AE will be 
documented on the AE page of the eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Reporting Adv erse Events  
All unsolicited AEs reported or observed during the study will be recorded on the AE page of 
the eCRF. Information to be collected includes drug treatment  and dose, type of event, time of 
onset, investigator -specified assessment of severity and  relationship to study drug, time of 
resolution of the event, seriousness, as well as any required treatment or evaluations, and 
outcome. The unsolicited  AEs resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent 
illnesses, reactions to concurrent medications, or progression of disease states must also be reported. All AEs will be followed until they are resolved or stable or judged by [CONTACT_11755]. The MedDRA will be used to code all unsolicited  AEs.  
Document Number: VV-CLIN-000234 eDMS Version: 2.[ADDRESS_642461] is screened but does not 
deteriorate should not be reported as an unsolicited  AE. However, if it deteriorates at any time 
during the study, it should be recorded as an unsolicited AE. 
Any AE considere d serious by [CONTACT_188532] ( Section  [IP_ADDRESS].2) 
must be reported to the Sponsor immediately (within 24 hours of becoming aware of the SAE). 
The investigator will assess whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused 
the SAE. The Sponsor will be responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of any SAE as outlined in the 21 US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts [ADDRESS_642462] ( IRB) directly.  
The following contact [CONTACT_160523]: 
SAE Hotline:  
SAE Fax line:  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Severity  of Unsolicited Adverse Events  
The severity (or intensity) of an AE refers to the extent to which it affects the subject’s daily 
activities and will be classified as mild (Grade 1), moderate (Grade 2), severe (Grade 3), or potentially life threatening (Grade 4) using the following criteria:  
• Mild (Grade 1): These events do not interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
• Moderate (Grade 2): These events cause some interference with the subject’s daily 
activities but do not require medical intervention. 
• Severe (Grade 3): These events prevent the subject’s daily activity and require medical 
intervention. 
• Life threatening (Grade 4): These events require an emergency room visit or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented to allow an assessment of the duration 
of the event at each level of intensity to be performed. An AE characterized as intermittent 
requires documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865]. 
The Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent V olun teers Enrolled in 
Preventative Vaccine Clinical Trials ( CBER 2007) will be used to categorize solicited 
Document Number: VV-CLIN-000234 eDMS Version: 2.[ADDRESS_642463] specific term (eg, renal insufficiency, bronchitis) and supporting 
evidence (eg, laboratory test value, x- ray) will  not be classified as an AE per se.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Assessment of Causality  
The investigator’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to study drug is part of the 
documentation process but is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study.  
The investigator will assess causality (ie, whether there is a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused the event) for all AEs and SAEs. The relationship will be characterized using the following classification: 
• Not related: There is not a reasonable possibility  of Sponsor's product relationship: Subject 
did not receive the S ponsor’s product OR temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to 
administration of the Sponsor’s product is not reasonable OR the AE is more likely 
explained by [CONTACT_26372]’s product.  
• Related: There is a reasonable possibility of S ponsor’s product relationship: There is 
evidence of exposure to the S ponsor’s product. The temporal sequence of the AE onset 
relative to the administration of the S ponsor’s product is reasonable.  The AE is more likely 
explained by [CONTACT_1034]’s product than by [CONTACT_5748]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Follow -up of Adverse Events  
All AEs must be reported in detail on the appropriate page of the eCRF and followed until the 
AE is resolved or stable or judged by [CONTACT_474526] A of the study. For Part B of the study, only  AESIs and SAEs will be recorded. The investigator 
may request an unscheduled visit at any time , if warranted.  
3.5.8 Clinical Laboratory Testing  
Clinical laboratory tests will be performed by [CONTACT_19690] , unless specified otherwise . 
Blood and urine will be collected in Part  A at the time points indicated in the schedule of events 
(Table  6-1). Fasting is not required before collection of laboratory samples.

documented in the subject’s medical records . 
Human immunodeficiency virus (types 1 or 2) antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, and 
hepatitis  C virus antibody will be assessed at Screening. 
At Screening, if the subject has no proof of y ellow fever vaccination within [ADDRESS_642464] N ile virus ser ology screen can occur up to 90 days prior to randomization. 
A urin e screen for drugs of abuse will be performed by [CONTACT_499274] 1 for opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], cocaine,  phencyclidine, amphetamines, 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], and methadone (cannabis excluded).

periodic testing may be needed until the abnormality is deemed to be associated with a new 
stable AE or determined to be not clinically significant by [CONTACT_093].  
Those values that fall within the normal range of the laboratory will automatically be classif ied 
as normal and receive a toxicity score of 0. All values that have a toxicity score of Grade 1 or 
greater will also be evaluated by [CONTACT_499275] “abnormal clinically 
significant (CS)”, or “abnormal not clinically significant (NCS). ” Investigators should use their 
clinical judgment when considering the clinical significance of any abnormal laboratory findings. All laboratory test values with a toxicity score of Grade [ADDRESS_642466] 
value that is associated with an identified ongoing AE where that event would be the classifying AE. 
3.5.9 Vital Sign Measurements 
Vital sign measurements will include systolic and diastolic blood pressures, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_7137] e, and body temperature  (which is classified as a solicited systemic event) . The 
subjec t will be seated for at least 5  minutes before all measurements are taken. Vital signs will 
be measured in Part  A at the time points indicated in the schedule of events ( Table  6-1). 
When procedures overlap and are scheduled to occur  at the same time point, the order of 
procedures should be vital sign measurements and then the blood collection. 
If any of the vital sign measurements meet the toxicity grading criteria for clinical 
abnormalities ( Table  6-3) of Grade  3 or higher, the abnormal value and grade will be 
documented on the AE page of the eCRF  (unless there is another known cause of the 
abnormality and that would result in an AE classi fication) . The investigator will continue to 
monitor the subject with additional assessments until the value has reached the reference range,

is no longer medically necessary . 
3.5.10  Physical Examinations  
In Part  A, a full physical examination will be performed at Screening and a symptom -directed 
(targeted) physical examination  will be performed at all other scheduled time points indicated 
in the schedule of events ( Table  6-1). The full examination will include assessment of skin, 
head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, neck, thyroid, lungs, heart, cardiovascular, abdomen, lymph 
nodes, and musculoskeletal system/extremities. Interim physical examinations will be 
performed at the discretion of the investigator, if necessary, to evaluate AEs or clinical 
laboratory abnormalities.  Prior to vaccination and at 7 days following va ccination, a physical 
evaluation of the arm that was vaccinated and the associated lymph nodes should be evaluated. 
Height and weight will be measured and body mass index will be calculated at Screening only.

any deviation from the approved protocol. The investigator may implement a deviation from, or a change to, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects without prior IRB approval. As soon as possible after such an occurrence, the implemented deviation or 
change, the reasons for it, and any proposed protocol amendments should be submitted to the 
IRB for review and approval, to the Sponsor for agreement, and to the regulatory authorities, 
if required.  
A deviation from the protocol is an unintended or unanticipated departure from the procedures 
or processes approved by [CONTACT_474535]. Deviations 
usually have an impact on individual subjects or a small group of subjects and do not involve inclusion/exclusion or primary endpoint criteria. A protocol violation occurs when the subject 
or investigator do not adhere to the protocol, resulting in a significant, additional risk to the 
subject. Protocol violations can include non- adherence to inclusion or exclusion criteria, 
enrollment of the subject without prior Sponsor approval, or non- adherence to FDA regulations 
or ICH E6(R1) guidelines. 
Protocol violations and deviations will be documented by [CONTACT_499283]. The investigator will be notified in writing by [CONTACT_499284]. The IRB should be notified of all protocol violations and deviations, if appropriate, in a timely manner.

The Role of Skin Care Regimen in  Skin Health  
**********************************************************************************************  
1. Abstract  
Dry skin is not a disease entity but it is  an important  patient  matter as  it can significantly 
decrease  a person’s quality of life. Individuals with dry skin experience discomfort associated with 
itching , skin  tightness , and irritation. The lack of proper hydration is one of the most apparent 
characteristics of dry skin , which  is associated with  erythema and  scaling on the skin surface.  Skin 
care products with  moisturizing feature s have beneficial effects in the treatment  of dry skin.  The 
aim of our study is to evaluate the  role of a regular skin care regimen comprising of a mild cleanser 
and moisturizer in  improving  dry skin  and overall skin health . 
This study will have a study population of up to [ADDRESS_145705] questionnaires  will be obtained 
during the study . 
 
2. Objectives  
 The primary aim of the  study is to evaluate the role of a regular skin care regimen com prising of a 
mild cleanser and moisturizer in improving dry skin and overall skin health.  
 The secondary aim of the  study is  to assess  quality of life  improvement  with a routine skin care  
regimen.   
 
3. Background  
Dry skin  is a common phenomenon and  can dramatically decrease  a person’s quality of life  as 
well as contribute to a wide variety of skin diseases . Individuals with dry skin experience 
discomfort associated with itching , skin tightness , and irritation1. The lack of proper hydration is 
one of the most apparent characteristics of dry skin , which  is associated  with erythema and scaling.[ADDRESS_145706]  
beneficial effects  on dry skin.  Skin care products hydrate the skin  and break s the dry skin cycle5. 
There are many mild cleansers and moisturizers widely available for improvement of dry skin.   
However,  many healthcare providers  and patients  overlook  the importance of  skin care products  and 
a regular skin care regimen .  Numerous studies show  that usage of mild cleansers and  moisturizers 
hydrates and improves dry skin  and appearance .6-13. While there is  extensive evidence of benefits of 
using mild cleanser s and moisturizers, much of the previous studies are limited to the effects of

regimen com prising of a mild cleanser and moisturizer in  improving  dry skin , skin appearance,  and 
overall skin health . 
 
4. Study Procedures  
 
a. Study design, including the sequence and timing of study procedures   
 
Recruitment:  Individuals will be recruited from patient populations seen at the general 
dermatology clinics of Johns Hopkins Department of Dermatology or from patient populations 
participating in Johns Hopkins Cutaneous Translational Research Program (CTReP) research 
studies.  Interested study participants will be evaluated after their routine clinical c are visits.  
Participants will also be recruited from other patient populations at the Johns Hopkins Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_129173].  Study procedures will be conducted at the 
Johns Hopkins CTReP office located at the Johns Ho pkins Outpatient Center.  Recruitment may 
include Johns Hopkins University employees or students, but these groups will not be specifically 
targeted for participation.  Interested indivi duals will be interviewed to ascertain  whether they meet 
the basic eli gibility criteria to participate in the study.  Once eligibility has been demonstrated, the 
potential subjects will be directed to make their first study appointment.  We will recruit up to 100 
participants over the age of 18 with dry, itchy  skin and t hey will be split into 2 groups . Participants 
will be random ly assi gned to skin care regimen group  (approximately 75%  of total enrolled ) and 
control group  (approximately 25%  of total enrolled ). All evaluation will  be conducted similarly in  
both groups.  
    
 Visit [ADDRESS_145708]’s consent to participate in the study as well as 
the subject’s agreement to be contact[CONTACT_129177].  
Once informed consent is obtained,  individuals will undergo a washout period of one week in 
which they are asked to refrain from the use of all moisturizers on their skin.  Participants will 
be supplied with a skin cleanser , Dove® Soap, to use during this period  and application log . All 
applications should be reported in the application log by [CONTACT_3038].  
During this visit, investigators will also perform clinica l assessment, take photographs  and 
administer  subject  questionnaire s.

  All participants will return after the washout period.  Participants in the skin care regimen 
group  will receive Vaseline® Moisturizer, Dove® Soap, and application log. These  participants 
will be asked to apply  the Vaseline® Moisturizer  twice a day  and use Dove® Soap  daily  for 2 
weeks. All applications should be reported in the application log by  [CONTACT_3038]. A 
demonstration and verbal instructions for how and where to apply the products will be provided 
to the subjects  along with the application log for daily use .  Individuals not in the skin care 
regimen group will continue with the provided Dove® Soap .  
During this visit, investigators will perform clinical assessment s, take photographs and 
administer  subject  questionnaire s. 
Visit 3 (day 14±2): 
During this visit, investigators will perform clinica l assessment, take photographs  and 
administer  subject  questionnaire s.  Application logs will be returned.  
 
Clinical assessment: Clinical a ssessments will be performed 1) to record baseline skin findings, 2) 
to evaluate skin status by [CONTACT_129178], and 3) to identify any occurrence of any adverse  events.   
 
Photography: Standardized digital photographs will be obtained by [CONTACT_129179] a digital 
camera and software under sta ndard photographic conditions.  Photograph files will be coded to 
remove personal identifiers and stored on a secure hard drive in CTReP.  
 
b. Study duration and number of study visits required of research participants.  
The study consists of up to [ADDRESS_145709] current therapy 
stopped.

NOT APPLICABLE  
f. Definition of treatment failure or participant removal criteria.  
 
Any clinical findings determined by t he Investigator to be important and/or unusual will be 
referred to as an adverse  event (AE).  Study participants will be  asked to contact [CONTACT_129180].

8. Risks  
 
The moisturizing lotion and wash  are generally very well tolerated.  Rarely, they can  induce a 
burning sensation, dryness, skin irritation, erythema, stinging, sensitization , and dermatitis. Possible 
side effects from the product applications  include irritant and allergic reactions. Irritation from these 
agents can be improved or relieved when participants stop using the products . Risk events, 
problems, and deviations will be reported by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_129175].  
In terms of confidentiality, there are minimal risks as all study participant information will be 
de-identified.  No confidential or protected information would be taken beyond the standard.  There 
is a slight financial risk to the participants in the rare event that the above complications occur, 
requiring additional medical care.

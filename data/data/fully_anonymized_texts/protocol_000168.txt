Study Design: This is a Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, multicenter stud y of 
GS-5745 combined with mFOLFOX6 in subjects with untreated 
gastric and gastroesophageal junction 
(GEJ)adenocarcinoma. A total 
of 430eligible subjects with advanced gastric andGEJ 
adenocarcinoma will be randomized in a 1:1 manner to 
mFOLFOX6
plus GS -5745 or m FOLFOX 6 plus placebo. Treatment assignment will 
be stratified b y Eastern Cooperative Oncology  Group (ECOG) 0 or 1, 
geographic region ( Latin America or other participating countries
), and 
primary tumor site (gastric or GEJ).
Computed Tomograph y (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
scans will be perform ed every  8weeks to evaluate response to 
treatment b y RECI ST v1.1.
Dosage and frequency  will be as follows:
mFOLFOX6 on Days 1 and 15 of each 28- day treatment cy cle 
(1cycle of m FOLFOX consist s of 2 infusions ) for a total of 
6cycles followed b y leucovorin (LV) and 5 -fluorouracil (5-FU)

Criteria for 
Evaluation:All subjects meeting the eligibility  criteria that have signed a consent 
form and have begun treatment will be evaluated for response.
Efficacy
Overall survival (OS) is the primary  endpoint of the study  and is 
measured as time from date of randomization to death from an y cause .
Progression- free survival (PFS) is measured as the interval of time 
from randomization to the earlier of first documentation of definitive 
disease progression or death from an y cause . Subjects who discontinue 
the study  drug before disease progression will continue to be
followed- up until they  have documented disease progression. 
Objective response is assess ed by [CONTACT_337340] v1.1 as Complete 
Response (CR ), Partial Response ( PR), Stable Disease ( SD)
Non-CR/Non -PD (NN) or Progressive Disease (PD). The response of 
Not Evaluable ( NE) will be recorded for subjects who drop out earl y 
before the scheduled imaging is performed, or for images with poor 
quality .Objective response rate ( ORR) is the proportion of subjects 
who achieve a CR or PR.
Safety
The safet y evaluation wil l be based on incidence of adverse events, 
clinically  relevant changes in laboratory  values and vital signs.
Pharmacokinetics
Blood samples to measure GS -5745 and oxaliplatin/5 -FU 
concentrations will be collected at the timepoints specified in the

Assuming a median OS time for the mFOLFOX 6+ placebo group of 
11.[ADDRESS_416626] ratio (HR ) of 
0.70 with 85% power at a 1- sided significance level of 0.025. With an 
accrual period of 18 months, minimum follow -up of 18 months, and a 
10%
annual dropout rate, a total sample size of 430 subjects 
(215 subjects per treatment group) is needed to observe the required 
286events within the 36-month time frame.
As the targeted number of deaths is large (~286), if the null hy pothesis 
of the primary  end point of OS is rejected, it will convincingl y 
demonstrate clinical treatment effect and would provide a narrow 
confidence interval. Based on th e number of deaths and the assumed 
treatment effect on OS in the protocol, the expected 95% confidence 
interval on the 
HR of OS between the 2treatment groups is 
~(0.627, 0.996). At the time of final anal ysis and assuming OS is 
significant, PFS will be te sted at one -sided t ype I error of 0.016. 
Assuming that the hazard ratio in PFS is 0.7, which is expected to be 
on par or better than the treatment effect in OS, and that median PFS in 
control is 9 months, a sample size of 430 subjects (322 PFS events) 
willprovide 85% power under the planned stud y enrolment 
(18months), follow -up duration (18 month) and drop- out rate 
(annuall y 10%).
This study  will be conducted in accordance with the guidelines of Good Clinical Practices 
(GCPs) ,including archiving of essential documents.

1.1. Background
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) comprise a family  of at least 23 Zn2+-dependent proteases 
which are primarily involved in the degradation and remodeli ng of the extracellular matrix and 
basement membranes in many  normal as well as pathologic biological processes. They  are 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y grouped based on their structure or their primary  substrates and include the gelatinases, 
collagenases, stromely sins, matrily sins, an elastase, and membrane- type MMP, a group of cell 
surface tethered prot eases {Hu 2007, Mott 2004}. The gelatinases comprise MMP2 and MMP9, 
sometimes referred to as ty pe IV collagenases, which are named for their ability  to degrade t ype 
IV collagen an d gelatin, a denatured form of collagen
{Chen 2002 , Kridel 2001}. The 
contrasting roles of MMP9 and MMP2 have been revealed in a variety  of studies which support a 
more ubiquitous expression pattern and associated role for MMP2 in normal tissue homeostasis, 
as compared to disease -induced and pathology -associated expression and activity  of MMP9
{Agrawal 2006, Garg 2009, Hu 2007, Itoh 2002, Castaneda 2005 , Dubois 1999, Li 2009, 
Miyazaki 2011, Naito 2005, Santana 2006}. Additional substrates have been identified for 
MMP9 , and 
the active enzy mecan release cy tokines, growth factors, and bioactive fragments 
which in turn modulate inflammation, neovascularization, and matrix remodeling {Hijova 2005}. 
MMP9 is a n inducible MMP that is secreted as a zymogen and activated in a “cy steine switch” 
mechanism by  [CONTACT_337343] {Van Wart 1990}. While 
activation of MMP9 appears to be carried out by  [CONTACT_337344], the protease’s activit y is also 
regulated b y the binding of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), primarily  by [CONTACT_337345]1
{Imai 1995, Olson 1997, Vempati 2007 }.Elevated MMP9 expression in diseased tissue and 
plasma is associated with several human diseases. The health and largel y normal development of 
the MMP9 knockout mouse has enabled evaluation in a variet y of disease models, and these data 
support a signific ant role for MMP9 in a variet y of inflammatory, fibrotic ,and oncologic 
processes {Dubois 1999 , Hu 2007 , Itoh 2002 , Itoh 1999 , Opdenakker 2003 }.
More recent studies in the MMP field have revealed diversity  in the functional roles of MMPs in 
disease and normal homeostasis, suggesting a therapeutic opportunity  for selective inhibitors. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_337310], expression analy sis in hum an disease and data from 
knockout mice reveal contrasting roles for MMP9 and MMP2 regulation and activity  in normal 
homeostasis and in disease. MMP9 expression is restricted to limited cell types in healthy  tissues
whereas MMP2 is found to be more constitu tively  expressed {Hu 2007}. The disease -associated 
induction and functions of MMP9 render it an attractive therapeutic target.

junction (GEJ )is one of the most rapi[INVESTIGATOR_337311].
Most patients with gastric cancer in the [LOCATION_002] are sy mptomatic and already  have 
advanced incurable disease at the time of presentation. At diagnosis, approximately  50percent 
have disease that extends bey ond locoregional confines, and onl y one -half of those who appear 
to have locoregional tumor involvement can undergo a potentially  curative resection. Surgicall y 
curable earl y gastric cancers are usuall y asymptomatic and onl y infrequ ently  detected outside the 
realm of a screening program. Screening is not widely  performed, except in countries which have 
a very  high incidence, such as Japan, Venezuela, and Chile. The common presenting s ymptoms 
and diagnostic approaches to gastric cance r include weight loss (usually results from insufficient 
caloric intake rather than increased catabolism) and may  be attributable to anorexia, nausea, 
abdominal pain, earl y satiety , and/or d ysphagia. Abdominal pain is often present which tends to 
be epi[INVESTIGATOR_337312], vague and mild early  in the disease but more severe and constant as the disease 
progresses. Dy sphagia is a common presenting s ymptom in patients with cancers arising in the 
proximal stomach or at the esophagogastric junction. Patients may  also presen t with nausea or 
early satiet y from the tumor mass or in cases of an aggressive form of diffuse -type gastric cancer 
called linitis plastica, from poor distensibility  of the stomach. They  may  also present with a 
gastric outlet obstruction from an advanced d istal tumor.
In metastatic disease, multiple single agent studies using drugs such as cisplatin, docetaxel, 
5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and irinotecan among others have demonstrated modest activity . 
Treatment of metastatic HER2 negative cancer in the first line setting consists of combination 
chemotherap y with a triplet or doublet regimen. 
The triplet regimen of docetaxel/cisplatin/[ADDRESS_416630] good performance status. 
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for the treatment of metastatic disea se 
recommend a 2 -drug regimen. A common regimen inclu des a fluorop yrimidine (5- FUor 
capecitabine) and plat inum agent (cisplatin or oxaliplatin). The current standard of care for 
patients who progress on front line regimens remains controversial. While many  patients are 
treated in the second line setting with taxanes, some are treated with irinotecan either b y itself or 
in combination with a taxane. Ramucirumab, an anti- vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 
[ADDRESS_416631] regimen for 
this disease, there is also a lack of clinical trials addressing this patient population. The majority  
of patients with adenocarcinom as of the esophagus and stomach are diagnosed with either 
stage III or IV disease and the prognosis is very  poor with 5- year survival rates between 5- 15%. 
Treatment options after first- line therap y are still limited in the metastatic setting. Traditional 
cytotoxic chemotherapy  regimens for second and third- line treatment in patients with metastatic 
disease have shown a median overall survival ranging from [ADDRESS_416632] supportive care {Ford 2014 , Kang 2012 , Thuss- Patience 2011 }.

of MMP9 by  [CONTACT_337346][INVESTIGATOR_337314]-tumorigenic

hages, neutrophils, 
mesench ymal-derived suppressor cells and other cell ty pes in in the tumor microenvironment is 
also associated with local pro -tumorigenic immunomodulation and angiogenesis {Farina 2014}.
In gastric tumors, MMP9 expression is consistently obse rved, often in both tumor epit helia and 
stromal compartments.

AB0046, which cross -reacts with and inhibits murine MMP9, was generated via immunizatio nin

murine MMP9 to that bound by  [CONTACT_10827]-5745 and AB0041 on human MMP9. 
1.2.1. Preclinical Pharmacology and Toxicology
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacology
The therapeutic potential of inhibitory  antibodies targeting human MMP9 (AB0041) and mouse 
MMP9 (AB0046 ) was evaluated in a surgical orthotopic xenograft mouse model of colorectal 
carcinoma in which tumors were derived from the human tumor cell line HCT116. I n this 
treatment model, selective inhib ition of MMP9 using a cockt ail of anti -human MMP9 and 
anti-mouse MMP9 antibodies significantl y reduced growth of the primary tumor and reduced the 
incidence of metastases in multiple independent studies. In xenografts, t reatment with either an 
anti-tumor -MMP9 (human) or anti -
stromal MMP9 (murine) antibody yielded significant tumor 
growth reduction highlighting important roles for tumor epi[INVESTIGATOR_018] -derived and stromal -derived
MMP9 in primary  tumor outgrowth. However, targeting of stromal MMP9 was necessary  for 
maximum efficacy  with respect to incidence of metas tases, highlighting the disease-associated 
role of other cellular so urces of MMP9 in tumorigenesis.
The major dose limiting toxicity  observed in clinical studies with pan -MMP inhibitors, such as 
marimas tat, was musculoskeletal sy ndrome (MSS ) consisting of tendonitis manifested b y joint 
stiffness, edema, reduced mob ility, and skin discoloration. A study  to evaluate the potential of an 
anti-MMP9 antibody  to induce MSS was conducted in Lewis rats. Unlike th e pan -MMP 
inhibitor, Marimastat, AB0041 did not induce any evidence of MSS or other toxicities in this
Lewis rat MSS model.

Investigator’s Brochure (IB).
[IP_ADDRESS]. Toxicology
The toxicity  profile of GS -5745 has been assessed in rats and monkey s administered GS - 5745 
intravenous once weekl y for up to 4 weeks (5 doses) at up to 100 mg/kg/dose. Ta rget organs 
identified in the 4 -week studies were the ph yseal bone (rat) and adrenal gland (monkey ). The 
physeal hy pertroph y in rats is likely  directl y attributable to inhibition of MMP9 as similar 
findings were observed in MMP9 null mi ce {Vu 1998} and in children with mutatio ns in MMP9 
and MMP13 { Lausch 2009}. In both mice and children, this is a transient finding that 
spontaneously  regresses as the bone matures. The phy seal hy pertroph y noted in rats is not 
considered relevant to adult humans because the growth plates are closed and longitudinal bone 
growth is no longer ongoing in adults. The relationship of the adrenal gland weight increase to 
MMP9 inhibition is unknown. Both the ph yseal bone and adrenal gland findings were re versible 
after discontinu ing GS
-5745 treatment. Because these findings were minimal and/or did not 
impact the overall health of the animals, these finding s were not considered adverse. The no 
observed adverse effect levels inboth the rat and monkey  studies were 100 mg/kg/dose 
intravenous once weekl y for 4 weeks (5 doses).
1.2.2. Clinical Trials of GS-5745
In addition to the clinical development program in solid tumors, GS -5745 is being developed for 
the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis andcystic fibrosis. Details of the clinical studies in these 
diseases can be found in the IB.
Study  GS US -296- 0101 is a Phase 1, open -label, dose -escalation study  to evaluate safet y, 
pharmacokinetics ( PK), and pharmacod ynamics following multiple intravenous administrations 
of GS -[ADDRESS_416634] treatment is available. Multiple doses 
between 200 and 1800 mg are being evaluated.
1.3.
Rationale for This Study
The preliminary  clinical efficacy  data in patients with gastric and GEJ adenocarcinoma treated 
with GS- 5745 (800 mg every  2 weeks ) and mFOLFOX6 in the Phase 1 study (GS-US- 296-0101)
suggests that the combination is well tolerated and has the potential to provide benefit over 
treatment with mFOLFOX6 alone. Serum biomarkers including the collagen neo -epi[INVESTIGATOR_337316] y to reflect MMP9 enzymatic activity decrease during the first cycle of treatment with 
these agents. The 800 mg every  2 weeks regimen of GS-5745 is expected to reach linear r ange of 
pharmacokinetics ( ie,saturate target -mediated drug disposition at trough concentrations) and to 
achieve stead y trough concentrations greater than 26 g/mL  in majorit y of subjects, which is 
260-fold over the IC50(0.691 nM or 0.1 g/mL) evaluated in enzy matic inhibitory  activities of 
GS-5745 in vitro. Together, these data support the hypothesis that GS -5745 treatment inhibits 
MMP9 activity  and that the inhibition may  lead to improved clinical outcomes. The study  aims 
GS-5745
Protocol GS -US-296-1080 Final
[COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc. Amendment 6
CONFIDENTIAL Page 23 06March 2017to assess in a randomized, blinded fashion whether GS -5745 in combination with mFOLFOX6 
improve stherapeutic outcomes in subjects with previously  untreated locally  advanced or 
metastatic gastric and GEJ adenocarcinoma.
1.3.1. Information about mFOLFOX -6
Treatment of metastatic HER2 negative esophagogastric adenocarcinoma consists of 
combination chemotherapy  with a triplet or doublet cy totoxic regimen. The triplet regimen of 
docetaxel/cisplatin/[ADDRESS_416635] line setting 
recommend a 2 -drug regimen. A common regimen includes a fluoropy rimidine 
(5-FUorcapecitabine) a nd platinum agent (cisplatin oroxaliplatin). There are no definitive 
studies demonstrating the superiority  of either fluoropy rimine or platinum. An mFOLFOX6 
regimen is commonly  used and 
is acceptable in the first line setting to treat advanced 
esophagogastric adenocarcinoma and will be evaluated in combination with GS -5745.
1.4. Risk/Benefit Assessme nt for the Study
GS-[ADDRESS_416636] of care 
chemotherap y appears to be safe and well
-tolerated. The 800 mg every  2 weeks regimen of 
GS-5745 IV is expected to achieve stead y trough concentrations greater than 26 µg/mL  in the 
majority  of subjects, which is 260- fold over the IC50(0.691 nM or 0.1 µg/mL ) evaluated in 
enzy matic inhibitory activities of GS -[ADDRESS_416637] 
of care chemotherap y. Preliminary  efficacy  data indicates that the objective response rate is 58% 
(33evaluable subjects, data on file as of 11 September 2015) compared to the historical response 
rate of approximately  40% in gastric cancer patients with measurable disease tre ated with 
mFOLFOX6.
For the treatment of advanced gastric cancer, a common regimen includes a fluoropy rimidine 
(5-
FU or capecitabine) and platinum agent (cisplatin or oxaliplatin). There are no definitive 
studies demonstrating the superiority  of either fluoropy rimine or platinum. In the EU, in line 
with ESMO recommendations clinical practice guidelines {Waddell 2013}, combination 
regimens based upon a platinum fluoropy rimidne doublet are generally  used for the treatment of 
metasta tic advanced gastric cancer.
There is no clear or demonstrably  superior standard regimen for the treatment of advanced 
gastric cancer and few clinical trials addressing this target patient population. Furthermore, there 
are limited first -line therapy  treat ment options in the metastatic setting. In addition, prognosis is 
poor in patients with adenocarcinoma of the stomach diagnosed with Stage III or IV disease.

5.1. Randomization, Blinding and Treatment Codes
Randomization to GS -5745 or placebo will be based on a randomization schedule prepared b y 
[COMPANY_009] and/or a designee before the start of the study . Eligible subjects will be randomized via an 
interactive web response sy stem (IWRS).As described in Section 8.5.1, r andomization w ill be 
stratified by  [CONTACT_337347] (0 or 1) at screening, geographic region (Latin America or other 
participating countries), and primary  tumor site (gastric orGEJ).
The I WRS will be used to maintain a central log documenting screening, to implement 
randomi zation, to assess current inventories of study  drug, to 
initiate any necessary  resuppl y of 
study  drug, and to document discontinuation of the study  drug. 
The I WRS will assign kitnumbers and provide instructions for dispensing of blinded study  drug 
(GS-5745/placebo). It is anticipated that subjects will usually  begin study  drug immediatel y after 
randomization.
5.1.1. Procedures for Breaking Treatment Codes
In the event of a medical emergency  whe re breaking the blind is required to provide medical care 
to the subject, the investigator may  obtain treatment assignment directly  from the I WRS sy stem 
for that subject. [COMPANY_009] recommends but does not require that the investigator contact [CONTACT_110099]. Treatment assignment should remain blinded 
unless that knowledge is necessary  to determine subject emergency  medical care. The rationale 
for unblinding must be clearl y explained in source documentation and on the e lectronic case 
report form ( eCRF), along with the date on which the tre atment assignment was obtained. The 
investigator is requested to contact [CONTACT_337351] y treatment 
unblinding.
Blinding of stud y treatment is critical to the integrity  of this clinical trial and therefore, if a 
subject’s treatment assignment is disclosed to the investigator, the subject will have study  
treatment discontinued. All subjects will be followed until study  completion unless consent to do 
so is specificall y withdrawn by [CONTACT_423].
[COMPANY_009] Drug Safet y and Public Health (DSPH) may independentl y unblind cases for expedited 
reporting of suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs).

5.3.1. Dose Interruption and Reduction
If an adverse event is attributed to only  1drug (ie, GS-5745/placebo or 1 or more component of 
mFOLFOX6 ), the investigator’s discretion will be used to determine if the drug (s) not attributed 
to the adverse event will be withheld based on the investigator’s assessment of risk-benefit of 
withholding 1or more drug s(please see sections [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS] for additional guidance) .
Careful monitoring must be ensured for subjects with a history
 of allergic reactions to other 
platinum based chemotherap y agents.  In the event of anaph ylactic shock s ymptoms, interrupt 
infusion im mediately  and initiate appropriate treatment. Resumption of oxaliplatin treatment 
following anaph ylactic reaction is contraindicated.

[COMPANY_009]’s policy  prohibits exemptions from protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria. In the event of a 
significant deviation related to gross non -compliance from the protocol or incidences that impose 
significant risk to subject safet y, the investigator or designee must notify [COMPANY_009] and/or its

therefore be an y unfavorable and/or unintended sign, s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated 
with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered re lated to the medicinal product. 
AEs may  also include pre -or post -treatment complications that occur as a result of protocol 
specified procedures, lack of efficacy , overdose ,drug abuse/misuse reports , or occupational 
exposure .Preexisting events that increase in severity  or change in nature during or as a 
consequence of participation in the clinical study  will also be considered AEs.
AnAE does not include the following:
Medical or surgical procedures such as surgery , endoscopy ,tooth extraction, and transfusion. 
The condition that ledto the procedure may  be an adverse event and must be reported.
Pre-existing diseases, conditions, or laboratory  abnormalities present or detected before the 
screening visit that donot worsen
Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (eg ,hospi[INVESTIGATOR_337323] y infusion per institutional guidelines, elective surgery , social and/or 
convenience admissions)
Overdose without clinical sequelae 
Any medical condition or clinically  significant laboratory  abnormality  with an onset date 
before the consent form is signed and not related to a protocol -associated procedure is not 
an 
AE. I t is considered to be pre -existing and should be documented on the medical history  
eCRF.
7.1.2. Serious Adverse Events
AnSAE is defined as an event that, at an y dose, results in the following:
Death
Life-threatening (Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an 
event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event that h ypotheticall y might have caused death if it were more severe.)

Persistent or significant disability /incapacit y
A congenital anomal y/birth defect
A medicall y important event or reac tion: such eve nts may  not be immediately  
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_82221]. Medical and 
scientific judgment must be exerc ised to determine whether such an event is a reportable 
under expedited reporting rules. Examples of m edically  important e vents include intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do n
ot result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; and development of drug dependency  or 
drug abuse. For the avoidance of doubt, infections resulting from contaminated medicinal 
product will be considered a m edicall y important e vent and subject to expedited reporting 
requireme nts.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Protocol -Specific Serious Adverse Event Instructions
To maintain the integrit y of the study , disease progression and death from disease progression 
should be reported as SAEs by  [CONTACT_337363] (ie, b y a means other than lack of effect). Unrelated 
disease progression should be captured on the eCRF.
In addition, events that are indicative of the following disease -related SAEs that are assessed as 
unrelated to stud y drugs will not be reported as expedited reports b y [COMPANY_009] during the stud y:
Progression of gastric cancer
Death related to disease progression
These events will be exempt from global expedited reporting requirements for the duration of the 
study  as they  are the primary  endpoints of this study . They  will be reported as appropriate in the 
final clinical study  report as well as any  relevant aggregate safet y report.
7.2. Assessment of Adverse Events and Serious A dverse Events
The investigator or qualified subinvestigator is responsible for assessing AEs and SAEs for 
causality  and severity , and for final review and confirmation of accuracy  of event information 
and assessments.

Protocol GS -US-296-1080 Final
[COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc. Amendment 6
CONFIDENTIAL Page 53 06March [ZIP_CODE].2.1. Assessment of Causality for Study Drug s and Procedures
The investigator or qualified subinvestigator is responsible for assessing t he relationship to IMP
therap y using clinical judgment and the following considerations:
No:Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology  other than the study  drug . For 
SAEs, an alternative causality  must be provided (eg, pre -existing condition, underly ing 
disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication).
Yes:There is reasonable possibility  that the event may  have been caused by [CONTACT_337364].
It should be emphasized that ineffective treatment should not be considered as causall y related in 
the context of adverse event reporting. 
The relationship to study  procedures (eg, invasive procedures such as venipuncture or biops y) 
should be assessed using the following considerations:
No: Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology  other than the study  procedure.
Yes: The adverse event occurred as a result of protocol procedures, (eg., venipun cture)
7.2.2. Assessment of Severity
The severit y of AEs will be graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology  
Criteria for Adverse Events ( NCI CTCAE), Version 4.03 in the study  manual.
If an NCI CTCAE term is not available for the AE/SAE, the severity  will be graded per the 
General Guidance rules found in the introduction sec tion of the NCI CTCAE , Version 4.03 
document.  
The distinction between the seriousness and the severity  of an AE should be noted. Severe is a 
measure of intensit y; thus, a severe (Grade 3) reaction is n ot necessarily a serious adverse event 
(SAE) . 
7.3. Investigator Requirements and Instructions for Reporting Adverse Events 
and Serious Adverse Events to [COMPANY_009]
Requirements for collection prior to study  drug initiation:
After informed consent, but prior to ini tiation of study  medication, the following t ypes of events 
should be reported on the eCRF : 
All SAEs and adverse events related to protocol -mandated procedures
GS-[ADDRESS_416671] administration of GS-5745/placebo 
or all components of mFOLFOX6, 
whichever is discontinued later .  These must be reported to the eCRF database as instructed.  
All AEs should be followed up until resolution or until the adverse event is stable, if possible. 
[COMPANY_009] Sciences may  request that certain AEs be followed bey ond the protocol defined follow-up 
period.
7.3.2. Serious Adverse Events
All SAEs, regardless of cause or relationship, that occur safter the subject first conse nts to 
participate in the stud y (ie, signing the informed consent) and throughout the duration of the 
study , including the protocol -required post treatment follow -up period, must be reported to the 
eCRF database and [COMPANY_009] DSPH as instructed. This also inc ludes any  SAEs resulting from 
protocol -associated procedures performed after informed consent is signed.
Any SAEs and deaths that occur after the post treatment follow -up visit but within [ADDRESS_416672] dose of GS-5745/placebo or all components of mFO LFOX6, whichever is discontinued later , 
regardless of causality , should also be reported. 
Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek SAEs after the protocol defined follow up period ,
however, if the investigator learns of an y SAEs that occur after s tudy participation has concluded 
and the event is deemed relevant to the use of study  drug , he/she should promptly  document and 
report the event to [COMPANY_009] DSPH.
All AEs and SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF database within the timelines outlined in the 
eCRF completion guideline .
SAEs will be reported using an electronic SAE (eSAE) sy stem . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Electronic Serious Adverse Event (eSAE) Reporting Process
Site personnel record all SAE data in the eCRF database and from there transmit the SAE 
information to [COMPANY_009] DSPH within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event. 
Detailed instructions can be found in the eCRF completion guidelines.

7.5. Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments as 
Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events
Laboratory  abnormalities are usuall y not recorded as AEs or SAEs. However, laboratory  
abnormalities ( eg,clinical chemistry , hematology , and urinal ysis) that require medical or surgical 
intervention or lead to interruption or discontinuation of study  drug (GS -5745/placebo) or 
mFOLFOX6 must be recorded as an AE, as well as an SAE, if applicable. In addition, laboratory  
or other abnormal assessments ( eg, electrocardiogram, X -rays, vital signs) that are associated 
with signs and/or s ymptoms must be recorded as an AE or SAE if they  meet the definition of an 
AE or SAE as described in Sections 7.1.[ADDRESS_416673] the syndrome or diagnosis ( ie,anemia) not the laboratory  result

with the grading of the laboratory  abnormality .
7.6. Toxicity Management
Treatment -emergent toxicities will be noted by  [CONTACT_337365] . Whet her or not considered treatment -related, 
all subjects experiencing AEs must be monitored periodicall y until symptoms subside, any  
abnormal laboratory  values have resolved or returned to baseline levels or they  are considered

7.7. Special Situations Reports
7.7.1. Definitions of Special Situations
Special si tuation reports includ e all reports of medication error, abuse, misuse, overdose, reports 
of adverse events associated with product complaints, and pregnancy  reports r egardless of an 
associated AE.
Medication error is an y unintentional error in the prescri bing, dispensing ,or administration of a 
medicinal product while in the control of the health care provider , subject, or consumer.
Abuse is defined as persistent or sporadic intentional excessive use of a medicinal product by  a 
subject.
Misuse 
is defined as an y intentional and inappropriate useof a medicinal p roduct tha t is not in 
accordance with the protocol instructions or the local prescribing information .
An overdose is defined as an accidental or intentional administration of a quantity  ofa medicinal 
product given per administration or cumulatively  which is above the maximum recommended 
dose as per protocol or in the product labelling (as it applies to the daily  dose of the subject in 
question). In cases of a discrepancy  in drug accountabi lity, overdose will be established only  
when it is clear that the subject has taken the excess dose(s). Overdose cannot be established 
when the subject cannot account for the discrepancy  except in cases in which the investigator has 
reason to suspect that the subject has taken the additional dose(s).

The ITT anal ysis set includes data from all randomized subjects. Study  drug assignment will be 
designated according to randomization.
This analy sis set will be used in the anal yses of subject characteristics, OS, PFS, ORR and DCR . 
The anal ysis of OS based on the ITT anal ysis set will be considered the primary  anal ysis of the

8.4.1. G eneral Methods
By-subject listings will be created for important variables from each eCRF module.
Summary  tables for continuous variables will contain the following statistics:
N (number in analy sis set), n (number with data), mean, sta ndard deviation (std),
95% confidence intervals ( CIs) on the mean, median, minimum, and maximum. Summary  tables 
for categorical variables will include: N, n, percentage, and 95% CIs on the percentage. Unless 
otherwise indicated, 95% CI s for binary  variables will be calculated using t he binomial 
distribution (exact method) and will be [ADDRESS_416681] change from baseline during the study  will also be described and 
summarized by  [CONTACT_2939]. Graphical techniques (eg, waterfall plots, Kaplan -Meier curves,
etc.) may  be used when such methods are appropriate and informative.
The baseline value used in each anal ysis will be the last (most recent) pre -treatment value.
Subjects with discrepancies between the stratification factor values at randomization and the 
actual values as documented on data review will be categorized in the anal yses according to the 
actual values. In the situation that there is insufficient information in a stratum (ie, if there are 
< 6subjects or there are no event sin a stratum), that stratum will be pooled with the small est 
adjacent stratum for stratified anal yses; the smallest stratum is defined as that stratum having the 
fewest number of subjects or the fewest number of events in case the former is a tie and the 
adjacent stratum is defined as a stratum having 2 factors of the 3 at the same level. Data from all 
sites will be pooled for all analy ses. Anal yses will be based upon the observed data unless 
methods for handling missing data are specified. If there is a significant degree of non -normalit y, 
analyses may  be perfor med on log- transformed data or nonparametric tests may  be applied, as 
appropriate.
Unless otherwise specified, all anal yses will be 
1-sided at the 0.025 level of significance.
The following censoring conventions will be applied to tumor control endpoints:
OS: Data from surviving subjects will be censored at the last time that the subject was known
to be alive .
PFS: Data from surviving, non -progressing subjects will be censored at the earliest of the
time of initiation of antitumor treatment other than the s tudy treatment or the last time that
lack of definitive progression was objectivel y documented. Data from subjects who have 
disease progression or die after ≥[ADDRESS_416682] time prior to the missing as sessments that lack of definitive disease progression 
was objectivel y documented.
DOR: Data from surviving, non -progressing subjects will be censored at the earliest of the

plus 55 day s will be summarized by  [CONTACT_34689] ( according to the treatment received) . Data 
for the pre -treatment and post-treatment follow -up period will be included in data listings.
In general, count and percent of subjects will summarize cate gorical and ordinal data. 
Mean, standard deviation, minimum, quartiles, median, and maximum will summarize 
continuous data.
8.6.1. Extent of Exposure
A subject’s extent of exposure to GS-
5745 will be generated from the study drug administration 
eCRF page. Exposure data will be summarized by  [CONTACT_1570].
8.6.2. Adverse Events
Clinical and laboratory  adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  for 
Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA ). Sy stem Organ Class (SOC), High -Level Group Term 
(HLGT ), High -Level Term (HLT),Preferred Term (PT), and Lower -Level Term (LLT)will be 
attached to the clinical database.
Events will be summarized on the basis of the date of onset for the event. A treatment -emergent 
adverse event is defined as any  adverse event with onset date on or after the date of first dose of 
study  drug up to 55days after permanent study  drug discontinuation or an y adverse events
leading to premature study  drug discontinuation
.
Summaries (number and percentage of subjects) of treatm ent-emergent adverse events 
(by[CONTACT_2946], HLT, and PT) will be provided by  [CONTACT_71930].
8.6.3. Laboratory Evaluations
Selected laboratory data ( using conventional units) will be summarized using onl y observed data. 
Data and change from baseline at all scheduled time points will be summarized.
Graded laboratory  abnormalities will be defined using the NCI CTCAE (version 4.03). 
Maximum post -baseline grade will be summarized by  [CONTACT_337367].
Incidence of treatment -emergent laboratory  abnormalities, defined as values that increase at least 
1toxicity  grade from baseline at an y time post -baseline, will be summarized by  [CONTACT_1570]. 
If baseline data are missing, then an y graded abnormality  (
ie,at least a Grade1) will be 
considered treatment -emergent.
Laboratory  abnormalities that occur before the first dose of study  drug will be included in data 
listings.

Similar general approaches to the AE and clinical laboratory  data will be utilized to summarize 
other safet y measures.
8.7.
Pharmacokinetic Analysis
The plasma concentration data of GS -5745, oxaliplatin, and 5- FU (and metabolite, if applicable) 
will be summarized by  [CONTACT_10863] (eg, sample size, 
arithmetic mean, geometric mean, coefficient of variation (%) standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum). PK parameters (C max, Tmax, Clast, Tlast, Ctau, λz, AUC last, AUC tau, and t ½, 
as applicable) will be listed and summarized using descriptive statistics .
Plasma concentrations 
over time may  also be plotted in semi -logarithmic and linear formats as mean ± standard 
deviation, and median (Q1, Q3). Exposures (C maxand AUC) of oxaliplatin and 5-FU with or 
without co- administration of GS - 5745 will be compared to evaluate if GS - 5745 treatment alters 
the PK of oxaliplatin/5- FU. 
Exposure -response anal ysis may  be explored as appropriate.
The number and percen tage of positive or negative anti- GS-[ADDRESS_416686] of anti -GS-5745 antibody  on GS -5745 PK, 
safet y, and efficacy may be evaluated.

8.9. Patient -Reported Outcomes
The values and change from baseline for E Q-5D- 3L index scores and the visual analog scale 
(VAS) will be summarized by  [CONTACT_337368]. 
The EORTC QLQ -C30 and QLQ -STO22 questionnaire will be scored according to EORTC 
guidelines, such that all scales from [ADDRESS_416687] deterioration of ≥ [ADDRESS_416688] ratio and the 95% CI comparing the 
treatment and placebo arm will be provided using the Cox proportional hazard model. 
The QLQ -C30 and QLQ -STO22 analysis will also characterize each post baseline assessment as 
Improved if the improvement from baseline is ≥ 10 points, and Stable if the change from 
baseline is within +/-10 points, exclusive. The proportion of subjects in each treatment arm with 
Improved/Stable scores will be summarized at each time point and overal l. The odds ratio and 
the 95% CI comparing the treatment and placebo arm will be provided.
8.10. Interim Analyses
Two formal interim analy ses (detailed in Appendix 6) are planned: the futility  interim will be 
performed at approximately  33.3% information and the efficacy  interim at 66.7 % information . 
The final analy sis will occur when [ADDRESS_416689] been observed. 
The Lan- DeMets approach with O’Brien -Fleming ty pe alpha spending function will be used to 
control the ty pe I error rate for testing . The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] b oundaries at each efficacy  anal ysis tim e 
are provided in Table 8-1.

Z scale One- sided p-value scale
Interim 191 (66.7%) 2.509 0.006
Final 286 (100%) 1.993 0.023
Given significance of OS at either the interim or final anal ysis, the secondary  endpoints of PFS 
and ORR will sequentially  tested at the 1-sided 0.016 significance level.
If the DMC sees substantial evidence of benefit of the GS- 5745 + m FOLFOX 6 combination,
(ie,OSis significantl y better in Arm A compared to Arm B) ,[COMPANY_009] personnel who are not 
involved with the study  may  perform an unblinded review of the integrated interim data, and 
may decide to stop the study  and offer GS -5745 treatment to those subjects who are still enrolled
in Arm B.
8.11. Sample Size
Assuming a median OS t ime for the mFOLFOX 6+ placebo group of 11.[ADDRESS_416690] ratio (HR) of 0.70 with 85% power at a 1-sided significance level 
of 0.[ADDRESS_416691], given 1efficacy interim at 66.7% information. With an accrual 
period of 18 months, minimum follow -up of 18 months, and a 10% annual dropout rate, a total 
sample size of 
430 subjects (215 subjects per treatment group) is nee ded to observe the required 
286events within the given time frame.
GS-5745
Protocol GS -US-296-1080 Final
[COMPANY_009] Sciences, Inc. Amendment 6
CONFIDENTIAL Page 66 06March 2017As the targeted number of de aths is large (~286), if the null hy pothesis of the primary  end point 
of OS is rejected, it will convincingl y demonstrate clinical treatment effect and would provide a 
narrow confidence interval. Based on the number of deaths and the assumed treatment effect on 
OS in the protocol, the expected 95% confidence interval on HR of OS between the 2 treatment 
groups is approximately (0.627, 0.996). At the time of final anal ysis and assuming OS is 
significant, PFS will be tested at one -sided t ype I error of 0.016. Assuming that the hazard ratio 
for PFS is 0.7, which is expected to be on par or better than the treatment effect in OS, and that 
median PFS for the control is 9 months, a sample size of 430 subjects (322 PFS events) will 
provide 85% power under the planned study  enrol lment (18 months), follow -up duration ( 18month) ,
and drop- out rate (annually  10%).
8.12. Data Monitoring Committee
An independent DMC will review the data for safety  and efficacy . Safet y review by [CONTACT_337369] 60subjects hav
e completed 4 treatment cycles. Thereafter, 
review of safet y data will be performed at regular intervals as described in the DMC charter. In 
addition, the DMC will meet after approximately 33.3% and approximately 66.7% ofthe 
expected number of events have occurr edto review the results from the futility  and efficacy  
interim analy sis, respectively .
The DMC’s specific activities will be defined b y a mutually  agreed charter, which will define the 
DMC’s membership, conduct and meeting schedule.
While the DMC will be as ked to advise [COMPANY_009] regarding future conduct of the study, including 
possible earl y study termination, [COMPANY_009] retains final decision -making authority  on all aspects of 
the study .

Potential, and Contraceptive Requirements
1)
Pregnancy and Contraception Requirements for Males and Females of Childbearing 
Potential
The risks of treatment with GS-[ADDRESS_416712] version of the investigator’s brochure for additional information on the study  
drug of GS -5745 .Please refer to the regional prescribin g information for information on the 
potential risks of treatment with mFOLFOX6. 
2)Definition of Female of Childbearing Potential
For the purposes of this study , a female subject of childbearing potential is a woman who has not 
had a h ysterectom y, bilateral oophorectom y, or medicall y documented ovarian failure. This 
definition includes pubertal females regardless of whether or not she has had a menses 
(premenarchal, Tanner Stage 3) and perimenopausal women who have had a spontaneous 
menses in the last 12 mon ths. A woman who has had a tubal sterilization is considered to be of 
childbearing potential.
Women ≤ 54years of age with amenorrhea of an y duration will be considered to be of 
childbearing potential unless they  have had a hy sterectom y, bilateral oophorec tomy, or 
medically  documented ovarian failure .
Women > 54 years of age with cessation (for ≥12 months) of previously  occurring menses 
due to ovarian failure will not be considered to be of childbearing potential.
3)Contraceptive Requirements for Females
Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to use protocol specified method(s) of 
contraception from the screening/ randomization visit through out the study  period , 90days 
following the last dose of study  drug (GS-5745/placebo) and for [ADDRESS_416713] 
chooses continuous heterosexual abstinence as a lifesty le choice . The investigator should counsel 
subjects on the protocol specified method (s) for avoiding pregnancy  during the study . These 
methods are recommended due to the low failure rate (ie, lessthan 1% per y ear). See the 
protocol specified contraceptive methods listed below . 
Female stud y subjects who are not heterosexually active must have periodic confirmation of 
continued abstinence from heterosexual intercourse and regular pregnancy testing while taking 
study  drug .The investigator should counsel subjects on the protocol specified method(s) for 
avoiding pregnancy  in case the subject chooses to engage in heterosexual intercourse.
GS-[ADDRESS_416714] use of 1 of the following methods of birth control listed below:
Intrauterine device (IUD) with a failure rate of <1% per year
Tubal sterilization
Essure m icro-insert sy stem (provided confirmation of success 3 months after procedure). 
This is not y et approved in Japan.
Vasectom y in the male partner (provided that the partner is the sole sexual partner and had 
confirmation of surgical success 3 months after procedure)
Female subjects must also refrain from egg donation and in vitro fertilization during treatment 
and until at least [ADDRESS_416715] dose of 5-
FU whichever occurs later.
4)Contraceptive Requirements for Males
Male subjects must agree to use condoms and avoid sperm donation from the 
screening/ randomization visit throughout the study period , [ADDRESS_416716] dose of stud y drug (GS-5745/placebo) and for [ADDRESS_416717] dose of 5 -FUwhichever occurs later.
5)Contraception Requirements for Oxaliplatin
Female subjects of childbearing potential must use a protocol recomm ended method of 
contraception from the screening visit throughout the study  treatment period and for [ADDRESS_416718] dose of oxaliplatin.
6) Unacceptable Birth Control Methods
Birth contr ol methods that are unacceptable include periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, 
ovulation, sy mptothermal, post -ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides 
only, and lactational amenorrhea method (LAM). Female condom an d male condom should not 
be used together.
7) Procedures to be Followed in the Event of Pregnancy
Subjects should be instructed to notify  the investigator if they  become pregnant at an y time 
during the stud y, and if they  become pregnant within 90days followi ng the last dose the study  
drug (GS-5745/placebo) and within 4 months (or 6 months for the partner of male subjects) of 
GS-[ADDRESS_416719] report the information to the 
investigator. Instr uctions for reporting partner pregnancy , pregnancy  and pregnancy  outcome are 
outlined in Section [IP_ADDRESS].

CONFIDENTIAL Page 89 06March 2017Appendix 6. Details for Testing Efficacy Endpoints
This appendix provides details for testing multiple efficacy  endpoints at interim and final 
analyses.
The final analy sis will occur when 286 overall survival (OS) events have been observe d. 
Two formal interim analyses are planned: the futility  interim anal ysis and the efficacy  interim 
analysis will be performed when approximately  33.3% and 66.7% of OS events have occurred, 
respectivel y.
Futility Interim Analysis
The end point of the futili
ty interim anal ysis is OS. The futility  analy sis will occur approximately  
after 95 OS events (33.3% of the information relative to the final anal ysis) have been observed in 
the ITT population. The anal ysis will perform a stratified log -rank test for OS in the I TT 
population. A non- binding futility  rule will be implemented. Based on the analy sis results, the 
DMC may  recommend terminating the study  for lack of efficacy  if the 
predictive power ( PP) on 
OS in I TT population is < 14%. Otherwise, the study  will be continued. 
Predictive power is defined as a weighted average of the conditional power ;the weighting 
function is determined by  [CONTACT_337374]{Lan 2012 }. When exactly  95 OS events are observed at the interim, 
this futility  rule 
of PP <14% corresponds to observing an OS hazard ratio (HR) > 0.[ADDRESS_416720] ratio is 0.7, the probability  of 
terminating the stud y early  is 7%. On the other hand, when the true hazard ratio is 1, indicating 
lack of efficacy , the probability  of terminating the study  early is 60%.

Efficacy Interim and Final Analysis 
In the efficacy  interim and final anal ysis, the primary  and secondary  endpoints will be tested 
sequentially  in the following gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_208833]: the primary  OS endpoint, then the secondary  
PFS endpoint, and finally the secondary  ORR endpoint. Specifically :
At the efficacy  interim analy sis, the OS event point will be tested at one -sided alpha level of 
0.006. If the OS endpoint is not rejected, the stud y will continue to final analysis. If the OS 
endpoint i s rejected, the DMC would recommend earl y stop for efficacy. Furthermore, the 
PFS endpoint will be tested at one- sided alpha level of 0.016. Onl y if the PFS endpoint is 
rejected, the ORR endpoint will be tested at one -sided alpha level of 0.016.
At the final anal ysis, the OS event point will be tested at one -sided alpha level of 0.023. If 
the OS endpoint is rejected, the PFS endpoint will be tested at one -sided alpha level of 0.016. 
If the PFS endpoint is also rejected, the ORR endpoint will be tested at on e-sided alpha level 
of 0.016.
This gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_337329]. Overall, this testing strategy  
employ s O’Brian- Fleming boundary  for the primary  OS endpoint and the Pocock t ype boundary 
for the secondary  PFS/ORR endpoints. The testing strategy  controls the overall one- sided 
family -wise ty pe I error to be at 0.025, equivalent to two sided 0.05 by  [CONTACT_337375].

Guidelines ABSTRACT 
Background : Assessment of the change in tumour burden is an important feature of the 
clinical evaluation of cancer therapeutics : both tumour shrinkage (objective response) 
and disease progression are useful endpoints in clinical trials . Since RECIST was published 
in 2000, many investigators, cooperative groups , industry and government authorities have 
adopted these criteria in the assessment of treatment outcomes . However , a number of 
questions and issues have arisen which have led to the development of a revised RECIST 
guideline (version 1.1). Evidence for changes, summarised in separate papers in this special 
issue , has come from assessment of a large data warehouse (>6500 patients), simulation 
studies and literature reviews. 
Highl ights of revised RECIST 1.1: Major changes include : Number of lesions to be assessed : based 
on evidence from numerous trial databases merged into a data warehouse for analysis pur 
poses , the number of lesions required to assess tumour burden for response determination 
has been reduced from a maximum of 10 to a maximum of five total (and from five to two 
per organ , maximum) . Assessment of patholog ical lymph nodes is now incorporated: nodes 
with a short axis of ;;,,.15 mm are considered measurable and assessable as target lesions. 
The short axis measurement should be included in the sum of lesions in calculation of 
tumour response. Nodes that shrink to <10 mm short axis are considered normal. Confirma 
tion of response is required for trials with response primary endpoint but is no longer 
required in randomised studies since the control arm serves as appropriate means of inter 
pretation of data. Disease progression is clarified in several aspects : in addition to the previ 
ous definition of progression in target disease of 20% increase in sum , a [ADDRESS_416724] over calling PD when the total sum is very

small. Furthermore, there is guidance offered on what constitutes ‘unequivocal progres
sion’ of non measurable/non target disease, a source of confusion in the original RECISTguideline. Finally, a section on detection of new lesions, including the interpretation ofFDG PET scan assessment is included. Imaging guidance : the revised RECIST includes a
new imaging appendix with updated recommendations on the optimal anatomical assess
ment of lesions.

1. Background
1.1. History of RECIST criteria
Assessment of the change in tumour burden is an important
feature of the clinical evaluation of cancer therapeutics. Both
tumour shrinkage (objective response) and time to the development of disease progression are important endpoints in
cancer clinical trials. The use of tumour regression as the
endpoint for phase II trials screening new agents for evidence of anti tumour effect is supported by [CONTACT_337377], for many solid tumours, agentswhich produce tumour shrinkage in a proportion of patientshave a reasonable (albeit imperfect) chance of subsequentlydemonstrating an improvement in overall survival or othertime to event measures in randomised phase III studies (reviewed in [1 4] ). At the current time objective response car
ries with it a body of evidence greater than for any otherbiomarker supporting its utility as a measure of promising
treatment effect in phase II screening trials. Furthermore,
at both the phase II and phase III stage of drug development,clinical trials in advanced disease settings are increasinglyutilising time to progression (or progression free survival)as an endpoint upon which efﬁcacy conclusions are drawn,which is also based on anatomical measurement of tumoursize.
However, both of these tumour endpoints, objective re
sponse and time to disease progression, are useful only ifbased on widely accepted and readily applied standard criteria based on anatomical tumour burden. In 1981 the World
Health Organisation (WHO) ﬁrst published tumour response
criteria, mainly for use in trials where tumour response wasthe primary endpoint. The WHO criteria introduced the concept of an overall assessment of tumour burden by [CONTACT_337378].
5However, in the decades that
followed their publication, cooperative groups and pharmaceutical companies that used the WHO criteria often ‘modiﬁed’ them to accommodate new technologies or to addressareas that were unclear in the original document. This ledto confusion in interpretation of trial results
6and in fact,
the application of varying response criteria was shown to leadto very different conclusions about the efﬁcacy of the sameregimen.
7In response to these problems, an International
Working Party was formed in the mid 1990s to standardiseand simplify response criteria. New criteria, known as RECIST
(Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours), were pub
lished in 2000.
8Key features of the original RECIST include
deﬁnitions of minimum size of measurable lesions, instructions on how many lesions to follow (up to 10; a maximumﬁve per organ site), and the use of unidimensional, ratherthan bidimensional, measures for overall evaluation of tumour burden. These criteria have subsequently been widelyadopted by [CONTACT_337379], cooperative groups, andindustry for trials where the primary endpoints are objectiveresponse or progression. In addition, regulatory authoritiesaccept RECIST as an appropriate guideline for these
assessments.
1.2. Why update RECIST?
Since RECIST was published in 2000, many investigators have
conﬁrmed in prospective analyses the validity of substituting
unidimensional for bidimensional (and even three dimensional) based criteria (reviewed in [9]). With rare exceptions
(e.g. mesothelioma), the use of unidimensional criteria seemsto perform well in solid tumour phase II studies.
However, a number of questions and issues have arisen
which merit answers and further clarity. Amongst theseare whether fewer than 10 lesions can be assessed withoutaffecting the overall assigned response for patients (or theconclusion about activity in trials); how to apply RECIST inrandomised phase III trials where progression, not response,is the primary endpoint particularly if not all patients havemeasurable disease; whether or how to utilise newer imaging technologies such as FDG PET and MRI; how to handleassessment of lymph nodes; whether response conﬁrmationis truly needed; and, not least, the applicability of RECIST intrials of targeted non cytotoxic drugs. This revision of the
RECIST guidelines includes updates that touch on all these
points.E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R 45 (2009) [ADDRESS_416726] of the revision processwas to create a database of prospectively documented solidtumour measurement data obtained from industry and academic group trials. This database, assembled at the EORTCData Centre under the leadership of Jan Bogaerts and PatrickTherasse (co authors of this guideline), consists of >6500 patients with >18,[ADDRESS_416727] of a variety of questions (e.g. number of
target lesions required, the need for response conﬁrmation,
and lymph node measurement rules) on response and progression free survival outcomes. The results of this work,which after evaluation by [CONTACT_337380], are reportedin detail in a separate paper in this special issue.
10Larry Sch
wartz and Robert Ford (also co authors of this guideline) alsoprovided key databases from which inferences have beenmade that inform these revisions.
[ADDRESS_416728] elected to name [CONTACT_337405]1.1, rather than 2.0.
1.4. What about volumetric or functional assessment?
This raises the question, frequently posed, about whether it is
‘time’ to move from anatomic unidimensional assessment of
tumour burden to either volumetric anatomical assessment
orto functional assessment (e.g. dynamic contrast enhanced
MRI or CT or (18)F ﬂuorodeoxyglucose positron emissiontomographic (FDG PET) techniques assessing tumour metabolism). As can be seen, the Working Group and particularlythose involved in imaging research, did not believe that thereis at present sufﬁcient standardisation and widespread availability to recommend adoption of these alternative assessment methods. The only exception to this is in the use ofFDG PET imaging as an adjunct to determination of progression, as described later in this guideline. As detailed in paper
in this special issue
12, we believe that the use of these prom
ising newer approaches (which could either add to orsubstitute
foranatomical assessment as described in RECIST) requires
appropriate and rigorous clinical validation studies. This pa
per by [CONTACT_337381]. illustrates the type of data that will beneeded to be able to deﬁne ‘endpoints’ for these modalitiesand how to determine where and when such criteria/modalities can be used to improve the reliability with which trulyactive new agents are identiﬁed and truly inactive new agentsare discarded in comparison to RECIST criteria in phase IIscreening trials. The RECIST Working Group looks forwardto such data emerging in the next few years to allow theappropriate changes to the next iteration of the RECISTcriteria.
2. Purpose of this guideline
This guideline describes a standard approach to solid tumour
measurement and deﬁnitions for objective assessment ofchange in tumour size for use in adult and paediatric cancerclinical trials. It is expected these criteria will be useful in alltrials where objective response is the primary study endpoint,as well as in trials where assessment of stable disease, tu
mour progression or time to progression analyses are under
taken, since all of these outcome measures are based on anassessment of anatomical tumour burden and its change onstudy. There are no assumptions in this paper about the proportion of patients meeting the criteria for any of these endpoints which will signal that an agent or treatment regimen isactive: those deﬁnitions are dependent on type of cancer inwhich a trial is being undertaken and the speciﬁc agent(s) under study. Protocols must include appropriate statistical sections which deﬁne the efﬁcacy parameters upon which thetrial sample size and decision criteria are based. In addition
to providing deﬁnitions and criteria for assessment of tumour
response, this guideline also makes recommendationsregarding standard reporting of the results of trials that utilisetumour response as an endpoint.
While these guidelines may be applied in malignant brain
tumour studies, there are also separate criteria published forresponse assessment in that setting.
13This guideline is notin
tended for use for studies of malignant lymphoma sinceinternational guidelines for response assessment in lymphoma are published separately.
14
Finally, many oncologists in their daily clinical practice fol
low their patients’ malignant disease by [CONTACT_337382]. It isnot intended that these RECIST guidelines play a role in thatdecision making, except if determined appropriate by [CONTACT_337383].
3. Measurability of tumour at baseline
3.1. Deﬁnitions
At baseline, tumour lesions/lymph nodes will be categorised
measurable or non measurable as follows:
3.1.1. Measurable
Tumour lesions : Must be accurately measured in at least one
dimension ( longest diameter in the plane of measurement is
to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
•[ADDRESS_416729] scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than5 mm; see Appendix II on imaging guidance).
•10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesionswhich cannot be accurately measured with calipers should
be recorded as non measurable).
•[ADDRESS_416730] X ray.230 E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R 45 (2009) 228 247
Malignant lymph nodes: To be considered pathologically en
larged and measurable, a lymph node must be P15 mm in
short axis when assessed by [CONTACT_3610] (CT scan slice thickness
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and infollow up, only the short axis will be measured and followed
(see Schwartz et al. in this Special Issue
15). See also notes be
low on ‘Baseline documentation of target and non target le
sions’ for information on lymph node measurement.
3.1.2. Non-measurable
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter
<10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with P10 to <15 mm
short axis) as well as truly non measurable lesions. Lesions
considered truly non measurable include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inﬂammatorybreast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung,abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identiﬁed by[CONTACT_337384].
3.1.3. Special considerations regarding lesion measurability
Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treated
with local therapy require particular comment:
Bone lesions:.
•Bone scan, PET scan or plain ﬁlms are not considered ade
quate imaging techniques to measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to conﬁrm thepresence or disappearance of bone lesions.
•Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic blastic lesions, with identi
ﬁable soft tissue components , that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_337385]ﬁnition of measurability described above.
•Blastic bone lesions are non measurable.
Cystic lesions:.
•Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically deﬁnedsimple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions(neither measurable nor non measurable) since they are, by[INVESTIGATOR_5328]ﬁnition, simple cysts.
•‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases canbe considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the deﬁnition of measurability described above. However, if noncystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.
Lesions with prior local treatment:
•Tumour lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, orin an area subjected to other loco regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion. Study protocols shoulddetail the conditions under which such lesions would be
considered measurable.
3.2. Speciﬁcations by [CONTACT_12009]
3.2.1. Measurement of lesions
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation,
using calipers if clinically assessed. All baseline evaluationsshould be performed as close as possible to the treatment
start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning ofthe treatment.
3.2.2. Method of assessment
The same method of assessment and the same technique
should be used to characterise each identiﬁed and reportedlesion at baseline and during follow up. Imaging based evaluation should always be done rather than clinical examinationunless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but areassessable by [CONTACT_461].
Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered mea
surable when they are superﬁcial and P10 mm diameter as
assessed using calipers (e.g. skin nodules). For the case of skinlesions, documentation by [CONTACT_12151] a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is suggested. As notedabove, when lesions can be evaluated by [CONTACT_337386], imaging evaluation should be undertaken sinceit is more objective and may also be reviewed at the end of thestudy.
Chest X ray: Chest CT is preferred over chest X ray, particu
larly when progression is an important endpoint, since CT ismore sensitive than X ray, particularly in identifying new le
sions. However, lesions on chest X ray may be considered
measurable if they are clearly deﬁned and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. See Appendix II for more details.
CT, MRI: CT is the best currently available and reproducible
method to measure lesions selected for response assessment.This guideline has deﬁned measurability of lesions on CTscan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is5 mm or less. As is described in Appendix II , when CT scans
have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum sizefor a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for bodyscans). More details concerning the use of both CT and MRI
for assessment of objective tumour response evaluation are
provided in Appendix II .
Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion
size and should not be used as a method of measurement.Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for independent review at a later date and, becausethey are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed thatthe same technique and measurements will be taken fromone assessment to the next (described in greater detail inAppendix II). If new lesions are identiﬁed by [CONTACT_337387], conﬁrmation by [CONTACT_12154]. If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT,
MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.
Endoscopy, laparoscopy: The utilisation of these techniques for
objective tumour evaluation is not advised. However, they
can be useful to conﬁrm complete pathological responsewhen biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trialswhere recurrence following complete response or surgicalresection is an endpoint.
Tumour markers: Tumour markers alone cannot be used to as
sess objective tumour response. If markers are initially aboveE U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R 45 (2009) [ADDRESS_416731] normalise for a
patient to be considered in complete response. Becausetumour markers are disease speciﬁc, instructions for theirmeasurement should be incorporated into protocols on adisease speciﬁc basis. Speciﬁc guidelines for both CA 125response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) and PSA response (inrecurrent prostate cancer), have been published.
16–18In addi
tion, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA125progression criteria which are to be integrated with objectivetumour assessment for use in ﬁrst line trials in ovariancancer.
19
Cytology, histology: These techniques can be used to differenti
ate between PR and CR in rare cases if required by [CONTACT_990](for example, residual lesions in tumour types such as germcell tumours, where known residual benign tumours can remain). When effusions are known to be a potential adverseeffect of treatment (e.g. with certain taxane compounds orangiogenesis inhibitors), the cytological conﬁrmation of the
neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens dur
ing treatment can be considered if the measurable tumourhas met criteria for response or stable disease in order to differentiate between response (or stable disease) and progressive disease.
4. Tumour response evaluation
4.1. Assessment of overall tumour burden and
measurable disease
To assess objective response or future progression, it is nec
essary to estimate the overall tumour burden at baseline and
use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements.
Only patients with measurable disease at baseline shouldbe included in protocols where objective tumour responseis the primary endpoint. Measurable disease is deﬁned by[CONTACT_12155] (as detailedabove in Section 3). In studies where the primary endpoint
is tumour progression (either time to progression or propor
tion with progression at a ﬁxed date), the protocol must
specify if entry is restricted to those with measurable diseaseor whether patients having non measurable disease only arealso eligible.
4.2. Baseline documentation of ‘target’ and ‘non-target’
lesions
When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline
all lesions up to a maximum of ﬁve lesions total (and a max
imum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved
organs should be identiﬁed as target lesions and will be re
corded and measured at baseline (this means in instances
where patients have only one or two organ sites involved amaximum of two and four lesions respectively will be re
corded). For evidence to support the selection of only ﬁve target lesions, see analyses on a large prospective database inthe article by [CONTACT_150064].
10.
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size
(lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lendthemselves to reproducible repeated measurements .I tm a yb e
the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance thenext largest lesion which can be measured reproduciblyshould be selected. To illustrate this point see the examplein Fig. [ADDRESS_416732] in which the imageis obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane;
for MRI the plane of acquisition may be axial, saggital or
coronal). The smaller of these measures is the short axis.For example, an abdominal node which is reported as being20 mm ·30 mm has a short axis of 20 mm and qualiﬁes as a
malignant, measurable node. In this example, 20 mm shouldbe recorded as the node measurement (See also the examplein Fig. 4 in Appendix II ). All other pathological nodes (those
with short axis P10 mm but <15 mm) should be considered
non target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis <10 mmare considered non pathological and should not be recordedor followed.
Asum of the diameters (longest for non nodal lesions, short
axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculatedand reported as the baseline sum diameters . If lymph nodes
are to be included in the sum, then as noted above, only theshort axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters
will be used as reference to further characterise any objectivetumour regression in the measurable dimension of thedisease.
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological
lymph nodes should be identiﬁed as non target lesions and
should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not re
quired and these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘ab
sent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progression’ (more detailsto follow). In addition, it is possible to record multiple nontarget lesions involving the same organ as a single item onthe case record form (e.g. ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymphnodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’).
4.3. Response criteria
This section provides the deﬁnitions of the criteria used to
determine objective tumour response for target lesions.
4.3.1. Evaluation of target lesions
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions.
Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target ornon target) must have reduction in short axis to<10 mm.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of
diameters of target lesions, taking as reference thebaseline sum diameters.232 E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R 45 (2009) 228 247
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum
of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference
thesmallest sum on study (this includes the baseline
sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition tothe relative increase of 20%, the sum must also dem
onstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. ( Note:
the appearance of one or more new lesions is also
considered progression).
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufﬁcient shrinkage to qualify for
PR nor sufﬁcient increase to qualify for PD, taking asreference the smallest sum diameters while on study.
4.3.2. Special notes on the assessment of target lesions
Lymph nodes. Lymph nodes identiﬁed as target lesions should
always have the actual short axis measurement recorded (mea
sured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examina
tion), even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study. Thismeans that when lymph nodes are included as target lesions,the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if complete responsecriteria are met, since a normal lymph node is deﬁned as havinga short axis of <[ADDRESS_416733] achieve a short axis <10 mm. For PR,SD and PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes isto be included in the sum of target lesions.
Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’. While on
study, all lesions (nodal and non nodal) recorded at baselineshould have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g. 2 mm). However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes which are recordedas target lesions at baseline become so faint on CT scan thatthe radiologist may not feel comfortable assigning an exactmeasure and may report them as being ‘too small to measure’.When this occurs it is important that a value be recorded onthe case report form. If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_337331], the measurement should be
recorded as 0 mm. If the lesion is believed to be present and isfaintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mmshould be assigned ( Note: It is less likely that this rule will be
used for lymph nodes since they usually have a deﬁnable sizewhen normal and are frequently surrounded by [CONTACT_337388]; however, if a lymph node is believed tobe present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned in this circumstance aswell). This default value is derived from the [ADDRESS_416734] slicethickness (but should not be changed with varying CT slice
thickness). The measurement of these lesions is potentially
non reproducible, therefore providing this default value willprevent false responses or progressions based upon measurement error. To reiterate, however, if the radiologist isable to
provide an actual measure, that should be recorded, even ifit is below 5 mm.
Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment. As noted in Appen
dix II, when non nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together tocalculate the target lesion sum. Similarly, as lesions coalesce,
a plane between them may be maintained that would aid inobtaining maximal diameter measurements of each individ
ual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such that theyare no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameterin this instance should be the maximal longest diameter forthe ‘coalesced lesion’.
4.3.3. Evaluation of non-target lesions
This section provides the deﬁnitions of the criteriausedto deter
mine the tumour response for the group of non target lesions.While some non target lesions may actually be measurable,they need not be measured and instead should be assessed onlyqualitatively at the time points speciﬁed in the protocol.
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non target le
sions and normalisation of tumour marker level. Alllymph nodes must be non pathological in size(<10 mm short axis).
Non CR/Non PD: Persistence of one or more non target le
sion(s) and/or maintenance of tumour marker levelabove the normal limits.
Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression (see com
ments below) of existing non target lesions. ( Note:
the appearance of one or more new lesions is also
considered progression).
4.3.4. Special notes on assessment of progression of non-
target disease
The concept of progression of non target disease requires
additional explanation as follows:
When the patient also has measurable disease. In this setting,
to achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of the
non target disease, there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumourburden has increased sufﬁciently to merit discontinuationof therapy (see examples in Appendix II and further details
below). A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non target lesions is usually not sufﬁcient to quality for unequivocal
progression status. The designation of overall progression so
lelyon the basis of change in non target disease in the face of
SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.
When the patient has only non-measurable disease. This circum
stance arises in some phase III trials when it is not a criterion of
study entry to have measurable disease. The same general concepts apply here as noted above, however, in this instance thereis no measurable disease assessment to factor into the interpretation of an increase in non measurable disease burden.Because worsening in non target disease cannot be easilyquantiﬁed (by [INVESTIGATOR_5328]ﬁnition: if all lesions are truly non measur
able) a useful test that can be applied when assessing patients
for unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase inoverall disease burden based on the change in non measurabledisease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that wouldberequiredtodeclare PDfor measurabledisease: i.e. an increasein tumour burden representing an additional 73% increase in‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in ameasurable lesion). Examples include an increase in a pleuraleffusion from ‘trace’ to ‘large’, an increase in lymphangiticE U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R 45 (2009) 228 247 233
disease from localised to widespread, or may be described in
protocols as ‘sufﬁcient to require a change in therapy’. Someillustrative examples are shown in Figs. 5 and 6 in Appendix II .
If ‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, the patient should be considered to have had overall PD at that point. While it would beideal to have objective criteria to apply to non measurable disease, the very nature of that disease makes it impossible to do
so, therefore the increase must be substantial.
4.3.5. New lesions
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease
progression; therefore, some comments on detection of new
lesions are important. There are no speciﬁc criteria for theidentiﬁcation of new radiographic lesions; however, the ﬁnding of a new lesion should be unequivocal: i.e. not attributableto differences in scanning technique, change in imagingmodality or ﬁndings thought to represent something otherthan tumour (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be
simply healing or ﬂare of pre existing lesions). This is partic
ularly important when the patient’s baseline lesions showpartial or complete response. For example, necrosis of a liverlesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cysticlesion, which it is not.
A lesion identiﬁed on a follow up study in an anatomical
location that was notscanned at baseline is considered a new
lesion andwill indicate disease progression. An example of thisis the patient who has visceral disease at baseline and while onstudy has a CTor MRI brain ordered which reveals metastases.The patient’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence of
PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its
small size, continued therapy and follow up evaluation will
clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans conﬁrm there is deﬁnitely a new lesion, then progression shouldbe declared using the date of the initial scan.
While FDG PET response assessments need additional
study, it is sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use ofFDG PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessmentof progression (particularly possible ‘new’ disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG PET imaging can be identiﬁed
according to the following algorithm:
a. Negative FDG PET at baseline, with a positive
lFDG PET
at follow up is a sign of PD based on a new lesion.
b. No FDG PET at baseline and a positive FDG PET at fol
low up:
If the positive FDG PET at follow up corresponds to anew site of disease conﬁrmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.If the positive FDG PET at follow up is not conﬁrmed asa new site of disease on CT, additional follow up CTscans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will bethe date of the initial abnormal FDG PET scan).If the positive FDG PET at follow up corresponds to a
pre existing site of disease on CT that is not progress
ing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.4.4. Evaluation of best overall response
The best overall response is the best response recorded from
the start of the study treatment until the end of treatmenttaking into account any requirement for conﬁrmation. On oc
casion a response may not be documented until after the end
of therapy so protocols should be clear if post treatmentassessments are to be considered in determination of bestoverall response. Protocols must specify how any new therapyintroduced before progression will affect best response designation. The patient’s best overall response assignment willdepend on the ﬁndings of both target and non target diseaseand will also take into consideration the appearance of newlesions. Furthermore, depending on the nature of the studyand the protocol requirements, it may also require conﬁrmatory measurement (see Section 4.6). Speciﬁcally, in non ran
domised trials where response is the primary endpoint,conﬁrmation of PR or CR is needed to deem either one the‘best overall response’. This is described further below.
4.4.1. Time point response
It is assumed that at each protocol speciﬁed time point, a re
sponse assessment occurs. Table [ADDRESS_416735] non measurable (therefore non tar
get) disease only, Table 2 is to be used.
4.4.2. Missing assessments and inevaluable designation
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular
time point, the patient is not evaluable (NE) at that time point.If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at anassessment, usually the case is also considered NE at thattime point, unless a convincing argument can be made thatthe contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) wouldnot change the assigned time point response. This would bemost likely to happen in the case of PD. For example, if a pa
tient had a baseline sum of [ADDRESS_416736] overall response: all time points
The best overall response is determined once all the data for the
patient is known.
Best response determination in trials where conﬁrmation of com
plete or partial response IS NOT required : Best response in these
trials is deﬁned as the best response across all time points (for
example, a patient who has SD at ﬁrst assessment, PR at sec
ond assessment, and PD on last assessment has a best overallresponse of PR). When SD is believed to be best response, itmust also meet the protocol speciﬁed minimum time frombaseline. If the minimum time is not met when SD is otherwise the best time point response, the patient’s best responsedepends on the subsequent assessments. For example, a patient who has SD at ﬁrst assessment, PD at second and doesnot meet minimum duration for SD, will have a best responseof PD. The same patient lost to follow up after the ﬁrst SDassessment would be considered inevaluable.
lA ‘positive’ FDG PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid
with an uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue
on the attenuation corrected image.234 E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R 45 (2009) 228 247

disease , and 
a 'Non CR/non PD' is preferred over 'stable disease' for non target 
disease since SD is increasingly used as endpoint for assessment 
of efficacy in some trials so to assign this category when no 
lesions can be measured is not advised. 
Best response determination in trials where confirmation of com 
plete or partial response IS required: Complete or partial re 
sponses may be claimed only if the criteria for each are met at a subsequent time point as specified in the protocol (gener 
ally 4 weeks later). In this circumstance , the best overall re 
sponse can be interpreted as in Table 3. 
4.4.4. Special notes on response assessment 
When nodal disease is included in the sum of target lesions 
and the nodes decrease to 'normal' size (<10 mm), they may 
still have a measurement reported on scans . This measure 
ment should be recorded even though the nodes are normal 
in order not to overstate progression should it be based on 
increase in size of the nodes . As noted earlier, this means that 
patients with CR may not have a total sum of 'zero' on the 
case report form (CRF) . 
In trials where confirmation of response is required, re 
peated 'NE' time point assessments may complicate best re 
sponse determination. The analysis plan for the trial must 
address how missing data/assessments will be addressed in 
determination of response and progression. For example, in 
most trials it is reasonable to consider a patient with time 
point responses of PR NE PR as a confirmed response . 
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requir 
ing discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence 
of disease progression at that time should be reported as 
'symptomatic deterioration' . Every effort should be made to 
document objective progression even after discontinuation 
of treatment. Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor 
of an objective response : it is a reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_337332]. The objective response status of such patients is to be 
determined by [CONTACT_337389] 1 3. 
Conditions that define 'early progression, early death and 
inevaluability' are study specific and should be clearly de 
scribed in each protocol (depending on treatment duration , 
treatment periodicity) . 
In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish 
residual disease from normal tissue . When the evaluation of 
complete response depends upon this determination, it is 
recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine

a If a CR is truly met at first time point , then any disease seen at a subsequent time point , even disease meeting PR criteria relative to baseline , 
makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after CR). Best response would depend on whether minimum duration

needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) before assigning a status of complete
response. FDG PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CRin a manner similar to a biopsy in cases where a residualradiographic abnormality is thought to represent ﬁbrosis orscarring. The use of FDG PET in this circumstance should beprospectively described in the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_337390]ﬁc medical literature for the indication. However, it
must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to
false positive CR due to limitations of FDG PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.
For equivocal ﬁndings of progression (e.g. very small and
uncertain new lesions; cystic changes or necrosis in existinglesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduledassessment. If at the next scheduled assessment, progressionis conﬁrmed, the date of progression should be the earlierdate when progression was suspected.
4.5. Frequency of tumour re-evaluation
Frequency of tumour re evaluation while on treatment
should be protocol speciﬁc and adapted to the type and schedule of treatment. However, in the context of phase II studieswhere the beneﬁcial effect of therapy is not known, follow upevery 6 8 weeks (timed to coincide with the end of a cycle) isreasonable. Smaller or greater time intervals than these couldbe justiﬁed in speciﬁc regimens or circumstances. The protocol should specify which organ sites are to be evaluated atbaseline (usually those most likely to be involved with metastatic disease for the tumour type under study) and how often
evaluations are repeated. Normally, all target and non target
sites are evaluated at each assessment. In selected circumstances certain non target organs may be evaluated less frequently. For example, bone scans may need to be repeatedonly when complete response is identiﬁed in target diseaseor when progression in bone is suspected.
After the end of the treatment, the need for repetitive tu
mour evaluations depends on whether the trial has as a goalthe response rate or the time to an event (progression/death).If ‘time to an event’ (e.g. time to progression, disease freesurvival, progression free survival) is the main endpoint of
the study, then routine scheduled re evaluation of protocol
speciﬁed sites of disease is warranted. In randomised comparative trials in particular, the scheduled assessmentsshould be performed as identiﬁed on a calendar schedule(for example: every 6 8 weeks on treatment or every 3 4months after treatment) and should not be affected by [CONTACT_337391], drug holidays or any other events that might leadto imbalance in a treatment arm in the timing of diseaseassessment.
4.6. Conﬁrmatory measurement/duration of response
4.6.1. Conﬁrmation
In non randomised trials where response is the primary end
point, conﬁrmation of PR and CR is required to ensure re
sponses identiﬁed are not the result of measurement error.This will also permit appropriate interpretation of results inthe context of historical data where response has traditionallyrequired conﬁrmation in such trials (see the paper by [CONTACT_337392]. in this Special Issue
10). However, in all other circumstances, i.e. in randomised trials (phase II or III) or studieswhere stable disease or progression are the primary endpoints,conﬁrmation of response is not required since it will not add value to the interpretation of trial results. However, elimination ofthe requirement for response conﬁrmation may increase theimportance of central review to protect against bias, in particular in studies which are not blinded.
In the case of SD, measurements must have met the SD
criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval(in general not less than 6 8 weeks) that is deﬁned in thestudy protocol.
4.6.2. Duration of overall response
The duration of overall response is measured from the time
measurement criteria are ﬁrst met for CR/PR (whichever is ﬁrstrecorded) until the ﬁrst date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded on study).
The duration of overall complete response is measured
from the time measurement criteria are ﬁrst met for CR untilthe ﬁrst date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.
4.6.3. Duration of stable disease
Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment (in
randomised trials, from date of randomisation) until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest
sum on study (if the baseline sum is the smallest, this is the
reference for calculation of PD).
The clinical relevance of the duration of stable disease var
ies in different studies and diseases. If the proportion of patients achieving stable disease for a minimum period of timeis an endpoint of importance in a particular trial, the protocolshould specify the minimal time interval required betweentwo measurements for determination of stable disease.
Note: The duration of response and stable disease as well as
theprogression free survival are inﬂuenced by [CONTACT_337393]. It is not in the scope of thisguideline to deﬁne a standard follow up frequency. The frequency should take into account many parameters includingdisease types and stages, treatment periodicity and standard
practice. However, these limitations of the precision of the
measured endpoint should be taken into account if comparisons between trials are to be made.
4.7. Progression-free survival/proportion progression-free
4.7.1. Phase II trials
This guideline is focused primarily on the use of objective re
sponse endpoints for phase II trials. In some circumstances, ‘re
sponse rate’ may not be the optimal method to assess thepotential anticancer activity of new agents/regimens. In such
cases ‘progression free survival’ (PFS) or the ‘proportion pro
gression free’ at landmark time points, might be consideredappropriate alternatives to provide an initial signal of biologiceffect of new agents. It is clear, however, that in an uncontrolledtrial, these measures are subject to criticism since an apparently promising observation may be related to biological factorssuch as patient selection and not theimpact of theintervention.Thus, phase II screening trials utilising these endpoints are bestdesigned with a randomised control. Exceptions may exist236 E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R 45 (2009) 228 247
where the behaviour patterns of certain cancers are so consis
tent (and usually consistently poor), that a non randomisedtrial is justiﬁable (see for example van Glabbeke et al.
20). How
ever, in these cases it will be essential to document with carethe basis for estimating the expected PFS or proportion progression free in the absence of a treatment effect.
4.7.2. Phase III trials
Phase III trials in advanced cancers are increasingly designed
to evaluate progression free survival or time to progression asthe primary outcome of interest. Assessment of progressionis relatively straightforward if the protocol requires all patients to have measurable disease. However, restricting entryto this subset of patients is subject to criticism: it may resultin a trial where the results are less likely to be generalisable if,in the disease under study, a substantial proportion of patients would be excluded. Moreover, the restriction to entrywill slow recruitment to the study. Increasingly, therefore, tri
als allow entry of both patients with measurable disease as
well as those with non measurable disease only. In this circumstance, care must be taken to explicitly describe the ﬁndings which would qualify for progressive disease for thosepatients without measurable lesions. Furthermore, in this set
ting, protocols must indicate if the maximum number of recorded target lesions for those patients with measurabledisease may be relaxed from ﬁve to three (based on the datafound in Bogaerts et al.
10and Moskowitz et al.11). As found in
the ‘special notes on assessment of progression’, these guidelines offer recommendations for assessment of progression
in this setting. Furthermore, if available, validated tumour mar
ker measures of progression (as has been proposed for ovariancancer) may be useful to integrate into the deﬁnition of progression. Centralised blinded review of imaging studies or ofsource imaging reports to verify ‘unequivocal progression’may be needed if important drug development or drug approval decisions are to be based on the study outcome. Finally,as noted earlier, because the date of progression is subject toascertainment bias, timing of investigations in study armsshould be the same. The article by [CONTACT_337394]. in this specialissue
21provides a more detailed discussion of the assessment
of progression in randomised trials.
4.8. Independent review of response and progression
For trials where objective response (CR + PR) is the primary end
point, and in particular where key drug development decisions are based on the observation of a minimum number ofresponders, it is recommended that all claimed responses bereviewed by [CONTACT_13461](s) independent of the study. If the studyis a randomised trial, ideally reviewers should be blinded totreatment assignment. Simultaneous review of the patients’
ﬁles and radiological images is the best approach.
Independent review of progression presents some more
complex issues: for example, there are statistical problems
with the use of central review based progression time inplace of investigator based progression time due to the potential introduction of informative censoring when the formerprecedes the latter. An overview of these factors and otherlessons learned from independent review is provided in anarticle by [CONTACT_337395]. in this special issue.
224.9. Reporting best response results
4.9.1. Phase II trials
When response is the primary endpoint, and thus all patients
must have measurable disease to enter the trial, all patients
included in the study must be accounted for in the report of
the results, even if there are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are not evaluable. Each patient will be assignedone of the following categories:
1. Complete response2. Partial response3. Stable disease4. Progression5. Inevaluable for response: specify reasons (for example: early
death, malignant disease; early death, toxicity; tumourassessments not repeated/incomplete; other (specify)).
Normally, all eligible patients should be included in the
denominator for the calculation of the response rate for phaseII trials (in some protocols it will be appropriate to include all
treated patients). It is generally preferred that 95% two sided
conﬁdence limits are given for the calculated response rate.Trial conclusions should be based on the response rate forall eligible (or all treated) patients and should notbe based
on a selected ‘evaluable’ subset.
4.9.2. Phase III trials
Response evaluation in phase III trials may be an indicator
of the relative anti tumour activity of the treatments evaluated and is almost always a secondary endpoint. Observed differences in response rate may not predict theclinically relevant therapeutic beneﬁt for the populationstudied. If objective response is selected as a primary endpoint for a phase III study (only in circumstances where adirect relationship between objective tumour response anda clinically relevant therapeutic beneﬁt can be unambigu
ously demonstrated for the population studied), the same
criteria as those applying to phase II trials should be usedand all patients entered should have at least one measurable lesion.
In those many cases where response is a secondary end
point and not all trial patients have measurable disease, themethod for reporting overall best response rates must bepre speciﬁed in the protocol. In practice, response rate maybe reported using either an ‘intent to treat’ analysis (all randomised patients in the denominator) or an analysis whereonly the subset of patients with measurable disease atbaseline are included. The protocol should clearly specify
how response results will be reported, including any subset
analyses that are planned.
The original version of RECIST suggested that in phase III
trials one could write protocols using a ‘relaxed’ interpretation of the RECIST guidelines (for example, reducing the number of lesions measured) but this should no longer be donesince these revised guidelines have been amended in such away that it is clear how these criteria should be applied forall trials in which anatomical assessment of tumour responseor progression are endpoints.E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R 45 (2009) [ADDRESS_416738]: 10 mm spi[INVESTIGATOR_23585]

Appendix II. Speciﬁcations for standard
anatomical radiological imaging
These protocols for image acquisition of computed tomogra
phy (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are recommendations intended for patients on clinical trials where
RECIST assessment will be performed. Standardisation ofimaging requirements and image acquisition parameters isideal to allow for optimal comparability of subjects within astudy and results between studies. These recommendationsare designed to balance optimised image acquisition protocols with techniques that should be feasible to perform glob
ally at imaging facilities in all types of radiology practices.
These guidelines are not applicable to functional imagingtechniques or volumetric assessment of tumour size.
Scanner quality control is highly recommended and should
follow standard manufacturer and facility maintenanceschedules using commercial phantoms. It is likely that for RECIST unidimensional measurements this will be adequate toproduce reproducible measurements. Imaging quality controlfor CT includes an analysis of image noise and uniformity andCT number as well as spatial resolution. The frequency ofquality control analysis is also variable and should focus on
clinically relevant scanning parameters. Dose analysis is al
ways important and the use of imaging should follow theALARA principle, ‘As Low As Reasonably Achievable’, whichrefers to making every reasonable effort to maintain radiationexposures as far below the dose limits as possible.
Speciﬁc notes
Chest X ray measurement of lesions surrounded by [CONTACT_337397], but not preferable as themeasurement represents a summation of densities. Further
more, there is poor identiﬁcation of new lesions within the
chest on X ray as compared with CT. Therefore, measurements of pulmonary parenchymal lesions as well as mediastinal disease are optimally performed with CT of the chest.MRI of the chest should only be performed in extenuating circumstances. Even if IV contrast cannot be administered (forexample, in the situation of allergy to contrast), a non contrast CT of the chest is still preferred over MRI or chest X ray.
CT scans: CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis should
be contiguous throughout all the anatomic region of interest.As a general rule, the minimum size of a measurable lesion at
baseline should be no less than double the slice thickness and
also have a minimum size of 10 mm (see below for minimumsize when scanners have a slice thickness more than 5 mm).While the precise physics of lesion size and partial volumeaveraging is complex, lesions smaller than [ADDRESS_416742] studies, they should still be measured.Lesions which are reported as ‘too small to measure’ shouldbe assigned a default measurement of [ADDRESS_416743] administration, slice thickness, and reconstruction interval.
a.Anatomic coverage: Optimal anatomic coverage for mostsolid tumours is the chest, abdomen and pelvis. Coverage should encompass all areas of known predilectionfor metastases in the disease under evaluation and240 E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R 45 (2009) [ADDRESS_416744] administration : Optimal visualisation and
measurement of metastases in solid tumours requiresconsistent administration (dose and rate) of IV contrastas well as timing of scanning. T ypi[INVESTIGATOR_897], most abdominal imaging is performed during the portal venousphase and (optimally) about the same time frame afterinjection on each examination (see Fig. [ADDRESS_416745] on lesion measurement).Most solid tumours may be scanned with a singlephase after administration of contrast. While triphasicCT scans are sometimes performed on other types ofvascular tumours to improve lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], forconsistency and uniformity, we would recommend triphasic CT for hepatocellular and neuroendocrinetumours for which this scanning protocol is generallystandard of care, and the improved temporal resolutionof the triphasic scan will enhance the radiologists’ ability to consistently and reproducibly measure these
lesions. The precise dose and rate of IV contrast is
dependent upon the CT scanning equipment, CT acquisition protocol, the type of contrast used, the availablevenous access and the medical condition of thepatient. Therefore, the method of administration ofintravenous contrast agents is variable. Rather thantry to institute rigid rules regarding methods foradministering contrast agents and the volume injected,it is appropriate to suggest that an adequate volume ofa suitable contrast agent should be given so that themetastases are demonstrated to best effect and a con
sistent method is used on subsequent examinations for
any given patient (ideally, this would be speciﬁed inthe protocol or for an institution). It is very importantthat the same technique be used at baseline and on follow up examinations for a given patient. This willgreatly enhance the reproducibility of the tumour measurements. If prior to enrolment it is known a patient isnot able to undergo CT scans with IV contrast due toallergy or renal insufﬁciency, the decision as to
whether a non contrast CT or MRI (with or without IV
contrast) should be used to evaluate the subject atbaseline and follow up should be guided by [CONTACT_337398]. For patients who develop contraindications to contrast after baseline contrast CT is done,the decision as to whether non contrast CT or MRI(enhanced or non enhanced) should be performedshould also be based on the tumour type, anatomiclocation of the disease and should be optimised toallow for comparison to the prior studies if possible.
Each case should be discussed with the radiologist to
determine if substitution of these other approaches ispossible and, if not, the patient should be considerednot evaluable from that point forward. Care must betaken in measurement of target lesions on a differentmodality and interpretation of non target disease ornew lesions, since the same lesion may appear to havea different size using a new modality (see Fig. [ADDRESS_416746] and MRI of the same lesion). Oralcontrast is recommended to help visualise and differentiate structures in the abdomen.
c.Slice thickness and reconstruction interval: RECIST measurements may be performed at most clinically obtainedslice thicknesses. It is recommended that CT scans beperformed at [ADDRESS_416747] on lesion measurement and on detection ofnew lesions. However, consideration should also begiven for minimising radiation exposure. With theseparameters, a minimum 10 mm lesion is considered
measurable at baseline. Occasionally, institutions may
perform medically acceptable scans at slice thicknessesgreater than 5 mm. If this occurs, the minimum size of
measurable lesions at baseline should be twice the slice

FDG PET has gained acceptance as a valuable tool for
detecting, staging and restaging several malignancies. Criteriafor incorporating (or substituting) FDG PET into anatomicalassessment of tumour response in phase II trials are not yetavailable, though much research is ongoing. Nevertheless,FDG PET is being used in many drug development trials bothas a tool to assess therapeutic efﬁcacy and also in assessmentof progression. If FDG PET scans are included in a protocol, by[CONTACT_21128], an FDG uptake period of [ADDRESS_416749] injection. PET camera speciﬁcations arevariable and manufacturer speciﬁc, so every attempt shouldbe made to use the same scanner, or the same model scanner,for serial scans on the same patient. Whole body acquisitionscan be performed in either 2 or 3 dimensional mode with
attenuation correction, but the method chosen should be con
sistent across all patients and serial scans in the clinical trial.
PET/CT scans : Combined modality scanning such as with
PET CT is increasingly used in clinical care, and is a modality/technology that is in rapid evolution; therefore, the recommendations in this paper may change rather quickly withtime. At present, low dose or attenuation correction CT portions of a combined PET CT are of limited use in anatomicallybased efﬁcacy assessments and it is therefore suggested thatthey should not be substituted for dedicated diagnostic contrast enhanced CT scans for anatomically based RECIST mea
surements. However, if a site can document that the CTperformed as part of a PET CT is of identical diagnostic qual
ity to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast) then the CTportion of the PET CT can be used for RECIST measurements.Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinelyor serially performed.
Ultrasound examinations should not be used in clinical trials
to measure tumour regression or progression of lesions be
cause the examination is necessarily subjective and operator
dependent. The reasons for this are several: Entire examinations cannot be reproduced for independent review at a laterdate, and it must be assumed, whether or not it is the case,that the hard copy ﬁlms available represent a true and accurate reﬂection of events. Furthermore, if, for example, theonly measurable lesion is in the para aortic region of theabdomen and if gas in the bowel overlies the lesion, the lesionwill not be detected because the ultrasound beam cannotpenetrate the gas. Accordingly, the disease staging (or restaging for treatment evaluation) for this patient will not be
accurate.
While evaluation of lesions by [CONTACT_337399], it is permitted when lesions are
superﬁcial, at least [ADDRESS_416750], spatial and temporal resolution; however, thereare many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which
greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_337336]. Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variableglobally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technicalspeciﬁcations of the scanning sequences used should beoptimised for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow upshould be the same as was used at baseline and the lesionsshould be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.Generally, axial imaging of the abdomen and pelvis with T1and T2 weighted imaging along with gadolinium enhancedimaging should be performed. The ﬁeld of view, matrix,
number of excitations, phase encode steps, use of fat sup
pression and fast sequences should be optimised for the spe

ciﬁc body part being imaged as well as the scanner utilised. It
is beyond the scope of this document or appendix to prescribe speciﬁc MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts and diseases. Ideally, the same type ofscanner should be used and the image acquisition protocolshould be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Bodyscans should be performed with breath hold scanning tech
niques if possible.
Selection of target lesions : In general, the largest lesions rep
resentative of involved organs (up to a maximum of two per
organ and ﬁve total) are selected to follow as target lesions.However, in some cases, the largest lesions may not be easilymeasured and are not suitable for follow up because of theirconﬁguration. In these cases, identiﬁcation of the largest most
reproducible lesions is advised. Fig. [ADDRESS_416751] and follow:
Measurement of lesions
The longest diameter of selected lesions should be measured
in the plane in which the images were acquired. For body CT,this is the axial plane. In the event isotropic reconstructionsare performed, measurements can be made on these reconstructed images; however, it should be cautioned that notall radiology sites are capable of producing isotropic reconstructions. This could lead to the undesirable situation ofmeasurements in the axial plane at one assessment pointand in a different plane at a subsequent assessment. There
are some tumours, for instance paraspi[INVESTIGATOR_18179], which
are better measured in the coronal or sagittal plane. It wouldbe acceptable to measure these lesions in these planes if thereconstructions in those planes were isotropic or the imageswere acquired with MRI in those planes. Using the same planeof evaluation, the maximal diameter of each target lesionshould always be measured at subsequent follow up timepoints even if this results in measuring the lesion at a different slice level or in a different orientation or vector comparedwith the baseline study. Software tools that calculate the
maximal diameter for a perimeter of a tumour may be em
ployed and may even reduce variability.
The only exception to the longest diameter rule is lymph
node measurement. Because malignant nodes are identiﬁedby [CONTACT_337400], this is the guide used todetermine not only whether they are pathological but is alsothe dimension measured for adding into the sum of target lesions. Fig. 4 illustrates this point: the large arrow identiﬁes a
malignant node: the shorter perpendicular axis is P15 mm
and will be recorded. Close by (small arrow) there is a normalnode: note here the long axis is greater than 10 mm but the
short axis is well below 10 mm. This node should be consid
ered non pathological.
If a lesion disappears and reappears at a subsequent time
point it should continue to be measured. However, the patient’s response at the point in time when the lesion reappears will depend upon the status of his/her other lesions.For example, if the patient’s tumour had reached a CR statusand the lesion reappeared, then the patient would be considered PD at the time of reappearance. In contrast, if the tumourstatus was a PR or SD and one lesion which had disappearedthen reappears, its maximal diameter should be added to the
sum of the remaining lesions for a calculated response: in
other words, the reappearance of an apparently ‘disappeared’single lesion amongst many which remain is not in itself en
Fig. 3 – Largest lesion may not be most reproducible: most reproducible should be selected as target. In this example, theprimary gastric lesion (circled at baseline and at follow-up in the top two images) may be able to be measured with thinsection volumetric CT with the same degree of gastric distention at baseline and follow-up. However, this is potentiallychallenging to reproduce in a multicentre trial and if attempted should be done with careful imaging input and analysis. Themost reproducible lesion is a lymph node (circled at baseline and at follow-up in the bottom two images).E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R 45 (2009) 228 247 243
ough to qualify for PD: that requires the sum of all lesions to
meet the PD criteria. The rationale for such a categorisation isbased upon the realisation that most lesions do not actually‘disappear’ but are not visualised because they are beyondthe resolving power of the imaging modality employed.
The identiﬁcation of the precise boundary deﬁnition of a
lesion may be difﬁcult especially when the lesion is embedded in an organ with a similar contrast such as the liver, pancreas, kidney, adrenal or spleen. Additionally, peritumouraloedema may surround a lesion and may be difﬁcult to distinguish on certain modalities between this oedema and actualtumour. In fact, pathologically, the presence of tumour cellswithin the oedema region is variable. Therefore, it is mostcritical that the measurements be obtained in a reproducible
manner from baseline and all subsequent follow up time
points. This is also a strong reason to consistently utilisethe same imaging modality.
When lesions ‘fragment’, the individual lesion diameters
should be added together to calculate the target lesionsum. Similarly, as lesions coalesce, a plane between themmay be maintained that would aid in obtaining maximaldiameter measurements of each individual lesion. If the lesions have truly coalesced such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instanceshould be the maximal longest diameter for the ‘merged
lesion’.
Progression of non-target lesions
To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ there must be an overall
level of substantial worsening in non target disease that is of
a magnitude that, even in the presence of SD or PR in targetdisease, the treating physician would feel it important tochange therapy. Examples of unequivocal progression areshown in Figs. 5 and 6 .

Appendix III. Frequently asked questions
Question Answer
What should be done if several unique lesions at
baseline become conﬂuent at a follow up
evaluation?Measure the longest diameter of the conﬂuent mass and record to add into the sum of
the longest diameters
How large does a new lesion have to be to countas progression? Does any small subcentimetre
lesion qualify, or should the lesion be at least
measurable?New lesions do not need to meet ‘measurability criteria’ to be considered valid. If it isclear on previous images (with the same technique) that a lesion was absent then its
deﬁnitive appearance implies progression. If there is any doubt (because of the
techniques or conditions) then it is suggested that treatment continue until nextscheduled assessment when, generally, all should be clear. Either it gets bigger and the
date of progression is the date of the ﬁrst suspi[INVESTIGATOR_2798], or it disappears and one may then
consider it an artefact with the support of the radiologists
How should one lesion be measured if on
subsequent exams it is split into two?Measure the longest diameter of each lesion and add this into the sum
Does the deﬁnition of progression depend on
the status of all target lesions or only one?As per the RECIST 1.1 guideline, progression requires a 20% increase in the sum ofdiameters of all target lesions AND a minimum absolute increase of [ADDRESS_416752] criteria accepted by [CONTACT_337401]?Many cooperative groups and members of pharma were involved in preparing RECIST1.[ADDRESS_416753] adopted them. The FDA was consulted in their development and supportstheir use, though they don’t require it. The European and Canadian regulatory
authorities also participated and the RECIST criteria are now integrated in the European
note for guidance for the development of anticancer agents. Many pharmaceuticalcompanies are also using them. RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_416754] slice thickness is >5 mm?RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_416755] a maximum slice thickness of 5 mm and theminimum size for a measurable lesion is twice that: 10 mm (even if slice thickness is
<5 mm). If scanners with slice thickness >[ADDRESS_416756] when target lesions
become so small they are below the 10 mm
‘measurable’ size?Target lesion measurability is deﬁned at baseline. Thereafter, actual measurements,
even if <10 mm, should be recorded. If lesions become very small, some radiologists
indicate they are ‘too small to measure’. This guideline advises that when this occurs, ifthe lesion is actually still present, a default measurement of [ADDRESS_416757]
decreased in size to meet PR criteria and one
has actually disappeared, does that patient havePD if the ‘disappeared’ lesion reappears?Unless the sum meets the PD criteria, the reappearance of a lesion in the setting of PR (or
SD) is not PD. The lesion should simply be added into the sum.
If the patients had had a CR, clearly reappearance of an absent lesion would qualify forPD
When measuring the longest diameter of targetlesions in response to treatment, is the sameaxis that was used initially used subsequently,
even if there is a shape change to the lesion that
may have produced a new longest diameter?The longest diameter of the lesion should always be measured even if the actual axis isdifferent from the one used to measure the lesion initially (or at different time pointduring follow up)
The only exception to this is lymph nodes: as per RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_416758] been selected at baselineand followed but then one of these targetlesions then becomes non evaluable (i.e.different technique used)What may be done in such cases is one of the following:
What is the effect this has on the other targetlesions and the overall response?(a) If the patient is still being treated, call the centre to be sure that future evaluations aredone with the baseline technique so at least SOME courses are fully evaluable(b) If that is not possible, check if there IS a baseline exam by [CONTACT_337402]...in which case if you retrieve the baseline measures from
that technique you retrieve the lesion evaluability
(c) If neither (a) nor (b) is possible then it is a judgement call about whether you deletethe lesion from all forms or consider the impact of the lesion overall is so important that
its being non evaluable makes the overall response interpretation inevaluable without
it. Such a decision should be discussed in a review panelIt is NOT recommended that the lesion be included in baseline sums and then excludedfrom follow up sums since this biases in favour of a response

Question Answer
What if a single non target lesion cannot be reviewed, for
whatever reason; does this negate the overall assessment?Sometimes the major contribution of a single non target lesion may be inthe setting of CR having otherwise been achieved: failure to examine one
non target in that setting will leave you unable to claim CR. It is also
possible that the non target lesion has undergone such substantialprogression that it would override the target disease and render patientPD. However, this is very unlikely, especially if the rest of the measurable
disease is stable or responding
A patient has a 32% decrease in sum cycle 2, a 28% decrease cycle4 and a 33% decrease cycle 6. Does conﬁrmation of PR have to
take place in sequential scans or is a case like this conﬁrmed PR?It is not infrequent that tumour shrinkage hovers around the 30% mark.
In this case, most would consider PR to have been conﬁrmed looking at
this overall case. Had there been two or three non PR observationsbetween the two time point PR responses, the most conservativeapproach would be to consider this case SD
In the setting of a breast cancer neoadjuvant study, wouldmammography not be used to assess lesions? Is CT preferred inthis setting?Neither CT nor mammography are optimal in this setting. MRI is thepreferred modality to follow breast lesions in a neoadjuvant setting
A patient has a lesion measurable by [CONTACT_337403]. Which should be followed?CT scan. Always follow by [CONTACT_337404]ﬁed
A lesion which was solid at baseline has become necrotic in thecentre. How should this be measured?The longest diameter of the entire lesion should be followed. Eventually,necrotic lesions which are responding to treatment decrease in size. Inreporting the results of trials, you may wish to report on this
phenomenon if it is seen frequently since some agents (e.g. angiogenesis
inhibitors) may produce this effect
If I am going to use MRI to follow disease, what is minimum size
for measurability?MRI may be substituted for contrast enhanced CT for some sites, but notlung. The minimum size for measurability is the same as for CT (10 mm)
as long as the scans are performed with slice thickness of [ADDRESS_416763]? At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a
combined PET CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for usewith RECIST measurements. However, if your site has documented thatthe CT performed as part of a PET CT is of the same diagnostic quality as
a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast) then the PET CT can be used
for RECIST measurements. Note, however, that the PET portion of the CTintroduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is notroutinely or serially performed246 E U R O P E A NJ O U R N A LO FC A N C E R 45 (2009) [ADDRESS_416764], Cascino TL, Schold Jr SC, Cairncross JG.

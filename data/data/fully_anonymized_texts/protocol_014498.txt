Sepsis is a life-threatening disease for which there are no effective treatments. It results from metabolic 
and immunologic derangements that lead to organ dysfunction, shock and sometimes death. Both "good" (high 
density lipoprotein, HDL -C) and "bad" (low density lip oprotein, LDL -C) cholesterol should protect against 
sepsis by [CONTACT_504498]  
(protective in shock ). However, for partially unknown reasons, cholesterol levels drop to critical ly low levels in 
early sepsis  (first 48 hours) , leaving the body defenseless  against sepsis via these mechanisms. A fish -oil lipid  
injectable emulsion  is FDA -approved for septic and critically ill patients that may be capable of elevating serum 
cholesterol  levels. We hypothesize that fish oil lipid injectable emulsion administration  to critically ill 
septic patients will improve quantitative and qualitative lipid measures, provide substrate for bacterial 
toxin clearance and steroid synthesis, and lead to improvements in early organ function and mortality.  
This phase II randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_29833], proposes to assess the drug ’s ability to optimally , transiently  
elevate cholesterol and preliminary measures of biological activity and clinical outcomes. This novel LIPid 
Intensive Drug therapy for Sepsis Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] (LIPI[INVESTIGATOR_16852] -P) clinical trial is the first study to attempt to transiently 
elevate cholesterol levels as a treatment modality in  critically ill septic patients  and will form the basis 
of a future  Phase III  randomized, controlled trial . 
  
08/13/[ADDRESS_649635] improved short -term in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380], persistent immunologic and metabolic 
derangements may lead to long -term organ dysfunction and late mortality. (Guirgis et al., 2014)  In addition, 
early organ failur e predicts death and subsequent chronic critical illness. (Levy et al., 2005; Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_70040]., 
2006)  Novel early treatments for sepsis are needed to improve long -term outcomes.  
 Circulating lipoproteins play an important role in sepsis.  Cholesterol plays an important  role in sepsis 
and levels of both LDL -C and HDL-C are dynamically regulated in sepsis. Cholesterol is considered protective 
for its ability to bind and clear bacterial toxins, its anti -inflammatory properties, and is needed for steroid 
synthesis in stress ful conditions. However, our research team has observed that lipid dysregulation occurs in 
early sepsis  resulting in loss of cholesterol’s protective effects.  We have demonstrated in sepsis that: 1) 
cholesterol levels drop precipi[INVESTIGATOR_504471], and drop -severity predicts death (Guirgis, Dodani, et al., 2017) ; 2) low 
baseline LDL -C levels are associated with increased long -term community -acquired sepsis risk (Guirgis, 
Donnelly, et al., 2016) , and  3) inflammation leads to pro -inflammatory, dysfunctional cholesterol, which predicts 
organ failure and adverse outcomes. (Guirgis, Dodani, et al., 2017; Guirgis, Leeuwenburg h, et al., 2017)  Our 
research and others strongly suggest that the drastic cholesterol reduction and pro -inflammatory lipid 
alterations seen in early sepsis are linked to early organ failure and poor outcomes. (J.-Y. Chien, Jerng, Yu, & 
Yang, 2005a; Y. -F. Chien, Chen, Hsu, Chen, & Yu, 2015; Guirgis, Dodani, et al., 2017)  However, it is unknown 
whether attempting to elevate cholesterol levels in septic patients will improve clinical outcomes.  
 We propose to address this gap in evidence via an interdisciplinary, multi -institution  partnership  (UF 
Health Jacksonville (UF -JAX) , UF Sepsis and Critical Illness Research Center  (SCIRC) , & UCLA) and a pi[INVESTIGATOR_504472]-P (LIPid Inten sive Drug therapy for Sepsis - Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]).  A novel lipid injectable 
emulsion (LIE) containing 15% fish oil is FDA -approved for nutritional purposes among septic and critically ill 
patients  and may have the ability to raise cholesterol levels and will be tested  in septic patients. Furthermore, 
lipid therapi[INVESTIGATOR_504473] a top ten area for clinical testing in septic shock by [CONTACT_504499]. (Perner et al., 2017)   
The rationale for this randomized clinical trial (RCT)  is two -fold: (i) LIE may provide substrate for 
cholesterol synthesis and essential free fatty aci ds as metabolic fuel during septic stress, and (ii) fish oil LIE 
contains potent anti -inflammatory ω -[ADDRESS_649636] been associated with improved organ function and 
reduced mortality in sepsis. (Hall et al., 2015)  Supporting rationale (i), a multi -center RCT of a phospholipid 
emulsion for gram -negative severe sepsis (Dellinger et al., 2009)  initially demonstrated no effect on mortality, 
but when limited to patients with albumin ≥ 1.5 g/dL, and cholesterol ≥ 40 mg/dL or HDL-C ≥ 20 mg/dL, 
demonstrated sepsis mortality reductions of 6.6% (p < 0.025) and 10.8% (p< 0.005), respectively .(“Parker TS,” 
n.d.) That study establishes that adequate liver function and a minimum quantity of cholesterol are needed for 
effective lipid -mediated defense against sepsis. Supporting rationale (ii), a RCT of IV 10% fish oil  in 60 ICU 
sepsis patients showed significant impro vements in organ failure (all sepsis ) and improved mortality (sub -
population) compared to placebo. (Hall et al., 2015)  Therefore, the central hypothesis  is that fish oil LIE will 
improve quantitative and qualitative lipid measures, provide substrate for bacterial toxin clearance and 
steroid synthesis, and lead to improvements in  early organ function and mortality in sepsis patients. 
Our group has demonstrated access to the patient population needed for this study. In a n ongoing 
collaborative study between UF JAX and the UF SCIRC , 120 of 223  (54%) sepsis patients met proposed 
enrollment criteria including total cholesterol ≤ 100 mg/dL.  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_504474] a multicenter 
clinical trial (R01)  and has the following specific aims:  
 
Aim 1: Test if early fish oil LIE in sepsis patients will lead to achievement of 48 -hour total cholesterol 
goals compared to controls . Recruit 48  moderate organ -failure sepsis patients  with adequate liver function 
(albumin > 1.5 mg/dL, total bilirubin < 2 mg/dL) within 24h of sepsis recognition and obtain demographics, 
interventions, an d quantitative and qualitative cholesterol measures. Because we will use the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s Sepsis 
Alert system, there may be up to 1084 subjects screened for inclusion in the study. For the Phase II  trial, 48 
patients will be randomized to LIE (24 patients) o r active control (24 patients - no drug). Quantitative lipid 
measures (total cholesterol, LDL -C, HDL -C, triglycerides) will be measured (upon enrollment, 48h, 72h, and 7d 
after drug) to assess the ability of LIE to achieve delta total cholesterol (48 -hr – enrollment) of 0 to +5 mg/dL 
based on preliminary data.  
 
08/13/2021   4 of 19  Aim 2: Test if sepsis patients will have a reduction in lipid oxidation measures,  and improvements in 
HDL function, cumulative organ failure, and 28 -day mortality after fish oil LIE versus controls.  In 48  
patients (Aim 1), the following will be collected at enrollment, 48h and 7d after enrollment : (i) lipid oxidation 
(cell free assay), (ii) HDL function (cholesterol efflux assay), (iii) SOFA score, and ( iv) 28-day mortality.  
 
2.0 BACKGROUND AND SIGN IFICANCE  
2.1 Sepsis is common, costly, and deadly. Recent published US estimates report up to 850,000 ED sepsis 
visits per year (Wang, Jones, & Donnelly, 2017)  costing nearly 17 billion dollars. Sepsis is also lethal, resulting 
in death in approximately one of every four cases and nearly 215,000 deaths per year in the US. (Angus et al., 
2001)   
2.2 Sepsis causes organ dysfunction which leads to chronic critical illness and death.  In a pros pective 
study of 115 sepsis patients from the UF Health Jacksonville (UF JAX) ED, 63% had organ dysfunction on 
admission, which was still present in 27% of survivors at 28 -90 days. Notably, in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_400075] 20%, 
but long -term mortality was 47% at 3 years .(Guirgis, Brakenridge, et al., 2016)  The UF Sepsis and Critical 
Illness Research Center (P50 GM111152 -02) has descri bed chron ic critical illness (CCI) in intensive care unit 
(ICU)  patients with sepsis,  characterized by [CONTACT_504500] ≥ 14 days, progressive cachexia, manageable organ 
dysfunction, and frequent indolent death. (Gentile et al., 2012; Mira et al., 2016)  Clinical  trajectories were early 
death (12%), rapid recovery (RAP) (29%), and CCI (59%).  
2.3 Preventing and limiting early organ dysfunction may prevent CCI and death. Early organ failure is 
strongly predictive of both progression to CCI and death. (Levy et al., 2005 ; Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_70040]., 2006)  SOFA score is 
a validated measure of organ dysfunction that directly relates to mortality (Angus et al., 2001; Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_70040]., 
2006)  and is used  as an endpoint in clinical trials. (Marshall e t al., 2005; Vincent, 2004)  Furthermore, 
our group has demonstrated that early SOFA elevation is predictive of persistent organ dysfunction, and that 
early and post -resuscitation organ failure is also highly predictive of progression to CCI .(Guirgis et al., 2014; 
Stortz et al., 2017)   
2.[ADDRESS_649637] sepsis. Specifically LDL -C facilitates bacterial 
toxin clearance in sepsis via hepatic LDL receptors or 
via HDL (reverse cholesterol transport). (Boyd et al., 
2016; Feingold & Grunfeld, 1997; Weerapan 
Khovidhunkit et al., 2004; Walley et al., 2014)  High 
density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL -C) is protective 
against sepsis by [CONTACT_244112]: i) bacterial toxin 
binding, (Catapano, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_293756], Bonacina, & Norata, 2014; W 
Khovidhunkit et al., 2004)  ii) suppression of 
inflammatory  cell migration, iii) prevention of 
inflammatory cytokine release, (Murphy et al., 2008, 
2011)  and inhibition of vascular and intercellular 
adhesion molecules expression, (Heitzer, Schlinzig, 
Krohn, Meinertz, & Münzel, 2001; Rosenson et al., 2015)  and iv) stimulation of  endogenous corticosteroid 
release .(Guo et al., 2013, 2014)   
2.[ADDRESS_649638] 3 days (Figure 1). Conversely, survivors have higher baseline levels, which increase early after 
admission (223 UF sepsis patients). In addition, l ow LDL -C, total cholesterol , and HDL -C levels are associated 
with increased s epsis risk and poor outcomes after sepsis. (J.-Y. Chien, Jerng, Yu, & Yang, 2005b; Y. -F. Chien 
et al., 2015; Guirgis, Donnelly, et al., 2016; Lagrost et al ., 2014; van Leeuwen et al., 2003)  Decreased 
cholesterol levels also predict  organ dysfunction and death  from sepsis .(Weerapan Khovidhunkit et al., 2004)   
 
3.[ADDRESS_649639] time a potential therapy which enhances reverse cholesterol transport to clear bacterial toxins. Reverse 
cholesterol transport is the process by [CONTACT_504501][INVESTIGATOR_805] (including bound 
bacteri al toxins) from peripheral macrophages (foam cells) and transports them to the liver for elimination. This 
study will test the hypothesis that lipid emulsion administration will provide a substrate for bacterial toxin 

08/13/2021   5 of 19  binding during sepsis and steroid synt hesis  leading to improved reverse cholesterol transport through the liver 
as well as transport of cholesterol to the adrenal glands in sepsis. (Figure 2 )                                                    
3.2 Fish oil lipid injectable e mulsion for sepsis.  Lipid -based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_504475]. (Perner et al., 2017)  
Fish oil lipid emulsions contain anti -inflammatory long -chain ω -3 fatty acids, which  may be protective in 
sepsis. (Li et al., 2015; Shih et al., 2016)  There are four main mechanisms for these effects: i) metabolism into 
anti-inflammatory eicosan oid inflammatory  mediators,  ii) alteration of membrane lipid rafts , iii) inhibition of 
nuclear receptor activation (nuclear factor [NF] –κB) to modulate production  of inflammatory mediators,  and, iv) 
metabolism into novel pro -resolving/anti -inflammatory mediators (resolvin s and protectins). Exogenous 
administration of ω -3 may be necessary to overcome the massive inflammatory response that occurs during 
sepsis. A recent randomized controlled trial of 60 ICU sepsis patients demonstrated a significant improvement 
in organ fai lure after IV administration of 10% fish oil .(Hall et al., 2015)   
3.3 Fish-oil lipid emulsions may safely elevate cholesterol and improve outcomes  in sepsis .(D’Ascenzo 
et al., 2014)  This may be beneficial  in sepsis as increased cholesterol and phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_504476]. In addition, low cholesterol levels are associated both with poor outcomes and 
increased sepsis risk. (J.-Y. Chien et al., 2005a; Y. -F. Chien et al., 2015; Guirgis, Dodani, et al., 2017; Guirgis, 
Donnelly, et al., 2016; Guirgis, Leeuwenburgh, et al., 
2017)  It is not known, however, whether transiently 
elevating cholesterol will improve outcomes in sepsis. 
The proposed LIE contains medium chain trigly cerides, 
ω-6, and ω -[ADDRESS_649640] of a phospholipid 
emulsion for gram -negative severe sepsis (Dellinger et 
al., 2009)  demonstrated (patient subset  with serum 
albumin ≥ 1.5 g/dL, and either a cholesterol ≥ 40 
mg/dL or HDL -C ≥ 20 mg/dL), a reduction in overall 
sepsis mortality by 6.6% (p < 0.025) and 10.8% (p< 
0.005) , respectively.[ADDRESS_649641] be low upon enrollment. Based on preliminary 
data from 223 UF JAX ED and UF Surgical ICU sepsis 
patients, initial mean total cholesterol levels differed 
between survivors (89 mg/dL) and non -survivors (100 
mg/dL); and mean delta total cholesterol for survivors 
was + 5 mg/dL (95%CI 1 -9) vs. -9 mg/dL (95%CI -22, 
+3, p = 0.012) for no n-survivors over 48 hours. These data form the basis for the inclusion criteria of total 
cholesterol < 100 mg/dL, and goal delta total cholesterol of 0 to +5 mg/dL . This is the first clinical trial to use 
serum cholesterol levels to screen for sepsis patie nts who may respond to lipid -based therapy,  and attempt t o 
modulate cholesterol levels to improve outcomes. Furthermore, 54% of previous study patients (120/223) met 
proposed enrollment criteria.  
3.5 Phase I Study Findings. Our recently completed Phase I dose escalation study with a Bayesian Optimal 
Interval Design safely allocated 10 patients to increasing doses of Smoflipid (LIE) starting at 1.0 g/kg and 
escalating by 0.2 g/kg increments to 1.6 g/kg. Eight of the ten patien ts successfully completed the Phase I 
study, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_504477] 1.8 g/kg at the recommendation of the DSMB. Of the 
two patients who did not complete the study protocol, one patient withdrew from the study and did not 
complete the first two doses of study drug and left the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_285602]. The second patient was 
found to have a displaced gastrostomy tube in her abdomen and was taken emergently to the operating room. 
Her triglycerides were elevated at  451, which d id not meet the prespecified criteria for a dose limiting toxicity  of 
triglycerides > 1000 mg/dL . However, the safety monitor and PI [INVESTIGATOR_504478] a second dose of the study drug under the circumstances  and also assessed  that the 
hypertriglyceridemia was more likely due to peritonitis and potential pancreatitis than due to study drug 

08/13/2021   6 of 19  administration . Of the eight patients who completed two doses of the study drug at each of the four dose 
levels, results for the primary end  point of 48 -hour mean total cholesterol level were 66 mg/dL (SD 11.3) for 1.0 
g/kg, 95.5 (SD 4.9) for 1.2 g/kg, 72.5 (SD 20.5) for 1.4 g/kg, and 67 (SD 4.2) for 1.6 g/kg. Tests for significance 
were not performed, however graphical presentations of total cholesterol levels over time for each dose level 
are presented below.   
 With regards to adverse events (AEs), there was one patient who died within 7 days of study enrollment 
and two patients who died within 28 days. Other serious adverse events (SAEs) in cluded endotracheal 
intubation, a below the knee amputation, chest tube placement for a pleural effusion, and emergency surgery 
for a misplaced gastrostomy tube. None of the SAEs were deemed to be related to study interventions.  
Adverse events included hyp erglycemia, anemia, elevated AST, elevated triglycerides, elevated bilirubin, 
intravenous catheter infiltration, and elevated PT/INR values. The most common possibly related AEs included 
elevated liver function tests . No patients met the prespecified crite ria for a dose limiting toxicity. Please see full 
DSM report. At the recommendation of the DSM, the Phase I study was concluded at a maximal dose of 
1.6g/kg and did not proceed to 1.8 g/kg given the low likelihood of added benefit of dose escalation to 1.8 g/kg 
body weight and feasibility issues with line infiltration given prolonged drug infusions with increasing doses. 
The DSM unanimously recommended proceeding to the Phase II study with the design outlined below.

with moderate organ dysfunction (SOFA ≥ [ADDRESS_649643] 2 points being new or sepsis with vasopressor 
dependence ). The LIPI[INVESTIGATOR_16852] -P clinical trial will assess the following : 1) safety and tolerability of lipid injectable 
emulsion and adverse effects, 2) the drug ’s ability to optimally , transiently  elevate cholesterol, and 3) 
preliminary measures of biological activity and clinical outcomes.  
4.2 Study Settin gs, Screening and Enrollment.  
A. Adult ED at UF JAX  is a high volume, high acuity ED which treats approximately 80,000 patients per year. 
From October 2013 through November 2015 the UF JAX ED treated 2665 cases of sepsis who were admitted. 
The UF JAX ED is the current site of enrollment for 3 prospective sepsis research studies (one RCT) and , 3 
full-time research coordinators, and 3 part -time research assistants  experienced in sepsis studies , as well as a 
biomedical laboratory.  

08/13/2021   7 of 19  B. UF North  ED in Jacksonville.  The UF North ED is a high -volume community ED with approximately 55,000 
patient volume per year. The Research Division in the Department of Emergency Medicine is capable of 
enrolling patients from the UF North ED.  
  
C. Screening and Enrollment . The "Possible 
Sepsis" notification system as well as the Sepsis 
Alert systems will be used to identify patients for 
prospective enrollment into sepsis research 
studies. The "possible sepsis" notif ications send 
hourly pages and generate a daily list of 
potentially septic patients throughout the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_504479]. The Sepsis Alert system is 
activated when a patient is highly suspected of 
sepsis and is being managed with the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_504480]. " For patients who meet all 
other inclusion and exclusion criteria a lipid 
panel will be obtained and added on to current 
lab tests to evaluate cholesterol criteria for 
enrollment.  
D. UF Jacksonville sepsis recruitment . UF 
JAX Emergency Dept. patients meeting 
criteria will be identified by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_7706] -I 
([CONTACT_261058]) and the research team who will 
be notified via pager. Prior to approaching 
the patient or the LAR for consent in the 
study, the clinical staff will approach the 
patient or LAR and ask them about their 
interest in hearing about the study. If the 
patient or LAR express interest, t he 
research team will review eligibility criteria, 
and will seek consent.Time block sampling 
will be used to enroll patients between the 
hours of 7am and 12am, 7 days /week.[ADDRESS_649644]. Guirgis’ K23 study.

of enrollment.  
4.4 Protocol.  The flow diagram ( Figure 3 ) represents the primary research methodology. The research team 
will review eligibility criteria, an d will seek the appropriate consent when criteria are met. Many sepsis 
patients may have altered mental status or pharmacologic sedation, but would be regarded as 
prospective research subjects. We ask for delayed consent only for the  collect ion of  a lipid panel for 
these potential subjects due to the severity of the illness, the vulnerable nature of the patient at this 
early time point, and the challenge in reaching the patient’s legal representatives. The lipid panel 
can frequently be added on to the patie nt's blood chemistry panel that nearly all septic patients 
already have as part of usual care. This means that it will usually not require an additional blood 
draw. In the unusual case that the patient does need an additional blood draw for the lipid panel , the 
blood will be drawn from existing venous access. For patients on whom a lipid panel is drawn prior 
to obtainment of written consent from the patient or LAR, we will seek written consent within [ADDRESS_649646] (patent), the PI [INVESTIGATOR_504483], and consenting patients. For fully enrolled patients, t he study drug will be infused as early as 
practical after s tudy enrollment and within the first [ADDRESS_649647] of Care Treatment : All patients will be treated in the ED or in a mo nitored inpatient setting at UF JAX .  
All patients will undergo standard emergent interventions and treatment with institutional sepsis protocols, an 
institutional standard of care and comprised of early, evidence -based treatment of sepsis that is utilized  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -wide. It has been shown to result in improved outcomes. (Croft et al., 2014; Guirgis, Jones, et al., 
2017)   
4.5 Investigational Treatment. Within 24 hours of sepsis recognition, eligible patients (or their legal 
representatives in the case of inability to consent) will be approached for study enrollment . If a LAR is utilized 
and the subject gains the capacity to  consent, the subject will be re -consented. After informed consent the 
following study procedures will be followed:  
A. Treatment.  The LIE is Smoflipid (20% lipid emulsion  for injection; Fresenius Kabi), which contains soybean 
oil, MCTs, olive oil, and fis h oil in a 30:30:25:15 ratio. Smoflipid also contains 0.163 to 0.225 mg/mL of all -rac-
α-tocopherol.  Initial infusion rate of LIE will occur at a rate of 0.5 mL/min for the first 30 minutes. If tolerated, 
the infusion will proceed at the maximum FDA approve d rate of  0.11g/ kg/hr, and not to exceed 0.5 mL/kg/hr . 
The proposed dose of LIE is based on current manufacturer recommended dosing for nutritional purposes  for 
this specific drug . The approved dose range is 1 to 2 g/kg/day, and not to exceed 2.5 g/kg/day. Since this is a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], and because the lipid emulsion appears white and will be visible to the treatment team, the study 
will not be blinded. All infusion bags and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_504484] , and non -PVC tubing and a 1.2 micron in -line filter will 
be used.  All study treatments will be administered either via an existing central venou s catheter or via a single 
lumen peripheral intravenous catheter. This approved method of administration has been shown to be safe.  
B. Weight -based dosing . Dosing will be based on actual body weight in kilograms, except in cases of morbid 
obesity defined as actual weight (AW) > 200% ideal body weight (IBW). For morbidly obese patients, adjusted 
body weight (AdjBW)  will be used for Smoflipid dosing  according to the following formula:  
 AdjBW = IBW + 0.4( ABW - IBW).  
Ideal body weight in (kg)  will be calcul ated as follows.  
 Males: IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg for each inch over 5 feet.  
 Females: IBW = 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg for each inch over 5 feet.  
C. Adverse reactions : nausea, vomiting, hyperglycemia, flatulence, pyrexia, abdominal pain, 
increased blood triglycerides,  hypertension, sepsis, dyspepsia, urinary tract infection, anemia and

4.6 Investigational Measurements .  
08/13/2021   9 of 19  Blood S ampling. Blood will be drawn for cholesterol levels, lipid oxidation, HDL function, inflammatory 
biomarkers, and SOFA score  (Appendix Table 1 ). For Jacksonville subjects only, if  the subject is  re-admitted 
to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_504485] [ADDRESS_649648] . 
A. Cholesterol Levels. Blood will be drawn for serial lipid panels upon enrollment, then at 48 and 72h, and 
then at day 7. For patients discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_97011] 7, a phlebotomy service will be sent to the 
patient's place o f residence (home, nursing facility, etc.) to draw their blood.  
B. Lipid Oxidation. Tests of lipid oxidation including HDL inflammatory index will be performed  as in current 
studies  at UCLA using the cell free assay as in previous studies (Navab et al., 2001)  after preparation at UF. 
This will be drawn at enrollment, at 48h, as well as 7d later to assess change over time. To prevent oxidative 
degradation of the samples, an antioxidant buffer will be added to samples prior to storage. (Myzak & Carr, 
2002)  
C. HDL Function. The cholesterol efflux assay measure s the ability of HDL to move lower density lipid s from 
peripheral macrophages to the liver for clearance.  HDL-mediated cellular cholesterol efflux assays will be 
performed to assess potential improvements in HDL function with LIE vs. control as in previous .(Guirgis, 
Leeuwenburgh, et al., 2017)  
D. SOFA Score. Assessment will occur at enrollment and  48h later as well as 7 days later to determine 
change in SOFA score over time as well as serum lactate. Necessary labs will be paid for by [CONTACT_504503] . 
E. Future Testing. In addition, the patient or LAR will be presented with a consent for a biobank study  for 
future testing  should they choose to participate . The biobank, Emergency Medicine Research Data and Tissue 
Bank , has previously been approved by [CONTACT_504504]201601987.  
Stool Sampling. A stool sample will be collected for determining lipid absorption within 24 hours of each time 
point when available (enrollment,  48h, 7 days) utilizing standard of care procedures by [CONTACT_504505].  
4.[ADDRESS_649649] treatments mandated by [CONTACT_504506]. For purposes of statistical outcomes analysis, the control group will be the comparison 
group.  
4.8 Efficacy Endpoints  
A. Primary Endpoints  
 Delta (48h - enrollment) serum total choles terol of 0 to 5 mg/dL  
B. Secondary Endpoints  
 Lipid oxidation (HDL inflammatory index)  
 HDL function (cholesterol efflux capacity)  
 Change in SOFA score over the first 48h and 7 days  
 In-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380]  
 Change in cholesterol level from enrollment to 7 days  
4.9 Study Procedures.  
A. Randomization   
Phase II of this study/ trial will use an adaptive design . As the study progresses, the dose of the study drug 
that proves least efficacious for stabilizing cholesterol levels will be dropped. For the first 24 patients, patients 
will be randomized to receive one of three doses of the study drug, or no drug (acti ve control). The first 24 
patients will be randomized using the following allocations: 4:4:4:12. From the first [ADDRESS_649650] performance in the primary endpoint, Delta (48h - enrollment) serum total 
cholester ol of 0 to 5 mg/dL, among the ones that are acceptable in safety. We will also evaluate Delta SOFA 
score at 48 hours (organ failure score, from 48h -enrollment) as well as Delta 7 days for serum total cholesterol 
(7 day – enrollment) to select the two most efficacious doses. For the last [ADDRESS_649651] 24 
patients in the following manner: 6:6:12 , or no drug (active control) . The overall study groups will include 24 
08/13/[ADDRESS_649652]. As the treatment effects are objective  measurements (lipid levels, SOFA score, etc.) the likelihood of 
bias is low.  
C. Drug Accountability. The drug for this study will be supplied by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_504486] . A SOP will be used to track lot numbers of LIE administered.   
  D. Sample Size. Our preliminary data suggests that with proposed enrollment criteria, patients experienced an 
average decrease of 17 mg/dL (SD = 23) in cholesterol at 48 hours. If the treatment group can stop the decline 
or increase by 2 mg/dL in chole sterol, which correspond to between group difference with Cohen’s effect size 
of 0.74 or 0.83. Then, at a significance level of 0.05, 24 patients in each arm (N = 48)  will be able to detect the 
difference at 71% or 80% power, respectively.  Recruitment feas ibility: Based upon extensive prior work by [CONTACT_504507] [INVESTIGATOR_504487], we expect to enroll approximately 2 patients/month and all study patients 
within 4 years.  
E. Safety Monitoring.  This study will employ a Data Safety Monitoring Plan (see full plan at end of study 
protocol)  that includ es a primary physician  safety monitor  (not a co -investigator)  who will have expertise in 
critical care and the study drug. The DSM  plan also includes a second safety monitor (not a co -investigator) 
who is a clinical trialist who also has experience in critical care. The third member of the DSM plan  is a 
biostatistician  with experience in clinical trials and critical care studies and with prior DSMB experience.  All 
DSM meetings to evaluate for safety will  be coordinated by [CONTACT_11200] . Since the Phase I study has 
been completed (10 patients) and the DSM has approved the start of Phase II, s ubsequent  meetings will occur 
after the thirtieth , and forty fifth  patients are enrolled  and after study complet ion. The DSM  will have the 
authority to make one of three written recommendations to the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_504488]: suspend the study, 
continue the study without restriction, or continue the study with contingency on review of additional data 
regarding a dverse events,  adjustments to the protocol,  or individual patient’s clinical history.  
AE and SAE Monitoring  
Any reaction deemed to be  severe (as listed below) and  related to the drug infusion while it is being infused, 
will result in discontinuation of the study drug after discussion with the PI. Potential expected AEs include the 
following:  
1. Hypersensitivity reactions resulting in facial, head or neck swelling, airway compromise, shortness of 
breath or hypoxia  will resu lt in cessation of drug infusion on a study patient . No patients experience 
allergic drug reactions will continue to receive or receive additional doses of study drug.  
Dose Escalation and Dose -Limiting Toxicities include:  
2. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_504489] o ccurring very soon after initiation of study drug .  
3. Fat Overload or Hypertriglyceridemia (> 1000 mg/dL)  
4. Parenteral nutrition associated liver disease or hepatitis characterized by a marked  elevation of liver 
function tests or total  bilirubin . 
For AEs that do not meet criteria of SAEs or deemed to be “not related” or “possibly related” the PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706] -
Investigators will make decisions regarding management based on the clinical scenario (See  DSMP Adverse 
Events Monitoring Section I).  
"Hypersensitivity reaction s resulting in facial, head or neck swelling, airway compromise" as detailed in the AE 
and SAE monitoring section. Though considered SAEs, these will not be considered dose limiting toxicities as 
allergic reactions are not dose -related. Therefore dose esca lation in the Phase I study can continue even if a 
patient experiences a hypersensitivity reaction. Hypersensitivity reactions, when severe as defined above, will 
however result in stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_504490].  
F. Patient Bedside Monitoring.  
 Only patients admitted to a monitored inpatient setting or ICU an ICU setting will be enrolled in the 
study to ensure adequate monitoring during and after drug infusion.  
 Laboratory monitoring will occur under the supervision of  the study pharmacist or nutritionist with 
experience using the proposed LIE. The following laboratory measures will be monitored for the first 48 
08/13/2021   11 of 19  hours: serum triglycerides, fluid and electrolyte status, blood glucose, liver and kidney function, blood 
count including platelets , and coagulation parameters .  
 Bedside nurse monitoring will occur for the first hour of drug infusion on day 1 of the study. Nurse 
monitoring will include monitoring for all of the following: tachypnea, dyspnea, hypoxia, bronchospasm , 
tachycardia, hypotension, cyanosis, vomiting, nausea, headache, sweating, dizziness, altered 
mentation, flushing, rash, urticaria, erythema, pyrexia, or chills. Vascular access  will also be monitored 
for thrombophlebitis, erythema, pain.  
G. Statistical A nalysis. The primary method of analysis will be using an unpaired t -test of change in mean 
lipid levels between the groups (48 hours – enrollment) and Wilcoxon ranksum test between groups for change 
in SOFA score (48 hours – enrollment). Normally distribut ed numerical data will be compared using unpaired t -
test while non -normally distributed data will be compared using Wilcoxon’s ranksum. Finally categorical data 
will be compared using Chi squared test. For all statistical tests P<0.05 will be considered si gnificant.  
H. Trial Organization. This study will be conducted at UF JAX  and overseen by [CONTACT_504508] W. Guirgis, MD .

I. Data Safety Monitoring  Plan 
OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITIES  
Trial Oversight  is provided by [CONTACT_079] (PI), [CONTACT_504516] W. Guirgis, MD, and 
Frederick A. Moore, MD , and [CONTACT_504517], MD (“co-investigators” throughout).  
The Safety Monitors  are [CONTACT_504518], MD (primary) and [CONTACT_504519], MD  
(secon dary) .  
The Study Statistician s are [CONTACT_504520], PhD  at UF JAX and [CONTACT_504521], PhD at UF Health 
(Gainesville).  
The Study Monitor  is [CONTACT_504522], MPH, CCRP.  
 
MONITORING PROCEDURES  
[CONTACT_504523] assures that informed consent is obtained prior to pe rforming any research procedures, 
that all subjects meet eligibility criteria, and that the study is conducted according to the IRB -approved 
research plan. Study data will be accessible at all times for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_6254] -investigators to review. The 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_6254] -investigators will review study conduct including participant accrual, drop -outs, and protocol 
deviations on a weekly, basis. The primary safety monitor ([CONTACT_504524] ) will review AEs individually in 
real-time. Both safety monitors (Sheikh and Angiolillo) wi ll review AEs  in aggregate on a monthly 
basis. The safety monitors will also review serious adverse events (SAEs) including dose -limiting 
toxicities and drug -related effects. Co -investigators, safety monitors, as well as the study pharmacist 
or nutritionist  will monito r for laboratory abnormalities including serum triglycerides, fluid and 
electrolyte status, blood glucose, liver and kidney function, blood count including platelets, and 
coagulation parameters throughout treatment (first 48 hours). The PI [INVESTIGATOR_504491], 
AEs, and SAEs are reported to the IRB according to the applicable regulatory requirements.  
 
COLLECTION, SPECIFICATION, AND REPORTING OF SAEs AND AEs  
Specification of Safety Variables  
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and repor ting adverse events (AEs) and serious 
adverse events (SAEs) that are considered related to LIE, all events of death, and any study specific 
issue of concern.   
 
Adverse Events  
An AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally asso ciated with the 
use of LIE in this study. The study -specific definition of “temporally related” includes up to twelve 
hours after discontinuation of LIE infusion.  
 
This includes the following:  
 AEs not previously observed in the subject that emerge during t he protocol -specified AE reporting 
period.  
 If applicable , AEs that occur prior to assignment of study treatment associated with medication 
washout, no treatment run -in, or other protocol -mandated intervention.  
 Preexisting medical conditions (other than th e condition being studied) judged by [CONTACT_504509] -specified 
AE reporting period.  
 Laboratory values that are abnormal to a degree such that the value falls into the ra nge specified 
as abnormal by [CONTACT_104130], and the abnormality leads to specific medical corrective action.  
 
08/13/2021   13 of 19  Serious Adverse Events  
An AE should be classified as an SAE if:  
 It results in death (i.e., the AE actually causes or leads to death).  
 It is life threatening (i.e.,  the AE, in the view of the investigator, places the subject at immediate 
risk of death.  It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death.).  
 It requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12191]. 
 It results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE results in substantial 
disruption of the subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
 It results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mo ther exposed to 
the investigational product.  
 It is considered a significant medical event by [CONTACT_13656] 
(e.g., may jeopardize the subject or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed abo ve). 
 
Methods and Timing for Assessing AND Recording Safety variables  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs that are observed or reported 
during the study are collected and reported to the FDA, appropriate IRB(s) in accordance with CFR 
312.32 (IND Safety Reports).  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The reporting period for all study -defined adverse events will begin at the time of LIE infusion and for 
[ADDRESS_649653], or other means will be reported up until 12 
hours after LIE. Abnormal laboratory values will be conside red an AE if the value falls into an 
abnormal range based upon the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s laboratory standards, and the abnormality was not 
preexisting prior to enrollment, and the abnormality leads to a new treatment within the AE time 
frame.  
 
Each reported SAE will  be described by [CONTACT_13662] (i.e.,  start and end dates), regulatory seriousness 
criteria if applicable, suspected relationship to LIE and actions taken. To ensure consistency of SAE 
causality assessments, investigators will apply the following general gu ideline:  
 
AEs are graded according to the following severity scale:  
  
Mild: An experience that is transient, and requires no special treatment or intervention. The 
experience does not generally interfere with usual daily activities. This includes transient  laboratory 
test alterations.  
 
Moderate: An experience that is alleviated with simple therapeutic treatments. The experience 
impacts usual daily activities. Includes laboratory test alterations indicating injury, but without long -
term risk.  
 
08/13/2021   14 of 19  Severe: An exp erience that requires therapeutic intervention. The experience interrupts usual daily 
activities. If hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) is required for treatment it becomes an 
SAE.  
 
The study uses the following AE attribution scale:  
 
Not related: the AE is clearly not related to the study procedures (i.e., another cause of the event is 
most plausible and/or a clinically plausible temporal sequence is inconsistent with the onset of the 
event).  
 
More likely than not related: an event that fo llows a reasonable temporal sequence from the initiation 
of study procedures, but that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors.  
 
Related: The AE is clearly related to the study procedures.  
 
Sepsis Related Exempted Events  
The followi ng signs, symptoms, observations and events are frequently observed in association with 
sepsis and are exempted from regulatory reporting unless known to be caused by [CONTACT_5257]: 
dyspnea, chest pain, fever, hypoxemia, rapid pulse, rapid respi[INVESTIGATOR_7137] e, dizziness, syncope, altered 
mental status, seizure, confusion, anxiety, generalized weakness, anorexia, nausea, abdominal pain, 
back pain, constipation, vomiting, pneumonia, skin infection, cancer, surgery not related to treatment 
of sepsis, electrocard iography abnormalities (atrial arrhythmias, right bundle branch block, and ST 
and T wave changes), elevated troponin level, elevated BNP or NT ProBNP level, high white blood 
cell count, pulmonary infiltrate, pleural effusion, cardiomegaly, need for oxygen therapy, need for 
vasopressor, need for blood product transfusion, need for inotropic therapy, need for mechanical 
ventilation, need for physical or occupational therapy.  
 
Expected AEs associated with the study drug (Smoflipid) include : nausea, vomiting, 
hyperglycemia, flatulence, pyrexia, abdominal pain, increased blood triglycerides, hypertension, 
sepsis, dyspepsia, urinary tract infection, anemia and device related infection,  headache, sweating, 
dizziness, flushing, rash, urticaria, erythema, in real -time which will be recorded by [CONTACT_504510].  
 
AE Management  
Any AE classified as an SAE (as per above definitions) and deemed to be related to the drug infusion 
will result in discontinuation of the study drug after discussion with t he PI. Potential expected AEs 
include the following:  
1. Hypersensitivity reactions resulting in rash, nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath or hypoxia  
2. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_504492]  
3. Dose Escalation and Dos e-Limiting Toxicities including Fat Overload, Hypertriglyceridemia, and 
Refeeding Complications  
4. Parenteral nutrition associated liver disease or hepatitis characterized by [CONTACT_504511] “not related” or “possibly related” the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_7706] -Investigators will make decisions regarding management based on the clinical scenario.  
 
Procedures for eliciting, recording, and reporting adverse events  
Specific Instruction s for Recording Adverse Events  
Investigators will use correct medical terminology/concepts when reporting AEs or SAEs.  Avoid 
colloquialisms and abbreviations.  
08/13/2021   15 of 19  a. Diagnosis vs. Signs and Symptoms  
If known at the time of reporting, a diagnosis will be repor ted rather than individual signs and 
symptoms. However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized 
as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, it will be reported based upon the 
information that is current ly available.  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it will be reported as 
follow -up information.  
b. Deaths  
All deaths  that are “more likely than not” related to the study and  that occur during the protocol -
specified AE reporting period will be reported to the appropriate parties.  
When recording a death, the event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome will be 
reported as the single medical concept.  If th e cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained 
at the time of reporting, report “Unexplained Death”.  
c. Preexisting Medical Conditions  
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  Such conditions will be 
reporte d as medical and surgical history.  
A preexisting medical condition will be re -assessed throughout the trial and reported as an AE or SAE 
only if  the frequency, severity, or character of  the condition worsens during the study.  When reporting 
such events, i t is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by 
[CONTACT_9672] (e.g.,  “more frequent  headaches”).  
d. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_504493] w ill be documented and reported as an SAE. If a 
subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9615] a medical or surgical procedure as a result of an AE, the event 
responsible for the procedure, not the procedure itself, will be reported as the SAE.   
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315] t he following reasons do not require reporting: Prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_504494], or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_504495].  
e. Pregnancy  
Pregnant patients will be excluded from study. In women of child -bearing age who have a uterus, 
pregnancy can be excluded by [CONTACT_504512], 
contraception with reliable menstrual history.  
f. Post-Study Adverse Events  
The investigator will expeditiously report any SAE occurring after a subject has completed or 
discontinued study participation if attributed to prior LIE.  
If the investigator becomes aware of the development of cancer or a congenit al anomaly in a 
subsequently conceived offspring of a female subject who participated in the study, this will be 
reported as an SAE.  
 
Data Quality Assurance and monitoring plan  
Accurate, consistent, and reliable data will be ensured through the use of sta ndard practices and 
procedures.  The CRF will be populated in hand by [CONTACT_504513]. To 
qualify, the coordinator must be trained in Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and listed on the IRB -
approved protocol, and must have a bachel or’s degree from college and a clinical degree (e.g., 
coordinator, MD, or PA). Currently, our Division of Research employs [ADDRESS_649654].  
 
08/13/2021   16 of 19  Safety Monitoring  
The Data Safety Monitoring Plan that includes a primary physician  safety monitor  (not a co -investigator) who 
will have expertise in critical care and the study drug. The DSM plan also includes a second safety monitor (not 
a co-investigator) who is a clinical trialist who also has experience in critical care. The third member of the 
DSM plan is a biostatistician with experience in clinical trials and critical care studies and with prior DSMB 
experience. All DSM meetings to evaluate for safety will be coordinated by [CONTACT_11200] . The primary 
safety monitor will review the study data  and procedures after the first patient is enrolled to evaluate the case 
history and any adverse events. The DSM  will then meet after the fourth and eighth patient are enrolled, and at 
completion of the Phase I study for which results will be submitted to the IRB as a miscellaneous reportable 
event.  Once the DSM makes the decision to move the study to Phase II, that recommendation will be 
submitted to the IRB, and IRB approval will be required for Phase II initiation.  Subsequent meetings will occur 
after t he thirtieth, and forty fifth patients are enrolled and after study completion . The DSM  will have the 
authority to make one of three written recommendations to the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_504488]: suspend the study, 
continue the study without restriction, or c ontinue the study with contingency on review of additional data 
regarding adverse events,  adjustments to the protocol,  or individual patient’s clinical history.  The DSM can 
make additional recommendations regarding safety or study conduct as indicated for the safe and successful 
completion of the trial.  
 
Data Safety Monitoring Board reports for Phase I will be submitted to the IRB for review prior to the start of the 
Phase II portion of the project.  
 
Statistical Analysis  
The primary method of analysis will  be using an unpaired t -test of change in mean lipid levels between the 
groups (48 hours – enrollment) and Wilcoxon ranksum test between groups for change in SOFA score (48 
hours – enrollment). Normally distributed numerical data will be compared using unp aired t -test while non -
normally distributed data will be compared using Wilcoxon’s ranksum. Finally,  categorical data will be 
compared using Chi squared test. For all statistical tests P<0.[ADDRESS_649655]  
This study will be  reviewed by [CONTACT_504514].

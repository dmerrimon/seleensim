1. INTRODUCTION  
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB)[ADDRESS_820331] (IMP).  
1.1. Backgro und 
The role of Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) gene mutations in human 
cancers has been known for decades;[ADDRESS_820332] been successfully developed. Thus, an unmet need exists for therapi[INVESTIGATOR_430639]. Recent progress in the field suggests that 1 
mutant version of KRAS , KRAS p.G12C , which encodes the KRASG12C protein, might be 
tractable for small -molecule inhibition through a covalent interaction with the cysteine.3,4,5 KRAS 
p.G12C  mutation is a frequent mutation found in approximately 13  of lung adenocarcinoma 
(nonsquamous, nonsmall cell lung cancer [NSCLC]), 3  of colorectal cancer, and 1  to 2 of 
numerous other solid tumors.6,7,8 Sotorasib forms a specific covalent bond with the cysteine of 
KRASG12C, irreversibly locking the protein in an inactive conformation that cripples oncogenic 
signaling.5 As inactivation of KRAS has been demonstrated to inhibit cell growth and/or promote 
apoptosis selectively in tumor cells expressing KRAS  mutations 9,10,11,3,4, sotorasib may provide a 
therapeutic benefit for patients with KRAS p.G12C -driven cancers.

Labcorp Drug Development Study: 8471134  [COMPANY_010] Protocol: 20210088  
Protocol Version 1.0, 18 February 2022   Page 14 of 67 The metabolism and excretion of  [14C]-sotorasib were evaluated in noncannulated male or 
female rats as well as in bile duct cannulated (BDC) male rats after a single oral dose of sotorasib 
(60 mg/kg). Overall, the data indicated that sotorasib was readily absorbed after an oral dose to 
noncannulated male and female rats and BDC male rats, underwent extensive biotransformation, 
and was eliminated primarily by [CONTACT_430648]; 
[14C]-sotorasib -derived radioactivity was excreted primarily through biliary and fecal pathways. 
Biotransformation of sotorasib was mediated primarily by [CONTACT_430649], oxidation, and to a lesser extent, reduction, and dealkylation. Secondary sotorasib 
metabolism was substantive and included amide hydrolysis, cys teine -conjugate cleavage, 
N-acetylation, methylation, glucuronidation, and sulfonation. Biotransformation of sotorasib 
through primary glutathione conjugation was major and accounted for up to approximately 21  
to 33 of the dose from intact male and femal e rats, respectively, and up to approximately 41  
of the dose in male BDC rats. Sotorasib metabolites originating from primary oxidation account 
for up to approximately 20  of the dose in noncannulated rats and for approximately 10  of the 
dose in BDC rats . Reduction of the sotorasib acrolein moiety account for up to approximately 
10 of the dose in noncannulated male and female rats and approximately 2.7  of the dose in 
BDC rats, whereas dealkylation at the pi[INVESTIGATOR_617695] 10  to 
13 of the dose in noncannulated rats and for approximately 6  of the dose in BDC rats.  
The metabolism and excretion of [14C]-sotorasib were evaluated in noncannulated male and 
female dogs after a single oral (500 mg/kg) dose of sotorasib. Overall, [14C] sotorasib -derived 
radioactivity was minimally absorbed and was eliminated predominantly as unchanged sotorasib 
in feces following a single 500 mg/kg dose to male or female dogs.  
Seven sotorasib clinical studies (20170543, 20190009, 20190135, 20190147, 2 0190288, 
20190436, and 20190442) are currently ongoing in subjects with KRAS p.G12C -mutated tumors. 
In addition, a number of studies in healthy volunteers have explored the pharmacokinetics (PK) 
of sotorasib, including assessments of mass -balance, food -effect, and various drug -drug 
interactions.  
Study 20170543 is an ongoing phase 1/2, open -label, nonrandomized study evaluating the safety, 
tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of sotorasib in subjects with KRAS p.G12C -
mutated NSCLC, colorectal ca ncer, and other solid tumors. As of [ADDRESS_820333] been treated with sotorasib monotherapy across all doses (dose range: 180 to 960 
mg) and tumor types in the ongoing Phase  1 and Phase 2 treatment cohorts.  This includes 359 
subjects w ho were treated with the sotorasib dose of 960 mg once daily (QD) (fasted) for all 
tumor types.  
For the combination therapy cohorts, as of the data cutoff date (06 July 2020), a total of 
11 subjects with NSCLC were treated with sotorasib in combination wit h pembrolizumab in 
Part 1c/2c of Study  20170543.  As of the data cutoff date (12 July 2021), a total of 41 subjects 
with KRAS p.G12C -mutated advanced solid tumors were treated with sotorasib in combination 
with trametinib in Study 20190135 Subprotocol A.  As of the data cutoff date (12 July 2021), a 
total of 33 subjects with KRAS p.G12C -mutated advanced NSCLC were treated with sotorasib

with sotorasib and 39 subjects were treated with panitumumab in Study 20190135 
Subprotocol  H.   
A summary of completed and ongoing clinical studies for sotorasib is provided in the IB 
(Tables  6-1, 6-2, and 6 -3).[ADDRESS_820334] been characterized in healthy subjects and in subjects with KRAS 
pG12C -mutated solid tumors, i ncluding NSCLC. Sotorasib exhibited nonlinear, time -dependent, 
PK over the dose range of 180 to 960 mg (0.19 to 1 times the approved recommended dosage) 
QD with similar systemic exposure (ie, area under the concentration -time curve from time zero 
to 24 hou rs postdose [AUC 0-24h] and maximum observed plasma concentration [C max]) across 
doses at steady state. Sotorasib systemic exposure was comparable between film -coated tablets 
and film -coated tablets predispersed in water administered under fasted conditions . Sotorasib 
plasma concentrations reached steady state within 22 days. No accumulation was observed after 
repeat sotorasib dosages with a mean accumulation ratio of 0.56 (coefficient of variation [CV]: 
59). 
Absorption  
The median time of the maximum observ ed concentration (t max) is [ADDRESS_820335] of Food  
When 960 mg sotorasib was administered with a high -fat, high -calorie meal (containing 
approximately 800 to 1000 calories with 150, 250, and 500 to 600 calories from protein, 
carbohydrate, and fat, respectiv ely) in patients, sotorasib AUC 0-24h increased by 25  compared 
to administration under fasted conditions.  
Distribution  
The sotorasib mean apparent volume of distribution at steady state (V ss) is 211 L (CV: 135 ). In 
vitro, sotorasib plasma protein binding is 89. 
Elimination  
The sotorasib mean terminal elimination half -life is 5 hours (standard deviation: 2). At 960 mg 
sotorasib QD, the sotorasib steady -state apparent clearance is 26.2 L/hr (CV: 76 ).

Protocol Version 1.0, 18 February 2022   Page 16 of 67 Metabolism  
The main metabolic pathways of sotorasib are nonenzymatic conjugation and oxidative 
metabolism with cytochrome P450 (CYP)3As.  
Excretion  
After a single dose of radiolabeled sotorasib, 74  of the dose was recovered in feces (53  
unchanged) and 6  in urine (1  unchanged).  
Specific Populations  
No clin ically meaningful differences in the PK of sotorasib were observed based on age (28 to 
86 years), sex, race (White, Black, and Asian), body weight (36.8 to 157.9 kg), line of therapy, 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (0, 1), mild and moderate renal impai rment (estimated 
glomerular filtration rate:  30 mL/min/1.73 m2), or mild hepatic impairment (aspartate 
aminotransferase [AST] or alanine aminotransferase [ALT]  2.5 x upper limit of normal [ULN] 
or total bilirubin  1.[ADDRESS_820336]). The effect of severe rena l impairment or moderate to severe 
hepatic impairment on sotorasib PK has not been studied.  
Drug -drug Interaction Studies  
Interactions of sotorasib with digoxin (P -glycoprotein substrate), metformin (multidrug and toxic 
compound extrusion (MATE)1 and MATE 2-K substrate), itraconazole (CYP3A4 and P -gp 
inhibitor), rifampin (organic anion transporter [OATP] 1B1/1B3 inhibitors and CYP3A4 
inducer), omeprazole (proton -pump inhibitor [PPI]), famotidine (histamine -[ADDRESS_820337]), and midazolam (CYP3A4 subst rate) are summarized in the IB (Table 6 -3).[ADDRESS_820338] sotorasib may be taken safely with sensitive MATE1/2K substrates, 
CYP2D6 substrates, strong CYP3A4/P -gp inhibitors, and strong OATP1B1/1B3 inhibitors. 
However, exposures of P -gp and sensitive CYP3A4 substrates may be altered. Coadministration 
of PPIs, histamine -2 receptor antagonists, and strong CYP3A4 inducers may lead to decr eased 
sotorasib exposure.  
1.3. Study Rationale  
The purpose of this study is to compare the PK of 240 mg sotorasib administered as 1 x 240 mg 
oral tablet (Treatment A) under fasted condition to 240 mg sotorasib administered as 2 x 120  mg 
oral tablets (Treatment B) under fasted condition and to compare the PK of 240 mg sotorasib

1.4.1.  Therapeutic Context  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Key Benefits  
Healthy subjects in the current study will not receive any health benefit (beyond that of an 
assessment of their medical status) from participating in the study.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Risks  
To limit the risk of excessive exposure to healthy subjects in the current study, each subject will 
receive a single oral dos e of 240 mg sotorasib administered as 1 x 240 mg tablet (Treatment A) 
and a single oral dose of 240 mg sotorasib administered as 2 x 120 mg tablets (Treatment B) in 
either Period 1 or Period 2 according to their assigned group .  Approximately 14 healthy su bjects 
in either Group  1 or 2 will receive a single oral dose of 240 mg sotorasib administered as 
1 x 240 mg tablet (Treatment C) following a high -fat meal (detailed provided in Section  5.2.1 ) in 
Period 3.  
Safety monitoring: During the study, subjects will receive all IMP doses by [CONTACT_617701], chew, or split the sotorasib tablets when taking the dose under the 
supervis ion of the site staff.  Safety assessments throughout the study include adverse event 
monitoring, electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical examination, vital signs, and clinical 
laboratory evaluations.  
Risks of Sotorasib  
Based on sotorasib clinical trials exper ience, adverse drug reactions with sotorasib include 
diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, vomiting, abdominal pain, anemia, and increased liver enzymes.  Based 
on nonclinical toxicity studies of sotorasib, potential safety concerns to be monitored in clinical 
studie s of sotorasib include renal toxicity, anemia, leukocytosis, and thyroid dysfunction.  
Clinical signs and symptoms of these toxicities observed in clinical and nonclinical studies, 
along with relevant laboratory parameters, will be monitored during the stu dy to ensure subjects’ 
safety.  
Abnormal Liver Function Tests  
Abnormal liver function tests (increased AST and increased ALT]) have been observed in 
oncology subjects receiving sotorasib therapy.  The events of abnormal liver function blood tests 
generally  resolved in subjects upon interruption of treatment.  The risk mitigation plan consists 
of monitoring liver enzymes, with regular measurement of AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and

provided in Section 4. 
Interstitial Lung Disease/Pneumonitis  
Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis has occurred in patients treated with sotorasib with 
prior exposure to immunotherapy or radiotherapy.  Three subjects (0.8 ) had an adverse event 
of ILD/pneumonitis. All 3 events were serious and Grade 3 or 4 at onset, and 2 subjects 
discontinued sotorasib because of ILD/ pneumonitis.  Monitor patients for new or worsening 
pulmonary symptoms.  At any grade, immediately withhold sotorasib for suspected 
ILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue if ILD/pneumonitis is confirmed.

The Investigator (or designee) will maintain an accurate record of the receipt of sotorasib tablets 
received.  In addition, an accurate drug disposition record will be kept, specifying the amount 
dispensed to  each subject and the date of dispensing.  This drug accountability record will be 
available for inspection at any time.  At the completion of the study, the original drug 
accountability record will be available for review by [CONTACT_117605].  
For each batch of unit doses, the empty used unit dose containers will be discarded upon 
satisfactory completion of the compliance and accountability procedures.  Any unused assembled 
unit doses will be retained until completion of the study.

6.2. Diet 
Subjects will be fasted overnight (at least 8  hours) before collection of blood sampl es for clinical 
laboratory evaluations.  While confined at the study site, subjects will receive a standardized diet 
at scheduled times that do not conflict with other study -related activities.  
Refer to Section 5 and Table  2 for diet requirements/restrictions on applicable days of study 
treatment and/or P K assessments.  
Foods and beverages containing poppy seeds, grapefruit, or Seville oranges will not be allowed 
from 7  days prior to Check -in until EOS.  
Caffeine -containing foods and beverages will not be allowed from 48  hours before Check -in 
until EOS.  
Consumption of alcohol will not be permitted from 48  hours prior to Check -in until EOS.  
6.3. Smoking  
Subjects will not be permitted to use tobacco or nicotine -containing products within 6  months 
prior to Check -in until the EOS.  
6.4. Exercise  
Subjects are required to  refrain from strenuous exercise from 7 days before Check -in until EOS.  
Subjects will otherwise maintain their normal level of physical activity during this time (ie, will 
not begin a new exercise program nor participate in any unusually strenuous physica l exertion).  
6.5. Blood Donation  
Subjects are required to refrain from donation of blood from [ADDRESS_820370] to the nominal time. The order of

7.1. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
7.1.1.  Pharmacokinetic Blood Sample Collection and Processing  
Blood samples (approximately 1  x 4 mL for sotorasib) will be collected by [CONTACT_617705]  8.  Procedures for 
collection, processing, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_237054] a separate 
docum ent.  
Any blood sample collected according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix  8) can be 
analyzed for any of the tests outlined in the protocol and f or any tests necessary to minimize 
risks to study subjects.  This includes testing to ensure analytical methods produce reliable and 
valid data throughout the course of the study.  This can also include, but is not limited to, 
investigation of unexpected r esults, incurred sample reanalysis, and analyses for method transfer 
and comparability.  
7.1.2.  Analytical Methodology  
Plasma concentrations of sotorasib will be determined using validated analytical procedures. 
Specifics of the analytical method will be provided in a separate document.  
7.2. Safety and Tolerability Assessments  
7.2.1.  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events: Time Period and Frequency for 
Collecting and Reporting Safety Event Information  
Adverse event definitions, assignment of severity and causality, and proc edures for reporting 
Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events are detailed in Appendix  1. 
The condition of each subject will be monitored from the tim e of signing the ICF to EOS.  
Subjects will be observed for any signs or symptoms and asked about their condition by [CONTACT_386831], such as “How have you been feeling since you were last asked?”, at least once each 
day while resident at the study site a nd at each study visit.  Subjects will also be encouraged to 
spontaneously report adverse events and serious adverse events occurring at any other time 
during the study.

Labcorp Drug Development Study: 8471134  [COMPANY_010] Protocol: [ADDRESS_820371] ( whether reported by [CONTACT_617706]) from the first dose of study drug through the EOS 
visit are recorded/reported using the appropriate eCRF.  
Serious Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsib le for ensuring that all serious adverse events observed by [CONTACT_237078] [ADDRESS_820372] dose of study treatment or the EOS visit (whichever is later) are reported using the 
appropriate eCRF and reported on the paper -based Serious Adverse Event Report Form 
(described in  Appendix  1). 
All serious adverse events will be collec ted, recorded, and reported to the Sponsor within 
24 hours of the Investigator’s awareness of the event.  The Investigator will submit any updated 
serious adverse event data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of it being available.  
Since the criteria the CTCAE  grading scale differs from the regulatory criteria for serious 
adverse events, if adverse events correspond to Grade 4 CTCAE toxicity grading scale criteria 
(eg, laboratory abnormality reported as Grade 4 without manifestation of life -threatening status),  
it will be left to the Investigator’s judgment to also report these abnormalities as serious adverse 
events.  For any adverse event that applies to this situation, comprehensive documentation of the 
event’s severity must be recorded in the subject medical  records.   
Serious Adverse Events After the Protocol -required Reporting Period  
There is no requirement to monitor study subjects for serious adverse events following the 
protocol -required reporting period (as defined above in the ‘Serious Adverse Event’ s ection) or 
after EOS.  However, these serious adverse events suspected to be related to  investigational 
products  should be reported to [COMPANY_010] if the Investigator becomes aware of them.  Per local 
requirements in some countries, Investigators are required to report serious adverse events that 
they become aware of after EOS.  If serious adverse events are reported, the Investigator is to 
report them to the Sponsor within 24 hours following the Investigator’s /awareness of the event 
using the paper -based Serious Adverse Event Report Form.  
Serious adverse events reported outside of the protocol -required reporting period w ill be 
captured within the Sponsor’s safety database as clinical trial cases and handled accordingly 
based on relationship to investigational product.

after the subject ends the study.  
Method of Detecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting adverse even ts and/or serious adverse 
events.  Open -ended and non -leading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to 
inquire about adverse event occurrence.  
Follow -up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
After the initial adverse event/seriou s adverse event report, the Investigator is required to 
proactively follow each subject at subsequent visits/contacts.  All adverse events and serious 
adverse events will be followed, where possible, until resolution, stabilization, until the event is 
otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up.  This will be completed at the 
Investigator’s (or designee’s) discretion.  
All new information for previously reported serious adverse events must be sent to [COMPANY_010] 
within [ADDRESS_820374] the safety of subjects and the safety of a 
study treatment under clinical investigatio n are met.  
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation.  The 
Sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory req uirements relating to safety reporting to 
the regulatory authority, IRBs/Independent ethics committees, and Investigators.  
Individual safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
according to local regulatory requireme nts and Sponsor policy and forwarded to Investigators as 
necessary.  
An Investigator who receives an individual safety report describing a serious adverse event or 
other specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of serious adverse events) from the  
Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  
Labcorp Drug Development Study: 8471134  [COMPANY_010] Protocol: [ADDRESS_820375] safety will be routinely monitored as defined in the Sponsor’s safety surveillance and 
signal management processes.  
Pregnancy and Lactation  
Details of all pregnancies and/or lactation in female subjects will be collected after the start of study 
treatment and until 7 days after EOS. Details of all pregnancies in female partners of male subjects 
will be collec ted after the start of study treatment until 7 days after EOS. If a pregnancy is reported, 
the Investigator is to inform [COMPANY_010] within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy and/or lactation 
and is to follow the procedures outlined in  Appendix  5.  [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety will 
follow -up with the Investigator regarding additional information that may be requested.  
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneou s abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital 
anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered serious adverse events.  
Further details regarding pregnancy and lactation are provided in Appendix  5. 
7.2.2.  Clinical Laboratory Evalu ations  
Blood and urine samples will be collected for clinical laboratory evaluations (including clinical 
chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and serology) at the times indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments in Appendix  8.  Clinical laboratory evaluations are listed in  Appendix  2. 
The Investigato r is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and recording any clinically 
relevant changes occurring during the study in CRF/eCRF.  The Investigator must determine 
whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically s ignificant 
change from the subject’s baseline values.  In general, abnormal laboratory findings without 
clinical significance (based on the Investigator’s judgment) are not to be recorded as adverse 
events.  However, laboratory value changes that require t reatment or adjustment in current 
therapy are considered adverse events.  Where applicable, clinical sequelae (not the laboratory 
abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse event.  Subjects who develop any lab 
abnormalities outside the reference range that are deemed clinically meaningful during the study 
period will have follow -up labs once a week, or more frequently if deemed necessary, until the 
abnormalities have resolved or returned to within the reference range or to the subject’s baseline 
values.  
Subjects will be asked to provide urine samples for drugs of abuse screen and cotinine test, and  
will undergo an alcohol urine or breath test at the times indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
in Appendix  8.  For all female subjects, a pregnancy test and FSH screen for postmenopausal 
women will be performed at the times indicated in the Schedule of Assessments in Appendix  8.

Follow -up, and Reporting of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Definition of Adverse Event  
Adverse Event Definition  
 An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject 
irrespective of a causal relationship with the study treatment.   
 Note: An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or 
exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a treatment, combination 
product, medical device, or pr ocedure.  
 Note: Treatment -emergent adverse events will be defined in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan.  
Events Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
 Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) 
or other safety assessments (eg, electrocardiogram, radiological scans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, that are considered 
clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the Investigator (ie, 
not related to progress ion of underlying disease).  
 Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
 New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study.  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.  
 Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspecte d overdose of either study 
treatment or a concomitant medication.  Overdose per se will not be reported as an 
adverse event/serious adverse event unless it is an intentional overdose taken with 
possible suicidal/self -harming intent.  Such overdoses are to be reported regardless 
of sequelae.  
 Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” per se will not be 
reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event.  Such instances will be 
captured in the effi cacy assessments.  However, the signs, symptoms, and/or 
clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as adverse event or 
serious adverse event if they fulfill the definition of an adverse event or serious 
adverse event.  
Events NOT Meeting the Adverse Event Definition  
 Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that 
leads to the procedure is the adverse event.  
Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  
Labcorp Drug Development Study: 8471134  [COMPANY_010] Protocol: 20210088  
Protocol Version 1.0, 18 February 2022  Page 41 of 67  Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience a dmission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
 Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) 
present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that 
meets at least 1 of the following serious criteria:  
Results in death (fatal)  
Immediately life -threatening  
The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.   For 
instance, drug -induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure 
would not be considered life -threa tening even though drug -induced hepatitis can be 
fatal.  
Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12993], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5184] (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay)  at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1083]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the 
physician’s office or outpatient setting.  Complications that occur during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54497].  If a complication prolongs hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_147194], the event is serious.  When in doubt as to whether 
“hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the adverse event is to be considered 
serious.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre -existing co ndition that did 
not worsen from baseline is not considered an adverse event.  
Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
The term “disability” means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  This def inition is not intended to include experiences of 
relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which 
may interfere with or prevent everyday life func tions but do not constitute a 
substantial disruption.  
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Other medically important serious event  
Medical or scientific judgment is to be exercised in deciding whether serious 
adverse event reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical 
Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  
Labcorp Drug Development Study: 8471134  [COMPANY_010] Protocol: [ADDRESS_820386] or may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent 1 of the other outcomes listed in  the above definition.  
These events are typi[INVESTIGATOR_147196].  
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
Recording Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Recording  
 When an adverse event or serious adverse event occurs, it is the responsibility of 
the Investigator to review all documentation (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], 
laboratory, and diagnostics reports) related to the event.  
 The Investigator will then record all relevant adverse event/serious adverse event 
information in the Ev ent electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  
 The Investigator must assign the following adverse event attributes:  
o Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or 
symptoms);  
o Dates of onset and resolution (if resolved);  
o Did the event start prior to first dose of investigational product;  
o Assessment of seriousness;  
o Severity (or toxicity defined below);  
o Assessment of relatedness to the investigational product(s) and/or study -
mandated activity and/or procedures;  
o Action taken; and  
o Outcome  of event.  
 If the severity of an adverse event changes from the date of onset to the date of 
resolution, record as a single event with the worst severity on the appropriate eCRF.   
 It is not acceptable for the Investigator to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_9238] ’s medical 
records to Sponsor in lieu of completion of the appropriate eCRF page.  
 If specifically requested, the Investigator may need to provide additional follow -up 
information, such as discharge summaries, medical records, or extracts from the 
medical r ecords. In this case, all subject identifiers, with the exception of the 
subject number, will be blinded on the copi[INVESTIGATOR_12997].  
Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  
Labcorp Drug Development Study: 8471134  [COMPANY_010] Protocol: 20210088  
Protocol Version 1.0, 18 February 2022  Page 43 of 67  The Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on sig ns, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the adverse event/serious 
adverse event.  
Evaluating Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Assessment of Severity  
The Investigator will make an assessment of severity for each adverse event and 
serious adverse event reported during the study.  The assessment of severity will be 
based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grading 
scale.  For th e CTCAE grading scale version 5.0, refer to: 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . 
Assessment of Causality  
 The Investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between investigational 
product(s), protocol -required therapy and/or study -mandated activity and/or 
procedure and each occurrence of each adverse event/serious adverse event.  
 Relatedness means that there are facts or reasons to support a relationship between 
investigational product and the event.  
 The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
 Alternative causes, s uch as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other 
risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment 
administration will be considered and investigated.  
 The Investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochu re and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.  
 For each adverse event/serious adverse event, the Investigator must document in the 
medical notes that he/she has reviewed the adverse event/serious adverse event and 
has provided  an assessment of causality.  
 There may be situations in which a serious adverse event has occurred and the 
Investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report.  However, it is 
very important that the Investigator always make an assessment  of causality for 
every event before the initial transmission of the serious adverse event data.  
 The Investigator may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up 
information and send a serious adverse event follow -up report with the updated 
causality assessment.  
 The causality assessment is 1 of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements.

Labcorp Drug Development Study: 8471134  [COMPANY_010] Protocol: 20210088  
Protocol Version 1.0, 18 February 2022  Page 44 of 67  The Investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by [CONTACT_237080]/or causality of the adverse event or serious 
adverse event as fully as possible.  This may include additional laboratory tests or  
investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health 
care professionals.  
 If a subject is permanently withdrawn from protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_21889] a 
serious adverse event, this information must be submitted to the Spon sor. 
 If a subject dies during participation in the study, the Investigator will provide the 
Sponsor with a copy of any post -mortem findings including histopathology.  
 New or updated informa tion will be recorded in the originally completed eCRF.  
 The Investigator will submit any updated serious adverse event data to the Sponsor 
within 24 hours of receipt of the information.  
Reporting of Serious Adverse Event  
Serious Adverse Event Reporting via Paper Serious Adverse Event Report Form  
 Facsimile transmission of the Serious Adverse Event Report Form (see  Figure 2 ) is 
the preferred method to transmit this information.  
 In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by 
[CONTACT_9337] a copy of the Serious Adver se Event Report Form sent 
by [CONTACT_22855].  
 Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the Investigator to 
complete and sign the Serious Adverse Event Report Form within the designated 
reporting time frames.  
 Once t he study has ended, serious event(s) should be reported to the Sponsor 
(regardless of causality) if the Investigator becomes aware of a serious adverse 
event.  The Investigator should use the paper -based Serious Adverse Event Report

All subjects must receive pregnancy prevention counseling and be advised of the risk to the fetus 
if they conceive a child during treatment and for 7 days after the end of study (EOS).  
Additional medications given during the study may alter the contraceptive requirements. The 
Investigator must discuss these contraceptive changes with the subject.  
Definitions  
Women of Childbearing Potential:  premenopausal females who are anatomically and 
physiologically capable of becoming pre gnant following menarche.  
Women of Nonchildbearing Potential:  
1. Surgically sterile:  females who are permanently sterile via hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], and/or bilateral oophorectomy by [CONTACT_237083]/or medical 
records.  Surgical st erilization to have occurred a minimum of 6 weeks, or at the 
Investigator’s discretion, prior to Screening.  
2. Postmenopausal:  females at least 45 years of age with amenorrhea for 12 months 
without an alternative medical reason with confirmatory follicle -stimulating hormone 
levels of  40 mIU/mL.  The amenorrhea should not be induced by a medical condition 
such as anorexia nervosa, hypothyroid disease or polycystic ovarian disease, or by 
[CONTACT_178697].  It should not be due to concomitant medications that may have 
induced the amenorrhea such as oral contraceptives, hormones, gonadotropin -releasing 
hormones, anti -estrogens, or selective estrogen receptor modulators.  
Fertile male:  a male that is considered fertile after puberty.  
Infertile male:  permanently sterile male via bilateral orchiectomy.  
Contraception Requirements  
Female Subjects

Collection of Pregnancy Information  
Female Subjects Who Become Pregnant  
 Investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female subject who becomes 
pregnant while taking protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44817] 7 days after end of study 
(EOS).  
 Information will be recorded on the Pregnancy Notification Form  (see Figure 3 ).  The 
form must be submitted to [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety within [ADDRESS_820391]’s pregnancy. (Note: Sites are not required to provide any information on the 
Pregnancy Notification Form that violates the country or regions local privacy laws) . 
 After obtaining the female subject’s signed consent for release of pregnancy and infant 
health information, the Investigator will collect pregnancy and infant health information 
and complete the pregnancy questionnaire for any female subject who becomes pregnant 
while taking protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44817] 7 days after EOS .  This information will 
be forwarded to [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety.  Generally, infant follow -up will be 
conducted up to 12  months after the birth of the child (if applicable).  
 Any termination of pregnancy will be reported to [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety, 
regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure.  
 While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an adverse event or serious adverse event , 
any pregnancy complication or report of a congenital anomaly or developmental delay, 
fetal death, or suspected adverse reactions in the neonate will be reported as an adverse 
events or serious adverse event.  Note that an elective termination with no info rmation on 
a fetal congenital malformation or maternal complication is generally not considered an 
adverse event, but still must be reported to the Sponsor as a pregnancy exposure case.  
 If the outcome of the pregnancy meets a criterion for immediate classi fication as a serious 
adverse event (eg, female subject experiences a spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or 
neonatal death or there is a fetal or neonatal congenital anomaly), the Investigator will 
report the event as a serious adverse event.  
 Any serious ad verse event occurring as a result of a post -study pregnancy which is 
considered reasonably related to the study treatment by [CONTACT_617708]  1.  While the Investigator is 
not obligated to actively seek this information in former study subjects, he or she may 
learn of a serious adverse event through spontaneous reporting.  
 Any female subject who becomes pregnant while participating will discontinue study 
treatment  (see Section 4.7 for details).  
Male Subjects with Partners Who Become Pregnant  or Were Pregnant at the Time of Enrollment  
 In the event a male subject fathers a child during treatment, and for an additional 7 days 
after EOS, the information will be recorded on the Pregnancy Notification Form. The 
form  (see Figure 3 ) must be submitted to [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety within 24 hours of

information on the Pregnancy Notification Form that violates the country or region’s 
local privacy laws).  
 The Investigator will attempt to obtain a signed consent for release of pregnancy and 
infant health information directly from the pregnant fem ale partner to obtain additional 
pregnancy information.  
 After obtaining the female partner’s signed consent for release of pregnancy and infant 
health information, the Investigator will collect pregnancy outcome and infant health 
information on the pregnan t partner and her baby [CONTACT_237086]. This information will be forwarded to [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety.  
 Generally, infant follow -up will be conducted up to 12 months after the birth of the child 
(if applicable).  
 Any terminatio n of the pregnancy will be reported to [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety 
regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies ) or indication for procedure.  
Collection of Lactation Information  
 Investigator will collect lactation information on any female subject who breastfeeds 
while taking protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44817] 7 days after EOS.  
 Information will be recorded on the Lactation Notification  Form (Figure 4 ) and submitted 
to [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of event.  
 Study treatment will be discontinued if the female subject breastfeeds during the study.  
 With the female subject’s signed consent for release of mother and infant health 
information, the Investigator will collect mother and infant health information and 
complete the lactation questionnaire on any female subject who breastfeeds while taking

Subjects with abnormal hepatic laboratory values (ie, alkaline phosphatase [ALP], aspartate 
aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], total bilirubin [TBL]) and/or 
international normalized ratio (INR) and/or signs/symptoms of hepatitis (as described below) 
may meet  the criteria for withholding or permanent discontinuation of [COMPANY_010] investigational 
product or other protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], as specified in the Guidance for Industry 
Drug -Induced Liver Injury: Premarketing Clinical Evaluation, July 2009.  
Criteria for Withholding and/or Permanent Discontinuation of [COMPANY_010] Investigational 
Product and Other Protocol -required Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_83321]/or withholding rules apply to subjects for whom another cause of 
their changes in liver biomarkers (TBL, INR, and transaminases) has not been identified.  
Important alternative causes for elevated AST/ALT and/or TBL values include, but are not 
limited to:  
 Hepatobiliary tract disease  
 Viral hepatitis (eg, hepatitis A/B/C/D/E, Epstein -Barr Virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes 
simplex virus, varicella, toxoplasmosis, and parvovirus)  
 Right -sided heart failure, hypotension, or any cause of hypoxia to the liver causing 
ischemia  
 Exposure to hepatotoxic agents/drugs or hepatotoxins, including herbal and dietary 
supplements, plants, and mushrooms  
 Heritable disorders causing impaired glucuronidation (eg, Gilbert’s syndrome, 
Crigler -Najjar syndrome) and drugs that inhibit bilirubin glucuronidation (eg, indinavir, 
atazanavir)  
 Alpha -one antitrypsin deficiency  
 Alcoholic hepatitis  
 Autoimmune hepatitis  
 Wilson’s disease and hemochromatosis  
 Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease including steatohepatitis  
 Non-hepatic causes (eg, rhabdomylosis, hemolysis).  
If investigational product is withheld, the subject is to be followed for possible drug -induced 
liver injury (DILI) according to recommendations in the last section of this appendix.  
Rechallenge may be considered if an alternative cause for impaired liver tests (ALT, AST, ALP) 
and/or elevated TBL is discovered  and the laboratory abnormalities resolve to normal or baseline 
(see next section in this appendix).

they meet the criteria for a serious adverse event defined in  Appendix  1. 
Additional Clinical Assessments and Observation  
All subjects in whom investigational product(s) or protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33217]/are withheld 
(either permanently or conditionally) due to potential DILI as specified in Table [ADDRESS_820396] or ALT elevations  [ADDRESS_820397] or 2 -fold increases above baseline values for 
subjects with elevated values before drug are to undergo a period of “close observation” until 
abnormalities return to normal or to the subject’s baseline l evels.  
Assessments that are to be performed during this period include:  
 Repeat AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin (BIL) (total and direct), and INR within 24 hours  
 In cases of TBL 2x ULN or INR  1.5, retesting o f liver tests, BIL (total and direct) and 
INR is to be performed every [ADDRESS_820398](s) or protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_33218]/have been discontinued AND the 
subject is asymptomatic.  
Initiate investigation of alternative causes for elevated AST or ALT and/or elevated TBL.  
The following are to be considered depending on the clinical situation:  
 Complete blood count with differential to assess for eosinophilia  
 Serum total immunoglobulin (Ig)G, anti -nuclear antibody anti -smooth muscle antibody, 
and liver kidney microsomal antibody -1 to assess for autoimmune hepatitis  
 Serum acetaminophen (paracetamol) levels

Protocol Version 1.0, 18 February 2022  Page 64 of 67  A more detailed history of:  
o Prior and/or concurrent disease or illness  
o Exposure to environmental and/or industrial chemical agents  
o Symptoms (if applicable) including right upper quadrant pain, hypersensitivity -
type reactions, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and fever  
o Prior and/or concurrent use of alcohol, recreational drugs, and special diets  
o Concomitant use of medications (including nonprescription medicines and herbal 
and dietary supplements), plants, and mushrooms  
 Viral serologies  
 Creatine phosphokinase, hapt oglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, and peripheral blood smear  
 Appropriate liver imaging if clinically i ndicated  
 Appropriate blood sampling for pharmacokinetic analysis, if this has not already been 
colle cted 
 Hepatology consult (liver biopsy may be considered in consultation with a hepatologist).  
Follow the subject and the laboratory tests (ALT, AST, TBL, INR) until all laboratory 
abnormalities return to bas eline or normal or considered stable by [CONTACT_737]. The “close 
observation period” is to continue for a minimum of [ADDRESS_820399](s) and protocol -required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
The potential DILI event and additional information such as medical history, concomitant 
medications, and laboratory results must be captured in the correspondin g eCRFs.

CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Regulatory 
Classification: ENSEAL X1: Class II in the [LOCATION_002], Class IIb in the European Union and [LOCATION_008], Class III in Japan  
Generator G11: Class II in the [LOCATION_002], Class IIb in the European Union and [LOCATION_008], Class III in Japan 
Indication: ENSEAL X1   
The ENSEAL X1 devices  are bipolar electrosurgical  instruments for use 
with an electrosurgical  generator. They are intended for use during open 
or laparoscopic surgical procedures to cut and seal vessels, and to cut, 
grasp and dissect tissue during surgery. 
Indications for use include open and laparoscopic general, gynecologic al, 
urologic, thoracic, and ear, nose, and throat (ENT ) surgical procedures or 
any procedure where vessel ligation (cutting and sealing), tissue 
graspi[INVESTIGATOR_007], dissection, and division of vessels, lymphatics, and tissue 
bundles is performed (e.g. bowel resections, hysterectomies, gall bladder 
procedures, Nissen Fundoplication, adhesiolysis, and oophorectomies). 
The devices can be used on vessels up to and including [ADDRESS_638977] 
not been shown to be effective for sterilization procedures or tubal coagulation.  
Objective(s):  The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the acceptable 
performance and safety of the ENSEAL X1  and GEN11 devices when 
used per the instructions for use (IFU). 
Overview of 
Study Design:   This prospective, single- arm, multi-center study will collect clinical data in 
a post-market setting by [CONTACT_212638] (thoracic, urologic, and ENT). 
Investigators will perform each procedure using the device in compliance with their standard surgical approach and the ENSEAL X1 and GEN11 IFUs.  
Subjects will be consented and screened anytime during a period of 8 weeks prior to the date of surgery. Subjects will be considered enrolled 
when the ENSEAL X1 device has been attempted to be used for a vessel 
transection during thoracic, urologic, or ENT  procedures. All enrolled 
 
Trial Number: ENG_2020_04 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 5 of 33 
Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_638978] -operatively through discharge and again at 
28 days (± 14 days) post -surgery; therefore, from the surgery date to 
study exit, the duration will be approximatel y 6 weeks . 
Number of 
Subjects:   A minimum of  105 subjects  enrolled (maximum of 120 subjects  enrolled) 
will be included in the study from  up to 12 surgery centers globally with 
the following procedure targets:  
• A minimum of 35 subjects  enrolled to a maximum of 40 subjects  
enrolled for thoracic procedures (e.g., lung resections [branches, 
no pulmonary artery/pulmonary vein {PA/PV}]) ; 
• A minimum of 35 subjects  enrolled to a maximum of 40 subjects  
enrolled for urologic procedures  (e.g., nephrectomy ); and 
• A minimum of 35 subjects  enrolled to a maximum of 40 subjects  
enrolled for ENT procedures  (e.g., thyroidectomy, tonsillectomy, 
parotidectomy , radical neck ). 
Criteria for Inclusion:  Subjects satisfying the following criteria will be considered eligible for enrollment in this study:  
1. Primary laparoscopic or open procedure (thoracic, urologic, or ENT) 
where at least one vessel is planned to be transected by [CONTACT_340517] X1 device per the IFU; 
2. Willingness to give consent and comply with all study -related 
evaluation s and visit schedule; and 
3. At least 18 years of age.  
Criteria for Exclusion: Subjects meeting any of the following criteria will be considered ineligible for enrollment in this study: 
1. Physical or psychological condition which would impair study participation; or 
2. Enrollment in a concurrent interventional clinical study that could 
impact the study endpoints . 
Test Product:  ENSEAL® X1 Curved Jaw Tissue Sealer  (Product Codes: NSLX125C, 
NSLX137C, or NSLX145C) and Generator G11 (GEN11). 
Reference Therapy/Product:  No comparator product is being used in this study. 
Duration of Treatment:  Subjects will be exposed to the ENSEAL X1 device during the procedure 
and while the device is used as indicated in the IFU. The device nor any 
device components remain in the patient after use. 
Criteria for 
Evaluation: The primary performance endpoint will be: 
• The number and percentage of vessels where hemostasis is achieved (≤ Grade 3) per the grading scale below : 
o Grade 1: no bleeding at transection site; 
 
Trial Number: ENG_2020_04 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 6 of 33 
Version: Amendment 2  28 JUL 2021 
o Grade 2: minor bleeding at transectio n site, no 
intervention needed; 
o Grade 3: minor bleeding at transection site, mild 
intervention needed, use of compression, basic energy 
devices (monopolar and/or bipolar)  and/or touch- ups with 
ENSEAL X1; or 
o Grade 4: significant bleeding (e.g., pulsatile blood flow, venous pooling) requiring intervention such as extensive coagulation or use of additional hemostatic measures  
(e.g., hemoclips, staples, sutures, fibrin sealants, other 
advanced energy products);  
The secondary performance endpoints will be: 
• Distribution of 5-point scale scores for various tasks completed by 
[CONTACT_340517] X1 device (adhesiolysis , lymphatics or tissue 
bundles divided, tissue graspi[INVESTIGATOR_007], tissue cutting, or tissue dissection); 
• Distribution of hemostasis grading scale (1-4) for each vessel transected; and 
• Type, name, and number of additional hemostasis mea sures  
required to achieved hemostasis for Grade 4 vessel transections . 
The safety endpoint will be: 
• Occurrence of device-related (possibly, probably, or causally) 
adverse events (AEs). 
Statistical Analysis:  Analysis Sets 
The summary of all performance and safety endpoints will be performed on the set of subjects in whom the ENSEAL X1 device is utilized during the surgical procedure. The summary of all performance and safety endpoints will be performed by [CONTACT_497049].  
Sample Size Determination 
A sample size of [ADDRESS_638979] 105 transections. 
From a safety perspective on the pooled analysis of 105 subjects and in 
consideration of rare AEs that may occur (e.g., bleeding requiring blood 
product transfusion), for an event that has an incidence rate of, for example, 2%, then in a sample of [ADDRESS_638980] 1 event is 88.0% under a binomial probability model. Thus, this sample size provides a high probability of observing rare 
events if they do occur , and provides reasonable assurance to conclude 
 
Trial Number: ENG_2020_04 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 7 of 33 
Version: Amendment 2  28 JUL 2021 
that the likelihood of such AEs is less than 3.5% if they do not occur 
based on the upper limit of an exact 95% confidence interval when 0 
events out of 105 subjects are observed. 
Performance Analyses 
The num ber and percentage of vessels where hemostasis is achieved (≤ 
Grade 3) will be summarized and an exact 95% confidence interval will 
be estimated for each procedure group ( thoracic , urologic and ENT) and 
in total. Counts and percentages will be provided for  type, size, and 
number of vessels transected, grading scale distribution for all vessels transected, number of times ENSEAL X1 touch-ups were required, and incidence of requirement for additional measures to obtain hemostasis on vessels.   
Safety Analyses 
All device -related and procedure-related AEs reported during the study 
will be coded to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). All AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_497050]. Separate summaries 
will be provided for device-related and procedure-related AEs. Serious 
AEs will be summarized in a similar manner.

Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_638985] tissue during surgery.  
ENSEAL X1  devices  differ primarily in three ways from the earlier version of the device, the 
ENSEAL® G2 Tissue Sealer (ENSEAL G2).  
1. The ENSEAL G2 relied on I-BLADE® Technology to provide compression along the device tip, whereas the ENSEAL X1 has a redesigned jaw that provides uniform compression without the need for an I-BLADE. 
2. The ENSEAL G2 used a positive temperature coefficient technology to modulate energy flow and control temperature at the blade, whereas ENSEAL X1 uses electrical impedance feedback to intelligently monitor tissue conditions and modulate energy delivery to ensure effective sealing while minimizing tissue damage.  
3. The ENSEAL G2 had an integrated seal -and-cut steps for use, whereas ENSEAL X1 
has separated these into intuitive, simplified functions, so that surgeons may now seal without cutting, cut without sealing, or both seal and cut.  
The ENSEAL X1 devices have  undergone extensive preclinical testing to ensure that they are 
capable of producing strong and durable seals for vessels up to 7mm in diameter. Beginning in 2018, the open-surgery version, ENSEAL X1 Large Jaw, was successfully launched. Now, a 
laparoscopic version, ENSEAL X1 Curved Jaw (Figure 1) is being introduced to the market. 
With a shaft diameter of 5 mm, the device will be available in lengths of 25, 37, and 45 cm. The 
curved tapered tip of the device is designed for fine dissection, while being able to capture more tissue per bite with stronger graspi[INVESTIGATOR_497044] G2 device. The shaft can be 
rotated a full 360° for easier access to targeted tissue.

The GEN11 supplies energy to the HARMONIC and ENSEAL surgical instruments. It also has a touchscreen for easy setup and operation, and a high-resolution display with wider viewing angles. Software updates to ensure that the system is operating optimally are available via USB memory stick. The generator  has a unique receptable port that accepts either a HARMONIC or 

 
Study Number: ENG_2020_04 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 14 of 33 
Version: Amendment 2   28 JUL 2021 
an ENSEAL instrument. Connectors (HGA11 for HARMONIC and EGA11 for ENSEAL) are 
used to enable the generator to power legacy instruments. 
The ENSEAL X1 device s include several incremental enhancements of the same basic 
technology used with predicate ENSEAL G2 devices. This study is being initiated to evaluate 
the ENSEAL X1 device when used per their  instructions for use (IFU) in the following types of 
procedures: thoracic, urologic, and ENT.   
2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES 
The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the acceptable performance and safety of 
the ENSEAL X1 and GEN11 devices when used per the instructions for use (IFU).  
2.1 PRIMARY PERFORMANCE ENDPOINT   
A hemostasis grading scale was adapted from Siegel et al.1 The primary performance 
endpoint will be: 
• The number and percentage of vessels where hemostasis is achieved (≤ Grade 3)  
per the grading scale below: 
o Grade 1: no bleeding at transection site; 
o Grade 2: minor bleeding at transection site, no intervention needed; 
o Grade 3: minor bleeding at transection site, mild intervention needed, use of compression, basic energy devices ( monopolar and/or bipolar)  and/or touch-
ups with ENSEAL X1; or  
o Grade 4: significant bleeding (e.g., pulsatile blood flow, venous pooling) requir ing intervention such as extensive coagulation or use of additional 
hemostatic measures  (e.g., hemoclips, staples, sutures, fibrin sealants, other 
advanced energy products).  
2.2 SECONDARY PERFORMANCE ENDPOINTS   
The secondary performance endpoints will be: 
• Distribution of 5-point scale scores for various tasks completed by [CONTACT_340517] X1 
device (adhesiolysis , lymphatics or tissue bundles divided, tissue graspi[INVESTIGATOR_007], tissue 
cutting, or tissue dissection). The scale will be a 5-point scale (very dissatisfied, dissatis fied, neither satisfied or dissatisfied, satisfied, or very satisfied) asking how 
satisfied the surgeon was with the use of the device for each of the tasks ; 
• Distribution of hemostasis grading scale (1-4) for each vessel transected ; and 
• Type, name, and number of additional hemostasis measures required to achieved 
hemostasis for Grade 4 vessel transections . 
2.3 SAFETY ENDPOINT   
The safety endpoint will be occurrence of device -related (possibly, probably, or causally)  
adverse events (AEs). 
2.4 ADDITIONAL KEY DATA COLLECTED

[IP_ADDRESS] Device Description 
ENSEAL X1  
The ENSEAL X1 instrument is a sterile, single- patient-use surgical instrument to 
coagulate and transect vessels up to and including 7 mm in diameter, tissue and/or 
vascular bundles. This devi ce is to be used for soft tissue only. The instrument consists 
of a grip housing assembly, a rotating shaft, a moveable jaw, and a knife. The instrument 
shaft can be rotated 360° to facilitate visualization and enable easy access to targeted 
tissue. The jaws are in a normally -opened position and can be partially or  fully closed by 
[CONTACT_340522]. The jaws are designed for graspi[INVESTIGATOR_340509]. The ENSEAL X1 has separate seal and cut capabilities. The lower 
jaw of the ENSEAL X1 can be used in the open or closed position to deliver energy based on the electrode configuration and jaw design. Bipolar energy is delivered when the SEAL button on the device or the MIN foot pedal is pressed. Pressing the CUT 
button advances the knife the length of the jaws to cut the targeted tissue. The power  
cord is permanently attached to the device and connects the instrument to the generator. The ENSEAL X1  instrument is designed for use exclusively with the GEN11 software 
version 2016-1 or later, packaged separately. 
GEN11  
The GEN11 device supplies energy to the HARMONIC and ENSEAL surgical instruments. The generator uses a touchscreen display interface and has a unique receptacle port that accepts either a HARMONIC or an ENSEAL instrument. Connectors (HGA11 for HARMONIC and EGA11 for ENSEAL) are used to enable the generator to power legacy instr uments. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Indications 
ENSEAL X1  
The ENSEAL X1 are bipolar electrosurgical instruments for use with an electrosurgical generator. They are intended for use during open or laparoscopic surgical procedures to cut and seal vessels, and to cut, grasp and dissect tissue during surgery. 
Indications for use include open and laparoscopic general, gynecological, urologic, 
thoracic, and ENT surgical procedures or any procedure where vessel ligation (cutting 
and sealing), tissue graspi[INVESTIGATOR_007], dissection, and division of vessels, lymphatics, and tissue bundles is performed (e.g. bowel resections, hysterectomies, gall bladder procedures, Nissen Fundoplication, adhesiolysis, and oophorectomies). The devices can be used on vessels up to and including [ADDRESS_638993] not been shown to be effective for sterilization procedures or tubal coagulation.  
 
Study Number: ENG_2020_04 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 19 of 33 
Version: Amendment 2   28 JUL 2021 
[IP_ADDRESS] Contraindications 
ENSEAL X1  
The efficacy of the ENSEAL X1 for the indication of contraceptive tubal coagulation 
(permanent female sterilization) has not been evaluated and is unknown. The design of 
the ENSEAL tissue sealing device is significantly different from bipolar designs that are 
marketed for the indication of contraceptive tubal coagulation. The design differences 
may affect the efficacy of the procedure and failure rates may not be comparable. 
GEN11  
The use of the GEN11 and the attached instruments are contraindicated when, in the judgement of the physician, radiofrequency or ultrasonic surgery would be contrary to the best interest of the patient. The instruments are not indicated for incising bone.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Labeling of Study Products 
The ENSEAL X1 has received 510(k)  clearance in the [LOCATION_002] by [CONTACT_4469] (FDA), has CE Mark in the European Union and [LOCATION_008]  
and has  clearance in Japan by [CONTACT_497053] 
(PMDA). The GEN11 has clearance for distribution in the [LOCATION_002] by [CONTACT_1622], has CE mark in the European Union and [LOCATION_008]  and has clearance in Japan by [CONTACT_497054] . The study devices will use the cleared labeling. The Sponsor requires no 
additional labeling in this study.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Accountability of Study Products 
The ENSEAL X1 may be provided to the participating institutions. The GEN11 (including footswitches) may be loaned to any institution in the study. Each institution not provided with ENSEAL X1 will use devices acquired through normal procurement process. If institutions are provided ENSEAL X1, the devices will be tracked using shippi[INVESTIGATOR_497045]. Devices provided for the study must be kept in a secure area and used only for treating subjects participating in the study, in accordance with the protocol.

5.[ADDRESS_639001] one vessel.  
5.3 INTERVAL WINDOWS  
Interval windows for the purpose of analysis in this study will not be defined outside of those already specified in the protocol for visit scheduling as the collection of data for the primary  
and secondary  performance endpoints occur s intra-operatively. The final visit occur s 
approximately 4 weeks after surgery, thus no interval windows need to be defined given the absence of long-term follow -up in this study. The Schedule of Events specifies a window of 
14 days around the scheduling of the 4-week follow-up visit, and any information entered in 
the eCRFs at this visit will correspond to the 4- week visit. There will be no assigning of 
observations to time points outside of the visit to which they are recorded in the eCRFs . 
5.4 PRIMARY AND SECONDARY ENDPOINTS AND ASSOCIATED HYPOTHESES  
All study endpoints are described in Section 2.1 through Section 2.4. No formal hypotheses are specified for this study. The study endpoints are representative of endpoints that are currently reported in the available literature for similar energy devices and this will allow for comparisons with the results from this study . 
5.5 LEVELS OF SIGNIFICANCE  
No hypotheses are specified for this study and no p-values are being calculated, therefore no level of significance is specified. All estimation of endpoints will be performed using 95% confidence intervals . 
5.6 ANALYSIS SETS 
The summary of all performance and safety endpoints will be performed on the set of 
subjects in whom the ENSEAL X1 device is utilized during the surgical procedure. The 
summary of all performance and safety endpoints will be performed by [CONTACT_497059].  
5.7 SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION  
A sample size of 105 to 120 treated subjects is planned for enrollment in this study. No formal hypothesis is being tested in this study, thus the sample size was not statistically 
 
Study Number: ENG_2020_04 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 28 of 33 
Version: Amendment [ADDRESS_639002] 105 transections.  
From a safety perspective on the pooled analysis of 105 subjects and in consideration of r are 
AEs that may occur (e.g., bleeding requiring blood product transfusion), for an event that has an incidence rate of, for example, 2%, then in a sample of [ADDRESS_639003] 1 event is 88.0% under a binomial probability model. Thus, this sample 
size provides a high probability of observing rare events if they do occur, and provides 
reasonable assurance to conclude that the likelihood of such AEs is less than 3.5% if they do not occur based on the upper limit of an exact 95% confidence interval when [ADDRESS_639004] demographics (age, gender, and race) will be presented in 
total and by [CONTACT_212638]. Surgical characteristics including, at minimum, estimated blood loss, requirement for blood transfusion, and procedure duration will be summarized by [CONTACT_497060].  
5.9.4 Primary and Secondary Endpoint Analyses 
The number and percentage of vessels where hemos tasis is achieved (≤ Grade 3) will be 
summarized and an exact 95% confidence interval will be estimated for each procedure 
group ( thoracic , urologic and ENT) and in total . Summary statistics appropriated for 
categorical or continuous variables  will be provided for type, size, and number of vessels 
transected, grading scale distribution for all vessels transected, number of times ENSEAL 
X1 touch-ups were required, incidence of requirement for additional measures to obtain 
hemostasis on vessels  and 5-point scale scores for various tasks completed by [CONTACT_497061] X1 device (adhesiolysis, lymphatics or tissue bundles divided, tissue graspi[INVESTIGATOR_007], tissue cutting, or tissue dissection).   
All device -related and procedure-related AEs reported during the study will be coded to 
MedDRA. All AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_212661]. Separate summaries will be provided for device-related 
and procedure-related AEs. Serious AEs will be summarized in a si milar manner.

It is the I nvestigator ’s responsibility to determine the “seriousness” of a reportable AE. 
A SAE is defined as an AE (as defined in Section 6 .1.1) that results in any of the following: 
• Death; 
• A life -threatening illness or injury;  
• A permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function; 
• Required in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
• Resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening illness or injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function; 
• Led to a fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.  
Note: “Death” should not be reported as an AE. The cause of death should be reported as the AE. The only exception is “Sudden Death”  when the cause is unknown. 
Note: Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre-existing condition, or a procedure required by [CONTACT_760], without serious deterioration in health, is not considered a SAE.  
6.1.[ADDRESS_639007]’s medical history  with a listed start 
date. Any pre -existing condition that has worsened in intensity, frequency, or the character 
of the condi tion, if related to the device or the procedure, should be recorded as a new AE

Version: Amendment 2   28 JUL 2021 
on the AE eCRF, as an exacerbation of the pre-existing condition and the start date will be 
recorded as the time when the exacerbation occurred. 
6.2 SEVERITY OF ADVERSE EVENTS 
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to assess the severity of an AE. A change in severity may 
constitute a new reportable AE. 
The following guideline should be used to determine the severity of each AE: 
• MILD:  A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal 
treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with 
usual activities of daily living . 
• MODERATE:  A type of AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific 
therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, 
causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the 
resear ch participant.  
• SEVERE: A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly 
affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention. 
6.3 R ELATIONSHIP OF ADVERSE EVENTS 
It is the I nvestigator ’s responsibility to assess the relationship of a reportable AE (as defined 
in Section 6 .1.1). Only AEs considered possibly, probably, or causally related to the study 
procedures or the ENSEAL X1 or GEN11 devices are to be recorded in the eCRF and 
reported to the Sponsor. 
The following guidelines should be used in determining the relationship of an AE  in the study : 
• Not related – Relationship to the procedures or device can be excluded when: 
o The event is not a known side effect of the product category the device 
belongs to or of similar devices and procedures;  
o The event has no temporal relationship with the use of the device or the procedures;  
o The event does not follow a known response pattern to the device (if the response pattern is previously known) and is biologically implausible; 
o The discontinuation of the device application or the reduction of the level activation/exposure (when clinically feasible) and reintroduction of its use (or increase of the level of activation/exposure), does not impact on the event;  
o The event involves a body -site or an organ not expected to be affected b y 
the device or the procedure; 
o The event can be attributed to another cause (e.g. an underlying or concurrent illness/clinical condition, an effect of another device, drug, treatment, or other risk factors);  
o Harms to the subject are not clearly due to use error; or  
o To establish the non-relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be met at the same time, depending on the type of device/procedure and the event.  
 
Study Number: ENG_2020_04 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 31 of 33 
Version: Amendment 2   28 JUL 2021 
• Possible – The relationship with the use of the device is weak but cannot be ruled 
out completely. Alternative causes are also possible (e.g. an underlying or 
concurrent illness/condition and/or an effect of another device, drug, or treatment). Cases where relatedness cannot be assessed or no information has been obtained should also be classified as possible. 
• Probable – The relationship with the use of the device seems relevant and/or the 
event cannot reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_5748], but additional information may be obtained. 
• Causal relationship – The event is  associated with the device  or with procedures 
beyond reasonable doubt when: 
o The event is a known side effect of the product category the device belongs to or of similar devices and procedures; 
o The event has a temporal relationship with the device uses/application or procedures;  
o The event involves a body -site or organ that: 
 The device or procedures are applied to; 
 The device or procedures have an effect on;  
o The event follows a known response pattern to the medical device (if the response pattern is previously known); 
o The discontinuation of medical device application (or reduction of the level of activation/exposure) and reintroduction of its use (or increase of the level of activation/exposure), impact on the event (when clinically feasible); 
o Other possible causes (e.g. an underlying or concurrent illness/clinical condition and/or an effect of another device, drug, or treatment) have been adequately ruled out;  
o Harm to the subject is due to error in use; or  
o To establish the relatedness, not all the criteria listed above might be met at the same time, depending on the type of device/procedure and the event.  
6.[ADDRESS_639008] all AEs (both AEs and SAEs) considered attributable 
(relationship of possible, probable, causal relationship) to the study procedure or the ENSEAL X1  or GEN11 devices  in the source documents and eCRF .  
Standard medical terminology should be used when recording AEs . In addition, the 
following information should be recorded: 
• Onset date; 
• Resolution date or date of death; 
• Severity of the event;  
• Indication of whether the event is serious;  
• Relationship of AE to the study device s; 
• Relationship of AE to the study procedure; 
• Action taken; 
 
Study Number: ENG_2020_04 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 32 of 33 
Version: Amendment 2   28 JUL 2021 
• Event status; and 
• W as AE anticipated or not (only for SAEs). 
Data related to AEs will be collected until the event resolution, or until the event is 
considered stable, or until all attempts to determine the resolution of the event are 
exhausted. All AEs that are unresolved at study  completion (or at the last visit completed 
for early withdrawal  subjects) will be recorded as ongoing at study  end. 
6.4.[ADDRESS_639009] be reported by [CONTACT_497062] 72 h ours of becoming aware of the event to the Sponsor by [CONTACT_497063]. A notification containing the pertinent data will be automatically generated 
by [CONTACT_497064] . If applicable, supporting SAE 
documentation should be de-identified and provided to the Clinical Trial Leader . The report 
of an SAE by a study site does not constitute an admission that study  personnel or the 
user facility (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic) caused or contributed to the event. T he study site is also 
responsible for submitting SAEs to the reviewing IRB/EC per their IRB/EC procedures.  
7.[ADDRESS_639010] complaint may or may not be associated with an AE/SAE . 
7.[ADDRESS_639011] be 
emailed to the Sponsor Customer Complaint team at the following email address:  
[EMAIL_6582] 
The sites will report Product Complaints by [CONTACT_340542]. If a product complaint is related to a safety event, the site must complete an AE eCRF as well. 
One copy of the pro cessed form should be kept on-site and the device should be retained. 
Sponsor representatives will organize collection of the device for evaluation as needed. 
Product complaints will be handled in Japan sites using the [COMPANY_012] K.K  
(JJKK) Medical Company specific local standard operating procedures  for product 
complaints. The clinical site will report the product complaint to the site monitor  within 24 
hours. The site monitor  will then email to both JJKK  Quality Assurance and Japan Clinical 
Operations Study lead within 24 hours of awareness . JJKK  Quality Assurance will submit 
 
Study Number: ENG_2020_04 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 33 of 33

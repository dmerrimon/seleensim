S-K≥6.[ADDRESS_418276] of ZS 10 g 
administered up to three times over 10h versus placebo added to insulin and glucose.
Hyperkalaemia is defined as an abnormally  high serum  potassi um (S-K) concentrati on, usually 
greater than 5.0 mmo l/L.  The prevalence has been reported to 3 -4% in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9643], and 
the risk i s consi derably increased in persons wit h advanced chronic kidney disease, heart failure, 
diabetes and/ or treatm ent wi th renin angiotensin -aldosterone inhibitors (Einhorn et al 2009, Fleet 
et al 2012, Kovesdy  2015).  Hy perkalaemia often presents without symptoms or with non -
specific symptoms including malaise, confusio n, muscle weakness or signs of cardiac 
arrhy thmias (Henneman 2016).  The risk of fatal cardiac arrhy thmias is increased especially at 
S-K levels above 6.0 mmo l/L, and the mortalit y risk is increased even with mild elevat ions of 
S-K (S-K > 5.0 mmo l/L), but a causal relationship remains to be est ablished (Einhorn 2009, 
Collins 2014, Nakhoul 2015).
Current management of hyperkalaemia wit h S-K above 6.0 mmo l/L at the emergency  departm ent 
has not been well studied previously (Rossigno l 2016), but frequently includes administration of 
insulin and gluc ose to shift extracellular potassium to the intracellular space. The effect is rapid 
and substantial, but only  lasts for 4 to 6 hours, and therefore further therapi[INVESTIGATOR_338400], e.g. 
hemodialysis or potassium binding drugs. The use of insulin and glucos e as the mainstay  of 
therapy  is recommended by  [CONTACT_338412] m 2005, and in recent literature (Rossigno l 2016, Kovest y 2015, Li  and Vijayan 
2014).
Sodium zirconium  cycl osilicate (ZS) i s a non -absor bed, inorganic cry stalline co mpound that 
select ively captures potassium ions in exchange for sodium and hydrogen ions in the 
gastrointestinal tract after oral administration. Thereby, potassium is remo ved fro m the blood 
stream , decreasing the serum potassi um concentrati on and then rem oving the potassi um from the 
body  through faecal excretion. A glo bal clinical programme including more than 1800 patients 
with hyperkal aemia dem onstrated the efficacy of ZS compared with placebo for correction 
ofhyperkalaemia, with 88% of  patients reaching norm al S-K after 48 hours of treatment with 
ZS10g three times a day  (TID). A detailed description of the chemistry , pharmaco logy, 
efficacy , and safet y of ZS are given in the Invest igators’ Brochure.
The onset of act ion of Z S is slower than for insulin and glucose, but statist ically significant 
lowering of S -K has been demonstrated at 1 hour. The efficacy of ZS, measured as change in 
S-K, appears to increase with higher baseline S -K. Combining insulin and glucose with ZS may

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 14(59)therefore provide enhanced short term as well as lo nger term  lowering of S -K in the emergency 
departm ent setting.
2.2 Benefit/risk assessment
Hyperkalaemia wit h S-K≥6.0 mmo l/L is a potentially life -threatening condit ion. The primary 
potenti al benefi t for pati ents randomized to ZS, insulin and glucose is a more pronounced and 
prolonged decrease of S -K co mpared with pa tients randomized to placebo, insulin and glucose. 
For pati ents wi th hyperkalaemia requiring emergency therapy  this may  significantly decrease the 
need for addit ional treatment for hy perkalaemia (including but not limited to addit ional insulin 
and glucose, beta-agonists, or potassium binding resins).
All rando mized pat ients will receive standard of care treatment for hyperkalaemia and may 
benefit from close medical mo nitoring. Addit ional therapi [INVESTIGATOR_338401].
Patients wi th S-K ≥6.0 mmo l/L may require rapid therapy to minimize the risk of arrhy thmias. 
The study  is therefore designed to allow rapid assessment, randomizat ion and standard of care 
treatm ent of patients to minimize arrhy thmia risk. Furtherm ore, intra venous calcium may be 
administered at the discret ion of the treating physician to minimize the risk of dangerous 
arrhy thmias.
Insulin and glucose therapy  has been reported to be associated with a significant rate of 
hypoglycaemia. The weight based dosing of insulin together with the monitoring schedule was 
selected in order to minimize the risk of hypoglycaemia, and to detect and correct any  
hypoglycaemia if it were to occur.
Hypokal aemia has been reported at a low rate in prior studies with ZS. In this s tudy, subjects will 
receive also insulin and glucose, which could increase th e risk of hypokalaemia. However this 
study  recrui ts pati ents wi th higher S -K (≥5.8 mmo l/L) com pared wi th earlier ZS studi es 
(generally  >5.0mm ol/L), which decreases the risk of hyp okalaemia. Furthermore, the peak effect 
of insulin and glucose is expected to wear off after [ADDRESS_418277]. Hence, the risk for hy pokal aemia is limited.
Detailed informat ion about the known and expected benefit s and risks and reasonably expected 
adverse events of ZS may be found in the ZS Investigator’s Brochure.
The m anagement of hyperkalaemia is poorly researched with few prospective randomized trials 
perform ed previ ously  (Rossignol  et al  2016). ZS may  represent a hel pful addi tion to insulin and 
glucose to m anage emergent hy perkalaemia. This study  therefore has potential to improve the 
scientific basis for the clinical management of hyperkalaemia irrespect ive of outcome by 
[CONTACT_338413], and to improve the 
clinical management of hyperkalaemia if successful. Hence, the limited risk the recruited patients 
will be exposed to is deemed acceptable considering the expected b enefits o f performing the 
trial.

The study  will recrui t pati ents wi th S-K ≥5.8 mmo l/L. Eligible pat ients fulfilling all of the 
inclusio n criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomised in a 1:[ADDRESS_418279] of care therapy  woul d be recrui ted. 
Insulin and glucose w ere chosen as background therapy  based on gui delines (eg. the American 
Heart Associ ation gui delines from  2005) and current practice in most US and European 
emergency depart ments.
The study  design (adding ZS or placebo to insulin and glucose) is consistent with recent

6.2 Preparation/handling/storage/accountability
The invest igator or designee must confirm appro priate temperature condit ions have been 
maintained during transit for all study  treatm ent received and any  discrepancies are reported and 
resolved before use of the study  treatm ent.
Only subjects enro lled in the study  may receive study  treatm ent and only a uthorised site staff 
may supply  or administer study  treatm ent.  All study  treatm ents m ust be stored in a secure, 
environmentally  controlled, and m onitored (m anual  or autom ated) area i n accordance with the 
labelled storage conditions with access limit ed to the invest igator and authorised site staff.
The invest igator, institution, or the head of the medical inst itution (where applicable) is 
responsible for study  treatm ent accountabilit y, reconciliat ion, and record maintenance (i.e., 
recei pt, reconciliat ion, and final disposit ion records).

6.3 Measures to minimise bias: randomisation and blinding
All subjects will be centrally  assigned to randomised study  treatm ent using an interactive 
voice/web response system (IVRS/IWRS). Before the study is init iated, the telephone number 
and call -in directions for the IVRS and/or the log-in informat ion and directions for the IWRS 
will be provided to each site. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_1606] .
If a subject withdraws fro m the study , then his/her enrolment/randomisat ion code cannot be 
reused. Withdrawn subjects will not be rep laced. 
The IVRS/IWRS will provide to the Invest igator(s) or pharmacists the kit ident ificat ion number 
to be allocated to the patient at the dispensing visit .
Routines for this will be described in the IVRS/IWRS user manual that will be provided to each 
centre.
[COMPANY_008] retains the right to break the code for SAEs that are unexpected and are suspected to 
be causally related to an invest igational product and that potentially  require expedi ted reporti ng 
to regulatory  authori ties.
The IVRS/IWRS will be p rogrammed with blind -breaking instructions. The blind may be broken 
if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of the invest igator, it is in the subject’s best interest for the invest igator to know 
the study  treatm ent assignment. The sponsor must be notified before the blind is b roken unless 
ident ificat ion of the study  treatm ent is requi red for a m edical  emergency in which the knowledge 
of the specific blinded study  treatm ent will affect the immediate management of the subject’s 
condi tion. In thi s case, the sponsor must be notifie d within [ADDRESS_418287] been made and documented.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 47(59)Appendix BAdverse event definitions and additional safety information
B1 Definition of advers e events
An adverse event is the development of any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical 
study  subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily  have a causal  
relationship with this treatment.   An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign 
(e.g.  an abnormal laboratory  finding), symptom (for example nausea, chest pain), or disease 
temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal product, whether or not considered related to 
the medicinal product.  
The t erm AE is used to include both serious and non -serious AEs and can include a deterioration 
of a pre -exist ing medical occurrence.  An AE may occur at any  time, including run -in or washout 
periods, even if no Study  treatm ent has been administered.
B2 Definition s of serious adverse event
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study  phase (i .e., run -in, treatment, 
washout, follow -up), that fulfils one or more of the fo llowing cri teria:
•Results in death
•Is immediately life -threatening
•Requi res in -subject hospi [INVESTIGATOR_103421] 
•Results in persistent or significant disabilit y or incapaci ty.  
•Is a congenital abnormalit y or birth defect
•Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the subject or m ay require medical  
treatm ent to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
B3 Life threatening
‘Life -threatening’ means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AEas it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would resul t in the subject ’s 
death.  ‘Life -threatening’ does not mean that had an AEoccurred in a more severe form it might 
have caused death (e.g., hepatit is that resolved without hepat ic failure).
B4 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_338409] i tself a serious AE , although the reasons for 
it may be (e.g., bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema).  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33094]/or surgical 
operati ons planned before or during a study  are not consi dered AEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the subjectwas enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected way  during the study .

situations where important medical events may  not be immediately life threatening or result in 
death, hospi [INVESTIGATOR_72913], disabili ty or incapaci ty but may jeopardize the subject or may require 
medical treatment to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definit ion of serious.  These 
shoul d usually be considered as serious.
Simply stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_33095]; medical 
judgement must be used.
Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocorti sone treatment .
Hepatotoxicit y caused by [CONTACT_33153] l (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment with N -
acetylc ysteine .
Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm .
Blood dy scrasias (e.g., neutropenia or anaemia requiring blood transfusion, etc.) or convulsio ns 
that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_72913].
Development of drug dependency or drug abuse .
B6 Intensity rating scale:
1. mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated)
2. moderate (di scomf ort sufficient to cause interfe rence wi th norm al activi ties)
3. severe (incapacitat ing, with inabilit y to perform norm al activities)
It is important to dist inguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severit y is a measure of intensit y 
whereas seriousness is defined by  [CONTACT_244986] B2. An AE of severe intensit y need 
not necessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be 
considered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria shown in Appendix B2. On 
the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disabilit y may be considered a 
mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria shown in Appendix B2.
B7 A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question
When making an assessment of causalit y consi der the foll owing f actors when deciding if there is 
a ‘reasonable possibilit y’that an AE m ay have been caused by  [CONTACT_33641].
Time Course.  Exposure to suspect drug.  Has the subject actually received the suspect drug?  
Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relat ionship to the administration of the suspect drug?
Consist ency wit h known drug profile.  Was the AE consistent with the previous knowledge of 
the suspect drug (pharmaco logy and toxi cology) or drugs of the same pharmacological class? Or 
could the AE be ant icipated fro m its pharmaco logical  properti es?
Clinical Study Protocol -2.0 [COMPANY_008]
Sodium Zirconium Cyclosilicate (ZS) -D9480C00005
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 49(59)De-challenge experience.  Di d the AE resolve or improve on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_338410]?
No al ternative cause.  The AE cannot be reasonably  explained by [CONTACT_244987], other drugs, other host or environmental factors.
Re-challenge experi ence.  Di d the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced after 
having been stopped? [COMPANY_008] would not normally reco mmend or support a re-challenge .
Laboratory  tests.  A specific laboratory  invest igation (if performed ) has confirmed the 
relationship .
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
Is this a recogni zedfeature of overdose of the drug?
Is there a known mechanism?
Causalit y of ‘related’ is m ade if fo llowing a review of the relevant data, th ere is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibilit y’of a causal relationship for the individual case.  The expressio n 
‘reasonable possibilit y’ of acausal relationship is meant to convey, in general , that there are facts 
(evidence) or arguments to suggest a cau sal relationship.
The causalit y assessment i s perform ed based on the available data including enough information 
to make an informed judgment.  With limited or insufficient information in the case, it is likely  
that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not re lated’.
Causal relat ionship in cases where the disease under study  has deteri orated due to l ack of effect 
shoul d be classified as no reasonable possibilit y.
B8 Medication Error
For the purposes of this clinical study  a medicat ion error is an unintended failure or mistake in 
the treatment process for an [COMPANY_008] study  drug that ei ther causes harm to the participant or 
has the potential to cause harm to the participant.  
A medi cation error is not lack of efficacy o f the drug, but rather a human or process related 
failure while the drug is in control of the study  site staff or parti cipant.
Medicat ion error inc ludes situat ions where an error:   
•occurred
•was i dentified and intercep ted before the participant received the drug
•did not occur, but circumstances were recognized that could have led to an error

Sodium Zirconium Cyclosilicate (ZS) -D9480C00005
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 50(59)Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors:
•Drug name [CONTACT_33165] n
•Dispensing error e.g.  medication prepared incorrectly , even if i t was not actually  given to 
the participant
•Drug not administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong site of 
administration
•Drug not taken as indicated e.g.  tablet disso lved in water when it should be taken as a 
solid tablet 
•Drug not stored as instructed e.g.  kept in the fridge when it should be at room 
temperature 
•Wrong participant received the medicat ion (excluding IVRS/IWRS errors)
•Wrong drug administered to participant (excluding IVRS/IWRS errors)
Example s of events that do not require reporting as medicat ion errors in clinical studies:
•Errors related to or resulting fro m IVRS/IWRS -including those which lead to one of the 
above listed events that would otherwise have been a medication error 
•Parti cipant accidentally  missed drug dose(s) e.g.  forgot to take medication
•Accidental  overdose (will be captured as an overdose)
•Parti cipant f ailed to return unused medicat ion or empt y packaging
•Errors related to background and rescue medicat ion, or standard of care medication in 
open l abel studi es, even if an AZ product 
•Medicat ion errors are not regarded as AEs but AEs may  occur as a consequence of the 
medicat ion error.

A full chain o f custody is maintained for all samples throughout their lifecycle.
The Investigator at each centre keeps full traceability of co llected bio logical sam ples f rom the 
subjects while in storage at the centre until shipment or disposal (where appropriate).
The sampl e receiver keeps full traceabilit y of the sam ples while in storage and during use unt il 
used or disposed of or until further shipment and keeps documentation of receipt of arrival.
[COMPANY_008] will keep oversight of the entire life cycle through internal p rocedures, m onitoring 
of study  sites, audi ting or process checks, and contractual requirements of external laboratory  
provi ders.
Samples retained for further use will be stored in the AZ -assigned bi obanks and will be 
registered by  [CONTACT_338435] T eam during the ent ire life cycle.
C2 Withdrawal of Informed Consent for donated biological samples 
If a subject with draws consent to the use of donated bio logical samples, the sam ples will  be 
disposed of/destroy ed, and the acti on documented.  If samples are already  analysed ,[COMPANY_008] 
is not obliged to destroy  the resul ts of this research.
As collect ion of the bio logical sample(s) i s an integral  part of the study , then the subject i s 
withdrawn from  further study  parti cipat ion. 
The Investigator:
•Ensures subjects’ wit hdrawal o f informed consent to the use of donated samples is 
notified immediately to [COMPANY_008]
•Ensures that biological samples from that subject, if stored at the study  site, are 
immediately  identified, disposed of /destroy ed, and the action documented

International Airline Transportation Associat ion (IATA) classifies bio hazardous agents into 3 
categori es 
(http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dangerous_goods/infectious_substances.htm ). For 
transport purposes the classificat ion of infe ctious substances according to risk groups was 
removed from  the Dangerous Goods Regulat ions in the 46th edition (2005). Infect ious 
substances are now classified eit her as Category  A, Category  B or Exem pt. There is no direct 
relationship between Risk Groups and Categories A and B.
Category A Infectious Substances are infect ious substances in a form that, when exposure to it 
occurs, is capable of causing permanent disabilit y, life -threatening or fatal  disease in otherwi se 
healt hy humans or animals. Category  Apathogens are eg, Ebola, Lassa fever virus:
are to be packed and shipped in accordance wit h IATA Instruction 602.
Category B Infectious Substances are infect ious Substances that do not meet the criteria for

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 53(59)Appendix DActions required in cases of increases in liver biochemistry and 
evaluation of Hy’s Law
D1 Introduction
This Appendix describes the process to be fo llowed in order to ident ify and appropriately report 
cases o f Hy’s Law.  It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to the management of 
elevated liver biochemistries. 
During the course of the study  the Invest igator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry .  The Invest igator is responsible for dete rmining whether a subject meets potential 
Hy’s Law (PHL) criteria at any  point during the study .
The Investigator participates, together with [COMPANY_008] clinical project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meet ing PHL criteria to agree whet her Hy’s Law (HL) criteria 
are met.  HL criteria are met if there is no alternat ive explanat ion for the el evations in liver 
biochemistry  other than drug induced liver injury  (DILI) caused by  [CONTACT_338437] (IP).  
The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for reporting 
AE and SAE according to the outcome o f the review and assessment in line wit h standard safet y 
reporting processes.
D2 Definitions
Potential Hy’s Law (PHL)
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 3× upper limit of normal 
(ULN) together with total bilirubin (TBL) ≥ 2×ULN at any  point during the study  following the 
start of study  medicat ion  irrespect ive of an increase in alkaline phosphatase (ALP).  
Hy’s Law (HL)
AST or ALT ≥ 3× ULN  together with TBL ≥ 2×ULN, where no other reason, other than the 
IMP, can be found to explain the combinat ion of increases, eg, elevated ALP indicating 
cholestasis, viral hepat itis, another drug.  
For PHL and HL the elevat ion in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (ie, on the 
same day ) the el evati on in TBL, but there is no specified time frame wit hin which the elevations 
in transaminases and TBL must occur.
D3 Identification of potential Hy’s Law cases
In order to identify cases of PHL it is important to perform a comprehensive review of laboratory 
data for any  subject who m eets any of the fo llowing i dentificat ion criteria in iso lation or in 
combinat ion:
ALT ≥ 3×ULN
AST ≥ 3×ULN
Clinical Study Protocol -2.0 [COMPANY_008]
Sodium Zirconium Cyclosilicate (ZS) -D9480C00005
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 54(59)TBL ≥ 2×ULN
When a subject meets any o f the identificat ion criteria, in isol ation or in combination, the central 
laboratory  will immediately send an alert to the Investigator (and also to the [COMPANY_008] 
representative).  
TheInvesti gator will also rem ain vigilant for any  local  laboratory  reports where the 
ident ificat ion criteria are met, where this is the case the Investigator will:
•Notify  the [COMPANY_008] representative
•Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by  [CONTACT_27671]
•Com plete the appropri ate unscheduled laboratory  CRF m odule(s) wi th the ori ginal  local 
laboratory  test resul t
When the identificat ion criteria are m et from central  or local laboratory  resul ts the Invest igator 
will wit hout del ay:
•Determine wh ether the subject meets PHL criteria (see Appendix D2for definit ion) by 
[CONTACT_33156] (incl uding both cent ral and local 
laboratory  resul ts)
The Investigator will wit hout delay review each new laboratory  report and if the ident ificat ion 
criteria are met will:
•Notify  the [COMPANY_008] representative
•Determine whether the subject meets PHL criteria (see Ap pendix D2for definit ion) by 
[CONTACT_33156]
•Prom ptly enter the laboratory  data into the l aboratory  CRF
D4 Follow -up
D4.1 Potential Hy’s Law criteria not met
If the subject does not meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:
•Inform  the [COMPANY_008] representative that the subject has not met PHL criteria.
•Perform  follow-up on subsequent laboratory  resul ts according to the guidance provided 
in the Clinical Study  Protocol .

Clinical Study Protocol -2.0 [COMPANY_008]
Sodium Zirconium Cyclosilicate (ZS) -D9480C00005
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 55(59)If the subject does meet PHL criteria the Invest igator will:
•Determine whether PHL criteria were met at any  study  visit prior to starting Study  
treatm ent (See Secti on8.4 Safet y Reporting)
•Notify  the [COMPANY_008] representative who will then inform the central Study  Team  
The Study  Physician contacts the Invest igator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree an 
approach for the study  subjects’ foll ow-up an d the continuous review of data.  Subsequent to this 
contact [CONTACT_48887]:
•Moni tor the subject until liver biochemistry  parameters and appropriate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically indicated 
•Invest igate the aetiology o f the event and perform diagnostic investigat ions as discussed 
with the Study  Physician.  For studies using a central laboratory  add: This includes 
deciding which the tests available in the Hy’s law lab kit should be used.
•Com plete the three Liver CRF Modules as information becomes available 
If at any  time (in consultat ion with the Study  Physici an)the PHL case meets serious criteria, 
report i t as an SAE using standard reporting procedures.
D5 Review and assessment of potential Hy’s Law cases
The instructions in this sect ion shoul d be fo llowed for all  cases where PHL cri teria are m et.
No later than [ADDRESS_418320] and TBL elevat ions, a 
determinat ion of whether the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE will be made and subsequent ly 
whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE:
•If the alternat ive explanat ion is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate CRF
•If the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE/SAE, record the AE /SAE in the CRF accordingly 
and fo llow the AZ standard processes
If it is agreed that there is no explanat ion that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the IMP:
Clinical Study Protocol -2.0 [COMPANY_008]
Sodium Zirconium Cyclosilicate (ZS) -D9480C00005
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 56(59)Report an SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to [COMPANY_008] standard processes.  
The ‘Medically  Important’ seri ous cri terion shoul d be used if no other serious 
criteria apply
As there is no alternat ive explanation for the HL case, a causalit y assessment of 
‘related’ should be assigned.
If there is an unavo idable delay o f over 3 weeks in obtaining the informat ion necessary  to assess 
whether or no t the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no alternative 
explanat ion until such time as an informed decisio n can be made:
•Report an SAE (report term ‘Potential Hy’s Law’) applying serious criteria and causalit y 
assessment as pe r above
•Continue fo llow-up and review according to agreed plan.  Once the necessary  
supplementary  informat ion is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to determine 
whether HL criteria are met.  Update the SAE report according to the outcome of the 
review amending the reported term if an alternative explanat ion for the liver biochemistry  
elevations is determined.
D6 Actions required when potential Hy’s Law criteria are met before and 
after starting study treatment
This sect ion is applicable to subjects who meet PHL criteria on Study treatment having 
previously me t PHL cri teria at a study  visit pri or to starti ng Study  treatm ent.
At the first on -study  treatm ent occurrence of PHL cri teria being met, the Invest igator will 
determine if there has been a significant change in the subjects’ condit ion#compared wi th the 
last vi sit where PHL cri teria were m et. 
If there is no significant change, no action is required .
If there is a significant change, notify the [COMPANY_008] representative, who will inform the 
central  Study  Team , then foll ow the subsequen t process described in Appendix B5.
A ‘significant’ change in the subject’s condit ion refers to a clinically  relevant change in any of 
the individual liver biochemistry  parameters (ALT, AST or total bilirubin) in iso lation or in 
combinat ion, or a clinically  relevant change in associated symptoms.  The determinat ion of 
whether there has been a significant change will be at the discret ion of th e Invest igator, this may 
be in consultation wit h the Study  Physician if there is any  uncertaint y.
D7 Actions required for repeat epi[INVESTIGATOR_72921]’s Law
This sect ion is applicable when a subject meets PHL criteria on study  treatm ent, and has already 
met PHL criteria at a previous on study  treatment visit.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 57(59)The requi rement to conduct fo llow-up, revi ew, and assessment of a repeat occurrence(s) of PHL 
is based on the nature of the alternat ive cause identified for the previous occurrence.  
The invest igator should determine the cause for t he previous occurrence of PHL criteria being 
met and answer the fo llowing quest ion:
Was the alternat ive cause for the previous occurrence o f PHL cri teria being met found to be the 
disease under study  (eg, chroni c or progressing malignant disease, severe in fection or liver 
disease), 
If No: Follow the process described in Appendix D4.1.
If Yes: Determine if there has been a significant#change in the subject’s condi tion com pared 
with when PHL cri teria were previously  met.
If there is no significant change, no action is required.
If there is a significant change, fo llow the process described in Appendix D4.
A ‘significant’ change in the subject’s condit ion refers to a clinically  relevant change in any of 
the individual liver biochemistry  parameters (ALT, AST or total bilirubin) in iso lation or in 
combinat ion, or a clinically  relevant change in associated symptoms.  The determinat ion of 
whether there has been a significant change will be at the discret ion of the Invest igator; this may

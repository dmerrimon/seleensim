TITLE: The Synergistic Effect of Dexmedetomidine on Propofol for Sedation for Pediatric 
Endoscopy  
Propofol is a sedative that is currently being used for sedation of child ren for upper and lower 
endoscopic studies in [LOCATION_011] Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Dexmedetomidine is another sedative that is 
currently being used for sedation in BCH in the ICU and in radiology.  Dexmedetomidine is a selective 
alpha -[ADDRESS_1109066], and one advantage i n using dexmedetomidine is the lack of respi[INVESTIGATOR_803360].  
 
It has been shown that with concomitant use, dexmedetomidine reduced the need for higher doses of 
anesthetics (Aantaa, 1990; Rao 2014), opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (Gur bet, 2006; Pestieau, 2011), sedatives (Le Guen, 
2014) and neuromuscular block agents (Memis, 2008). In adults, dexmedetomidine decreased  propofol 
requirement s for maintenance of optimum depth of anaesthesia during elective spi[INVESTIGATOR_79477]  (Sen, 
2013).  
 
In ch ildren, dexmedetomidine reduced the dose of analgesics (Al -Zaben, 2010). Dexmed etomidine 
also reduced  propofol requirements during bispectral index -guided closed -loop anesthesia  in adults (Le 
Guen, 2014).  
 
This study will compare the propofol requirements of children who receive propofol with that of 
children who receive dexmedetomidine prior to propofol, for sedation for upper and lower endoscopic 
procedures .  
This study will also compare adverse events and other markers of outcome s between the two groups.   
Adverse event capture will begin at the time of the first study -related procedure and continue through 
until the time at which a phone call will be attempted to the patient/parent in the first business day 
following the procedure. Adverse event s are cons ider any untoward medical occurrence s associated 
with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  These are summarized in 
section E.  
A. Specific Aims/Objectives  
Primary objective : To compare  the propofol requirements (mg/kg) of children who receive 
intravenous propofol with pre-treatment of dexmedetomidine with those of children who do not 
receive dexmedetomidine.  
Secondary objective : To compare the frequency of adverse events and the need for airway 
interventions  during  the sedati on and the recovery period in patients who received dexmedetomidine 
prior to propofol versus patients who received propofol only  
Version 4: May 25th, [ADDRESS_1109067] to:  
-Time required to achieve sedation  
- Need for supplemental sed ation d uring the imaging study  
- Time required to meet dischar ge criteria from recovery room  
- Adverse events  
- Need for unplanned airway interventions  
 
- Duration of the sedation, need for supplemental doses of medication  
- Emergence Delirium (PAED score)  
- Return of BIS score to baseline (pre -sedation level) in recovery room   
B. Background and Significance  
Both propofol and dexmedetomidine may be used to achieve adequate sedation conditions. Propofol 
has been described to produce successful conditions for com pletion of the intended study in almost 
99% of the patients. However, in a  study that reviewed outcome s when using  propofol for almost 
50,[ADDRESS_1109068] and 
ventilation interventions which include oral/nasal airway placement, positive pressure mask 
ventilation and tracheal intubation occurred at a rate of 1 in 70 sedations.  Hemodynamic and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_803361] a minimum of 30% fluctuations in heart rate, blood pressure or 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_803362] a rate of [ADDRESS_1109069] drug s administered for sedation in children who require 
radiologic  diagnostic imaging studies (MRI, CT and Nuclear Medicine) in the Department of 
Radiology at BCH. Over 17,[ADDRESS_1109070] ration of dexmedetomidine with propofol administration will 
result in lower doses of the latter, which may mean safer outcomes in sedation for upper and lower 
endoscopic procedures.  
C. Preliminary Studies  
      There are currently no preliminary studies a vailable on the synergy  of dexmedetomidine with 
propofol administration in comparison to propofol only for pediatric endoscopy .

 Recruitment Methods  
 
i. HOW , WHERE and WHEN will potential subjects be recruited ?  
 
All outpatients who are scheduled for sedation for upper or lower endoscopy will be screened 
for eligibility to participate in the study.   The consent form will be mailed to potential 
families  of eligible patients  for review up to [ADDRESS_1109073] 24 hours prior to the scheduled hospi[INVESTIGATOR_21186]. All 
families will also be given ample time to read the consent form on arrival to the department 
prior to giving written consent.  The consent form will be signed by [CONTACT_7071] , or patient if 
the patient is older than 18 years of age  (and assent given by [CONTACT_803377] ) on 
the day of the schedu led study after any additional questions are answered.  A follow -up 
phone call will also be attempted the first business day after the procedure to identify if any 
adverse events have taken place post discharge and also to answer any additional questions 
parents may have post study participation. If the family is not able to be reached, an 
additional phone ca ll will be made within the first week following the procedure. If possible, 
a voicemail will be left. If not returned, a second call will be attempted within [ADDRESS_1109074] any questions or concerns.  
Version 4: May 25th, 2018  
 ii. WHAT recruitment methods and materials (e.g. posters, fliers) will be used? - attach all 
materia ls 
The consent form along with  an information al brochure containing  a brief description of the 
study will be distributed in advance to all potential study candidates.  
iii. WHO will be responsible for subject recruitment?   
 
  Subject recruitment will be and the responsibility of  designated  members of the research team  
  working within the Department of Anesthesiology . 
 
(3) Description of Study Treatments or Exposures/Predictors  
Intravenous catheters will be initiated as per standard clinical protocol  in ga strointestinal 
endoscopy unit . Patients may also choose not to have any adjuvant local anesthesia prior to 
initiation of intravenous access.   All patients will have baseline vital signs (already described) 
documented prior to induction.  Those undergoing upper endoscopy will have [ADDRESS_1109075] clinical care. All patients 
will receive 4 L of supplemental oxygen by [CONTACT_803378].  
 
Patients who are randomized into the Dexmedetomidine Group  (DP)  
 
Patie nts in Group DP will receive 0.5  mcg/kg DEX administered over 1 minute followed by [CONTACT_446113] 0.1 5 mcg/ kg/hr.  Following the 0.5  mcg/kg DEX bolus, propofol will be 
administered with the identical protocol (with same  endpoint of BIS 40 -50) of the P Group. 
Propofol infusion will  be started at 200 mcg/kg/ min and will  be titrated throughout the 
procedure to maintain a BIS 40 -50, up to a maximum of 350 mcg/kg/min .  Propofol may be 
administered prn in 10 -20 mg increments f or any abrupt patient movement which may 
compromise the continuity of the procedure.  Ondansetron (Zofran) 0. 1 mg/kg IV will be 
administered after induction. The DEX infusion in the DP group will remain constant throughout 
the procedure, and will be discon tinued at the termination of the procedure, simultaneous with 
the discontinuation of the propofol infusion.  For both Group P and DP, the propofol infusion 
will remain until the termination of the procedure.  At termination of procedure, monitors will 
rema in and patient will be transported to recovery room for continuation of monitoring as 
indicated below.  
  
No narcotics, no benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_803365] .   
 
Patients undergoing a  lower endoscopy after a bowel prep, will receive a goal of 20 mL/kg 
saline prior to termination of procedure.   
 
Patients who are randomized into the Propofol  Group  (Group P)   
Patients in Group P will receive intravenous propofol in bolus increments ( 1.0 to 2.0 mg/kg 
bolus over one minute then 0.5 mg/kg bolus q 1 minute  titrated to a BIS of 40 -50).  Ondansetron 
(Zofran) 0. 1 mg/kg IV will be administered after induction. These pat ients will be maintained 
with a continuous  intravenous infusion of propofol  starting at 200 mcg/kg/ min and will be  
Version 4: May 25th, 2018  
 titrated to an endpoint of maintaining a BIS level of 40 -50, up to a maximum of 350 
mcg/kg/min.  Propofol may be administered prn in 10 -20 mg increments for any abrupt patient 
movement which may compromise the continuity  of the procedure  
 
If any member of the child’s  care team, at any time for any reason, believes the patient  should be 
taken off the study, participating in the study will end immediately and the child’s  care will 
continue at the discretion of the anesthesi ologist . Additionally, an inability to perform procedure 
because of inadequate sedation administered following this protocol will result in the child being 
withdrawn from the study. Additionally, if there is a need for pharmacologic intervention for 
respir atory or hemodynamic instability and the patient receives cardiovascular resuscitation with 
the AHA’s Pediatric Advanced Life Support protocol, they will immediately be taken off the 
study and care will continue at the discretion of the anesthesiologist. I f the unanticipated need 
for endotracheal intubation or an inhalation -based general anesthetic (which may be related to 
the procedure as well as to the sedation) arises, the child will be taken off the study and care will 
continue at the discretion of the anesthesiologist.  
 
If any one patient experiences a sentinel event, as described in Figure 1, the study will 
immediately be stopped. Appropriate reports will be made to the IRB and FDA. If more than 5 
patients in any one group require a bag mask valve, an oral/nasal airway or CPAP, the study will 
also be stopped and the FDA and IRB will be notified.  In addition, if more than 5 patients 
require two or more weight -based IV fluid boluses following hemodynamic changes, the study 
will be stopped and the FDA and IRB will be notified.  
(4) Definition of Primary and Secondary Outcomes/Endpoints  
The primary outcomes will be : Dosage/consumption  of propofol (mg/kg) in children who 
receive intravenous propofol with pre-treatment of dexmedetomidine to the consumption of 
children who do not receive dexmedetomidine.  
 
 
The Secondary outcomes will be:  
-Time required to achieve sedation  
- Need for supplemental sed ation during the imaging study  
- Time required to meet dischar ge criteria from recovery room  
- Incedence of advers e events (defined in Figure 1)  
- Need for unplanned airway interventions  
- Duration of the sedation, need for supplemental doses of medication  
- Incidence of Emergence Delirium (PAED score)  
- Time of BIS score to return baseline (pre -sedation level) in re covery room  
 
(5) Data Collection Methods, Assessments, Interventions and Schedule (what 
assessments performed, how often)  
• Data points as outlined in table 1.  
• Rams ay Sedation Score (RSS) -at termination of initial dexmedetomidine or propofol bolus, on 
arrival to recovery room, and every fifteen minutes after arrival in recovery room until 
discharged home  
Version 4: May 25th, 2018  
 • University of Michigan Sedation Score (UMSS) - at termination of initial dexmedetomidine or 
propofol bolus, on arrival to recovery room, and every fifteen m inutes after arrival in recovery 
room until discharged home  
• Time to meet baseline BIS (pre -sedation level) in the recovery room.  
• Time to meet modified Aldrete discharge criteria  (current standard) - measured in minutes from 
the time at which the infusion d iscontinued to the time at which the patient achieves a 
minimum Aldrete score of 9  
• Occurrence of Failed Sedation: Defined as a Failure to sedate with designated protocols.   
• The occurrence of any adverse events (Table 2) and the need for supplemental airwa y 
interventions (Table 3) will be documented  
• Heart Rate (HR), Oxygen Saturation (O 2 sat), Respi[INVESTIGATOR_13581] (RR), Non Invasive Blood 
Pressure Monitoring (NIBP) (systolic, diastolic and Mean Arterial Blood Pressure/MAP) will 
be measured and documented via c omputerized record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_803366], 
every 5 minutes after the initiation of the dexmedetomidine or propofol bolus and throughout 
the infusion period, then every 5 minutes in recovery room until the patient meets discharge 
criteria (modi fied Aldrete score of 9 or greater), after which these parameters will be measured 
at 15 minute intervals until the patient leaves the recovery room.  Any deviation in blood 
pressure outside of the 20% accepted norms, will be treated with 20% 0.9 NS fluid boluses (to 
a maximum of two fluid boluses). Deviations in heart rate are not considered by [CONTACT_80826][INVESTIGATOR_803367] a 
concurrent instability in blood pressure, perfusion, electrocar diogram, pulse oximetry or 
capnography.  The treatment of bradycardia in patients receiving dexmedetomidine with 
anticholinergics is discouraged because such treatment has previously resulted in extreme 
hypertension.  
• Electrocardiogram will be monitored.  
• An independent observer (designated member of the research team ) will document adverse 
events and the need for airway interventions (Table 2 and 3).  
• Hemodynamic and respi[INVESTIGATOR_803368], (thus eliminatin g bias with respect to identifying fluctuations in blood pressure, 
heart rate and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]).  
• PAED Score on arrival and q15min (or sooner if change of patient behavior) and immediately 
prior to discharge  
• If the endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_803369], they will score 
the quality of sedation at the end of the case with the Adapted Dartmouth Operative Conditions 
Scale  below (Chandran, 2017).  
 
 
Version 4: May 25th, 2018  
 (6) Study Timeline (as applicable)  
We plan to enroll [ADDRESS_1109076] udy at [LOCATION_011] Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].   We anticipate that this 
study will take up to [ADDRESS_1109077] any obvious improvement in the DP group with a view to terminating the study early.  
E. Adverse Event Criteria and Reporting Procedures  
The World SIVA adverse sedation event reporting tool (Figure 1) will be used to document and 
track adverse eve nts (Mason, 2012) .  All ad verse events will be reported to the Radiology and 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_803370].  These events will be  reviewed by [CONTACT_803379]. 
According to the recommendations laid out in the Safety Reporting Requirements for INDs and 
BA/BE Studies  guide, adverse events that are  both serious and unexpected, associated with the use 
of the drug will be reported to the FDA.  According t o 21 CFR 312.32, a n “adverse event or 
suspected adverse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life -threatening adverse event, 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant 
incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect.”  
 
Subjects/parents may opt to remove themselves/their child  from the study at any point in time.  
Version 4: May 25th, 2018  
 
 
Figure 1. World SIVA adverse sedation event reporting tool  
F. Data Management Methods  
Patient demographic, adverse events and hemodynamic data will be entered into an InForm database 
and then exported into the SAS sy stem for statistical analysis (version 9.2, SAS Institute, Cary, NC).  
 
G. Quality Control Method  
Version 4: May 25th, [ADDRESS_1109078] quality and accuracy, research team personnel will routinely 
check and monitor data entry, missing data, and any i nconsistencies.  
H. Data Analysis Plan  
Baseline characteristic s will be compared between the d exmedetomidine  and propofol  (DP) treatment 
group and the p ropofol (P) treatment group  to determine any baseline imbalances which ma y occur 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_39470]. Student  t-test will be used to compare continuous (normally -distributed data) 
and Fisher’s exact test for comparing binary proportions. Airway obstruction and other adverse event 
rates will be assessed and 95% confidence intervals will be constructed using  Wilson’s method 
(Newcombe 1998). Multivariate logistic regression will be applied to identify any variables (age, 
gender, ASA status, treatment) that are correlated with adverse events and with hemodynamic outcome 
exceeding the 20% boundary above the uppe r normal age -based reference range.  Time to sedation, 
procedure time, and time to meet discharge criteria will be compared between Dexmedetomidine and 
Propofol groups using two -sample t-tests with analysis of variance (ANOVA) used to adjust for 
covariates  such as age, gender and ASA classification which could influence the results. Two -tailed 
values of P<0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis will be performed using 
SAS statistical software (version 9.2, SAS Institute, Cary , NC).  
I. Statistical Power and Sample Considerations  
Power analysis indicated that a sample size of 32 patients randomly assigned to dexmedetomidine and 
propofol will provide 80% power (2 -tailed α = 0.05, β = 0.20) to detect a 50% difference (25% vs. 
75%) in the propofol dose using a chi -square test of binomial proportions between two independent 
groups. To account for 10% possible dropout, we will increase this sample size to [ADDRESS_1109079]. Keira Mason from the Department of Anesthesia, 
Perioperative and Pain Medicine at [LOCATION_011] Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
K. Data and Safety Monitorin g Plan  
[CONTACT_543623] and approved members of the research team will be responsible for all data and safety 
monitoring. An independent data monitor will also be part of this group.  Data and safety monitoring 
will be reviewed every [ADDRESS_1109080] caused or contributed to the serious reaction, then this will be reported to the IRB and the 
study halted until a risk/benefit assessment can be made. An interim analysis will be performed after 
[ADDRESS_1109081] of care for sedation in the GI Suite for upper and lower endoscopic procedures in 
Version 4: May 25th, 2018  
 BCH. For the patients randomized to  the DP treatment group, there is a slight increase in risk over the 
P group. However, these medications are commonly used together at [LOCATION_011] Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_803371]. There are limited studies for administering both drugs in pediatri c patients; 
however, these studies have shown dexmedetomidine to be a safe and effective agent with beneficial 
effects.  
M. Potential Benefits  
The patients in the P group will not receive an immediate, direct benefit from participation in the 
study, aside f rom the sedation received.  In the future, following completion of this study, we 
anticipate that the results obtained from this study will guide us in optimizing patient care by 
[CONTACT_803380]. The  patients in the DP 
group have the  potential for an increased chance of  emergence delirium, decrease d need for  analgesic s 
and decrease d propofol requirements . Decreasing the dose of propofol may decrease the risk of airway 
complications associated with pro pofol  
N. Privacy Provisions  
Access to the electronic database will be restricted to IRB approved study staff and will be password 
protected.   
O. Confidentiality Provisions  
The privacy of the study subjects will be maintained. Only the investigators and IR B approved 
members of the study team will know the identity of the subject whose data is being analyzed. Prior to 
analysis, all HIPAA identifiers will be removed. Data will be stored securely in a locked cabinet in a 
locked office. Research subject identif iers will be removed, linked or destroyed as soon as possible. 
The only document that contains a link to the identity of subjects will be kept securely in a locked 
cabinet in a locked office.

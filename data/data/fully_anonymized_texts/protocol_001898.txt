B2.  BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE    14 
 15 
Carbohydrate Availability and Physical Performance:  Carbohydrate is a readily available fuel source in 16 
skeletal muscle, providing necessary energy to  sustain physical performance (1).  The body’s ability to 17 
store carbohydrate as glycogen is however limited, and can be altered daily by [CONTACT_693771], as well as 18 
exercise type,  intensity and duration (2).  Depletion of glycogen stores with prolonged strenuous physical 19 
activity is associated with fatigue, resulting in reduced work capacity (3).  If glycogen stores are not 20 
sufficiently replenished during recovery from exercise, physical performance may be diminished during 21 
subsequent exercise bouts.  As military personnel often engage in sustained physical activity, with mission 22 
requirements limiting  time available to eat, service members can experience degraded ability to sustain 23 
strenuous physical activi ty during military operations (4).  Understanding  how carbohydrate metabolism is [ADDRESS_941058]-exercise recovery  nutrition is crucial for development of nutrition 25 
intervention s aimed to maintain glycogen stores during military operations to mitigate diminished physical 26 
performance.  27 
 28 
Molecular Regulation of Carbohydrate Metabolism:  The molecular regulation of carbohydrate 29 
metabolism in skeletal muscle is a complex network influenced by [CONTACT_200801], such as glucose , energy  30 
availability, muscle contraction, and hormonal environment  (e.g., insulin)  (5).  Modulation in one or more of 31 
these factors results in a shift in  the cellular environment , which initiates activation (e.g., phosphorylation / 32 
dephosphorylation) of signaling pathways that control glucose uptake and storage (6).  Specific to exercise - 33 
induced glycogen depletion, diminished glycogen stores stimulate the upregul ation of adenosine 34 
monophosphate -activated protein kinase (AMPK)  to enhance glucose uptake and oxidation .  Activation of 35 
AMPK phosphorylat es AKT substrate 160 (AS160) resulting in  glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation 36 
to the cell membrane to increase  glucose uptake (7).  Upregulation of AMPK also stimulate glucose 37 
breakdown (i.e., glycolysis) through elevated hexokinase activity to increase energy availability in the cell 38 
(8).  Along with AMPK, peroxisome proliferator -activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 -alpha (PGC -1α) is 39 
considered a ke y regulator of energy metabolism (9).  When energy availability is limited within the muscle, 40 
PGC -1α is upregulated (9).  Activation of PGC -1α modulates the activity of its downstream targets, 41 
including peroxisome proliferator -activated receptors ( PPARs) and estrogen -related receptorα (ERRα), 42 
which govern fatty acid β -oxidation and carbohydrate oxidation through  the tricarboxylic acid cycle (10).  43 
When there is an increased concentration of circulating glucose and insulin with carbohydrate 44 
consumption, AMPK and PGC -1α are downregulated to inhibit carbohydrate oxidation and increase 45 
carbohydrate storage (11).  Elevated insulin concentrations result  in insulin binding to its receptor at the 46 
membrane of cell, resulting in phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) which stimulates 47 
GLUT4 translocation to enha nce glucose uptake and storage (12).  Together , these molecular processes 48 
tightly regulate glucose uptake, glycolysis, and fatty acid oxidation to ensure adequate  energy availabili ty to 49 
support cellular function .   50

 microRNA and Carbohydrate Metabolism  Recently, a new class of small noncoding RNAs, termed 1 
microRNA, has been identified as critical regulators of energy homeostas is and carbohydrate metabolism 2 
(13).  Through negative inhibition, microRNA can influence molecular processes by [CONTACT_693772] [ADDRESS_941059] -transcriptional modifications that repr ess the transl ation of protein (14). microRNA - 4 
dependent gene regulation is a complex process, as one microRNA can regulate hundreds to thousands of 5 
genes (15).  The ability for one microRNA to inhibit the expression of a large number of genes allows a [ADDRESS_941060] regulation of 7 
an entire molecular process (16).  Additionally, one gene can be targeted by [CONTACT_693773], resulting 8 
in cooperative / redundant regulation of a signal molecular process (15).  This tight regulation that 9 
microRNA exert on cellular ne tworks  (17) suggests microRNA have may be an important mechanism 10 
controlling skeletal muscle plasticity (18).   [ADDRESS_941061] that altered expression of microRNA targets specific proteins that regulate 13 
carbohydrate metabolism .  In cell culture experiments , miR-451 has been shown to target  an upstream 14 
activator of AMPK , resulting in an inhibit ion of the AMPK  signaling cascade  (19).  Elevation in miR -451 15 
expression appears to be sensitive to glucose availability.  When glucose concentrations are low, miR -451 16 
expression is repressed, allowing fo r increased activation of AMPK (20).  Conversely, with high glucose 17 
concentrations miR -451 expression is increased, resulting in dimin ished AMPK  (20).  Similarly microRNA [ADDRESS_941062] ident ified miR - 19 
33a/b a nd miR -126 as inhibitors of IRS (21, 22) .  Ov er expression of these microRNA reduce IRS protein 20 
content, resulting in insulin r esistance and impaired glucose uptake (21, 22) .  Furtherm ore, in disease 21 
states that altered metabolic demands, such as diet -induced obesity and diabetes,  dysregulation of 22 
microRNA expression has been observed, with s pecific microRNA (miR -29a, miR -34a, miR -103, miR-107, 23 
and miR -375) predicted to inhibit signali ng proteins associated with  insulin signaling  upregulated  (13).  24 
Findings from cell culture experiments and disease models indicate that microRNA contribute to regulation 25 
of carbohydrate metabolism .   26 
 27 
Our group recent ly found that microRNA which are highly enriched in skeletal muscle (i.e., myomiR) are 28 
sens itive to differing exercise mode s with or without essential amino acid plus carbohydrate 29 
supplementation  (unpublished data) .  In this investigation we found that weig hted endurance -type exercise  [ADDRESS_941063] a 37 
functional role in mediating glucose uptake to replenish glycogen stores.   Corroborating our findings, 38 
previous investigations ha ve reported the microRNA acutely altered by [CONTACT_14759].  Following an acute bout 39 
of endurance exercise there is diminished expression of miR -23, while mRNA expression of PGC -1α and 40 
its downstream targets are upregulated (23, 24) .  When miR -23 is overexpressed in skeletal muscle there 41 
is a reduction in total  PGC -1α mRNA and protein content that results in reduced efficiency of mitochondrial 42 
function, an organelle crucial to cellular energy production (23).  Furthermore, endurance exercise also 43 
downregulates miR -494, another inhibitor of PGC -1α, allowing for increased gene expression of PGC -1α 44 
and mitochondrial transcription factor A (25).  While interventions have  been conducted examining the 45 
relationship of mi croRNA expression to energy sensing genes in re sponse to endurance exercise , no study 46 
has investigated the influence of altered glycogen  availability in response to dietary manipulation on 47 
microRNA expression .  Understanding how glycogen availability alters expression of microRNA will enable 48 
determination of their functional role in regulating carbohydrate metabolism to support energy availability to 49 
fuel physical performance.        50

 Circulating microRNA:  Beyond their regulatory function within tissue, microRNA have been reported to be 1 
stable and reproducible an alytes present in circulation (26).  From the cytoplasm, microRNA can be 2 
released into the circulation in membrane -derived vesicles (exosomes), complexed with proteins, 3 
lipoproteins (cholesterol), or apoptotic bodies (plasma membrane fragments) (27).  Once released from the 4 
cell, circulating microRNA can function in cell -to-cell communication, indicatin g an endocrine -like function 5 
(28).  Though the exact mechanism by [CONTACT_693774] [ADDRESS_941064] the underlying 7 
physiological  state of the tissue (29).  In disease states that negative impact skeletal muscle, multiple [ADDRESS_941065] shown alterations in circulating microRNA profiles are reflective the underlying 9 
physiological c ondition of skeletal muscle (30-32).  In healthy individuals, our preliminary findings indicate 10 
that circulating microRNA profiles can  be used as a predictive tool to determine anabolic signaling in 11 
response to acute resistance exercise in skeletal muscle (33).  Use of advanced statistical and [ADDRESS_941066]-exercise.  T hese findings were supported by [CONTACT_84188] (e.g., phosphorylation) status of mTORC1 14 
signaling in skeletal muscle following resistance exercise.  Western blotting results determined that an 15 
upregulation in upstream (p -AktSer473) and downstream (p -70S6K1Thr389) targets of mTORC1, were [ADDRESS_941067].  Though  these and other recent (34, 35)  findings suggest that circulating microRNA 18 
profiles are a ltered by [CONTACT_693775], little is known regarding the influence of substrate availability, 19 
particularly carbohydrate, on circulating microRNA expression.  As microRNA regulate metabolic pathways 20 
within skeletal muscle, alterations in circulating microRNA  expression profiles may be used as a marker for 21 
underlying molecular adaptions within tissue.  Though assessment of microRNA expression in skeletal 22 
muscle can yield valuable insight into their functional role in energy metabolism, this type of data collec tion 23 
requires invasive muscle biopsies, which is difficult to perform during military field operations.  Identification 24 
of circulating microRNA as non -invasive markers of carbohydrate metabolism in skeletal muscle has the 25 
capacity to signal nutritional rea diness of service members.   26 
 27 
B3.  MILITARY RELEVANCE     28 
 29 
Military personnel often engage in sustained physical activity while time to eat and availabili ty of food is 30 
limited (4, 36, 37) . Under such conditions, it is likely that skeletal muscle glycogen stores are depleted, 31 
reducing the service member’s ability to maintain an optimal level of physical performance. However, 32 
during ‘real -world’ military training operations there is limited knowledge regarding altered carbohydrate 33 
metabolism at the skeletal muscle level, as invasive investigations requiring muscle biopsies cannot be 34 
condu cted during training operations.   Identifying the mechanism, as well as determination of non -invasive 35 
markers of molecular pathways regulating carbohydrate metabolism is critical to move findings from 36 
controlled laboratory settings to field operations.  M odeling of circulating microRNA may allow for a more 37 
comprehensive understanding of nutrient adequacy during military operations, allowing for implementation 38 
of targeted nutrition interventions to optimize military performance.   Support for this protocol c omes from 39

Hypotheses  4 
 5 
1. Expression of microRNA in skeletal muscle will be influenced by [CONTACT_693776], and 6 
that these changes in skeletal muscle microRNA will be associated with modulation in circulat ing 7 
microRNA.  8

Date:  [ADDRESS_941078] ( Appendix A ) and a 3 -d activity log ( Appendix B ) 8 
according to instructions provided by [CONTACT_693777] (39).    The data will be analyzed using Food 9 
Processor SQLTM (Salem, OR Version 10.0) and the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) 10 
Compendium of Physical Activities, respectively.  Information for these forms will be collected to estimate 11 
volunteers total daily energy requirements.  To ensure all volunteers begin the protocol day with similar 12 
glycogen stores, following glycogen depletion 48 -hrs before testing, volunteers will be provided with food 13 
and beverages (except water) containing 6.0 g carbohydrate  ∙kg-1∙d-1 to replete glycogen  stores .  Meals will 14 
be derived from military combat  rations (MRE) and supplemental  food items.  Example of energy and 15 
macronutrient content will be consistent with ACSM dietary guidelines ( Table 1 ) (40).         16

On glycogen depletion protocol days, volunteers will receive standardized meals derived from MRE 18 
components and supplemental carbohydrate -based food items.  Meals will either pr ovide adequate 19 
carbohydrate (6.0 g ∙kg-1∙d-1) to replenish glycogen store s or provide low carbohydrate (1.5  g∙kg-1∙d-1) so 20 
glycogen stores remain below baseline concentrations ( Table 1 ).  Study dietitians will prepare and 21 
administer meals to volunteers.  In this cross -over study the order of carbohydrate intake amount will be 22 
randomized to avoid order bias.    23

Volunteers will be instructed to maintain their normal physical activity during the study.  However, 4 
volunteers will be required to refrain from any additional physical activity outside of the study (resistance 5 
and endurance exercise) [ADDRESS_941079] (≥ 8 13 
hr), using a calibrated digital scale to the nearest 0.1 kg at screening.  Body mass will be measured at 14 
baseline,  the morning of and the morning after glycogen depletion protocol days.  15 
 16 
Body composition will be determined using dual energy x -ray absorptiometry (DEXA, DPX -IQ, GE Lunar 17 
Corporation, Madison, WI).  The DEXA technique allows for the non -invasive assessment of soft tissue 18 
composition by [CONTACT_244601] a precision of 1 -3% (41). The volunteer will lay face -up on the DEXA 19 
densitometer table in shorts, t -shirts, and stocking feet.  Volunteers will be asked to remain motionless for 20 
the 8 -10 min scan. These data will be used to calculate total body mass, fat -free mass, and fat mass. 21 
Calibration to external standards will be performed before actual data collection. The operator remains in 22 
the room with the volunteer during the scan.  23 
 24 
Determination of Peak Oxygen Uptake  25 
Peak oxygen uptake (VO 2peak) will be determined by a cycle ergometer test using a computer -based 26 
metabolic system (True Max 2400, Parvomedics, Sandy, Utah , [LOCATION_003] ).  Volunteers will be instructed to fast 27 
overnight (≥ 8 hr) before testing.  Volunteers will be clothed in appropriate athletic attire and perform this [ADDRESS_941080] ambient indoor temperature (20 -22C) and humidity conditions (30 -80%).  [ADDRESS_941081].  Every minute, workload intensity will 32 
be progressively increase by 30W until the volunteer is fatigued or unable to maintain a pedaling rate th at 33 
either maintains or increases O 2 consumption.   Heart rate will be monitored using a heart -rate monitor 34 
(Polar Electro Inc, Oulu, Finland) the last [ADDRESS_941082] reports angina -like sym ptoms, exertional syncope, shows signs of poor perfusion 36 
(i.e., light -headedness, confusion, ataxia, pallor, cyanosis, nausea, or cold and clammy skin), or if testing 37 
equipment fails.   38 
 39 
Glycogen Depletion Protocol  40 
The glycogen depletion protocol will be completed on a cycle ergometer, with intensity based on results 41 
from VO 2peak assessment.  Volunteers will begin with a 5 -min warm -up at 70 watts  before beginning the 42 
glycogen depletion protocol.  After the warm -up period volunteers will complete 2 -min of h igh-intensity 43

 cycling (work period) at 90% VO 2peak, followed by 2 -min recovery period where volunteers will cycle at 50% 1 
VO 2peak.  This work -to-recovery ratio will be maintained until volunteers are no longer able to complete 2 - 2 
min of cycling at 90% VO 2pea k, determined as the inability to maintain a cycling cadence of 60 rpm for 15 - 3 
sec.  Cycling intensity will then be lowered to 80% VO 2peak.  When the volunteer is unable to complete 2 - 4 
min of cycling at 80% VO 2peak, cycling intensity will be lowered to 70% V O2peak.   Once the volunteer can no 5 
longer complete 2 -min of cycling at 70% VO 2peak, cycling intensity will be lowered to 60% VO 2peak.   The 6 
glycogen depletion protocol will be terminated once the volunteer is unable to complete 2 -min of cycling at 7 
60% VO 2peak.  For each drop in the intensity of the work period, the cycling intensity during the recovery 8 
period will be maintained at 50% VO 2peak for 2-min.  This exercise protocol will maximally deplete muscle 9 
glycogen stores (38).  Prior to the protocol day, volunteers will perform two practice sessions to en sure [ADDRESS_941083] reports any discomfort (i.e. angina -like symptoms or 16 
exertional syncope) or shows signs of poor perfusion, or if there is an equipment failure.   17 
 18 
Muscle Biopsy   19 
Percutaneous muscle biopsy will be performed to obtained skeletal muscle samples for assessment of 20 
muscle glycogen, microRNA expression and molecular pathways regulating carbohydrate metabolism.  21 
Muscle samples will be taken from the vastus lateralis using  a 5-mm Bergstrom needle with manual suction 22 
while the participant is under local anesthesia (1% lidocaine) according to the approved [LOCATION_003]RIEM SOP 23 
(42, 43) . Multiple passes with the biopsy needle may be necessary to obtain adequate sample with each [ADDRESS_941084] at this point.  Volunteers will return the following morning for a fourth muscle biopsy taken at a new 29 
incision site.  In this same incision a fifth biopsy will be taken after 80-min of steady state exercise to 30 
determine the influence of adequate or  low glycogen storage on exogenous carbohydrate uptake and 31 
oxidation during exercise.  Following a minimum 7 -d washout period, volunteers will return to the laboratory 32 
to complete the second arm of the investigation.  A total of ten muscle biopsies will be  conducted per 33 
volunteer.          34 
 35 
Assessment of Resting Respi[INVESTIGATOR_363282]  36 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_363282] (RQ) will be measured under resting conditions before the [ADDRESS_941085] calorimetry (Parvo Medic s).  Assessment of RQ will [ADDRESS_941086] in the 40 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_19636] a pproximately 30 -min prior to each measurement in a quiet and dim, temperature 41 
regulated room. To minimize error, volunteers will be instructed to minimize movement once the 42 
mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_693765], or the mask/hood is placed over their heads to collect expi [INVESTIGATOR_5103]. The test will be 43 
discontinued when 10 -min of steady state oxygen consumption (VO 2) and carbon dioxide production 44 
(VCO 2) are recorded.    45 
 46 
Steady -State Exercise  47 
After the fourth muscle biopsy volunteers will complete 80 -min of steady -state exercise  on the cycle 48 
ergometer at 60 ± 5% of their VO 2peak.  During exercise VO 2 and VCO 2 will be measured for 4 -min using a 49 
metabolic cart (Parvo Medics) at approximately 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 75 -min to determine substrate 50 
oxidation. HR (measu red continuously; Polar Electro ) will be recorded at the same times as the metabolic 51

Additionally, all participants will consume the CHO beverage at 1.8 g∙min-[ADDRESS_941090] of glycogen availability on exogenous carbohydrate oxidation efficiency.   Volunteers 15 
will consume the beverage immediately before the start of the exercise and then again at 20, 40, and 60 - 16 
min during th e exercise bout.  The CHO beverage  consumed during exercise  will be enriched with 200 mg 17 
of U-13C-glucose  and U -13C6-D-fructose  (Cambridge Isotope Laboratory, Andover, MA, [LOCATION_003]) to significantly [ADDRESS_941091] on 25

Exogenous glucose (g/min) = VCO 2 [(Rexp - Rref)/(Rexo - Rref)]/k  6 
 7 
where VCO 2 is in L/min, Rexp is the observed isotopic composition of expi[INVESTIGATOR_33559] 2, Rref is the isotopic [ADDRESS_941095] dose of 13C-glucose  and U-13C6-D-fructose , 9 
Rexo is the isotopic composition of the exogenous glucose ingested, and k (0.747 L /g) is the volume of [ADDRESS_941096] 40 min of steady -state 12 
exercise will allow for equilibration between the 13C/12C in expi[INVESTIGATOR_33559] 2 and the 13C/12C in CO 2 produced in 13 
tissues (45). Thus, endogenous glucose oxidation will only be calculated from samples obtained in the last 14 
40 m in of steady -state exercise (4 0 to 80 min).  15 
 16 
Muscle Glycogen  17 
Approximately 20 mg of muscle will be dehydrated in a freeze dryer.  Samples will then be ground to 18 
powder and visible connective tissue will be removed.  Powdered muscle will be placed in 500 µl 2 N H Cl.  19 
Samples will then be placed in an incubator for 120 min at 100 ˚C.  Following incubation samples will be 20 
neutralized with 1500 µl 0.67 N NaOH.  Muscle glycogen will be in solution at this point.  Glycogen will be 21 
quantified by a fluorometric assay (Sig ma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, [LOCATION_003]).      22 
 23 
Intramuscular Triglyceride Concentrations  24 
Intramuscular triglyceride concentrations will be determined using the Folch method (46). Dehydrate 25 
muscle will be homogenized in a 2:1 chloroform -to-methanol solvent. Following extraction, samples will be 26 
saponified in ethanolic KOH at 60 °C, and glycerol content will determined using a commercially available 27 
colorimetri c assay (Sigma)  28

mRNA and microRNA Expression  30 
Total RNA will be isolated from approximately 25 mg of muscle using a mirVanaTM miRNA isolation kit 31 
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, [LOCATION_003]).  Quantity and quality of RNA will be assessed using a Nanodrop ND - 32 
1000spectro photometer (Nanodrop, Wilmington, DE, [LOCATION_003]).  Equal amounts of total RNA will be 33 
synthesized into cDNA for analysis of mRNA (iScriptTM Advanced cDNA Synthesis Kit; Bio -Rad) and a 34 
TaqMan® microRNA RT kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, [LOCATION_003]).   Individua l primers will be used to 35 
determine the mRNA expression of known intracellular targets regulating muscle  metabolism, to include 36 
but not limited to PGC -1α, SIRT1, ACC, AMPK, PDK4, IRS1, and GLUT4 .    miRNA (20 -40 bp) will be size - 37 
selected from total RNA using Illumina’s protocol  (US Army Center for Environmental Health Research, 38 
Frederick, MD) . The sorted miRNA will be tagged and assayed using the Illumina NextSeq instrument. [ADDRESS_941097] sequencing libraries. Subseq uently, the samples will be 40 
amplified using index -tagged primers to facilitate multiplexing. The amplified cDNA constructs will be size - 41 
selected, quality controlled before loading to the NextSeq instrument to generate 50 base reads. Image 42 
analysis and base  calling will be performed using the Illumina pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189].  43

 Following identification of skeletal muscle microRNA  that had a significant change , Taqman® probes 1 
(Applied Biosystems) will be used to assess the expression of these microR NA in serum to determine their 2 
potential use as noninvasive markers of altered carbohydrate metabolism following glycogen depletion and 3 
repletion.  Total c irculating miRNA will be extracted from 200 µL serum using miRNeasy Serum/Plasma kit, 4 
which allows fo r extraction and purification of small (< 200 nt) cell -free RNA (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, [LOCATION_003]). [ADDRESS_941099] from 1000 µL serum  using miRCURYTM RNA Isolation Kit 6 
to measure miRNA. To avoid introduction of potentially contami nating material, prior to RNA extraction 7 
serum samples will be centrifuged for 10 min at 4°C to remove cellular debris.  Supernatant will be 8 
removed and transferred to a new tube without disturbing the pellet.  Due to the small amount of RNA in 9 
the serum, 3.5 µL of a Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] -In Control (C. elegans miR -39; Qiagen) will be added to all samples prior to 10 
extraction of RNA to determine the yield of template recovered.  After extraction 3 μl of serum RNA will 11 
reverse transcribed using the TaqMan® microRNA RT kit (A pplied Biosystems) with miRNA -specific stem - 12 
loop RT primers pooled in 1X -Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer for a final dilution of 0.05X.  A pre -amplification step 13 
will be performed after reverse transcription to increase cDNA template using a primer pool of 20 X 14 
Taqm an® Small RNA Assays (Applied Biosystems) for miRNA of interest at 0.05X concentration in 1X TE 15 
buffer.  All serum miRNA will be normalized to the geometric of external (Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] -In Control C. elegans miR - 16

All reverse transcription for  mRNA and miRNA, and pre -amplification of serum miRNA will be conducted in 21 
a T100TM Thermal Cycler (Bio -Rad, Hercules, CA). A StepOnePlusTM real-time PCR system (Applied 22

It is the policy of [LOCATION_003]MRMC that data sheets are to be completed on all volunteers participating in this 2 
research for entry into the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command Volunteer Registry 3 
Database.  The information to be entered into this confidential database includes name, address, social 4 
security number, study name, and dates.  The intent of the database is twofold: first, to readily answer 5 
questions concerning an individual’s participation in research sponsored b y the [LOCATION_003]MRMC; and second, to 6 
ensure that the [LOCATION_003]MRMC can exercise its obligation to ensure research volunteers are adequately 7 
warned (duty to warn) of risks and to provide new information as it becomes available.  The information will 8 
be stored at the [LOCATION_003] MRMC for a minimum of 75 years.  9

C2.  COMPENSATION FOR PARTICIPATION    11 
 12 
Military and civilian personnel will receive $35 for each successful blood draw.  There are 20 blood draws 13 
during the two glycogen depletion protocol days (10 per protocol day).  Volunteers completing all 20 draws will 14 
receive $700.  If a volunteer does no t complete the entire study, they will be compensated for the number of 15 
successful blood draws they did complete.  Volunteers will not be eligible for any other form of compensation 16 
during this study.    17 
 18 
C3.  WITHDRAWAL FROM RESEARCH PARTICIPATION    19 
 20 
Participants will be allowed to withdraw at any time without penalty or loss of benefits to which they would 21 
otherwise be entitled.  An investigator may stop an individual’s participation in the study if the participant is 22 
unwilling or unable to complete study  procedures.  An investigator or the medical monitor may also withdraw a 23 
participant if the individual becomes ill or injured or it would not be in the participant’s best interest to continue.   [ADDRESS_941110] the participant ’s privacy, any of their research -related records will be labeled or “coded” with an [ADDRESS_941111]. Lee M. 29 
Margolis will keep the link between participant number and the par ticipant ’s research records in a locked 30 
cabinet.  Any documents that will require the participant’s name, such as the consent form, will be kept in a 31 
locked cabinet separate from any research documents that contain the participant’s ID number.  The princip al 32 
investigator is the only person who will be able to match the research participant number with any of their 33 
personal identifying information.    34 
 35 
When the results of the research are published or discussed in conferences, no information will be included  36 
that would reveal the participants identity to others.  If photographs, videos, or audio -tape recordings of you will 37 
be used for educational purposes, your identity will be protected or disguised.  All identifiable or recognizable 38 
information (e.g., names  and faces) will be covered in any photographs unless volunteers agree to sign a [ADDRESS_941112] identification (ID) numbers that will not contain any personal [ADDRESS_941113] linking the volunteers’ names and ID numbers will be kept in a separate locked file in the principal 50

       C6.1 Risks of Harm    15 
 16 
Research Procedure Name:  [CONTACT_693780]  17 
Research Procedure Description:  Volunteer will lay face -up on the DEXA densitometer table in shorts, t - 18 
shirts, and stocking feet.  Volunteers will be asked to remain motionless for the 8 -10 min scan.  19 
Research -related Ri sks:  The DEXA scan is an X -ray and is considered to be a no greater than minimal 20 
risk procedure.  The radiation dose of the whole -body DEXA scan is 0.1 mrem.  This dose is equivalent to 21 
approximately 1/250 of normal annual background radiation, 1/9 of the  radiation received in a transatlantic 22 
flight, or 1/[ADDRESS_941115] X -ray.     23 
Measures to Minimize Risks of Harm: (Precautions, safeguards):  A quality assurance check will be 24 
completed on the DEXA each day prior to its use; the so ftware will not allow the use of the DEXA [ADDRESS_941116] the 26 
day before, or the day of testing.  If you are pregnant you will not be scanned, nor will you be able to  27 
continue the study.  28 
  29 
Research Procedure Name:  [CONTACT_693781]  30 
Research Procedure Description:  A 18-20 g x 1.25 inch needle will be used to guide a catheter into the 31 
antecubital vein of the volunteer.  The catheter will be attached to saline to keep the line patent for multiple 32 
blood draws.     33 
Research -related Risks:  The risks of blood sampling are small  and usually limited to local bruising or [ADDRESS_941117] this to continue blood sampling and t herefore the study. This will require another needle to be 39 
inserted into your arm.   40 
Measures to Minimize Risks of Harm: (Precautions, safeguards):  Trained technicians will use sterile [ADDRESS_941118] the catheter; however, in spi[INVESTIGATOR_693766] t here is a chance that the site may 42 
become infected.  Volunteers should not give blood for eight weeks before or after this study.   43

but this is more unsightly than risk producing.  Late complications might include thrombosis of the vein due 2 
to trauma or infection.  These complications are extremely rare.  3 
Measures to Minimize Risks of Harm: ( Precautions, safeguards):  Participant monitoring, aseptic [ADDRESS_941120] medical 5 
precautions reduce risk.  Trained technicians will perform all venipuncture.  6

Research Procedure  Name:   [CONTACT_559133]  8 
Research Procedure Description:   Roughly 8 -10 mL of Lidocaine will be injected using a 25 g needle at 9 
the site of the incision, superficially (i.e., skin) and within the vastus lateralis.  10 
Research -related Risks:   Slight pain at the site of injection might occur. Although rare, anaphylactic 11 
reactions may also occur following administration of lidocaine.  Unlikely, but possible side effects could 12 
include: dizziness, confusion, shakiness, visual changes, nausea, and u nusually slow heartbeat.   13 
Measures to Minimize Risks of Harm : (Precautions, safeguards) :  Volunteers will be instructed to Notify 14 
study coordinator or PI [INVESTIGATOR_693767] (i.e., swelling, itching, rash, hives, difficulty swallowing, or 15 
difficult y breathing) reaction occurs. In the case of severe reaction, lidocaine use will be discontinued.                 16 
 17 
        Research Procedure Name:  [CONTACT_693782]  18 
Research Procedure Description: A small incision will be made in the skin and fascia of the vastus 19 
lateralis.  A 5-mm Bergstrom biopsy needle will pass through these incisions with manual suction while the 20 
participant is under local anesthesia (1% lidocaine) to collect muscle samples.  21 
Research -related Risks:  Percutaneous needle muscle biopsies h ave been established as a non -routine, [ADDRESS_941121] sterile procedures and  carefully instructing volunteers on care of the 27 
wound.  Nerve damage is possible.  Moderate stiffness, hematoma and swelling around the biopsy site 28 
may occur following the procedure, but this usually resolves itself within several days.  Some minimal 29 
scarring will accompany healing of the incision and formation of a hypertrophic scar or keloid is possible.  30 
Although this is a rare event in fair -skinned persons, the incidence of hypertrophic scarring or keloid 31 
formation associated with healing of a primaril y closed skin biopsy site (i.e., one which was closed with [ADDRESS_941122]) is 5 -10% in dark -skinned persons.  Complications of bleeding can be [ADDRESS_941123] pressure to the wound following the biopsy.  If symptoms should occur, they 34 
usually do not interfere with normal walking or heavier exercise.  Volunteers with evidence of bleeding 35 
diatheses or with local skin infection or irritation, or recent anticoagulant medication (including aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]), will 36 
not be used.     37 
Measures to Min imize Risks of Harm: (Precautions, safeguards):  Volunteers will be instructed about [ADDRESS_941124] hematoma and infection.  They will be given a handout outlining instructions for 39 
proper care of the incision site ( Appendix I).  [CONTACT_244637] will perf orm the procedure with sterile [ADDRESS_941125] notes for each biopsy ( Appendix J ).  [ADDRESS_941126] -biopsy to monitor for any 42 
sign of infection, b leeding, or hematoma.  To minimize the likelihood of hypertrophic scarring or keloid 43 
formation, biopsy wounds will be closed as promptly as feasible.  44

Research Procedure Name:  [CONTACT_559134]  46 
Research Procedure Description:  All exercise testing in this investigation will occur on a cycle ergometer, 47 
cycling at various levels of intensity based on exercise protocol.  48 
Research -related Risks:  Exercise is generally considered safe and beneficial for individuals without 49 
cardiovascular disease. The U.S. prevale nce of fatal events is approximately 1:100,000 to 1:300,000 in 50 
competitive high school athletes and increases to 1:15,000 to 1:50,000 in athletes over the age of 35.  51

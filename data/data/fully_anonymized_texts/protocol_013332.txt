SPECIFIC AIMS AND  HYPOTHESES  
Aim 1: To evaluate the behavioral and psychological appeal of e-cigarettes among 40  
chronic  smokers with smoking -related  cancers.  
Hypothesis 1 (H1): Greater than 50% of study participants will report daily e -cigarette use  
at each assessment during the 9 weeks that e -cigs are provided, and mean satisfaction 
with e- cigarettes will be >4 on a 5 -point scale. In a parallel process growth model for e -
cigarette  and cigarette use, there will be a significant negative correlation of growth  slopes.  
Aim 2: To evaluate the effect of e -cigarettes on biological markers of combusted  tobacco  
toxicity.  
Hypothesis 2 (H2): After 9 weeks, mean expi[INVESTIGATOR_113179] 2 and urine NNAL will be  
reduced.  
 
Primary  outcomes:  
Appeal ( H1)—E-cigarette use and amount of e -cigarette product used per week, 
proportion  of participants that report e -cigarette use at each assessment, satisfaction 
scores for  e-cigarettes,  and whether they continue e -cigarette use at 12 weeks (3w after 
end of trial).  Correlation  between change in e -cigarette use and change in cigarette  use. 
5 D15154   V.08.18.17 
 
 
 Combustible Tobacco T oxicity ( H2)—Exhaled CO, urine NNAL and 1 -hydroxy napthaline  
(1- HOP). Because smokers are good at regulating nicotine intake, we expect no change 
in urine  cotinine over  time.  
 
STUDY  OVERVIEW  
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_618931] e-cigarettes as a substitute for  cigarettes  
among smokers with aerodigestive tract cancers or bladder cancer. Participants will 
receive  e- cigarettes for [ADDRESS_822763]. Primar y outcomes include e -cigarette appeal,  e-cigarette  
use/satisfaction  and combustible tobacco  toxicity.  
 
STUDY DESIGN  CONSIDERATIONS  
INTRODUCTION  
Smoking is responsible for $[ADDRESS_822764] important single modifiable risk factor because 
it remains a prevalent  behavior  (affecting about 20% of the population), because of its 
strong relation to many  disease  outcomes, and because of its lack of specificity: Smoking 
is linked with almost every  important  chronic  disease.  
 
SMOKING AS A CAUSE OF  CANCER  
Among all modifiable risk factors for cancer, cigarette smoking exerts the greatest single  
effect,  being responsible for about one -third of cancer dea ths.[ADDRESS_822765] locally, and are transmitted through the 
circulatory system to tissues remote from the  lung.  
For example, N -nitrosodimethylamine, and 4 -aminobiphenyl are liver metabolites 
implicated  in the association between smoking and cancer of the liver.4 Other metabolites, 
e.g. urinary  4- (methylnitrosamino) -1-(3-pyridyl) -1-butanol (NNAL), N′ -nitrosonornicotine 
(NNN), and  their glucuronide metabolites of the tobacco -specific nitrosamine (TSNA),  
nicotine -derived  nitrosamine ketone (NNK), are subsequently co ncentrated in the kidney, 
leading to high  organ  exposure in those tissues and the  bladder.  
Some constituents (or metabolites) of tobacco smoke bind to cellular receptors and  
6 D15154   V.08.18.17 
 
 
 activate  protein kinases and growth receptors, which can induce inflammation,7  resulting  
in enhanced pneumocyte proliferation, activation of nuclear factor -kappa B (NF -kB), and  
tumor  promotion.[ADDRESS_822766].11 More  recent  unpublished data show that 
introduction of e -cigarettes in smokers doe s not result in rises  in saliva cotinine, but is 
associated with changes in cigarette  consumption.12 
 
SMOKING AMONG CANCER  PATIENTS  
Given the prominent role smoking plays in carcinogenesis, it is not surprising that smoking  
is more common in cancer patients than in the general population. In a cohort of 5185  
recently diagnosed cancer patients at Roswell Park Cancer Center,1  62% of all patients 
had  some involvement with tobacco during their lives: current smokers (18%), recent 
quitters (10%),  or former smokers (35%). Cancers with the highest rates of current 

7 D15154   V.08.18.17 
 
 
 smoking included head &  neck  (29%), bladder (27%) and lung (24%).13 Another study 
summarized cross -sectional and  longitudinal studies of smoking after cancer diagnosis 
among lung and head & neck  cancer  patients, and found an overall rate of 33%.[ADDRESS_822767] ON  MORTALITY  
In the Roswell Park study investigators assessed smoking status for 5185 cancer  patients  
enrolled into treatment programs between 1982 and 1998.1  Survival curves like the one  in 
Figure 2 compared survival by [CONTACT_618943]/recent quitters.  
Not all the curves are as striking as this one, which shows overall survival for head & neck  
cancer,  but continued smoking was an important risk factor for many cancers and overall, 
with adjusted  hazard ratio for time to mortality being 1.29 (95% CI 1.17, 1.42) for current 
vs. former  smokers  and 1.18 (1.04, 1.33) for current vs. recent quitte rs after adjusting for 
grade and stage,  age, BMI, and several other risk factors. Given that many of the recent 
quitters would have  relapsed  (see below), the increased survival in recent quitters 
represents a possible harm  reduction influence  conferred  by [CONTACT_618944].  Furthermore, a  systemati c review of observational studies examining the 
influence of smoking cessation after diagnosis  of early stage lung cancer suggested that 
the mortality benefit seen with smoking cessation  was due more to reduced cancer 
progression rather than fewer cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_618932].[ADDRESS_822768] looked specifically at how smoking status relates to the probability  of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a second primary. A study of over 1484 patients with a primary non -small cell  
lung carcinoma (median follow -up 26 months) found that 66 developed a second  primary 
lung cancer  (SPLC).16 Among smokers the only variable associated with SPLC 
development was  smoking  pack -years (entered as a continuous variable), with hazard 
ratios indicating an 8% increase  in risk for SPLC development for each additional [ADDRESS_822769] of developi[INVESTIGATOR_618933] -smokers 
with former smokers <20 cigarettes per  day, former smoker > 20 cigarettes per day, 
current smoker < 20 cigarettes per day, and  curren t smoker ≥ [ADDRESS_822770] ratios  for second cancer development for lung, 
bladder, kidney, and head/neck  cancers.   Compared  to never smokers, higher levels  of 
former and current smoking showed substantially  greate r hazard of second primary 
cancers in all categories, with current smokers having higher  risk compared to former 
smokers.  Note the finding of a dose -response among smokers,  showing  consistently 
higher hazard ratios for those who smoked ≥ [ADDRESS_822771] that approximately 30 -40% of 
smokers attempt  to quit at or around the time of their cancer diagnosis. A recent  
publication  from a large,  well-funded cessation service at Sloan -Kettering18  offering 
intensive  cessation  support, found that of over 4500 tobacco us er referrals, 3430 (75%) 
were unreachable  or refused cessation assistance. Of the over 1000 enrolled in the 
service, about 25% did  not complete the protocol, 25% either died or were lost to follow -

 up, and 43% reported no  tobacco  use at [ADDRESS_822772] that these state -of-the art programs 
benefit only about 10% of smokers with  cancer.   This is, again, consistent with the findings 
above that suggest these individuals are  heavily addicted and relatively refractory to 
cessation treatment, leaving about [ADDRESS_822773] seen a  
rapid  rise unparalleled by [CONTACT_618945] -combustible nicotine delivery system.19  The main  
components of the e -cigarette include a battery, a cartridge with nicotine dissolved in  
propylene  glycol or vegetable glycerol, and a heater that aerosolizes the nicotine —
propylene  glycol  solution. When the user puffs on the end of the device and creates a 
vacuum, the  battery  powers the heater and creates aerosol, which is drawn into the mouth 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_618934]  (Figure  3). E -cigarettes come in many styles and are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_92311]. 
This was true for first gen  e-cigs. Later models have a button to push on the battery, which 
creates a bolus of vapor ready  for immediate inhal ation when the e -cig reaches the  mouth.

THEORETICAL CASE FOR E -CIGARETTE HARM REDUCTION IN SMOKERS  
WITH  CANCER  
TOXICOLOGY  
E-cigarettes are not currently regulated, and the Food and Drug Administration has 
required  no information from manufacturers on their ability to deliver nicotine and potential  
toxicity.  
However, compared to cigarettes, they should deliver comparatively fe wer toxic chemicals  
to the lung; available evidence strongly suggests this is true.  Compared to tobacco  
smoke,  studies have found e -cigarette smoke to be substantially lower in toxic content, 
cytotoxicity,  and adverse side effects.20   One laboratory study comparing the toxicity 
profile of  e-cigarette  aerosols and tobacco smoke found that known tobacco toxins in e -
cigarette aerosols were  100 to 1000 times lower than those found in tobacco smoke.21 
Another FDA study found  that carcinogenic to bacco specific nitrosamines in e -cigarette 
vapor was 8.2 ng/g, similar to the  level in nicotine patch users (8.0 ng/g) and much less 
than the level in Marlboro cigarette  smoke  (6260ng/g).[ADDRESS_822774] on complete  
blood  count indices,24 nor did it cause significant reduction in lung function (3% reduction  
FEV1/FVC)  compared to cigarette smoke (7% reduction FEV1/FVC),25 and that e -
cigarette use had  no negative effects on myocardial function.26 Based on these and other 
studies, Public  Health  England has published a public statement that e -cigarettes  are 95% 
safer than  smoking.[ADDRESS_822775] 
consumption  of combustible tobacco and whether their use affects intermediate medical 
outcomes. That is  the overarching purpose of the prese nt research.  
 
NICOTINE  DELIVERY  
Much of the nicotine from cigarettes is delivered to the brain by [CONTACT_618946].33 This is one of the reasons for high abuse liability  for 
cigarettes. Nicotine delivered from the oropharynx (e.g., when smokeless or nicotine gum  
is used) enters the venous blood and passes through the liver before going to the brain. 
This not only delays its delivery to the brain, but it lowers the dose because some of the 
nicotine  is changed to cotinine in the liver. For e -cigarette aerosols, about half the nicotine 
absorbed  is delivered through the alveoli, with the other half being delivered to the venous  
circulation  through absorption from the oropharynx and bronchial tree.[ADDRESS_822776] plasma nicotine concentrations equivalent to 
cigarettes (blue line in Figure 4  below).  
Nicotine absorption from new generation devices (produced after 2010, red line in Figure 
4) are able to equivalent levels of plasma nicotine, but only after [ADDRESS_822777] William Dunn, who stated, 
“The smoking act has  many  dimensions. The motor aspects, drawing the smoke into the 
mouth, inhaling the smoke into  the lungs … taste and olfactory sensations are elicited, 
sensations are elicited when the smoke  is drawn down into the lungs, psychosocial 
symbolism is imparted to the person, and a  large  number of chemical compounds pass 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_618935].”[ADDRESS_822778] of the behavioral components of the e -cigarette  are apparent in a  study  of e-
cigarette use and cigarette craving.3   As illustrated in Figure 5  below,  e-cigarette use was 
associated with substantial reductions in cigarette craving, and  these  immediate 
reductions were independent of whether the device contained  nicotine.

E-CIGARETTE REGULATION: IMPLICATIONS ON STUDY  DESIGN  
As detailed below, the specific aims of this project are to determine the appeal and  
toxicity  of e-cigarettes in current smokers with a smoking -related cancer. This is NOT a  
smoking  cessation study ; instead, it examines changes in intake for two tobacco products  
when  administered together. There is a regulatory basis for the decision to focus on 
appeal  and toxicity, and not smoking cessation. When e -cigarette devices first attempted 
to enter the  US market, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) blocked shipments on 
the basis that  e-cigarettes were unapproved drug delivery devices and must first pass 
through FDA’s New  Drug  Application process before they could be legally sold. E -
cigarette manufacturers sued,  arguing  that e -cigarettes contained nicotine derived from 
tobacco and were therefore a tobacco  product;  the US Court of Appeals (Washington DC) 
ruled in their favor; and  the FDA decided not to  seek  further review. The FDA then 
determined that they would “deem” e -cigarettes to be  covered  under the Family Smoking 
Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (deeming is in process at  this date). In the meantime, 
the FDA has determined  that any evaluation of the e -cigarette  product  for a therapeutic 
endpoint (such as treating nicotine addiction) requires an Investigational  New Drug 
Application (involving animal pharmacology and toxicity studies, manufacturing  information 
on the product,  etc.).   This regulation does not allow scientists not closely affiliated with an  
 
Figure 5. Craving to smoke a cigarette as a function of time and whether the 
smoker was inhaling a cigarette or an electronic nicotine delivery device (ENDD) 
with and without nicotine or a nicotine inhaler (one form of nicotine replacement 
therapy). Taken from Bullen, et al. [ADDRESS_822779] made it clear in US courts that they do not seek approval as  a 
drug delivery  device.  
The Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) at FDA is charged with regulating the  tobacco  
market under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, which charges the  
FDA,  among other things, “to promote cessation to reduce disease risk and the social  
costs  associated with tobacco -related diseases.”  CTP funds investigators to help the  
agency  compare tobacco products with respect to three issues of interest —their relative 
appeal,  toxicity,  and effect on health. This le aves scientists the option of studying the e -
cigarette as a  modified  risk tobacco product in smokers with respect to those three types 
of outcomes.  The  ultimate  goal is to reduce the harm caused by [CONTACT_618947], nicotine.  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_618936] a short -term study of 
e-cigarette appeal and toxicity among  cancer  patients that  smoke.  
 
TRIAL  PROTOCOL  
STUDY  DESIGN  
We will enroll [ADDRESS_822780] cancers  or bladder cancer who 
are current daily  smokers  will be identified two ways:  
1) Clinic Recruitment  - Potential participants will be identified by [CONTACT_618948]. Patients will be advised to quit smoking as per the 
standard  of care. Any patient wishing to quit smoking will be referred for smoking 
cessation  counselling  through the DHMC  program,  the White River Junction VAMC 
program , or their state help -line. Once eligibility is  confirmed  and informed consent 
is obtained and signed, patients will be enrolled in the  study.  
2) EMR Recruitment : In a recruitment strategy that parallels clinic recruitmen t, we will 
use the EMR to identify all potentially eligible smokers (with the diagnosis of 
aerodigestive tract cancers  or bladder cancer) that have been seen in the NCCC in 
the past [ADDRESS_822781] a brief , generic message.   
The call  will assess their smoking status, and their willingness to quit.  Nonsmokers 
are not eligible.  If they smoke and are interested in quitting, they will be referred to 
their state quit line.  If they are not interested in quitting at this time, they will b e 
15 D15154   V.08.18.17 
 
 
 offered participation in the study, and we will confirm eligibility.   The mailing will 
include:  A letter from their oncology group at NCCC, the brochure for their state 
quit line, a handout about the study, and a paper to return to us in a postage -paid 
envelope.  If they return the paper to us requesting a referral to the quit line we will 
notify the D -H smoking cessation specialist.  He/She will then process the referral to 
the quit line in EDH.  The patient will then be contact[CONTACT_618949] l ine.  We 
will also provide them with their state smoking cessation help -line numbers .  If they 
return the paper to us indicating they do not wish to quit and would like more 
information regarding the study, a coordinator  will contact [CONTACT_476].  
Once enrolled, p articipants will receive the e -cigarette product described below, will be 
instructed on use  of the e -cigarette, and given a supply that is approximately equivalent to 
their current  nicotine  intake.  They will be told that e-cigarettes are theoretically safer than 
cigarettes, and that  this trial aims to test how appealing the product is for smokers not 
willing to quit consuming  nicotine.  
We have opted to use e -cigarette products produced by [CONTACT_618950], a US manufacturing  
company  that emphasizes the purity of its products and its approach to quality control in 
the manu facturing process. Patients will be given Halo Triton, which uses a leak -proof 
refillable  tank system that has had a recent technological update.  The patient will be 
shown how to fill  the tank and will be observed filling it.  Those not able to manage the 
tank refill will be given  Halo  G6 leak proof prefilled cartomizers (the part of the e -cigarette 
that contains the nicotine  solution  and the heating filament); these can be substituted for 
the tank on the Triton battery.  The starter kit that will be distributed to patients is 
illustrated in Figure  6. 
HALO manufactures its e -cigarette and the nicotine solutions in the [LOCATION_002].  The 
HALO solution e -cigarettes contain 0, 12, 18, 24, or 36 mg/ml nicotine. We have been  
advised  to begin our participants with 18mg/ml and move up or down based on patient 
preference.  E-cigarette liquid also comes in many flavors, and we have decided to allo w 
participants to  choose  from four options.  Halo has agreed to provide us with the names of 
their [ADDRESS_822782] 
the activity of these CYP450 /UGT enzymes significantly. Additionally, cyclical  cytotoxic  
chemotherapy is not given every day throughout a cycle. The most well  characterized  
carcinogens of smoking so far are NNK (4 -(methylnitrosamino)1(3 -pyridyl) -1-butanone)  
and NNAL (4 -(methylnitrosamino)1(3 -pyridyl) -1-butanol). These carcinogens are also  
metabolized  by [CONTACT_618951]2A6, 
UGT2B 10, UGT1A4  and CYP2A13, so these should not be affected by [CONTACT_618952].  
Coordinators will assess eligibility, collect specimens, administer CO 2 measurements  and 
administer the surveys during the basel ine and follow up  visits.

RECRUITMENT  
Potentially eligible patients will be identified by [CONTACT_30223] -researcher collaborators and  
through  clinical trials nurses or clinical research coordinators, who monitor the cancer 
patient  population  for recruitment into clinical studies. Patients may be identified in 
multiple clinical  settings,  including outpatient clinics and the infusion suite. Once a 
potentially eligible patient is  identified,  a referral will be made to the site coordinator, who 
will meet with the patient,  confirm  eligibility , and obtain consent for the patient to 
participate in the study , and register the patient in the Velos e -Research database . (If a 
site coordinator is unab le to utilize Velos, that coordinator will submit participant data to 
another coordinator with access and it will be entered into the Velos e -Research 
database.)  The coordinator  will conduct baseline web assessments, provide e -cigarettes 
and instruction o n how to use  the product, and conduct all follow up  assessments.

 STUDY  TIMELINE  AND FOLLOW -UP 
The trial is designed to allow for patient visits  every 3 weeks for 12 weeks. The  
coordinator s will work with the participant and the participants’  medical  care teams to 
schedule and conduct the visits. We will contact [CONTACT_618953] -up at [ADDRESS_822783] 9 weeks of the trial and $20 
for each visit ($100  total).  Participants that travel more than [ADDRESS_822784] for a study -

effects from  e-cigarettes  and nicotine products. The coordinator s will conduct and audio -
record a 10 -15 minute  qualitative interview at 9 weeks soliciting perceptions about e -
cigarettes to be transcribed  and analyzed for common themes that could be useful in 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_618937].  
Behavioral assessments: We will use a Timeline Follow -Back Questionnaire (TLFB)38,39  
to document use of c igarettes at baseline and cigarettes/e -cigarettes at baseline, 3, 6, 9, 
and 12 weeks. At follow up visits participants will be instructed to bring in all used and 
unused  e- cigarettes, in order to verify reports of e -cigarette use. We will evaluate appeal 
with attitudinal  ratings, on a 5 -point Likert -type scale, e -cigarette ease of use, satisfaction, 
and enjoyment,  and willingness to continue to purchase e -cigarettes in the future. All 
questionnaires are  being  programmed using a secure web -based system set up and 
maintained by [CONTACT_618954].  
Biomarkers of behavior: Cigarette smoking will also be measured with exhaled carbon  
dioxide.  We will assess expi[INVESTIGATOR_113179] 2 using Micro Smokerlyzer meters (Bedfont 
Scientific),  which  have already been purchased for a previous study. The protocol will 
follow  operating  instructions that come with the devices, and the devices will be calibrated 
weekly with  40PPM  CO 2/air mixture. E -cigarette smoking will be measured with  urine 
propylene glycol, the  main  constituent of e -cigarette aerosol. Some 40% of ingested 
19 D15154   V.08.18.17 
 
 
  
n propylene glycol is  excreted  unchanged in the  urine.  
The NCCC Clinical Pharmacology Shared Resource (CPSR) will conduct assays of urine  
for smoke -related carcinogens. Urine samples (at least 20 mL) will be collected at the 
study  defined  time points from study participants in standard urine containers. These will 
be delivered to  the NCCC CPSR, divided into 5 mL aliquots and stored at -20°C or b elow 
until analysis.  Urine  aliquots will be assayed in batches based on the published assays 
for urine nicotine, cotinine,  4- (methylnitrosamino) -1-(-3pyridyl) -1butanol (NNAL)40 and 1 -
hydroxy naphthalene  (1-HOP)41 concentrations. These assays can and will be 
established and validated in the NCCC  CPSR  using the LC -MS/MS and HPLC -
Fluorescence services available in the  CPSR.  
 
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND POWER  CONSIDERATIONS  
Qualitative Analysis  
A follow up interview will be conducted at week 9. The interview will  be transcribed and a 
thematic analysis will be conducted to evaluate common issues  encountered  by [CONTACT_618955] e -cigarettes. Thematic analysis consists  of examination of 
text by [CONTACT_125476][INVESTIGATOR_618938], follow ed by [CONTACT_56544], classifying,  and developi[INVESTIGATOR_618939]. Transcripts are uploaded into a qualitative analytic software  program  and 
analyzed using Atlas.ti, a qualitative coding program. Co -investigator Sarah Pratt  has 
experience using similar qualitative meth ods to interview health professionals. She  will 
supervise the coders, staff at the Centers for Health and Aging at Dartmouth who have  
been  trained to perform similar analyses in other  studies.  
Substitution assessment: The proportion of participants who report use of e -cigarettes  
during  each follow -up visit during treatment will also be computed (along with a 95%  
confidence  interval).   This proportion is expected to be at least  0.5.  With 40 participants, 
width of a  95% confidence interva l around this proportion will be at most 0.32. The 
satisfaction with  e- cigarettes (averaged across 3 treatment assessments) will be 
summarized among  participants  using descriptive statistics and the amount of e -cigarette 
product returned at each  follow -up period will be summarized across the treatment  period.  
To explicitly test the substitution/replacement mechanism of e -cigarettes, we will perform  
an exploratory parallel process growth model fit within a structural equation modeling  
framework .42 In this model the trajectory over time of both frequency/quantity of cigarette 
use and frequency/quantity of e -cigarette use will be modeled assuming individual -level 
latent  intercept  and slope (i.e., latent growth curve model). A significant negative 
association between the  latent  slope of e -cigarettes and the latent slope of combustible 
cigarettes would be consistent with  the replacement/substitution hypothesis. The model 
provides an explicit statistical test of  the hypothesis that, as e -cigarette usage increases, 
combustible cigarette usage decreases.  Power  for this analysis is computed as that for an 
individual -level correlation coefficient assuming  [ADDRESS_822787] 80% 
power to detect a correlation that is at least -0.4 between  these two  individual -level slopes. 
Figure  7 shows a diagram  of the parallel  process  growth  model.

Toxicity  Assessment:  Our measures  of toxicity, urine  NNAL,  1-HOP and CO [ADDRESS_822788] deviation  of change in  this measure of  3.8 pmol/mg creatinine  (as 
was seen in Joseph  et al. 2008), with  [ADDRESS_822789] 80% power at the 
two-sided 0.[ADDRESS_822790] a change from baseline  of 1.7 pmol/mg 
creatinine.  There is not enough information available on [ADDRESS_822791] 80% power at the two-sided 0.[ADDRESS_822792]  
of increased cotinine (resultant from increased e -cigarette usage without similar decrease  
in combustible cigarettes). To do this, we will compute the number of participants with an  
increase  in cotinine over the course of the study and consider this an adverse event. With 
[ADDRESS_822793] 1 
participant with an  increase  in cotinine given different true percentage of participants with 
this adverse event. For example,  if the population -wide true p ercentage of participants 
with cotinine increase is 0.5%, then  the probability of observing at least [ADDRESS_822794] 1  adverse  
event (increase in  cotinine)  
0.5%  0.18 
1% 0.33 
2% 0.55 
5% 0.87 
10% 0.99 
 
 
ON-SITE  MONITORING  
Clinical research monitoring for regulatory compliance and data integrity will be  conducted  
according to the NCI -approved NCCC Data and Safety Monitoring Plan. Internal 
monitoring  is conducted by [CONTACT_618956] -Hitchcock Medical Center Clinical Trials Office (CTO) and the 
White River  Junction  VA Medical Center who are not involved in the study. This 
monitoring will include  periodic  assessment of the regulatory compliance, data quality, and 
study integrity. Study records will  be reviewed and directly compared to source documents 
and the conduct of the study will  be discussed  with the investigator. Monitors may request 
access to all regulatory  documents,  source documents, CRFs, and other study 
documentation for on -site inspection. Direct  access  to these documents is guaranteed by 
[CONTACT_093], who must provide support at a ll times  for these  activities.  
Participation as an investigator in this study implies acceptance of potential inspection  by 
[CONTACT_618957]. The investigator will permit study protocol related audits and 
inspections  by [CONTACT_233783], government regulatory bodies, and the Dartmouth 
compliance and  quality  assurance groups of all study related documents (e.g., source 
documents,  regulatory  documen ts, data collection instruments, study data.). The 
investigator will ensure the  capability  for inspections of applicable study -related facilities 
(e.g., diagnostic  laboratory).  
 
RECORD  RETENTION  
Following closure of the study, the investigator will maintain all site study records in a safe  
and secure location. The records are maintained to allow easy and timely retrieval when  
needed  (e.g., audit or inspection) and, whenever feasible, to allow any subsequent review 
of data  in conjunction with assessme nt of the facility, supporting systems, and staff. Upon 
completion  of study analysis, research information is stored in a password protected, 
secure research  server  behind the firewall at the WRJ VA indefinitely or at Dartmouth 
College Records  Management  off-site storage located at [ADDRESS_822795] -protected database (or equivalent)  indefinitely.

 SAFETY AND DATA  MONITORING  
This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_65063] 
(DSMAC)  of the Norris Cotton Cancer Center. The Committee meets quarterly to review 
accrual rates  and information for stu dies that have accrued participants. The Clinical 
Cancer Review  Committee  (CCRC) determines the frequency of DSMAC review.  The 
DSMAC has the authority  to suspend or to recommend termination to the CCRC of all 
research activities that fall within  its jurisdiction. In the event that a study is suspended or 
terminated, that information will  be forwarded to the CPHS (Dartmouth IRB)  office.

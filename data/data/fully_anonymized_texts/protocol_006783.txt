Date of registration:  February 22, [ADDRESS_241694] (IRB # 170834 ; San Diego, [LOCATION_004]).  Written, informed consent was obtained from all 
subjects participating in the trial.   
 
Enrollment was offered to all adults who met study criteria undergoing painful unilateral 
ambulatory foot and/or ankle surgery with a p lanned popliteal -sciatic perineural catheter for 
postoperative analgesia at a single institution.  Exclusion criteria included : 
1. Clinically -apparent neuropathy in the surgical extremity  
2. Chronic high -dose opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (defined as daily use for more than [ADDRESS_241695] the equivalent of 20 mg oxycodone);  
3. History of opi[INVESTIGATOR_9724]  
4. Surgery outside of ipsilateral sciatic and saphenous nerve distributions (e.g., iliac crest 
bone graft)  
5. Patients with nerves deeper than [ADDRESS_241696] ASA monitors, oxygen by [CONTACT_95186], and 
positioning the patient prone, intravenous midazolam and fentanyl were titrated for patient 
comfort  while  ensuring patients remained responsive to verbal cues.  A 13 to 6 MHz 38 -mm 
linear array ultrasound transducer ( Edge II ; SonoSite, Bothell, WA) was used to visualize the 
sciatic  nerve [ADDRESS_241697] in opaque, sealed envelopes to one of two treatments groups (1:1 ratio) in blocks of 4 : 
1. Through -the-needle [“Traditional” group]  
2. Suture -catheter [“Suture” group]   
The catheter site was sterilely prepped, draped, and the needle entry site anesthetized with 
lidocaine 1% (3 mL).  
 
Through -the-needle insertion : A 17 -guage  Tuohy needle (FlexTip Plus; Teleflex Medical, 
Research Triangle Park, NC)  was inserted  on the poste rior aspect of the leg, from lateral to 
medial,  using an in -plane, short -axis ultrasound -guided technique. Normal saline (5 -10 mL) was 
used to hydrodissect around the sciatic nerve to facilitate catheter insertion . A [ADDRESS_241698] location of the 
tip was confirmed by [CONTACT_202603] (1 -2 mL) with visualization of spread adjacent to 
the nerve.  The catheter was then secured with clear, occlusive dressings.  To facilitate tourniquet 
placement in the operating room, the catheter was taped up the lateral thigh and secured on the 
lower abdomen.  
 
Suture -catheter insertion :  A short -beveled 19 -guage  suture needle  (75 mm radius, 160 mm 
length)  joined to a 19 -guage,  single -orifice,  nylon catheter (Certa Catheter, Ferrosan Medical 
Devices, Szczecin, Poland) was inserted  on the posterior aspect of the leg, from lateral to medial,  
under ultrasound guidance using an in -plane technique. Normal saline (5 -10 mL) injected 
through the hollow -bore needle was used to hydrodissect below and then above  the sciatic nerve 
to facilitate spread of local anesthetic  following catheter insertion. The suture needle was then 
advanced under ultrasound guidance to an exit point approximately  6-8 cm medial to the entry 
site. After anesthetizing the skin at the exit point with lidocaine 1% (1 -2 mL), the needle was 
advanced through the skin and then removed. The catheter was subsequently advanced under 
ultrasound visualization utilizing the echo genic markings  to place the orifice directly adjacent to 
the sciatic nerve . Proper position of the catheter was confirmed by [CONTACT_202603] (1 -2 
mL) though the catheter and visualizing spread adjacent to the nerve. The excess catheter was 
then cut, leaving a tail approximately [ADDRESS_241699] -operative exam was anticipated , 20 mL 2% 
lidocaine with 5 -10 µg/mL epi[INVESTIGATOR_202597] . This was done  under ultrasound visualization  to confirm that the injection produced 
circumferential spread of the LA around the sciatic nerve . Successful block was defined as a 
decrease in temperature discrimination t o ice after 30 minutes in the tibial nerve distribution . For 
cases in which the surgeon desired a postoperative exam prior to local anesthetic administration, 
a bolus with the same lidocaine -epi[INVESTIGATOR_202598]/concentration was performed in the post -
anesth esia care unit.  
 
If the planned surgical procedure was anticipated to produce pain in the saphenous nerve 
distribution , a single -injection saphenous nerve block was performed with 20 mL 0.5% 
ropi[INVESTIGATOR_72160] 5-10 µg/mL epi[INVESTIGATOR_202599] a 17-guage  Tuohy needle under 
direct ultrasound visualization.  
 
Intra -operative Procedures : Surgical anesthesia was provided  with either pre -operative 
administration of local anesthesia as part of  the nerve block combined with p ropofol sedation, or 
general ane sthesia consisting of inhaled volatile anesthetic with or without nitrous oxide in 
oxygen  with opi[INVESTIGATOR_202600], as needed .  
 
Post-operative Procedures : Subjects received a 3 -day perineural infusion via electronic pump 
(ambIT PreSet, Summit Medical Produc ts Inc, Salt Lake City, UT) of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.2% (basal 
6 mL/hour; 4 mL demand bolus; 30 -minute lockout) initiated in the recovery room along with a 
prescription for oxycodone [ADDRESS_241700] until the catheter was completely removed, thus 
ensuring that the small tail at the exit site was pulled through the skin prior to sterile dressing 
removal to avoid contamination of the catheter track.  
 
Outcome Measures:  The first four items of the Brief Pain Inventory were collected daily: worst, 
average, least, and current surgical pain measured us ing the Numeric Rating Scale (provided 
verbally to the investigator with specificity to the 0.1 unit).  The primary outcome measure  was 
“average ” pain score on the first 2 postoperative  days.  Additional outcomes included daily 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], sleep disturbances  due to pain (binary) , opi[INVESTIGATOR_202601] (e.g. 
perioral numbness) side effects  (binary) , local anesthetic leakage  (binary) , complete  catheter 
dislodgement  (binary) , degree of sensory block  (measured on a 0 -10 scale with 0: no  deficits and 
10: completely insensate) , satisfaction with postoperative analgesia (0: very dissatisfied, 10: 
completely satisfied), and the volume of local anesthetic consumed . 
 
Statistical methods :  We assessed the balance of randomized groups on baselin e and procedural 
characteristics using absolute standardized difference, defined as the absolute difference in 
means, mean ranks, or proportions divided by [CONTACT_103884]. Baseline variables 
with Absolute Standardized Difference  > 0.46 (i.e. , 1.96 ×√(1/n1 +1/n2 ) )  were considered 
imbalanced and were  adjusted for in all analyses, as appropriate .[ADDRESS_241701] at the 0.025 significance 
level.  We used an a priori noninferiority delta of 1.25 for each pain score outcome and a ratio of 
means of 1.2 for the cumulative log -transformed opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556].  Noninferiority was 
claimed if the upper 95% confidence lim it for the treatment effect (estimated from analyses 
described below) was less than the specified noninferiority delta. P -values were obtained from a 
1-tailed t -test using a test statistic defined as , where (β) is the estimated 
treatment effect,   is the estimated standard error of the treatment effect, and δ is the 
noninferiority delta. If noninferiority was found, superiority would be tested in the same 
direction.  
 
We assessed the effect of suture -method to the through -the-needle perineural catheter  on each of 
[ADDRESS_241702] correlation structure adjusted for a v ariable ’s 
imbalances at baseline  (age was the only imbalanced variable). The heterogeneity of the 
estimated treatment effect over time was assessed via the treatment -by-time interaction at a 

significance criterion of P < 0.15. A significant interaction suggest ed that the treatment effect  
varies over time, in which case we estimate d the treatment effect individually for each of 2 time 
points at the 0.0125 significance level using Bonferroni correction (0.025/2).  Treatment effect 
estimates from these regression models were used to assess n oninferiority of the suture versus 
through -the-needle methods, as described in the preceding paragraph.  
 
For cumulative opi[INVESTIGATOR_155286] [ADDRESS_241703] of the suture method versus the through -the-needle method on log -transformed 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_202602].  If a patient did not receive 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (amount = 0), 0.[ADDRESS_241704] of complete  
catheter dislodgment as a secondary outcome f or testing noninferiority.  However, we observed 
no event in the suture method group. Therefore, we simply compared the groups using Fisher’s 
exact test.  We also compared the randomized groups on binary outcomes using chi -square or 
Fisher’s exact test, as  appropriate.  
 
Sample size and power  estimation:  The study was designed to have 90% power at the 0.[ADDRESS_241705] noninferiority of the suture method to the through -the-needle 
perineural catheter on mean “average” pain score on the firs t 2 days following foot/ankle 
surgery.  Assuming a noninferiority delta of 1.[ADDRESS_241706] deviation of 2.2, and a true 
difference of 0.5 points in the pain score favoring the suture method, a total sample size of 70 
patients (35 per group) w as required .  SAS statistical software (Carey, NC) was used for all 
analyses.

 Amendment 1  
Amendment rationale  
This protocol amendment is issued for the following reasons: 
1. To allow dose escalation of secukinumab administered sc every 4 weeks from 150 mg 
to 300 mg beginning at the Week 52 visit . 
Phase 3 studies in subjects with active PsA (CAIN457F2306 and CAIN457F2312) demonstrated the superior efficacy of secukinumab 150 mg sc (both studies) and 300 mg sc (300mg arm in CAIN457F2312 only) regimens over placebo. Secukinumab 150 mg sc and 300 mg sc regimens had a rapid onset of response and similar magnitude of efficacy across several endpoints.  
While secukinumab 150 mg sc and 300 mg sc regimens are both more efficacious than placebo 
regardless of TNFα -inhibitor (TNF -IR) status, the [ADDRESS_304156] 
efficacy across multiple PsA domains including ACR20, ACR50, ACR70, HAQ -DI, PASI 75, 
PASI 90, SF-36 PCS, and presence of dactylitis and enthesitis in TNF- IR patients.  
Evidence of dose response was shown in TNF -IR patients favoring secukinumab 300 mg sc 
over 150 mg sc at the Week 24 efficacy endpoint used for the primary and secondary efficacy analyses of CAIN457F2312.  Indeed, ACR20/50/70 response rates at Week 24 in TNF -IR 
patients were higher with secukinumab 300 mg sc compared to 150 mg sc (45.5% vs 29.7%, 27.3% vs 18.9%% and 15.2% vs 10.8% respectively). This trend was maintained up to week 52. 
Furthermore, secukinumab [ADDRESS_304157] to clear/almost 
clear skin (PASI 90, IGA mod 2011 0/1) in subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis (defined as ≥ 10% BSA). There was a clear dose response favoring secukinumab 300 mg sc in the higher thresholds of skin c learance. The difference between 300 mg sc and 150 mg sc regimens was 
more pronounced in the more difficult -to-achieve PASI 90 and IGA mod 2011 0/1 endpoints, 
with 21.9% and 27.4% more patients with ≥ 10% BSA compared to 8.2% and 3.3% more patients with < 10 % BSA reaching PASI 90 and IGA mod 2011 0/1 responses, respectively, at 
Week 24. Therefore, secukinumab 300 mg sc afforded greater improvement in plaque psoriasis than 150 mg sc, particularly in the achievement of clear/almost clear skin, in subjects wi th 
moderate to severe psoriasis (≥ 10% BSA). 
Thus, given the results outlined above, and in order to maintain a high proportion of clinically 
meaningful response without compromising the important Week 24 and Week  52 radiographic 
data integrity, the 150mg sc dose should be escalated to 300 mg sc every 4 weeks for subjects whose signs and symptoms are not well controlled, and may improve further with an increase 
in dose as judged by [CONTACT_250324] 52.  As treatment assignment will remain 
blinded until after the database is locked for the planned Week 52 interim analysis, for many 
subjects, both the decision to escalate and dose escalation will be performed in a blinded manner.  
2. Moving all clinical (primary  and secondary) endpoints from W eek 24 to Week  16 
except x -ray endpoint (mTSS)  
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_304158] the true placebo control portion of the study without need for extrapolation 
for week 16 non- responders, primary and secondary endpoints are changed from Week 24 to 
Week 16 except for x -ray end point (mTSS). Up to week 16, all patients will stay in the 
randomized study treatment regimen without switch or rescue. Therefore the comparison between treatment groups at week 16 is not affected by "rescue penalty".     
3. Reordering the secondary endpoint hierarchy  
An important purpose for this study is to investigate the x-ray data. Therefore the endpoint for x-ray data (mTSS) is moved up to the first family together with the primary endpoint ACR20. With the consideration of the importance of other efficacy endpoints for this protocol, the hierarchy of those endpoints is adjusted from more important to less important for this study in the secondary family.  
4. Adding additional X -ray at Week 24 for patients who are non- responders at Week  16 
In order to assess secukinumab’s treatment effect on inhibiting the progression of joint/bone structural damage, comparison of the change from baseline at Week 24 in the modified sharp scores (mTSS) between active and placebo is required. To minimize a subject’s duration on ineffective treatment, clinically non -responding patients (<20% reduction in their baseline 
active joint count) at Week [ADDRESS_304159] X -rays obtained at 
Week16 before their blinded treatment is changed. This allows for a comparison between placebo and secukinumab, but requires extrapolation of this data to Week 24 based on the change in mTSS observed between baseline and Week 16. This extrapolation requires a strong assumption that the subjects’ score would have continued to change at exactly the same linear rate as observed from baseline to week 16. Based on prior PsA studies CAIN457F2306 and CAIN457F2312, approximately 66% of placebo and 33% of secukinumab subjects in the current study are expected to be a non -responder at Week [ADDRESS_304160]. To address these concerns and to strengthen the extrapolation method, a Week 24 X -Ray is being  added for this subset of subjects. This will lessen the number of patients 
without observed data at Week 24 and substantially improve the understanding of the 
relationship of radiographic evidence of structural disease progression over time, especially between the Week 16 and Week 24 time frame. This additional information will be applied to 
the important supportive sensitivity analyses, some of which are predictive models built on relationships of radiographic structural changes over time. These added fil ms will substantially 
increase the accuracy and justifiability of statistical analyses including both the primary and sensitivity analyses.    
 
5. Update analysis for Joint/bone structural damage at Week 24 to account for the 
additional Week 24 X- ray for Week  16 non- responders  
The primary analysis for total modified Sharp score is updated to include available X- ray 
assessments at Week 24 for secukinumab treated subjects who meet early escape criteria at Week 16. This is based on the following: 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 16  
Clinical Trial Protocol v02 Clean   Protocol No. CAIN457F2342 
 
 • The main purpose of this analysis is to compare treatment group difference at Week 
24 (change from baseline). Therefore, if data at Week 24 from the active treatment 
group is available, it should be used in the analysis.  
• For placebo non- responders at Week  16 (i.e. rescued patients), the data at Week 24 are 
not reflective of their original randomized treatment due to the placebo non-responders 
having switched to secukinumab at Week 16.  Thus, the “de- facto” ITT analysis that 
could be proposed in this setting would be difficult to interpret. This approach for the 
handling of the placebo non-responders as missing is consistent with what has been 
done for other continuous endpoints using an MMRM analysis. An analysis using the observed data at Week 24 for all early escaped subjects (including placebo subjects who switch to secukinumab at Week 16) is planned to be amongst other sensitivity analyses using valid missing data imputation methods.  
6. Add a required wash- out period for Apremilast  
At the time the protocol was written, Apremilast (Otezla ®) was not approved for treatment of 
PsA and a washout period prior to randomization was not included in the protocol. 
Consequently, a minimum four -week washout period for subjects who received Apremilast 
before randomization is added.   
None of the changes made are due to evidence- based safety concerns.  
At the time this amendment becomes effective, approximately 60% of the patients are estimated 
to have been randomized.  
7. Introduce update [COMPANY_001] standard language for SAEs r eporting  
New [COMPANY_001] standard language for SAEs reporting is available and therefore introduced.  
Changes to the protocol  
Changes to specific sections of the protocol are shown in the track changes version using strike 
through red font for deletions and red underlined for insertions. 
Additionally, this protocol amendment includes the correction of typographical errors, 
formatting errors and editorial changes to increase clarity and consistency of the text. Consequently changes were incorporated directly in  the protocol with track changes, even if not 
listed specifically in this section.  
A copy of this amended protocol will be sent to the Institutional Review Board (IRBs)/ Independent Ethics Committee (IECs) and Health Authorities.  
The changes described in t his amended protocol require IRB/IEC approval prior to 
implementation.  
The changes herein affect the Informed Consent. Sites are required to update and submit for approval a revised Informed Consent that takes into account the changes described in this protocol amendment.

Psoriatic Arthritis  
Sponsor and Clinical 
Phase  [COMPANY_001]  
Phase III  
Investigation type  Drug; Biologic  
Study type  Interventional  
Purpose and rationale  The purpose of this study is to demonstrate efficacy including effect on inhibition of progression of structural damage, safety and tolerability up to 
2 years with primary focus at Week 16 clinically and Week 24 
radiographically, to support the use of secukinumab pre- filled syringe 
(PFS) by [CONTACT_6567] (s.c.) self -administration with or without loading 
regimen in subjects with active Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) despi[INVESTIGATOR_250306], DMARD therapy and/or previous anti -TNFα therapy. 
Long term efficacy up to 2 years will be based on signs and symptoms of 
joint/bone structure preservation (X -
ray) and improvement in physical 
function measured by [CONTACT_191315] – Disability 
Index  (HAQ -DI©), as well as skin and nail improvement for psor iasis signs.  
Primary Objective(s)  To demonstrate that the efficacy of secukinumab 150 mg s.c. (with or 
without loading regimen) or 300 mg s.c. with loading regimen, at Week 16 is superior to placebo based on proportion of subjects achieving American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR20) response in subjects with active 
PsA.  
Secondary Objectives  
  To evaluate:  
1. The change from baseline at Week 24 with secukinumab 150 mg (with or without loading regimen), or 300 mg (with loading regimen) compared with placebo for 
joint/bone structural damage (using 
van der Heijde modified total Sharp score (mTSS)). 
2. The efficacy of  secukinumab 150 mg (with or without loading 
regimen), or 300 mg (with loading regimen) at Week 16 compared with placebo based on the proportion of subjects achieving Psoriatic 
Area and Severity Index 75 (PASI75)  response.  
3. The efficacy of secukinumab 150 m g (with or without loading 
regimen), or 300 mg (with loading regimen) at Week 16 compared 
with placebo based on the proportion of subjects achieving Psoriatic 
Area and Severity Index 90 (PASI90)  response.  
4. The efficacy of secukinumab 150 mg (with or without  loading 
regimen), or 300 mg (with loading regimen), at Week 16 compared 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 18  
Clinical Trial Protocol v02 Clean   Protocol No. CAIN457F2342 
 
 with placebo based on the proportion of subjects achieving an ACR50  
response.  
5. The improvement on secukinumab 150 mg (with or without loading 
regimen), or 300 mg (with loading regimen), at Week 16 compared 
with placebo for the disease activity assessed by [CONTACT_250325] -DI© relative to baseline.  
6. The improvement on secukinumab 150 mg (with or without loading regimen), or 300 mg (with loading regimen) at Week 16 compared 
with placebo for the disease activity assessed by [CONTACT_250326] 28 joints C -Reactive Protein (DAS28-
CRP)  (utilizing high sensitivity CRP (hsCRP)) relative to baseline.  
7. The efficacy of secukinumab pooled regimen (150 mg with or without 
loading regimen, and 300 mg with loading regimen) at Week [ADDRESS_304161] enthesitis at BSL.  
8. The efficacy of secukinumab pooled regimen (150 mg with or without 
loading regimen, and 300 mg with loading regimen) at Week [ADDRESS_304162] dactylitis at BSL.  
9. Overall safety and tolerability of secukinumab.  
Study design  This multicenter study uses a randomized, double- blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel -group design. A screening period (SCR) running up to 
[ADDRESS_304163] eligibility followed by 104 weeks of treatment.  
At BSL approximately 990 subjects whose eligibility is confirmed will be randomized to one of four treatment groups in 2:2:2:3 ratio:  
• Group 1 - secukinumab 150 mg s.c. without loading regimen 
• Group 2 - secukinumab 150 mg s.c. with loading dose regimen 
• Group 3 - secukinumab 300 mg s.c. with loading dose regimen 
• Group 4 - Placebo s.c.  
At randomization, subjects will be stratified on the basis  of previous anti -
TNF therapy as TNFα inhibitor naïve (TNF -naïve) or TNFα inhibitor 
inadequate responders (TNF -IR). 
At each study treatment visit, one (for secukinumab 150 mg) or two (for 
secukinumab 300 mg) s.c. injections in the form of PFS will be 
administered, since secukinumab is available in 1.0 mL (150 mg) PFSs. 
Placebo to secukinumab is also available in 1.[ADDRESS_304164] been randomized to secukinumab groups 
at BSL (Groups 1- 3) will be classified as eith er responders (≥20% 
improvement from BSL in both tender joint count (TJC) and swollen joint counts (SJC)) or non- responders (<20% improvement from BSL TJC or 
SJC), however they will continue on the same treatment irrespective of their response status.

 1 Introduction  
1.1 Background 
Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an immune -mediated chronic inflammatory disease belonging to the 
spectrum of conditions commonly referred to as spondyloarthritidies (SpA). While the various SpA may be diverse in their clinical presentations, common environmental as well as genetic factors associated with susceptibility to SpA are suspected ( Turkiewicz and Moreland 2007 ). 
This latter notion was recently corroborated by [CONTACT_144936] a large -scale single nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP) scan study, where IL -23R variants that were previously linked to Crohn`s 
disease and psoriasis (diseases that may both co -exist with spondylarthritides) conferred risk to 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_250308] (AS)  (Barrett et al 2008 ). Together, a common pathway 
including the IL-23/IL-17 axis may play a role in seronegative SpAs including PsA. 
Psoriatic arthritis is a frequent chronic immune -mediated disease encompassing a spectrum of 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_250309] ( Moll and Wright 1973).  About 10- 40% of patients with psoriasis 
suffer from PsA. It is not only more common but also more severe than previously thought (Gladman 2004, Taylor et al 2006). PsA is associated with significant morbidity and disability, 
and thus constitutes a major socioeconomic burden. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_250310] -
rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are used for PsA including methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine, cyclosporine, and leflunomide, however, these are often inadequate because they only partially control established disease ( Mease 2008 ). 
Several lines of evidence support the notion of prominent T cell involvement in the pathogenesis of PsA. Memor y CD4+ and CD8+ cells are present in skin lesions as well as the inflamed 
synovium that express activation markers and have characteristics of oligoclonal expansion. (Curran et al 2004; Tassiulas et al 1999 ) Clinical trials demonstrated efficacy of T cell targeted 
therapy in PsA (cyclosporine A, CTLA4 Ig, alefacept). TNF blocking therapy was successfully introduced to the treatment of patients with PsA ( Mease et al 2000 ). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_120502], an 
unmet clinical need exists for patients with PsA for better disease control and long term prevention of structural damage beyond mere abrogation of inflammatory processes.  
IL-17 antagonism represents a novel therapeutic approach aimed at interference with the 
chronic inflammatory process by [CONTACT_250330] T17 cell subset. Additional effects of anti -IL-17 on bone homoeostasis 
via RANK L and IL -1, upstream of TNFα, can be inferred from animal studies ( Koenders et al 
2005). Assuming a potential role of IL -17 cells in the inflammatory infiltrate in PsA, it can be 
speculated that locally disturbed homeostasis of osteoclastogenic and osteoblastogenic mechanisms characteristic of PsA might be affected by [CONTACT_8668] -17 blockade, thus, potentially 
providing a therapeutic advancement to prevent structural damage in PsA. 
Secukinumab (AIN457) is a high- affinity full y human monoclonal anti -human antibody that 
neutralizes IL -17A activity. IL-17A is the key cytokine in the newly discovered Th17 pathway 
which is thought to be an important mediator of autoimmunity. Neutralization of IL -17A has 
strong pre -clinical and clin ical target validation and documentation of efficacy in a proof -of-
concept study conducted in patients with PsA (CAIN457A2206) suggesting a clinically 
meaningful response for signs and symptoms up to Week 16. The efficacy of secukinumab in PsA patients is further supported by [CONTACT_250331] (i.e. ACR20/50, 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 23  
Clinical Trial Protocol v02 Clean   Protocol No. CAIN457F2342 
 
 PASI75/90), resolution of dactilytis, enthesitis and inhibition of radiologic damage at Week 24 
obtained in a phase III study (CAIN457F2306; N=606) employing an intravenous (i.v.)  loading 
regimen (3x10 mg/kg) of secukinumab Q2W followed by [CONTACT_37234] s.c. 75 mg or 150 mg administered Q4W. In another phase III study (CAIN457F2312; N=397) secukinumab also demonstrated positive efficacy results superior to placebo in patients with PsA through most components of the arthritic and skin measures of signs and symptoms and physical function in a population comprised of 65% naïve to TNF -α inhibitors and 35% patients who were 
inadequate responders to a TNF -α inhibitor. Therefore, treatment w ith secukinumab may also 
reduce loss of cartilage and erosion of bone in PsA and may result in improvement of symptoms and functional joint manifestations in afflicted patients.  
As of 12-Jul- 2014, approximately [ADDRESS_304170] received secukinumab across various indications (RA, AS, PsA, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, uveitis, Crohn’s disease, dry eye, polymyalgia rheumatica) at doses ranging from single and multiple doses of 0.1 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg i.v. and 25 mg to 300 mg s.c. Full safety results from all PsA, AS and psoriasis completed studies show that secukinumab generally is safe and well tolerated. Please refer to 
the Investigator Brochure (IB) for a more detailed review of the pre -clinical and clinical 
information on secukinumab. 
So far only one study (CAIN457F2306) has assessed the effect of secukinumab on progression 
of joint/bone structural changes. Further, this study (CAIN457F2306) did not include secukinumab [ADDRESS_304171] of loading dose vs. no load. This study is planned to confirm the utility (efficacy/safet y) of secukinumab 150 mg s.c. and 
300 mg s.c. dose regimens administered for 24 weeks including the efficacy in preventing the progression of active PsA (joint/bone structural changes), as assessed by [CONTACT_250332].

 3 Investigational plan 
3.1 Study design 
This multicenter stud y uses a randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, parallel -group 
design. A screening period (SCR) running up to [ADDRESS_304176] eligibility followed by 104 weeks of treatment.  
At Baseline (BSL), approximately 990 subjects whose eligibility is confirmed will be randomized to one of four treatment groups in 2:2:2:3 ratio (The unbalanced ratio is adopted to improve the efficiency in the statistical test of the structural endpoint because the placebo population has higher variation. Overall ratio between active treatment and placebo is 2:1): 
• Group 1 - secukinumab 150 mg s.c. without loading regimen: 
secukinumab 150 mg (1.0 mL PFS of 150 mg dose) and placebo (1.0 mL PFS) 
administered at BSL, placebo (2 x 1.0 mL PFS) administered on Weeks 1, 2 and 3, 

[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 26  
Clinical Trial Protocol v02 Clean   Protocol No. CAIN457F2342 
 
 followed by [CONTACT_37234] 150 mg (1.0 mL PFS of 150 mg dose) and placebo (1.0 mL PFS) dosing every four weeks starting at Week 4.  
• Group 2 - secukinumab 150 mg s.c. with loading dose regimen: 
secukinumab 150 mg (1.0 mL PFS of 150 mg dose) and placebo (1.0 mL PFS) 
administered at BSL, Weeks 1, 2 and 3, followed by [CONTACT_250335] 4.  
• Group 3 - secukinumab 300 mg s.c. with loading dose regimen: 
secukinumab 300 mg (2 x 1.0 mL PFS of 150 mg dose) administered at BSL, Weeks 1, 2 
and 3, followed by [CONTACT_250335] 4. 
• Group 4 - placebo s.c.: 
Placebo (2 x 1.0 mL PFS) administered at BSL, Weeks 1, [ADDRESS_304177] will receive at Week 16/24 (described in detail in Section 5.2) 
At randomization , subjects will be stratified on the basis of previous anti-TNF therapy as 
TNFα inhibitor naïve (TNF-naïve) or TNFα inhibitor inadequate responders (TNF- IR). The 
enrollment targets will be to have 70% for TNFα inhibitor naïve and 30% for TNF- IR 
(approximately 154:154:154:231 subjects are TNFα inhibitor naïve i n each treatment groups) 
to ensure a representative subject population for the assessment of efficacy and safety. 
Subjects in Group 4 (Placebo) will be randomized (1:1) at BSL to two different treatment 
sequences:  
• Placebo s.c. till Week 16/24 followed by [CONTACT_37234] 150 mg s.c. every 4 weeks starting at Week 16/24. 
• Placebo s.c. till Week 16/24 followed by [CONTACT_37234] 300 mg s.c. every 4 weeks starting at Week 16/24. 
At each study treatment visit, one (for secukinumab 150 mg) or two (for secukinumab 300 mg)  
s.c. injections in the form of PFS will be administered, since secukinumab is available in 1.0 mL (150 mg) PFSs. Placebo to secukinumab is also available in 1.0 mL to match the active drug (see Section 5).  
At Week [ADDRESS_304178] been randomized to secukinumab groups at BSL (Groups 1- 3) 
will be classified as either responders (≥20% improvement from BSL in both tender joint count (TJC) and swollen joint counts (SJC)) or non- responders (<20% improvement from BSL TJ C 
or SJC), however they will continue on the same treatment irrespective of their response status. 
At Week [ADDRESS_304179] been randomized to placebo  at BSL (Group 4) will be classified 
as either responders (≥20% improvement from BSL in both TJC and SJC) or  non-responders 
(<20% improvement from BSL in TJC or SJC):  
• Subjects who are non- responders  will receive either secukinumab 150 mg or 300 mg s.c. 
every 4 weeks starting at Week 16 (as dictated by [CONTACT_250327] ). 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 27  
Clinical Trial Protocol v02 Clean   Protocol No. CAIN457F2342 
 
 • Subjects who are responders  will continue to receive placebo every 4 weeks. Starting at 
Week 24, these subjects will receive either secukinumab 150 mg s.c. or 300 mg s.c. every 
4 weeks (as dictated by [CONTACT_250328] ). 
At Week 24, the assessments will be performed as described in Table 6 -1. As described above, 
subjects who are still receiving placebo s.c. injection will receive either secukinumab 150 mg s.c. or 300 mg s.c. every 4 weeks starting at Week 24 (as dictated by [CONTACT_250336]) . 
Beginning at Week 52,  for subjects whose signs and symptoms are not well controlled, and 
who the investigator believes may improve further with an increase in dose, may have the secukinumab dose increased to [ADDRESS_304180] been completed, site personnel and 
subjects will be unblinded to the original randomized treatment (sequence) assignment at randomization. In addition, treatment will be given open- label in order to eliminate the placebo 
injection (i.e., only 150 mg or 300 mg secukinumab will be dispensed as 1 or 2 PFS, respectively). The subject will continue to receive the same active dose of secukinumab as open-
label treatment, administered until Week 100. Subjects will no longer receive the placebo PFS, 
which was admin istered to maintain blinding.  
Rescue medication will not be allowed before the completion of Week 24 assessments ( Section 
5.5.6). Although no subject will be restricted from receiving necessary rescue medications for lack of benefit or worsening of disease, if rescue with prohibited biologics (as described in Section 5.5.8) occurs prior to completion of Week [ADDRESS_304181], treatment groups in this proposed trial may be amended (via a protocol amendment) based on eventual agency recommendations for product usage in this indication.

 Figure 3-1 Study design 
 
3.2 Rationale of study design 
The double -blind, randomized, parallel -group placebo controlled design used in this study up 
to Week 24 is in alignment with phase III trials of other biologics in t his disease area and in 
compliance with the European Medicines (Evaluation) Agency (EMA/EMEA) guidelines (EMA 2006). Treatment duration in the placebo group is kept to a minimum. Placebo non-
responders will start re ceiving active treatment at Week 16 and the placebo responders will start 
receiving active treatment at Week 24 to enable similar duration efficacy comparisons to other secukinumab PsA trials. Treatment data up to 2 years is being generated to demonstrate long-
term efficacy and to support the safety data in this population. 
3.3 Rationale of dose/regimen, route of administration and duration 
of treatment 
The dosing regimens in this study rely upon dose -efficacy relationships observed in a proof of 
concept (PoC) trial (CAIN457A2206) and two phase III trials (CAIN457F2306, CAIN457F2312) in PsA, as described below. The PoC trial in PsA (CAIN457A2206) suggested that after two i.v. secukinumab doses of 10 mg/kg given 3 weeks apart, secukinumab demonstrated high efficacy, achieving an ACR 20 response at Week 6 in 62% of the TNF -naïve 

[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 29  
Clinical Trial Protocol v02 Clean   Protocol No. CAIN457F2342 
 
 subjects on secukinumab vs. 20% on placebo, and was well -tolerated ( McInnes  et al 2013). The 
ongoing trials in PsA, CAIN457F2306 assessed the efficacy of both 75 mg and 150 mg s.c. 
maintenance doses (every 4 weeks) after loading regimens consisting of 3 i.v. doses of 10 mg/kg given at BSL, Weeks 2 and 4, and CAIN457F2312 assessed the efficacy of 75 mg, 150 mg and 300 mg s.c. maintenance doses (every 4 weeks) after loading regimens consisting of s.c. doses 
of 75 mg, 150 mg or 300 mg given at BSL, Weeks 1, 2, and 3. Given the similarity of the ACR 20 response seen at the Week 24 primary endpoint for the 150 mg dose in each of these studies, regardless of  whether the loading dosing was i.v. (CAIN457F2306: 50.0% for 150 mg vs 17.3% 
for placebo) or s.c. (CAIN457F2312: 51.0% for 150 mg vs 15.3% for placebo), 150 mg is a sufficient dose to provide clinically and statistically significant efficacy, whereas high er loading 
doses of secukinumab do not appear to confer a greater response on the primary endpoint of ACR 20 at Week 24. In Study CAIN457F2312, PASI75 and PASI90 response was assessed in 
the subgroup of patients who had ≥ 3% skin involvement with psoriasis at BSL. For both 
PASI75 and PASI90 response rates, the difference to placebo at Week 24 was statistically significant for the secukinumab 150 mg and 300 mg doses (PASI75: 48.3%, p = 0.0006 and 63.4%, p < 0.0001; PASI90: 32.8%, p = 0.0029 and 48.8%, p = 0.0002, respectively). The percentage of responders increased as secukinumab dose increased, with the secukinumab 300 mg dose demonstrating a meaningful improvement over the secukinumab 150 mg dose (treatment differences between secukinumab 300 mg and 150 mg  for PASI75 and PASI90 were 
15.1% and 16%, respectively). Of note, the 75 mg s.c. loading/s.c. maintenance regimen tested in CAIN457F2312 achieved a statistically significant but clinically lower effect size in ACR 20 response of 29.3% and did not achieve statistically significant improvements in any of the 
efficacy endpoints tested in a pre -defined testing hierarchy, including PASI75, PASI90 DAS28 
CRP, SF36 PCS, HAQ- DI
©, ACR 50, dactylitis and enthesitis. 
The effect of secukinumab on progression of bone/joint structural changes was studied at 75  mg 
and 150 mg maintenance doses in earlier study (CAIN457F2306). A graphical analysis of the changes in PsA mTSS over 52 weeks compared to the exposure shows a likelihood of radiographic progression in patients with  low exposure (<15 mcg/mL) of 27% vs. an 18% 
radiographic progression in exposure of > 15 mcg/mL. This analysis demonstrates that a 
maintenance dose of 150 mg provides adequate exposure that result in long term inhibition of structural damage assessed by r adiography as illustrated by [CONTACT_250337] (Cmin) at the bottom of Figure 3 -2.

However, progression of bone/joint structural changes was not studied in study 
CAIN457A2312 and hence there is no previous study evaluating 300 mg s.c. dose on progression of bone/joint structural changes. Based on the exposure response analysis from CAIN457F2306 described above, this study will also assess if [ADDRESS_304182] better efficacy than 150 mg dose regimen. 
This study is evaluating the secukinumab 150 mg s.c. dose with or without loading regimen and 
300 mg s.c. dose with loading regimen for the treatment of adults with active PsA. The current 
trial is a phase III trial to assess the superiority of secukinumab 150 mg s.c. with or without loading regimen or 300 mg s.c. with loading regimen vs. placebo in patients with active PsA. 
This study employs active secukinumab treatment groups with: 
• No load regimen of doses of 150 mg s.c. administered every 4 weeks 
• Loading regimen at 150 mg s.c. administered at BSL, Weeks 1, 2 and 3, followed by a 
maintenance regimen of 150 mg s.c. every 4 weeks starting at Week 4.  

[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 31  
Clinical Trial Protocol v02 Clean   Protocol No. CAIN457F2342 
 
 • Loading regimen at [ADDRESS_304183] on the inhibition of structural damage. The approach for the no- load 
regimen has also been employed in this study to investigate the onset and sustainability of efficacy of secukinumab 150 mg s.c. administered every 4 weeks in patients with PsA. 
Assessment of joint and/or bone structure preservation is planned to be assessed using X -ray 
modality.  
In summary, the maintenance regimens in this study aims at ensuring: a) optimal efficacy in PsA signs and symptoms, b) optimal efficacy in the treatment of skin disease in patients with concomitant psoriasis and c) optimal efficacy in inhibiting the progression of structural damage.  
Formulation to be used 
This study will use secukinumab liquid in PFSs. Secukinumab at 150 mg administered in PFSs 
has been substantiated in study CAIN457A2308 in the indication of plaque -type psoriasis and 
in study CAIN457F2312 in the indication of PsA. This study (CAIN457F2342) is the third study to tes t secukinumab in PFSs in the indication of PsA. 
3.4 Rationale for choice of comparator 
A placebo group is included in this study up to the Week 24. Due to the nature of the disease and the primary outcome measure used (ACR20 response), a placebo group is neces sary to 
obtain reliable efficacy measurements for comparison between the active treatment groups and placebo in a controlled fashion.  It is necessary  to maintain placebo up to Week [ADDRESS_304184] on radiographic evidence of structural inhibition at Week 24 . The 
continuation of the placebo group up to Week 24 can be supported from an ethical standpoint. Firstly, treatment duration of the placebo group is kept to a minimum and the patients in placebo group will start receiving a ctive treatment at the end of Week 16 or Week 24 ( either 
secukinumab 150 mg s.c. or 300 mg s.c.) depending upon whether they are non- responders or 
responders, respectively at Week 16. Secondly, the regular assessments of disease activity ensures that subje cts experiencing worsening of their disease in any of the treatment groups can 
exit the study upon their own wish or based on the advice of the investigator at any time. In addition, the inclusion of a placebo group is in accordance with health authority g uidelines, 
including ( FDA 1999/ EMA 2006), and the parallel -group, placebo controlled design is in 
alignment with phase III trials of other biologics in this therapeutic domain as outlined in EMA guidelines ( EMA 2006).

 3.5 Purpose and timing of interim analyses/design adaptations 
The primary endpoint analysis will be performed after all subjects have completed the visit associated with the key secondary radiographic endpoint (Week 24). Although the unblinding 
of the [COMPANY_001] Clinical Team will occur after the Week 24 database lock, secukinumab regimen 
and original randomization to active treatment vs. placebo will continue to remain blinded to all investigators, site personnel, subjects, and monitors until the Week 52 database lock and analyses are completed.  
Subseque nt to the primary endpoint analysis, interim analyses are planned for regulatory 
submission and/or publication purposes after subjects have completed the Week [ADDRESS_304185] completed the study (Week F112). Additional analyses may be performed to support interactions with health authorities, as neces sary.  
3.6 Risks and benefits 
Secukinumab has shown either preliminary or confirmed efficacy in several inflammatory 
diseases. The safety profile of secukinumab is primarily based on the aggregate safety data from 
10 large completed phase II/III psoriasis trial s. The evaluation of safety data from completed 
PsA trials did not show additional safety concerns. 
Secukinumab was generally safe and well -tolerated. The most frequently reported adverse 
events (AE) are infections, especially upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_250311]. There was an increase in mucosal or cutaneous candidiasis with secukinumab 
compared to placebo, but the cases were generally mild or moderate in severity, non-serious, and responsive to standard treatment. 
There was a small  increase in mild neutropenia cases with secukinumab compared to placebo. 
Common Toxicity Criteria  (CTC) AE grade 3 neutropenia (<1.0-0.5x10
9/L) was uncommonly 
observed with secukinumab, most were transient and reversible without a temporal relationship 
to serious infections.  
Hypersensitivity reactions include urticarial and rare event of anaphylactic reaction to secukinumab were also observed in clinical studies.  
Taking into account the individual risks as outlined above, the expected risk profile of 
secukinumab from a mechanism of action perspective is anticipated to be similar or improved compared to the approved inflammatory cytokine -targeting therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The risk to subjects in 
this trial will be minimized by [CONTACT_178438], close clinical monitoring and extensive guidance to the investigators, provided in the current version of the IB. 
From the standpoint of the overall risk- benefit assessment, current trial with secukinumab is 
justified.  
[ADDRESS_304186]. Mis -randomized subjects will not be re -
screened.  
This is an international study and it is expected that approximately 990 subjects will be 
randomized. 
A screening failure rate of 20% and post -randomization dropout rate of 25% is anticipated in 
the first year. E nrollment will stop as soon as the target number and proportions of randomized 
subjects in the respective treatment group is reached.

5 Treatment  
5.1 Protocol requested treatment  
5.1.1  Investigational treatment  
[COMPANY_001] will supply the following: 
• Investigational treatmen t 
Secukinumab 150 mg provided in 1 ml PFS 
• Reference treatment  
Secukinumab placebo provided in a 1 ml PFS. 
Subjects will be instructed by [CONTACT_144955] -administer the s.c. injection using the 
PFS, based on the Instructions for Use (IFU). The investigational drug will be administered by 
[CONTACT_250341]. 
All injections through Week [ADDRESS_304199] to se lf-administer the study treatment at home when they are not visiting the site for 
any other trial related procedures.  
The PFSs are packed in a double blinded fashion and do not need to be prepared. The study treatments will be labeled as follows: 
• Double blind secukinumab and placebo PFS will be labeled AIN457 150 mg/1 ml/Placebo 
for dosing till Week 52. 
• Open label secukinumab PFS will be labeled AIN457 150mg/1ml. 
For detailed instructions on storage of the investigational treatments, please refer to Section 
5.5.3. 
5.1.2  Additional study treatment  
No additional treatment beyond investigational treatment is requested for this trial.  
5.2 Treatment arms 
Subjects will be randomized to one of the following five treatment  arms in a 4:4:4:3:[ADDRESS_304200] three treatment arms and 165 in each of the fourth and fifth 
treatment arm as depi[INVESTIGATOR_48393]:  
• Arm 1: secukinumab 150 mg s.c. without loading regimen: 
secukinumab 150 mg (1.0 mL PFS of 150 mg dose) and placebo (1.0 mL PFS) 
administered at BSL, placebo (2 x 1.0 mL PFS) administered on Weeks 1, 2 and 3, followed by [CONTACT_37234] 150 mg (1.0 mL PFS of 150 mg dose) and placebo (1.0 mL PFS) dosing every four weeks starting at Week 4.  
• Arm 2: secukinumab 150 mg s.c. with loading dose regimen: 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 38  
Clinical Trial Protocol v02 Clean   Protocol No. CAIN457F2342 
 
 secukinumab 150 mg (1.0 mL PFS of 150 mg dose) and placebo (1.0 mL PFS) administered at BSL, Weeks 1, 2 and 3, followed by [CONTACT_250335] 4.  
• Arm 3: secukinumab 300 mg s.c. with loading dose regimen:  
secukinumab 300 mg (2 x 1.0 mL PFS of 150 mg dose) administered at BSL, Weeks 1, 2 and 3, followed by [CONTACT_250335] 4. 
• Arm 4: placebo s.c. followed by [CONTACT_37234] 150mg at Week 16 or 24: 
placebo (2 x 1.0 mL PFS) administered at BSL, Weeks 1, 2 and 3, followed by [CONTACT_250342] 4, and switch to secukinumab 150 mg (1.0 mL PFS of 150 mg dose) at Week 16 or 24. Subjects who don’t respond to the joint criteria at Week 16 will be escaped (i.e. receive their pre -assigned secukinumab treatment starting at Week 
16).  Otherwise, they will continue to receive placebo until Week 24 at which time they will switch to their pre -assigned secukinumab treatment. 
•  Arm 5: placebo s.c. followed by [CONTACT_37234] 300 mg at Week 16 or 24: 
placebo (2 x 1.0 mL PFS) administered at BSL, Weeks 1, 2 and 3, followed by [CONTACT_250342] 4, and switch to secukinumab 300 mg (2 x 1.0 mL PFS of 150 mg dose) at Week 16 or 24. Subjects who don’t respond to the joint criteria at Week 16 will be escaped (i.e. receive their pre- assigned secukinumab treatment starting at 
Week 16). Otherwise, they will continue to receive placebo until Week 24 at which time they will switch to their pre -assigned secukinumab treatmen t. 
Note that the treatment arms 4 and 5 together form placebo treatment group (Group 4) as described in Figure 3 -1. 
Although the number of subjects on the placebo group is higher than any of the individual secukinumab groups, when considering the ratio of secukinumab (all three groups) vs. placebo, the ratio is 2:1. This is justifiable from an ethical standpoint and the statistical justification is provided in Section 3.1. 
Subjects will receive treatment at BSL, Week 1, 2 and 3, followed by [CONTACT_250343] 4 weeks 
starting at Week 4. Subjects will self -administer all secukinuma b and placebo doses through 
Week 104 (with last dose given at Week 100). 
At Week [ADDRESS_304201] been randomized to secukinumab groups at BSL (Groups 1- 3) 
will be classified as either responders (≥20% improvement from BSL in both TJC and SJC) or 
non-responders (<20% improvement from BSL TJC or SJC), however they will continue on the 
same treatment irrespective of their response status.  However the non- responders, defined as 
subjects with <20% improvement from BSL in TJC or SJC, and originally randomized to placebo at BSL (Group 4) will receive either secukinumab 150 mg (one injection each of secukinumab 1 mL/150 mg and 1 mL placebo for 150 mg) or secukinumab 300 mg (two injections of secukinumab 1 mL/150 mg) in a double-blinded fashion (as dictated by [CONTACT_250328]).  
At Week 24 , the remaining subjects originally randomized to placebo (Group 4) and who 
continued receiving placebo s.c. injection after Week 16 will receive secukinumab 150 mg (one injection each of  secukinumab 1 mL/150 mg and 1 mL placebo for 150 mg) or secukinumab 
300 mg (2 injections of secukinumab 1 mL/150 mg) in a blinded fashion (as dictated by 
[CONTACT_76644] 39  
Clinical Trial Protocol v02 Clean   Protocol No. CAIN457F2342 
 
 treatment sequence assigned to these subjects at BSL) . Therefore, after Week 24, all subjects in 
every treatment arm will receive 2 PFS injections (either 2 x 150 mg/mL for 300 mg or 1 x 150 
mg/mL of secukinumab + 1 mL placebo for 150 mg) in a blinded fashion until open- label 
treatment is started.  
Subjects will self -administer all secukinumab and placebo doses at the study site through Week 
52.  
Beginning at Week 52, for subjects whose signs and symptoms are not fully controlled, and 
who the investigator believes may improve further with an increase in dose, may have the 
secukinumab dose increased to 300mg s.c. every [ADDRESS_304202] been completed, site personnel and 
subjects will be unblinded to the orig inal randomized treatment (sequence) assignment. In 
addition, study treatment will be given open -label to eliminate the need for placebo injections 
in subjects on secukinumab [ADDRESS_304203] to administer the PFS at home when they are not visiting the site 
for any other trial related procedures. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_250313] 12- 16 weeks after Week 52. Thus between two site visits  after Week 
52 (Table 6 -2), subjects may self -administer the treatment via PFS at home, which also permits 
less frequent study site visits.  
5.3 Treatment assignment, randomization 
At BSL, all eligible subje cts will be randomized via Interactive Response Technology (IRT) to 
one of the five treatment arms as described in Section 5.2. The investigator or his/her delegate 
will contact [CONTACT_201051]/exclusion criteria. The IRT will assign a randomization number to the subject, which will be used to link the subject to a treatment arm and will specify a unique medication number for the first package of investigation al treatment to be dispensed to the subject. The randomization number will not be 
communicated to the site staff.  
At Week 16, the investigator must contact [CONTACT_250344]’s responder status (responder/non-responder based on ≥ 20% im provement in both swollen and tender joint 
counts) after the subject has been assessed. The IRT will not generate the medication number 
of PFSs to be administered at Week 16, if the subject’s responder status is missing. After receiving the responder statu s IRT will assign the medication number of the PFS to be 
administered. IRT will only communicate to the caller the medication numbers.  
The randomization numbers will be generated using the following procedure to ensure that treatment assignment is unbiased  and concealed from subjects and investigator staff. A subject 
randomization list will be produced by [CONTACT_6609] a validated system that automates the random assignment of subject numbers to randomization numbers. These randomization numbers are linked to the different treatment arms, which in turn are linked to medication numbers. A separate medication list will be produced by [CONTACT_90181] a validated system that automates the random assignment of medication numbers to packs containing the investigational drug(s).  
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 40  
Clinical Trial Protocol v02 Clean   Protocol No. CAIN457F2342 
 
 Subjects will be stratified at randomization on the basis of previous anti -TNF therapy as TNF -
naïve or TNF -IR. Based on enrollment target, 70% of randomized subjects will be TNF -naïve 
and 30% TNF -IR to ensure a representative subject population for the assessment of efficacy 
and safety.  
The randomization scheme for subjects will be reviewed and approved by a member of the 
Integrated Quantitative Sciences (IQS) Randomization Group. 
5.4 Treatment blinding 
This is a double -blind randomized treatment trial. Subjects, investigators, site personnel, and 
persons performing the assessments will remain blinded to treatment assignment from the time of randomization until the Week 52 database lock and analyses are completed, using the following methods: 
1. Randomization data are kept strictly confidential until the time of unblinding and will not 
be accessible by [CONTACT_250345] 
2. The identity of t he treatments will be concealed up to the Week [ADDRESS_304204] emergencies (see Section 5.5.12).  
     
 
The hsCRP results from samples collected during the treatment period will be revealed only after the Week [ADDRESS_304205] Research Organization 
(CRO) pe rsonnel will not be disclosed to investigators, site personnel, subject s and monitors 
during the trial. 
The primary efficacy analysis will be performed when the database is locked (after all subjects 
have completed Week 24 assessments) . Summary results may be shared internally and 
externally; however, individual unblinded subject data will not be disclosed. Data analysts will 
not remain blinded after the Week [ADDRESS_304206] is assigned the next sequential number by [CONTACT_093]. The investigator or his/her staff will contact [CONTACT_109022]. The site should select the case report form (CRF) book with a matching Subject Number from the electronic data capture (EDC) system to enter data.  
If the subject fails to be treated for any reason, the IRT must be  notified within [ADDRESS_304207] been 
re-consented. Subjects who are mis-randomized cannot be re- screened.  
5.5.2  Dispensing the investigational treatment  
Each study site will be supplied by [CONTACT_144949].  
The investigational treatment packaging has  a 2-part label. A unique randomization number is 
printed on each part of this label which corresponds to placebo or active treatment. Investigator staff will identify the investigational treatment package(s) to dispense to the subject by [CONTACT_250346] T and obtaining the medication number(s). Immediately before dispensing the 
package to the subject, investigator staff will detach the outer part of the label from the packaging and affix it to the source document (Drug Label Form) for that subject’s unique subject number. 
5.5.[ADDRESS_304208] access. Upon receipt, all investigational treatment should be stored according to the instructions specified on the labels. Clinical supplies are to be dispensed only in accordance with the protocol. Technical complaints are to be reported to the respective No vartis 
Country Pharma Organization (CPO) Quality Assurance. 
Medication labels will be in the local language and comply with the legal requirements of each 
country. They will include storage conditions for the investigational treatment but no information about the subject except for the medication number. 
The PFS (150 mg active/placebo) sealed in their outer box must be stored in a access 
controlled/locked refrigerator between 2°C and 8°C (36°F and 46°F) (Do Not Freeze) and protected from light. They must be  carefully controlled in accordance with regulations 
governing investigational medicinal products and local regulations. 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_304209] will be self -administering treatment at home (after Week 52), the investigator 
should ensure the subject can store the medication according to these conditions before allowing 
the subject to self -administer at home.  
The investigator must maintain an accurate record of the shipment and dispensing of investigational treatment in a Drug Accountability Log. Monitoring of drug a ccountability will 
be performed by [CONTACT_30798]. Subjects will be asked to return all unused investigational treatment and packaging at the next site visit, at the end of the study or at the time of discontinuation of investigational treatment.  
At the conclusion of the study, and as appropriate during the course of the study, the investigator 
will return all partly used and unused investigational treatment, packaging, drug labels, and a copy of the completed drug accountability log to the [COMPANY_001] as instructed. 
Destruction of the unused drug should be done according to local requirements and after approval by [CONTACT_250347].  
5.5.4  Instructions for prescribing and taking study treatment  
Study treatment (150 mg secukinumab and placebo) will be administered by s.c. PFSs 
throughout the study. Administration of study treatment will occur at the study site through 
Week 52. Administration of study treatment must occur after the study assessments for the visit have been completed. After Week 52, subjects will be allowed to self -administer the study 
treatment at home during the optional visits in which there are no scheduled assessments at the site (see Home Administration in Table 6 -2 below). 
The PFS with the ready -to-use study treatment solution will be provided by [CONTACT_250348]. Detailed instructions on the self -administration of the study treatment will be described 
in the Instructions For  Use (IFU) and provided to each subject. 
At the BSL visit, subjects will be instructed by [CONTACT_7893], utilizing the IFU, on how to self -
inject using a PFS. Subjects will be asked to raise questions, if they have any, and then to proceed with  self-injection. At the Week 1 visit, subjects will be asked to refer to the IFU and 
to proceed directly with self -injection of the study drug (i.e., no prior retraining) for the 
remainder of the trial. However, if the subject  is not comfortable self -injec ting the study 
treatment, then the site staff  may  administer it for the subject . 
All study treatment kits assigned to the subject during the study will be recorded  in the  IRT. 
The first study treatment administration will occur at the BSL/randomization visit only after 
eligibility criteria have been confirmed, all study scheduled BSL assessments have been performed and the scheduled blood samples have been drawn. 
At each subsequent visit, all study assessments, including the completion of Patient Reporte d 
Outcomes (PROs), (as applicable per Table 6 -1 and Table 6 -2), should be completed prior to 
the self -injection of study treatment.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Home administration 
Up to Week 52, all doses of study treatment will be self -administered by [CONTACT_250350], after the study assessments for the visit have been completed. After Week 52 the subjects 
will be allowed to self -administer the study treatment at home during the optional visits period 
when there are no scheduled site assessments. Optional site visits are included in the assessment 
table ( Table 6 -2) and during these visits trial related procedures are to be conducted. Subjects 
will be allowed to self -administer the study treatment via PFS at home or to  visit the site during 
the optional visits to self -administer study treatment under the supervision of the site staff. If

5.5.5  Permitted dose adjustments and interruptions of study treatment  
Study treatment dose adjustments are not permitted. Study treatment in terruption should be 
avoided with the following exceptions: 
Study treatment interruption is only permitted if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], a subject is 
deemed to be placed at a significant safety risk unless dosing is temporarily interrupted. In su ch 
cases study treatment should be interrupted only during the time that this risk is present and ongoing. Study treatment can be restarted at the next scheduled visit after resolution of the safety risk.  
The effect of secukinumab on live vaccines is unknown; therefore live vaccines should not be administered during participation in the study. In case a live vaccine has been administered due to a medical urgency, study treatment should be interrupted for [ADDRESS_304214] is experiencing either no benefit from participation in the trial or  worsening / exacerbation of their disease. 
Rescue medication must not be used before completion of Week 24 assessments (see Section 
3.1). Please see Section 5.5.[ADDRESS_304215] will be restricted 
from receiving necessary rescue medications for lack of benefit or worsening of disease, if rescue with prohibited treatments (as described in Section 5.5.8) occurs prior to completion of

Guidelines for the use of specific medications are provided below: 
Methotrexate  
Subjects taking MTX (up to 25 mg/week) must be on a s table dose for at least [ADDRESS_304218] be taking folic acid supplementation before randomization and during 
the trial to minimize the likelihood of MTX associated toxicity.  
Leflunomide wash- out with cholestyramine  
In case of leflunomide treatment, a drug wash- out of 8 weeks has to be performed. However, 
another wash -out procedure might be considered. Cholestyramine could be given orally to 
wash -out the drug at a dose of 8 g t.i.d. Cholestyramine reduced plasma levels of the active 
leflunomide metabolite by [CONTACT_3450] 40% in 24 hours and by 49% to 65% in [ADDRESS_304219] receives 8 g t.i.d. for 11 days he/she could be

Corticosteroid dose reductions below 10 mg prednisone equivalent are permitted aft er Week 
24, although the corticosteroid dose should not be reduced more than 1 mg prednisone 
equivalent every 4 weeks. 
After Week 52, the dose and regimen of systemic corticosteroids may be modified as per 
investigator’s judgment and subject need. 
Any chan ge in the dose of systemic corticosteroids during the trial must be recorded on the 
corresponding eCRF page. Intra -articular corticosteroids are not permitted within the 4 weeks preceding randomization 
and up to Week 24. After Week 24, no more than 1 joint  per 24- week period may be injected. 
No single injection should exceed 40 mg of triamcinolone (or equivalent) and the total dose of 
intra-articular corticosteroid may not exceed 80 mg of triamcinolone (or equivalent) during any

medications. Administration of these agents requires study discontinuation (see Section 5.5.9 ). 
** See details about corticosteroid management in Section 5.5.[ADDRESS_304224]’s premature discontinuation from the study and 
record this information on the appropriate Study Phase Completion eCRF. 
Study treatment must be discontinued if the investigator determines that continuation of study 
treatment would result in a significant safety risk for a subject.  
The following circumstances require study treatment discontinuation: 
• Withdrawal of informed consent 
• Subject’s request to terminate treatment  
• Emergence of the following AEs: 
• Any severe or serious AE that is not compatible with administration of study medication, including AEs that require treatment with an unacceptable co- medication  
• Onset of lymphoproliferative disease or any malignancy except for treated basal cell carcinoma, treated actinic keratoses, treated in situ carcinoma of the cervix or non- 
invasive malignant colon polyps which are being or have been removed 
• Life-threatening infection  
• Severe hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylactic reaction  
• Any laboratory abnormalities that in the judgment of the investigator a re clinically 
significant and are deemed to place the subject at a safety risk for continuation in the study 
(A general guidance on clinically notable laboratory values is provided in Appendix 8).  
• Pregn ancy  
• Use of any biologic immunomodulating agent except secukinumab 
• Any protocol deviation that results in a significant risk to the subject’s safety.  
In addition to these requirements for study treatment discontinuation, the investigator should discontinue study treatment for a given subject if there is a lack of improvement or worsening

Clinical Trial Protocol v02 Clean   Protocol No. CAIN457F2342 
 
 of their symptoms, or if on balance, he/she thinks that continuation would be detrimental to the 
subject’s well -being. The investigator should discontinue from  study treatment subject s who 
have <20% improvement from BSL in either TJC or SJC at both Week [ADDRESS_304225]’s discontinuation from study treatment.  
For subjects who prematurely discontinue or withdraw during a specific treatment period, the investigator should ensure that the subject completes an End of Study visit (corresponds to the 
last visit for the current period of treatment, e.g. Weeks 24, 52 and 104) [ADDRESS_304226] study treatment and also return for the final Follow -up visit at We ek F112 ([ADDRESS_304227] study 
treatment, see Table 6 -1 and Table 6 -2). Even if the subject is not willing to come back for all 
assessment s, every effort should be made to collect the scheduled X -ray assessments. The final 
visit should be performed before any new treatment is initiated. 
5.5.[ADDRESS_304228] s whose status is unclear because they fail to appear for study visits without stating 
an intention to withdraw, the investigator should show "due diligence" by [CONTACT_237187] , family or family physician as agreed in the informed consent and by [CONTACT_250352] , e.g. dates of telephone calls, registered 
letters, etc. A subject should not be formally considered lost to follow -up until his/her scheduled 
End of Study visit would have occurred. 
5.5.[ADDRESS_304229], he/she must provide the req uested subject identifying information and confirm the necessity to break the treatment 
code for the subject. The investigator will then receive details of the investigational drug treatment for the specified subject and a fax or email confirming this info rmation. The system 
will automatically inform the [COMPANY_001] monitor for the site and the Global Trial Lead (GTL) or designee that the code has been broken. 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that there is a procedure in place to allow access 
to the IRT in case of emergency. The investigator will inform the subject how to contact [CONTACT_5657]/her backup in cases of emergency when he/she is unavailable. The investigator will provide protocol number CAIN457F2342, study drug name [CONTACT_90228], subject number, and instructions for contact[CONTACT_144957] (or any entity to which it has delegated responsibility for emergency code breaks) to the subject in case an emergency unblinding is required at a time when the investigator and backup are unavailable.  
Study drug must be discontinued after emergency unblinding. 
5.5.[ADDRESS_304230] completed the study if he/she received a total of [ADDRESS_304231]’s completion or discontinuation of the study and the reason for 
discontinuation of the study will be recorded on the appropriate Study Phase Completion eCRF page.  
In any case, the investigator or site staff must contact [CONTACT_144958]’s study completion (Visit F112) and/or discontinuation. 
The investigator must provide follow -up medical care for all subjects who are prematurely 
withdrawn from the study, or must refer them for appropriate ongoing care. This care may 
include initiating another treatment outside of the study as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_093]. This treatment may be any non -biologic DMARD. In case of a biologi c treatment,

the assessments are outlined in Table 6 -2 (Week 56 to Week 104 and Follow-up Week F112). 
Subjects should be seen for all visits on the designated day, or as closely as possible to the original planned visit schedule. 
• For visits scheduled through Week 4, the study treatment should not be administered less 
than 7 days from the previous administration. 
• For visits scheduled after Week 4, the study treatment should not be administered less than 
14 days from the previous administration. 
Subjects who prematurely discontinue during a specific treatment period should return for the final visit within that treatment period ([ADDRESS_304235] study treatment), as well as  return 
for the follow-up visit (Week F112), [ADDRESS_304236] will 
sign the ICF, be evaluated for eligibility and allowed sufficient time for potential medication 
washout (see Table 5 -1, in addition to all other assessments indicated in Table 6 -1). 
Screening will consist of two consecutive visits. During the first SCR visit, initial assessments will be performed as outlined in Table 6 -1. At that visit the duration of the washout period will 
be determined. The second SCR visit will be performed as follows: 
• If the washout period is ≤ 4 weeks the investigator should proceed directly to SCR visit 2 
on the same day and complete all assessments in the next 4 weeks prior to randomization. 
• If the washout period is more than [ADDRESS_304237] meets all inclusion/exclusion 
criteria. In some sites selected by [CONTACT_5343], the X -ray assessment may be replaced by [CONTACT_250353].  
All subjects evaluated at SCR visits [ADDRESS_304238] will be unable to complete the washout in the appropriate time frame before randomization. 
Subjects who prematurely withdraw from the study will not be replaced.

6.4.1  American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response  
The ACR response ( Appendix 3) will be used to determine efficacy ( Felson et al 1995). A 
subject is defined as e.g. an ACR20 responder if, and only if, the following three conditions 
hold: 
1. they have a ≥ 20% improvement in the number of tender joints (based on 78 joints) 
2. they have a ≥ 20% improvement in the number of swollen joints (based on 76 joints) 
3. they have a ≥ 20% improvement in three of the following five domains: 
• Patient’s global assessment of disease activity (measured on a VAS scale, 0 -100)  
• Physician’s global assessment of disease activity (measured on a VAS scale, 0 -100)  
• Patient’s assessment of PsA pain (measured on a VAS scale, 0 -100) 
• Health Assessment Questionnaire – Disability Index (HAQ -DI©) score  
• Acute phase reactant (hsCRP or ESR)  

[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 60  
Clinical Trial Protocol v02 Clean   Protocol No. CAIN457F2342 
 
 ACR50 = 50% improvement in at least 3 of the 5 measures and 50% improvement in the swollen 
and tender joint count. 
ACR70 = 70% improvement in at least 3 of the 5 measures and 70% improvement in the swollen 
and tender joint count. 
The ACR res ponse is to be assessed at the visits/time points shown in Table 6 -1 and Table 6 -2. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Tender 78 joint count and swollen 76 joint count  
Joint counts will be performed by [CONTACT_73719](s) who must be well trained and 
part of the site personnel. Whenever possible, the same evaluator should perform these assessments at all visits.  
The [ADDRESS_304253] carpometacarpal, 10 metacarpophalangeal, 10 proximal interphalangeal, 8 distal interphalangeal joints of the hands, the 2 hip, 2 knee, 2 talo- tibial, 2 mid -tarsal , 10 metatarsophalangeal, 10 proximal 
interphalangeal, and 8 distal interphalangeal joints of the feet. All of these except for the hips are assessed for swelling. Joint tenderness and swelling are to be graded present (1) or absent (0). Synovial fluid and/or soft tissue swelling but not bony overgrowth represents a positive result for swollen joint count. Dactylitis of a digit in the foot or hand counts as one tender and swollen joint.  
Data is recorded for tender and swollen joints (right or left side), i.e. a box (yes, no or not applicable) needs to be ticked for all joints. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Patient’s assessment of PsA pain  
The patient’s assessment of pain will be performed using 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) 
ranging from ‘no pain’ to ‘unbearable pain’ after the question ‘ Please indicate with a vertical 
mark ( | ) through the horizontal line the most pain you had from your psoriatic arthritis today’ . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Patient’s global assessment of disease activity  
The patient’s global assessment of disease activity will be perform ed using 100 mm visual

horizontal line how well you are today’ . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Physician’s global assessment of disease activity  
The physician’s global assessment of disease activity will be performed using 100 mm VAS ranging from no disease activity to maximal disease activity, after the question ‘Considering 
all the ways the disease affects your patient, draw a line on the scale for how well his or her condition is today’ . To enhance objectivity, the physician must not be aware of the specific 
patient’s global assessment of disease activity, when performing his own assessment on tha t 
subject.

The HAQ -DI© was developed by [CONTACT_250356] -term influence of chronic disease on a subject's level of functional 
ability and activity restriction. The disability assessment component of the HAQ, the HAQ -
DI©, assesses a subject's level of functional ability and includes questions of fine movements of 
the upper extremity, locomotor activities of the lower extremity, and activities that involve both 
upper and lower extremities. There are [ADDRESS_304254] week "Are you able to …" perform a particular task. Each item is scored on a 4- point scale from 0 to 3, representing normal (normal, no difficulty [0]), some difficulty 
(1), much difficulty (2), and unable to do (3). 
The purpose of the HAQ -DI
© in this study is to assess the functional ability of subjects with 
PsA.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  High Sensitivity C -reactive protein (hsCRP)  
Blood for this assessment will be obtained in order to identify the presence of inflammation, to 
determine its severity, and to monitor response to treatment.  
Since the results of this test may unblind study personnel, results from the central lab will be 
provided for SCR and BSL only. The hsCRP results from samples collected during the treatment period will be revealed following database lock only. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Eryt hrocyte sedimen tation rate (ESR)  
Blood for ESR, which is helpful in diagnosing inflammatory diseases and is used to monitor 
disease activity and response to therapy, will be obtained at scheduled visits as indicated in Table 6 -1 and  Table 6 -2. 
6.4.2  Radiographic assessments 
Separate radiographs of each hand/wrist (PA) and each foot (AP) will be taken at BSL, Week 16/24, 52, and 104. Bone erosion, joint space narrowing (JSN), and total radiographic scores 
will be determined using a PsA modified van der Heijde ‐Sharp (vdH ‐S) scoring method 
(van der Heijde et al 2005 ) that includes the s econd through fifth distal interphalangeal (DIP) 
joints of each hand. Erosions (0–5 in the hands and 0–10 in the feet) and JSN (0–4) will be 
graded separately in six wrist joints, all metacarpal phalangeal, proximal interphalangeal and DIP joints of each hand, and the first interphalangeal joint and all metatarsal phalangeal joints for each foot. The total radiographic score (hands and feet combined) ranges from [ADDRESS_304255] s who are non-responder at Week 16 (not achieving a ≥20% improvement from baseline 
in both TJC and SJC) will have their hands/wrists and feet X- rays taken at thi s visit (Week 16) 
and at Week 24 visit . Subjects who are responder at Week 16 (≥20% improvement from 
baseline in both tender and swollen joint counts) will have their hands/wrists and feet X -rays 
taken at Week 24.  
Subjects who discontinue study treatment before the end of the trial, hands/wrists and feet X -
rays will be taken at the time of study treatment discontinuation. However, if the radiograph 
performed at time of early discontinuation of study treatment is less than 60 days from a prior 
X-ray, it does not need to be performed except for Week 16 non- responders where a 30 day 
time period will apply between Weeks 16 and 24. Likewise, if a scheduled X -ray at Week 24, 
52, or 104 is scheduled less than 60 days after any prior hands/wrists and feet X -rays, i t does 
not need to be performed, except for Week 16 non-responders where a 30- day time period will 
apply between weeks 16 and 24..  
The readings of the X -rays and the scoring will be performed centrally. Complete X -ray 
procedures will be defined in an Imaging Manual provided to the centers by [CONTACT_250357]. 
6.4.4  DA
S28  
The DAS28 is a measure of disease activity based on Swollen and Tender Joint Counts, ESR or CRP and the Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity. A DAS28 score > 5.1 implies active disease, ≤ 3.2 low disease activity, and < 2.[ADDRESS_304256] with enthesitis.  
6.4.9  Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)  
The PASI assesses the extent of psoriasis on four body surface areas (head, trunk and upper and 
lower limbs) and the degree of plaque erythema, scaling and thickness. A PASI score 
(Fredriksson and Pettersson 1978, Weisman et al 2003 , Gottlieb et al 2005 ) will be derived as 
indicated in  Table 6 -3.  
The head, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs are assessed separately for erythema, thickening (plaque elevation, induration), and scaling (desquamation). The average degree of severity of each sign in each of the four body regions is assigned a score of 0 -4. The area covered by [CONTACT_250358] a percentage of the total area of that particular body region. Further practical details help the assessment:  
• The neck is assessed as part of the head.  
• The axillae and groin are assessed as part of the trunk.  
• The buttocks are assessed as part of the lower limbs. 
When scoring the severity of erythema, scales should not be removed.

† Neck is assessed as part of the Head (H) body region.  
‡ Axillae and groin are assessed as part of the Trunk (T) body region.  
§ Buttocks are assessed as part of the Lower limbs (L) body region.  
The head and neck, upper limbs, trunk and lower limbs correspond to approximately 10%, 20%, 
30% and 40% of the body surface area, respectively; the PASI score is calculated using the following formula: 
PASI = 0.1(E
H+IH+D H)AH + 0.2(E U+IU+D U)AU + 0.3(E T+IT+D T)AT + 0.4(E L+IL+D L)AL 
where E = erythema; I = induration; D = desquamation; A = area; H = Head; U = Upper limbs; 
T = Trunk; and L = Lower limbs 
PASI scores can range from a lower value of 0, corresponding to no signs of psoriasis, up to a 
theoretic maximum of 72.0. The investigator is responsible for collecting the components or scoring signs and total regional area. More information is provided in Appendix 5.

6.5.[ADDRESS_304259] may participate in the study if further work up (according to local 
practice/guidelines) establishes conclusively that the subject has no evidence of active tuberculosis, or if presence of latent tuberculosis  is established then treatment according to local 
country guidelines must have been initiated. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  QuantiFERON TB -Gold test  
A QuantiFERON TB -Gold test is to be performed at the second SCR visit and the results to be 
known prior to randomization to determine th e subject’s eligibility for the trial. The test will be 
used to screen the subject population for latent tuberculosis infection. 
The test will be analyzed by [CONTACT_2237]. Details on the collection, processing and 
shipment of samples and reporting of results by [CONTACT_90209].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  [COMPANY_003] skin test  
A [COMPANY_003] skin test is to be performed at SCR and read before randomization to determine the subject’s eligibility for the trial. The test dose is bioequivalent to [ADDRESS_304260] superficial layer under the skin. If given correctly, the injection should raise a small wheal of about 5 mm, which resolves within 10-15 minutes.  
Because the reaction (indur ation) will take [ADDRESS_304261] return to 
the investigators’ site within that time for a proper evaluation of the injection site. This will 
determine whether the subject has had a significant reaction to the [COMPANY_003] test. A reaction is 
measured in millimeters of induration (hard swelling) at the site. A [COMPANY_003] skin induration ≥5 mm (or according to local practice/guidelines) is interpreted as a positive result.  
6.5.5  Laboratory evaluations  
A central laboratory will be used for analysis of all specimens listed below (except urinalysis). Details on the collection, shipment of samples and reporting of results by [CONTACT_90209]. For the identification of clinically notable values, see Appendix 7 and Appendix 8. All subjects with laboratory tests containing clinically significant 
abnormal values are to be followed until the values return to normal ranges or until a valid reason, other than treatment related AE, is defined.

be recorded in the appropriate eCRF page.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Lipid panel  
A lipid profile including High Density Lipoprotein (HDL), Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL), cholesterol and triglycerides will be measured from a fasting blood sample. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Cardiovascular panel  
A cardiovascular profile including lipoprotein (a), apolipoprotein B, apolipoprotein A -1, and 
adiponectin will be measured from a blood sample. 6.5.6  Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
A standard [ADDRESS_304262] be performed on the ECG machines provided for the study. 
All ECGs will be independently reviewed. Instructions for the collection and transmission of 
the ECGs to the independent reviewer will be provided in the ECG investigator manual. 
Clinically  relevant abnormalities should be recorded on the relevant medical history/Current 
medical conditions eCRF page for the BSL ECG. Clinically relevant abnormalities noted after the BSL ECG should be reported as AE (see  
Section 7 ).

must be used for women of child- bearing potential (see exclusion criteria definitions, Section 
4.2). 
A serum β -hCG test will be performed in all women at SCR. All women who are not surgically 
sterile or post -menopausal (as defined in Section 4.2) at SC R will have local urine pregnancy 
tests as indicated in Table [ADDRESS_304264] SCR visit (Visit 1) for anti- CCP antibodies and the 
Rheumatoid Factor (RF) assessment. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) and anti -double stranded 
deoxyribonucleic acid antibody (anti -dsDNA) antibodies will also be assessed at visits/time 
points indicated in Table [ADDRESS_304265] X -ray or MRI at SCR (or within 3 months prior to SCR) is performed to rule 
out the presence of a pulmonary malignancy of infectious process in particular tuberculosis. 
The radiation exposure that results from these X -ray measurements is not necessary for medical 
care but is intended for research purposes only. The total amount of radiation from all X -ray 
measurements performed in th is study ([ADDRESS_304266] X -ray, 4 X -rays of hands/wrists and feet) 
is estimated to be around 1 mS over 104 weeks, and is approximately equivalent to a uniform 
whole body exposure of 26 weeks of exposure to natural background radiation. For effective 
radiat ion doses under 3 mS (300 mrem), the risk is considered to be minimal. Therefore, the 
radiation exposure in this study involves minimal risk and is necessary to ensure reliable safety measures before the treatment with a biologic.  
The safety assessments selected are standard and adequate for this indication/subject population.

A
ll questionnaires will be completed at the defined visits/ time points listed in  Table [ADDRESS_304268] seeing the investigator for any clinical assessment or evaluation. 
The questionnaires will be in the respondent’s local language. The subject should be given 
sufficient instruction, space, time and privacy to complete the questionnaires. The study coordinator should check the questionnaires for completeness and encourage the subject to complete any missing responses.  
Comple ted questionnaires should be reviewed and assessed by [CONTACT_093], before the 
clinical examination, for responses which may indicate potential AEs or SAEs. This assessment 
should be documented in the source records. If AEs or SAEs are confirmed the investigator should record the events as per instructions given in the relevant section of the protocol (see  
Section 7 ). 
Guidelines for administering the PRO questionnaires can be found in Appendix 2.

 • is medically significant, i.e. defined as an event that jeopardizes the patient or may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
All malignant neoplasms will be assessed as serious under “medically significant” if other seriousness criteria are not met.  
Unlike routine safety assessments, SAEs are monitored continuously and have special reporting 
requirements; see Section 7.2. 
All AE’s should be treated appropriately. Treatment may include one or more of t he following: 
no action taken (i.e. further observation only); study treatment dosage adjusted/temporarily interrupted; study drug(s) permanently discontinued; concomitant medication given; non- drug 
therapy given. The action taken to treat the AE should be  recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
Once an AE is detected, it should be followed until its resolution or until it is judged to be permanent, and assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in severity, the su spected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required 
to treat it, and the outcome.  
Information about common side effects already known about the investigational drug can be found in the IB or will be communicated between IB updates in the form of Investigator 
Notifications. This information will be included in the subject informed consent and should be 
discussed with the subject during the study as needed. 
The investigator should also instruct each subject to report any new AE (beyond the prot ocol 
observation period) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might 
reasonably be related to study treatment. This information should be recorded in the investigator’s source documents; however, if the AE meets the criteria of an SAE, it must be 
reported to [COMPANY_001]. 
7.2 Serious adverse events 
7.2.1  Definition of SAE  
An SAE is defined as any AE (appearance of (or worsening of any pre -existing) undesirable 
sign(s), symptom(s) or medical conditions(s) which meets any one of the following crit eria: 
• is fatal or life -threatening  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], unless hospi[INVESTIGATOR_062]:  
• routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deterioration in condition (specify what this includes) 
• elective or pre- planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the 
indication under study and has not worsened since signing the informed consent 
• treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_250316] 82  
Clinical Trial Protocol v02 Clean   Protocol No. CAIN457F2342 
 
 • social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_108999]’s general condition  
• is medically significant, i.e. defined as an event that jeopardizes the subject  or may require 
medical or surgical intervention.  
All malignant neoplasms will be assessed as serious under “medically significant” if other seriousness criteria are not met.  
Life-threatening in the context of a SAE refers to a reaction in which the subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might have caused death if more severe (see Annex IV, ICH -E2D Guideline). 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be immediately life threa tening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37208]. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bron chospasm, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6536] (see Annex IV, ICH-E2D Guideline). 
Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a 
serious adverse reaction.  
All AEs (serious and non- serious) are captured on the CRF, SAEs also require individual 
reporting to Drug Safety and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_623] (DS&E) as per Section 7.2.2. 
7.2.[ADDRESS_304271] has 
provided informed consent and until 12 weeks (84 days) after last administered dose of study treatment or [ADDRESS_304272] has stopped study parti cipation (whichever is later) must 
be reported to [COMPANY_001] within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. 
Any SAEs experienced after this period should only be reported to [COMPANY_001] if the investigator 
suspects a causal relationship to study treatment.  
Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the Serious Adverse Event Report 
Form; all applicable sections of the form must be completed in order to provide a clinically thorough report. The investigator must assess the relationship of each SAE to each specific 
component of study treatment, (if study treatment consists of several components) complete the SAE Report Form in English, and submit the completed form within [ADDRESS_304273] ew from study participation  
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 83  
Clinical Trial Protocol v02 Clean   Protocol No. CAIN457F2342 
 
 If the SAE is not previously documented in the IB or Package Insert (new occurrence) and is 
thought to be related to the investigational treatment a Drug Safety and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_250317]. [COMPANY_001] may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN) to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same investigational treatment that this SAE has been reported.  Suspec ted Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be collected 
and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics committees in accordance with EU Guidance 2011/C 172/[ADDRESS_304274] safety and enhance reliability in determining the hepatotoxic potential of an investigational drug, a standardized process for identification, monitoring and evaluation of liver events has to be followed. 
The following two categories of abnormalities / AEs have to be considered during the course 
of the study: 
• Liver laboratory triggers, which will require repeated assessments of the abnormal 
laboratory parameter  
• Liver events, which will require close observation, follow-up monitoring and completion of the standard base liver CRF pages  
Please refer to Table 19 -1 in Appendix 7 for complete definitions of liver laboratory triggers 
and liver events. 
Every liver laboratory trigger or liver event as defined in Table 19 -1 of Appendix 7  should be 
followed up by [CONTACT_121967].  
Detailed information is outlined in Table 19 -2 in Appendix 7. 
For the liver laboratory trigger: 
• Repeating the LFT within the next week to confirm elevation or resolution. 
These LFT repeats should be performed using the central laboratory if possible. If this is not 
possible, then the repeats can be  performed at a local laboratory to monitor the safety of the 
subject. Repeats laboratory should then be performed at central laboratory as soon as possible. If a liver event is subsequently reported, any local LFTs previously conducted that are associated  with this event should be reported on the Liver CRF pages. 
For the liver events: 
• Repeating the LFT to confirm elevation as appropriate  
• Discontinuation of the investigational drug if appropriate 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_131539] 
• A causality assessment of the liver event via exclusion of alternative causes (e.g., disease, 
co-medications)  
• An investigation of the liver event which needs to be followed until resolution. 
These investigations can include serology tests, imaging and pathology assessments, hepatologist’s consultancy, based on investigator’s discretion. All follow -up information, and

clinically significant abnormal values (see Appendix 8 for notable laboratory values) are to be 
followed until the values return to normal ranges or until a valid reason, other than treatment related AE, is defined. Standard renal function tests (blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine) will 
be obtained at regular intervals, but special measures for renal safety monitoring are not planned. 
7.[ADDRESS_304276] be reported to 
[COMPANY_001]/CRO within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. The study drug must be discontinued, though the subject may stay in the study, if she wishes to do so. All assessments that are considered as a risk during pregnancy must not be performed. The subject may continue all other protocol assessments.   Pregnancy must be recorded on a Pharmacovigilance Pregnancy Form and reported by [CONTACT_250363]/CRO Drug Safety and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_066]. Pregnancy follow- up should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the 
possible relationship to the [COMPANY_001]/CRO study drug of any pregnancy outcome. Any SAE experienced during pregnancy must be reported on the SAE Report Form. 
8 Data review and database management  
8.1 Site monitoring 
Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an investigator’s meeting, a [COMPANY_001] representative will review the protocol and CRFs with the investigators and their staff. During the study, [COMPANY_001] employs several methods of ensuring protocol and good clinical practice (GCP) compliance and the quality/integrity of the sites’ data. The field monitor will visit the site to check the completeness of subject records, the accuracy of entries on the (e)CRFs, the adherence to the protocol  and to GCP, the progress of enrollment, and to ensure that study 
treatment is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications. Key study personnel must be available to assist the field monitor during these visits. Continuous remote monitoring of each site’s data may be performed by a centralized [COMPANY_001] CRA organization, Additionally, a central analytics organization may analyze data & identify risks & trends for 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_304277] in the study, consisting of 
case and visit notes (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5320]) containing demographic and medical information, laboratory data, ECGs, and the results of any other tests or assessments. All 
information on CRFs must be traceable to these source documents in the subject 's file. The 
investigator must also keep the original informed consent form signed by [CONTACT_423] (a signed copy is giv en to the subject). 
The investigator must give the monitor access to all relevant source documents to confirm their consistency with the CRF entries. [COMPANY_001] monitoring standards require full verification for the presence of informed consent, adherence to  the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of 
SAEs, and of data that will be used for all primary variables. Additional checks of the consistency of the source data with the CRFs are performed according to the study -specific 
monitoring plan. No information in source documents about the identity of the subjects will be disclosed. 
8.2 Data collection 
Designated investigator staff will enter the data required by [CONTACT_109051]/RDC system. Designated investigator site staff will not be given access to the system until they have been trained.  
Automatic validation procedures within the system check for data discrepancies during and 
after data entry and, by [CONTACT_105273], allow the data to be confirmed or corrected online by [CONTACT_105274]. The Investigator must certify that the data entered into the  eCRFs are complete and accurate. After database lock, the investigator 
will receive copi[INVESTIGATOR_109002].

absolute number of subjects in each category and relative frequencies will be provided.  
Unless otherwise specified, p- values will be presented as 2 -sided p -values and the type I error 
rate (alpha) will be 5%.  
Inferential effica cy comparisons with placebo will generally focus on the first 16- weeks of 
treatment except for radiographic assessment which will focus on the first 24 -weeks of the 
treatment unless otherwise specified.

 Efficacy and safety data for the placebo -controlled period (or the entire treatment period as 
appropriate) will be presented by [CONTACT_6660]. Subjects may be included in more than one 
treatment group for some analyses (e.g. exposure -adjusted AEs over the entire treatment 
period). 
Note that the treatment groups for a subject may differ depending on the time period of the 
analysis and whether one assesses the subject for efficacy or safety (see Section 9.1 for details).  
Data may also be presented by a combinatio n of the ‘original’ and ‘switch’ treatment groups. 
These treatment groups represent the treatment combinations the subjects experience over the 
course of the entire trial.  
9.1 Analysis sets  
The following analysis sets will be used in this trial: 
Randomized set : The randomized set will be defined as all subjects who were randomized. 
Unless otherwise specified, mis -randomized subjects (mis -randomized in Interactive Voice 
Response (IVR)) will be excluded from the randomized set. Mis- randomized subjects are defined as those subjects who were mistakenly randomized into 
the IVR prior to the site confirming all eligibility criteria had been met and to whom no study 
medication was given. Mis- randomized subjects are treated as screen failures.  
Full analysis set (FAS) : The FAS will be comprised of all subjects from the randomized set to 
whom study treatment has been assigned. Following the intent -to-treat principle, subjects will 
be analyzed according to the treatment assigned to at randomization , but with actual anti -TNF 
status . 
Safety set : The safety set includes all subjects who took at least one dose of study treatment 
during the treatment period. Subjects will be evaluated according to treatment received. 
9.[ADDRESS_304280] demographics and other baseline characteristics  
Demographics and baseline characteristics 
Summary statistics will be presented for continuous demographic and BSL characteristic 
variables for each treatment group and for all subjects in the randomized set. The number and 
percentage of subjects in each category will be presented for categorical variables for each treatment group and all subjects. 
The following demographic variables and BSL disease characteristics will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_6660]:  
• Gender, age, race, ethnicity, weight, height, and BMI 
• TNFα history (naïve or inadequate responder), ACR components, number of prior biologic PsA therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], dose of MTX or other DMARD at randomization.

9.3 Treatments 
Study treatment 
The analysis of study treatment data will be based on the safety set. The number of active and 
placebo injections received wi ll be presented by [CONTACT_1570].  
The duration of exposure to study treatment will also be summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. In addition, the number and percentage of subjects with cumulative exposure levels (e.g. any exposure, ≥ 1 week, ≥ 2 weeks, ≥ 3 weeks, ≥ 4 weeks, ≥ 8 weeks, etc.) will be presented. 
Prior and concomitant medication  
Prior and concomitant medications will be summarized in separate tables by [CONTACT_1570]. 
Prior medications are defined as treatments taken and stopped prior to first dose of study treatment. Any medication given at least once between the day of first dose of randomized study treatment and the date of the last study visit will be a concomitant medication, including those which were started pre - BSL and continued into the period where study treatment is 
administered.  
Medications will be presented in alphabetical order, by [CONTACT_121974] (ATC) codes and grouped by [CONTACT_121975]. Tables will show the overall number and percentage of subjects receiving at least one treatment of a particular ATC code and at least one treatment in a particular anatomical main group.

9.4 Analysis of the primary variable(s) 
Details of the testing strategy including primary and secondary endpoints are provided in Section 9.5.1 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 89  
Clinical Trial Protocol v02 Clean   Protocol No. CAIN457F2342 
 
 9.4.1  Variable(s)  
The primary efficacy variable will be ACR20 response at Week 16. The analysis of the primary 
efficacy variable will be based on the FAS subjects. Primarily, CRP will be used instead of ESR 
to calculate ACR response; ESR will only be used in the event CRP is missing. 
9.4.2  Statistical model, h ypothesis, and method of analysis  
The statistical hypothesis for ACR20 being tested is that there is no difference in the proportion 
of subjects fulfilling the ACR20 criteria at Week 16 in any of the secukinumab regimens vs . 
placebo regimen.  
Let p j denote the proportion of ACR20 responders at Week 16 for treatment regimens j, j=0, 1, 
2, 3 where  
• 0 corresponds to placebo regimen, 
• 1 corresponds to secukinumab 150 mg PFS without loading, 
• 2 corresponds to secukinumab 150 mg PFS with loading, 
• 3 corresponds to secukinumab 300 mg PFS with loading, 
In statistical terms, H j: pj = p 0, HAj: pj ≠ p 0, for the jth secukinumab regimen, i.e. 
H1: secukinumab [ADDRESS_304282] to signs and symptoms (ACR20 response) at Week 16 
H2: secukinumab [ADDRESS_304283] 
to signs and symptoms (ACR20 response) at Week 16 H
3: secukinumab [ADDRESS_304284] 
to signs and symptoms (ACR20 response) at Week 16  The primary endpoint of ACR20 at Week 16 in the FAS will be evaluated using a  logistic 
regression with treatment and randomization stratum (TNFα status –naïve or IR) as factor s and 
weight as a covariate. Odds ratios will be computed for comparisons of secukinumab regimens 
vs. placebo regimen utilizing the logistic regression model fitted.  
9.4.3  Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations  
Missing data for ACR20 response and other binary efficacy variables (e.g. ACR50, ACR70, 
HAQ- DI
© response, etc.) for d ata up to Week 24  will be handled as follows: 
• Subjects who drop out of the trial for any reason will be considered non-responders from the time they drop out through Week 24. 
• Subjects who do not have the required data to compute ACR response (i.e. tender and swollen joint counts and at least three of the five ACR core set variables) at BSL and at the specific time point will be classified as non -responders. 
Continuous variables (e.g. ACR components, DAS, etc.) will be analyzed using a mixed -effects 
repeated measures model (MMRM) which is valid under the missing at random (MAR) assumption. For analyses of these parameters, if all post -BSL values are missing then these 
missing values will not be impute d and this subject will be removed from the analysis of the 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 90  
Clinical Trial Protocol v02 Clean   Protocol No. CAIN457F2342 
 
 corresponding variable, i.e. it might be that the number of subjects providing data to an analysis 
is smaller than the number of subjects in the FAS. 
Data collected after Week 24 will generally be  presented as ‘observed case’; i.e. all available 
data for each time point will be included in the analyses.  
In general, the handling of data for subjects who are rescued at Week 16 will be handled in the 
following fashion for comparisons with placebo at Week 20 and Week 24: 
• For each binary endpoint, a subject will be consisted as a non-responder at Week 20/[ADDRESS_304285] is a non-responder (including missing imputed non-responder) at Week 16. If a subject is a responder at Week 16, the actual value at Week 20/24 will be used (missing is considered as non-responder). This will be done for all treatment regimens in order to minimize bias.  
• For continuous endpoints, the goal of the analyses would be to estimate what would have happened if the subjects had stayed on the original treatment. Thus, the data collected after the subject switches to secukinumab will be treated as missing for placebo subjects and will be analyzed using a MMRM which is valid under the missing at random (MAR) assumption. For secukinumab subjects, the actual values will be used in the analysis. 
For comparisons between the active groups the rescue penalty will not be applied as the effect of rescuing is the same for both treatment groups (i.e. the subject continues to re ceive 
secukinumab 150 mg or 300 mg every 4 weeks). 
9.5 Analysis of secondary variables  
9.5.1  Efficacy variables  
The secondary efficacy variables are listed below. Secondary efficacy variables will be analyzed using the FAS population unless otherwise specified.

The graphical  approach of ( Bretz et al 2009 ) for sequentially rejective testing procedures is used 
to illustrate the testing strategy:  
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 93  
Clinical Trial Protocol v02 Clean   Protocol No. CAIN457F2342 
 
 Figure 9-1 Hierarchical testing strategy  
 
The family -wise error will be set to α=5% and it will be controlled with the proposed 
hierarchical testing strategy. With this approach, the hypotheses will be separated into two families. The first family will include hypo theses of ACR20 at Week 16 and mTSS at Week 24 
(H
1 through H 6). The Hypotheses of additional signs and symptoms (H 7 to H 24) will be the 
second family. The second family hypotheses will be tested only when all hypotheses in the first family have been reject ed.  
Each of the hypotheses ( H
1, H2 and H 3) for the primary objective (ACR20 at Week 16) for each 
secukinumab regimen vs. placebo will be tested simultaneously at α/3. Then based on the 
rejection of one or more (of H 1, H 2 and H 3), the mTSS at Week 24 endpoint will be tested 
hierarchically for each dose (through H 4, H5 or H 6) at the level of α/3. If anyone is rejected, then 
half (1/2) of α/[ADDRESS_304313] family are all rejected, then AIN457 300 mg for all variables in the second 
family will be tested hierarchically at α starting from PASI75 (H 7). If all varaibles in AIN457 
[ADDRESS_304314] AIN457 150 mg group and finally AIN 457 150 mg No 
Load group for all variables in hierarchy. Of note, in the description above, rejection of a 
hypothesis refers to rejection of the two- sided hypothesis; however the level of a rejected 
hypothesis is only passed on according to the graphical procedure for the test of another hypothesis if the treatment effect is in favor of secukinumab. 
ACR50 at Week 16  
Response at Week 16 to ACR50 in the FAS will be evaluated using a logistic regression model 
with treatment and randomization stratum (TNFα status –naïve or IR) as factors and weight as a covariate.  
Joint/bone structural damage at Week 24  
The change at Week 24 from BSL van der Heijde total modified Sharp score will be evaluated 
using a non- parametric ANCOVA model with treatment regimen and randomization stratum 
(TNFα status – naïve or IR) as factors, and weight and BSL van der Heijde total modified Sharp 
score as covariates. For subjects  either on placebo or active,  who have a missing Sharp score 
at Week 24, linear extrapolation will be used to im pute the value at Week [ADDRESS_304315] before Week 24 (including baseline assessment).  
For placebo subjects who meet the criteria for early escape at Week 16, they will be treated as 
missing for placebo treatment and linear extrapolation will be used to impute the value at Week 24. If BSL or all post - BSL total modified Sharp score/s is/are missing for a subject, the subject 
will be excluded from the analyses.  
Sensitivity analysis will be performed with possibly valid missing data imputation methods including: 
• Using all available Week 24 data for early escape for all subjects  (placebo  and active) ; 
• LOCF instead of linear extrapolation; 
• Multiple imputation and tippi[INVESTIGATOR_11300]; 
• Binary endpoint analysis (no disease progression 
defined as those  subjects who have a 
change in mTSS at Week 24 relative to baseline <= 0.5 ) with logistic model: 
o LOCF;  
o Multiple imputation ;  
o Tippi[INVESTIGATOR_11300]. 
Physical function (HAQ -DI©) 
Between -treatment differences in the change in HAQ- DI© will be evaluated using a MMRM  
with treatment regimen , analysis visit and TNF -alpha inhibitor status as factors, and weight and 
BSL HAQ -DI© score as continuous covariates. Treatment by [CONTACT_250365]. An unstr uctured covariance structure 
will be assumed for this model. The significance of the treatment effects for secukinumab 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_304316] dactylitis at BSL will be 
evaluated using a logistic regression model with treatment and randomization stratum (TNFα status –naïve or IR) as factors and weight as a covariate.  
Enthesitis at Week [ADDRESS_304317] enthes itis at BSL will be 
evaluated using a logistic regression model with treatment and randomization stratum (TNFα status –naïve or IR) as factors and weight as a covariate.  
PASI75 and PASI90 response  
PASI75 response and PASI90 at Week 16  will be evaluated for  those subjects in whom the 
assessment occurred due to sufficient skin involvement (at least 3% BSA affected with psoriasis)  (which is planned to be a subset of the FAS). These binary variables will be evaluated 
in the same fashion as ACR response, i.e. a logistic regression model with treatment and 
randomization strata as factors and weight as a covariate.  
Changes in DAS28 -CRP  
Between -treatment differences in the change from baseline in DAS28 -CRP will be compared 
by [CONTACT_3553] a MMRM with treatment regimen, analysis visit , and TNF -alpha inhibitor status 
as factors , and weight and BSL as continuous covariates. Treatment by [CONTACT_250366]. An unstructured covariance 
structure will be assumed for this model. The significance of the treatment effects for secukinumab regimens at different analysis visits will be determined from the pairwise comparisons performed between secukinumab regimens and placebo at the appropriate analysis visits.

 9.5.3  Safet
y variables 
Adverse events 
Treatment emergent AEs (events that started after the first dose of study treatment or events 
present prior to the first dose of study treatment but increased in severity based on preferred 
term) will be summarized up to 12 weeks (84 days) after the last dose. 
AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_1601], for each treatment group, the number and percentage 
of subjects having any AE, having an AE in each primary system organ class and having each individual AE (preferred term). Summaries will also be presented for AEs by  [CONTACT_109056]. If a subject reported more than one AE with the same preferred term, the AE with the greatest severity will be presented. If a subject reported more than one AE within the same primary system organ class, the subject will be counted only once with the greatest severity at the system organ class level, where applicable. SAEs will also be summarized.  
These summaries may be presented separately by [CONTACT_250367].  
As appropriate, the incidence of AEs will be presented per [ADDRESS_304318] years of exposure.  Separate summaries will be provided for death, SAE, other significant AEs leading to 
discontinuation and AEs leading to dose adjustment (including study treatment discontinuation). 
A graphical display of relative fr equencies within system organ classes and relative risks, as 
appropriate, will be presented. When adjudication is required of major cardiovascular events, a summary of those types of 
events as reported by [CONTACT_250368]. 

[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 97  
Clinical Trial Protocol v02 Clean   Protocol No. CAIN457F2342 
 
 Laboratory data  
The summary of laboratory evaluations will be presented for three groups of laboratory tests 
(hematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis). Descriptive summary statistics for the change from baseline to each study visit will be  presented. These descriptive summaries will be 
presented by [CONTACT_109057], laboratory test and treatment group. Change from baseline will only be summarized for subjects with both BSL and post- BSL.  
For each parameter, the maximum change from baseline withi n each study period will be 
evaluated analogously.  
In addition, shift tables will be provided for all parameters to compare a subject’s BSL laboratory evaluation relative to the visit’s observed value. For the shift tables, the normal laboratory ranges will be used to evaluate whether a particular laboratory test value was normal, low, or high for each visit value relative to whether or not the BSL value was normal, low, or high. These summaries will be presented by [CONTACT_109058]. Shi fts will be 
presented by [CONTACT_250369] - BSL.  
Vital signs  
Analysis of the vital sign measurements using summary statistics for the change from baseline for each post - BSL visit will be performed. These descriptive summaries will be presented by 
[CONTACT_37297]. Change  from baseline will only be summarized for subjects with 
both BSL and post- BSL values.  
ECG  
Summary statistics will be presented for ECG variables by [CONTACT_3232]. Qualitative changes will be summarized.  
9.5.[ADDRESS_304319] completed the Week 52 assessments  and may be used for regulatory submission and/or 
publication purposes . The final analysis will be conducted after all subjects complete the study. 
Additional analyses may be performed to support interactions with health authorities, as necessary.   
9.7 Sample size calculation  
A 5% two -sided type I error rate will be used to control for type I error. Three secukinumab 
regimens will be tested versus placebo with respect to the primary endpoint (ACR20 response), thus the type -I-error will be split to 1.67% two -sided for each comparison. Sample sizes will be 
based on this type I error assumption. With an assumed placebo rate of 15% and secukinumab 51% (FUTURE 2), the study is over 99% powered to detect a treatment difference of ACR20 in the FAS population, assuming 220 subjects in a secukinumab treatment group, and 330 subjects in the placebo group (Fisher’s exact test, nQuery 7.0). This power is applicable for all three dose regimens, as the sample size is driven by [CONTACT_250370]. 
Power for secondary variables was calculated using a two -sided 1.67% type I error. With an 
assumed placebo rate of 7% and  secukinumab 35% (FUTURE 2), the study is over 99% 
powered to detect a treatment difference of ACR50 in the full FAS population, assuming 220 
subjects in a secukinumab treatment group, and 330 subjects in the placebo group (Fisher’s exact test, nQuery 7.0).  
For structural endpoint, historical data (FUTURE 1) showed a standard deviation of 1.132 on 
active treatment and 2.435 on placebo at Week 24, and a difference of 0.52. Using the above 

[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 101  
Clinical Trial Protocol v02 Clean   Protocol No. CAIN457F2342 
 
 assumptions, there is 83% power to show statistically significant differences assuming 220 
subjects in a secukinumab group and 330 subjects in the placebo group (Satterthwaite t -test, 
nQuery 7.0). 
A standard deviation of approximately 0.49 and a treatment difference of 0.17 has been 
observed for the change from baseline at Week 24 in HAQ -DI© (FUTURE 2). Using those 
assumptions, the study has approximately 94% power to detect a difference between secukinumab and placebo (Two group t -test, nQuery Advisor 7.0), assuming [ADDRESS_304320] dactylitis at BSL, with an 
assumed placebo rate of 85% and secukinumab 50% (FUTURE 2), there is about 99% power 
to show statistically significant difference between secukinumab (110) and placebo (165 subjects), assuming 50% subject  have dactylitis at BSL (Fisher’s exact test, nQuery 7.0). 
For the presence of enthesitis in the subset of subject  who have enthesitis at BSL, with an 
assumed placebo rate of 79% and secukinumab 58% (FUTURE 2), there is about 94% power to show statistically significant difference between secukinum ab (132 subjects) and placebo 
(198 subjects), assuming 60% subject s have enthesitis at BSL (Fisher’s exact test, nQuery 7.0).  
With an assumed placebo rate of 16% and secukinumab 48% (FUTURE 2), the study is over 99% powered to detect a treatment differenc e of PASI75 in the FAS population, assuming 110 
subjects in a secukinumab treatment group, and 165 subjects in the placebo group. It is assumed that about 50% of enrolled subject s have ≥3% skin involvement.  
A difference of 0.[ADDRESS_304321] deviation of 1.04 has been observed for the change from baseline in DAS28- CRP (FUTURE 2). With these assumptions, the study has over 99% power 
to detect a difference between secukinumab and placebo (Two group t -test, nQuery Advisor 
7.0), assuming 220 subjects in a secukinumab treatment group, and 330 subjects in the placebo group. 
With an assumed placebo rate of 9% and secukinumab 33% (FUTURE 2), the study is over 
99% powered to detect a treatment difference of PASI90 in the FAS population, assuming 110 subjects in a secukinumab treatment group, and 165 subjects in the placebo group. It is assumed that about 50% of enrolled subject s have ≥3% skin involvement. 
10 Ethical considerations

Clinical Trial Protocol v02 Clean   Protocol No. CAIN457F2342 
 
 (IRB /IEC) -approved informed consent, or, if incapable of doing so, after such consent has been 
provided by a legally acceptable representative of the subject. In cases where the subject’s 
representative gives consent, the subject should be informed about the study to the extent possible given his/her understanding. If the subject is capable of doing so, he/she should indicate assent by [CONTACT_90218] a separate assent form. Informed consent must be obtained before conducting any study -specific 
procedures (i.e. all of the procedures described in the protocol). The process of obtaining informed consent should be documented in the subject source documents. 
[COMPANY_001] will provide to investigators in a separate document a proposed informed consent form 
that complies with the ICH GCP guideline and regulatory requirements and is considered appropriate for this study. Any changes to the proposed consent form suggested by [CONTACT_187895]/IEC, and a copy of the 
approved version must be provided to the [COMPANY_001] monitor after IRB/IEC approval. 
Women of child bearing potential should be informed that taking the study treatment may 
involve unknown risks to the fetus if pregnancy were to occur during the study and agree that in order to participate in the study they must adhere to the contraception requirement for the duration of the study, and for minimum 16 weeks or longer if local label requires it (e.g. 20 weeks in EU) after the last dose. If there is any question that the subject will not reliably comply, 
they should not be entered in the study. 
   
 
 
 
10.3 Responsibilities of the investigator and IRB/IEC

 13 Appendix 1: The classification criteria for psoriatic arthritis 
(CASPAR)  
To meet the Classification of Psoriatic Arthritis (CASPAR) criteria for diagnosis of psoriatic 
arthritis according to ( Taylor 2006), a subject must have inflammatory articular disease (joint, 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_146251]) and at least 3 points from the following 5 categories: 
1. Evidence of current psoriasis, a personal history of psoriasis, or a family history of 
psoriasis  
• Current psoriasis is defined as psoriatic skin or scalp disease present today as judged by a rheumatologist or dermatologist.* ( 2 points ) 
• A personal history of psoriasis is defined as a history of psoriasis that may be obtained from a patient, family physician, dermatologist, rheumatologist, or other qualified health care provider. ( 1 points ) 
• A family history o f psoriasis is defined as a history of psoriasis in a first - or second - 
degree relative according to patient report. ( 1 points ) 
2. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_250320], pi[INVESTIGATOR_22940], and hyperkeratosis observed on current physical examination ( 1 point ) 
3. A negative test result for the presence of rheumatoid factor by [CONTACT_250372] ( 1 
point ) 
4. Either current dactylitis, defined as swelling of an entire digit, or a history of dactylitis recorded by a rheumatologist ( 1 point ) 
5. Radiographic evide nce of juxta -articular new bone formation appearing as ill -defined 
ossification near joint margins (but excluding osteophyte formation) on plain radiographs of the hand or foot ( 1 point ) 
Total score:  
(The CASPAR criteria eCRF will autopopulate the total n umber of points of the CASPAR 
criteria met by [CONTACT_423]. If the total score ≥ 3, the subject meets CASPAR criteria for PsA diagnosis.) 
* Current psoriasis is assigned a score of 2; all other features are assigned a score of 1

Clinical Trial Protocol v02 Clean   Protocol No. CAIN457F2342 
 
 14 Appendix 2: Guidelines for a dministering the questionnaires 
for patient reported outcomes  
Before trial start  
Study coordinators should familiarize themselves with the PRO questionnaire(s) in the trial and identify any items where a patient’s response might highlight issues of potential concern. 
At BSL, BSA involvement with psoriasis should be determined before completing PRO questionnaire(s) to ensure that DLQI is completed only for patients who have BSA≥3%. 
For example, one question in the SF -36 asks ‘How much of the time in the past [ADDRESS_304327] 
you felt downhearted and blue?’ If a patient responds ‘most or all of the time’, then the study 
coordinator should inform the study investigator. 
Before completion  
1. Subjects should be provided with the correct questionnaire at the appropriate visits and in 
the appropriate language 
2. Subjects should have adequate space and time to complete the forms 
3. Patients should be provided with a firm writing surface (such as a table or a clip board) 
4. Questionnaire should be administered before the clinical examination  
During completion  
1. Administrator may clarify the questions but should not influence the response 
2. Only one response for each question 
3. Also see “Addressing Problems and Concerns” 
After completion 
1. Check for completeness and not for content* 
2. Data should be sent from the eCRF / electronic device 
3. Data should be reviewed by [CONTACT_250373] 
*However, any response which may directly impact or reflect the patient’s medical condition 
(e.g. noting of depression) should be communicated by [CONTACT_144978]).  
Addressing Problems and Concerns  
Occasionally a patient may have concerns or questions about the questionnaires administered. Guidance related to some of the most common concerns and questions are given below. 
The patient does not want to complete the questionnaire(s)  
Tell the patient that completion of the questionnaire(s) is voluntary. The goal is to better 
understand the physical, mental and social health problems of patients. Emphasize that such information is as important as any other medical information and that the questionnaire(s) is simple to complete. Suggest that the questionnaire(s) may be different from anything the 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page [ADDRESS_304328] 
the reason for the decline and thank the patient. 
The patient is too ill or weak to complete the questionnaire(s)  
In these instances, the coordinator may obtain patient responses by [CONTACT_90222], followed by [CONTACT_90223], and entering the patient’s 
response. No help should be provided to the patient by [CONTACT_90224]. The coordinator should not influence patient responses. The study coordinator cannot translate the question into simpler language and has to be read verbatim. 
The patient wants someone else to complete the questionnaire(s)  
In no case should the coordinator or anyone other than the patient provide responses to the 
questions. Unless specified in the study protocol, proxy data are not an acceptable substitute for 
patient self -report. Patients should be discouraged from asking a family member or friend for 
help in completing a questionnaire. 
The patient does not want to finish completing the questionnaire(s)  
If non- completion is a result of the patient having trouble understanding particular items, ask 
the patient to explain the difficulty. Re -read the question for them verbatim  but do not rephrase 
the question. If the respondent is still unable to complete the questionnaire, accept it as 
incomplete. Thank the patient. 
The patient is concerned that someone will look at his/her responses  
Emphasize that all responses are to be kept confidential. Point out that their names do not appear 
anywhere on the questionnaire, so that their results will be linked with an ID number and not their name. Tell the patient that his/her answers will be pooled with other patients’ answers and that they will be analyzed as a group rather than as individuals. Tell the patient that com pleted 
forms are not routinely shared with treating staff and that their responses will only be seen by [CONTACT_10825] (to check for completeness) and by [CONTACT_093]. Any response which may directly impact on or reflect their medical condition ( e.g. noting of se vere depression) will be 
communicated by [CONTACT_90226]. 
The patient asks the meaning of a question/item  
While completing the questionnaire, some patients might ask the meaning of specific items so 
that they can better understand and respond. If this happens, assist the patient by [CONTACT_250374]. If the patient asks to interpret the meaning of an item, do not try to 
explain it, but suggest that he/she use his/her own interpretation of the question. Patients should  
answer the questions based on what they think the questions mean. 
A General Information about all questionnaire(s):  
All questionnaires have to be completed by [CONTACT_250375]. The questionnaires should be c ompleted by [CONTACT_90227] a quiet area free 
from disturbance, and before any visit assessments. Patients should receive no help from family members; if questions cannot be answered alone (due to problems with reading or 
[COMPANY_001]  Confidential  Page 109  
Clinical Trial Protocol v02 Clean   Protocol No. CAIN457F2342 
 
 understanding), then the doctor or  nurse should read the questions and record the patient’s 
responses without influencing their answers. The information provided is strictly confidential 
and will be treated as such. If a patient has missed a question or given more than one response per question, then this should be brought to patient. Incomplete questions should not be accepted without first encouraging the patient to complete unanswered questions. 
The investigator must complete the patient/visit information on the electronic device and ens ure 
that the center number, patient’s number and initials are identical to the CRF. As there are no 
source data for this questionnaire, the data queries will be restricted to patient/visit information.

Measures and Criteria of Response  
Number of tender joints 
Seventy -eight joints (78) are scored as either tender or not tender: [ADDRESS_304329] carpometacarpal joints of the 
hands, 8 distal interphalangeal, the 10 metatarsophalangeal and 10 proximal interphalangeal joints of the feet, the 2 wrists, 2 elbows, 2 shoulders, 2 acromioclavicular, 2 sternoclavicular, 2 temporomandibular, 2 hip, 2 knee, 2 talo- tibial, and 2 mid -tarsal joints.  
Joint tenderness is to be scored present (1) or absent (0). 
Number of swollen joints 
Joints are to be scored as either swollen (1) or not swollen (0). The 76 joints to be examined for

A patient will be considered as improved according the ACR20 criteria* if she/he has at least 
20% improveme nt in 
• the two following measures: 
• Tender joint count 
• Swollen joint count 
• and at least 3 of the following 5 measures: 
• Patient's assessment of pain  
• Patient's global assessment of disease activity  
• Physician's global assessment of disease activity  
• Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ©) score  
• C-reactive protein (CRP)/Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR).  
ACR50 = 50% improvement in at least 3 of the 5 measures and 50% improvement in the

 17 Appendix 5: The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)  
The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their 
response to therapy. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 72. The severity of disease is calculated as follows. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head (h), trunk (t), upper extremities (u), and lower extremities (l), which account for 10%, 30%, 20% and 40% of the total BSA, respectively. Each of these areas is assessed separately for erythema, induration and desquamation (scaling), which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The scoring system for the signs of the disease (erythema, induration, and 
desquamation (scaling)) are:  
0 = none; 1= slight; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe; and 4 = very severe.  
The scale for estimating the area of involvement for psoriatic lesions is outlined below. 0 = no involvement 1 = 1% to 9% involvement 2 = 10% to 29% involvement 3 = 30% to 49% involvement 
4 = 50% to 69% involvement 
5 = 70% to 89% involvement 6 = 90% to 100% involvement 
To help with the area assessments, the following conventions should be noted: 
• the neck is considered part of the head 
• the axillae and groin are part of the trunk 
• the buttocks are part of the lower extremities  
The PASI formula is: 
PASI = 0.1 (Eh + Ih + Dh) Ah + 0.3 (Et +It+ Dt) At+ 0.2 (Eu + Iu + Du) Au+ 
0.4 (El +II+ Dl) AI (where E= erythema, I = induration, D = desquamation and A = area)

b. Generate an average score for the erythema, thickness, and scale for each of the 4 areas (0=clear, 1-
4=increasing severity).  
c. Sum scores of erythema, thickness, and scale for each of the 4 area.

 d. Generate a percentage for skin covered with psoriasis for each area and convert that to a 0 -6 scale. ‡ 
e. Multiply score of item c above times item d above for each area and multiply that by 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 
0.4 for head, arms, trunk,  and legs, respectively.  
f. Add these scores to get the PASI score.

1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Disease Background  
 
1.1.1   Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer  
 Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is an undifferentiated tumor of thyroidal follicular epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130]. 
Although not as common as differentiated thyroid cancers, ATC has much higher di sease 
specific mortality, approaching 100% [1]. In fact, despi[INVESTIGATOR_734244] 5% of all 
thyroid cancer diagnoses, ATC leads to more than half of the 1200 deaths from thyroid 
cancer every year in the [LOCATION_002] [2, 3].  
 
 Forty six percent of patients present with distant metastases, and almost 70% demonstrate 
metastases at some stage of the disease [3]. All staging for anaplastic thyroid cancer is as 
stage IV [3], given its aggressive nature and propensity for metastasis. Even with the most 
aggressive existing mult imodality therapy involving surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, 
most patients do not derive consistent, sustained benefit in outcomes and survival. Median 
overall survival remains 3 -4 months, with 90% of patients dead at 1 year from diagnosis [3]. 
Patients often suffer from distant metastases even after local therapy is completed, 
demonstrating the inadequacy of treatment. Lung, brain and bone metastases are common 
as well as significant  airway compromise and suffocation even after tracheostomy.  
 
1.1.2   Treatment for Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer -Chemotherapy  
Doxorubicin is the only approved chemotherapy for anaplastic thyroid cancer [4], and is 
often combined with radiation or surgery as part of multi -modality therapy. No randomized 
trial has demonstrated improved statistically significant survival or better quality of life in 
patients treated with any current therapy [4]. 
 
 Given the poor p rognosis, guidelines from the American Thyroid Association as well as the 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommend all patients should be treated as part 
of a clinical trial regardless of stage [4, 5].  
 
 This treatment protocol aims to offer a new therapy for patients with anaplastic thyroid 
cancer who would otherwise have very poor treatment options and outcome.  
 
1.1.[ADDRESS_1003363] been 
approved for any stage of therapy for patients in the US. Fosbretabulin is a novel tubulin 
binding compound that demonstrated activity in ATC [6]. A Phase III trial randomized ATC 
patients to fosbretabulin or placebo. These  patients had previously received carbopl atin and 
paclitaxel treatment and 55% of them had undergone surgical resection [7]. The arm 
containing the experimental drug had 33.3% survival at one year vs 7% for the carboplatin 
and paclitaxel alone arm. Although no t powered to detect differences in survival, the median 
survival for the standard arm was reported as 4 months for the control arm versus 8.4 
months for the fosbretabulin arm.

10   
 Sorafenib has demonstrated some activity in multi -institution, small studies. I n 20 patients 
treated with sorafenib, 2 patients demonstrated a partial response [8]. Sorafenib is currently 
not listed as a recommended regimen in the NCCN guideli nes for anaplastic thyroid cancer, 
nor in the ATA guidelines for Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer.  
  
Clinical trials for this disease are also extremely rare, leaving patients with very limited 
treatment options. Patients diagnosed with anaplastic thyroid cancer  have a very high 
likelihood of dying because of their disease. As such there is a clear need for improving 
therapy for anaplastic thyroid cancer.  
 
1.1.4  Immune checkpoints in cancer  
Cancer cells can evade destruction by [CONTACT_27639], and can gain the abili ty to 
circumvent the usual immune checkpoints [9, 10]. The programmed death 1 (PD -1) 
receptor and its ligands appear to play a role in the tumor cells evading immune -
mediated destruction. PD -1 is an immunoinhibitory receptor that is expressed on B/T 
cells, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, monocytes and NK cells [11].  
 
The binding of PD -1 to one of its ligands PD -L1 or PD -L2 results in inhibition of cytotoxic 
T-cell responses [12]. Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody against PD -1 which 
disrupts ligand binding and T cell inhibitory signals, resulting in increased tumor 
recognition by [CONTACT_28746] T -cells[13]. 
 
Higher levels of PD -L1 are associated with an increased response rate of lung cancer to 
anti-PD-1 therapy [13]. PD-L1 overexpression is associated with more aggressive 
disease in papi[INVESTIGATOR_734245] [14], but has not been similarly evaluated in anaplastic 
thyroid cancer. In a small series, PD -L1 expression was seen in 3 out of 13 anaplastic 
thyroid cancer patients [15], though wheth er this represents the true frequency of PD -L1 
overexpression is unknown. It is also unknown whether PD -L1 expression correlates with 
response to anti -PD-1 agents in thyroid cancer.  
 
1.1.5  Molecular abnormalities in anaplastic thyroid cancer  
The frequency of mut ations in anaplastic thyroid cancer/undifferentiated thyroid cancer is 
not well -defined. The impact of mutations in ATC may be to alter its natural history and 
may also be associated with differential responses to immune based therapy.  
 
Experiments have be en done to determine the genetic drivers of malignancy in aggressive 
thyroid cancer. In anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) collected from patient samples, 
mutations in the kinase domain of ALK have been characterized in 11% [16]. In this study 
of ATC, two exons in the tyrosine kinase domain were sequenced and novel mutations 
were found in both exon [ADDRESS_1003364] as well as high 
phosphorylation levels of Akt and ERK, suggesting that they contributed to malignant 
behavior. The se novel ALK mutations were transfected into wild type ALK cells, and 
stimulated cell transformation and invasion as possible mechanism of malignancy, the 
frequency of ALK mutations was 11%.  
 
In one 71 year old patient with anaplastic thyroid cancer, ALK overexpression was seen 
[17]. Further analysis demonstrated the presence of a rearrangement and the patient was 
treated with the ALK-inhibitor crizotinib. This resulted in a dramatic response and reduction 
of the lung metastases by 90%.  
 
Other abnormalities have been reported and sporadically targeted in anaplastic thyroid 
cancer. These include braf which is found in 14 -25% of anaplastic thyroid cancer [18, 19].

Protocol Version 3.0 , September 28, 2019  
11   
 This has also been associated with dramatic responses to targeted therapy in one case 
report. These anecdotal resu lts remain to be confirmed in larger studies.  
 
Other mutations commonly found in ATC include PI3KCA (24%), PTEN (16%), RAS 
(60%) and TP53 (48%) [20]. 
 
Molecular testing is commonly performed in anaplastic thyroid cancer using commercial 
tests such as FoundationOne and Caris. In cases where these results are available, they 
will be collected to determine if there is any correlation between mutations and 
responses.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Concept  
The goal of this multi -center, open -label trial is to measure the impact of treating metastatic 
anaplastic thyroid cancer patients with immune checkpoint therapy. This trial will potentially 
lead to the  development of new therapy for anaplastic thyroid cancer. The drug to be 
administered, pembrolizumab is FDA approved with known side effects and is active in 
many tumor types.  
 
PD-1/PD -L1 expression will be measured and reported for patients undergoing th erapy 
with pembrolizumab. This will help determine if there PD -1 or PD -L1 are predictive 
biomarkers for anti -PD-1 therapy. It will also add to the data regarding their frequency in 
aggressive thyroid cancer. Where available, genomic profiling data will be analyzed to 
determine if there is a correlation between response and mutational status.  
 
 
1.2 Study Agent(s) Background and Associated Known Toxicities  
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB)/approved labeling for detailed background 
information on pembroliz umab (MK -3475).  
 
1.2.[ADDRESS_1003365] immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformation has been known for decades.  Accumulating evidence shows a correlation 
between tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in 
various malignancies.  In particular, the presence of CD8+ T -cells and the ratio of CD8+ 
effector T -cells / FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells seems to correlate with improved prognosis 
and long -term su rvival in many solid tumors.  
 
The PD -[ADDRESS_1003366] hijacked by [CONTACT_55548].  The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated 
T-cells under healthy conditions, is to down -modulate unwanted or excessive immune 
responses, including autoimmune reactions.  PD -1 (encoded by [CONTACT_13228]1) is an Ig 
superfamily member related to CD28 and CTLA -4 which has been shown to negatively 
regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engag ement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD -L2).  
The structure of murine PD -1 has been resolved.  PD -1 and family members are type I 
transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig Variable -type (V -type) domain responsible 
for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail  which is responsible for the binding of signaling 
molecules.  The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 tyrosine -based signaling motifs, an 
immunoreceptor tyrosine -based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine -
based switch motif (ITSM).  Foll owing T -cell stimulation, PD -[ADDRESS_1003367] from that of CTLA -4 as both molecules 
regulate an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_77971].  PD -1 was shown to be expressed on 
activated lymphocytes includin g peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells, B -cells, T regs and

 Natural Killer cells.  Expression has also been shown during thymic development on CD4 -
CD8- (double negative) T -cells as well as subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells.  The 
ligands for PD -1 (PD -L1 and PD -L2) are constitutively expressed or can be induced in a 
variety of cell types, including non -hematopoietic tissues as well as in various tumors.  Both 
ligands are type I transmembrane receptors containing both IgV - and IgC -like domains in 
the extr acellular region and contain short cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling 
motifs.  Binding of either PD -[ADDRESS_1003368] notably on vascular endothelium, whereas PD -L2 protein is only detectably 
expressed on antigen -presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory 
environments.  PD -L2 is thought to control immune T -cell activation in lymphoid or gans, 
whereas PD -L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T -cell function in peripheral tissues.  
Although healthy organs express little (if any) PD -L1, a variety of cancers were 
demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T -cell inhibitor.  PD -1 has been sugge sted 
to regulate tumor -specific T -cell expansion in subjects with melanoma (MEL).  This 
suggests that the PD -1/PD -L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune evasion and 
should be considered as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.  
 
Pembr olizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) of 
the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction between PD -1 and its 
ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2.  KeytrudaTM (pembrolizumab) has recently been approved in 
the United Stated for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma 
and disease progression following ipi[INVESTIGATOR_734246], if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a 
BRAF inhibitor.  
 
1.2.2  Preclinical and Clinical Trial Data  
Refer to the Investigator’s Brochu re for Preclinical and Clinical data.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_1003369] been proven to do so. There are no treatment options that prolong surviv al, 
and as a result new agents are desperately needed.  
 
The identification of immune checkpoint inhibitors has transformed the treatment 
landscape in many different cancers. Where previously there were no good treatment 
options such as melanoma, immune th erapy has dramatically altered the outcomes for 
patients [21].  
 
A similar change in outcomes is needed in anaplastic thyroid cancer. The relatively broad 
range of tumor types in which pembrolizumab has shown benefit (breast [22], lymphoma 
[23], urothelial cancer [24], head and neck cancer [25] as well as others) suggests that 
aggressive thyroid cancer may also be sensitive to this therapy. The prevalence of PD -L1 
overexpression in anaplastic thyroid cancer suggests that for a subset of patients, there 
may be a dramatic improvement in outcomes. However the paucity of viable alternative 
treatments means that even modest improveme nts in PD -L1 low cancers may still have a 
meaningful impact on patients’ lives.  
 
The currently available data does not justify a large randomized study evaluating the 
impact of pembrolizumab in anaplastic thyroid cancer. If a promising signal of 
pembrolizumab activity is identified after this initial study; a larger trial is planned to 
SCCC -[ADDRESS_1003370] of pembrolizumab in this 
disease.  
1.4 Rationale  for Dose Selection/Regimen/Modification  
An open -label Phase I trial (Protocol 001) is being conducted to evaluate the safety and 
clinical activity of single agent MK -3475.  The dose escalation portion of this trial 
evaluated three dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 
weeks (Q2W) in subj ects with advanced solid tumors.  All three dose levels were well 
tolerated and no dose -limiting toxicities were observed.  This first in human study of MK -
3475 showed evidence of target engagement and objective evidence of tumor size 
reduction at all dose  levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q2W).  No MTD has been 
identified to date.  10.0 mg/kg Q2W, the highest dose tested in PN001, will be the dose 
and schedule utilized in Cohorts A, B, C and D of this protocol to test for initial tumor 
activity.  Recen t data from other clinical studies within the MK -3475 program has shown 
that a lower dose of MK -3475 and a less frequent schedule may be sufficient for target 
engagement and clinical activity.  
 
PK data analysis of MK -3475 administered Q2W and Q3W showed slow systemic 
clearance, limited volume of distribution, and a long half -life (refer to IB).  
Pharmacodynamic data (IL -2 release assay) suggested that peripheral target 
engagement is durable (>21 days).  This early PK and pharmacodynamic data provides 
scientific rationale for testing a Q2W and Q3W dosing schedule.   
 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed using serum concentration 
time data from [ADDRESS_1003371] a wide therapeutic range based on the melanoma indication.  The differences in 
exposure for a 200 mg fixed dose regimen relative to a 2 mg/k g Q3W body weight based 
regimen are anticipated to remain well within the established exposure margins of 0.5 – 
5.0 for MK -3475 in the melanoma indication. The exposure margins are based on the 
notion of similar efficacy and safety in melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. the proposed 
dose regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W (i.e. 5 -fold higher dose and exposure). The population PK 
evaluation revealed that there was no significant impact of tumor burden on exposure. In 
addition, exposure was similar between the NSCLC and melanom a indications. 
Therefore, there are no anticipated changes in exposure between different indication 
settings.  
 
The rationale for further exploration of 2 mg/kg and comparable doses of pembrolizumab 
in solid tumors is based on: 1) similar efficacy and safet y of pembrolizumab when dosed 
at either 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg Q3W in melanoma patients, 2) the flat exposure -response 
relationships of pembrolizumab for both efficacy and safety in the dose ranges of 2 mg/kg 
Q3W to 10 mg/kg Q3W, 3) the lack of effect of tumo r burden or indication on distribution 
behavior of pembrolizumab (as assessed by [CONTACT_78013]) and 4) the 
assumption that the dynamics of pembrolizumab target engagement will not vary 
meaningfully with tumor type.  
 
The choice of the 200 mg Q3W a s an appropriate dose for the switch to fixed dosing is 
based on simulations performed using the population PK model of pembrolizumab showing 
that the fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optimally 
consistent with those obt ained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will maintain 
individual patient exposures in the exposure range established in melanoma as associated 
with maximal efficacy response and 3) will maintain individual patients exposure in the 
exposure range esta blished in melanoma that are well tolerated and safe.

A fixed dose regimen will simplify the dosing regimen to be more convenient for physicians 
and to reduce potential for dosing errors.  A fixed dosing scheme will also reduce 
complexity in the logistic al chain at treatment facilities and reduce wastage.  
 
1.5 Correlative Studies  
The diagnosis of anaplastic thyroid cancer is often delayed due to it being a rare 
diagnosis and one without clear pathognomonic pathologic findings. Tissue from patients 
who are enr olled on to this study will be reviewed at UT Southwestern medical center 
pathology by a pathologic specialized in endocrine neoplasia. Central review and 
confirmation of the diagnosis will not be a prerequisite for study eligibility.  
 
Additionally tissue will be tested for PD -L1 expression, as well as other potential 
biomarkers predictive of disease response to the study agent. In studies in squamous 
lung cancer, high PD -L1 expression was associated with an enhanced improved 
outcomes with pembrolizumab the rapy[13].

4.1.1  Dose Selection  
The rationale for selection of doses to be used in this trial is provided in Section 1.4 – 
Background and Rationale.   
4.2 Toxicities and Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications  
Any subject who receives treatment on this protocol will be evaluable for toxicity. Each p atient 
will be assessed for the development of toxicity according to the Time and Events table 
(Table 3). Toxicity will be assessed according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Dose adjustments should be made accor ding to the 
system showing the greatest degree of toxicity.  
 
Adverse events (both non -serious and serious) associated with pembrolizumab exposure may 
represent an immunologic etiology.  These adverse events may occur shortly after the first 
dose or severa l months after the last dose of treatment. Pembrolizumab must be withheld for 
drug-related toxicities and severe or life -threatening AEs as per Table [ADDRESS_1003386] Guidance Document for supportive care guideline s, 
including use of corticosteroids.

Dosing interruptions are permitted in the case of medical / surgical events or logistical reasons not 
related to study therapy (e.g., elective surgery, unrelated medical events, patient vacation, and/or 
holidays). Subjects should be placed back on study therapy within 3 weeks of the scheduled 
interrupt ion, unless otherwise discussed with the Sponsor. The reason for interruption should be 
documented in the patient's study record . 
4.2.1  Timing of Dose Administration  
Trial treatment should be administered on Day 1 of each cycle after all 
procedures/assessments h ave been completed as detailed on the Trial Flow Chart (Section 
SCCC -[ZIP_CODE]  
________________________________________________________________________

 6.0).  Trial treatment may be administered up to 3 days before or after the scheduled Day 1 of 
each cycle due to administrative reasons.  
 
All trial treatments will be administered on an outpat ient basis.  
 
Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered as a 30 minute IV infusion every 3 weeks.  Sites 
should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible.  
However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site  to site, a window of -5 minutes and 
+10 minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes: -5 min/+10 min).  
 
4.2.2  Trial Blinding/Masking  
This is an open -label trial; therefore, the Sponsor, investigator and subject will know the 
treatment administered.  
 
4.3 Concomitant Medications/Treatments  
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed 
during the ongoing trial.  If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications 
or vaccinations specifically  prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from trial therapy or 
vaccination may be required.  The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this 
with the [COMPANY_006] Clinical team.  The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination 
rests with the investigator and/or the subject's primary physician.

administered at the discretion of the investigator in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_734247] e community standards of 
medical care.  All concomitant medication will be recorded on the case report form (CRF) 
including all prescription, over -the-counter (OTC), herbal supplements, and IV medications 
Duration of Therapy  and fluids.  If changes occur d uring the trial period, documentation of drug 
dosage, frequency, route, and date may also be included on the CRF.  
 
All concomitant medications received within [ADDRESS_1003393] dose of trial treatment should be recorded for SAEs 
and ECIs as defined in Section 7.2.  
 
4.3.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
Subjects are prohibited from receivi ng the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_130970] (including retreatment for post -complete response relapse) of this trial:  
 
 Antineoplastic systemic chemotherapy or biological therapy  
 Immunotherapy not specified in this protocol  
 Chemothe rapy not specified in this protocol  
 Investigational agents other than pembrolizumab  
 Radiation therapy   
o Note:  Radiation therapy to a symptomatic solitary lesion or to the brain may be allowed 
at the investigator’s discretion.   
 Live vaccines within [ADDRESS_1003394] dose of trial treatment and while participating in 
the trial.   Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, 
mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, a nd typhoid vaccine.  
 Systemic glucocorticoids for any purpose other than to modulate symptoms from an event of 
clinical interest of suspected immunologic etiology.  The use of physiologic doses of 
corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with the  Sponsor.  
 
SCCC -[ADDRESS_1003395] -Treatment Follow -up Phase.  
 
a. Rescue Medications & Supportive Care  
i. Supportive Care Guidelines  
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_124133].  Suggested supportive care measures for the management of adverse events with 
potential immunologic etiology are outlined below and in greater de tail in the ECI guidance document. 
Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use of oral or intravenous treatment with 
corticosteroids as well as additional anti -inflammatory agents if symptoms do not improve with 
administration of corticosteroids.   Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as 
symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is decreased. For each disorder, attempts should be 
made to rule out other causes such as metastatic disease or bacterial or viral infection, which  might 
require additional supportive care. The treatment guidelines are intended to be applied when the 
investigator determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab.  
 
Note: if after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the investigator is instructed to 
follow the ECI reporting guidance but does not need to follow the treatment guidance (as outlined in 
the ECI guidance document). Refer to Section 5.2 .1 for dose modification.  
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin 
photography as part of evaluation of the event. Suggested conditional procedures, as appropriate, can 
be found in the ECI guidance doc ument.  
 Pneumonitis :  
o For Grade 2 events , treat with systemic corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to 
Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over no less than 4 
weeks.  
o For Grade 3 -4 events , immediately treat with intravenous steroi ds.  Administer 
additional anti -inflammatory measures, as needed.  
o Add prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections in the case of prolonged steroid 
administration.  
 
 Diarrhea/Colitis :  
Subjects should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms o f enterocolitis (such as 
diarrhea, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel 
perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus).   
o All subjects who experience diarrhea/colitis should be advised to drink liberal quantities 
of clear fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and electrolytes should 
be substituted via IV infusion.  For Grade 2 or higher diarrhea, consider GI consultation 
and endoscopy to confirm or rule out colitis.  
o For Grade 2 diarrhea/col itis that persists greater than 3 days, administer oral 
corticosteroids.  
o For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis  that persists > 1 week, treat with intravenous 
steroids followed by [CONTACT_78018].   
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid tap er should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
 
 Type 1 diabetes mellitus (if new onset, including diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]) or ≥ Grade 
3 Hyperglycemia, if associated with ketosis (ketonuria) or metabolic acidosis (DKA)

 o For T1DM  or Grade 3 -4 Hyperglycemia  
 Insulin replacement therapy is recommended for Type I diabetes mellitus and 
for Grade 3 -4 hyperglycemia associated with metabolic acidosis or ketonuria.  
 Evaluate patients with serum glucose and a metabolic panel, urine ketones, 
glycosylated hemoglobin, and C -peptide.  
 
 Hypophysitis : 
o For Grade 2  events, treat with corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or 
less, steroid taper should be started and  continued over no less than 4 weeks. 
Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
o For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroids followed by [CONTACT_79918]. When symptoms improve to Grad e 1 or less, steroid taper should be 
started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate 
hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
 
 Hyperthyroidism or Hypothyroidism :  
Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during tr eatment. Monitor patients for changes in 
thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically during treatment, and as indicated based 
on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyroid disorders.  
o Grade 2  hyperthyroidism events (an d Grade 2 -4 hypothyroidism):  
 In hyperthyroidism, non -selective beta -blockers (e.g. propranolol) are 
suggested as initial therapy.  
 In hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone replacement therapy, with levothyroxine 
or liothyroinine, is indicated per standard of care . 
o Grade 3 -4 hyperthyroidism  
 Treat with an initial dose of IV corticosteroid followed by [CONTACT_78019]. 
When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started 
and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate 
hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.  
 
 Hepatic : 
o For Grade 2  events, monitor liver function tests more frequently until returned to 
baseline values (consider weekly).  
 Treat with IV or oral corticosteroids  
o For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with intravenous corticosteroids for 24 to 48 hours.  
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, a steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
 
 Renal Failure or Nephritis : 
o For Grade 2  events, treat with corticosteroids.  
o For Grade 3 -4 events, treat with systemic corticosteroids.  
o When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
 
 Management of Infusion Reactions : Signs and  symptoms usually develop during or shortly 
after drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion.

 feeding women may be enrolled if they are willing to use 2 metho ds of birth control or are considered 
highly unlikely to conceive.  Highly unlikely to conceive is defined as 1) surgically sterilized, or 2) 
postmenopausal (a woman who is ≥45 years of age and has not had menses for greater than 1 year 
will be considered postmenopausal), or 3) not heterosexually active for the duration of the study.  The 
two birth control methods can be either two barrier methods or a barrier method plus a hormonal method 
to prevent pregnancy. Subjects should start using birth control from  study Visit [ADDRESS_1003398] dose of study therapy.  
The following are considered adequate barrier methods of contraception: diaphragm, condom (by [CONTACT_47446]), copper intrauterine device, sponge, or spermicide.  Appropriate hormonal contraceptives will 
include any registered and marketed contraceptive agent that contains an estrogen and/or a 
progestational agent (including oral, subcutaneous, intrauterine, or intramuscular agents).  
Subjects should be informed tha t taking the study medication may involve unknown risks to the fetus 
(unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study.  In order to participate in the study they 
must adhere  to the contraception requirement (described above) for the duration of  the study and during 
the follow -up period defined in section 7.2.[ADDRESS_1003399]’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated.  The outcome 
of the pregnancy will be reported to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006] without delay and within 24 hours to 
the Sponsor and within 2 working days to [COMPANY_006] if the outcome is a seri ous adverse experience (e.g., 
death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life -threatening complication to the mother 
or newborn).   
 
The study investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of the 
pregnancy a nd report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the Sponsor.   If a male subject 
impregnates his female partner the study personnel at the site must be informed immediately and the 
pregnancy reported to the Sponsor and to [COMPANY_006] and followed as described  above and in Section 7.2.2.  
4.4.[ADDRESS_1003400] Withdrawal/Discontinuation Criteria  
Subjects may withdraw consent at any time for any reason or be dropped from the trial at the 
discretion of the investigator should any untoward effect occur.  I n addition, a subject may be 
withdrawn by [CONTACT_80074], the trial plan 
is violated, or for administrative and/or other safety reasons.  Specific details regarding 
discontinuation or withdrawa l are provided in Section 7.1.4 – Other Procedures.  
 
A subject must be discontinued from the trial for any of the following reasons:  
 
 The subject or legal representative (such as a parent or legal guardian) withdraws consent.  
 Confirmed radiographic disease  progression  
Note : For unconfirmed radiographic disease progression,

5.3 Trial Procedures  
The Trial Flow Chart - Section 6.0 summarizes the trial procedures to be performed at each 
visit.  Individual trial procedures are described in detail below.  It may be necessary to 
perform these procedures at unscheduled time points if deemed clinically necessary by [CONTACT_1275].  
Furth ermore, additional evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by [CONTACT_1052]/or 
[COMPANY_006] for reasons related to subject safety. In some cases, such evaluation/testing may be 
potentially sensitive in nature (e.g., HIV, Hepatitis C, etc.), and thus local r egulations may 
require that additional informed consent be obtained from the subject.  In these cases, such 
evaluations/testing will be performed in accordance with those regulations.  
 
5.3.1  Screening/Baseline  
Screening assessments to confirm eligibility will be  performed as per the schedule of  
assessments. Documented Informed consent must be obtained before any study specific 
procedure will be performed. After meeting all the eligibility criteria, patients must sign a 
consent form for therapeutic portion of the trial.  
 
For the therapeutic portion of the trial, the patient must meet the remainder of the eligibility 
criteria. This must be done at the treating center and all study required testing must be 
completed within the 30 day period prior to day of initiatin g therapy.  
 
Re-screening of patients will be allowed, if all entry criteria are met during the re -screening 
phase time period ( -30 days to -1 day).  
 
5.3.2  Administrative Procedures  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Informed Consent

acceptable representative’s dated signature [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a consent form along with the dat ed signature 
[CONTACT_63564].  
 
A copy of the signed and dated consent form should be given to the subject before 
participation in the trial.  
 
The initial informed consent form, any subsequent revised written informed consen t form and 
any written information provided to the subject must receive the IRB/ERC’s 
approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_19349].  The subject or his/her legally acceptable 
representative should be informed in a timely manner if new information becomes a vailable 
that may be relevant to the subject’s willingness to continue participation in the trial.  The 
communication of this information will be provided and documented via a revised consent 
form or addendum to the original consent form that captures the subject’s dated signature [CONTACT_90096] [CONTACT_423]’s legally acceptable representative’s dated signature.  
 
Specifics about a trial and the trial population will be added to the consent form template at 
the protocol level.   
 
The informed consent will adhere to IR B/ERC requirements, applicable laws and regulations 
and Sponsor requirements.

6.[ADDRESS_1003429] - Solid Tumors  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria 
proposed by [CONTACT_8225] (RECIST) Committee [ JNCI  
92(3):205 -216, 2000]. Changes in only the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of 
the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_1003430] their 
response classified according to the definitions stated below. (Note: Subjects who exhibit 
objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.)  
 
6.1.[ADDRESS_1003431] one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >20 mm with 
conventional techniques (CT, MRI, x -ray) or as >[ADDRESS_1003432] b e recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
  Note: Previously irradiated lesions are non -measurable except in cases of documented 
progression of the lesion since the completion of radiation therapy.  
 
Non-measurable disease . All other  lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <20 mm with conventional techniques or <[ADDRESS_1003433] scan), 
are considered non -measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusio ns, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, 
abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), and cystic lesions are all non -measurable.  
 
Target lesions. All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 3 lesions per organ and 6 lesions 
in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and 
recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their 
size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeate d 
measurements (either by [CONTACT_14217]). A sum of the longest diameter 
(LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD. The 
baseline sum LD will be used as reference by [CONTACT_734261].  
 
Non-target lesions . All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions 
over and above the [ADDRESS_1003434] of a treatment.  
 
Provide each method and note timeframe for when each will be done (e.g., every 6 weeks, 
every 2 cycles, etc.). Examples include:  
 
SCCC -[ADDRESS_1003435] of care. Other imaging of these areas such as PET/MR I will be 
allowed if CT cannot be performed.  
MRI of the brain will be performed at baseline and as clinically indicated. Wherever it can be 
safely given, radiographic contrast agents should be given for the imaging studies.  
 
6.1.4  Response Criteria  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of  Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions, determined by [CONTACT_308072] 4 weeks apart. There can be no appearance of new 
lesions.  
 
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of 
target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD. There can be no appearance of new 
lesions.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, 
taking as reference the small est sum LD recorded since the treatment started, or the 
appearance of one or more new lesions.  
 
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the  treatment started.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of 
tumor marker level.  
 
Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (SD) : Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) 
and/or m aintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non -target lesions  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the be st response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started). The subjects best response 
assignment will depend on the  achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

Note : Subjects with a global deterioration of health status requiring 
discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease 
progression at that time should be reported as “ symptomatic 
deteriorat ion”. Every effort should be made to document the 
objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  
Note: If subjects respond to treatment and are able to have their disease resected, the 
patient’s response will be assessed prior to the surge ry. 
6.1.5  Duration of Response  
Duration of overall response : The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date 
that recurrent or progressive disease is objectiv ely documented (taking as reference for 
progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for 
CR until the first date that recurrent  disease is objectively documented.   
 
Duration of stable disease : Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until 
the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started.  
6.1.6  Progression -Free Survival  
Progression -free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to 
time of progression.  
6.2 Safety/tolerability  
 Analyses will be performed for all subjects having received at least one dose of study drug. 
The study will use the CTCAE version 4.0 for reporting of non -hematologic adverse events 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html ) and modified criteria for hematologic adverse 
events.

7.1.1  Contraindications  
Pembrolizumab is approved by [CONTACT_734262]. In its current labeling, there are 
no contrain dications listed. Based on currently available data, there are no absolute 
contraindications to its usage in patients.  
7.1.2  Special Warnings and Precautions for Use  
There are concerns about pembrolizumab side effects, often immune -related. Always refer to 
the p ackage insert, any immune related toxicity should be carefully evaluated and considered 
serious. The relevant section from Lexicomp is provided below.  
 
• Gastrointestinal toxicity: Immune -mediated colitis (including microscopic colitis) has occurred, 
including cases of grade 2 or 3 colitis. The median time to onset of colitis was 6.5 months (range: ~2 
to 10 months) and the mediation duration was 2.6 months (range: 4 days to 3.6 months). Grade 2 or 3 
colitis was managed with high -dose systemic corticosteroid s (prednisone ≥40 mg/day [median initial 
dose 70 mg/day] or equivalent) with a median duration of initial corticosteroid therapy of 7 days (range: 
4 to 41 days), followed by a corticosteroid taper. Patients with colitis experienced complete resolution. 
May require treatment interruption, systemic corticosteroid therapy, or permanent discontinuation. 
Monitor for signs and symptoms of colitis; administer systemic corticosteroids for grade 2 or higher 
colitis.  
• Hepatotoxicity: Hepatitis, including autoimmune hepatitis, occurred (case reports, including 1 case of 
grade 4 hepatitis). The median onset for grade 4 hepatitis was 22 days; the duration was 1.1 months. 
Grade 4 hepatitis was managed with high -dose systemic corticosteroids (prednisone ≥40 mg/day or 
equivalent), followed a corticosteroid taper. Monitor for liver function changes. May require treatment 
interruption, systemic corticosteroids (for grade 2 or higher toxicity), or permanent discontinuation.  
• Hypophysitis: Immune -mediated hypophysitis occurred  (1 case of grade 2 and one case of grade 4). 
The time to onset was 1.3 and 1.7 months, respectively. Hypophysitis was managed with high -dose 
systemic corticosteroids (prednisone ≥40 mg/day or equivalent), followed by a corticosteroid taper. 
Patients then remained on physiologic corticosteroid replacement. Monitor for signs/symptoms of 
hypophysitis. May require treatment interruption, systemic corticosteroids (for grade 2 or higher 
toxicity), or permanent discontinuation.  
• Nephrotoxicity: Nephritis, includ ing autoimmune nephritis (1 case) and interstitial nephritis with renal 
failure (2 cases), has occurred. The onset for autoimmune nephritis was 11.[ADDRESS_1003439] dose, and duration was 3.2 months. Acute interstiti al nephritis was 
confirmed by [CONTACT_734263] 2 patients with grades 3/4 renal failure. These cases were managed with 
high-dose systemic corticosteroids (prednisone ≥40 mg/day equivalent, followed by a corticosteroid 
taper), with full recovery. Monitor for  renal function changes. May require treatment interruption, 
systemic corticosteroids (for grade 2 or higher toxicity), or permanent discontinuation.  
• Pulmonary toxicity: Immune -mediated pneumonitis has been observed, including cases which were 
grade 2 an d 3. The median time to development was 5 months (range: ~2 days to ~10 months) and 
the median duration was ~5 months (range: 1 week to 14.4 months). Some patients required initial 
management with high -dose systemic corticosteroids (median initial predniso ne dose of 63.4 mg/day

 or equivalent), the median duration of initial corticosteroid therapy was 3 days (range: 1 to 34 days) 
followed by a corticosteroid taper. Most patients with grade 2 or 3 pneumonitis had complete resolution. 
May require treatment int erruption, corticosteroid therapy, or permanent discontinuation. Monitor for 
signs and symptoms of pneumonitis; if pneumonitis is suspected, evaluate with radiographic imaging 
and administer systemic corticosteroids for grade 2 or higher pneumonitis.  
• Thy roid disorders: Immune -mediated hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism have occurred. The 
median onset for hyperthyroidism was 1.5 months (range: 2 to 8 weeks), and the median duration was 
2.8 months (range: 1 to 6 months). May require management with high -dose systemic corticosteroids 
(prednisone ≥40 mg/day or equivalent), followed by a corticosteroid taper. Hyperthyroidism resolved in 
all cases observed in the clinical trial. Hypothyroidism occurred with a median onset of 3.5 months 
(range: 5 days to 19 month s). Hypothyroidism was generally managed with long -term thyroid hormone 
replacement therapy, although some patients only required short -term replacement therapy. 
Hypothyroidism did not require systemic corticosteroid therapy or discontinuation. Thyroid dis orders 
may occur at any point in pembrolizumab therapy. Monitor for changes in thyroid function (at baseline, 
periodically during treatment and as clinically indicated). Administer systemic corticosteroids (for grade 
3 or higher hyperthyroidism); may requi re treatment interruption or permanent discontinuation. Isolated 
hypothyroidism may be managed with replacement therapy (without corticosteroids and treatment 
interruption).  
• Other immune -mediated toxicities: Other clinically relevant immune -mediated diso rders have been 
observed, including exfoliative dermatitis, uveitis, arthritis, myositis, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia, 
partial seizure (in a patient with inflammatory foci in brain parenchyma), and adrenal insufficiency. 
Myasthenic syndrome, optic neuri tis, and rhabdomyolysis have also been observed in patients 
receiving pembrolizumab. If an immune -mediated adverse event is suspected, evaluate appropriately; 
withhold treatment and administer systemic corticosteroids based on severity of reaction. Upon 
resolution to grade 0 or 1, initiate corticosteroid taper (continue tapering over at least 1 month). If 
reaction remains at grade 1 or less during taper may reinitiate pembrolizumab. Discontinue 
permanently for severe or grade 3 immune -mediated adverse event  that is recurrent or life -threatening.  
 
7.1.3  Interaction with other medications  
Refer to the package insert for possible interactions. There are currently no known 
interactions with other drugs.  
7.1.4  Adverse Reactions  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Event (AE) Monitoring  
The investigator  or qualified designee will assess each subject to evaluate for potential new or 
worsening AEs as specified in the Trial Flow Chart and more frequently if clinically indicated.  Adverse 
experiences will be graded and recorded throughout the study and durin g the follow -up period 
according to NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 (see Section 11.2).  Toxicities will be characterized in terms 
regarding seriousness, causality, toxicity grading, and action taken with regard to trial treatment.  
For subjects receiving treatment with pembrolizumab all AEs of unknown etiology associated with 
pembrolizumab exposure should be evaluated to determine if it is possibly an event of clinical interest 
(ECI) of a potentially immunologic etiology (termed immune -related adverse events, or irA Es); see the 
SCCC -[ADDRESS_1003440] a causal 
relationship with this treatment . An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol -specified procedure, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product or protocol -specified procedure.  Any worsening (i.e., any 
clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is 
temporally associated with the use of the [COMPANY_006]’s product, is also an adverse event.  
 
Changes resulting from normal growth and development that do not vary significantly in frequency or 
severity from expected levels are not to be considered adverse events.  Examples of this may 
include, but are not limited to, teething, typi[INVESTIGATOR_734251] a physiologically appropriate time.  
 
[COMPANY_006] product includes any pharmaceutical product, biological product, device, diagnostic agent or 
protocol -spec ified procedure, whether investigational (including placebo or active comparator 
medication) or marketed, manufactured by, licensed by, provided by [CONTACT_80085].  
 
Adverse events may occur during the course of the use of [COMPANY_006] produ ct in clinical trials or within the 
follow -up period specified by [CONTACT_760], or prescribed in clinical practice, from overdose (whether 
accidental or intentional), from abuse and from withdrawal.  
 
Adverse events may also occur in screened subjects durin g any pre -allocation baseline period as a 
result of a protocol -specified intervention, including washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, 
placebo treatment or a procedure.  
 
Progression of the cancer under study is not considered an adverse event unless it is considered to 
be drug related by [CONTACT_093].  
 
All adverse events will be recorded from the time the consent form is signed through 30 days 
following cessation of treatment and at each examination on the Adverse Event case report 
forms/wo rksheets. A planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_734252]; however, if a serious 
adverse event occurs during the course of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], then the event is reportable.  The 
reporting timeframe for adverse events meeting any serious criteria is  described in section [IP_ADDRESS].  
 
 
7.2.1  Definition of an Overdose for This Protocol and Reporting of Overdose to the Sponsor 
and to [COMPANY_006]  
For purposes of this trial, an overdose of pembrolizumab will be defined as any dose of 1,000 mg or 
greater (≥5 times the ind icated dose).  No specific information is available on the treatment of 
overdose of pembrolizumab. Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically 
indicated. In the event of overdose, the subject should be observed closely for signs of to xicity.  
Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated.

7.3.1  Definition  
Adverse Events will be reported as indicated by [CONTACT_114641] (see 
below).    
An adverse event  is defined as any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a 
human research study participant, including any abnormal sign (for example, 
abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, clinical event, or disease, 
temporarily associated with t he subject’s participation in the research, whether or not 
it is considered related to the subject’s participation in the research.  
Adverse events encompass clinical, physical and psychological harms. Adverse 
events occur most commonly in the context of bi omedical research, although on 
occasion, they can occur in the context of social and behavioral research. Adverse 
events may be expected or unexpected.  
Severity  
Adverse events will be graded by a numerical score according to the defined NCI 
Common Termino logy Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) and version number

 specified in the protocol. Adverse events not specifically defined in the NCI CTCAE 
will be scored on the Adverse Event log according to the general guidelines provided 
by [CONTACT_734264].   
 Grade 1: Mild  
 Grade 2: Moderate  
 Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening  
 Grade 4: Life threatening consequences  
 Grade 5: Death related to the adverse event  
 
Serious Adverse Events  
ICH Guideline E2A and the UTSW IRB define serious adverse events as those 
events, occurring at any dose, which meets any of the following criteria:  
 Results in death   
 Immediately life -threatening  
 Results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_110353]  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject’s 
health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in this definition.  
Note: A “Serious adverse event” is by [CONTACT_283095]. Serious adverse events may or may not be related to the research project. A 
serious adverse event determination does not require the event to be related to the 
research. That is, both events completely unrelated to the condition und er study and 
events that are expected in the context of the condition under study may be serious 
adverse events, independent of relatedness to the study itself. As examples, a car 
accident requiring overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_283060] a serious adverse even t for any 
research participant; likewise, in a study investigating end -stage cancer care, any 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_333495] a serious adverse event, even if the event observed 
is a primary clinical endpoint of the study. Refer to the UTSW IRB website a t 
http://www.utsouthwestern.net/intranet/research/research -administration/irb/study -
management/adverse -events.html  to determine  when a serious adverse event 
requires reporting to the IRB.  
7.3.2  Unanticipated Problems:  
The term “unanticipated problem” is found, but not defined in the regulations for the 
Protection of Human Subjects at 45 CFR 46, and the FDA regulations at 21 CFR 56. 
Guid ance from the regulatory agencies considers unanticipated problems to include 
any incident, experience, or outcome that meets each  of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity or frequency) AND  
• Definitely, probably, or possibly relat ed to participation in the research AND  
• Serious or a possible unexpected problem in that the research places 
subjects or others at greater risk of harm than was previously known or recognized. 
Note: Any serious adverse event would always suggest a greater  risk of harm.  
 
Follow -up  
All adverse events will be followed up according to good medical practices.

7.3.3  Reporting  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Local unanticipated problems require expedited reporting, and are submitted to the UTSW IRB 
through the UTSW eIRB and to the SCC DSMC Coordinator.  Hardcopi[INVESTIGATOR_734253]; FDA Form #3500A forms, or other sponsor forms, if appl icable; and/or any 
other supporting documentation available should be forwarded to the DSMC Coordinator.  The 
DSMC Coordinator forwards the information onto the DSMC Chairman who determines if 
immediate action is required.  Follow -up eIRB reports, and all subsequent SAE documentation 
that is available are also submitted to the DSMC Chair who determines if further action is 
required. (See Appendix IV of the SCC DSMC Plan for a template Serious Adverse Event Form 
which may be utilized when a sponsor form is u navailable and SAE submission to the eIRB in 
not required).  
  
All local serious adverse events which occur on research subjects on protocols for 
which the SCC is the DSMC of record require reporting to the DSMC regardless of 
whether IRB reporting is requir ed. Hardcopi[INVESTIGATOR_283062] 
#3500A forms, or other sponsor forms, if applicable; and/or any other supporting 
documentation available should be forwarded to the DSMC Coordinator.   
 
If the event occurs on a multi -institutional clin ical trial coordinated by [CONTACT_598929], the DOT Manager or lead coordinator ensures that all participating sites are 
notified of the event and resulting action, according to FDA guidance for expedited 
reporting. DSMC Chairperson reviews all serious ad verse events within upon receipt 
from the DSMC Coordinator.  The DSMC Chairperson determines whether action is 
required and either takes action immediately, convenes a special DSMC session 
(physical or electronic), or defers the action until a regularly sc heduled DSMC 
meeting.

7.4 Steps to Determine If an Adverse Event Requires Expedited Reporting  
Step 1 : Identify the type of adverse event using the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4).  
 
Step 2 : Grade the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE v4.  
 
Step 3 : Determine whether the adverse event is related to the protocol therapy  
Attributi on categories are as follows:  
- Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
Note : This includes all events that occur within [ADDRESS_1003447] dose of treatment 
and is attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent(s) must also be 
reported accordingly.  
 
Step 4 : Determine the prior experience of the adverse event.  
Expected events are those that have been previously identified as resulting from 
administration of the agent. An adverse event is considered unexpect ed, for 
expedited reporting purposes only, when either the type of event or the severity of 
the event is not listed in:  
 the current known adverse events listed in the Agent Information Section of 
this protocol;  
 the drug package insert;  
 the current Investig ator’s Brochure  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Events of Clinical Interest  
Selected non -serious and serious adverse events are also known as Events of Clinical 
Interest (ECI) and must be recorded as such on the Adverse Event case report 
forms/worksheets and reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor and within 2 working days to 
[COMPANY_006] Global Safety. (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 993 -1220)Events of clinical 
interest for this trial include:  
1.  an overdose of [COMPANY_006] product, as defined in Section 7.2.[ADDRESS_1003448] of protocol -specified laboratory testing or 
unscheduled laboratory testing.*  
*Note:   These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance documents. The purpose of 
the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require an additional

 evaluation for an underlying etiolo gy.  The trial site guidance for assessment and follow up of 
these criteria can be found in the Investigator Trial File Binder (or equivalent).  
1. Additional adverse events:  
 A separate guidance document has been provided entitled “Event of Clinical Interest Guidance 
Document” (previously entitled, “Event of Clinical Interest and Immune -Related Adverse Event 
Guidance Document”).  This document can be found in Appendix 4 and provides guidance 
regarding identification, evaluation and management of ECIs and irAEs .   
 ECIs (both non -serious and serious adverse events) identified in this guidance document from the 
date of first dose through 90 days following cessation of treatment, or 30 days after the initiation 
of a new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, ne ed to be reported within 24 hours to the 
Sponsor and within 2 working days to [COMPANY_006] Global Safety. (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 
215 993 -1220), regardless of attribution to study treatment, consistent with standard SAE 
reporting guidelines.  
 
 Subjec ts should be assessed for possible ECIs prior to each dose.  Lab results should be 
evaluated and subjects should be asked for signs and symptoms suggestive of an immune -
related event.  Subjects who develop an ECI thought to be immune -related should have 
additional testing to rule out other etiologic causes.  If lab results or symptoms indicate a possible 
immune -related ECI, then additional testing should be performed to rule out other etiologic 
causes.  If no other cause is found, then it is assumed to be i mmune -related.  
 
 
7.4.2  Evaluating Adverse Events  
An investigator who is a qualified physician will evaluate all adverse events according to the 
NCI Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Any adverse event 
which changes CTCAE grade over the c ourse of a given epi[INVESTIGATOR_110507]/worksheets.  
All adverse events regardless of CTCAE grade must also be evaluated for seriousness.

Grading  Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mid symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
 Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local or n oninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -

 Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_133604]; disabling; limiting self -care ADL.  
 Grade 4  Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
 Grade [ADDRESS_1003449] that:

 †Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  (in offspring of subject taking the product regardless of time to 
diagnosis);or  
 Is a new cancer;  (that is not a condition of  the study)  or 
 Is an overdose  (whether accidental or intentional).  Any adverse event associated with an overdose is 
considered a serious adverse event. An overdose that is not associated with an adverse event is considered 
a non -serious event of clinical interest and must be reported  within [ADDRESS_1003450] and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed previously (designated above by a †).  
Duration  Record the start and stop dates of the adverse event. If less than [ADDRESS_1003451] to be discontinued?  
Relationship 
to test drug  Did the [COMPANY_006] product cause the adverse event? The determination of the likelihood that the [COMPANY_006] product 
caused the adverse event will be provided by [CONTACT_19427] a qualified physician. The investigator’s 
signed/dated initials on the source docu ment or worksheet that supports the causality noted on the AE form, 
ensures that a medically qualified assessment of causality was done. This initialed document must be 
retained for the required regulatory time frame. The criteria below are intended as ref erence guidelines to 
assist the investigator in assessing the likelihood of a relationship between the test drug and the adverse 
event based upon the available information.  
The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the Mer ck product and 
the AE ; the greater the correlation with the components and their respective elements (in number and/or 
intensity), the more likely the [COMPANY_006] product caused the adverse event (AE):  
 Exposure  Is there evidence that the subject was actually e xposed to the [COMPANY_006] product such as: 
reliable history, acceptable compliance assessment (pi[INVESTIGATOR_692], diary, etc.), expected 
pharmacologic effect, or measurement of drug/metabolite in bodily specimen?  
 Time Course  Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the [COMPANY_006] 
product?  
Is the time of onset of the AE compatible with a drug -induced effect (applies to trials with 
investigational medicinal product)?  
 Likely Cause  Is the AE not rea sonably explained by [CONTACT_26369], other 
drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or environmental factors  
SCCC -[ADDRESS_1003452] drug and the AE: (continued)  
to [COMPANY_006] 
product  
(continued)  Dechallenge  Was the [COMPANY_006] product discontinued or dose/exposure/frequency 
reduced?  
If yes, did the AE resolve or improve?  
If yes, this is a positive dechallenge. If no, this is a negative 
dechallenge.  
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the AE resulted in death or 
permanent disability; (2) the AE resolved/improved despi[INVESTIGATOR_80036]; or (3) the trial is a single -dose drug 
trial); or (4) [COMPANY_006] product(s) is/are only used one time.)  
 Rechallenge  Was the subject re -exposed to the [COMPANY_006] product in this study?  
If yes, did the AE recur or worsen?  
If yes, this is a positive rechallenge. If no, this is a negative 
rechallenge.  
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the initial AE resulted in 
death or permanent disability, or (2) the trial is a single -dose drug 
trial); or (3) [COMPANY_006] product(s) is/are used only one time).  
NOTE: IF A RECHALLENGE IS PLANNED FOR AN ADVERSE 
EVENT WHICH WAS SERIOUS AND WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN 
CAUSED BY [CONTACT_80086], OR IF REEXPOSURE TO 
THE MERCK PRODUCT  POSES ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL 
SIGNIFICANT RISK TO THE SUBJECT, THEN THE RECHALLENGE 
MUST BE APPROVED IN ADVANCE BY [CONTACT_64918] U.S. CLINICAL 
MONITOR AS PER DOSE MODIFICATION GUIDELINES IN THE 
PROTOCOL.  
 Consistency 
with Trial 
Treatment 
Profile  Is the clinical/pathological presentation of the AE consistent with 
previous knowledge regarding the [COMPANY_006] product or drug class 
pharmacology or toxicology?  
The assessment of relationship will be reported on the case report forms /worksheets by [CONTACT_78031] a qualified physician according to his/her best clinical judgment, including consideration of the 
above elements.  
Record one of the following  Use the following scale of criteria as guidance (not all criteria must 
be present to be indicative of a [COMPANY_006] product relationship).  
Yes, there is a reasonable 
possibility of [COMPANY_006] 
product relationship.  There is evidence of exposure to the [COMPANY_006] product.  The temporal 
sequence of the AE onset relative to the ad ministration of the [COMPANY_006] 
product is reasonable.  The AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_734265].  
No, there is not a 
reasonable possibility 
[COMPANY_006] product relationship  Subject did not receive the [COMPANY_006] product OR temporal sequen ce of the 
AE onset relative to administration of the [COMPANY_006] product is not 
reasonable OR there is another obvious cause of the AE.  (Also entered 
for a subject with overdose without an associated AE.)

9.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 Study Design/Study Endpoints  
It is an open -label, multi -institution trial designed to evaluate the activity of pembrolizumab therapy 
in anaplastic thyroid cancer in patients with no curative alternative therapy. The primary endpoint 
is the overall response rate of patients with unresectable or metastatic anaplastic thyroid cancer. 
The secondary endpoint is the progression free survival, overall survival, safety and toxicity of 
patients with unresectable or metastatic anaplastic thyroid cancer. The exploratory objective is to 
determine whether any tissue biomarkers or mutations noted on Next Generation Sequencing with 
FoundationOne Panel correlate for enhanced or impaired response to pembrolizumab therapy, in 
patients w ith unresectable or metastatic anaplastic thyroid cancer.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_1003455], a sample size of 21 patients would provide 80% power to 
detect a difference in the response rate from 5% for historical control to a target r ate of 
25%, with a one -sided significant level of 0.05. The sample size is calculated using PASS 
[ADDRESS_1003456] evidence of continued clinical benefit from pembrolizumab may continue to receive the study 
medication. In such cases, these patients mus t continue to be followed for safety and efficacy assessments 
as per the schedule of assessments.   
At the completion or discontinuation of study medication, all patients will be seen within 30 days for an end 
of therapy evaluation. This will include a safe ty assessment for AE’s SAE’s. Any unused medication will 
be returned.  
9.[ADDRESS_1003457] of the following:  
 
- What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this protocol  
- Who will have access to that information and why  
- Who will use or disclose that information  
- The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by  
[CONTACT_208568], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject 
authorization. For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts 
should be made to obtain permission to collect follow -up safety infor mation (e.g. has the subject 
experienced any new or worsened AEs) at the end of their scheduled protocol treatment period.

Trial monitoring will be conducted no less than annually and refers to a regular interval 
review of trial related activity and documentation performed by [CONTACT_114650], which includes 
but is not limited to accuracy of case report forms, protocol co mpliance, timeless and 
accuracy of Velos entries and AE/SAE management and reporting. Documentation of 
trial monitoring will be maintained along with other protocol related documents and will 
be reviewed during internal audit.  
 
Toxicity and dose escalation  reviews will be performed through the duration of the trial .  
These reviews will be documented by [CONTACT_734272] -DSMC, if needed.  
 
 
The UTSW Simmons Cancer Center (SCC) Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) 
is responsible for monitoring data quality and patient safety for all UTSW SCC clinical 
trials.  As part of that responsibility, the DSMC reviews all local serious adverse events 
and unanticipated problems in real time as they are reported  and reviews adverse 
events on a quarterly basis.  The quality assurance activity for the Clinical Research 
Office provides for periodic auditing of clinical research documents to ensure data 
integrity and regulatory compliance.  A copy of the DSMC plan is  available upon 
request.  
 
The SCC DSMC meets quarterly and conducts annual comprehensive reviews of 
ongoing clinical trials, for which it serves as the DSMC of record. The QAC works as 
SCCC -[ADDRESS_1003466], frequency of DSMC 
monitoring is dependent upon the level of risk.  Risk level is determined by [CONTACT_375299] a number of factors such as the phase of the study; the type of 
investigational agent, device or intervention being studied; and monitoring required to 
ensure the safety of study subjects based on the associated risks of the study. Protocol -
specific DSMC plans must be consistent with these principles.

For any such emergency modification implemented, an IRB modification form 
must be comple ted within  five (5) business days of making the change.  
10.13.2  Other Protocol Deviations/Violations  
All other planned deviations from the protocol must have prior approval by [CONTACT_1268] [INVESTIGATOR_72616]. According to the IRB, a protocol deviation  is 
any unplanned variance from an IRB approved protocol that:  
 Is generally noted or recognized after it occurs  
 Has no substantive effect on the risks to research participants  
 Has no substantive effect on the scientific integrity of the research plan or 
the value of the data collected  
 Did not result from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the 
investigator(s).  
 
An unplanned protocol variance is considered a violation  if the variance:  
 Has harmed or increased the risk of harm to one or more research 
participants.  
 Has damaged the scientific integrity of the data collected for the study.  
 Results from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of the investigator(s).  
 Demonst rates serious or continuing noncompliance with federal regulations, 
State laws, or University policies.  
 
If a deviation or violation occurs without prior approval from the Principal 
Investigator, please follow the guidelines below:  
 
 
Protocol Deviations: Personnel will report to any sponsor or data and safety 
monitoring committee in accordance with their policies. Deviations should be 
summarized and reported to the IRB at the time of continuing review.  
 
Protocol Violations: Study personnel should report violations within two (2) 
week of the investigator becoming aware of the event using the same IRB 
online mechanism used to report Unanticipated Problems.  
SCCC -[ADDRESS_1003468] Reten tion 
Study documentation includes all Case Report Forms, data correction forms or queries, 
source documents, Sponsor -Investigator correspondence, monitoring logs/letters, and 
regulatory documents (e.g., protocol and amendments, IRB correspondence and 
appro val, signed patient consent forms).  
 
Source documents include all recordings of observations or notations of clinical activities 
and all reports and records necessary for the evaluation and reconstruction of the 
clinical research study.  
 
Government agency regulations and directives require that the study investigator retain 
all study documentation pertaining to the conduct of a clinical trial. In the case of a study 
with a drug seeking regulatory approval and marketing, these documents shall be 
retained for  at least two years after the last approval of marketing application in an 
International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) region. In all other cases, study 
documents should be kept on file until three years after the completion and final study 
report of t his investigational study.

accordance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations and/or the Declaration of 
Helsinki. The Princ ipal Investigator is responsible for personally overseeing the 
treatment of all study patients. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_292629], including sub -investigators and other study staff members, adhere to the 
study protocol an d all FDA/GCP/NCI regulations and guidelines regarding clinical trials 
both during and after study completion.  
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_114612]. 
Periodically, monitoring visits may be conducted and the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_17027] l 
provide access to his/her original records to permit verification of proper entry of data. At 
the completion of the study, all case report forms will be reviewed by [CONTACT_9532] [INVESTIGATOR_44302]/her final signature [CONTACT_734275] y of the data.

Methods  
This study had a prospective, randomized controlled design conducted at a single, 
academic hospi[INVESTIGATOR_99041]’s review board, which required 
signed consent. The study was HIPAA compliant and registered at the Clinical Trials 
Registry (# [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ) with the title “ Effects of Sublingual and Transdermal 
Administration of Nitroglycerin for Coronary CT Angiography on Image Quality ”. 
Based on prior literature, we hypothesized that mean coronary artery diameter befor e and 
after nitroglycerin application would be 2.86 mm and 3.26 mm, respectively, with 13.8% 
vasodilation (13). We assumed an equivalence range of 3% and determined a t ype-I error 
of (0.05/3=0.017) for a 3 -group comparison with 80% power. In total, [ADDRESS_108841] to the study was blinded to the method of nitro glycerin 
administration. After obtaining informed consent, subjects were randomized (block 
randomization, block size=198) to one of three nitroglycerin delivery methods: (1) 
sublingual as a tablet (2x0.4 mg, Nitrostat, [COMPANY_007] Inc., NY), (2) lingual as a sp ray (2x0.4 
mg, Nitrolingual, Pohl -Boskamp, Hohenlockstedt, [LOCATION_013] ), or (3) transdermal as a 
patch (2x0.4 mg/h, Nitro -Dur, [COMPANY_006]&Co Inc., NJ). After assessing initial vital signs (heart 
rate, rhythm, and blood pressure), non -contrast CT was acquired. Subse quently, 
nitroglycerin was administered. Patches were placed on the upper chest, taking care to 
avoid body hair. The transdermal delivery method required an application time of at least 
45 minutes, while lingual and sublingual nitroglycerin required 5 minu tes application time 
before CCTA acquisition ( Figure 1 ). After CCTA, the patches were removed, and the 
location was inspected for skin reaction, while spray and tablets did not require further 
interaction. Next, we remeasured vital signs and asked for symp toms of allergic -type 
reactions and if sublingual tablets had completely dissolved. Systolic blood pressure >180 
mmHg or a drop of >[ADDRESS_108842] (Somatom  Definition Flash, 
Siemens Healthineers , Forc hheim, [LOCATION_013] ). Scan length was from carina to diaphragm 
and was extended if  necessary. Scan parameters were as follows: non -contrast CT 
(prospectively -ECG -triggered at 350ms after the R wave, fixed 120kV, mA adjusted to 
body size, with a reference of 80 mAs [CareDose4D, Siemens Healthineers], 64x0.6mm 
collimation), CCTA (prospect ively-ECG -triggered for heart rates <85 bpm, ≥85 bpm 
retrospectively -ECG -gated,  with an acquisition window in late systole to early diastole 
(220-[ADDRESS_108843]), 80 -120kV with optimal kV [CarekV, Siemens 
Healthineers] and automatic mA selection  based on the scout scan, reference 280 mAs, 
64x0.6mm collimation). No beta -blocker was administered, as per our standard site 
practice.  
Images were reconstructed using iterative reconstruction algorithm (strength level 3/5, 
Admire, Siemens Healthineers) with 0.[ADDRESS_108844] 
images and 220 -440ms (20ms intervals) for CCTA images.  All studies were blinded as to 
the nitroglycerin delivery method. Coronary calcium scores (Agatston method) and 
severity of any coronary artery dis ease were assessed from the radiology reports.  
Quantitative Analysis  
A cardiovascular imaging -trained radiologist with six years of experience 
(X.X.) (anonymized) measured coronary diameters at seven locations ( Figure 2 ) using a 
3D-workstation (Aquarius v.4 .4.12, Terarecon Inc., Foster City, CA). These locations 
were predetermined as: (1) proximal right coronary artery (RCA) 1.5 cm distal from the 
ostium; (2) mid RCA 1.0 cm proximal of the acute marginal branch; (3) distal RCA 1.0 cm 
proximal of the bifurcat ion into posterior descending artery and right postero -lateral 
branch; (4) middle of the left main (LM); (5) proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) 
1.[ADDRESS_108845] diagonal branch, in the middle of 
the pr oximal LAD; (6) mid LAD 2.[ADDRESS_108846] diagonal branch or if less distance to 
the 2nd diagonal branch, in the middle of mid LAD; and (7) left circumflex coronary artery 
2.[ADDRESS_108847] and  800 HU and 200 HU 
for CCTA images  (Figure 2 ). Window settings were set based on preliminary 
measurements in [ADDRESS_108848] and CCTA images. Locations #1, #4, and # 5 were 
defined as proximal -, locations #2 #6, and #7 as mid -, and location #[ADDRESS_108849] deviations, or as median and interquartile range 
(25th and 75th percentiles) if the distribution of the variables were skewed. Differences in 
continuous v ariables by [CONTACT_99043] -Wallis test, and 
differences in categorical variables were assessed using either the Pearson χ2 test, or 
Fisher’s exact test.  Changes of vital parameters pre - and posttreatment were compared 
using pair ed t-test.   
A linear quantile (median) mixed -effects model was constructed to quantify the 
unadjusted association between treatment and vasodilation (contrast diameter/non -
contrast diameter x 100) while accounting for dependencies within the data set due to 
multiple observations per subject. This modeling approach permitted the estimation of the 
median vasodilation as a function of covariates while avoiding the parametric modeling 
assumptions that are typi[INVESTIGATOR_99042]. Estimate s of fixed -
effects, and their 95% Wald -type confidence intervals, were computed for all model 
parameters. Linear combinations of these parameters were used to estimate overall 
effects, and effects by [CONTACT_3148].  
Two additional models were constructed where  we hierarchically accounted for patient 
demographics (i.e., age, gender, BMI and height) and then by [CONTACT_99044] (i.e., CA score). A subgroup analysis was performed where 
model parameters were estimated by [CONTACT_99045], m id and distal regions. Due to the 
explorative nature of this subgroup analysis, p -values were not adjusted for multiple 
comparisons.  
All analyses were performed using R 3.4.3 (R -Core Team, 2017, Vienna, Austria)  (20) 
and the lqmm R library (21).

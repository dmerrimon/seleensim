- 4 -1. Purpose/Specific Objectives
Childhood cancer survivors are a growing population in the US (currently over 379,000).6 
Unfortunately, these survivors are at risk for adverse health late effects from treatment such as 
cardiovascular disease and premature mortality.7-10 Survivors require lifelong follow-up care to 
identify, monitor, and treat medical and psychosocial late effects stemming from their cancer, its 
treatment, and lifestyle factors.11 However, over 70% of childhood cancer survivors do not 
obtain specific risk-based follow-up care.12 Adolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors of 
pediatric cancers are particularly vulnerable to lapses in follow-up care due to ineffective 
transitions from parent-guided management to self-management of care.11,13
The transition from parent-guided management to self-management of long-term follow-
up care involves assuming primary responsibility for tasks such as managing health records, 
making appointments, filling and taking prescriptions, and understanding late effects monitoring 
and cancer screening needs. It occurs during a critical developmental period when AYAs may be 
unaware or fail to recognize their health risks and need for regular follow-up.11 Barriers to 
successful transition include survivors’ lack of knowledge of their diagnosis and treatment, 
cancer-related anxiety and other emotional concerns, and failure or inability to assume personal 
responsibility for health.13-[ADDRESS_582668] on health outcomes 
because giving AYA survivors the knowledge, skills, support, and self-efficacy to manage their 
follow-up care will apply to any setting (i.e., cancer center or community-based primary care). 
This project takes an innovative approach to improving AYA survivors’ self-management of 
long-term follow-up care through adaptation of an evidence-based problem-solving skills 
training (PSST) intervention and the addition of peer mentors to facilitate completion of the 
intervention. PSST has been shown to improve problem-solving skills in other cancer contexts,3-5 
and we will adapt the content of the program to address the needs of AYA cancer survivors using 
patient, parent, and provider input. We anticipate that the adapted program will focus on 
improving disease knowledge, health motivation, problem-solving skills, stress management, and 
communication with caregivers and providers, all of which are important constructs to promote 
transition readiness as outlined in the Social-Ecological Model of AYA Readiness for Transition 
(SMART).[ADDRESS_582669] with other 
young adult survivors and seek advice from others who “get it.”7,[ADDRESS_582670] is to develop and evaluate a peer mentoring self-management 
intervention to improve self-management skills for AYA survivors. We will evaluate feasibility 
(i.e., enrollment, retention, satisfaction with the program) and preliminary efficacy (i.e., changes 
in survivors’ healthcare self-management skills, readiness to transition, and cancer-related 
anxiety). In Phase 1, we will use AYA survivor, parent, and provider interviews to adapt an 
evidence-based problem-solving skills training program to promote AYA self-management of 
care. We will recruit and train peer mentors to implement the PSST intervention. In Phase 2, we 
will conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_455734] [ADDRESS_582671] usability testing of the new modules in Phase 3A. We 
will then evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the self-management + peer 
mentoring intervention in a randomized two-arm trial comparing the intervention to usual care 
(Phase 3B).

- 5 -1.1 Objectives/Hypotheses
Aim 1: Develop the self-management + peer mentoring to improve AYA self-
management of long-term follow-up care.
Qualitative research with AYA cancer survivors, parents, and healthcare providers will be 
conducted to adapt an evidence-based problem-solving skills training (PSST) program to 
address the needs of AYA survivors. 
Aim 2: Evaluate the feasibility of the self-management + peer mentoring program.
We will examine feasibility through study enrollment rates, retention rates, adherence to the 
intervention, reasons for study drop out, and patient and mentor satisfaction with the 
program.
Hypothesis 1: Based on literature, we expect enrollment >50% of eligible patients and 
retention >80%.
Hypothesis 2: We expect patients enrolled in the mentor program to complete >75% of 
intervention sessions
Aim 3: Assess preliminary outcomes of the peer mentoring program.
Hypothesis 3 (Phase 2): Participants in the mentor group will demonstrate improvement in 
self-management skills, transition readiness, and anxiety.
Hypothesis 4 (Phase 3):  Participants in the self-management + peer mentor intervention will 
demonstrate greater improvement in transition readiness than participants in the usual care 
group.
Hypothesis 5 (Phase 3):  Participants in the self-management + peer mentor intervention will 
participate in survivorship and preventive healthcare at greater rate than participants in the 
usual care group.
2. Background and Significance
The transition to adult self-management of health care is often ineffectively managed by 
[CONTACT_455759].
Ineffective transition to adult self-management of care results in inadequate follow-up care and 
potential health problems. Although it is recommended that childhood cancer survivors obtain 
long-term follow-up care tailored to address the risks of their cancer, treatment, and lifestyle 
(called “risk-based follow-up care”), over 70% of young adult childhood cancer survivors do not 
obtain such care.9,[ADDRESS_582672] cohort study of childhood cancer survivors, the 
Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS), show that even survivors at greatest risk for late 
effects demonstrate low rates of cancer screening.2,10,[ADDRESS_582673] been preventable. Barriers to adult-oriented health care transition for AYA survivors

- 6 -include survivor-related factors, such as inadequate knowledge of their cancer history and 
treatment, complex medical conditions, anxiety, and difficulty assuming personal responsibility 
for health.7,8,12,14,15 These survivor-related factors call for a survivor-focused intervention.  
Theoretically-driven interventions to improve self-management of care are needed.
Although there is attention to AYA transition in the literature, a lack of transition-related 
theoretical frameworks has hindered the development and evaluation of targeted interventions to 
promote self-management of care.1 The Social-Ecological Model of AYA Readiness for 
Transition (SMART)[ADDRESS_582674] to promote AYA 
readiness for transition (Figure 1). Transition readiness refers to the capacity of the AYA and 
his/her support network to prepare for and complete the process of moving to adult-oriented 
care.1 Factors related to transition readiness include knowledge of health history, risks, and 
needs; self-management skills and self-efficacy for managing care; beliefs and expectations 
regarding the transition process or adult-oriented care (such as belief that adult provider will not 
understand patient’s needs); goals related to health 
transition; relationships with parents and providers; and 
psychosocial functioning of patients, parents, and providers 
(such as anxiety about the transition process or future 
health).1 Problem-solving skills training (PSST) is a generic, 
cognitive-behavioral intervention that can be readily adapted 
to target these constructs. For example, PSST can be used to 
help AYAs set transition and self-management goals, 
explore beliefs/expectations related to the goals or barriers to 
such goals, manage stress, and promote self-efficacy by 
[CONTACT_455760], achievable steps. We 
chose PSST as an intervention because it empowers 
individuals to improve self-management skills, which 
include maintaining health records, making appointments, 
filling and taking prescriptions, and understanding health 
risks and monitoring needs. PSST also has a strong evidence 
base and has been shown to be effective for increasing 
problem-solving skills for parents who are managing a 
child’s cancer treatment.3-[ADDRESS_582675] that AYA survivors want to discuss their medical 
care needs with other AYA survivors.7,8,16,17 Although peer mentoring has been recommended as 
an innovative approach to facilitate health care transitions for AYAs,6 the only published 
intervention utilizing this approach for survivors is a peer-delivered counseling intervention for 
smoking cessation among adult childhood cancer survivors from the CCSS.18 Childhood cancer 
survivors who received the peer-delivered telephone counseling intervention were twice as likely Figure 1. SMART model1,2

effectiveness of peer-to-peer programs for health behavior change in this population.18 
Peer mentoring programs delivered using technology can be implemented across a variety 
of settings.
The Adolescent and Young Adult Oncology Progress Review Group (AYAO PRG) 
recommended the development of standardized peer-to-peer programs as a strategy for 
supporting the psychosocial needs of AYA cancer patients and survivors.[ADDRESS_582676], as demonstrated by [CONTACT_455761], which has recently been translated to a web-based intervention.18,20 The use of 
technology to deliver skills-building modules and peer mentoring aligns with AYAs’ preferences 
for technology, with 85% of young adults 18-[ADDRESS_582677] usability testing of the new modules in Phase 
3A. We will then evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the self-management + 
peer mentoring intervention in a randomized two-arm trial comparing the intervention to usual 
care (Phase 3B). The biostatistician will determine a randomization scheme using an 
undisclosed block size. The scheme will be uploaded to DatStat for automatic assignments.  
For a backup, randomization assignments will be provided to PI [INVESTIGATOR_455735]. 
3.1. Duration of Study
Phase 1: Participants will be asked to complete a one-time interview lasting approximately 60 
minutes. 
Phase 2: Participants will be asked to complete the intervention over a period of 6 weeks. 
Participants will be asked to complete 6-week online self-management educational modules 
and 6 weekly peer mentor calls to facilitate engagement with the online modules and offer 
specialized support.  
Phase 3A: Usability sessions will last approximately 1-hour. Given that usability testing is 
iterative and design changes are made in response to participant feedback, we will ask some 
participants if they are willing to review the product another time after changes are made, up 
to a total of five times. Each session is voluntary and conducted in a way to minimize 
participant burden.

of approximately 8 weeks (which includes 6 peer mentor calls and five corresponding online 
modules). All participants will be asked to complete surveys at four time points: baseline, 
immediate post-intervention (~8 weeks after baseline), 3-month follow-up (~5 months after 
baseline), and 9-month follow-up (~12 months after baseline).
3.2 Study Sites
Phase 1& 3a: Interviews will be conducted at the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey or 
via phone. 
Phase 2&3b: Peer mentors will be trained at the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey or via 
phone or online webinars. Participants will receive intervention materials online, via email, or 
via text messaging. 
3.3 Sample Size Justification 
Phase 1: Total sample size is 24-28, including [ADDRESS_582678] 24-28 interviews 
will be adequate to achieve data saturation (that is, no new themes emerge from additional 
participants). 
Phase 2: 40 AYA survivors and 20 peer mentors will be recruited for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_455736] (primary objective) and preliminary outcomes (secondary objective). As this is a 
feasibility study, we recognize we are underpowered to detect small or medium effects. 
Published data suggest 5-9% of survivors are African American or Hispanic;22 data from the 
NJSCR show greater diversity, with 11.6% of patients diagnosed with cancer at age 10-19 
during the period of 2008-2012 reporting as African American, 19% reporting as Hispanic, 
and 5.7% as Asian American/Pacific Islander. We will oversample these groups.
Phase 3A: Up to [ADDRESS_582679] 12-20 sessions will 
achieve data saturation (i.e., no new issues emerge according to pre-specified stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_31732]).[ADDRESS_582680] about 12 to 20 participants will 
be needed to achieve data saturation.
Phase 3B: Total sample size is 50 AYA survivors. We chose the sample size and decision 
rules so that the probability of declaring feasibility would be approximately 5% under 
unacceptable rates of acceptance/completion and exceed 95% under acceptable rates. If true 
acceptance and completion rates were 41% and 70%, respectively, which we consider too 
low to move to an efficacy trial, then the probability of declaring feasibility would be 5%.

3.5.[ADDRESS_582683] Recruitment 
Phase 1: We will recruit 10 AYA survivors of childhood cancers and 10 caregivers 
through the Rutgers Cancer Institute Long-Term Information Treatment-Effects 
Evaluation (LITE) program. Invitational letters from [CONTACT_455784], the Director of the 
LITE program, will be sent to patients on the CINJ LITE mailing list. Flyers will be 
posted and handed out in clinic. Potentially eligible participants will be approached at 
routine LITE clinic visits to describe the study, answer any questions, and assess interest 
in participating. If a parent does not accompany an AYA survivor to the LITE visit, we 
will ask interested AYA survivors to share a flyer with their parent(s). AYAs and parents 
do not have to be dyads to enroll in the study. We will also recruit 4-8 healthcare providers 
(e.g., physicians, nurse practitioners, social workers, psychologists) who regularly work 
with AYA pediatric cancer survivors. These providers will be recruited through the 
Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey as well as through the AYA and Survivorship 
Working Groups of the Children’s Oncology Group because they will have greater 
expertise and experience with AYA survivors than community providers.
Phase 2: Peer mentors will be recruited via advertisements in the CINJ LITE clinic and 
newsletter, AYA cancer support groups, and online forums/social media, such as 
stupi[INVESTIGATOR_455739].org. Following the Children’s Oncology Group’s approach to recruiting 
patient advocates, potential mentors will complete an application including two letters of 
recommendation. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_455740], level of commitment to the program, and counseling or related experience. 
Participants for the randomized trial will be recruited using the New Jersey State Cancer 
Registry (NJSCR). All participant information and surveillance data from the NJSCR is 
collected and maintained by [CONTACT_455762] (see 
IRB#Pro20140000992 NJSCR SEER Data Repository). Patient contact [CONTACT_43056], 
tracking, and data release also follows NJSCR Standard Operating Procedures. Per 
Standard Operating Procedures, NJSCR staff will contact [CONTACT_455763]. An introductory letter and flyer will be mailed to potential participants. NJSCR 
staff will make follow-up phone calls to provide additional information and, for patients 
who express interest in participating, to obtain permission to send their contact 
[CONTACT_455764]. Devine’s study staff, who will then contact [CONTACT_455765].
Phase 3A: AYA survivors will be recruited during routine CINJ LITE clinic visits, via 
advertisements in the CINJ LITE clinic and newsletter, mailing a recruitment flyer to

4. Study Variables
4.1 Independent Variables or Interventions 
Phase 1: Semi-structured interview guides will be used to conduct interviews. The goal of the 
interviews is to understand patient, parent, and provider perspectives on the challenges faced by 
[CONTACT_455770]-management of care.
Phase 2: Independent variables include demographics (age, gender, socioeconomic status, 
education, employment status, living at home or independently) and cancer diagnosis and 
treatment history (i.e., diagnosis, time since treatment completion, types of treatment received). 
Diagnosis and date of diagnosis will be obtained from NJSCR records and the remaining 
information from self-report.

Phase 3B: Same as Phase 2.
Phase 2: Peer Mentoring Intervention. Based on initial interviews and feedback on the PSST 
intervention, we identified five major themes to be addressed in our program. The intervention 
will include two components: (1) online self-management educational modules using the Rutgers 
Canvas online course platform and (2) weekly video-conference calls on Doxy.me between the 
peer mentor and participant. Table 1 shows the content of the five online modules based on 
preliminary work. Participants are expected to complete one module per week in addition to a 
call with their mentors. Each module takes approximately 30 minutes to complete and ends with 
a personalized assignment for the participant to complete on his/her own (e.g., obtain 
survivorship care plan, make an appointment, practice communication skills). 
Participants will be matched with a peer mentor of the same sex and cancer type to the 
extent possible.26,[ADDRESS_582686] mentor call are to build rapport, exchange stories 
regarding current long-term follow-up care, and identify the participant’s self-management 
strengths, weaknesses, and goals. During this call, the mentor will explain that the mentee is 
expected to complete one online module per week prior to their next scheduled mentor call (one 
a week for six weeks). The dose was chosen based on other peer mentoring programs that 
employed weekly Skype calls.26,27 Weekly video-conference calls will be made on HIPAA 
compliant Doxy.me (https://doxy.me/) that implements security and encryption protocols to 
assure that data integrity and privacy is maintained. In addition to weekly calls, the mentor will 
encourage the participant to work through the assignment and modules via a weekly text 
message (using TigerText,28 a HIPAA-compliant program) to offer encouragement, support, and 
relevant resources. Mentor-mentee calls will be recorded and text messages will be archived for 
supervision and content analysis.  
Given that AYAs are high consumers of technology21 and tend to have many different 
educational, work, and social scheduling demands, we believe using online educational modules 
and technology to connect the peer mentor and participants will be the most efficient delivery 
system for this group. To capi[INVESTIGATOR_455747]’ regular use of technology, peers will provide 
support and facilitate completion of educational modules via [ADDRESS_582687]

Peer Mentor Training. Peer mentors will attend a one-day training workshop conducted by [CONTACT_1600] [INVESTIGATOR_6012] (similar to other peer mentor programs26,29). Peer mentors will be given the 
Peer Mentor Handbook, a manual adapted from the National Mentoring Research Center, which 
details their roles, responsibilities, and an outline for each mentor call. Presentations, interactive 
discussions, and role plays will be used to teach mentors how to facilitate their mentee’s use of 
the online self-management modules, and how to provide informational and emotional support to 
their mentees. Ethical issues, including confidentiality and setting boundaries with peers, will be 
discussed. Peer mentors will also be instructed in how to securely transfer audio recordings of 
their calls with mentees and destroy the original file from their devices. In addition to the in-
person training, we will email these instructions. Peer mentors will have regular weekly phone 
supervision with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_455749]. During this supervision call, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_455750]. 
Phase 3B: Self-Management + Peer Mentoring Intervention. The intervention content is the 
same as described in Phase 2. There are a few minor differences: (1) the online modules will be 
hosted on its own website instead of Canvas; this website will be built in Phase 3A using Radiant 
Creative Group, LLC, an experienced technology development firm that has a strong history of 
collaboration with [CONTACT_455785] and other Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey investigators; (2) 
TigerText is now called TigerConnect and has expanded its services to include secure 
videoconferencing; therefore, doxy.me will no longer be used; and (3) peer mentor training can 
be completed either in-person or via videoconference to minimize peer mentor burden.
Phase 3B: Usual Care Comparison.  The Usual Care group will complete surveys only. To 
select an appropriate comparison, we reviewed the literature of advantages/disadvantages of 
different designs.30-[ADDRESS_582688] falsely concluding that the intervention lacks 
efficacy. We will offer access to the online educational modules upon completion of all study 
procedures to the interested subjects in the usual care comparison group.

- 16 -4.2 Dependent Variables or Outcome Measures
Phase 1: The primary outcome measure is qualitative interview data. Interviews will be 
transcribed for analysis (see Data Handling and Statistical Analysis section for details). 
Participants will also be asked to complete the questionnaires selected for Phase 2 and provide 
feedback to the study staff regarding how well the questionnaires capture self-management of 
survivorship care.
Phase 2: The following standardize measures will be administered at baseline and immediately 
post-intervention (~6 weeks), except where noted:
Transition readiness. The Readiness for Transition Questionnaire – Survivor Version 
(RTQ)25 is a 22-item scale evaluating transition readiness for cancer survivors. Respondents are 
asked to rate the degree to which they are responsible for various aspects of their health care, 
such as knowing their survivorship care plan, scheduling visits, and filling prescriptions. They 
are separately asked to rate the degree to which their parents are responsible for managing the 
same aspects of their care. Two questions ask about the survivors’ overall perception of their 
readiness to transfer to an adult-approach to health care. The RTQ has demonstrated adequate 
reliability.25
The Transition Readiness Inventory (TRI), developed using the SMART framework,34 is 
a comprehensive measure of multiple components of transition readiness. While the RTQ 
focuses on responsibility for behaviors, the TRI focuses on behaviors and knowledge, attitudes, 
and beliefs. Specifically, the TRI yields a total score and provides scales for the following targets 
of our intervention: knowledge, self-management skills, self-efficacy for managing care, 
goals/motivation, and communication with family and providers around survivorship care. The 
TRI has shown adequate reliability and content validity,34,35and evidence of predictive validity of 
engagement in adult healthcare.[ADDRESS_582689]. PROMIS Depression and PROMIS Anxiety measures are validated 8-
item measures of depressive symptoms and anxiety. We will examine cancer-related anxiety 
using the Fear of Recurrence Scale,36 which has been used with young adult survivors of 
childhood cancers.37 Finally, we will adapt items to examine anxiety related to healthcare 
transition and cancer late effects. We will also use the Cancer Related Worry Scale to assess 
participants’ concerns related to their cancer past and future.  
Impact of Cancer. Three subscales from the Impact of Cancer – Childhood Cancer 
Survivors Scale38 will evaluate perceptions of impact on body and health, memory and thinking, 
and personal growth. Participants will be asked to complete all three subscales; mentors will be 
asked to complete body and health and personal growth only to evaluate if mentoring has 
positive effects on these outcomes.
Perseverance. The Short GRIT Scale39 is an 8-item measure of perseverance for long-
term goals. We will examine the total score as a correlate of transition readiness and adherence 
to follow-up care.
Barriers to follow-up care & adherence. We will evaluate insurance status, current 
provider, and other barriers to care with the Follow-Up Care Use and Health Outcomes of 
Cancer Survivors (FOCUS) measure. Participants will report on appointments, cancer 
screenings, and other adherence markers.

participants for supervision with the PI. Additionally, 10% of tapes will be randomly selected for 
treatment integrity review using a checklist of the core components of each session.
Mentor/Participant Alliance. A brief measure of personality (Ten Item Personality 
Inventory40) will be administered to participants and mentors at baseline only to examine 
whether personality matching relates to perceived relationship alliance. A brief measure of the 
alliance between the mentor and participant (Working Alliance Inventory – Short Form41) will be 
completed by [CONTACT_455771]-intervention only.
Satisfaction with Intervention. At the [ADDRESS_582691] Questionnaire measures perceived effectiveness in improving targeted 
skills. The Adherence Questionnaire measures barriers to engagement. Objective user data (i.e., 
log-ins, posts, modules completed) will be obtained unobtrusively from Canvas. Peer mentors 
will be given an interview (i.e., Peer Mentor Interview) at the end of the program to assess their 
thoughts about the program (what went well, did not work well, etc.) The participants will also 
be asked to do a brief (~20 minute) phone exit interview with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_455751] (see Participant Exit Interview 
Guide). 
Phase 3A: The primary outcome measure is qualitative interview data and participant report on a 
brief standardized internet-based intervention evaluation tool, the Visual Aesthetics of Websites 
Inventory. Notes will be taken during usability sessions. 
Phase 3B: Feasibility outcomes include treatment fidelity, satisfaction, acceptability, 
usability/engagement with the online modules, and acceptance/engagement with the peer mentor. 
These will be measured via survey and objective user analytics for the online modules. 
Behavioral outcomes include transition readiness, fear of recurrence, barriers to follow-up care, 
adherence to follow-up care, adherence to general healthcare practice recommendations, self-
efficacy (i.e., general, survivorship care specific, health insurance, communication, managing 
emotions), perceived emotional and informational support, perceived stigma/shame associated 
with cancer survivorship, healthcare utilization behaviors, and health behaviors (i.e., tobacco, 
alcohol, exercise, sedentary). The survey consists of validated measures of each construct or 
items drawn from validated instruments including the BRFSS 201840, NHANES 2013-
201441, HINTS44, and CCSS45. The table below indicates the items and time points for 
administration. 
At the last follow-up, we will also ask participants to sign medical record release forms to share 
medical information from their cancer-related physician(s) and primary care physician(s) to 
verify healthcare utilization during the study period. These forms will be available to participants 
either via regular mail, along with a postage-paid return envelope, and/or a link to the electronic

program evaluation ratings when they have completed mentoring their last mentee (Mentor 
Survey 2). After completing the final call with each mentee, they will be asked to complete the 
Working Alliance Inventory – Short Form41 regarding their relationship with the mentee. 
4.3 Risk of Harm 
Phase 1: Risks are considered minimal and include breach of confidentiality. Every effort will be 
made to ensure confidentiality of data. 
Phase 2: Risks are considered minimal and include breach of confidentiality. Every effort will be 
made to ensure confidentiality of data. Peer mentors will be instructed in the importance of 
maintaining confidentiality and supervised by [CONTACT_978]. Surveys will ask about self-management 
skills, transition readiness, anxiety, barriers to care, and adherence to follow-up 
recommendations. Although discomfort related to such questions is unlikely, participants can 
choose not to answer any question for any reason and may withdraw at any time. 
Phase 3A: (same as Phase 1) Risks are considered minimal and include breach of confidentiality. 
Every effort will be made to ensure confidentiality of data.
Phase 3B: (same as Phase 2) Risks are considered minimal and include breach of confidentiality. 
Every effort will be made to ensure confidentiality of data. Peer mentors will be instructed in the 
importance of maintaining confidentiality and supervised by [CONTACT_978]. Surveys will ask about self-
management skills, transition readiness, fear of recurrence, self-efficacy, barriers to care, 
adherence to follow-up recommendations, and health behaviors. Although discomfort related to 
such questions is unlikely, participants can choose not to answer any question for any reason and 
may withdraw at any time.
4.4 Potential for Benefit
Phase 1: There is no direct benefit to participants.
Phase 2: There may or may not be a direct benefit to participants. All participants will receive 
information regarding self-management that may be useful to participants but the study will 
evaluate the feasibility of implementing the interventions as well as participant-reported 
satisfaction and relevant quality of life outcomes.
Phase 3A: There is no direct benefit to participants.
Phase 3B: There may or may not be a direct benefit to participants, as we do not yet know if the 
intervention is better than usual care.
5.   Data Handling and Statistical Analysis
Phase 1 (Aim 1): 
Data Management: Digital recordings will be transferred off of the recorders to the PI’s secure 
shared drive as soon as possible following the interview and then erased from the recorder. 
Transcription will be completed as soon as possible, removing any identifiable information. All 
transcriptions will be labeled with a subject number rather than any identifiable information. 
Digital recordings will be deleted after they are described and checked for accuracy. Paper 
questionnaires will be labeled with an ID number and stored separately from consent forms in a

- 20 -locked cabinet in the PI’s locked office. The key linking subject names and subject numbers will 
be stored electronically on the PI’s password-protected CINJ internal shared drive and destroyed 
at the end of the study.
Data Analysis: Qualitative data will be analyzed using content analysis, following the framework 
approach described by [CONTACT_455773].44 Specifically, themes will be identified based on 
the a priori theoretical framework (SMART model). Data will be constantly compared to 
evaluate fit to the model and new themes that emerge from participants’ data will be added to the 
model. An index of themes will be created and applied systematically to the data using NVivo, a 
qualitative data analysis software. Data analysis will continue until theme saturation occurred 
(that is, no new themes emerge from additional participants). Participant feedback on 
questionnaires will be used to determine if any changes are needed to the outcome measures for 
Phase 2 of the study.
Phase 2 (Aims 2 & 3): 
Data Management: The Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey has a contract and Business 
Associate Agreement with TigerText to supply HIPAA-compliant secure messaging services and 
archiving of messages. TigerText will be used for secure text messaging with participants and 
between mentors/mentees. TigerText uses AES-256/SSL encryption and exercises a number of 
physical, technical, and administrative safeguards to protect all messages and data. At the 
application layer, TigerText uses Secure Socket Layers (SSL) to encrypt all communication 
between the web browser and the data center, and a processing pi[INVESTIGATOR_455752]. TigerText partners with Sonian to archive the 
messages between participants, which will be used for supervision of mentors and for content 
analysis to determine how mentors and mentees communicated during the study. The archived 
message data will be accessed and downloaded by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_455753]’s password-protected CINJ internal 
shared drive. These data will be labeled with an ID number rather than participant name [CONTACT_455782]. All interactions in the TigerText system are included in the audit logs to ensure that 
administrators are properly using the web portal and it’s services. 
Databases for participant recruitment and tracking and participant survey data will be developed 
in collaboration with the CINJ Population Science Research Support Core using HIPAA-
compliant DatStat software. The Core provides access to the DatStat software, facilitates initial 
study setup, and assists in the event of any technical problem in using the DatStat software. 
Approval for use of this software in research studies has been provided by [CONTACT_455774] (IRB). (The approval process 
included: obtaining a Technology Professional Service Agreement and a Business Associate 
Agreement from DatStat; the approval of a Security Questionnaire from the Rutgers Office of 
Information Technology; and the completion of a Security Risk and Assessment Tool by [CONTACT_455775].) The software allows for research study 
personnel to be assigned data access and privileges specific to their role on the study. Study team 
members are given access to the minimum amount of data needed to perform their role on the 
study. 
Online surveys will be completed by [CONTACT_87597] a secure website (hosted on DatStat 
servers). DatStat secure servers are registered with site certificates provided by [CONTACT_455776]20150001955

his/her responses are encrypted while in-transit between the browser and DatStat's server using 
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and 40, 56, or 128-bit Public Key Encryption. All servers used for 
data collection are highly fault-tolerant and equipped with redundant, hot-pluggable power 
supplies, redundant network interfaces, and RAID 5 hot-swappable disk storage. All primary 
servers are plugged into a monitored, uninterruptible power supply (UPS). DatStat servers are 
stored in a locked server cabinet/rack, which are housed in a state-of-the-art, well-ventilated data 
center. Physical access to servers and data backup is restricted to a minimal number of 
information technology professionals. The servers are secured with physical and firewall 
security. 
Participants will complete surveys online or via paper (depending on participants’ choice). Paper 
surveys will be identified using only a subject number and will be entered into the database by 
[CONTACT_455777] a locked filing cabinet accessible only be authorized study staff. We will 
keep a separate electronic key linking codes and subject names on the PI’s department drive. 
This key will be destroyed at the end of the study. De-identified data will be kept indefinitely. 
Audio files of video/phone calls between peer mentors and mentees will be recorded using the 
peer mentor’s handheld audio recorder. The peer mentor will then use Rutgers Large File 
Transfer Service (LiFT) to securely upload the files for the study team to review. This service 
allows both internal and external users to upload files securely with their email and password. 
The peer mentors will be instructed to destroy the files after they have successfully uploaded 
files to Rutgers LiFT for study team to review. Peer mentors will receive training on how to 
securely transfer the files and delete the files from their devices during the mandatory in-person 
peer mentor training. The study team will download the files via the secure LiFT service and 
store them on the Rutgers secure shared drive accessed via a password-protected computer. For 
participant exit interviews, study staff will record the interview, transfer to the secure shared 
drive (access limited to pertinent research team members). Recordings will be transcribed as 
soon as possible, removing any identifying information from the written document. Recordings 
will be destroyed upon completion of the study procedures. 
Data Analysis: We will examine feasibility through study enrollment rates, retention rates, 
reasons for study drop out, adherence to the intervention, and patient and mentor satisfaction 
with the program. Descriptive analyses (frequencies, means) will be used to evaluate our 
hypotheses regarding expected enrollment (>50%), retention (>75%), and completion of 
intervention sessions (>75%). We based these predictions using the literature describing barriers 
to recruiting AYA participants45 and the team’s collective experience in intervention 
development and implementation.
To assess the preliminary outcomes of the peer mentor self-management program, we 
will evaluate whether participants in the program demonstrate improvement in transition 
readiness and the impact of cancer, and reductions in symptoms of depression and anxiety. We 
will also explore adherence outcomes. We will compare scores on outcome measures at the end 
of 6-week assessment using dependent/paired t-tests. Since the primary purpose of this project is 
to evaluate feasibility, we recognize that we do not have adequate power to detect small to 
medium statistical effects. Exit interviews will be reviewed to identify strengths of the 
intervention, weaknesses of the intervention, and ideas to improve the intervention.

Data Management: Usability testing notes will be labeled with an ID number without any 
identifying data. The Visual Aesthetics of Websites Inventory will only be labeled with an ID 
number. The key linking subject names and subject numbers will be stored electronically on the 
PI’s password-protected CINJ internal shared drive and destroyed at the end of the study.
Data Analysis: The research team will discuss user experience difficulties with the design team 
for changes during the iterative cycles of usability testing. Given the preliminary work already 
conducted, we expect 12-20 sessions will achieve data saturation (i.e., no new issues emerge 
according to pre-specified stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418]). Responses to the Visual Aesthetics of Websites 
Inventory will be summarized with descriptive statistics (e.g., means, frequencies of responses).
Phase 3B:
Data Management: The same procedures used in Phase [ADDRESS_582694] (previously called TigerText) will be used for secure messaging as 
well as secure videoconferencing (instead of doxy.me). Additionally, TigerConnect now allows 
for secure file transfer so that peer mentors can securely transfer audio recordings to the study 
team either via Rutgers LiFT or TigerConnect. For participants who consent to be contact[CONTACT_34745], the study team will store their contact [CONTACT_455778]’s secure One Drive, with access granted only to the PI, study coordinator, and

Data Analysis: We will examine feasibility through study enrollment rates, retention rates, 
usability/engagement with online modules and peer mentor, barriers to engagement, and reasons 
for study drop out. Descriptive analyses (frequencies, means, confidence intervals) will be used 
to evaluate hypotheses regarding enrollment (>50%), retention (>80% complete all surveys), and 
intervention completion (>75% modules/mentor calls). Multilevel modeling (MLM) will be used 
to examine differences between the intervention and usual care groups over time on transition 
readiness (RTQ Adolescent Responsibility and TRI total scores). Our primary analysis will 
consider both time and treatment to be categorical with an interaction between the two. The 
interaction will be assessed to determine whether change in transition readiness differs between 
the two groups. The MLM approach assumes any missing observations are missing at random 
but includes all observed data. Exploratory analyses of additional outcomes (e.g., self-efficacy, 
adherence to medical appointments and screenings, and health behaviors) will use the identity 
link or the logit link as appropriate for continuous or binary outcomes.

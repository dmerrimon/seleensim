[ADDRESS_307749], but  not all, patients with bipolar disorder (BPD) have clinically significant 
cognitive impairment [1, 2]. Impairment is present in both the manic and depressed 
phases of BPD, as well as in euthymic periods  [3]. The percentage of BPD patients 
with cognitive impairment (CIBD) varies among studies, with 40-60% representing 
the best estimate [3]. The weight of the evidence supports no overall difference in 
the type and severity of cognitive impairment in any phase of BPD, i.e. it is a stable 
trait feature of BPD, albeit variable from one patient to another. The most 
commonly affected cognitive domains are speed of processing, declarative 
memory, attention and working memory [3, 4]. Although CIBD is milder in severity 
than the cognitive impairment associated with  schizophrenia (CIAS), on average, 
as in schizophrenia, CIBD has a major impact on function and quality of life in most 
patients, particularly because the greater preservation of function  of BPD enables 
them to engage in activities which are more dependent on intact  cognitive function 
[5]. Thus, it is highly likely that improvement in CIBD will have valuable clinical 
benefit, especially with regard to quality of life measures. It is reasonable to predict 
that treatments effective to improve CIBD could also be beneficial for CIAS. 
Efficacy for cognitive impairment is likely to be greater in BPD than schizophrenia, 
because the baseline severity is milder in the former [6] . Despi[INVESTIGATOR_252937], there has been minimal focus on clinical trials to 
improve CIBD, perhaps because so many resources have been devoted to the 
effort to treat CIAS, but lack of appreciation of the severity of CIBD and its 
importance as a determinant of functional outcome in BPD may be the most 
important factors.  
In a recent  study of CIBD, using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery 
(MCCB), impairment was found in both treatment resistant BP I and II depressed 
inpatients within all MCCB domains [4]. The greatest impairment was evident in 
speed of processing, declarative memory and attention.  The impairment was 
numerically greater in BP I than BP II patients but the difference was not significant.  
Compared to normal controls, the deficits, in BP [ADDRESS_307750] some domains of cognition in

severity of cognitive impairment in major depression or BPD [8].
2.1.2 Preclinical  Rationale for Studying JNJ-18038683 to treat CIBD and CIAS 
Serotonin (5-HT) 7 receptors  are one of 14 5-HT receptors. This Gs-protein coupled 
receptor is widely distributed in brain, with high density in the thalamus, 
hypothalamus, hippocampus, suprachiasmatic nucleus, amygdala and septum, 
with lower levels in the cerebral cortex. The HTR7, is positively coupled to 
adenylate cyclase (as are the dopamine (DA) D 1, 5-HT 4 and 5-HT 6 receptors), and 
has aroused considerable interest as a target for drugs to treat depression, as well 
as some for cognitive impairment and psychosis [9-11]. For example, there has 
been considerable interest in 5-HT 7 antagonists as stand-alone antidepressants 
[10, 12, 13] or as contributor to multireceptor antidepressant drugs [14-16]. JNJ 
[ADDRESS_307751] been reported to 
be effective antidepressants in a variety of animal models, including tail suspension 
[13]. JNJ-[ADDRESS_307752] by [CONTACT_252962] 5-HT efflux in a microdialysis study.  In a failed clinical trial, 
JNJ-18038683 did not differentiate from placebo, but the active comparator also 
did not differentiate, possibly because of a high placebo response rate. Importantly, 
no safety concerns emerged for the compound [13]. 
Of key  relevance to this proposal, 5-HT [ADDRESS_307753]  been 
shown to be active in animal models of psychosis, learning, and memory [10]. 5-
HT7 receptor blockade has been postulated to be a  key component of the cognitive 
enhancement due to atypi[INVESTIGATOR_252938], e.g. amisulpride, clozapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], lurasidone, and 
risperidone, which are potent 5-HT 7 antagonists [17-19] and as a stand-alone 
cognitive enhancer [20]. We will report key additional evidence in the Preliminary 
Studies section. With regard to animal models of antipsychotic activity, the 
selective 5-HT [ADDRESS_307754], SB-258471, prevented the disruption of prepulse 
inhibition (PPI) in phencyclidine (PCP)-but not amphetamine-treated rats, 
indicating positive influence on the glutamate, but not DA, component of PPI, a 
model of the sensory gating deficit in BPD and schizophrenia which has bearing 
upon antipsychotic activity and attention, a key component of CIBD [9]. However, 
the selective, 5-HT [ADDRESS_307755] SB269970 [21] was able to reverse the effect of 
amphetamine to disrupt PPI [INVESTIGATOR_2993] C57BL/6 mice [9]. It has been reported that SB-
[ADDRESS_307756] dizocilpline (MK-
801)-induced deficits in the delayed non-matching to position task, a measure of 
working memory, but augmented the deficit induced by [CONTACT_252963], a 
muscarinic antagonist [22]. These authors also showed that SB-269970 
normalized MK-801-induced glutamate but not DA efflux in the prefrontal cortex.  
SB269970 improved reference memory in a radial arm maze [9, 12] and a PCP-
induced reversal learning deficit in rats [23]. SB-656104-A, another 5-HT 7

[ADDRESS_307757] alone and with a subeffective dose of 
lurasidone [24]. Sarkisyan and Hedlund [25] reported a deficit in spatial memory in 
a novel location test in 5-HT [ADDRESS_307758] found no deficit in novel location in HTR7 knock out mice.  In a 
recent publication, Andressen et al There is some conflicting evidence about the 
role of 5-HT 7 antagonism in cognition. 5-HT 7 agonism has been suggested to be 
an effective target for improvement of cognitive impairment in aging mice and in 
an Alzheimer’s mouse model, as the 5-HT [ADDRESS_307759] blocked by [CONTACT_144498]269970 [26]. Gasbarri et 
al [27] suggested that the role of the 5-HT 7 receptor in cognition will vary depending 
upon the task and brain regions involved.  Eriksson et al [28] suggested that 5-HT 7 
receptor blockade can intensify impairments in emotional memory that are induced 
by 5-HT 1A receptor stimulation. 
2.1.3 Preclinical  Evidence:
The predominant  strategy to develop pharmacologic treatments for CIAS and by 
[CONTACT_66250], CIBD, relies upon ameliorating cognitive impairment induced in rodent 
models which have some relation to the psychotic spectrum disorders, especially 
drug- or transgenic-induced abnormalities in cognition. Evidence from animal 
models suggests that serotonin (5-HT) 7 receptor(R) antagonism is a promising 
target to treat CIBD and CIAS. We have extensively studied SB-269970, the 
protypi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 5-HT [ADDRESS_307760], in the sub-chronic (sc) phencyclidine (PCP) 
rat and mouse models of CIAS.  PCP, an NMDAR antagonist, is widely studied for 
this purpose because of the extensive evidence that abnormalities in glutamate 
and GABA neurotransmission in cortex and hippocampus may be the prime cause 
of CIAS. Acute or scPCP produces a wide range of documented deficits in NMDAR 
and GABA neurotransmission. We recently reported that SB269970 (0.1-1 mg/kg) 
dose-dependently reversed scPCP-induced novel object recognition (NOR) 
deficits in rats [17]. NOR is a model of human declarative memory. We have 
replicated these results in mice treated with PCP or ketamine for 7 days and 
washed out 7 days or longer (Figure 1).  SB-269970 can also reverse PCP-induced 
deficits in novel location detection. Our data contrasts with results from the 
Hedlund lab.  In addition, we reported that the ability of two atypi[INVESTIGATOR_252939] (APDs), lurasidone (0.1 mg/kg) and amisulpride (3 mg/kg), to reverse the 
NOR deficit was blocked by [CONTACT_3252]-treatment with the 5-HT [ADDRESS_307761], AS19, 
(5-10 mg/kg). None of these compounds affect NOR in naive rats.   There is also 
extensive evidence supporting the cognitive benefits from 5-HT [ADDRESS_307762] many studies with these mice which replicate the results with SB-269970, 
including prevention of the NOR deficit produced by [CONTACT_252964]-chronic PCP 
(Figure 2).   In addition, the 5-HT 7 knockout mice, from adolescence to adulthood,

Function:
Reversal learning:  See Abdul-Monim et al., and Brigman et al., [29, 30] for 
detailed methodology . Apart from the declarative memory deficits, there is a range 
of cognitive deficits in  BPD and schizophrenia, including impaired executive 
functioning [31], which can be assessed by [CONTACT_252965] [32]. We found that both JNJ-18038683 and SB269970 (4 mg/kg) were 
able to reverse sub-chronic PCP induced decrease in percentage correct 
responding in the reversal phase of the task (Figure 4). 
2.[ADDRESS_307763] a randomized, placebo- controlled parallel, 
design study to assess the effects of JNJ-18038683 on multiple domains of 
cognition and mood symptoms.  Since our preclinical studies show that 5-HT 7 
receptor blockade is highly effective in improving declarative memory in rodents, 
the declarative memory measures will be the primary outcome measures.  As 
previously discussed Andressen et. al [39] noted differential functional selectivity 
of the 5-HT 7 receptor, suggesting that the effects of atypi[INVESTIGATOR_252940] 5-
HT7 antagonism, such as lurasidone, ziprasidone and risperidone, are modulated 
via different HTR 7 subunits than JNJ1083868. In light of this new information, we 
proposed to allow some individuals currently prescribed treatment with atypi[INVESTIGATOR_252941] 5-HT 7 antagonism to be eligible for screening and randomization.  1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 [PHONE_5257]

The declarative  verbal memory subscales will be the primary endpoints. 
Secondary outcome measures will include cognition composite score, the 
MADRS total score (for those with a MADRS score between 8 and 20 at the time 
of enrollment) and individual scores for each of the other neuropsychological 
tests. We will assess JNJ-[ADDRESS_307772] on drug tolerability as determined by 
[CONTACT_716]: body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and 
movement rating scales.

12 Version  Date 02.04.2019Study visits  will include screening and 6 visits (baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8). 
Please see Appendix 1 – Schedule of Assessments
At screening,  the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnosis for DSM Disorders 
(SCID) will be completed for confirmation of psychiatric diagnosis. A 
medical/psychiatric history will also be collected and a physical exam will be 
performed. Vital signs including weight, height, waist and hip measurement will be 
obtained at screening to record body mass index. The Hopkins Verbal Learning 
Test (HVLT) and Trail Making Test A (TMT-A), will be administered to screen for 
severity of cognitive impairment.  Only individuals who score between the 25th and 
75th percentile as compared to normative data on these tasks will be enrolled.  
If the  subject is determined eligible during the screening procedure, which can last 
for up to two weeks, a baseline visit will be scheduled. Baseline assessments of 
cognitive function, psychopathology and global function will be administered along 
with movement ratings at the baseline visit.  Functional outcome will be assessed 
with Specific Level of Function Scale (SLOF) [33]. Adverse events will be collected 
and recorded from the time the subject signs the informed consent to the final 
safety follow-up visit, and motor side effects will be monitored by [CONTACT_252968]: baseline, Weeks [ADDRESS_307773] dose adjustment for intolerance, based upon 
investigator judgment. No antipsychotic drugs which are 5-HT 7 antagonists will be 
permitted to avoid effects upon 5-HT 7 receptors from enhanced 5-HT 
concentrations and possible down regulation of 5-HT 7 receptors. As JNJ-
18038683 is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2D6, there will be a 2 week washout 
period requested after the trial prior to initiation of any CYP2D6 substrates (see 
Appendix 2).
Individuals will  be asked to return to the clinic at study weeks 1, 2, 4, and 6 after 
baseline to monitor for side effects and compliance. At the Week 4 visit, efficacy 
assessments will be completed (MADRS, YMRS and CGI-BP). Between clinic 
visits, research staff will complete phone calls with individuals at study Weeks 3, 
5, and 7. Individuals will return for a final study visit [ADDRESS_307774] 4 
weeks after the final visit and safety assessments will be completed (C-SSRS, 
Adverse Events, Concomitant Medications). The assessments completed at 
baseline will be repeated at this Week 8 visit (See Appendix 1 – Schedule of 
Assessments). Reasons for early termination will be recorded. Every effort will be 
made to obtain appropriate rating scale data at the final visit of early terminators.

9.2 Randomization  Method:
Those who  meet the study inclusion criteria will be randomized into one of two 
treatment groups, one to receive adjunctive therapy of JNJ-18038683 and the 
other to receive placebo.  Individuals will be stratified for randomization as either 
being treated with an AD or not being treated with an AD. Using SAS software, a 
computer-generated randomization sequences for each treatment arm will be 
assigned using permuted block method limiting imbalance in numbers between 
groups. To assign the randomization, the SAS procedure PROC PLAN will be 
used [34]. Until the trial is concluded, the randomization sequence will be blind to 
the study participants as well as the Principal Investigator, research coordinators

9.3 Adverse  Events
In a 7  week, randomized, placebo controlled trial comparing JNJ-18038683 with 
placebo and escitalopram (an active comparator), a total of 6 serious adverse 
events were reported during the study (placebo group: spontaneous abortion and 
suicidal ideation; escitalopram group: spontaneous abortion, suicidal ideation, 
suicide attempt, and chest discomfort). A total of 10 individuals (3 in the placebo 
group, 4 in the JNJ-18038683 group, and 3 in the escitalopram group) were 
withdrawn from the study prematurely due to adverse events. The 4 events 
leading to drop out of individuals on JNJ-18038683 were one instance each of 
the following: bundle branch block, panic attack, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416], and 
insomnia.  
Only 3  individuals receiving the 20-mg dose of JNJ 18038683 required dose 
reductions at any point during the study.
IRB #: STU00200919 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 3/8/2021 through 3/7/2022.
14 Version  Date 02.04.2019Adverse events  that were reported in more than 5% of individuals in any 
treatment group included headache, nausea, nasopharyngitis, insomnia, 
somnolence, dyspepsia, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation, diarrhea, vomiting, 
back pain, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], and fatigue. The 
treatment-emergent adverse events that were reported more frequently in the 
JNJ [ADDRESS_307777] infection, and palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814]. 
9.3.1 Contraindications:  
None known
9.3.2 Special  Warnings and Precautions for Use
JNJ-18038683 is  an investigational drug, with safety data available from 
nonclinical animal studies, as well as single and multiple dose clinical studies in 
healthy volunteers. 
All individuals  should be closely monitored by [CONTACT_252971], vital 
signs, ECGs, and clinical laboratory safety tests of blood and urine. 
The liver,  lung, prostate, mammary gland, hematologic system, and thymus in 
rats (mainly at high dose), and the hematologic system and spleen in dogs, were 
identified as potential target organs for JNJ-18038683 in repeat-dose oral toxicity 
studies (see Other Effects in Investigator Brochure). Female animals appeared to 
be more susceptible than males.
Thus far  in clinical trials, there have been no laboratory abnormalities of concern, 
but the following safety tests should be monitored:
Hematologic  parameters: red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin, hematocrit, 
unconjugated bilirubin, reticulocyte, and platelet counts;
Liver function:  aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), 
gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT), prothrombin time, total bilirubin, lactic 
dehydrogenase, serum albumin, and protein.
9.3.3 Interaction  with other medications
After single  and multiple doses of JNJ-18038683, limited or no inhibition of 
CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 activity may be expected, while moderate inhibition of 
CYP2C19 activity, and strong inhibition of CYP2D6 activity may be likely. JNJ-
18038683 increased the rate of T4 glucuronidation. There was no induction of 
CYPs 1A2, 3A4, 2C9, and 2C19 by [CONTACT_206178]-18038683.
9.3.4 Adverse  Event Monitoring
Adverse event  data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every 
clinical trial, are done to ensure the safety of individuals enrolled in the studies as 
IRB #: STU00200919 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 3/8/2021 through 3/7/2022.
[ADDRESS_307778] be reported in an expedited manner to 
allow for optimal monitoring of patient safety and care. 
All individuals  experiencing an adverse event, regardless of its relationship to 
study drug, will be monitored until: 
 the  adverse event resolves or the symptoms or signs that constitute the 
adverse event return to baseline; 
 any  abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline; 
 there is  a satisfactory explanation other than the study drug for the 
changes observed; or
 death.
9.3.5 Definitions
[IP_ADDRESS] Definition  of Adverse Event
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient receiving 
study treatment and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an experimental intervention, whether or not related to 
the intervention. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity  of Adverse Events
The severity  of an AE is graded as follows:
Mild (grade 1):  the event causes discomfort without disruption of normal daily 
activities.
Moderate (grade 2):  the event causes discomfort that affects normal daily 
activities.
Severe (grade  3): the event makes the patient unable to perform normal daily 
activities or significantly  affects his/her clinical status.
Life-threatening (grade 4):  the patient was at risk of death at the time of the 
event.
Fatal (grade  5): the event caused death.
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious  Adverse Events
A “serious”  adverse event is defined in regulatory terminology as any untoward 
medical occurrence that:
IRB #: STU00200919 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 3/8/2021 through 3/7/2022.
16 Version  Date 02.04.2019 Results  in death.
If  death results from (progression of) the disease, the disease 
should be reported as event (SAE) itself.
 Is  life-threatening.
(the  patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not 
refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe).
 Requires in-patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9959] ≥ 24 hours.
 Results  in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.
 Is  a congenital anomaly/birth defect
 Is  an important medical event
Any event that  does not meet the above criteria, but that in the judgment of the 
investigator jeopardizes the patient, may be considered for reporting as a serious 
adverse event. The event may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in the definition of “Serious Adverse Event“. 
For example:  allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home; convulsions that may not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; 
development of drug abuse or drug dependency.
9.3.6 Steps  to Determine If an Adverse Event Requires Expedited 
Reporting
Step 1 : Identify the type of adverse event  
Step 2 : Grade the adverse event 
Step 3 : Determine whether the adverse event is related to the protocol therapy 
Attribution categories  are as follows:
- Definite  – The AE is clearly related to the study treatment.
- Probable  – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.
- Possible – The  AE may be related to the study treatment.
- Unrelated  – The AE is clearly NOT related to the study treatment.
Note: This includes  all events that occur within [ADDRESS_307779] dose 
of treatment and is attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent(s) 
must also be reported accordingly.
Step 4 : Determine the prior experience of the adverse event. 
IRB #: STU00200919 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 3/8/2021 through 3/7/2022.
[ADDRESS_307780] been previously identified as resulting from 
administration of the agent. An adverse event is considered unexpected, for 
expedited reporting purposes only, when either the type of event or the severity 
of the event is not listed in:
 the  current known adverse events listed in the Agent Information Section 
of this protocol;
 the  GRAS dossier for the supplement;
9.3.7 Reporting  Requirements for Adverse Events
Expedited Reporting
 The  Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_9960] [ADDRESS_307781] administration of the study drug. 
 The  investigator or site personnel will inform Janssen within 24 hours of 
notification of any serious adverse event by [CONTACT_36984], with follow-up with a 
written narrative of the event within 48 hours.
 The  Northwestern University Institutional Review Board must be notified 
within 10 business days of “any unanticipated problems involving risk to 
individuals or others” 
The following  events meet the definition of Unanticipated Problem Reporting 
(UPR):
1. Any  serious event (injuries, side effects, deaths or other problems), which 
in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_89644], involved risk to 
individuals or others, and was possibly related to the research procedures.
2. Any  serious accidental or unintentional change to the IRB-approved 
protocol that alters the level of risk.
3. Any  deviation from the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate 
apparent immediate hazard to a research subject.
4. Any  new information (e.g., publication, safety monitoring report, updated 
sponsor safety report), interim result or other finding that indicates an unexpected 
change to the risk/benefit ratio for the research.
5. Any  breach in confidentiality that may involve risk to the subject or others.
6. Any  complaint of a subject that indicates an unanticipated risk or that 
cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_079].
 The  FDA will be notified within 7 business days of any unexpected fatal or 
life-threatening adverse event with possible relationship to study drug, and 15 
business days of any event that is considered: 1) serious, 2) unexpected, and 3) 
at least possibly related to study participation.
IRB #: STU00200919 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 3/8/2021 through 3/7/2022.
18 Version  Date 02.04.2019Routine Reporting
 All  other adverse events- such as those that are expected, or are unlikely 
or definitely not related to the study participation- are to be reported annually to 
the Northwestern IRB as part of regular data submission.
9.3.[ADDRESS_307782] has completed all study 
procedures and the data has been locked. Emergency unblinding is expected to 
be infrequent.
Emergency unblinding should  occur only if the principal investigator (or other 
treating physician) considers breaking the blind medically relevant. All individuals 
who have the blind broken will be discontinued from the study. Documentation of 
the reasons for unblinding, including date and time will be recorded in the source 
documents and the electronic case report form (eCRF).
9.4 Study  Materials 
9.4.1 Structured Clinical  Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) 
The SCID-CT  is a short semi-structured interview. With an administration time of 
approximately [ADDRESS_307783] 2 years of experience with the population 
under study. The results of this assessment will be used to confirm the diagnosis 
of bipolar disorder I or II and rule out any exclusionary diagnosis. The SCID will be 
administered at the screening visit. 
9.4.2 Cognition battery  
The “Cleveland”  cognition battery will be administered in this trial, which the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_252945] 30+ years as measures of the following cognitive 
domains: executive functioning, speed of processing, attention/vigilance, working 
memory, verbal learning, visual learning, reasoning and problem solving
This battery includes  the following assessments:
 Wisconsin  Card Sorting Test (WCST)
 Digit  Symbol Task
 Rey  Auditory Verbal Learning Test (Rey-AVLT)
 WISC-III  Mazes
 Category  Fluency Test
 Verbal  Fluency
 Brown-Peterson  Consonant Trigram Memory Task
IRB #: STU00200919 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 3/8/2021 through 3/7/2022.
19 Version  Date 02.04.2019The cognition  battery will be administered at baseline and end of study. 
9.4.3 Montgomery  Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) [35] - 
The MADRS  will be utilized to assess a subject’s level of depressive symptoms 
and must be administered using a structured interview guide. This scale consists 
of 10 items each with 7 defined grades of severity
9.4.4 Young Mania  Rating Scale (YMRS) [36]- 
The YMRS  consists of [ADDRESS_307784]’s subjective report of his or her clinical condition. Additional 
information is based upon clinical observations made during the course of the 
clinical interview. Each item has 5 defined categories of severity with 4 items 
graded on a 0 to 8 scale (irritability, speech, content, and disruptive-aggressive 
behavior) and 7 items graded on a 0 to 4 scale.
9.4.6 Clinical  Global Impression Scale – Bipolar (CGI-BP) [37] - 
The CGI-BP  scale refers to the global impression of the subject with respect to 
bipolar disorder. The scale rates the subject’s Severity of Illness (CGI-BP-
Severity: mania, depression, and overall bipolar illness) and Change from 
Preceding Phase (CGI-BP Change from Preceding Phase: mania, depression, 
and overall bipolar illness) based on a 7-point scale. Severity of Illness (CGI-BP-
Severity) will be rated at the baseline visit. The Change from Preceding Phase 
(CGI-BP Change from Preceding Phase) will be rated at the end of study visit 
(Week 9).
9.4.7 Specific Levels  of Functioning (SLOF) [33] -
The SLOF is a  clinician-rated assessment that evaluates functional behaviors in 
the context of the individual’s skills and abilities. It consists of 43 items 
categorized into 6 subscales: Physical functioning; Personal care skills; 
Interpersonal relationships; Social acceptability; Activities of community living; 
and Work skills. Each question is rated on a 5-point scale. The higher the total 
score, the better the overall functioning of the subject. According to the original 
version of the scale, the time frame covered by [CONTACT_252972]. 
While an informant is not required for this trial, access to a person that can 
provide collateral (caseworker, caregiver, etc.) is preferred, as the SLOF asks 
them for any other relevant information, and also includes a rating for how well 
the informant knows the subject. The SLOF will be performed at the baseline and 
end of study visits. 
9.4.[ADDRESS_307785] be performed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1461] (or a licensed 
medical practitioner such as a physician’s assistant or nurse practitioner) listed 
on the site delegation of authority log.

20 Version  Date 02.04.2019A complete physical examination includes  the following assessments: general 
appearance, head, eyes, ears/nose/throat, neck, lymph nodes, skin, lungs, heart, 
abdomen, musculoskeletal, and neurologic evaluations. If the subject is 
discontinued for any reason during the treatment phase, every attempt should be 
made to perform a final physical examination.
9.4.9 Vital  Signs 
Arterial systolic  and diastolic blood pressure and radial artery pulse rate will be 
measured while the patient is seated at the scheduled visits designated in the 
Schedule of Events in Appendix 1. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Height  and Body Weight 
Height will  be measured at the screening visit. Patients will be measured without 
shoes. Body weight will be recorded at screening, baseline and every visit through 
the 9-week treatment phase. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Body  Mass Index (BMI) 
Body mass index  (BMI) will be determined with the patient’s height and weight at 
the screening visit and subsequent treatment visits. BMI must be calculated using 
the following formula: A person’s (Weight in pounds divided by [CONTACT_252973]) x 703. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Waist  and Hip Circumference 
Waist and  hip circumference will be recorded at screening, baseline, and all study 
visits. 
9.4.10 Electrocardiogram  (12-Lead ECG) 
The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a physician listed on the site delegation of authority log must review, 
initial, and date the report, which must be filed in the subject’s study chart. 
Results will be captured in the subject’s study chart, not in the electronic 
database. Clinically significant findings from the screening report must be 
captured in the medical history. Eligibility for study entry must be assessed by [CONTACT_28824]. Any clinically significant changes compared with baseline 
must be captured as AEs in the electronic database. 
Individuals are  to be supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] [ADDRESS_307786] resting 12-lead ECGs performed and 
interpreted. The time the ECG is performed will be recorded (using a 24-h clock). 
In addition, the time that the subject took their last dose of study medication (prior 
to the ECG) will be recorded on the CRF page.
9.4.11 Adverse  Event (AE) Monitoring 
The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a designee (eg, a licensed, qualified medical practitioner such as a 
physician’s assistant or a nurse practitioner) listed on the site delegation of 
authority log must assess the severity and relationship to study medication(s) of 
all AEs. All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or 
IRB #: STU00200919 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 3/8/2021 through 3/7/2022.
[ADDRESS_307787](s) will be recorded on 
the AE page(s) of the electronic database. 
For all  AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to 
determine the outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for 
classification as an SAE requiring immediate notification to the Sponsor or its 
designated representative. 
For all  AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by [CONTACT_252974]. The investigator is required to assess causality 
and indicate that assessment on the source document and electronic database. 
For AEs with a causal relationship to the investigational product, follow-up by [CONTACT_252975] a 
level acceptable to the investigator. 
Adverse events  (serious and non-serious) should be recorded on the source 
document and electronic medical record from the date the informed consent form 
(ICF) was signed until the end of their participation in the study, ie, the subject 
has discontinued or completed the study. 
9.4.12 Concomitant  Medications 
Concomitant Medications  will be documented using the Concomitant Medications 
form at Baseline and all study visits. 
9.4.13 Study  Medication Adherence 
Participants will  be asked about his/her medication adherence at each 
appointment. Study personnel will count and record the number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_252946]’s study medication bottles and provide immediate feedback, reinforcing 
the behaviors of patients who appear to be taking medications as prescribed and 
problem-solving with those who appear not to be. Clinicians will review with 
patients the use of pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]-minder boxes, as needed.
9.4.[ADDRESS_307788] Assessments 
Northwestern Medicine  Laboratory and South Bend Medical Foundation will be 
used for analysis of fasting lab assessments required during the study. Blood will 
be drawn from each patient at the screening visit, and at end of study as noted in 
the study Schedule of Events in Appendix 1. The tests will include: Chemistry 
panels; Hematologic parameters: red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin, hematocrit, 
unconjugated bilirubin, reticulocyte, and platelet counts; Liver function: aspartate 
transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), gamma glutamyltransferase 
(GGT), prothrombin time, total bilirubin, lactic dehydrogenase, albumin, protein, 
creatinine.  A  urine drug screen (UDS) will be obtained at screening only.
In women of childbearing  potential, serum pregnancy testing will occur at 
screening; urine pregnancy will occur at study baseline.   
IRB #: STU00200919 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 3/8/2021 through 3/7/2022.
22 Version  Date 02.04.2019Note: At  screening and throughout study participation, a positive UDS is not 
necessarily exclusionary and/or may not require a subject be withdrawn from the 
study. This decision will be per the discretion of the principal investigator.
9.5 Safety Scales 
9.5.1 Abnormal Involuntary  Movement Scale (AIMS) 
The AIMS  is a clinician-rated assessment of abnormal movements consisting of 
unobtrusive observation of the subject at rest (with shoes removed) and several 
questions or instructions directed toward the subject. Using a severity scale 
ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (severe), clinicians rate dyskinesia in several body 
regions, including the facial area, extremities, and trunk. 
9.5.[ADDRESS_307789] Visit form will be completed at all subsequent visits and telephone calls (Day 
21, Day 35, and Day 49).
10.0 Data  and Specimen Banking
Study documentation  includes all Case Report Forms, data correction forms or 
queries, source documents, Janssen-Investigator correspondence, monitoring 
logs/letters, and regulatory documents (e.g., protocol and amendments, IRB 
correspondence and approval, signed patient consent forms).
Source documents  include all recordings of observations or notations of clinical 
activities and all reports and records necessary for the evaluation and 
reconstruction of the clinical research study.
Government agency  regulations and directives require that the study investigator 
must retain all study documentation pertaining to the conduct of a clinical trial. In 
the case of a study with a drug seeking regulatory approval and marketing, these 
documents shall be retained for at least two years after the last approval of 
marketing application in an International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) 
region. In all other cases, study documents should be kept on file until three 
years after the completion and final study report of this investigational study.
11.0 Data  and Specimen Management
11.1 Data Analysis  Plan
IRB #: STU00200919 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 3/8/2021 through 3/7/2022.
23 Version  Date 02.04.2019The primary  analysis will be a mixed model repeated measures ANCOVA 
adjusting for baseline differences in dependent measures, sex and race. Missing 
data will be imputed by [CONTACT_252976]. We would also examine some variables 
categorically. 
Assumptions for  the power analysis included random assignment into one group 
receiving placebo and one JNJ-18038683. The cognitive battery, as the primary 
instrument, will be collected at baseline and at end point (8 weeks).  Using 
repeated measure ANCOVA, the time average difference in the response 
variable will be compared between groups to detect treatment difference. Based 
on Javitt et al,  2012, we assume the mean baseline verbal learning score will be 
36.2, SD 9.[ADDRESS_307790], 33 
individuals per group are required assuming 5 points improvement of the 
treatment group compared to the placebo for the desired power of 80% with 
alpha level of 0.05. We plan to recruit [ADDRESS_307791].  Null Hypothesis: D = 0. Alternative Hypothesis: D > 0 (or D < 0).

11.2 Data Management  and Monitoring/Auditing
A database  in the RedCap system will be used for data entry and will be formatted 
to simulate the hard copy data entry forms.  Once entered into this database, the 
data files can be extracted into Excel or SAS project databases, which are 
maintained on a networked directory under the direct supervision of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_252947].  Back-ups are routinely performed to assure the preservation of the 
database. Data are checked for range, consistency, missing values, etc. During 
data analysis, combined datasets are created as needed.  Data are maintained in 
the master system datasets using a source/derived data approach, where source 
datasets are maintained unmodified, while the derived datasets are modified as 
needed.  Thus, alterations that prove to be incorrect are easily rectified. The 
confidentiality of all data is maintained using the HIPAA compliance standards of 
Northwestern University. No confidential information is posted to the web under

13.0 Withdrawal  of Individuals*
Individuals can  be taken off the study treatment and/or study at any time at their 
own request, or they may be withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator for 
safety, behavioral or administrative reasons. The reason(s) for discontinuation will 
be documented and may include:
 Individual voluntarily  withdraws from treatment (follow-up permitted); 
 Individual withdraws consent (termination  of treatment and follow-up);
 Individual is unable  to comply with protocol requirements;
 Individual experiences toxicity  that makes continuation in the protocol 
unsafe;
 Physician judges  continuation on the study would not be in the patient’s best 
interest;
 Individual becomes pregnant  (pregnancy to be reported along same 
timelines as a serious adverse event).
14.0 Risks  to Individuals*
The risks  from the study procedures include:
IRB #: STU00200919 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 3/8/2021 through 3/7/2022.
25 Version  Date 02.04.2019In a 7  week, randomized, placebo controlled trial comparing JNJ-18038683 with 
placebo and escitalopram (an active comparator), a total of 6 serious adverse 
events were reported during the study (placebo group: spontaneous abortion and 
suicidal ideation; escitalopram group: spontaneous abortion, suicidal ideation, 
suicide attempt, and chest discomfort). A total of 10 individuals (3 in the placebo 
group, 4 in the JNJ-18038683 group, and 3 in the escitalopram group) were 
withdrawn from the study prematurely due to adverse events. Only 3 individuals 
receiving the 20-mg dose of JNJ 18038683 required dose reductions at any point 
during the study.
Adverse events  that were reported in more than 5% of individuals in any 
treatment group included headache, nausea, nasopharyngitis, insomnia, 
somnolence, dyspepsia, dizziness, dry mouth, constipation, diarrhea, vomiting, 
back pain, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092], palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], and fatigue. The 
treatment-emergent adverse events that were reported more frequently in the 
JNJ [ADDRESS_307794] or the psychiatric symptoms 
they experience in the case of psychiatric participants.  There may be temporary 
discomfort/ bruising at the site of venipuncture.  
It is  believed the potential benefits outweigh the risks for this trial.
In case  of a medical emergency and risk of suicidality, the study team will follow 
the emergency protocol outlined in the Appendix 3.  
15.[ADDRESS_307795]’s clinical treatment team if requested by [CONTACT_423]. 
Findings from this study may benefit others.  Participation will allow us to learn 
about the potential cognitive enhancing effects of JNJ-[ADDRESS_307796] of the study medication on the 
cognitive impairment associated with bipolar disorder (CIABP).

[ADDRESS_307797]’s rights and welfare are protected, we confirm 
the following:
The competency  of patients to give informed consent will be evaluated in a 
multifaceted manner. The majority of patients who participate in our research are 
referred to us by [CONTACT_15098].  Prior to participating in any protocol-related 
procedures, and as per the standard operating procedure, research clinicians 
explain the nature of the protocol to the patient, the risks and benefits, and the 
option not to participate in research. They have been instructed by [CONTACT_252977]. This process of 
assessment and explanation is then repeated by [CONTACT_252978], often in the presence of clinical staff, and by [CONTACT_252979]. They first do a clinical assessment to 
determine if the patient might be appropriate for the project in terms of its 
inclusion and exclusion provisions. During this clinical assessment, they do a 
mental status examination, which assesses the patient’s memory, attention, and 
thinking processes. If these are impaired to the point where the person appears 
to be unable to understand the nature of the research project, its risks and 
benefits, or the option not to participate, they will not be approached to be in 
research.  If they are not excluded for this or other reasons, e.g. patient is a risk 
to themselves or others, one of the subinvestigators on the study or the PI [INVESTIGATOR_252951], go carefully over the consent form, provide help to the 
patient, if needed, to review the written protocol and consent, ask question to the 
patient to determine their level of comprehension, and then answer all questions 
the patient may have about the study. This will often be done in the presence of a 
clinical staff member not directly connected to the research or minimally involved. 
This type of assessment is repeated as needed during the course of the protocol 
if there is a question about loss of competency, although it is expected that 
competency will increase rather than decrease because of the beneficial effects 
of the treatments. Where the research staff feels the decision as to competency 
is questionable, the patient will be excluded from research. In a few cases, we 
may ask a clinician not connected to the research to do an independent 
evaluation their decision will be decisive. 
Individuals will  be regularly evaluated for the increase of cognitive deficits.   If 
and when increased cognitive deficits emerge, the P.I. or sub-investigator will 
assess for any impairments in judgment that might affect the subject’s ability to 
judge if he or she should continue to participate.  If there are any conflicts about 
the impairment of a given patient, the P.I, Herbert Y. Meltzer, will request [CONTACT_252993], Chairman of the Feinberg School of Medicine Department of 
Psychiatry, to evaluate the patient.  [CONTACT_252994] will then independently 
determine if he believes that the patient is continuing to give consent and if 
continued participation is in the patient’s best interest.  If [CONTACT_252994] 
determines that the patient has withdrawn consent or that continuing is not in his 
or her best interest, the subject will be withdrawn from continued participation 
and referred for appropriate follow-up treatment. If and when increased cognitive 
deficits emerge in a subject at the Beacon Medical Group Behavioral Health 
IRB #: STU00200919 Approved by [CONTACT_24458] 3/8/2021 through 3/7/2022.
[ADDRESS_307798] will then independently determine if he/she believes that the patient 
is continuing to give consent and if continued participation is in the patient’s best 
interest.  
The risk  of the study is low, and are reasonable in relation to the potential 
benefits. Individuals cannot access alternative pharmacologic treatment 
for CIABP, as there is no approved treatment.
17.0 Sharing of  Results with Individuals
All information  will be kept confidential except such as is necessary to disclose in 
order to provide appropriate medical care to a study participant, in which case 
the participant will be notified and their healthcare provider will be contact[CONTACT_252980]/or fax. If a participant is found to have severe depression, they will be 
referred to appropriate health care providers. If a participant’s blood tests positive 
for Hepatitis B, local laws may require that the result be reported to local health 
authorities.

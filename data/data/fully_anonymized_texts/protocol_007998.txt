2.1 Study organization  and Responsibilities  
2.2 Clinical coordinating center  
 
The IMPROVE  trial Clinical Coordinating Center (CCC)  is directly  responsible for the monitoring 
and oversight of all fiscal,  regulatory,  clinical  and other general administration needed to 
centralize and coordinate the research endeavors of the IMPROVE  trial. The CCC is located at 
the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS)  and is led by [CONTACT_683995], Jeffrey  A. 
Glassberg MD, MA. Under the PI [INVESTIGATOR_683954] (SRC) will assist  
with the responsibilities  of the CCC.  
 
The responsibilities  of the CCC  will include:  
• protocol  and manual of operations  development  and amendments  
• facilitating and monitoring protocol  conduct  
• overseeing regulatory  compliance  
• monitoring of adverse effects  and events  
• assuring quality  control  via site audits  
• providing  annual and quarterly  reports  on the progress  of the IMPROVE  Trial 
• electing topi[INVESTIGATOR_683955] 
• participating  in the analysis  and interpretation of data 
• manuscript  preparation  and prioritization via the IMPROVE  Trial Publication Policy

Rev 11-18-15  
  
epi[INVESTIGATOR_623],  and research design (BERD) program at  ISMMS  to monitor  data collection. 
Responsibilities  of the SCC will include:  
 
• Preparation  of study documents  
SCC staff will develop:  Protocol, Manual  of Operating Procedures  (MOP), case  
report forms  (CRFs),  and QxQs  (question by [CONTACT_53007]),  which give the details  on 
answering the questions  on every  CRF).   Materials  given to participants  (brochure/copy  
of consent  form) will not mention the study  acronym “IMPROVE” to avoid  suggestive 
influence of the title. 
 
• Statistical design and sample size 
SCC statisticians  developed the statistical design  for the  study,  including the primary  
outcome,  sample size, randomization strategy,  primary  analysis  strategy, and the 
complete analysis  plan. 
 
• Training site  personnel  
SCC staff has have trained site personnel  in all aspects  of the study  related to: 
details  of the study  protocol, data collection procedures,  screening and randomization 
procedures,  submitting forms  to the SCC,  laboratory  preparation procedures,  and 
responding to queries  from the SCC.  SCC staff will also monitor each site to assure that 
the site coordinators  have completed  the required  training.  
 
• Receipt and processing of study  forms at the SCC 
SCC staff have  designed and implemented the data management  system for the 
study, including: electronic  data entry, comprehensive editing of the data and preparation 
of protocol  adherence aids,  and data extraction for analyses  related to                 
research objectives.  Data  are submitted to the SCC through REDCap,  a web-based  data 
entry  system.  All hardcopy  CRF’s  are maintained in a locked cabinet in a locked room.  
Once  hardcopy  enter s thi s storage facility , it does  not leave.  Data  are comprehensively  
edited once received  at the SCC,  prior to insertion into the main study  database.  Edit 
queries  are resolved within a few days  with the PI. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_683957]. SCC staff also enforces  patient  
confidentiality  and privacy  rules  so that PHI data are not shared inappropriately  and so 
that data are protected by [CONTACT_683996].  
 
• Monitoring study progress and data quality 
SCC staff ensures  that clinic  site staff are properly  trained, that performance of the 
required procedures  are monitored,  and that deviations  from the protocol  or from study  
norms  are investigated. Routine site monitoring reports,  including patient recruitment,  
performance  of follow -up visits,  and protocol compliance,  will be produced  at regular  
intervals.   For spi[INVESTIGATOR_038],  the SRC’s  past 10 PFT results  will be reviewed  to ensure  
reproducibility  of results.  
 
• Quality assurance procedures  
SCC staff will conduct  quality  assurance audits  for every  5 participants  enrolled in  
the study. In addition,  quality  assurance procedures  and programs  will be developed and 
implemented for laboratory  determinations,  for data collection,  and for data entry.  
 
• Randomization  
SCC staff have  developed and implemented an adaptive, biased coin,  covariate 
balanced randomization  algorithm.  The algorithm  is implemented using a windows  
laptop running the program ‘R’  which  will be carried on the IMPROVE  research cart.

After  screening for eligibility  is complete,  participants  will be randomized. The 
Randomization algorithm will  balance  participants  based on whether or not they take 
hydroxyurea  and by [CONTACT_683997] (this  
variable will be trichotomized:  0-5, 6-10,  11-15). 
 
• Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) functions and reports  
SCC staff will prepare reports  for the DSMB  and will respond to ad hoc queries  from 
the DSMB.  SCC staff developed  the study  monitoring plan, which indicates  when interim  
monitoring of the efficacy  outcomes  will be performed,  how adverse events  will be 
reported,  as well as the content  of the DSMB  reports. The DSMB  reports  will include 
tabulations  and graphical presentation of administrative data (e.g., recruitment,  
compliance with therapy  schedule,  completion  of follow -up procedures,  and submission 
of data to the SCC),  efficacy  data (e.g., primary  and secondary  outcomes  of the study,  
as required by [CONTACT_219680]),  and safety  data (e.g., the occurrence of adverse 
events  and serious  adverse events).  
 
• Statistical analysis plan 
SCC staff developed the statistical  analysis  plan, which  indicates,  in detail,  the main  
analysis  for the primary  outcome (including intention- to-treat analyses),  secondary  
analyses, and analyses  of the secondary  and safety  outcomes.  In addition,  the plan 
includes  the frequency  of DSMB  reports, and how missing data will be handled.  
 
• Collaboration  in study publications 
SCC staff will collaborate  in all study  publications,  providing statistical analysis,  
preparing the statistical methods  and results  sections  of manuscripts,  and preparing 
camera -ready  tables  and graphs.  SCC staff will also participate in the development  and 
review of abstracts  for presentations  and in the review of the statistical analysis  for 
ancillary  publications.

5.2 Screening potential  participants  in the ED 
5.2.1 Overview  
 
As stated  in the protocol,  in addition to clinic,  potential participants  will be identified in the ED. 
 
In the ED, subjects  will be identified by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_541741]. The RC will ask the treating physician for 
permission to approach the patient.  The RC will approach the patient  in a private  area conducive  
to private conversation (drawing the curtain in the ED).  If the patient  meets  eligibility  criteria  (see 
5.1.2) and expresses  interest  in participating in the study,  the RC will take the patient’s  contact  
[CONTACT_3031] (two phone numbers,  address  and email)  to contact  [CONTACT_260900] a later date to 
Manual of Operating  Procedures  
[ADDRESS_926353]  
information will be recorded in CRF 1 – Contact  [CONTACT_7171]. The patient  will be given  information  
about the study  (study  brochure),  and informed that there will be financial incentives for 
participating  (metro -cards  and gift cards  at each visit).

• . 
• The RC will  monitor  the tracking board for indicators  that a patient  has SCD (chief  complaint 
contains  the word  ‘sickle’ or chief compliant  contains the word  ‘crisis’)  
• Once  a patient  has been identified,  the RC will ask the treating physician for permission to 
approach the patient.  
• The RC approaches patient  in an area conducive  to private conversation (private  room  or 
curtain pulled).  
• RC explains  that they are collecting contact  [CONTACT_683999] a clinical trial of a treatment  for SCD.  
• If the pat ient expresses  interest,  RC records  contact [CONTACT_684000] 1 – Contact  [CONTACT_5628]. 
• Completed CRF’s  are stored in the IMPROVE  folder in a locked cabinet  in [CONTACT_684026]’s 
office.  
• The RC will enter CRF data into an encrypted  Microsoft Access database and make  weekly  
calls to prospective participants to arrange for an initial visit at the SCD clinic  where the 
patient may be enrolled.  In the event  that the patient  does  not wish to follow in clinic  but 
wants  to participate in the study, a non-clinical  visit in a private consultation room in the ED 
will be arranged.  
• The RC will record  de-identified information  about  each individual on CRF 10.

• Admitted or discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_683960] 7 days  
• Patient is pregnant  or planning to become pregnant  during the duration of the study.  
 
5.3.[ADDRESS_926355]  in participating in the study, the RC will bring the patient  to a 
private area and ask questions  in CRF 3 – Screening Form. Completed CRF 3 forms  will be 
destroyed once the patient’s  eligibility  has been determined.  If eligibility  criteria  are met on CRF 
[ADDRESS_926356],  the RC will  then check  EPIC for documentation 
that the patient  has Hb SS or Sβthalassemia0 and that the individual is not prescribed any 
asthma medications. If these  criteria  are met, the patient will be randomized.  
 
 
5.3.4 Rando
mization and Enrollment 
[IP_ADDRESS] Overview  
Individuals  who meet  inclusion/exclusion criteria  will then be consented and randomized.  
The enrollment  procedure is designed to maintain blinding of the participant, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_683961]. One RC will be unblinded (RC2) for purposes  of introducing the study  
medication,  training in proper  use of the medication and refilling medication if the participant  
loses  their medication.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Informed consent  
 
Since an informed consent  is a document  required by [CONTACT_2371], this standard will require 
significant attention to all steps  as set forth by [CONTACT_684002].  To ensure that 
patients’  rights  are protected  and that all study  participants  receive,  read, have explanation 
of and sign an informed consent  prior to enrolling  in any study  or protocol,  the following  
steps  will be followed. The principal  investigator [INVESTIGATOR_502209]: 
 
1. Know  all of the elements  of informed consent  
2. Explain to the patient/parent  the importance of and reasons  for obtaining informed 
consent  
3. Provide the patient/parent  a quiet, undisturbed area for him/her to read the informed 
consent.  
4. If the patient/parent  is unable to read,  then read the consent  to him/her slowly.  
5. After  the patient/parent  completes  the reading of the consent,  provide adequate time for 
him/her to ask any study  or consent  related questions  of the study  doctor and or study  
nurse.  
11 
Inhaled  Mometasone  to Promote  Reduction  Of Vaso -occlusive  Events  
Rev 11-18-15 Manual of Operating  Procedures   
  
6. Document these questions  and answers  in the progress  notes  of the chart  along with a 
notation that the consent  was read and reviewed  by [CONTACT_102]/parent,  that the 
patient/parent  was provided a signed copy,  as well as the date and time the informed  
consent was signed..  
7. The patient/parent  should then sign and date the consent  in all areas  appropriate with 
BLACK ink only. 
8. Witness  the patient/parent  signing the informed consent,  then sign and date in the 
witness  space of the consent.  
9. Give the patient/parent  a signed photocopy  of the informed consent.  
10. Retain the original  signed informed consent  document  in the research chart with a copy  
in the patient’s  outpatient  chart.  
11. If the patient/parent  must  ever sign a revised/amended consent for this study,  repeat  this 
process.   DO NOT  dispose of any prior consent(s).   They  all remain a part of the record.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Baseline data collection 
 
After  the participant  has completed the informed consent  process,  CRF 3 will be completed 
again to ensure the patient’s  eligibility  to be a part of the study.  Then the senior RC will 
administer CRF 4 the baseline data collection form.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Urine and serum  collection and processing 
 
The patient  will then go to phlebotomy  to have labs drawn as part of standard care for their visit. 
Research tubes  will be supplied to the phlebotomist  to be drawn in addition to standard care labs. A 
sterile cup will be provided for urine collection.  Processing of samples  will be done according to the  
following  protocol.  Samples  are to be stored in the Annenberg building  in Tom Moran’s  lab 
(Annenberg Building  Floor  [ADDRESS_926357]).  
 
In clinic:  
Collect blood in one gold top serum tube (~5mls  blood),  one paxgene tube (2.5ml  blood),  
and two green top tubes  (~5.5ml  blood each).   All samples  will be sent for processing de- 
identified.   The gold top tube is labeled with the date,  patient  ID and inverted 2x and stored 
in a portable ice chest  for up to 6 hrs until transfer to lab for processing.  The PAXgene  tube 
blood will be labeled with by [CONTACT_684003],  followed by [CONTACT_684004] 7001 
(and so on for consecutive participants)  and V1 or V2 to designate the time point collected 
(V1at baseline and V2 at 8 Weeks). The PAXgene  will be drawn vertically  to allow  blood to 
flow into the tube to exactly  2.5ml  and inverted X8-10 after  collection.  The green top tubes  
will be labeled in the same  manner as the PAXgene tube and inverted X5 after collection.  
The PAXgene  tube can be kept at room  temperature for up to 6 hours  before transport  at 
end of clinic  day.  The green top tube can be kept at room temperature for up to 30 minutes  
before transport to HIMC  (Hess  5th Floor Rooms  310/313)  for processing by [CONTACT_684005]. 
 
For urine, i
nstruct  patient  to sample clean catch in cup. Cup will be sealed,  labeled,  bagged 
and stored  in a portable ice chest  until processed. 
In lab:

[IP_ADDRESS] Randomizati on 
Randomization will use an adaptive biased coin algorithm  using the software  program R as 
the user interface.  After CRF  [ADDRESS_926360]  the room and the second RC 
(referred  to as RC2 from this point forward) will enter to perform the randomization process.  
 
RC2 will enter  the room  with the IMPROVE  research cart and open the study  laptop.  RC2 
will open R and load the randomization algorithm  program.  The program will  prompt  RC2 to 
enter a) whether or not the patient  takes  hydroxyurea and b) how many ED visits  or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_683966] c) the patients  unique 
study  identification number.  The randomization algorithm  will then notify  RC2 which  
treatment arm the patient  has been assigned to using a letter code (treatment  arm A or B). 
Labeled study  packets  will be kept in the research cart and RC2 will hand the participant  an 
appropriately  labeled packet.  At this time RC2 and the participant  will open the packet 
together  to review  the study  materials.  The steps  will be as follows:  
 
1. Inhaler  training – RC2 will train the participant  in proper  use of the inhaled medication  
including  inhalation technique dosing intervals,  what to do about  missed  doses.  
2. Pain diary  training – RC2 will train the participant  regarding proper use of the pain 
diaries.  
3. Contact [CONTACT_3031] – RC2 will instruct  the participant about  how to contact [CONTACT_684006],  has questions,  suffers  
adverse  events.  
 
Once  the training is complete,  the participant  will be instructed to put away  their medication 
so that other study  personnel  do not see it. RC2 will leave the room.  
 
The SRC will then enter the room and  explain  the schedule of financial incentives.  The 
participant  will be given a $[ADDRESS_926361] and a $[ADDRESS_926362].  A second follow  up visit will 
be scheduled for 8 weeks  from the current  date.  At this point the participant  will be released 
and any other medical care will resume.  
6.1 Telephone follow up (week 2) 
6.2 Overview  
 
A follow up telephone call will be conducted 2 weeks  after the patient  is enrolled in the study.  The 
goal of this phone call is to identify  adverse  events,  to assess  medication adherence,  and 
pregnancy  surveillance in female patients.  Patients  who become pregnant  during the study  will be 
asked to stop taking the medication and they will be withdrawn from the study.  The phone script  
and event  questionnaire  (to assess for adverse events) is contained in CRF 2 – Adverse  Events  
Form.

indicated,  the visit will be conducted for purely  research purposes without  billing  for medical care or 
utilization of any institutional services.  
 
8.3 Intake  
 
The participant  will be greeted by [CONTACT_684007].  Prior to phlebotomy  the 
participant  will be taken to a private  area for data collection.  
 
8.4 Medication Refills  
 
If the participant  meets  criteria  to remain in the study  (see 7.2) RC2 will refill the participant’s  
medication. RC2 will go over with the patient  inhaler technique and dosing schedule to confirm that 
the participant  is using the medication properly.  Once  medication has been given  to the participant,  
they will be instructed to put their medication away.  
 
8.5 Adherence Status  Check  
 
CRF 8 – 8 Week  Adherence Status  check  identifies  if the participant  has remained adherent  to 
study  guidelines  (at least 70% of doses  and 15 pain diaries).  CRF 8 – 8 Week  Adherence Status  
will be filled out by [CONTACT_71602]2 as this requires  that the RC visualize  study  medication in an unblinded 
fashion. If at any time the participant  falls below  the cut-off for medication  or diaries, they will be 
re-instructed  to bring them  back  to compliance.  
 
8.6 Data collection 
8.6.1 Questionnaire 
 
The 8- week  questionnaire will include data regarding respi[INVESTIGATOR_23908],  medication 
adherence,  health- related quality  of life, adverse  events,  side effects, and pregnancy  
surveillance in female patients.  Patients  who become pregnant  during the study  will be 
asked to stop taking the medication and they will be withdrawn from the study.  Once  it is 
confirmed  by [CONTACT_71602]2 that the participant  will remain  in the study,  CRF 5 – 8 Week Data  
Collection will be administered by [CONTACT_12217].  
 
8.6.2 Serum collection 
 
Serum collection will follow  the same processing procedures  as [IP_ADDRESS].  When participants  
in clinic  are having blood drawn as part of standard care,  research tubes  will be given to the 
phlebotomist  to be drawn in addition to clinical labs.

Exhaled nitric  oxide will be measured according to the  same procedure as [IP_ADDRESS].  Results  
will be recorded in CRF 5a – Spi[INVESTIGATOR_683967]2.  
 
8.7 Pain Diary  Processing 
 
Completed pain diaries  will be reviewed for missing data and accuracy  (missing dates, ID number)  
and then brought  to the SCC storage  facility  for processing. Complete pain diary  entries  are 
constituted by [CONTACT_684008] 3 and 4.  Diary  entries  with missing answers  to question 3 
and 4 will be considered incomplete.  Diaries  will be stored securely  with other CRF’s.  
 
8.8 Financial Incentives/additional pain diaries  
 
Once  data collection is complete, the SRC will give the participant  a second packet of pain diaries  
to complete over the subsequent  8 weeks. The SRC  will also give the patient  their financial  
incentives  based on the number of diaries  properly  filled out as indicated by [CONTACT_684009]

14.1 Data Analyses  
14.2 Primary  and Secondary  Outcomes:  The primary  outcome  for the study  is feasibility. Feasibility will 
be determined by [CONTACT_684013] a 
minimum of 30 pain diaries  (as was required in the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_683968])73 with good adherence to the 
study  medication vs. the number enrolled.  Other  findings  relevant  to feasibility  will include retention 
rate (% who complete the study), points  of attrition,  recruitment  rates  (# approached vs. # enrolled)  
and a dherence (via dosage counters  - use of more  than 70% of doses) as a function of recruitment  
site (clinic  vs. ED).

with identifiable data will never  leave the PI’s office.  All data that is shared outside of the PI’s office  
(i.e with statistician) will  be stripped of identifiers  and participants  will be identified only by a unique 
ID number. 
14.4 Aim 2: Primary  and Secondary  Outcomes:  This aim will assess changes  in pulmonary  
inflammation and vascular injury  with ICS therapy.  The primary  outcomes  for the trial will be 
change in eNO (pulmonary  inflammation) and sVCAM  (vascular  injury) level 8  weeks  after 
randomization.  Secondary  outcomes  will be change in reticulocyte index,  change in FEV 1/FVC  
ratio (expressed as percent  predicted)  and change in other key biomarkers.  
14.5 Data Analysis:  Preliminary  analyses  - Descriptive analyses  for all socio- demographic  and clinical  
variables  will be performed.  Preliminary  data analyses  will focus  on examination of the 
distributional  characteristics  of measures  used in the study.  In this step,  decisions  will be made 
regarding possible transformations  that might  be required to meet  the assumptions  of the statistical  
tests  that will be employed.  Baseline values  for individuals in each r andomization assignment  will 
be compared using t- tests, chi-square and non-parametric  tests  when appropriate.  For outcomes  
that may be used in a definitive trial, univariate analyses  will be performed first followed by [CONTACT_684014]  (variables  known  or suspected to have associations  with the 
frequency  of painful epi[INVESTIGATOR_683974], gender,  genotype,  baseline hemoglobin,  leukocyte 
count,  and fetal hemoglobin percent).  Potential  confounders  with p-value less than 0.2  will be 
included in parsimonious  models.  
14.6 Primary  analyses:  The primary  outcome,  feasibility  as well as retention/recruitment  rates, attrition  
points  and adherence will be expressed for those enrolled from the ED and the hematology  clinic.  
Feasibility  measures  will be compared between those enrolled in the ED vs. clinic  using χ2 
statistics.  Adherence (defined as use of greater  than 70% of indicated doses  by [CONTACT_684015])  
will be compared to the previously  validated MARS-A score  cutoff of 4.5 with a χ2 statistic  to 
validate the use of MARS -A in SCD.  
14.7 Exploration of potential  definitive outcomes : For the pain diary self-report measures  of pain a 
linear  mixed  repeated measures  model will be implemented  with the SAS procedure  MIXED  to 
compare mometasone  and placebo.  The nesting variable  will be participant  ID number;  main  
effects  will be time,  treatment  group and interaction of time by [CONTACT_2948]. This will allow  for 
variability  in the number of diaries  completed  and variable effects  of ICS over time (expected to 
increase with duration of treatment). For the measures  of vaso -occlusion with poisson  distributions  
(frequency  of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_683975], ED visits  for pain and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_683976]),  multivariable  negative binomial regressions  will be performed  to estimate rate ratios  
based on treatment  assignment.  We expect self-report  HRQL  measures  (change in ASCQ -Me 
score) to be approximately  normally  distributed.  Pain diary  data will be expressed in terms  of 
several  summary  measures  as described I the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_683977] ‘crisis’,  
number of pain days,  number  of days  requiring opi[INVESTIGATOR_683978].71 Categorical  
summary  measures  will be compared with χ2 statistic, continuous  variables  will be compared with 
t-tests  or non-parametric  tests  as appropriate.  Additionally,  for potential  patient -oriented outcomes,  
a series  of Bayesian analyses  will be performed.  For normally  distributed variables  (i.e. ASCQ -Me 
pain domains)  a posterior distribution  will be estimated  for the difference between  treatment 
groups. This will be achieved by [CONTACT_2329] a non-informative Gaussian distribution as the conjugate 
prior.  Markov- chain monte carlo  simulation will be used to obtain random samples from the 
posterior  distributions  of each treatment  group  such that the distribution of the difference between 
treatments  can be estimated.  The same procedure will be used for other patient -oriented 
outcomes.  For poisson distributed outcomes  (ED visits,  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_614]) a gamma  prior will be 
20

Rev 11-18-15 Manual of Operating  Procedures  
used,  for binomial  outcomes  we will use a beta prior.  All Bayesian  analyses  will be performed  in R.  
 Bayesian analyses  will also be used to estimate adverse  events  if any occur.  
14.8 Sample Size Analysis: While the primary  outcome  of the study  is feasibility, we did perform  a 
sample size analysis  to estimate  measures  of treatment effectiveness  based on mean pain scores  
from pain diaries.  It is unlikely  that average correlation before and after treatment  would be equal   
to 0.[ADDRESS_926373] the treatment  group's  pain scores  to decline while the control  group 
remains  about  the same.  For the proposed sample  sizes,  to detect  a difference in mean  pain score  
of 1 point for ICS vs placebo if the correlation is 0.40,  power  = 0.74,  for a correlation of 0.30,  power  
= 0.77,  and for 0.20,  power  = 0.80.84 
14.9 Data Analysis:  Preliminary  analyses  will be performed  as described in Aim 1. For the primary  
outcome eNO and sVCAM  
170,251.[ADDRESS_926374] with treatment  group  as the 
explanatory variable.  Change scores and t- tests  will be calculated for the secondary  outcomes  
(sVCAM,  reticulocyte index,  FEV 1/FVC,  other biomarkers) in  the same  manner.  Additional  
Bayesian analyses  will also be performed to estimate changes  in biomarkers  using the same 
techniques  described in “exploration  of potential  definitive outcomes”  above.  
14.11 Sample Size Analysis: Using a correlation of 0.[ADDRESS_926375] 80% power to detect  a difference of [ADDRESS_926376]  90% power  to detect a difference of 5.[ADDRESS_926377] even  small reductions  in levels  of eNO across  
treatments.  
14.12 Interim Data  Analysis:  Interim data analysis  will be done after the first [ADDRESS_926378]  (DSMB)  will be constituted.  The 
DSMB  will consist  of members  of the advisory  committee:  [CONTACT_684027], [CONTACT_75074],  and Dr. 
DiMaggio. The DSMB  will report Adverse Events  (AEs) to the Mount  Sinai Institutional Review  
Board, the funding I/C, the NIH Office  of Biotechnology  Activities  (OBA), and the Food and Drug  
Administration (FDA) in  accordance with Investigational New Drug  (IND)  regulations. The DSMB  
will meet prior to subject  enrollment  and data collection and will meet  at 6 month intervals  thereafter  
to review  study  progress and monitor patient  safety. The responsibilities of the DSMB  will include: 
1) overseeing the study’s  progress,  2) approving alterations  or amendments  to the  study  protocol,  
3) monitoring safety  and reviewing serious  adverse events  (SAE),  4) overseeing data quality, 5) 
reviewing the interim  analyses  and recommending early  trial cessation if indicated.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_683979].  
 
As per IRB policies,  all SAEs  regardless  of relationship to the research will be reported to the IRB 
within [ADDRESS_926379]. Glassberg is responsible for maintaining 
compliance with FDCA  (21 U.S.C.  §§ 301 et. Seq.) as well as implementing regulations  [title 21 of 
the code of federal regulations  (CFR)]. All reporting requirements described in the IND will be med.  
 
16.[ADDRESS_926380] to the risks associated with inhaled mometasone,  the risks of adverse events  are extremely  
low with the proposed dose of study  medication.  Participants  will be followed very closely  to assess for 
adverse  events  (see Data  Safety  and Monitoring Plan). For individuals  who benefit  from ICS, all efforts  
will be made to make  ICS available via prescriptions  from the participant’s  primary  provider  after 
conclusion of the study.  Individuals  randomized to placebo will be contact[CONTACT_684016].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_683980]. 
If at any t ime, a subject  expresses  verbal or nonverbal unwillingness  to participate, the subject  will be 
withdrawn from the study.

FOR ORAL INHALATION  ONLY 
 
 
Please read this leaflet carefully before taking this medication 
This leaflet does not contain the complete information  about this medication.  If you have any questions  about mometasone inhalation ask your health care provider or 
pharmacist.  
 
IMPORTANT POINTS TO REMEMBER  
 
• Use this medication regularly and at the same time each day, as prescribed  by [CONTACT_610637]. You or your child may not get the most benefit for 1 to 2 
weeks or longer after starting the medication. If you or your child’s symptoms  do not improve in that time frame or if your condition gets worse, contact [CONTACT_684019]. 
 
• The cap is needed to use the TWISTHALER. Do not twist the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_683981]. When the cap is removed from the TWISTHALER,  the dose counter will  
count down by [CONTACT_31806], and show the number of doses available after this use. 
 
• The inhaler delivers your medicine as a very fine powder that you or your child may not taste, smell, or feel. Do not take or give extra doses unless your health care 
provider has told you to. 
 
• It is important  to replace the cap after each inhalation to protect the inhaler from moisture. 
 
• Do not use the inhaler if you notice that it is not working correctly. Take it to your health care provider or pharmacist.  
 
 UNDERSTANDING  YOUR MEDICATIONS 
MATERIALS  FOR SESSION: 
• twisthalers  
 
As part of this study you will be given an inhaler. This inhaler may contain placebo (no 
medication)  or it may contain a medicine called mometasone.  Mometasone  is part of a class 
of medications  called corticosteroids.  
 
This is a medication  taken regularly every day even when you don't have any symptoms  
 
Although  they have a similar name, these steroids are very different from the anabolic 
steroids that have been in the news in recent years because of their ill-advised use by [CONTACT_684020]. 
 
 
Corticosteroids  are: 
• Anti-inflammatory -Corticosteroids  are a very effective anti-inflammatory  medication  and 
help reduce or prevent edema and excess mucus in the bronchial tubes. 
• Have delayed action-· Corticosteroids  do not relax the muscles around the bronchial  tubes 
and will not open the airways immediately  as do the bronchodilators. For this reason, they 
may not seem to have any effects. However,  over time they can be very beneficial  in 
reducing inflammation.  
 
Inhaled corticosteroids  have very few side effects, when used in moderate doses, but they 
must be taken regularly to be effective. 
 
Possible side effects: an unpleasant  taste and gastrointestinal  symptoms  (e.g., nausea). They 
may cause a yeast infection (“thrush”) in the mouth or bother the upper airways and cause 
coughing.  
 
Proper Inhaler Use (10 minutes)  
The medication  that we have been discussing is administered  by [CONTACT_684021], and proper 
inhaler use is very important  for maximum  benefit. If inhalers are not used correctly,  the 
medications  don't help much because they can't get all the way down into the narrow 
airways. Many times patients stop using their inhalers (or, on the other hand, overuse their 
inhalers) because they think the medicine is not working. In reality, it's not working only 
because they aren't using it right. 
 
Go over steps while  you demonstrate correct  usage. 
 
 
Instruct participants to take one puff per day 
 
Let's take a few minutes to review inhaler use and make sure each of you is using the best 
technique. 
 
 
 
 How To Use YOUR INHALER 
 
 
HOW TO USE ASMANEX TWISTHALER  OR GIVE TO YOUR CHILD 
 
• Remove the ASMANEX TWISTHALER  from its foil pouch and write the date on the cap label.  
• Throw away the inhaler 45 days after this date or when the dose counter reads “00”, indicating  the final dose has been inhaled, whichever comes 
first. 
• Follow steps 1 and 2 below each time you inhale a dose from your ASMANEX TWISTHALER.  
Inhaler Parts: 
See Figures 1 and 2 below to become familiar with the inhaler parts. 
 
 
   
 
  
 
Figure 1: Inhaler (upright position) Figure 2: Inhaler with Cap Removed  
Step 1: Open inhaler 
Hold the inhaler straight up (upright position)  with the colored portion (the base) on the bottom (see Figure 3 below). It is important  that you remove the cap of the 
TWISTHALER  while it is in this upright position to make sure that you get the right amount of medicine with each dose. 
 
Holding the colored base, twist the cap in a counterclockwise  direction to remove it (see Figure 3 below). As you lift off the cap, the dose counter on the base will count 
down by [CONTACT_31806]. Removing the cap loads the TWISTHALER  with the medicine that you are now ready to inhale. 
 
 
Figure 3: Cap Removal Loads Dose 
 
 
IT IS IMPORTANT  TO NOTE that the indented arrow (located on the white portion of the TWISTHALER, directly above the colored base) is pointing to the dose 
counter (see Figure 2). 
 
 Step 2: Inhale dose 
Breathe out fully. Then bring the TWISTHALER  up to your mouth or your child’s mouth with the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_683982]. Place the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_683983]’s mouth,  holding it in a horizontal  (on its side) position as shown below (see Figure 4). Firmly close your lips around the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_683984] a fast, deep breath. Since the medicine is a very fine powder, you may not be able to taste, smell, or feel it after inhalation. Do not cover the ventilation holes while  
inhaling the dose. 
 
 
Figure 4: Inhalation  
 
Remove the TWISTHALER  from your mouth and hold your breath for about 10 seconds, or as long as you comfortably  can. 
 
IMPORTANT:  DO NOT BREATHE OUT (EXHALE) INTO THE INHALER.  
 
After you take your medicine,  it is important  that you wipe the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_683985], if needed, and then REPLACE THE CAP, firmly closing the TWISTHALER  right 
away (see Figures 5 and 6 below). 
 
Be sure that the indented arrow is in line with the dose counter. Put the cap back onto the inhaler and turn it in a clockwise direction, as you gently press down. You’ll 
hear a “click” to let you know that the cap is fully closed. This is the only way to be sure that your next dose is loaded the right way. 
 
 
 
Figure 5: Closing the Inhaler 
 
  
 
Figure 6: Closed Inhaler 
 
 
IT IS IMPORTANT TO REPEAT STEPS 1 AND 2 EACH TIME YOU INHALE.  
 
Rinse your mouth after using. 
 
STORING  YOUR INHALER  
 
• Keep your inhaler clean and dry at all times. If the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_683986], gently wipe the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_289972] a dry cloth or tissue as needed. Do not 
wash the inhaler. Avoid contact [CONTACT_684022]. 
 
• Store in a dry place at 25°C (77°F) [may range between 15-30°C (59-86°F)]. 
 
• Keep your inhaler out of the reach of children. 
 
HOW TO KNOW WHEN YOUR INHALER  IS EMPTY 
The inhaler has a dose counter on the colored base, which shows the number of doses left to use. As you lift off the cap to take your dose, the dose counter on the base  
will count down by [CONTACT_31806] (if you began with the dose counter reading “30” this will cause the dose counter to now read “29”). Read the numbers from top to bottom. 
 
When the unit reads “01” this indicates the last remaining  dose. After dose “01” the counter will read “00”. When you replace the cap, the unit will lock and then must 
be thrown away. Start using a new ASMANEX  TWISTHALER  as instructed  by [CONTACT_610637]. 
 
 Practical  Solutions to Problems  Using an Inhaler (10 minutes)  
Sticking to a schedule for using an inhaler can be pretty demanding, especially  if you take other 
medications or take them  several times a day. If your schedule for medications  is very 
complicated,  you may want to discuss  with your physician and see if a simpler schedule can be 
worked out. Sometimes  people do all right during the week but have problems keepi[INVESTIGATOR_683987]'re not following their 
regular routine. Handout [ADDRESS_926383]. Let's take a minute to read over the handout and 
then talk about which of these solutions seems personally useful to each of you. You might 
also have some suggestions that aren't on the handout. 
 
Practical Solutions to Problems Using an Inhaler 
With particular reference to finding specific solutions for class members.  Elicit participants'  
feelings about taking medications  on a routine basis.  
 
Overuse of Medications  ( 10 minutes) 
Medication  underuse includes things like: 
• Skippi[INVESTIGATOR_49837] 
• Being careless about the timing of your doses 
• Discontinuing routine medications  altogether  
The opposite side of the coin is medication  overuse. Surprisingly,  the two problems can 
often go together. When you skip your medications  you may be tempted to double up 
to bring things back under control. This is much harder on your body and may even lead to 
dangerous  drug reactions.  
 
In general, there are two dangers associated  with medication  overuse: 
• Overused  medication  can cause more side effects sometimes  even severe toxic reactions.  
PRACTICAL  SOLUTIONS  TO PROBLEMS USING AN INHALER  
There are several common problems people have trying to stick to their medication  plans. Here are some 
tips and hints for overcoming them. 
Problems Solutions 
1. Use alarm clocks or watches with built-in alarm functions 
2. Take your inhaler at the same time as another regular habit, such as before or after you eat, before you 
brush your medication  teeth, or when you go to bed. Keep them visible. 
3. Carry your medicines with you at all times, in your purse, briefcase,  etc.; pack in carry-on luggage 
when traveling.  
4. Use a written medication  schedule or keep a diary for several weeks until you begin to establish  good 
medication taking habits. 
5. Check before a trip to make sure you have enough medication  to last until you come back home.

Sticking to a schedule for using an inhaler can be pretty demanding, especially  if you take other 
medications or take them  several times a day. If your schedule for medications  is very 
complicated,  you may want to discuss  with your physician and see if a simpler schedule can be 
worked out. Sometimes  people do all right during the week but have problems keepi[INVESTIGATOR_683987]'re not following their

Overuse of Medications  ( 10 minutes) 
Medication  underuse includes things like: 
• Skippi[INVESTIGATOR_49837] 
• Being careless about the timing of your doses 
• Discontinuing routine medications  altogether  
The opposite side of the coin is medication  overuse. Surprisingly,  the two problems can 
often go together. When you skip your medications  you may be tempted to double up 
to bring things back under control. This is much harder on your body and may even lead to 
dangerous  drug reactions.  
 
In general, there are two dangers associated  with medication  overuse: 
• Overused  medication  can cause more side effects sometimes  even severe toxic reactions.

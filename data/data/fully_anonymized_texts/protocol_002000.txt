3 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE
3.1Medical B ackground and Rationale 
Acne vulgaris (AV) is a common, chronic, inflammatory  disorder estimated to affect 9.4% of the 
global population that usually  starts in early adolescence (ultimately affecting approximately 
85% of adolescents); however, AV can occu r at any age and persist well into adulthood ( Heidel 
B, 2016; Tan J, 2015). Acne is a multifactorial inflammatory  disease affecting pi[INVESTIGATOR_656175] (Dreno 2005 , Gollnick 2003 , Tsatsou, 2014 ). In European populations over 70 –80 % of 
all males will experience acne in some point of their lifetime. I n the [LOCATION_003], acne has been re ported 
to affect an estimated number of over 25 (17 –45) million Americans ( Tsatsou, 2014 ). As acne is 
a chronic and relapsing disease, normalizing follicular desquamation is then the key  to achieve 
and maintain control of acn e. This is a poly morphic disease in which several ty pes of lesions are 
usually present at the same time: primary  lesions, found in active acne defined by  [CONTACT_11339]-
inflammatory  and the inflammatory  lesions; secondary  lesions which came from the first ones 
and which are defined b y scarring and postinflammatory h yperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371] (PI H). It can persist 
for years and result in disfigurement and permanent scarring ( Koo et al., 1991 ). The 
consequences of AV and its sequelae may include phy sical (e.g., skin discomfort/pain, ery thema, 
hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371], scarring), ps ychological (e .g., anxiety, poor self -esteem, depression, suicidal 
ideation), and social repercussions (e .g., avoidance of interpersonal interactions). Teenagers w ith 
even mild acne feel stigmatized and frustrated ( Osterweil N, 1993). The incidence of AV 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_656176], and the severit y of both ph ysical and ps ychosocial 
sequelae tend to increase as AV seve rity worsens (Silverberg J I, 2014; Tan J 2017 ). 
Secondary  acne lesions, including atrophic scars, are an unfortunate clinical outcome of acne
(Layton, et al., 1994 ). Acne scars are not uniform and there are several subty pes.  Some are more 
hypertrophic and keloidal in appearance, while others could be more atrophic (Goodman, et al ., 
2000; Goodman, et al., 2006(a); Goodman, et al., 2006(b )).  The severit y of the acne scars is 
correlated with the acne grade and with the delay  between the start of the disease and the start of 
an adapted tre atment.  In her clinical evaluation of acne scarring, Lay ton indicated that facial 
scarring occurs to some degree in most acne sufferers (95% of the population) even in the mild 
to moderate population. Although not universal, acne scars generall y occur more with 
inflammatory  acne lesions that were not properl y treated(Layton, et al., 1994). 
Loss of dermal matrix is a contributing factor in atrophic acne scars (Kang, et al., 2005 ).  This 
loss of dermal matrix consists in degradation of collagen produced b y intracellular pathway 
activated b y inflammation during the acne lesion formation (Kang, et al., 2005 )(Trivedi, 2006 ).  
This leads to the transcription factor activation coding for matrix -degrading metalloproteinases 
(MMPs). MMPs degrade extracellular matrix molecules during ph ysiological and pathological 
tissue remodeling. Three MMPs (MMP-1 [collagenase], MMP- 3 [stromel ysin] that can initiate 
collagen degradation and MMP- 9 [gelatinase] that can further degrade collagen fragments) have 
been shown to be increased in inflammatory  acne lesion in vivo(Kang, et al., 2005 )(Trivedi, 
2006)(Fisher, et al., 2000 )(Papakonstantinou, et al., 2005). The same enzy mes are involved in 
the remodeling of the dermal matrix in the photoaging process (Kang, et al., 1997 )(Kang, et al ., 
1998)(Fisher, et al., 2000 ).

Page 21of [ADDRESS_883471] decades, significant evidence has demonstrated that topi[INVESTIGATOR_656177] (Kang, et al., 1997 )(Kang, et
al., 1998)(Fisher, et al., 2000 ).  Type I and ty pe III procollagen are reduced in photodamaged 
skin but it has been demonstrated that isotretinoin, either oral or topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], protects against UV -
induced loss of procollagen, leading to MMP -1, 3 and MMP -9 decrease in r elation to the 
duration of the treatment (Kang, et al., 1997 ) (Kang, et al., 1998 )(Fisher, et al., 2000 ).  This 
increase in collagen production is clinically  appreciate d as effacement of wrinkles. After 24 
weeks of treatment with topi[INVESTIGATOR_1832], an increase of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_656178] (Kang, et al., 2001 )(Philips, et al., 2002). 
As photodamage lesions and atrophic acne scars are partiall y linked to a dermal matrix loss, a 
potential effect of trifarotene to prevent secondary  acne lesions (scars) of occurring and/or to 
improve the pre -existing ones might exist. 
Today it is established including in the guidelines that retinoids acts in the pathology  of acne 
vulgaris: a potent modulator of cellular differentiation and keratinisation. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_656179] -line treatment for most forms of acne vulgaris ( Bayramgurler D et al, 2017 ). 
Trifarotene, a new generation topi[INVESTIGATOR_154487], binds to 
specific retinoic acid nuclear receptor (RAR -ɤ) (Thoreau E, 2018 ). Current evidence s uggests 
that topi[INVESTIGATOR_656180]. I t may be an ideal topi[INVESTIGATOR_656181], skin metabolism and with very  low systemic absorption for management of 
acne treatment ( Del Rosso 2011, Gollnick H, 2003, Eichenfield LF, 2013 , Strauss JS, 2007). 
Proper skin care is considered an important component of the total management for patients with 
AV. There are several way s to mitigate adverse effect and prevent further worsening of skin 
tolerability . These include initiating patients on lower concentrations of topi[INVESTIGATOR_22775], 
choosing cream or lotion (than gel) and trifarotene being a highl y selective RAR -ɤwith low 
concentration and in cream formulation with adequate recommendations for its use would be 
appropriate in acne subjects. Skin irritation can lead to poor compliance and subsequently lack of 
efficacy. Hence, the addition of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_656182] ( Del Rosso, 2013 ; 
Davis and Callender, 2010 ) and recommendation for avoiding sun exposure is a part of the skin 
care regimen for these acne subject s. Minimizing skin irritation and photoprotection can be 
achieved b y the use of non- comedogenic moisturizers with appropriate SPF that hy drate and 
protect the skin from UV irradiation ( Schorr E.S., 2012; Whitney P., 2014; Del Rosso, 2013 ). 
Also, using an appropriate cleanser shouldreduce oil on the face and therefore should not affect 
skin hydration or the skin barrier function. 
Currently , trifarotene 50 µg/g creamis commercially  approved in countries including [LOCATION_009], 
Canada and the [LOCATION_002] for the treatment of acne vulgaris. Registration studies included two 
12-week pi[INVESTIGATOR_656183] y and efficacy (Tan J, et al, 2019 ). Along-term safet y study 
was also conducted involving once daily treatment for 1 year that showed trifarotene 50 µg/g cream
was well-tolerated, without undue safet y risks (Blume-Peytavi U, et al, 2019).    
A small, single -arm, open -label, Phase 3b stud y (Galderma protocol RD.06.SPR .118295) 
showed that over a [ADDRESS_883472].06.SPR.202395  Amended Protocol 01/Global 9Jul2021
Page 26of [ADDRESS_883473] 
four (4) weeks of the treatment period ( Section5.4.8–Dose Modificat ion).
Subjects will receive anelectronic tablet at baseline for dail y recording of study medication use 
(electronic dosing calendar), as well as for capturing dail y videos of appl ying study medication 
to each side of the face. Study  medication dosing data will be uploaded for remote assessment b y 
the clinical site, and will serve as the primary  means for recording dosing compliance ( Section 
[IP_ADDRESS] –Treatment Compliance –Primary Source Data ). All videos will remain on the local 
drive of the study electronic tablet , and reviewed by  [CONTACT_656221] ( Section [IP_ADDRESS] – Treatment Compliance –
Supportive Video Evidence ). 
Subjects who do not require a wa shout period may complete the Screening and B aseline 
assessments on the same day . Subjects who initially  fail screening may  be re-screened once ,
provided the reason for screen failure is not due to atrophic scar counts, acne severity (IGA)or 
lesion counts.  
Subjects will return to the clinic for safety and efficacy assessment at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8 , 12, 16, 20
and 24. Study procedures and assessments are performed according to the schedule of 
assessments ( Section 5.1.2).

5.1.2 Schedule of Assessments
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Assessment Considerations Pertaining to the COVID- 19 Pandemic
Subjects who are wearing a face mas k should continue to do so until seated in an exam room, in 
accordance with y our local guidelines. The general sequence of examinations should begin with 
a wellness assessment, review of dosing calendar/compliance and completion of subject 
questionnaires prior to performing scar and acne assessments, local tolerability  assessment and 
imaging (for designated imaging centers).
The following stud y procedures are permitted, within the protocol defined visit windows, to 
ensure safet y of enrolled subjects and co ntinuity of the follow -up visit schedule, due to 
circumstances when a subject is unable to return to the clinic due to the COVID -19 pandemic. 
These circumstances include, but are not limited to:  shelter in place guidelines, quarantines, 
travel restriction s, clinical site closures, etc.  As with all study  procedures, clear and complete 
documentation in source records is required in these circumstances.   
Remote Visits (phone, etc) in lieu of scheduled office visits 
ofor safety  and wellness assessment (con comitant medications, AEs, etc)
Subject q uestionnaire completion 
osent to subject by  [CONTACT_656222], dates and returns, by  [CONTACT_656223].
Collection of previously  dispensed study drugs, from an adult family  member, along with 
the study electronic tablet
oWeighing of returned topi[INVESTIGATOR_656184]-up phone call with the subject is required to review the dosing compliance
and returned study  drug, for appropriate clarification in study  medication use.  
Dispensing of new study drug, non-investigational supplies (non-IP supplies, electronic 
tabletafter video reviews, etc) to an adult family  member
oWeighing of topi[INVESTIGATOR_656185], before dispensing
oA follow-up phone call with the subject is required to convey  reminders on proper 
instructions for study medication and other supplyuse, and to use the newly 
dispensed study drug beginning that evening (and to stop using previously 
dispensed medication, if not returned). 
FDA COVID-[ADDRESS_883474] ructions for study  medication and other supply  use.
Note:  The decision to dispense additional study drug should be based on the 
investigator’s clinical judgment that ongoing dosing does not pose undue safety risks to 
the subject, and that the subject is willing to continue using the study drug. In all cases

Page 33of [ADDRESS_883475] on the b asis of the fo llowingpoints:
Scarring appears second arily toacne lesions and may co rrespond to a reso lution of th ese
lesions
It is generally agreed in acne clin icalstudiesthata 12-weektreatment period is
sufficient to evaluate theefficacy on the acne lesions.An additional 12 weeks is included 
tofurther evalute the clinical outcomes associated with treatment of acne lesions
24 weeks is considered adequate to allow for potential underlying tissue remodeling by  
[CONTACT_656224] 50 µg/g cream
treatment , and any effects thereof that may  translate to clinical improvement of scars 
Overall, the study design is considered to be scientificall y robust and clinically relevant for 
evaluating trifarotene (CD5789) cream for the treatment of acne lesions to assessthe risk of 
atrophic scar formation.
5.3 Selection of Study Population
5.3.1 Number of Planned Subjects
An initial number of  subjects is planned to be randomised. A blinded sample size re-estimation 
will be performed after  subjects complete/discon tinuethe study (i.e. after ~33% of the initial 
planned subjects complete/discontinue the study) in order to evaluate the need for additional 
subjects to be randomized .
Site enrollment strategies should include outreach plans with a goal for approximate even 
distribution of male to female subjects, to the extent possible.Refer to Section 7.2for the statistical 
considerations on which the sample size is based.

not cause acne) may  be used as well as ey e and lip makeup. Cosmetics can be applied after the 
study drug has dried. Foundation make- up is allowed on the day s of study  visits as long as 
subjects wash their face a t least [ADDRESS_883488] dose occurred at the clinic. 
Study drug should be applied approximately  1 hour before or 1 hour after application of an y 
other permitted skin care products (e.g. non -comedogenic moisturizers, cosmetic products, etc ). 
Subjects will video the application of study  drug toboth sides of the face each evening using the 
study assigned electronic tablet .  
Products containing alcohol, alpha hy droxy or glycolic acids and astringents should not be used 
during the stud y.
Face shaving is allowed during the stud y.Male subjects with excessive facial hair that would 
interfere with acne assessments, as judged by [CONTACT_093], are not eligible to participate in 
the study. Male subjects with facial hair will be expected to keep areas well- groomed prior to 
study visits,as judged appropr iate by [CONTACT_093], to perform the acne assessments.

[IP_ADDRESS] Study Drug Shipment an d Accountability
The drug depot will ship appropriate quantities of study  drug kits to each site , based upon 
individual site needs and within whole block sizes, as specified per the randomization list.  
Upon receipt, the site must conduct a complete inven tory of all study  drugkits.If a damaged 
shipment is received and/or a temperature excursion has been experienced, the site will notify  the 
Sponsor/CRO and follow the guidelines according to the current version of the pharmacy  
manual.
All study drug sent to the I nvestigator/Institution will be accounted for and no unauthorized use 
is permitted. Subjects will be instructed to return all study  drug and the study  electronic tablet 
per the Schedule of Assessments ( Section 5.1.2 ).
The investigator or designee will maintain accurate records of supplies received, inventoried at 
the clinical studysite and used per subject. Used and unused study  drugwill be appropriately  
reconciled by [CONTACT_656226] (Section5.4.6.3 –Dispensing and Return of Study  Drug).
[IP_ADDRESS] Dispensing and Return of Study Drug
Designated stud y personnel at each investigational site wi ll be responsible for dispensing the 
study drug at the appropriate visits and will record the dispensing information for each subject
(see Section 5.1.2 – Schedule of Assessments ).
Each subject will receive a study drug dispenser at each designated dispensing visit. Thevisit 
designation will be captured on the study  drug dispenser . Study drugswithin each kit will be 
uniquely identified with the corresponding kit number and a pumpi[INVESTIGATOR_656188] , per dosing interval . Upon dispensing, the affixed portion of the label will remain 
on the dispensing box. The tear -off portion of the label is to be removed from the dispenser and 
attached to the appropriate drug accounting record .
Each subject will be instructed on the importance of returning study  drug (used and/or unused) as 
specified in the schedule of assessments ( Section 5.1.2 ). Drug accountability  and dosing 
compliance will be assessed by [CONTACT_656227]. Subjects will be 
instructed to return the electronic tablet and all study  medication at each study  visit, for review 
by [CONTACT_656228]. At study visits Week 1 and Week 2, study  drug 
dispensed at Baseline will be re-dispensed after compliance checks are completed (see Section 
[IP_ADDRESS] –Treatment Compliance –Primary Source Data ).
In the event of earl y termination/suspension of the clinical study, a rapid recall of study  drug will 
be initiated. The Investigator or designee must immediately  instruct the subjects to stop the study  
drug and return allstudy drug to the clinical studycenter.
For subjects who do not complete the entire clinical study, all used and unused study drug should 
be returned by [CONTACT_656229].

Page 53of [ADDRESS_883499] should be reminded to adhere to the study  visit schedule. Unscheduled visits are 
unplanned and may  include examinations for safety  or repeat study  assessment s.  Visits 
occurring outside of the visit window are not considered unscheduled visits.
Assessments to be conducted at the unscheduled visit will depend on the reason for the visit: Any  
of the procedures/a ssessments listed in Section 5.1.2 – Schedule of Assessments may be 
conducted, as appropriate.  
6 STUDY ASSESSMENTS 
The protocol specifies the planned e fficacy and safety  assessments.
Subjects who are wearing a f ace mask should continue to do so until seated in an exam room, in 
accordance with y our local guidelines. The general sequence of examinations should begin with 
a wellness assessment, review of dosing calendar/compliance and completion of subject 
questionnaires prior to performing scar and acne assessments local tolerability  assessment and 
imaging (for designated imaging centers).  
Any facial observations clearl y judged b y the investigator to be related to the mask (e.g. erythema 
or dermatitic effects) will be noted in source records and included in the CRF comments, 
attributable to the mask (e.g., increased erythema along mask edge, etc). An AE form can be 
submitted at the discretion of the investigator. If mask effects remain detectable at the time of the
acne assessments and local tolerability  assessments, they should be considered and reported as part 
of these assessments.
Refer to Section 5.1.2 – Schedule of Assessments for guidelines to ensure safety of enrolled 
subjects and continuity  of scheduled follow- up visits.
6.1Efficacy Assessments
Efficacy measurements should be conducted by  [CONTACT_506473] (or designees) or by  [CONTACT_1766] 
(for subject -reportedassessments ) according to Section 5.1.[ADDRESS_883500] complete standardized training prior to performing the following assessments: 
atrophic scar severity (SGA), atrophic scar counts , acne severit y (IGA), inflammatory  lesion 
counts (papules and pustules), non-inflammatory  lesion counts (open and closed comedones), 
and other lesion counts ( nodules and cy sts).Refer to Section8.1 –Personnel Training for further 
details on site personnel training.

Any new sign or s ymptom, which is not included in the scheduled evaluation of tolerability , 
should be recorded as an Adverse Event, including those of mild intensity .
6.11.2 Adverse Events
Adverse events (AEs) are to be monitored throughout the course of the clinical study. All AEs 
are to be reported on the Adverse Event Form with complete information as required. If AEs 
occur, the main concern will be the safet y of the subjects. At the time of the ICF signature, 
eachsubject must be provided with the name [CONTACT_656246].

a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory val ue), symptom, or disease temporall y 
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the 
medicinal (investigational) product.
Thus,any new sign, s ymptom or disease, or an y clinically significant worsening of an existing 
sign, symptom or disease compared to the condition at the first visit (including disease treated), 
should be considered as an AE. Lack of efficacy  is not considered a s an AE.
Each new epi[INVESTIGATOR_44715] a chronic disease (e.g., hay  fever, allergy , etc.) should be reported as 
anewAE.
Notes:
Any new sign or s ymptom reported b y the subject that appears after accidental or intentional 
overdose or misuse should also be reported a s an AE.
Whenever possible, a diagnosis should be reported on the AE form rather than the signs, 
symptoms or abnormal laboratory  values associated with the report of an AE. However, a 
diagnosis should be reported only  if, in the Investigator’s judgment, it is relatively  certain. 
Otherwise, s ymptoms, signs, or laboratory  values should be used to describe the AE.
Pregnancy  is not to be considered as an AE; however, is an important medical event that must 
be monitored as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].5.

[IP_ADDRESS].2 Serious Adverse Events
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any  untoward medical occurrence that at any  dose:
Results in death,
Is life-threatening,
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64005],
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity , or
Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect.
Important medical events that may  not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10154], based upon ap propriate medical judgment, they  
may jeopardize the safety  of the subject and may  require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such events are intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasia, or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].
Note:
The term “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time 
of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically  might have caused death if it was 
more severe.
Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_414216] a night

hospi[INVESTIGATOR_656205], admission to a day -care facilit y, social admission (e.g., if the subject has no place 
to sleep), or administrative admission (e.g., for a y early examination).
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_883506] for this protocol are pre-defined as follows: 
Related cutaneous AEs which lead to permanent treatment discontinuation
Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_656206](seeSection 6. [IP_ADDRESS])

subsequent ingredient patch testing, if the re -challenge with thestudy drugis positive or 
equivocal).  
[IP_ADDRESS].4 Unexpected A dverse Drug Reaction
According to ICH E6, an unexpected adverse drug reaction is defined as an adverse reaction, t he 
nature or severit y of which is not consistent with the applicable stud y drug information 
(e.g.,reference safety  information in I nvestigator Brochure, package insert/summary  of product 
characteristics, etc ).
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_883508]’s participation.
The Sponsor should be informed if the Investigator becomes aware of an y unusual safet y 
information or an y safety information that appears to be drug -related involving a subject who has 
participated in a clinical study, even after a subject has completed the clinical study. 
TheInvestigator should be diligent in looking for possible latent safet y effects that may  not 
appear until a medication has been discontinued.

Page 65of 101
[IP_ADDRESS].7 Relationship to the Study Drug
The investigator is to determine whether there is a reasonable causal relationship between the 
study drug and the AE. Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, 
considering all relevant factors including the pattern of reaction, temporal relationships, positive 
challenge or rechallenge, relevant medical history , and confounding factors such as 
co-medication or concurrent diseases.
The expression “reasonable causal relationship” is meant to convey  in general that there are facts 
or arguments to suggest a causal relationship (I CH E2A, Secti on IIIA 1).
The relationship assessment for an AE is to be completed using the following definitions as a 
guideline for all AEs occurring during clinical studiesconducted or s ponsored by  
[CONTACT_154500] R&D:
Reasonable possibility:
According to the Investigator, there is a reasonable possibility  (i.e., suggestive evidence or 
arguments) that there is a causal relationship irrespective o f the dose administered between :
The study  drug and the AE, or
The study procedure and the AE (e.g, procedure include use of clean ser, moisturizer ,etc.)
No reasonable possibility:
No suggestive evidence or arguments can be identified regarding a causal relationship 
between the stud y drugor study procedure and the AE.
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting P rocedures
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_883510] -enrollment visit, the Investigator (or sub- Investigator) will question the subject 
about AEs using an open non-persuasive question to elicit reporting of AEs, for example: 
“Haveyou noticed an y change in y our health since the last visit?” Directed questioning and 
examination will then be performed, as appropriate. 
Any AE occurring during the AE reporting period, whether it is related to the study  drug or not, 
will be recorded immediately in the source document, and described on the Adverse Event Form
along with the date of onset, severit y, relationship to the study  drug, and outcome, without 
omitting any  requested and known information. Additional information may  be requested under 
certain circumstances. Adverse Events assessed as related to the treatment will be monitored

Stop all study medication .
Take a pi[INVESTIGATOR_327002]- affected surrou nding skin
Document the event as an Adverse Event of Special I nterest, contact [CONTACT_656237] 24h rs(seeSection6.[IP_ADDRESS]).
The subject continues to be followed for scheduled study  visits while awaiting the re -
challenge test results. 
a)Re-Challenge with Assigned Topi[INVESTIGATOR_656208] 
1)After all signs and s ymptoms of AESI  have resolved and after a minimum of two w eeks from 
last dose application, perform a re -challenge test with the study  drug. Scheduling on a 
Monday or Tuesday  is ideal, as it ensures the 48 -hour and 72- 96 hour follow -up assessments 
occur on weekday s (Table 8).
2)Ensure the subject has not been under an y treatment with corticosteroids or antihistamines of 
any route of administration the week before testing. 
3)Ensure that the skin on the back has not been exposed to the sun or artificial UVsources the 
week before testing.
4)Apply an appropriate quantity  of the topi[INVESTIGATOR_656209] a naïve zone on the back either the right or left side of the center line (or the inner 
forearm if the back cannot be tested). If no test chamber is available on site, patch test units 
will be provided by [CONTACT_16015] .Apply an empty  test chamber as a control for 
the re-challenge test with topi[INVESTIGATOR_656210](note: an empty  test chamber will not be needed 
for ingredient testing, if such test is warranted, as the Sponsor/designee will provide one or 
more controls for testing ).The use of semi -occlusive conditions dependson the irritant
potential of the study  product and the intensity of the reaction that was observed. The method 
to be used should be discussed with the Medical Monitor .
Choose a skin site that was not previously  involved in the inflammatory  skin reaction. Cover 
the test chamber for 48 hours with a hy poallergenic tape.
5)Subjectshould be informed about avoiding exercise, showers, application of toiletries 
products, etc. to keep the test sy stem dry

7PLANNED STATISTICAL ANALYSES
7.1Statistical A nalysis Plan
A statistical anal ysis plan (SAP) will be developed and issued as a separate document. The SAP 
will contain a more detailed and technical description of specific data conventions, calculations 
and of statistical procedures for executing the analy sis strategies. The SAP will be finalized prior 
to thedatabase lock.
Any change from the protocol will be justified and fully  documented.
If the blind review suggests changes to the principal features stated in the protocol, these have to 
be documented in a protocol amendment. Otherwise, it will suffice to update the statistical 
analysis plan with the considerations suggested from the blind review . 
Post hoc exploratory  analyses will also be clearly  identified in the Clinical Study  Report (CSR).

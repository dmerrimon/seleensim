Amendment 6(06-Feb-2020 )
This amendment is considered to be substantial ba sed on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) 
of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union 
(65).
Overall rationale for the amendment
The main reason s for th is amendment are:
xTo introduce the possibility for eligible subjects in selected countries of the 
present LP0162 -1334 trial to continue in a long -term extension trial (conducted 
under a separate protocol [LP0162 -1337, ECZTEND] ). Eligible subjects from 
the present trial will be allowed to enter ECZTEND after completion of the 
treatment period and up to [ADDRESS_746921] investigational medicinal

Trial ID: LP0162-1334 Date: 06-Feb-2020 Version: 7.[ADDRESS_746922] (IMP)  injection in the present trial to the ir first IMP injection in 
ECZTEND (baseline).  
xTo fulfil the commitments in the paediatric investigation plan (PIP) and the 
paediatric study plan (PSP), u nblinding at Week 52 of the present trial is 
introduced , as production of a pharmacokinetic (PK) model in adolescents will 
inform tralokinumab dose selection for paediatric subjects .    
Additional changes included in the amendment are also presented in the table below.  The 
table below presents the changes in each se ction. Changes have either been summarised 
(written in plain text only) or marked as tracked changes (text adde d to the protocol is written 
in bold  and deleted text has a line through it ).

1 Protocol synopsis
3 Schematic of trial 
design
7.1 Trial design The following text has been added (bold) to Section 7.1 Trial 
design and summarised in Section 1 Protocol synopsis and 
Section 3 Schematic of trial design: 
Safety follow -up period (Week 52 to Week 66)
After completion of the treatment periods or premature 
discontinuation of IMP, all subjects will c omplete an 
off-treatment follow- up period for the assessment of safety, 
PK, and immunogenicity (i.e. ADA), except subjects who 
transfer to ECZTEND before Week 66 (see below). During 
follow -up, subjects will be allowed to receive standard of AD 
care (excluding biologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) at the investigator’s 
discretion, if needed.
Long -term extension trial (LP0162-1337, ECZTEND)
Eligible subjects from selecte d countries may be invited to 
enter a long -term extension trial conducted under a 
separate protocol (LP0162 -1337, ECZTEND). Subjects who 
transfer to ECZTEND, must ha ve had their last visit in the 
treatment period (Week 52) un der the current protocol 
(LP0162 -1334). Subjects may ente r ECZTEND up to [ADDRESS_746923] IMP injection in the present trial 
(Week 50) to their first IMP injection in ECZTEND 
(baseline). Subjects may therefore enter ECZTEND 
(baseline) without completing the safety follow up visit 
(16weeks after their last IMP injection ) in the present trial, 
and those subjects will have their safety follow -up visit in 
ECZTEND.Introduced to allow 
for subjects in the 
present trial 
(LP0162 -1334) to 
continue in 
ECZTEND, and to 
clarify when the 
subjects can transfer 
to ECZTEND.

All subjects will have a safety follow -up [ADDRESS_746924] 
injection of IMP (see Panel 5 ). This is considered the end of 
trial visit. For subjects who enrol in the long- term extension 
trial (conducted under a se parate protocol [LP0162 -1337, 
ECZTEND]), the end of trial visit will be the last visit in the 
present trial before transfer to ECZTEND (between 
Week 52 and Week 66); subjects who transfer to 
ECZTEND before completing the safety follow -up visit in 
the present trial will have their safety follow -up visit in 
ECZTEND.To clarify in the 
trial procedures which visit is considered the end 
of trial visit

1 Protocol synopsis
7.1 Overall trial 
design
9.3.1 BlindingThe following text has been added in Section 9.3.1 Blinding
and summarised in Section 1 Prot ocol synopsis and Section 7.1 
Overall trial design :
Analysis of data per last subject’s Week 52 visit
To fulfil the commitments in the PIP and the PSP, an 
analysis of trial data up to and including visit 29 (Week 52) 
will be performed and will require unblinding of data. To 
perform this analysis, an analysis group consisting of Clin
ical Pharmacologists, Medical Experts, Safety 
Advisors, Statisticians, Statistical Programmers and 
Medical Writers will be unblinded to individual subject 
treatment allocation followi ng database lock for the 
52-week data. All staff involved in the conduct of the trial 
will remain blinded to treatment allocation for the entire 
duration of the trial. This principle will be applied to all 
investigator staff and to staff employed by [CONTACT_569678].To clarify that a n
analysis group, not 
including trial staff or investigatorinvolved in 
the trial 
conduct, will be 
unblinded after all 
subjects have 
completed the treatment period and 
before all subjects 
have completed the safety follow
-up 
period .
7.[ADDRESS_746925] 
completed all periods of the trial including the final safety 
follow -up visit at Week 66. Subjects who enter the long- term 
extension trial (LP0162 -1337, ECZTEND) after completion 
of the end of treatment visit (Week 52) will also be 
considered as trial completers.To clarify who will 
be considered trial 
completers.

Trial ID: LP0162-1334 Date: 06-Feb-2020 Version: 7.[ADDRESS_746926] completed the trial, the subjects will be treated at the 
investigator’s discretion or referred to other physician(s) 
according to standard practice. Subjects from selected 
countries w ho qualify for the long -term extension trial 
(LP0162 -1337, ECZTEND) may be offered participation 
(see Sectio n 7.1). To reflect the 
opportunity to 
continue in 
ECZTEND.
11.9 End of trial Added bullet to end of trial form:
Has the subject been transferred to the open-label 
ECZTEND trial (LP0162 -1337)? If yes, which was the last 
visit (including phone call) th e subject attended in this 
trial?To clarify how it is 
to be documented if 
subjects transfer to ECZTEND.
13.[ADDRESS_746927] has signed the informed consent form (ICF) 
until completion of the clinical trial (defined as the safety follow
-up visit [ADDRESS_746928] IMP injection). For 
subjects entering the long-term extension trial 
(LP0162 -1337, ECZTEND), any (S)AE with onset before 
the subject’s final visit in the LP0162 -1334 trial should be 
reported in the LP0162 -1334 trial. If ongoing, the (S)AE 
will also be recorded as medical history in ECZTEND.Toclarify the 
reporting of (S)AEs 
during transfer from trial LP0162
-1334 
to ECTZEND.
13.4.1 Investigator 
reporting 
responsibilitiesFor subjects entering the long -term extension trial 
(LP0162 -1337, ECZTEND), any SAE(s) with onset before 
the final visit in the present trial, must be reported in the 
LP0162 -1334 trial eCRF, includ ing any follow-up data 
requested by [CONTACT_488909].
SAEs occurring after the completion of the present clinical 
trial (i.e., after the last safety follow up visit) should not be 
routinely sought or collected. However, such events should be reported to Global Safety at LE O Pharma (see contact [CONTACT_357581]) if the investigator becomes aware of them. For To clarify the 
reporting of SAEs 
during transfer from 
trial LP0162 -1334 
to ECTZEND.

Trial ID: LP0162-1334 Date: 06-Feb-2020 Version: 7.[ADDRESS_746929] visit in the present trial and up to entering 
ECZTEND (defined as baseline), must be recorded as 
medical history in ECZTEND.
13.7 Follow -up for 
final outcome of 
adverse eventsAdded to this section: 
For SAEs which have stabilised and from which the subject 
cannot be expected to recover during the trial or the safety 
follow -up periods, for example chronic or stabilised 
conditions, the final outcome at the investigator's discretion 
should be reported as 'recovering/resolving' or ‘not 
recovered/not resolved’. In addition, a statement that the 
SAE has stabilised or is chro nic should be added to the 
narrative description of the SAE on the SAE form.To provide 
clarification on how 
to handle SAEs 
where the final 
outcome is 
recovering/resolving 
at the end of the trial.
14.3.[ADDRESS_746930]’s 
Week [ADDRESS_746931]’s Week 52 visit: 
To fulfil the commitments in the PIP and the PSP, the trial 
will be unblinded once all ra ndomised subjects have 
completed the Week [ADDRESS_746932]’s Week [ADDRESS_746933] pre -specified hypotheses are final. 
Thus, no adjustments in significance level of the primary 
and secondary efficacy analys es are relevant. The CTR will 
include all data from all ra ndomised subjects from the 
initial, maintenance, and open- label treatment periods and 
all available data from the safety follow up period as per 
data cut -off date.To clarify that data 
will be unblinded
(to ana n a l y s i s  
group), analysed 
and reported when all subjects have 
completed the 
treatment period and 
before all subjects have completed the safety follow
-up 
period .
Appendix 3E: 
Registration, reporting 
and publication policyResults of this clinical trial will be posted on the corporate 
website of LEO Pharma in accordance with LEO Pha rma’s 
Position on Public Access to Clinical Trial Information no later than 
12 months 6 months after trial completion.To clarify that the 
reporting of the trial 
results will be 6 
months from trial 
completion as this 
trial includes adolescent subjects.

to 4 (severe).
2. The EASI is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials 
to assess the severity and extent of AD. The EASI is a composite index 
with scores ranging from 0 to 72, with higher values indicating more severe 
and/or more extensive condition.
3. The SCORAD is a validated tool to evaluate the extent and severity of AD 
lesions, along with subjective symptoms. The maximum total score is 103, 
with higher values indicating more severe disease.
4.The Adolescent Pruritus NRS is used by [CONTACT_569679] 24 hours using an 11- point NRS with 0 indicating 'no itch' and 
10 indicating 'worst itch possible'.
5. The CDLQI is a validated questionnaire with content specific to those with 
dermatology conditions. It consists of [ADDRESS_746945]’s 
perception of the impact of their skin disease on various aspects of their 
quality of life over the last week such as dermatology- related symptoms 
and feelings, leisure, school or holidays, personal relationships, sleep, and 
the treatment. Each item is scored on a 4- point Likert scale (0 = ‘not at all’; 
1=‘only a little’; 2 = ‘quite a lot’; 3 = ‘very much’). I tem 7 (on school 
time) has one additional response cate gory ‘prevented school’, which is 
also scored ‘3’. The total score of the CDLQI is the sum of the 10 items 
(0to 30); a high score is indicative of a poor quality of life.

The trial will consist of a screening period of 2 to 6 weeks (We eks -6/- 2 to 0), 
an initial treatment period of 16 weeks (Weeks 0 to 16), a maintenance 
treatment period of 36 weeks (Weeks 16 to 52 ), and a 14-week safety follow -up
period for the assessment of safety (Weeks 52 to 66) .Subjects who transfer to 
ECZTEND before completing the safety follow-up visit in the present trial will have 
their safety follow -up visit in ECZTEND.
Initial treatment period
Subjects will be randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive multiple SC doses of 
tralokinumab 300 mg, tralokinumab 15 0 mg, or placebo every 2 weeks (Q2W) 
following a loading dose (double dose compared to randomised dose) on Day 0
(baseline) . Randomisation will be stratified by [CONTACT_569680] (according to IGA).
Maintenance treatment period
Subjects with a clinical response* at Week 16 (achieved without use of rescue 
treatment from Week 2 to Week 16) will continue into maintenance treatment
which may last until Week 52 (with last dose of investigational medicinal 
product [IMP] given at Week 50). The treatment during the maintenance 
treatment period will depend on the regimen received in the initial treatment 
period as described below. *Clinical respon se is defined as IGA of 0 or 1 or 
EASI75 .
Subjects randomised to tralokinumab in the initial treatment period will be re-
randomised 1:1 (at the randomised dose) in the maintenance treatment period.
Re-randomisation will be stratified by [CONTACT_421454] 16

with optional use of TCS or TCI) if they meet any of the criteria listed below, 
and if considered appropriate by [CONTACT_093]:

xSubjects with IGA=1 at Week 16: IGA of at least [ADDRESS_746948] a 4-week period (i.e., over 3 consecutive visits).
xSubjects with IGA >1 at Week 16: not achieving EASI75 over at least 
a 4-week period (i.e., over 3 consecutive visits).
xSubjects who receive rescue treatment (from Week 16 or later).
Transfer to open -label treatment may occur at any visit from Week [ADDRESS_746949] is in the maintenance treatment period.
Safety follow -up period
After completion of the treatment periods (at Week 52) or discontinuation of 
IMP, all subjects will enter a 14-week safety follow- up period for assessment 
of safety , pharmakokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity , except subjects who 
transfer to ECZTEND before Week 66 (see below). During follow- up, subjects 
will be allowed to receive standard of AD care (excluding biologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) at 
the investigator’s discretion ,i f  n e e d e d .
Long -term extension trial (LP0162-1337, ECZTEND)
Eligible subjects from selected countries may be invited to enter a long- term 
extension trial conducted under a separate protocol (LP0162 -1337,
ECZTEND). Subjects who transfer to ECZTEND, must have had their last visit 
in the treatment period (Week 52) under the current protocol (LP0162 -1334). 
Subjects may enter ECZTEND up to [ADDRESS_746950] IMP injection in 
the present trial (Week 50) to their first IMP injection in ECZTEND (baseline). 
Subjects may therefore enter ECZTEND (baseline) without completing the 
safety follow -up visit ([ADDRESS_746951] IMP injection) in the present 
trial, and those subjects will have their safety follow- up visit in ECZTEND.
Background treatment
All subjects will use an emollient twice daily (or more, as needed) for at least 
14 days before randomisation and will continue this treatment throughout the 
trial (including safety follow-up).

 endpoints for the tralokinumab 150 mg dose and a Holm-Bonferroni testing  
procedure for the secondary endpoints for the tralokinumab 300 mg dose.  
If all the hypotheses of no difference to placebo for the tralokinumab 300 mg  
dose are rejected, then the 2.5% significance level will be passed on to the  
testing of all the endpoints for the tralokinumab 150 mg dose. Similarly, if the  
hypotheses of no difference to placebo for all the endpoints of the tralokinumab  
150 mg dose are rejected the 2.5% significance level will be passed on to the  
testing of the secondary endpoints of the tralokinumab 300 mg dose.  
To fulfil the commitments in the paediatric investigation plan (PIP) and the  
paediatric study plan (PSP), the trial will be unblinded to an analysis group  
once all randomised subjects have completed the Week 52 visit and available  
data will be analysed and reported.

5Introduction and trial rationale
5.1 Atopic dermatitis
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that may affect up to 20% of 
children and up to 10% of adults. In its severe form, AD is characterised by [CONTACT_421439], intractable itch, as well as increased  susceptibility to bacter ial, viral, and fungal skin 
infections ( 1-4). AD rash distribution varies with patient age ( 5). In infants <2 years, AD 
usually involves the scalp, face, neck , and extensor surfaces of th e extremities. In children 
from 2 years of age to puberty, the flexural surfaces of the extremities, head and neck, and 
wrists and ankles are more often involved. In adolescents and adults, eczematous changes are 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_569652], flexur al surfaces of the extremities, and hands and feet. 
AD is associated with a substantial patient bur den that typi[INVESTIGATOR_483575]  
(QoL) and sleep disturbance ( 6).
AD is characterised by [CONTACT_421440] T -helper -2 (Th2) pathway with increased skin expression 
of key Th2 cytokines including interleukin (IL)  13 (7, 8). The expression of IL -13 is increased 
in lesional skin compared to non -lesiona l skin, and the proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ cells 
expressing IL-13 is upregulated in AD patients comp ared to individuals without AD ( 7, 9).
IL-13 acts on keratinocytes to release C -C motif chemokine ligand (CCL) 22 an d recruit more 
IL-13 expressing Th2 cells, decrease differentiation, and contribute to decreased barrier 
function ( 10). IL-13 also drives immunoglo bulin E (IgE) production and contributes to mast 
cell activation status and, once allergen cross -links IgE on the cell surface, drives histamine 
release and induces itch ( 11, 12). Indeed, itch is a key issue in AD, which drives significant 
mechanical damage to the skin and further facilitates allergen and pathogen entry.
These effects together drive and exacerbate th e disease phenotype. A review of the available 
preclinical literature from mouse and human ex vivo models suggests IL -13 as a, if not the, 
central mediator of the AD skin phenotype. Indeed, there is evidence that blocking the IL -4 
receptor (which is part o f the receptor complex that also binds IL -13) with the monoclonal 
antibody dupi[INVESTIGATOR_547667] ( 13).
Even if the clinical manifestations of AD in children and adults are different with regard to the 
anatomical distribution, IL -13 is an important player in the pathogenesis of AD in both 
children and adults. Counts of IL -13-positive CD4+ lymphocytes in the perip heral blood of 
children with AD are significant ly correlated with AD severity  (14). Also, increased levels of 
IL-4 and IL -13 together with eosinophils in blood correlate with disease severity in both 
paediatric  and adult patients with AD  (15). Furthermore, IL-4/IL-[ADDRESS_746968]

been shown to be associated with an increa sed incidence of AD in children at age 2 ( 16, 17). 
Thus, across age groups there is compelling evidence for IL -[ADDRESS_746969]
Tralokinumab is a human recombinant monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin G4 
(IgG4) subclass that specifically binds to human IL -13 and blocks interactio n with the IL -13

In total, [ADDRESS_746970] been conducted in subjects with asthma, ulcerative 
colitis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and in healthy subjects.
In a phase 2b trial (D2213C00001), adults with moderate -to-severe AD on a background of 
mild to moderate topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930] (TCS) were treated with 3 different regimens of 
tralokinumab (45 mg every second week [Q2W], 150 mg Q2W, or 300 mg Q2W) or placebo 
to evaluate the safety and efficacy over a treatment period of 12 weeks. The primary 
endp oints were change from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) at Week 12 
and the percentage of subjects achieving Investigator ’s Global Assessment (IGA) response of 
0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) at Week 12. Secondary endpoints included change fr om baseline 
in EASI and Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) scores, and the percentage of subjects 
achieving at least 50% reduction from baseline in EASI and SCORAD scores (EASI50 and 
SCORAD50). In the overall intent -to-treat phase 2b population, an improve ment in EASI 
score at Week 12 was seen in the tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W group versus placebo. 26% of 
subjects achieved an IGA of 0 or 1 in the tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W group versus 12% in the 
placebo group. The most commonly reported causally related treatmen t-emergent adverse 
event (AE) was upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_1092] (6 subjects [3.9%] in the combined

group).
In total, more than 2,[ADDRESS_746971] been treated with tra lokinumab (cut -off date:

trials (58adolescent subjects exposed to tralok inumab). In these trials, the tralokinumab PK 
and safety profile (based on reporting of AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation of 
IMP) was largely similar in the adult and adolescent trial populations with asthma.

All doses studied so far ha ve had an acceptable benefit /risk profile and no major safety 
concerns have been identified. Possible risks associated with use of tralokinumab are 
summarised in Section 5.6.
5.3 Trial rationale
AD is a chronic inflammatory skin disease  which is more prevalent in children than in adults. 
No curative treatment of the disease is currentl y available. There is a clear and compelling 
unmet medical need for mo re effective  and safe treatments for moderate -to-severe AD in the 
paediatric age groups  as current immunosuppressive medications, such as cyclosporine, 
methotrexate, and azathioprine, are associated with long-term toxicities . TCS, especially those 
of high  potency, are associated with a variety of long -term safety concerns, including the 
systemic effects of absorbed corticosteroids such as adrenal suppression, poor growth, 
hypertension, hyperglycaemia, insulin resis tance, and cataracts, as well as local skin  damage 
and atrophy. These safety concerns are increased in paediatric patients, whose greater body 
surface area -to-weight ratio is thought to increase percutaneous absorption ( 21). Furthermore, 
AD is recognised to cause substantial morbidity and to have a serious impact on the 
psychological wellbeing and QoL in children ( 22).
Also t o fulfil  the regulatory requirements under the US Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA)  
(23), the EU regulation on medicinal products for paediatric use (24) and Internationa l 
Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E11 ( Guideline on the clinical investigation  of medicinal 
products in the p ediatric population)  (25), LEO Pharma A/S (hereafter LEO Pharma) is 
committed to conduct a trial with tralokinumab in  adolescent subjects with AD, aged 12 to 
<18years.  Hence, t he present trial is part of the paediatric clinical development programme of 
tralokinumab for AD, investigating the efficacy and safety of tralokinumab monotherapy in 
the treatment of adolescent subjects with moderate -to-severe AD who are inadequately 
controlled with topi[INVESTIGATOR_12491]. Furthermore, the trial is designed to gain valuable 
information on the PK of tralokinumab in this population and to select the d oses for a 
PK/safety  trial in younger  children ( 2 to <12years).  Based on input from the European  
Medicines Agency ’s (EMA ’s) Paediatric Committee (PDCO), 2 doses of tralokinumab will be 
evaluated in this trial to assess whether 300 mg or 150 mg tralokinumab would be the optimal 
dose in the adolescent population.
The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate whether tralokinumab provides more 
effective control of the skin manifestations of AD than does placebo. In addition, secondary 
endpoints addressing symptom scores and extent of AD (SCORAD), itch -related sleep loss 
and itch  severity, and health -related quality of life (H RQoL) measures related to AD  are also

included . As an exploratory component, the present tr ial will also investigate biomarkers 
related to AD, skin barrier function (in a subgroup of subjects), skin microbiology, and the 
potentia l impact of tralokinumab on these.
As AD is a chronic disease requiring long -term treatment, it is also relevant to evaluate the 
efficacy of tralokinumab as maintenance treatment. After the 16 -week initial treatment period, 
the trial will evaluate 2 differ ent treatment options for maintenance therapy , that is , dosing 
every 2 (Q2W) or every 4 weeks  (Q4W) .
Thus, the trial will contribute to th e characterisation of the benefit /risk profile of tralokinumab 
in the adolescent  population.
5.4 Justification for dose
The selected dose s for the initial treatment period in this trial is subcutaneously administered 
300 mg and 150 mg tralokinumab Q2W. All subjects randomised to receive treatment with 
tralokinumab will get an initial loading dose on Day 0 (baseline); subjec ts randomised to 
300mg will receive a loading dose of  [ADDRESS_746972]. The serum concentrations of tralokinu mab after the 600 mg loading dose will not 
exceed the serum tralokinumab concentrations at steady state for the 300 mg Q2W.
The 300 mg Q2W dose is also used in the ongoing phase  3 trials in adults.
Based on a  phase 1 trial in  20 adolescents (12 to 17 years) with asthma 
(trial CD-RI-CAT-354-1054) , the PK profile of a single  SC dose of tralokinumab ( 300 mg ) 
has been evaluated. Overall, the PK parameters including maximum serum concentration 
(Cmax), time of maximum serum concentration ( Tmax), and absolute clearance ( CL/F ) were 
largely similar to that observed in the adult population. Tralokinumab was well  tolerated, no 
serious adverse events ( SAEs ) were reported, and no confirmed  anti-drug antibodies ( ADA ) 
were detected after dosing.  Further, t he data from th is phase 1 trial  in adolescents with 
asthma , along with all available adult PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) data, were combined in 
a population PK -PD model . This model support ed the finding that t ralokinumab PK is dose -
linear and stationary with time , and that overall exposure and variability are similar between 
weight -based and non -weight -based dosing at the dose level of 300 mg Q2W .
The PK profile in adult subjects with AD in the phase 2b trial was comparable to the PK 
profile in adult and adolescent subjects with asthma . Given the relatively shallow dose -

Page 43 of 182
response between 150 mg and 300 mg and because the safety profile of tralokinuma b 300 mg 
was acceptable, both these doses will be included in this trial in adolescent subjects with AD, 
to establish the optimal dose in this population.
In the maintenance treatment period, subjects in 2 of the treatment arms will be dosed with 
tralokinu mab (either 300 mg or 150 mg) Q4W. This approach will allow the sponsor of the 
trial, LEO Pharma, to evaluate  whether less frequent dosing of tralokinumab (every 4 vs. 
every 2 weeks) may be sufficient for long-term maintenance of efficacy.

legally authorised representative(s) will give informed consent, and subjects must give their 
informed consent (assent) as appropriate and according to nat ional laws and regulations. No 
vulnerable subject incapable of giving informed consent will be enrolled in this clinical trial. 
Furthermore, female subjects  who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or trying to become pregnant 
will not be enrolled. Female subjects  of child bearing potential who are sexually active , must 
agree to use a highly effective method of c ontraception to prevent pregnancy during the 
clinical trial and until 16weeks after discontinuation of treatment with the investigational 
medicinal product  (IMP). In additio n, all female subjects of child bearing potential  will have a 
pregnancy test performed before, during , and at end of treatment to ensure that no foetuses are 
exposed to the IMP.
AD is a chronic and recurrent skin disorder and no curative t reatment of the disease  is 
currently available . Further, there is a clear and compelling unmet need for more effective, 
safe treatments for moderate -to-severe AD in the paediatric age groups. AD is widely 
prevalent in children including adolescents (26–28). Although AD usually presents as mild 
disease in the paediatric age group, around 10 -30% of children with AD may have moderate -
to-severe disease ( 29–31). AD is recognised to cause substantial morbidity and to have a 
serious impac t on the psychological wellbeing and QoL in children ( 22).
The efficacy of [ADDRESS_746974] appropriate if the present trial is conducted in the 
TMF-000042639 - Version 8. 0Anonymized Page 43
Trial ID: LP0162-1334 Date: 06-Feb-2020 Version: 7.[ADDRESS_746975], TCS and topi[INVESTIGATOR_22726] (TCI) have limited 
efficacy in patients with m oderate -to-severe disease.
Placebo control was considered  to provide the best design for efficient assessment of both 
benefit and risk in adolescents (12 to <18 years). Recognising that prolonged placebo 
treatment may not be optimal in this population, a 2 :1 (tralokinumab:placebo) randomisation 
is planned to increase the opportunity for subjects to receive active treatment. Furthermore, 
subjects who do not achieve a clinical response at Week 16 (including subjects randomised to 
placebo) will get the opportu nity to receive open -label tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W treatment 
with optional use of TCS, if considered appropriate by [CONTACT_093]. In addition , subjects 
may receive rescue treatment  at the discretion of the investigator if medically necessary (i.e., 
to control intolerable AD symptoms) through treatment and follow -up.
To ensure subject safety, investigators are informed only to enrol subjects they expect can 
complete wash -out of previous AD medications during the screening period without 
experiencing intolerable worsening of AD symptoms. In addition, subjects and/or their legally 
authorised representatives will be informed to contact [CONTACT_093], if the subject ’s AD 
worsens significantly.
In accordance with the current version of the ICH Good Clin ical Practice (GCP) guidelines, 
qualified medical personnel employed by [CONTACT_569681]-related medical questions. Medical monitoring will be performed throughout the trial. 
Safety data will be reviewed regularly by [CONTACT_569682] , and by [CONTACT_120578] (DMC , see Appendix 3 H) to ensure that prompt action is taken, if 
needed, to maximise patient safety.
In conclusion, the trial design chosen for this efficacy and safety trial on tralokinumab is 
regarded as ethically justified and adherent with ethical requirements.
5.6 Benefit/ risk assessment
Tralokinumab is a  new biological therapy under investigation for the treatment of moderate -
to-severe AD in both the adult and paediatric age groups. Based on the benefits in treating  AD 
reported with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], a m onoclonal antibody  that blocks the effects of IL -4 and IL -13 by 
[CONTACT_24096] a common receptor subunit ( 13, 32–34), there is a reasonable expectati on that 
tralokinumab will prove to be an effective treatment of moderate -to-severe AD.
TMF-000042639 - Version 8. 0Anonymized Page 44
Trial ID: LP0162-1334 Date: 06-Feb-2020 Version: 7.[ADDRESS_746976] in the benefit /risk evaluation is the reassuring safety profile of 
tralokinumab  in AD, asthma, ulcerative colitis, idiopa thic pulmonary fibrosis, and in trials 
with healthy subjects. Throughout an extensive clinical development programme in asthma, 
no safety concern has been identified with the use of tralokinumab , and tralokinumab w as 
well tolerated. The AE profile for tralokinumab has been comparable to that for placebo in 
controlled clinical trials. Injection -site reactions have generally been mild and ADAs have 
been detected in very few subjects exposed to tralokinumab for up to o ne year ; concerns 
about neutralising antibodies have not been raised. A number of theoretical potential risks 
have been identified that are described in the current version of the investigator's brochure, 
including hypersensitivity reactions, immune comple x disease, severe infections, 
malignancies, and interference with reproductive function . Measures are in place in this trial 
to protect participating subjects as follows:
xClose monitoring of subjects during the trial with trial visits every 2 weeks 
during the treatment period as described in the schedule of trial procedures  
(Section 4).
xClose monitoring of subjects during the post dosing period (at th e first 3 IMP 
dosing visits in  the initial treatment period  and in open -label treatment ) as a 
precautionary measure against hypersensi tivity reactions (further details are 
given in Section 11.4.1 ).
xMonitoring of subjects for clinical manifestations that may be associated with 
the development of specific antibodies to tralokinumab (i.e., immune complex 
disease).
xExclusion of subjects w ith untreated systemic helminth infestations or subjects 
who have failed to respond to standard of care therapy (neutralisation of IL -13 
might theoretically cause a worsening of parasitic infestation, in particular, 
prevention of expulsion of gastrointesti nal worms (helminths) [ 35]).
xExclusion of subjects with a history of tuberculosis requiring treatment within 
12 months prior to the screening visit .

xExclusion of subjects with a history of a clinically significant infection 
(defined as a systemic or serious skin infection requiring parenteral antibiotics, 
antiviral, or anti fungal  medication , see Section 8.3) within 4 weeks prior to 
baseline which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26335]'s medical expert, 
may compromise the safety of the subject in the trial.
In conclusion, previous clinica l experience with tralokinumab shows no major safety or 
tolerability concerns and appropriate measures have been instituted in this trial to protect 
subjects from possible risks that have been prev iously identified and to closely monitor each 
subject. The current benefit/ risk profile is considered favourable and supports the 
administration of tralokinumab for the purposes  of achieving the objectives of this trial.

7Trial design
7.1 Overall trial design
Overview
This is a phase 3 , randomised, double -blinded, placebo -controlled trial in ad olescent subjects 
aged 12 to <[ADDRESS_746977] of a screening  period 
of 2 to 6 weeks (Weeks -6/-2 to 0), an initial treatment period of 16 weeks (Weeks 0 to 16) 
and a maintenance treatment period of 36 weeks (Weeks 16 to 52). The primary endpoint is 
assessed at Week 16, and the final efficacy assessment will be cond ucted at Week 52. 
A14-week  follow -up period for the assessment of safety is also included (Weeks 52 to 66) . 
Subjects who transfer to ECZTEND before completing the safety follow -up visit in the 
present trial will  have their safety follow -up visit in ECZTEN D. Subjects without clinical 
response at Week 16 , subjects who receive rescue treatment  from  the Week 2 visit to the Week 
16 visit (hereinafter “Week 2 to Week 16”), and subjects who lose their response during the 
maintenance period will be transferred  to open -label treatment (tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W 
with optional use of TCS  and/or TCI ) if they meet certain criteria  (see below) , and if 
considered appropriate by [CONTACT_093]. Transfer to open -label treatment may occur at any 
visit from Week [ADDRESS_746978] is in the maintenance treatment period.
A schematic of the trial design is provided in Panel 1.
Screening period (Week -6 to Week 0)
Prior to attending any trial procedure, a signed informed consent must be obtained from the 
subject’s legally authorised representative(s) and from the subject (as appropriate and 
according to national laws and regulations). The screening period has a mini mum duration of 
[ADDRESS_746979] depends on the length of any wash -
out period needed  (as also specified in the exclusion cr iteria in Section 8.3):
x6 weeks for subjects using tanning beds or phototherapy .
x4weeks for subjects using  systemic immunosuppressive/immunomodulating drugs, 
systemic corticosteroid use, or ≥3bleach baths during any week within the 4weeks .
x2 weeks for subjects using  TCS, TCI , or topi[INVESTIGATOR_22724] 4 (PDE -4) 
inhibitors.
If no wash -out or a 2 -week wash -out period is required, screening will be reduced to 2 weeks 
and reduced to 1 visit (Week -2; visit 2), i.e., the 2 screening visits will be merged. Eligibility 
TMF-000042639 - Version 8. 0Anonymized Page 50

will be assessed at the (first) screening visit and on Day 0 (hereinafter “baseline ”) prior to  
randomisation.
All subjects will attend a screening visit 14 days before baseline (Week -2; visit 2) where they 
will receive electronic diary (eDiary) training and start  completion of  the electronic patient -
reported outcome  (ePRO ) questionnaires in the  eDiary. Data entered into the eDiary during 
the 2 weeks before randomisation will be used to calculate baseline values of the patient -
reported outcomes (PROs).
All subjects will use an emollient twice daily (or more, as needed) for at least 14 days before 
randomisation and will continue this treatment throughout the trial (including safety follow -
up). Subjects will initiate emollient treatment no later than the W eek -2 visit.
Initial treatment period (Week 0 to Week 16)
Following the screening period, approximately 29 4subjects will be randomised 1:1:1 to one 
of the following groups stratified by [CONTACT_11338] (Europe, North America, Australia, and Japan) 
and baseline disease severity (IGA of 3 or 4) :
xTralokinumab 300 mg  Q2W : tralokinumab 600 mg ( loading dose ) at baseline, 
then tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W.
xTralokinumab 150 mg Q2W: tralokinumab 300 mg ( loading dose) at baseline, 
then tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W.
xPlacebo  Q2W:  place bo (loading dose ) at baseline, then placebo Q2W.
To ensure blinding, all treatment groups will receive the same number of injections at each 
visit. Thus, the tralokinumab 150 mg group will receive both tralokinumab and placebo 
injections at all dosing visits.
Maintenance treatment period (Week 16 to Week 52)
Subjects achieving a clinical response at Week 16 without use of rescue treatment  (from 
Week 2 to Week 16) will continue into maintenance treatment that runs until Week 52.
Clinical response  is defi ned as IGA of [ADDRESS_746980] 75% reduction in EASI score from 
baseline (EASI75).  
Subjects randomised to tralokinumab in the initial treatment period will be re -randomised 1:1 
to one of the following maintenance regimens stratified by [CONTACT_569683] r esponse at 
Week 16 (IGA 0/1 or IGA >1) . 
Subjects initially randomised to tralokinumab 300 mg  will receive :

xTralokinumab 300 mg Q2W .
xTralokinumab 300 mg Q4W: a lternating dose administrations of tralokinumab 
300 mg or placebo.
Subjects initially randomised to tralokinumab 150 mg  will receive :
xTralokinumab 150 mg Q2W .
xTralokinumab 150 mg Q4W: alternating dose administrations of tralokinumab 
150 mg or placebo.
Subjects randomised to placebo in the initial treatment period who achieve a clinical response 
at Wee k 16 without use of rescue treatment  from Week 2 to Week 16 will continue to receive 
placebo Q2W in the maintenance treatment period.
Open -label treatment (Week 16 to Week 52)
Subjects without clinical response at Week [ADDRESS_746981] receive d rescue 
treatment  from Week 2 to Week 16  will be transferred to open -label treatment (tralokinumab 
300mg Q2W with optional use of TCS  and/or TCI ) at Week 16, if considered appropriate by 
[CONTACT_093].
In addition , subjects may be transferred from maintenance treatment to open -label treatment if 
they meet any of the criteria listed below , and if considered appropriate by [CONTACT_093] . 
Transfer to open -label treatment may occur at any visit from Week [ADDRESS_746982] is in  
the maintenance treatment period.
Subjects with IGA=0 at Week 16:
xIGA of at least [ADDRESS_746983] a 4 -week period (i.e., 
over 3 consecutive visits).
Subjects with IGA=1 at Week 16:
xIGA of at least [ADDRESS_746984] a 4 -week period (i.e., 
over 3 consecutive visits).

Subjects who rece ive rescue treatment :
xIf rescue treatment is administered during the maintenance treatment period , 
subjects  should be transferred to open -label treatment .
For subjects who receive systemic rescue treatment , the open -label treatment 
may not be initiated sooner than [ADDRESS_746985] dose of the systemic 
rescue treatment .
Subjects who are transferred to open -label treatment will continue their scheduled visit 
sequence.  The open -label treatment will extend to Week 52  (last dose administered at 
Week 50).
Safety follow -up period (Week 52 to Week 66)
After completion of the trea tment periods or premature discontinuation  of IMP , all subjects  
will complete a n off-treatment follow -up period for the assessment of safety, PK, and 
immunogenicity (i.e.  ADA ), except subjects who transfer to ECZTEND before Week  66 (see 
below). During follow -up, subjects will be allowed to receive standard of AD care (excluding 
biologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) at the investigator ’s discretion, if needed.
Long -term extension trial  (LP0162 -1337, ECZTEND)
Eligible subjects from selected countries may be invited to enter a long -term extension trial 
conducted under a separate protocol (LP0162 -1337, ECZTEND). Subjects who transfer to 
ECZTEND, must have had their last visit in th e treatment period (Week 52) under the current 
protocol (LP0162 -1334). Subjects may enter ECZTEND up to [ADDRESS_746986] IMP 
injection in the present trial (Week 50) to their first IMP injection in ECZTEND (baseline). 
Subjects may therefore enter ECZTEND (baseline) without completing the safety follow up 
visit ([ADDRESS_746987] IMP  injection ) in the present trial, and those subjects will have 
their safety follow -up visit in ECZTEND.
Analysis of data per last subject ’s last Week 52 visit
To fulfil the com mitments in the paediatric investigation plan (PIP ) and the paediatric study 
plan (PSP), the trial will be unblinded to an analysis group once all randomised subjects have 
completed the Week 52 visit  and available data will be analysed and reported (See 
Section 9.3.1  for details) .

7.2 Number of subjects needed
Assuming a screening failure rate of 25%, approximately 392 subjects will be screened and 
approximately 294 subjects will be randomly assigned to the initial treatment period (1:1:1 to 
tralokinumab 300 mg, tralokinumab 150 mg , or placebo). At Week 16, approximately 40% of 
the tralokinumab -treated subjects are expected to be re-randomised (1:1 to tralokinumab Q2W 
or tralokinumab Q4W) into the main tenance treatment period. Randomisation and re -
randomisation will be handled using the interactive response technology ( IRT) to ensure 
continued blinding in the trial .
The statistical power considerations for this sample size are described in Section 14.1.
This trial will be conducted at approximately 80sites in Europe, North America , Australia , 
and Japan . The anticipated minimum number of randomised  subjects per trial site is [ADDRESS_746988] completed all periods of the 
trial including the final safety follow -up visit at Week 66 . Subjects who enter the long -term 
extension trial (LP0162 -1337, ECZTEND) after completion of  the end of treatment visit 
(Week 52) will also be considered as trial completers.  The end of the trial is defined as the 
date of the last visit of the last subject in the trial globally .
Final collection of data for the primary endpoint occurs at Week 16.
7.4 Software
CDISC controlled terminology dated  22-Dec-2017 (or newer ) was used for definition of 
controlled terminology throughout this protocol and will be used for  statistical programming

Screenin g failures  
Screen ingfailures are defined as subjects for whom consent to participate in the trial has been 
obtained but who are not subsequently randomly assigned to trial treatment. A minimal set of 
screen ing failure information is required to ensure tra nsparent reporting of screen ing failure 
subjects to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (C ONSORT) publishing 
requirements (37) and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities.
The following data will be collected in the eCRF for screening failures:
xDate of informed consent .
xDemographics (age, sex, ethnicity, race) .
xReason for screen failure :
oFailure to meet randomisation criteri a.
oLost to follow -up.
oWithdrawal by [CONTACT_1130] .
oWithdrawal by [CONTACT_7078]/guardian.
oOther.
xDate of screen failure .
xAny adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) .
In case of any SAEs, these must be followed  up as described in Section 13.7.
Re-screening of screening failures is not allowed . However, if the reason for screening failure 
is administrative and not due to the subject failing to meet the eligibility criteria, re -screening 
may be permitted (this will require approval by [CONTACT_456] ’s medical expert [INVESTIGATOR_569714] ). Individuals who are 
re-screened will get a new subject ID.

Dosing visits are shown in the schedule of trial procedures (Section 4). The last administration 
of IMP will occur at Week 50. To ensure  blinding, all treatment groups will receive the same 
number of injections at each visit ; thus, the tralokinumab 150 mg group will receive both 
tralokinumab and placebo injections at all dosing visits .

Trial ID: LP0162-1334 Date: 06-Feb-2020 Version: 7.[ADDRESS_747002] day of dosing is considered Day 0 (visit 3 , baseline ). Each subject will receive 4 SC 
injections (each of 1mL) to receive a loading dose of tralokinumab or placebo. At subsequent 
visits in the initial treatment period, each subjec t will receive 2 SC injections (each of 1mL).
Hence, subjects in the initial  treatment period will receive either:
xTralokinumab 300 mg Q2W : tralokinumab 600 mg (4 mL) at baseline, then 
tralokinumab 300 mg (2 mL) Q2W.
xTralokinumab 150 mg Q2W: tralokinumab 300 mg (2 mL) + placebo (2 mL) at 
baseline, then tralokinumab 150 mg (1 mL) + placebo (1 mL) Q2W.
xPlacebo Q2W : placebo (4 mL) at baseline, then placebo (2 mL) Q2W.
At Week 16, subjects with a clinical response (achieve d without use of rescue treatment from 
Week 2 to Week 16) will continue to receive 2 SC injections (each of 1 mL) of maintenance 
treatment until Week 50:
xTralokinumab Q2W :
oTralokinumab 30 0 mg : tralokinumab 300 mg (2 mL).
oTralokinumab 150 mg: tralokinumab 150 mg (1 mL) + placebo 
(1mL).
xTralokinumab Q4W (alternating dose administrations of tralokinumab and 
placebo) :
oTralokinumab 300 mg: tralokinumab 300 mg (2 mL) or 2mL 
placebo.
oTralokinumab 150 mg: tralokinumab 150 mg (1 mL) + placebo

xPlacebo Q2W : 2 SC injections (each 1 mL) of placebo .
Subjects who are transferred to open -label treatment will receive 2 SC injections (each 1 mL) 
of tralokinumab 150mg at each dosing visit.
IMP will be administered by a qualified, unblinded healthcare professional (HCP; see 
Section 9.3.1  for blinding details). A minimum interval of 7 days is required between 2 dosing 
visits. No specifi c treatment for an overdose  is recommended . The investigator will use 
clinical judg ement  to treat any overdose if necessary. See Section 13.6.2  for further details 
regarding overdose.

and in open -label treatment , subjects will be monitored  prior to and  after IMP administration 
for immediate drug reactions for a minimum of 2 hours with vital signs taken every  30 
minutes or until stable, whicheve r is later . Vital signs will be documented in the eCRF.
As with any antibody, allergic reactions to dose administration are possible. The World 
Allergy Organization has categorised anaphylaxis into 2 subgroups: allergic anaphylaxis 
(mediated by [CONTACT_73295]) and nonallergic anaphylaxis (which has a 
nonimmunologic cause) ( 38). The clinical criteria for defining anaphylaxis for this trial a re 
listed in Appendix [ADDRESS_747005] as so on as 
possible after the event, at 60 minutes ± 30 minut es after the event, and at discharge, for 
analysis of serum tryptase at the central laboratory.
Conditions requiring rescheduling of IMP administration  
If any of the following should occur, the investigator should reschedule the visit and IMP 
should not be administered until the rescheduled visit:
xThe subject has an intercurrent illness that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], 
may compromise the safety of the subject in the trial (e.g., viral il lnesses).
xThe subject is febrile (defined as ≥38°C) within 72 hours prior to IMP 
administration.

Subjects eligible for the maintenance part of the trial will be re -randomised to maintenance 
treatment at Week 16. Subjects randomised to tralokinumab (150 or 300 mg) who have a 
clinical response at Week 16 (i.e. IGA 0/1 or EASI75 , achieved without use of rescue 
treatment  from Week 2 to Week 16 ), will be re -randomised to the maintenance  treatment

by [CONTACT_421454] 16 (IGA 0/1 or IGA >1). Subjects randomised to placebo 
who have a clinical response at Week 16 (achieved without use of rescue tr eatment  from 
Week 2 to Week 16) will continue on placebo.
Subjects who are not eligible for the ma intenance part of the trial will be transferred to open -

assessments.  If needed, the unblinded  HCP may perform the safety assessments (except 
assessment of AEs) for subjects in open -label treatment.
If treatment allocation for a subject becomes known to the investigator or other trial staff 
involved in the management of trial subjects, LEO Pharma must be notified immediately.
Should an issue arise with the IMP (e.g., damaged kit or syringe that has been assigned to a 
subject prior to administration, or any other unex pected event with the kit or syringe [e.g., a 
malfunction during IMP administration ]), the unblinded HCP at the site will contact [CONTACT_60289] (CRA) to deter mine whether any specific actions are required.  See 
Section  9.[ADDRESS_747008] complaints.
The trial site will maintain a written plan de tailing which staff members are blinded/unblinded 
and the process of IMP administration used to maintain the blind.
Analysis of data per last subject ’s We ek 52 visit
To fulfil the com mitments in the PIP and the PSP,  an analysis of trial data up to and including 
visit 29 (Week 52) will be performed and will require unblinding of data. To perform this 
analysis, an analysis group consisting of Clinical Pharmacologists, Medical Experts, Safety 
Advisors, Statisticians, Statistical Programmers and Medical Writers will be unblinded to 
individual subject treatment allocation following database lock for the 52-week data. All staff 
involved in the c onduct of the trial will remain blinded to treatment allocation for the entire 
duration of the trial. This principle will be applied to all investigator staff and to staff 
employed by [CONTACT_569685].

randomisation; the background treatment should preferably be an additive free, basic bland 
emollient. Subjects must continue their b ackground emollient treatment throughout the trial.
9.5 Rescue treatment
If medically necessary (i.e., to control intolerable AD sympto ms), rescue treatment for AD 
may be provided to trial subjects at the discretion of the investigator. Prohibited medications 
and procedures are described in Section 9.7.
Subjects who receive topi[INVESTIGATOR_483579] (TCS of any WHO class  [see Appendix 6 ], or 
TCI)  will continue treatment with IMP.
If possible, investigators should attempt to limit the first step of rescue treatment  to topi[INVESTIGATOR_73211] , and escalate to systemic treatments only for subjects who do not respond 
adequately after at least [ADDRESS_747012] receives rescue treatment with systemic corticosteroids or non -steroidal systemic 
immunosuppressive drugs (cyclos porine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, 
etc.), IMP will be immediately discontinued (see Section 10.2.2 , reasons for temporary 
discontinuation of IMP). After the treatment wi th these medications is completed, IMP may 
be resumed if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_093], but not sooner than [ADDRESS_747013] efficacy and safety assessments (at least 
disease severity scores [IGA and EASI], concomitant medications/procedures, and  AEs) 
immediately before administering any rescue treatment. An unscheduled visit may be used for 
this purpose, if necessary.

Trial ID: LP0162-1334 Date: 06-Feb-2020 Version: 7.[ADDRESS_747025] may permanently discontinue trial treatment (IMP) or withdraw from the trial at any 
time (prior to first dose or during the treatment period) if the subject, the subjects’ legally 
authorised representative(s), the investigator,  or LEO Pharma considers that it is not in the 
subject ’s best interest to continue.
In order to obtain the most representative efficacy evaluation of tralokinumab in adolescents, 
it is key to assess the effi cacy status of each trial participant at the planned primary endpoint 
visit (nominal Week 16 visit [visit 11x, Panel 2]), irrespective of whether the subject has 
discontinued IMP or not.  Therefore, permanent discontinuation of IMP is evaluated as a 
separate occurrence  that does not necessitate  that the subject also withdraw s from the trial . 
This is to enable selected subsequent trial visit s to be conducted, including the nominal 
Week 16 visit (if discontinuation of IMP occurs prior to Week 16).
Hence, permanent discontinuation of IMP and withdrawal from trial are considered to be 
2(potentially ) separate occurrences :
xPermanent discontinuation of IMP  occurs when all further trial treatment is 
stopped. The subject  will continue to participate in selected  trial visit activities 
as outlined in Section 10.2.[ADDRESS_747026] planned safety follow -up visit (Week 66 ). This may either 
happen at the time of permanent discontinuation of IMP or later.
Subjects who permanently disco ntinue IMP and subjects who withdraw from the trial will not 
be replaced.
10.2 IMP discontinuation rules
10.2.1 Reasons for permanent discontinuation of IMP
Subjects will permanently disco ntinue  IMP in the event of:
xAnaphylactic reaction or other severe systemic reaction to IMP injection.
xAn AE that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26335] ’s medical expert, 
contraindicates further dosing.
TMF-000042639 - Version 8. 0Anonymized Page 74
Trial ID: LP0162-1334 Date: 06-Feb-2020 Version: 7.[ADDRESS_747027] an immuno -compromised 
status.
xSevere laboratory abnormalities:
oALT and/or AST values >3 ×ULN with total bilirubin >2×ULN (unless 
elevated bilirubin is related to Gilbert Meulengracht Syndrome) .
oConfirmed AST and/or ALT >5×ULN (for more than 2 weeks) .
Subjects in open -label treatment (tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W with optional use of TCS  and/or 
TCI) who in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_121479] , the subjects’ legally authorised representative(s),  or 
investigator have unacceptable treatment ef fect of tralokinumab may discontinue open -label 
treatment and enter the safety follow -up period.
10.2.2 Reasons for temporary di scontinuation of IMP
IMP dosing may be temporarily suspended in th e event of:
xOther intercurrent illnesses or major surgery.
xAn infection that requires parenteral treatment with antibiotic, antifungal, 
antiviral, anti -parasitic, or anti -protozoal agents.
xTreatment with systemic corticosteroids or non -steroidal 
immunosuppressive/immunomodulating medications (e.g., cyclosporine, 
methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, Janus kinase inhibitors, 
biologic agents).
After the treatment with these medications is completed, IMP may be resumed if deemed 
appropriate by [CONTACT_093], but not sooner than [ADDRESS_747028] dose of systemic 
therapy.
10.3 Early termination assessments
Permanent discontinuation of IMP
Subjects who permanently discontinue IMP for any reason will be asked to attend an early 
termination visit and return to the trial site for 1 or 2addit ional visits as indicated below. S ee

the schedule of trial procedures (Section 4) for data to be collected at these visits . The 
investigator will review any AEs which will be followed  up according to Section 13.7, if the 
subject agrees.
Subjects who permanently discontinue IMP prior to Week 16 will be asked to attend:
xEarly termination visit.
xNominal Week 16 visit ( 16weeks after randomisation).
xFinal s afety follow -up visit ( [ADDRESS_747029] administration of IMP).
Subjects who permanently discontinue IMP at Week 16 or after Week 16 will be asked to 
attend:
xEarly termination visit.
xFinal s afety follow -up visit ([ADDRESS_747030] administratio n of IMP).
Withdrawal from trial
A subject may withdraw from the trial at any time and for any reason. Subjects who withdraw 
from the trial should attend an early termination visit  (if applicable) , see the schedule of trial 
procedures (Section 4) for data to be collected at an early termination visit. The investigator 
will review any AEs which will be followed  up according to Section 13.7, if the subject 
agrees.  If a subject withdraws from the trial, they  may request destruction of any samples 
taken and not tested, and the invest igator must document this in the site ’s trial records.
Data to be recorded in the eCRF
The primary reason for permanent discontinuati on of IMP must be recorded in the medical 
records and on the end of treatment form in the eCRF . Similarly, t he primary reas on for 
withdrawal from trial must be recorded in the medical records and on the end of trial form in 
the eCRF. In both instances,  the following reasons  will be used in the eCRF : lack of efficacy, 
AE, withdrawal by [CONTACT_1130], withdrawal by [CONTACT_7078]/guardian, lost to follow -up, death, other.
For subjects who do not attend the nominal Week 16 visit (visit 11x) or the safety follow -up 
visit, the primary reason for not attending these visits will be recorded in the medical records 
and in the eCRF using the following reasons: lack of efficacy, AE, withdrawal by [CONTACT_1130], 
withdrawal by [CONTACT_7078]/guardian, lost to follow -up, death, other.
If ‘adverse event ’ or ‘other ’ is selected, a specification must be provided in the eCRF.

xOther assessments (skin swabs , skin tape strippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] [if applicable] , 
transepi[INVESTIGATOR_7044] [if applicable] , height and weight ).
xAdministration of IMP.
Subjects may also need to be seen at unscheduled visits during the course of the trial. The 
assessments to be performed at an unscheduled visit are left at the investigator ’s discretion 
(could include any assessment performed at an early termination visit) ( Panel 3).
Subjects participating in the trial wil l be under careful supervision of a principal investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_569657] . Investigators must be experienced in treating AD and 
have documented experience and/or training in use of the assessments required by [CONTACT_569688] a physician , certified physician ’s assistant, or advanced registered 
nurse practitioner.
AEs must be assessed by [CONTACT_82048] (Section 13.2).
To reduce inter -rater variability, t he same investigator should preferably perform all the 
efficacy evaluations (IGA, EASI, SCORAD) for a given subject throughout the entire trial 
period.
The investigators performing the assessments mu st not be involved in the administration of 
IMP (Section 9.3.1 ).

11.2.4 Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale
The C -SSRS Screening version is a rater -administered instrument used to assess severity of 
suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviour through a series of simple, plain -language 
questions (40). The C -SSRS must be completed at the scre ening visit to check that exclusion 
criterion no. 26 does not apply.
11.3 Efficacy assessments
11.3.1 Investigator ’s Global Assessment
The IGA is an instrument used in clinical trials to rate the severity of the subject ’s global AD 
and is  based on a 5 -point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe)  (Panel 8). The IGA score 
will be assessed according to the schedule of trial procedures (Section 4). The assessment will 
be based on the condition of the disease at the time of evaluation and not in relation to the 
condition at a previous visit.  The IGA is included in the efficacy assessment & C -SSRS 
manual.

11.3.2 Eczema Area and Severity Index
The EASI is a validat ed measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the 
severity and extent of AD ( 41). The EASI score will be assessed according to  the schedule of 
trial procedures (Section 4). The assessment will be based on the condition of the disease at 
the time of evaluation and not in relation to th e condition at a previous visit . Details on the 
scoring of severity and exten t of AD according to EASI are included in the efficacy 
assessment & C -SSRS manual.
The EASI is a composite index with scores ranging from 0 to 72, with higher values 
indicating more severe or more extensive condition . The index will be calculated as shown in 
Panel 9. Briefly, t he investigator will assess the severity of 4 AD disease characteristics 
(erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification) on the 4body regions 
(head/neck, trunk , upper extremities , lower extremities ); severity will be assessed according 
to the scale shown in Panel 10. For each body region, a severity sum score  will be calculated 
which will be multiplied by [CONTACT_73307] (Panel 10) and by a weigh ting factor . The EASI 
score equals the sum of the scores obtained for each body region ( Panel 9).

11.3.3 Scoring Atopic Dermatitis
The SCORAD is a validated tool to evaluate the extent and severity of AD  lesions,  along with 
subjective symptoms (43). The maximum total  score is 103, with higher values indicating 
more severe disease. SCORAD w ill be assessed according to the schedule of trial procedures 
(Section 4).
The assessment will be based on the condition of the disease at the time of evaluation and not 
in relation to the condition at a previous visit. Whenever possible, SCORAD should be 
assessed  by [CONTACT_421467] -rater variability.
The assessment consists of 3 components: A = extent , B = intensity , and C = subjective 
symptoms
Extent (A)
The extent  of AD is assessed as a percentage of each defined body area and reported as the 
sum of all areas (maximum score = 100%)
Intensity (B)
The intensity  of 6 specific symptoms of AD (erythema, oedema/p apulation, oozing/crusting , 
excoriation, lichenification , and dryness) is assessed by [CONTACT_421468]:
0 = None/absent
1 = Mild
2 = Moderate
3 = Severe
Note: dryness is evaluated on uninvolved areas.

The sum of intensity score of the 6 symptoms  will be reported (maximum score = 18 ).
Subjective symptoms (C)
A subjective assessment of the average itch and sleeplessness over the last 3 days/nights is 
recorded for each symptom by [CONTACT_1175] a visual analogue scale , where 0 is no itch (or 
sleeplessness) and [ADDRESS_747034] imaginable itch (or sleeplessness), with a maximum 
possible score of 20.
The SCORAD is calculated  as: A/5+7B/2+C
11.3.4 Patient -reported outcomes
[IP_ADDRESS] Overview
3 PROs will be assessed using an eDiary:
xEczema -related Sleep NRS.
xAdolescent  Pruritus NRS.
xAdolescent Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI -S [today recall] ).
Subjects will receive eDiary training at th e screening visit 14 days before baseline (Week -2; 
visit 2) and then start the eDiary.
In addi tion, 5 PROs will be completed by [CONTACT_547719]:
xCDLQI.
xPOEM .
xAdolescent PGI -S (past week recall).
xPatient Global Impression of Change (PGI -C).
xHADS .
All PROs are included in the investigator trial file.
[IP_ADDRESS] Eczema -related Sleep numeric rating scale
Subjects will rate how much their eczema interfered with their sleep the last night using an 
11-point  NRS (0 indicating that it ‘did not interfere ’ and 10 indicating that it ‘completely 
interfered ’). Subjects will complete the Eczema -related Sleep NRS as part of an eDiary each 
day in the morning from Week -2 (visit 2) until Week 52.

[IP_ADDRESS] Adolescent  Pruritus numeric rating scale
Subjects will assess their worst itch over the past 24 hours using an 11 -point NRS 
(‘Adolescent  Pruritus NRS ’) with 0 indicating ‘no itch’ and 10 indicating ‘worst itch 
possible ’. Subjects will complete the Adolescent  Pruritus NRS as part of an eDiary each day 
in the morning from Week -2 until Week 52.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adolescent Patient Global Impr ession of Severity  (today recall)
The Adolescent PGI-S (today recall)  is a single item designed to capture the subject ’s 
perception of overall eczema symptom severity on the day of assessment  on a 4 -point 
categorical response scale (‘not bad at all ’ to ‘very bad ’). Subjects will complete this item as 
part of the eDiary each day in the morning from Week -2 until Week 16.
[IP_ADDRESS] Children ’s Dermatology Life Quality Index
The CDLQI  questionnaire  is designed and  validated in subjects with dermatological 
conditions from 5 to 16 years  (45-47). The CDLQI is available in text and cartoon versions  
(48-50). The text version will be used  in this trial . It consists of [ADDRESS_747035] ’s perception of the impact of their skin disease on various aspects  of their QoL over 
the last week such as dermatology -related symptoms and feelings, leisure, school  or holiday s, 
personal rela tionships,  sleep,  and the treatment (51). Each item is scored on a 4-point  Likert 
scale (0 =‘not at all’; 1=‘only a little ’; 2=‘quite a lot’; 3=‘very much ’). The item on 
school time (item 7) has one additional response category ‘prevented school ’, which is also 
scored ‘3’. The total score is the sum of the 10 items (0 to 30); a high score is indicative of a 
poor QoL. The CDLQI will be complete d at the trial site according to the schedule of trial 
procedures in Section 4.
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient -Oriented Eczema Measure
The POEM  is a validated questionnaire used to as sess disease symptoms in atopic eczema 
patients in both clinical practice and clinical trials ( 52). The too l consists of 7 items each 
addressing a specific symptom (itching, sleep, bleeding, weepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], cracking, flaking, and 
dryness). Subject s will score how often they have experienced each symptom over the 
previous week on a 5 -point categorical response scale (0  = ‘no days ’; 1 = ‘1 to 2 days ’; 
2=‘3to 4 days ’; 3 = ‘5 to 6’ days; 4 = ‘every day ’). The total score is the sum of the 7 items 
(range 0 to 28) and reflects disease -related morbidity; a high score is indicative of a worse 
disease severity. The POEM will  be completed at the trial site according to the schedule of 
trial procedures in Section 4.

response scale (‘none ’ to ‘severe ’ The Adolescent PGI -S (past we ek recall) will be completed 
at the trial site according to the schedule of trial procedures in Section 4.
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient Global Impression of Change
The PGI-C is a single item questionnaire designed to assess the subject ’s impression of 
changes ( 44). The subjects select the one response from the res ponse options (‘much better ’, 
‘a little better ’, ‘no change ’, ‘a little worse ’, or ‘much worse ’) that best describes the overall 
change in their itch since they started IMP treatment. The PGI -C will be completed at the trial 
site according to the schedule of trial procedures in Section  4.
[IP_ADDRESS] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_321280] a Likert scale tool widely used to detect states  of anxiety and depression in a 
general hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885] ( 53). The tool consists of [ADDRESS_747036] ’s anxiety 
(7items) and depre ssion (7 items) during the last week. Ea ch question is scored from 0 to 3, 
with high scores indicating a poor state. The HADS will be completed electronically on the 
device supplied to the trial site according to the schedule of procedures  in Section 4.
11.4 Safety assessments
11.4.1 Vital signs
Vital signs (resting blood pressure, pulse,  and body temperature) must be assessed according 
to the schedule of trial procedures (Section 4). Vital signs will be measured in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_548811] [ADDRESS_747037] 3 IMP dosing visits in the initial treatment period (i.e., Weeks 0, 2, and 4)  and in 
open -label treatment , subjects will be monitored prior to and after IMP administration for 
immediate drug reactions for a minimum of 2 hours with vital signs taken every 30 minutes or 
until stable, whichever is later  (Section 9.2).
If an abnormal vital sign at screening is considered to be clinically significant  by [CONTACT_1275] , it will be at the discretion of the investigator  if the subject should be r andomis ed 
into the trial  (respecting exclusion criterion no.28).

12 Scientific rationale for trial design and a ppropriateness of assessments
Scientific r ationale for trial design
LEO Pharma is aiming for a global paediatric development programme for tralokinumab, and 
the trial design of the present trial has been submitted to both the European (EMA and PDCO) 
and American health authorities (US Food and Drug Administration [FDA]) for review.
The trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tralokinumab versus placebo in 
adolescent subjects with moderate -to-severe AD. The trial endpoints have been selected to 
evaluate the efficacy of tralokinumab in improving the severity and extent of AD including 
both objective signs of disease and subjective symptoms (e.g. itch) as well as HRQoL .
The planned trial design is considered appropriate for evaluating the trial objectives, as the 
double -blind conditions regarding the subject ’s treatment (tralokinumab or placebo) are 
maintained and the possible observer bias regarding treatment effects are minimised. 
Stratification by [CONTACT_11338] (Europe , North America , Australia , and Japan ) and baseline disea se 
severity (IGA 3 or 4) in this multi -centre  trial will provide a strong basis for generalisation of 
the findings to the target patient population. Further, the trial population will comprise male 
and female subjects to explore differences in effects betw een genders and across the 
adolescent age range.
By [CONTACT_2329] a placebo -controlled parallel -group design for the initial treatment period, 
superiority of tralokinumab to placebo can be investigated  and will allow for a better 
understanding of tralokinumab effi cacy in relation to PK in adolescents. This contrasts with a 
design where tralokinumab is used as add -on to best standard  of care (e.g. TCS) where there 
will be confounding influence by [CONTACT_569690], 
particularly in c ase of unbalanced use. Precise dose -finding is essential because going forward 
unnecessary exposure should be avoided in adolescents and because the PK modelling also 
guides dose -selection for younger age groups in future paediatric trials with tralokinuma b.
The most important inclusion criterion for entry into the trial is a diagnosis of AD (as defined 
by [CONTACT_85811] 1980 criteria for AD) ( 36) at screening and a history of AD for at 
least one year, to ensure correct diagnosis and rule out differential diagnosis. A prerequisite 
for inclusion into the trial is a documented history of topi[INVESTIGATOR_547675] (due to 
inadequate response),  to ensure that the subject is candidate for systemic treatment.
TMF-000042639 - Version 8. 0Anonymized Page 96
Trial ID: LP0162-1334 Date: 06-Feb-2020 Version: 7.[ADDRESS_747045] as well as the safety and tolerability of tralokinumab  in adolescents 
with A D.
Appropriateness of assessments
The clinical efficacy of tralokinumab treatme nt will be assessed by [CONTACT_78442], EASI, and 
SCORAD:
xIGA is a key instrument used in clinical trials to rate the severity of the 
subject ’s global AD.
xEASI is a validated measure used i n clinical practice and clinical trials to 
assess the severity and extent of AD ( 41).
xSCORAD is a validated tool to assess the extent and severity of AD lesions 
and subjective symptoms ( 43).
The efficacy endpoints IGA score of 0 or 1 and EASI75 are recognised as important endpoints 
in clinical  trials in AD by [CONTACT_548872] , EU, and Japan .
Several validated patient -reported questionnaires (CDLQI, POEM, HADS) have been 
included to assess the efficacy of tralokinumab on patient -reported outcomes and HRQoL .
Blood concentrations of tralokinumab will be analysed using validated bioanalytical methods  
and standard PK parameters will be derived  to evaluate the tralokinumab exposure in 
adolescents .
The pharmacodynamic effect of tralokinumab tr eatment will be assessed using established 
assays to quantify serum levels of selected cytokines (IL -22 and CCL17) as well as IgE.  In 
this trial, biomarker mRNA expression will be analysed from blood mononuclear cells to 
assess the response to treatment and to id entify new biomarkers of relevance for AD. In 
patients with AD, cytokine mRNA in blood mononuclear cells has been shown to be 
differentially expressed compared to healthy subjects  (55).
Normal skin is colonised by a wide variety of microorganisms, including fungi, viruses, and 
bacteria. The skin microbiome is complex and diverse, and varies between individuals and 
anatomical sites ( 56). Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) colonisation has been proposed to 
play a key role in AD pathophysiology via bacterial production of specific virulence 
factors (57). Resolution of active disease in AD in response to therapy correlates with 
reduction of S.aureus  colonisation and increases in microbiome diversity ( 58). Skin swabs on 
TMF-000042639 - Version 8. 0Anonymized Page 97
Trial ID: LP0162-1334 Date: 06-Feb-2020 Version: 7.[ADDRESS_747046] of tralokinumab treatment on the skin 
microbiome . This method was also used i n the tralokinumab phase 2b trial in adult subjects 
with moderate -to-severe AD to demonstrate that the frequency of subjects testing positive for 
S.aureus  was lower following treatment with tralokinumab compared with placebo. Global 
analyses of microbiome diversity will also be incl uded in a phase 3 trial in adults  
(LP0162 -1325) , with results expected in 2019. The present trial will , if considered 
appropriate, also use gene sequencing to identify specifi c microbial strains present on the skin 
and further characterise the treatment ef fects on the skin microbiome in adolescent subjects 
with AD.
AD is a recurrent form of dermatitis where subjec ts have a high susceptibility to itching and 
irritants or allergens even on non -lesional skin, which is characterised clinically by [CONTACT_569691]. Previous studies 
have shown that the barrier -disrupted dry skin of AD patients mainly is attributable to 
significantly decreased levels of ceramides in the stratum corneum ( 59). Skin barrier function 
will be assessed (in a subgroup of subjects) us ing skin tape strippi[INVESTIGATOR_569658]. The skin 
tape strippi[INVESTIGATOR_8169] a minimally invasive me thod that has been used for assessment of b iomarkers 
reflecting the integrity of the skin barrier in AD patients ( 60, 61) as well as for obtain ing 
information about  the inflammatory processes in the skin of AD patients ( 62). TEWL is a 
method used for assessing t he impaired cutaneous permeabili ty barrier of the stratum corneum  
in AD skin (60, 63). Systemic treatment of AD has been shown to improve the barrier 
integrity by [CONTACT_569692] ( 64).
Data on antibodies against tralokinumab (ADAs) will be collected and the potential for 
immunogenicity will be evaluated until [ADDRESS_747047] dose of tralokinumab, to 
ensure adequate wash -out (approximately 5 times the half -life). The serum samples for 
determination of presence or absence ADA will be  analysed using a validated bioanalytical 
method.
Safety will be assessed using standard clinical methods of subject evalu ations, such as AE 
monitoring, ECG, vital sign and clinical laboratory measurements.

13.7 Follow -up for final outcome of adverse events
During the trial , the investigator should follow -up for final outcome on all AEs (including 
SAEs) . Once a subject leaves the clinical trial, the investigator should follow -up on the 
outcome of all non -serious AEs classified as of possible/probable relationship to the IMP for 
2weeks or until the final outcome is deter mined, whichever comes first. SAEs  must be 
followed up until a final outcome has been established, that is,  the follow -up may continue 
beyond the end of the clinical trial . For SAEs which have stabilised and from which the 
subject cannot be expected to recover during the trial or the safety follow -up periods, for 
example chronic or stabilised conditions, the fi nal outcome at the investigator's discretion 
should be reported as 'recovering/resolving' or ‘not recovered/not resolved ’. In addition, a 
statement that the SAE has stabilised or  is chronic should be added to the narrative 
description of the SAE on the SAE form.
13.8 Handling of an urgent safety measure
An urgent safety measure is a measure taken to implement an action/protocol deviation under 
an emergency. This is defined as “…the occ urrence of any new event relating to the conduct 
of the trial or the development of the invest igational medicinal product where that new event 
is likely to affect the safety of the subjects, the sponsor and the investigator shall take 
appropriate urgent sa fety measures to protect the subjects against any immediate 
hazard. ”(65).
If the investigator becomes aware of information that necessitates an imm ediate change in the 
clinical trial procedure or a temporary halt to the clinical trial in order to protect clinical trial 
subjects from any immediate hazard to their health and safety, the investigator can do so 
without prior approva l from LEO, regulatory  authorities , or IRBs/IECs .
The investigator must immediately inform LEO Pharma – by [CONTACT_73325] – of this change in the clinical trial procedure or of the temporary 
halt providing full details of the information and the decision -making  process leading to the 
implementation of the urgent safety measure.
LEO Pharma must act immediately upon receipt of th e urgent safety measure notification in 
accordance with internal procedures  and local legislation .

14 Statistical m ethods
14.1 Sample size
A total of 294 subjects will be randomised 1:1:1 to initial treatment (tralokinumab 300 mg, 
tralokinumab 150 mg , and placebo ) in this trial. The sample size is chosen to provide a 
sufficient power for demonstrating efficacy of tralokinumab versus placebo for the primary 
endpoints.
Under the assumption that the IGA 0/1 responder rates at Week 16 for the tralokinumab 
300mg dose and placebo are 30% and 10%, respecti vely, the power to detect a difference 
between tralokinumab 300 mg and placebo will be approximately 94% at a 2 -sided 5.0% 
significance level.
Further , assuming corresponding responder rates of 40% and 15% for EASI 75 at Week 16 
will imply a nominal power of approximately 98% to detect a difference between 
tralokinumab 300 mg and placebo for that endpoint.
The combined power for detecting a difference between tralokinumab 300 mg and placebo in 
both primary endpoints at a 5.0% significance level is then at least 92%.
For the tralokinumab 150 mg dose, the accumulated power for subsequently rejecting the 
2hypotheses of no difference  to placebo for the primary IGA 0/1 and EASI75 endpoints at a 
2.5% significance level bec omes approx imately  84% and 80%, when  using the same 
assumptions as for the tralokinumab [ADDRESS_747060] from the full analysis set, a justification addressing ICH E9 will be given.
A per protocol analysis set will be used as an efficacy subset for the analysis of the primary 
endpoints up to Week 16 (visit 11), and analyses based on the per protocol analysis set w ill be 
performed to support the results obtained for the full analysis set. The per protocol analysis 
set will be defined by [CONTACT_421480]:

Descriptive statistics of demographics and ot her baseline characteristics will be prese nted 
separately for all randomised subjects and for the maintenance analysis set. The presentations 
will be overall and by [CONTACT_1570]. Presentations of age, sex, ethnicity, race, baseline

Demographics include age, sex, race, and ethnicity . Other baseline characteristics include vital 
signs (including height, we ight, body mass index), duration of AD, concurrent diagnoses 
(from medical history and indications for c oncomitant medication), concomitant medication, 
and previous AD treatments.
14.3.3 Exposure and treatment compliance
Exposure
Exposure to treatment will be pre sented for the safety analysis set (initial treatment) , the 
maintenance safety analysis set (maintenance treatment) , and open -label safety analysis set 
(open -label treatment)  as days of exposure per treatment group.
For the full trial period, the days of exposure on tralokinumab irrespective of treatment group 
will be summarised for the safety analysis set.
Treatment compliance
Adherence to treatment regimen will be recorded in the eCRF. The log of drug administration  
may be used as source. If any complications  or deviations in administration are observed, 
these will be described as protocol deviations.
Adherence will be presented for the safety an alysis set (initial treatment) and for the 
maintenance safety analysis s et (maintenance treatment) for each treatment group.  Adherence 
will also be presented for the open -label safety analysis set (open -label treatment).
14.3.4 Multiple  testing strategy
The overall type I error rate for the primary analysis of the primary estimands f or the  primary 
and secondary endpoints will be protected by a combination of hierarchical testing and Holm -
Bonferroni multiplicity adjustment . Two different multiplicity adjustment procedures will be 
used, a US submission procedure and a global (non -US) procedure. For a  graphical 
presentation of the 2 procedures , see Panel 13 and Panel 14. 
In the global (non -US) procedure, w ithin each dose level, the 2co-primary endpoints, IGA 
0/1 and EASI75 at Week 16, will be tested hierarchically, followed by a Holm -Bonferroni 
adjustment of the testing of the 3 secondary endpoints.

14.3.5 Analysis of initial treatment
[IP_ADDRESS] Analy sis of primary efficacy endpoint s
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Overview
3 estimands addressing different aspects of the trial objectives will be defined:
xPrimary estimand: 'composite'.
xSecondary estimand: 'hypothetical'.
xTertiary estimand: 'treatment policy'.
The applied estimands incorporate 2 main types of events that influence how the treatment 
effects are estimated:
xInitiation of rescue treatment : Some of the estimands use rescue treatment  (from the 
Week 2 visit to the Week 16 visit [hereinafter “Week 2 to Week 16 ”]) as an event that 
modifies the applied value of an endpoint, e.g. by [CONTACT_331860] a subject receiving rescue 
treatment  as a non -responder.
xPermanent discontinuation of IMP : This event occurs when a subject is permanently 
withdrawn from the treatment or the trial as described in Section 10.2.1 . This can either 
happen at his/her own initiative or at the investigator's discretion. The event also i ncludes 
the possibility of a subject being lost to follow -up. The timing of the event is defined as 
the date of the early termination visit for withdrawn subjects or , in the case of a subject 
lost to follow -up, the date of the last known visit to the clini c. As for the rescue treatment , 
the event type is used to modify an applied endpoint value.
All analyses will be based on the full analysis set unless otherwise specified.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Primary estimand: ‘composite ’
The primary estimand for the primary endpoints will be :
xTreatment difference in response rates of IGA 0/1 and EASI75 after 16 weeks 
achieved without rescue treatment  from  Week 2 to Week 16 , regardless of 
treatment discontinuation.
The primary estimand assesses the expected difference in response rates at Week 16 (defined 
as response obtained without use of rescue treatment  from Week 2 to Week 16), resulting from 
initiation of a treatment regimen with tralokinumab 300 mg  or 150 mg  compared to a 
treatment regimen with placebo.

Trial ID: LP0162-1334 Date: 06-Feb-2020 Version: 7.[ADDRESS_747064] 
received rescue treatment  from Week 2 to Week 16 will be considered n on-responders, 
reflecting an assumption that use of rescue treatment  from Week 2 indicates failure of the 
randomised treatment to achieve response, and that a (possible) observed positive response 
after use of rescue treatment  is not attributable to the ra ndomised treatment. Missing data for 
subjects who did not attend the Week [ADDRESS_747065] stratified by [CONTACT_11338] ( Europe, North America, Australia , and Japan ) and baseline 
disease severity (IGA 3 or 4). The treatment estimate s and the corresponding 95% confidence 
intervals ( CIs) will be presented. The null hypothesis of no difference in response rates 
between either tralokinumab dose and placebo will be tested against the [ADDRESS_747066] to the retrieved data at Week 16 a nd assumptions regarding missing Week 16 data.
Sensitivity analysis 1 : All subjects who have permanently discontinued IMP prior to Week [ADDRESS_747067] discontinued treatment.

estimate of the missing response (than a non -response).
Supp lementary analysis  
The primary analysis of the primary estimand will be repeated based on the per protocol 
analysis set.
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Secondary estimand: ‘hypothetical ’
The secondary estimand for th e primary endpoints will be:
xTreatment difference in response rates of IGA 0/[ADDRESS_747070] imand  
Data collected after permanent discontinuation of IMP or after use of rescue treatment  from 
Week 2 to Week 16 will not be included  in the analysis.
IGA 0/1 responder imputation  
Imputation of missing binary IGA 0/[ADDRESS_747071] ( LOCF ) to obtain a monotone missing data pattern.
2.An ordinal logistic regression model assuming proportional odds will be fitted to the 
IGA value at Week 2. The model will include effects of region  (Europe, North 
America, Australia , and Japan ), and baseline disease severity (IGA 3 or 4) as factors. 
The estimated parameters, and their variances, will be used to impute missing IGA 
values at Week 2. 100 copi[INVESTIGATOR_215520] (seed= 11109934 ).
3.For each of the [ADDRESS_747072] as for Week 2. The imputations will be based on a proportional odds 
logistic regression model with effects of regi on and baseline disease severity together

Page 115 of 182
with the IGA value at Week 2 as factors. The estimated parameters, and their 
variances, will be used to impute missing values at Week 4.
4.This stepwise procedure will then be repeated sequentially for Week 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 
and 16 with the modification that only the IGA values from t he 2 preceding visits will 
be included as factors in addition to region and baseline disease severity. The missing 
binary IGA 0/1 response at Week 16 will be derived from the corresponding 
underlying imputed IGA value.
EASI75 responder imputation  
Imputation of missing binary EASI75 data at Week 16 will be done using multiple 
imputations of the underlying 72 -point EASI values within the 3 groups defined according to 
randomised treatment arm assuming that data are missing at random within each arm.
1.Intermittent missing values will be imputed in each group using a Markov Chain 
Monte Carlo method to obtain a monotone missing data pattern and 100 copi[INVESTIGATOR_569659] (seed= 29099734 ).
2.An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be fitted to the EASI value at 
Week 2. The model will include effects of base line EASI as a covariate, and region  
(Europe, North America, Australia , and Japan ) and baseline disease severity (IGA 3 or 
4) as factors. The estimated parameters, and their variances, will be used to impute 
missing EASI values at Week 2. 100 copi[INVESTIGATOR_215520] 
(seed= 11109934 ).
3.For each of the [ADDRESS_747073] as for Week 2. The imputations will be based on the same 
ANCOV A model with effects of baseline EASI  as a covariate, and region and baseline 
disease severity as factors together with the EASI value at Week 2 as covariate. The 
estimated parameters, and their variances, will be used to impute m issing values at 
Week 4.
4.This stepwise procedure will then be repeated sequentially for Week 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 
and 16 with the modification that only the EASI values from the preceding 2visits 
will be included as covariates in addition to baseline EASI as  a covariate, and region 
and baseline disease severity as factors. The missing binary EASI75 response at 
Week 16 will be derived from the corresponding underlying imputed EASI value.
Analysis of Week 16 response  
For each of the 100 complete data sets, the difference in response rates ( for both IGA 0/1 and 
EASI75) between either tralokinumab dose and placebo will be analysed using the Cochran -
Mantel -Haenszel test stratified by [CONTACT_11338] ( Europe, North America, Australia , and Japan ) and 
TMF-000042639 - Version 8. 0Anonymized Page 115
Trial ID: LP0162-1334 Date: 06-Feb-2020 Version: 7.0
Page 116 of 182
baseline disease severity  (IGA 3 or 4). The estimates and standard errors from the 
100analyses will for each comparison be pooled to one estimated treatment difference and 
associated standard error using Rubin ’s rule to draw inference. From these pooled estimates, 
the 95% CI for the treatment difference will be calculated.
Sensitivity analysis for the secondary estimand  
Rather than assuming that observations are missing at random within each treatment arm, it is 
assumed that missing data from subjects who discontinue IMP permanent ly or receive rescue 
treatment  in the tralokinumab arm s will resemble missing data from subjects in the placebo 
arm who do not discontinue IMP permanently  or receive rescue treatment . The underlying 
assumption is that the effect of tralokinumab following rescue treatment  or permanent 
treatment discontinuation is similar to th e effect of placebo. It should be not ed that this 
assumption is pronouncedly conservative in favou r of placebo as it tends to minimise the 
differences between treatment arms.
Imputation  of missing data at Week 16 will be done using a pattern mixture model where 
missing data in the tralokinumab arm s as well as the placebo arm will be imputed from 
observed data in the placebo arm (using a so -called copy -reference approach). With this 
exemp tion, the stepwise multiple imputation proce dure and subsequent analysis will be 
conducted in the same way as specified for the primary analysis of the secondary estimand.
[IP_ADDRESS].4 Tertiary estimand: ‘treatment policy ’
The tertiary estimand for the primary endpoint s will be:
xTreatment difference in response rate after [ADDRESS_747074] 
permanently discontinued IMP prior to Week 16. Within a given treatment arm, retrieved data 
from discontinued subjects will be used to impute missing data for other discontinued 
TMF-000042639 - Version 8. 0Anonymized Page 116
Trial ID: LP0162-1334 Date: 06-Feb-2020 Version: 7.[ADDRESS_747075] as specified for the primary analysis of the secondary estimand.
For discontinued subjects, it is expected that  the number of subjects with retrieved data at 
Week 16 will be too small to facilitate the same imputation model as mentioned above. 
Consequently, an imputation model with only regi on and baseline effects (IGA as a factor and 
EASI as a covariate [only for EASI75]) will be applied for discontinued subjects. Some 
factors may have to be omitted, depending on the observed data, e.g. if retrieved subjects only 
come from one region or if they  all have the same baseline disease severity.
The imputed datasets will be analysed in the same way as specified for the primary analysis of 
the secondary estimand.
Sensitivity analyses for the tert iary estimand  
Rather than imputing Week 16 data as described in the primary analysis of the tertiary 
estimand, missing observations will be imputed as non -responders. The assumption reflects 
that discontinued subjects without retrieved data at Week 16 are more likely to be non -
responders than resembling discontinued subjects with retrieved data at Week 16.
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_747076] of 16 weeks of treatment on (i) severity and 
extent of AD, (ii) itch, and (iii) HRQoL. The corresponding endpoints are (i) the change from 
baseline to Week 16 in SCORAD, (ii) reduction ( yes/no ) of Adolescent  Pruritus NRS average 
score for the past week (hereinafter ‘Adolescent  Pruritus NRS weekly average ’) of at least 4 
from baseline to Week 16, and (iii) change from baseline to Week [ADDRESS_747077] week prior to baseline will be used to calculate 
the baseline itch (see also in clusion criterion no. 10).
Reduction of Adolescent  Pruritus NRS weekly average of at least 4 is a binary endpoint, and 
it will be analysed as descri bed for the primary endpoint EASI75 using all 3 estimands with 
the modification of the ANCOV A imputation model that reduction of Adolesc ent Pruritus 
NRS weekly average replaces EASI where pr eceding values are used as covariates.

[IP_ADDRESS].2 Primary estimand for the continuous secondary endpoints: 
‘hypothetical ’
The primary estimand for the conti nuous secondary endpoints will be:
xTreatment difference in change from baseline to Week 16 in SCORAD and 
CDLQI, respectively, if all subjects adhered to the treatment regimen in the 
sense that they did not d iscontinue IMP permanently and no rescue treatment  
was used from Week 2 to Week 16 .
The primary estimand assesses the expected benefit when adhering to the tralokinumab 
treatment regimen with no rescue treatment  from Week 2 to Week 16  as compared to a 
placebo treatment regimen with no rescue treatment  in the same period .
Primary analysis of the primary esti mand (continuous secondary endpoints)  
Data collected after permanent discontinuation of IMP or after use of rescue treatment  from 
Week [ADDRESS_747078] -Roger 
approximation to estimate denominator degrees of freedom,  and the mean modelled as 
follows (shown for change from baseline in SCORAD):
Change from baseline in SCORAD
= treatment × visit + baseline SCORAD × visit + region + baseline IGA
This model assumes that data are missing at random within each treatment arm . The estimates 
will be presented with nominal p -values and 95% CI at each visit. The primary comparison 
between either of the tralokinumab doses and placebo will be at Week 16.
Sensitivity analysis for the primary estimand (continuous secondary endpoints)  
Rather than assuming that observations are missing at random within each treatment arm it is 
assumed that missing data from subjects who discontinue treatment /receive rescue treatment  
in the tralokinumab arm s will resemble data from subjects from the placebo arm who do not 
discontinue treatment /receive rescue treatment . Imputation of missing data at Week 16 will be

Trial ID: LP0162-1334 Date: 06-Feb-2020 Version: 7.[ADDRESS_747079] acebo arm will be imputed from the placebo arm (using a so -called copy -reference 
approach). The procedure for the change from baseline in SCORAD at Week 16 is described 
below. The same procedure will be applied for the CDLQI endpoint.
1.Intermittent missing values will be imputed in each group using a Markov Chain 
Monte Carlo method to obtain a monotone missing data pattern and 100 copi[INVESTIGATOR_569659] (seed= 29099734 ).
2.For each of the 100 copi[INVESTIGATOR_136691], an ANCOV A model will be fitte d to the 
SCORAD value at Week 2 in the placebo group. The model will include effects of 
baseline SCORAD as a covariate, and region (Europe, North America, Australia , and 
Japan ) and baseline disease severity (IGA 3 or 4) as factors. The estimated parameters , 
and their variances, will be used to impute missing values at Week 2 for the placebo 
group as well as the tralokinumab group s (seed= 11109934 ).
3.For each of the [ADDRESS_747080] error using Rubin ’s rule to draw inference. From these 
pooled estimates, the 95% CI for the treatment difference s will be calculated.

[IP_ADDRESS].3 Secondary estimand for the continuous secondary endpoints: 
‘treatmen t policy ’
The secondary estimand for the cont inuous secondary endpoints will be:
xTreatment difference in change from baseline to Week 16 in SCORAD and 
CDLQI, respectively, between tralokinumab and placebo regardless of rescue 
treatment  use and treatment di scontinuation.
The secondary estimand assesses the average diff erence in change from baseline in SCORAD 
and CDLQI after 16 weeks, resulting from initiation of a treatment regimen with 
tralokinumab and additional rescue treatment  as compared to a treatment regimen with 
placebo and additional rescue treatment .
Primary analyses for the secondary estimand (continuous secondary endpoints)  
Data retrieved at Week [ADDRESS_747081] above. 
Consequently, an imputation model with only regi on and baseline effects (IGA as a factor and 
baseline SCORAD/ CDLQI as a covariate) will be applied for discontinued subjects. Some 
factors may have to be omitted, depending on the observed data, e.g. if retrieved subjects only 
come from one region or if they all have the same baseline severity.

continuous secondary endpoints.
Sensitivity analyses for the secondary estimand (continuous secondary endpoints)  
Rather than assuming that observations are missing at ra ndom, it is assumed that missing data 
from subjects in the tralokinumab arm s who have/have not discontinued treatment prior to 
Week [ADDRESS_747083]/have not 
discontinued treatment prior to Week 16.
Imputati on of missing data at Week 16 will be done using a pattern mixture model where 
missing data in the tralokinumab arm s as well as the placebo arm will be imputed from the 
placebo arm (copy -reference approach). With this exemption, the multiple imputation 
procedure and analysis will be conducted in the same way as described for the primary 
analysis of the secondary estimand f or the continuous secondary endpoints.

open -label safety analysis set .
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse events
AEs will be coded during the course of the trial according to  Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). AEs will be presented by [CONTACT_121606] (SOC).
Only t reatment -emergent AEs will be summarised, but all AEs recorded during the course of 
the trial will be included in t he subject data listings. An event will be considered 
treatment -emergent if started after the first use of IMP or if started before the first use of IMP 
(applicable if subject had a wash -out) and worsened in severity thereafter. The tabulations 
described i n the following will only include the treatment -emergent events. In each of the 
tabulations, AEs will be defined by [CONTACT_569699].
An overall summary of the number of treatment -emergent AEs, number ( and percentage) of 
subjects w ith any treatment -emergent AEs, SAEs, deaths, premature discontinuations from the 
trial due to AEs, treatment -related AEs and severe AEs will be presented.
The number of AEs and the number of subjects experiencing each type of AE will be 
tabulated by [CONTACT_71930]. The percentage of subjects with AEs in the initial treatment 
period will be compared between treatment groups by a chi -square test or Fisher ’s exact  test 
(if expected cell count < 5).
The severity for each type of AE will be tabulated by [CONTACT_34689].
The causal relationship to IMP for each type of AE will be tabulated by [CONTACT_1570].
Related AEs are defined as AEs for which the investigator has not described the causal 
relationship to IMP as ‘not related ’. The number of related AEs and th e number of subjects 
experiencing each type of related AE will be tabulated. The percentage of subjects with 
related AEs in the initial treatment period will be compared between treatment groups by a 
chi-square test or Fisher ’s exact test (if expected cell  count < 5).
SAEs and AESIs will be evaluated separately . A narrative for each  SAE  will be given. AESIs 
and AEs leading to withdrawal from trial will be  tabulated and  listed .

The presence of ADAs (yes/no) is a secondary endpoint included to assess the safety and 
tolerability (immunogenicity) of tralokinumab.
ADA status (positive versus negative) at each vi sit will be summarised by [CONTACT_569700] , maintenance treatment , and open -label treatment . If considered relevant, 
descriptive statistics including number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, median, and 
range of the actual ADA titres by [CONTACT_3148] g roup and visit will be provided. The ADA status 
across the trial for each subject (positive vs. negative) will also be class ified and summarised 
by [CONTACT_1570].
The association of ADA status across the trial (pos itive vs. negative) with AEs/SAEs may be 
evaluated. In addition, the association of ADA titres (≥ median titre in positive subjects versus 
<median titre) with AE/S AEs may be evaluated for ADA -positive treated subjects only. The 
ADA -positive subjects across the trial may also be divided into persistent positive versus 
transient positive. A subject will be considered as persistent positive if he/she has positive

Appendix 1: Definitions of adverse events and serious adverse events
Adverse event definition
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject adminis tered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated 
with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product.  (ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, 
E6 (R1)).
This definition includes:
xAccidental injuries.
xEvents related to trial procedures.
xReasons for any unfavourable and unplanned change in  medication (drug 
and/or dose).
xClinically significant worsening  of pre -existing conditions.
xReasons for admission to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_548813] .
xAEs commonly observed and AEs anticipated based on the pharmacological 
effect of the IMP.
xAny laboratory abnormality asse ssed as clinically significant by [CONTACT_1275] (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
Serious a dverse event definition
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that :
xResults in death .
xIs life -threatening .
xRequires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15574]. 
Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_569663] d ocumented in the subject ’s medical 
record.

xResults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity .
xIs a congenital anomaly/birth defect .
or
xIs a medically important condition. Events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_548815]. Examples are intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm , blood dyscrasias and c onvulsions 
that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956] , development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.
Adverse events of special interest are described in Section 13.6.1 .

Appendix 2: Classification of adverse events
Severity
The severity  of the AE should  be described in term s of mild, moderate or severe according to 
the investigator ’s clinical judgement.
Mild An AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual 
activities of daily living.
Moderate An AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, 
causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject.
Severe An AE that interrupts u sual activities of daily living, or significantly affects 
clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.
If the severity of an AE worsens, a new AE should be recorded.
Causality
The causal relation  of the AE to the use of the IMP shou ld be described in terms of probable, 
possible , or not related according to the investigator ’s clinical judgement. The categories are 
defined below.
Probably 
relatedFollows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the IMP.
Could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26455].
Follows a known pattern of response to the IMP.
Disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose of the IMP.
Reappears or worsens upon re -challenge.
TMF-000042639 - Version 8. 0Anonymized Page 138
Trial ID: LP0162-1334 Date: 06-Feb-2020 Version: 7.[ADDRESS_747106] ’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26455].
Follows a known pattern of response to the IMP.
Not related Does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
IMP.
Is better explained by [CONTACT_73343] ’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_26455].
Does not reappear or worsen upon re -challenge.
Does not follow a known pattern of response to the IMP.
Outcome
The outcome  of the ev ent according to the investigator ’s clinical judgement should  be 
classified  using the categories below.
Recovered/
resolvedThe event has stopped. The stop date of the event must be recorded.
Recovering/
resolvingThe subject is clearly recovering from an event. The event is not yet 
completely resolved. 
Not 
recovered/not resolvedEvent is still ongoing. 
Recovered/ 
resolved  with 
sequelaeThe event has reached a state where no further changes are expected and the 
residual symptoms are assumed to persist. An example is hemiparesis after 
stroke.
The stop date of the event must be recorded. In case of a SAE, the sequelae 
should be specified.
Fatal The subject has died as a consequence of the event. Date of death is recorded 
as stop date for the AE.
Unknown Unknown to investigator, e.g. subject lost to follow -up.

Trial ID: LP0162-1334 Date: 06-Feb-2020 Version: 7.0
Page 140 of 182
Note that as per the above definition, LEO Pharma uses “RECOVERED/RESOLVED ” only if 
an event has actually stopped. According to the CDISC definition, the category 
“RECOVERED/RESOLVED ” also includes events which have improved. However, 
following the LEO  Pharma  definitions above, such an improved event will instead be 
classified as “NOT RECOVERED/NOT RESOLVED ” or “RECOVERING/RESOLVING ”.
Similarly, it should be noted that  as per the above definition, LEO Pharma uses 
“RECOVERED/RESOLVED WITH SEQUELAE ” only if an event has reached a state where 
the residual symptoms are assumed to persist. According to CDISC, an event is considered 
“WITH SEQUELAE ”, if it has “retained pathological conditions ”. Consequently, it is likely 
that some of the events classified by [CONTACT_73344] 
“RECOVERED/RESOLVED WITH SEQUELAE ” could have been classified with the 
outcome “RECOVERED/RESOLVED ” according to the CDISC definition.
For SAEs which have stabilised and cannot be expected to recover during trial or safety 
follow -up periods, for example chronic illnesses, the final outcome should be considered to be 
‘not recovered ’. In addition,  a statement that the SAE has stabilised or is chronic should be 
added to the narrative description of the SAE on  the SAE form. Please not e that the event 
should not be reported as ‘recovered ’ on the SAE form.

Trial monitoring  
During the course of the trial ,CRA(s) will visit the trial site. These visits have the following 
objectives: (i) to continually verify source data to confirm that data entered into the eCRF by 
[CONTACT_18029], complete, a nd verifiable from source documents; (ii) to 
confirm that the safety and rights of subjects are being protected; and (iii) to confirm that the 
trialis being conducted in accordance with th e currently approved protocol and any other trial
agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements.
The monitoring visit intervals will depend on the  trial site ’s recruitment rate and the 
compliance of the trial site with the protocol and ICH GCP.
In order to perform their role effectively, CRAs and persons involved in quality assurance and 
inspections will need direct access  to source data, e.g. medical records, laboratory reports, 
appointment books, etc. If the electronic medical record does not have a visible audit trail, the 
investigator must provide the CRA with signed and dated printouts. In addition, relevant site 
staff should be available for discussions at monit oring visits and between monitoring visits 
(e.g. by [CONTACT_756]).
Protocol compliance  
Protocol  deviations will be documented and notified to the investigator . Protocol deviations 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_569703].
Sponsor audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory agency inspections  
The clinical trial will be subject to audits conducted by [CONTACT_569704]/IECs. Audits and inspections may 
take place during or after the trial. The investigator and the site staff as well as LEO Pharma 
staff have an obligation to cooperate and assist in audits and inspections. This includes giving 
auditors and  inspectors direct access to all source doc uments and other documents at the trial 
site relevant to the clinical trial. This in cludes permission to examine, verify and reproduce 
any records and reports that are important to the evaluation of the trial.
If the trial site is contact[CONTACT_73350], LEO Pharma must be 
notified immediately.
Risk assessment  
In this trial, the risks to critical tria l processes and data have been evaluated.

assessments will be made by [CONTACT_421467] -rater 
variability.
To ensure subject safety, a n independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will regularly 
review unblinded safety data from this trial. Furthermore, SAE reporting will be followed 
closely and medical monitoring will be performed on an ongoing basis  throughout the trial .
Data quality review meetings will be held during the trial to ensure that improvements in data 
collection can be made  and that mistakes are prevented on an ongoing basis . During 
monitoring , the CRA will verify that investigators work according to the protocol.
Data handling  
Data will be collected by [CONTACT_548893] (e.g., laboratory data). The investigator or staff authorised by [CONTACT_552341]. Data recorded in the eCRFs will be accessible 
to the trial site and LEO Pharma personnel immediately after entry. The eCRFs must be 
maintained in an up -to-date state by [CONTACT_73353].
The investigator must verify the correctness of the data entere d by [CONTACT_547736]. This signature [CONTACT_548912]. Any correction(s) made by [CONTACT_547737]. Changes to data already 
approved will require the re -signature [CONTACT_3265] [CONTACT_093]. The person making the change to 
the data, and the date, time and reason for the change will be identified in the audit trail.
Subject data  should be entered into the eCRF no later than 5 working days after each visit , 
unless a different  deadline is stated in the Clinical Trial Agreement. Queries for discrepant 
data will be generated automatically by [CONTACT_483646], 
sponsor ’s medical expert,  or the data manager. All queries will be raised electronically within 
the electronic data capture  system. This systematic validation will ensure that a clean and 
consistent database is provided for the statistical analysis.
An ePRO solution will be used to  capture patient -reported data ( data from questionnaires 
completed at the trial site and eDiary data ). By [CONTACT_552342] , data will be 
available immediately after data entry and available for monitors and site per sonnel, including 
the investigator, with read access only.  The ePRO system is a separate application from the

eCRF and data captured from the eCRF and the ePRO will be stored on different servers 
during data capture. Data from both systems will be included  in the final trial data base.
External data transfers from vendors to LEO Pharma will be transmitt ed and handled via a 
secure file transfer protocol site.
Transmissions of electronic data from external da ta providers and of ePRO data to the clinical 
database are illustrated in Panel 15.
Panel 15: Transmission of electronic data
Abbreviations:  CTR, clinical trial report; ECG, electrocardiogram; eC RF, electronic case report form; ePRO,

Archiving of trial documentation  
The investigator at each trial site must make arrangements to  store the essential trial 
docu ments , including the investigator trial file (68). Essential trial documents mus t be stored 
until LEO Pharma informs the investigator that the documents are no longer to be retained , or 
longer if required by [CONTACT_427].
In addition, the investigator is responsible for the archiving of all relevant source documents 
so that the t rial data can be compared against source data after the completion of the trial ( for 
example  in case of an inspection from regulatory authorities).
The investigator is required to ensure the continued storage of the documents even if the 
investigator leaves the trial site or retires before the end of the required storage period.

Appendix 3 H: Committee structure  
Patient safety will be carefully assessed by [CONTACT_23275] 
(DMC). All members will be independent of the trial (that is, they will not be participating 
investigators or employees at participating sites) and of LEO Pharma (that is, they will not be 
LEO Pharma employees). The DMC members are experienced with clinical trials and will be 
responsible for assessing the safety of the subjects through assessment of the safety of the 
treatment regimen during the trial and through monitoring the overall conduct of the trial.
The DMC will review unblinded data on a regular basis. Additional meetings may also be 
called on at an ad hoc basis, as requested by [CONTACT_421509]. All data collected at the time 
of the data cut -off/scheduled meetings will be included in the summaries for the DMC, 
including data from subjects  still ongoing in the trial. The DMC will examine summaries and 
listings of AEs, specific laboratory parameters and subject disposition data as detailed in the 
DMC charter. Full details of the analyses to be presented to the DMC will be specified in a 
separate DMC statistical analysis plan.
The DMC will have an independent statistician and an independent administrator who will 
remain independent of the trial management team.
The chairman of the DMC, in conjunction with the other m embers, will communicate their 
recommendations to LEO  Pharma ’s clinical project  manager after each meeting. The 
chairman of the DMC will provide written reports to LEO Pharma after each formal review to 
indicate the committee ’s recommendation regarding saf ety concerns and trial continuation.

Appendix 3 I: Trial  and s ite closure  
Premature termination of trial or trial site 
LEO  Pharma , the investigator, the IRB/IECs or competent authorities may decide to stop the 
clinical trial, part of the trial or a trial site at any time, but agreement on procedures to be 
followed must be obtained.
If a clinical trial is suspended or prematurely ter minated, the investigator must inform the 
subjects promptly and ensure appropriate therapy and follow -up. As specified by [CONTACT_44536], the investigator or LEO Pharma must promptly inform IRB/IECs 
and provide a detailed written explan ation. Relevant competent authorities must be informed.
The trial must be terminated if the percepti on of the benefit/risk ratio (judged from clinical 
signs and symptoms, (S)AEs and/or remarkable safety laboratory changes) becomes 
unfavourable for the cont inuation of the trial.
Reasons for the early closure of a trial site by [CONTACT_548899]:
xFailure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the 
IRB/IEC or local health authorities, LEO  Pharma ’s procedures, or GCP 
guidelines.
xInadequate recruitment of subjects by [CONTACT_093].
Completion of trial  
Investigators will be informed when subject recruitment is to cease.  Screening activities will 
be stopped at a trial site when the total requested number of subjects for the clinical trial has 
been obtained, irrespective of the specific site ’s planned inclusion number.
Trial sites will be closed upon trial completion. LEO Pharma will undertake arrangements for 
the collection and disposal of  any unused trial material that the investigator is not required to 
keep in his/her files.  A trial site is considered closed when all required documents and trial 
supplies have been collected and a tria l site closure visit has been performed.
When the trial has been completed, the investigators will receive information about the 
treatment allocation for the subjects randomised at their respective sites and will be asked to 
record this in the subject ’s medical record.

Appendix 5: Guidance for anaphylaxis diagnosis (38)
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and Food Allergy and 
Anaphylaxis Network Guidance for Anaphylaxis Diagnosis (FAAN) define anaphylaxis as a 
serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death. They recognise 
3categories of anaphylaxis, with criteria designated to capture from 80% of cases 
(category 1) to >95% of all cases of anaphylaxis (for all 3 categories).
Clinical criteria for diagnosing  anaphylaxis
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following 3 criteria are fulfilled:
1)Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, 
mucosal tissue, or both (e.g., generali sed hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips -
tongue -uvula)
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:
xRespi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, 
reduced peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] [PEF], hypoxemia)
xReduced blood pressure (BP) or associated symptoms of end -organ 
dysfunction (e .g., hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence)
2)Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_17176] a likely  allergen for 
that patient (minutes to several hours):
xInvolvement of the skin -mucosal tissue (e.g., generali sed hives, itch -flush, 
swollen lips -tongue -uvula)
xRespi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, 
reduced PEF, hypoxemia)
xReduced BP or associated symptoms (e.g., hypotonia [collapse], syncope, 
incontinence)
xPersistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., crampy  abdominal pain, vomiting)
3)Reduced BP after exposure to known  allergen for that patient (minutes to several 
hours):
xInfants and children: low systolic BP (age specific) or greater than 30% 
decrease in systolic BP
xAdults: systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg o r greater than 30% decrease from 
that person ’s baseline

Appendix 10: Protocol amendment history
The protocol amendment summary of changes table  for the current amendment is located 
directly before the table of contents.
Amendment 1 (01 -May -2018)
This amendment is considered to be non -substantial  based on the criteria set f orth in Article 
10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European 
Union or subsequent regulation because it neither significantly impacts the safety or 
physical/mental integrity of subjects nor the scientific value of  the trial.
Overall rationale for the amendment
The reason for the amendment is a change in requirements in Japan regarding the 
qualifications of the investigators in the trial. Th is change was identified after finalisation of 
the original protocol. The ta ble below presents the change.
Section no. and 
nameDescription of change Brief rationale
Appendix 8
Country -specific 
requirements: 
JapanIn Japan, the investigator will be a 
dermatologist or allergist.
The text regarding the 
requirements for investigators 
(Section 11.1 in Appendix 8) has 
been updated accordingly.  As adolescents with AD in 
Japan are seen by 
[CONTACT_548905], 
the country -specific 
requirement for Japan, that the 
investigator must only be a 
dermatologist has been 
changed to include allergists.

Amendment 3  (21-Nov-2018 )
This amendment is considered to be non -substantial based on the criteria set forth in 
Article 10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the 
European Union ( 65) because it neither significantly impacts the safety or physical/mental 
integrity of subjects nor the scientific value of the trial.
Overall rati onale for the amendment
The main reasons for the amendment are to clarify  the sections of the protocol describing skin 
swabs, and transepi[INVESTIGATOR_569672], to update the requirements for IMP 
destruction at sites, and to introduce a country -specific requirement that will allow the order 
of trial procedures to be changed after the randomisation visit at sites in Japan to align with 
standard clinical procedures in Japan. It has been clarified that skin swabs and transepi[INVESTIGATOR_569673] s will be performed both on lesional and non -lesional skin. The LEO 
trial product handling guideline has been updated and no longer requires sites to be able to 
issue certificates of IMP destruction at sites, this requirement has been deleted from the 
protocol. The standard clinical procedure in Japan is to perform safety and laboratory 
assessments before meeting the principal investigator, a permission for such a change to the 
order of assessments after the baseline  visit has been added as a country -specif ic requirement 
for Japan. The assessments must be performed in the same order for all subjects at the site.
In addition, the amendment includes other changes, as presented in the table below.
The table below presents the changes in each section. Changes have either been summarised

on a representative lesion and on 
non-lesional skin to evaluate skin 
barri er function. TEWL (in g/m2/h) 
will be measured at the clinic by a 
non-invasive assessment of skin 
evaporation according to the schedule 
of trial procedures (Section 4), using a Tewameter
® or a similar device.
At each assessment, 3 measurements 
from a representative lesion and 3 
measurements from non -lesional 
skin will be recorded in the eCRF. It 
will also be recorded if the TEWL 
assessment was performed including 
the time of assessment; if not, a 
reason will be provided. Updated to describe that 
TEWL assessments will be 
performed on both on lesional

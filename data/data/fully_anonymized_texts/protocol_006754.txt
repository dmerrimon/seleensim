 SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Title:  An Open -Label, Single -Center, Randomized, [ADDRESS_240950] Crossover Study to 
Evaluate the Relative Bioavailability of Varenicline Administered as OC -01 
Nasal Spray as Compared to Varenicline Administered Orally as Chantix® 
Protocol Number:  OPP-[ADDRESS_240951]:  OC-01 (varenicline) Nasal Spray  
Study Objective s: Primary Objective:  To assess the relative bioavailability of varenicline 
administered intranasally at its highest intended clinical s trength 
compared to varenicline  administered orally at its highest oral tablet 
strength.  
Secondary Objective:  To assess the clinical and laboratory safety of 
varenicline administered as a single dose orally and intranasally.  
Overall Study Design  
Structur e: This is an open label, single dose, randomized, [ADDRESS_240952] dose.  
Subjects who are eligible for the study will return to the unit for 2 in -unit 
treatmen t periods, each separated by a minimum of 14 days.   
An End of Study visit will occur 7 -14 days after the final dose.   
The two study treatments are:  
• Single oral dose of 1 mg varenicline (Chantix®). 
• Intranasal dose of 0.12 mg OC -01 (varenicline) - delivered a s a 
50 µL (0.06 mg) spray into each nostril  
Treatment Period 1:  Subjects will be admitted and will be randomly 
assigned to receive a single dose of varenicline either orally or 
intranasally.  The administration dose will be delivered after an overnight 
fast by [CONTACT_423] . 
PK samples will be collected pre -dose and in an intensive sampling 
regimen up to [ADDRESS_240953] -dose to allow for the assay of varenicline.  
Treatment Period 2:  This period will be identical to Treatment Period 
1 except that the administra tion of varenicline will be via the intranasal

 route for those subjects that previously received varenicline via the oral 
route.  Those subjects that were previously administered  oral varenicline 
during Treatment Period 1 will receive varenicline via the in tranasal 
route.  
End of Study Visit  will occur 7 -14 days after the final period’s dose of 
varenicline when follow -up assessments will be performed.  
Duration:  10 study visits ove r a period of approximately 60 days:  
Screening: Day -28 to -2 
Period 1: Day 1 -3 (In -Unit  Subjects will be confined in the Clinical 
Research Unit (CRU) from the morning of Day -[ADDRESS_240954] -dose  (Day 3) ); Day 4 -6 (Out -Patient)  
Period 2: Day 1 5-17 (In-Unit  Subjects will be confined in the Clinical 
Research Unit (CRU) from the morning of Day [ADDRESS_240955] -dose  (Day 17) ); Day 1 8-20 (Out -Patient)

9. SAFETY DEFINITIONS, SAFETY MONITORING AN D 
REP ORTING  
9.1. Adverse  Event  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of 
a drug in humans, whet her or not the event is considered drug -related. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
occurring after the subject started dosing with the study drug, without any judgment abo ut 
causality. Any pre -existing medical condition that worsens after administration of the study drug 
will also be cons idered a new AE.  
Study drug includes the investigational drug under evaluation . Documentation regarding the AE 
should be made as to the n ature, date of onset, end date,  severity, expectedness relationship to 
study drug, action(s) taken, seriousness, and o utcome of any sign or symptom observed by [CONTACT_201978].  AE collection will start following 
the first administration of study drug until the last follow up visit of the study.    
9.1.1.  Severity  
Severity of a n AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an AE as 
determined by [CONTACT_72079]/her b y the patient/subject. The assessmen t of 
severity is made irrespective of relationship to study drug or seriousness of  the event and should 
be evaluated according to the following scale:  
• Mild:  Event is noticeable to the subject, but is easily tolerated and  does not interfere 
with the subject’s daily  activities.  

OPP-100 Protocol   Oyster Point Pharma, Inc.  
Amendment # 2 13 July 2019  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27 of 44 
 • Moderate : Event is bothersome, possibly requiring additional therapy, and may 
interfere with the subject’s daily  activities.  
• Severe : Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteratio n of therapy, and 
interferes with the subject’s daily  activities.  
9.1.2.  Relationship to Study  Drug  
The relationship of each AE to the investigational product should be determined by [CONTACT_201979]:  
• Definite:  When there are good reason s and/or sufficient documentation to demonstrate  
a direct causal relationship between investigatio nal product and AE  
• Probable: When there are good reasons and /or sufficient documentation to assume a 
causal relationship in the sense of plausible, conceivable , likely but  not necessarily 
highly  probable  
• Possible: When there is sufficient information to ac cept the possibility of a causal 
relationship in the sense of not impossible and not unlikely, although  the connection is 
uncertain or doubtful, for example; d ue to missing data or insufficient  evidence.  
• None:  When there is sufficient information to accept  a lack of a  causal relationship, in 
the sense of impossible and  improbable . 
• Unclassified:  When the causal relationship is not assessable for whatever reason d ue 
to insufficient evidence, conflicting data or poor  documentation.  
9.1.3.  Expectedness  
The expectednes s of an AE should be determined based upon existing safety information about 
the study drug using these explanations:  
• Unexpected: An AE that is not listed in t he Investigator’s Brochure (IB) or is not listed 
at the specificity or severity that has been  observed . 
• Expected: An AE that is listed in the IB at the specificity and severity that has  been 
observed.  
• Not Applicable: Any AE that is unrelated to the study  drug. 
AEs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the 
pharmacological properties of the drug but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the 
particular drug under investigation are to be considered une xpected . 
The investigator should initially classify the expectedness of an AE, but the final classification is 
subject to the Medical Monitor’s determination.

Amendment # 2 13 July 2019  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 28 of 44 
 9.2. Serious Adverse Events  
An AE is considered “serious” (SAE) if, in the view of either the investig ator or Sponsor, it results 
in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life -threatening  AE 
Note: An AE is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the investigator 
or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_201970]: The term “inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any inpatient admissio n (even if 
less than 24 hours). For chronic or long -term inpatients, inpatient admission includes 
transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care inpatient unit. Inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80676]: emergency room visits; outpatient/same - 
day/ambula tory procedures; observation/short stay units; rehabilitation facilities; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593]; nursing homes; or clinical research/phase 1 units.  
Note: The term “prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any extension of an 
inpatient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_201971].  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life  functions  
Note: An SAE specifically related to visual threat would be interpreted as any potential 
impairment or damage to the subject’s eyes (e.g., hemorrhage,  retinal detachment, 
central corneal ulcer or damage to the optic  nerve).  
• A congenital anomaly/birth  defect in an offspring of a study  subject.  
• Other medically important event  
Important medical events that may not result in death, are life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, the y 
may je opardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
SAEs are collected at the time the subject signs the Informed Consent Form until the last follow 
up visit of the stud y.  
OPP-100 Protocol   Oyster Point Pharma, Inc.  
Amendment # [ADDRESS_240970] be reported to the Sponsor  and/or its designee , and the IRB/IEC 
as required by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC, federal, state, or local regulations and governing health authorities 
and recorded on th e appropriate source documents . 
9.3.1.  Reporting a Suspected Unexpected Adverse  Reaction  
All AEs that are ‘suspected’ and ‘unexpe cted’ are to be reported to the Sponsor  and/or its designee  
and the IRB/IEC as required by [CONTACT_1201]/IEC, federal, state, or local regul ations and governing 
health authorities.  
9.3.2.  Reporting a Serious Adverse  Event  
To ensure subject safety, all SAEs, regardless of relationship to the study drug, must be 
immediately reported. All information relevant to the SAE must be recorded.  The investigato r is 
obligated to pursue and obtain information requested by [CONTACT_1052]/or its designee . All 
subjects experiencing a SAE must be followed up and the outcome reported.  
In the event of a SAE, the investigator must notify the Sponsor  and/or it’s designee  immediately; 
obtain and maintain in his/her files all pertinent medical records, information, and medical 
judgments from colleagues who assisted in the treatment and follow -up of the subject; provide the 
Sponsor  and/or its designee  with a complete case hi story, which includes a statement as to whether 
the event was or was not suspected to be related to the use of the study d rug; and inform the IRB 
of the SAE within their guidelines for reporting SAEs.  
Refer to the SAE form for additional reporting instruct ions.  
9.4. Type and Duration of the Follow -up of Subjects after Adverse  Events  
The investigator will follow unresolved A Es to resolution until the subject is lost to follow - up or 
until the AE is otherwise classified. Resolution means the subject has returned to baseline state of 
health or the Investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the AE. If the 
patient is lost to follow -up, the Investigator should make [ADDRESS_240971]’s 
source document.  
If the Investigator becomes aware of any new in formation regarding an existing SAE (i.e., 
resolution, change in condition, or new treatment), a new SAE/Unanticipated Report Form mus t 
be completed and faxed to the Sponsor and/or its designee  within 24 hours of the site’s awareness 
of the new information . The original SAE form is not to be altered. The report should describe 
whether the event has resolved or continues and how the event  was treated.

 APPENDIX  2. EXAMINATION PROCEDUR ES, TESTS, EQUIPMENT , 
AND TECHN IQUES  
The following examination procedures, tests, equipment and techniques are listed in this 
Appendix:  
A1. Intranasal Examination  
Qualified participants for the study must undergo  an intranasal exam to make the final eligibility 
determination  (e.g. s evere nasal airway obstruction such as, severe septal deviation or inferior 
turbinate hypertrophy , or vascularized polyp  seen on examination are reasons for exclusion).  To 
monitor nasal mucosal integrity during the study for participant safety, an examination  of the nasal 
cavities via an intranasal exam will be performed at the Screening Visit (after all other screening 
proced ures have been completed) , Periods 1 and 2 Check -in, and at the End of Study/Early 
Termination Visit.  This examination will be performed  by [CONTACT_201983] (ENT) 
specialist , otolaryngologist  or other suitably qualified medical practitioner (i.e. one who has been 
trained to perform intranasal exam) . The procedure used for the intranasal exam can be conducted 
either by [CONTACT_201984].  
A2. Laboratory Samples  
The Schedule  of Visits and Measurements (Appendix  1) defines the timepoints when each analyte 
should be collected. Table  2 below outlines the specific analytes to be tested:

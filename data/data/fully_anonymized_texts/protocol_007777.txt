Version 7.0    Version Date: 19 APR  2016 
Revision Summary: Addition of new measures to assessment battery as Common Data 
Elements of the STRONG STAR Research Consortium (these measures were recently added in 
all Consortium and Affiliate trials) including measures of tobacco (Fagerstrom Test for N icotine 
Dependence-FTNB; Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence –  Smokeless Tobacco (FTND -
ST), Quick Drinking Scale.  New measures were added to Sections 6.1, 6.2.2, and 6.2.4.  The

assessment with the PHQ -9 instead of the BDI-2 (this change was missed when we previously 
amended the protocol to replace the BDI-2 with the PHQ -9 to be consistent with other STRONG 
STAR and Affiliate studies). Broadened opi[INVESTIGATOR_425208] #6 to read “on their own or by 
a provider during the OSI period.” 
 
Version 8.0    Version Date: 18 JULY 2017 
Revision Summary: Gulf War era Veterans are now eligible to participate in addition to 
Operations Iraqi Freedom (OIF), Enduring Freedom (OEF), or New Dawn (OND) era Veterans. 
 
Version 9.0    Version Date: 26 November 2018 
Revision Summary:  Under Section 5, Study Interventions we added that individual sessions (depression, PTSD) may be conducted by [CONTACT_425389].  If sessions are conducted by [CONTACT_425390], the quality of care 
will be standard clinical care which is appropriate for this protocol; however, the duration of care 
may be variable so we will be tracking number of sessions attended. For those subjects 
receiving Individual sessions from another clinic provider, the 15 minute pain management session will be included with their biofeedback session.  Because we are not allowed to ask 
them to discontinue VA intervention and it is unethical to over -treat another mental health 
provider (per APA and [LOCATION_007] State Board rules), we cannot provide individual sessions to those 
participants.      
 
Revised the inclusion criteria to specify that participants need to have no opi[INVESTIGATOR_425209] (weeks 1 -3).  The original criterion of being 
discharged off of persistent opi[INVESTIGATOR_425210] (such that most

   participants were going to be discontinued on opi[INVESTIGATOR_425211] a homogenous 
sample).  It must be noted that up to 40% of pain sufferers who try to discontinue opi[INVESTIGATOR_281539] (after persistent use) will fail to discontinue.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_425212], because of its capacity to lead to decreased need for medications 
(including and especially opi[INVESTIGATOR_200596]) through improved non-pharmacological 
pain management training, is likely to be helpful for veterans who both successfully and 
unsuccessfully discontinue opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  Thus, this change was made to maximize benefit of the 
intervention in the VA population without sacrificing scientific rigor.  
 
Version 10.0   Version Date: 9 September 2019 
Revision Summary: Addition of a new measure to capture data from participants who were lost 
to contact [CONTACT_425391].  The Missing Data Assessment is a 4-item measure of 
global symptom improvement of pain, perception of satisfaction and burdensomeness of study 
treatments, and reason(s) for discontinuing study participation. This assessment will be used to 
assess missing data r andomness and to categorize participants who discontinued study 
participation as a way to help impute missing data and im prove future studies with these 
treatments in similar populations. In addition to the Missing Data Asses sment, participants who 
withdrew from the study will also be contact[CONTACT_425392], TLFB and Concomitant

FORT- A Protocol, Version 9.0  6 of 75 Revision Date: 20 December 2019 
   Summary and Justification for Amendment 6 Changes  
Amendment 6 of this document includes an unusual revision of a Study Aim (Aim 2).  In this 
case, Aim 2 of this protocol is being revised in response to external events that threaten the feasibility of the originally proposed research and the clinical utility of the Aim 2 findings.  
Because of the scope of change, this summary was developed to provide an explanation and context for why/ how this decision was made.  To save space, the reader is encouraged to review 
the changes made throughout the document as described in the Version 6.[ADDRESS_537532] of functional restoration rehabilitation (with a mindfulness content core) in addressing service -related chronic pain among 
post-9/[ADDRESS_537533] of functional restoration on opi[INVESTIGATOR_425213].  After this proposal was submitted to NCCIH for funding determination, the Department of Veterans Affairs began to implement an Opi[INVESTIGATOR_425214] (OSI; see Section 5.3.4 for a thorough description and updates) that resulted in a significant shift in opi[INVESTIGATOR_425215].  The South [LOCATION_007] Veterans Health Care System was identified as a “Top 10 Performer” in the OSI in August 2015, and a significant number of persistent opi[INVESTIGATOR_425216].   Changes under the OSI posed two challenges to this research and the VA system as follows:  
1) As this research program progresses, there will be fewer veterans meeting “persistent opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]” inclusion criteria over time; a threat to feasibility of recruitment and exemplary of how the population of interest (veterans with polymorbid pain) is likely  to 
change over the course of this study.  In order to meet the needs of the population, this research needs to adjust Aim 2 to better exemplify Veterans who are prior  opi[INVESTIGATOR_425217].  Because the VA has already implemented an  
administrative protocol to decrease opi[INVESTIGATOR_425218], maintaining a clinical aim of opi[INVESTIGATOR_425219].  The new question is: Can the VA keep veterans from returning to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]?  
2) The OSI requires the VA to develop an alternative intervention strategy for veterans in pain who discontinue opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007], with an emphasis on CAM.  In discussions with the STVHCS OSI (as recently as October 14, 2015), the PI [INVESTIGATOR_425220]’s needs if the pain program addresses return to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (e.g., opi[INVESTIGATOR_425221])  instead of opi[INVESTIGATOR_425213].  Making 
this change would doubly benefit the VA as a referral outlet for alternative pain management and a data- gathering mechanism to help them assess progress.  Win -win. 
 
This protocol has made several Aim [ADDRESS_537534] of this opportunity including: changing the Aim 2 endpoint to opi[INVESTIGATOR_425221] (i.e., using an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536] 3+ days in a 30 day period), adapting the MEMS caps to assess other pain medicat ion patterns that may shift 
after veterans stop opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], using the Medication Quantification Scale to capture the change in medication safety over time, and increased frequency of medication assessment to powerfully assess Aim [ADDRESS_537535] differential rates of recidivism between FORT -A and TAU.

All study participants will receive a recommendation for Physical Therapy (PT) at pre -
screening (before enrollment) to ensure that prior participation in “standard” PRC PT does not confound study results (and most PRC patients with pain receive a recommendation for PT as part of standard care).  This is necessary to ensure that there are not differences in enrolled participants based on their prior exposure (or opportunities for exposure) to PT before participating in the study.  Those who have previously c ompleted PT through the STVHCS or 
have declined participation will be enrolled and randomized for this research (if they

   otherwise qualify).  Participants in the PRC Treatment as Usual study arm will not receive

Study Title  
Establishing Efficacy of a Functional Restoration -Based CAM Pain Management 
Program in a Combat Injured Veterans Population   
Objectives  
AIM 1: Assess the efficacy of the FORT -A Program for improved pain management 
outcomes in (N=130) polymorbid OEF/OIF/OND Polytrauma Rehabilitation Center 
(PRC) Veterans with chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) using a 1:[ADDRESS_537537] PRC care.  We will determine the 
improvement in pain management outcomes attributable to a fully integrated and 
manualized interdisciplinary pain program (FORT -A) compared to standard PRC 
care.  
AIM 2: Assess the efficacy of FORT -A for decreasing the rate of opi[INVESTIGATOR_425221] 
(using any opi[INVESTIGATOR_425222] 3 or more days in a ny 30- day period) compared to standard 
PRC care in a sample of OEF/OIF/OND polymorbid CMP Veterans  discharged off of  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_425223] .  Unlike the original FORT 
trial, this research will formally and prospectively track opi[INVESTIGATOR_425224] -A versus PRC treatment. FORT -A is expected t o produce 
significant reductions in the rate of opi[INVESTIGATOR_425225] a pain management strategy.  FORT -A 
will avoid the stigma of “tradit ional” opi[INVESTIGATOR_425226] a pain 
management alternative to those who have been discharged from opi[INVESTIGATOR_425227].  
EXPLORATORY AIM 3: Based on the PI’s ongoing ESCAPE trial, this research 
team has identified psychological processes (helplessness, perceived 
burdensomeness) that likely play a mechanistic role in pain management among OEF/OIF/OND deployers.  We will assess these constructs twice a week and analyze latent changes in FORT -A and PRC Veterans to ascertain their role as pain 
management mediators  
Design and Outcomes   
This study is a 1:1 block randomized clinical trial comparing the FORT -A program to 
treatment as usual for polytrauma OEF/OIF/OND Veterans with prior persistent opi[INVESTIGATOR_425228].  All participants will be offered Physical Therapy services before enrollment and will be enrolled after completing or 
denying Physical Therapy (up to 12 sessions as recommended by a PRC Physical 
Medicine & Rehabilitation P hysician ([CONTACT_425451], [CONTACT_425452]).  If they have already 
completed PRC Physi cal Therapy before study enroll ment, they will not need to do so 
again.  Also, if the Veteran qualifies but refuses PRC Physical Therapy, he or she will 
still be eligible to enroll in this study and will not be asked to complete PRC PT.  
Veterans randomized to PRC (treatment as usual) will then meet with PRC and other 
VA medical providers per usual standards of care (described below).  Those 
14-396H, McGeary, Form BB, 11-20-19, AMD.docx  
FORT- A Protocol, Version 9.0  11 of 75 Revision Date: 20 December 2019 
   randomized to FORT -A will complete the standardized FORT -A Program (described 
in detail below).  All participants will complete a standardized battery of assessments 
at pre -treatment (Week 0), post- treatment (Week 4/5), 6-month follow- up (Week 
30/31) and 12- month follow -up (Week 56/57; see Figure 1, below). 
  
Interventions and Duration  
FORT -A: An amended version of the military Functional Orthopedic Rehabilitation 
Treatment (FORT) program.  For FORT -A, CBT components of FORT were 
diminished and replaced with mindfulness and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) components.  Individual FORT treatment sessions have been altered in FORT -
A to focus on PTSD symptom management using an abbreviated, manualized Prolonged Exposure treatment.  FORT-A includes: 
• 12 sessions (90 -minutes each) of manualized group pain management  
• 12 sessions (90 -minutes each) of group -based functional restoration Physical 
Therapy  
• 6 session s (75 minutes each) of individual psychotherapy for pain and PTSD 
• 6 sessions (30 minutes each) of biofeedback for pain management 
• Weekly interdisciplinary case staffings 
 
PRC: The STVHCS PRC is the only self -contained PRC in the VA’s nationwide 
Polytrauma System of Care.  The PRC is an interdisciplinary treatment center including: interdisciplinary assessment and treatment, case management, mental health support, physical m edicine and rehabilitation (PM&R), physical therapy, 
speech therapy, prosthetists/orthotists, and other integrated specialty services.  The PRC sees approximately [ADDRESS_537538] of whom (80%) present with a chronic service -related musculo skeletal pain condition and military trauma 
comorbidity (traumatic brain injury [TBI], PTSD, depression).  Though individual treatment plans may vary, most PRC Veterans will complete up to 12 sessions of Physical Therapy and be followed by a PM&R physician for pain and other sym ptom 
management.  Pain management with PM&R may include medications, injections, and other palliative medical interventions.  The PM&R physicians may also make recommendations about physical function, health behaviors, and mobility.  Sample Size and Population  
This research study will include 130 OEF/OIF/OND Veterans who meet the following criteria:  
• Present with an ongoing chronic musculoskeletal condition (pain that has been a problem for more than half the days over the past three months) documented in the CPRS record or confirmed by a PM&R physician upon referral to the PRC 
• Display at least moderate disability based on an Oswestry Disability Index score

1. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
1.1 Primary Objectives  
Hypothesis 1: FORT -A will result in significantly greater improvements in pain 
management among PRC Veterans compared to standard PRC care based on the primary outcome measure of self -report disability (Oswestry Disability Index) at both 
short - (pre- to post -treatment) and long- term (6/12 -month) follow -up. 
 
Hypothesis 2: FORT -A will also result in significant improvements on secondary 
pain management outcomes compared to PRC, including pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (intensity/ cognitions), emotional distress (depression, PTSD, anxiety), and objective disability (functional capacity, gait) at short - and long- term follow -up. 
Hypothesis 3: We hypothesize that FORT -A will result in significantly lower rates of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_425231] 12- months follow -up. 
 
Hypothesis 4: We also hypothesize that FORT -A will result in significantly less 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_425232] (MEMS), pi[INVESTIGATOR_10685], and consultation with prescribing providers / documentation in the VA Electronic 
Health Record (CPRS) . 
1.2 Secondary Objectives 
Based on the PI’s ongoing ESCAPE trial, this research team has identified 
psychological processes (helplessness, perceived burdensomeness) that likely play a 
mechanistic role in pain management among OEF/OIF/OND deployers.  We will assess these constructs twice a week and analyze latent changes in FORT -A and PRC 
Veterans to ascertain their role as pain management mediators.

   2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
2.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus  
Military operations in Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom, OIF) and Afghanistan (Operation 
Enduring Freedom, OEF; Operation New Dawn, OND) have now lasted for more than a decade, 
and even as the war effort begins to draw down it is quite likely that the Departm ent of Defense 
(DoD) and the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) will be confronted with the consequences of OEF/OIF/OND for years to come.  Military service members and Veterans who served in OEF/OIF/OND are at increased risk for debilitating chronic pain, with nearly 50% reporting postdeployment pain (Cohen et al., 2005) . Our research group has previously published on the 
significant impact that military chronic pain conditions have on disability in military personnel, active duty retention rates, costs associated with early discharge, healthcare utilization, and long -
term disability (McGeary et al., 2012; McGeary et al., 2013; USGAO, 2006) . These 
consequences are costly. The DoD pays an estimated $1.5 billion per year in benefits to disabled services mem bers, approximately 45% of which is accounted for by [CONTACT_425393] (Berkowitz et al., 1999; Fabrizio, 2002; Hauret et al., 2010; Belmont et al., 2010) . The 
mechanisms and circumstances of pain onset associated with combating the war on terrorism are unique (e.g., extended use of body armor, turbulent air and ground transport, improvised explosive devices, blast injury), and have made OEF/OIF/OND Veteran s increasingly likely to 
present with chronic pain conditions in the context of psych iatric trauma symptoms 
(posttraumatic stress disorder/traumatic brain injury; Gironda et al., 2009; McGeary et al., 2011).  This comorbidity is often referred to as “polymorbid pain,” which many believe is more complex and difficult to treat than non -traumatic pain (Lew et al., 2009; Clark, 2002) .  Polymorbid pain 
has presented significant challenges to the DoD and VHA healthcare systems, and there are significant gaps in chronic pain management that must be addressed to ensure best treatment for 
Veterans w ith polymorbid pain.  
     Advancements in military combat casualty care and medical transport have contributed to increased survivability from battlefield injury (cf Belmont et al., 2010). Injured soldiers who may previously have died from a traumatic injury are now surviving with chronic pain and psychiatric trauma symptoms. These symptoms often lead to early discharge from military service, so the significant costs associated with long -term pain management are being passed from DoD 
military treatment facilities to the VHA (wh ich is likely to serve these chronic pain Veterans for 
decades). Prevalence rates of chronic pain are as high as 50% in some military Veteran samples (Maloney & McIntosh, 2001) , and Veterans with combat trauma conditions (PTSD and/or TBI) 
are most likely to develop a chronic pain condition 10. Veterans with polymorbid chronic pain are at increased risk for depression  (Maloney & McIntosh, 2001) , sleep difficulties (Chapman et 
al., 2006) , PTSD (McGeary et al., 2011; Beckham et al., 1997; Otis et al., 2010) , anger 
(Lombardo et al., 2005; Trost et al., 2012) , substance abuse (Becker et al., 2009; Goebel et al., 
2011) , and suicide (Kanzler et al., 2012) . The DoD and VHA medical systems are working to 
address the complexity of polymorbid pain, but our research group has published a description of the significant challenges in treating this population (Lew et al., 2009) . There are numerous gaps 
in VHA health care continuity that contribute to inadequate care or even iatrogenic symptom worsening due to inconsistencies in diagnosis (Reisinger et al., 2012; Roth & Spencer, 2013) , 
with about 45% of polymorbid Veterans treated for post -deployment conditions being currently 
unemployed in part due to their polymorbid pain (Cohen et al., 2012) . Indeed, the Congressional 
14-396H, McGeary, Form BB, 11- 20-19, AMD.docx  
FORT -A Protocol, Version 9.0  14 of 75 Revision Date: 20 December 2019 
   Budget Office found that VHA treatment costs are 4 -6 times higher for polymorbid pain 
compared to any trauma condition alone (CBO, 2012) .  
     One -dimensional chronic pain management (i.e., medication, physical therapy alone) has 
failed to adequately meet the needs of this population, and more complex integrated treatment 
approaches are needed to improve outcomes (Gironda et al., 2009; McGeary et al., 2011) .  
Unfortunately, most Veterans with polymorbid pain are treated with basic medical management.  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_425233] (Dobscha et al., 2013) , and long- term o pi[INVESTIGATOR_425234], the potential for abuse and dependency, and the potential for worsening pain perceptions (Dobscha et al., 2013; Varney & Bebarta, 2013) . A medical 
record review of 762 OEF/OIF Veterans treated for chronic pain in VA ambulatory clinics revealed that 64% received at least one opi[INVESTIGATOR_425235] a 12 month period and 41% received long- term opi[INVESTIGATOR_75155] (Macey et al., 2011) . Our own research has shown that 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_425236] (VISN 17), and over 40% of Veterans prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_425237] 3 months (defined as “chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2495] d 
therapy”). The risks associated with chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_425238], especially for polymorbid Veterans who are most likely to use opi[INVESTIGATOR_425239] & Sullivan, 2013; Dobscha et al., 2013) . These Veterans have an increased likeliho od (32%) of receiving 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_425240], which promotes risk of overdose -related deaths (Morasco et al., 2010) , and they are likely to use opi[INVESTIGATOR_425241]-medical reasons, abuse opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], and experience increased disability due to poor pain 
management (Barry et al., 2011; Becker et al., 2008) . Surprisingly, few Veterans (25.7%) are 
ever screened for opi[INVESTIGATOR_425242] (Morasco et al., 2010) .   
Both the VHA and DoD have called for effective ways to address high rates of opi[INVESTIGATOR_425243]/OIF/OND Veterans with chronic pain. Although there are efficacious options for treating opi[INVESTIGATOR_425244], there is reason to believe tha t these options are less 
effective than intended because those who need them are not utilizing them.  Data from the 2005- [ADDRESS_537540] percentage of young 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- dependent patients with pain (83%) perceived no need for intervention targeting their 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], reported significant worry about their ability to manage chronic pain without opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], and were concerned about stigma associated with these interventions (Wu et al., 2011) .  Indeed, 
these same concerns (particularly stigma) have been identified in military and Veteran populations (Sirratt et al., 2012), and the rates of untreated substance abuse among military 
Veterans are now twice as high as rates of untreated serious psychological distress Golub et  al., 
2013) .  There is now a significant need for research testing non- pharmacological pain 
management programs that can curtail opi[INVESTIGATOR_425245].  Interdisciplinary pain programs offering alternative pain management strategies may offer a dual benef it of improved 
pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_425246].  In fact, our research group generated preliminary evidence showing a significant reduction in opi[INVESTIGATOR_425247] a non -combat injured military samp le. 
The Department of Veterans Affairs has recently implemented a broad initiative to address 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561], abuse, and misuse in Veterans.  This Opi[INVESTIGATOR_425214] (OSI; described in detail in Section 5.3.4) was designed to better manage the opi[INVESTIGATOR_425248], especially those who are “chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_45155] .”  Indeed, ample data exists describing  the significant risks 
14-396H, McGeary, Form BB, 11- 20-19, AMD.docx  
FORT -A Protocol, Version 9.0  15 of 75 Revision Date: 20 December 2019 
   of opi[INVESTIGATOR_425249] (Seal et al., 2012).   
The few publications describing the effectiveness of the OSI show a significant drop in the 
rate of opi[INVESTIGATOR_425250], especially for veterans on high doses of opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007] (Westanmo et al., 2015). A PCORI Topic Brief published in June 2015 provides a 
comprehensive review of the data on safety and efficacy of opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007], and the available data largely show that opi[INVESTIGATOR_425251] “weakly” effective in the long- term management 
of chronic p ain and there is very little data describing the best way to discontinue opi[INVESTIGATOR_281539] , and no good research describing the long- term consequences for pain management 
and opi[INVESTIGATOR_425252] (which mirrors Congressional Testimony by [CONTACT_425394]. Robert Petzel in [ADDRESS_537541], was  recently identified as a top ten performer for OSI outcomes, so 
STVHCS veterans are increasingly likely to become former opi[INVESTIGATOR_45155] .   
Although there is little VA data describing the outcome of opi[INVESTIGATOR_425253], there is some helpful data offering insight into what could occur.  A small -scale study of an Opi[INVESTIGATOR_425254] a recidivism rate of 
over 40% for veterans who discontinued opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (with higher rates for those not engaged in an intervention program for high risk opi[INVESTIGATOR_2458]; Becker et al., 2009). An older study of Vietnam veterans also found a 40% rate of  future opi[INVESTIGATOR_425255] “addicted” to opi[INVESTIGATOR_425256] (O’Brien et al., 1980). A rat -model study of opi[INVESTIGATOR_425257]- seeking behaviors (He & Grasing, 2004).  
2.2 Study Rationale 
Interdisciplinary pain management is now a high priority for the DoD and VHA. The United 
States Army assembled a Pain Management Task Force in 2009 with the mission of outlining gaps in chronic pain management resources throughout the DoD and VHA medical s ystems.  It 
completed site visits with pain management specialists at VHA and DoD facilities throughout the [LOCATION_002] (including with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_128825]) to identify potential best practices in military chronic pain management.  In its 2010 Final Report, the Task Force emphasized a need for pain management resources that go beyond medication and other one -dimensional 
interventions, specifically emphasizing the need for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) approaches. They noted tha t most DoD and VHA providers feel ill- prepared to manage 
chronic pain and are unaware of resources for pain management beyond medications and physical therapy.  Specifically, the report outlined the need for standardized interdisciplinary programs offering improved pain management with the benefit of decreased risk of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2554]. 
These interdisciplinary programs are likely to result in vast improvements in function, healthcare utilization, and quality of life for military Veterans with chronic polymorbid pain (McGeary et 
al., 2006; McGeary et al., 2010) , and would severely decrease adverse risk associated with long -
term opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]/abuse in this population saving the federal government billions of dollars in healthcare costs.  The study PI [INVESTIGATOR_425258] d a paper in the American Psychologist  (March 
2014) describing the significant benefit of integrated/interdisciplinary pain management programs over independent pain management interventions (Gatchel, McGeary, McGeary & Lippe, 2014).  In this paper, the authors note that psychological interventions for chronic pain are most useful as an embedded component of a larger, multi -component program including 
14-396H, McGeary, Form BB, 11- 20-19, AMD.docx  
FORT -A Protocol, Version 9.0  16 of 75 Revision Date: [ADDRESS_537542] improving physical functioning.  This is particularly important for 
military and Veteran populations for whom physical functioning is a vital part of their jobs and identities.  When developed well and integrated appropriately, psychological interventions can significantly enhance and improve outcomes from other pain management interventions (e.g., PT).  Previous studies of interdisciplinary pain programs (including the original FORT study) have consistently shown that these inte rdisciplinary programs outperform individual treatment 
like PT.  
     Some steps have already been taken to develop interdisciplinary care for polymorbid Veterans. In 2004, the U.S. Congress passed Public Law 108- 422, Section 302 and Public Law 
108-447, both of which require the development of integrated VHA specificall y addressing 
deployment -related polymorbidity (Cifu et al., 2009; Eapen et al., 2013) . One consequence of 
this legislation was the establishment of the VHA Polytrauma System of Care (PSC), which built and staffed 5 Polytrauma Rehabilitation Centers (PRCs) across the [LOCATION_002] to serve as referral hubs for OEF/OIF/OND Veterans with complex polymorbid conditions.  These PRCs currently offer the highest level of intervention available to polymorbid Veterans. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_95053], there are still significant gaps in the management of complex chronic polymorbid pain that severely challenge caregivers and Veterans alike. PRCs are equipped with multiple disciplines necessary to adequately address the complexity of polymorbid chronic pain, but these services a re not adequately integrated for polymorbid pain management [9]. This integration is 
difficult, and there are very few interdisciplinary pain management programs that have been proven effective in military -relevant pain populations. Our research team was one of the first to 
test a truly integrated model of pain management in a military population which we called the Functional Orthopedic Treatment program (FORT).  Recently, the Affordable Care Act has laid 
out plans and instructions for the proliferation an d promulgation of interdisciplinary pain 
management services (see Gatchel, McGeary, McGeary & Lippe, 2014).  
     The FORT program was originally tested in a non- polymorbid active duty military chronic 
pain sample. The original trial showed that our model of integrated care can effectively improve physical and psychosocial disability among military service member s with pain. It has yet to be 
tested in a polymorbid pain population, but we believe that the CAM -based composition of 
FORT makes it an excellent substrate for polymorbid pain management. We have expanded on the original FORT trial through several subseque nt trials specifically focusing on pain processes 
in polymorbid military members and Veterans. Data from these subsequent trials have allowed us to tailor the FORT intervention to the specific needs of a polymorbid OEF/OIF/OND Veteran chronic pain populati on.  We have labeled this amended version of the manualized program 
“FORT -A” (A = Amended), and believe that this new program offers the best available 
opportunity for polymorbid pain management. The proposed study will recruit 130 OEF/OIF/OND Veterans wit h polymorbid chronic musculoskeletal pain who are currently using 
chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_199628] (taking opi[INVESTIGATOR_425259] 20 out of 30 days a month for three or more months).  In 2015, the VA Opi[INVESTIGATOR_425214] (OSI) began to programmatically work toward improving the safety of opi[INVESTIGATOR_425260].  As noted above, very little is known about the potential outcomes of this initiative, but the scant available data suggest a rate of opi[INVESTIGATOR_425261] 30-40% among prior persistent opi[INVESTIGATOR_425262]. To align with this initiative, this study altered the opi[INVESTIGATOR_425263]. These Veterans will be randomly assigned to either the 3-week interdisciplinary FORT -A chronic pain management program (described below) or to 
14-396H, McGeary, Form BB, 11-20-19, AMD.docx

   treatment in the South [LOCATION_007] Veterans Health Care System’s (STVHCS) PRC in San Antonio, 
TX, which represents the best available care for Veterans with deployment -related polymorbid 
pain.  Primary endpoints for this research include pain management (represe nted in Aim 1) and 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (represented in Aim 2) at pre- treatment, post- treatment, 6 -month follow-up and 12-
month follow -up. 
3. STUDY DESIGN  
To address the primary and secondary hypotheses, this research study was designed as a 
randomized clinical trial comparing the manualized FORT -A treatment to treatment as usual for 
polytraumatic chronic musculoskeletal pain in the STVHCS Polytrauma Rehabilitation Center.  Eligible OEF/OIF/OND Veterans will be randomized to either arm in 1:[ADDRESS_537543] chosen to implement a variable boundary randomization for which the study staff randomizing patients will be blind to the boundaries and the resulting condition of the participant (see Sanghaei, 2011). The PI, Independent Evaluators, and Biostatistician will be blind to the condition of all participants until data lock.  A research assistant overseeing randomization will also be blinded by [CONTACT_425395] ( through the STRONG STAR Data Core ) by [CONTACT_425396] (e.g., first participant identified as #0001).  All assessments given by [CONTACT_425397].  Only the study coordinator (and co-coordinator) will be able to link unique identifiers to individual participants.   
This research study covers two objectives/aims encompassing four formal hypotheses and 
one exploratory objective.  The primary objective of this research is to assess the efficacy of the FORT -A program for improved pain management in a sample of 130 polymorbid 
OEF/OIF/OND PRC- eligible Veterans with chronic musculoskeletal pain  compared to standard 
care in the STVHCS Polytrauma Rehabilitation Center.  A second objective will assess the efficacy of FORT -A in decreasing the rate of opi[INVESTIGATOR_425264].  An exploratory objective will explore how certain variables (helplessness and perceived burdensomeness) contribute to change trajectory over time.

measures and other notable FORT outcomes.

FORT- A Protocol, Version 9.0  18 of 75 Revision Date: 20 December 2019 
   The primary outcome of this research 
(addressing AIM 1) is disability rating  
(consistent with functional restoration theory 
emphasizing functional ability over changes in pain intensity, frequency, duration, or 
quality).  This study was designed to assess disability objectively (functional capacity evaluation; FCE) and subjective ly (self- reported disability scale).  Data from the original FORT trial 
revealed that self -reported disability had a stronger relationship with psychosocial and 
socioeconomic pain management outcomes than objective functional capacity (see Table 1 for an 
example) .  Furthermore, self- reported disability is likely to be more sensitive to improvements in 
psychological pain management skills (which is central to this research).   For this research study, 
the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI, Version 2) will be used to measure self- reported disability.  
ODI was chosen for this purpose because the significant body of research supporting its use and its performance beyond other measures of self- reported disability in the FORT trial.   
The secondary outcome (addressing AIM2) for this research is rate of opi[INVESTIGATOR_425265].  In consultation with study co-I and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2561]/misuse expert, [CONTACT_425453], we decided to adopt a conservative definition of recidivism of use of any opi[INVESTIGATOR_425266] 30-day period.  This definition was chosen (instead of a non- abstinent definition as 
described in McCabe et al., 2013) because this medical population may include veterans given short- term opi[INVESTIGATOR_425267] a new injury or surgery and we did not want to count that as relapse 
or recidivism to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441].  As was the case for disability, opi[INVESTIGATOR_425268] (MEMS caps) and subjective (timeline followback interview; TLFB ) methods.  
Because some participants may shift patterns of other pain medication use as a result of discontinuing opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], we will also complete TLFB  for other pain medications and ask 
participants  to use MEMS for their “most helpful” pain medication (if they are not taking an 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_416207]).  All opi[INVESTIGATOR_425269] .  We will also 
assess pain medication using the Medication Quantification Scale – III (MQS).  The MQS was developed through the American Pain Society as a standardized method of quantifying pain medication use along dimensions of drug class, drug dose, and drug detriment (Harden et al., 2005).  Both TLFB  and MQS data will be gathered monthly (at all assessment intervals in 
person) and during monthly reminder phone calls.  Previous studi es have shown that Timeline 
Followback interviews demonstrate the best reliability and validity for long -term medication use 
(Kunoe et al., 2009), so TLFB  was chosen as the focal secondary outcome measure for this 
research.  
Based on our previous FORT trial, for which treatment effects in the FORT study arm were 
maintained at one -year follow -up, it is reasonable to assume that treatment benefits will be 
maintained after post -treatment and that all post- baseline measures can be averaged for a main 
effect of treatment.  To detect a medium effect with power = 0.80 (based on Cohen’s standardized mean difference d=0.50) at α = 0 .05, we would require n=50 in each study arm for a total sample size of N=100 for data analysis.  Based o n our prior FORT research trial and our 
ongoing VA trials through STRONG STAR, we anticipate less than 30% attrition with a target recruitment goal of n=65 in each arm to account for dropouts.  Thus the recruitment target for this research is 130 OEF/OIF/OND Veterans  with military service -related new onset or 
exacerbated chronic musculoskeletal pain and persistent opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441].  Both the FORT- A and PRC 
treatments will be provided on an outpatient basis through the STVHCS PRC (where the PI [INVESTIGATOR_425270] a VA WOC appointment ; see 5.1 and 5.2 in Pearson’s   r  FTW  WTE  ODI MVAS

   4. SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PARTICIPANTS  
Participants for this research will include (N=130) U.S. military Veterans treated through the 
South [LOCATION_007] Veterans Health Care System (STVHCS) for chronic musculoskeletal pain 
associated with deployment to OEF/OIF/OND (see Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria below). Eligible 
Veterans can have multiple pain concerns, but their primary pain concern must be musculoskeletal pain . All eligible Veterans must be a prior persistent opi[INVESTIGATOR_425272]. Participant s will be recruited 
through the STVHCS Polytrauma Clinic, the STVHCS Pain Management Service, and the STVHCS Primary Care Service. They will be eligible for care in the PRC. Our PRC partners estimate that they enroll approximately 30 new patients at the PR C per month, roughly 80% of 
whom would meet criteria for this research. We will recruit through direct provider referrals and advertisements posted in VHA clinic s; both of these strategies have been quite successful in both 
the original FORT trial and our ongoing STRONG STAR research efforts. Our PRC collaborators ([CONTACT_425452] and [CONTACT_425451]) will ask their staff to introduce the study to new PRC patients and will be available to answer questions. This research has been adopted as a STRONG STAR initiative,  and will have access to  STRONG STAR resources and procedures for 
recruitment. This will be of significant benefit because STRONG STAR studies routinely achieve their recruitment targets through local advertising, media exposure for the consortium, and sol id working alliances with VHA and DoD service providers. Based on our experience with 
numerous STRONG STAR trials and the original FORT trial, we expect <30% attrition and have factored this into our recruitment target. Participants will be reimbursed for time and travel.  
4.[ADDRESS_537546] meet all of the inclusion criteria below to participate in this 
study as follows : 
1) Demographics for inclusion in this research include both genders, all racial/ethnic 
groups, and ages 18- 72. 
 
2) Present with chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) as a primary pain complaint  
 
3) CMP is accompanied by [CONTACT_425398] a score of 20% or more on the Oswestry Disability Index;  
 
4) Consistent with NIH Task Force recommendations, "chronic" CMP has been a problem for the Veteran for at least half the days in the last 3 months and was acquired or exacerbated as part of active duty U.S. military service in the  Gulf War,  
Operations Iraqi Freedom (OIF), Enduring Freedom (OEF), or New Dawn (OND) 
war eras.   
 
5) CMP presents in the context of comorbid psychiatric symptoms of posttraumatic 
stress disorder (PTSD; based on a score of [ADDRESS_537547] -
Version 5) and/or depression (based on a score of 10 or more on the PHQ- 9).

   6) Demonstrate prior “chronic” opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] ( defined as using opi[INVESTIGATOR_425229] 20 
out of every 30 days over three or more months ) and  discharged off of persistent 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2536] s on their own or by a provider for at least one week prior to the 
pain management program period (Weeks 1- 3).   
 
7) Speak and read/understand English well enough to fully participate in the 
intervention and to reliably complete assessment measures.    
 8) The Veteran will be eligible to be a PRC patient (i.e., have multiple trauma related physic al and psychological injuries; VA, 2013) and be eligible for Physical Therapy 
referral through the PRC  (though the referral for the same service could also come 
from another VHA provider).  All participants will be offered Physical Therapy services before enrollment and will be enrolled after completing or denying Physical Therapy.  
4.2 Exclusion Criteria  
All candidates meeting any of the exclusion criteria below at baseline will be 
excluded from study participation:

FORT- A Protocol, Version 9.0  23 of 75 Revision Date: 20 December 2019 
   • Consistent with current STRONG STAR practices, we will maintain a n 
Enrollment Log describing the timeline of screening and consent as well as 
the disposition and reason for enrollment/disqualification (see Appendix A 3).   
• Consent for participation in this research will take place in the South [LOCATION_007] Veterans Health Care System (STVHCS) PRC  or on the STVHCS Bartter 
Research Unit (BRU) .  Potential participants who are referred by a provider or 
who self-refer in response to a flyer will call the study coordinator and arrange a time to meet and discuss the study.  Those who sign a Consent to Contact  
[CONTACT_425402] ( Appendix A1 ), will 
receive a phone call from the study Coordinator.  Participants will be asked to meet individually in a private room at the PRC /BRU with the Coordinator 
where they will be told about the study and will have an opportunity to ask 
any questions they may have of the Coordinator.  Potential participants will be given a copy of the study informed consent document (ICD, Appendix A2 ) 
and will be allowed to take it home with them if they wish to take time to read it.  Upon reading the document, the potential participants will have an opportunity to ask questions about the study and may meet with a study investigator to address their q uestions.  Consistent with STRONG STAR 
procedures, the Coordinator will have a checklist of questions about the ICD that they will ask the potential participants to ensure that they understand.  Once understanding is confirmed, the participants will sign the ICD and be enrolled into the study and recorded on the NCCIH Enrollment Form (Appendix A3 ).  A unique identifier will be assigned to the participant using a 
code developed in accordance with the STRONG STAR Unique Identifier SOP ( Appendix A4 ).       
• Participants will be randomly assigned into one of the two study arms (FORT -
A, Treatment as Usual) on a 1:[ADDRESS_537548], with increasing certainty, how a participant will be randomized as blocks fill.  This does pose a threat to blinding and creates an opportunity for non- random assignment 
(e.g., cherry pi[INVESTIGATOR_41875] a participant who may be a particularly good responder to be “randomized” into the experimental condition).  To maintain a blinded assignment schedule, we have chosen to work with the STRONG STAR Biostatistics and D ata Core to execute the randomization schedule, hold the 
blinded assignments, and administer them to the study Coordinator sequentially during enrollment (i.e., the Coordinator and study team will always remain blinded to the next assignment)  
5. STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
5.1 Interventions, Administration, and Duration  
FORT-A 
14-396H, McGeary, Form BB, 11-20-19, AMD.docx  
FORT- A Protocol, Version 9.0  24 of 75 Revision Date: [ADDRESS_537549] been explored in civilian pain populations 
(McGeary et al., 2006; Mayer et al., 2004; Proctor et al., 2004) , military and Veteran research 
has been limited. FORT- A is a particularly good fit for military and Veteran populations 
because the focus of treatment is on return to function, not on palliative pain relief. This 
works well for military and Veteran pain s ufferers who are used to “biting back” pain and 
pressing on with their mission. When we first developed the FORT program, we included a number of newly emerging complementary and alternative medicine interventions that were starting to show promise in pain research (mindfulness, biofeedback, relaxation strategies, motivational interviewing, acceptance and commitm ent therapy, guided exercise and activity 
– including mind-body exercises like yoga). Outcomes from our DoD-funded study of FORT revealed significant improvements in pain management (Gatchel et al., 2009) . CAM 
interventions have been strongly emphasized in the FORT -A manual (see Appendix) based 
on participant feedback from the original FORT trial and from research subsequent to the FORT study demonstrating very little beneficial effect of cognitive -behavioral therapy (CBT) 
for military pain management. We h ave kept some CBT elements to address cognitive 
variables that are implicated in psychosocial adjustment to chronic polytrauma pain based on the PI’s current DoD -funded trials (Kanzler et al., 2012). FORT was augmented to include a 
stronger emphasis on CAM interventions that are most likely to promote pain management and opi[INVESTIGATOR_425274]/OIF/OND Veterans, and the augmented program has been labeled “FORT -A.” FORT -A is provided on an outpatient basis and includes 12 
daily group pain management and physical therapy sessions spanning three weeks. Group interventions are supplemented by [CONTACT_425403], biofeedback, and case staffings. CBT sessions were decreased in favor of CAM components. FORT -A participants will 
receive 270 minutes (4½ hours) of intervention a day for 12 days over 3 weeks .  All FORT -A 
interventions will occur at the STVHCS PRC in dedicated research space. FORT -A includes: 
* 12- session outpatient group intervention. The FORT -A group occurs 4 times a week for 
3 weeks (12 total sessions) for 90 minutes each. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_84946]:  
- goal- setting  (2 sessions) 
- relaxation strategies (4 sessions)  
- mindfulness for pain management  (2 sessions)  
- CBT for pain management  (2 sessions)  
- communication and social support  (1 session) 
- motivational interviewing and managing stages of pain (1 session).  
Potential Adverse Effects ( risk): discussing pain management may make pain 
more  noticeable, resulting in perception of increased pain intensity ( NOT 
SERIOUS ) 
 
* 2 weekly sessions of outpatient individual psychotherapy for PTSD, depression and pain 
management (6 total sessions) for 75 minutes each (15 minutes to check on pain management topi[INVESTIGATOR_425275]; 60 minutes for Prolonged Exposure for PTSD symptoms based on the manualized approach used in our current STRONG STAR study). Individual sessions (depression, PTSD) may be conducted by [CONTACT_425404].  If sessions are conducted by [CONTACT_425405], the quality of care will be standard clinical care which is appropriate for this protocol; however, the duration of care may be variable so we will be tracking number of sessions attended.

FORT- A Protocol, Version 9.0  25 of 75 Revision Date: [ADDRESS_537550] participants reported accomplishing little in these sessions beyond what was already done in the group. In a polymorbid Veteran sample, it is vital that trauma symptoms (PTSD and depression) are addressed along with pain (Lew et al., 2009). PTSD will be addressed using a modified Prolonged Exposure (PE) protocol and depression will be addressed through Behavioral Activation.  
Potential Adverse Effects ( risk): PTSD interventions like PE may result in an 
increase in PTSD symptoms severity (as the Veteran overcomes avoidance of symptoms) during the first week of treatment ( NOT SERIOUS )   
 
* 12- session physical therapy (PT) . PT sessions occur 4 times a week for 3 weeks (12 total 
sessions) for 90 minutes each. As in the original FORT trial, PT will occur immediately before the group intervention. Each patient will be given an illustrated PT manual supplemented with a CD that provides information on pain and activity and includes an individualized workbook for setting, prioritizing, and completing activity related goals. Each 90 minute session will include a presentation/discussion on a key topic and group exercise targeting strength, flexibility, and aerobic speed interval training to address psychomotor slowing.  
Potential Adverse Effects ( risk): PT may result in muscle soreness ( NOT 
SERIOUS ) or musculoskeletal injury/worsening of injury (SERIOUS ) 
 
* 2 weekly sessions of biofeedback (6 total sessions) for [ADDRESS_537551] to relaxation training, hypnosis/meditation, and 
postural changes. 
 
  Potential Adverse Effects ( risk): None  
 * 1 weekly interdisciplinary case staffing (4 total staffings, one at pre- treatment and one at 
the end of each program week) for 60-[ADDRESS_537552] meet with the case manager/coordinator, and a Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation physician t o discuss each patient’s treatment plan, progress with treatment

Polytrauma Rehabilitation Center  (PRC)  
PRCs offer the highest level of care for polytrauma Veterans. They serve as a “hub” for 
clinical referrals, training, and  education in polytrauma care (Eapen et al., 2013) . Each PRC 
includes Physiatry, Rehabilitation Nursing, Physical Therapy, Psychology, Family Therapy, 
Occupational Therapy, and other specialties (VA, 2013) . Treatment goals for PRC Veterans 
are decidedly functional, emphasizing return to work, community integration, improved psychosocial functioning, and enhanced copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110] (Eapen et al., 2013; Braverman et al., 1999; McNamee et al., 2009). Chronic pain management is a high priority for the PRC, and pain represents the most commonly reported clinical  concern among PRC Veterans (Sayer et 
al., 2009) . The logistic organization of the PRCs offers an excellent opportunity for clinical 
service and stakeholder integration (Strasser et al., 2008). The proposed research is vital for 
pain management in the PRC. Although PRCs succeed in locating multiple treatment resources in the same clinic, they have yet to produce consistent evidence of truly successful, integra ted chronic pain management (Strasser et al., 2008). Our research group has 
hypothesized that PRC pain management primarily suffers due to a lack of guidance on how to most effectively integrate polymorbid pain treatment resources. Indeed, PRC clinicians have openly indicated the need for more guidance on service integration in PRCs to help them more effectively manage the complexity of deployment- related polymorbidities (Clark 
et al., 2009; Friedemann-Sanchez et al., 2008). An intensive program like FORT- A offers 
surprisingly little treatment burden to PRC staff and patients compared to the current standard of care. Veterans treated in the PRC are often required to attend multiple 
appointments throughout the week, requiring substantial time away from work. Current protocol for chronic pain management through the San Antonio PRC (our partner for this research) is for each PRC Veteran to complete 12 sessions of Physical Therapy over 3 to 4 weeks, with supplemental appointments for medication, pain injections (e.g., epi[INVESTIGATOR_158419]), and a ssessment as prescribed by [CONTACT_92524]’s treatment team. Evaluation clinics 
at the PRC typi[INVESTIGATOR_425276] [ADDRESS_537553] physical therapy for chronic pain management (Garcia et al., 2013; Brooks et al., 2012; Groessl et al., 2012). For this research, Veterans randomized to the PRC will receive 3 weeks of PRC services as recommended by [CONTACT_425406] (which could include PT, occupational therapy, counsel ing, or medical management; Eapen 
et al., 2013 ). 
 
 All study participants will be offered PRC Physical Therapy before randomization.  PRC 
physical therapy (PT) varies in frequency and duration based on pain presentation, but can occur daily for up to three weeks.  PT sessions are individualized, so length of the session will vary from patient to patient.   
 
Potential Adverse Effects ( risk): PT may result in muscle soreness ( NOT 
SERIOUS ) or musculoskeletal injury/worsening of injury (SERIOUS )

   Not all PRC patients are recommended for, or taken advantage of, the full slate of PRC

   5.1.1  Physical Therapy in the PRC Treatment as Usual  
All study  participants will receive a recommendation for Physical Therapy (PT) at 
pre-s creening (before  enrollment ) to ensure that prior participation in “standard” PRC 
PT does not confound study results (and most PRC patients with pain receive a 
recommendation for PT as part of standard care).  This is necessary to ensure that there are not differences in enrolled participants based on their prior exposure (or opportunities for exposure) to PT before participating in the study.  Those who have previously completed PT through the STVHCS or have declined participation will be enrolled and randomized for this research (if they otherwise qualify).  Participants in 
the PRC Treatment as Usual study arm will not receive another recommendation for 
PT through the PRC because a second recommendation is not standard care in the PRC.  They are not prohibited from attending PT again, but a second recommendation for PT in the Treatment as Usual arm will not be provided a s part of 
this research.  
5.2  Handling of Study Interventions  
The active intervention for this study is based on an integrated, interdisciplinary 
approach involving group psychotherapy, individual psychotherapy, physical therapy, biofeedback, and weekly interdisciplinary team meetings.  Each phase of the active intervention is described below including methods for ensuring intervention accountability and masking.  A formal manual is available to guide the group intervention (see Appendix B ) and the Individual Psychotherapy (which uses a 6-
session manualized interventi on for PTSD based on Edna Foa’s Prolonged Exposure 
protocol with some elements of behavioral activation to address depressive symptoms).  A Manual of Procedures (MOP) is  being developed to guide 
biofeedback, Physical Therapy, and Interdisciplinary Staff Meetings ( to be  Appendix 
C).  Only basic details are provided for use of intervention in this section.  More 
details for interventions, interventionist training, and assessment of adherence to treatment are found elsewhere in this manual as follows:  
* Section 5.1 of this protocol provides more detailed information about the content and structure of the intervention components. 
* Section 5.4 of this protocol provides more detailed information about adherence 
assessments and certification of study interventionists)  
Group Psychotherapy (see Group Manual, Appendix B)  
As described in section 5.[ADDRESS_537554] (a STRONG STAR Intern or Fellow) must adhere.  All STRONG STAR Interns and Postdoctoral Fellows are credentialed as Without Compensation (W OC) providers in the STVHCS and are supervised by a 
licensed Psychologist ([CONTACT_425454] McGeary, [CONTACT_425455]) and administratively overseen by a licensed VA Psychologist (e.g., [CONTACT_425456]- Galan, though this 
may change with [CONTACT_425457]-Galan’s promotion to Psychology Chair).  All group

   sessions are audiotaped and 10 -15% of all audiotaped group sessions will be selected 
for review by a trained independent evaluator who will use a structured checklist to 
ensure that all significant treatment elements are included in the intervention.  Interns and Fellows will be formally trained in the manualized group intervention by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Don McGeary (who developed the intervention and created the manual) and will co -
facilitate a group intervention with Dr. D or C. McGeary at the PRC to practice the interve ntion in vivo.  All groups will be documented in CPRS using a standard note 
template.  The PI (and other blinded study personnel) will not review any of this documentation.  CPRS notes for group and individual treatment components will be overseen and cosi gned by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. C. McGeary and [CONTACT_425455].  
Blinding: To maintain blinding, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_425279].  Independent Evaluators (IEs) assessing group intervention facilitator adherence will be different people than the IEs responsible for assessments (because the assessing IEs may recognize voices on the tapes from their assessment experiences and may become unblinded as a result).  
Providers and Qualifications:  FORT- A Group Intervention will be delivered by 
[CONTACT_425407]  (a total of 4 
possible providers who will rotate through different groups) .  The structure of the 
manual and skills contained therein were developed for use by [CONTACT_425408] (and most other AP A-
Accredited Psychology Internships). Group intervention providers will be trained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Don McGeary and will observe one iteration of the FORT -A Group with [CONTACT_255349] 
McGeary, [CONTACT_425454] McGeary, or [CONTACT_425455] (all of whom have been 
trained on the components of the manual and who had a hand in developi[INVESTIGATOR_425280]).  To run the group without Dr. C. McGeary or [CONTACT_425458] 
present, the Intern or Fellow must be certified using the procedures outlined in Section 5.[ADDRESS_537555]. Alan Peterson through the STRONG STAR PTSD Research Consortium revealed that a brief, Prolonged Exposure (PE) protocol can have a meaningful effect on PTSD symptoms, though PE in isolation did not appear to impact chronic pain symptoms.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_425281], so PTSD (and concomitant depression) must be addressed as part of this interdisciplinary interven tion to ensure that PTSD does not act as a barrier to pain 
management intervention. Because of its success in the previous STRONG STAR trial, this study will use the brief PE manualized intervention used in the previous trial (5 sessions) with an additiona l session of behavioral activation (serving as the first 
session) to address depression symptoms.  All STRONG STAR Interns and Fellows receive world class training in PE and their supervision will be overseen by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Cindy McGeary, master trained in PE by D r. Alan Peterson and [CONTACT_425459], and [CONTACT_425460] (also trained in PE through STRONG STAR).  All individual sessions will be documented in CPRS.

FORT -A Protocol, Version 9.0  30 of 75 Revision Date: 20 December 2019 
   Blinding: Neither [CONTACT_425458] nor Dr. C. McGeary are involved in assessment of 
participants and will be asked not to discuss specific (i.e., identifiable) details of the interventions with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_425282] (see 
Figure 2).    
Providers and Qualifications: Individual treatment providers must he certified in Prolonged Exposure for PTSD (PE)  or supervised by a certified PE provider.  
Because of this, only STRONG STAR Interns and Postdoctoral Fellows or licensed Psychologists (Dr. C. McGeary, [CONTACT_425458]) can provide individual intervention for this research  (a total of 5 different providers).  Individual providers must have 
completed a two- day training in PE (mandat ory for STRONG STAR Faculty, Fellows  
and Interns ) and must be certif ied in PE as described in Section 5.4 of this document. 
PE is commonly practiced and taught throughout the VA system, drastically improving the generalizability of this component of the treatment manual. 
Biofeedback (Manual Under Development)  
Biofeedback is an adjunct to behavioral intervention that can have significant benefit 
for a number of behavioral and physical health concerns including chronic pain management.  [CONTACT_255349] McGeary ran the biofeedback lab for Wilford Hall Medical Center (Lack land Air Force Base) for over 5 years and has certified close to 100 
military Psychologists in biofeedback (BFB) use.  He will train all STRONG STAR Fellow interventionists for this study and will supervise biofeedback methodology (i.e., address questions about instrumentation, interpretation, and clinical application 
of BFB data (which must be deidentified before being shown to the PI).  Because BFB will be used differently with each participant, there is no way to manualize this part of the intervention.  There will be a section of the MOP (under development at 
the time of this protocol draft) that will cover biofeedback instrumentation procedures and clinical documentation of encounters.  
Blinding: Identifiable clinical issues will need to be discussed with [CONTACT_425458] and Dr. C. McGeary and will not be shared with the PI. 
Providers and Qualifications: Biofeedback providers must have minimal competency 
in basic principles of health behavior change and mindfulness.  Both STRONG STAR Interns and Postdoctoral Fellows may provide biofeedback intervention (for a total of 4 different providers) and will be certified in biofeedback by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Don McGeary as outlined in Section 5.4 of this document).  
Physical Therapy ( Manual Under Development ) 
Group- based physical therapy will be provided by [CONTACT_425409][INVESTIGATOR_541] /Occupational Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_425283] /Occupational Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_425284]. Maureen Simmonds.  [CONTACT_425461] is 
already WOC -appointed in the STVHCS (as are Dr. C. McGeary, [CONTACT_425458], and the 
PI) and will enter notes for all encounters in CPRS.  UTHSCSA PT Students will also establish WOC appointments in the STVHCS and will mee t with [CONTACT_425461] 
regularly for supervision.  Group PT will include a didactic session, guided exercise, and flowsheets for home -based exercise.  Group PT will occur four days a week for 
three consecutive weeks.  We found during the original FORT trial that patients

FORT -A Protocol, Version 9.0  31 of 75 Revision Date: [ADDRESS_537556] to group PT on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday with a break 
on Wednesday to allow for recovery.  The PRC PT Service has already agreed to allow the study to use their space and equipment for study- related PT .  PT providers 
will be encouraged to participate in FORT -A group psychotherapy sessions and 
STRONG STAR Interns/Fellows will be encouraged to sit in on group PT sessions (to maintain continuity in this interdisciplinary program).  
Blinding: [CONTACT_425461]  or a PRC PT/OT will monitor adherence to recommended 
PT practice and will not share details of the PT with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_425285].  
Providers and Qualifications: PT will be provided by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Maureen Simmonds , her 
Physical Therapy students with WOC appointments at the VA , or existing PRC PT/OT 
providers.  The number of students PT interventionists over time will vary and is 
indeterminate but will be greater than 2.  Skills required for the PT portion of the treatment will include skills for rehabilitation of chronic pain, strength and conditioning, and improved range of motion for the back and extr emities.  
Interdisciplinary Staff Meetings ( Manual Under Development ) 
The entire study team (with the exception of IEs) will meet weekly to discuss progress of FORT -A participants and PRC participants.  Participants will be 
discussed without identifiers (even using the unique identifier would unblind the PI [INVESTIGATOR_425286].  These meetings will be run by [CONTACT_274788]/or co -coordinator who will be aware of patient identity in case an 
adverse event is noted and needs to be addressed.  Issues discussed in these weekly meetings include adherenc e to protocol, treatment goals, problems with treatment, 
and changes in medication or medical status. These meetings will occur from 1200 -
1300 in the PRC with the VA PI’s ([CONTACT_425452], [CONTACT_425451]) in attendance. 
Blinding: Cases will only be discussed in a deidentified fashion to avoid unblinding 
the PI (who must be present at these meetings to assess progress of the study, troubleshoot procedural difficulties, and offer expert clinical guidance on implementing the  program.  To accomplish this, the team will develop a set of 
identifiers for participants specific to these staff meetings that are discreet from their research unique identification number.  The study coordinator /co-coordinator  will 
maintain a link for t hese identifiers to ensure continuity (NOTE: THIS MAY BE TOO 
CONVOLUTED TO IMPLEMENT, SO WE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER SOME OTHER WAY – PERHAPS USING PARTICIPANT INITIALS, WHICH WOULD BE MEANINGLESS TO THE PI).  
5.3 Concomitant Interventions  
5.3.1 Allowed Interventions 
All treatments or interventions prescribed or recommended by [CONTACT_425410] (VHA) or Department of Defense (DoD) medical provider for a study participant is allowed.  The DoD and VHA do not allow prohibition of any recommended or prescribed intervention for research purposes.  
14-396H, McGeary, Form BB, 11- 20-19, AMD.docx  
FORT -A Protocol, Version 9.0  32 of 75 Revision Date: [ADDRESS_537557] be given an opportunity to participate in a prescribed course of 
as-usual Physical Therapy (PT) through the PRC (as recommended by [CONTACT_425411]) before enrollment in this research.  If they have already participated in Physical Therapy, choose not to participa te in PT, or have already participated in PT 
then they may proceed with enrollment and randomization. 
5.3.3 Prohibited Interventions 
Research in Department of Defense and Veterans Administration covered populations may not deny or prohibit any interventions to study participants.  DoD and VA IRB’s will not approve research prohibiting any access to interventions for any condition, so there are no prohibited interventions for this research.   Participants who receive some 
interventions during or after enrollment in this study may need to be excluded from per protocol  evaluation but not from intent -to-treat as follows:  
  Enrollment in another intensive interdisciplinary pain program 
  Enrollment in an intensive program for substance abuse (especially those treating opi[INVESTIGATOR_425287] ) 
o If a participant was involved in one of these programs before study 
enrollment and still meets inclusion criteria, then they need not  be 
excluded from per -protocol evaluation 
 
5.3.4   Enrollment in STVHCS Opi[INVESTIGATOR_425288] 2013, the VA launched the Opi[INVESTIGATOR_425214] (OSI), designed to address high dose opi[INVESTIGATOR_425289].  Each VISN (i.e., regional VA catchment area) is implementing the OSI differently, but the ultimate goal (as outlined in Appendix D) is to reduce dependence on opi[INVESTIGATOR_425290]’s 
highest utilizers.  In VISN 17 (the catchment including the STVHCS), the OSI is being implemented through the Department of Pharmacy in a joint effort with the Department of Psychiatry and Primar y Care.  VISN 17 OSI efforts include 
surveillance of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (by [CONTACT_425412]; MED), categorization of STVHCS patients based on MED and misuse risk factors (e.g., diagnosis with PTSD, diagnosis with TB I, diagnosis with Depression, diagnosis with formal substance use 
disorder).  Starting in September 2014, STVHCS medical providers will be limited in prescribing opi[INVESTIGATOR_425291] (e.g., providers may only prescribe opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007] 30- days at a 
time and are not al lowed to automate renewal of prescription).  Study participants 
who are enrolled in OSI through VISN 17 may evidence a change in opi[INVESTIGATOR_425292] (i.e., if opi[INVESTIGATOR_425293], it will be difficult to discern if changes in use are attributable to study intervention or mechanisms of the OSI).  In September and October 2014, the study PI (Don McGeary) met with the VISN 1 7 OSI committee to discuss how this research 
can function in the VISN without interfering with  the OSI.  The OSI committee was 
welcoming of this study (VISN is required to have a CAM intervention program on

   site and the OSI committee asked to count this research as their CAM effort), and 
agreed to flag study participants and delay their OSI enrollment until study participation is complete.  Additionally, the OSI agreed to begin their enrollment with high risk opi[INVESTIGATOR_45155] (> 400 MED, with multiple risk factors), representing a sub-cohort (approximately n=175) of the 1,300+ Veterans in the STVHCS who will likely qualify to participate in this study.  Additionally, the OSI offered to allow Dr. McGeary to continue to join the OSI committee for regular meetings (they meet twice per month) and expressed an interest in working with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_425294] (at the time of this protocol amendment – 2.0, October 2014 – this approach to recruitment has not yet 
been discussed with NCCIH, has not been proposed to the IRBs of record, and has not been implemented).  At present, STVHCS OSI includes the following components for enrolled participants:  
 - One-hour, group-based psychoeducational class on the dangers of opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007]  
- Limit of opi[INVESTIGATOR_425295] 30 days at a time with no automatic refills  (overseen 
in VISN 17 , Chief of Pharmacy)  
- Education for STVHCS on opi[INVESTIGATOR_425296]  
- Referral for substance abuse treatment through STVHCS Psychiatry  
STVHCS is currently in the process of hiring 6 new personnel for this initiative including a physician, a nurse, and a social worker (among others).  As of November 2014, these positions have not been hired. 
* Note: This section of the protocol will continue to be updated as the STVHCS 
OSI develops further.   
UPDATE (August 2015): In March 2015, [CONTACT_425462] (Interim Under Secretary for Health, Veterans Health Administration) testified before the Committee on Veteran’s Affairs in the [LOCATION_002] Senate.  She described the progress of the Opi[INVESTIGATOR_425297] (a  transcript of her testimony can be found at: 
http://www.veterans.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/VA%20Clancy%20Testimony%203.2
6.[ZIP_CODE].pdf ).  I n her testimony, [CONTACT_425463] described a system- wide decrease in 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_425298] (13%) and a decrease in persistent opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (15%).  She noted that rescheduling of hydrocodone prescription has further curtailed how opi[INVESTIGATOR_425299].  Finally, she reported on the significance of CAM programs for pain management as part of the OSI.  [CONTACT_425463]’s report highlights a unique opportunity for this NIH-funded study to add to this effort.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_425300] -PI ([CONTACT_425451]) to identify how the 
STVHCS PRC is managing OSI referrals and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_425301] (if approved by [CONTACT_156490]).  This would not only vastly increase the f easibility of recruitment, but also 
allow for a comparison between referred and non- referred patients to add in 
programmatic decision making at a Federal level (regarding a program like FORT -A 
as a CAM referral option for OSI patients).  There is no better time to do this, and addition of OSI -referred patients to our inclusion criteria would make this possible.

   5.4 Adherence Assessment  
Adherence for this research is addressed in the following three ways:  
Adherence of interventionists and assessors to manualized assessment and treatment 
procedures.  All interventions (FORT -A group, biofeedback, individual 
psychotherapy) will be provided by [CONTACT_425413] (or supervised STRONG STAR postdoctoral fellows/interns ) and a 
licensed Physical Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. Psychologists will be trained in the group intervention by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_425302]. Cindy McGeary using a “see one, do one” approach in which they will observe the [CONTACT_425454] McGeary running all 12 sessions of a clinical (non- research) group and be observed by [CONTACT_425414]. During her 
observation, [CONTACT_425454] McGeary will use a checklist of group session content (adapted from the same checklist used in the original FORT trial) to ensure that at least 90% of required content is covered at each session. If successful (e.g., covers 
90% of each session), the Psychologist will be “certified” and will be eligible to teach others. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_425303] U.S. Air Force’s biofeedback lab at Lackland Air Force Base (e.g., complete two mock biofeedback sessions with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_425304]-A patients). Group psychotherapy and biofeedback will be supervised weekly by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Cindy McGeary (the PI [INVESTIGATOR_425305], but will do this outside of supervision (in order to maintain blinding). Independent evaluators ( IE’s) will be trained on all psychosocial 
assessments by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_20196]. Cindy McGeary.  The IE’s will be trained on the timeline followback (TLFB ) opi[INVESTIGATOR_425306]. Blount, who w ill train 
each IE through [ADDRESS_537558] two clinical TLFB  assessments for 
review. If the IE achieves a 90% success rate or better both times they will be 
certified for TLFB . If they have been certified in TLFB  for another study, then this 
step can be skipped. We will randomly audiotape subsequent psychosocial assessment, TLFB , and FORT -A group administrations (≈10%) to assess for drift 
from the protocol using standardized checklists of required content to cover and ignore in each session  (performed by a non- study RA) . The P hysical T herapy  
assessment and treatment programs will be manualized and videotaped for protocol 
fidelity (accepted if at least 90% of required content is covered). PT’s and/or PT students will be trained by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Maureen Simmonds, who will also supervise.  A random selection (≈10%) of videotapes will be reviewed by a non-study RA to ensure there is no drift from the protocol. Prolonged Exposure (PE) treatment for PTSD (implemented during individual FORT -A individual psychotherapy appointments) 
will be supervised by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Tabatha Blount who is trained in PE. 
 Maintaining the blind during assessment certification: As is the case in other STRONG STAR studies, IEs will be trained and certified in assessment using non-study (i.e., clinical) cases.  This will allow for a more open dialogue about the assessment process during training with Drs. Blount, C. McGeary, and Simmonds.  Fidelity to the intervention will be completed by a STRONG STAR Research Assistant who is not part of this study team using standardized checklists. 
 
Participant adherence to FORT -A treatment.  As described above, FORT -A is an 
14-396H, McGeary, Form BB, 11-20-19, AMD.docx  
FORT- A Protocol, Version 9.0  35 of 75 Revision Date: [ADDRESS_537559], in the original FORT trial, every FORT participant attended all FORT classes and all PT sessions (with the exception of one who elected to undergo shoulder surgery during his enrollment in the study and ended his participation early).  FORT- A classes and PT session have some serial 
dependency (i.e., individual sessions build on one another), but many can stand alone.  FORT -A classes include homework, generally in the form of skills practice.  
Individual FORT-A psychotherapy includes a 6-session Prolonged Exposure protocol for PTSD symptoms.  Prolonged Exposure requires “trauma rehearsal” to promote 
habituation to traumatic memo ries.  PT for FORT includes group exercise 4 days a 
week followed home-based exercise on the weekends guided by “flowsheets.” All interventionists will be trained in motivational interviewing and problem-solving skills to help maximize patient adherence to study tasks.  For this research, “adherence” for each FORT -A component will be defined as follows:

Study interventionists will maintain study activity logs (see Appendix E , maintained 
centrally by [CONTACT_408]) where they will log the date and completion 
status of each clinical activity (including sessions attended or missed).  These will be brought to weekly interdisciplinary staffing meetings where adherence will be discussed and problem -solved by [CONTACT_425415].  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_425307] (he cannot stay when specific patients are discussed, even by [CONTACT_40337], because he

   6.2 Description of Evaluations  
6.2.1 Enrollment and Screening Evaluation (Week -4 to Week 0 ; See Figure 3) 
All screening will occur within 4 weeks after consent (so consent occurs at Week -4) 
Consenting Procedure  
Potential participants will have the study explained to them in a safe and private 
location. The Veteran will be given a copy of the informed consent document (ICD) to read. The research team member obtaining informed consent will then engage the Veteran i n an interactive explanation of the study guided by [CONTACT_425417]. After the Veteran has read the ICD, they will be given the opportunity to consider participation and discuss the research with other family and friends. The Research Team will be available to answer any questions about the research. Once the potential participant has reached a decision, the advising staff member will review the risks and benefits of study participation and ensure the Veteran has an understanding of the material d iscussed, and the risks and benefits of their potential involvement in 
the study. The advising staff member will have the participant sign the consent form. A copy of the signed ICD will be given to the Veteran. STRONG STAR addresses issues related to ment al capacity of potential participants through ongoing screening 
procedures using trained independent evaluators. Any concern that a potential 
participant is unable to comprehend what is being asked of them to participate in the 
research or the consent docu ment will be referred to a licensed psychologist for 
additional assessment. Similarly, any concerns identified during the course of the study that participants may no longer comprehend what is being asked of them or be able to engage in the study procedure s will be referred to a licensed psychologist and 
the research team.   All Veterans who have provided informed consent will be 
considered enrolled to the study. Consent will be tracked for each participant using the NCCIH Screening and Enrollment Log ( Appendix A3 ).   
 
Screening 
All participants will be screened after  consent (i.e., enrollment) and screening will be 
tracked by [CONTACT_425418], see Appendix H ).  Initial contact [CONTACT_425419] (in response to an advertisement of flyer, the Veteran will contact a member of the research team) or on referral from the Veteran’s STVHCS provider in the PRC, Pain Management Clinic, PTSD Clinical Team, or 
Primary Care Clinic.  Each clinic where we recruit for this research will be given a list of inclus ion and exclusion criteria for this research.  After providing informed 
consent, each Veteran will be screened to confirm their suitability for participation in this research.  Those who are found to be ineligible for this research study will be disenrolle d from the study as a “screen failure” and this will be tracked using the 
NCCIH Screening and Enrollment Log.  Screening will be completed by [CONTACT_425420] (IE) and a Clinical Psychology Fellow or Intern  (who will 
complete the clinical interview ).  The following assessments, assessment windows,  
and inclusion thresholds m ust be completed as part of screening :

The outcome of all screening will be briefed to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706] -Investigators during a 
weekly study meeting (in a de- identified format) for a final determination of each 
enrolled participant’s eligibility for the study.  Once confirmed eligible, participants 
are randomized.   The PI [INVESTIGATOR_425317].  
6.2.2 Randomization and Baseline 
Randomization  (Wk -4 to 0) 
Once the PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706]- Investigators have determined that a participant has satisfactorily 
met all inclusion/exclusion criteria, the participant will be randomized by [CONTACT_20234] (this could be done at any time from week -[ADDRESS_537578]) .  The date of randomization will be recorded on 
the Enrollment Log. 
The maximum allowable time between enrollment and randomization is 4 weeks .  If 
screening and determination of eligibility  goes beyond this allowable window, the 
participant will need to be re -screened before randomization . 
Baseline Assessments (Week 0; See Figure 4) 
Baseline assessment occurs within 4 weeks from the time of enrollment (regardless of 
when baseline assessment occurs relative to screening, Baseline Assessment is 
identified as Week 0) . 
 
For participants who have successfully been screened for eligibility  and are 
randomized into the study, baseline assessments are performed to measure the study outcomes. They also ensure that the groups are balanced with respect to baseline characteristics.

Randomization 
As noted above, participants will be randomly assigned to the FORT- A or PRC on a 
1:1 allocation ratio using a randomly selected block size with randomly permuted 
assignments within blocks.  In the original FORT study we found that the ideal treatment group size for each iteration of the program was 5 participants (though successful groups were able to run with as few of 3 members and as many as 7). Thus, we will attempt to fill treatment 
14-396H, McGeary, Form BB, 11-20-19, AMD.docx  
FORT- A Protocol, Version 9.0  47 of 75 Revision Date: 20 December 2019 
   cohorts for FORT -A and PRC with between 3 to 7 participants (as described in E frid, 
2011). The coordinator and co-coordinator will be blinded to all randomization 
assignments but will initiate a treatment cohort when a sufficient number of participants have been assigned.  
 There is a four-week  window between enrollment  and baseline assessment (Week -4 
to Week 0, as shown in 6.1).  Study intervention must begin within 2 week s after 
baseline to ensure that baseline assessment data adequately represent current  
functioning at the time of treatment, especially functional capacity evaluation [FCE] 
data that are used to guide the physical therapy portion of the interdisciplinary intervention.  T est-retest reliability of FCE has been confirmed over a period of two  
week s (Brouwer et al., 2003) , with only slight fluctuations in more frequent testing 
resulting in a slight increase in lifting capacity if repeated across two days, lik ely due 
to practice effects (Reneman et al., 2002).  Thus, intervention will generally begin 
within [ADDRESS_537583] and continuity of an 
interdisciplinary approach requires different interventionists to be able to talk to one another about patient progress.  This is particularly true in trials of openly symptomatic conditions (like chronic pain; see Friedberg, Lipsitz, & Natarajan, 2010).  There is no placebo control for an intervention like this (nor would the VHA allow one), so blinding is best accomplished through careful consideration of “need to know” privileging.  Figure [ADDRESS_537584] chosen to use a multi- level blinding scheme (as described by [CONTACT_164396].) in 
which study personnel will be blinded to randomized treatment con dition , assessment 
outcomes , or both (as shown in Figure 2). 
Study interventionists and their supervisors (for group psychosocial treatment; individual psychotherapy; biofeedback, and physical therapy) cannot be blinded to condition  because they will be aware of the treatment condition of the patients they 
treat.  Research Assistants (RA’s) , blinded to participant identity, will listen to audio 
recordings of treatment sessions and will rate adherence to the treatment manual using a standardized checklist (see Section 10.3 Quality Assurance) for more information about this.  The Research Coordinator and Co-Coordinator will be aware 
of participant condition (because they are responsible for randomizing and because they need to assist wi th adverse events monitoring and administrative oversight of 
treatment and assessment procedures ), but they will be blinded to outcomes .  The 
Coordinator and Co-Coordinator will not be directly involved in treatment or assessment and will be asked to only refer to participants by [CONTACT_425421]’s, the PI, or IE’s.   Independent Evaluators will

   become aware of outcomes during the course of their assessments, but will be blind to 
condition  of the participants they assess.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Maintaining Blinds  
During treatment sessions, interventionists are asked not to refer to the participant by [CONTACT_425422], the session number, and the unique study identifier for the participant(s) involved.  Because it is possible that the Research Assistant (RA) completing quality assurance may become aware of the identities of participants in the individual or group treatments, RA’s who complete quality assurance will not take part in outcomes assessments (which will only be completed by [CONTACT_425423]).    
Independent Evaluators will enter participant data from assessments directly into 
the secure STRONG STAR SQL Database using standard STRONG STAR operating procedures (see STRONG STAR Data Entry SOP, Appendix I). 
** The PI [INVESTIGATOR_425320] ([CONTACT_425452], [CONTACT_425451]) will sit in on weekly 
interdisciplinary staff meetings with study interventionists to discuss the progress of all study participants (both FORT- A and Treatment -As-Usual) during which 
participants wi ll be discu ssed by [CONTACT_425424].

would like to participate. The Missing Data Assessment is a 4 -item measure of global 
symptom improvement of pain, perception of satisfaction and burdensomeness of 
study treatments, and reason( s) for discontinuing study participation. This assessment 
will be used to assess missing data randomness and to categorize participants who discontinued study participation as a way to help impute missing data and improve future studies with these treatmen ts in similar populations.  
7. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS 
 
Upon enrollment, all participants will be monitored for relevant risks through adverse events monitoring protocols (guided in part by [CONTACT_425425] (see APPENDIX J ).  For this study, there is risk for adverse events related broadly to 
psychological distress , physical injury, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_43351].  
7.1 Specification of Safety Parameters 
Section 7.3 of this protocol describes a number of formal assessment measures and 
related safety thresholds.  Along with these formal assessment measures, we will also assess pain intensity ratings for each participant before and after each session of study- related Physical Therapy.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_260235] a study of pain intensity ratings in 
functional restoration programs and noted that participants who reported pain on a 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale between 8 -10/10 generally demonstrated worse outcomes 
after trea tment.  Thus, individuals reporting pain after PT sessions with pain ratings 
between 8 -10/[ADDRESS_537586]. Simmonds  or a PRC PT/OT  and

FORT -A Protocol, Version 9.0  51 of 75 Revision Date: [ADDRESS_537587] recommendations (Turk et al., 2003) and will be tracked, monitored, and adjudicated for this research in accordance with Appendix J .  Physical Therapy and 
Psychotherapy treatment providers will maintain regular clinical notes input within [ADDRESS_537588] (in accordance 
with Appendix K ).  These data will be discussed and analyzed during the weekly 
research meeting with the PI [CONTACT_1629] d Co -Investigators during which the risk profile will 
be determined and addressed.  
Behavioral health interventions for chronic pain tend to be safe compared to medical 
interventions (Morley et al., 1999).  Although there are data describing the adverse 
effects associated with introducing opi[INVESTIGATOR_425322] a pain management program (see Moore & McQuay, 2005), there is little in the extant literature describing the risks of opi[INVESTIGATOR_425323] a program like the OSI (including risk for opi[INVESTIGATOR_425324]) .  Indeed, data from the original FORT 
trial did not reveal any adverse consequences of opi[INVESTIGATOR_425325].   
A comprehensive review of Physical Therapy outcomes among military PT service recipi[INVESTIGATOR_425326] 472,013 PT visits across 40 months revealed no significant adverse effects of PT for active duty and Veteran patients seeking PT services (Moore et al., 2005) .  However, Carlesso and colleagues (2010) suggest that this negative 
finding is likely a function of poor adverse event surveillance in research utilizing PT.   
The STRONG STAR Consortium recently published a description of Adverse Events 
monitoring guidel ines and recommendations for behavioral health trials including a 
PTSD diagnosed population (Peterson et al., 2013).  These recommendations have been incorporated into the risk monitoring procedures used for the proposed study.  
7.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
An adverse event  (AE) is generally defined as any  unfavorable and unintended 
diagnosis, symptom, sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), syndrome or disease which either occurs during the study, having been absent at baseline, or if 
present at baseline, appears to worsen.  Adverse events are to be recording regardless 
of their relatio nship to the study intervention.   
A serious adverse event  (SAE)  is generally defined as  any untoward medical 
occurrence that results in death, is life threatening, requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_226526], results in persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly.  
AEs and SAEs may be related directly to research participation or unrelated to 
research. Potential research -related AEs and SAEs for this study include the 
following:

   Research Related  Increased PTSD symptoms  
Increased pain intensity 
Increased emotional distress  
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_425327]: Flu  Example: New Injury  
 
 
All AE and SAE monitoring will be completed using the STRONG STAR procedures 
for Adverse Events Monitoring, Documentation, and Adjudication ( Appendi ces J, L, 
and M ).  Any study member who identifies an AE or SAE will immediately report it 
to the study coordinator and begin the process for prompt reporting to the IRB pursuant to the SOP.  SAE and AE report forms (see attachment SOP s) will be 
forwarded to STRONG STAR Regulatory Personnel who will prepare the official report to the IRB.  Each participant chart includes an AE/SAE tracking form in which AEs and SAEs will be documented by [CONTACT_425426] (per the SOP)  
Adverse events will be monitored through the following mechanisms:  
AE/SAE  Assessment Tool  Notes  
PTSD Symptoms  PCL-5 Given at every assessment interval and 
at every individual PTSD treatment 
session for FORT -A participants  
Clinical significant change for the PCL -
5 has not yet been established, so we 
will use a 20 -point increase in 
symptoms as a clinically significant 
indicator of PTSD symptoms (based on 
the previous version of the PCL; see 
Appendi x N) 
Pain Intensity  Numeric Rating Scale

a score above 15 show significant 
change (requiring AE report) if the 
score rises 5 points or more.  If item #9 
increases at all, this will be reported an 
AE.  An increase of Item #9 by 2 points 
or more will be considered a SAE.  
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_425329] -A

treatment and at all assessment intervals for all follow -up intervals.  A SOWS

 This study maintains a weekly research meeting (starting September 2015; currently 
set for Thursday morning from 1030-1100 at the STRONG STAR Conference Room  
with an open phone line for those who need to call into the meeting) to discuss research progress and to discuss participant status and flow throughout the research process.  All Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse (SAEs) will be discussed at these meetings (attended by [CONTACT_425427]).  To protect blinding, partici pants will be 
discussed by [CONTACT_425428].  
AE reporting procedures (as described in the attached SOP) will begin immediately 
after an AE is noticed and will be reported to the IRB after discussion at the weekly research meeting.  SAEs must be reported to the IRB within 24 -48 hours.  If a 
protocol deviation, SAE or UPI[INVESTIGATOR_425330] 48 hours, a reason will need to be documented on the P50 form. 
7.4 Reporting Procedures 
Reporting procedures for all AEs and SAEs are described in Appendices J and L  
(STRONG STAR Adverse Events SOP).  The P50 reporting template (included with 
the SOP Appendix J) will be used to document all AEs and to record their classification and reporting timelines.   The severity and research relatedness of AEs 
and SAEs will be determined by [CONTACT_9154] ([CONTACT_255349] McGeary) pursuant to the STRONG STAR Adverse Events Adjudication SOP ( Appendix M ).

   7.5 Followup for Adverse Events  
If an adverse event does not require disenrollment and referral to VA physical or 
mental health services, then the research team will offer adjunctive services for attrition prevention as outlined in the STRONG STAR ASAP SOP (Appendix O ).  
Adjunct services and attrition prevention (ASAP) involves the structured provision of 
extra adjunctive psychotherapy or medical consultation services designed to mitigate 
risk of adverse events and maintain participants on protocol (within the limits o f good 
ethics and cl inical practice). ASAP sessions can be prompted by [CONTACT_2299], an 
IE, or an interventionist.  These sessions are defined in the SOP as “any out of 
protocol contact (in person or by [CONTACT_756]) lasting longer than 20 minutes.  Each 
participant is allowe d three ASAP sessions during protocol intervention.  If more 
intervention is needed, or the PI [INVESTIGATOR_402500] a higher level of intervention is needed, 
then the participant will be dropped from protocol treatment and referred for appropriate intervention in the VA.   For participants remaining on protocol with 
ASAP or referral services, progress will be briefed to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_425331].  When the participant and provider report resolution or stability of symptoms, the participant will be re -assessed with t he index measure (e.g., PHQ- 9 for depression, 
NRS for pain) and the results will be discussed with the PI (using only the unique identifier for the participant to maintain blinding) for a final determination of resolution and continuation on protocol.  
Please note that STRONG STAR maintains a separate SOP for the monitoring, management, and intervention of suicide risk in study participants (as detailed in Appendix P ).  As detailed in the Suicide Risk SOP, all study staff are thoroughly 
trained in suicide risk assessment, with formal assessments overseen by a licensed 
psychologist.  This SOP describes specific algorithms for risk level determination and pathways for i ntervention, follow -up, and implications for research involvement.  
7.6 Safety Monitoring  
STRONG STAR does maintain a SOP for External Monitoring of all consortium studies (see Appendix Q).  This has been attached for NCCIH’s information, and 
safety will be monitored in a manner consistent with standard STRONG STAR practice and will be overseen by [CONTACT_425429] . 
8. INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION  
There are few reasons for discontinuing any participant from this study.  However, under certain circumstances, it may be necessary to buttress study -related treatment to 
stabilize temporary conditions needing immediate intervention.  The STRONG STAR Research Consortium has established an Adjunctive Services and Attrition Prevention 
(ASAP) policy (see Appendix O ) describing a preliminary step for intervention in 
which a distressed participant will be allowed three out -of-protocol intervention 
sessions (with  their individual or group psychotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]) of 20 minutes or less to 
stabilize their condition.  Should a pre -determined recovery criterion be met (it is 
impossible to predict all potential emergencies and goals are determined by [CONTACT_425430]) , then the participant will remain enrolled 
in the study.  If recovery is not achieved, then the research team (led by [CONTACT_978]) will 
14-396H, McGeary, Form BB, 11- 20-19, AMD.docx  
FORT -A Protocol, Version 9.0  55 of 75 Revision Date: 20 December 2019 
   decide on whether the participant should be retained.  Those requiring a referral for 
services outside of the study (i.e., if ASAP is not sufficient for symptom management) will be referred to the appropriate services based on the STRONG STAR Suicide Risk SOP ( Appendix P), through the VA Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (i.e., STVHCS), or 
using the San Antonio area referrals as described on the STRONG STAR Referral Form (Appendix R 1).  All participants referred for services outside of the study 
protocol will be tracked using the S TRONG STAR Referral Form (Appendix R2 ). If 
a participant needs to be screened for safety when he/she is outside of the immediate San Antonio area, a distance assessment will be completed as described in Appendix 
R3. The following are examples of conditions/circumstances subject to the ASAP 
process (all of which would qualify as AEs and be tracked/documented accordingly) : 
1. Presence of Suicidal Ideation: If suicidality is identified during the course of study participation, it is vital that this be addressed and stabilized as quickly as possible.  Suicide risk will be monitored, classified, and acted -upon based on the 
STRONG STAR Suicide Risk SOP.  
2. Physical Injury during PT: If a participant sustains an injury during PT, [CONTACT_425461] will collaborate with [CONTACT_425451] or [CONTACT_425452] to determine if brief ASAP intervention will help restore function and allow continuation of the study protocol.  
3. Exacerbation of PTSD or Depression Symptoms:  In any study involving the 
treatment PTSD, there is a chance that emotional distress may temporarily worsen.  If this happens, adjunctive treatment will be provided using the ASAP protocol.  
4. Opi[INVESTIGATOR_425332]:  During the course of this study, some participants 
may choose to stop taking opi[INVESTIGATOR_37007] (though this is not mandatory), 
which is increasingly likely in light of recent federal changes to VA prescription 
practices and the VA’s Opi[INVESTIGATOR_425333].  Those who discontinue persistent 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_425334], group, and assessment appointments.  Should these symptoms be identified, [CONTACT_425451] and/ or [CONTACT_425452] will be notified.  They 
will meet with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_425335]. 
Participant s will continue to be followed with their permission if study intervention is 
discontinued. There will be no m odifications to the schedule and duration of 
continued followup  if the participant is referred to the VA system for treatment and 
stabilization (though we will ask permission for frequent checks with the participant on their status to ensure that they are doing well and recovering) . They will still be 
asked to complete all measures at all remaining follow -up intervals.   
9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 General Design Issues  
Primary Hypothesis: FORT -A participants will demonstrate significantly greater 
improvements in self -reported than those receiving PRC treatment as usual (TAU).  
14-396H, McGeary, Form BB, 11-20-19, AMD.docx  
FORT- A Protocol, Version 9.0  56 of 75 Revision Date: 20 December 2019 
   “Greater improvement” is defined in this study as statistically significant lower  ODI 
scores for FORT -A compared to TAU at one-year post- treatment follow -up 
controlling for differences in ODI at pre -treatment.  Logic for selection of ODI as the 
primary outcome is described in Section 3 of this protocol.  Validity and reliability of 
the ODI has been well -established in over 100 published studies, and use of the ODI 
will allow comparison of the proposed study results to numerous other pain populations and interventions (allowing for better prediction of result generalizability outside of the population of interest ; Fairbank et al., 1980; Fairbank & Pynsent, 
2000).  
Study Design and Rationale: To test the primary hypothesis, the proposed research needs to simply determine that the experimental intervention (FORT -A) is superior to 
treatment as usual.  The unique requirements of the VA and DoD systems preclude a truly controlled trial (i.e., military and VA IRBs will not approve research denying access to treatment for their covered constituents).  Thus, FORT -A cannot be 
compared to a no-treatment control condition.  Because of the variability in chronic pain intervention in the VA system, definition of treatment- as-usual can be difficult.  
In the original FORT trial, we chose to compare the FORT program to the best available intervention that the DoD had to offer for chronic pain.  If FORT was truly an innovative and high- impact intervention, then it should be better than anything else 
that the military was using to manage chronic pain.  Similar logic applies to the present study.  FORT-A was developed to improve upon the original FORT program for application to a more complex patient population than that treated in the FORT study.  Fortunately, the best available intervention for complex chronic pain in the VA right is through the Polytrauma Rehabilitation Center, making the PRC a natural comparator for this study.  Better yet, the PRC is a structured, interdisciplinary 
program in which all enrolled participants have access to PT services and an 
interdisciplinary treatment team.  If FORT -A is a truly innovative and high- impact 
intervention, then it should out- perform the P RC (which has openly expressed 
difficulty in managing chronic pain; Strasser et al., 2008; Clark et al., 2009; Friedemann -Sanchez et al., 2008).   Thus, the most parsimonious design for this 
research is a two -arm, randomized clinical trial comparing 3 weeks of FORT -A to 3 
weeks of PRC intervention.  After completion of the three week intervention phase, all participants will be permitted to seek additional treatment through the VA system (which is mandated by [CONTACT_32084]).  We will track treatment engagement through a review of the VA electronic medical record (CPRS, to which all study team members will have access) and interviews with participants at all follow -up assessment 
intervals.  
Secondary Hypothesis:  FORT -A participants will demonstrate significantly lower 
rates of opi[INVESTIGATOR_425336]- year post -treatment.  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_425337] a timeline follow -back 
interview and MEMS caps (with the timeline follow -back as the primary measure 
based on its documented reliability and validity; Sobell & Sobell, 1992).   
• We are currently discussing the value of adding urine tox screens at pre-treatment, post -treatment, and one-year follow-up.  The study team 
previously eschewed the use of a urine tox screen for this research endpoint 
14-396H, McGeary, Form BB, 11-20-19, AMD.docx  
FORT- A Protocol, Version 9.0  57 of 75 Revision Date: [ADDRESS_537589] identified certain tests applied to a urine sample that can reliably and valid ly illuminate opi[INVESTIGATOR_294002].  We are still examining 
this addition and how we might be able to partner with the VA to add this to our outcome battery (after discussing this with NCCIH more, of course) without additional cost.  The VA system has incre ased implementation of 
urine tox screens for opi[INVESTIGATOR_425338] (see 
http://www.veterans.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/VA%20Clancy%20Testimony
%203.26.[ZIP_CODE].pdf ).  However, studies in the PRC population using urine tox 
screening risk high attrition because Veterans may feel mistrusted.  Because timeline followback has shown reliability and validity in the past, we have chosen to stay with this method for tracking opi[INVESTIGATOR_425339].  However, we will have access to electronic medical records (CPRS) to identify new opi[INVESTIGATOR_425340]. Eapen and [CONTACT_425452] can access the Prescription Access in [LOCATION_007] website (see 
https://www.texaspatx.com/Tutorial/Doc/PATIIFAQs.pdf ), the [LOCATION_007] State 
prescription monitoring program, to identify opi[INVESTIGATOR_425341].  We are able to keep all opi[INVESTIGATOR_425342].  
Tertiary Hypotheses:  
• We plan to use mixed effects hierarchical regression with polynomial change parameters to assess differences in change trajectories for variables related to physical function (functional capacity evaluation, Actiwatch ), psychosocial 
functioning ( PHQ-9, PTSD Checklist), and pain variables (Pain Acceptance 
Questionnaire, Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Pain Intensity Rating).  All of these measures were used in the previous FORT study with established reliability and validity.  
Exploratory Hypothesis :  Based on the PI’s ESCAPE trial, we will evaluate the 
contribution of perceived burdensomeness and pain- related helplessness as potential 
mediators of the study’s primary and secondary endpoints.  A subsequent analysis of the ESCAPE data (currently in preparation for publication) has also shown that depression symptoms may mediate these outcomes as well.

intervention groups on the primary outcome (ODI score)  at the 12- month follow -up 
time period. This endpoint was chosen as it represents the durability of the treatment effect and best reflects the potential utility of the FORT -A program for improving the 
life of patients. The effect sizes used in the calculat ion are based on our previous 
FORT trial, for which treatment effects in the FORT study arm were maintained at the one-y ear follow -up.

clinically superi or to Treatment As Usual in this complex patient population.  Second, 
the PI’s previous military FORT study revealed a significant decrease in opi[INVESTIGATOR_425343] (compared to TAU).  The resulting data suggest that improved pain ma nagement through functional restoration is a likely 
mechanism opi[INVESTIGATOR_425344].  Thus, Aim [ADDRESS_537592] chosen to assess medication (opi[INVESTIGATOR_9787]- opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]) 
use on a monthly basis (during follow -up assessments and monthly phone calls) using 
the TLFB and the MQS.   The increased frequency in assessment (each measure will 
be given 12 times) will provide ample power to detect between -groups difference in 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_425345] 12- month study period.  Assuming a sample size of N = 
130 (n = 65/group), 12 data collection periods (monthly follow -ups for one year), and 
a statistical significance level of 0.05, the analysis will have power = .[ADDRESS_537593] a clinically meaningful difference between the study groups. For example, if the control group exhibits a recidivism rate of 45% (as suggested in Section 2.1 of this document) and the a ctive treatment group exhibits a recidivism rate of 22.5%, the 
study will have power = .80. 
We will enroll n = 65 (N = 130) and anticipate <= 30% all -source attrition rate as in 
our previous study. Assuming that at the 12- month follow -up the standard care 
treatment arm will report mean (SD) ODI scores of 19.5 (6.6), using a two -tailed α = 
0.05, w e will have power = 0.[ADDRESS_537594] sizes as small as d = 0.50.  For the 
ODI, this is equivalent to a clinically meaningful 3.[ADDRESS_537595] that up to 30% of individuals will require imputation of some kind, our expected effect sizes can be attenuated by ~ 60% with sufficient power to detect a clinically meaningful difference. Differences  smaller than 3.3 points on the ODI are 
unlikely to be clinically meaningful.  
Treatment Assignment Procedures 
Participants  will be randomly assigned  to each of the study arms based on the  
rationale and  procedures outlined in sections 6.2.2 and 6.2.3 of this protocol.  
Masking will be managed using the diagram shown in Figure 2.  Pursuant to this diagram, masking will be overseen and maintained through a collaboration between the study coordinator (who will not be blind to any part of this study to all for better track ing of participant flow and AEs; though the Coordinator will not take part in any 
evaluations and is forbidden to discuss blinded information with any study team member without first discussing it with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_425346]) and th e STRONG STAR Data Core (which maintains the link 
between identity and participant number).  Masking of treatment arm to the participant or provider is absolutely impossible in a behavioral trial.  Plans for

   retention of the blind are described in sections 5.2, 5.4, and [IP_ADDRESS] of this protocol.  If 
a blind must be broken (e.g, to protect the safety of a participant), then the blind can only be broken by [CONTACT_425431]/or Co- Coordinator after consultation 
and permission from the PI [INVESTIGATOR_425347].  To break the blind, the Coordinator will contact [CONTACT_425432].   
9.3  Definition of Populations 
For this study, the per -protocol population will include all participants who completed 
all assessments and interventions with no major protocol deviations (as defined by 
[INVESTIGATOR_321379], 2011). The primary analysis will be conducted on the Intent -to-Treat (ITT) 
population that will include all randomized participants who have completed baseline assessments. . In the original trial, all FORT completers participated in all 
assessments, but approximately 20% of Treatment as Usual participants were lost to follow -up.  Analysis of baseline data revealed that most missing data were missing at 
random.   
9.[ADDRESS_537596] been thoroughly studied in other research and it is predicted that the need for a safety review will be low.  However, there are some circumstances that would require suspension of study activity and review of safety by [CONTACT_425433]:  
• This is one of the first studies of an interdisciplinary pain program for chronic 
pain and trauma polymorbidity.  The PIs STRONG STAR Pain and PTSD 
Study revealed no significant exacerbation of PTSD symptoms in a combined pain and PTSD protocol, but PT was  not involved in that protocol.  There is 
no reason right now to believe that Physical Therapy will exacerbate PTSD symptoms, but if this were to occur (based on a 20 point increase on the PCL -
5) then a safety review would be needed to determine if the stu dy must stop.  
This finding would also need to be adjudicated through the AE process.  
• As noted above, opi[INVESTIGATOR_425348], and a score above 11 on the SOWS will require safety review. 
• If physical injury or emotional disruption AEs accumulate (more than 4 minor; easily recovered within one day – or 2 major; requiring more than ASAP intervention to stabilize) then a safety review will be in order.

   Such findings are presented to the study statistician or to the Independent Monitoring 
Committee (IMC) statistician to review the events by [CONTACT_425434]. The statistician reports his findings to a closed session of the IMC  or to the Safety Officer and/or NCCIH. The findings are 
used to determine what steps will be taken.  
9.5 Outcomes  
9.5.1 Primary Outcome   
The primary outcome for this research is self -reported disability based on the 
Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). The ODI is a ten -item self -report disability measure 
assessing an individual’s perception of limitation in a number of different life domains due to pain.  Each of the ten items asks the participant to use a 0 to 5 numeric rating scale (each with a specifi c anchor) to rate the extent to which they feel 
that their functioning is restricted because of their pain.  To score the measure, the individua l score for each item is summed into a total score and the total score is then 
divided by 50 and multiplied by 100 to generate a total score ranging from 0 to 100.  This total score represents a % disability score which can be categorized as Minimal (0-20%), Moderate (21- 40%), Severe (41- 60%), Crippled (61 -80%), or Bed 
Bound/Exaggerating (81 -100%).   The ODI has been cited over 200 times in the 
scientific research literature with firmly established validity for self- report disability 
due to chronic pain (Fa irbank & Pynsent, 2000).  The original ODI (a measure 
specific to spi[INVESTIGATOR_18172]) has been updated in Version 2.0 to include extremities in the instructions allowing the measure to validly assess spi[INVESTIGATOR_425349] -related 
disability (Roland & Fairbank, 2000).  When compared against the Roland -Morris 
Disability Questionnaire (another gold- standard spi[INVESTIGATOR_425350]), the ODI has shown better sensitivity to change at higher levels of di sability and is the better measure for this 
research (Roland & Fairbank, 2000). The ODI can be completed in [ADDRESS_537597], self -report assessment, there is hardly ever 
a need to adjudicate responses and scoring.  However, in some circumstances (e.g., an 
item is left blank, selection of a response is not clearly marked or covers more than one response) a response will need to be adjudicated between the IE, the Coordinat or, 
and the PI.  Meetings for adjudication will occur on an as -needed basis and the 
Coordinator will ensure that testing materials are not identifiable before discussion with the PI (all assessments will be recorded using only the participant’s unique identifier).  Adjudication will need to occur within 2 business days from the time that an aberrant or unclear response is noted.  
Among the numerous options for pain- related disability assessment, the Oswestry 
was chosen because of its strength as a predictor of long -term outcome in the original 
FORT trial and the attention this measure has received in back pain research.   
The 
original FORT trial included many outcome measures.  Measures of functional capacity were 
14-396H, McGeary, Form BB, 11-20-19, AMD.docx  
FORT- A Protocol, Version 9.0  61 of 75 Revision Date: [ADDRESS_537598] responsive to changes (which makes sense based on FORT’s emphasis of function over 
palliative pain control). We compared 4 functional measures (Floor -to-waist lift [FTW], 
waist -to-eye level lift [WTE], Oswestry Disability Index [ODI], Million Visual A nalog Scale 
[MVAS]).  Of the [ADDRESS_537599] -to-Eye

Pain Rating  -.099 -.219 .856 .816 
9.5.2 Secondary Outcomes   
There are numerous secondary outcomes for this study that can be meaningfully categorized as physical measures (functional capacity evaluation, Actiwatch ), 
medication (MEMS, timeline followback interview , MQS), psychosocial pain (Pain 
Catastrophizing Scale) and psychosocial trauma and emotional distress (measures of PTSD, depression, suicide risk, etc.).  Because these measurement categories all require separate skillsets for interpretation of problematic or a mbiguous results, they 
must all be adjudicated t hrough separate subcommittees within the study team and the 
STRONG STAR Consortium as follows:  
Physical Measures will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_978], the Research Coordinator, and [CONTACT_425464] (an internationally-recognized expert in Physical Therapy assessment for chronic pain)  or a PRC PT/OT .  Functional Capacity Evaluation 
(FCE) data will be recorded by [CONTACT_425435]/or PRC PT/OT providers  
and will be discussed with [CONTACT_425461] or a PRC PT/OT  within two business days 
after each assessment.  Data will be scrutinized by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Simmonds or a PRC PT/OT in raw format and interpretations will be recorded.  Any ambiguity in the data will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_425436] -committee including the PI, the PT 
Interventionist(s) , and [CONTACT_425461] OR a PRC PT/OT.  Data will be examined and 
discussed using unique identifiers only.  Actiwatch data will be uploaded by a STRONG STAR IE at pre- treatment and all follow -up assessments and uploaded data 
will be scrutinized by [CONTACT_35520] (who will be trained in the use of the Actiwatch  system 
by [CONTACT_978] – with consultation fr om the manufacturer if needed) who will identify any 
aberrations in data that may require adjudication.  Actiwatch data will be adjudicated 
using the same timeframe, methods, and subcommittee as the PT data. 
NOTE: Actiwatch was chosen over Actical for this research based on data suggesting that actigraphy offers usable data after 10 days of wear time (Freedson, 2014; Mailey et al., 2014) and that wrist-worn actigraph is more sensitive to intensity of movement 
14-396H, McGeary, Form BB, 11-20-19, AMD.docx  
FORT- A Protocol, Version 9.0  62 of 75 Revision Date: 20 December 2019 
   than hip-worn actigraph (Mendoza et al., 2014). Thus, we will use the Actiwatch in 
10-day epochs (participants will be asked to wear them for 12 or more hours per day; per Hermann et al., 2012) at every assessment period (instead of continuous wear for 6-months at a time). Previous studies have shown higher rates of adherence using 10-day epochs. 
Medication Data  will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_978], the Research Coordinator, and [CONTACT_425460] (an expert in trauma and addiction comorbidity). Timeline followback interview and M QS-III data will be discussed for each participant by [CONTACT_425437].  If there are any noted problems with the TLFB  data, then the assessment will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_425438]-committee within 2 days of review.  MEMS cap data will be gathered for each participant ’s report ed “most helpful” pain medication and any opi[INVESTIGATOR_425351].  MEMS data will be downloaded for each participant at each assessment follow -up visit.  Upon download, the IE will scrutinize 
downloaded data to ensure that it falls within an expected range.  If aberrant or missing data are noted, these will be adjudicated with the above sub- committee (and 
potentially discussed with the manufacturer if hardware or software problems are suspected) in a deidentified format.  
The primary opi[INVESTIGATOR_425352] ( TLFB ) interview. The 
TLFB  represents the primary measure of opi[INVESTIGATOR_425353] a daily measure of opi[INVESTIGATOR_425354].  A trained and masked IE will administer TLFB  asking 
participants about any opi[INVESTIGATOR_425355].  The TLFB  Interview for this study was adapted from Sobell and Sobell (1992) as a 
semi -structure d clinical interview asking the participant to use a blank calendar to 
describe the number of pain pi[INVESTIGATOR_425356] 30 days. Instructions are provided to help the interviewer guide the participant in completing the recall as accurately as possible.   This method has been reliably used in other trials of 
medication/opi[INVESTIGATOR_280148] (Kunoe et al., 2009). 
Study personnel blind to participant randomization can use the VA electronic health 
record (CPRS) to identify active and new opi[INVESTIGATOR_425357].  Study physicians ([CONTACT_425451] and [CONTACT_425452]) get free access to the Prescription Access in [LOCATION_007] (PAT) prescription monitoring program to examine any and all Schedule II through V medications given by [CONTACT_425439].  Both CPRS and PAT (which maintains records of medications dispensed to a patient for 365 days) will be accessed at each Veteran’s 
one-year follow- up visit to identify medications prescribed over the one -year study 
participation period.  
 
Psychosocial Trauma and Emotional Measures  will be adjudicated through the 
STRONG STAR Assessment Core using existing SOP for surveillance and adjudication of these measure.  STRONG STAR has implemented this process for military and VA studies serving thousands of study participants across dozens of

   studies ( see Appendix J ).  
9.6 Data Analyses  
Data Analysis: To examine our aims and hypotheses we will utilize the generalized 
linear model, which allows specification of an appropriate distribution for each outcome that can accommodate continuous outcomes (e.g., normal distribution with identity or log link for self- reported disability) and presence/absence outcomes (e.g, 
binomial with logit link for probability of daily opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]). We will not stratify our analyses by [CONTACT_425440], but will account for these variables in our data analysis . Furthermore, we will attend to the influence of missing data on our analyses, 
and plan on conducting missing values analysis to inform several sensitivity analyses (e.g., LOCF, multiple imputation, etc.) to ensure an intent -to treat principle is 
observed. Specifically, we will examine the MAR assumption by [CONTACT_425441], treatment adherence, or other time-varying predictors. O ur RCT has one  primary endpoint (Oswestry ), so both 
primary and s econdary outcomes will be interpreted at a conventional level of 
statistical significance, p < 0.05. To adhere to NIH policy of examining gender and ethnic subgroup analyses, we will add interaction terms (i.e., treatment group x subgroup) for each of our planned analyses. E ach analysis is further detailed below:  
AIM 1: Assess the efficacy of the FORT -A Program for improved pain 
management outcomes in (N=130) polymorbid OEF/OIF/OND PRC Veterans with chronic orthopedic pain using a 1:[ADDRESS_537600] PRC care. To examine our primary hypothesis, we will compare the self -
reported disability scores of the two groups at 12 -month follow -up while controlling 
for baseline scores (i.e., an ANCOVA approach) . A statistically significant main 
effect will be interpreted as the groups exhib iting differential change in regards 
disability. Secondary analyses will use growth curve modeling (mixed effects hierarchical regression with polynomial change parameters) which will model differences in change trajectory over time between the groups across assessment occasions.  
AIM 2: Assess the efficacy of FORT -A for decreasing the rate of opi[INVESTIGATOR_425358] a sample of OEF/OIF/OND polymorbid LBP Veterans. To examine our primary hypothesis, we will compare the rate of opi[INVESTIGATOR_425359] 12- month follow -up. As noted above, 30- 40% of TAU participants are expected to 
meet criteria for opi[INVESTIGATOR_425221] (use of any opi[INVESTIGATOR_425229] [ADDRESS_537601] 30 days at each assessment). A statistically significant main effect will be interpreted as the groups exhibiting differential change in regards disability. Secondary analyses will be conducted using growth curve modeling (i.e., mixed effects hierarchical regression with polynomial ch ange parameters to model 
differences in the trajectory of opi[INVESTIGATOR_425360] ).  
EXPLORATORY AIM 3: To examine the role of helplessness and perceived 
burdensomeness in predicting the trajectory of change over time, we will use latent 
14-396H, McGeary, Form BB, 11- 20-19, AMD.docx  
FORT -A Protocol, Version 9.0  64 of 75 Revision Date: [ADDRESS_537602] model the trajectory of change in the two 
primary outcomes as a function of group (Aim 1 and Aim 2). We will then model the trajectories of helplessness and perceived burdensomeness as a function of group. Assuming both associations are observed (i.e., that group status is related to changes in the outcomes and the mediators), we will conduct hierarchical entry of group status and each mediator to examine if group status is still associated with outcome after adjusting f or changes in the mediators. This will allow us to assess the role of the 
mediators in predicting the outcome and the proportion of change trajectory attributed to changes in these mediators.  
10. DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
10.1 Data Collection Forms  
Data will be collected by [CONTACT_425442].  As described in the STRONG STAR Data En try SOP (see Appendix S ), data are double -entered to minimize 
transcription errors and all data entry forms include appropriate data entry masks that limit the format and scope of entered data (to ensure that out -of-range values are not 
erroneously recorde d) with provided feedback if entered data exceed expected ranges.  
STRONG STAR has developed strict rules guiding the translation of assessment measures and data recording forms into digital formats as outlined in Appendix T . 
Paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_425361].  The STRONG STAR Network is FISMA compliant and has received permission from the 
VHA for th e storage of Veteran study dat a (which is very strictly controlled by [CONTACT_425443]).  Because the STRONG STAR Database is accessible through a secure 
internet portal, data can be entered into the system directly from any VA computer 
with internet access (of which this study currently has dedicated access to two through the PRC).  To ensure confidentiality of patient records, all data are entered into study records using the participant’s unique ID.  A link between identifiers and the ID is maintained in a separate data table with access restricted to individuals who are not blind to patient identifiers (e.g., study Coordinator, interventionists).   
10.2 Data Management   
Data will be coded using an assigned number. Data collected during treatment will be entered into a secure STRONG STAR database, and hardcopi[INVESTIGATOR_425362] a lock box which will  be transported by [CONTACT_425444] (UTHSCSA)  STRONG STAR offices by a STRONG STAR staff 
member who will place it into the locked  cabinets at the STRONG STAR offices. 
Audio and video recordings will be uploaded to a secure  STRONG STAR server over 
an encrypted network connection betw een VA networks and  UTHSCSA networks. 
Members of the study team will have access to the data. Every member of  the 
Research Team will be trained and monitored about how to handle and protect both medical  and research records. Furthermore, the Research Team strictly controls 
access to study data using policies and procedures developed specifically for the 
14-396H, McGeary, Form BB, 11- 20-19, AMD.docx  
FORT -A Protocol, Version 9.0  65 of 75 Revision Date: 20 December 2019 
   STRONG STAR Research  Consortium. Adverse Events will be immediately brought 
to the study PI  [INVESTIGATOR_425363]. AE’s will be identified 
by [CONTACT_425445].  If the participant’s identity is 
needed to effectively manage an AE, then the Study Coordinator will link the unique identifier to the specific participant (the Coordinator will m aintain a link between PHI 
and unique identifiers through the STRONG STAR Data Core dashboard) . A 
STRONG STAR Data Safety and Monitoring Plan (DSMP) has been developed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Human Research  
Protection (OHRP) to assure the appropriate clinical safety monitoring of study 
subjects  participating in all of its studies. The STRONG STAR database has been 
certified as FISMA -compliant  and has been formally cleared for the management of 
Veteran data through the VA.  
10.[ADDRESS_537603] (Appendix U ) for submission to 
the Study Coordinator, PI, and the STRONG STAR Admin Core for review.  
Discrepancies or problems will be addressed by [CONTACT_425446] [INVESTIGATOR_425364].   
10.3.3 Metrics 
As shown in Appendix U, quality control metrics include appropriate organization of 
study documents, confirmation of regulatory document versions, verification of enrollment protocols, documentation and adjudication of AEs, storage of data, and documentation/report/adjudication of protocol deviations.  
10.3.4 Protocol Deviations 
The STRONG STAR Protocol Deviation and AE SOP ( Appendix V  and W ) 
thoroughly describes the mechanisms and responsibilities for tracking, documenting, and adjudicating protocol deviations.  Briefly, each participant chart will include a Protocol Variance and Deviation Log that will be used to track and document deviations from protocol.  Responsibility for tracking deviations lies with the study staff member who first discovers a provider or participant deviation from protocol 
(advertent or inadvertent).  STR ONG STAR Regulatory (aka the STRONG STAR 
Admin Core) is responsible for working with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_425365].  Deviations are entered 
14-396H, McGeary, Form BB, 11- 20-19, AMD.docx

   in the STRONG STAR Database, reported to the IRB (the SOP describes the BAMC 
IRB, but this protocol will report to the UTHSCSA and VA IRBs), and included in annual reports to the funder.  
10.3.5 Monitoring 
Monitoring of study data and protocol deviations is described in Appendix V and as outlined in the Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) for this study .  The Study 
Coordinator  is responsible for updating the STRONG STAR Regulatory Coordinator  
about all protocol deviations.  The Regulatory Coordinator will ensure that the IRB, PI, and funder are aware of deviations through regular reporting mechanisms (e.g., Progress Reports, Pr ogress Reviews, ad hoc meetings) and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_425366].  The Study Coordinator will review all study charts 
within 3 business days of assessment and once a week during intervention phase to identify any noted deviations (notated in the chart by [CONTACT_425447] V and W ). 
11. PARTICIPANT  RIGHTS AND CONFIDENTIALITY  
11.[ADDRESS_537604] (IRB) Review   
This protocol and the informed consent document ( Appendix D ) and any subsequent 
modifications will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_109753]. The consent form should be separate from the protocol document.  Regulatory review will occur through the UTHSCSA/VA IRB (of which the PI [INVESTIGATOR_425367]) and the VA R&D Committee (see Appendix X ). 
11.2 Informed Consent Forms 
A signed consent form will be obtained from each participant. For participants who 
cannot consent for themselves, such as those with a legal  guardian (e.g. person with 
power of attorney ), this individual  must sign the consent form . The consent form will 
describe the purpose of the study, the procedures to be followed, and the risks and 
benefits of participation . A copy will be given to each participant or legal guardian 
and this fact will be documented in the participant’s record.  
11.[ADDRESS_537605] 
the site will be identified only by a participant identification number (Participant ID, PID) to maintain confidentiality. All records will be kept in a locked file cabinet  at 
the VA PRC.  Data will be entered into the secure STRONG STAR Database from the VA. All computer entry and networking programs will be done using PI[INVESTIGATOR_34107]. 
Information will not be released without written permission of the participant, except 
as necessary for m onitoring by [CONTACT_1744], the FDA, the NCCIH, and the  OHRP . 
11.4 Study Discontinuation  
The study may be discontinued at any time by [CONTACT_1201], the NCCIH, the OHRP, the

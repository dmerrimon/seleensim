Title  Neuroinflammatory Mechanisms Linking Chronic Stress to 
Motivational Deficits  
Study Description  Motivational deficits such as anhedonia are core to several 
psychiatric disorders and underlie significant functional 
impairment. This double -blind, placebo -controlled crossover trial of 
minocycline, an anti -[neuro]inflammatory agent, examines links 
between chronic stress and responses to a reward -related 
motivation task. It will evaluate the effects of pharmacologically 
attenuating neuro inflammation on behavioral responses to a 
reward -related motivation task in individuals experiencing 
unemployment. Understanding the effects of neuroinflammation on 
reward function among individuals experiencing chronic stress 
represents a critical first s tep in identifying novel neuroimmune 
targets for future clinical trials.

Template  Version   1.0            2021 -09-09 2. Introduction : Background and Rationale  
2.1.  Background Information  
Motivational deficits such as anhedonia are common to several psychiatric conditions, including 
depression1 and schizophrenia 2. Moreover, these deficits are notoriously difficult to treat and predict 
poorer treatment response 3, greater chronicity of illness 4, significant functional impairment 2, and 
suicidality 5. The lack of efficacy for improving motivational deficits in current psychiatric treatments is 
mainly due to a lack of understanding of the mechanisms that give rise to these transdiagnostic sym ptoms. 
One significant risk factor that promotes decreases in motivation is chronic stress 6. In fact, many preclinical 
models of anhedonia rely on chronic stress paradigms to induce reductions in motivation and elicit 
depression -like symptoms 7. This preclinical work has demonstrated that a critical pathophysiological 
model linking chronic stress to deficits in motivation is via neuroinflammatory processes 8. Considering  
these findings, there is a paucity of work examining the mechanisms linking stress, ne uroinflammation, 
and the neurobehavioral underpi[INVESTIGATOR_592629]. Translational research aiming to replicate 
and extend preclinical research in a clinical sample is critical for elucidating the brain mechanisms 
underlying the reward -related m otivational deficits implicated across several disorders. Thus, this project 
incorporates an experimental therapeutics approach and computational neuroscience techniques to 
generate information about the neuroinflammatory mechanisms contributing to stress -related motivational 
deficits. This mechanistic clinical trial will utilize minocycline to reduce inflammation in the brain in a sample 
of chronically stressed individuals to examine molecular to neural  alterations implicated in motivational 
deficits. Results from the proposed study will shed light on neuroimmune targets for future prevention and 
intervention efforts.  
Evidence linking chronic stress to anhedonia via neuroinflammatory processes.  Although less work 
has examined the effects of stress on anhedonia in humans, evidence across rodents and humans 
converges to suggest that chronic stressors contribute to the development of  motivational deficits and a 
lack of responsiveness to rewards6,9. In rodents, chronic stress causes anhedonia -like behavioral 
changes10 (e.g., prolonged immobility, reduced preference for sweetness, and reduced exploratory 
activity) ; and in  humans, acute and chronic stressors are associated with motivational deficits (e .g., motor 
slowing 11, reductions in pleasure12, and reduced ability for participants’ to modulate behavior as a function 
of rewards 13,14) as well. Additionally, several  studies have found that stress -induced  remodeling occurs in 
the corticostriatal circuit (i.e., medial prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia) to attenuate the reward -seeking and 
goal-directed behaviors involved in motivation15–18. However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_592630], more research is needed to understand the str ess-induced molecular mechanisms 
driving corticostriatal alterations in humans.  
While multiple neurobiological pathways are likely relevant for understanding the influence of chronic 
stress on motivational processes,  preclinical work identifies neuroinflammation as a key  molecular 
mechanism underlying anhedonia. Indeed, chronic stress leads to changes in the central nervous system 
(CNS ) innate immune cells19, including  microglia, astrocytes, and other CNS -infiltrating macrophages. As 
the brain ’s resident immune cells, microglia are studied as markers of neuroinflammation20,[ADDRESS_781695] 
infectious and stress derived -agents as well as  purging damaged or unnecessary neurons and synapses19. 
Consequently, chronic stressors c an damage the CNS by [CONTACT_592656], 
ultimately giving rise to a maladaptive brain immune response22,23.  
The clinical work examining the role of neuroinflammatory processes underlying anhedonia is in its 
infancy. Hence, an understanding of the neuroinflammatory disruptions to network functioning and 
communication that may contribute to anhedonia in humans is severely lacking. Nevertheless, there is 
Minocycline & Stress  Study    Version 3.[ADDRESS_781696] found that 
neuroinflammation is elevated in patients with depression and sch izophrenia 24–30. While these studies 
provide a critical first step in demonstrating the association between neuroinflammation and motivational 
deficits in patient populations, studies that examine the links between precursors and consequences of 
neuroinflammation in these living patient populations are necessary . 
Although a link between chronic stress and microglia has been established, what lacks understanding 
is the relationship between alterations in these neuroimmune cells and neural functioning relevant to 
motivated behavior in humans. In other words, how exac tly does chronic stress engender motivational 
deficits through alterations in neuroinflammatory processes? Limited preclinical evidence demonstrates 
that alterations in microglial cell function due to chronic stress may be associated with structural and 
functional changes in the brain [ADDRESS_781697] relevant to the current 
proposal, experimental evidence in rodents document  that neuroinflammatory processes driven by 
[CONTACT_592657] -to-glia communication 34–36, 
neurogenesis 37–39, neuroplasticity 40–43, long term potentiation 44, and neurotransmitter systems 45–47. For 
instance, microglia l activation has been associated with the selective degeneration of dopami ne-producing 
nerve cells 48. This is interesting considering that dopamine  has been implicated as a critical mediator 
between neuroinflammation and social behavior 49. Certainly, microglia produce disturbances in striatal 
dopamine function and reward -related behavior 50–52. These findings indicate that more clarity regarding 
the neuroimmune to neuron interface can be critical for understanding the neurobiology of motivational 
deficits. A clinical extension of this work, then, should examine how altering lev els of neuroinflammation in 
humans may influence corticostriatal activity while engaging in a motivation task . 
What is minocycline?  Because neuroinflammation, especially microglia, is implicated in anhedonia, 
pharmacological strategies to suppress microglial activity or blunt neuroinflammatory processes have been 
explored as therapi[INVESTIGATOR_592631]. One such treatment  is minocycline , a tetracycline 
antibiotic commonly used to study neuroinflammatory mechanisms in preclinical work 53–56. Specifically, 
minocycline has been found to attenuate neuroinflammation’s d eleterious effects on neurogenesis 57, long -
term potentiation 58, and neuronal survival 59. Minocycline’s ant i-inflammatory mechanism of action is 
thought to involve an ability to inhibit microglia functioning 53,54. Unlike most anti -inflammatory agents, 
minocycline’s lipid -solubility allows for its penetration into the CNS 60. Indeed, minocycline has been shown 
to only reduce pro -inflammatory levels of the cytokine IL -1β in the brain and not plasma levels of the same 
cytokine in the periphery 61, validating that minocycline specifically alters neuroinflammatory processes. 
This relationship was further substantiat ed in a mechanistic study, which showed that minocycline reduced 
experimentally induced neuroinflammation and anhedonia -like behaviors in rodents by [CONTACT_592658] 61. The authors  also reported that minocycline consistently attenuated the microglial expression 
of pro -inflammatory response genes across four independent experiments. Although minocycline trials in 
clinical samples are significantly limited, there is some evidence that  minocycline also attenuates microglial 
functioning in human s62 and has been shown to reduce negative symptoms scores (including anhedonia) 
among individuals with schizophrenia 63,64. Thus, minocycline would be a candidate drug to map 
neuroinflammatory effects on neural functioning. The proposed minocycline mechanistic trial would be an 
initial yet necessary step in understanding the molecular and neural  alterations underlying motivational 
deficits. The results obtained here may have implications for identifying the circuit elements that can be 
modulated to reverse or compensate for neuroinflammation induced alterations.  Notably, while minocycline 
has been used in the preclinical  literature to study mechanisms involved in neuroinflammation, there are 
several other biological actions that minocycline can exert, including anti -apoptotic and antioxidant 
properties65. 
Unemployment as a translational model of chronic stress.  Conceptualizing unemployment  stress as a 
translational examination of chronic stress can help to bridge preclinical and clinical understandings of 
Minocycline & Stress  Study    Version 3.[ADDRESS_781698] been pi[INVESTIGATOR_592632] -related dysregulation underlying anhedonia, depression, and general 
psychophysiological health. Because these stress paradigms are unethical to admi nister to clinical 
samples, the reproducibility and translation of preclinical work in this area limit the findings’ external validity. 
However, unemployment  stress is a natural, ecologically valid model of chronic unpredictable stress such 
that unemployme nt stress  can beget psychological distress over extended periods66,67, increase exposure 
to unpredictable and uncontrollable  events68,69, and has been linked with long -term physiological effects70-
73. Additionally, unemployment stress has been associated with alterations in immune functioning such 
that those experiencing longer durations of unemployment are more likely to exhibit higher levels of 
immune system activation74. For example, i n one study, those experiencing unemploymen t were five times 
more likely to have elevated levels of inflammation75. 
Summary and Significance of the Proposal.  This proposal seeks to conduct translational work that 
extends rich preclinical findings to the clinical domain to validate whether neuroinflammatory dysregulation 
is strongly tied to anhedonia. This project addresses critical gaps in the scientific literature by [CONTACT_30224] a 
chronically stressed sample of individuals —employment seeking individuals who report significant stress -
- and will use an experimental therapeutics approach to attenuate neuroinflammation and a ssess neural 
activity underlying motivational deficits.  
2.2.  Scientific Rationale  
One major obstacle in understanding how neuroinflammation influences human corticostriatal activity 
involves technological challenges such that conventional approaches are invasive, expensive, and/or 
lacking specificity. Although static levels of neuroinfl ammation in humans have been measured, capturing 
neural dynamics during behavioral tasks has been difficult to image in vivo. This obstacle limits the ability 
to develop a more precise understanding of how neuroinflammation causes circuit -level dysregulati on in 
humans. The proposed project will employ a mechanistic clinical trial of the anti -[neuro]inflammatory agent, 
minocycline, to address these limitations. In animal models, minocycline has attenuated the deleterious 
effects of neuroinflammation on neurogenesis, long -term potentiation, and neuronal survival. This study 
will extend research to humans  to examine whether links between neuroinflammation and neural 
responses to a reward -related motivation task differ  among chronically stressed individuals taki ng 
minocycline and the placebo control. The proposed project will provide the first evidence of neural 
alterations that have relevance for motivational deficits due to neuroinflammation .  
 
3. Specific Aims  
 
Aim 1:  To examine differences in performance on a pure motivation task following minocycline (vs 
placebo). We hypothesize that objective performance on a motivation task will be better when individuals 
are taking minocycline compared to performance after taking placebo.  
Aim 2:  To examine differences in performance on a task measuring the influence of motivation on 
cognitive performance following minocycline (vs placebo). We hypothesize that objective cognitive 
performance will be better after individuals are taking minocycline compared to performance after taking 
placebo.

Template  Version   1.0            2021 -09-09 4. Investigational Plan  
Study Design:  This study is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, crossover trial.  
Brief overview of study events:  Potential participants will complete eligibility screening for the study. 
Participants meeting eligibility criteria will take a 5-day course of minocycline (or placebo) and then 
complete a reward processing task.  They will also complete a self-reported motivational deficits scale  
(i.e., Snaith Hamilton Pleasure scale76). Participants  will then complete a 14-day washout period before 
beginning the other arm of the trial. Again, participants will complete a 5-day course and then complete a 
reward processing task  as well as the Snaith  Hamilton Pleasure scale . Participants will be monitored for 
any adverse events throughout study participation. See Figure 1 for visualization of study procedures.  
 
Study Duration:  12 months  
Target Number of Participants:  54 chronically stressed individuals  
Minocycline Dosage:  A 200mg/day dosage was selected based on prior studies examining the efficacy 
of minocycline for psychiatric symptoms 78-82. As described in the prescribing information leaflet (see 
Appendix 1), the serum half -life in normal participants ranged from 11 -22 hours (M=15.5 hours).  It takes 
4 days for minocycline to achieve a steady  state and approximately 4 days for it to be eliminated . 
Because a 5 -day course of 200 mg/day dose has been found to have neuroprotective effects in response 
to brain injury  (i.e., stroke)83-86, we plan to assess whether a similar [ADDRESS_781699] that the washout period is sufficiently long to eliminate the potential for 
carryover effects , we assume that there will be no carryover effects with our design.  
Timing of Visits:  Participants will first complete a screening session for assessing inclusion/exclusion 
eligibility and can occur at -30 to -1 days. At day 0, participants will complete a baseline onboarding visit 
(~1.5 hr) and receive the first arm 1 of intervention. The 5 -day course of minocycline (or placebo 
depending on randomization)  will begin between day 1 and up to day 30 of enrollment. This will be 
decided based on participant availability. Behavioral  session 1 will be scheduled 6 days after beginning 
the treatment  (~day 6 to day 36). This session is approximately 1.5 hours and  participants will receive 
the second treatment during this visit. Following the visit, a 2-week washout period will commence. The 
second behavioral visit will determine when the second treatment will begin and will not occur any earlier 
than 20 days after behavioral session 1. This 20+ day window accounts for 2 weeks of washout and 5 
days of the second treatment.  The 5-day course of placebo (or minocycline depending on 
randomization)  can begi n as early as day 26 or as late as is needed. Behavioral  session 2 will be 
scheduled to occur 6 days after beginning the second treatment  (day 32 or later). After the second visit, 
participants will be debriefed and receive the remaining payment.  The m inimum enrollment period for 
participants  is 32 days.

A total of N = [ADDRESS_781701]  n = [ADDRESS_781702] complete data.   
5.2.  Eligibility  Criteria  
The following criteria were selected to minimize confounding effects and optimize signal detection  for 
effects of chronic stress  in this preliminary study. Individuals will be excluded from the study if they 
endorse any of the following, which are known to influence inflammation 87 or interfere/confound with 
minocycline effects 88: regular nicotine or recreational drug use; neurological conditions (e.g., history of 
stroke, TBI);  chronic diseases or infections that significantly impact inflammatory markers ( i.e., diabetes, 
cardiovascular diseases, high blood pressure, inflammatory bowel diseases,  autoimmune disease ); 
known allergies or hypersensitivities to tetracycline antibiotics, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_162882]; antibiotics; 
regular use of steroidal or non -steroidal anti -inflammatory medications; and have any liver or kidney 
problems. Individuals will also be excluded if  they are pregnant or breastfeeding or meet diagnostic 
criteria for  a severe mental illness (i.e., disorders evincing psychotic symptoms, severe major 
depression, bipolar disorder) . Finally, adults aged 25-60 will be eligible to participate.  
 
Several decisions regarding the stress and unemployment inclusion criteria were defined based on a 
prior study that examined links between inflammation and neural activity among a chronically stressed 
sample of unemployed individuals92. For that study, researchers included participants who were:  
• Unemployed (working less than 20 hours per week)  
• Seeking employment  
• Having trouble finding job  
• Stressed:  greater than [ADDRESS_781703] six months to be considered a chronic stressor.   
 
 5.2.1. ￼Inclusion Criteria   
 
In order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet all of the following criteria:  
• 25-60 years old  
• Unemployed (working less than 20 hours per week)  
• Seeking employment  
• Having trouble finding job (i.e., actively seeking and applying for jobs but not successful in 
landing a job)  
• Reports greater than 5 points on Job Stress Items  
• Regular access to a mobile phone   
 
Having trouble finding a job includes actively seeking jobs and not being  successful. Active search 
methods are defined as those that have the potential to result in a job offer without any further action on 
the part of the job seeker. Examples of active job search methods include:  
• contact[CONTACT_592659] a job  
• having a job interview  
• submitting a resume or application to an employer or to a job website

with participants during visits  will know whether a participant is on placebo or minocycline . After data 
collection for the study is completed, the pharmacist who made order assignments will reveal when  
participants were in the minocycline vs. placebo  phase  so appropriate analys es can be conducted.

Participants  will be recruited via online registries of research studies at UNC (e.g., Join the Conquest; 
emails to UNC staff listservs), flyers posted in the Chapel Hill, Durham, and Raleigh communities (e.g., 
community centers, grocery stores), targeted ads on socia l media (e.g., Facebook), and ads on buses 
and in local publications. To ensure participation from individuals  experiencing stress due to 
unemployment , we will offer vouchers to cover transportation to UNC for the study session, free on -site

After completing the prescreen questions, participants will then be screened via telephone by a trained 
research assistant in the lab to assess whether they meet additional eligibility requirements. On this call, 
participants will be asked about exclusion criteria including :  
• Currently enrolled as a student  
• Prescribed medication for the following physical illnesses: diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, high 
blood pressure, autoimmune disease, neurological conditions (e.g., TBI, stroke)  
• Diagnosis of a severe mental illness (i.e., disorders evincing psychotic symptoms, severe major

• Current antibiotic use  
• Regular use of steroidal or non -steroidal anti -inflammatory medications (i.e., 2 or more times a 
week)  
 
Additionally, a Mini -International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.)[ADDRESS_781706]. If the participant responds positively to 
any of the screening prompts, follow -up questions will be asked to assess the possibili ty of a diagnosis. 
Participants who  meet eligibility for severe mental illnesses will be excluded.  
 
If eligible, participants will learn more information about the study and be asked  whether they would be 
interested in participating. If so, they will  be scheduled for all the following  study  visits.  
 
Eligible participants will be scheduled for the Baseline in -person visit. There , the informed consent 
process will begin,  and confirmatory tests/evaluations will be performed to verify eligibility criteria. During 
this visit:  
 
• The study coordinator will review the  consent forms  and answer any questions the participant 
may have  
• Participant will be given time to review materials and  then sign the consent form 
• Participants will meet with the study physician to complete a brief health screening, collect vital 
signs information, and to carefully discuss the  risks/benefits of participating in the study  
• Complete questionnaires  about employment stress and  their levels of motivation  
• Begin enrollment procedures outlined below  
• Participant will be thanked for their time and reminded of their next in-person appointment    
 
The names, phone numbers and emails of participants who do not meet eligibility criteria or who decline 
participation will be retained on a secure password protected network for the study term (5 years) to 
ensure that the same participant is not contact[CONTACT_291941]. All other 
identifiable information about these individua ls will be deleted as soon as they decline participation.

anhedonia, stress, and an assessment of medication adherence. Finally, participants will be given the next 
course of medication in preparation for behavioral visit 2.  
 
The following measures will be collected  at study visit s 1 and 2 : 
• Resting Heart Rate Variability  (HRV) will be collected for [ADDRESS_781708] autonomic nervous system reactivity . 
• The Snaith –Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS)  is a tool to assess symptoms of reduced motivation. 
The SHAPS uses 14 questions, each rated on a Likert scale of 1 -4. The total score on the scale 
ranges from 14 -56, with lower scores reflecting lower motivation. Scores will be compared across 
conditions to determine whether motivation changes in the minocycline condition as compared to 
the placebo.  
• The Motivation and Pleasure Scale (MAP)  will be used to capture self -reported aspects of reduced 
motivation. The scale uses 18 questions, each rated on a Likert scale of 0 -4. The total score on the 
scale ranges from 0 -72, with lower scores reflecting lower motivation. Scores will be compared 
across conditions to determine whether motivation changes in the minocycline condition as 
compared to the placebo.  
• Job Seeking Stress Items as discussed in section 6.2 . 
• Given that unemployment is linked to greater levels of stress generally, participants will also 
complete the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)96. The PSS is the most commonly used  and well -
validated measure of stress.  The PSS is a [ADDRESS_781709] 
experienced irritations or lack of control in one’s life. Participants completing the PSS will be 
instructed to respond based on their experiences since the last visit.  
• The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ -9)[ADDRESS_781710] visit.  Scores on this scale will be used to assess 
whether Aims 1 and 2 are moderated by [CONTACT_592664]. This scale will also be used to assess 
the safety of each participant. See section 10 for more information  about safety plans.  
• A trained research assistant will administer a Dried Blood Spot (DBS)  test. To complete this test , 
participants' skin will be punctured with a single -use safety lancet, which is the same procedure 
diabetic individuals use on a daily basis. This may be momentarily uncomfortable or painful for 
some participants, but we e xpect that it will be a mild experience.  
• The Health Information Form  is used to assess current medications, illness, or other covariates that 
could affect inflammation and thereby [INVESTIGATOR_554712].

Template  Version   1.0            2021 -09-09 • Participants will be verbally instructed on the Progressive Reward Task  and able to follow along 
with written instructions. They will be informed that the goal of the task is to win as much money as 
possible by [CONTACT_592665] a short versus long mouth on a cartoon face. 
Further, they are informed that n ot all correct responses will receive reward feedback. They will 
then complete a brief practice trial. Each trial of the task begins with a fixation cross in the center 
of the screen for 500 ms. Then, a mouthless cartoon face will be presented. With a 500 ms delay, 
either a short mouth (11.5 mm) or a long mouth (13 mm) is presented on the face for [ADDRESS_781711] the study physician to report whether the 
participants reported any AEs.  
 
6.5. Final  Debriefing  Visit 
 
After completing both randomized conditions, participants will be asked to stay for a 30 -minute debriefing 
session with the study coordinator. During this visit, participants will be unblinded, learn more about the 
purpose of the study (i.e., links between stress, inflammation, and motivation), have any concerns or 
questions participa nts may have about the study answered and addressed. Participants will also receive 
final compensation for participation in the study during this time.  
6.6. Phone Contacts  
Considering the complexity of activities, there will be frequent communication by [CONTACT_592666].  
 
• Study visit reminders will be sent once a day starting 2 days before the study visit  via text 
messaging . 
• Medication reminders will be sent once a day, during the medication period, at the participant’s 
earliest mealtime (e.g., breakfast, lunch). If participants elect to be reminded at their next 
mealtime , they will be texted 4 hours later.   
• To verify that participants have taken the medication, participants will be called each evening to 
ask about compliance and if they experienced any adverse events.  
 
6.7. Assessing Medication Compliance  
During the enrollment visits, participants will be asked what time of the day would be best to contact 
[CONTACT_592667] -ins when the medication period begins . Participants will be given the 
option to receive daily reminder texts to take the medication and can confirm taking them in response to 
that text. Whether participants indicate evening, morning, or afternoon, all participants will be contact[CONTACT_592668]. If a participant is unable to answer or call us back within 24 hours, it will be marked in a log for 
follow -up on the following  visit. The following daily calls will proceed until the visit. To compensate 
participants for their time completing the daily check -ins, they will be entered in a raffle to win an extra 
prize at the end of the study.  
Minocycline & Stress  Study    Version 3.[ADDRESS_781712] . The questionnaire 
prompt will state “Taking pi[INVESTIGATOR_592638] a lot of people. It is not uncommon for people to miss doses 
from time to time. These items/questions ask you about doses you took and doses you missed. Please 
try to remember as best you c an what actually happened and not what you intended to have happen or 
what you  think that other people want you to report. By [CONTACT_592669], you are 
making a big contribution to this research.”   
Participants will be asked to return the pi[INVESTIGATOR_592639]. The extra pi[INVESTIGATOR_592640]. Together, the pi[INVESTIGATOR_73586], questionnaire responses, and daily check -ins will 
be used to assess medication ad herence.  
7. Statistical Analysis Plans  
 
Statistical procedures will be performed in R . The study  was designed  to reduce  the possibility  of period,  
carryover,  and sequence  effects  and we assume  that these  effects  will not occur  with this data.  
Specifically,  we will employ  a blocked  randomized  design  to prevent  period  and sequence  effects  and 
allow  for the opportunity  to observe  if the effects  will occur.  Additionally,  we have  extended  our washout  
period  to decrease  the possibility  of carryover  effects.   
Aim 1: To examine differences in performance on a pure motivation task following minocycline (vs 
placebo).  
Aim 1 analysis plan: A paired samples t -test will be conducted to assess whether taking minocycline was 
associated with a change in response bias  on the PRT as compared to when participants are taking a 
placebo.  
Aim 2: To examine differences on self -report measures of motivation following minocycline (vs placebo).  
Aim 2 analysis plan: A paired samples t -test will be conducted to assess whether taking minocycline was 
associated with a change in SHAPS scores as compared to when participants are taking a placebo. 
Another paired samples t -test will be conducted to asses s whether taking minocycline was associated 
with a change in MAPS scores as compared to when participants are taking a placebo.  
 
8. Sample Size Rationale  
We conducted a power analysis to determine the appropriate sample  size for this study. Although a prior 
study exploring the effects of minocycline on a memory task demonstrated a large effect size (Berens et 
al., 2020), we conducted a power analysis that assumed a small -medium effect size given that 
associations with ou r task types have not been explored in the literature before. Power analyses were 
conducted assuming a small -medium effect size Dz of 0.[ADDRESS_781713] size of Dz=0.[ADDRESS_781714] and an alpha of .05, we would need 52 participants to achieve 80% power. As 
such, we aim to recruit 54 participants to account for any potential issues with participant retention.   
9. Data Collection and  Management  
 
Questionnaire and Symptom  Data  Collection : Research material obtained from all of participants will 
include self -report data  and responses on behavioral tasks. These assessments will be conducted via in -
Minocycline & Stress  Study    Version 3.[ADDRESS_781715] in digital form on computer disk and on secure 
servers at UNC.  
 
Data Quality and Monitoring: All data are collected by [CONTACT_592670]'s -level or Master’s level study staff . 
Data quality and safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_592671]. Any issues will be 
discussed with the PI , and as needed, the scientific advisory team. The study PI  [INVESTIGATOR_592641], as well as ensuring any 
changes to the protocol have received IRB approval and have been reported to the spon sor, and that 
accurate, complete, and timely reports are made to the IRB. A weekly study team meeting will be conducted 
to discuss research procedures.   
• All identifiable  data will be recorded in the database using alphanumeric identifiers that are unrelated 
to any personal identifying information about the participant.  All participant data are coded by [CONTACT_592672] -protected secure servers of which only the research team has access .   
• All sources of electronic data  (i.e., computerized symptom data collected via UNC Qualtrics) are 
saved on a password -protected file on a secure UNC server,  to which only the research team 
members will have access.   
• All sources of non -electronic research data  will be coded by a unique subject number and stored in 
a dedicated locked file cabinet. Materials identifying participants by [CONTACT_2300] (e.g., signed consent 
forms) will be stored in a separate locked file cabinet. The computer file matching participant names 
with code numbers will be saved in a double password -protected file on a secure UNC server 
directory only accessible by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_592642]. All data will be entered into the dataset 
using the subject ide ntification number only. Participants are not identified by [CONTACT_592673], or any presentation or publication resulting from the analysis of these data.  
10. Safety Monitoring and Management  
10.1. Risk / Benefit Assessment  
Potential Risks:  
• Minocycline: The most common side effects are gastrointestinal (i.e., nausea) and mild central 
nervous system effects (e.g., vertigo, light -headedness). Like other tetracycline -class antibiotics, 
minocycline may cause fetal harm when administered to pregna nt women. Pregnant woman 
(measured by [CONTACT_6270] -report  during prescreen ) will be excluded from participation due to the potential 
risks of minocycline to a fetus . The use of minocycline during pregnancy may affect tooth 
development and cause permanent discoloration of teeth. If any tetracycline is used during 
pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, the participant will be 
apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Most adverse effects occur early after administration 
and disappear when the medication is discontinued.  Participants will also be advised to use a 
second method of contraception as minocycline may increase the chances of an unintended 
pregnancy.  
• Questionnaires / Behavioral Measurements: There are minimal risks involved in the collection of 
questionnaires and behavioral data. Although it is unlikely, it is possible that participants may 
become bored or frustrated by [CONTACT_592674]. Individual s may become distressed while 
reporting on difficult emotional experiences.  
 
Potential Benefits: Beyond monetary compensation for participation, there are no direct benefits to 
individuals for participating in the study. However, participants may derive satisfaction, knowing that 
their participation may help advance knowledge about chronic stress -related neuroinflammation. The

Template  Version   1.0            2021 -09-09 proposed study is similar to other experiments conducted in the lab. The adverse experiences (e.g., 
droppi[INVESTIGATOR_530159] a study due to discomfort with study procedures) have been minor and rare. Thus, we 
maintain that participants’ risks are minimal and less t han the benefit they gain from participating in 
the study.  
10.2. Safety Monitoring  
Personnel:  The present study does not raise any obvious health concern issues. Nonetheless, during 
the course of individual study sessions with participants, researchers will frequently verbally check in with 
participants to make sure they are comfortable and not exp eriencing any physical or psychological 
discomfort. Participants can withdraw participation at any point in the study.  All research staff will be 
trained on recognizing and reporting adverse events prior to engaging in research activity. If a se rious, 
unexpected adverse event occurs, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_592643]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_592644]. Any subsequent action will be 
documented and reported to the UNC IRB.  All study team personnel will obtain research training 
certification before working in the lab as required by [CONTACT_4289]. Confidentiality will be protected to the fullest 
extent permitted by [CONTACT_2371]. All research personnel will have completed CITI training and HIPPA training for 
researchers. Consent forms will be stored in locked file cabinets only accessible to those on the study 
team. Computerized data (behavioral task data and  questionnaire data entered into the computer) will be 
stored on secured, password -protected servers behind a UNC -Chapel Hill and lab -specific firewall.  
Minocycline:  The 200mg  dose  of minocycline  to be given  in this study  is expected  to be well-tolerated  in 
this young,  healthy  population.  The greatest  risk to participants  taking  this medication  is allergic  reaction,  
and we will assess  all medication  allergies  prior to study  enrollment.  Minocycline  rarely  causes  side 
effects,  especially  when  used  for a short  duration  like this study.  However,  like with most  antibiotics,  
participants  will be counseled  about  the possibility  of diarrhea  and gastrointe stinal  upset  as well as signs  
of an allergic  reaction . They  will also be alerted  to the possibility  of photosensitivity  and be encouraged  to 
wear  sunscreen.  The study physician will be on -call to assess any side effects and direct appropriate 
management as needed. If a participant begins to notice signs of an allergic reaction when taking the 
medication at home (e.g., difficulty breathing, swelling) they will be advised to call [ADDRESS_781716] will fo llow-up to assess the participants wellbeing and treatment plan.  Participants will be

minocycline. During the daily calls, participants will be asked about an y symptoms of  allergy, 
gastrointestinal upset such as nausea and diarrhea, as well as any feelings of dizziness or fatigue.  
Questionnaires / Behavioral Measurements:  To minimize the risk of a participant becoming 
uncomfortable, the study team will make every effort to maintain a personally supportive relationship with 
each participant. Participants will be informed at the start of the study what to expect and how long the 
study visit will be. All data will be coded with identification numbers and will not contain personally 
identifying information.  
Protocol for Assessing the Emergence of Severe Depression or Suicidality:  Participants will be 
recruited to be at low risk for severe depression and suicide attempt following the baseline assessments 
with the study psychiatrist . However, the PHQ -997 will be administered at all study visits to track risk for 
psychological crises. If a participant screens positive to question 9 on the questionnaire, selecting 
anything other than zero for the item “ Thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting  yourself in 
some way ”, the study psychiatrist will assess suicide risk with the Ask Suicide -Screening Questions 
(ASQ).  See Appendix [ADDRESS_781717] identifies potential positive risk, the y will be 
offered information for immediate cris is services including Orange County mobile crisis units and the 
Emergency Department. The same resources will be shared with participants who score higher than 15 
on the PHQ -9, indicating severe depression.

10.3. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events Reporting Procedure  
An adverse event (AE)  is generally defined as any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, 
symptom, sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), syndrome or disease which either 
occurs during the study, having been absent at baseline, or if present at baseline, appears to 
wors en. Adverse events are to be recorded  regardless of their relationship to the study 
intervention.   
A serious adverse event (SAE)  is generally defined as any untoward medical occurrence 
that results in death, is life threatening, requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4967], results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is a 
congenital anomaly.  
The most common side effects from this medicine are gastrointestinal symptoms, dizziness 
and fatigue . Minocycline may increase sensitivity to sunlight, resulting in more frequent 
sunburns or the development of rashes following sun exposure. We will  recommend that 
patients apply sunscreen (SPF 15 or greater) before outdoor activities or avoid prolonged 
exposure to the sun while taking minocycline. Minocycline -associated SAEs  are very rare, 
and the number needed to cause one additional case has been estimated at 1/11,[ADDRESS_781718] the event, severity, the start and end date of the 
event, the relationship to the study (e.g., whether related or unrelated to the study 
procedures) and the final outcome. Data will be collected using a form (see Appendix 2 for 
examples). The study physician will be consulted when events are unexpected and/or of 
greater than mild severity. The study physician will speak to the participant within [ADDRESS_781719] course of action.  If deemed 
necessary, the physician will refer the participant to a follow -up. The occurrence of adverse 
events will be immediately reported by [CONTACT_464] (i.e., study coordinator, graduate student 
research assistants, research nurses at the CTRC) to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_83618]. The PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_592645] C Office of Human Research Ethics (OHRE). 
OHRE standard operating procedures specify that the PI [INVESTIGATOR_592646] (i.e., New Safety Information) 
to OHRE within seven calendar days of the investigator becoming aware of the information. 
New Safety Information is communicated to OHRE through the online IRB management 
system, IRBIS. Reports to the IRBIS will include Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Events, 
and Unanticipated Problems . 
The following grading scale will be used to  identify the intensity of an Adverse Event:  
• Mild: Awareness of a sign or symptom that does not interfere with the participants 
usual activity or is transient, resolved without treatment and with no sequelae;  
• Moderate: Interferes with the participants usual activity, but the patient is still able to 
function;  
• Severe: Events that interrupt a patient ’s usual daily activity and generally require a 
systemic drug therapy or other treatment.  
All AEs/SAEs will be evaluated as to its expected occurrence, or lack of expected occurrence:  
• Expected: An adverse event is expected when the specificity and severity of the event 
is consistent with the study procedures and Standard of Care, (e.g., the participant 
fainted in response to having his blood drawn) or underlying disease state, (the 
participant’s depressive symptoms worsened).

Template  Version   1.0            2021 -09-09 • Unexpected: An adverse event is unexpected when the specificity or severity of an 
adverse event is not consistent with the study procedures or Standards of Care, (e.g., 
the phlebotomist used the same blood collection needle on multiple participants, 
result ing in a participant acquiring Hepatitis C), or underlying disease state (e.g., the 
participant experienced a manic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1863]). Unexpected,  as defined 
above,  refers to an adverse event that has not been observed before.  
The following conditions will be used to define the relatedness of any study procedure to an 
AE/SAE.  
• Not related: The PI [INVESTIGATOR_592647].  
• Possible: The PI [INVESTIGATOR_592648] a reasonable relationship 
to the study procedures.  
• Probable: The PI [INVESTIGATOR_592649] a reasonable 
relationship to the study procedures. Definite: The PI [INVESTIGATOR_592650].  
• Unknown: The PI [INVESTIGATOR_592651].  
The clinical outcome of the AE/SAE will be characterized as follows:  
• Recovered/Resolved: The patient recovered from the AE/SAE.  
• Not Recovered/Not resolved: Patient did not recover,  and symptoms continue.  
• Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae: The patient has recovered but with clinical 
sequelae from the event.  
• Fatal: The event resulted in death. The SAE, Death, and Exit forms must be 
completed for this outcome.  
• Unknown: The clinical outcome of the patient remains unknown at the time of the 
report,  or the patient was lost to follow -up.  
All AEs/SAEs will be followed until resolution or until the end of participation in the protocol. 
Participants may report A Es freely or in response to general questioning or through patient or 
clinician assessments. If it is determined that an AE has occurred, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_10718].

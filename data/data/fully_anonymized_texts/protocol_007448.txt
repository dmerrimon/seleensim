CONFIDENTIAL Background and Rationale 
HLH and rationale for targeting Interferon gamma (IFN )  
HLH is a syndrome of severe immune activation and deregulation characterized by [CONTACT_207021], pro-inflammatory cytokine hypersecretion, hemophagocytosis, 
and tissue and organs damage. HLH occurs as either a primary (pHLH, familial) or secondary 
(sHLH, sporadic) disorder (Henter et al., 1998; Janka, 1983).  
Primary HLH is an autosomal recessive disease with an incidence of 1/50,000 live-born children 
(Henter et al. 1991; Arico et al. 1996). pHLH typi[INVESTIGATOR_207015] a positive family history. It is caused by [CONTACT_207022], Munc13-4, Syntaxin 11, Munc18-2 and other proteins involved in cytotoxic granule 
activation, polarization, priming, fusion, or function  (Jordan et al., 2011; Zhang et al.,  2014). 
These mutations result in impaired cytotoxic function, and lead to an uncontrolled inflammatory 
response with activation of histiocytes, and pathognomic clinical manifestations of HLH.  
Secondary HLH has been generally reported to occur as a result of pathological immune 
activation in response to a trigger, in the absence of homozygous mutations in known HLH 
causative genes. It can occur in children or adults, typi[INVESTIGATOR_94954] a setting of malignancies, 
infections or autoimmune disorders (Dhote et al., 2003; Rouphael et al., 2007; Li et al., 2014; 
Rivière et al., 2014). 
In recent years, an apparent inexplicable rise in the reported cases of HLH has been observed 
especially in the adult population, although the incidence of HLH in adults is still unknown 
(Schram and Berliner, 2015).     
Case series from the [LOCATION_002] (Parikh et al., 2014), [LOCATION_009] (Rivière et al., 2014), Japan 
(Takahashi N et al., 2001) and China (Li et al., 2014) all reported that the majority of adult 
patients had a malignancy (commonly non-Hodgkin lymphoma and acute leukemia), with 
infections (mostly EBV) being the second more frequent triggers. Rheumatologic diseases, 
namely adult-onset Still disease (AOSD) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), were also 
reported and, of note, in a consistent proportion of patients (ranging from 6% up to 23%) no 
trigger could be identified and HLH was defined of unknown origin or idiopathic.  
When HLH occurs in the setting of a rheumatologic disease, HLH is usually termed macrophage 
activation syndrome (MAS). Reports have recently described patients who developed MAS on 
the background of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA), but were identified to be 
heterozygous for rare variants in the primary HLH-associated genes (Zhang et al., 2014) 
highlighting potential etiological, clinical, and pathological similarities between familial and 
acquired forms of HLH. A link between mutations in the perforin gene and predisposition to 
hematological malignancies has also been described (Clementi et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2014). 
Although pHLH and sHLH have historically been considered separate entities, it is now thought 1.0Study NI-0501-08 CSR_App 5.1.1 Study protocol Title:Name: [INVESTIGATOR_16852]-2021-023-8912

CONFIDENTIAL that overlaps between primary and secondary forms is more than previously recognized 
(Voskoboinik et al, 2013; Lehmberg 2015).  
The presentation of sHLH is clinically the same as pHLH and the HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria 
developed for primary forms (Henter et al., 2007) generally apply. Acute clinical signs and 
symptoms of immune activation including fever, spleno/hepatomegaly, adenopathy, rash are 
accompanied by [CONTACT_207023]-inflammatory cytokines including interferon gamma 
(IFN ), tumor necrosis factor  (TNF- ), interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-10, and macrophage colony-
stimulating factor (M-CSF) (Akashi et al., 1994; Ohga et al., 1993). Furthermore, biopsies of 
lymphoid tissues or histological examination of liver tissue from HLH patients reveal highly 
activated macrophages and lymphocytes, further supporting striking activation of the immune 
system. Therefore, categorizing patients into primary or secondary HLH based on clinical 
manifestations is often difficult and may be of limited value. Treatment should be initiated 
expeditiously if the diagnosis of HLH is suspected, regardless of the classification/trigger, in 
order to control the overactive immune system and to halt any underlying trigger.  
Secondary forms of HLH in adults are reported to carry a significant mortality rate, with the 
worse prognosis for patients with malignancy-associated HLH. In a series of 103 adult patients 
(Li et al., 2014), among patients with malignancy-related HLH only 20.4% of patients survived, 
among patients with infection-related HLH survival was 33% (but none of patients with bacterial 
infections survived), in autoimmune-related HLH survival was 43%. In 24 patients HLH was of 
unknown origin and outcome was very poor with only 4 patients achieving clinical improvement 
and surviving. 
Although statistics are limited by [CONTACT_207024], case series of adults treated with 
different regimens report an overall mortality rate from 40% to 75% (Takahashi N et al., 2001; 
Shabbir et al., 2011; Park et al., 2012; Parikh et al., 2014; Ramos-Casals et al., 2014; Arca et al, 
2015).  
The therapeutic approach to adult HLH is matter of discussion, since no prospective multicenter 
studies have been conducted so far. Generally, treatment of adult HLH has been based on the 
HLH-94 study, the only published prospective study conducted in children with HLH. However, 
the complex etiology and the inducing triggers need to be considered in the selection of the 
treatment regimen. As an example, it is yet unclear if immunosuppressive regimens, such as 
etoposide, dexamethasone, alemtuzumab, are suitable depending of the different underlying 
causes of HLH in adults (e.g., history of immunosuppression, presence of infective triggers). 
Furthermore, although short-term immunosuppressive regimens may control the excessive 
inflammatory status, they may not be tolerated if the therapy needs to be prolonged while 
assessing the long-term strategy with regard to potential hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
The availability of new agents, ideally non-immunosuppressive, would be of great value to 
improve the therapeutic armamentarium to tackle this severe and increasingly diagnosed disease 
in adult patients.    1.0Study NI-0501-08 CSR_App 5.1.1 Study protocol Title:Name: [INVESTIGATOR_16852]-2021-023-8912

Several lines of evidence support the relevance of IFN  as a target in HLH: 
1.Two animal models of pHLH and two animal models of sHLH have been investigated: 
Perforin knockout mice and Rab27-deficient mice develop all the diagnostic and many of 
the clinical and laboratory characteristics of human primary HLH when infected with 
lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) as a trigger. Neutralization of the high 
in both animal models led to the reversal of HLH clinical and 
laboratory abnormalities, and dramatically improved survival in the animal model 
characterized by [CONTACT_207025] (pfp -/-  mice) (Pachalopnik Schmid et al., 2009, Jordan et 
al., 2004).  
Repeated administration of CpG, causing TLR9 stimulation, has been used to mimic a 
chronic severe hyperstimulation in healthy mice as a model of HLH secondary to 
infection. Although these mice do not necessarily die, they develop typi[INVESTIGATOR_207016] (Behrens et al., 2011). Administration of an anti-
antibody led to reversal of clinical and laboratory features of HLH. Importantly, in this 
model it was demonstrated that administration of the anti-  to full

An animal model has been generated using IL-6 transgenic mice expressing high levels of 
IL-6, to mimic what occurs in patients with sJIA. When triggered with TLR ligands, these 
mice die with many of the features of the human HLH (Stippoli et al. 2012). In these 
mice, when  neutralized by [CONTACT_207026]-
was markedly improved and HLH laboratory parameters reverted. 
In conclusion, in all presented animal has been shown to be a key 
pathological effector in disease onset and progression.

correlate with laboratory parameters of disease severity, such as ferritin, platelet count and 
transaminases.

CONFIDENTIAL clinical and laboratory features of HLH such as fever, splenomegaly, cytopenia, 
hyperferritinemia, hypofibrinogenemia, and also CNS signs/symptoms (Jordan et al, 2015). 
The numerous pathophysiological and clinical features shared by [CONTACT_207027]/autoimmune diseases or infections strongly suggests that IFN may 
play a key role in adult HLH (Brisse et al., 2015).  
Objectives and brief outline of the study  
The present observational study is designed to provide a better understanding of IFN  and IFN -
inducible chemokines as markers of HLH disease activity in adults, and of the potential of IFN  
to represent a therapeutic target in this patient population. 
Adult patients ( 18 years old) are eligible, if having consented to the use of their clinical data for 
research purposes.  
Clinical data and sample collection may be performed either retrospectively (provided that 
sufficient clinical information is available to allow for a meaningful interpretation of the 
biomarker results) and prospectively. 
If retrospective cases are evaluated, the presence of a malignancy and the diagnosis of primary 
HLH (defined as homozygous mutation in a known HLH causative gene) represent exclusion 
criteria for the study. On the contrary, if prospective patients are considered, inclusion in the 
study may occur before the diagnostic work-up has been completed. In case the diagnosis of 
malignancy-related HLH or primary HLH (as above defined) is made, the data collected will be 
analyzed separately. In particular, malignancy-HLH cases will be considered in the parallel 
observational protocol NI-0501-07. 
The present study will be conducted in the [LOCATION_002] and in Europe, until the required number 
of patients has been recruited.

Study Design and 
Procedures: This is a non-interventional study designed to determine the levels of 
pro-inflammatory markers (as listed above) in adult patients 
diagnosed with HLH and to assess the relationship between the 
biomarkers and disease activity . Whenever possible, the evolution of 
inflammatory markers will be followed during HLH treatment and 
the relationship with the disease outcome explored.  
Data collection may be performed retrospectively if sufficient 
clinical information is available to allow for a meaningful 
interpretation of the biomarker results. 
For biomarker analysis, a maximum of 5 ml of whole blood will be  
required per time point. Details on sample processing and shipment 
will be described in a separate brief laboratory manual provided to 
the site. Whenever possible, serum (and not plasma) sho uld be 
obtained for shipment , as this is the preferred matrix for the 
biomarker analysis.

on the clinical presentation of HLH, the assessments performed to 
characterize the secondary form, in particular those for identification 
of the potential HLH trigger, the date of onset of the background 
disease (if any) in relation to HLH manifestations, treatment regimen 
prior to and/or ongoing at the time of HLH onset, clinical and 
laboratory parameters relevant to HLH, specific HLH therapy with 
best response to the therapy, other concomitant medications , patient 
follow-up and disposition, stem cell transp lant status, duration of 
response, and survival. As appropriate, collection of serum samples 
for biomarker analysis and relevant information should occur at 
HLH diagnosis, and at regular time intervals during the treatment 
course (not more than once a week) up to resolution of HLH. 
If patients present CNS involvement and lumbar puncture is being 
performed for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes, a CSF sample will 
be collected, if possible, for biomarker assessment, in particular 
CXCL9 and CXCL10. 
If feasible and consistent with the standard clinical practice at the 
site, genetic characterization will be performed. A specific consent 
for genetic testing must be given by [CONTACT_102]. Genetic samples 1.0Study NI-0501-08 CSR_App 5.1.1 Study protocol Title:Name: [INVESTIGATOR_16852]-2021-023-8912

and between inflammatory markers and the severity of clinical 
manifestations, response to therapy, and survival of the patients will 
be assessed. Analyses may also be performed to study these  
relationships in various subgroups of patients, depending on the 
demographic, genetic and clinical characteristics observed (notably, 
HLH of unknown origin representing a specific subgroup of interest).  
An a posteriori  diagnostic classification of patients will be done ,

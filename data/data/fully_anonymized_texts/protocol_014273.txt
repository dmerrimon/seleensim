CR-6283 ,Statistical Analysis Plan Version 2.0 Page 6of 321. INTRODUCTION
This statistical analysis plan (SAP) describes the analyses and  data presentations for protocol CR-
[ADDRESS_850465] ion in bright lighting, Slit Lamp 
Findings (Grade 3 or higher) and Distance Monocular logMAR Visual Acuity. This study will also 
aim to show that the Fit Acceptance rate is at least 90% while w earing the Test lens. The secondary 
objective of this study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of the  Test lens compare to the Control 
lens with respect to CLUE Overall quality of Vision and Handlin g and overall quality of vision 
outdoors.
This study also aims to explore the performance of Indoor, Outd oor and Driving performance 
using individual questionnaire items. 
3. STUDY DESIGN
3.1. Overview
This study is a randomized, 4-visit, partially subject-masked, 2x3 bilateral crossover, dispensing 
trial.  Approximately [ADDRESS_850466] 105 subjects 
complete.
The study begins with an initial visit (Visit 1). If a subject is found to meet all eligibility criteria, 
they will be randomized to one of two lens wear sequences (Test /Control/Control or 
Control/Test/Test). If the subject is dispensed their first study lenses at the initial visit then [ADDRESS_850467] follow-up visit will occur at approrimxatel y 2-weeks after intial dispensing 
(Visit 2). At visit 2, subjects will be dispensed their next lens as specified per the randomization.Subjects ’follow-up for their second lens will occur approximately 2-week s after visit 2 (Visit 3). 
Subjects will be dispensed their last study lens (per the randomization) at visit 3 and will return 
for their final follow-up visit (visit 4) approximately 2-week after visit 3.  Unscheduled follow-up 
visits may occur during the study. Subjects will be advised to wear the study lenses at least five 
(5) days per week for at least six (6) hours per day for a peri od of two-weeks each.

3.3. Targeted Study Population and Sample Size
Approximately [ADDRESS_850469] lenses.  All subjects will be 
the age of 18 and <[ADDRESS_850470]/Control/Control or Control/Test/Test. Each lens will be wo rn for approximately 2 weeks in a 
bilateral fashion as DW totaling in a study duration of approximate ly 42 days (6 weeks) per subject.  
Table 2: Planned Enrollment St rategy by [CONTACT_636466] [ADDRESS_850471] Article Allocation and Masking
A computer-generated randomization scheme will be used to random ly assign subjects, in blocks 
of 2, to one of the two possible lens wear sequences (TEST/CONTR OL/CONTROL or 
CONTROL/TEST/TEST). The random scheme will be generated using t he PROC PLAN 
procedure from SAS Software Version 9.4 or higher (SAS Institute , Cary, NC).
The study site must follow the randomization scheme provided an d complete enrollment according 
to the randomization list and not pre-select or assign subjects . The randomized assignment of 
subjects will be performed at the first visit prior to the first fitting. The following must have 
occurred prior to randomization:
xInformed consent has been obtained
xSubject meets all the inclusion / exclusion criteria
xSubject history and baseline information has been collected.
Complete masking is impossible due to the functioning nature of  the Test lens.However, both the 
Test and Control were overlabeled in order to reduce bias as mu ch as possible since the Control 
lens may be the subject’s habi tual lens by [CONTACT_3364].  Therefore, the study is partially-subject  masked 
(Control lens only).

4. STUDY ENDPOINTS
4.1. Primary Endpoints
Primary Efficacy Endpoints:
CLUE Overall Comfort
Overall comfort scores will be assessed usin g the Contact [CONTACT_169754] (CLUE™)[ADDRESS_850474] lenses (comfort, vision, 
handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population i n the US, ages 18-65. Derived 
CLUE scores, using Item Response Theory (IRT), follow a normal d istribution with a population 
average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a mor e favorable/positive response. A
5 point increase in an average CLUE score translates into 10% s hift in the distribution of scores 
for a population of soft contact [CONTACT_19554]1.  The handling scores will be generated using the 
flexMIRT software version 3 or higher (Chapel Hill, NC).
Distance Monocular Contact [CONTACT_636468] (logMAR) is assessed for each subject eye at 
the two-week follow-up evaluation using EDTRS charts under two lighting conditions, (1) Bright 
illumination low contrast and (2) Dim Illumination High Contrast.
Vision Satisfaction in Bright Lighting
Vision satisfaction in bright light ingwill be assessed using the individual item 
“I was satisfied with the quality of my vision in bright light ing” from the CLUE™ questionnaire. 
[COMPANY_012] Vision Confidential
CR-6283 ,Statistical Analysis Plan Version 2.0 Page 10of 32This item uses the response scale, 1: Strongly Disagree, 2: Disa gree, 3: Neither Agree nor 
Disagree, 4: Agree and 5: Strongly Agree. 
Primary Safety Endpoints:
Slit Lamp Findings (Grade 3 or Higher)
Slit Lamp Findings will be assessed using the FDA Grading scale ranfing from 0 to 4, where Grade 
0 represents the absence of findings and 1 to 4 representing su ccessively worse findings (i.e. Grade 
1=trace, Grade 2= mile, Grade 3=moderate and Grade 4= severe). The assessment will include 
conjunctival injection, corneal e dema, corneal neovasluralizati on, corneal staining, tarsal 
abnormalities or any other complication. SLF assessements will be conducted for each subject eye 
at all scheduled study visits(Fitting [Visit 1] and 2-Week Follow-up [Visit 2]). The percentage of eyes with Grade 3 or higher slit lamp findings will be analyzed ; eyes with multiple events will be 
counted only once.
Fit Acceptance Rate
Acceptable lens fit will be assessed for each subject eye at al l scheduled study visits (fitting [visit 
1] and follow-up [visit 2]).  Fit acceptance rate will be based  on the lens fit acceptance of eyes 
wearing the Test lens only.  Fit rates of the Control lens will  also be collected but are not a primary 
endpoint.

CLUE Comfort 
Sample size calculation for CLUE comfort was carried out using an approximation of the power 
of an F-test derived from the non-centrality parameter calculat ed form the observed F statistic of 
a linear model3.
Model details:
CLUE comfort was analyzed using a linear mixed model. Lens type was included as the only fixed 
effect.  An unstructured (UN) covariance matrix was used to mod el the correlation between 
measurements on the same subject across study periods.  Below i s the variance-covariance matrix

Acceptable Lens Fit 
Acceptable lens fit is a binary response as y=[ADDRESS_850481] ey e has an acceptable fit and y=[ADDRESS_850482] lens therefore, the common reference rate of 95% was s elected for the sample size 
calculation, since this is considered to be a more conservative reference proportion. Assuming a 
correlation 0.[ADDRESS_850483] a nd period (intra-eye correlation);
and assuming a correlation of 0.[ADDRESS_850484] across periods.
A total of 2000 replicating trials were simulated to estimate a  s a m p l e  s i z e  w i t h  a  m i n i m u m  
statistical power of 80%.
Slit Lamp Findings
There were no Grade [ADDRESS_850485] and period; and a correlation of 0.[ADDRESS_850486] across 
periods (intra-subject correlation) . A reference rate of no more than 5% was assumed (worse-case 
scenario) with a non-inferiority odds ratio margin of 2. A total of 2000 replicating trials were simulated, each replicated sample was analyzed using a generali zed estimating equation (GEE) 
model with a binary distribution and the logit as the link func tion. Each model included lens type 
as the only fixed, eye was included as a random effect. The Odd s ratio and corresponding 95% 
confidence interval was used est imate differences between the T est and Control lenses. The upper 
limit of each 95% confidence interval was compared to 2; if the  upper limit was below 2 then

Lens Preferences: 
Lens preference items listed below will be analyzed separately using Bayesian multinomial 
models for nominal data. 
1. Overall lens preference 2. Overall comfort 3. Overall vision 4. Overall reduction of glare 5. Overall preference indoors 6. Overall preference outdoors
7. Overall preference while driving during the day 
8. Overall preference while driving at night 9. Overall preference while using computer screens & digital dev ices 
The regression models will include lens wearing sequence, age a nd gender as fixed covariates 
when appropriate.  Investigational site will be included as ran dom effect if the variation across 
sites is not negligible.

independent vague N(0,1000) priors for the regression coefficie nts μ0kl,β1k, β2kandβ3k, and 
IG(0.001, 0.001) for σs2.
Hypothesis Testing:
For each preference item, the null and alternative hypotheses for superiority are as follows: 
Ho: OR k≤ 1 Ha: OR k> 1; where OR krepresents the odds ratio of comparing the Test lens to the 
Control lens with regard to item k.  The odds ratio is calculat ed as:
OR k= p .k1(1- p. k2)/p. k2(1-p. k1),
where p. kl is the mean estimate p ijkl for k=1, ..., 5 and l = 1, …, 4.
For each item k, the superiority will be declared if the lower b ound of the 2-sided 95% credible 
interval of OR kis greater than 1: Pr(OR k> 1|y) ≥ .975. 
Outdoor Glare Reduction 
Outdoor Glare reduction consists of 4 individual questionnaire items.
1. Ability to see comfortably in bright sunlight2. Reduction in glare caused by [CONTACT_636481] 3. Reduction of squinting in bright sunlight4. Reduction of eyestrain in bright sunlight 
All outdoor glare items are assessed using the same ordinal scale (1=Excellent …5=Poor). Outdoor Glare reduction items will be analyzed separately using a Bayes ian multinomial model for ordinal 
data adjusting for baseline.  The regression model will include  sequence of lens wear, lens type, 
period and first order carryover effect. Clinical site and subject nested within clinical site will be included as random effects. Other subject characteristics such as age, gender, race and iris category 
will be included when appropriate.

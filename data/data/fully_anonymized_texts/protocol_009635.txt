STUDY  SYNOPSIS
Protocol num ber: SPD422 -113 Drug: Anagrelide Hydrochloride
Title of the study: A Phase 1, Open -label, Single -sequence, Non -random ized, Crossover, Drug -Drug Interaction  
Study to E valuate the Effect of Omeprazole on the Pharmacokinetics of SPD422 (anagrelide hydrochloride ) in 
Healthy Adult Subjects
Number of subjects:
Approximately 35 subjects w ill be screened to ensure the enrollment and completion of approximately 20 subjects.
Investigator(s): 
Site(s) and Region(s): 
Study period (planned):
Feb 2018 –May 2018Clinical phase: Phase 1
Objectives:
Prim ary: The primary objective of this study is to assess the effect of a CYP1A2 inducer (omeprazole) on the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of anagrelide when administered concurrently.
Secondary: The secondary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of anagrelide, omeprazole, 
and co -administered anagrelide plus omeprazole.
Rationale:
CYP1A2 inducers may modify the pharmacokinetics of anagrelide and its metabolites when given concurrently. In 
this study the effect of a commonly used CYP1A2 inducer (omeprazole) on the PKof anagrelide will be assessed.
Inves tigational product, dose, and mode of administration:
SPD422 anagrelide hydrochloride 1 mg administered orally as tw o 0.5 mg capsules
Omeprazole 40 mg administered orally as a single 40 mg capsule once daily ( QD)for 7 days
Methodology:
This is a Phase 1, open -label, single -sequence, no n-randomized, multiple -dose, crossover pharmacokinetic study to 
assess the effect of a CYP1A2 inducer (omeprazole 40 mg) on the pharmacokinetics of anagrelide (1 mg) when 
administered concurrently in healthy subjects. Up to 35 male and female subjects, aged 18 -45 years will be screened 
to ensure the enrollment and completion of approximately 20 subjects. Subjects who discontinue the study will not 
be replaced. 
The study includes a screening period of up to 28 days, a treatme nt period (9 days ) and a follow -up phone call 
(7±[ADDRESS_712059] dose of investigational drug is administered). The maximum duration of study participation 
for any subject is 46 days, if the maximum screening, treatment and follow -up durations are us ed.
Follow ing the screening visit, subjects who meet the protocol specific inclusion and exclusion criteria w ill return to 
the Clinical Research Center (CRC) on Day -[ADDRESS_712060] 2018
Day 1: Anagrelide 1 mg, (administered orally as tw o 0.5 mg capsules) will be administered to all study subjects at 
approximately 8:[ADDRESS_712061] for 10 hours prior to and until 4 hours 
following administration of anagrelide on Day 1. 
Days 2-7: Omeprazole 40 mg will be administered orally QD on Days 2 -7 to all subjects. Omeprazole w ill be 
administered at approximately 8:[ADDRESS_712062].
Day 8: Anagrelide 1 mg and omeprazole 40 mg will be administered concurrently to all subjects at approximately 
8:[ADDRESS_712063] for 10 hours prior to and until 4 hours following 
administration of anagrelide and omeprazole on Day 8.
Day 9: Subjects will be discharged from the CRC on Day 9 follow ing the completion of all study procedures and 
assessments. 
Subjects who discontinue early from the study will complete the Early Termination assessments .

Endpoints and statistical analysis:
Endpoints and statistical analysis:
Three analysi s populations are defined for this study: the e nrolled, safety, and pharmacokinetic sets:
The enrolled set consists of all subjects for whom an enrollment number has been assigned. Usually, these are the 
subjects who meet the study inclusion/exclusion crit eria and sign the informed consent form.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_712074] (anagrelide or 
omeprazole) and have at least [ADDRESS_712075] evaluable PK data 
(defined as complete concentration -time profile to obtain meaningful estimates of PK parameters) available for 
1dose regimen. The PK analyses will be based on this population.
Prim ary endpoint:
SPD422 w ill be administered under fasting conditions on Days [ADDRESS_712076] on Days 2 -7 and under fasting conditions on Day 8. PK evaluations of anagrelide concentrations will be 
performed on Day 1 and Day 8, and PK evaluations of omeprazole concentrations will be following 
coadministration with anagrelide on Day 8.
Pharm acokinetic parameters will be determined from the plasma concentration -time data for anagrelide and 
omeprazole by [CONTACT_105] -compartmenta l analysis. The pharmacokinetic parameters will include, but not be limited to:
AUC0 -¥: Area under the curve extrapolated to infinity, calculated using the observed value of the last non -zero 
concentration (anagrelide and metabolites)
AUC0 -t:: Area under t he curve from time [ADDRESS_712077] time point of sample collection (anagrelide and metabolites)
AUC0 -tau: Area under the concentration -time curve from time zero to the end of the dosing interval ([ADDRESS_712078] 
dose) (omeprazole only)
CL/F: Total body clearan ce for extravascular administration.
Cmax: Maximum concentration occurring at tmax
Cmin: The minimum concentration observed over the dosing interval (omeprazole only)
t½: Terminal half -life
tmax: Tim e of maximum observed concentration sampled during a dosi ng interval
Vz/F:Volume of distribution associated with the terminal slope follow ing extravascular administration.
The primary pharmacokinetic parameters will include the Cmax, AUC0 -t and AUC0 -∞ for anagrelide and its active 
metabolite, 3 -OH-anagrelide (BC H24426).
The geometric mean relative bioavailability and 90% confidence limits for the effect of omeprazole w ill be 
evaluated (eg, AUCanagrelide+omeprazole/AUCanagrelide).
Because the CYP2C19 -mediated metabolism of omeprazole is subject to genetic polymorp hism (approximately 
2/3subjects are CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers (EMs) with lower omeprazole AUC and 1/3 subjects are 
CYP2C19 intermediate/poor metabolizers IMs/PMs with higher omeprazole AUC), the geometric mean relative 
bioavailability and 90% confidence interval ( CI)will be calculate for (1) all subjects, (2) EMs, and (3) IMs/PMs. 
The observed omeprazole AUC 0-tauwill be used to define the CYP2C19 metabolizer status of subjects, w ith AUC 0- tau
<5,200 ng•h/mL (<15 µmol/L) classified as CYP2C19 EM and AUC 0-tau≥5,200 ng•h/mL (≥15 µmol/L) classified as 
CYP2C19 IM/PM.
Secondary endpoint:
Safety will be assessed for the following evaluations for anagrelide alone, omeprazole alone, and anagrelide and 
omeprazole combination treatments:
Number, severity, serio usness, and causality of treatment emergent adverse events ( TEAEs )
Changes in physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram ( ECGs ), and clinical laboratory results 
(hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) from baseline to post -baseline time points.
Sample Size Justification:
Approximately [ADDRESS_712079], targeting the width of the 90% 
confidence interval.
From a previous crossover study (SPD422 -110), the w ithin-subject coefficient variation in anagrelide 
log-transformed AUC was estimated to be 0.132. Allowing for a slightly larger w ithin-subject CV of 0.15, a sample 
size of 11 subjects is required to estimate the mean difference betw een anagrelide + omeprazole and anagrelide 
alone in the log -transformed AUC with an error margin of at most ±0.2231 at 90% confidence w ith a probability of 
90%. Thus, if the true geometric mean treatment ratio is 0.6, the lower and upper 90% confidence bounds will be 
estimated to be w ithin 0.48 and 0.75 (exp[ln(0.6) –0.2231] and exp[ln(0.6) + 0.2231]) w ith 90% probability. 
Therefore, w ith an overall sample size of 20 subjects, anticipated 13 to 14 CYP2C19 EM subjects and 6 to 7 
CYP2 C19 IM/PM subjects, this statistical power will be met for the overall population and the CYP2C19 EM 
population. The confidence bounds for the smaller population of CYP2C19 IM/PM subjects will be slightly wider.
Statistical Methodology for Pharmacokinetic Endpoint(s):
The follow ing analyses will be conducted on the Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set. All statistical analyses will be 
presented for the CYP2C19 EM group, the CYP2C19 IM/PM group, and overall.
Summary statistics (number of observations, mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, median, maximum, 
minimum, and geometric mean) will be determined for all pharmacokinetic parameters and presented by [CONTACT_3148]. 
Plasma concentrations of anagrelide, 3 -hydroxy -anagrelide, RL603, and omeprazole at each n ominal sampling time 
will also be summarized by [CONTACT_53846].
The log -transformed pharmacokinetic parameters will be compared between the 2 treatments (anagrelide plus 
omeprazole and anagrelide alone) using an analysis of variance model for a single -sequence crossover design with 
treatment and subject as fixed effects will be used. The magnitude of the effect of omeprazole on the 
pharmacokinetic profile of anagrelide and its metabolites will be evaluated by [CONTACT_544623] n inety percent 
(90%) confidence intervals for the treatment difference on the log -transformed parameters back -calculated to the 
original scale for the comparisons of Cmax, AUC0 t, and AUC0 ∞ (test treatment =anagrelide plus omeprazole, 
reference treatment =anagrelide alone).
Statistical Methodology for Safety Endpoint(s):
The safety endpoints will be summarized with descriptive statistics for the safety set .
Relevant safety endpoints as well as their changes from baseline will be summarized. Baseline is define d as the last 
assessment prior to the first dose of investigational product. Potentially clinically important findings will also be 
summarized or listed. The potentially clinically important values will be defined in the statistical analysis plan 
(SAP).
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. The number of events, 
incidence, and percentage of treatment -emergent adverse events will be calculated overall, by [CONTACT_9313], by 
[CONTACT_11702], and by [CONTACT_3148] g roup. Treatment emergent adverse events will be further summarized by [CONTACT_544624]. Adverse events related to investigational product, AEs leading to 
withdrawal, SAEs, and deaths will be similarly summarized/listed.
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_38915], new findings from physical examination, evaluation of blood pressure, heart rate,
new findings from [ADDRESS_712080] results (biochemistry, hematology, and urinalysis).
Clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECG findings will be summarized by [CONTACT_6982]. Potentially 
clinically important findings will also be summarized or listed.

1. BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON
1.1 Indication and Current Treatment Options 
Anagrelide is a selective inhibitor of megakary ocyte growth and development, whi ch is used to 
lower the high platelet count in patients with essential t hrombocy themia (ET). The effect of 
anagrelide on the platelet count of patients with ET is highly  variable, requiring careful dose 
titration to lower platelet counts to ≤600 x 109/L and optimally  to ≤450 x 109/L. Treatment with 
Anagrelide is t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y initiated at 1 mg/day  (administered as 0.5 mg twice daily  [BID]) for one 
week, followed b y careful titration to individually  subject -optimized dose regimen balancing 
lowered platelet counts and tolerability .
1.[ADDRESS_712093] Background
Anagrelide ( AGRYLIN ®; XAGRID®; Shire Pharmaceuticals Group PLC), licensed in 45 territories 
including the European Union (EU), is an orally  active quinazoline derivative and the only  
platelet -lowering agent showing se lectivity  for megakary ocytes. Anagrelide is believed to inhibit 
TPO/c -mpl receptor -mediated events in megakaryocy tes, leading to reduced maturation of the 
megakary ocytes and ultimately  to decreased platelet numbers. Clinical studies in subjects 
support a h ypothesis of dose-related reduction in platelet production resulting from a decrease in 
megakary ocyte hy permaturation. 
Anagrelide selectivel y lowers platelets due to inhibitory  effects due to megakary ocytopoiesis. 
The action of anagrelide has recently  been determined to suppress expression of the key  
transcription factors. GATA- 1 and FOG -1, downstream of TPO/c -mpl receptor -mediated events. 
These factors are required at all stages of megakaryocy topoiesis from differentiation to 
maturation . Anagrelide downre gulates expression of GATA -1 and FOC -1 without altering 
TPO/c -mpl-mediated signaling, an action independent of cAMP PDE III inhibition . Anagrelide 
does not interfere with erythropoietin -stimulated ery thropoiesis, or leukocytopoiesis 
(Ahluwalia 
et al., 2010 ). 
Refer to the i nvestigator’s brochure provided under separate cover for more information.
1.2.1 Clinical Information
Anagrelide administered to he althy  subjects during Phase 
1clinical studies demonstrated a 
consistent safet y profile at 1mg/day dosing. In studies SPD422 -[ADDRESS_712094] 
common events (>10%) were dizziness, postural dizziness, headache, feeling hot, procedural site 
pain, and palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814]. There were no clinically  significant electrocardiogram (ECG) changes 
reported in either study . In healthy  subjects receiving a single dose of anagrelide 2.5mg (stud y 
SPD422 -111, Thorough QT study ), 73% of subjects reported headache, and >20% of subjects 
reported dizziness and nausea. One subject was withdrawn from the stud y due to 
treatment -emergent T- wave inversion on ECG at the 2.[ADDRESS_712095] mean time -matched increase of +29.[ADDRESS_712096] 2018
Additionally , anagrelide 2.5 mgincreased theQTcNi (patient -specific corrected QT) and QTcF 
(Fridericia corrected QT) with an upper 2 -sided 90% confidence interval (CI) exceeded 10msec 
at 1 and 1.5 hours (values of 15.7 msec and 13.6 msec, respectivel y) for QtcNi and at 1 hour for 
QTcF (value of 12.7 msec). These changes corresponded to the time of t maxfor anagrelide and its 
active metabolite, 3 -hydroxy -anagrelide, and the magnitude of the change at these time points 
met the definition for a positive thorough QT study . However, the QTcN i and QTcF values were 
increased only  when the heart rate was increasing rapi[INVESTIGATOR_544619] 0.5 -1.5 hours after administration of 
anagrelide 2.5mg, and the interpretation of the increased QTcNi and QTcF may  be confounded 
by [CONTACT_544625] -RR hy steresis that occurs when the 
heart rate changes rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375].
Anagrelide is metabolized via cy tochrome P450 ty pe 1A2 (CYP1A2) to form its active 
metabolite, 3- hydroxy -anagrelide (also known as BCH24426) which undergoes both renal 
excreti on and further metabolism via CYP1A2 to form the inactive metabolite, RL 603. 
Administration of anagrelide with a CYP1A2 inducer could potentiall y increase the clearance of 
anagrelide as well as increase both formation rate and clearance of the active metab olite. Shire 
has been requested b y the European Medicines Agency to assess the effect of the CYP1A2 
inducer omeprazole on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of anagrelide when given concurrently .
Omeprazole is metabolized by  [CONTACT_097]2C19, an important poly morphically  expressed enzy me. 
Based on the incidence of this genetic poly morphism in the general population, approximately  
2/3 of the subjects in this study  are expected to be CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers (EMs), and 
the remaining 1/3 of the subjects in this study  will be CYP2C19 intermediate/poor metabolizers 
(IMs/PMs). The CYP2C19 I Ms/PMs will have higher omeprazole plasma concentrations leading 
to a greater CYP1A2 induction than the CYP2C19 EMs. I t is important to evaluate the effect of 
omeprazole on the pharmacokine tic profile of anagrelide and its active metabolite in EMs and 
IMs/PMs as well as overall ( Rost et al., 1992 ; Rost and Roots, 1994; Nousbaum et al., 1994 ).The 
area under the curve ( AUC )of omeprazole will be used to classify  subjects into the CYP2C19 
EM or IM/PM categories in this study  (Rost et al., 1 992). Increased knowledge and 
understanding of the effect of the CYP1A2 inducer omeprazole on the pharmacokinetic profile 
of anagrelide and the varying impact of CYP2C19 poly morphisms on the magnitude of 
omeprazole's CYP1A2 induction effect on the pharma
cokinetic profile of anagrelide are helpful 
in optimizing personalized anagrelide drug therapy.

Medical and Medication History
A complete medical and medication history , as well as demographic information, will be 
performed at the screening visit/time points described in Table 1 by a qualified licensed 
physician, ph ysician’s assistant, or a nurs e practitioner. The medical history  will be reviewed and 
recorded, including:
Date of birth
Sex
Race and ethnicity
Recent ingestion of medication (30 days prior to entering the screening period)
History  of respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] , cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestin al, hepatic, endocrine, 
hematological, neurological, psy chiatric, and other diseases
Smoking habits 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_712155] 2018
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Examination (Including Height and Weight)
A complete ph ysical examination will be performed at the time points described in Table 1,
Table 2, and Table 3by a qualified licensed ph ysician, phy sician’s assistant, or nurse 
practitioner.
The phy sical examination will include a review of the following bod y systems:
General appearance
Skin
Head, ey es, ears, nose, and throat
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]/neck/thy roid
Musculoskel etal
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]
Cardiovascular
Neurological
Abdomen (including liver and kidney s)
Abnormalities identified at the screening visit will be documented in the subject’s source 
documents and on the medical history  CRF. Changes after the screening visit that are considered 
clinically  significant will be captured as AEs on the AE CRF page, as deemed by  [CONTACT_1275].
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Collection
At each stud y visit, subjects will be questioned in a general way to ascertain if AEs have 
occurred since the previous visit (eg, “Have you had an y health problems since your last visit?”). 
Adverse events are collected from the time informed consent is signed. (Please refer to Section 8, 
Adverse and Serious Adverse Events Assessment.)
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs
Blood Pressure and Pulse 
Rate
Blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured at times specified in Table 1, Table 2, and
Table 3of this protocol. Additional blood pressure and pulse rate measurements may  be 
performed, as determined by  [CONTACT_093], in order to ensure appropri ate monitoring of 
subject safet y and accurate recording of vital sign measurements. An y changes from baseline 
which are deemed clinically  significant b y the investigator 
areto be recorded as an AE.
The same method for obtaining blood pressure measurement (auscultatory  or oscillometric) 
should be used throughout the study  for all subjects (and documented). In addition, the 
conditions of vital sign measurements should be controlled and as consistent as possible during 
the study , in order to minimize external variability of the readings. 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_712156] 2018
Itisadvised thatmeasurements be collected at a comfortable room temperature with little to no 
background noise, using the same (appropriatel y sized) cuff placed at the same location of the 
same arm during the study. The bladder deflation rate should be deflated (calibrated for 
oscillometric method or manually  by [CONTACT_444101]) at a rate of 2-3 mmHg/s (and the first 
and last audible sounds recorded as s ystolic and diastolic pressure) after at least [ADDRESS_712157] a bladder length that is 80% and a width that is at least 40% of arm 
circumference (a length -to-width ratio of 2:1). 
The subject should be asked to remove all clothing that covers the location of cuff placement. 
The subject should be instructed to relax as much as possible for at least [ADDRESS_712158] should be l ying comfortabl y, with the legs uncrossed. The ar m should be supported 
with a pi[INVESTIGATOR_6356], such that the middle of the cuff on the upper arm is at the level of the right atrium 
(approximately  halfway  between the bed and the level of the sternum).One reading (supi[INVESTIGATOR_47535]/diastolic blood pres sure-heart rate) should be taken at each timepoint. 
The use of automated devices for measuring pulse rate is acceptable, although, when done 
manually , pulse rate will be measured in the brachial/radial artery  for at least 30 seconds. When 
the timing of th ese measurements coincides with a blood collection, blood pressure and pulse 
rate should be obtained prior to the nominal time of the blood collection.
At the screening visit, blood pressure should be compared between both arms. When there is a 
consistent inter -arm difference confirmed over 3 consecutive measurements (>10 mmHg), the 
arm with the higher blood pressure should be used for inclusion at screening and the last 
measurement recorded in the CRF. The same (right or left) arm with the higher blood pre ssure 
will be used throughout the study .
For details on blood pressure and pulse procedures for health y subjects, see Figure 2.

The test results must be confirmed negative prior to enrollment in the study. If a test result is 
positive, the subject will be excluded from entering the stud y. Results of the virology  screen will 
be reviewed and verified by  [CONTACT_10184], but will not be col lected in the CRF database.
[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiogram
Twelve -lead ECGs will be performed at the times specified in Table 1, Table 2,andTable [ADDRESS_712163] methods/equipment at the CRC.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_712164] 2018
The following parameters will be recorded on the appropriate CRF page: heart rate, PR, RR, 
QRS, and QT intervals. The QTcB and QTcF will be derived from the data in the database. The 
investigator’s assessment of the ECG tracing as normal or abnormal must be documented, and if 
abnormal, his/her determination of whether the ab normality  is clinicall y significant or not will be 
documented on the tracing and recorded in the CRF.
The subject should be asked to remove all clothing that covers the location of lead placement. 
The subject must be resting in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_92634] l east [ADDRESS_712165]’s baseline ECG.
7.2.3 Pharmacokinetic Procedures
The name [CONTACT_10214] (ies) for this study  will be maintained in the 
investigator’s files at th e/each site and in the Trial Master File at the sponsor.
Actual pharmacokinetic blood sample collection times versus time of dosing will be 
monitored. The sponsor’s expectation is that the investigator will ensure that every  effort is 
made to collect all p harmacokinetic blood samples at the precise protocol scheduled time. 
Pharmacokinetic blood collection must not deviate from the nominal collection time set forth in 
the protocol by  [CONTACT_726] [ADDRESS_712166] dose or by  [CONTACT_544631]  [ADDRESS_712167] dose. Samples drawn outside these 
parameters will be considered a protocol deviation.

Note: The amount of blood to be drawn for each assessment is an estimate. The amo unt of blood 
to be drawn may  vary  according to the instructions provided by  [CONTACT_10190]; however, the total volume drawn over the course of the stud y 
should be approximately  222 mL s. When more than 1 blood assessment is to be done at the time

treatment. An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including a n abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product 
(International Conference on Harmonisation [ ICH]Guidance E2A 1995).
All AEs are collected from the time the informed consent is signed until the defined follow -up 
period stated in Section 7.1.[ADDRESS_712173] be followed to closure (the subject’s health has returned to his/her baseline status 
or all variables have returned to normal), regardless of whether the subject is still participating in 
the study . Closure indicates that an outcome is reached, stabilization achieved (the investigator 
does not expect any  further improvement or worsening of the event), or the event is otherwise 
explained. When appropriate, medical tests and examinations are performed so that resolution of 
event(s) can be documented.
8.1.[ADDRESS_712174] be 
recorded as new AEs (for example, if a subject experiences mild intermittent dy spepsia prior to 
dosing of investigational product, but the dy spepsia becomes severe and more frequent after first 
dose of investigational product has been administered, a new AE of severe dy spepsia [with the 
appropria te date of onset] is recorded on the appropriate CRF).
The medical assessment of severit y is determined by [INVESTIGATOR_1477]:
Mild: A type of AE that is usually  transient and may  require only  minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally  interfere with usual 
activities of daily  living.
Moderate: A type of AE that is usually  alleviated with specific therapeutic intervention. The 
event interferes with usual activities of daily  living, causing discomfort but poses 
nosignificant or permanent risk of harm to the research subject.
Severe: A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily  living, or significantl y affects 
clinical status, or may  require intensive therapeutic intervention.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_712175] 2018
8.1.2 Relationship Categorization
A phy sician/investigator must make the assessment of relationship to investigational product for 
each AE. The investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a 
reasonable possibility  that the event may  have been caused b y the i nvestigational product. If 
there is no valid reason for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “not 
related”. Otherwise, if there is an y valid reason, even if undetermined or untested, for suspecting 
a possible cause -and-effect relationship between the investigational product and the occurrence 
of the AE, then the AE should be considered “related”. The causality  assessment must be 
documented in the source document.
The following additional guidance may  be helpful:
Term Relationship D efinition
RelatedThe temporal relationship between the event and the administration of the 
investigational product is compelling and/or follows a known or suspected response 
pattern to that product, and the event cannot be explained by [CONTACT_423]’s medi cal 
condition, other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or accident.
Not RelatedThe event can be readily explained by [CONTACT_1605]’s underlying 
medical condition, concomitant therapy, or accident and no plausible temporal or 
biologic relationship exists between the investigational product and the event.
8.1.[ADDRESS_712176] be recorded during the course of the stud y on the CRF. Outcomes are 
as follows:
Fatal
Not Recovered/Not Resolved
Recovered/Resolved
Recovered/Resolved With Sequelae
Recovering/Resolving
Unknown
8.1.[ADDRESS_712177] to the start of study  
treatment, further investigations should be performed until the values retu rn to within the 
reference range or until a plausible explanation (eg, concomitant disease) is found for the 
abnormal values.
The investigator should decide, based on the above criteria and the clinical condition of a 
subject, whether a change in a clinica l laboratory , vital sign, or ECG parameter is clinicall y 
significant and therefore represents an AE.
8.1.[ADDRESS_712178] be reported within 24 hours to the 
Shire Global Safet y Department using the Shire Investigational and Marketed Products 
Pregnancy  Report Form. A copy  of the Shire Investigational and Marketed Products Pr egnancy  
Report Form (and an y applicable follow -up reports) must also be sent to the CRO/Shire medical 
monitor using the details specified in the 
emergency  contact [CONTACT_1739]. 
The pregnant female study participant must be withdrawn from the study .
Every  effort should be made to gather information regarding the pregnancy  outcome and 
condition of the infant. It is the responsibility  of the investigator to obtain this information within 
[ADDRESS_712179] partum.
Pregnancy  complications such as spontaneous abortion/miscarriage or congenital abnormality  
are considered SAEs and must be reported using the Shire Clinical Study  Serious Adverse Event 
and Non -serious AEs Requi red by  [CONTACT_10191]. Note: An elective abortion is not 
considered an SAE.
In addition to the above, if the investigator determines that the pregnancy  meets serious criteria, 
it must be reported as an SAE using the Shire Clinical Study  Serious Adverse Event and 
Non-serious AEs Required by  [CONTACT_49136]. The test date of the first positive serum/urine -hCG 
test or ultrasound result will determine the pregnancy  onset dat e.
8.1.6 Abuse, Misuse, Overdose, and Medication Error
Abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication error (as defined below) must be reported to the sponsor 
according to the SAE reporting procedure whether or not they  result in an AE/SAE as described 
in Section 8.2. N ote: The 24 -hour reporting requirement for SAEs does not apply  to reports of 
abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors unless these result in an SAE. 
The categories below are not mutually  exclusive; the event can meet more than [ADDRESS_712180] 2018
Abuse – Per sistent or sporadic intentional intake of investigational product when used for 
a non -medical purpose (eg, to alter one’s state of consciousness or get high) in a manner 
that may  be detrimental to the individual and/or society
Misuse – Intentional use of i nvestigational product other than as directed or indicated at 
any dose (Note: this includes a situation where the investigational product is not used as 
directed at the dose prescribed by  [CONTACT_760])
Overdose 
– Intentional or unintentional intake of a do se of investigational product higher 
than the protocol -prescribed dose
Medication Error –An error made in prescribing, dispensing, administration, and/or use 
of an investigational product. For studies, m edication errors are reportable to the sponsor 
only as defined below.
Medication errors should be collected/reported for all products under investigation.

Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_712183] 2018
8.2.3 Serious Adverse Event Definition
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any  untoward medical occurrence (whether considered to be 
related to investigational product or not) that at any dose:
Results in death
Is life -threatening. Note: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers 
to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not 
refer to an event which hy pothetically  might have caused death if it was more severe.
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. Note: 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_544621] d surgery  for 
pre-existing conditions and have not worsened after initiation of treatment should not be 
classified as SAEs. For example, an admission for a previousl y scheduled ventral hernia 
repair would not be classified as an SAE; however, complication( s) resulting from a 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10153] y scheduled surgery  that meet(s) serious 
criteria must be reported as SAE(s).
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity
Is a congenital abnormality /birth defect
Is an importan t medical event. Note: I mportant medical events that may not result in 
death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], 
based upon appropriate medical judgment, they  may  jeopardize the subject and may  
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home; blood dy scrasias or convulsions 
that do not result i n inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the development of drug dependency  or 
drug abuse.
8.2.4 Serious Adverse Event Collection Time Frame
All SAEs (regardless of relationship to study ) are collected from the time the subject signs the 
informed consent until the define d follow -up period stated in Section 7.1.[ADDRESS_712184] be reported 
to the Shire Global Safety  Department andthe CRO/Shire medical monitor within [ADDRESS_712185] awareness of the event.
In addition, any  SAE(s) considered “related” to the investigational product and discovered by  [CONTACT_10194] y interval after the study has completed must be reported to the Shire Global 
Safety  Department within [ADDRESS_712186]’s death (ie, the SAE was noted as the primary  cause of death) 
must have fatal checked as an outcome with the date of death record ed as the resolution date. For 
all other events ongoing at the time of death that did not contribute to the subject’s death, the 
outcome should be considered not resolved, without a resolution date recorded.
For an y SAE that results in the subject’s death or any  ongoing events at the time of death, unless 
another investigational product action was previously  taken (eg, drug interrupted, reduced, 
withdrawn), the action taken with the investigational product should be recorded as “dose not 
changed” or “not ap plicable” (if the subject never received investigational product). The 
investigational product action of withdrawn should not be selected solel y as a result of the 
subject’s death.
8.2.[ADDRESS_712187] 2018
9. DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL METHODS
9.1 Data Collection
The investigators’ authorized site personnel must enter the information required by  [CONTACT_64760]. A study  monitor will visit each site in accordance with the monitoring plan and 
review the CRF data against the source data for completeness and accuracy . Discrepancies 
between source data and data entered on the CRF will be addressed b y qualified site personnel. 
When a data discrepancy warrants correction, the correction will be made by [CONTACT_59752]. Data collection procedures will be discussed with the site at the site initiation visit 
and/or at the investigator’s meeting. Once a subject is randomized, it is expected that site 
personnel will complete the CRF entry  within approximately  [ADDRESS_712188]’s 
visit.
9.2 Clinical D ata Management
Data are to be entered into a clinical database as specified in the CRO’s data management plan. 
Quality  control and data validation procedures are applied to ensure the validity  and accuracy  of 
the clinical database.
Data are to be reviewed and checked for omissions, errors, and values requiring further 
clarification using computerized and manual procedures. Data queries requiring clarification are 
to be communicated to the site for resolution. Only authorized personnel will make corrections to 
the clinical database, and all corrections are documented in an auditable manner.
9.3 Data Handling Considerations
Not applicable.
9.4 Statistical Analysis Process
The study  will be anal yzed by  [CONTACT_98304] s agent.
The statistical anal ysis plan ( SAP)will provide the statistical methods and definitions for the 
analysis of the pharmacokinetic, pharmacody namic, and safet y data, as well as describe the 
approaches to be taken for summarizing other study  information such as subject disposition, 
demographics and baseline characteristics, investigational product exposure, and prior and 
concomitant medications. The SAP will also include a description of how missing, unused and 
spurious data will be addressed.
To preserve the integrit y of the statistical anal ysis and study  conclusions, t he SAP will be 
finalized prior to database lock.
All statistical analy ses will be performed using SAS(SAS I nstitute, Cary , NC [ZIP_CODE]) 
version 9.[ADDRESS_712189], targeting the 
width of the 90% confidence interval.
From a previous crossover study  (SPD422 -110), the within
-subject coefficient variation in 
anagrelide log -transformed AUC was estimated to be 0.132. Allowing for a slightly  larger 
within -subject CV of 0.15, a sample size of 11 subjects is required to estimate the mean 
difference between anagrelide + omeprazole and anagrelide alone in the log -transformed AUC 
with an error margin of at most ±0.2231 at 90% confidence with a probability of 90%. Thus, if 
the true geometric mean treatment ratio is 0.6, the lower and upper 90% confidence bounds will 
be estimated to be within 0.48 and 0.75 (exp[ln(0.6) – 0.2231] and exp[ln(0.6) + 0.2231]) with 
90% proba bility . Therefore, with an overall sample size of 20 subjects, anticipated 13 to 
14 CYP2C19 EM subjects and 6 to 7 CYP2C19 IM/PM subjects, this statistical power will be 
met for the overall population and the CYP2C19 EM population. The confidence bounds fo r the 
smaller population of CYP2C19 I M/PM subjects will be slightly wider.
9.[ADDRESS_712190] sof all subjects for whom an enrollment number has been assigned. 
Usually , these are the subjects who meet the study  inclusion/exclusion cr iteria and sign the 
informed consent form.
The safety setconsists of all subjects who have taken at least [ADDRESS_712191] 
(anagrelide or omeprazole) and have at least [ADDRESS_712192]- dose plasma concentration. The PK anal yses will be based on this 
population.
9.8 Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Analyses
9.8.1 Pharmacokinetic Analysis
All the pharmacokinetic a nalyses will be performed using the pharmacokinetic set.
Pharmacokinetic parameters will be determined from the plasma concentration -time data for 
anagrelide and its metabolites and omeprazole by [CONTACT_105] -compartmental analy sis and all 
calculations will be base d on the actual time since dose. The pharmacokinetic parameters will 
include, but not be limited to:
AUC 0
- Area under the curve extrapolated to infinity , calculated using the observed 
value of the last non -zero concentration (anagrelide and metabolites)
AUC 0-t Area under the curve from time [ADDRESS_712193] time point of sample collection 
(anagrelide and metabolites)
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_712194] 2018
AUC 0-tau Area under the concentration- time curve from time zero to the end of the 
dosing interval ([ADDRESS_712195] dose) (omeprazole only )
CL/F Total body  clearance for extravascular administration.
Cmax Maximum concentration occurring at t max
Cmin The minimum concentration observed over the dosing interval (omeprazole 
only)
t½ Terminal half -life
tmax Time of maximum observed concentration sampled during a dosing interval
Vz/F Volume of distribution associated with the terminal slope following 
extravascular administration.
The primary  pharmacokinetic parameters will include the C max, AUC 0 -tand AUC 0-∞for 
anagrelide and its active metabolite, 3- OH-anagrelide (BCH24426).
The geometric mean relative bioavailability  and 90% confidence limits for the effect of 
omeprazole will be evaluated (eg, AUC anagrelide+omeprazole /AUC anagrelide ).
Because the CYP2C19 -mediated metabolism of omeprazole is subject to genetic pol ymorphism 
(approximately  2/3 subjects are CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers with lower omeprazole AUC 
and 1/3 subjects are CYP2C19 intermediate/poor metabolizers with higher omeprazole AUC), 
the geom etric mean relative bioavailability  and 90% CI  will be calculate for (1) all subjects, 
(2)EMs, and (3) IMs/PMs
The observed omeprazole AUC 0-tauwill be used to define the CYP2C19 metabolizer status of 
subjects, with AUC 0-tau<5,200 ng•h/mL (<15 µmol/L ) classified as CYP2C19 EM and AUC 0-tau
≥5,200 ng•h/mL (≥15 µmol/L) classified as CYP2C19 I M/PM.
[IP_ADDRESS] Statistical Analysis of Pharmacokinetic Parameters
The following anal yses will be conducted on the Pharmacokinetic Analy sis Set. All statistical 
analyses will be p resented for the CYP2C19 EM group, the CYP2C19 I M/PM group, and 
overall.
Summary  statistics (number of observations, mean, standard deviation, coefficient of 
variation, median, maximum, minimum, and geometric mean) will be determined for all 
pharmacokineti c parameters and presented b y treatment . Plasma concentrations of anagrelide, 
3-hydroxy - anagrelide, RL603, and omeprazole at each nominal sampling time will also be 
summarized by  [CONTACT_53846].
The log- transformed pharmacokinetic p arameters will be compared between the 2 treatments 
(anagrelide plus omeprazole and anagrelide alone) using a [ADDRESS_712196] of omeprazole on the pharmacokinetic profile of anagrelide and its 
metabolites will be evaluated by  [CONTACT_544633] y percent (90%) confidence 
intervals for the treatment difference on the log- transformed parameters back- calculated to the 
original scale for the comparisons of C max, AUC 0-t, and AUC 0- ∞(test treatment =anagrelide plus 
omeprazole, reference treatment= anagrelide alone).
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_712197], AEs leading to 
withdrawal, SAEs, and deaths will be similarly  summarized/listed.
Safety  will be assessed by  [CONTACT_516316] (TEAEs), new findings from 
physical examination, evaluation of blood pressure, heart rate , new findings from [ADDRESS_712198] results (biochemistry , hematology , and urinal ysis). 
Clinical laboratory  tests, vital signs, and ECG findings will be summarized by  [CONTACT_103374]. Potentially  clinically  important findings will also be summarized or l
isted.

Subjects are assigned a unique identify ing number; however, their initials and date of birth may  
also be collect ed and used to assist the sponsor to verify  the accuracy  of the data (eg, to confirm 
that laboratory  results have been assigned to the correct subject).
The results of studies –containing subjects’ unique identify ing number, relevant medical 
records, and possibly  initials and dates of birth –will be recorded. They  may  be transferred to, 
and used in, other countries which may  not afford the same level of protection that applies within 
the countries where this study  is conducted. The purpose of an y such tra nsfer would include: to 
support regulatory  submissions, to conduct new data anal yses to publish or present the study  
results, or to answer questions asked by  [CONTACT_1775].
10.5 Study Results/Publication Policy
Shire will endeavor to publish the results of all qualify ing, applicable, and covered studies 
according to external guidelines in a timely  manner regardless of whether the outcomes are 
perceived as positive, neutral, or negative. Additionally , Shire adheres to external guidelines (eg, 
Good Publication Practices 2) when forming a publication steering committee. The purpose of 
the publication steering committee is to act as a non -commercial body  that advises or decides on 
dissemination of scientific study  data in accordance with the scope of this policy .
All publications relating to Shire products or projects must undergo appropriate technical and 
intellectual propert y review, with Shire agreement to publish prior to release of information. The 
review is aimed at protecting the sponsor’s pr oprietary  information existing either at the 
commencement of the study  or generated during the study . To the extent permitted by  [CONTACT_10206], the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_59702] (or share with other authors) the 
copy right on his/her pub lications. To the extent that the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_10159], joint 
or shared rights, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_10160] a perpetual, irrevocable, 
royalty-free license to make and distribute copi[INVESTIGATOR_10161].
The term “publi cation” refers to any public disclosure including original research articles, review 
articles, oral presentations, abstracts and posters at medical congresses, journal supplements, 
letters to the editor, invited lectures, opi[INVESTIGATOR_10162], book chapters, ele ctronic postings on 
medical/scientific websites, or other disclosure of the study  results, in printed, electronic, oral or 
other form.
Subject to the terms of the paragraph below, the investigator shall have the right to publish the 
study  results , and any  background information provided by  [CONTACT_10207] y publication of study results, or necessary for other scholars to verify such stud y 
results. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no publication that incorporates the spo nsor’s 
confidential information shall be submitted for publication without the sponsor’s prior written 
agreement to publish, and shall be given to the sponsor for review at least [ADDRESS_712210] publication of the study results shall be made 
by [CONTACT_10208]’s presentation of a joint, multicenter publication 
of the compi[INVESTIGATOR_10163]. If such a multicenter publication is not submitted to a 
journal for publication by  [CONTACT_385992] n an 18-month period after conclusion, abandonment, 
or termination of the study at all sites, or after the sponsor confirms there shall be no multicenter 
study  publication of the study  results, an investigator may individuall y publish the study results 
from the specific site in accordance with this section. The investigator must, however, 
acknowledge in the publication the limitations of the single -site data being presented.
Unless otherwise required by [CONTACT_10210], or the f orum in which 
it is made, authorship will comply  with the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors 
(ICMJE) current standards. Participation as an investigator does not confer any  rights to

Title:  A Pi[INVESTIGATOR_407237] a Prostate Cancer Vaccine  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_407238] #:  4.0  
Date:  09/22/[ADDRESS_513560] commonly diagnosed cancer in men in the [LOCATION_002]. It 
accounted  for over 218,890 new cases and 27,050 deaths in 2007. Approximately 70% 
of patients will have metastases at some time during the course of their disease. Treatment varies based on stage and grade of the disease from active surveillance, surgery, radiation for early stage disease to hormonal therapy and chemotherapy for more advanced stage.  
A prostate cancer vaccine ( Sipuleucel -T) was approved based on its survival benefit on 
castration resistant patients. In this group of patients there was a 4.1 -month 
improvement in median survival (25.8 months in the sipuleucel -T group vs. 21.7 months 
in the placebo group).  There was no effect on  the time to disease progression (1). 
Sipuleucel -T is an active cellular immunotherapy, a type of therapeutic cancer vaccine 
consisting of autologous peripheral -blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), including 
antigen- presenting cells (APCs), that  have been activated ex vivo with a recombinant 
fusion protein (PA2024). PA2024 consists of a prostate antigen, prostatic acid 
phosphatase, that is fused to granulocyte– macrophage colony -stimulating factor, an 
immune- cell activator.  This treatment although is FDA approved has raised significant 
criticism partly due to its price and modest benefit. Better treatments are urgently needed for patients with prostate cancer.  
The goal of this project is to collect information in regards to the immunogenicity of P SA 
peptides in order to devel op a novel therapeutic vaccine. This vaccine will consist  of 
prostate specific antigen (PSA) peptide and Candida skin test reagent. Candida has 
recently been shown to be a promising new vaccine adjuvant for promoting T -cell 
responses  (2). It can induce interleukin- 12 (promotes T -cell response) secretion by 
[CONTACT_407242], the main antigen presenting cells in skin (3). In a Phase I clinical trial

mediated immunity) in vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]  (4).  
For treating prostate cancer, PSA is an ideal antigen as it is expressed in prostate cancer but not in any other organs. The characteristics of peptides that can effectively be used in therapeutic vaccines are their solubility  in a single solution, 
immunogenicity  in terms of containing large number of T -cell epi[INVESTIGATOR_322] (so the vaccine 
can be used for all patients and not just a few that express certain HLA tissue types), and ability to mature Langerhans cells which in turn promot es T-cell activity.   
In this protocol we focus on the immunogenicity of candidate peptides.

 Study Design  and Procedures  
Sixty ml of whole blood  will be drawn in tubes containing sodium heparin from patients 
(n=10) diagnosed with prostate cancer . Blood will be drawn at the same time patients 
are having routine standard of care labs done. Up to [ADDRESS_513561] been selected for (1) having neutral or positive charges and (2) 
containing <30% hydrophobic residues: PSA 1- 40 (Ac-
MWVPVVFLTLSVTWIGAAPLILSRIVGGWECEKHSQPW QV- NH2), PSA 41 -80 (Ac -
LVASRGRAVCGGVLVHPQWVLTAAHCIRNKSVILLGRHSL -NH2), PSA 161 -200 (Ac -

RWTGGKSTCSGDSGGPLVCNGVLQGITSWGSEPCA LPER P- NH2), PSA 241 -261 
(Ac-SLYTKVVHYRKWIKDTIVANP- NH2).  
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be purified using the ficoll gradient centrifugation method. 96-well plates (MultiScreen- HA; Millipore, Bedford, MA) will be 
coated with 5μg /ml of primary anti -interferon- gamma  monoclonal antibody (Mabtech, 
Stockholm, Sweden) for capture in 50μl/well of phosphate- buffered saline (PBS) and 
stored at 4°C overnight. The plates will be washed four times with PBS and blocked using RPMI 1640 with 5% pooled human serum for 1h at 37°C. Three hundred thousand PBMC per well in triplicate will be presented with 10micro M each of the PSA 
peptides described above.  
Phytohemagglutinin will be used as a positive control while media containing no peptide 
will serve as a negative control. Human recombinant interleukin- 2 (R&D Systems, Inc., 
Minneapolis, MN) (20U/ml) will b e added to all wells. After 40 +/ - 2h incubation at 37°C, 
the plate will be washed four times with PBS containing 0.05% T ween- 20. A total of 
50microl of secondary antibody (biotin- conjugated interferon- γ monoclonal antibody) 
(Mabtech) in PBS at a final concentration of 1microg/ml will be added, and the plate will be incubated for 2h at 37°C. The plate will then be washed four times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween- 20. Avidin- bound biotinylated horseradish peroxidase H 
(Vectastain Elite ABC kit; Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) will be added for 1h at 37°C. After four washings with PBS containing 0.1% Tween- 20, stable 
diaminobenzene (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL) will be added to develop the reaction. The plates will be washed with distilled water three times and air -dried 
overnight.  
The spots formed by [CONTACT_14234]- gamma -secreting T -cells will be counted with an 
automated ELISPOT analyzer (AID ELISPOT Classic Reader; Autoimmun Diagnostika 
GmbH, Strassberg, [LOCATION_013]). The average spot -forming units (SFU) per antigen will be 
calculated. A response will be considered positive when the average SFU in wells with a given peptide was at least twice that of the average SFU in the no- peptide control wells.  
Data analysis: Number of patients testing positive for each PSA peptide will be described. The statistical significance of the response will be assessed using paired t -
test co mparing SFU in peptide containing wells and those in no- peptide wells.

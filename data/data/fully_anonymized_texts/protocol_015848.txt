ABSTRACT  
Context : (Background)   
Treatment for pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome 
(MDS) involves intensive chemotherapy regimens  that result in periods of profound 
neutropenia leaving  patients susceptible to severe infectious complications.  Infectious 
complications are the leading cause of treatment related mortality among AML and MDS 
patients, but there are little clinical data to inform  whether management of neutropenia post 
AML chemotherapy should occur in an outpatient or inpatient setting .  
Objectives :  
The primary objective of this study is to compare the clinical effectiveness of outpatient 
versus inpatient management of neu tropenia in children with AML  or MDS receiving 
standard intensive AML frontline chemotherapy . 
Study Design :  
This i s a bidirectional observational cohort  study .  
Setting/Participants:  
Participants will be less than 19  years of age  at their initial AML or MDS diagnosis 
receiving  or having received  frontline AML chemotherapy from seventeen participating 
pediatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_747385] (US) . We anticipate that a pproximately  540 
subjects  will be ev aluable for chart abstraction over the study period in order to study  
clinical outcomes  including the occurrence of bacteremia and time to the start of the nex t 
course in the  chemotherapy  regimen , in relation to  neutropenia management strategy.    
Study Interventions and Measures :  
There is no study intervention.  Main outcomes include occurrences of b acteremia  after 
completion of an AML chemotherapy  course , and time from completion of one course  to the 
next planned course of  chemotherapy .

1 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON AND RATIONALE   
1.1 Introduction  
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the second most common pediatric hematologic 
malignancy with approximately 600 new cases per year among patients  under 20 years of 
age.  Although AML  accounts for only about 20% of leukemias  in children, it is responsible 
for more than half of pediatric leukemia deaths (1).  
All pediatric patients with newly diagnosed AML receive multiple consecutive courses of 
intensive myelosuppressive chemotherapy aimed to attain complete remission (induct ion) 
and to prevent relapse (intensification) ( 2). Each regimen is followed by a period of 
prolonged severe neutropenia during which patients are at high risk for infection and 
hemorrhage.  Previous reports have found that 57 -80% of febrile neutropenia epi [INVESTIGATOR_747386] ( 3, 4) with bacteremia constituting the most prevalent infection ( 5). 
These infectious complications remain a major cause of therapy -associated morbid ity and 
mortality in children with AML ( 6, 7). 
Recently p ublished pediatric neutropenia guidelines make no specific recommendations 
regarding discharge  from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_747387] “ there are no 
validated schemas for defining those pati ents at high -risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_747388]”  (8). As a result , clinicians are left to decide whether to keep  a child  
in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_747389]  (on average 35 days)  or discharge  a child  to 
outpatient managemen t within a few days of chemotherapy completion with instructions to 
return if symptoms of infection develop. Physicians that elect to observe patients  with 
neutropenia in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_747390] k of serious infection and thereby [CONTACT_747405].  There is documented variation in practice across Children’s Oncology 
Group (COG) institutions on inpatient versus outpatient management of neutropenia with 
appro ximately 60% of COG institutions reporting a policy to always keep patients 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_747391] 40% of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_747392] a policy of home management some or all of the time ( 9, 10).  This variation in 
practi ce highlights the need for additional data on clinician -centered outcomes to 
appropriately guide the management of neutropenia in pediatric AML patients.    
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are a rare heterogenous group of hemopoietic clonal 
disorders chara cterized by [CONTACT_747406]. 
Children with clinical and morphological features of MDS but with the cytogenetic features 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_747393]  (23). Thus, questions regarding clinician -centered and patient -centered outcomes in 
relation to outpatient versus inpatient management of neutropenia would apply equally to 
such patients.  
1.2 Relevant Literature and Data   
The limited literature on the clinical consequences of outpatient versus inpatient 
management of neutropenia in AML is focused on the experience of adult patients. Adult 
   
   
   2 
patients discharged early to outpatient supportive care consistently had shorter cumul ative 
lengths of stay than inpatients (1 1-18). Additionally, early discharge of adult AML patients 
receiving chemotherapy has been associated with fewer and shorter febrile epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] ( 15, 
19), a better response to first line antibiotics, and shorter duratio n of intravenous antibiotic 
administration (1 3, 15, 18, 19). While these adult studies provide some reassurance that 
outpatient management may be safe and feasible  they are limited  as most included data from 
only a single institution, had very small sample  sizes, or lacked an appropriate inpatient 
reference population. Furthermore, it is not appropriate to extrapolate these adult findings to 
pediatric patients as the risk profile for children may be much different.  
The published literature with respect to outpatient management of neutropenia in pediatric 
AML is limited to a single study of only 13 patients from one hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], which found similar 
rates of relapse and mortality for outpatient versus inpatient management of neutropenia 
(20).  In our own prelimi nary analyses based on administrative resource utilization data from 
43 free -standing children’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313711], we found that patients who were discharged 
early to outpatient management following AML induction and intensification chemotherapy 
courses  incurred fewer cumulative days of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but were frequently readmitted 
and had higher rates of antibiotic, vasopressor, and supplemental oxygen utilization than 
patients who remained inpatient during the entirety of their neutropenia. In the ab sence of 
clinical data and laboratory confirmation, it is unclear whether these observed increases in 
resource utilization are an accurate proxy for a greater incidence of infection or more severe 
infection in the early discharge patients.  
In order to appr opriately  inform the decision for outpatient versus inpatient management of 
neutropenia associated with pediatric AML chemotherapy, a comprehensive study that 
collects  pertinent clinical outcomes is necessary.  Given that  infectious complications are the 
leading cause of treatment related mortality among AML patients ( 22) and among MDS 
patients  (24, 25) , identifying such a  neutropenia management strategy that leads  to the best 
clinical  outcomes will have a substantial impact on care of these patients.   
Bacteremia , a cause of transient cardiac decline, occurs frequently during AML treatment 
and contributes to the development of cardiac dysfunction. (26) COG guidelines for re -
challe nging patients to anthracycline chemotherapy  distinguish infection -associate d LV  
systolic dysfunction  (LVSD) from LVSD not associated with infection, allowing patients 
who experience resolution of infection -associated LVSD to receive additional anthracycline 
therapy. However, there are no data comparing the longitudinal trajectori es of EF/SF or the 
impacts on subsequent cardiomyopathy and treatment outcomes for  these distinct 
presentations of cardiotoxicity.  
1.3 Compliance Statement  
This study will be conducted in full accordance  with all applicable Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5765] 45 CFR 46 . All epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] s of noncompliance will be documented.  
The investigators will perform the study in accordance with this protocol and will report 
unan ticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others  in accordance with The 
Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_747394]

3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 General Schema of Study Design  
This observational cohort study  will evaluate clinical  outcomes of inpatient versus outpatient 
management of neutropenia following chemotherapy in children with AML  or MDS by 
[CONTACT_747407] . 
3.2 Study Duration, Enrollment and Number of Sites  
The study plans to include  patients treated for AML or MDS anytime from January 1, 2012  
or after .    
3.3 Total Number of Study Sites/Total Number of Subjects Projected  
3.3.[ADDRESS_1022608] is necessary for this study; only medical record abstraction. The 
chart abstraction window for each participant will include  the time period from the start of 
the first course of chemotherapy until the date of last patient contact  [CONTACT_634385] .

3.3.2 Total Number of Study Sites/Total Number of Subjects Projected  
Chart abstraction w ill be  conducted at the following seventeen  US investigative sites : Ann 
Arbor  (C.S. Mott Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ), Atlanta ( Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta ), Chicago  
(Ann & Robert H Lurie Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7726] ), Dallas ( Children’s Medical Center 
of Dallas  – University of [LOCATION_007] Southwestern Medical Center ), Detroit (Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_747395]) , Houston ( [LOCATION_007] Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ), Jackson (Children’s of Mississippi) , 
Little Rock ( Arkansas Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ), New Orleans  (Ochsner Medical Center for 
Children ), Palo Alto ( Lucile Packard Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_747396] ), Philadelphia  
(Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684] ), Salt Lake City ( Primary Children’s Medical Center ), 
San Diego ( Rady Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ), Seattle ( Seattle Childr en’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ), Denver 
(Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_200931]),  Nemours/A.I. duPont Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7722] , and 
DFCI/[LOCATION_011] Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ( [LOCATION_011], MA ). These sites were chosen  based on 
geographic location , their substantial AML /MDS  patient volume,  and the  variation in 
primary strategy  of neutropenia management (inpatient versus outpatient).   
We expect to identify a total of approximately 600 newly diagnosed AML patients across 
the seventeen participating institutions over the study period of which approxima tely 540 are 
expected to meet early discharge eligibility criteria.  
3.4 Study Population  
The study population will include all AML and MDS patients who received  or will receive  
chemotherapy starting  January 1, 2012 at any of the seventeen participating pe diatric 
institutions across the US. Patients discharged within 3 days after completion  of that 
chemotherapy course  will be categorized as ‘early discharge’ to outpatient management 
during neutropenia. Patients meeting eligibility criteria for ‘early discha rge’ but remaining 
in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_747397] 3 days after  completion of that  chemotherapy course will be 
categorized as inpatient management. Patients will be considered early discharge -eligible if 
there is no evidence of fever, infection or intensive care  unit (ICU) level care within ± [ADDRESS_1022609] dose of chemotherapy.

4 STUDY PROCEDURES  
4.1 Aim 1  
The only study procedure for this cohort  is chart abstraction; thus, there will be  no study 
visits or other patient contact [CONTACT_747408].  
4.1.1 Retrospective Patient Identification :  
Local study investigators (pediatric oncologists and study coordinators) at each of the 
seventeen  participating pediatric institutions will review their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_747398] 1, 2012 through the date of IRB approval  that meet 
enrollment criteria .  
4.1.2 Prospective patient identification : 
The prospective data abstraction timeline begin s the date of  IRB approval and  lasts through 
the duration of the study . Study investigators at each institution will communicate on a 
weekly  basis with their inpatient leukemia service to identify AML or MDS patients 
potentially eligible for study enrollment . Once identified, study personnel will review each 
patient for study eligibility criteria.  
4.1.[ADDRESS_1022610] abstraction remotely for sites 
who grant CHOP remote EMR access. All data will be abstracted directly into REDCap™  
via standardized electronic case report forms developed by [CONTACT_747409] . Details 
on data to be abstracted from the medical record are included in sections 5.[ADDRESS_1022611] Completion/Withdrawal  
This is an analysis of data that are documented in the course of providing clinical care to 
subjects. As there are no additional interventions necessary for the execution of this study 
and we do not foresee any adverse effects stemming from the research , a waiver of consent 
will be submitted to address  the issue of subject withdrawal.

6 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
6.1 Primary Endpoint  
The p rimary outcomes  will include the following  two endpoints  (ascertained from patient 
medical records):  
1.) Occurrence of post -chemotherapy  bacteremia  
Identification of bacteremia will begin three days after completion of a 
chemotherapy course  and will continue until recovery of neutrophil count (ANC > 
200 L), or until the start of the next course (for a very small number of patients who 
begin the next course of chemotherapy prior to count recovery). Bacterem ia will be 
defined as a single positive blood culture for a bacterial pathogen (including Viridans 
group Streptococci). If the bacterium is an organism considered as a common 
commensal organism by [CONTACT_295931], two separate 
positi ve blood cultures will be required fo r classification as bacteremia.  
 
2.) Time to the initiation of the next chemothe rapy course  
Time to next course of chemotherapy will be measured as the number of days from 
the three days after the completion chemotherapy i n a given course until  the first day 
of the next course.  
 
6.[ADDRESS_1022614] threshold for discharge 
classification (e.g., [ADDRESS_1022615] -chemot herapy).  
   
   
   [ADDRESS_1022616]. Next, propensity scores will be derived from the predicted probabilities estimated 
from logistic regression models of the us e of outpatient versus inpatient management during 
neutropenia conditional on all baseline factors determined to be true confounders (i.e., those 
associated with both exposure and outcome) and those determined to be potential 
confounders (i.e., those assoc iated only with the outcome interests).  Patients will then be 
stratified into five groups using quintiles of the estimated propensity score. The distributions 
of exposure within the quintiles will be examined for sufficient sample sizes and balance. 
Withi n each stratum, the patients managed as outpatient and those managed as inpatient will 
ideally have similar values of the propensity score and likewise the distribution of measured 
baseline covariates will be comparable between them.  
Log-binomial regressio n will be used to estimate risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals 
(CI) comparing the incidence of bacteremia following outpatient versus inpatient 
neutropenia management strategy. Control for confounding will be accomplished through 
adjustment for prope nsity score by [CONTACT_747411] - or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -level confounders.  
Generalized linear regression models will be utilized to compare time (in days) from three 
days after completion of one chemotherapy  course  to initiation of the next course of 
chemotherapy by [CONTACT_747412] (outpatient versus inpatient). Before 
model fitting, the normality of the outcome will be assessed. If the normality assumption 
holds, then traditional linear models (normal distribution  with an identity link) will be 
utilized. If the distribution of time to next course is significantly skewed, then models 
assuming a gamma or log -normal distribution as appropriate will be used.  Again, control 
for confounding will be accomplished through adjustment for propensity score by [CONTACT_747413].  
Although there will be  limited power to quantify heterogeneity of effects across strata of 
covariates, hypothesis -generating subanalyses  will be performed  to eva luate the potential for 
effect measure modification (on both absolute and relative scales) by [CONTACT_654], race, and 
insurance status (as a proxy for socioeconomic status) via stratification to inform future 
studies.   
6.3.[ADDRESS_1022617] clusters of individuals based on development, progression, and resolution 
patterns pertaining to the repeated measures of a given variable. The following factors will 
be explored as predictors identified trajectory phenotypes: age , gender, race, ethnicity, 
weight group, presenting white blood cell count, and baseline EF/SF. Univariate and 
   
   
   9 
multivariable mixed effects regression models will be fitted to quantify the association 
between bacteremia and longitudinal EF and SF measuremen ts. 
6.4 Sample Size and Power  
Assuming 100% capture of eligible patient s (waivers of consent obtained from all 
participating sites) , we expect to identify a total of 600 newly diagnosed AML /MDS  patients 
across the seventeen  participating centers. Assuming 90% of identified patients will be early 
discharge eligible, the anticipated study population will be 540 patients. Based on the rates 
for the individual participating sites, approximately 27% of the study population will be  
managed as outpatients (n=  146) and the remaining will be managed as inpatients (n= 394) 
during neutropenia. Assuming a baseline risk of bacteremia of 60%, the proposed size of the 
two study arms would provide greater than 80% power to detect a 13% differe nce in 
bacteremia rates among p atients managed as outpatients versus  those that remain 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], with a significance level of 0.05. A 13% difference in bacteremia rates would 
also be a clinically significant difference.  For time to next chemotherapy c ourse, we used a 
two sample t -test in the power calculation to be conservative (i.e., statistical analysis using a 
generalized linear model with correct distribution will result in creased power over a t -test). 
Assuming each patient contributes one treatme nt course and an average time to next 
chemotherapy course of [ADDRESS_1022618] deviation (SD) of 10 (based on preliminary 
data), our study will have 85.0% power to detect a difference of [ADDRESS_1022619] review, there is no possibility of a clinical adverse event  (AEs) .  
7.2 Adverse Event Reporting  
Since the study procedures are not greater than minimal risk, SAEs are not expected. If an y 
unanticipated problems related to the research involving risks to subjects or others happen 
during the course of this study (including SAEs) these will be reported to the IRB in 
accordance with CHOP IRB SOP 408: Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects. 
AEs that are not serious but that are notable and could involve risks to subjects will be 
summarized in narrative or other format and submitted to the IRB at the time of continuing 
review.  
 
[ADDRESS_1022620] data will be abstracted directly into electronic case report forms via 
REDCap™, a secure, web -based application designed exclusively to support data capture 
for research studies. We will utilize REDCap™, automated export processes to seamlessly 
   
   
   [ADDRESS_1022621] linking each patient’s 
unique study identification number to the ir medical record number. These site master lists 
will be stored in password -protected file s that are only accessible by [CONTACT_747414] .  Identifiers will be destroyed after publication.  Access to identifiable information 
by [CONTACT_431], programmers, analyst, and statisticians will be kept to the minimum 
necessary mandated by [CONTACT_412438]. Coded, limited data sets  will be shared with 
participating sites upon approved request, as specified in Section 8.2. Only aggregate level 
data will  be shared with the study sponsor PCORI . 
8.1.1 Data sources  
Patients’ electronic medical records will be queried for demographic information, clinical 
information, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] /discharge dates.   The complete list of variables is 
detailed in Section [ADDRESS_1022622] obtaining IRB 
approval. The investigator will obtain a data use agreement between provider (the PI) and 
any recipi[INVESTIGATOR_5772] (including others at  CHOP) before sharing a limited dataset (dates 
and zip codes).  Safeguards to protect confidentiality were described in Section 8.[ADDRESS_1022623] linking 
each patient’s unique study identification number to their medical record number. These site 
master lists will be stored in password -protected files that are only accessible by [CONTACT_305220] 
   
   
   [ADDRESS_1022624], and statisticians will be kept to the minimum necessar y 
mandated by [CONTACT_747415]. Any publications or 
present ations resulting from this work will not identify participants by [CONTACT_2300], but will only 
present aggregate data. Our prior research employing similar precautions has demonstrated 
that these techniques are very successful in assuring the protection of subjects .  
8.3.3 Potential Benefits of Study Participation  
The patients involved in the s tudy might not benefit directly.  Results from the study may be 
applied in the future to AML /MDS  patients in making decisions about the best way to 
manage neutropenia. Improved under standing of the outcomes of outpatient versus inpatient 
management of neutropenia will be of great importance to AML /MDS  patients and the 
providers who care for them .  
8.3.[ADDRESS_1022625] to the knowledge that may result from the 
research . 
8.4 Recruitment Strategy  
No advertisi ng will be done for this study.  Local study investigators (pediatric oncologists 
and study coordinators) will review their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s AML registry to identify newly 
diagnosed AML and MDS patients in the retrospective period of the study . For the 
prospectiv e component, local study investigators will identify newly diagnosed AML /MDS  
patients from  weekly communications with the local inpatient leukemia service .  
8.5 Informed Consent/Assent  and HIPAA Authorization  
8.5.[ADDRESS_1022626] information for study personnel. Families w ill be informed their 
medical care at that healthcare facility  will not be affected if they choose not to partic ipate in 
   
   
   12 
the proposed research.  Any site -required i nformed consent/assent and HIPAA 
Authorization will take place in a quiet, private space to ensure confidentiality, the family 
will be provided ample time to make an informed and thoughtful decision , and the signed 
document will be maintained at the local site in a secure location .   
8.5.[ADDRESS_1022627] 
information is not available. This is an observational study and thus c omplete capture of all 
events is ideal to ensure accurate and unbiased results.   
8.6 Payment to Subjects/Families  
There will be no r eimbursement or gifts supplied to patients in this study.  
 
9 PUBLICATION  
The results of this study will be prepared and submitted to peer -reviewed journals.  The

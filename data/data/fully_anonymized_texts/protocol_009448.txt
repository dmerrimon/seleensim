sent to a central location for review by [CONTACT_5551].  
The PEDS: DM -AL is a validated surveillance and 
screening tool for children 0- 8 years of age, designed for 
developmental follow -up. The tool enables a detailed 
look at each developmental domain (e.g. expressive language, receptive language, fine motor, gross motor 
and social -emotional). Researchers note that the tool 
has a high internal consistency, test -retest reliability and 
a high level of concordance between caregiver report 
and professional or paraprofessional assessment. The 
tool is also noted to have a sensitivity (85%) and specificity (89%) for infants between [ADDRESS_4926] consistency between NOWS protocols.

The analysis team will calculate descriptive statistics 
(mean ± SD) for each domain in the PEDS: DM- AL (i.e., 
expressive language, receptive language, fine motor, gross motor and social -emotional) separately for each 
treatment group. To compare the PEDS: DM- AL 
composite scores between two intervention groups, we 
will perform a linear mixed- effects model with a fixed 
effect for the intervention group and a random effect for study site. We will report point estimates for  the group 
mean difference along with a 95% CI, and the team will 
repeat this analytical approach for each of the PEDS:

Protocol Version #: 08    Date: 28-March -[ADDRESS_4939]  
1.1. PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS   
Among infants evaluated for n eonatal opi[INVESTIGATOR_5400]  (NOWS ), the Eating, Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
Consoling (ESC) care  approach will reduce the length of time until infants are medically ready for 
discharge by [CONTACT_5554] 4  days , as compared to  usual institutional care  with the Finnegan Neonatal 
Abstinence Scoring Tool (FNAST) or modification thereof . 
 
1.2. SECONDARY HYPOTHESIS   
Among infants evaluated for NOWS, use of the ESC c are approach will result in an improvement in 
infant neurobehavio ral functioning and family well- being, when compared to usual institutional care  
with the FNAST or modification thereof.  
 
1.3. STUDY DESIGN  TYPE   
In this stepped- wedge cluster randomized  controlled trial with transition period , the protocol study 
team will compare  the ESC care approach to usual institutional care  with the  FNAST or modification 
thereof . Randomization will occur at the site level. The protocol study team will randomize 
approximately  24 sites  into 8 blocks. Each block will transition from usual care to the ESC care 
approach for the evaluation and management of all infants with NOWS at various time intervals (see 
Table 1). Sites will use the care approach randomly assigned to their block during each  study period for 
the evaluation and management of all infants with NOWS  cared for at the site . During the initial birth 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the site research team will collect data under waiver of consent for infants who meet 
eligibility criteria (see Section  4.1). The number of infants enrolled per period at each site will vary 
throughout the study , due to fluctuations in the number of infants managed for NOWS  at each site 
during each period . However, the goal  is for each site to enroll at least  4 infants per period. The site 
research team will obtain informed consent from the legal guardian(s) to obtain long -term outcomes 
for eligible infants and caregivers. Site research team members may obtain t his consent at any point 
during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5401]’s inclusion criteria.

1.5. STUDY INTERVENTION/M ETHODS  
The protocol study team will randomize sites into study blocks with each block transitioning from usual 
care to the  ESC c are approach at a randomly allocated transition period . The protocol study team will  
compare short - and long -term outcomes for infants managed with the ESC care approach compared to 
usual institutional care . During the usual  care period s, sites will evaluate  and manage infants using the 
usual institutional practices and protocols for the assessment of withdrawal severity and management 
of infants with NOWS.  After  a site ’s transition to the ESC care approach, each site will use the ESC Care 
Tool for the assessment of withdrawal severity and management of infants with NOWS ( see Manual of 
Procedures [MOP ]). If needed, d uring both the usual care and ESC interventions,  site preference will 
determine the opi[INVESTIGATOR_5409] y, as well as the adjuvant therapy  used . After  completion of 
inpatient monitoring and management for NOWS, t he clinical team members will discharge infants 
based on their usual practice. The site research team will review the medical record and data collection  
forms to assess the time (days) from birth until the infant was medically ready for discharge . We defin e 
medically ready for discharge as  the point at which the infant me ets ALL of the following criteria :  
• ≥ 96 hours life 
• Off of opi[INVESTIGATOR_5402] (e.g. morphine, methadone, or buprenorphine) for

• Receiving  no respi[INVESTIGATOR_5410] ≥  [ADDRESS_4942] s of all eligible infants  
(under waiver of consent ) for the composite  safety outcome  and the critical safety outcome  during the 
first months of life.

Protocol Version #: 08    Date: 28-March -2022 Primary caregivers  who provide informed consent  will complete  multiple questionnaires  between 
discharge and 24 months of age and will return at the end of the study for an in -person visit for 
assessment of infant neurodevelopment and growth  (see Table 4, Study Event Schedule) . The 
questionnaires will assess infant wellness, neurobehavioral  functioning and development, postnatal 
attachment and bonding, caregiver well -being , and family environment.  If the primary caregiver for the 
infant changes during the study period, the new caregiver will provide consent and complete the 
questionnaires , and the site research team will note the change in caregiver.

[IP_ADDRESS].  Initial  Eating, Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], Consoling  Approach  
The ESC approach, an approach  that emphasizes parental involvement, simplifies  the assessme nt of 
infants with NOWS , and focuses interventions on non-pharmacologic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , began its evolution  at 
Yale -New Haven Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5429] a 5 -year period  of QI work.  During this time , the proportion of 
infants prenatally  exposed to methadone who received  pharmacologic treatment for NOWS decreased 
significantly from 98% (54 out of 55 infants ) in the baseline period (January 2008 -February 2010) to 
14% (6 out of 44  infants ) in the post- intervention period (May 2015 -June 2016) , P < 0.001.  The average 
length of stay (LOS) for these infants also decreased significantly from 22 to 6 days ( P < 0.001) .[ADDRESS_4951] -intervention group.  Although the results 
of this QI work appear quite impressive, it is  unclear how generalizable this work is , as the pre-
intervention rate of pharmacologic treatment was much higher than national estimates at 98% of 
methadone -exposed infants .5 Additionally many infant s with NOWS are expo sed to opi[INVESTIGATOR_5430] (e.g. , buprenorphine and illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]).  
On direct comparison, Yale -New Haven’s ESC  approach , studied as a QI  measure , appears to trigger the 
initiation of opi[INVESTIGATOR_5431]. 
The Yale group, following their transition to ESC-based assessments, completed a retrospective 
comparison of treatment decisions for 50 consecutive opi[INVESTIGATOR_5432] ( March  2014- Aug 
2015) .[ADDRESS_4952]  scores recorded every 2  to 6 hours , but clinical personnel managed  
these infants  based on the ir ESC assessments alone . Management decisions based on the ESC 
assessment  resulted in morphine initiation for 6 infants (12%) , compared with 31 infants (62%) who 
medical professionals would have treated using the FNAST  (P < 0.001). Additionally, using  the ESC-
based assessments,  medical personnel initiated or increased morphine on 8 patient days ( 3%), 
compared with 76 patient days  (26%) predicted using the FNAST  (P < 0.001) .27 Again, the study 
reported no readmissions or adverse events  (AEs).  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Eating, Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], Consoling  Care Tool  Development  
Other groups have subsequently worked to standardize implementation of the  assessment and 
management components  of the  ESC care approach , through the development and testing of a  formal 
ESC Care Tool. Initial evaluation of the assessment  component of the ESC Care Tool, using standardized 
training and simulated case scenarios , has  demonstrated high inter - and intra -rater reliability .28 
Training in the use of the ESC Care T ool and the overall care approach,  with standardized training

found a decrease in pharmacologic treatment from 87% to 40% and a reduction in LOS  from 17 to 
11 days , with no AE s noted .29  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Further Study  
Although outcomes following implementation of the ESC care approach, inclusive of the ESC Care Tool, 
appear p romising and initial accounts suggest that it is safe , we need to rigorous ly study this care 
approach to show safety , efficacy, and generalizability  of its use i n the care of infants with NOWS.  
Reports on the ESC care approach to date have  been from hosp itals where the majority of the mothers 
are compliant with medication -assisted treatment and are highly motivated to care for their infants.  
Furthermore , the potential effects of  the care provided , using the ESC care approach , on infant and 
family well-being after  discharge  are unknown  and important to assess .6, 30 In the proposed trial,  
comparison of the short-  and long -term outcomes for infants managed with the ESC care  approach  
versus those managed with usual care  will move us closer to an evidence -based approach for the 
evaluation and management of infants with NOWS, thus meeting a top research priority in  the field .6, 7  
Justification of Hypotheses 
• We hypothesi ze that use of the ESC c are approach for the evaluation and management of 
infants with NOWS will safely reduce the average length of time until infants are medically 
ready for discharge , compared with usual care  with the FNAST  or modification thereof . We 
selected the primary outcome, average length of time until infants are medically  ready for 
discharge , due to the potential for infants to remain in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5435] a reduction 
in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5436]:  
o Improved maternal and infant attachment/bonding31, [ADDRESS_4954] on 
infant safety, while result ing in the following outcomes : 
• Reduction in the need for initiation o f opi[INVESTIGATOR_5402]  (i.e., morphine, methadone , 
or buprenorphine)  
• Decrease in the  total postnatal opi[INVESTIGATOR_5437]  
• Improvement in the timeliness to initiation of opi[INVESTIGATOR_5438] , when required  
• Decrease in the need for adjuvant therapy  
• Increase in the proportion of infants who directly breastfeed  
• Increase  in the  proportion of infants receiving their mothers ’ own breastmilk   
We also hypothesize that use of the ESC c are approach will improve postnatal attachment and 
bonding , and will enhance infant well -being  and neuro behavioral functioning and development 
compared  to usual care. Further, we hypothesize that use of the ESC care approach will enhance

Protocol Version #: 08    Date: 28-March -2022 maternal well-being  and the family environment  after  discharge . An important  component of the ESC 
care approach is  the reported fostering of a collaborative relationship between the primary 
caregiver( s) and the inpatient clinical team through the co -assessment of the infant’s severity of 
withdrawal and shared treatment  plan development. Interviews conducted with families as part of the 
QI implementation of the ESC Care Tool consistently suggest that this element may re duce the social 
and emotional impact of the infant’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5439]. However, w hile many families 
expressed feeling like they were an integral part of their infants’ care team and reported decreased 
anxiety and reduction in stigma  during the  initial birth hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ,34 these families were poised to 
actively participate in the care of their infants , and such results may not be consiste nt across all 
families /caregivers . Thus, we must conside r that families /caregivers  who are not as well poised to  
actively participate in the care of their infants may experience more st ress if their infants are 
discharge d home earlier.   
Our a ssessment of key markers of infant and family well -being  in the subpopulation of inf ants whose 
caregiver(s) provide  informed consent will allow for further insight into safety. This will also provide an  
opportunity to examine not only often- assessed interm ediate outcome variables ( time until medically 
ready for discharge  and need for opi[INVESTIGATOR_5438] ), but also to examine long er-term 
outcomes , such  as infant neurobehavioral functioning and development, maternal -infant attachment 
and bonding , and f amily well-being  and functioning.   
Justification of Study Design  
The protocol study team selected a stepped -wedge cluster design due to three  main considerations:  
1. Transition to the ESC care approach requires a significant cultural shift in the management of 
infants with NOWS. This type of cultural change is most effective when applied at the level of the population covered by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_5440] a subset of random infants with NOWS within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , thus making a cluster study design important.  
2. Interim analysis of the ACT  NOW Current Experience study allowed for  estimation of  an 
intracluster correlation coefficient  (ICC) based on the LOS outcome measure . Using LOS as a 
proxy for our primary outcome, time until infant is medically ready for discharge , the number of 
sites required to adequately power the trial based on a parallel cluster design with estimated 
ICC=0.25  would be  prohibitive. The stepped wedge design makes the study feasible by [CONTACT_5560] o wn control in a pre/post analysis  and thus , the variation between sites 
is of less statistical significance .  
3. Additionally, t he results of QI projects  have inspi[INVESTIGATOR_5441]. A brief questionnaire, sent to i nvestigators at the available 
study sites, demonstrated an increased willingness to participate in the trial if we integrated a transition to the ESC care approach into the study design.  
 For these reasons , the protocol study team has designed a stepped -wedge cluster randomized trial 
with the intervention applied at a cluster level and applied to all participating site s by [CONTACT_2671] 
20-month  study period, with the timing of transition to ESC randomized.  This study de sign also allows 
for differentiation between the effect of the intervention and unanticipated  time -related confounders.

4.2.1.  Screening  
The protocol study team will screen i nterested sites  for eligibility , and  will randomize eligible s ites into 
one of 8  blocks , as illustrated in Table 1. With this study d esign, all infants with NOWS cared for at a 
site, will be evaluated and managed using the care approach that the site is assigned to during the 
study period. Therefore, individual infant  screening will not be required befo re initiation of th is study  
protocol. The process will be as follows (see Figure 1), after  birth  the inpatient clinical team will assess 
infants  as at risk for NOWS and initiate management for NOWS based on the site’s usual methods of 
identification . The initiation of clinical management for infants with NOWS will not be impacted by [CONTACT_5562]. The site research team will id entify potential participants for  the trial based on 
their eligibility following review of the medical record after delivery. The site research team may obtain 
informed consent for infant and caregiver participation in the long -term outcomes portion of the study 
at any point during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5401]’s inclusion criteria.  The site research 
team will evaluate for exclusion criteria (Section  4.1) after the infant’s first [ADDRESS_4957] additional data for these infants . Sites may enroll up to 16 infants per period; screen fails are 
not included in this total. Only infants enrolled in the study may be approached  for consent and 
included in the long -term follow -up study.

Protocol Version #: 08    Date: 28-March -2022 4.2.2.  Consent Procedures  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Waiver of Consent  
Since this study is a stepped -wedge cluster  randomized  controlled trial,  the intervention will take place 
on a site -wide basis  and sites will transition  their practice for  all infants  with NOWS  care d for at the site 
during the study  period . Thus, we will request a waiver of consent  from the central institutional review 
board ( IRB) at the University of A rkansas for Medical Sciences  for the primary outcome a nd previously 
outlined short -term  secondary outcomes. There is debate in the clinical trial and ethics literature about 
the issue of individual consent for cluster -randomized  trials. However, in general, a study may proceed 
without individual consent if co nditions for a waiver of consent are satisfied and participants (or legally 
authorized representatives) are provided with a description of the intervention to which their cluster 
has been randomized .35  
As stated in C ode of Federal Regulations  [45 CFR 46.116 (d) ], an IRB may approve a consent procedure 
that does not include, or that alters, some or all of the elements of informed consent set forth in this 
section, or waive the requirements to obtain informed consent , provided the IRB finds and documents 
that all of the following conditions are met :  
1. The research  involves no more than minimal risk  to the participants ;  
2. The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the participants ;  
3. The research  could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration; and  
4. Whenever appropriate, the study team will provide participants  with additional pertinent 
information after participation . 
The justification for a waiver of informed consent from caregiver( s) for the previously outlined short -
term outcomes (see Table 2) meets the above criteria per the following:   
1. The research  involves no more than minimal risk  to the  participants .  
Both  usual care using the FNAST and the ESC care approaches are currently used at sites across 
the country, and the optimal care approach for the management of infants with NOWS is unknown. Additionally, there  are no study procedures or study interventions within this 
protocol that would qualify as more than minimal risk , based on federal regulations , for either 
intervention group.   
2. The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the participants .  
As the best management for infants with NOWS is  unknown, there is no universally accepted 
standard of care , and both care approaches are currently being used at sites across the country.  
Therefore, participants  receiving care via either model should not have their rights and welfare 
adversely affected.   
3. The site research  team could not practicably carry  out this trial without the waiver or alteration .  
Carrying out this trial and obtaining generalizable results would not be feasible if obtaining 
informed consent were required.  Obtaining informed consent from legally authorized 
representatives of infants in this population is difficult due to multiple factors. The 
interventions conducted in this study begin shortly after birth and recrui tment during this 
vulnerable period can be extremely difficult. Researchers have experienced t his difficulty in a

Protocol Version #: 08    Date: 28-March -[ADDRESS_4958] failed to successfully recruit this population shortly after birth.36, 37, 38 
Seeking cons ent shortly after delivery may  not only result in recruitment failure , but may result 
in achieving consent only among a less generalizable g roup of “responders”, which may 
introduce bias and diminish generalizability . This could  be particularly problematic in this trial 
where the success of the intervention may be particularly susceptible to caregiver effort and 
engagement.  
Seeking consent later in the  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5450] -term follow -up portion of the study will 
allow for relationship  and trust building  between the consenting member of the site research 
team and the primary caregiver( s). This will likely allow for improved consent rates  and 
improved generalizability. If consenting members of the site research team sought early 
consent and only a group of “responders” were consented, it is unclear whether this would 
have a differential impact across the study interventions . Additionally, the intervention is 
instituted at the site level and will represent a culture change . The site will use the assigned 
approach  to care for all infants with NOWS during the trial period . Therefore, i f consent w ere 
required, obtaining consent would not alter the care approach used for the infant. Thus, the 
benefits afforded by [CONTACT_2329] a waiver of consent outweigh the risks to the  infant receiving the 
same management . If the clinical team used two different care models  at the same time and at 
the same site, patient safety could be at risk and care potentially compromised due to the use 
of inconsistent care practices at the site.  
4. Whenever appropriate the study team will provide participants with additional pertinent 
information after participation.  
Throughout the study,  the site research team will provide participants  with additional pertinent 
information  when appropriate . The protocol study team will develop a handout  that the site 
research team will (a) give to the caregiver(s) of all infant s with NOWS care d for at the site  
throughout the study period and/or (b) post (as an enlarged copy ) in appropriate location(s)  
readily visible to caregivers . This will fulfill the suggested framework35 of participants  being 
“provided with a detailed description of the interventions to which their cluster has been 
randomized .”  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Consent for Assessment of Long -term Outcomes  
Members of the site research team will work with families /caregivers  to obtain informed co nsent for : 
1) parent/ caregiver questionnaires  that will assess caregiver well- being (e.g. , parenting stress, 
attachment and bonding, depression, anxie ty, etc.) and infant well -being (e. g., diet, sleep,  
neuro behavioral functioning , etc.), and 2) in -person follow -up visit at 24 months to assess 
neurodevelopmental outcomes  and growth measures . Consent will contain basic information on 
recognition and support (consistent with regulatory require ments at each site) for mental health issues 
including suicidality among caregivers . The consent will also contain basic information on notification 
of child protective services  (consistent with state law) should researchers or members of the clinical 
team have suspi[INVESTIGATOR_5451] . The site research team will obtain written, informed 
consent from primary caregiver( s) (e.g.,  biological parents, adoptive parents, or state -appointed 
guardians) prior to administration of the first questionna ire.  
Per section, [IP_ADDRESS]., Recruitment , participants may be consented up to 1 month after discharge.  To 
facilitate this process, and due to the ongoing COVID- 19 pandemic, remote consenting will be allowed.

documents, US postal service, REDCap or other compliant electronic platform.  The remote consent 
process will parallel the consent processed used for in -person consenting.  The only difference will be 
the method( s) of communication.  The study team will ensure that, as with in -person consenting, the 
participant is  given sufficient opportunity to ask questions, is able to understand the nature of this 
study and what participation entails, and is  provi ded a copy of the final, completed consent signed by 
[CONTACT_5564] , including the research team member who obtained consent and, when applicable, 
the site investigator . This final, signed consent will be provided via a HIPAA -compliant method or a 
metho d that the participant has agreed to in writing.   The site research team members working on the 
consenting process will ensure that any participant  who is  consenting remotely has the authority to 
consent.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Detailing Barriers to Consent and Participation  
The site research team will ask non -consenting parents/caregivers to answer questions specific to 
perceived or actual barriers to participation and their choice not to be involved in the long -term 
outcome portion of the study. The site resea rch team will inform non -consenting parent s/caregivers  
about the purpose of these questions and that they are not required to answer them . The site research 
team will rec ord responses without  linking identifiers. The protocol study  team will not permit an 
amendment of the consent form for previously non- consenting parents/caregivers that wish to 
consent following these questions.  The protocol study team will use  the data collected to improve site-
specific and study -wide recruitment strategies  for this trial  and to inform future trials in this field .  
4.2.3.  Randomization Procedures   
This is a stepped -wedge cluster randomized design with a transition period wherein we will randomize 
participating study sites , rather than individual infants. All sites will implement the ESC care approach 
at some point during the trial; the random elements are two-fold: 1) randomization into the blocks, 
and 2) randomization of blocks to the time point at which each block implements the ESC care  
approach , the so -called “s tep” of the stepped- wedge design.   
A statistician at the independent Data Coordinating Center ( DCC)  for the trial will generate a 
randomization list using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The protocol study team will use t he 
proportion of infants wi th NOWS treated pharmacologically at each site as the variable  to stratify 
randomization (i.e., lowest 3rd, middle 3rd, highest 3rd). The protocol study team w ill identify this 
proportion using the results of the ACT NOW Current Experience Protocol, a retrospective data 
collection that details the inpatient identification, assessment,  and management of infants with NOWS 
at the ISPCTN and participating NRN sites . The protocol study team will conduct a brief survey to 
obtain similar estimates from other interested sites . The protocol study team will randomize sites in 
each stratum into one of 8  blocks (Figure 2). Once the protocol  study team randomizes each site into 
blocks, computer -generated random numbers from a uniform distribution will determine the order in 
which the block of sites step into the transition  and implementation  period for the ESC care approach . 
The DCC will hold the randomization list . Due to the nature of a stepped- wedge cluster  randomized 
controlled trial, the protocol study team can only enforce limited blinding. The protocol study team will 
notify sites of their allocated block following randomization .

videotaped case scenarios. The site champi[INVESTIGATOR_5459] c omponents of this training 
through the educational platform , and the protocol study team will track completion through 
pre/post assessments.  The protocol study team will provide an electronic  copy of the ESC 
Training and Implementation  Manual for each site in anticipation of entry into the transition 
period.  
• After the training, the core group of site champi[INVESTIGATOR_5460] 100% reliability  on standardized patient assessment 
cases  (6/6 items) . We define t his as three consecutive assessments with 100% reliability  as 
compared to national experts in the field . Once consistently achieving 100% reliability, the 
protocol study team will consider these individuals the "gold -star raters."  
• This core group will train all other clinical personnel who care for infants with NOWS at their 
site, including, but not limited to, nurses, advanced practice providers , and physicians in all 
areas  where  these infants receive care. These areas may include, but are not limited to, the 
well-baby [CONTACT_5566], pediatric unit, and neonatal intensive care unit.  After the training, clinical 
personnel will view and assess cases using the ESC IRR tool (see Training & Implementation 
Manual) until clinical personnel consistently achieve 80% agreement (5/6 items) . Once a 
member of the clinic al team reaches  80% IRR, the site research team will clear the trainee for 
independent assessment.  If the trainee consistently achiev es 100% reliability , the site research 
team will consider him/her  to be  a “gold -star rater” , and may ask the trainee  to function in this 
capacity . Site staffing levels will determine the number of “gold -star raters " at a site, with the 
goal of having one “ gold -star rater”  available on each shift. The protocol study team will require 
clinical personnel who are unable to attain 80% reliability to complete  supplementary training.  
Clinical personnel hired after the initial training will complete the educational modules and ESC training at the site inclusive of assessing cases using the ESC IRR tool to demonstrate 80% agreement .  
• To ensure fidelity of the assessments, the site resea rch team will assess the reliability of “ gold -
star raters ” at each site during the implementation phase of the transition period (see Training 
& Implementation Manual) . The protocol study team anticipates  each “gold -star rater” will  
maintain 100% reliabili ty in scoring  on patient assessment cases. The “ gold -star raters ” will then 
gauge  reliability of the clinical team by [CONTACT_5567]  (see Training and Impl ementation 
Manual).   For c linical personnel  who  fail to maintain the target of 80% reliability in scoring  
during the implementation phase of the transition period , the site research  team will utilize 
just-in-time training through a centralized training platform  until he/she achieves 80% reliability 
in assessment s. When staffing allows,  members of the care team who have reliability less than 
80% should not be assigned to care for infants with NOWS until  improved reliability is 
demons trated through the just- in-time training process.

Intervention  
• After  delivery  or transfer to the site , the care team will initiate non -pharmacolo gic care for 
NOWS , as detailed in the ESC training materials , and non-pharmacologic care will remain in 
place for the full duration of the infant’s management for NOWS.  
• Non -pharmacologic care can include: primary caregiver(s) involvement (rooming -in if possible), 
promot ing breastfeeding (for  eligible infants based on the institution’s established 
breastfeeding guideline) , encourag ing on-demand feeding, enhance ment of  low light and 
minimal noise exposure, supporting cluster ed care (doing assessments, vita ls, and all other care 
around feeding , to promote sleep), swaddling, and skin- to-skin care by [CONTACT_5568]( s) or 
holding by [CONTACT_5569]/staff volunteers.  
• Not all sites will be able to offer  all forms  of non -pharmacologic care and not all infants will be 
able to receive all non -pharmacologic interventions available at the site. Acknowledging this, 
the clinical team will make every attempt  to optimize the non- pharmacologic care provided to 
each  infant.  
• The clinical team will encourage primary caregiver (s) to participat e in the care and evaluation of 
their infant s. The clinical team will also encourage the primary caregiver( s) to record the 
infant’s  feedings ( timing and duration, and/or volume), sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (quality and quantity) , and 
ability to be consoled , in the Newborn Care  Diary , a component of the ESC care approach.  
• The clinical team, in collaboration with the primary caregiver( s), will use t he ESC Care T ool to 
assess the  infant with respect to the  ESC items (eating, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_5462])  by 
[CONTACT_5570] 4 to 6 hours of life (if risk for NOWS is known) or upon identification of the need 
for NOWS management.   
• The clinical team will perform ESC care assessments every 2  to 4 hours after feedings, clustering 
other infant and maternal care ( i.e., vital signs) at the same time. These assessments will 
include a collaborative review with the primary caregiver( s) (when  available)  of the ESC items

available, the clinical team who participated in the care of the infant during the assessment 
period will complete the assessment .  
• If during an assessment the infant has a "Yes" for any ESC item or obtains a score of “ 3” for 
“Consoling Support Needed ” on the ESC Care Tool , the primary caregiver (s) and clinical  team 
will conduct a “P arent/ Caregiver huddle ” to determine : 1) if the "Yes" is due to NOWS and 
2) which non- pharmacologic care interventions the care team can optimize further . The 
“Parent /Caregiver Huddle ” could include, but is not limited to, the parent/caregiver and the 
bedside nurse.   
• If the care team can optimize non-pharmacologic interventions , they  will do so and will 
continue to assess the infa nt.  
• If it is unclear if the infant’s difficulties with eating, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] , or consoling are due to NOWS, the 
care team will indicate  a "Yes" on the ESC Care T ool and will continue to monitor the infant 
closely while optimizing all non -pharmacologic care interventions.  
• If the infant has a second consecutive " Yes" for any ESC item ( or “3” for “Consoling Support 
Needed ”) on the ESC Care Tool  (or other significant concerns are present) , despi[INVESTIGATOR_5463]-pharmacologic care, the  care team will conduct a “Full-Care Team Huddle ” to determine if : 
1) the "Yes" is due to NOWS and 2) the infant needs pharmacologic  treatment.  A “Full-Care 
Team Huddle ” could include, but is not limited to, the parent/caregiver and the bedside nurse , 
in addition to the physician and/or advanced practice providers caring for the infant .  
• The clinical team will initiate p harmacologic treatment if  the infant sc ores "Yes" due to NOWS 
on an ESC item or scores a “ 3” for “Consoling Support Needed ” on the ESC Care Tool  despi[INVESTIGATOR_5464] -pharmacologic care . If an infant requires pharmacologic treatment , sites 
will initiate a treatment protocol to guide care. A treatment protocol should include dose  
initiation, escalation , and weaning  parameters. . Opi[INVESTIGATOR_5455] (morphine, 
methadone , or bupreno rphine) will be per site preference, as will adjuvant therapy  (clonidine 
or phenobarbital).   
• The clinical team will monitor each infant requiring opi[INVESTIGATOR_5465] ’s usual practice .  
• The clinical team will use the ESC Care T ool to monitor infants following birth and consider 
discharge for infants who do not require pharmacologic treatment per the site ’s usual practice.   
• To ensure fidelity of the assessments, the site research  team will randomly assess the reliability 
of “gold -star raters ” at each site throughout the ESC intervention  period s. The protocol study 
team anticipates that  each “gold -star rater” will maintain 100 % reliability in scoring. The “ gold -
star raters ” will then assess reliability of the clinical team once per  ESC intervention  period , 
using the ESC IRR tool and a NOWS infant,  written  cases,  or video case s. The protocol study 
team anticipates that each member of the clinical team will maintain 80% reliability in scoring. 
If a member of the clinical team fail s to meet this target during the assessment, the site 
research  team will utilize just -in-time training (see Training and Implementation Manual) until

members of the care team with  reliability less than 80% not be assigned to care for infants with 
NOWS until improved reliability is demonstrated through the just -in-time training process.  
• To ensure fidelity of ESC implementation, “gold -star raters ” will discretely evaluate, in real time, 
how nurses implement  the ESC care approach   using the ESC Implementation Process 
Evaluation  form  (see Training and Implementatio n Manual ). The protocol study team will use 
this tool to evaluate how consistent  nurse s are in their  evaluation of infant symptoms, 
recommendations for care team huddle s, as described by [CONTACT_5571], and 
implementation  of the ESC Care Tool  (inclusive of non -pharmacologic  care interventions) . The 
site research team will keep complete ESC Implementation Process Evaluation forms with other 
study documentation.  
4.2.5.  Protocol Adherence and Compliance Monitoring   
The DCC will monitor protocol deviations  per site in relation to the number of participants enrolled and 
visits conducted. All sites will receive re -education via regularly scheduled teleconferences to help 
other sites prevent similar deviations. If a particular deviation is recurrent at one sit e or across the 
sites, the DCC may implement operational tools, such as additional reminders, source document 
worksheets, and/or checklists, to reduce the likelihood of deviations. The DCC will review protocol 
deviations throughout the study, and it may sc hedule additional on -site visits, as needed, to review 
regulatory documents, data points, key issues, etc. or to retrain site staff to improve processes and 
provide additional education.  
Strategies to improve or monitor adherence to the study protocol will include the following:  
• Monthly recruitment reports of infants screened, enrolled , and consented (accrual figures)  
• Screen fails will be reviewed by [CONTACT_5572]/exclusion 
decisions    
• Monthly reports detailing da ta received at the data center, data consistency, missing data, 
performance measures, and adherence to the study protocol (with appropriate measures taken to preserve the blinding of study personnel and investigators)  
• Supplementary blinded reports requested by [CONTACT_5573] -group –specific outcomes (primary, secondary, or any safety outcomes)  
The DCC will generate the aforementio ned reports.  
Additionally,  the protocol study team will monitor protocol adherence through collection of the 
follo wing data :  
• Completion of modules and training by [CONTACT_5574].   
 
• Continual  IRR fidelity assessments  for the clinical team (reevaluated each period ). 
• Assessed a dherence to the assigned care approach .

Protocol Version #: 08    Date: 28-March -2022 enrolled in the study at approximately  3 and  24 months of age . Primary caregiver(s) for infants for 
whom the protocol study team obtained informed consent will receive questionnaires via electronic 
application  or via phone interview , if caregiver(s) have limited access to cellular/internet service or 
prefer this modality of communication. Caregiver(s) will complete  these questionnaires at discharge, 
1-month post discharg e, and 3 months, 6 months, 12 months , and 24 months  of age . These 
questionnaires will gather information on infant neurobehavioral functioning, infant wellness, primary 
caregiver(s) well- being,  family environment,  and caregiver- infant interactions , as deta iled in Section  
[IP_ADDRESS] . In addition, there will be an in -person follow -up visit with neurodevelopmental assessment  and 
anthropometric  measures  at [ADDRESS_4965] socioeconomic data (insurance and maternal educational status), marital statu s, and maternal 
receipt of medication -assisted treatment  for all populations to examine for possible bias . 
4.2.7.  Data Quality Assurance  
To assure the quality of the data collected, the protocol study team will provide training specific to 
accuracy of data acquis ition for the research coordinators at each site. The protocol study team will 
design data collection forms, which a subset of sites will subsequently pi[INVESTIGATOR_5467]. Additionally, the protocol study team will allocate sufficien t funds to allow for quality data 
collection.  The site research team will re -abstract a subsample  of their own charts and assess the error 
rate. Re-abstraction will focus on critical data elements related to the primary and secondary 
objectives of the protocol.  The protocol study team will base the number of charts a site re -abstract s, 
for each 6 -month interval , on the number of patients  enroll ed in the study during the 6 -month period 
at each site as shown below:  
No. of patients enrolled in a 
6-month period  No. of charts to be re -abstracted  
[ADDRESS_4966] IDs for re -abstraction.  The site research 
team will identify an independent site quality control (QC) abstractor who will re -abstract and enter 
data into the electronic data capture system (EDC ) only for the QC process and will not abstract study 
data while QC activities are taking place.  The DCC will generate a discrepancy report comparing study 
data  abstracted by [CONTACT_5575].  The 
site manager will hold a QC Review Meeting with the indep endent site QC abstractor, research  
coordinator, and site abstractor(s) to review the discrepancies a nd identify errors. Together they will

specific assessment of the data collection process and suggestions for process improvement. The protocol study team will highlight sites with exceptionally low error rates, and these sites will share 
aspects of their data collection process with sites w orking to improve their own process.  
4.2.8.  Blinding/ Masking  
The protocol study team will assure blinding of  the electronically performed follow -up questionnaires 
through the use of a centralized computer scoring system . For questionnaires completed by [CONTACT_648], 
each site should develop a site -specific protocol to preserve blinding of th ose administering the 
questionnaires . The protocol study team will note the method of questionnaire completion .    
4.3. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND E NDPOINTS  
4.3.1.  Primary Outcome  
The primary outcome is the time from birth until infants are medically ready for discharge . We define 
medically ready for discharge as when the infant meets ALL of  the following criteria:  
1. ≥ 96 hours of life 
2. Off opi[INVESTIGATOR_5438] ( e.g. morphine, methadone, or buprenorphine) for ≥  48 hours  
3. Taking 100% of feeds by [CONTACT_5555] ≥  24 hours  
4. ≥ 24 hours from initiation of the maximum caloric density infant received during the initial 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]  
5. Receiving no respi[INVESTIGATOR_5410] ≥  24 hours  
 
• Hypothesis: Among infants evaluated for NOWS, t he ESC care approach will reduce the length 
of time until infants are medically ready for discharge by [CONTACT_5554] [ADDRESS_4968] or modification thereof .

who receive opi[INVESTIGATOR_5438].  
• This is a yes/no outcome, and it will enable us to determine the percentage of 
infants receiving opi[INVESTIGATOR_5469].  
2. Total postnatal opi[INVESTIGATOR_5470]  
• Hypothesis: The use of the ESC care approach will decrease total opi[INVESTIGATOR_5437], compared to usual care.

• Use of the ESC Care Tool for the assessment of infants may delay the initiation of pharmacologic therapy and thus infants may be at an advanced state of withdr awal 
and more difficult to “capture”. Alternatively, there is some evidence to suggest
[ADDRESS_4969].  
4. Receipt of adjuvant therapy (clonidine or phenobarbital) prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]  
• Hypothesis: The use of the ESC care approach will decrease the proportion of infants 
who receive adjuvant therapy.  
• This is a yes/no outcome, and it will allow us to determine the percentage of infants 
receiving adjuvant therapy.  
5. Maximum percent weight loss during the initial birth hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Hypothesis: Use of the ESC care approach will not result in more excessive weight loss 
than usual care.  
• Poor feeding and excess ive weight loss are signs of suboptimal control of NOWS. 
Birth weight and daily weights (g) will be collected throughout the initial birth

• Hypothesis: Infants managed with ESC will have a decrease in the LOS.  
• The site research team will report the LOS in addition to the length of time until 
infants are medically ready for discharge. The differences in these measures will 
allow the protocol study team to assess the impact of social factors on the length of

• Use of the ESC care approach may delay initiation of pharmacologic therapy, which 
could result in an increase in withdrawal -related seizures. Therefore, monitoring for 
the presence or absence of seizures will help to build the safety profile for ESC.  
• Increased primary caregiver(s) involvement is thought to result from the ESC care 
approach. In this case, parent/ca regiver skin-to-skin time and holding may increase, 
which could increase the risk of infants being dropped if primary caregiver(s) are 
fatigued and/or chemically impaired.  
• Use of the ESC care approach may delay initiation of pharmacologic therapy, which could result in the infant receiving a higher dose of opi[INVESTIGATOR_5438].

presence or absence of acute/urgent care and/or ER visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5477] 
• Hypothesis: Infants managed using the ESC care approach will be safe during the 
first 3 months of life . 
• Discharge of an infant earlier from the initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5478]/or increased 
primary caregiver involvement during the initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5479](s) and lead to increased risk for poor outcomes, and increased healthcare utilization.  
12.  A composite measure of critical safety outcome s based on the presence or absence of  
non-accidental trauma and  death at discharge and during the first 3 and 24 months of life  
 Hypothesis: Infants managed using the ESC care approach will be safe during the first 3 and 24  months of life . 
 Infants with undertreated signs of withdrawal may be at increased risk for non-
accidental trauma and death due to the potential for increased primary caregiver stress and fatigue during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5480].  These 
infants may also fail to develop a bond with their primary caregiver(s) during the first mo nths of life, which may further increase the risk for non- accidental trauma 
and death during the first two years of life.

3. Maternal/caregiver well- being  
• Hypothesis: Use of the ESC care approach will improve maternal/caregiver well- being 
compared to usual care.  
• Assessed  with  Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)  
short forms at discharge, 6 months and 24 month s. 48 Standardized short forms  
examining mental health, specifically the areas of anxiety (PROMIS Short Form v1.0 - 
Anxiety - 8a 31May2019) , depression (PROMIS_SF_v1.0_ -_ED-Depression_8a_5 -31-
2019), anger (PROMIS Short For m v1.1 -  Anger - 5a 27Apr2016), life meaning and

• The standardized short form for each of the PROMIS Measures consists of between four 
to eight [ADDRESS_4973] extensively studied measure of 
depression in the postpartum period.  49, 50  In addition, the PROMIS anxiety measure has 
been correlated with the Mood and Anxiety Questionnaire (MASQ) and has been shown to be a valid measurement t ool for anxiety in the post- partum period in a sample of 
parents whose infants were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5484].  
50  Administration takes 
approximately 10 minutes and includes a total of 33 questions.  
4. Infant- caregiver bonding and attachment  
• Hypothesis: Use of the ESC care approach will result in improved infant -caregiver 
bonding and attachment, compared to usual care.  
• The protocol  study team will assess with the Maternal Postnatal Attachment 
Questionnaire (MPAQ ) at discharge  and 6 months of age . The caregiver will complete 
the questionnaire and it will be sent to a central location for review by [CONTACT_5578].   
• Primary caregiver -infant interactions will be assessed with the MPAQ,
[ADDRESS_4974] validated the tool for  postpartum women with substance -abuse problems.52  
• The focus of the MP AQ is primarily upon the caregiver(s)  subjective experiences in 
relation to their infant in the first year of life.[ADDRESS_4975], and the 
protocol study team will note caregiver(s) for entry and exit into these high -risk 
quartiles at each time point.

Protocol Version #: 08    Date: 28-March -2022 • Hypothesis:  Use of the ESC care approac h will result in improved caregiver sense of 
competency in caring for their infants compared to usual care.  
• The protocol study team will assess with the Parenting Sense of Competence (PSOC) 
Scale at discharge  and 6 months of age.  The caregiver will complet e the questionnaire 
and it will be sent to a central location for review by [CONTACT_5578].  
• The PSOC is a self -reporting instrument that measures and assesses parent self- efficacy.  
It is a 17 -item publicly available scale that measures satisfactio n (degree of liking a 
person has for their role as a parent) and efficacy (an individual’s perceived competence 
in their role as a parent).  
• Researchers have used t his tool to assess the impact of parenting efficacy on the 
likelihood of out -of-home placemen t and loss of custody in mothers with mental health 
and substance use disorders.54 
6. Family environment  
• Hypothesis: Use of the ESC care approach will enhance family environment when 
compared to usual car e. 
• The protocol study team will assess with Family Environmental Scale  (FES) - Relationship 
Dimension - Form R at 3 months of age. The caregiver will complete the questionnaire 
and it will be sent to a central location for review by [CONTACT_5577] .  
• The Relationship dimension of the FES consists of the Cohesion, Expressiveness, and Conflict subscales. Form R for each subscale is composed of 9  true -false items.   
• The relationship dimension assesses the degree of commitment, help, and support that family members provide each other, the extent to which family members are encouraged to act openly and to express their feelings directly, and the amount of 
openly expressed anger, aggression, and conflict among family members .
55 
• Researchers frequently use the FES to assess the home environment and it has been 
found to have strong psychometric properties .55 
7. Influence of maternal childhood experiences on infant outcomes  
• Hypothesis: Maternal history of adverse childhood experiences will be associated with 
worse infant behavioral functioning and developmental outcomes.  
• The protocol study team will assess adverse childhood experiences using the Adverse 
Child hood Experience (ACE) Questionnaire at 24 months of age .  
 The ACE56 is a self -report measure used to capture specific childhood experiences 
correlating with future social risk factors and negative health outcomes.

Protocol Version #: 08    Date: 28-March -2022 • Hypothesis: Use of the ESC care approach will improve infant development, compared 
to usual care.  
• The protocol study team will assess infant development with the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Fo urth Edition (Bayley -4): Cognitive, Language, and Motor, at 
24 months of age. The Bayley -4 will be administered by a trained examiner blinded to 
neonatal history who has undergone extensive training and been certified to perform exams.  
 The Bayley Scales are recognized internationally as one of the most comprehensive tools to assess developmental outcomes in children.  With the Bayley -4, it is even 
possible to obtain detailed information from non -verbal children as to their 
functioning.  Children are assesse d with 3  key developmental domains:  cognition, 
language, and motor.  Reliability and validity of the previous version of the 
instrument have been well established.
57 
• The protocol study team will assess infant behavioral development  with the Brief Infant -
Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (BITSEA) at 24 months of age.  The BI TSEA is a 
standardized and normed referenced instrument designed to assess for social-emotional, behavior concerns, and social competence in infants -toddlers . 
58 
 The 42- item parent rating form is a shorted version of the Infant- Toddler Social 
and Emotional Assessment. Scores include ratings of internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors, executive function ( dysregulation) , psych osocial 
competence, social relatedness; maladaptive, and atypi[INVESTIGATOR_5485]. The 
behavioral indices included in the BITSEA have been observed to correspond with neurodevelopmental functioning among infants at risk for neurodevelopmental problems . 
4.4. POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS T O PARTICIPANTS  
Under the proposed study design,  the protocol study team will randomize each site into blocks with 
each block transitioning from usual care to ESC at a randomly allocated time . At any given time  during 
the study enrollment period, all infants managed for NOWS  at a site  will receiv e care consistent with 
the care approach assigned by [CONTACT_5578] . Sites throughout the country are currently 
using b oth care approaches  described in this stu dy for the evaluation and management of NOWS.  Use 
of either care approach will not expose infants in this study to risk beyond that of usual /accepted  
clinical care.  
Involvement in the study will not increase the ris k to the family of  legal ramifications as sociated with 
the in utero  opi[INVESTIGATOR_5486] , as only infants who have been identified by [CONTACT_5581], will be screened for enrollment in the trial. There will be no additional toxicology screening (maternal or infant) performed beyond what  
medical professionals  would typi[INVESTIGATOR_5487]. Thus , there 
will be no additional information garnered with respect to substance use during pregna ncy due to 
one’s involvement in the trial.

Protocol Version #: 08    Date: 28-March -2022 The protocol study team will assess primary caregiver well- being (e.g. parenting stress, attachment and 
bonding, depression, anxiety, etc.) as well as infant well -being, neurobehavioral functioning, and 
developme nt during the follow -up portion of the study.   
The protocol study team will assess primary caregiver wellness with 5 PROMIS Measures (see [IP_ADDRESS]). 
It is possible that these questionnaires may reveal that the primary caregiver is experiencing psychological distress  potential ly requiring support.  T he study team has determined that a 
standardized  scoring threshold for the PROMIS Depression Measure will be used to identify  these 
individuals.  As thresholds specific to postpartum women with opi[INVESTIGATOR_5488] (a  t-score  >70, or [ADDRESS_4976] deviations above the mean 
for the normative population is the threshold for severe depressive symptoms.

exclude a subject based on race, ethnicity, or gender.  However, s ome of the  study  ques tionnaires that 
will be u sed have not been validated in languages other than English. Thus , the population for the 
consented portion of the study will be limited to infant s of English -speaking , reading  and writing  
caregivers.  Due to the demographic distrib ution of NOWS , the proportion of low socioeconomic -status  
infants will likely be higher than in the general population.    
4.5. RECRUITMENT AND RETE NTION  
4.5.1.  Site Recruitment and Retention  
The protocol study team began to optimize the potential for recruitment during initial protocol 
development, through an assessment of potential ISPCTN and NRN sites’ willingness to participate in 
and enthusiasm for various study designs. The study design chosen for thi s protocol incorporates the 
feedback from these sites. During the site assessment process, the protocol study team will expect 
each site to commit in writing to the site ’s participation in and completion of the trial with 
maintenance of the site ’s allocate d intervention for the duration of the study. The protocol study team 
will facilitate retention of sites through the  focused allocation of funds to support participation, 
through assessment of needs,  provision of  support, and troubleshooting at each site , as needed.   
4.5.2.  Infant and Parent/Caregiver Recruitment and Retention  
The site research teams will need to obtain participant consent for the long -term follow -up portion of 
the study. Historically, enrollment of infants with NOWS in clinical trials that seek to improve their care 
has been challenging. In response to this, the protocol study team plans to utilize a robust recruitment 
and retention plan developed to support and optimize the participation of this population in the follow -up portion of this study.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Recruitment  
The single most important element of the recruitment strategy is to establish trust with the primary 
caregiver( s) and provide an introduction to the research plan prior to delivery.  The prenatal 
consultation is most likely the first time that the family will meet the site  PI [INVESTIGATOR_5491]. The consultation is the opportunity for the provider to gain trust with the family and reaffirm a partnership with the family.  The consultation will include establis hing a 
foundation of knowledge about NOWS, outlining gaps in current national care, and a detailed description of the research approach.

Protocol Version #: 08    Date: 28-March -2022 In anticipation that pre natal consultations will not be feasible for all patients , effective dissemination 
of informat ion regarding the clinical trial will be exceptionally important.  The protocol study team will 
provide an informational pamphlet to all parent/caregiver(s) of infants receiving care for NOWS at 
participating sites soon after delivery.  The consenting member of the site research team will begin 
trust building with the parent/caregiver(s) in anticipation of the consenting process.  The site research  
team will present information about the study in person, and/ or via an  informational brochure 
developed by [CONTACT_5582]. To further optimize recruitment, if 
informed consent is not able to be obtained during the initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], it is permissible to obtain consent up to one month after discharge.  
The protocol study team will assess site recruitment for long -term follow -up each month following site 
enrollment. If the protocol study team assesses the site as below target, the study team will evaluate 
the site’s processes for recruitment , and the site w ill receive additional training and/or modifications 
to the recruitment approach as suggested by a recruitment and retention expert from the protocol 
study team.  
Additionally, the protocol study team will assess for barriers to participation, perceived or  actual, of 
non-consenters (see Section 4.2.2) and utilize their responses to further improve site -specific and 
study -wide recruitment strategies.   
[IP_ADDRESS].  Retention  
The protocol  study team will optimize  infant and parent/caregiver(s) retention soon after a site obtains 
consent, by [CONTACT_5583] a note of thanks to the parent/caregiver(s) and acknowledging the importance of 
their contribution to the future care we provide these infants. The site research  team will further 
optimize r etention via text messaging for  reminders , and access to questionnaires through a centrally 
located electronic platform.  The site research team will u se the electronic health record to update a 
participant’s contact [CONTACT_5584], in the event that the contact [CONTACT_5585]. The site research team can conduct questionnaires via phone interview if 
the caregiver(s) has  limited access to cellular/internet service or prefer this modality of 
commun ication. If a participant answers questions for questionnaires or comes to an in -person visit, 
the parent/caregiver(s) will receive  compensation  for their tim e.  This compensation will be provided

Protocol Version #: 08    Date: 28-March -[ADDRESS_4980] a ll statistical analyses following the stat istical principles for clinical 
trials as specified in I nternational Council on Harmonization  Topic E9. The protocol study team will 
describe and justify a ny deviations from the planned analyses in the final integrated clinical study report. 
The protocol study  team will present overall and study  site-specific  data and summary tables.  
The protocol study team will present the characteristics  of infants and mothers  by [CONTACT_5590]  
(usual care versus ESC  care approach ) and their outcomes for each site . We do  not expect significant 
differences in the demographic s of the study population during the 20-month  study  period. Each site 
covers a different population  mix, and while each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5493], they will do so in different proportions depending on when the protocol study team 
randomize s the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5494]. This will contribute greatly to any demographic difference s 
between the usual institutional care and ESC groups. Whilst we do not intend to test for demographic 
differences between the usual institutional care and ESC groups for the full cohort, we will adjust the 
analyses for the covariates described because of potential imbalance across sites and across steps. We 
will present n umerical variables as means [standard deviation ( SD)] or medians (interquartile range), 
depending on their distribution,  and categorical variables as counts and percentages . 
We will use t he principles of intention -to-treat for all statistical analyses related to primary and 
secondary endpoints.  
5.1.2.  Analysis of the Primary  Efficacy  Endpoints  
For the primary efficacy variable, we will test the following null hypothesis:  
H0: There is no  treatment difference in average length of time until medically ready for discharge 
between usual care and the ESC care approach.  
Versus  
H1: There is a treatment difference in average length of time until medically ready for discharge between 
usual care and the  ESC care approach.  
We will consider t he length of time until medically ready for discharge measure a count measure and 
has the potential to follow a skewed distribution.  Initially, we will assess the distributional assumption. 
We will evaluate t he associations of potential confounders ( e.g.,  gestational age, birth weigh t, 
race/ethnicity, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5495], rural/urban indicator)  at both the participant and site level with the 
intervention. An additional potential confounder that we will evaluate will be the presence of other 
ongoing clinical trials in our trial sites that might impact the outcome of this study, including the 
“Prospective Randomized  Blinded Trial to S horten Pharmacologic Treatment of Newborns with Neonatal 
Opi[INVESTIGATOR_5392]  (NOWS)”.

Protocol Version #: 08    Date: 28-March -2022 We will use a generalized linear mixed -effects model (GLMM) to compare the expected l ength of time  
until medically ready for discharge between the two treatment interventions  (usual care and ESC care 
approach) . Specifically, we will use a GLMM with a  negative binomial distribution  and log -link to account 
for potential over- dispersion , as an infant level analysis, and accounting for correlations between 
observations in the same hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5496] a random effect. We will rep ort 
point estimates for the group mean difference along with a 95% confidence interval ( CI). The model -
building approach for our primary outcome will follow four analyses steps: 1) an unadjusted before/after 
of the effect of the ESC care approach (ignoring  period/time effect ); 2) the time  period (i.e. , steps) to 
examine if any potential intervention effect relates  only to the intervention or also to an independent 
effect of calendar time ; 3) an adjustment for infant- level and maternal characteristics and po tential 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -level confounders , such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5497]/urban indicator; 4) the possible 
interaction between period and intervention effect. The impact of the ESC care approach on the primary 
outcome could potentially change over time, as the  improvement in outcome could increase with  time 
as the staff gains experience. H owever, the impact  could also decrease after an initial improvement as 
the level of initial enthusiasm decrease s. We aim to explore this question through the inclusion of an 
interaction between period/time and inte rvention effect in Model 4.   
In certain circumstances, medical personnel may discharge an infant prior to being medically ready for 
discharge as defined in our protocol (e.g., sent home on opi[INVESTIGATOR_5498], m orphine,  or 
buprenorphine ). Therefore, to compare the [ADDRESS_4981] adjusted for a cluster randomized design to compare the median 
time the infant is medically ready for discharge between the intervention groups.61 Additionally, we will 
use a Cox proportional hazards (Cox PH) model with the Lin and Wei robust sandwich estimate of the 
variance -covariance matrix, to account for clustering, to adjust for infant and maternal demographics . 
We expect the amount of censoring to be minimal , therefore the results from the Cox PH model will 
serve as a sensitivity analysis for our primary analysis based on a GLMM with log -link.

of two periods is below 3 0%, then the protocol study team will monitor the informed consent rate for 
another block of two periods.  If the cumulative informed consent rate remains below 3 0%, the n the 
protocol study team will ask the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSM C) to review accrual 
trajectories and to determine , with the protocol study team , if measures can be taken to improve the 
accrual rate. The DSM C will consider whether to stop a ccrual to the long -term follow -up portion of the 
study  due to an insufficient informed consent rate.  Additionally, the DSM C will monitor t he study  for 
safety concerns (see Section 5.5.2) . 
5.2. SAMPLE SIZE AND POWE R ESTIMATES 
We based the sample size estimate  (Table 5) on the primary outcome, which is the comparison of the 
average length of time until the infant is medically ready for discharge between groups (ESC care 
approach versus  usual care). In much of the literature, researchers tend to report overall len gth of 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  (LOS) . The average reported LOS  for infants managed for NOWS is approximately 
18 days (SD=8)29; we expect a reduction of [ADDRESS_4996] 
deviation estimate for LOS.  For the purpose of our sample size justification, we use d these estimates as 
a proxy for our estimates of the average length of time until the infant is medically ready for discharge.  
Based on the Current Experience Study, the average LOS is approximately 11  days (SD=11).  Additionally, 
we derived an estimate of the ICC of 0.[ADDRESS_4997] sample size justifications  for stepped- wedge design studies follow a mixed -

cluster autocorrelation coefficient (CAC) as the ratio of the between -period ICC over the within- period 
ICC.  
We calculated statistical power based  on the methodology for stepped- wedge with transition period 
design proposed by H ooper et al using the  R-Shiny app written by [CONTACT_5593].[ADDRESS_4998] NOW Current Experience Study to obtai n an 
estimate of the over -dispersion parameter (φ). McCullagh and Nelder  suggested that the over -
dispersion parameter estimate  (φ) is simply a ratio of the deviance or the Pearson chi- square to its 
associated degrees -of-freedom.68 Thus, a total sample size of 864  infants would achieve 90% power to 
detect a difference of 4 days between the groups  with an estimated CAC of 0.8 and φ =10. This assumes 
an 8-step stepped -wedge with transition period design with [ADDRESS_4999] NOW Current Experience Study, the 
expected number of infants with NOWS delivered at participating  sites annually  will be approximately 
1500 -2000 infants . Therefore, our study w ill still be sufficiently powered  (i.e., 85%)  to detect a difference 
of 3 days between the groups with CAC=0. 8. The p ower calculation assume s significance level of 5%, 
delivery of infants with NOWS equally distributed across hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5518], and analysis by [CONTACT_5594] .

consent rates and CAC estimates with the study having 80% power.  Again based on the ACT NOW 
Current Experience Study, we expect the number of infants with NOWS  delivered at participating sites 
annually will be approxi mately 1500 infants.  Thus, f or a 17 -month  enrollment period, the protocol study 
team expects a total of 2125  infants with NOWS will be delivered at participating study sites.  Assuming a 
40% or 30% consent rate, this produces a total sample size of 850 (40% consent rate) or  638 (30% 
consent rate) infants.  Cohen defined effect size as the mean differences, 𝜇𝜇1−𝜇𝜇2, divided by [CONTACT_652], σ, of either group.69 However, Rosnow and Rosenthal noted that in practice, 
researchers commonly use the pooled SD (defined as the root mean square of the 2 SDs ).[ADDRESS_5002] sizes 
are generally classified as small (≤ 0.3), medium (~0.5), and large (≥ 0.75). For infant neurobehavioral

5.5.1.  Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Definition of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
 
Adverse event (AE) : AE means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of an 
intervention in humans, whether or not co nsidered intervention related.  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE): An AE is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
1. Death

Protocol Version #: 08    Date: 28-March -2022 2. Life-threatening AE (life -threatening means that the study participant was, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_5521], at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred and required 
intervention)  
3. Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions  
4. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
5. Important medical event that may not result in 1 of the above outcom es but may jeopardize the 
health of the study participant or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in the above definition of serious event  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Classification of an Adverse Event  
Severity of Event  
For AEs , the site research team will use the following guidelines to describe severity. The site 
investigator will determine severity.  
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily 
activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment.  Severe events are usually potentially life threatening  or 
incapacitating. Of note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious.”  
Relationship to Study Intervention 
The site research team will grade t he degree of certainty about causality by [CONTACT_5597].  
• Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study procedures, there is a reasonable possibility 
that the study procedures caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study procedures and the event. Reasonable  possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the study procedures and the AE.  
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the study procedures caused the event, 
there is no temporal relationship between the study procedures and event onset, or an alternate 
etiology has been established.  
Expected AEs  
Expected AEs include - seizures, accidental trauma, severe weight loss (greater than 15% from 
birthweight) and respi[INVESTIGATOR_5448].  Expected AEs that could occur during the follow -up portion of 
the study include acute/urgent care and or ER visits for worsening symptoms of NOWS.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5522] -accidental trauma may also occur.  We 
note a nticipated rates  in Table 7 .

Protocol Version #: 08    Date: 28-March -2022 [IP_ADDRESS].  Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow  Up 
For this study,  the protocol study team will collect the  following AEs: 1) all expected AEs (seizures , 
accidental trauma, severe weight loss, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_5523]) , and 2) S AEs related to study 
procedures.  The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] , by [CONTACT_5598] , or by [CONTACT_5599]. The site research team will capture all AEs on the appropriate case report form. 
Information to be collected includes event description, date/ time of onset, date/time of resolution, 
clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study intervention and time of resolution/stabilization 
of the event. Site research teams must follow all AEs until the AE meets one  of the following criteria: 
resolution, the condition stabilizes, the event is otherwise explained or is judged by [CONTACT_5600], or the participant is lost to follow -up. The site research team 
will collect AEs during the initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5524] .  
5.5.2.  Data Monitoring and Safety  
The independent DSMC will have overall responsibility for i nterim data monitoring and  operate based on 
the ISPCTN and NRN charter for the DSMC.  The DSMC will formally review interim safety data in a 
sequential fashion using interim monitoring boundaries after approximately 25%, 50%, and 75% of the study sites (6, 12,  and 18 sites , respectively) have transition ed to the ESC care approach and have 
completed one full period using the ESC care approach . Treatment groups will be compared statistically 
using the analysis planned for the final analyses for safety outcomes  (as specified in Section 5.1.3).  
Safety oversight will be under the direction of a DSMC. Safety outcomes include the components of the 
inpatient composite safety outcome and those of the outpatient composite safety outcome (see Table 
7). The DSMC may request other outcomes at their discretion.  Formal statistical testing for an imbalance 
of seizures, accidental trauma, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_5513] , in either treatment 
group , will be based on a comparatively liberal Lan DeMets Pocock bo undary at the three interim safety 
review s to guard against any occurrence of false positives while at the same time allowing for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_5525].  Thus, at each interim, an increased incidence of seizures in either 
treatment group  with P < 0.0179 (for 4 total tests) will be considered a statistically significant evidence 
of harm that the DSMC can use to recommend suspension of the trial for safety reasons.  This same 
statistical testing will also be conducted for the components of the outpatient composite safety outcome. In addition to the formal safety outcomes, the DSMC will examine other safety outcomes, including all reported SAEs by [CONTACT_5601] a recommendation to suspend the trial for safety reasons.  
The Medi cal Monitor will  provide input on safety considerations, evaluate safety trends, and provide 
oversight throughout the life cycle of the clinical research, in accordance with the approved protocol. This role includes review ing and monitoring safety events o n a regular basis , advising the protocol 
investigators on trial -related medical questions or problems, review ing cumulative participant safety 
data , and making recommendations regarding the data to the DSMC .

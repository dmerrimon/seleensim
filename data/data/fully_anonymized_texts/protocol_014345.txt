 1 OBJECTIVES 
1.1 Primary Objectives 
The primary objectives of this study will be: 
 To determine the 8-week disease control ra te (DCR) for the four proposed treatment 
regimens in subjects with non-small cel l lung cancer (NSCLC ) who have received 
prior cytotoxic chemotherapy or  epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor for metastatic disease. 
 To identify the prognostic and predictive markers for the four proposed treatment 
regimens. 
 To determine the best individualized treatm ent based on the biomarker profile of the 
subjects cancer. 
 
1.2 Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objectives of this study will be: 
 To determine the overall response rate by [CONTACT_147802]. 
 To assess the overall response rate by [CONTACT_147803]. 
 To determine the progression-free survival. 
 To determine the overall survival. 
 To determine the time to disease progression.  
 To assess the safety/toxicity of the combination. 
 To assess biomarker modulation in the tumor tissue from the treatment. 
 To assess biomarker modulation in the serum/blood from the treatment.

therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Subjects will be administered erlotinib  (Arm 1), or erlotinib in combination with an

inhibitor (AZD6244) (Arm 3) or Sorafenib (B AY 43-9006) (Arm 4).  The study is designed to 
develop individualized targeted therapy based on the identificat ion and validation of specific

 molecular pathways of NSCLC. To address these new targeted therapeutic approaches, we propose 
to implement a translational lung cancer  research program entitled, “BATTLE-2: Biomarker-
integrated Approaches of Targeted Therapy of Lung Cancer Elimination-2,” and provide a strong 
rationale-based targeted treatmen t strategy. The study is applying similar principles as our prior 
BATTLE Program. The program requi red that all eligible subjects with advanced NSCLC undergo 
a core biopsy of their tumors and applied biomarke rs in the selection of individualized targeted 
therapy.   
The study will proceed in two stages:  
Stage 1 - Initial Adaptive Randomization: 200 subjects will be adap tively randomized into one of 
the four treatment arms (three treatment arms for prior-erlotinib treated patients, who are excluded 
from the erlotinib-only arm) based solely on KRAS mutation status (present or absent), which is 
accepted in the field as having relevance to the sensitivity or resistance to erlotinib and other 
targeted agents. Stage 2 – Refined Adaptive Randomization: After enro llment of half of the total sample size, a 
refined biomarker signature (for each arm) will be generated to refine the predictive model for the 
DCR.  The second half of subjects will be adaptive ly randomized to the four treatment arms based 
on the refined model.    
[ADDRESS_169327] ates and worldwide.  An estimated 
215,020 new cases of lung cancer were diagnosed in the US in the year 2008 leading to approximately 161,840 deaths in the [LOCATION_002] alone.
1 Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 
accounts for almost 80% of newly diagnosed cases.  Lung cancer deaths in the US surpass those resulting from breast, prostate, and colon cancers, and its incidence continues to rise. Only 16% of 
these subjects in whom lung cance r develops live [ADDRESS_169328] two decades, currently at the time of diagnosis, more than 80% of subjects present with 
locally advanced unresectable or metastatic di sease and their chance to be cured by [CONTACT_147804].

  At presentation, the median survival for pa tients with advanced  disease defined as 
inoperable Stage III or IV non-small-cell lung cancer  is 8 to 10 months, with a one-year survival 
of 35 to 45%.[ADDRESS_169329] 
led to substantial knowledge about the molecula r basis of lung cancer, which provides a unique 
opportunity to develop novel stra tegies to target key path ways crucial for lung cancer 
development. This has led to emerging targeted th erapy to attack lung cancer. However, to answer 
the question of how to develop “sma rter” clinical trials using informative molecular markers, these 
biomarkers must first be identified and then targ eted with specific molecular inhibitors. Several 
large, randomized trials using targeted agents ei ther alone or combined with chemotherapy failed 
to demonstrate the contributio n of the targeted agent in the treatm ent of lung cancer.4,[ADDRESS_169330].  The relationship 
between EGFR-related biomarkers (EGFR-gene-copy number, EGFR mutation, EGFR protein 
expression, and K-ras mutation) and the response to EGFR-TKIs has been widely investigated, 
with the aim of identifying those patients most likely to respond to treatment.  Some single-arm 
studies of gefitinib-treated patients have shown that survival, progression-free survival (PFS), and 
objective response rate (ORR) were better in patie nts whose tumors have a high EGFR-gene-copy 
number compared with those wi th a low EGFR-gene-copy number.10,[ADDRESS_169331] 
responses to the EGFR kinase inhibitor, gefi tinib or erlotinib, underscores the importance of 
tailored individualized ther apy based on the tumors’ underl ying molecular biological 
profiles.14,16,17 Indeed, the scientific advisory committee of the European Medicines Agency 
(EMEA), has issued a positive opi[INVESTIGATOR_147731] a pproval of the targeted oral anti-cancer drug, 
gefitinib, for adults with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with activating mutations of 
EGFR-TK in all lines of therapy based on findings from the IPASS study demonstrating 
significantly longer progression-free survival for patients w ith EGFR mutation-positive tumors 
treated with gefitinib than with doublet chemotherapy [ADDRESS_169332] study demonstrating 
similarly significant improvement in PFS and OS with gefitinib in patien ts with EGFR mutation 
positive tumors.19 Resistance to EGFR inhibitors has emerged through development of acquired 
resistance 20 or de novo resistance thr ough other signaling pathways.21-23  
 
2.3 Biomarker Driven Targeted Therapy Clinical Trials Program (BATTLE-1) 
  BATTLE-[ADDRESS_169333] therapy had faile d by [CONTACT_147805]’ tumor 
biomarker profiles, obtained from a mandated fre sh core tumor biopsy and assigning them to 
corresponding targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_147732] a better clinical outcome.  Several 
unique aspects of this Department of Defense (DoD)-sponsored program included: a) the 
unprecedented mandate for fresh tumor biopsies in an NCSLC clinical trial; b) using molecular classifications to guide selection of targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; an d c) the use of a novel hierarchical 
Bayesian modeling approach to associate biomar kers with treatment outcome and, subsequently, 
apply “adaptive randomizati on” to guide treatment assignments  towards the therapy arms most 
likely to benefit patients according their marker  profiles and, conversely, away from arms that 
demonstrate lack of efficacy.  Adaptive randomization under a Baye sian paradigm continues to 
“learn” by [CONTACT_147806]/outcome data over the co urse of the trial to guide 
treatment assignments.  BATTLE-1 is composed of f our Phase II clinical trials, including therapy 
with erlotinib, sorafenib, vandetanib, and bexaro tene + erlotinib.  Once patients are enrolled, 
consented and undergo a core biopsy of their lung tumor for biomarker analysis, each tumor is 
then profiled for prespecified biomarkers and marker groups.  From No vember [ADDRESS_169334] been enrolled in to the program with 255 randomized

pts), Vandetanib (V) (54 pts), Erlotinib+Bexaro tene (E+B) (37 pts), an d Sorafenib (105 pts). 
Patient demographics were as follows: Median age 62 yrs (26-84); male 54%; ECOG PS 0-1 86%, PS 2 14%; Caucasian 82%, Asian 5%, other 13%;  never/former/current smokers 22%/69%/9%; 
adenocarcinoma 63% squamous cell 18%, NSCLC NOS 19%; prior Erlotinib 45%, median prior 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_147733]: 2 (range 1-9); prior brain metast ases 33%. 244 pts were evaluable 
for 8 wk DC. All 11 biomarkers were assessable in 215 pts (82% of the patient population).  The 
remaining 18% of the patient samples yielded no viable tumor tissue due to necrotic tissue and 
dense fibrosis.  Biopsy sites were lung 55%, liver/adrenal 19%, other 26%. Pneumothorax incidence was 11.5%, and 6.5% of pts had treatment-related grade 3-4 toxicity. EGFR status 
included mutations in 15%, FISH amplificatio n (A) in 16% and high polysomy in 28%; Other 
biomarkers were KRAS mutations in 20%; VEGF/R2 staining in 83%; RXR alpha nuclear staining 
in 79%; Cyclin D1 staining in 53 %. Overall DCR at 8 weeks was 46%, median overall survival 
(OS) was 9 months, 1 year survival was 39%, and progression-free surviv al (PFS) was 1.9 months. 
Better DC was seen with EGFR mutations for Erlotinib (p=0.04); Cyclin D1 IHC positivity (IHC+)

 (p=0.011) and EGFR FISH A (p=0.006) for E + B; VEGFR2 IHC+ for V (p=0.05); and absence 
of EGFR mutations (p=0.012) or high polysomy (p=0.048)  for S. Pts with both EGFR mutations 
and FISH A had 100% DC (n=6) with E and 0% DC (n=6) with S. Pts with KRAS mutations tended 
to respond better with S (8-wk DC 61%) compared to other th ree regimens (8-wk DC 32%) 
(P=0.11). Pts with mutant KRAS Cys amino acid (aa) substitution had worse OS (all pts) and PFS 
(S-treated pts) compared to pt s with wild type or all other KRAS amino acid substitutions (p=0.015 
and p=0.013).   Our ability to study efficacy in the Phase II setting as well as to correlate clinical data reliably 
with real-time biomarker analysis, and the know ledge gained through these programs regarding 
key regulatory mechanisms in NSCLC, has significan t potential to lead to the identification of new 
therapeutic targets and strategies to be tested in  future Phase III studies.  The BATTLE-[ADDRESS_169335] to this group. 
 2.4 Rationale  
2.4.1 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_147734] (EGFR) signaling pathway    
EGFR overexpression is associated with an ov erall poor prognosis in pa tients with cancer and 
disruptions in the signal transduction pathways may cause tumor tr ansformation, cell proliferation, 
as well as progression of invasion and metastasis.
25-28  Multiple EGFR compounds are being used 
and tested in NSCLC.29-31 
Erlotinib (Tarceva®), an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhib itor (TKI) which is currently approved 
for treatment in patients with NSCLC who have failed chemotherapy, will be one of the agents included in this study.
31  Patients who carry a mutation of EGFR are more sensitive to these 
compounds and this correlates with a clinical re sponse.  However, if a patient harbors a K-ras 
mutation or other possible cel lular abnormalities, these EGFR  targeting agents seem less 
effective.32 Correlates such as EGFR amplification, 10 mutation as well as new mutations which 
develop after treatment (i.e. resist ance genes) have been described.33,[ADDRESS_169336] 
responses to the EGFR kinase inhibitor gefitinib or erlotinib underscores the importance of tailored

 individualized therapy based on the tumors’ underlying molecula r biological profiles. Both 
acquired and de novo resistance to erlotinib has been  documented. Acquire d resistance is well 
studied and emerges either thr ough acquisition of secondary EG FR mutations such as EGFR 
T790M or activation of downstream signaling especially the PI3K/AKT pathway.  It is critical in 
this juncture to emphasize that the use of onc ogene-addicted, highly drug-sensitive cell line models 
to uncover escape mechanisms has been fruitful but yet to be validated in human tumors.  
Therefore, it is of paramount im portance that biopsies be obtained in refractory patients in order 
to confirm or refute these mechanisms.  The availa bility of drugs that therapeutically target these 
escape pathways provides a unique opportunity for va lidations of these targ ets in a biomarker- 
driven clinical trial.   
 
2.4.[ADDRESS_169337] a significant 
role in tumor progression.  In NSCLC, AKT activ ation has been reported in >30% of tumors and 
may be due to overexpression or ac tivating mutations of receptor ty rosine kinases, PI3K and Ras, 
inactivation of tumor suppressor P TEN, and amplification or mutation of AKT itself.  As inhibitors 
of AKT target the growth signali ng pathways downstream from othe r tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
(i.e. erlotinib, herceptin, cetuxima b, IGF-R inhibitors, and c-Met inhi bitors), it is presumed that 
these AKT inhibitory agents will have broader uti lity and may have a synergistic effect with other 
systemic targeted agents.   
AKT plays a key role in cell survival and serv es as a critical escap e mechanism for tumor 
cells to evade apoptosis induced by [CONTACT_147807]-, ra diation and targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Furthermore, 
constitutive or residual AKT activation are of ten found in tumor cells that have developed 
resistance to conventional chemotherapy, radiation or  targeted agents such as EGFR antagonists.  
Therefore, targeting AKT in combination with c onventional chemotherapy or targeted agents has 
the potential to synergize the tumor cell killing e ffects and may also re-sensitize resistant tumor 
cells to such treatments. 
Most, if not all laboratory models  of acquired resistance to EGFR  tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
(TKI)  show continued activation of th e PI3K pathway despi[INVESTIGATOR_147735] 36-[ADDRESS_169338].37,40-43  In the NSCLC cell lines, Janmaat et al41 suggested that resistance to gefitinib 
was due to upregulation and persis tent activation of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways.  Li et 
al. conducted a supportive analysis of the p-EGFR: p-  AKT ratios and noted th at erlotinib sensitive 
cells had a 10-fold higher ratio than  that found in erlotinib  resistant cells.  A higher ratio indicates 
that activation of a downstream signaling molecule primarily results from the activation of 
upstream EGFR, whereas a low ratio indicates that the downstream signaling arises from alternative pathways and is not EGFR dependent.  Recent data also suggests that the persistent 
activation of PI3K/AKT pathway could be secondary to MET amp lification in EGFR inhibitor 
resistant cell lines via activation of erbB3-dependent activation of PI3K.
[ADDRESS_169339] activation (MEK/PI3K/AKT)   
  BATTLE-[ADDRESS_169340] by [CONTACT_147808], kinases and other 
substrates. Although successful ther apeutic targeting of K-ras muta tions in NSCLC so far remains 
elusive, abundant knowledge of downstream signaling activa tion such as PI3K/AKT and 
Raf/MEK signaling may provide opportunities for rati onal combined targeting.  Recent literature 
suggests that preclinical combination therapy with  a PI3K and a MEK inhibitor (both in Phase I 
clinical trials in humans current ly) in the setting of animal K-ras induced lung tumors results in 
substantial tumor regressions.[ADDRESS_169341]

3 STUDY AGENTS 
3.1 Erlotinib Background 
Erlotinib (Tarceva
®; OSI-774), a quinazoline, is an orally act ive, potent, selectiv e inhibitor of the 
EGFR (HER-1) tyrosine kinase FDA approved fo r chemorefractory patients with NSCLC.  An 
overview of selected non-clinical and clinical information is presented here; complete details are 
available in the OSI-774 Investigator Brochure. 
Erlotinib inhibits the human EGFR (H ER-1) tyrosine kinase with an IC 50 of 2 nM 
(0.786 mg/mL) in an in vitro enzyme assay and 20 nM (7.86 ng/mL) in intact tumor cells.  This 
inhibition is selective for EGFR  (HER-1) tyrosine kinase, results in cell cycle arrest at G 1, and is 
reversible.  Oral administrati on of OSI-774 in mice results in a >70% reduction in EGFR (HER-
1) autophosphorylation in human xenografts.  Marked growth inhibition of HN5 (head and neck

 carcinoma) and A431 (squamous cell carcinoma) xenografts in nude mice has been demonstrated.  
Data on drug exposure and antitumor responses in  these xenograft models  were analyzed to 
estimate the optimal plasma con centration of OSI-774 for antitumor activity in humans.  Based on 
these models, a target plasma concentration of   500 ng/mL was selected. 
 
3.[ADDRESS_169342] been completed.52 The primary toxicities 
consisted of diarrhea, rash, naus ea, headache, emesis, and fatigue.  The only dose-limiting toxicity 
was diarrhea.  This event was dose related and was generally co ntrolled with the addition of 
loperamide therapy and treatment with erlotinib doses of < 200 mg/day.  The appearance of the 
rash seen in the clinical trials  of erlotinib conducted in healthy subjects and cancer subjects has 
been similar.  It was only loosely dose related and was seen commonly at doses of > 25 mg/day.  The rash was variable in onset, duration, and severity.  The mechan istic basis of the rash remains 
uncertain; histopathologic examination of biopsie s of the rash demonstrated polymorphonuclear 
leukocyte infiltration and mild epi[INVESTIGATOR_147736].  In some cases, the rash improved 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_147737], and in general, it gra dually resolved without se quelae following erlotinib 
discontinuation.  The rash did not result in study discontinuation in can cer subjects in either of the 
Phase I trials.  In the phase I study, 50% of patients developed rash and 86% diarrhea at the 
recommended Phase II dose of 150 mg daily.

and follow-up ophthalmologic examinations were ins tituted in the Phase I and II trials in cancer 
subjects.  In the weekly dosing study (Study 248- 005) the only reported erlotinib–related ocular 
event was an epi[INVESTIGATOR_147738].  In the daily dosing study (Study 248-004), [ADDRESS_169343] 
experienced moderate corneal ed ema/keratitis attributed to w earing contact [CONTACT_13276], although an 
influence of erlotinib was not discounted.  The event resolved with temp orary discontinuation of 
both erlotinib and contact [CONTACT_78617] e; there was no recurren ce of symptoms with erlotinib rechallenge 
in the absence of continued use of contact [CONTACT_13276].  No increased incidence of ocular toxicity related 
to erlotinib treatment compared to placebo was noted in the randomized Phase III trial of carboplatin/paclitaxel +/- er lotinib (see Erlotinib Investigator’s Brochure).

3.3   Phase II Trials:  Erlotinib and Advanced Cancer  
The 150 mg/day dose of erlotinib selected for a ll subsequent trials was based on pharmacokinetic 
parameters as well as the safety  and tolerability profile of this dose level in Phase I trials in 
advanced, heavily pretreated cancer subjects.  Three Phase II trials of the safety, tolerability, and 
antitumor activity of erlotinib have been con ducted in subjects with advanced, refractory 
malignancies, including NSCLC, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and ovarian 
carcinoma.  Subjects in each of th ese studies received 150 mg/day of erlotinib.  Dose reductions 
were allowed in the case of intole rance.  Diarrhea was tr eated with loperamide therapy and/or dose 
reduction.  Rash was treated with a variety of agents, including oral a nd topi[INVESTIGATOR_8163], 
corticosteroids, and other agents.  Available data from the two reported Phase II trials in NSCLC 
and head and neck cancer demonstrat e objective response rate of 4%–12%.30,53

3.5 MK-2206 (AKT Inhibitor) Background 
MK-2206 is an ora lly active, allosteric AKT inhibitor that is under de velopment for the treatment 
of solid tumors.  The agent is a highly specific non-ATP competitive AKT inhibitor 55 and has 
equal potency towards purifie d recombinant human AKT 1 (IC 50 = 8 nM) and AKT 2 (IC 50 = 12 
nM).  It is approximately 5-fold  less potent against human AKT3 (IC 50 = 65 nM) in enzyme assays.    
Preclinical studies with MK-[ADDRESS_169347] udies, the safety of MK-2206 
administration to humans is also supported by [CONTACT_147811]. Treatment-related 
changes included slight to moderate hematologic cha nges, slight to moderate  increase in insulin, 
glucose, cholesterol, and ALT/AST. Histomorphologic changes included biliary hyperplasia, 
inflammation, and crystals in th e liver; tubular dege neration, acute infl ammation, and tubular 
crystals in the kidney; decreased colloid in the thyroid gland; marginal zone depletion of the 
spleen; and islet cell hyperplasi a and vacuolation of the pancr eas, retinal inflammation, gastric 
ulceration, lymphoid depletion of the Peyer' s patches, lymph nodes,  spleen, and thymus, 
inflammation of the mucosa of the large intestine, necrosis of renal pelvis epi[INVESTIGATOR_147739], bile duct necrosis with associated infla mmation, bile ductule hyperplasia 
and periportal hepatocellular va cuolation in the liver, and er ythroid depletion and myeloid 
hyperplasia of the bone marrow. In oral toxic ity studies with rats, 75 mg/kg, dosed QOD was

 considered the NOAEL. This dose provide s an exposure margin (based on the C max value) of 
approximately 39-fold over the human IC 70 (58 nM). In oral toxicity studies with dogs, 2.5 mg/kg 
(AUC0-48 hr = 8.5 μM•hr and C max = 0.37 μM) was considered the NOA EL. In an anesthetized 
dog cardiovascular study, there was no effect on cardiovascular  function, including QT/QTc 
interval, after intravenou s doses of 1, 2, and 7 mg/kg MK- 2206. At the highest dose in this study, 
an average exposure of 32 μM was achieved, which is approxim ately 550-fold above the human 
IC50 for AKT1. While there was no evidence of QT/QTc interval prolongation in the anesthetized 
dog assay, there were significant car diovascular effects observed in  conscious dogs monitored via 
radiotelemetry.  Cardiovascular changes such as  decreases in heart rate, prolongation of QT and 
QTc intervals and increases in mean arterial pressure were observed at 2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg. No 
cardiovascular effects were obser ved at 1 mg/kg (AUC0-24 hr = 1.6 μM•hr and C max = 0.092 μM) 
in dogs. This dose provides an exposure margin (based on C max value) of approximately 2-fold 
above the human IC 70 (58 nM). An additional safety concern is for MK-2206-induced 
hyperglycemia/hyperinsulinemia which is a mechan ism-based effect. In all preclinical species 
tested, MK-[ADDRESS_169348] sensitive preclin ical species, glucose elevati on was slight (~24 to 34%) at 
exposures corresponding to an AUC 0-48 hr of 19.6 μM•hr and a C max of 0.73 μM after 5 mg/kg QOD 
dosing for [ADDRESS_169349] ed at the upper range of dosing 
in oncology patients. 
In the dose-limiting toxicity study in the ra t, dose-limiting toxicity was observed at ≥ 200 
mg/kg/day. In the 10-day oral tolerability study in dogs, daily dosing with MK-2206 was poorly 
tolerated and dose limiting toxicity was achieved at ≥15 mg/kg/day. In a 4-w eek safety study in 
rats, MK-2206 was administered orally every other day at 75, 150, or 300 mg/kg, followed by a 2-
week recovery period. Treatment-related changes at 150 and 300 mg/kg included mortality of one 
rat with body weight loss in th e 300 mg/kg group; decreases in body weight gain in  the surviving 
rats, with complete recovery in  female rats at 150 mg/kg and a trend towards recovery in the 
remaining rats at 150 and 300 mg/kg;  slight to moderate hematologi c changes with recovery; slight 
to moderate increase in glucose and ALT/AST with  recovery; decreases in the size and weight of 
spleen, thymus, thyroids, and prostate and histomorphologic changes of included biliary 
hyperplasia, inflammation, and crystals in the li ver; tubular degenerati on, acute inflammation, and 
tubular crystals in the kidney; decreased colloid in the thyroid gland; marginal zone depletion of

 the spleen; and islet cell hyperplasi a and vacuolation of the pancreas . At the end of recovery period, 
there was resolution of the changes in the 150 mg /kg group and there was a trend towards recovery 
at 300 mg/kg. There were no trea tment-related change s in the 75 mg/kg group at end of dosing 
phase. The NOAEL was establishe d at 75 mg/kg (AUC0-48 hr: 24.2 μM•hr, Cmax: 2.25 μM).  In 
a 4-week safety study in dogs, MK -2206 was administered every othe r day at 2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg, 
followed by a 2-week recovery period. Treatment-re lated changes at 10 mg/kg included severe 
body weight loss and physical signs of toxicity (d ecreased activity, blood-like substance in feces, 
sore gums and lateral recumbency) requiring early sacrifice of 6 dogs and cessation of dosing at 
10 mg/kg by [CONTACT_147812] 2. 
 
3.5.2 Combined Inhibition of AKT i nhibition and EGFR inhibition 
Rationale and Preclinical Studies of dual EGFR and AKT inhibition 
The PI3K/ AKT pathway is among the critical eff ectors of oncogenic EGFR, and persistent EGFR-
independent signaling through this pathway appears to contribute to erlotinib resistance in some 
NSCLCs.  Preclinical studies in NSCLC suggest a pot ential benefit to dual inhibition of both the 
EGFR and AKT pathways.37,40,42 In the NSCLC cell lines, resistan ce to EGFR TKIs was associated 
with upregulation and persis tent activation of the PI3K/AKT and MAKK pathways.41,[ADDRESS_169350] of each co mpound on cell proliferation was measured and 
compared to the potency of the combined agents by [CONTACT_147813]-Talalay method. Various 
degrees of synergism (combination index (CI)  <0.9) between MK-22 06 and erlotinib were 
observed in eight cell lines, incl uding A431 epi[INVESTIGATOR_147740], which overexpress EGFR. In vitro 
synergistic tumor growth inhibition by [CONTACT_147814] s upported by [CONTACT_147815].  
The ability of MK-2206 to enhance the anti-tumor efficacy of erlotinib was evaluated in the NCI-
H292 human non-small cell lung cancer mouse xenogr aft model. Mice were  treated with two 
regimens of MK-2206 alone (120 mg/kg PO, three times per week on Monday, Wednesday, Friday for 2 weeks, or 360 mg/kg PO once a week on Monday for 2 week s), erlotinib alone (50 mg/kg 
  BATTLE-2 Protocol   
 MDACC 2009-0360 
    November 8, 2019 
 
 
23 
 PO, once per day Monday to Friday), and th e binary combination. Although erlotinib alone 
mediated significant tumor grow th suppression, co-tre atment with MK-2206 produced a dramatic 
enhancement including tumor regression. MK-2206 al one in the three treatm ents per week regimen 
was not efficacious, and the once a week regimen me diated only moderate anti-tumor efficacy. All 
treatments were well tolerated, and no animals died during the course of the treatment. Animals 
experienced weight loss (10.6% or 20.7%) during the treatment period, but they returned to their normal weight by [CONTACT_2006] 16. 
 
3.5.3 Clinical Summary of MK-2206 
The safety of MK-2206 administered on an every other day schedule for 28 days in humans is 
supported by [CONTACT_147816] a Phase I study of MK-2206 in healthy 
volunteers. In the clinic, multiple-dose MK-2206 administered every other day as monotherapy 
and as combination therapy in patients with adva nced cancer has been generally well tolerated; 
however, moderate to severe skin rash has be en identified as a common dose-limiting toxicity. 
Clinical pharmacokinetic data demonstrate the ha lf-life (t½) of MK-2206 to be approximately 55-
81 hours. This information, together with safety da ta from clinical studies supports assessment of 
a once weekly dosing schedule. In addition, pharmacokinetic m odeling and simulation analysis 
suggests potential benefit of a less frequent sc hedule as adverse experien ces may be associated 
with accumulated exposure to MK-2206. The efficacy of once weekly dosing was assessed in 
several ovarian and lung xenograf t studies which directly compared both dosing regimens. Data 
from these studies demonstrate that weekly dosing of MK-2206 as single agent results in similar or enhanced efficacy compared to every other day dosing. 
In healthy volunteers, pharmacokinetics of single-dose MK-2206 (0.25- to 100-mg) 
demonstrated dose proportional behavior. Median Tmax ranged from 6.0 – 8.0 hours and mean 
apparent t1/2 ranged from approximately 55 – 79 hours. Pharmacodynamic activity of MK-2206 
at single doses of 40-, 80-, and 100-mg inhibited AKT to a grea ter extent than placebo, single 
doses at 80- and 100-mg demonstrat ed statistically sign ificant inhibition of AKT compared to 
placebo: 74.78% and 77.85%, respectively. Based on th e mechanism of action of AKT inhibition 
(PI3K pathway) hyperglycemia and hyperinsulin emia are events exp ected to indicate 
pharmacodynamic activity. These events were not observed in healthy volunteers who received 
single-dose MK-2206/Placebo up to  100 mg. MK-2206 is being ev aluated in patients with

 advanced cancer. Four (4) open-label, nonrando mized dose escalation studies (Protocol 002, 003, 
010 and 015) in patients with solid tumors are ongoing to assess th e safety, tolerability, 
pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of multiple-dose MK-2206 administered as 
monotherapy and in combination with selected ch emotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_147741]. Overall MK-
2206 has been generally well tolerated when admi nistered as monotherapy once every other day 
(QOD) and once weekly (QW), as well as once every other day in combination with other anti-
cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Grade 1 to Grade 4 skin rash, associated with pruritus and stomatitis (Grade 1 to 
Grade 3), has been reported as a common treatme nt-related adverse experi ence. Other treatment-
related adverse experiences reported with MK -[ADDRESS_169351] not  been observed in oncology pa tients treated with MK-2206. 
Although Day 1 AUC0-48hr and Cmax values up to 90 mg in cancer patients overlapped with the 
ranges observed in HVs (Protocol 001), overall, MK-2206 exposures in patients with cancer trended somewhat higher on average than those observ ed in HVs. Tmax and apparent terminal t1/[ADDRESS_169352]  Cycle 1 dose exposures were below the dog 
NOAEL AUC0-48hr and Cmax values of 8.52 μM•hr and [ADDRESS_169353] dose, wher e it could be assessed, was low to moderate 
across all dose levels, with CV% values rangi ng from approximately 10 – 60%. For QOD dosing, 
a PD target of ≥70% inhibition of phosphoryl ated AKT (pAKT) in whole blood over a period of 
12 hours has been established, co rresponding to a 56.8 nM C12hr PK target. The PK target was 
achieved in the 60 mg QOD cohort; MK-[ADDRESS_169354] 2 days.

 Meso-scale enzyme-linked immunosorbent assa y (ELISA) was used to measure pre- and 
post-treatment pAKT in whole blood (QOD a nd QW) and tumor tissue (QOD). Although initial 
pAKT assay variability was high and the numbers of  patients in each dose cohort are limited, it 
does appear that substantial pAKT inhibition is demonstrated in both whole blood and tumor at all 
doses levels. 
 
Protocol [ADDRESS_169355] 28 days of treatment (Cycle 1) and during 
the 7-day off-drug period following Cycle 1. Sample s were collected predose and at prespecified 
postdose time points for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assays. MK-2206 was 
administered 2 hours prior to or 2 hours following food or a meal. 
 Preliminary PK results are available for 58 patients who received: • MK-2206 QOD: 30 mg (n=3), 60 mg (n =35), 75 mg (n=3), 90 mg (n=7) 
• MK-2206 QW: 90 mg (n=3), 135 mg (n=4) and 200 mg (n=3) 
For all cohorts evaluated, deviations in PK  sampling (particularly collection of trough 
concentrations) resulted from patient scheduling difficulties, early discontinuations due to disease 
progression and DLT, missed doses, inadvertent overdoses, and dose reductions due to toxicity. 
Although Day 1 AUC0-48hr and Cmax values up to 90 mg in cancer patients overlapped with the 
ranges observed in HVs (Protocol 001), overall, MK-2206 exposures in patients with cancer trended somewhat higher on average than those ob served in HVs. Median Tmax of approximately 
6 hours (median values ranged from 4 – 10 hours)  was observed in both the QOD and QW dosing 
regimens, and harmonic mean apparent terminal half -life (t1/2) values ranged from approximately 
60 – 80 hours, with the exception of the 90 mg QOD cohort. At 90 mg QOD, apparent terminal 
t1/2 was estimable in 1 patient and was approxima tely 50 hours. Tmax and apparent terminal t1/[ADDRESS_169356]  Cycle 1 dose exposures were below the dog 
NOAEL AUC0-48hr and Cmax values of 8.52 μM•hr and [ADDRESS_169357] 
dose MK-2206 AUC0-48hr and Cmax were 1.77 μM•hr and 62.2 nM, respectively, for the 60 mg 
QOD dose, and 14.8 μ M•hr and [ADDRESS_169358] dose, where it could be assess ed, was low to moderate across all dose levels, 
with % CV values ranging from approximately 10 – 60%. There does not appear  to be a substantial 
or consistent departure from dose-proportional ity for either AUC0-48hr or Cmax following the 
first dose up to the 300 mg dose le vel, except for an apparent platea u in exposures ob served at 200 
mg (n=3). Dose proportionality could not be re liably assessed beyond 135 mg (n=4) due to limited 
numbers of patients at each dos e level. This study was not desi gned to rigorousl y assess dose 
proportionality, nor was a formal st atistical analysis carried out; as  such, this conclusion should be 
viewed with some caution. For patients who comple ted dosing as scheduled,  steady state appeared 
to have been approached by [CONTACT_147817]. Based on data from HVs, the expected AUC, Cmax, and Ctrough geometric mean accumula tion ratios ranged from approximately 1.2 –
2.4 for the QOD schedule and were approximately 1.2 for the QW schedule. Where evaluable, 
geometric mean accumulation ratios ranged from approximately 2.5 – 4.3 for the QOD schedule 
and approximately 1.0 – 1.8 from the QW schedule.   
 
  [IP_ADDRESS] Preliminary Pharmacodynamic Summary 
Biomarkers of target engagement (i.e., inhibitio n of AKT phosphorylation)  will be utilized in 
tumor and surrogate tissues to assess the PD activity of MK-2206 in patients with cancer. AKT 
inhibition in whole blood is the primary surroga te PD biomarker. Based on preclinical data, ≥70% 
AKT inhibition in whole blood is expected to be required for efficacy with QOD dosing. AKT 
inhibition will also be evaluated in tumor tissue to  assess target engagement and to correlate with 
AKT inhibition in whole blood. For QOD dosing, a PD target of a minimum of 70% AKT 
inhibition in whole blood over a period of 12 hours  has been established, corresponding to a 56.8 
  BATTLE-2 Protocol

27 
 nM C12hr PK target (determined from PK/PD modeling of HV and oncology patient data). The 
PK target was achieved in the 60 mg QOD cohor t; from an inspection of the concentration-time 
data, MK-2206 trough concentrations were above 56.8 nM by [CONTACT_2006] 7 of dosing in 20 of 33 patients 
with available PK data who ha d completed dosing as scheduled up to that point (mean Ctrough = 
64.7 nM). MK-[ADDRESS_169359] patie nts (23 out of 29) re mained above 56.8 nM 
throughout the dosing interval after approximately 2 weeks of dosing (Day 15 predose 
concentration = 98.0 nM). Appropriate PK and PD ta rgets for QW dosing remain to be determined. 
Following the last Cycle [ADDRESS_169360] 2 days. Meso-scale  enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was 
used to measure pAKT in whole blood (QOD and QW) and tumor tissue (QOD) obtained at 
protocol-specified pre and post-treatment time points during Cycle 1. Some whole blood PD data, 
particularly from patients in the 90-mg cohort, we re not interpretable because of variability in 
results due to pAKT instability and dosing in terruption or reduction due to toxicity. Although 
initial pAKT assay variability is high and the numbers of patients in each dose cohort are limited, 
it does appear that substantial pAKT inhibition is  demonstrated in both whole blood and tumor at 
all doses levels. Based on the mechanism of  action of AKT inhibition (PI3K pathway) 
hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia ar e events expected to  indicate PD activity . In patients with

 Three (3) treatment arms are under evaluation in this study: 
• Treatment Arm 1: MK-2206 + carboplatin + paclitaxel 
• Treatment Arm 2: MK-2206 + docetaxel 
• Treatment Arm 3: MK-2206 + erlotinib 
Doses and regimens planned for evaluation include MK-2206 45- and 60-mg QOD and MK-2206 
90- to 250-mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) combined with standard doses of intravenous 
chemotherapy/oral erlotinib. Preliminary PK resu lts for MK-2206 are available for 13 patients who

 Preliminary pharmacokinet ic data for MK-2206  
MK-2206 PK parameter values for a ll treatment arms were generally  consistent with historical 
data from Protocol 001 and Protocol 002.  Mean Day 1 AUC0-48hr and Cmax values ranged from 
1320 – 1690 nM•hr and 42.9 – 56.9 nM, respectively, across all treatment arms.  By [CONTACT_122317], steady state was approached by [CONTACT_2006] 21 in Treatment Arm 3.  
 Preliminary Pharmacodynamic Summary A PD target of a minimum of 70% AKT inhibi tion in whole blood over a period of 12 hours has 
been established for the QOD monotherapy sc hedule and corresponds to a 56.8 nM C12hr PK 
target (determined from PK/PD modeling of HV and oncology patient data). The PD target for 
AKT inhibition was determined for monotherapy a nd, as suggested by [CONTACT_147818], a 
different degree of AKT inhibition may be required for combination thera py. In Treatment Arm 3, 
the mean Ctrough exceeded the monotherapy concen tration target by [CONTACT_2006] 7; 2 out of 4 patients 
did not attain the PK target. Two (2) out of [ADDRESS_169362] been conducted with MK-2206. In patients with advanced solid 
tumors (Protocol 002), stable disease has been observed in 16 patients on study who received MK-
2206 monotherapy for ≥3 months (range, 3 – 8 months). Earl y indications of anti-tumor activity 
included substantial decreases  in CA125 in some patients with ovarian cancer and PSA 
stabilization in some patient with prostate can cer. Minor RECIST responses, e.g., <30% decreases 
in tumor size, have also been observed in a patien t with melanoma (-16%), a patient with pancreatic 
cancer (- 23%), and in a patient with neuroendocrine tumor (-20% ). No partial responses, e.g., 
confirmed >30% decreases in tumor size, have been observed. 
 
Safety in Humans – Phase I Studies (Protocol 002 and Protocol 003) Protocol 002 
A Phase I Dose-Escalation Study of Oral MK-2 206 in Patients with Locally Advanced or 
Metastatic Solid Tumors Protocol 002 is an ongoing Phase I, multi-cente r, open-label, non-randomized, dose escalating 
study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacod ynamics of MK-2206 in 
patients with locally advanced or metastatic soli d tumors. Patients are admi nistered oral MK-2206 
in repeating 28-day cycles. A 7- day protocol-specified off-drug period occurs following Cycle 1. 
Cohorts of 3-6 patients are en rolled sequentially on escalating doses of  MK-2206. Dosing 
regimens under evaluation include: once every other day (QOD) and once weekly (QW).  
Sequential Dosing for QOD and QW regimens in protocol 002: 
QOD: 30 mg, 60 mg, 90 mg, 135 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, 75 mg 
QW: [ADDRESS_169363] cycle of therapy for dose

experiences such as Grade 3 neutropenia ( ≥7 days), Grade 3 or Grade 4 febrile neutropenia, Grade 
4 thrombocytopenia and Grade 3 to Grade 5 non- hematological adverse experience (excluding 
adverse experiences in the setting of inadequa te compliance with supportive care measures). 
 
  BATTLE-[ADDRESS_169364] been enrolled: 30 mg QOD  (n=3), 60 mg QOD 
(n=43), 90 mg QOD (n=7), 75 mg QOD (n=3), 90 mg QW (n=3), 135 mg QW (n=4), 200 mg QW 
(n=5), and 300 mg QW (n=3). Sixty-five (65) patients have discontinued study medication: 11 
patient due to clinical adverse experiences, 53 patients due to disease progression, and 1 patient

Dose escalation on the QOD schedule proceeded  up through 90 mg. Following observations of 
Grade 3/Grade 4 skin rash in 4 out of 7 patients at 90 mg, dose escal ation above 90 mg QOD 
ceased. Further accrual at 60 mg QOD confirmed safe ty at this dose; theref ore, an intermediate

that an adverse experien ce of Grade 3 skin rash was reported in 1 patient at 200 mg QW. One (1) 
patient who received MK-2206 135 mg QW develope d Grade 1 skin rash. At  higher doses of MK-
2206 evaluated (i.e., 75 mg and 90 mg QOD and 300 mg QW), onset of the rash was within 1.5-2 
weeks of study therapy initiation. Severity at onset  at these higher doses was Grade 3. At all other 
dose levels evaluated, onset was generally follo wing 3-4 weeks of treatment. On average, 
regardless of grade, the duration of  the skin rash was 7 to 14 days  and is characterized by [CONTACT_147819]-
papular lesions on the trunk and limbs, and occasiona lly on the face. An acneiform rash was also 
observed in 1 patient. The rash is at times associated with pruritus (Grade 1 and 3) and at the higher 
doses evaluated stomatitis (Grade 2/3) and conj unctivitis (Grade 1). In the majority of cases, 
Investigators considered the skin rash related to st udy therapy. In cases of m oderate to severe skin 
rash, patients were treated with oral and topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930], anti-pruritic medication and anti-
histamines and antibiotics. This adverse ex perience resolved following interruption or 
discontinuation of study medicati on. Several patients reported ongoing sequelae of dry skin. Other 
DLTs observed in this study include: Grade 3 pruritu s, associated with Grad e 3 skin rash at 90 mg 
QOD, Grade 3 hyperglycemia at 60 mg QOD and Gr ade 2 diarrhea at 75 mg QOD. The adverse 
experiences of Grade 3 hyperglycemia and Grade 2 diarrhea were considered  by [CONTACT_147820]. With the exception of Grade 3 hype rglycemia, these advers e experiences resolved 
following dose interruption and study therapy was re-i nitiated at a reduced dose. Skin rash (i.e., 
rash, erythematous rash, rash macular, exfoliativ e rash, rash papular, rash  pruritic) was the most 
common treatment-related adverse experience reported across all dose levels, occurring in 34 out 
of 69 patients (49.3%). Other common treatment-r elated adverse experiences included nausea 
(20.3%), fatigue (17.4%), pruritus (14.5%), diarrh ea and decreased appetite (13.0%), vomiting and 
hyperglycemia (11.6%), and dry skin (10.1%). These adverse experiences were generally Grade [ADDRESS_169367] 
based on preclinical safety evaluations. Treatm ent-related eye disorders were observed in 6

32 
 patients who received MK-2206 and included: conjunctivitis, dry eyes, eye swelling, foreign body 
sensation, and decreased visual acuity. These ad verse experiences were mild (Grade 1).  
Serious adverse experiences were observed in 26 out of 69 patients (37.7%). Drug related 
serious adverse experiences were  observed in 8 out of 69 patients (11.6%) and included Grade 
3/Grade 4 skin rash and pruritus in 6 patient , Grade 3 hyperglycemia in 1 patient and Grade 2 
vomiting in 1 patient. Five (5) deaths were repor ted during the course of this study. All deaths 
were due to disease progression a nd were not considered by [CONTACT_147821].  Dose interruption or modification occurr ed in 22 patients. Four (4) patients required 
a dose reduction due to skin rash (Grade 2 to Grade 3). Grade 2 diarrhea and Grade 3 hyperglycemia resulted in dose reduction in 2 patie nts. Seventeen (17) patients required an 
interruption in dosing due to trea tment-related adverse experiences. The majority of these adverse 
experiences were skin rash ranging in  severity from Grade [ADDRESS_169368] measures of supportiv e care and resolved 
following an interruption in therapy of approximately  1 – [ADDRESS_169369] (ECI) included ≥ Grade 3 hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. Patients with a history of 
diabetes on insulin or anti-diabetic agents are not permitted to enroll in this study. Additionally, patients with poorly controlled hemoglobin A1c or abnormally elevated fasting blood glucose at screening are also ineligible. Grade 1 to Grade 3 hyperglycemia was reported as an adverse 
experience in 11 out of 69 patien ts (15.9%). This adverse experi ence was considered drug-related 
in 8 out of 69 patients (11.6% ), including [ADDRESS_169370] not been observed in patients treated with MK-2206 QW. In the majority of 
patients no interruption or modifi cation to study medication was required. One (1) patient initiated 
therapy on MK-[ADDRESS_169371] udy therapy was required in  1 patient. This patient 
entered the study with a history of steroid-induc e glucose intolerance. While Day 1 predose blood 
glucose was 8.2 mmol/L (upper limit of normal = 6.0 mmol/L), hemoglobin A1c was 6.1% (upper

The patient was asymptomatic and supportive care  measurements were implemented to manage 
blood glucose levels and included treatment with oral anti-hypergl ycemic medication. Prior to re-
initiating therapy, the patient was discontinued from study medication due to disease progression. 
The adverse experience was continuing at the time of discontinuation. Duri ng the course of the 
study, blood glucose evaluations we re carried out at protocol sp ecified time points. Sixty-eight 
(68) patients had both baseline and at least [ADDRESS_169372]-baseline blood glucos e evaluation. Forty-nine 
(49) out of 68 patients (72.1%) were observed to have elevated blood glucose levels defined as 
hyperglycemia by [CONTACT_4652] v3 Metabolic/La boratory. In addition to hyperglycemia, ≥ Grade 
3 QTc prolongation is a pre-define d ECI based on preclinical findings  in the oral cardiovascular 
telemetry study in conscious dogs. Patients with baseline QTc >450 msec, congenital long QT syndrome, and/or current anti-arrhythmic therap y with known effects of QT prolongation were not 
eligible for enrollment. Cardiac monitoring incl uded multiple ECG evaluations in Cycle 1 and 24-
hour Holter monitoring beginning Day 1 predose. Pr eliminary QTc interval data obtained by 12-
lead ECG monitoring are availabl e for 64 out of 69 patients included in the current safety 
population. Seventeen (17) out of 64 patients (26.6%) enrolled were observed to have QTc interval 
prolongation (>450 msec): • 12 out of 50 patients (24.0%) who received MK-2206 QOD (30- to 90-mg) • 3 out of 14 patients (21.4%) who received MK-2206 QW (90- to 300-mg)

Preliminary Safety Summary of Protocol 003 
As of 3-Feb-10, preliminary adverse experience da ta are available for 18  out of 22 patients who 
received oral MK-2206. Adverse ex periences were observed in 17 out  of 18 patients (94.4%). The 
National Cancer Institute (NCI) – Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
version 3, publishing date 09-Aug-[ADDRESS_169377] 21 days of treatment with combination therapy 
(Cycle 1). 
Skin rash (i.e., rash, rash pruritic) was the most common treatment-related adverse 
experience observed in patient receiving MK-2206 in combination with selected chemotherapy 
and targeted agents. Grade 1 to Gr ade 3 skin rash has b een reported in 9 out of 18 patients (50.0%) 
and was a DLT at MK-2206 45 mg QOD in 1 patie nt in Treatment Arm 1 (MK-2206 + carboplatin 
+ paclitaxel) and 1 patient in Treatment Arm 3 (MK-2206 + erlotinib). The rash is involved the 
face, torso, and limbs and was associated with pr uritus (Grade 1/Grade 2). One (1) patient (MK-
2206 + erlotinib) was observed to have Grade 3 rash involving the torso, charac teristic of treatment 
with MK-2206 and Grade 3 rash invo lving the face, more characteristic of treatment with erlotinib. 
This patient was dose reduced to MK 2206 30 mg QOD and the rash subsequen tly resolved without 
sequelae. All epi[INVESTIGATOR_147742] 3 and met criteria  for DLTs. In all cases, the adverse experience 
occurred within 7 to 11 days of taking study medication. Study medication was discontinued in 
these patients and the remaini ng patients in this cohort con tinued at 45 mg QOD and were 
subsequently discontinued for disease progre ssion.  Other common treatment-related adverse 
experiences observed in this study included vomiti ng and alopecia (33.3%), fatigue, diarrhea, and 
nausea (27.8%), and decreased ap petite and pruritus (22.2%). The majority of these adverse 
experiences are also commonly seen in patients  treated with chemothe rapy regimens alone. 
Additionally, hematologic adve rse experiences such as anemia, neutropenia, and 
thrombocytopenia are also anticipated following tr eatment with chemotherapeutic agents; these 
adverse experiences occurred in <20% of patients treated and were not observed in patients treated 
with MK-2206 + erlotinib.  Other treatment-relate d adverse experiences determined to be DLTs 
included Grade 3 stomatitis occurring in 1 patie nt in Treatment Arm MK-2206 + erlotinib.  One 
(1) patient discontinued study medication due to the clin ical adverse experien ce of Grade 2 skin 
rash. Dose interruption or modifi cation occurred in 9 patients. Th ree (3) patients required a dose 
reduction due to skin rash (Grade 1 to Grade 3) . MK-2206 in these patients,  1 in each treatment 
arm, was dose reduced from 45 mg QOD to 30 mg QOD. Six (6) patients in Treatment Arms [ADDRESS_169378] a dverse experiences re solved following an

 interruption in therapy of approximately 1 week  at which time patients resumed therapy at the 
same dose. Adverse experiences of Grade 4 hype rglycemia (MK-2206 + erlotinib Treatment Arm) 
required a 30-day interruption in st udy medication prior to re-initiation of thera py at the same dose. 
In addition to skin rash, other ECI include hyperg lycemia and cardiovascular events of clinically 
significant bradycardia and QTc prolongation. Grade 3 QTc prolonga tion and bradycardia are pre-
defined ECI based on preclinical findings in the oral cardiovascular tele metry study in conscious 
dogs (Section [IP_ADDRESS]). Patients with baseline QTc >450 msec, congenital long QT syndrome, 
and/or current anti-arrhythmic therapy with know n effects of QT prolonga tion were not eligible 
for enrollment. In addition, patients with evidence of clinically significant bradycardia (<50 bpm), 
or a history of clinically significant bradyarrhythmias such as si ck sinus syndrome, 2nd degree AV 
block (MobitzType 2) or patients taking beta blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel 
blockers, or digoxin were not eligible for enrollm ent.  ECG monitoring in  this study included 
baseline evaluation and [ADDRESS_169379] QTc interval prolongation >450 msec or clinica lly significant bradycardia.  
Patients with a history of diabetes on insulin or ot her anti-diabetic agents are not permitted to enroll 
in this study. Additionally, patient s with poorly controlled hemoglobin A1c or abnormally elevated 
fasting blood glucose at screeni ng are also ineligible. Hyperglycemia was reported as an adverse 
experience in 6 out of 18 patients (33.3%). Epis odes of hyperglycemia were asymptomatic, mild 
and transient. Modification to or discontinua tion of study medication was not required. One (1) 
patient experienced Grade 4 hyperglycemia following 3 cycles of treatment with MK- 2206 45 mg QOD + erlotinib. Treatment of this adverse e xperience included blood glucose management, 
including insulin and oral anti -hyperglycemic medication. The I nvestigator did consider this 
adverse experience related to study medication. St udy therapy was discontinued due to progressive 
disease.  During the course of the study, blood glucose evaluations were carried out at protocol 
specified time points. Sixteen ( 16) patients had both baseline an d at least [ADDRESS_169380]-baseline blood 
glucose evaluation. Fifteen (15) out of 16 patients (93.8%) were observed to have elevated blood glucose levels defined as hyperglycemia by [CONTACT_12134]-CTCAE v3. 
As of early June, 2011 the MK-2206 (QOD and QW) and erlotinib combination Phase1b 
study has accrued a total of 25 patie nts.  Nine (9) patients have re ceived treatment with MK-2206 
at 45 mg QOD and erlotinib at 100 mg QD. Dose-limiting toxicities were observed in two patients,

56,57  The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway plays a central role in the regulation of many 
cellular processes including pr oliferation, survival, differen tiation, apoptosis, motility, and 
metabolism.58,[ADDRESS_169382] understood MAP kinase signal 
transduction pathways, activated by a diverse gr oup of extracellular signals including integrins, 
growth factor receptors (i.e., EGFR, platelet-derived growth fact or receptor [PDGFR], and insulin-
like growth factor-1 re ceptor), and cytokines.60 Activated RAS triggers the phosphorylation and 
activation of RAF kinase which then phosphoryl ates MEK1 and MEK2 on 2 serine residues.61 
Activated MEK phosphorylates its only known substrates, ERK1 and ERK2. Phosphorylated ERK 
dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus62 where it is involved in several important cellular 
functions, including cell proliferation.  Overexpr ession of growth factors or growth factor 
receptors involved in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK path way and activating genetic mutations of the 
signaling proteins may lead to uncontrolled pro liferation and tumor formation. For example, RAS 
genes are the most frequently mutate d oncogenes detected in human tumors.[ADDRESS_169383] all pancreatic

The formulation taken into the Phase I clin ical study by [CONTACT_147822] (Study # ARRY-
0401) was an extemporaneous preparation of an oral suspension of AZD6244 as the free-base in a mix and drink formulation, an aque ous solution of sulphobutylether β-cyclodextrin (SBE-CD, 
Captisol

Sulfate).

inhibited the activity of isolated MEK to phos phorylate extracellular signal-regulated kinase

approximately [ADDRESS_169389] to adenosine

minimal effective dose of 0.75 mg/kg twice daily (BID) was defined. Inhibition of ERK 
phosphorylation was found in tumors in which growth was inhibited by [CONTACT_99213]6244. These data 
show that AZD6244 is pharmacologically active in several tumor types and that tumor phosphorylated ERK (pERK) levels are a potential biomarker for AZD6244 activity in vivo. Mode 
of action studies in vivo demonstrate that AZD [ADDRESS_169391] demonstrated the potential for 
AZD6244 to be used in combinati on with a number of cytotoxic and targeted agents, including 
docetaxel, irinotecan, gemcitabine, Iressa (gefit inib) and AZD2171 (cediranib). N-desmethyl 
AZD6244 (a pharmacologically active metabolite) was identified to be approximately 2–5-fold 
more active than the AZD6244 parent compound.  
 Pharmacokinetic summary 
In preclinical species, AZD6244 free-base showed good oral bioavailability at low doses, but there 
was dose-limited absorption with increasing dose, lik ely reflecting the low a queous solubility of 
the free-base.  AZD6244 Hyd-Sulfate produced a pproximately linear increases in exposure with 
dose and allowed higher exposures to be achieved than with the free-base.  There was no/minimal 
accumulation of AZD6244 (whether dosed as free- base or Hyd-Sulfate) on multiple dosing in 
mouse, rat and monkey.  In ra t and mouse AZD6244-related mate rial was widely distributed, 
although tissue concentrations te nded to be lower than blood concentrations. There was no 
evidence of binding to melanin, and penetration in to the CNS was minimal.  Protein binding was 
high: 99.7% in rat, 98.9% in mouse, 98.4% in  human, 97.7% in monkey, 94.6% in dog and 93.7% 
in Minipig (with similar pr otein binding of N-desmethyl AZD6244 and AZD6244 parent

 compound for each animal species).  AZD6244 is a s ubstrate but not an inhi bitor of p-glycoprotein 
(PgP) and breast cancer re sistance protein (BCRP). 
In vitro, AZD6244 underwent Phase I metabolic  reactions includin g N-demethylation, 
oxidative defluorination, and loss of the side chain, to form amide and acid metabolites. The 
pharmacologically active N-desmethyl metabolite of AZD6244 was detected in vitro in human 
hepatocytes and in human plasma, but  was not detected in rat and was detected on ly at trace levels 
in monkey. This metabolite was formed in mouse, and circulated at levels between approximately 
2% and 12% of AZD6244 levels, although there was evidence that levels declined on multiple 
dosing. Glucuronides of AZD6244 we re detected in human hepatocyte incubations and plasma, 
indicating that direct conjugati on is a significant route of elim ination for AZD6244. Preliminary 
in vitro data in human hepatocytes indicate that  AZD6244 was a weak inducer of cytochrome P450 
(CYP) 3A, 1A and 2C9. At AZD6244 concentrations approximately 10-fold higher than those 
achieved in the clinic, the level of induction was <40% of positive control inducers.AZD6244 was metabolised primarily by [CONTACT_097] 1A2 to produce N-desmethyl AZD6244. Using expressed CYP 
isoforms, it was evident that AZD6244 was also metabolised by [CONTACT_097] 2C19 and CYP 3A4. AZD6244 showed no inhibition of the CYP isoforms 1A2, 2C8, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 at 
concentrations up to [ADDRESS_169392] inhibitor of CYP2C9, with an IC
50 of 44.7 μM. 
N-desmethyl AZD6244 showed weak i nhibition of CYP1A2, with an IC 50 of 18.9 μM. 
 Toxicology summary 
AZD6244 or N-desmethyl AZD6244 showed no evidence  of mutagenic or clastogenic potential in 
vitro. AZD6244 produced an increase in micronucleat ed immature erythrocytes (MIEs) in mouse 
micronucleus studies, predominantly via an aneuge nic mode of action. Daily oral administration 
of AZD6244 free-base in SBE-CD for 1 month was well tolerated in rats, but produce d soft stools, 
and gastrointestinal mucosal mineralization was observed. Tissue mineralization was not apparent 
in cynomolgus monkeys dosed for up to 1 month with AZD6244 free-base or AZD6244 Hyd-
Sulfate. However, mineralization was seen in multiple tissues, including cornea, kidney, liver, myocardium, skeletal muscle, glandular stomach  in mice dosed with AZD6244 Hyd-Sulfate for 
up to 1 month. In mice and rats, tissue mineraliza tion was associated with changes in plasma 
inorganic phosphate and albumin and, in mice, with  changes in calcium. In addition, in mice and 
rats, tissue mineralization was observed in several an imals at the end of a 1 month recovery period.

 Twice-daily oral administration of AZD6244 free-b ase in SBE-CD for 1 m onth produced diarrhea, 
dehydration and electrolyte imbala nce in some monkeys, and with renal changes (tubular epi[INVESTIGATOR_147743]) seco ndary to persistent diarrhea a nd dehydration in some instances. 
Twice-daily oral dosing of AZD6 244 Hyd-Sulfate in SBE-CD al so produced fluid and/or red 
colored feces in monkeys, but with no notable gast rointestinal tract or renal pathology. In mice, 
BID oral dosing with AZD6244 Hyd-Sulfate at non- tolerated dose levels was associated with 
gastrointestinal tract toxicity and hematopoi etic atrophy. Anemia, with an associated 
reticulocytosis, was also  apparent in mice dosed with AZD6244 Hyd-Sulfate. It has been observed 
that AZD6244 absorbs in the u ltraviolet (UV) range for photot oxicity and shows enhanced 
cytotoxicity in the presence of UV light in an in  vitro 3T3 Neutral Red Up take phototoxicity test. 
In rat, AZD6244-related material was widely di stributed throughout tissues , including skin, eye 
and uveal tract, but did not show evidence of mela nin binding.  In the mix and drink formulation, 
AZD6244 free-base has limited solubility and e xhibited a less-than-proportional increase in 
exposure and decreasing bioavail ability with increasing dose in rat and monkey. However, 
enhanced and dose-related increases in exposure were seen in the mouse and monkey with 
AZD6244 Hyd-Sulfate. With the ex ception of tissue mineralization in rats and mice, there was 
evidence of reversibility of mo st changes in the [ADDRESS_169393] adverse 
effects on embryofetal development and survival at dose levels that  do not induce maternal toxicity 
in mice. Six month oral toxicity studies with  AZD6244 Hyd-Sulfate in mice and monkeys are 
currently ongoing. The dosing phas e of these studies has comp leted and histopathological 
evaluation of tissues is current ly ongoing. In the monkey study, the primary in-life observation 
appears to be an increased incidence of liquid feces , which is consistent with that seen in the 1 
month monkey study. In the mous e study, dosing of AZD6244 Hyd-Su lfate to male mice for 8–[ADDRESS_169394] toxicity, tissue mineralizati on and hematological effects, are consistent with 
those seen previous in mice dosed for up to 1 month. 
 
3.6.3 Clinical Studies [IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetic summary 
One hundred (100) mg bid was determined to be the maximum tolerated dose for the AZD6244 
free-base suspension.
69  Seventy-five (75) mg bid was determined to be the MTD for the Hyd-
Sulfate capsule formulation.70  N-desmethyl and amide metabolites are both measured in human 
plasma after dosing with AZD 6244.  AZD6244 pharmacokinetics (PK) was approximately dose 
proportional across the dose ranges studied for both the free-base suspension and Hyd-Sulfate 
capsule formulations.   Single dose pharmacokinetics showed AZD6244 had a median time to reach 
maximum plasma concentration (t max) of 1.5 hours, and a terminal  elimination half-life (t 1/2) of 5 
to 7 hours.  Clearance (CL/F) and steady-state volume of distribution (Vss/F) remained largely 
consistent across the dose rang e studied.  N-desmethyl AZD6244 PK  profile was largely similar 
to AZD6244, but exposures were much lower.  C oncentrations of the amide were very variable. 
 Based on the dose-normalised area under the plasma concentration- time curve from time 0 to 24 
h (AUC
0–24), the estimated oral bioavailability of the Hyd-Sulfate capsule (N=26) relative to the 
free base suspension (N=28) was 263% (90% confid ence intervals [CI] = 214 to 322%), indicating 
a statistically significant increase in the oral bioavailability with the Hyd-Sulfate capsule compared 
to the free-base suspension.71 The AUC0-24 and maximum plasma concentration (C max) geometric 
least squares mean (glsmeans) obtained at the MTD of the Hyd-Sulfate capsule (75 mg) were 
statistically significantly higher than those obtained at the MTD of the free-base suspension 
(100 mg): based on AUC 0–24, the exposure of the Hyd- Sulfate capsule (N=26) relative to the free 
base suspension (N=28) was estimated to be  197% (90% CI = 161 to 242%); based on C max, 252% 
(90% CI = 182 to 348%, N = 27 and 28 for Hyd- Sulfate capsule and free-base suspension, 
respectively), however, there was a relatively large variation in re lative bioavailability between 
patients, and for some the C max and/or AUC 0-[ADDRESS_169395] squares mean 
(Glsmean) C max and AUC were reduced by [CONTACT_147823] 60% and 20%, respectively, under fed 
conditions.  Therefore, it is  recommended for further clini cal studies that AZD6244 should

dosing and 2 hours after dosing). There is no evid ence of a PK interac tion between AZD6244 and 
either docetaxel or dacarbazine, when given in combination.  TPA-i nduced ERK phosphorylation 
in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was inhibited after administration of AZD6244, 
with the magnitude of inhibition being generally related to plasma  concentrations of the drug. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy summary 
There were no significant differences in the primary endpoints of [ADDRESS_169396] chemotherapy regimes in melanoma, pancreatic cancer, colorectal can cer, or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
72-74 
However, objective responses were seen in bot h the melanoma and NSCLC studies.  In the 
melanoma study 6 partial responses were noted in  patients treated with AZD6244, 5 of which were 
in patients with the BRAF mutation.  In the NSCLC study, 2 pa tients treated with AZD6244 had a 
partial response (mutation status unknown).  One patient in Study D1532C00005 treated with AZD6244 capsule formulation (75 mg bid) had a complete response.  This patient had a BRAF+ 
melanoma.

Criteria (Version 3) for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade.  Increas es in plasma phosphate and the 
corrected calcium phosphate produc t have been observed in pati ents treated with AZD6244, 
compared with comparator (with in creases of varying degree seen in  the vast majority of patients 
on AZD6244).  A small mean decrease in albumin has also been observed compared with 
comparator.  No other reports of changes in laboratory parameters were consider ed to be of clinical 
relevance.  Small mean increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure  (SBP and DBP) have 
been observed in patients on AZD6244, compared w ith comparator.  However, >30% of patients 
showed either no change at all or a reduction.  No  clinically significant trends were observed for

of corrected QT interv al (QTcF) prolongation. 
Safety findings from Phase I study (D1532C00005)  with the Hyd-Sulfate capsule formulation 
The adverse event (AE) profile observed in this  study was broadly consistent with that seen 
previously with AZD6244.  There wa s a trend for an increase in SB P and DBP, which had resolved 
by [CONTACT_5875] 12 of the study, and a tre nd for a small increase in weight (at the 75 mg bid dose for Part 
A+B patients the mean increase at week 8 was 1.7 kg).  There was a trend for a decrease in LVEF 
(at the 75 mg bid dose for Part A+B patients the mean decrease at week 8 was -7.2%, range –25% 
to +10%).  Mean increases in ALT, AST and AL P were observed within [ADDRESS_169398], alkaline phosphatase, phosphate, creatini ne, and urea, were observed within normal 
limits.  Small decreases were observed in platelets, BNP, albumin, and total protein, but these remained within normal limits.

3.6.4 Potential Drug Interactions   
In vitro metabolic studies of AZD6244 using hepatocy tes from humans and animals found that the 
biologically active N-desmethyl derivative was de tected in mouse and human hepatocytes, was 
detected minimally in monkeys; and was not detected in rats.67  Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 was 
the enzyme primarily responsible for the formation of the N-desmethyl derivative; CYP2C19 and 
CYP3A4 were also minimally involved in th e transformation. Neither  AZD6244 nor its active 
metabolite was found to be inhibitors of CYP is oforms 1A2, 2C8, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4. However, 
AZD6244 was found to be a weak  inhibitor of CYP2C9 (IC50 = 44.7 uM) and the N-desmethyl 
derivative was a weak i nhibitor of CYP1A2 (IC50 = 18.9 µM). Thus, at the systemic AZD6244 
concentrations observed follo wing 100mg AZD6244 mix and dr ink formulation in man, no 
significant cytochrome P450 interactions would be  expected. Since the formation of N-desmethyl 
AZD6244 from AZD6244 may occur through the CYP 1A2 pathway and smoking induces this 
pathway, the smoking status of the subjects should to be recorded in all studies ( i.e., smoker or 
non-smoker) to investigate whether smoking status  influences systemic drug exposures of N-
desmethyl AZD6244.  
 
[ADDRESS_169404] a required baseline tumor tissue 
biopsy for biomarker analysis, which will determine which treatment arm they will be assigned.  
The tumor tissue will be tested for a comprehe nsive series of biomarkers (Pathology Core 
Appendix III).  Once the subject’s tumor tissue has been profiled, the data will be processed 
through our statistical model where the patient will then be adaptiv ely assigned into one of four 
treatment arms based on the results of the biomarke r and statistical modeling.  The goal is to assign 
the subject into the treatment arm which most fa vors the characteristics of the subject’s tissue 
biomarker profile with high probability. Bayesi an adaptive randomization will be based on the 
updated posterior probability of di sease control rate from the underlying logistic model. The model 
parameters will be continuously updated during the trial when the 8-week disease control status 
for each patient becomes available. Subjects will  be consented by [CONTACT_147824].  Subjects may request information and decide to enroll at a later date.  Follow-up will occur through the research nurse.  Once enrolled into the BATTLE-2 trial, subjects will be randomized into one of the four treatment arms if  they did not receive pr ior erlotinib treatment 
(erlotinib naïve). For subjects who received prior erlotinib (erlotinib resistant), they will be 
randomized into one of the three treatment arms (Arms 2, 3 or 4).  Subject s will receive treatment 
for 2 cycles. A second optional biop sy will be performed after 2 cy cles while on study.  This biopsy 
will be performed only for biomarker modulati on purposes and not diagnostic information. 
Response status will be evaluate d after the second cycle of ther apy, with confirmation of efficacy 
2 cycles after its initial assessm ent.  Subjects with no progression of disease (complete response, 
partial response, or stable disease) will conti nue on therapy.    There are no limits to the number 
of cycles of therapy a patient may receive while  on protocol.  If a subj ect, in the absence of 
progressive disease, experiences intolerable toxiciti es, the investigator may request that the patient 
be discontinued off study.  Opti onal blood samples for biomarkers will be collected at screening, 
end of Cycle 2, and at end of st udy.  Subjects will be s een and enrolled in the Thoracic/Head and 
Neck Medical Oncology clinics.  Subjects may be referred from  outside referring physicians.  
Research nurses will promote awareness of the protocol and facilitate enrollment.  MDACC sees about [ADDRESS_169405] be met before patient is eligible for biopsy to be performed.  Subjects will also be

55 
 Although no pre-medication is nece ssary prior to taking erlotinib, pre-medication will be allowed 
if needed. 
 
5.6 Warnings and Precautions 
Based upon clinical experience to date, the follow ing adverse effects may be associated with 
erlotinib administration: The primary toxicitie s consist of diarrhea, rash, nausea, vomiting, 
headache, and fatigue.  The only dose -limiting toxicity observed to date  is diarrhea.  This event is 
dose-related and is generally cont rolled with the additi on of loperamide therapy, starting doses of 
erlotinib of < 200 mg/day, and do se reductions.  Additional rare  side effects have included: 
interstitial pneumonitis, gastrointestinal irritation  including gastrointestinal perforation, increased 
risk of gastrointestinal bleeding when combined with NSAIDS, stomatitis, anorexia, alopecia, 
pruritis, myalgias, bone pain, cough, dyspnea, and ocular changes.  
 
5.7 Treatment Schema 
Subjects in treatment Arm 1 will take erlotinib (150 mg) orally once daily at approximately the 
same time each day. Tablets should be taken prefer ably in the morning one hour prior or two hours 
after a meal with up to  7 ounces of water. 
 
5.8 Treatment Duration 
Subjects will be treated with erlotinib (150 mg) once daily wit hout interruption. There is no pre-
determined number of cycles or  planned dose interruptions. For th e purposes of evaluation, toxicity 
and clinical efficacy, a four week (28 days) period of treatment will be considered [ADDRESS_169415] or MRI after cycle 2 (8 week s of therapy) and every two cycles of therapy 
thereafter. See Appendix II for methods of response assessment and classification.  
 
5.9 Concomitant Medications and Therapy 
Information on concomitant medications will be collected on this study. Medications for 
supportive care will be allowed as needed to treat nausea, pain, fever, rash, diarrhea, etc.  
Granulocyte growth factors (GCSF or GMCSF) w ill not be given routinely.  Although this drug 
rarely causes hematologic toxicit y, these agents can be administered only in the presence of febrile 
neutropenia (defined as ANC<1000 cells/ L and oral temperature >38.5 C) or Grade 4 
neutropenia lasting more than 4 days.  Erythropoietin can be ad ministered for anemia at the 
discretion of the treating physician.  Commercial suppliers of growth factors will be utilized.  The 
use of growth factors (GSCF, GMCSF and erythr opoietin) will be according to ASCO guidelines.[ADDRESS_169416]’s 
safety and well being, may be given at the discretion of the investigator(s). 
 Data on potential interactions between er lotinib and CYP3A4 inhibitors are lacking. 
Although caution and careful monitoring are re commended when use of these compounds are 
necessary, usage does not exclude s ubjects from participating in this  trial (see Appendix IV for a 
list of CYP3A4 inhibitors). 
 Because of the potential for drug-drug inter action between erlotinib and warfarin, subjects 
in this study who are receiving concomitant warf arin therapy will have INR results obtained at 
screening and during treatment per standard of care .  If radiation therapy is considered necessary 
for the subject at any point during this study, then this will be considered progressive disease and 
the subject will be removed from the study. 
Antacids and other anti-ulcer medications such as proton pu mp inhibitors and histamine 
H2-receptor antagonists may be used if clinically indicated. To avoi d significantly altering gastric 
pH, when needed, these medications should be  used 4 hours after study drug administration.

 5.10 Treatment of Erlotinib Toxi city and Dose Modification: 
Toxicity grading is based on NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (v4.0) and a 
treatment algorithm for the most common toxicities of  diarrhea and skin rash is outlined in Table 
5.1.   
Management of a tolerable Grade [ADDRESS_169417] one Grade level, the dose may 
be re-escalated as tolerated.  In  Phase II trials, this approach enabled dose re-escalation for the 
majority of subjects requiring dose reduction for skin toxicity.  Subj ects experiencing Grade 4 skin 
toxicity should be discontinued from study treatment.     
For Grade 1 or 2 diarrhea, early  intervention should in clude continuation of  erlotinib at the 
current dose and initiation of lope ramide therapy as described in Ta ble 5.1.  Grade 2 diarrhea that 
persists over 48–72 hours, desp ite optimal medical management, should be managed by [CONTACT_147829] 5.2.  Subjects experiencing Grade 3 dia rrhea should interrupt erlotinib 
until resolution to Grade 1 and re-start at a reduced dose a ccording to Table 5.2.  Subjects should 
be maintained at the reduced dos e without attempt at dose re-escal ation.  Subjects experiencing 
Grade 4 diarrhea should be disc ontinued from study treatment. 
In addition, although quite rare , interstitial lung disease (IL D) can be life threatening.  
Therefore, subjects should be mon itored closely for symptoms consistent with ILD, such as new 
onset dyspnea without an obvious caus e.  In the event that ILD is  suspected, erlotinib treatment 
should be discontinued and the subject should re ceive appropriate medical  management.  Although 
there is no proven therapy, systemic corticosteroid s are often provided.  Er lotinib should not be 
restarted in those subjects suspec ted of having drug-related ILD.  See Table 5.[ADDRESS_169418] 
is/may continue deriving benefit from continuing study therapy. Subjects w ith toxicities that are 
manageable with supportive therapy may not require dose reductions.

6.3.2 Warnings and Precautions 
Diet 
Subjects should maintain a normal di et. Subjects are to refrain from  the consumption of grapefruit, 
grapefruit juice, and grapefruit products for appr oximately 2 weeks prior to administration of the 
initial dose of study drug, throughout the study (incl uding the washout intervals between treatment 
periods) until the post-study visit (b ioflavanoid compounds in grapefru it juice and/or grapefruit 
are known to inhibit CYP3A4 activity).  Subjects are also to refrain from consumption of all fruit 
juices during Cycle 1.  Subjects ar e required to fast for [ADDRESS_169428] treatment. 
 
6.3.3 Potential Risks of MK-2206 in combination with Erlotinib  
A brief overview of the potential risks associated with the administration of MK-2206 in 
combination with erlotinib and measures to monito r such potential risks in this trial are outlined 
below:

 [IP_ADDRESS] Skin rash 
Multiple doses of MK-2206 administered QOD induce skin rash in cancer subjects in a dose-
dependent fashion. No skin rash was seen in 3 subjects treated at 30 mg QOD. The skin rash 
observed at 60 mg QOD was of Grade 1 or 2, and th at at 90 mg QOD was of grade 2 or 3. At 90 
mg QOD, skin rash is the DLT with 4 out of 7 subjects developed Grade 3 skin rash.  The skin 
rash develops 3-4 weeks or 10-14 days after treatment initiation at 60 mg QOD or 90 mg QOD 
respectively, and is characterized by [CONTACT_147819]-papular  lesions that begin on the trunk and face, and 
can be acneiform in nature.  The rash can be pr uritic and gradually decr eases in severity and 
disappears upon discontinuation of MK-2206 dosi ng. Based upon the mechanism of action of AKT 
inhibition (PI3K pathway) and the apparent dose-respon se of the rashes, it is likely that this is a 
mechanism-based toxicity, similar to the rash obser ved with other drugs that  target components of 
the PI3K pathway, such as epi[INVESTIGATOR_3506] (EGFR) and mammalian target-of-
rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors. Given the known dermatological side effects associated with 
erlotinib treatment, skin rash is an anticipated toxicity in  the combination of MK-[ADDRESS_169431] assigned to this  treatment will be cl osely monitored for any symptoms of skin 
rash and dose adjustments of MK-2206 and/or er lotinib as well as appr opriate supportive care 
medications will be applied to manage such toxicities.   As of 13-Jan-2010, preliminary adverse experience data are available for 69 patients who received oral MK-2206, among those enro lled in the dose escalation (QOD and QW regimens) and 
expansion cohorts, skin rash was re ported as a DLT in 13 patients:  
• 4 patients at 90 mg QOD • 2 patients at 75 mg QOD • 3 patients at 300 mg QW • 4 patients at 60 mg QOD Twenty-one (21) other patients tr eated at 60 mg QOD developed th e adverse experience of skin 
rash during the course of the study. The severity of the sk in rash in the major ity of these patients 
was Grade 1/Grade 2. No skin rash was observed in patients at 30 mg QOD, 90 mg QW and 200 
mg QW at the time of data cut-off. However, a review of unaudited data since this date indicated that an adverse experien ce of Grade 3 skin rash was reported in 1 patient at 200 mg QW. One (1) 
patient who received MK-2206 135 mg QW develope d Grade 1 skin rash. At higher doses of MK-

 2206 evaluated (i.e., 75 mg and 90 mg QOD and 300 mg QW), onset of the rash was within 1.5-2 
weeks of study therapy initiation. Severity at onset  at these higher doses was Grade 3. At all other 
dose levels evaluated, onset was generally follo wing 3-4 weeks of treatment. On average, 
regardless of grade, the duration of  the skin rash was 7 to 14 days  and is characterized by [CONTACT_147819]-
papular lesions on the trunk and limbs, and occasiona lly on the face. An acneiform rash was also 
observed in 1 patient. The rash is at times associated with pruritus (Grade 1 and 3) and at the higher 
doses evaluated stomatitis (Grade 2/3) and conj unctivitis (Grade 1). In the majority of cases, 
Investigators considered the skin rash related to st udy therapy. In cases of m oderate to severe skin 
rash, patients were treated with oral and topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930], anti-pruritic medication and anti-
histamines and antibiotics. This adverse ex perience resolved following interruption or 
discontinuation of study medicati on. Several patients reported ongoing sequelae of dry skin. Other 
DLTs observed in this study include: Grade 3 pruritu s, associated with Grad e 3 skin rash at 90 mg 
QOD, Grade 3 hyperglycemia at 60 mg QOD and Gr ade 2 diarrhea at 75 mg QOD. The adverse 
experiences of Grade 3 hyperglycemia and Grade 2 diarrhea were considered  by [CONTACT_147820]. With the exception of Grade 3 hype rglycemia, these advers e experiences resolved 
following dose interruption and study therapy was re-i nitiated at a reduced dose. Skin rash (i.e., 
rash, erythematous rash, rash macular, exfoliativ e rash, rash papular, rash  pruritic) was the most 
common treatment-related adverse experience reported across all dose levels, occurring in 34 out 
of 69 patients (49.3%). 
In Protocol 003, skin rash (i.e., rash, rash pruritic) was th e most common treatment-related 
adverse experience observed in patient receiv ing MK-2206 in combination with selected 
chemotherapy and targeted agents. Grade 1 to Grade 3 skin rash has been re ported in 9 out of 18 
patients (50.0%) and was a DLT at MK-2206 45 mg QOD in 1 pa tient in Treatment Arm 3 (MK-
2206 + erlotinib). The rash is involved the face, to rso, and limbs and was associated with pruritus 
(Grade 1/Grade 2). One (1) patient Treatment Ar m [ADDRESS_169432]  Grade 3 rash involving

for DLTs. In all cases, the adverse experience occurred within 7 to 11 days of taking study 
medication. Study medication was discontinued in thes e patients and the remaining patients in this 
cohort continued at 45 mg QOD and were subsequently discontinued for disease progression.

[IP_ADDRESS]  QTc Prolongation 
For this study QTc prolongation is defined as: A single QTc value of ≥ 550 msec or an increase of 
≥ 100 msec from baseline;  
OR  • Two consecutive ECGs measurements, within 48 hour s of one another, in which either of the 
following criteria are met (the second bei ng the mean of 3 consecutive ECGs):  
1. A QTc interval ≥500 msec but <550 msec or  
2. An increase of ≥60 msec, but <100 msec, from baseline QTc to a QTc value ≥480 msec.  
The baseline will be the average of the screening and Day 1 pre-dose QTc values.  
If a QTc value is ≥550 msec or there is an increase in QTc of ≥[ADDRESS_169433] may recommence 
treatment at a reduced dose when his or her QTc has returned to <480 msec.  
1. If a QTc value is ≥500 msec (and <550 msec), or there is  an increase from baseline of ≥60 
msec, but <100 msec, to a QTc value ≥480 msec, then a repeat ECG should be performed 
within 48 hours to confirm the QTc prolonga tion per protocol. If QTc prolongation is 
confirmed, MK-2206 should be withheld. ECGs a nd electrolytes should be checked 3 times 
a week until QTc falls below 480 msec or baseline, whichever is higher.  MK-2206 
treatment may be resumed at a lower dos e based upon dose reducti on schedule after the 
QTc recovers to <[ADDRESS_169434] should continue treat ment and resume the 
ECG schedule as outlined in the Study Plan.

[IP_ADDRESS] Drug-Drug Interactions and Concomitant Therapy  
MK-2206 is not an inducer or inhibitor (IC 50 > 40 μM) of major human P 450 enzymes (CYP3A4, 
2C9 and 2D6).  In human hepatocytes, its metabolism involves both oxidation and direct 
glucuronidation.  The oxidation is mainly catalyzed by [CONTACT_097]3A4. MK-2206 also is a P-gp 
substrate. Based on literature data, erlotinib is not a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor. In general, potential 
risk for substantial drug-drug interactions of MK-2206 combination w ith erlotinib is low.  Other 
possible toxicities of MK-2206 in combination with erlotinib may al so include bone marrow 
suppression, vomiting, and diarrhea.   
Subjects should try and avoid drugs known to  be moderate to strong inhibitors/inducers 
of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. Refer to Appendix for a list of medications with potential CYP3A4 
interaction. The list is not all inclusive, and fo r other concomitant medica tions, the Investigator 
will determine if they are known to signi ficantly influence CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. 
 Drugs known to effect QT prolongation (Appendix VIII) or cu mulative high-dose 
anthracycline therapy are prohibited. 
Antacids and other anti-ulcer medications such as proton pu mp inhibitors and histamine 
H2-receptor antagonists may be used if clinically indicated. To avoi d significantly altering gastric 
pH, when needed, these medications should be  used 4 hours after study drug administration. 
 
6.4 Treatment Schema fo r MK-2206 + Erlotinib  
Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis. MK-[ADDRESS_169437] medication diary.  The diary will be reviewed at the end of Cycle 1 and then Day 1 of each new cycle.

 6.5 Treatment Duration 
In the absence of treatment de lays due to adverse experiences, treatment with MK-2206 and 
erlotinib may continue until there is objective evidence (radiological progression as per the 
RECIST criteria) of tumor progre ssion, or until evidence of toxic ities that are unacceptable and 
thought to be related to study drug, which requires discontinuation of drug, intercurrent  illness that 
prevents further administration of treatment, pregnancy or other se rious protocol violation, subject 
is unable to adhere to study visi t schedule or comply with protoc ol requirements, withdrawal of 
subject consent or at the investigator’s discretion. 
 
6.6 Guidelines for Dose Delay, Modifica tion and Discontinuation for MK-2206 
Toxicities will be graded in severity accordin g to the guidelines out lined in the NCI-CTCAE 
version 4.0.   
Any of the following will be consid ered reasons for dose reduction: 
 Grade ≥ 3 signs or symptoms of  glucose intolerance (inc luding frequent urination, 
excessive thirst, extreme hunger,  unusual weight loss, increa sed fatigue, irritability, and 
blurred vision that interferes with activ ities of daily living) and is accompanied by ≥ Grade 
2 hyperglycemia (glucose >160 dL or 8.9 mmol/L) 
 Fasting glucose >250 mg/dL or 13.9 mmol/L 
 Grade ≥ 3 electrolyte (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Cl, phosphate, and bicarbonate) abnormalities due 
to glucose intolerance and not attributable to another cause 
 Diagnosis of lactoacidosis  or ketoacidosis, or 
 Non-fasting Grade 4 hyperglycemia (g lucose > 500 mg/dL or 27.8 mmol/L) 
 Note: Fasting blood sugars and urine ketones should be checked before breakfast. 
 Persistent increases in QT c interval (>60 ms from ba seline and/or >500 ms), or 
 Clinically significant bradycardia. 
 Intolerable Grade 2 or 3 rash (Grade 4 rash  will require discon tinuation of treatment) 
Any subject who experiences Grade [ADDRESS_169438] resolved to Grade ≤1. After 
resolution of the toxicity, the Investigator will determine whether the individual subject's dose 
should be reduced according to Table 6.1.  If a subj ect experiences toxicity but is benefiting from 
  BATTLE-2 Protocol   
 MDACC 2009-0360 
    November 8, 2019 
 
 
67 
 treatment with a response of SD, PR, or CR, th e Investigator will discuss persistent and/or 
intolerable toxicities to determine if dose modifi cation is warranted. Dose reduction to the next 
lower dose level may be permitted for subsequent treatments.  The dose de-escalation schema is 
provided in Table 6.1.  Subjects can have a maximum of [ADDRESS_169439] is/may continue deriving benefit from continuing 
study therapy. Subjects with toxicities that are manageab le with supportiv e therapy may not 
require dose reductions.  Delays in the treatment schedule for logistical re asons should be avoided, 
if possible. The reason for a dose delay or treatment discontinuation must be recorded. 
If a subject experiences a regimen related toxici ty that requires erlotinib to be held, the 
subject should discontinue taking MK-2206. Once the toxicity has resolved and the subject 
resumes treatment with erlotinib, MK-2206 can also resume.

7.6       Administration  
7.6.1 Route of Administration :  Oral.  
For BID dosing: 
• The morning dose should be take n in the fasted state. Breakfa st can be taken from 1 hour 
following dosing. • Evening doses should not be take n in the 1 hour preceding a meal or in the 2 hours after having 
finished a meal. The doses should be taken approximately 12 hours  apart for example 08:00h and 20:00h or 09:00h 
and 21:00h.   
 7.6.2 Pretreatment Medications 
None required 
 
7.6.3 Warnings and Precautions  
Potential Drug Interactions: AZD6244 is meta bolized by [CONTACT_097]1A2 to N-desmethyl AZD6244 
which is 3-5 fold more pharm acologically active than AZD6244. In vitro, AZD6244 is metabolized 
to a lesser extent by [CONTACT_097]2C19 and CYP3A4.  In vitro, AZD6244 is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9 
and CYP1A2.  
Patient Care Implications: Subjects should not consume grapefruit or its  juice during AZD6244 
treatment. Subjects should be advised to take AZD6244 on an empty stomach either 1 hour before 
or 2 hours after eating with a glass of water.  
 AZD6244 should not be administered to pregnant or breast-feeding women and conception 
while on treatment must be avoided.  Women of child-bearing potenti al with cancer may 
enter clinical studies, provided that they ha ve negative pregnancy tests, and they use 
adequate contraception.

  AZD6244 capsules contain D- α- Tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS, 
a water-soluble form of vitamin E)  as an excipi[INVESTIGATOR_841].  Therefore: 
o Patients should not take vitamin E supplements or multivitamin supplements 
which provide a total daily dose in ex cess of 100% of the recommended daily 
allowance for vitamin E.   
o High doses of vitamin E have been re ported to potentiate the anticoagulant 
activity of coumadins such as warfar in. Patients who are taking coumadin 
anticoagulants should increase the freque ncy of assessment of anticoagulation, 
such as INR measurements, upon in itiation of dosing with AZD6244.  
 Dermatologic toxicity (see below under Potent ial Risks of MK-2206 in  combination with 
AZD6244 Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
 Gastrointestinal: Adverse events of dia rrhea, nausea and vomiting have been reported 
frequently throughout the AZD6244 clinical program .  Most cases of diarrhea start within 
the first [ADDRESS_169443] been self-
limiting or easily managed with anti-emetic  and anti-diarrheal medication such as 
prochlorperazine, 5-HT 3 receptor antagonists and loperamide.  The co-administration of 
AZD6244 with other anti-cancer agen ts, some of which are associated with gastrointestinal 
adverse events, may result in a higher frequency or intensity of these events.  Investigators 
are advised to monitor for signs of such gastro intestinal side effects in subjects receiving 
AZD6244.  
 Hypertension: Increases in sy stolic and diastolic blood pressure have been observed in 
clinical studies w ith AZD6244.  In some subjects these increases result in measurements 
exceeding hypertension guideline thresholds fo r therapeutic interven tion, or exacerbation 
of pre-existing hypertension.  Vital sign measur ements should be performed at regular 
intervals in all subj ects receiving AZD6244.  Investigators should monitor for any increase 
in blood pressure that might  require initiation or augm entation of anti-hypertension 
medication.

  Edema: Subjects receiving AZD6244 frequently  report the development or worsening of 
edema, particularly at peripheral sites or the face.  The underlying etiology of the edema 
and fluid accumulation adverse events is unclear at present.  There is currently no evidence 
to suggest that the edema is due to congestiv e cardiac failure.  Invest igators are advised to 
monitor for signs of such edema effects in subjects receiving AZD6244 that might require 
therapeutic intervention. 
 Left ventricular ejection frac tion (LVEF): Some subjects receiving AZD6244 have been 
observed to develop asymptomatic decreases  in LVEF in the absence of obvious 
confounding comorbidities.  The co-administr ation of AZD6244 with  other anti-cancer 
agents, some of which are known to be associated with cardiotoxicity , may be associated 
with an increased risk of impairment of cardiac functi on.  Specific exclusion criteria 
relating to pre-existing cardiac conditions, such as uncontrolled hype rtension and history 
of cardiomyopathy, will be incorporated into  all studies.  Baseline and sequential 
echocardiogram/multiple gated acquisition (ECHO/MUGA) scans, with additional scans at the occurrence of signs suggesting cardiac dysfunction, will be performed, to assist the evaluation of potential underlying mechanisms for these symptoms.  Serial serum BNP and 
troponin I measurements may also provide additional information on th e etiology of these 
events.  An algorithm for the management and investigation of asymptomatic decreases of 
LVEF has been produced, includi ng the referral of any subject who experiences a clinically 
significant drop in LVEF in the absence of confounding co-morbidity for cardiology 
consultation.  Subjects who have a drop in  LVEF >10% from baseline at time of 
discontinuation of AZD6244 s hould have a follow up echocar diogram performed 30 days 
after permanent discontinuati on of AZD6244 in order to doc ument reversibility. (See 
Appendix VII) 
 Respi[INVESTIGATOR_50127], dyspnea and exertional dyspnea have been reported in subjects 
receiving AZD6244.  The majority of these events have occurred in subjects with 
lung/pleural disease due to their underlying malignancy.  Any new dyspnea event or 
worsening of pre-existing dyspnea > [ADDRESS_169444] dyspnea or interstitial lung disease as li sted adverse events, makes it 
essential to fully evaluate each dyspnea adve rse event in subjects receiving AZD6244.   
 Visual function: Adverse events relating to visual function have been reported at a low 
frequency in all studies.  There were no specif ic treatment emergent structural findings 
reported from those subjects that underwent an ophthalmological evaluation after reporting 
a visual disturbance adverse event.  There we re anecdotal reports of  asymptomatic raised 
intra-ocular pressure at the protocol ma ndated Week [ADDRESS_169445] in one study.  Full 
ophthalmological examinations, including slit lamp examination, should be performed on 
the occurrence of any visual disturbance adverse event in order to document any effects 
that may be linked to the administrati on of AZD6244.  These assessments will be 
supplemented by [CONTACT_147838] 4 of 
continuous dosing in all future studies w ith the capsule formulation of AZD6244 Hyd-
Sulfate.  This will allow id entification of any non-symptoma tic ophthalmologica l changes.  
Finally, all visual adverse events should be followed to evaluate the potential for resolution. 
 Ophthalmologic exam (including slit-lamp) – to  be performed in subjects experiencing 
visual disturbances whilst in the trial. 
 Hematological: A slight decrease in platelet  count was seen in study one study with 
AZD6244, however this was not c onsidered clinically  significant.  No other clinically 
significant changes in hematological parameters were identified across the clinical study program; however hematological parameters need to be monitored. Regular measurements of AST, ALT and other liver function paramete rs will continue to be monitored and the 
health care professionals involve d in clinical studie s should look for signs  of liver toxicity 
in subjects receiving AZD6244. Regular mon itoring of serum  calcium and phosphorus 
levels and the calcium/phosphate product is a dvised in clinical studies with AZD6244. 
 Patients should avoid excessive sun exposure and use adequate suns creen protection (SPF 
80 or higher is recommended for all patients.  Protective clothing (e.g. hat and sunglasses) 
is recommended. 
 Reproductive toxicology data indicate that  AZD6244 has adverse effects on embryofoetal 
development and survival at dos e levels that do not induce maternal toxicity in mice. 
Subsequently, AZD6244 should not be administered to pregnant or breast-feeding women 
  BATTLE-[ADDRESS_169446] dose of AZD6244.  Male patients with sexual partners who are pregnant or who could become pregnant (ie, women of child-bearing potential) 
should use acceptable methods of contraception for 16 weeks after completing the study to 
avoid pregnancy and/or pot ential adverse effects 
 All new dyspnea AEs or worsening of pre-existing dyspnea AEs should be followed according to the dyspnea algorithm in Appendix X.

[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment Duration  
Subjects will be treated with AZD6244 and MK -2206 without interruption. There is no pre-
determined number of cycles or planned dose interruptions. For the purposes of evaluation, toxicity 
and clinical efficacy, a four week (28 days) peri od of treatment will be considered [ADDRESS_169448], the 
smoking status of the subjects should to be recorded in all studies ( i.e., smoker or non-smoker) to 
investigate whether smoking status influences systemic drug exposures of N-desmethyl AZD6244. 
The subject’s current smoking status will be collected. 
Subjects should try and avoid drugs known to  be moderate to strong inhibitors/inducers 
of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. Refer to Appendix IV  for a list of medications with potential 
CYP3A4 interaction. The list is not all inclusive, and for other concomitant medications, the 
Investigator will determine if they are known to significantly influence CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. 
 Drugs known to effect QT prolongation (Appendix VIII) or cu mulative high-dose 
anthracycline therapy are prohibited. 
Antacids and other anti-ulcer medications such as proton pu mp inhibitors and histamine 
H2-receptor antagonists may be used if clinically indicated. To avoi d significantly altering gastric 
pH, when needed, these medications should be  used 4 hours after study drug administration. 
 
7.6.6 Potential Risks of MK-2206 in  combination with AZD6244 
A brief overview of the potential risks associ ated with the administration of MK-2206 in 
combination with AZD6244 and measures to monitor such potential risks in this trial are outlined 
below.

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Hyperglycemia as described for MK-2206 (Section 7.6) 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Skin rash 
Dermatological adverse events are frequently re ported in association with administration of 
AZD6244, with dermatitis acneiform being the most  commonly reported even t starting within the 
first month of treatment.  Other types of dermat ological events occur onl y after a more prolonged 
period of administration with AZD6244, incl uding skin fissures and palmar-plantar 
eythrodysaethesia (hand-foot syndrome).  Where the dermatological AE is CTCAE Grade 3 or 
above, or is intolerable CTCAE Grade 2, a dose holiday (either w ith or without dose reduction) 
may be required to bring the CTCAE intensity to  within tolerable limits, although this may not 
result in total resolution of the symptoms whilst the subject is continuing to receive AZD6244.  
Additional interventions for the management of dermatological ad verse events will be guided by 
[CONTACT_147839].76,[ADDRESS_169449], but did not show evidence of melanin binding.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_147749] (e.g., acneiform rash) reported in s ubjects who have received AZD6244, only one case of 
skin photosensitivity has been reported in a subject taking AZD6244.  However, based on the 
potential for toxicity, investigator s are requested to be vigilant for adverse events that may have 
been caused or exacerbated by [CONTACT_147840]6244.  Subjects 
should be advised to avoid situations of exce ssive sun exposure and to take adequate skin 
protection precautions where sun exposure may be anticipated.   Given the known dermatological side effects associated with MK-2206 treatment, skin rash 
is an anticipated toxicity in the combination of MK-2206 and AZD6244. Subjects assigned to this 
treatment will be closely monitored for any sympto ms of skin rash and dose adjustments of MK-
2206 and/or AZD6244 as well as appropriate supportive care medications will be applied to

 manage such toxicities.  Additional informati on on MK-2206 and treatment emergent skin rash 
can be found in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
 
7.6.7 Drug-Drug Interactions 
MK-2206 is not an inducer or inhibitor (IC 50 > 40 μM) of major human P 450 enzymes (CYP3A4, 
2C9 and 2D6).  In human hepatocytes, its metabolism involves both oxidation and direct 
glucuronidation.  The oxidation is mainly catalyzed by [CONTACT_097]3A4. MK-[ADDRESS_169450] partly due to 
administration of AZD6244, the following dose modification guidance should be applied.  
Treatment with AZD6244 should be withheld if one of the following toxicities considered 
related are observed, despi[INVESTIGATOR_44782]: 
 Any intolerable adverse ev ent regardless of grade 
 Any adverse events CTCAE grade ≥3  
AZD6244 treatment may not be restarted until the toxicity improves to CTCAE grade 1 or 
baseline, except for rash where patients with CTCAE grade 2 rash may restart treatment.  Treatment may be resumed at the original dose or  at a permanently reduced dose (75 mg QD) at 
the discretion of the investigator .  If a subject experiences occu rrence of a new toxicity requiring 
treatment interruption after ha ving restarted on treatment, stu dy medication should again be 
withheld until the toxicity improves to CTCA E grade 1 or baseline, except for rash where 
CTCAE grade 2 rash is acceptable.  Upon recover y, treatment may resume at the previous dose 
level or the dose can be reduced either to  50 mg QD (if no reduction has yet occurred).  
However, if a patient experiences recurrence of th e same toxicity as that causing a previous dose 
interruption and/or dose reduction, study medicat ion should be withheld until the toxicity 
  BATTLE-2 Protocol   
 MDACC 2009-0360 
    November 8, 2019 
 
 
77 
 improves to CTCAE grade 1 or baseline, excep t for rash where CTCAE grade 2 rash is 
acceptable.  Upon recovery, treatment should resume at a permanently reduced dose: 
►75 mg once daily if no dose re duction has yet occurred  
►50 mg once daily Therefore, the dose modification algorithm allows for 2 dose reductions of 
AZD 6244: 100 mg once daily (initial dose) → 75 mg daily (the dose adjustment) → 50 mg once 
daily (the final dose reduction).   
If a patient experiences recurr ence of any toxicity requiring dose interruption whilst receiving  
the lowest dosing schedule for this study (50 mg once daily), the patient must discontinue 
AZD6244 treatment. If a patient receiving the lowest dosing schedule (50 mg once daily) experi ences a novel toxicity 
that cannot be adequately managed by [CONTACT_147841]6244 treatment, as  no further dose reductions/adjustments are 
permitted.  In the event of a dose delay/re duction, subjects should contin ue all other assessments as 
scheduled.  Subjects who are randomized to the treatment arm will be withdrawn from the study 
if they fail to recover to CTCAE Grade [ADDRESS_169451] is/may continue deriving benef it from continuing study therapy. Subjects with 
toxicities that are manageable  with supportive therapy may not require dose reductions.   
 
7.6.9  Dose Modifications for AZD6244 + MK-[ADDRESS_169452] resolved to Grade ≤1. After resolution of the toxicity, the Investigator will determine whether 
the individual subject's dose should be reduced ac cording to Table 7.1.  For Grade 1 or 2 diarrhea, 
early intervention should include continuation of treatm ent at the current dose and initiation of 
loperamide therapy.  Grade 2 di arrhea that persists  over 48–72 hours, despi[INVESTIGATOR_147750]-2 Protocol   
 MDACC 2009-0360 
    November 8, 2019 
 
 
78 
 management, should be managed by [CONTACT_8247] 7.1.  Subjects experiencing 
Grade 3 diarrhea should interrupt treatment until re solution to Grade <[ADDRESS_169453] e xperiences toxicity but is  benefiting from treatment with a response of 
SD, PR, or CR, the Investigator wi ll discuss persistent and/or intole rable toxicities to determine if 
dose modification is warranted. Dose reduction to the next lower dose level may be permitted for subsequent treatments.  The dose de -escalation schema is provided in Table 7.1.  Subjects can have 
a maximum of [ADDRESS_169454] is/may continue deriving benefit from continuing study therapy. Subjects with toxicities that are mana geable with supportive therapy 
may not require dose reductions.  No more than [ADDRESS_169455]’s baseline. 
If a subject experiences a regimen related toxi city that requires AZD6244 to be held, the 
subject should discontinue taking MK-2206, at the discretion of the Investigator. Once the toxicity 
has resolved and the subject  will resume treatment w ith both AZD6244 and MK-2206.   
 Dose Modification for AZD6244  
  BATTLE-[ADDRESS_169456] meets the following 
criteria on Day 1 of each cycle:  ANC > 1,000/mcL, Platelets > 100,000/mcL, non-hematologic 
toxicity recovered to < Gr ade 1 (or baseline), no eviden ce of progressive disease. 
• In the event of an adverse event at least pos sibly related to the agent, the doses of AZD6244 
should be adjusted according to the guidelines shown in the Dose Delays/Dose Modifications 
tables that follow. If an adverse event is not cove red in the table, doses ma y be reduced or held at 
the discretion of the investigat or for the subject’s safety.  
• Subjects with adverse events that are manageab le with supportive ther apy may not require dose 
reductions ( e.g., nausea/vomiting may be treated with an tiemetics, diarrhea may be treated with 
loperamide, and electrolyte abnormalities may be corrected with supplements rather than by [CONTACT_147842]).    
The de-escalation plan for MK-2206 and AZ D6244 is provided in Tables 7.1 and 7.2. 
Dose reduction to the next lower dose may be permitted and will occur as indicated in the below table.  A maximum of 3 dose reductions will be allowed.  De-escalation may occur to a single 
compound (independent of the other compound). 
 
   Management of AZD6244-Related Skin Toxicity 
The etiology of skin toxicities associated with the use of AZD [ADDRESS_169457] practices 
for other contemporary targeted agents that cause skin toxicity is offered as guidance to managing 
skin toxicities seen in patient s being treated on this protocol.
78  
 
The algorithm suggests a step-wise approach to ra sh management.  If the rash is CTCAE grade 1, 
consider starting with topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826] (e.g., hydrocortisone), topi[INVESTIGATOR_147751], or no treatment if the patient is asymptomatic.  Use of topi[INVESTIGATOR_147752]. 
 
  BATTLE-2 Protocol   
 MDACC 2009-0360 
    November 8, 2019 
 
 
80 
 If the rash is CTCAE grade 2, c ontinue topi[INVESTIGATOR_147753] a similar agent. 
 If the rash reaches CTCAE grad e 3 or above, dose interruption a nd/or dose reduction, coupled with 
the addition of topi[INVESTIGATOR_147754]. 
 
Pruritus of any grade may be treated with an antihistamine, such as diphenhydramine or hydroxyzine hydrochloride. 
 
Xerosis can be treated with classical emollients.  
 
Secondary infection may complicate or worsen skin  toxicity.  To reduce the likelihood of nasal 
infection, intranasal mupi[INVESTIGATOR_147755] d.  Infected rash may be treated with a short 
course of an oral tetracycline,  such as doxycycline.  Sun exposure should be avoided in patients 
receiving doxycycline or othe r tetracycline antibiotics.

   8 SORAFENIB (BAY 43-9006®) 
8.[ADDRESS_169459] 
Sorafenib is a potent inhibitor of Raf kinase (c-Raf IC 50 = 2 nM, B-raf wild type IC50 = 25nM, B-raf 
mutant = 38nM) in vitro, in cells, and ( in vivo), with significant dose-dependent anti-tumor activity in four 
different human tumor xenografts including lung, colon, panc reatic, and ovarian carcinomas.  Additionally, 
sorafenib is also a potent inhibitor of VEGF-R-2, in vitro, (with an IC50 of 90 nM).  Anti-cancer activity 
was observed in cancers that have Ras mutations, as well  as in cancers without Ras mutations.  This suggests 
a potential use of this compound in a large spectrum of cancer types, including tumors with a variety of molecular etiologies, all of which have not yet been defined.  Observed anticancer activity was cytostatic 
in nature and was maintained upon continuation of dosing.  Sorafenib demonstrated significant anti-tumor 
activity also against large (400mg–1g) colon and ovari an tumors, producing some tumor regressions during 
the dosing period 
  BATTLE-[ADDRESS_169460]-line treatment. Although the 
single-agent study in patients with  refractory or recurrent NSCLC (one to two prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) 
showed some activity (disease control in  30 of 48 patients and TTP of 103 days)[ADDRESS_169461] line and beyond, revealed 
that out of 97 patients randomized revealed, SD in 47% in S arm and 19% of P, a median PFS 
favoring sorafenib (3.6 months) versus placebo (2.0 months) (p=0.009).  These data suggest that enriching the trial population for pati ents with slower growing disease,  leads to clinical benefit and 
prolonged PFS  in this heavily pre-treated population.
82 
Evidence from BATTLE-1 trial  (overall 8- week DCR 58% and up to 79% 8 week DCR 
within KRAS/bRAF biomarker group)  and some  preliminary evidence from a small trial83 in 10 
patients selected for the presence  of  K-Ras mutation in their tumor (4 G12V, 4 G12C, 1 G12A, 
and 1 G13S), in which three partial remissions (PRs) and three minimal responses (MRs) 5 of

    November 8, 2019

 which were associated with tumo r cavitation were observed with a median PFS of 3 months (95% 
CI: 2.2–3.8 months) warrant further study of the agent in biomarker selected populations.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_169462] shown that, on average, less than 20% of the 
administered dose is excreted in the urine.  This is in contrast to pre- clinical data showing that the 
kidneys excrete less than 10% of  BAY 43-9006.  Thus, even in the presence of complete shutdown 
of renal clearance of the drug, it is  expected that a sm all increase in exposure may be observed; 
one, which is within the realm of the sizeable inte r-patient variability that has been, observed in 
Phase I trials. 
 
8.5 Rationale for studying Sorafe nib in patients with NSCLC 
Unresectable and/or metastatic NSCLC is a cancer  with few successful therapeutic options.  As 
responses were seen in multiple tumor types wh en sorafenib was administered to patients, 
including those with NSCLC, an expanded evaluati on of the anti-cancer activity of sorafenib (a 
Raf kinase inhibitor) in patient s with NSCLC is sought.  Ras functions downstream of several 
receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) and its activa tion are an important mechanism by [CONTACT_147843]. Ras activation can be induced by [CONTACT_147844], or by [CONTACT_147845] (epi[INVESTIGATOR_5169], vascular endothe lial growth factor, or pl atelet-derived growth 
factor).  Thus the Ras pathway is a central mediat or of cellular proliferatio n and survival in human 
tumors.  Raf/Ras signaling is a principle downstream pathway in NSCLC.  Mutations in the 
Raf/Ras pathway occur in approximately 15%-30%  of NSCLC, which makes the Ras/Raf pathway 
a potential target for new therapeutic agents in lung  cancer. The current stud y is designed to further 
explore the anti-cancer activity, efficacy, safety, and tolerability of sorafenib in selected patients 
with NSCLC who express mutated Ras or Raf.  
 
8.[ADDRESS_169463] doses tested was skin 
toxicity.  When all available da ta from the various Phase I studies/schedules were combined, the 
incidence of > grade 3 treatment emergent skin toxicity (e.g., Hand-Foot Syndrome and 
“dermatology/skin reaction”) for an initial dose of 400 mg twice daily and 600 mg twice daily, 
  BATTLE-2 Protocol   
 MDACC 2009-0360 
    November 8, 2019 
 
 
84 
 was 3.2% and 31.6%, respectively.  Grade 3 Hand-Foot Syndrome is defined as “skin changes 
with pain, interfering with function”, according to the NCI-CTC, Version 3.0, which was used to 
grade toxicity in all [ADDRESS_169464] been treated in 3 ongoing Phase II trials at the 400 mg bid dose.  Consistence with this, less than  7% of patients have experienced Gr ade 3 Hand-Foot Syndrome in Phase II 
trials (preliminary data).  Based on the Phase I experience, the recommended Phase II dose and schedule is 400 mg (2x200 mg tablets) twice da ily administered orally in a continuous, 
uninterrupted fashion.  
8.7 Dose Delays or Dose Modifications 
Doses will be delayed or reduced in case of toxicities, which are possibly, probably or definitely 
related to protocol therapy.  Toxicities will be graded us ing the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria Version 4.0.  In all cases , patients who are prematurely w ithdrawn from the study due to 
toxicity event(s) must be followed until resolution of the event(s), and then every [ADDRESS_169465] level will 
be used.  All dose modifications will follow predefined dose levels: Dose level 1: 400 mg (2x200 mg) po q 12 hr Dose level 2:  400 mg (2x200 mg) po q daily 
  BATTLE-[ADDRESS_169466] their signs and symptoms graded

9.8 Evaluation criteria  
9.8.1 Tumor Response 
The initial tumor response (unidimensionally measur ed disease) will be as sessed at the completion 
of two cycles of therapy, and will be compared  to pre-treatment values.  Subsequent tumor 
response for subjects receiving therapy will be  assessed following the completion of every two 
cycles of therapy.  Responses will  be based on a comparison to the pre-treatment tumor evaluation.  
All subjects who have received treat ment with at least one cycle of treatment will be considered 
evaluable for response.  Imaging and diagnostic st udies of measurable and evaluable tumors should 
be repeated following every two cycl es of therapy.  (See Appendix II) 
NOTE:  The pre-treatment and all subsequent imag ing and diagnostic studies should be obtained 
from the same source, for example, CT scan or MRI.  Each response para meter will be reported 
independently.  Responses are to be scored based on measurable and nonmeasurable criteria and 
overall response to therapy.

should be performed within ± 7 days of the sche duled day of assessment ex cept for adverse events 
which will be evaluated continuously through the study. Safety and tolerability will be assessed 
according to the
 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0. 
 10.1  Adverse Events and Adverse Event Reporting 
Information about all adverse even ts (CTC Grades 1-5 and all at tributions), whether volunteered 
by [CONTACT_423], discovered by [CONTACT_424], or detected  through physical examination, 
laboratory test or other means, will be collected and recorded and followed as appropriate.  
Adverse events along with grade, start/stop dates,  and attribution to each drug will be documented 
in the medical record.  Based upon best clinical  judgment, the treating investigator will assign 
attribution of adverse events to  each study agent separately.   
  
 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of 
either the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
 
 Death 
 A life-threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experience that places the 
patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse 
  BATTLE-[ADDRESS_169492] caused death. 
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_43242] 
 A persistent or significant in capacity or substantial disrup tion of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions. 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-th reatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_147756] a serious adverse drug  experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one  of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Examples of such medical events include alle rgic bronchospasm requiri ng intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home, blood dys crasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the developmen t of drug dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR 
312.32).  
 Important medical events as defined above may also be considered serious adverse 
events. Any important medical event can and should be reported as an SAE if deemed 
appropriate by [CONTACT_147856] e IND Sponsor, IND Office.  
 All events occurring during th e conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of a 
SAE must be reported to the IRB in accordan ce with the timeframes and procedures 
outlined in “University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. A nderson Cancer Center Institutional Review 
Board Policy on Reporting Serious Adverse Even ts”.  Unless stated otherwise in the 
protocol, all SAEs, expected or unexpecte d, must be reported to the IND Office, 
regardless of attribution (within 5 working days of knowledge of the event). 
 The MDACC “Internal SAE Report Form for Prompt Reporting” will be used for 
reporting to the IND Office.

taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.   
Any pregnancy that occurs during study particip ation should be reported  to the IND Office. 
To ensure subject safety each pregnancy must  also be reported to [COMPANY_006] & Co., Inc., OSI 
Pharmaceuticals, [COMPANY_008] and Bayer when app licable. The pregnancy should be followed up 
to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities or maternal and newborn complications. 
 
 11 STATISTICAL DESIGN AND DATA ANALYSIS CONSIDERATIONS 11.1 Background and Design 
  BATTLE-2 Protocol   
 MDACC 2009-0360 
    November 8, 2019 
 
 
103 
 The target population for the BATTLE-2 trial is patient s with advanced stage, treatment-refractory, 
non-small cell lung cancer (N SCLC).  The following four treatments will be studied: the EGFR 
inhibitor erlotinib (Arm  1, serving as a control group), er lotinib + an AKT-inhibitor (MK-2206) 
(Arm 2), a MEK-inhibitor (AZD 6244) + MK-2206 (Arm 3), and sorafenib (Arm 4).  The main 
statistical goals for the BATTLE-2 trial includes: (1) to test treatment efficacy for the proposed 
agents, (2) to identify prognostic and predictive markers for novel combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and (3) 
to select treatments based on marker status of patients such that better treatments are provide 
individually for patients enrolled in the trial.  The primary endpoi nt for the study is the 8-week 
disease control rate (DCR).  
Based on the SWOG experience84 and a previous trial in  this population, BATTLE-1, 8-
week DCR is a good surrogate of overall survival .  Patients with EGFR  mutation or EML4-ALK 
mutation will be excluded as there are known eff ective treatments.  Patients with insufficient 
material to determine mutational status will be a llowed randomization if the patient is otherwise 
eligible for the study.  Patients with prior erlo tinib treatment will not be randomized into the 
erlotinib only arm.  
A total of [ADDRESS_169503] age NSCLC will be enrolled over a 4-
year period. The trial will be bi opsy-based and biomarker-driven.  All subjects will be consented 
for a mandated biopsy before being randomized to the study’s treatment arms.  Biomarkers in subjects’ samples will be analyzed to guide the treatment choice.  With a conservative estimate 
that 10% of the subjects may have incomplete marker profiles due to limited numbers of tumor 
cells in biopsy samples, a tota l of 450 subjects will be enrolled.

As shown in the study timeline in Figure 11.1, the study will be conducted in three defined steps:  
 Stage 1 – Initial adaptive randomization (AR) of about 200 patients based on the KRAS  
(codons 12, 13 and 61 taken together) mutation.   
 Biomarker analysis at end of Stage [ADDRESS_169504] prognostic and/or predictive markers (either individu al and/or composite markers) 
to form a refined predictive model to be applied in Stage 2 AR.  
 Stage 2 – Refined AR of the remaining 200 patients based on the model with all the markers 
selected from the previously mentioned analysis.   
 
An early futility stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_147761] 70 patients are random ized. If all the three 
experimental treatments (Arms 2, 3, 4) are not pr omising in all patients  and all sub-populations 
determined by [CONTACT_147859], the trial will be stop early. 
Starting from the 71 th patient, the early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_147762].   In Stage 1, 200 subjects will be adaptively randomized into one of the four treatment arms (three treatment arms for prior erlotinib treated patients) based solely on KRAS mutation status, which is Year 0           1 2 4 3 5

other targeted agents. Patients with insufficient material to determine KRAS mutational status will 
be allowed randomization if the patient is otherwis e eligible for the study. They will be considered 
as wild type patients for the randomization purpose. Concurrently throughout Stage 1, up to 30 
putative candidate biomarkers will also be analyzed in subjects’ tissu e and blood samples.

Those data will be analyzed by [CONTACT_147860] a refined 
predictive model.  We will identify the “best-pe rforming” markers from Stage [ADDRESS_169506] of putative markers selected in  the final model.  In addition, 
because the previous trial (BATTLE-1) also cont ained an erlotinib-only arm, predictive marker 
findings from BATTLE-[ADDRESS_169507] 80% power with a 10% type I error for testing the efficacy of each  combination treatment 
as well as identifying important pr ognostic and predictive markers.  
 To facilitate the trial conduct, a BATTLE-2 Web-based database application for 
registration, biomarker analysis, randomization, and follow up will be built.  In addition to registering into the institutional database CORe, all subjects' information will be entered into the 
BATTLE-2 database.  The biopsy and bi omarker analysis results will be  entered into the database.  
The adaptive randomization module is integrated to the database applicatio n through web-services.  
Subjects will be adaptively randomized to one of  the four treatment arms according to their 
biomarker profiles. Follow-up information including the 8-week disease control status will be monitored and entered timely to facilitate the AR.  
11.2 Assumptions 
We assume that the true model contains 5 important markers ( K=5). All markers are binary with 
20% marker positive for M
1 (KRAS mutation), and 50% marker positive for  M2 M3, M4 and M 5. 
Based on our BATTLE-1 experience, we assume th at 40% of the patient s had prior erlotinib 
treatment. The true 8-week DCRs under the nul l and the alternative hypotheses assumed in the 
simulation studies are listed in Table 11.2. For patien ts with prior erlotinib treatment, they will not 
be treated on erlotinib-only ar m (control arm). Under the null hypot hesis, the 8-week DCRs for 
erlotinib-naïve patients are assumed to be 30% or 10% depending on the KRAS mutation status.  
For erlotinib-resistant patient s, the corresponding 8-week D CRs are 20% or 1%. Under the 
alternative hypothesis, when predictive markers are identified for each of the combination 
treatments, the 8-week DCR is assumed to be 80% in erlotinib-naïve patients and 70% in erlotinib-
resistant patients. Both the null and alternative scenar ios listed in Table 11.2 are evaluated via 
simulation studies.

 11.3. Statistical Models 
A Bayesian logistic regression model is applied as  the backbone of the statistical framework to 
model the probability of the 8- week DCR given treatments and markers.  Without loss of 
generality, we assume M
1 is the pre-specified marker (KRAS mutation) and M 2 to MK are the 
selected treatment-specific markers in the refined model. If we suppress th e index of patients, the 
8-week DCR, p j, for patients on Arm j  can be written as follows,

the marker indicator for Marker k, k=1, …, K, and Z is the indicator for prior erlotinib treatment 
(i.e., erlotinib resistance). In addition to the full  model in Equation (1), a reduced model is also

The efficacy of the new treatments (Arm 2, Arm 3, Arm 4) will be compared with the erlotinib 
only arm (Arm 1).   
 The treatment effects  will be tested in two steps: First, we  will test for the marginal treatment 
effect using the reduced model shown in Equati on (2).  By [CONTACT_147862], 
experimental treatment j (j =2, 3, 4) will be claimed as having a significant marginal treatment 
effect if 
Pr( 0)j in erlotinib-naïve patients or if Pr( ' 0)jj  in erlotinib-resistant 
patients, where  is the threshold value for posterior inference. Next, we will test the treatment 
effect under the full model in Equation (1) incor porating the treatment by [CONTACT_147863].  A 
success will be claimed for treatment j (j =2, 3, 4) in marker k positive patients, if 
Pr( 0)jj k  for erlotinib-naïve patients and if ''Pr( 0)j j jk jk    for erlotinib-
resistant patients. We choose  to control the type I error rate . As shown in Table 11.2 the true 
DCRs of erlotinib-resistant patien ts are expected to be lower than those in the erlotinib-naïve 
patients. A common control (erlotinib only treatment in erlotinib-naïve patients) is used for testing 
treatment efficacy in both naïve and resistant patie nts. It is a more conservative approach because 
the DCRs in erlotinib-resistant patient s are compared to a higher bar.  
 
11.4. Adaptive Randomization Procedures 
We apply the response AR throughout the trial to trea t patients more effectively in the trial.  Due 
to the delay in observing the outcome, AR will start to kick in after the first [ADDRESS_169508] 
01 1 1 1 logit( )j jj j j jj pT M T M T Z                      (3) 
The probability of a patient being assigned to the jth arm is proportional to the square root of 
'Pr( , ' {1,2,3,4| ' })jjpp j jj  , which corresponds to the posterior probability of the jth arm 
having the largest DCR among all treatments. A nor mal prior with mean zero is used for each of 
the parameters in Equation (1), and a large varian ce of [ADDRESS_169509] the extreme allocation rate s. If the allocation probability to certain 
arm is less than 0.2 or greater than 0.8, the original  value of allocation probability will be replaced 
by 0.2 or 0.8, and the real allocation rate will be determined by [CONTACT_147864] 4 arms. Similarly, AR in Stage 2 is 
performed based on comparing the DCRs among trea tments. At the time of a new patient being 
randomized, DCRs are computed fr om Equation (1) after incorporat ing all treatment, marker, and 
outcome information from all available data at the time. The randomization probability is similar 
to the one shown in Stage 1 but we do not take the square root transformation to allow more 
patients to be randomized into better arms.  Note  that in both Stage 1 an d Stage 2, erlotinib-naïve 
patients can be randomized to one of the four tr eatments while erlotinib-resistant patients will only 
be randomized to one of the three treatments (Arms 2, 3, or 4) by [CONTACT_8345].  
During AR, we also allow trial to be stopped ea rly for the futility if all three experimental 
arms fail in all patients and in all marker groups after at least 70 patients ha ve been treated in the 
trial.  In particular, th e trial will be stopped if

stopped as long as one of the experimental arms is promising in a sub-population defined by [CONTACT_147865] e AR model. In our simulation, δ is set at -0.442 corresponding

 to a 0.1 increment of DCR from 0.3.  s is set at 0.[ADDRESS_169510] (k), and predictive effect will be ch aracterized by a large marker-treatment 
interaction term (jk or '
jk). A marker will be deemed as being important if it has either a 
prognostic effect or a predictive effect. To facil itate the identification of  prognostic and predictive 
effects, we apply the least absolute shrinkage and selec tion operator (La sso) method and 
implement the marker selection procedure through a Bayesian tw o-step Lasso strategy. Laplace 
prior is used in Bayesian Lasso for covariates effects. Laplace prior can shrink covariates 
estimation towards zero, and smaller covariate eff ects will be penalized more. Therefore, Bayesian 
Lasso can result in good estimation a nd variable selection simultaneously85 Specifically, the first 
step of variable selection is a group selection aimed at the identification of markers with either 
prognostic effects or predictive effects. Markers without any effects will be screened out by [CONTACT_147866]. The second step is a step-down test to further examine each individual marker and its 
interactions with the treatments. In order to obtain more consistent estimates for the model 
parameters, we use a Bayesian version of the adaptive Lasso86 to provide finer variable selection 
and estimation in the second step. The final refine d model will be used in adaptively randomizing 
patients in the second stage of the trial.    
In the first step of variable selection, we group marker main effect and marker-treatment 
interactions into a vector and apply Bayesian group Lasso method to select important markers.87,88

prognostic and/or predictive markers will be identif ied for the refined AR model. We are most 
directly interested in predictive markers, but their effects will be evaluated in the light of prognostic 
markers (if any exist) for two reasons: (a) There could be interactions between the two types of 
markers. (b) Identification of the context fo rmed by [CONTACT_147867] a predictive marker (similar to a stratified 
analysis). Marker selection will be conducted in three steps: training, te sting, and validation as 
described below.  
 
(1) Training: Gleaning from a wealth of inform ation from the BATTLE-[ADDRESS_169513] be identif ied externally to the BATTLE-2 trial. 
 
(2) Testing: The candidate markers identified in the training step will be te sted in Stage 1 of the 
BATTLE-2 trial in the following sequences. (a) Assessment of predictive strength : each marker 
will be evaluated for their predictiv e strength for each treatment.  A marker passes this screen if it 
  BATTLE-[ADDRESS_169514] 0.925 that the difference in disease control rate between the 
marker positive and negative groups exceeds 20%. Sp ecifically, each of the pre-selected markers 
or signatures will be viewed as a dichotomous variable.  In each arm of the trial, we let P be the 
DCR in the marker-positive group and let N be the DCR in the marke r-negative group. We model 
the disease control R of a patient in marker group X  as a binomial random variable, R ~ 
Binomial( X). We assume that both DCR parameters arise from a common beta distribution, 
Beta(a, b) and use a noninformative Jeffrey’s prior.  We compute the posterior probability,  = 
Pr(|P - N|> 0.20), i.e., the difference in DCR is at least 20%. A marker  passes the screening phase 
if  > 0.925 (chosen to control a 5% family-wise type  I error rate in 30 ma rkers via simulations). 
For example, if 50 patients are assigned to a tr eatment in Stage 1 with 5/25 (20%) DCR in the 
marker-negative group and 17/25 (68%) D CR in the marker-positive group, then   = 0.95. 
However, if there are only 10/25 (40%) DCR in the marker-positive group, then  = 0.31. The 
marker passes the screening in the former case but fails in the later case. (b) Variable selection : 
All markers that pass the assessment phase will be subject to a variable se lection process applying 
a Bayesian two-step leas t absolute shrinkage a nd selection operator (L asso) method. The Laplace 
prior is used for covariates effects to shri nk covariates estimation towards zero and smaller 
covariate effects will be penalized more. Ther efore, the Bayesian Lasso can result in good 
estimation and accurate variable selection simultane ously. Specifically, the fi rst step of variable 
selection is a group selection aime d at the identification of marker s with either prognostic effects 
or predictive effects. We group mark er main effect and marker-treatme nt interactions into a vector 
and apply the Bayesian group Lasso method to se lect important markers.  Markers without any 
effects will be dropped by [CONTACT_147868]. The second step  is a step-down test to further examine each 
individual marker and its intera ctions with the treatments. In order to obtain mo re consistent 
estimates for the model parameters, we use a Baye sian adaptive Lasso to provide finer variable 
selection and estimation in the second step. A marker  will be selected if th e coefficient of an 80% 
highest probability interval excludes zero. The cal culation incorporates uncertainty in variable 
selection and automatically prevents over-fitting of  data. If more than two markers are identified 
for a given treatment, a composite marker will be formed by [CONTACT_147869] 80%  of the variability. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], 
one or two principal components as  linear combinations of predic tive markers will be identified

 per treatment. (c) Verification: Biomarker data from the rigor ous statistical assessment and 
selection procedures will be review ed by [CONTACT_147870]/external advisors to ensure the validity of the 
process and efficient transition of selected mark ers to a CLIA-certified environment.  Upon 
verification, the refined model will be constructe d to adaptively randomize patients in the second 
stage of the trial. 
 
(3) Validation: The prognostic/predi ctive markers identified in the testing step will be used to 
refine the predictive model, perform the AR, and va lidated in Stage 2 of th e BATTLE-2 trial. It is 
estimated that approximately 30 candidate marker s will be selected in the training step. Among 
them, 15 will pass the assessment of the markers’ predictive strength and 4 to 6 will remain after 
variable selection and verificati on in the testing step. These markers will be used for Stage 2 AR 
and validated accordingly.   
  
11.7 Simulation Results 
We assume that the true model is given in equa tion (1) with the parameters estimated from the 
DCRs listed in Table 11.2. Two thousand simulation runs were carried out to study the operating 
characteristics of the design.  The statistical po wer for testing the efficacy of the experimental 
treatments (Arms 2, 3 and 4) versus the standard tr eatment (Arm 1) at the end of Stage [ADDRESS_169515] (either Arm 2 or Arm 3 
or Arm 4 is effective) is shown in column 9.  Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_147766]  [ADDRESS_169516]. Using this cutoff, the 
type I error rate in the null case is controlled at  10% for each treatment.  In the alternative case, 
with [ADDRESS_169517] 82%, 95% and 84% power for 
testing the treatment effect for Arms 2, 3 and 4,  respectively.  The overall power for the trial is 
98% in alternative case, and the overall type I error is 20% in null case. While the null case was 
stopped early 58% of the time with an average sample size of 140, the alternative case was barely 
stopped early in the [ADDRESS_169518] at the end of Stage 2 will 
be sufficiently high with more pa tients enrolled, hence, not given. 
The marker selection probabilities for al l simulation cases are shown in Table 11.4. A 
total of 15 markers were generate d. Markers are selected by [CONTACT_147871]. A 30% quantile value of posterior  distribution is used in the 
group selection. An 80% credible in terval is used for the final ma rker selection as described in 
Section 11.4. Markers with either significant main effect (associa ted with Arm 1) or significant 
interactions (associated with Arm 2, 3, or 4) are defined as significant for the marginal marker 
effect.  Under the null hypothesis, the probability of sel ection is less than 4% in Stage 1 and less 
than 3% in Stage 2 for all markers except Marker  1(selection probabilitie s are 28% in both stage 
1 and stage 2). Marker [ADDRESS_169519] (prognostic marker) in both scenarios. Ther efore, the higher selection probability of Marker 1 is 
reasonable. Under the alternative hypothes is, the probabilities of se lection for M1, M2, M3, M4, 
and M5 are about 76%, 92%, 90%, 87%, and 89% at the end of Stage 2, respectively.  The 
probability of selecting unimportant marker is unde r 15% at the end of Stage 1 and 8% at the end 
of Stage 2. As shown in Table 11.4, M3, M4 an d M5 have higher selection probabilities for 
Arms 2, [ADDRESS_169520] and second 
stage of the proportion of treatment assignment.  Erlotinib-naïve patients are assigned slightly 
lower proportion in treatment 1, but evenly to treatment 2, 3, and 4. Erlotinib-resistant patients 
are assigned evenly to the three e xperimental treatments (2, 3, and 4).  Patients are also allocated 
lower proportion in treatment 1, but no differences  in the treatment 2, 3, and 4 in each of the 
marker groups. Under the alternative hypothesis, erlotinib-naïve patien ts are assigned with 
higher proportion to Arms 2, 3 and 4 because they  are more effectively than Arm 1.  For the 
erlotinib-resistant pa tients, although patients are still assigne d about 1:1:[ADDRESS_169521] higher probabilities of being includ ed in AR model. Theref ore, the allocation of 
patient subgroups defined by M2, M3, M4, and M5 will be different in the second stage. For 
example, in stage2, M3+ patients are assigned mo re frequently to Arm 2, M4+ are assigned more 
frequently to Arm 3, and M5+ are a ssigned more frequently to Arm 4.  
These results indicate that the AR in both Stage 1 and Stage 2 has achieved its goal of 
treating more subjects with more effective treat ments given the patients’ marker profiles. With 
model refinement in Stage 2, type  I error rate is further reduced  and patients are treated even 
more effectively [ADDRESS_169522] 80% statistical

Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.1 
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by [CONTACT_39699] (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [ Eur J Ca 45:228-247, 2009].  
Changes in the largest diameter (unidime nsional measurement) of the tumor lesi ons and the shortest diameter in the 
case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
We will also report response as a continuous va riable, as % change in tumor size from baseline. 
 
Definitions 
 
Evaluable for toxicity.  All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment. 
 
Evaluable for objective response.  Only those patients who have measurable disease present at baseline, have 
received at least one cycle of therapy,  and have had their disease re-evaluat ed will be considered evaluable for 
response.  These patients will have their response classified  according to the definitions stated below.  (Note:  
Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.) 
 Evaluable Non-Target Disease Response.  Patients who have lesions present at baseline that are evaluable but do not 
meet the definitions of measurable diseas e, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re-
evaluated will be considered evaluable for non-target dise ase.  The response assessment is based on the presence, 
absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
 
Disease Parameters  
 Measurable disease.  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least one 
dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >[ADDRESS_169540] x-ray, as >[ADDRESS_169541] scan, or >[ADDRESS_169542] be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of 
centimeters). 
 
Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irra diated area will be considered measurable if they have 
increased in size since completion of radiation.   
 
Malignant lymph nodes.  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be >[ADDRESS_169543] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At 
baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. 
 
Non-measurable disease.  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non-measurable disease.  Bone lesions, 
leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast 
disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non-measurable. 
 Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiograph ically defined simple cysts should not be considered as 
malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurab le) since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts. 
 ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the 
definition of measurability described above. However, if non -cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are 
preferred for selection as target lesions. 
 
Target lesions.  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, representative 
of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at  baseline.  Target lesions 
  BATTLE-2 Protocol   
 MDACC 2009-0360 
    November 8, 2019 
 
 
126 
 should be selected on the basis of th eir size (lesions with the longest diamet er), be representative of all involved 
organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the 
case that, on occasion, the la rgest lesion does not lend its elf to reproducible measuremen t in which circumstance the 
next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for 
non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline 
sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the 
measurable dimension of the disease. 
 
Non-target lesions.  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over and above the 5 
target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at  baseline.  Measurements of 
these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be 
noted throughout follow-up.  
  
Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All baseline evaluations 
should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the 
beginning of the treatment.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique shoul d be used to characterize e ach identified and reported 
lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging-based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_147877](s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461]. 
 
Clinical lesions   Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable  when they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules 
and palpable lymph nodes) and 10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e .g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin 
lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest x-ray   Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurab le lesions when they are clearly defined and 
surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption 
that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_169544] scans ha ve slice thickness greater than  5 mm, the minimum size for a 
measurable lesion should be twice the s lice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable  in certain situations (e.g. for body 
scans).    
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent c ontrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; however, there 
are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, wh ich greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and 
measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of MRI is vari able globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the 
technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should  be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of 
disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow-up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse seque nce.  It is beyond the scop e of the RECIST guidelines 
to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for a ll scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same 
type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body 
scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible.  
PET-CT  At present, the low dose or attenuation correctio n CT portion of a combined PET-CT is not always of 
optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT 
performed as part of a PET-CT is of identical diagnostic qua lity to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then 
the CT portion of the PET-CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, howe ver, that the PET portion of the CT 
  BATTLE-[ADDRESS_169545] in selected instances. 
 
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy  The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not advised.  
However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or 
to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an 
endpoint.  Tumor markers  Tumor markers will not be used to assess response. 
 Cytology, Histology  These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial responses (PR) and complete 
responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., re sidual lesions in tumor types, such as  germ cell tumors, where known residual 
benign tumors can remain).  The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or wo rsens during treatment when 
the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable  disease is mandatory to differentiate between response 
or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease. 
 
FDG-PET  While FDG-PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes reasonable to incorporate 
the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' 
disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG-PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
a. Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of PD based on a new lesion. 
b. No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up:  If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up 
corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.  If the positiv e FDG-PET at follow-up is 
not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, additio nal follow-up CT  scans are needed to determine if 
there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal 
FDG-PET scan).  If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existin g site of disease on CT 
that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD. 
c. FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represen t fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG-PET in this 
circumstance should be prospectively described in the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_4623]-specific medical 
literature for the indication.  However, it must be ac knowledged that both approaches may lead to false 
positive CR due to limitations of FDG-PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity. 
  Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG-PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater than twice that of the 
surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image. 
 
Response Criteria 
 Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether 
target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <[ADDRESS_169546] a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of ta rget lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters 
Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in th e sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as 
reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to 
  BATTLE-2 Protocol   
 MDACC 2009-0360 
    November 8, 2019 
 
 
128 
 the relative increase of 20%, the sum mu st also demonstrate an absolute incr ease of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the 
appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). 
           Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor suffici ent increase to qualify for PD , taking as reference the 
smallest sum diameters while on study 
 
Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions  
 Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level.  All 
lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis)  Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered 
in complete clinical response. 
  
Non-CR/Non-PD:  Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level 
above the normal limits 
 
Progressive Disease (PD):  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression  of existing 
non-target lesions.  Unequivocal progression  should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be 
representative of overall disease status ch ange, not a single lesion increase.     
 
Although a clear progression of “non-target” lesions only is  exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_147782], and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or 
Principal Investigator). 
 
Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive  disease the smallest measur ements recorded since the 
treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and 
confirmation criteria.

Duration of Response 
 
Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall respon se is measured from the time measurement criteria are 
met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progre ssive disease is objectively 
documented (taking as reference for pr ogressive disease the smallest measur ements recorded since the treatment 
started). 
 The duration of overall CR is measured from the time meas urement criteria are first met for CR until the first date 
that progressive disease is objectively documented.

Duration of stable disease:  Stable disease is measur ed from the start of the treatment until the criteria for 
progression are met, taking as reference the smallest meas urements recorded since the treatment started, including

Progression-Free Survival 
 
Progression-free survival will be defined as the duratio n of time from initiation of study drug until death,

1. Tissue Collection and Processing 
During the duration of the BATTLE-2 clinical trial, core  needle biopsy (CNB) tissue and fine 
needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (FNA) specimens will be collec ted from each patient enrolled. Approximately 
four to five tissue cores approximately 1.5 cm long will be obtained and processed as follows:  
1.1. Tissue Specimens.  Two types of tumor tissue samples will be collected from the patients: 1) 
fresh tumor CNB samples; and, 2) archival di agnostic biopsy samples obtained during tumor 
diagnostic workout that may have  taken place before initiation of any systemic treatment. In 
addition to the fresh CNB, we will obtain FNA samples which will be used for assessing in the 
Interventional Radiology (IR) suite the quality of the CNB specimens.  
1.2. Tissue Collection. The fresh CNB samples will be coll ected by [CONTACT_147878], 
who will take 4 or 5 cores that should specime ns 1 mm in diameter a nd 1.2–1.8 cm long (1.5 cm 
on average). The fresh CNB tissue will be collected  from the IR suite or operating room. The 
specimens will be divided in the collection site in  2 types: 1) molecular diagnostic, at least one 
tissue core; and, 2) research the remaining tissue cores. The molecular diagnostic tissue sample will be kept always in the “chain of custody”  of the MDACC Pathology Department and the 
MMDL, while the research specimen will be handle d by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Wistuba’s lab research personnel. The 
FNA obtained at the time of the CNB collection, a nd the archival diagnostic  biopsies will be 
collected from the file of the MDACC Pathology Department or outside institutions by [INVESTIGATOR_124].

1.3. Tissue Processing and Handling.  The molecular diagnostic CNB tissues will be fixed 
immediately in the IR suite using buffered fo rmalin and transported to MDACC Pathology 
Department for histology processing. Within  72 hours of collection, FFPE H&E-stained 
histological sections will be re viewed by [CONTACT_147879] (Drs. C. Moran or N. 
Kalhor, collaborators) to assess the presence, quantity, quality, and histological types of tumor 
tissues. The pathologist will mark in the H&E-staine d slide the area of tissue containing malignant 
cells and send the molecular analysis request to the MMDL. If possible, th e research CNB tissues 
will be divided in two samples: 1) two tissue core s fixed in the IR suite using buffered formalin 
and then embedded separately in paraffin for histology sectioning and exploratory molecular 
analysis; and. 2) one or two tissue cores snap-frozen in the IR suite for research molecular analysis. In addition to the fresh CNB tissues, the archiv al diagnostic biopsy specimens will be requested 
from the MDACC Pathology or outside instituti on files for histopathologic examination and 
banking. These specimens may vary (CNB, FNA, cell block, bronchoscopy biopsy, surgical resection, etc.), and depending on their characteristic s could be assigned in th e future for additional 
biomarker analysis. They will be examined for the same histopathological features as the fresh CNB specimens and filed in [CONTACT_147895]’s lab files. 
 
2. Biomarker Analysis 2.1. Diagnostic Markers.   
Three markers will be examined using the molecular diagnostic CNB specimens: EGFR (exons 
18-21) and KRAS (codons 12, 13 and 61) mutations and EML4-ALK fusion gene. These 3 tests 
will be performed by [CONTACT_84905]-certified laboratorie s.  EGFR (exons 18-21) mutation and KRAS 
(codons 12, 13 and 61) mutation tests will be pe rformed by [CONTACT_129433]-certified laboratory at 
MDACC. ALK FISH evaluation to detect the EML4-ALK fusion gene translocation will be 
performed by [CONTACT_147880].

Only MDACC participants will have their specimen sent to Colorado University Molecular 
Correlates laboratory for the ALK FISH evaluation.  Yale participants will have specimen analyzed 
onsite for ALK FISH evaluation. 
 2.2. Exploratory Markers.   A series of exploratory molecular markers will be examined in [CONTACT_147897]’s lab. The results of these markers will no t be used to assign treatment to patients. These 
markers will include, among others, protein e xpression by [CONTACT_147881], gene expression, co py number and mutation markers by [CONTACT_147882]. The analysis of the exploratory markers will be perf ormed and reported in batches 
by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Wistuba’s lab to the clinical trial investigators.

MEDICATIONS KNOWN TO PR OLONG THE QT INTERVAL 
AND/OR INDUCE TORSADES DE POINTES (TDP) 
It has been recognized for a number of  years that certain prescription medica tions can prolong the QT/QTc interval 
and cause a form of acquired Long QT syndrome, known as drug induced LQTS. The drugs that prolong the QT 
interval and/or have a risk of inducing Torsade de Pointes (TdP) are listed below. We have divided these into two 
groups based on their known or perceived risk of causing TdP:

Appendix IX:   
Volumetric CT 
Individual patients would benefit from the development of more sensitive technologies for 
diagnosing progressive disease.  Earlier diagnoses of pr ogressive disease will  spare patients from 
the toxicities associated with futile treatments and access alternat ive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_147790].  Oncology 
drug development trials rely primarily on the post-treatment assessment of tumor size changes using uni-dimensional line-lengths measured by [CONTACT_147883].  
RECIST has inherent limitations, which arise in la rge part from the heterogeneous shapes that 
tumors assume within disease microenvironments.  While RECIST might be an effective criteria 
in the setting of perfectly sphe rical tumors that change size in a uniform fashion upon following 
treatment with cytoxic or targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], tumor morphologies that do not manifest this 
idealized shape can be challenging to evaluate for changes in size using uni-dimensional line 
lengths.  In a review, Shankar an d colleagues noted that simple anatomical outcome measures can 
(1) underestimate the benefits of targeted ther api[INVESTIGATOR_147791], (2) signal mislea ding indications of disease progression when 
tumors swell due to bleeding, edema, etc., and (3 ) fail to reflect the appe arance of new neoplastic 
tissues within complex masses [1].   
In order to more sensitively a nd specifically detect ear ly responses to drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], software 
algorithms that detect lesions in CT scans an d render volumetric and density measurements are 
now under development and clinical testing.  Fo r example, a recent study from Memorial Sloan-
Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) demonstrated that a semi-automated algorithm was able to 
accurately segment [ADDRESS_169556] scans [2].  In this 
response-to-therapy study, patients were treated with  gefitinib following a baseline CT scan.  A 
follow up CT scan at 3 weeks, when analyzed us ing a semi-automated volumetric image analysis 
algorithm, showed that 73% of pati ents had an absolute change in tumor volume of at  least 20%.  
In contrast, only 7% and 27% of  patients showed similar changes in their tumor sizes following 
gefitinib therapy using either uni-dimensional measurements or bi-dimensional measurements, 
respectively.  As a next step, th e investigators assessed whether a 30% change in tumor size could 
be detected in a subset of patients at [ADDRESS_169557] 30% was observed in 47 % of patients following 3 weeks of therapy.  On 
the other hand, no patient tumors met this thres hold using uni-dimensional measures and 13% of 
patient tumors met this threshold using bi-dimen sional measures.  This pr omising study indicates 
that CT scans, when analyzed fo r volumetric changes, can be used  to detect treatment responses 
to targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_147792], more akin to functional imagi ng than to standard uni-dimensional 
measures of disease change.  However, a weakness of this data set is that the degree to which 
these volumetric changes in tumor size at [ADDRESS_169558] be determined if 
volumetric image analysis is to be routinely utilized for patient care and for therapy response 
monitoring in drug developmen t trials.  One recent study eval uated the reproducibility of a 
commercially available (Siemens) semi-automated image analysis software program in the setting of isolated tumor nodules in lung cancer patients (218 nodules in all) [3].  Patients received two 
  BATTLE-[ADDRESS_169559] scans for the volumetric im age analysis study.  These serial scans were 
interrupted by [CONTACT_147884] 
(so-called "coffee break" experiment).  The 95% confidence interval for di fferences in measured 
volumes was -21.2%, 23.8% (with a mean difference of 1.3%).  Based on this  data, an increase of 
a nodule volume above 23.8% or a decrease in  nodule volume of more than 21.2% could be 
attributed to real changes in disease (with 95% c onfidence).  In addition, if a patient's nodule could 
be completely segmented by [CONTACT_147885], th en the interscan variability was -11.9% to 12.4%.  
On the other hand, if incompletely segmented nodul es were evaluated, the variability was more 
than twice as large (-26.8% to 30.0%).  Clearl y, the ability of a volumetric image analysis 
algorithm to segment a tumor within an image play s an important role in reproducibility of that 
tool in clinical settings. 
This study will evaluate the utility  of tumor volumes measured using volumetric image analysis 
tools and will correlate with RECIST.  This data se t will not only help inform the design of future 
clinical trials for drug development, it will also make a significant contribution to the development 
of volumetric imaging tools for day to day management of lung cancer patients receiving standard of care treatments.

Instructions on How to Prepare a Sorafenib Liquid Suspension 
Introduction 
Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_147795] 200 mg Sorafenib tosylate (Nexavar®) tablets are available for treatment of cancer. 
 Some patients are unable to swallow Sorafenib tosylate Tabl ets due to their disease and the tablet size. In these 
cases a Sorafenib tosylate suspension can be prepared and applied by [CONTACT_147886] [ADDRESS_169562] any questions about how to prepare your medication in this manner.  Remember to write down any deviations from this procedure and report to your study doctor or nurse.  
Materials 
 Two tablets:    200 mg Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006 TABL 0.2G TOS 207 COAT)

Appendix XII:    Blood-based Biomarkers 
 
 
Isolation of circulating tumor cells (CTC) and molecular analys is of these CTCs including 
mutational profiling. 
 
We will be isolating CTCs by [CONTACT_30936]-based met hod such as the current platform developed by 
[CONTACT_147888]-Up 2 Cancer grant (SU2C). This method utilizes a CTC-chip with antibody capturi ng technique (EpCam) and microfluid ics as previously described (N 
Engl J Med 2008; 359:366-377).  Other methodologi es that are not dependent on antibody are 
also being tested and will be us ed if their utility and technical performance has been established.  
The captured cells of interest can be subse quently interrogated through immunohistochemistry 
(e.g. fluorescent in situ hybridi zation or FISH) somatic muta tion profiling (e.g. Sequenome 
profiling), SNP profiling, and gene expression anal ysis with a focus on pathways relevant to 
NSCLC and drugs under investigation (e.g. EGFR, MEK, PI3K pathways). 
 Previously we have established that rare circulating cells can  be quantitated using frozen 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (Clin Canc Res 2007; 13(9): 2643-50). This 
permits batched analysis of stored samples. Therefore, we will isolate and freeze PBMCs using methods we have previously described.  From ea ch sample, blood will be subjected to gradient 
separation of mononuclear cells, placed in DMSO-containing freeze media, cooled using a 
controlled freeze protocol, and stored at - 80C until analysis as described above. 
 
Cytokines and Angiogenic Factors (CAFs) 
 
CAF profiling using serum or plasma to det ect biomarkers and signatures of response 
The availability of multiplexing technologies permits the simultaneous assessment of large 
numbers of biologically relevant proteins, such as cytokines, a ngiogenic factors, and receptors, 
and soluble markers of hypoxia a nd endothelial damage, using sma ll amounts (i.e., less than one 
milliliter) of plasma. We refer to the broad asse ssment of these multiple markers as the CAF 
(cytokine and angiogenic factor) profile.  We and other investigat ors have studied a number of 
these circulating biomarkers in peripheral blood and observed that baseline levels , or changes in 
these factors, may be markers of drug response or the emergence of therapeu tic resistance (1-5).   
 Circulating CAFs will be assessed using establis hed methods as we have previously described 
(1-5).  A CAF profile (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 60-70 analytes) of plasma biomarkers will be assessed using a 
combination of multiplex technology (e.g. Lumine x and Searchlight platforms) and enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Multiple x magnetic bead-based technology enables the 
simultaneous quantitation of up to [ADDRESS_169566] for many analytes in a single 
sample. The use of this technique has been we ll documented in the literature and results are

 comparable to that of ELISA (8-10).  Currently up to 50 human cytokines can be analyzed from 
3 separate kits (27-, 21 & 2-plex ).  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_147797] 2 to 100 L. In addition, a 12-plex multiplex panel will be used to evaluate for EGFR 
related proteins such as amphiregulin, epi[INVESTIGATOR_147798], soluble EGFR, EGF,  HB-EGF, Betacellulin 
(EMD-Millipore).   Human CVD Biomarker Panel 1 (3-plex includes MMP-9 and sE-Selectin) from Millipore.  The remainder of analytes will be determined using by [CONTACT_147889], enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assays
 (ELISA) assays such as Human Os teopontin (OPN), CA-9, Collagen IV, 
sVEGFR2, NGAL; and using the Search lite multiplex platform.  Other analytical platforms will 
be considered if they are established to ha ve advantages (e.g. lower volume requirements or 
greater sensitivity). For each plat e, the standard curves will be assessed to ensure that the 
expected assay range was achieved. For each in dividual sample, the mean concentration is 
calculated for duplicate samples, and the coeffici ent of variance % (CV%) is calculated for each 
of the analytes. If the median CV% is greater th an 25%, analysis of the sample was repeated. In 
the rare case that the repeat CV% is greater th an 25%, one of the two analyses will be selected 
based on lower CV% and consistency with prior values. In our experience, less than 10% of 
samples require repeat analysis.  
 Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Analysis.  Prior studies have establ ished that germline SNPs 
in cancer related pathways (e.g. VEGF, VEGFR2) ma y be markers for therap eutic response (6).  
To identify new markers of response we will inves tigate germline SNPs that  met at least two of 
three criteria: (a) minor allele fr equency of at least 5%; (b) location in the promoter, untranslated 
region (UTR), or coding region of the gene; and (c) previous report of an  association with an 
inflammatory disorder, angiogenesis, lung cancer, or another cancer.  Coding SNPs are described according to the amino acid change, whereas ot her SNPs are described according to the 
nucleotide change or location in the UTR. Th e method below has been applied successfully; 
other multiplexed technologies are also being tested and could but substituted if performance is superior. The SNPs will be genotyped using SNPlex, a technology developed by [CONTACT_147890][INVESTIGATOR_147799] 48 SNPs in a single tube using an 
oligonucleotide ligation assay. The assay prin ciple and procedures are detailed in the 
manufacturer’s user guide (P N4360858). Briefly, a list of candi date SNPs are submitted to 
Applied Biosystems, which evaluated the SNPs fo r suitability for the assay and designed a pool 
of SNP specific ligation probes.  Genomic DNA is  then fragmented at 99C for 10 min, and 37 ng 
of fragmented DNA was dried down on each well of  a 384-well plate. The SNP-specific ligation 
probes and a universal linker are phosphorylated and ligated together, and the mixture was then 
treated with exonuclease. Following purification,  the probe mixture is added to the genomic 
DNA, and amplified by [CONTACT_147891]. The biotinylated amplicons are denatured and captured on streptavidin-coated plates. To decode the genotype information, single-stranded PCR products were hybridized with a univers al set of fluorescent 
dye-labeled, mobility-modified fragments (Zipchut es, Applied Biosystems), which were then 
eluted and separated with the Applied Biosys tems 3730 Capi[INVESTIGATOR_147800].  As methods 
for assessing SNPs are rapi[INVESTIGATOR_147801] w ill evaluate and potentially incorporate other 
available methods for SNP assessment at the ti me of analysis. Genotype s are called by [CONTACT_147892], using an analysis  template file provid ed with each custom 
SNPlex assay.

6) Place labeled-vials into freezer and note exact location in THNMORDB  
7) All samples information will be logged into Tissue Station.   
Peripheral Blood Monomuclear Cells (P BMC) Collection and Processing  
1) Using two (2) BD Vacutainer sodium citrate "CPT" blood collection tube,  
a) The Vacutainer™ CPT™ Tube with Sodium Citrate should be at room temperature  
(18-25° C) and properly labeled for patient identification.  
2) Collect blood into the Tube using the standard technique for Vacutainer™ Brand  
Blood Collection Tubes  
3) After collection, store Tube upright at room temperature until centrifugation. Blood samples 
should be centrifuged within two hours of blood collection for best results.  
4) Centrifuge Tube/blood sample at room temperature (18-25° C) in a horizontal rotor  
(swing-out head) for a minimum of 20 minutes at 1500 to 1800 RCF (Relative Centrifugal Force).  
5) From upper layer, place 500 microliters of plasma aliquots and screw-cap the vial  
6) PBMC band, collect cells into cryovial and screw cap the vial (approximately 500 uL)  7) Add equal volume (approximately 500 uL) of freezing media (RPMI-1640+20% DMSO) to 
sample vial  
8) Appropriately label each vial (no patient identifier no specific information will be used)  
9) Place labeled-vials into freezer (-80*C) (into specific protocol sample BOX) and note exact 
location of sample in THNMORDB  
10) All sample information will be logged into Tissue Station.

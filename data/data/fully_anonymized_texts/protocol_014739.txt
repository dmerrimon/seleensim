The NHLBI strategic plan has highlighted a need to  identify strategies to halt the atrial 
fibrillation (AF) epi[INVESTIGATOR_521544]. The 
growing rate of AF, with projections of aff licting up to 16 million individuals by [CONTACT_2892] 
2050, is not fully explained by [CONTACT_453754], underscoring the need to identify 
novel triggers. Sleep-disordered breathi ng (SDB) is common in patients with 
cardiovascular disease and its attendant hypoxemia and autonomic dysfunction create 
a milieu that is likely to enhance AF propens ity.  Thus, SDB may represent a novel 
target for AF prevention and treatment stra tegies. Although our prior cross-sectional 
work has shown a 2-[ADDRESS_676503] not included  cardiac structural data or autonom ic/biochemical measures, and have 
addressed only arrhythmic events occurring during an overnight sleep study. In this proposal, we will examine paroxysmal AF (PAF),  an early stage risk factor for persistent 
AF, and relevant to this proposal because it o ccurs prior to extensive cardiac electrical 
remodeling/fibrosis. PAF provides an ideal  setting to investigate the immediate 
influences of SDB and examine temporal patte rns given its intermittent nature. We will 
perform a case control study with each group matched on important confounders such as age (±5 years), gender, race (white versus non-white), and obesity (+/-2 kg/m
2) and 
characterized using detailed collection of overnight sleep study data, echocardiographic 
measures, biomarkers and 7-21 day conti nuous ECG monitoring. Cases (PAF, n=150) 
will be recruited from our local AF clini cs, and controls (n=150) from medicine and 
cardiology clinics. The following existing gaps  will be addressed: clarif y the extent that 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_521545], apnea subtype (obstructive versus central), and hypoxia are associated with PAF independent of cardia c structural abnormalities (i.e. systolic 
dysfunction and left atrial enlargement); explore the extent to which cardiac morphology, 
pathways of inflammation/oxidative stre ss and autonomic dysfunction mediate the SDB-
PAF relationship and identify whether temporal patterns of AF paroxysms differ in patients with SDB. Data generated from this research is key for developi[INVESTIGATOR_521546]-related morbidity including stroke, heart failure and also death. Expected results will be of high impact given ability to identif y and inform future screening and treatment 
approaches for management and/or prevention of AF and identify key outcomes for 
clinical trials.  The primary aims of the study are to:  SA 1. Quantify the extent t hat SDB and its subtypes are associated with PAF. SDB will 
be assessed by [CONTACT_521589]: the Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) and also Central 
Apnea Index, Periodic Breathing, Obstru ctive Apnea Hypopnea Index and % sleep time 
<90%SaO2. For each, exposure response relationships and thresholds that confer increased risk for PAF will be defined.

The Elucidation of the Influence of Sl eep Apnea on Risk of Atrial Fibrillation  study 
Is employs a case control study design to in vestigate the extent to which there is an 
independent relationship of SDB and PAF. Cases will be defined as clinically  identified patients 
with PAF and controls as those without AF. In order to rigorously addre ss important biologic 
confounding influences, the cases and contro ls will be individually matched based upon age 
(±5 years), gender, race (white versus non-white), and obesity (+/-2 kg/m2). Those 
participants with both PAF and SDB (Apnea Hypopnea Index, AHI>15) will be asked to return 
for a follow up exam after 3 months of SDB tr eatment in the Case D ahms Clinical Research 
Unit (DCRU) and the Cleveland Clinic CRU for colle ction of the same m easures collected at 
the baseline exam to observe for any signific ant changes with the purpose of collecting effect 
size data to inform future clinical trials.  
 In addition, ten participants with SDB who are CPAP treatment naive with paroxysmal AF and 10 control participants will be recruited for a sub- study. The 10 participants of 
the CPAP treatment group undergo MRI scanni ng before and after 12 weeks of CPAP 
treatment in a 7T imaging protocol designed to study resting state networks at high 
spatial resolution. Cognitive testing and questionnaires will be performed before and after treatment. The strength of connecti vity between elements of the DMN will be 
compared before and after treatment. Controls  will only be given the cognitive battery 
and not undergo the MRI brain scan.  The total duration of the study is 4 years.  The duration for any individual participant is 
up to from one to 13 weeks months, including a 3-month treatment period for those with 
moderate to severe SDB, i.e. AHI>15.

3. A. 1.  Atrial Fibrillation: Burgeoning Epi[INVESTIGATOR_521547]. AF is the most common sustained arrhythmia 3, affecting ~2.2 
million individuals in the US 4, and potentially up to 16 million Americans by [CONTACT_2892] 
2050 5. AF is an independent predictor of mortality 6 and increased stroke, implicated in 
~75,[ADDRESS_676505] been estimated at $6.7 
billion, including $2.9 billion for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] 8. Therefore, improved AF disease 
management strategies are needed to reduce hospi[INVESTIGATOR_521548] 9. Furthermore, 
AF treatments such as ablation and anti-a rrhythmic medications are fraught with 
inconsistent results and pro-arrhythmic side effects 10. There is a critical need to identify 
alternative AF treatment and prevention strategies such as those targeting SDB.   
 
3. A. 2. Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrilla tion: An Ideal Condition to Examine 
Electrophysiologic Triggers and Diurnal Patterns. PAF is often asymptomatic and 
occurs early in the continuum  of persistent AF development 11. Half of those with PAF 
have no obvious cause 12 which may be due to unrecognized triggers such as SDB.  
The longer PAF persists, the more difficult it  is to restore sinus rhythm and prevent 
recurrence which emphasizes the need to expeditiously identify and address potential 
contributing factors such as SDB at this stage of disease 13. Patients initially presenting 
with PAF often progress to longer, non–self-terminating bouts 13. Importantly, PAF often 
begins before electrical and extensive structural cardiac remodeling has occurred and 
provides an ideal substrate for examining ac ute physiologic triggers such as those that 
occur in SDB. In individuals with sympt omatic PAF, there is a 12:1 ratio of 
asymptomatic versus symptomatic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] 14, therefore continuous ECG monitoring is 
helpful to provide more detailed, objec tive data on paroxysms as described in the 
current proposal. Furthermore, unlike continuous AF, which does not allow reliable detection of autonomic dysregulation via heart rate variability (HRV) indices from ECG 
data; in PAF, HRV analyses for autonomic function assessment can be derived from the normal sinus rhythm (NSR) period data.  
3. A. 3.  Atrial Fibrillation: Unexplained Risk.  Given the excess burden of AF and also 
high prevalence of SDB (~10-15%) 
15, there is a need to better understand AF risk as it 
pertains to SDB. Hypertension is a risk factor for AF possibly via mechanisms of atrial 
fibrosis [ADDRESS_676506] not been completely realized, and investigation of other biologically

EFFECTSFigure 1. plausible risks is critical.  The incomplete explanation of AF etiology is “disquieting 
because, in the absence of identifiable pr edisposing factors, targeting preventive 
therapy is difficult” 13. SDB can be such a factor, and be recognized and managed in 
clinical practice and in AF pathways for prevention.  
3. A. 4.  Sleep Disordered Breathing 
Potentially Accounts for Unexplained Atrial Fibrillation Risk: Pathophysiology (Figure 1). SDB is a 
highly prevalent and disabling disorder, 
afflicting ~15% 
23 of adults and as many 
as 30-50% [ADDRESS_676507] pathways alters the functional and cardiac 
structural substrate for AF arrhythmogenesis. 
 
1) Direct SDB Effects Potent ially Contributing to PAF. (gray boxes and solid arrows 
in Figure 1) a. Intermittent Hypoxia/Reoxygenation. Apneas and hypopneas in SDB are 
associated with oxygen desaturation and vent ilatory overshoot hyperoxia. AF is 
associated with activation of hypoxic factors including hypoxia inducible factor-1 α (HIF-
1α) 
25, 26, a transcription factor which is also up-regulated in SDB 27. The role of hypoxia 
in AF is further exemplified by [CONTACT_521590]-operative AF with the use of 
supplemental oxygen in those with hypoxia 28. Retrospective clinical data also implicate 
nocturnal hypoxia as a risk of incident AF 29. 
b. Intrathoracic Pressure Alterations.  Obstructive apneas and hypopneas cause 
repetitive forced inspi[INVESTIGATOR_244579] a closed airway, which generates substantial 
negative pressures in the chest cavity (approaching  -65mmHg) 
30. These cyclical increased intrathoracic pressures in SDB result in acute 
left atrial and pulmonary vein stretch 30-[ADDRESS_676508]-apnea and 
hypopnea related hypercarbia or hypoxia-induced sympathoexcitation 36, 37. Vagally 
mediated influences favor atrial macroreentry and reduce the effective refractory period, 
whereas sympathetic influences favor abnormal automaticity and triggered atrial activity

V11 03/01/2016                           Page 8 38. Compelling animal data support attenuati on of apnea-mediated AF after autonomic 
blockade (via ganglionated plexi neural ablation)  highlighting the importance of the role 
of the autonomic system in SDB and AF 39. HRV analyses have shown increased 
Standard Deviation of NN intervals (SDNN) , increased high frequency (HF) and reduced 
low frequency (LF) preceding PAF epi[INVESTIGATOR_521549] 40. These data support the value of performing HRV in the proposed 
research to investigate SDB-relat ed autonomic instability triggers in PAF. 
d. Sleep Fragmentation.  SDB-related EEG arousals assessed by [CONTACT_521591] (PSG) lead to sleep fragmentation and are associated 
with sympathetic activation 41.  
 
2) Indirect SDB Effects Pote ntially Contributing to PAF. (dashed outlined boxes and 
arrows in Figure 1) 
a. Cardiac Structural Alterations. SDB leads to increased wall stress, increased 
afterload, increased atrial size 32, 33 and impaired diastolic function 32, 42. Our published 
data demonstrate increased left ventricular mass index in SDB compared to those 
without SDB, mechanistically explained by [CONTACT_521592] 43. Known 
risks for AF include increased left atrial volu me and strain, left ventricular hypertrophy 
and left atrial wall motion velocity 44, all which should be measured in any research on 
AF in SDB.  
b. Systemic Inflammation. SDB markers include increased interleukin-6 (IL-6) 45, 
soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R)46 and high sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP)  47. 
Importantly, increased hs-CRP levels are imp licated in atrial structural and electrical 
remodeling 48, [ADDRESS_676509] been associated with AF 50.  
c. Oxidative Stress SDB-related intermittent hypoxia-r eoxygenation results in oxidative 
stress 51-54 which may alter myocyte ion channel function. Animal data show increased 
oxidized glutathione 55 and NADPH oxidase levels in the left atrial appendage 56 in 
persistent AF. Initiation and perpetuation of AF involves inflammation and oxidative 
stress, e.g. endothelin-1  has been increasingly implicated as a pathogenic factor in AF 
resulting in upregulation of oxidative stress pathways 57-59. There are methods to 
quantify F2-isoprostanes , a recognized marker in SDB 60-62 which are prostaglandin-like 
compounds derived from free radical-catalyz ed peroxidation of arachidonic acid. This 
has allowed facile and accurate asse ssment of oxidative stress in vivo 63 and will be 
measured in the current proposal.  
 3. A. 5.  Sleep Disordered Breathing Potentially  Accounts for Unexplained Atrial 
Fibrillation Risk: Clinical and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_521550]. The existing clinical and 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_521551] a lack of objective assessments of 
cardiac and autonomic function 
2, 64-67, lack of consideration of central apnea 64, 67, 
inconsistent arrhythmia adjudication (Sleep Hear t Health Study), insufficient sample size 
66, retrospective data in a skewed population 29 and the SDB data in AF studies depend 
largely on subjective measures (lack of objective sleep study data) 64, 68. 
1) Clinical Data. The published  relationships between SDB and AF, while in general 
compelling, have flaws. One well refer enced study found a significantly higher 
prevalence of SDB (by [CONTACT_63496]) in AF pat ients, many with established structural 
Elucidation of the Influence of Sleep Apnea on Risk of Atrial Fibrillation   PI- Mehra, Reena 
and Strohl,Kingman  
 
 
V11 03/01/[ADDRESS_676510], another study found a 
similar prevalence of SDB in AF patients and controls 66; close reading suggests that 
this study was likely under-powered with a c ontrol sample potentially biased towards 
having SDB 66. A small case control study matched for age and sex and excluding those 
with LVEF<50% demonstrated a 3-fold increased adjusted odds of AF in those with 
moderate to severe SDB, but was limited by [CONTACT_521593] 
67. Although data support that effectively treated 
SDB in compliant patients reduces AF recu rrence after cardioversion, the comparison 
group were those non-compliant with SDB tr eatment, a group perhaps more likely to 
engage in other unhealthy behaviors increasing AF recurrence 69. There are also 
conflicting data as to whether SDB predict s procedural failure after AF ablation 68, 70.  
2) Epi[INVESTIGATOR_521550].  We have performed epi[INVESTIGATOR_521552] (odds ratio point estimates of 2-4) even after taking into acc ount a host of potential confounding factors such 
as age, sex, race, body mass index, and self-reported co-morbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease and heart failure 
1, 2. A major limitation of these 
large-scale studies is dependence on self-r eported diagnoses and a lack of objective 
cardiac function data to account for the confounding influence of structural cardiac disease. Even when examining the association of Cent ral Sleep Apnea-Cheyne Stokes Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1520] 
(CSA-CSR) with AF, the directionality is unclear, as CSR-CSA could either predispose to AF development or merely represent a marker  of cardiac dysfunction leading to AF. Other 
limitations include lack of meas urement or consideration of markers of autonomic function, 
systemic inflammation, oxidative stress and consideration of only nocturnal ECG data from the sleep study to ascertain AF.        
 
   
The goal of the current application is to address t he shortcomings of existing data by [CONTACT_521594], autonomic function and biomar kers of inflammation oxidative 
stress and careful consideration of these influences in the SDB-PAF relationship. Relationships of 
obstructive and central apnea with PAF will be explored. We will also investigate interactions of PAF 
and age in SDB given our prior work showing increased odds of arrhythmia with younger age 1.  
Moreover, diurnal variation of PAF with SDB will also be examined given the immediate and chronic 
SDB-related physiologic stresses (i .e. intermittent hypoxia, intrathor acic pressure alterations and 
autonomic influences). Furthermore, effects of SDB treatment on PAF will also be examined to 
provide data for future studies.

5.  SAMPLE SELECTION 
 
Cases.  Patients with PAF who present to Electrophysiology (EP) Clin ic at UHCMC and the 
Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF) will be approac hed for recruitment in the study.  
 
Inclusion Criteria for Cases:   1) PAF defined by [CONTACT_128979][INVESTIGATOR_298261], which self-terminate 
within a 7-day period (based upon AHA consensus statement 77), 2) Age 18-80 years, 3) 
Individuals able to participate in > 2 overnight/daytime sl eep and physiologic assessments 
over a 3 month period.  Exclusion Criteria for Cases:  1) PAF with rapid or uncontrolled rate (>120bpm), 2) Post-
operative PAF, 3) History of cardiac  ablation or successful electro-cardioversion for PAF (ablation for other arrhythmias such as AVNRT  and if  PAF persists after cardioversion is 
acceptable ), 4) Valvular stenosis , prosthesis or significant valvular insufficiency [i.e. those 
with moderate or greater se verity of aortic stenosis (aortic valve area <1.5 cm
2), mitral 
regurgitation which is moderate or more seve re in degree (>20% regurgitant fraction) or 
moderate or greater severity mitral  stenosis (mitral valve area <1.5 cm2)], 5) Atrial septal 
defect, 6) Infiltrative/restrictive cardiomyopat hy, 7) Sick sinus syndrome, 8) Previously 
diagnosed  SDB on specific SDB treatments (CPAP,  oral appliances), 9) Severe chronic 
insomnia, 10) Circadian rhythm disorder (e.g . shift work sleep disorder, delayed or advanced 
sleep phase syndrome), 11) Insufficient sleep sy ndrome defined by [CONTACT_521596] < 
4 hrs, 12) Supplemental oxygen use, 13) Unstable medical c onditions (e.g., new onset or 
changing angina, a myocardial infarction or  congestive heart failure exacerbation 
documented within the previous 3 months, systolic heart failure  (Left Ventricular Ejection 
Fraction < 35%), high grade cardiac dysrhyth mia/heart block, stroke with functional 
limitations, uncontrolled hyper tension (BP>170/110), abdominal aneurysm >5.5 cm or >1 
cm growth/year, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus  (HbA1c>9.0), pulmonary hypertension, non-
skin cancer diagnosis or treatment within t he previous year, end stage renal and hepatic 
failure, immunodeficiencies (HIV, HCV), uncont rolled hypo- or hyperthyroidism), 14) 
Psychiatric disorders which are inadequately treated, 15) Compromised competence, 16) 
Alcohol abuse (currently drinks  >5 alcoholic  drinks/day), 17) Pregnan cy, 18) Inability to 
provide informed consent, 19) Illicit drug use ov er last 6 months, 20) Rate controlling anti-
arrhythmic medication (Classes I-III and V) with no further clinical occurrence of PAF,  21) 
has an Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. Rationale for criteria:  The goal of this study is 
to include those patients with PAF that is not secondary to the post-operative period or 
valvular disease and without ablati on as these processes would result in alteration of atrial 
physiology and preclude assessment of i ndependent SDB effects on AF which is 
independent of these conditions. Patients with sleep disorders will be excluded as sleep 
disorders may influence arrhythmogenesis. T hose on treatment for SDB will be excluded 
because treatment would preclude assessment of  SDB pathophysiologic effects on atrial

rate will be excluded due to safety reasons. 
 
Note: Exclusion criteria for positive airway pre ssure (PAP) intervention: Central Apnea Index>5 
noted on baseline examination sleep study  or evidence of Cheyne Stokes 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1520]/periodic breathing (cyclical crescendo and decrescendo change in breathing 
amplitude). 
 
We plan to recruit [ADDRESS_676513] of CPAP on the 
default mode network, which is a well-established re sting state network in  the brain that is 
involved in semantic processing and associ ated with compromise in cognitive task 
performance. 
 Note: Exclusion criteria for t he 7T MRI would include ferrous objects in the body (cochlear 
(ear) implant, brain aneurysm c lip, stimulator device, and cardiac pacemaker), severe 
kidney disease, and history of claustrophobia. 
 
Controls. Patients without AF will be recruited from  the UHCMC and CCF General Cardiology 
and Internal Medicine clinics (geographically similar to controls). Selection bias will be 
minimized as there are a broad range of reasons for patients to present to these clinics. 
 Inclusion Criteria for Controls:  1) Age 18 to 80 years, 2) I ndividuals in normal sinus rhythm 
(NSR) with no current AF or history of AF  3) Individuals able to participate in an 
overnight/daytime sleep and physiologic assessment.  Exclusion Criteria for Controls:  Current or history of AF, otherwise the same exclusion 
criteria listed for cases. 
 
We plan to recruit [ADDRESS_676514] the cognitive battery 
and questionnaires only. They will not undergo the 7T MRI. 
 
 MATCHING. Cases and controls will be individually matched to enhance study efficiency and 
precision with more stable odds ratio estimate s and narrower confidence intervals. Matching 
will be based upon factors which are biologi cally strong confounders as follows: 1) age (±5 
years), 2) gender, 3) race (white versus  non-white) and 4) obes ity (BMI +/-2 kg/m

recruitment in the study. [CONTACT_521656], Director of CCF EP Program and [CONTACT_521651] (Co-I), Director of the UHCMC EP Center and [ADDRESS_676516]. Al Waldo (Director of Electrophysiology Research, Co-I) comprise the EP clinical team along with the EP fellowship program/clinic. Approximately 1,680 new patients/year 
(140/month) with AF are seen in the EP clinics. Of these, ~672 pat ients/year (~60/ month) have 
PAF. Assuming 50% meet eligibility criteria and 50% of those are interested then ~n=168 
patients will be recruited/year (n =14/month). This translates into n=672 potential participants 
over the 4 year recruitment period which far exceeds the n=[ADDRESS_676517] agreed to participate in the study, t heir health information will be destroyed.

Family Medicine, and Internal  Medicines outpatient schedule.  
 
A written waiver of consent will be requested (according to 45 CFR46.117) to collect and review health information about prospective subjects prior to 
obtaining written informed consent.  The research involves no more than minimal 
risk.  The waiver will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects and 
the research could not be conducted without the waiver because the health 
information collected is necessary to ascertain which subjects are eligible to participate in the study. 
 
This is a request for partial waiver of  HIPAA authorization” to collect health 
information” from screening questionnaires or from the medical records of 
participating electrophysiology clinics. The screening questionnaires will ask health questions to screen for sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_47677], and personal health information to determine which patients would qualify for st udy participation. The medical record 
screening form identifies eligibility criteria . Once a person has been identified as 
eligible to participate in the study, they  will be scheduled for an in-person study visit 
at which time, written informed consent and HIPAA authorization will be obtained.  (If 
the patient is available at the time of the screening, as may occur if the screening 
questionnaire is directly administered, the full screening visit may be conducted at that time in an area sufficiently private to provide for confidentiality.  To maintain 
general descriptive information about the target sample, the screening questionnaires will be entered into a secure research database that does not include any personal identification.  All hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_521557]. All personal health informati on collected and retained on site prior to 
obtaining written authorizati on will be de-linked from identifying personal information. 
 Also, if written authorization is not obtained within [ADDRESS_676519] System Utilization 
     Eligibility will be assessed by a study recrui ters (Kathryn Clark (UH) and Rawan 
Nawabit (CCF)) and the study coordinator (Joan Aylor (CCF)) using the UH and CCF Physician Portal. This will be done by [CONTACT_521597]’s electronic chart only once in order to review  the most recent note from the patient’s 
cardiologist. Information viewed will be used by t he study recruiter to check yes or no on 
the study inclusion and exclusion criteria form with no recording of specific results being made. These forms are de-identified with only t he study id listed. No printouts from the 
Portal will be made. Review of the chart should take no more than [ADDRESS_676520] copi[INVESTIGATOR_521558]- Mehra, Reena 
and Strohl,Kingman  
 
 
V11 03/01/[ADDRESS_676521] agreed to participate in the study, their health information will be destroyed. 
The reason for requesting access to physician notes on the Portal rather than 
reviewing paper charts is that paper charts ar e not stored at each clinic but are instead 
stored at an off site locality where they ar e not accessible for review until 24 hours prior 
to the patient appointment. Because the recrui ter is expected to be at a clinic each day, 
he cannot physically review paper charts until the day of clinic but this is disruptive to 
patient care. By [CONTACT_521598], the recruiter can screen for eligible patients without interfering with clinical care. 
If questions arise relevant to eligibility (e.g ., degree of renal insufficiency, time since 
free of cancer) that cannot be readily answe red by [CONTACT_158592], one of the study 
physicians (at UHCMC, Drs. Kingman Str ohl, Kristie Ross, Anna May and Rawad 
ElGhoul and at the Cleveland Clinic, Drs. Reena Mehra and Harneet Walia) who already has Portal access will use the Physician Portal to access the relevant clinical notes or 
laboratory information to make a judgment on study eligibility. It should be noted that 
this study physician may not be a direct caregiver of the patient. The recruiter will get approval from the patient’s physician prior to accessing the patient’s record for screening.
 Access to electronic records will be made at most once per patient by a 
study physician to determine eligibility and only in those cases where staff has been unable to make a clear determination through re view records in the clinic and interview 
with the patient. We anticipate this will be required in less than 5% of screenings. 
Information viewed will be used by [CONTACT_521599]. These 
forms are de-identified with only study id lis ted. No printouts fr om the Portal will be 
made.     Similarly, in dealing with potential safe ty concerns, one of the study physicians at 
UHCMC, Drs. Strohl, Ross, May, and ElGhoul  and at the Cleveland Clinic, Drs. Mehra 
and Walia) may access the Physician Portal to st ratify adverse events. For example, if 
overnight cardiac monitoring reveals bouts of at rial fibrillation, identif ying that the patient 
has a history of atrial fibrillation will make th is finding a low level adverse event requiring 
only a letter to the patient’s study physician. However, if review of the Physician Portal demonstrates the patient has no pr ior history of atrial fibrillation, this would result in a 
higher level adverse event where the pati ent’s physician would be contact[CONTACT_11252] [ADDRESS_676522] once per adverse event and only if it was unclear if the finding were new (e.g., there would be no need if the pati ent reported he had a history of atrial fibrillation). This 
information will be recorded only in terms of grading adverse events, all of which again 
are on de-identified forms labeled only with a study id and no printouts of Portal 
information will be made. Using the Portal is nec essary to obtain information relevant to 
patient safety in a timely manner as reques ting paper patient outpatient charts can take 
up to a week.

Baseline Visit (SA 1 and 2, Table 1). After informed consent, eligible participants will be 
scheduled to arrive for an overnight visit in the DCRU/CRU within a standardized time 
interval (< 2 weeks) from informed cons ent. During the evening, participants will undergo 
questionnaire administration, blood pressure measurements, application of the MultiSense™ monitoring device, and anthropom etry. They will be provided dinner and 
undergo polysomnography (PSG). In the mo rning, participants will undergo fasting 
venipuncture, overnight urine collection, ECHO, [ADDRESS_676523] and blood pressure measurements. For those with PAF (cases), hook-up for continuous  ECG monitoring will be 
performed along with education regarding how to handle the device and bathing 
instructions, etc. All measurements in  the DCRU/CRU will be performed blinded to PAF 
status. The only unblinded staff will be a dedicat ed research assistant who will perform the 
ECG monitoring hook-up. Blinded staff will colle ct and process data and perform data entry. 
After the baseline visit, participants with PAF  (n=150) will undergo hook-up of the ECG 
monitor and an activity monitor at the baseline visit to wear for a 7-21 day period. The 
monitors will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_140467] a courier service. If eligible for the 7T MRI sub-study (cases - AHI≥15 and agree to CPAP treat ment, controls AHI ≥15), they will be consented and all 
questions answered.  The individuals who serv e as controls who are identified to have 
sleep apnea (AHI>5) or for those with PAF who have an AHI ranging from 5-15 on the 
baseline sleep study in the Clinical Research Unit will be notified of these results and the 
physician will be contact[CONTACT_521600].

his/her physician. The participant’s physi cian will be contact[CONTACT_521602]. 
4. At the end of the 5-7 day  titration, the data on pre ssure responses and PAP use 
(with no patient identifying in formation) are transmitted using a wireless feature from 
the patient’s home to a secure web-site wh ich is accessible by [CONTACT_16133]. If 
wireless coverage is unavailable, data may be transmitted using a standard phone 
line or directly retrieving a data card from  the machine. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_521561]. If the initial APAP study is una cceptable, a repeat 
5-7 day recording will be performed. The goal  will be to identify the pressure that 
results in an AHI<5 events/ hour (optimally), however, <10 events/hour would be 
deemed acceptable. For those participants that  have mask leak or interface issues, 
they will undergo troubleshooting by [CONTACT_521603]-person as 
needed. If despi[INVESTIGATOR_521562] , the AHI remains >10, then the 
participant will be withdrawn fr om the study and will be encouraged to follow-up with 
his/her physician. The participant’s physi cian will be contact[CONTACT_521602]. If the par ticipant qualifies for  CPAP,, then the 
subject will approached to assess interest in the MRI sub-study.  
5. The research assistant will re-set the device to deliver this optimal fixed pressure 
identified by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_521563]-site. The web-site will allow the 
research assistant to measure adherence daily and review with the participant at the scheduled follow up calls to maximize PAP use. Each APAP also contains a “smartcard” which will provide objective adher ence data if wireless is not available. 
The participant contact [CONTACT_504800]-up will be as follows: the participant will be 
called every [ADDRESS_676526] non-adherence due to mask fit/leak noted 
on more than 2 consecutive nights. 
6. An overnight DCRUCRU visit will be schedul ed after 3 months of wearing CPAP 
(*this duration chosen based upon data suppor ting immediate influences of apnea 
on PAF71 and CPAP effects on cardiac function in 1 month 78) during which the 
same measures performed at  the baseline visit will be collected. If the participant 
had a 7T MRI at their baseline visit, a follow-up MRI will be scheduled. 
As SDB prevalence of ~50% has been noted in those with AF 64, we estimate that ~75 
participants will meet criteria to proceed to CPAP. If this goal is not met, then we will 
supplement recruitment from t he sleep disorders program (~12 00 studies/year) to identify 
those with SDB who have PAF to achieve this goal.

Relevant ECHO Variables:  
1) Left and Right Atrial Parame ters: Left atrial volume by [CONTACT_521607]-length 
method 79, right atrial area (from the 4-chamber view ), left atrial pressure estimated from 
the ratio of early diastolic transmitral flow  velocity to early annular tissue velocity 81 and 
right atrial pressure based on t he diameter of the inferior vena cava and its response to a 
“sniff”  will be assessed 82. Peak left atrial systolic strain, a measure of LA remodeling which 
is inversely related to fibrosis in PAF 83, will also be measured. 
2) Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) Parameters:  LAA wall motion velocity, a measure 
associated with AF will be assessed 84. A value of >40 cm/s, has been noted to be an 
independent predictor of NSR maintenance in AF44. LAA tissue velocity, a more readily 
obtained and sensitive LAA dysfuncti on measure will also be measured 84.  
3) Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF, %) : This will be derived from  left ventricular end-
diastolic volume (LVEDV) and end-systolic  volume (LVESV): [(LVEDV-LVESV)/LVEDV x 
100] 85.  
4) Left  ventricular mass index (LVMI): This will be calculated by a validated formula 86 : 
LVMI = {0.8 x [1.04 x (LVIDd + IVST X LVPWT)3 – (LVIDd)3] + 0.6}/height 2.7, where LVIDd 
is LV internal diastolic diameter, IVST is in terventricular septal thi ckness and LVPWT is LV 
posterior wall thickness, m easured in centimeters.  
5) Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH): Using pr eviously published thresholds, we will define 
LVH as an LVMI of 49.2 g/m2.7 for men and 46.7 g/m2.7 for women 87. Subjects with LVH will 
be classified as having concentric hypertrophy  if relative wall thickness [(LVPWT x 
IVST)/LVIDd)] is >0.41 or e ccentric hypertrophy if <0.41 88. 
 
2) POLYSOMNOGRAPHY (PSG). Procedure for PSG: Research PSG will be performed 
using the Compumedics E-series system (Abbo ttsford, AU) which will include 3 cortical 
encephalograms, bilateral electro-oculograms,  a bipolar submental electromyogram, 
thoracic and abdominal respi[INVESTIGATOR_521566], airflow (by [CONTACT_373239]-oral 
thermocouple and nasal cannula pressure reco rding), oximetry (using highly sensitive 
finger pulse oximeter, sampling frequency 25Hz), electrocardiogram (E CG) at 250Hz (used 
to derive HRV measures of autonomic function); body position (mercury switch sensor), 
bilateral leg movements. EEGs are recorded at 125Hz. Sensors will be calibrated, and 
signal quality/impedance checked by a certified technician, using standardized techniques. 
PSG scoring criteria are docum ented in the Case Sleep Research Manual of Procedures 
(Appendix B ). Relevant PSG Variables: Apneas will be classified as “central” or 
“obstructive” according to the absence or pr esence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_521567]. 
Hypopneas will be scored as a 50% amplitude reducti on in inductance or flow and associated 
3% oxygen desaturation or arousal. Periodic breathing will be defined as airflow or 
inductance channels increasing and decreasing at least 50% from the maximum, in a cyclic 
waxing and waning or "sinusoidal" manner for a consecutive period of >10 min.  
Procedure for PSG ECG Signal Extraction: ECG monitoring data from the PSG 
Baseline and Follow Up Exams will be processed and analyzed by [CONTACT_521608] (Director: K Loparo, Nord Professor of Engineering). Data will be 
exported as European Data Format (EDF) ECG files into customized Matlab programs that

have artifact rejection capability. We sele cted ECG measures as informed by [CONTACT_521609], AF pathophysiology and reliable ex traction; however, other markers will be 
analyzed for which we have developed algorithms (i.e. non-linear indices such as 
conditional entropy). Relevant PSG ECG Variables: *ECG measures will be based upon 
NSR periods identified by [CONTACT_521610]-reading of random 
segments. HRV, considered to measure sympathovagal  modulation of heart rate, will be 
quantified using standard time domain methods  [time intervals between normal beats 
(SDNN ), the root mean square differenc es between adjacent normal beats ( r-MSSD), 
the % of pairs of adjacent beats differing by >50 ms ( pNN50 )], and with frequency 
spectral based measures which mathematic ally deconstruct heart beat patterns into 
underlying rhythmic components using Fast Fourier transforms: low (0.04-0.15 Hz) and 
high (0.15-0.4 Hz) frequency bands ratio ( LF/HF ). Standardized approaches will be 
used [ADDRESS_676529] and ectopy. ECG recordings with >20% ventricular 
ectopic beats will be excluded from analyses 92. Graphical analysis will include 5-min 
averaged heart rate (HR) patterns, hourly power  spectral analysis, hourly Poincaré plots 
and beat-by-beat HR tachograms . As there is no consensus whether respi[INVESTIGATOR_521568] o ffers useful physiologic information vs. 
introduction of artifact, we will perfo rm sensitivity analyses with unadjusted and 
“adjusted” respi[INVESTIGATOR_521569] 93. To assess ECG measures independent of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_521570], a 5 min ECG period will be selected and restricted to normal breathing during wakefulness at the beginni ng, and also at the end of the PSG. ECG 
markers will be analyzed as continuous outcomes, averaging information from 5 min intervals of NSR periods deriving an aggregate su mmary of electrophysiological variability. 
To take into account sleep state, 5-mi n ECG windows during sleep vs. wake will be 
selected for analyses. ECG analyses will be performed on concatenated epochs (30 sec 
windows): 1) Epochs with apneas/hypopneas vs.  those without, 2) REM vs. NREM epochs 
and 3) Epochs with EEG arousals vs. those without. 
 
3) 7-21 Day CONTINUO US ECG MONITORING.    
Procedure:  A 3-lead (2 channel), wireless, lightwe ight (3.2 ounce) ECG monitoring device 
(Heartrak External Cardiac Ambulatory Tele metry ®) will be used to collect the ECG data 
over a 7-21 day period in those with PAF  after the baseline and follow-up DCRU/CRU

An intravenous catheter will be pl aced by [CONTACT_521613]. The sample will be 
divided into tubes for the varied analyses (20 mL clot for serum, 20 mL EDTA, 4.5 mL special 
anticoagulant tube, 5 mL citr ate, 2.5 PAXgene). Clots will be centrifuged and the serum 
removed within 1 hr of venipuncture.  Assays will be stored in dedicated, alarmed freezers at -
80°C in the DCRU/CRU Core Lab until shipped to the UVM Biochemistry Lab. Extra aliquots 
designated for future studies will be prepared and stored at -80 °C.  
Relevant Biomarker Variables:  Assays were selected based upon literature or our own

the BNII nephelometry utilizing a particl e enhanced immunoassay with intra-assay and 
inter-assay CVs of 2.1%-5.7%. Circulating IL-6 and sIL-6R will be measured by [CONTACT_153535]-
sensitive ELISA (R&D Systems with inter-a ssay CVs 6.3%-15%). Endothelin-[ADDRESS_676534] (R&D Systems with inter-assay CV of 6.5% and intra-assay CV 
of 4.6%). Oxidized LDL will be measured by [CONTACT_521614] (Mercodia Oxidized LDL 
Competitive ELISA) with intr a-assay and inter-assay CV's < 10%. Samples will be run in 
batch and in duplicate; if they  do not agree within pr e-specified levels, they are re-run. 
Because additional aliquots will be saved, ot her assays will be possible as emerging 
science identifies their value. 
 
6) DNA collection.  Blood will be collected to extract RNA, which will be stored to test future 
hypotheses regarding genetic determi nants of treatment response. 
 7) OVERNIGHT URINE.  Procedure:  An overnight urine will be obtained and 3 -1.0 ml, 1 
– 9.0 ml plain urine and 1 – 9.0 ml acetic  acid aliquots will be stored at -80 °C.  
Relevant Biomarker Variable.  The proposed measurement for urinary isoprostane 8-epi-
prostaglandin F2a, a stabl e nonenzymatic oxidation product of arachidonic acid 
95, 96 
(expressed as ng/mmol urinary creatinine), is an inexpensive ELISA validated against gas 
chromatography-mass spectroscopy 97 and used in the Framingham Heart Study 98, with 
unpublished data showing its elevation in SDB.  
 
8) ANTHROPOMETRY.  Height (inches, cm) is measured with the subject in stocking feet, 
using a wall-mounted stadiometer; weight (pounds, kg) with a calibrated digital scale. Neck 
circumference  (cm) is determined with a non-stretchabl e measuring tape (nearest 0.5 cm) 
while the subject is seated wit h the head in the Frankfort horiz ontal plane, measuring below 
the thyroid prominence, perpendicular to the horizontal axis of the neck.  Waist  circumference  
(cm) is measured at the smallest ar ea between the lower ribs and iliac crest. Hip 
circumference (cm) 
is measured  at the widest area around t he buttocks. The wrist, abdominal, thigh, calf, and 
mid upper arm circumferences will also be measured using a non-st retchable measuring 
tape.  Skinfolds are measured with calibrated metal caliper s from 7 sites (chest, calf, thigh, 
calf, subscapular, midaxillary, suprailiac, abdomi nal), using a rotational order, obtaining 
additional measures if variation >10%. 
 
9) RESTING BLOOD PRESSURE (BP).  BP will be measured after the participant has 
been sitting quietly for at least [ADDRESS_676535] chart.  M easurements will be repeated three times and 
recorded.  
 
10) QUESTIONNAIRES (Appendix B) . The following will be collected: a) The  Berlin 
Sleep Questionnaire, a simple 10-item questionnaire that categorizes sleep apnea risk 
99, b) Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_7110] 100, a simple 8-item questionnaire to assess sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008],

and Strohl,Kingman  
 
 
V11 03/01/2016                           Page 24 c) The  Sleep Habits and Medical Condition Questionnaire 101, which includes 
comorbidities, medication use (including ant i-arrhythmic medications), caffeine use, 
smoking, alcohol use, etc., d) The Medical Outcomes Survey-SF 36 (MOS-SF) 102, a 
standardized tool for assessing general health status, physical and social functioning, 
and fatigue, e) Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), which assesses depression 
symptoms. It has ten questions where the answers will be added to indicate severity of depression.  The Research Assistant will score depression questionnaires and if the score 
is indicative of depression (10 or greater) t he Research Assistant will then contact a study 
physician who will determine appropriate referrals and responses and contact [CONTACT_521615]/p sychiatric consultation. If there was any 
indication that a participant was in imminent danger to himself or others, the participant 
would be advised to go to the nearest emergency room for evaluation by a psychiatrist. If signs of depression, anxiety or other p sychological disorders were evident without 
evidence for immediate risk, the participant would be advised to contact a psychologist 
for further evaluation.  f) Daily  ECG/Activity Log, which will be completed during 7-21 
day ECG monitoring including data on sleep/wake times including naps, periods of vigorous activity, caffeine use, alcohol use, smoking, monitor removal time and 
symptoms (e.g. palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], dyspnea, chest pain) g) Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality-
of-life, a 20-item questionnaire that assesses the impact of atrial fibrillation on quality of 
life.  
11) [ADDRESS_676536]. Baseline oxygen saturation and heart rate will be recorded. If 
oxygen saturation >90%, then proceed with prot ocol. The patient will walk for [ADDRESS_676537] if O2 sat drops to 
≤80% for 6 consecutive seconds and/or signs and symptoms of dyspnea, chest 
discomfort, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_521571]. If the test is terminated 
before [ADDRESS_676538] rate the 
symptoms of breathlessness and leg fatigue. Any medications taken prior to the 6 
minute walk will be recorded along with dose and time.   
 12) Arterial Applanation Tonometry:  Arterial Applanation Tonometry is a noninvasive 
technique that provides the basis for hi gh fidelity analysis of central and peripheral pulse 
pressures. Waveforms of radial artery recordings will be calibrated with 
sphygmomanometric brachial artery mean and diastolic pressure measurements. Radial measurements will be performed on the same a rm using the SphygmoCor device after 
sphygmomanometric pressure is obtained with use of an applanation tonometry probe containing a solid state high fidelity Millar transducer over the radial artery with a 
minimum of two consecutive measurements to  obtain pulse wave analysis results. For 
pulse wave velocity, lead II ECG (LL, LA, RA) will be performed along with cardotid and femoral applanation tomometry. Orientation and pressure applied to the transducer will 
be adjusted to optimize applanation of t he artery between the transducer and the

V11 03/01/[ADDRESS_676539] analysis will be assessed 
and provide measures of arterial stiffness and indices of subclinical atherosclerosis, and 
correlated with changes in oxidative stress ma rkers. Waveforms will be processed using 
the SphygmoCor software (model EM3, versi on CvMS 9.0, Atcor Medical Pty, West 
Ryde, Australia).) The applanation tonometry measurements will be obtained the morning of the baseline and 3-month follow- up visits using a standardized protocol. 
 
13) MultiSense™ Monitoring: The MultiSense™ Monitor is a self-contained, reusable, 
rechargeable, battery-powered, flexible band-aid-like strip, meas uring 10.2x3.0 cm 
(4x1.2 inches), that is capable of det ecting and recording a number of correlated 
physiological parameters. The monitor is t aped to the participant’s chest using a FDA 
approved, disposable, double-backed adhesive tape. The device provides a continuous 
detection and recording, up to 10 days, of high quality ECG signals. The device also provides pulse synchronous measures of blood oxygen saturation and concomitant indices of physical activity and body position (eg. Upright, or lying on back, stomach, 
right side, or left side). The double-backed adhesive tape insures motionless, waterproof contact [CONTACT_521616], t he electrodes and other sensors of the 
MultiSense™ Monitor. At the end of the m onitoring period, the accompanying software 
enables a PC to download the recorded data, display, and analyze the data.  The software mentioned above includes an i ndustry-proven arrhythmia-recognition 
package provided by a 3
rd party (Monebo Technologies). It has been thoroughly tested 
using standard (MIT-BIH/AHA/NST) arrhyt hmia databases, and has earned FDA 501(k) 
approval. The software allows automated ECG analysis and interpretation by [CONTACT_521617], QRS detection and measurement, QRS 
feature extraction, classification or normal and ventricular ectopic beats, heart rate measurement, measurement of PR and QT intervals, and rhythm interpretation. 
 
14) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): An MRI is an electronic pi[INVESTIGATOR_521572] a strong magnet instead of x-ray energy.  The MR scan time will be [ADDRESS_676540] 
clinical MRI evaluation.  Because the research MRI cannot exclude abnormalities, no report from the scan will be generated.  However,  if during the process of reviewing the 
research MRI an unexpected abnormality is seen,  it will be reported to the participant 
and their physician.    
 
15) Cognitive Battery and Questionnaires (Only for participants with MRI)

V11 03/01/2016                           Page 26 A complete comprehensive evaluation of me mory and thinking skills will be performed on 
those that participate in t he Magnetic Resonance Im aging sub-study. The cognitive battery 
includes the Mini Mental State Examinat ion (MMSE), an 11-question measure that tests 
five areas of cognitive function:  orientation, registration, att ention and calculation, recall, 
and language., the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), evaluates verbal learning 
and memory, the Brief Visuospatial Memory Te st (BVMT-R), assesses visual memory, the 
Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), evaluates cerebral dysfunction, Trails Making Test A 
and B, a test of visual a ttention and task switching, Delis-Kaplan Executive Function 
System (DKEFS) which measures a variety or verbal and nonverbal executive functions, 
and the Ruff 2 & [ADDRESS_676541] which measures  sustained attention and 
selective attention. 
 There will be two questionnaires that the participant will be asked to complete. The Beck Depression Inventory, a 21 question multiple choice questionnaires used for measuring the 
severity of depression and the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory which is a measurement 
scale to assess the dominance of a person’s right or left handedness in everyday activities.

Apnea [central apneas/hour of sleep, Central Apnea Index (CAI)], 4) Periodic Breathing and 5) EEG arousals [per hour of sleep, Arousal Index (AI)].   OUTCOME:  1) PAF (SA1) and 2) AF burden defined as frequency of AF paroxysms overall and 
based on self-reported sleep vs. wake (SA2 and 3) COVARIATES: Age, race, body mass index (BMI, kg/m

ANALYTIC METHOD BY [CONTACT_521618]. 
SA1. Quantify the extent that SDB and its subtypes are associated with PAF. This aim will be 
addressed by [CONTACT_521619]. We 
will separately analyze each SDB vari able (primary variable: AHI) to obtain an estimate and 95% CI 
of the odds ratio of PAF for a 1-unit increase in  the SDB exposure. Non-linear effects between SDB 
and the log odds of PAF will be assessed using restricted cubic splines. Knots for the spline will be based on the SDB threshold at which PAF risk increases. Unadjusted and hierarchical adjusted models will be performed using the covariates listed above. The secondary exposure variables (e.g. hypoxia, OAHI, CAI, AI) will be considered in separate models. 
Exploratory Aim 1a.  Cardiac structure, autonomic and biochemical variables (Table 2) will 
explain a proportion of the SDB and PAF relationship.  This aim will be addressed by [CONTACT_521620]’s mediation formula 
[ADDRESS_676542] of a given intermediate variable in the relationship 
between SDB (defined by [CONTACT_111302]) and PAF. The approach involves a model for each mediator (e.g. a general linear model for a continuous mediator) and possibly a random effect to account for clustering due to matching and can be thought of as  a generalized structural equations model. This 
approach will allow us to simultaneously assess multiple mediators and will also allow us to consider AHI as a continuous variable. Each model will be fit using likelihood methods and model fit will be checked using appropriate information criteria . After fitting the overall model, we will obtain, 
for each mediator, an estimate of the indirect effect (e.g. the portion of the overall effect of SDB on PAF mediated through the intermediate variable). A bootstrap resampling technique will be used to 
obtain a 95% CI for each indirect effect. If the CI does not contain zero, this will indicate statistically significant mediation.  
Exploratory Aim 1b.  Explore age interactions in the SDB-PAF relationship.  Each conditional 
logistic regression model will include an interaction between age and SDB to investigate if age is a 
modifier of the effect of SDB on PAF, i.e. whether the odds ratio of PAF for a 1-unit increase in SDB varies by [CONTACT_654]. 
SA2. Examine patterns of PAF burden via 1-week continuous ECG monitoring relative to 
SDB. We will model the relationship between mean frequency AF paroxysm variation and SDB 
(e.g. AHI considered as a continuous variable). A linear regression model will be used to assess 
possible quadratic and threshold effects of SDB on variation. These models may also include sleep state by [CONTACT_521621] (along with the state indicator) to examine if the effect of SDB on variation differs by [CONTACT_521622]. Maximum likelihood (based on a normal distribution for variation if appropriate) will be used to fit models, and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) will be used to select the best fitting model. Estimates of the effect of SDB on variation (and corresponding 95% CI) will be obtained based on the selected model.  
SA3. Examine the effects of SDB (AHI>15) treatment for 3 months on AF paroxysm 
frequency and also measures of autonomic function, cardiac morphology, biochemical 
measures in those with SDB and PAF.  For this subgroup of SDB (AHI>15) and PAF, we will 
perform paired t-tests to compare pre- and post- treatment mean outcomes (Primary outcome: 
AF paroxysm frequency from 1-week ECG monitoring) and also ECHO and biochemical measures. For any outcome for which a departure in normality is found (based on the Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152]-Wilk test) but a transformation of the outcome cannot be found to adequately address the issue,

with 90% power), assuming a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05, a correlation in AHI between cases 
and controls of zero and a probability of PAF of 0.[ADDRESS_676545] deviation increase in AHI. Alternatively assuming that the probability that AHI>15 for patients without PAF is 30% 
64, a 
sample size of [ADDRESS_676546] an odds ratio of PAF of 2.13 with 90% power assuming a 2-sided alpha-level of 0.05. Note that this calculation assumes that the correlation for SDB between subjects with and without PAF is 0.20, as suggested by [CONTACT_219245] (1988)
[ADDRESS_676547] mediation, a difference in 
coefficients approach will be used 110  which involves the fitting of two logistic regression models 
that model the association between SDB (AHI>15) and the log odds of PAF (one with and the 
other without the potential mediator in the model) to estimate the proportion of exposure effect that is mediated. Assuming a correlation between the adjusted and unadjusted effect estimates of 0.9 and that the probability of PAF in SDB and no SDB is 0.07 and 0.01 respectively (based upon prior data 
2), a sample size of 150/group will be able to detect mediation proportions of 0.5 
with 84% power assuming a 2-sided 0.[ADDRESS_676548].  Although power may be reduced depending on the observed imbalance in sample sizes for the SDB and no SDB groups, power will be increased due to matching (not taken into account here to be conservative). 
SA2. Using a two-sample t-test (2-sided 0.05 alpha-level) to test for a difference in mean 
variation between the SDB (AHI>15) and no SDB groups, a sample size of 150 (75 with SDB 
and 75 without SDB) will detect mean differences within 0.[ADDRESS_676549] deviations with 80% power and 0.[ADDRESS_676550] deviations with 90% power.  
SA3. For a log-normally distributed outcome, assuming a correlation between pre- and post-PAF 
burden of 0.8 and a coefficient of variation of 1.5 (based upon prior data 
111), a sample size of [ADDRESS_676551] and pre PAF burden of 0.83 with 83.1% power based on a 
paired t-test and a two-sided significance level of 0.05.

monitoring, the MultiSense™  sensor and ECG monitoring may cause skin irritation. 
However, the latter is usually minor and temporary. The partici pant may feel some pressure 
at the site of the pr obe that is used to perform echocardiography. If you r equire an 
echocardiogram with a contrast dye, you will receive an intravenous (IV) administered 
contrast dye that contains microscopic bubbl es during your echocar diogram. This type of 
contrast dye may, in rare cases, cause severe and potentially life-threatening allergic 
reactions, including a drop in blood pressure, di fficulty breathing, fainting, and internal 
organ failure. This agent may also cause te mporary minor back pain, a headache, and/or 
itchy skin all of which usually goes away within [ADDRESS_676563] patient-level data; however, as described below  there are multiple levels of safety 
measures that are taken to avoid this.  CPAP is the most commonly prescribed treatm ent for SDB.  The use of CPAP can be 
associated with a number of minor side effects,  including nasal congestion, runny nose, dry 
nose or mouth, eye irritation from mask leaks,  skin irritation from the mask, or discomfort 
from the mask or air pressure.  PAP therapy may rarely cause nose bleeds and can cause worsening of a sinus condition or abdominal bloating.  The potential for skin and eye irritation is 
minimized by [CONTACT_521626] a humid ifier and application of appropriate pressure 
levels. 
 
 
The risks of the 7T MRI sub-study are the sa me as the risks of a routine MRI of the 
brain.  MRI has no known long term risks. There are no known biological risks 
associated with MR imaging.  An MRI may c ause possible anxiety for people due to the 
confined space of the testing area resulti ng in feelings of claustrophobia and the loud 
banging made by [CONTACT_101488].  Protective  headphones that minimize the noise inside 
the MRI and allow the technologists to talk to you directly to the participant will be used..  Some people feel discomfort associated with lying still within the MR scanner.  The use 
of a bite block may assist in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_521573]. There may be local pain and bruising during the placement of the IV. Patients with severe kidney disease are at risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a

implanted stimulator device, or cardiac pacemaker.  If any devices or implants or if they 
have a history of metal in their eye or body, the MR technologist will be notified. There is 
also a risk of injury if metal is brought in to the imaging room, which may be pulled into 
the magnet.  No magnetic objects (pocket knives, key chains, necklaces, earrings) from clothes and body will be allowed in the scanner area to prevent any injuries.  A Safety zone is established around the MR scanner to  prevent objects containing iron from 
coming into contact [CONTACT_521627].   
 
Repeated evaluations of mood and mental status may be slightly frustrating or produce 
fatigue and boredom. Rest breaks will be provided during cognitive testing, and the study staff members are trained to offer assistance and to discontinue testing if 
necessary. 
 
Protection Against Risks .   
 
A. RECRUITMENT AND INFORMED CONSENT 
 
Trained research personnel who have completed necessary certification for human 
subject research will screen Electrophysiology (EP) Clinic referrals for cases (those with PAF), Cardiology/Internal Medicine clinics for controls (those without AF) and supplementary recruitment from the Echoc ardiography Database for controls (those 
without AF). Participants will be screened when pr esenting for a routine EP clinic visit 
(or Cardiology/Internal Medi cine visit for controls), a fter the caring physician has 
ascertained that the patient may be intere sted in learning more about the study and 
meeting study staff. When meeting with the res earch staff (at the clinic visit or another 
scheduled time), full written informed consent will be obtained. Alternatively, the charts 
of potentially eligible cases with PAF will be marked to inform the EP physician of eligibility. The physician will be asked to br iefly discuss the study with the patient and 
assess interest. Patients who express interest  will be contact[CONTACT_521628],  a face to face meeting will be arranged to 
fully review the protocol and obtain informed consent. Consent forms will explain in a lay 
persons' terminology the nature of all procedur es. It will be stressed that participation is 
voluntary. The research assistant and PI  [INVESTIGATOR_521574]. The 
investigator will also be available to answer questions about the study then or at other 
times. Participants are also informed that at  any time that can request that any stored 
blood be discarded and not used for research purposes. All activities will be compliant with local IRB and HIPPA guidelines, such as obtaining physician permission to initiate

and Strohl,Kingman  
 
 
V11 03/01/[ADDRESS_676565] at that time also will be 
checked to assure that plans are compliant with current rules . 
Although the clinics will be the pr imary source of recruitment, controls we will also 
assess eligibility of individuals from t he UHCMC/CCF Echocardiography Database 
(>[ZIP_CODE] ECHOs/year). [CONTACT_521655] will identify pat ients who meet matching criteria (left 
ventricular function, age, sex, race) based upon the cases who have been enrolled in 
the study. Referring physicians will be notif ied through emails or phone calls when 
eligible patients are identified. A letter signed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Hoit, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_521575]. A time will be arranged for the patient to meet the research staff in a face to face meeting fully review the protocol and 
obtain informed consent. 
 
B. PROTECTION AGAINST RISKS 
 
All participant information will be kept strictly confidential and used for research purposes only. Records will be identified by  a subject ID number rather than the 
subjects' name, and all will be secured in lock ed files in secured rooms. Computers are 
located in restricted access research suites; computer information is protected by [CONTACT_521629] a firewall. Computer files do not permit linking individual data with 
medical or other data collected for research purposes. The list of names and identification numbers will be stor ed separately from other data in locked files to which 
project staff only will have access. Informed cons ents explicitly state that information on 
non-paternity is never revealed. All pr esentations and publications will only utilize 
aggregate data.  
Data transmission between the Electrophysiology Core and Echocardiography Laboratory 
and the Administrative Center-CC will be accomplished through a secure, password protected website using a Virt ual Private Network (VPN), an established method for secure 
transfer. Implementation of this method will prevent unauthorized viewing of participant 
information during data transmission. The Ad ministrative Center-CC and Cores will not 
receive any information allowing participant ident ification. Participant data received by [CONTACT_521630]-CC will be ident ified only by [CONTACT_521631]. 
 
Risks will be minimized by [CONTACT_521632], appropriate fitting of nasal CPAP 
masks and use of a humidifier with the PAP devices. If nasal symptoms are experienced, a study physician will contact [CONTACT_521633]-the-counter or 
prescription decongestant is needed.  Visi ts will be scheduled during a time when the 
individual is stable and free of acute illnesses.   Staff will be trained and certified to perform 
phlebotomy and other research procedures.    Abnormal findings requiring urgent evaluation ma y also be identified at the time of the 
DCRU/CRU visits. All such findings will be labeled as adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs) as appropriate.  A blood pressure finding of systolic greater than

to assess for evidence of end organ dysfunction. Such a finding will lead to immediate 
transfer to the emergency room for acute blood pressure treatment. Asymptomatic 
hypertension without evidence of end organ d ysfunction will result in contact [CONTACT_521634]’s primary care physician to notify them of the finding or if the 
patient does not have a primary care physician, referral to a clinic to provide antihypertensive treatment. Similarly, par ticipants with an increased heart rate (i.e. 
>120bpm) will undergo medical evaluation by a ph ysician (PI [INVESTIGATOR_521576]) in 
the CRU. If the participant is deemed unstable, then the participant will be sent to the emergency department.    It is also possible the concerning arrhythmias or concerning symptoms may arise during the 7-[ADDRESS_676566] source for the participants to call 24-7 if there are symptoms during the monitoring. 
If the technician identified a serious arrhythmia (e.g. high degree atrioventricular block, ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation with rapid rate (>120bpm))or concerning symptoms, then the PI [INVESTIGATOR_521577].   Intravenous catheter and blood sample collect ion may cause a small bruise that is 
temporarily uncomfortable, but  will disappear in several days. A topi[INVESTIGATOR_521578] w hen necessary. To minimize the possibility of fainting, the 
intravenous catheter and blood sa mple collection will take place while the participant is 
sitting.  A medical release will be given to the partici pants to sign to authorize release of their 
health information to their physician if there is  any urgent health information that requires 
immediate attention. Letters outlining results of the sleep study will be sent to the participant and with the permission of the participant  will also be sent to the primary care or 
caring physician to arrange for appropriate treatment and follow-up of sleep disordered breathing.   
Data Safeguarding Plan: Data security is addressed at many levels. The database 
administrator will be responsible for provid ing and documenting appropriate user access 
to the study database, preventing such data security problems as: unauthorized internal 
access to data, external access to data,  and malicious intent to destroy data and 
systems. Data audit software and systems will be used that document data modification, 
user access associated with modification, dat a associated with modification, and values 
prior to modification. The database administrator will also be responsible for optimizing database 
performance, reliability and back-up of data. Data transmission amongst the 
Administrative Center-CCI and the Cores and University of Vermont will be accomplished through a secure, password prot ected website using a Virtual Private 
Network (VPN), an established method for secure data transfer, and use of encryption.

V11 03/01/[ADDRESS_676567] will be implemented as appropriate.  
 
SOURCES OF MATERIALS  
The research data will be collected strictly  for research and include polysomnography, 
echocardiography, electrocardiography (from polysomnography and 7-21 day ECG 
monitoring), anthropometry, blood pressure and blood or urine assayed for markers of 
inflammation and oxidative stress. Ques tionnaires addressing medical conditions, 
medications, sleep habits and symptoms will be administered. Participants will be asked 
to provide permission to obtain health reco rds for medical encounters in order to 
adjudicate adverse events if needed. Other data that will be reviewed to ascertain 
eligibility will be from the echocardiography dat abase and medical records. In addition, 
for those placed on CPAP, CPAP compliance and residual apnea hypopnea index using CPAP will be ascertained using data electr onically stored on the CPAP units 
participants will be using.  
Linkages to subjects and access to research data : All research data will be collected on 
standardized research forms with de-identified ID  numbers, but without personal identifiers. 
Any data collected from medical records will be entered onto case report forms with only 
visit ID numbers, excluding pers onal identifiers.  Only study personnel will have access to 
research data which is kept in either locked cabinets or password computers in locked 
buildings.  All personal data will be stored separately from de-i dentified research data. The 
primary data files are stored in locked cabinets in secured rooms in this research facility.  
Bloods will be stored using de-ident ified bar codes at the Co re Laboratory at Case until 
shipped to University of Vermont. All data trans mitted to the Administrative Center-CCI will 
include no personal identification data. Data received at Administrative Center-CCI will be stored in a dedicated MySQL system in a server  within a private network. Access to such 
data will be through VPN and a dually-authenticated client computer. Access to the query, 
exploration and exchange interface of the cu stomized Physio-MIMI system will be permitted 
only to authorized team members using the re sident secure, Role-Based Access Control 
mechanism.

context of normative data (e.g., Epworth sl eepi[INVESTIGATOR_521579]) as well as blood pressure 
findings. If approved by [CONTACT_423], these re sults will also be sent to the subject’s 
physician. Participants will also receive a monetary compensation of $75 for each overnight visit to the DCRU/CRU for their time . To receive payment the participant must 
agree to complete a W-9 form which requires them to provide an address and social security number to the accounting departm ent.  This payment may be considered 
taxable income by [CONTACT_152637].  The participant will be issued a 1099-Misc form only if payment exceeds $[ADDRESS_676569] during the DCRU/CRU stay. We also believe that the gains in understanding of the 
relationship between SDB and an important outco me, atrial fibrillation, will outweigh any 
potential risk to the participants. Since the ri sks of participation for individual subjects 
are extremely low, and the benefits to society are potentially large, the risk-benefit ratio 
is more than acceptable. Participants who c hoose not to participate in this study may 
seek evaluation and treatment for po ssible SDB from their physician. 
 
SDB is very common, and may have serious adverse health consequences such as 
increased risk of clinically significant arrhyt hmias such as AF and associated increase in 
morbidity and mortality. The proposed study  will further explore linkages between SDB 
and PAF, as well as help to elucidate the pathophysiology of these associations. Given that SDB is treatable, im proved understanding of these interrelationships of SDB and 
AF could have very significant clinical impact. 
 
Research Injury Language:  
If injury occurs as a result of your involv ement in this research, medical treatment is 
available from University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_161501] t he Cleveland Clinic or another medical facility

data in a customized instance of Physio-MIMI system developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Zhang (PI) as an NCRR-funded Multi-CTSA-site project for federated access to PSG data in sleep 
labs. Our approach will allow the reuse of several Physio-MIMI components: (1) its built-in user-friendly query interface call ed VISAGE with a web-based case-control 
exploration engine; (2) its Sleep Domain Onto logy (SDO) for semantic interoperability 
and data quality control; and (3) its flexible interface with a relational database system. 
To achieve this, we will (1) design a study-specif ic data model for storying the rich study 
data in MySQL tables; (2) extending the data di ctionary to account for additional terms 
not covered in SDO; (3) interfaces fo r data collection, data conversion and data 
exchange. Data sharing will be facilitated by [CONTACT_521595]-MIMI's extensible Role-Based Access Control mechanism, which allows for fine-controlled access to data: based on specified source tables, specified dat a fields, and counts limit. Curated data and 
application tools will be made available for long-term data sharing and dissemination. 
 
Adverse Event Reporting.   Reporting of adverse event s will follow standard reporting 
guidelines. Each event will be classified according to its severity, whether it was expected or 
unexpected, and its likelihood of relatedness to the study. 
 
Immediate and Urgent Medical Referrals  are medical conditions that require timely 
identification and possible treatment. Once identified either at  the DCRU/CRU, the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_521580] 24 hours (for Urgent Referrals) or before discharge from the 
DCRU/CRU (for Immediate Alerts). If confi rmed as meeting Referral criteria, the 
Immediate/Urgent Referral form is completed which indicates which follow-up activities 
occurred, including whether the participant and or his/her physician was contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], 
whether contact [CONTACT_521635]/or letter, and what recommendations were 
made.  
 
A Safety Monitor will be assigned to the study  (UHCMC, Kristie Ross MD and at CCF, 
Harneet Walia MD), who will review adverse  events and data targeted by [CONTACT_521636] (e.g., blood pressure) findings wa rrant immediate intervention. If so, the

be defined and reported to the IR B, NIH, and the Safety Monitor  in accordance with the 
rules regulating each severity class (expected vs. unexpected, serious vs. other; related vs. 
unrelated).   On a weekly basis, the P.I. will review all data collected, includi ng logs of phone calls 
between the coordinator and participant, ECG data and biochemical levels from blood tests.

 3. INTRODUCTION 
3.1. Purpose of this Document  
This document provides a detailed description of the statistical methods and procedures to be 
implemented during the analysis of protocol SRS 1.0.  The methods and procedures are intended 
to support the generation of a Clinical Study Report (CSR), including detailed descriptions of the 
populations and methodologies, as well as the post -text tables, analysis summary tables, patient  
data listings, and descriptive graphics.  
This study is a prospective, multicente r, single -arm, open- label trial e nrolling approximately [ADDRESS_973000] -void 
residual (PVR) of ≤ 150 ml.  The pre -specified success criterion for this study is that ≥50 percent 
of patient s will achieve adequate bladder drainage over 90 days.  
The planned analyses identified in this statistical analysis plan (SAP) may be included in regulatory submissions and/or future manuscripts.  Exploratory analyses, not identified in this 
SAP, may be performed to support the clinical development program.  Any post -hoc, or unplanned, 
analyses that are performed but not identified in th is SAP will be clearly identifie d in the CSR .  
The structure and content of this SAP provides sufficient detail to meet the requirements identified by [CONTACT_714477] (ICH): Guidance on Statistical Principles in 
Clinical Trials.    
3.2. Supporting Documents  
This SAP is intended to be used in conjunction with the following documents:  
• The protocol, SRS 1.0 
• The list of tables, listings, and figures, SRS SAP Index 2.0  
• The templates of tables, listings, and figures, SRS TLF 1.0.  
The template document shows all of the data that will be summarized, graphed or listed.  For this reason, this document does not enumerate the data variables, but simpl y refers to the appropriate 
table, listing, or figure.  
4. STUDY OBJECTIVES  AND ENDPOINTS  
4.1. Study Objectives  
 
The primary objective of this study is to determine the proportion of patient s who achieve adequate 
bladder drainage over [ADDRESS_973001] -void residual (PVR) of ≤ 150 ml.  The pre -
specified success criterion for this study is that ≥ 50 percent of patient s will achieve adequate 
bladder drainage at each of the 4 evaluations over 90 days.  The primary objective will be met if 
SRS Medical Systems, Inc.  
Statistical Analysis Plan   April 1, 2019 
 
Version 2.0  Confidential  Page 9 of 21  
 the one-sided lower bound of the 95% confidence limit for the  incidence of patient s who achieve 
adequate bladder drainage at each of the 4 evaluations over 90 days  is ≥ 50%.   
 
There are 5  secondary objec tives, presented below in the order from the protocol. 
● To measure the effects of the Spanner stent on bladder drainage, defined by [CONTACT_496511] s who achieve a post -void residual of ≤ 150 ml over 30 days.  
● To measure the effects of the Spanner stent on bladder drainage, defined by [CONTACT_496511] s who achieve a post -void residual of ≤ 250 ml over 30 days.  
● To measure the effects of the Spanner stent on bladder drainage, defined by [CONTACT_496511] s who achieve a post -void re sidual of ≤ 250 ml over 90 days.  
● To measure the effects of the Spanner stent over time on maximum flow rate (Qmax in ml/sec) 
as assessed by [CONTACT_714478]  
● To measure the effects of the Spanner stent over time on the International Prostate Symptom 
Score (IPSS)  
 The [ADDRESS_973002] will be performed for the secondary objectives. 
4.2. Endpoints  
The data from this clinical investigation will based on the investigator / site reported information.  
4.2.1. Primary Effectiveness Endpoint  
PVR levels will be monitored throughout the [ADDRESS_973003] using abdominal ultrasound. The hypothesis is that over 90 days of stent use, 50% of the patient s will be able to successfully empty their  bladder, as defined by [CONTACT_714479] ≤ 150 ml at all four 
visits.     
 Patient s wh ere the PVR is > 150 ml  at 1 or more of the 4 visits will be considered a treatment 
failure .  Patient s who fail to attend any of the 4 scheduled visits , or withdraw prematurely,  will 
also be treated in primary the  analysis as a treatment failure .  Patient s where the PVR is  <150 ml  
at all 4 visits will be considered a treatment success .   
4.2.2. Secondary Effectiveness Endpoint s 
There are 3 secondary effectiveness  endpoints : 
  Secondary Effectiveness Endpoint No. 1  
● Patient s with a PVR through the first removal visit is ≤ 150 ml of urine ( visit 1 and 2)  will be 
considered as having achieved the first secondary effectiveness endpoint.  Patients where the PVR is >[ADDRESS_973004] secondary effectiveness endpoint.   
 
SRS Medical Systems, Inc.  
Statistical Analysis Plan   April 1, 2019 
 
Version 2.0  Confidential  Page 10 of 21  
 Secondary Effectiveness Endpoint No. 2  
● Patient s with a PVR through the first removal visit is ≤ 250 ml of urine ( visit 1 and 2)  will be 
considered as having achieved the second secondary effectiveness endpoint .  Patient s where the 
PVR is > 250 ml  at visit 1 or 2 will be considered as having failed to achieve the second secondary 
effectiveness endpoint.  Patient s who fail to attend both scheduled visits, or withdraw prematurely 
from the study prior to visit 2 will be considered as having failed to achieve the second  secondary 
effectiveness endpoint.   
 
Secondary Effectiveness Endpoint No. 3  
● Patient s with a PVR through the third  removal visit is ≤ 250 ml of urine ( visits 1, 2, 3 and 4) will 
be considered as having achieved  the third  secondary effect iveness endpoint.  Patient s where the 
PVR is > [ADDRESS_973005] secondary 
effectiveness endpoint.     
4.2.3. Exploratory Effectiveness  Endpoints   
There are 2  additional  exploratory endpoints that will be evaluated in this  study : 
 Exploratory Effectiveness Endpoint  No. 1 
● Change from baseline (visit 1) at visits 2, 3, and 4 in the m aximum flow rate (Qmax in ml/sec) 
as assessed by [CONTACT_714480]. 2 
● Change from baseline (visit 2) at visits 3 and 4 in the IPSS To tal Symptom Score  
 Each of the 7 questions that compose the IPSS will be  scored on a 0 to 5 scale.  The total score can 
range from 0 to 35.  A n IPSS Total Symptom Score  of 1-7 is considered Mild , 8-19 is considered 
Moderate , and 20- 35 is considered Severe.  
  
   
5. STUDY OVERVIEW  
5.1. Study Design  
This clinical investigation is a prospective, multicente r, single -arm, open -label trial e nrolling 
approximately 105 patient s who are dependent on a urinary catheter.  Patient s will be fitted with a 
Spanne r stent and the stent will be replaced at an interval of approximately 30 days for a total of 
up to 90 days of use.  The Spanner Temporary Prostatic Stent is intended for temporary use (up to 
30 days) to maintain urine flow and allow voluntary urination for patient s who are not candidates 
for pharmacologic, minimally invasive or surgical treatment of the prostate.  Patient s will complete 
the study upon removal of the Spanner stent after [ADDRESS_973006] of a 90 day treatment period. Patient s will be fitted with a Spanner s tent and 
the stent will be replaced at an interval of approximately 30 days (25- 35 days permitted) for a total 
of up to 90 days of use (75- 105 days permitted). Patient s will complete the study upon removal of 
the Spanner stent after [ADDRESS_973007] -removal.  
All participants will undergo approximately 90 days of Spanner use, in the form of consecutive 
Spanner placements each lasting approximately 30 days (25 -35 days permitted).  During the [ADDRESS_973008] an 80% chance of showing that the success proportion in the Spanner group is 
statistically significantly greater than 50%, assuming that the device can achieve a 65% success rate, with a two-sided type 1 error rate of 5% , a sample size of n=85 completers will be needed for 
the study.  Assuming that a one -sided type 1 error rate of 5% will be adequate, the sample size of 
85 completers will provide 88% power.  Completers are those subjects whose endpoint is known 
at 90 days.  
 Assuming a dropout rate of 20%, the total sample size of n=[ADDRESS_973009]  using PASS 14.0.9 ( PASS 14 Power Analysis and Sample Size Software (2015). 
NCSS, LLC. Kaysville, Utah, [LOCATION_003], ncss.com/software/pass.)  
5.4. Estimated Duration of Patient  Participation  
Patient s will be enrolled in the trial for a period of up to [ADDRESS_973010] -removal follow -up prior to study discharge.

 7. ANALYSIS POPULATIONS  
The following populations will be considered fo r the summarization and analysis of the data from  
this study:  
Intent ion to Treat Population 
The Intent ion to Treat (ITT) population includes The ITT population will consist of any enrolled 
patient  who underwent an attempted Spanner device implant procedure.  This population will be 
used for all of the analyses unless otherwise stated.   
Per Protocol Population 
The Per Protocol (PP) population will consist of all patient s who are enrolled in the stu dy, have 
been implanted with a Spanner device, and have completed all study visits with no major protocol 
deviati ons while enrolled in the study .  A major protocol deviation is defined as any protocol 
deviation that may affect the primary endpoint. The PP population will only be used as an analysis 
population if the ITT population produces unexpected results that could have been caused by 
[CONTACT_23354]. 
Safety Population  
The safety population will consist of all subjects who are enrolled in the study.  
 
8. ANALYSIS CONVENTIONS  
Specific algorithms are discussed for imputing missing or partially missing dates, if deemed 
appropriate, under specific data topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102] .  Imputed or derived data will be  flagged in the individual 
patient  data listings .  Imputed data will not be incorporated into any raw or primary datasets . These 
data are retained in derived (or analysis) datasets.  
 Total duration on  study will be  calculated  as the difference between the date of informed consent  
and the last on- study observation.  All calculations defining the  duration on study will be 
performed relative to the date of informed consent  and follow the algorithm DURATION = 
[STUDY COMPLETION OR WITHDRAW DATE – INFORMED CONSENT  DATE ].   
 
General Conventions for Summarization  
Summary statistics will consist of the number and percentage of responses  or counts  at each level 
for categorical variables  (e.g. race).  F or continuous variables , and the sample size (n) , mean, 
median, standard deviation (SD), minimum, and maximum values  will be presented . 
 All mean and median values will be formatted to one more decimal place than the measured value. Standard deviation values will be formatted to two more decimal places than the measured value.  Minimum and maximum values will be presented with the same number of decimal places as the measured value.  
 The number and percentage of responses will be presented in the form XX (XX.X %).

13.4. Analysis of the Exploratory Effectiveness Endpoints  
The results of the Exploratory Effectiveness Endpoint analysis will be presented as described in 
the SRS TLF, Tables 34 through 39.  These include summary statistics (as described in Section 8) of the Qmax, IPSS, and QoL results.  Both the ITT and PP groups will be described.  
 
14. SAFETY  
The following sections describe how the safety results (adverse events) will be summarized.  All safety results will be presented using the Safety population. 
14.1. Adverse Events  Classification  
14.1.1. Reporting of Adverse Event s 
The following information regarding each AE will be obtained: date and time of onset and 
resolution (duration), severity (defined below), whether it was serious, any required treatment or action taken, outcome, relationship to the investigational device, wheth er anticipated or 
unanticipated per protocol definition.  The definitions of seriousness, severity, relationship to device, and outcome are provided in the SRS Protocol.     
14.1.2. Missing and Partial Adverse Event Dates  
The recorded dates for adverse events are important for an accurate tabulation of both events and patient s, and required for the following:  
 
1. Defining the start of the event  
2. Designation of unique adverse event occurrences recorded intra- patient . 
 Completely missing or partially missing adverse even t dates will be imputed as follows , after due 
diligence to obtain accurate adverse event  information has failed.   
 If the adverse event  start date is completely missing the adverse event  will be counted unless it can 
be determined that the adverse event  end date occurred prior to the start of the study procedure.  If 
the adverse event end date can be established as prior to the date of the study procedure , the adverse 
event  will be considered  as having occurred prior to the start of the study procedure and  will not 
be counted.

 If the adverse event  start date is partially missing and the partial date is not sufficient to determine 
if the event occurred after the start of the study procedure , then the adverse event  will be counted 
unless it can be determin ed that the adverse event end date occurred prior to  the study procedure .  
14.2. Analysis of Adverse Events  
The results of the safety analyses will be presented as described in the SRS TLF, Tables 40 through 
44.  These include summary statistics (as described in Section 8) of the following safety attributes:

 point Pain Intensity (via 0 -10 Numerical Pain Rating Scale) and Pain Reli ef 
(via 5 -Point Categorical Pain Relief Assessment) measurements will be 
performed. For statistical purposes, pain assessments performed after any 
dose of rescue will be censored  and imputed. The method of imputation will 
be described in the SAP, which will be finalized prior to unblinding of 
clinical trial subjects. Any subject requiring additional rescue medication may 
again receive ibuprofen 200mg and their data will be similarly censored and 
imputed. Pain scores and safety data will continue to be collected for  the 24-hour observation period. Rescue medication will not exceed ibuprofen 200 
mg q3h or 2400 mg in a 24-hour period.   
Patient  Global Evaluation of the study medication will be collected at 
Hour 24.25 or at the time of patient  withdrawal (if applicable), whichever 
occurs first, using a 0 -4 rating scale: (0) poor, (1) fair, (2) good, (3) very 
good, and (4) excellent.

 If a scheduled pain assessment and a scheduled PK sampling are at the same 
time point, the pain assessment should precede the PK sampling, but every 
attempt should be made to obtain the PK sample within the designated time window. 
The total amount of blood drawn for PK sampling is approximately 108 mL 
(18 blood samples of approximately 6 mL). 
The bioanalytical laboratory will perform the pharmacokinetic (PK) 
analysis on collected blood samples and provide a report on the plasma 
levels of acetaminophen.  
Actual sample collection time will be used for calculating the pharmacokinetic parameters. The peak concentration will be the observed 
maximum plasma drug concent ration; the time to peak concentration (t
max) 
will be the collection time at which C max is first observed. Areas under the 
plasma concentration -time curve from time zero to the time of the last 
measurable concentration (AUC0 -t) will be calculated by [CONTACT_734773]. AUC0 -∞ will be extrapolated if allowed by [CONTACT_26739].  
The PK Collection Lab Manual Guidelines for the site will be provided by 
[CONTACT_734774].  
ESTIMATED 
DURATION OF 
PATIENT 
PARTICIPATION  
IN THE STUDY:  The patient s must have the surgical procedure within 30 days of screening. 
The inpatient part of the study will be approximately 24 hours and there will 
be a 7 -day ± 2 -day follow- up period. The approximate maximum number of 
days totals 40 from screening through completion of the study. 
DURATION OF 
STUDY:  The study will be completed when the last patient  completes the last follow 
up phone call. The expectation is that the study will be completed within [ADDRESS_1003941] patient  entry.  
NUMBER OF 
PATIENTS:  A sufficient number of male and female patient s will be screened to enroll up 
to 110 patients that meet the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) 
Category I (healthy) or Category II (mild systemic disease) guidelines .

Impaction Pain Model (DIPM) and analysis of the results from a previous 
Phase 2 study comparing the safety and efficacy of  APAP in combination 
with oral pregabalin (Nevakar Protocol CP- NVK -009-0001). SPID 24 data 
for  APAP in that study suggested that a sample size of 44 patients pe r 
active group and 22 patient s in the placebo group should be adequate to 
evaluate similarities between the two active dose regimens vs placebo.

EVALUATION:  
 
 
  
 
 
 
SAFETY 
EVALUATION:  
(cont.) All potential patient s will undergo a urine drug screen , hematology , serology 
testing for HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C, and serum liver function testing 
at the screening visit. In addition, females will have a serum pregnancy  test. 
Prior to Hour 24 (±30 minutes), liver function testing will be repeated. 
All of  the study and rescue medications being evaluated in this study are 
marketed products in the [LOCATION_002]. 
Adverse events (AEs) will be assessed and recorded in the eCRF . This  
information will be collected as they occur or are reported at s creening and 
during the treatment  and post treatment  phase of the study patient regardless 
of severity or potential association with the study medication or study 
procedures. AEs will also be assessed and recorded in the eCRF at the time of 
follow-up telephone call at Day 7 (± 2 days) after discharge from the Clinical 
Research Unit. This follow -up telephone call designates that the patient  has 
completed the study. In addition, patient s/caregivers will be encouraged to 
report AEs of concern at any time in the interval between discharge and the 
follow-up call. 
Treatment -emergent AEs (TE AEs) will be summarized by [CONTACT_734775]. The events will be coded using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and summarized by 
[CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term (PT). The severity, relations hip 
to treatment, action taken, and outcome of the events will be documented in the source and captured in the eCRF. The incidence of all adverse events and drug- related adverse events will be evaluated. In the event of any health -
related emergency, the clinical site will have trained medical staff and a fully 
equipped emergency crash cart on site.  
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 All computations will be performed using SAS
® version 9.4 (SAS Institute, 
Cary, NC). Since this is a proof-of- concept study, statistically significant 
treatment differences will be declared if p ≤ 0.10 (one -sided), and no 
adjustments for multiple comparisons/end points will be performed.  All 
confide nce intervals will be one- sided 90% confidence intervals.  
The between -treatment comparisons that will be performed are:  
•  APAP  q8h versus Placebo 
•  APAP  q6h versus Placebo 
Descriptive statistics for numerical variables will include n (number of patients 
involved), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum values. 
Categorical variables will be described by [CONTACT_248023].    Treatment of 
missing data will be described in a statistical analysis plan and finalized prior 
to database lock .

  STATISTICAL 
ANALYSIS: 
(cont.)  Efficacy Data:  
Sum of Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) and Total Pain Relief (TOTPAR) 
from 0 to 24 hours will be analyzed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
model with treatment group as a fixed effect and  baseline pain intens ity a 
covariate. Other covariates may be explored and the final model will be 
described in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  Actual times will be used for 
calculating SPI[INVESTIGATOR_734726].  In addition, sensitivity analyses will be 
performed and will be de scribed in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
Time to Perceptible Pain Relief Confirmed (FPR -C, confirmed by [CONTACT_734776]), Time to Meaningful Pain Relief (MPR), and Time 
to Treatment Failure will each be analyzed using a log -rank test ; the log rank 
test may be stratified by [CONTACT_734777] (moderate / severe) or 
other variables as appropriate.  In addition, Kaplan- Meier curves will be 
presented by [CONTACT_1570]. 
The cumulative percentage of patients with pain at half gone over the 24-hour 
evaluation period will be summarized descriptively and plotted over time by 
[CONTACT_1570]. 
The Patient  Global Evaluation at 24.25 hours or patient withdrawal (if 
applicable)  whichever is first, will be analyzed using a model similar  to the 
primary analysis model . 
Pain Intensity (PI), Pain Intensity Difference (PID), and Pain Relief (PR) 
Ratings at each observation time following Dose [ADDRESS_1003945] ; however, any major modifications to the primary endpoint definition 
will also be reflected in a protocol amendment.  The SAP will be detailed in 
an addendum to the protocol. The SAP will be finalized and included in the addendum prior to unblinding of the study.

ANALGESIC:  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 RESCUE 
ANALGESIC:  (cont.)  Rescue medication will consist of one ibuprofen [ADDRESS_1003947] 4 ounces of water. Prior to each dose of rescue medication, 11-
Point Pain Intensity (via 0 -10 Numerical Pain  Rating Scale) and Pain Relief 
(via 5 -Point Categorical Pain Relief Assessment) measurements will be 
performed. For statistical purposes, pain assessments performed after any 
dose of rescue will be censored and imputed. The method of imputation will be described in the SAP, which will be finalized prior to unblinding of clinical trial subjects. Any subject requiring additional rescue medication may 
again receive ibuprofen 200 mg and their data will be similarly censored and 
imputed. Pain scores and safety data will continue to be collected for  the 24-
hour observation period. Rescue medication will not exceed ibuprofen 200 
mg q3h or 2400 mg in a 24-hour period.

10.2.3. Post-Operative Assessments  
The time points of the post- baseline efficacy assessments are detailed in Section  [ADDRESS_1003963] at the initiation of Dose 1. Pain Intensity Numerical 
Pain Rating Scale (PI-NPRS ) and Pain Relief (PR) will be collected at 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.75, 
and 2.25 hours (± 5 minutes) and then collected at Hours 3.25, 4.25, 5.25, 6.25, 7.25, 8.25, 
9.25,10.25, 11.25 and 12.25 (± 5 minutes), then 14.25, 16.25, 18.25, 20.25, 22.25, and 24.25 (± 
10 minutes). 
Upon initiation of the  of Dose 1, two stopwatches will be started.  The patients will 
first be given stopwatch #1 and asked to press the stopwatch if and when they firs t perceive any 
relief (FPR). At this time, patients will be given the second stopwatch and asked to press this 
stopwatch if and when the pain relief becomes meaningful to them (MPR). If a patient requires 
a rescue analgesic after Dose 1, the time of rescue as well as PI -NPRS and PR will be collected 
at that time and collection of stopwatch data will cease.  
 
• Prior to initiation of Dose 1, the Baseline Pain scores on the 4-point categorical pain 
intensity scale and PI -NPRS will be recorded on the CRF.

 Page 45 of 65  10.6. Concomitant Med ication  
No other medications expected to confound the evaluation of the study medication will be 
allowed during the study session. This includes, but is not limited to, the use of any systemic analgesics other than the prescribed rescue analgesic. All concomitant medications used during 
the study will be recorded in the CRF. It is permissible at any time after the surgical procedure for 
a single dose of 4 -8 mg ondansetron (Zofran
®) iv, by [CONTACT_734784] a 
patient experiences nausea.  
10.7. Rescue Analgesic  
Rescue medication will consist of one ibuprofen [ADDRESS_1003964] 4 ounces 
of water. Prior to each dose of rescue medication, 11-Point Pain Intensity (via 0- 10 Numerical 
Rating Scale)  and Pain Relief (via 5 -Point Categorical Pain Relief Assessment) measurements 
will be performed . For statistical purposes, pain assessments performed after any  dose of rescue 
will be censored and imputed. The method of imputation will be described in the SAP, which wi ll 
be finalized prior to unblinding of clinical trial subjects.  Any subject requiring additional rescue 
medication may again receive ibuprofen 200  mg and their data will be similarly censored  and 
imputed. Pain scores and safety data will continue to be col lected  for  the 24 -hour observation 
period. Rescue medication will not exceed ibuprofen 200 mg q3h or 2400 mg in a 24- hour period.  
10.8. Study Participant Discontinuation  
A patient  will be considered discontinued from the study at any time under the following 
circumstances : 
1. Any patient  who violates any condition of the entrance criteria after having been entered 
into the study; 
2. Any patient  who develops a confounding concomitant illness (as determined by [CONTACT_4677], research coordinator or Principal Investigator), serious adverse event, or a hypersensitivity to the study medication; 
3. Any patient  who becomes uncooperative, does not adhere to the requirements of the 
study protocol, or refuses to complete the study; 
4. Any patient  who requires any concomitant medication during the course of the study 
that could confound the study results. 
If necessary, additional study medications will be provided to the study site for additional patient s. A representative of the Sponsor or the Data Management Group will provide the 
additional number (s) to the study site.  
All discontinued patient s will record no further assessments after their time of discontinuation, 
and any recorded efficacy data will be included in the Evaluable Population. All patient s taking 
study medications with follow -up safety data will be included in the safety analysis. Details of

11. SAFETY 
11.1. Patient  Examinations  
To ensure the safety and well -being of each patient  entered into the study, the patient  must first 
be examined by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_54720] -Investigator and medically cleared to participate 
as required by [CONTACT_760]. Each patient  will be observe d for adverse events (AEs) and will be 
required to report any adverse events that develop during the course of the study and for [ADDRESS_1003965]- drug treatment. If at any time during the study, the patient  has a serious adverse event 
(SAE) or abnormality, the  patient  must be withdrawn from the study and appropriate care 
should be initiated. 
11.2. Patient  Safety Information  
In accordance with the US regulatory requirements regarding informed consent (21 CFR Part 50, Protection of Human Patients), the patient  will rec eive a copy of the informed consent form 
(ICF) when discharged from the clinic. The ICF will include the information needed to contact 
[CONTACT_079], along with a description of the study medications the patient  may 
have received.  
11.3. Availability of Investigator  
Either the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_734741]/or appropriate designee will be listed on the informed consent form. 
11.4. Adverse Events  
11.4.1. Definitions  
Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) will be defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient  after the 
informed consent is signed. The adverse event does not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with the study medication. An AE can therefore be an unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, which is a change from baselin e and is temporally associated with the use of the study medication, whether or not it is 
considered related to the study medication. 
Severity

  Acetaminophen Dental Study  
 
 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information  
 Page 47 of 65  The following definitions will be used for grading severity of adverse events: 
Mild - Either asymptomatic or patient is aware of the sign, symptom or event, but it is easily 
tolerated.  
Moderate - Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity and may warrant 
intervention. 
Severe - Incapacitating with inability to do usual activities.  
Causal Assessment  
The causal relationship between an AE and the study medication will be determined by [CONTACT_1268] [INVESTIGATOR_322947]: 
• Associated: There is a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been caused by [CONTACT_734785]. This definition applies to those AEs that are considered definitely, probably, and possibly related to the use of the study medication. 
a. Definitely Related: An AE that:  
− follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration o f the study 
medication;  
− follows a known response pattern to the study medication;  
− and, when appropriate to the protocol, is confirmed by [CONTACT_318207][INVESTIGATOR_219788] (positive de- challenge) and by [CONTACT_734786] (positive re- challenge);  
− and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_8129] ’s 
clinical state or by [CONTACT_43593][INVESTIGATOR_014];  
b. Probably Related: An AE that:  
− follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study 
medication;  
− follows a known response pattern to the study medication;  
− and, when appropriate to the protocol, is confirmed by [CONTACT_323008]-challenge;  
− and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_11564] ’s 
clinical state  or by [CONTACT_43593][INVESTIGATOR_014]; 
c. Possibly Related: An AE that: follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study medication and follows a known response pattern to the study medication but could have been produced by [CONTACT_102] ’s clinical sta te or by 
[CONTACT_43593][INVESTIGATOR_014].

 Page 48 of 65  • Not Associated:  
d. Unlikely: An AE that does not follow a reasonable temporal relationship after 
administration of the study medication or could have been produced by [CONTACT_102] ’s 
clinical state or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014];  
e. Not related: An AE for which sufficient information exists to indicate that the etiology  
is unrelated to the study medication. Two or more of the following variables apply; 
− The AE does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence after administration of 
the study medication; 
− The AE is readily explained by [CONTACT_102] ’s clinical state or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; 
− Negative de -challenge—the AE does not abate upon dose reduction or cessation 
of therapy (assuming that it is reasonable to expect abatement of the AE within the observed interval). 
Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adver se event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that occurs at any dose and:  
• Results in death; 
• Is life threatening;  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1324];  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• Is a medically important condition: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, the event(s) may jeopardize the patient  
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
11.4.2. Reporting Adverse Events  
Any SAE, regardless of causal relationship, must be reported immediately to the CRO Medical 
Monitor no later than 24- hours after awareness of the SAE. Initial SAE reports may be made by

 Confidential and Proprietary Information  
 Page 50 of 65  For SAEs, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1318] p rovide all documentation pertaining to the event ( e.g. 
additional laboratory tests, consultation reports, discharge summaries, postmortem reports, etc.) 
to the CRO Medical Monitor in a timely manner. Reports relative to the patient’s course must 
be submitted to the CRO Medical Monitor until the event has subsided or, in the case or 
permanent impairment, until the condition stabilizes.  
Information about all adverse events, serious and non-serious, including the event’s severity, start and stop times/dates, c hronicity, relatedness to study medication, and any actions taken, 
must be recorded on the appropriate CRFs. The information recorded will be based on the signs 
and symptoms detected during the physical examination and clinical evaluation of the patient  as 
well as information recorded in the patient’s diary, when applicable. 
11.4.5. Breaking the Blind  
A set of tamper -proof sealed individual envelopes containing the medication code inside the 
envelope, will be sent to the investigative site. In the event of a medica l emergency that 
necessitates breaking the code, the sealed envelope containing the medication code may be 
opened. The seal will only be broken by [CONTACT_734787]’s double-blind investigational product will have 
a direct impact on treatment decisions. Every effort will be made to discuss the decision to break the blind with the CRO Medical Monitor in advance.  
When the blind is broken, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_734743]. The event will also be recorded on the CRF and in the source document. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_879] a written explanation to the CRO Medical Monitor  d escribing the event within 5 business days.  
11.4.6. Discontinuation of Study due to an SAE  
The study will be discontinued for safety reasons if a serious adverse event occurs in more than one patient  unless it is demonstrated that the serious adverse event is not related (as defined in 
Section  11.4.1 of this protocol) to study medication, in which case the study will not be required 
to stop. 
The IRB will be notified within 24 hours of any event that results in an SAE or in 
discontinuation of the study.  
12. STATISTICAL METHODS AND DATA HANDLING 
All computa tions will be performed using SAS® version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Since 
this is a proof-of- concept study, statistically significant treatment differences will be declared if 
p ≤ 0.10 (one -sided), and no adjustments for multiple comparisons/end points will be 
performed.  All confidence intervals will be one-sided 90% confidence intervals.   
The between -treatment comparisons that will be performed are: 

Nevakar, Inc.   
CONFIDENTIAL   Protocol CP -NVK009 -0002  (3) 15April [ADDRESS_1003966] will be considered censored at 24 hours. 
For the other time to event analyses (FPR-C, MPR) if a subject does not record 
perceptible/meaningful pain relief and prematurely discontinues from the study prior to [ADDRESS_1003967] perceptible/meaningful pain relief prior to taking rescue medication, the subject will again be censored at 24 hours.   
12.5. Statistical Methods for Efficacy Evaluations  
The efficacy analyses will be based on the Evaluable  Population.  
The efficacy assessments are:  
• Numerical Pain Rating Scale Pain Intensity: (PI -NPRS) 
(0 = no pain and 10 = worst imaginable pain) 
• Pain Relief   (5-Point Categorical Pain Relief Assessment) 
• Stopw atches:  First Perceptible Relief and Meaningful Relief  
(FPR= First Perceptible Relief -, MPR = Meaningful Pain Relief and FPR -C = FPR 
that is confirmed  by [CONTACT_559775])  
• Patient Global Evaluation (PGE):  
Poor (0) Fair (1)  Good (2)  Very Good (3)  Excellent (4)

The Impaction Difficulty Rating Score (IDRS) will be used to assess the projected surgical 
trauma for each impacted mandibular third molar. The oral surgeon wi ll base the difficulty 
assessment on the radiographic appearance and the intraoral examination. Each mandibular molar will be rated from 1 to 5 using the following  criteria:  
1= Erupted in tissue 
2= Soft tissue impaction  
3= Mild partial bony impaction  
(>30% erupted through the alveolar bone),  
4= Moderate to severe partial bony  
(at least 70% impacted in the alveolar bone)  
5= Full bony impaction  
(no penetration of the bone into the soft tissue).  
Only patients whose mandi bular impactions are scored a “4” or “5” will be eligible to 
participate in the study. In addition, if during the surgical procedure extreme trauma or 
surgical complications arise, then that patient will not be continued in the study.

Time to perceptible pain relief and time to meaningful pain relief will be collected using the double -
stopwatch methodology as follows: For each randomized subject, two stopwatches will be started 
immediately upon initiation of the first study dose  The first stopwatch will be given to each subject with the instructions to stop the watch when they f irst perceive pain relief to occur (time to 
perceptible relief). Once the first stopwatch is stopped, the second stopwatch will be given to the 
subject with the instruction to stop the watch when they are first experiencing meaningful pain 
relief (time to meaningful relief). Time to perceptible pain relief is confirmed only if the subject experiences meaningful relief.  
If a subject requires a rescue analgesic after Dose 1, the time of rescue as well as PI [INVESTIGATOR_734755] d collection of stopwatch data will cease.

 Methodology: 
This will be a randomized, double-blind, single-site, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study 
to assess similarities in safety, tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of  of 
 acetaminophen given in three doses, each 8 hours apart, relative to placebo, and 
 of  acetaminophen given in four doses, each 6 hours apart, relative to 
placebo over a 24-hour period in patients experiencing moderate to severe postsurgical pain 
within 7 hours following surgical removal of 2 or more molars.  
To maintain the double-blind conditions, patients will be receiving either a placebo (  
 that looks like study drug) or the active study medication every 2 hours (+ 10 minutes) 
 over the first 18 hours after Dose 1.  
Patients who meet the randomization criteria (post-surgical pain of moderate to severe on the 
4-point Categorical Pain Intensity scale, and at least a score of 5 on the 11-point [0-10] pain 
intensity numerical pain rating scale [PI-NPRS] at baseline within [ADDRESS_1003976] stitch from 
dental extractions) will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups.  
Approximately 110 patients will be randomized to receive either  APAP  three 
doses, each in  of total volume, 8 hours apart OR  APAP  four doses, each in  of total volume, 6 hours apart OR placebo,  total volume of normal  in 
a 2:2:1 allocation ratio. No less than approximately 30% of randomized patients will be either 
male or female.  In addition, no more than approximately 30% of patients will be 17 years of 
age at the time of screening. 
Number of Subjects (planned and analyzed): 
110 (44 subjects per active group and 22 subjects in the placebo group) 
Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion: 
Male and female patients between 17-[ADDRESS_1003977] not result in a trauma rating of severe on 
the 4-point scale of mild, moderate, moderately severe, or severe:  
Two full bony impactions  
 
 
Patients must have body weight of >[ADDRESS_1003978] meet the randomization criteria (post-surgical pain of 
moderate to severe on the 4-point Categorical Pain Intensity scale, and at least a score of 5 on the 11-
point [0-10] pain intensity numerical pain rating scale [PI[CONTACT_88962]] at baseline within [ADDRESS_1003979]

 This SAP was developed in accordance with ICH E9 guideline. All decisions regarding final 
analysis, as defined in this SAP document, will be made prior to Database Freeze / unblinding of 
the study data. Further information can be found in the protocol. 
The SAP is based on Protocol No. CP-NVK009-0002, Amendment 3, dated April 15, 2019 and 
ICH guidelines E4 and E9 (Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials)  
The purpose of this document is to provide details on study populations and on how the variables 
will be derived, how missing data will be handled as well as details on statistical methods to be 
used to analyze the safety and efficacy data for Study Protocol No. CP-NVK009-0002. 
The document may evolve over time, for example, to reflect the requirements of protocol 
amendments or regulatory requests.  However, the final SAP must be finalized, approved by [CONTACT_429], and placed on file before database is locked.  Deviations from the final approved plan 
will be noted in the CSR.

 4. STUDY DESIGN 
4.1. Summary of Study Design 
This will be a randomized, double-blind, single-site, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to 
assess similarities in safety, tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of  of  
acetaminophen given in three doses, each 8 hours apart, relative to placebo, and  of 
 acetaminophen given in four doses, each 6 hours apart, relative to placebo over a 24-
hour period in patients experiencing moderate to severe postsurgical pain within 7 hours 
following surgical removal of 2 or more  molars.  
To maintain the double-blind conditions, patients will be receiving either a placebo (  
that looks like study drug) or the active study medication every 2 hours (± 10 minutes) (infused 
 over the first 18 hours after Dose 1.  
Patients who meet the randomization criteria (post-surgical pain of moderate to severe on the 4-
point Categorical Pain Intensity scale, and at least a score of 5 on the 11-point [0-10] pain 
intensity numerical pain rating scale [PI-NPRS] at baseline within [ADDRESS_1003988] stitch from 
dental extractions) will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups.  
Approximately 110 patients will be randomized to receive either  APAP  three doses, 
each in  of total volume, 8 hours apart OR  APAP  four doses, each in  of total volume, 6 hours apart OR placebo,  total volume of normal  in a 2:2:1 
allocation ratio. No less than approximately 30% of randomized patients will be either male or 
female.  In addition, no more than approximately 30% of patients will be [ADDRESS_1003989] experience with the Dental Impaction Pain Model 
(DIPM) and analysis of the results from a previous Phase 2 study comparing the safety and 
efficacy of  APAP in combination with  pregabalin (Nevakar Protocol CP-NVK-009-
0001). SPID 24 data for  APAP in that study suggested that a sample size of 44 patients per 
active group and 22 patients in the placebo group should be adequate to evaluate similarities 
between the two active dose regimens vs placebo.

 4.3.2.  Sample Size Re-estimation 
Sample size re-estimation is not planned for the study. 
4.4. Randomization 
Treatment assignments will be determined by a computer-generated randomization schedule 
created by [CONTACT_514269].  
The non-stratified randomization schedule with block size of 5 will randomly assign one of the 
three treatments to the patients. The randomization numbers will be assigned to each patient in a 
sequential order as they qualify. The randomization number assigned to the patient will be 
recorded in the Case Report Form (eCRF). 
4.5. Clinical Assessments 
4.5.1.  Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic variables include age, sex, race, and ethnicity. Baseline characteristics include 
height (cm), weight (kg), and body mass index (BMI; kg/m2). These are obtained at the screening 
visit. Prior to initiation of Dose 1, baseline pain scores on the 4-point categorical pain intensity 
scale and PI-NPRS are also assessed. 
4.5.2.  Medical/Surgical History 
Medical and Surgical history, as collected at screening and prior to surgery, will be coded using 
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 22.0 to determine system 
organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT).  
4.5.3.  Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination including all major body systems will be performed at the 
Screening visit.  Abnormal or clinically significant physical exam findings will be recorded as 
AEs.  
4.5.4.  Vital Signs 
Vital signs results including blood pressure (systolic and diastolic; mmHg), heart rate (beats per 
minute), respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487] (breaths/min), and temperature in supi[INVESTIGATOR_734756], prior to surgery, and at Hours 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 following T0 (±10 
min).  
Baseline for vital signs measurements will be defined as the last evaluation before dosing with 
study medication.  
4.5.5.  Urine drug screen 
Urine drug test is performed at Screening and Day [ADDRESS_1003990] moderate pain on the 4-point categorical pain intensity scale of none (0), mild (1), moderate 
-10 PI-NPRS. This will be the baseline assessment 
for the 4-Point Categorical PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238] 11-point PI-NPRS. 
4.5.8.  11-Point Pain Intensity (PI-NPRS)  
Follow-up pain intensity (PI) measurements will be taken at the following times after initiation 
of Dose 1 (T0):  0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.75, 2.25, 3.25, 4.25, 5.25,  6.25, 7.25, 8.25, 9.25, 10.25, 
11.25 and 12.25 Hours (±5 min), then at 14.25, 16.25, 18.25, 20.25, 22.25 and 24.25 Hours (±10 
min). 
4.5.9.  Pain Relief (PR)  
Pain Relief (PR) will be measured using a 5-point categorical scale (0=No Pain Relief, 1=A 
Little Pain Relief, 2=Some Pain Relief, 3=A Lot of Pain Relief, 4=Complete Pain Relief) 
4.5.10.  Perceptible & Meaningful Stopwatches 1 & [ADDRESS_1003991] 
be given stopwatch #[ADDRESS_1003992] perceive any pain 
relief (FPR). At this time, patients will be given the second stopwatch and asked to press this 
stopwatch if and when the pain relief becomes meaningful to them (MPR).  
If a patient requires a rescue analgesic after Dose 1, the time of rescue as well as PI-NPRS and 
PR will be collected at that time and collection of stopwatch data will cease. The stopwatches 
will be stopped at 24 hours, if not prior. 
4.5.11.  Patient Global Evaluation 
Patient Global Evaluation (PGE) is assessed on a scale of 0 (Poor), 1 (Fair), 2 (Good), 3(Very 
Good) and 4 (Excellent) at 24.[ADDRESS_1003993]-Dose 1 or at patient withdrawal (if applicable), 
whichever occurs first. 
4.5.12.  Pregnancy test for females 
Serum pregnancy tests (for female subjects of childbearing potential) are performed at 
Screening, and urine pregnancy tests (dipstick) are performed pre-surgery.   

Nevakar, Inc.   CP-NVK009-[ADDRESS_1003994] for HIV antibody, 
hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV) will be done at 
Screening only. 
4.5.14.  Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Medications expected to confound the evaluation of the study medication are not allowed during 
the study session. This includes, but is not limited to, the use of any systemic analgesics other 
than the prescribed rescue analgesic. It is permissible at any time after the Day 1 pre-surgery for 
a single dose of 4-8 mg ondansetron (Zofran®) iv, by [CONTACT_734784] a 
patient experiences nausea, 
Prior medications/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_734757]. 
Any medication/therapy that stops at or after this time or is ongoing at the time of 
discontinuation/completion is considered concomitant medication/therapy. Prior and concomitant 
medications will be collected at Screening through day of discharge and follow-up telephone 
call. Prior and concomitant medications will be coded using World Health Organization Drug 
Dictionary Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (WHO/ATC) classification index version 
September 1, 2015.  
4.5.15.  Rescue Medication 
Rescue medication will consist of one ibuprofen [ADDRESS_1003995] 4 ounces 
of water. Prior to each dose of rescue medication, 11-Point Pain Intensity (via 0-10 Numerical 
Rating Scale) and Pain Relief (via 5-Point Categorical Pain Relief Assessment) measurements 
will be performed. For statistical purposes, pain assessments performed after any dose of rescue 
will be censored and imputed for [ADDRESS_1003996] requiring additional rescue medication 
may again receive ibuprofen 200 mg and their data will be similarly censored and imputed. Pain 
scores and safety data will continue to be collected for the 24-hour observation period. Rescue 
medication will not exceed ibuprofen 200 mg q3h or 2400 mg in a 24-hour period.

 6. GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR DATA ANALYSES AND 
HANDLING 
This section discusses general policies to be employed in the analysis and reporting of the data 
from the study. Departures from these general policies may be provided in the specific detailed 
sections of this SAP. When this situation occurs, the rules set forth in the specific section take 
precedence over the general policies. 
Since this is a proof-of-concept study, 
0.10 (one-sided), and no adjustments for multiple comparisons/end points will be performed.  All 
confidence intervals will be one-sided 90% confidence intervals. 
The following conventions will be used in the study analysis as needed for intermediate 
calculations: 
Time 0 (T0) is the time of initiation of study drug administration. 
Assessment visit times are defined relative to T0. 
Duration of an AE will be computed in days for AEs lasting longer than 24 hours, and as 
hours for AEs lasting less than 24 hours.  Duration in hours will be calculated as the stop 
date/time of the event minus the start date/time.  Duration in days will be calculated by 
[CONTACT_734798] +[ADDRESS_1003998] Data Listing 
Considerations 
Summary tables and listings (e.g., post-text tables and individual subject data listings are 
indicate as a minimum:
1. Date of data extraction.
2. Date of output generation.
3. SAS program name, including the path that generates the output.
4. Any other output specific details that require further elaboration.
Post-text tables also include reference(s) to the subject data listing(s) that supports the summary 
data.  The data extraction date links the output to the archived database that is locked to ensure 
the replication of the results.
Nevakar, Inc.   CP-NVK009-[ADDRESS_1003999] line of the 
title will provide the analysis group being summarized (e.g., Evaluable Subjects or Safety 
Subjects).  If possible, the units of measurement for data contained in the table will appear in 
parentheses to conserve space in the body of the table and must be specified for all appropriate 
data. 
Variables being summarized and statistics being reported will appear in the left most column of 
the table.  The next columns for treatment groups will report the data from left to right for the 
investigational drugs, placebo, and (where appropriate) all treated subjects, respectively 
Listings will be sorted and presented by [CONTACT_1570], and subject number.  All tables and 
listings will have explanatory notes that give data extraction date, output generation date, 
complete program name [CONTACT_734822]. 
6.3. Data Management 
All computations will be performed using SAS® version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). For final 
tables, listings, and figures (TLFs), the domain (Study data tabulation Model [SDTM]) and 
analysis (Analysis Data Model [ADaM]) data sets will be taken as input to the SAS programs 
that generate the report ready TLFs. The submission ready SDTM and ADaM data sets will be 
provided to the sponsor along with display deliveries.  
6.4. Data Presentation Conventions 
Since this is a proof-of-concept study, statistically significant between-treatment differences will 
be declared if -sided), and no adjustments for multiple comparisons/end points will 
be performed.  All confidence intervals will be one-sided 90% confidence intervals.   
The following two between-treatment comparisons will be performed: 
 APAP  q8h versus Placebo 
 APAP  q6h versus Placebo 
All continuous study assessments will be summarized by [CONTACT_11571] (as 
applicable) using the descriptive statistics n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum. All 
categorical study assessments will be summarized by [CONTACT_11571] (as 
applicable) using frequency counts and rates of occurrence (%). Changes from baseline for 
continuous outcomes will be presented as their corresponding continuous measures for post-
baseline visits if applicable. Only results from scheduled visit will be used in analysis. For 
continuous variable, if multiple measurements were done at the same visit, the last one will be 
used. All study data will be listed by [CONTACT_1570], subject, and time point (as applicable).

 No preliminary rounding will be performed; rounding will only occur after the analysis. To 
then round up. Means and medians will be presented with one more decimal place than the 
precision of the data. Standard deviations will be presented with two more decimal places than 
the precision of the data. Percentages will be presented with one decimal place. A percentage of 
100% will be reported as 100%. Minimums and maximums will be presented with the same 
precision as the original data.  
Date variables will be formatted as DDMMMYYYY for presentation. Time will be formatted in 
military time as HH:MM for presentation. 
The table and listing shells and table of contents as part of this SAP provide the expected layout 
and titles of the TLFs. Any changes to format, layout, titles, numbering, or any other minor 
deviation will not necessitate a revision to the SAP nor will it be considered a deviation from 
planned analyses. Only true differences in the analysis methods or data handling will necessitate 
such documentation. The appropriate listings supporting the tables will be included and are not 
specified in the individual sections throughout the document.  
6.5. Analysis Populations  
6.5.1.  Safety Population 
The Safety Population will include all randomized patients who received the study medication. 
This population will be used for all safety summaries. 
6.5.2.  Evaluable Population 
The Evaluable Population will include all randomized patients who, as documented prior to the 
breaking of the study blind: (1) met all the inclusion and exclusion criteria and; (2) were 
administered Dose 1.  
The efficacy analyses will be performed using this population. 
6.5.3.  PK Evaluable Population 
The PK Evaluable Population will include all randomized subject who, as documented prior to 
the breaking of the study blind: (1) met all the inclusion and exclusion criteria and; (2) were

 6.7. Derived and Transformed Data 
6.7.1.  Baseline Age  
following formula: 
Age (year) = FLOOR((date of informed consent  date of birth)/365.25*12) 
where FLOOR( ) function returns the integer part of the result. 
6.7.2.  Study Day 
If the date of interest occurs on or after the first dose/randomization date, then study day will be 
calculated as (date of interest  date of first dose/randomization) + 1. If the date of interest occurs 
prior to the first dose/randomization date, then study day will be calculated as (date of interest  
date of first dose/randomization). There is no study day 0.  Duration of event in hours will be 
calculated as: [stop date/time of the event minus the start date/time] and displayed with one 
decimal (e.g., 6.1 hours). 
6.7.3.  Change from Baseline 
Change from baseline will be calculated as (post-baseline result  baseline result). If used, 
percent change from baseline will be calculated as (change from baseline/baseline result * 100). 
If either the baseline or the post-baseline result is missing, the change from baseline and/or 
percentage change from baseline is set to missing as well. 
6.7.4.  Visit Windows 
Summaries and data listings will be presented by [CONTACT_734799].  Unscheduled visit will be excluded from the 
summary tables but will be included in the listings.  As discussed in Section 6.4, if multiple visits 
or assessments occur within the same nominal timepoint, the latest will be used for 
analyses/presentations. The protocol-defined visits with the allowed visit windows are presented 
in Table 2.

 6.7.5.  Multiple Assessments and Uninterpretable values 
If duplicate values are obtained at a given visit (e.g., repeated vital sign measurements), the last 
value will be used unless it is noted that the measurement was in error for that value. Values that 
compromise interpretation will not be used in summaries (e.g., values that were obtained post-
dose will not be summarized as pre-dose values). 
6.8. Handling of Missing Data 
6.8.1.  Missing Efficacy Endpoints 
Prior to each dose of rescue medication, 11-Point Pain Intensity (via 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale) 
and Pain Relief (via 5-Point Categorical Pain Relief Assessment) measurements will be performed. 
For statistical purposes, pain assessments performed after any dose of rescue will be censored and 
imputed in the following manner. For subjects who take rescue medication, a windowed last pain 
score carried forward (wLOCF) will be used for all PI [INVESTIGATOR_734759]. The pre-rescue pain 
score will be used to impute scheduled assessments for 4hrs following the rescue use. Note: if a 
pre-rescue NRS assessment occurs at the same time as a scheduled NRS assessment, the 
scheduled assessment will be assumed to happen first, and then the pre-rescue NRS will be 
assumed to occur afterwards. If a scheduled NRS assessment occurs at the same time as the time 
of taking a rescue medication, the NRS assessment will be assumed to be a Pre-rescue 
medication result. For subjects who drop out of the study early, scheduled pain assessments will 
first be imputed using the worst prior pain score carried forward (WOCF). 
For time to treatment failure, if a subject does not qualify for treatment failure, but prematurely 
discontinues from the study before [ADDRESS_1004001] will be considered censored at 24 hours. 
For the other time to event analyses (FPR-C, MPR) if a subject does not record 
perceptible/meaningful pain relief and prematurely discontinues from the study prior to [ADDRESS_1004002] perceptible/meaningful 
pain relief prior to taking rescue medication, the subject will again be censored at 24 hours. 
Imputation of non-numerical values reported in the plasma PK data set for acetaminophen will 
be dealt with, in both PK parameter calculation and calculation of descriptive statistics of the 
concentration data, as follows:    Day 1 pre dose sample times will be set equal to zero; 
 Values that are below the limit of quantification (BLQ) obtained prior to the first 
quantifiable concentration post-dose administration will be set equal to zero; 
 Values that are BLQ after the first quantifiable concentration post dose administration will 
be treated as missing for the calculation of PK parameters  
 Concentrations that are treated as missing (non-numerical values) will be ignored in the 
calculation of descriptive statistics for serum concentrations. 
No other missing data will be imputed.

 6.8.2.  Missing Start and Stop Dates for Adverse Events 
If a Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAE) is reported as ongoing at the time of database lock, the AE 
will be shown as ongoing in listings, and the stop date will be imputed for calculations as the 
date of the last visit or the last date of any event for the subject in the database, whichever is 
later. 
If a TEAE is considered resolved, but the stop date is missing, the last day of the month will be 
imputed if the month and year are available. If only the year is available, and the year is the same 
as the year of the last visit, the stop date will be the latest of the last visit date or latest event for 
the subject in the database. 
If the year of the event is prior to the year of the last treatment, the end day and month will be set 
to 31 December. 
For missing or partial start and stop dates/times, the most conservative imputation will be used 
(AEs will be assumed to be temporally related to the study medication). The original incomplete 
or missing dates will be presented in the listings, not the imputed dates. Table 4 will be used to 
impute any missing dates/times:

7.2. Protocol Deviations 
Deviations are categorized as informed consent procedures, inclusion/exclusion criteria, study 
medication, prohibited medications, study procedures, study drug assignment/treatment, visit or 
assessment time window, missed visit or assessment and/or other. All protocol deviations will be 
captured on case report forms (CRFs) and/or documented in site-specific logs throughout the 
study. Deviations will be categorized and classified as major or minor by [CONTACT_734801]. 
Subjects with protocol deviations, both minor and major, will be presented in a data listing and 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_734802]/minor classification for all randomized 
subjects. 
7.3. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_734803]. 
7.4. Listing of Subject Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 
Listing showing subject inclusion/exclusion status (inclusion criteria not met and exclusion 
criteria met) will be provided.

8.2. Subgroup Analyses 
Time Weighted Sum of Pain Intensity Difference from 0 to 24 hours (SPID24) and Time 
Weighted Sum of Pain Relief from 0 to 24 hours (TOTPAR24) will be analyzed by [CONTACT_551] 
(<median, >=median) and by [CONTACT_4321], using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with 
treatment group as a fixed effect and baseline pain intensity PI-NPRS as a covariate.  Descriptive 
summaries, including least square means (lsmeans) and standard errors for each treatment group 
and confidence intervals will be presented. 
8.3. Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity 
No adjustments for multiple comparisons/end points will be performed.  
8.4. Analysis of the Efficacy Endpoints 
8.4.1.  Time Weighted Sum of Pain Intensity Difference from 0 to 24 hours (SPID24) 
Pain intensity (PI) is collected at various scheduled timepoints and also prior to each use of 
rescue medication.  SPID is calculated as (i) T(i-1)] x (PID(i-1) + PID(i))/2, where T(0)=0, 
T(i) is the scheduled time, and PID(i) is the pain intensity difference (PID) score at time i.   At 
any timepoint, SPID will include all assessments from T0 to the nominal time point. Thus, 
SPID24 will include all nominal timepoints from T0 to T24.25. The last PI [INVESTIGATOR_734761]-specified time points for measurement of pain intensity through 4 hours after the time of 
the dosing of the rescue medication (wLOCF).  If a pre-rescue PI [INVESTIGATOR_734762] a scheduled assessment, the schedule PI [INVESTIGATOR_734763], and then the 
pre-rescue PI [INVESTIGATOR_734764]. If a PI [INVESTIGATOR_734765] a rescue medication, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_734766] a Pre-rescue medication result. If the PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_734767] (end of imputation 
period), then PI [INVESTIGATOR_734768] [ADDRESS_1004005] (WOCF). 
For calculations of SPID24, the actual dates/times of assessments will be used in calculations. 
While the PI [INVESTIGATOR_734769]-defined protocol scheduled time 
points, it is recognized that operationally the scores are collected as close to the target times as 
possible but there is some flexibility in terms of the actual times the scores are collected. Thus, to 
account for this inherent aspect of data collection, the ACTUAL TIMES will be used for the

 calculation of SPID24. The actual times will be based relative to the time of completion of study 
drug administration. 
This will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment group as 
a fixed effect and baseline PI-NPRS as a covariate. Descriptive summaries including least square 
means and standard errors for each treatment group, confidence intervals, and p-values will be 
presented. 
8.4.2.  Time Weighted Sum of Pain Relief from 0 to 24 hours (TOTPAR24) 
Pain Relief Rating (PR) is scored on a 5-point scale (0=no-, 1= a little-, 2= some-, 3= a lot of-, 
and 4=complete- PR) at each observation time after Dose 1 administration, TOTPAR24 is 
derived similarly as SPID24 above, with pain relief at time i (PR(i)) replacing PID(i) in the 
formula. 
This will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment group as 
a fixed effect and baseline PI-NPRS as a covariate. Descriptive summaries including least square 
means and standard errors for each treatment group, confidence intervals, and p-values will be 
presented. 
8.4.3.  Time to Perceptible Pain Relief Confirmed (FPR-C) and Cumulative % of 
patients with onset of First Perceptible Relief Confirmed after Dose [ADDRESS_1004006]; the log rank test may be stratified by [CONTACT_734804] (moderate / severe) if there are sufficient subjects in each 
stratum.  Number of subjects in the population (N), number of subjects with FPR-C event, 
number of subjects censored, median time to FPR-C, and p-values from log-rank test will be 
displayed in a summary table. 
In addition, the cumulative percent of subjects achieving perceptible pain relief confirmed after 
Dose [ADDRESS_1004007] will be censored at 24 
hours.  
8.4.4.  Time to Meaningful Pain Relief (MPR) and Cumulative % of patients with onset 
of Meaningful Pain Relief after Dose [ADDRESS_1004008]; the log rank test may be stratified by [CONTACT_734804] (moderate / severe).  Number of subjects in the population (N), 
number of subjects with MPR event, number of subjects censored, median time to MPR, and p-
values from stratified log-rank test will be displayed in a summary table. 
In addition, the cumulative percent of subjects achieving meaningful pain relief after Dose [ADDRESS_1004009] will also be censored 
at 24 hours. 
8.4.5.  Cumulative proportion of patients with pain half gone over time 
percent PID, defined as PPID(i) =(PID(i) / PI(T0) *100, at that assessment time point is less than 
50%.  
The endpoint will be analyzed using a Kaplan Meier approach to summarize time to first 
occurrence of 50% improvement.  This will count a subject as an event when they first hit 50% 
pain half gone.  If a subject does not record 50% improvement and prematurely discontinues 
from the study prior to [ADDRESS_1004010] 50% improvement prior to taking rescue medication, the subject will be censored 
at 24 hours. 
Number of subjects in the population (N), number of subjects that achieve 50% improvement, 
number of subjects censored, median time to achieving 50% improvement, and p-values from 
stratified log-rank test will be displayed in a summary table. 
In addition, Kaplan-Meier curves will be presented by [CONTACT_1570]. 
8.4.6.  Patient Global Evaluation of the study medication 
The Patient Global Evaluation will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
model with treatment group as a fixed effect and baseline PI-NPRS as a covariate. Descriptive 
summaries including least square means and standard errors by [CONTACT_1570], confidence 
intervals, and p-values will be presented. 
8.4.7.  Pain Intensity Difference (PID) Rating at each observation time after Dose 1 
administration 
This will be summarized descriptively and plotted over time by [CONTACT_1570]. 
8.4.8.  Pain Intensity (PI) Ratings at each observation time after Dose 1 administration 
This will be summarized descriptively and plotted over time by [CONTACT_1570]. 
Compliance with recording NRS is calculated as the number of non-missing NRS scores divided 
by [CONTACT_734805]. NRS scores recorded prior to rescue medication use are 
excluded from the calculation.  Compliance with recording NRS will also be summarized 
descriptively by [CONTACT_1570]. 
8.4.9.  Pain Relief (PR) Ratings at each observation time after Dose 1 administration 
This will be summarized descriptively and plotted over time by [CONTACT_1570]. 
Compliance with recording PR is calculated as the number of non-missing PR scores divided by 
[CONTACT_734806]. PR scores recorded prior to rescue medication use are

 excluded from the calculation.  Compliance with recording PR will also be summarized 
descriptively by [CONTACT_1570]. 
8.4.10.  Time to treatment failure and Cumulative % of patients with treatment failure 
Time to treatment failure is defined in the protocol as the earlier of the time to first dose of 
rescue medication after Dose 1 or time to withdrawal from the study due to lack of efficacy (if 
prior to any rescue). Since withdrawal from the study due to lack of efficacy was not collected in 
the study, this SAP redefines Time to treatment failure as the earlier of the time to first dose of 
rescue medication after Dose [ADDRESS_1004011]; the log rank test may be stratified by [CONTACT_734804] (moderate / severe).  Number of subjects in the population (N), 
number of subjects with treatment failure, number of subjects censored, median time to treatment 
failure, and p-values from stratified log-rank test will be displayed in a summary table. 
In addition, the cumulative percent of subjects that fail treatment will be presented in Kaplan-
Meier curves by [CONTACT_1570]. 
If a subject does not take rescue medication or withdraw from the study prior to [ADDRESS_1004012] dose of treatment (T0). 
9.2. Adverse Event Preferred Term and Body/Organ System Summary 
Tables 
9.2.1.  Summaries of Adverse Event Incidence Rates for All Subjects 
For evaluation of causal relatedness to treatment, the categories are definitely related, probably 
related, possibly related, unlikely related, or not related. For categorization in the summary 
tables, AEs designated as definitely, probably, or possibly related will be considered related. 
For the evaluation of event severity terms, the criteria are mild, moderate, or severe. In addition 
to a listing of all AEs, treatment associated TEAEs, serious TEAEs, Deaths, and TEAEs leading 
to premature discontinuation from the study will be provided. 
An overall summary will be prepared giving for each treatment group and overall, both the 
number of TEAEs, and the number of subjects with at least one TEAEs.  SAEs, TEAEs 
associated with treatment and TEAEs leading to premature discontinuation from study will also 
be included in this overall summary.  
The number of subjects with AEs will be summarized for each treatment group and overall by 
[CONTACT_1196] (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT) sorted alphabetically by [CONTACT_2946], and then by 
[CONTACT_459062]. Separate tables will be presented for each of the following TEAE event sets: All events 
Treatment-related events 
Serious events 
Events leading to premature discontinuation from study 
Events by [CONTACT_734807] a given subject experiences a TEAE that maps to the same PT/SOC more than once, the 
subject will be counted only once for the SOC/PT at the greatest severity (i.e., mild, moderate, or 
severe) and causality (i.e., related). 
 
Duration of a TEAE lasting more than 24 hours will be computed in days as the stop date of the 
event minus the start date plus 1 and will be reported in days. TEAEs lasting less than 24 hours 
will be computed as stop date/time minus start date/time and reported in hours. If reported as 
ongoing at the time of database lock, the date used to calculate duration will be defined as the 
date/time of the last visit or the last date/time of any event for the subject in the database, 
whichever is later.

 10. PHAMACOKINETIC EVALUATION 
10.1. Pharmacokinetic Objectives  
The PK objectives/questions to be addressed in this study are as follows : 
1. Is the daily drug exposure from the  APAP  q6h dose like that from the  
APAP  q8h dose? 
2. Is there any change in the PK of acetaminophen in going from a single dose of  APAP 
 to a single dose of  APAP  ?  
3. Is there drug accumulation on multiple dosing with either regimen? If yes, how much? 
4. Do we achieve a steady state with either regimen? 
10.2. Pharmacokinetic Sample Analysis and Modeling Process  
Sampling for Pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments will be done following the schedule discussed 
in Section 4.5.17 (Pharmacokinetic (PK) Assessment). Samples will be sent to a  
who will measure the concentration of APAP in each sample and return those 
concentration results to the project team.   
Seventh Wave will use the concentration data to perform a Non-Compartmental Analysis (NCA) 
of the concentrations and produce PK parameters and a stand-alone PK report.  PK parameters to 
be used in evaluating the above objectives will be provided by [CONTACT_734810], to include:

10.3. Summary of Pharmacokinetic Concentrations 
 will receive the PK concentrations as provided by .  PK 
concentrations will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of non-missing and 
missing observations, arithmetic mean, geometric mean, standard deviation (SD), percent 
coefficient of variation (CV%), minimum , median, and maximum for each treatment group and 
nominal time point.  Figures of the PK concentrations over time for each subject and the mean 
concentration over time for each treatment group will be presented in both standard and log 
scale. 

Nevakar, Inc.   CP-NVK009-[ADDRESS_1004014]. All 
analyses that involve 
will be back-transformed.    PK parameters except Tmax will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics [N, Mean, SD, CV%, minimum, median, maximum, geometric mean (Geom Mean), 
and geometric CV% (Geom CV%)] for each treatment group, nominal time point and study day. 
Minimum, median and maximum will be presented for Tmax. 
All PK parameters will be summarized with the same number of significant figures as reported.  
In addition, the following statistical analysis will be performed to support each of the PK 
objectives.    
10.4.1.  Differences in Daily Drug Exposure by [CONTACT_734811] 1, AUC(0-24) after the  q8h will be compared with the 
AUC(0-24) after the  q6h using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with daily 
drug exposure (AUC(0-24)) as the dependent variable and treatment group as a fixed effect 
independent variable. The null hypothesis here is that there is no difference between the AUC(0-
24) of the two active treatment groups. 
Because the overall study is being performed at the 0.10 (one sided) confidence level, eighty 
percent (80%) confidence intervals, standard errors, lsmeans, and geometric mean ratios (GMR) 
will be presented. 
10.4.2.  Differences in Pharmacokinetics by [CONTACT_734812] 2 will be accomplished by [CONTACT_734813](0-
inf) of the two active treatment groups using an ANOVA model and summarized as described in 
section 10.4.1 above. The null hypothesis here is that there is no difference between the dose 
normalized AUC(0-inf) of the two active treatment groups. 
10.4.3.  Drug Accumulation by [CONTACT_734814] 3, the accumulation for each active treatment group will be evaluated 
to see if it is significantly different from 1.0.  
For the  q8h regimen, the null hypothesis that RA_Cmax_Dose 3 = [ADDRESS_1004015]. For the  q6h regimen RA_Cmax_Dose 4 will be tested under a 
similar hypothesis and analysis method. P-values will be presented and are considered significant 
if < 0.10 (one-sided). 
10.4.4.  Steady State by [CONTACT_734814] 4 (achievement of a steady state with either active treatment group), 
differences between absolute values of Cmax (last dose) and Cmax (previous Dose) will be 
compared for each subject for the last dose. T-test will be used to test the null hypotheses that 
these differences equal [ADDRESS_1004016] of the difference. For the  q6h regimen Cmax from Dose 4 will be 
similarly compared to Cmax from Dose 3.  P-values will be presented and are considered 
significant if < 0.10 (one sided).  Helmert contrasts may be performed if warranted.

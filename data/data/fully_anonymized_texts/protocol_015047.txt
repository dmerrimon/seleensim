Confidential  
 Study Duration of Treatment : 
Approxim ately 3 months  
Criteria for Evaluation : 
The primary endpoints are as follows:  
• Effectiveness : 
o Overall comfort averaged over all scheduled follow -up visits  
o Vision averaged over all scheduled follow -up visits  
o The pr oportion of eyes with a maximum degree of  front surface deposits grade of < 2 over all 
scheduled follow -up visits   
• Safety : 
o The
 proportion of eyes with any slit -lamp findings greater than Grade 2 over all follow -up visits  
Statistical Methods:  
• Continuous variables will be summarized using the sample size, mean, standard deviations, median, 
minimum , and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized using frequencies and 
percentages.  
• Each primary endpoint will be evaluated statistically using a one -sided non- inferiority test with a 
one-sided alp ha risk of 0.025. For overall comfort and dryness, each non- inferiority hypothesis will 
be tested using an analysis of variance model including the fixed factor s of treatment , site, and lens 
group with a non -inferiority margin of -5 points. For front surfa ce deposits, the non- inferiority 
hypothesis will be tested using a one -sided Newcombe- Wilson 97.5% lower confidence limit with a 
non-inferiority mar gin of -10%.  For slit- lamp findings, the non- inferiority hypothesis will be  tested 
using a one -sided New comb e-Wilson 97.5% upper confidence limit with a non- inferiority margin of 
5%. 
Sample Size Calculations : 
Approximately [ADDRESS_1195722]- level event will be 0.95 when 
the probability of an event is 0.1. When the sample size is 150  subjects in each treatment group, the 
overall power of the trial will be 95%. To allow for losses of up to 10%, approximately [ADDRESS_1195723] s 
(680 eyes) will be enrolled.

exception of an unmasked designee, will be masked (blinded) to the subject’s treatment group. An unmasked designee will be assigned at each site and will be responsible for all 
study materials accountability, including dispensation to and collection of study supplies 
from  subjects. Subjects are to be instructed not to discuss or show the dispensed study 
materials to the Investigator  or masked site staff during the study. The Investigator and all 
other study personnel will remain masked until database lock. The subjects will be randomized (1:1) to receive either the T est or Control solution using a Randomization and 
Trial Supply Management (RTSM) system.

purpose solution in sev eral primary endpoints. 
Approximately 340 subjects ( 680 eyes)  will be enrolled in this three-month multicenter, 
randomized, double- masked, parallel -group, bilateral  study at approximately 22 
investigative sites in the [LOCATION_002] (US) . Approximately one- half (50%) of the eligible 
subjects will be randomized to receive Bausch +  Lomb  investigational BL-3100- NBR03  
multi- purpose solution (Test), and approximat ely one-half (50%) of the eligible subjects 
will be randomized to receive renu® Advanced Formula mult i-purpose solution (Control). 
In addition, all subjects will be dispensed three new  pairs (including two back- up pairs)  of 
their habitual lenses at the beginning of the study for daily wear , and scheduled replacement 
lenses  at the 1 -Month and 2-Month Follow-up Visits. 
All subjects will be seen for a Screening/Dispensing Visit, at which the informed consent  
form (ICF),  including the  Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act (HIPAA) , will 
be obtained and eligibility will be assessed . If eligible, subjec ts will be dispensed three new  
pairs of their habitual lenses and a Study Kit containing a cleaning and disinfecting solution 
according to the subject’s  random ly assigned treatment .  Subjects may  also be dispensed a 
supply of Bausch + Lomb renu® Contact [CONTACT_858146] . Subjects must NOT us e ANY other cleaning and disinfecting solution or rewetting 
drops during the study.   
Subjects are to wear their study lenses on a daily wear bas is and  are to use the Test or 
Control m ulti-purpose solution and care regimen after removing the lenses each day. 
Subjects will return their worn lenses  to the unmasked designee  at each monthly follow-up 
visit and  will return their used and unused study solutions to the unmasked designee at the  
three- month follow -up visit ( or early study termination/suspension visit) for return to the

supply kit orders, shipments, receipts, and subject dispensation will be tracked in the RTSM system. The clinical supply label includes a unique kit number and a labeling and packaging batch number for material lot number traceability. 
4.6 Masking/Unmasking  
Study solutions will be provided in sealed opaque white boxes with Study Kit numbers 
preprinted on them.  
 
This is a double -masked study. The Investigator and Sponsor  or their representatives  
involved in the conduct of the study will be masked to the study cleaning and disinfecting 
solutions. These procedures are intended to reduce or eliminate bias that might  impact 
study outcomes and their interpretation. 
The randomization schedule will be created by [CONTACT_858156] . Personnel involved with any 
repackaging / relabeling  of clinical trial material will also be unmasked.  A C linical Mo nitor 
will become unmasked during product reconciliation, at the conclusion of each site’s 
participation in the study and prior to locking the database.  Unmasked designees at the site will manage dispens ing and return of study solutions, study contact [CONTACT_858157].  
Study solutions will be provided in sealed opaque white boxes with Study Kit numbers 
preprinted on them. Subjects are not to show or discuss the study the study solution 
appearance with the Investigator or site staff unless instr ucted to do so.  Subjects m ay 
discuss any questions they have with the unmasked designee at the site. 
 In the event that unmasking of a subject’s randomly assigned treatment is required, the 
Investigator (or other designee) is required to contact [CONTACT_858158].  The Medical Monitor will contact [CONTACT_858159].  Upon receipt of authorization from the Sponsor designee, the Medical Monitor will advise the Investigator (or other qualified  designee) to 
log into the RTSM system  and unmask the subject.  If the Medical Monitor cannot be 
contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], the Investigator (or other qualified designee) should then contact [CONTACT_858160] a subject.  In the event that th e Medical 
Monitor or Sponsor designee cannot be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] , and the Investigator (or other qualified 
designee) deems the unmasking emergent , the Investigator  may log into the RTSM  system 
without authorization and unmask the subjec t. Whether unmasking occurs  inadvertently or 
intentionally, the Inves tigator must notify the Medical Monitor or Sponsor designee  as soon 
as possible after unmasking. In addition, the Investigator must record the date, time, and reason for unmasking the study treatment in the source documentation.

 6.4 Treatment Compliance 
Treatment compliance will be assessed using lens wear parameter data.  
6.5 Protocol Deviations 
A deviation from the protocol is an unintended and/or unanticipated departure from the 
procedures and/or processes approved by [CONTACT_842400] .  It is a Sponsor expectation that Investigators will follow the protocol and 
procedures as written.  Th e Sponsor will not grant  protocol waivers for this study .  The 
Investigator may implement a deviation from the protocol to eliminate an immediate 
hazard to study subjects without prior IRB/EC approval.  As soon as possible after such an occurrence, the implemented deviation, as well as the reasons for it should be submitted to the IRB/EC for review and approval.  It should also be submitted to the Sponsor for 
agreement, and to the regulatory authorities, if required.   
In the event a protocol deviation occu rs, the date of and reason for deviations must be 
documented in all cases.  Significant or major protocol deviations impacting the rights or 
safety of the subject or the integrity of the study must be reported by [CONTACT_26492]/EC and Medical Monitor immediately.  Reporting of all other protocol deviations must 
adher e to the requirements of the governing IRB/EC. Unless the protocol deviations put 
the subject at  risk or the subject’s condition requires that they be discontinued from the 
study, s ubjects  may continue to participate until the end of the study. 
 Site Corre ctive Action P lans will be developed and completed as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_55688], Sponsor Designee (e.g., Contract Research Organization, CRO ) for sites or 
Investigator s who de viate from this protocol in a way that adversely affects  the rights, 
safety or well -being of the subject(s) and/or the quality or integrity of data. The  Site 
Corrective Action Plan will outline the deviation and the site’s corrective and/or  remedial 
action s. Decisions regarding critical deviations that merit Investigator di squalification and 
site closure will be made by [CONTACT_240373].  
7.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
7.1 Introduction to Adverse Event Definitions  
AEs, Serious AEs  (SAEs), Significant Non-Serious AEs, Non -Significant Non-Serious 
Adverse Events , Adverse Device Effects  and Anticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect s 
are defined in this section and in the Protocol’s Glossary.  
An AE is any  untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward 
clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users, or other persons, 
whether or not related to the investigational medical device , comparator, or the procedures 
involved. For users or other persons, this  definition is restricted to events not related to 
investigational me dical devices.  
7.1.1 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Definition s 
An AE that  (related or not related to the investigational test articles , comparator products  
or study procedures): 
o Led to death  
Study #914  - Protocol  
Date:[ADDRESS_1195773], that resulted in: 
‒ A life -threatening illness or injury; or 
‒ A permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function (e.g., 
blindness); or 
‒ Inpatient or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or 
‒ Medical or surg ical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or 
injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function 
o Led to fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect. 
Note: A planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a pre -existi ng condition, or a procedure 
required by [CONTACT_760], without serious deterioration in health, is not considered 
an SAE. 
Serious adverse events may include  but are not limited to  any hazardous, sight- threatening 
conditions occurring after exposure to the investigational test article  or control product  
including, but not limited to, the following: 
• A presumed infectious ulcer (defined as a progressive erosion of the corneal 
tissue). For the purposes of reporting, this includes: 
o Central or para- central locati on 
o Penetration of Bowman’s membrane 
o Infiltrate ≥ 2 mm diameter  
o Associated with iritis  
o Associated with any increase in intraocular pressure  
o Culture positive for microorganisms 
o Increasing size or severity at subsequent visits 
NOTE: Signs of a presumed infectious corneal ulcer may include irregular focal 
infiltrates, active lesions with raised edges, significant diffuse infiltration, anterior 
corneal to mid- stromal involvement, erosion with overlying staining, conjunctival 
and lid edema, anterior chamber reaction (iritis), and severe bulbar and limbal redness. Symptoms associated with a presumed infectious ulcer (microbial keratitis) may include pain of rapid onset, severe redness, purulent or 
mucopurulent discharge, tearing, and photophobia.
 
• Any central or par acentral (within the central 6 mm of cornea) corneal event that 
results in permanent opacification ( such as corneal scar or  vascularization)  
• Any serious adverse ophthalmic events including hypopyon and/or hyphema 
• Any neovascularization within the central 6 mm of the cornea  
• Permanent l oss of ≥2 lines of BSCVA  
• All cases of iritis.  
7.1.2 Significant Non- Serious Adverse Event  Definition s 
A significant non- serious adverse event is an AE that does not meet the serious criteria, is 
considered significant by [CONTACT_1034], and requires expedited repor ting to the S ponsor (see 
Section 7.2.1.) . These events include but are not limited to:

• A temporary loss of two or more lines of BSCVA (for greater than or equal to 2 
weeks)  
• Neovascularization cases Grade 2 or greater  (if not within 6 mm of the cornea) 
• Any ocular event that necessitates temporary lens discontinuation of greater than 
or equal to 2 weeks.  
7.1.3 Non-Significant Non- Serious Adverse Events Definition s 
A non- significant non- serious adverse event may include but are not limited to the 
following and does not require expedited reporting: 
• Bacterial Conjunctivitis;  
• Viral Conjunctivi tis; 
• Allergic Conjunctivitis;  
• Corneal Edema;  
• Contact [CONTACT_240375][INVESTIGATOR_19534]; and

7.1.[ADDRESS_1195774] (ADE) Definition s 
An adverse device effect (ADE) is an  AE that is  assessed to be related to the use of an 
investigational medical device. This definition includes AEs resulting from insufficient or inadequate instructions for use; deployment, implantation, installation, or operation; or any malfunction of the investigational medical device. This definition also  includes any e vent 
resulting from use error or from intentional misuse of the investigational medical device.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Anticipated Serious Adverse Device Effect  (ASADE)  Definition  
An a nticipated serious adverse device effect (ASADE) is an ADE that first meets the 
serious criteri a (see Section 7.1.1) and which , by [CONTACT_5942], incidence, severity or outcome, 
has been previously identified in the investigational plan or application (including a

event related to the use of  an investigational medical device that has resulted in any of the 
consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event as described in section  7.1.1 and 
Study #914  - Protocol

 which by [CONTACT_5942], incidence, severity or outcome has not been identified in the current 
version of the risk analysis report.  
This definition includes but is not limited to AE s resulting from insufficient or inadequate 
instructions for use, deployment, implantation, installation, or operation, or any 
malfunction of the investigational medical device.  
This definition also includes any event resulting from use error or from intentional misuse 
of the investigational medical device.  [LOCATION_003]DEs include but are not limited to : 
• Any central or paracentral (within 6 mm of cornea) corneal event that results in perm anent opacification (s uch as corneal scar or  vascularization)  
• Any serious adverse ophthalmic events including hypopyon and/or hyphema 
• Any neovascularization within the central 6 mm of the cornea 
• Permanent loss of ≥2 lines of BSCVA  
• All cases of iritis.  
7.1.5 Rela tionship Definition: Study Device and/or Other Study Materials  
• Related: There is at least a reason able possibility that the AE  is related to the 
study device  (study solution) and/or r ewetting drops . Reasonable possibility 
means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship or association between the study device and/or r ewetting drops and the AE.   
• Not related:  There is little or no reasonable possibility that the AE  is related 
to the study device  (study solution)  and/or r ewetting drops. This ass essment 
implies that the AE has no evidence to suggest either a causal relationship or association to the study device and/or r ewetting drops and a more likely or 
certain alternative etiology exists.  
7.1.6 Severity  Definitions  
• Mild:  Subject awareness of a sign or  symptom that is easily tolerated, 
requires no treatment, and does not interfere with subject’s daily activities.  
• Moderate:  Subject awareness of a sign or symptom which may be a low 
level of concern to the subject and may int erfere with daily activities bu t can 
be relieved by [CONTACT_119106].  
• Severe:  A sign or symptom that interrupts the subject’s daily activity and 
requires systemic therapy or other treatment 
7.[ADDRESS_1195775]’s 
end of participation in the study must be reported. All reportable AEs must be followed until the event resolves or stabilizes . This may imply that follow- up will continue after the 
subject has left the study, and that additional evaluations may be requested by [CONTACT_1034].

Confidential  
 Ocular AEs of possible clinical significance should be photo-documented and shared with 
the Medical Monitor in electronic form.  
When evaluating for reportable AEs, the Investigator should refer to the definitions for 
AEs to determine : 
a) whether the event is serious (refer to  Section 7.1.1 and 7.1.2.)  
b) whether the event is severe (refer to Section 7. 1.6.) 
c) whether the event is s ignificant (refer to Sections 7.1.2 and 7.1.3.) 
d) whether the event is related to the study device (refer to Section 7.1.5.) 
7.2.1 Procedures for Reporting Serious or Significant Adverse Events  
An AE classified as a SAE or a Significant Non -Serious Ocular AE requi res expeditious 
handling and reporting to the Sponsor to comply with regulatory requirements, as follows:  
• The event m ust be reported to the Medical Monitor  
(  within 24 hours of the Investigator’s 
awareness of the event via facsimile/email transmission  on a paper  SAE or 
Significant Non-Serious AE Report Form signed by [CONTACT_737]. 
• The Medical Monitor will email a copy of the form (within 24 hours) to  all 
p
arties listed below: 
o   
  
  
     
  
Inve
stigators should not wait to receive additional information to fully document 
the even
t before initially notifying the Medical Monitor of an SAE  or a Significant 
Non-Serious AE. Additional relevant information such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_858135].  
• The Investigator should take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the 
subjects: notably, he/she should follow a subject with an SAE  or Significant 
Non-Serious AE  until the event has resolved or the condition has stabilized . 
This may imply that follow -up will continue after the subject has left the study, 
and that additional evaluations may be requested by [CONTACT_1034]. 
• Ensure that the subject ’s identity is protected and the subject ’s identifier s in the 
clinical trial are properly mentioned on the form.  
• BEGIN TREATMENT OF THE AE IMMEDIATELY BY A SUITABLY 
LICENSED EYE CARE PROFESSIONAL.  
• Continue to update the paper SAE or Significant Non- Serious AE Report  Form , 
if applicable, each time the subject  is seen during the management of the event 
and at resolution of the event.  All updated report forms should be submitted by 
[CONTACT_858166] 24 hours.  The Medical Monitor should 
distribute the updated reports to appropriate S ponsor personnel. Whenever

7.2.3 Device Deficiencies : Definition and Reporting Procedures  
A device deficiency is defined as an inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its 
identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, or performance. Device deficiencies include malfunctions, use errors, and inadequate labeling. 
Investigators must evaluate, record, and report any complaints/ deficiencies or 
malfunctions experienced with the study solution  during this trial to the Me dical Monitor  
promptly. The  Sponsor and Medical Monitor  shall review all device deficiencies and, upon 
the Sponsor’s request, Investigators must supply any additional information related to the safety repo rting of a particular event. 
Report device deficiencies within 24 hours of knowledge to:

 7.2.4 Procedures for Culturing  of Co rneal U lcer or Suspected O cular I nfection  
For purposes of this study, the Sponsor requests that cultures should be obtained in cases 
of corneal ulcer or suspected ocular infection, unless medically contraindicated . Cultures 
should be taken from the cul -de-sac, lower eyelid margin, and the corneal lesion (if 
applicable). The required culturing techniques are outlined in Appendix B, Section 8.0). 
When a culture is obtained, the contact  [CONTACT_145924] w hich were being 
utilized by [CONTACT_858167]. 
Microbial data generated from returned subject supplies ( e.g., lenses, lens cases, and/or 
lens case solutions) are for information only. Because microbes may be introduced into 
subject supplies during use, recovery of microbes from returned subject supplies cannot be presumed to indicate etiolo gy or direction of organism transmission.  
The ocular cultures, along with the associated contact [CONTACT_145924], will be sent to the local clinical laboratory designated by [CONTACT_240377]. The clinical laboratory will report the culture results to the Investigator who will record the results in the eCRF.  
7.2.[ADDRESS_1195779] they might be pregnant ( e.g., missed 
or late menstrual period). Female subjects who become pregnant during the study will be followed until completion of pregnancy. Every effort will be made to obtain the health status of the mother and infant or fetus (in case s of miscarriage or ther apeutic abortion) at 
term. Pregnancy itself is not considered an AE. 
All confirmed pregnancies must be reported on a Pregnancy Report  and submitted to the 
Medical M onitor via facsimile or email transmission within 24  hours of the Investigator’s 
awareness o f the pregnancy.  The Medical Monitor will distribute the completed report to 
the Sponsor as per the distribution listed below. All pregnancies will be followed until outcome even after study closure.  The outcome of 
all pregnancies  will be reported on a  paper Pregnancy Outcome Report  and submitted to 
the Medical Monitor via facsimile or email transmission once the outcome is learned. The Medical Monitor will distribute the completed report to the Sponsor as per the distribution 
listed below. 
Although pregnancy occurring in a clinical study is not considered to be an AE or SAE, 
any pregnancy complication, spontaneous abortion, or elective termination of a pregnancy, for medical reasons, will be recorded as an SAE. Any serious complication or event resulting from the pregnancy should be reported to the Medical Monitor  within [ADDRESS_1195780] for  reporting pregnancies and pregnancy outcomes are:

 8.3.7 Enrollment Target s 
Approximately 300 subjects (150 in each treatment group) will complete the trial. Allowing 
for up to 10% losses and for equal enrollment across sites, the enrollment target will be 
approximately 340 subjects (680 eyes). 
To allow for approximately [ADDRESS_1195794] will be randomized to one of the treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio (Test to 
Control). Randomization will be man aged using a RTSM system. The randomization will 
be stratified by [CONTACT_858168].   
Efforts will be made to enroll subjects in at least three of the lens strata within each site to 
minimize confounding between site and lens group.  Whi le the target enrollment for each 
lens group is approximately 68 subjects, some lens strata may be difficult to enroll.   
8.5 Study Populations  
8.5.1 Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population  
The ITT P opulation will consist of all randomized subjects for subject level summar ies 
and, for eye level summaries, both of their eyes. Subjects will be included in ITT Population summaries according to the treatment group to which they were randomly assigned. 
8.5.2 Per Protocol (PP) Population 
The PP Population will consist of all ITT Popula tion subjects without important (major) 
protocol deviations for subject level summaries and, for eye level summaries, both of their 
eyes. Important protocol deviation categories are defined in Section 8.6.[ADDRESS_1195795] treatment group.

 8.6 Statistical Analysis  
8.6.1 Methods of Analysis 
[IP_ADDRESS] General Methods  
Continuous data will be summarized using sample size (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), 
median, minimum,  and maximum. Categorical data will be presented using the total counts 
for each category and corresponding percentages. The denominator for each percentage 
will be the number of subjects or eyes with non- missing data  unless otherw ise indicated.  
As is customary for contact [CONTACT_599849], eyes will be treated as independent sampling units in eye level analyses unless otherwise noted. 
Listings of data will be produced in addition to tables of summary statistics.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Overall Comfort 
At each follow -up visit, overall comfort will be assessed for each eye on a scale from [ADDRESS_1195796] favorable response. For each eye, mean overall comfort 
over all follow -up visits will be computed as the average of the non- missing  values over 
all scheduled follow-up visits. Missing data will not be imputed for the primary analysis. 
Mean overall comfort over all follow -up visits will be summarized at the eye level by 
[CONTACT_858169] a  table. A one-sided lower 
97.5% confidence limit around the difference in means between the T est and Control 
treatment groups, computed using an analysis of variance model including the fixed factor s 
of tre atment , site, and lens group will be displayed. If  the lower confidence limit is greater 
than - 5.0, then the null hypothesis that the test solution is not non inferior will be rejected, 
and the test solution will be statistically successful in this outcome.  
As a sensitivity analysis, the PP Population will be analyzed for this endpoint.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Vision  
At each follow -up visit, vision will be assessed for each eye on a scale from [ADDRESS_1195797] favorable response. Vision  will be analyzed using the methods 
described above for overall comfort.  [IP_ADDRESS] Front Surface Deposits  
At each follow -up vis
 it, the degree of front surface deposits will be graded  for each eye as 
0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Using only the non- missing observations from scheduled follow-up visits 
without imputation, each eye will be classified with respect to the maximum grade of front 
surface d eposits ( < 2, > 2)  observed over all f ollow-up visits. Maximum Front Surface 
Deposits O ver All Follow -up V isits ( < 2, > 2) will be summarized at the eye level by 
[CONTACT_858170] a table. A one-sided lower 
97.5% confidence limit around the difference in “< 2” proportions between the T est and 
Control treatment groups will be constructed using the Newcombe -Wilson score method.  
If the lower confidence limit is gr eater than -10.0% or if no deposits with grade greater 
than [ADDRESS_1195798] solution  will be statistically successful in 
this outcom e. 
As a sensitivity analysis, the PP Population will be analyzed for this endpoint.

upper 97.5% confidence limit around the difference in “Present” proportions between the 
Test and C ontrol treatment groups will be constructed using the Newcombe -Wilson score 
method. If the upper confi dence limit is less th an 5.0%  or if no findings greater than grade 
[ADDRESS_1195800] solution will be statistically successful in this  
outcome. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Subject Assessment  
At the Exit visit, s ubjects will report  their level of agreement  with each of a series of twelve  
statement s in the Subject Assessment Questionnaire . Responses will be on a scale of one 
(strongly disagree)  through six (strongly agree). These  values  will be dichotomized  for 
analysis , with responses of one through three being mapped to the category of “Disagree” 
and responses of four through six being mapped to “Agree.”  
Statistical testing will proceed  in two hierarchical  families  of twelve  statistical tests  each 
(one test per statement) , with the null hypotheses of the first family eligible for rejection if 
all the primary endpoints are met.  
The first family will employ  a one- sided exact binomial test to compare the proportion of  
respondents in the Test group agreeing with each  statement to 0.5.  
The second family will employ a one-sided chi -square test  to compare the proportion of 
respondents agreeing with each statement between the treatment groups.  Within each family of hypothesis tests, the P -values will be adjusted for multiplicity u sing 
the Holm method. Adjusted one -sided P-values less than 0.025 will show statistical 
significance.  
The responses to each statement will be summarized categorically (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, Agree, 
Disagree) by [CONTACT_121610] a table for the ITT Set . The adjusted P -values from the 
statistical tests  will also be displayed  along with an indicator of statistical significance . If 
the statistical tests in a family are not eligible for rejection due to hi erarchy, then the 
adjusted P -values for that family wil l not be displayed. 
8.6.2 Adverse Events  
All AEs occurring during the study will be recorded and classified on the basis of  Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA ) terminology. Descripti ons of AEs will 
include the date of onset, the date the AE end ed, the severity of the AE, the relationship to 
the study device, the action taken regarding study medication usage, the action taken to treat the AE, and the outcome. All reported treatment- emergent A Es (TEAEs ) will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_858172], system organ class, severity, 
seriousness, and relationship to study device. TEAEs are those AEs with an onset on or after the date of the first study device use.

Confidential  APPENDIX B:  METHODS OF CLINICAL EVALUATION  
Any changes to the procedures described in this appendix will be provided under separate 
cover.  Equipment and Instrumentation used to perform clinical ev aluations should be 
maintained and calibrated per  the investigative site’s procedures.   
1.0 Visual Acuity/Refraction  
It is essential that a standard procedure be used to obtain VA measurements. The VA and refraction measurements should be obtained by a physician, optometrist, or trained technician. All VA/Refraction must be measured using a phoropter in 0.[ADDRESS_1195811] logMAR, chart high 90% contrast, with Sloan letters will be used to obtain the VA measurements in this study. The following VA equipment from Precision Vision, Inc. will be used  in this study: 90% high c ontrast 6.5 feet (2.0 meters) testing distance 
Translucent Chart (CAT. NO. 2103- 2), and the Precision Vision Small Illuminator Cabinet 
(CAT. NO. 914). 
1.[ADDRESS_1195812]’s eyes to the logMAR  
chart is 6.5 feet (2.0 meters). The chart should be at eye level for the subject. The logMAR 
charts have two alternative letter sequences from 28 letters  (0.3 logMAR) to 62 letters ( -
0.3 logMAR). It is recommended that one letter sequence is used for the right eye, and the second letter sequence is used for the left eye, to minimize learning effects at each visit. Care should be taken to completely occlude the eye not being measured.  
Since the test distance of the chart is not at optical infinity, refractive power compensation 
is required to simulate optical infinity. The VA should be measured through the phoropter using the distance refractive correction with the addition of +0.[ADDRESS_1195813] distance of 6.5 feet (2.0 meters).  
If all letters are correctly identified on any given line, then the subject is encouraged to read 
the
 next smaller line. When the subject says they cannot read a letter, they should be 
required to guess. A maximum effort should be made to identify each letter. A scoring sheet for each eye is provided to keep track of the letters correctly identified. The subject continues reading down the chart to the last letter of a given line, until the subject has 
missed [ADDRESS_1195814] to be consecutive.

19 JAN  2023  Page B-2 
Confidential  1.3 Recording and Scoring logMAR Values 
Using the Spons or supplied recording/scoring sheet, an example of which is shown below, 
the tester will record the actual VA measure.  
The number of letters CORRECT will be recorded on the recording/scoring sheet in the far 
right box on the corresponding line. The lines will then be added up and the “TOTAL” number of letters correctly identified will be recorded on the recording/scoring sheet. The “TOTAL” is the number that will be entered onto the e CRF.  
Example of Distance VA:  
In the example below, all letters in lines [ADDRESS_1195815] would be considered complete. In this example, the total letters correctly identified is 32. This number is recorded in the space marked “TOTAL” and also recorded on the e CRF.

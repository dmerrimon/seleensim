njection drug users (IDUs) constitute 60% of the approximately 5 million people in the U .S. infected  with 
hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV is the leading cause of liver failure and transplantation in the U .S., and mortality  
and health care costs due to HCV ar e expected to increase over the next two decades . Successful HCV 
treatment  leading to sustained viral response (SVR)  is associated with decreased progression of liver disease 
and increased survival , but to date successful treatment of IDUs has been limited. 
Although past  HCV therapi[INVESTIGATOR_123683]- 1 infected pat ients (the most 
common genotype in the U .S.), new er regimens are substantially improved. With the addition of direct -acting 
antiviral agents , HCV treatment  delivered w ithin large clinical trials leads to SVR or cure in  over 90%  of 
genotype- 1 infected patients , compared to 45% with previous regimens . However, SVR rates are as low as 
14% in real-world settings  (pegylated interferon and ribavirin) . Initial triple therapy H CV regimens  were 
associated with i ncreased dosing frequency (three times daily ), pi[INVESTIGATOR_123684] (up to 20 pi[INVESTIGATOR_36832]), and side 
effects . Newer regimens such as fixed- dose ledipasvir and sofosbuvir are dosed once daily and have minimal 
side effects.   Nevertheless, IDUs may still have lower adherence and high rates of treatment discontinuation, 
and many of those who fail to attain an SVR will develop drug resistance.  
If HCV treatment continues to be delivered within current  models of care, m ost IDUs will not o nly fail 
treatment  and develop resistance, but may transmit drug resistant viruses to others, leading to new reservoir s 
of drug resistant virus. Though a growing number of studies now provide support for using interferon- based 
HCV treatment regimens in IDU s, none have determined the best  model for delivering treatment , and this  lack 
of data has contributed to physician reluctance to offer HCV treatment to IDUs. To reduce  HCV  prevalence, 
decrease HCV transmission leading to new infections, decrease mortality  and health- care costs, and eliminate 
disparities in HCV -related care, effective HCV treatment must be provided to IDUs . 
Treatment of IDUs is  complex  due to addiction, mental illness , poverty, homelessness, lack of positive 
social support, poor adherence-r elated skills, low motivation and knowledge,  and poor access to and trust in 
the health  care system . Although treatment for addiction and access to multidisciplinary teams likely play 
important roles in successfully  treating HCV -infected IDUs, it is unknow n which  specific psychosocial and/or  
structural interventions  are needed. Each patient’s course of HCV treatment may cost  over $90,000, but may 
not be cost -effective with our current model s of care. The life- and cost -saving benefits of new  HCV  treatments 
will not be realized unless we determine optimal models of care for the majority of HCV -infected patients . 
We have developed a multidisci plinary model of HCV care which integrates substance abuse treatment, 
on-site primary and psychiatr ic care,  and HCV -related care within opi[INVESTIGATOR_123685] . To maximize 
HCV treatment outcomes , we have also pi[INVESTIGATOR_123686]: directly observed therapy (DOT) , 
and concurrent group therapy  (CGT). In our  DOT model, one daily dose of oral medication is administered with 
methadone . Though we have shown that DOT is associated with increased adherence , we do not know how 
DOT will extend to new DAA therapy , or what impact DOT will have on resistance. In our  CGT  model,  groups 
initiate and complete HCV treatment in a once weekly treatment group which provides  powerful social support  
to mitigat e fears of side effects  and promote s efficien t education. While CGT  has also been associated with 
good pi[INVESTIGATOR_123687] , we do not know whether either model  is better or more cost -effective than standard care. 
In the proposed study, 150 IDUs with chronic HCV  (genotype 1)  will be recruited from opi[INVESTIGATOR_123688]: DOT; CGT ; or standard on- site care. We 
hypothesi ze that either intensive  model  will be superior to standard on- site care. One-hundred will initiate 
treatment with fixed- dose ledipasvir and sofosbuvir.  Our specific aims  are: 
1.To determine in a randomized trial whether e ither  of two in tensive on -site HCV treatment models
(DOT or concurrent group treatment)  provided at a methadone program is more efficacious t han
st
andard on -site treatment for enhancing adherence and virological outcomes, and decreasi ng
dr
ug resistance . We will co mpare the proportion of sub jects in each arm who:  a) adhere to antiviral
treatmen t; b) co mplete antiviral treatment; c) attain SVR (cure ); and d) develop drug resistance .
2.To determine the incidence and factors associated with the development of drug resistance in
IDUs initiating  HCV  treatment . In a pooled analysis of all subjects, we will determine what proporti on
o
f subjects develops  resistance, and examine associations between adherence and resistance.
3.To perform cost and cost -effectiveness analyses of each model of intensive on- site HCV care.
We will use empi[INVESTIGATOR_123689]- site or standard on- site
care. A computer simulation cost -effectiveness model combining  empi[INVESTIGATOR_123690] y-adjusted life-year gained associated with intensive versus
standard care.
1  B. SIGNIF ICANCE 
B.1. HCV  epi[INVESTIGATOR_123691].  HCV  prevalence in injection drug users  (IDUs)  ranges  from 70-90%,  and 
HCV  incidence ranges  from 10–26 per 100 person -years.1-4 IDUs  comprise 60% of all HCV -infected  persons  in 
the U.S.,  and genotype- [ADDRESS_139241]  prevalent  (74%).5 In the U.S., approximately  35,000  acute HCV  
infections  occur  each year,  and a 4-fold increase  in the number  of adults  with chronic  HCV  is projected from  
1990- 2015.6 HCV  causes  up to 15,000 deaths annually,  and is the leading cause of liver transplantation 
in the U.S.7-9 Until recently  (6/11),  HCV  treatm ent was effective  in less than 50% of patients  in registration 
trials ,10-12 and much less effective  (14%)  in real-world  urban populations .13 Treatment  effectiveness  among 
IDUs  is crucial  because IDUs  remain the leading risk group for HCV  infection.14 
B.2. Treatment  of chronic HCV.  Sustained viral response (SVR),  defined as the absence  of 
detectable  virus  24 weeks after completion of therapy,  reflects  eliminatio n of HCV  infection  because >95%  of 
patients  with such  respo nses  remain persisten tly free of detectable virus  up to 10 years  later.15,16 Combination 
pegylated interferon  (IFN)  and ribavirin  therapy  also reduc es progressi on of liver fibrosis,17-[ADDRESS_139242]  manageme nt is a crucial feature of HCV  care.  
B.3. Efficacy  of new HCV  regimen s for genot ype-1 infected patients.  Treatment  with IFN and 
ribavirin  has been associated with SVR rates  of 40-50% in treatment -naive  patients  with genotype 1. In the 
ADVANCE  trial, patient s who were  treated with IFN, ribavirin,  and telapr evir achieved an SVR of 75%, 
compared  to 44% in the IFN and ribavirin  arm.46 Rates  of SVR were  higher  in telapr evir-treated patients 
regardless  of stage  of liver disease,  race, or ethnicity.  However,  there  was a two-fold higher  incidence  of 
adverse effects,  including rash,  nausea,  and anemia,w ith telaprevir -based  regimens  compared to IFN and 
ribavirin.46-48 When patients disconti nue treatment  prior to 20 weeks,  the SVR rate is markedly  decreased - 
only 23%.47 Support  for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_123692].   The FDA 
has recently approved treatment of genotype- 1 infected patients with 12 –  24 weeks of fixed- dose 
(ledipasvir  and sofosbuvir ), and this is associated with SVR rates of >95% (www.hcvguidelines.org).  
B.4. Is HCV  treatment  feasible  in IDUs?  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_123693], 
the [ADDRESS_139243]  shown lower  rates  of SVR among  Latinos  comp ared to non-Latino whites (34%  v. 
49%),91 and among  African  Americans  compared  to non-Hispanic Whites  (19%  v. 52%) .92 In a recent 
effectiveness  study  from our liver clinic,  rates  of SVR for genotype- 1 infected patien ts were  even lower:  11% 
for Latinos,  14% for African  Americans,  and 25% for Whites .[ADDRESS_139244] 
been excluded.95 Treatment  differences  among  Latinos,  African  Americans  and Whites are explained to a 
large extent  by [CONTACT_123714] 3 gene,  and the favorable IL28B  
genoty pe (C/C vs. C/T or T/T) is more  prevalent  in Whites  than in Latinos or African Americans .96, [ADDRESS_139245]  that disparities  may be less pronou nced with telaprevir -based treatment:  the ADVANCE  trial 
demonstrated  SVR rates  of 62% in African  Americans  and 74% in Latinos.46 With fixed -dose ( ledipasvir and 
sofosbuvir ), there does not appear to be differences in rates of SVR based on race and ethinicty.  However, 
there may be differences seen in real -world studies. A dditional  intensive interventions  are neede d to optimize  
treatment  outcom es for Latino and African  American IDUs.  Because our substance  abuse treatment  program  
serves  predom inantly  Latinos  and African  Americans,  we have the opportunity  to test such  interventions.  
B.6. What  is known about adherence to HCV  treatment?  Strict  adhe rence  to IFN and ribavirin therapy  
is necessary  to optimize  SVR rates.  Studies  have shown that patients  who adhere to at least  80% of the 
intended treatment  schedule (taking  at least  80% of the total dose of both IFN and ribavirin  for at least  80% of 
the inten ded duration)  are more  likely  to achieve an SVR (44% v. 7%).98, [ADDRESS_139246] suggested  that ribavirin 
exposure may be particularly  important  in determining  response to HCV  treatment,  supporting the concept  that 
adherence to daily oral medicat ions requires  unique interventions .101, 102 There are currently  little data descri bing 
associa tions between DAA adherence  and virological outcomes,  making  optimal  levels  of adherence  to DAA -
based regimens  unknown.  However,  because  of the risk of resistance  observed with protease inhibitor  
treatment  for HIV, optimal  adherence  may be as high as 90%.  Adherence support  is particularly important  for 
active  drug users,  because active  drug use has been associated  with nonadherence .103-[ADDRESS_139247] the advantage of continuously 
assessing  doses  taken  and temporal  regularity .112 Med-ic® electronic  monitors  are an innovative method of 
assessing  adherence  that uses  an electronic  monitoring system applied directly  to weekly  blister  packs .113 This 
system  allows  patients  to continue  to take medications  from blister  packs, which  are associ ated with improved 
adherence to complex  regimens.  In the propos ed trial, we will take advantage of this new technology  to 
monitor  adherence,  and we will also use self-report adherence  measures.  Self-reported adherence  to HCV  
treatment  has been  shown to be correlated with (though  higher than)  electronic  monitoring estimates .[ADDRESS_139248] -acting  antiviral  HCV  agents and resistance.  Emergence of antiviral resistant  varia nts 
during  PI-based  therapy  has been observed during  all trials,  and is associated with both virological failure  and 
relapse.115 In clinical trials, resistance -associa ted mutations  were  seen  in 62% of patients  who failed  to achieve 
SVR.  However, only 5% of patients  in telaprevir  trials  had baseline  HCV  substitu tions/variants,  and these were 
not associa ted with SVR.[ADDRESS_139249] been demonstrated  to reduce  the anti- HCV 
activity  of NS3/4A  protease  inhibitors .116-[ADDRESS_139250] been seen in patients treated with fixed-
dose (ledipasvir and sofosbuvir). I n the proposed trial, we will assess development  of resistanc e, and determine  
the association  between adherence level and development  of resis tance.  
B.8. Cost  of HCV  treatment.  A 48-week  course of IFN, ribavirin,  and telaprevir,  including  the use of 
growth  factors  (and exclusive  of physician visits,  laboratory  tests,  or care for complications)  may be over 
$50,000.119,177-[ADDRESS_139251] of fixed- dose ( ledipasvir  and sofosbuvir ) may be over $90,000. A small  increment  in the 
overall  cost of treatment  that appreciably  increases  patients’ likelihood  of successfully  completing  the regimen  
could substantially  improve its cost-effectiveness.  To assess this,  we will estimate  the cost of each model  of on-
site care (mDOT,  CGT,  and stand ard care).  While intensive on- site interventions  such  as mDOT  and CGT  may 
require  additional  provider time,  we expect  the incremental cost  of this effort  will be relatively  small compared  to 
the current cost of treatment.  
B.9. Theoretical  frame works for the proposed trial.  
Information,  Motivation,  Behavior  (IMB)  model  of adherence.  The proposed mDOT  and CGT 
interventions  are guided  by [CONTACT_3493]’s  IMB model .120-[ADDRESS_139252]  adherence .120 In extreme  cases,  strong negative  effects  on adherence are expected,  and 
interventions  aimed at improving  information and motivation may not be effective  without  adjuvant  support.  
Both interventions  - mDOT  and CGT  - focus  on enhancing information,  motivation,  and behavioral 
skills,  and provide adjuvant  support  to lessen negative  impacts  of moderating  factors. The mDOT  strategy,  in 
which  adherence to HCV  treatment  is linked to an establishe d behavioral  skill, specifically  methadone clinic 
3  attendance,  addresses  adherence skills:  acquisit ion and administration  of HCV  medications;  incorporation  of 
HCV  treatment  into daily routines;  copi[INVESTIGATOR_123694]  (through  side effect  assessment  and manageme nt 
protocols);  and acquis ition of social support.  While primarily  operating  on behavioral  skills,  the mDOT  
4  intervention also enhances  both information  and motivation (through  support from nurses  and other clinic  staff). 
Our proposed CGT  intervention addresses  information  (through education),  motivation (through  peer and 
providers  support),  and behavioral  skills  (by [CONTACT_123715]).

[ADDRESS_139253] as was observed with HIV. 
Initially,  HIV did not discriminate based on race,  ethnicit y, or socioeconomic  status  (SES),  but as effective 
treatments  became  available,  African  Americans,  Latinos,  and those  with low SES began to have poorer 
treatment  outcomes.  Link and Phelan proposed  that socio economic  status is a “fundamental  cause”  of 
mortality  disparities,  and that socio economic  disparities  endure despi[INVESTIGATOR_123695].[ADDRESS_139254]  potenti al to minimize  or eliminate  disparitie s.94 
Intensive models  of HCV  care which  mobilize  resources  normally  available to patien ts with high levels 
of SES (such  as knowledge,  social  networks,  prestige,  or power)  may decrease associations  between SES 
and HCV -related morbidity  and mortality. To optimize  HCV  prevention and control,  it is essen tial to eradicate 
racial  and ethnic dispar ities, as well as dispari ties based on SES and IDU-status  in HCV-related  healthcare. 
Our proposed models  may be an important  step towards  eliminating  disparities  in HCV care.  
B.10.  Generalizability  of mDOT  and CGT  approaches.  IDUs  are at the heart  of the HCV  epi[INVESTIGATOR_901], 
and the majority  of all cases in the U.S. and other  developed nations  are related to illicit drug use. There  are 
several  reasons  for initiating this research  in the methadone treatment  setting:  (1) drug users  must  attend their 
methadone program  frequently  because methadone take-home doses  are linked to absence of illicit drug use; 
(2) methadone treatment  is a congr egate setting  in which  patients  are already present  nearly  daily to receive 
methadone;  and (3) drug users  may have particular  difficulty adhering  with HCV  treatment,  in part because the 
side effec ts of IFN mimic the symptoms  of opi[INVESTIGATOR_123696].  If proven effective, our mDOT  model could be 
applied in other programs  that serve  the approximately  180,000 HCV -infected  methadone patien ts in the 
U.S.124-125 as well as in other  settin gs in which  drug users  are present  nearly daily (e.g. correctiona l facilities, 
homeless  shelters,  day treatment  programs,  and residential  substance  abuse  settin gs). DOT  can be extended 
in the community  through  nurses  and communi ty health workers .126-127 If proven effective,  our CGT  model could  
be applied  to many  diverse clinical settings in which  patients  are able to attend clinic  once weekly.  
C. INNOVATION  
•  First randomized  trial to test innovative intervention strate gies for providing  HCV -care to IDUs  in the U.S. 
•     Concurrent  group treatment  (CGT)  is an innov ative model  of care allowing  groups  of patients  to 
concurrently  initiate  HCV  treatment,  leading  to informed and activated patient  groups  with enhanced 
social support  and trust in the healthcare  team. 
•     Adherence monitoring  of blister  packs with Medi -ic® technology  allows  us to combi ne a state  of the 
art electronic  adherence  monitoring system  with weekly  blister  packs.  
•  First study  to provide data on factors  associ ated with resista nce to HCV  direct -acting  antiviral drugs  in 
IDUs,  and to define associations  between adherence and development  of resista nce. 
•  Innovative techniques  for modeling  cost,  including  quality adjustment  for treatment  failure  and 
development of  resistant -virus.128 
•     First study  to evaluate cost effectiv eness  of HCV  treatment  in a methadone clinic  in a randomized trial. 
D. APPROACH 
D.1. Prelim inary Studies 
D.1.1.  Overvi ew of the research team.  We have assembl ed a strong  team of investigators  with 
expertise conducting  research to improve  health outcomes  among  HCV -infected  and drug-using  populations.  
[CONTACT_54805]  has focused on defining optimal  mode ls of HCV  care for IDUs,  and is expert  in treating HCV  in IDUs,  
methadone -maintained patients,  and active  drug users.  [CONTACT_123747]  is a nationally  recognized expert on 
adherence to antiviral  therapy  and treatment  of HIV and HCV  in substa nce users.  [CONTACT_123748]  is expert in 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_123697], particularly  HCV.  [CONTACT_123749] is expert  in cost studies of models  of care for screening  and treatment  for diverse populations,  and 
has extensive experience conducti ng economic  analyses  in collaborati on with the NIDA  Clinical Trials  Network 
and the NIAID  AIDS  Clinical Trials  Group.  [CONTACT_123750]  has expertise in modeling  the impact of care systems  on 
HCV - and HIV-related outcomes.  This team  has successfully  condu cted epi[INVESTIGATOR_123698], clinical,  behavioral,  
and cost studi es of HCV -infected  and drug-using  populations,  and together  has published over [ADDRESS_139255]. Litwin  collaborated on a multi- site study  of the 
6  
safety  and efficacy  of thrice-weekly  IFN and ribavirin  in IDUs.70 The model  of care included  multidiscip linary 
treatment  with on-site HCV care,  substance  abuse treatment,  and psychiatric  care.  Subjects  self-administered 
both medications,  and 28% achieved SVR.  We concluded that IDUs  can be safely  and effectively treated 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_123699].  However,  SVR was lower than would be expected in a large registration 
trial where projected SVR would be 51%,  given  the same  proportion of genotypes.[ADDRESS_139256] 
were  Latino (67%)  or African -American  (12%),  nearly  half (49%)  had used  illicit substances  in the 6 months 
before initiating treatment,  32% were  HIV-infected,  and curre nt psychiatric  illness  was common  (67%). Most 
(86%)  completed 12 weeks  of HCV  treatment  and 45% achieved SVR,  including  40% of genotype- 1 patient s. 
Though  30% used  illicit drugs  during HCV  treatment,  there  was no association  between illicit drug use and 
virological outcomes.  These  resul ts demonstrate that IDUs  with complex  medical  and psychiatric  comorbiditi es 
can be effectively  treated  for HCV  with co-located on-site care. However,  it is unknown which  interventions 
(multidisciplinary  on-site care v. DOT  injectio ns) contributed to the observed outcomes .78-[ADDRESS_139257] (K23  DA022454,  PI: [INVESTIGATOR_123700])  of modified  DOT  (mDOT)  which  extended our DOT  strategy  to the oral 
medication ribavirin.  We designed this trial to test the efficacy  of [ADDRESS_139258] completed 
enrollment  (n=80),  with 74 initiating  HCV  treatm ent. We observed significant  differences  in pi[INVESTIGATOR_123701]  (88%  in mDOT  arm vs. 77% in the treatment  as usual,  or TAU arm, p=0.02).129 In 
addition,  81% of mDOT  subjec ts achieved • 80% adherence v. 53% in the TAU arm (p=0.09).  Only 16% 
discontinued treatment,  and among  genotype- 1 infected  patients (n=22),  55% achieved SVR (half active  drug 
users) .[ADDRESS_139259] 4 subjects  on telaprevir -based triple  therapy randomi zed to DOT,  pi[INVESTIGATOR_123702] 4 
weeks  was 98%,  and 3 of 4 had 4 week  VL<43 IU/ml,  with one subject  discontinui ng treatment.  
The above data demonstrate:  (1) our ability  to enroll and retain HCV -infected IDUs;  (2) efficacy  of 
enhanced mDOT  v. standard mDOT;  and (3) promising  early  outcomes  with telapr evir-based therapy. 
However,  because this pi[INVESTIGATOR_123703]  (and both arms 
included some degree of DOT),  we now propose a definitiv e study  to determine if DOT  is associated  with 
increased SVR for genotype- [ADDRESS_139260] sufficient  power  to 
answer  this question  as treatment  for genotype- 1 patients  is more  effective  (SVR=7 5%),46 we will include only 
genotype- 1 patients,  and all medic ations  will be self-administered in the proposed TAU arm. 
D.1.5.  Concurrent  Group  Treatment  (CGT).  In 2009,  we implemented  a group treatment  model  of HCV 
care.  To date,  [ADDRESS_139261] initiated  CGT  (including  34 enrolled in the mDOT  study  desc ribed above).  Early 
treatment  outcomes  are promising,  with 89% of patient s completi ng at least  80% of planne d treatment  duration, 
and only [ADDRESS_139262] 20 patie nts who 
initiated  CGT, 80% achieved an end of treatment  response and 55% achieved SVR,  including 57% of those 
with genotype- 1 (half active  drug users).[ADDRESS_139263] initiated  telaprevir -based regimens,  7 of 8 had 
4 week  HCV  VL <[ADDRESS_139264] able VL, 
with one discon tinuing treatment.  These data demonstrate  
that CGT  is a promising model  of care for treati ng IDUs.  
However,  since  patients  were not  randomized,  it is possible 
that CGT patients  were  more motivated than others.  The 2 
x 2 figure  demonstrates  the effects  of each intervention 
(mDOT  and CGT),  as well as of their interacti on. When  
subjects  were  treated individually  with mDOT,  or when the subjects  were treated  with CGT  (without mDO T), 
adherence and virological  outcomes  were  better  than without  either intervention.  Howev er, the additive 
effects  of mDOT  and CGT appear  modest.  For this reaso n, as well as to increase  generalizabi lity, in the 
proposed study  we will evaluate 2 models  of intensive  care: mDOT  (both  IFN and oral medicati ons) and CGT  
(IFN direc tly-administered and oral meds  self-administered).  Both models  must  be rigorously  tested to 
determine whether  intensive  models  of care are superior  to stand ard on-site care for achieving  SVR.  
D.1.6.  RCT of direct ly observed HAART  in methadone patients.  We conducted an RCT of DOT  with 
HAART  in HIV-infected  drug users  in methadone  clinics.  Seventy -seven participant s were  randomized to a 24- 
week  DOT  intervention or treatment  as usual  (TAU), with 86% study  retention at 24 weeks.  Participants 
randomized to DOT  (v. TAU) had greater  adherence (mean adherence:  86% v. 56%,  p<0.0001)  and VL 
7  decreased  by 0.52 log10 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/ml  in the DOT  group  while  it remained stable  in the TAU group (p<0.01).  More 
DOT  than TAU participants  had undetectable viral load (71%  vs. 44%,  p=0.03).  Active  drug use decreased 
adherence,  but the negative impact  of drug use on adherence  was eliminated by [CONTACT_63625]. By [ADDRESS_139265]  drug resista nce, we examined the 
developmen t of new resistance  mutations  among  21 partic ipants who had a detectable  HIV VL at both baseli ne 
and a seco nd time point.  Of these,  9 developed new drug resistance  mutations  not seen at baseline (3 in DOT 
and 6 in TAU,  p=0.27).  Overall,  [ADDRESS_139266]  pi[INVESTIGATOR_123704].  Drs. Schackman and Litwin  conduc ted a retros pective  chart  review  of costs  of 
HCV  treatment  for patients treated  in a methadone maintenance  progr am. Mean treatment  costs were  $40,600 
for patients  with SVR and $31,[ADDRESS_139267] of HIV medication adherence  support interventions .137 
D.2. Overvi ew of study  approach.  In the proposed study,  150 HCV -monoinfected IDUs (genotype 1) 
eligible  for on-site HCV  treatment  will be recruited from opi[INVESTIGATOR_123705] 3 models  of care: modified  directly  observed treatment  (mDOT);  concurrent  group treatment  (CGT);  or 
standard  on-site treatment  which  represents  the treatment  as usual  arm (TAU).  We will compare the proporti on 
of patients  in each  arm who optimally  adhere (>80%), complete treatment,  achieve SVR,  and develop 
resistanc e. We hypothesize that both intensive  models  of care (mDOT  and CGT)  will be superior  to TAU.  
Participants  on 48 week regimens (e.g. telaprevir) will be followed  for 72 weeks  (up to 48 weeks  of HCV trea tment  + 
24 weeks  of follow -up), with visits  occurri ng every  [ADDRESS_139268] 24 weeks, followed by 
4 additional  visits  at 12 week  intervals.  Participants (n=100) on 12 –  24 weeks reg imens (fixed -dose ledipasvir and 
sofosbuvir ) will be followed up to 48 weeks (up to 24 weeks of HCV treatment + 24 weeks of follow -up) with visits 
occurring every [ADDRESS_139269] 12 weeks, week 24 (if necessary), end of treatment, and follow -up weeks (4, 12 and 
24).  Data  sources  will include blood tests  (HCV  viral load and resistance tests), urine toxicology  tests,  
questionn aires,  medical  records,  electronic  monitors  for assessing adherence,  and staff logs and direct  
observation (for cost-effectiveness  analysis).  In pooled analyses  of all subjects  (n=150),  we will determine 
associa tions between adherence and developm ent of resist ance. We will also  assess  cost and cost-
effective ness of all 3 models.

 D.3. Setting:  Einstein and Montef iore Division  of Substance Abuse (DoSA).  DoSA  is a clinical, 
research,  and teaching division  of Einstein’s  Department  of Psychiatry  and Behavioral  Sciences.  DoSA  operates 
a comprehensive substance abuse treatment  program  providi ng pharmacotherapy  and related services to about 
4200 adults  (>18 years)  with current  narcotic  addicti on (typi[INVESTIGATOR_123706]).  The primary  focus is treatment  of opi[INVESTIGATOR_123707],  and the average  methadone pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696]-up schedule is [ADDRESS_139270].

Medical  Director),  partic ipant recrui tment and private office  space for research visits  will be ensur ed. 
D.4. Partic ipants.  Most  DoSA  patients  are Hispanic (59%)  or black  (24%), male  (62%),  and live under 
the federal  poverty  line (81%).  Mean age is 47 years.  Approximately  65% (n=2730)  are HCV -infected,  and 
75% of those  have chronic  HCV  (n=2048);  70% have  genotype- 1 (n=1434),  and 80% of those  are HIV- 
negative (n=1147).  We anticipate 800 new admissions  over the 3-year recruitment  period,  representing 
another  216 HCV -monoinfected  genotype -1 patients.

D.6. Partic ipant  tracking and retention.  We have extensive experience following  HCV - and HIV- 
infected  drug users  in studies.  In our ongoing  RCT of directly  observed HCV  treatm ent, 24 week  follow -up was 
92%.[ADDRESS_139272] of directly  observed HAART,  24-week  follow -up was 86%.[ADDRESS_139273]:  1) participan ts’ address,  phone number,  and social security  number;  2)

4) contact  [CONTACT_123719];  and 5) locations  where particip ants “hang  out”. 
D.7. Randomization.  We will recruit  150 patients  (100 on fixed- dose sofosbuvir and ledipasvir) , with 
patien ts randomized to mDOT, CGT,  or TAU in a 1:1:1  ratio (50 subjec ts in each group) in variable block  
sizes of 3-6 via central,  computer -generated randomization.  Two special  randomization strategies 
(stratification  and blocking)  will be used to avert imbalances  in prognostic  factors,  and to ensure  comparison

D.8. Treatment  arms:  TAU,  mDOT,  and CGT.  All 3 models  of care include co-locat ed on-site care 
including  HCV care,  primary  care,  and substance  abuse treatment. Table 2 summarizes similarities  and 
differences  between the 3 models.  Subjects  randomized to TAU will receive all medications monthly  at the 
clinic  from the clinic  nurse,  packaged  in 7-day blister  packs  (oral medications)

D.8.1.  Intensive treatment  intervention arms  (mDOT  and CGT)  
Modified  directly  observed treatment  (mDOT).  Since  DOT  of HCV  medications  will be linked  to 
methadone visits,  the number  of directly  observed oral doses  will vary based on the number  of days  the 
patients  attends the clinic  to receive directly  observed metha done (pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696] -up schedule).  This interv ention is 
considered modified DOT  (mDOT) since  only 1-6 out of up to 24  weekly  oral medication  doses  will be 
obser ved. Subjects  in the mDOT  arm will receive:  1) 1 to 6 directly  observed oral medication doses  per week  
at the same time as they receive methadone,  and 2) individually  packaged  take-home  doses  for self-
admini stration  on days not in the clinic.  In additi on, methadone clinic nurses  will: 3) notify clinicia ns when 
doses  are declin ed, 4) assess  for side effects using a standard  script; and 5) refer subjec ts to onsite  clinicia ns 
as necessary.  Since  some medica tions must  be taken with food,  subjects  will also be provided with a high-fat 
snack  (20 grams  of fat) when necessary . 
Concurrent  group treatment  (CGT).  We developed this model  by [CONTACT_123722]70,77-[ADDRESS_139277] 6 components:  1) brief physical  exams;  2) psychosocial  support from 
peers  and providers;  3) education;  4) direct  administration  of pegylated interferon  medication in the group 
setting  (if applicable) ; 5) side effect  management;  and 6) closing  meditation  on positive  health.  Six to [ADDRESS_139278]  with each other  and the treatment  team  (phys ician and physician assist ant). Subjects  will introduce 
themselves  and share  concerns  about HCV.  The treatment  team  will present  an overview  of the HCV  
epi[INVESTIGATOR_123708],  natural  history  of HCV,  and risks,  benefits,  and efficacy  of HCV  
treatment.  The group treatment  protocol  and schedule will be discussed,  and time allowed for questions  and 
discussion.  A second orientation will be scheduled the followin g week  to discuss medication side effects  and 
general strategies  for managing  them.  A group treatment  contract,  including  a confidentiality  agreement,  will 
be read aloud  by [CONTACT_123723].  At the third weekly  group,  all members  will initiate  treatment  
concurrently  and receive the first IFN injection  directly  administered in the group setting  (if applicable) . 
WEEKLY TREATMENT GROUP S. Each  group will last one hour.  Prior to the group, one clinician  will review 
labs and make decisions  regarding  ribavirin  dose  adjustments  (if applicable) and initiation  or adjus tment of 
growth  factors  (if applicable) to manage  adverse  effects  (cytopenias).  When  group members  arrive,  they will fill 
out weekly  side effect inventory  sheets.  During  the first [ADDRESS_139279] a group discussion  
while  the second provider  completes individual  visits.  Facilitated group discussion will begin with an informal  
hand raising  survey  of how participants are  faring  in treatment  from “terrible”  to “no probl em”. The group will 
end with a 5-minute guided meditation exercise.  The total time demand  for the treatment  team  is 90 minutes.  
All subjects will receive metrocards  (2 ride  value of $5.00)  for each  of the first 12 weeks  as an incen tive for 
arriving  within  a 15 minute grace  period. At  the completion of treatment,  a ceremony  is held and certificates  of 
appreciation are given  out. 
FREQUENCY  OF CGT  CYCLE S. New cycles  begin at each of 3 sites 3 times  per year;  therefore there  is a 
new cycle  starting  nearly  every  mont h. To facilit ate rapid  entry into a group,  trial subjects may elect  to wait until 
a cycle  is starting at their “home”  clinic  site, or travel to a different  site. In addition,  they may join a group that is 
already  in its first mont h. (Appendix  C for group treatment  protocols)  
D.9. Specific study design considerations.  
D.9.2.  Why not include  an off-site treatment  by [CONTACT_123724]?  Our study  is urgently  needed because 
off-site referral is the current prevailing  model  of HCV  care,  and alternative approache s are neede d. [CONTACT_123751] 
has studied  outcomes  from Montefi ore’s liver clinic and found that only 15% were  eligible  for HCV  treatment, 
and SVR rates for geno type-1 were  14% (compared  to 40% in our on-site cohor ts).[ADDRESS_139280]. Reinus.  
D.9.3.  Why another  study of DOT  for HCV  treatment? To date,  no HCV  DOT  study has 
demonstrated  improved virological outcomes,  the most  important  clinical outcome.  Our currently  funded study 
has a heter ogeneous  population and was powered for adherence,  not virological outcomes.  This study 
demonstrates  that there  is increas ed adherence with DOT  and is the foundation for the proposed trial. 
D.9.4.  Why use weekly  blister  packs instead  of the standard  packaging? Weekly  pi[INVESTIGATOR_123709].147-[ADDRESS_139281]  of the intensive interventions.  Since  any increase  in 
adherence from blister  packaging  will be observed in all three arms,  it will not contaminate intervention effects.  
D.9.6.  Future  developments in HCV  treatment . Study  participants  will receive state-of-the-art 
treatment  (IFN in combination with telaprevir  and ribavirin).  As additional  regimens  become available with either 
more  conv enient  dosing , fewer  side effects,  or increased efficacy,  partic ipants  in all [ADDRESS_139282] available practices.  On October 10, 2014, the FDA approved fixed- dose (ledipasvir and 
sofosbuvir).  Because rates of SVR are >95% in patients initiating treatment with fixed- dose (ledipasvir and sofosbuvir), all 
newly enrolled subjjects w ill initiate treatment with this regimen.  It is likely that our  intens ive models  of care will be 
generalizab le to IFN-sparing regimens  which  include only oral therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  We recognize that HCV  treatment  has 
been greatly simplified,  but issues  with adherence,  resistanc e, side effec ts, and cost will remain.  
D.10.  Data  sources and collection.  
D.10.1.  Overview . Sources of data will include: blood and urine tests,  participant  interviews,  medi cal 
charts,  staff activity and expense logs,  direct  observation of staff,  and electronic  adherence  monitors  (Table 3). 
D.10.2.  Research  visits.  Research visits  will occur at baseline, then every  [ADDRESS_139283] 12 
weeks of treatment, then at week 24 (if necessary),  a “Final Treatment Week visit” will be conducted after the last day 
of treatment, and then post -treatment visits after 4, 12, and 24 weeks , for a total of up to 9  research visits.  
Partic ipants  will receive  $25 for each  visit and an additional  $20 for visits  with blood draws.  
Baseline visit (Table 3).  At baseline we will assess: sociodemographic  and HCV  clinical factors, 
potential  mediating variables  based on the IMB model,  potential  moderators  (inclu ding psychiat ric status, 
substance  use, and unstable housi ng), and additional  psych osocial  factors hypothesized to predict  adher ence. 
The baseli ne visit will take approximately  [ADDRESS_139284] visit and stored for 
  possible  HCV viral load and resista nce testing,  and for future  studies.  
Follow -up visits  (Table 3). Follow  up visits  will occur at weeks  4, 8, 12, and 24 (if necessary). 
Adherence to all medic ations  will be evaluated by [CONTACT_123725]-repor t. Weeks  on treatment  will 
be determined by [CONTACT_123726].  HCV viral load,  virological endpoints,  and resistance 
results  will be obtained by [CONTACT_123727],  if unavailable by [CONTACT_123728].  IMB model  mediators 
will be assessed  at weeks 8 and 12. Potential  moderators  will be assessed  at each monthly  visit.

D. 10.3.  Definitions  of outcome measures.  
Med-ic® or MEMS®  missed  dose a dherence.   For DAA and ribavirin  (if applicable) , adherence will be 
calculated as  Med-ic blister  pack  dose openin gs divided by [CONTACT_123731] d doses  in time interval.  
For example,  Med-ic adher ence for one week  would be X/7Y, where X=number of Med-ic dose openi ngs 
recorded in one week  and Y=number  of doses  prescribed per day.  
HCV  treat ment  completion . Subjects  will be considered to have completed  treatment  if they have 
completed  at least  80% of the plann ed treatment  course (at least  [ADDRESS_139287]  20 
weeks  of 24 week course)  based on response guided therapy  approach.98,115 
Sustained viral response (SVR).  SVR is defined  as undetec table HCV  viral load [ADDRESS_139288] a telaprevir - associa ted 
mutation (any substituti ons at V36, T54, R155,  A156)  at any time point  during  the study, and the specific  
mutation did not exist at baseline.   Subjects  will be cons idered to have new drug resistance  if they have a 
ledipasvir - associa ted mutation  (K24R, M28T/V, Q30E/H/K/L/R , L31V/M/I, and Y93H/N) during  the study, and 
the specific  mutation did not exist at baseline.  Subjects  will be cons idered to have new drug resistance  if they 
have a sofosbuvir - associat ed mutation (S282T ) at any time point  during  the study, and the specific  mutation 
did not exist at baseline .                                                 
Cost.  Costs  of HCV  treatment  will be collected using the same  methods  as in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_123712]  (see 
Section D.1.8  above),  by [CONTACT_123732],  lab tests,  and 
medications  based on Medicare fee schedules.  The cost of the mDOT  intervention will be determined by 
[CONTACT_123733], 
[ADDRESS_139289] of health care services received outside of the study  (emergency 
department  visits,  hospi [INVESTIGATOR_48181], substance abuse treatment)  based on quarterly  patient  self-reports. 
D.10.4.  Data  Sources.  There will be 6 data sources.  Resul ts will not be provided to participant s’ 
medical  providers  unless  particip ants speci fically  request  (in writing)  that study  staff release this information.  
Medical  record.   HCV  viral load and resistance  assays  (if no SVR)  will be obtained when possibl e by 
[CONTACT_123728].  HCV  viral load is measured by [CONTACT_123734]3/4A  assay,  which  is automatically  run on any HCV  viral load which  is 
•2000 IU/m l. Information on treatment  interrupti ons and discontinuation will be obtained from medical  records. 
Blood.  Three  tubes  of blood will be drawn  at weeks  0, and 4, and stored at Einstein’s Clinical Research 
Center  (CRC).  HCV  viral load and resistance  assays will be perfo rmed if not available by [CONTACT_123728].  For 
subjec ts who fail to achieve SVR,  resistance  testing  will be performed  on post-treatment specim en. All  testing  
will be performed  at Montefiore’s  labor atories.   
Urine  toxicology.  Participants  will provide urine specimens  at each  resea rch visit, which will be tested 
for cocaine and opi[INVESTIGATOR_858]  (and pH to ensure  validit y) using  enzyme  multiplied  immunoa ssay techni que. 
Adherence by [CONTACT_123735]  (Med -ic® and MEMS®)  and self-report. 
ADHERENCE TO  DAAs AND RIBAVIRIN will be measured in all three  arms by [CONTACT_123736] 12 weeks of treatment  with an attached  Med-ic® device.  Med-
ic® is an innovative stick-on paper label  for medication blisters that provides  a disposable method to measure 
adherenc e.185 Med-ic® packages yield  99.6%  event  accuracy  (time  of dose removal  correctly  recorded within 
+2 minutes).  This technology  will allow  tracki ng of medication usage  from weekly  blister packs  prepared by [CONTACT_123737].  Blister  packs will  be pre-fitted with labels and electronic  tags,  which  can be recycled up to five 
times  to save  cost.  
In the TAU arm, subjec ts will receive monthly  packages  of 4 blister  packs, deliver ed at their methadone 
clinic by [CONTACT_39137].  Blister  packs will be returned  at research visits for downloading  adherence  data. In the CGT 
arm, subjec ts will receive weekly  blister  packs  at group meetings  and used  packs  will be collected at each 
group.  Unreturned  packs  will be returned at research visits.  
In the mDOT  arm, subjects  will take observed doses  from weekly  blister  packs,  but the packs  will be 
modified to contain only observed doses.  Indivi dual take-home doses will be taken in weekly blister packs given on 
Monday. Blister  packs will be collected weekly.  
SELF-REPO RT ADHEREN CE will be measured  using a modified  ACTG questionnaire,  adapted  for IFN, 
DAAs , and ribavirin,  as well as a single -item visual  analogue scale  (VAS) which  has been shown to 
correlate  well with both pi[INVESTIGATOR_692] s and virological outcomes  in HIV-infected  patients  taking HAAR T.167,168 
Adherence to dietary  recommendati ons will be conducted by 24 hour dietary recall.  Fat content  of each  meal 
will be deter mined with available software  (www .nutritionco .com).  
Participant  surveys.  At baseline and every  research visit, participants  will answer  surveys  using  Audio Computer -
Assisted  Self-Interview  (ACASI)  technology.  The ACASI  system displays  each  question on a computer  monitor  
while  playing  an audio recording of the question.  Participants  enter responses  directly  on the computer,  which  
may result in more  accurate reporting  of sensitive  behavior  than other survey  methods .[ADDRESS_139290], the success  of randomization will be checked by [CONTACT_123738],  CGT  
and TAU groups  on key variables,  such  as age, gender,  ethnicity,  race,  HCV  viral load,  HCV  subtype (1a vs. 
1b), BMI, psychiatric  history, active  drug use, and social  supp ort.[ADDRESS_139291], and categorical  variables  will be compared  using  chi-square or Fisher’s  exact 
tests.  Varia bles that are not equally  distributed will be included in multivariate  models. In primary analysis,  we 
will use the intention- to-treat princip le, which  preserves  the advantages  of a randomized design.  
D.12.1.  Hypotheses for Aim 1. We hypothesize that in the intensive intervention arms,  compared  to 
the control  arm, rates  of adherence,  treatment  completion,  and SVR will be signif icantly higher,  and that rates 
of resista nce will be lower. We further  hypothesize that the proportion  of subjects  in the intensive  models  of 
care arms  who achieve an SVR will be equivalent  to that observed in large  registrat ion trials.  
[ADDRESS_139292], evaluated  at the end of the study.  We will use Chi-square tests  or Fisher’s exact test 
to compare  the proporti on of subjec ts who achieve high adherence  rate (≥ 80%)  complete treatment,  achieve 
SVR,  and develop resistance in the three  arms  (mDOT,  CGT,  and TAU).  If the omnibus  equality  test of 
adherence across  the [ADDRESS_139293]-hoc pairw ise tests  with 
a Bonferroni  adjusted  2-sided alpha = 0.025:  mDOT  vs. control,  and CGT  vs. control.  This strate gy will be 
applied to multivariable logistic  regressions  if any  potential  confounding variables  not equally  distributed 
between the study  arms  at baseline are identifi ed. 
For the analysis  of repeatedly  measured  adherence (using  [ADDRESS_139294]-baseline time points  and adher ence as  
a contin uous measure),  we will apply  mixed  effects  linear model  to test if the [ADDRESS_139295]-hoc pairwise  tests descri bed above.  Concerning  potential  clustering  effects in  the CGT  arm, 
we used pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299] (5 groups)  to examine  whether  clustering  influe nced adheren ce. Between cluster  variation 
was not significant,  as tested  by [CONTACT_123739] a random  effects  repeated-measure ANOVA model.  Clustering  in 
the GCT  arm will be minimal,  and we will not adjust  for it in statistical or power analysis.  
We will also apply  mixed effects  logistic regression to test the signif icance of mDOT  and CGT  on 
repeatedly -measured undetectable HCV  VL throughout  the intervention period,  adjusting  for substance  use. 
Changes  in illicit drug use will be analyzed  using  urine toxico logy data from each  visit, counting the “person-  
month”  as a unit of analysis,  and analyzing  the proportion of person -months  that are positive  for use of illicit 
drugs  using  a chi-square analysis.  
As seconda ry analyses,  we will examine if mDOT  and CGT  effects,  v. TAU, will be mediated by [CONTACT_123740].  We will assess IMB model mediators  of adhere nce at baseline,  and during the intervention,  and 
will analyze changes  in those variables  from the baseline to the intervention period.  The indirect  effects  of IMB 
mediators  will be tested  by [CONTACT_123741]  (mDOT  or CGT)  with and  
without  IMB compo nent(s)  in mixed  effects  models.  Confidence intervals  of the mediated effects  will be 
calculated by [CONTACT_63676][INVESTIGATOR_007],  and mediation assumed if confidence intervals  do not include zero.  
D.12.3.  Hypotheses for Aim 2. We hypothesize that only a minority  (~20%)  of IDUs  will develop 
resistanc e, and that the relationship between adherence and resistance will be quadratic.  
D.12.4.  Analytic plan for Aim 2. The proportion of particip ants (n=150)  who develop resista nce will be 
determined with 95% confidence  interval  (CIs)  calculated using exact  binomial  metho ds. The proportion of 
participant s with resista nce will then be determined within  each of [ADDRESS_139296]  odds of resistance. Potent ial covariat es will be 
entered  in regression  models  if found by [CONTACT_123742] (p<0.2)  with resist ance. 
D.12.5.  Hypotheses for Aim 3. We hypothesize that the total cost of delivering  the CGT  interv ention 
will be lower  than delivering  the mDOT  intervention,  and that the incremental  cost-effectiveness  ratios  for CGT 
v. TAU and mDOT  v. TAU will each be less than $100,000/QALY.  
D.12.6.  Cost  and Cost -effectiveness Analyses. To project  future  HCV  costs and life expectancy,  we 
will adapt  to the study  population a computer  simulation  model  of HCV  disease progression  that has been 
developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Linas  based on published data using  empi[INVESTIGATOR_123713].171-172The model is curren tly 
being  upda ted with data on disease progression and resource utiliza tion from a racial ly diverse cohort  of over 
600 HCV -infected  individ uals cared  for at [LOCATION_011] Medical  Center,  an urban  public  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_61735], including 
IDUs  in methadone treatment  and active  IDUs.173 The model  simulates  chronic  HCV  with fibrosis  progression 
through  3 stages  of liver fibrosis  including:  mild to moderate fibrosis,  cirrhosis,  and decompensated cirrhosis. 
At all stages,  HCV  infection is associated with increased resource utilization  and decreased  quali ty of life 
(QOL).136,186- 187  When  HCV  infection  reaches  the stage  of cirrhosis,  individuals  begin  to experience incre ased 
mortality  attributable to liver disease.188  With successful  HCV  therapy,  disease progr ession  halts,  and 
mortality,  resource utilization,  and quality  of life returns  to that of HCV  un-infected individuals.189 HCV -related  
QOL  is stratified  by [CONTACT_123743], and costs of chronic  HCV  care (such  as hospit alizatio ns, ED visits,  and clinic 
visits)  are identified separately  for patients  with and without  cirrhosis  and stratified  by [CONTACT_123744]. 
[ADDRESS_139297]-effec tiveness  of the 3 interventions:  TAU,  mDOT,  and CGT. 
Primary  outcomes  will be projected  life-expectancy,  quality-adjusted  life-expectancy  (QALYs),  lifetime  costs,  and 
incremental  cost-effectiveness  ratios  meas ured in $/QALY.  We will forecast  health and cost outcomes  of each 
intervention for a hypothetical  cohort  of HCV  patients  using baseli ne study  data on fibrosis,  age, sex, and 
alcohol  use, and study  outcome  data for each  intervention including  SVR,  resista nce, and retenti on in care.  We 
will explore the potential  impact  of resistance  mutations  by [CONTACT_123745].  Lifetime  costs  will include the costs of the intervention 
received as well as projected future  costs  of HCV  care depen ding on treatment  effectiveness.  Incremental  cost 
effectiveness  ratios  will be calcul ated for TAU compared to no treatment  and for mDOT  and CGI compared  to 
the next most expensive intervention,  with costs and QALYs  discounted  at 3% annually  accordi ng to standa rd 
practice .173 The resulti ng ratios  will be compared  to a thres hold of $[ADDRESS_139298] sensitivity  analyses  on key input  variables  (e.g. 
probability  of SVR and intervention cost)  and probabilis tic sensitivity  analyses  (PSAs)  using second  order  
Monte Carlo  simulation  on multiple  variables.176 For PSAs  we will perfo rm 1,000 simulations  of a cohort  of 
100,000 individuals.  The result  will be a distribu tion of 1,000 model -based  outcomes  with a median and inter- 
quartile  range that reflec ts underlying  uncertainty  in critical model  parameters.  
D.13  Power considerations Assuming  a conse rvative  attrition  rate of 20%,  [ADDRESS_139299]-hoc pair-wise tests is powered to be rejected by [CONTACT_123746]. 
Adherence.  Based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299],  if we cons ervatively assume that 80% of subjects in both mDOT 
and CGT  arms  will achieve >80% adherence (v. 50% in the TAU arm),  we will have >87%  power  to find a 
statistically  significant  difference.  With the application of mixed -effects  logistic  regression to the repeatedly 
measured  binary  adherence outcome,  power  will be greater  than 87% no matter  how large  the within-subject 
outcome  correlation  or intraclass  correlation  (ICC).  
In our previous  DOT  study,  mean adherence  in the mDOT  group  was 87% (SD=12 %, n=21),  and mean 
adherence in the TAU group was 77% (SD=20 %, n=19)  which  translates  into a standardized effect size or 
Cohen’s  d = 0.6. Based on this effect  size, the power  of the mixed  effects  linear  model  for the repeatedly 
measured  continuous  adherence outcome  will be greater  than 90%, even if anticipa ted ICC is as high as 0.5. 
Treatment  completion.  Based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299],  if we assume treatment  completion rates  of 85% in 
CGT,  60% in mDOT,  and 50% in TAU,  we will have >80%  power  to detect  this difference.  
SVR.  We anticipate  that SVR rates  in the mDOT  and CGT  arms  will be 70%,  and <40% in the TAU 
arm.13,70,82  The statis tical power  will be >80%.  These  are conservative  estimates  of effect  sizes, as actual  effect 
sizes  will likely  be larger  because regimens  now contain telaprevir  which  is taken  3x daily.  Effects size for fixed -
dose (ledipasvir and sofosbuvir) is likely to be lower.  
Resistance.  We estimate  that 16% of intervention arm subjects  v. 30% of TAU subjects  will develop 
resistanc e. We are underpowered to detect  this difference,  and consid er this an exploratory  analysis.  
Effectiveness  of intensive  models  of care.  We will determine the proportion (and 95% CI) of subjects  in 
each of the intensive intervention arms  to achieve SVR,  and compare  to results  from large  registration  trials.  
D.14.  Limitations.  In addition to the considera tions noted  in Section D., our results  may not be generalizable to 
HCV -infected  drug users not enrolled  in methadone clinics. However,  we believe  that the intensive  models  we are 
testing,  if efficaci ous, can and should be adop ted in diverse settings  and populati ons.

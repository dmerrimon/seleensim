TITLE OF STUDY: An Open -label, Randomized, Multicenter, Phase 3 Study to Compare the 
Immunogenicity, Efficacy, and S afety of Gan & Lee Pharmaceuticals Insulin Glargine Injection to L antus® 
(Insulin Glargine Injectio n) in Adult Subjects with Type 2  Diabetes M ellitus   
STUDY  CENTERS : Approximately  65 sites are  planned in  the [LOCATION_002]   
STUDY  PERIOD : Subjects randomized to the Gan & Lee  
Insulin Glargine Injection group and the Lantus® group will 
receive treatment for 26  weeks.  PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT : Phase 3 
PLANNED STUDY  DATES:  The study start ed in 2017 and is expected to end in 2019  
OBJECTIVES:  
Primary Objective:  
• To evaluate equivalence  of Gan & Lee I nsulin Glargine Injection and Lantus® in terms of 
immunogenicity  
 
Secondary Objectives:  
• Immunogenicity: To evaluate the percentage of subjects with negative anti-insulin antibodies ( AIA) 
at baseline  who develop confirmed positive AIA up to visit Week 26, the percentage of subjects 
with at least a 4 -fold increase in titer s compared to baseline value , mean change from baseline in 
AIA titers between treatment groups, the percentage of subjects with confirmed  positive  AIA who 
develop any anti -insulin neutralizing antibodies up to  visit Week 26 , and the percentage of subjects 
in each treatment group with confirmed positive AIA up to visit Week 26  
• Safety: To evaluate the safety o f Gan & Lee  Insulin Glargine Injection in comparison with that of 
Lantus® 
• Efficacy: To evaluate the efficacy of Gan & Lee I nsulin Glargine Injection in comparison with that 
of Lantus® 
 
Exploratory Objective:  
• To investigate the retrospective hypoglycemic rate and time in hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia 
using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data  
STUDY DESIG N AND METHODOLOGY: The purpose of this equivalence study is to compare the 
immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy of Gan  & Lee I nsulin Glargine Injection with that of  the reference 
medicinal product, Lantus®, in adult  subjects  with type 2  diabetes mellitus.  
At the s creening visit, subjects will sign the  informed consent form  (ICF), they will be screened for 
eligibility,  and the following information will be collected: adverse events, medical history (including 
diabetes mellitus and thyroid disease history), prior and concomitant medications , vital signs, height, body 
weight, and body mass index ( BMI ). The following procedures will be performed: 1 2-lead electrocardiogram 
(ECG), physical examination, and blood collection  for fasting blood glucose  (FBG)  test, glycosylated 
hemoglobin (HbA1 c), AIA,  routine hematology and chemistry testing (complete blood count, metabolic 
chemistry panel  with serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] , thyroid -stimulating hormone [TSH] , and free thyroxine [T4]). A 
urinalysis , and for women  of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be performed. At this visit, 
the subject will be issued a glucometer, test strips, and other supplies, and the Investigator or designee will 
provide instruction and conduct training on how to use the glucometer for prospective capi[INVESTIGATOR_30330] a prospective manner. Subjects will be allowed to 
keep the glucometer after the study, per local ethical and legal guidelines and regulations. Subjects will also 
receive a Hypoglycemic Events Record in which they will record information about any hypoglycemic 
events that o ccur during their participation in the study. At this visit, the subject will have an Abbott 
FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitoring System sensor applied to the back of the upper arm. The 
sensor, which calibrates itself during the first [ADDRESS_29672] will also be issued a Mealtime & Insulin Dose Rec ord for the 
4
 
   Protocol No. GL -GLAT2-3002  
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine vs Lantus® in Adults with Type [ADDRESS_29673] bag; if the end of the 8 -day 
continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) period coincides with the date of the randomization visit, the sensor 
can be removed at the visit  by [CONTACT_6624] . The information obtained through CGM will have no direct impact 
on treatment advice and is intended for research purposes only. S ubjects will bring both their Hypoglycemic 
Events Record and their Mealtime & Insulin Dose Record to the randomization visit. Between the screening and randomization visits, subjects already taking basal insulin will have their insulin dose optimized based  
on their fasting glucose results, and will also have any appropriate adjustments in their o ther antidiabetes 
medication (OAM) dosing that may be required because of the optimization of their insulin dosing. Subjects not currently on insulin will have thei r OAM dosing optimized in preparation for starting basal insulin 
therapy.
 
Subjects who meet the study eligibility criteria will be centrally randomized 1:1 in an open -label fashion to 
receive either Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection or Lantus® for [ADDRESS_29674] (IP)  for their basal  insulin. 
Subjects not currently taking insulin will co ntinue their OAMs, will add IP, and will have the dosing 
optimize d. 
The Sponsor will ensure that all insulins will be provided to all subjects regardless of medical insurance or 
reimbursement issues. This applies to the non -study insulins and this should be discussed with the Study 
Monitor . 
At the randomization visit (V isit 2) , subjects will receive a supply of insulin pens with IP. The Investigator or 
designee will train the subject on all study procedures and proper dose administration.  
All subjects will attend 9 clinic visits (the screening  visit, the randomization visit, and visits at Weeks  2, 4, 8, 
12, 16, 20, and 26) , 2 brief visits during which  a CGM sensor will be applied (8 -10 days before the visits at 
Weeks 12  and 26), and they will be contact[CONTACT_30354] 6, 10, 14, 18, and 22 . The Week 2 6 
visit (Visit 9) will be the end -of-treatment  visit.  
At all visits and phone contacts  (except for visits to apply a  CGM sensor) , the Investigator or designee will 
review glucose results  (especially focusing on hypoglycemia ), adverse events, changes in concomitant 
medications, and changes in IP, bolus  insulin , and OAM  use. At all study  visits, the following procedures 
will be performed: vital signs, body weight, urinalysis, urine pregnancy testing for women of childbearing 
potential, and an FBG  test. 
Additional procedures at study visits are as follows: at Weeks 8, 16, and 26, blood for HbA1 c will be 
collected; at Weeks 12 and 26, subjects will wear their CGM sensor to the site for the staff to safely remove it; they will bring their Mealtime & Insulin  Dose Record for the site staff to review, and blood will be 
collected for routine hematology and chemistry, TSH, and free T4; at Weeks 12 and 26, blood will be collected for AIA; and at Week 26, a [ADDRESS_29675] discontinues the study prematurely (early termination – ET), site personnel will make a 
reasonable effort to perform all study activities scheduled for Visit 9 (EOT visit). Additionally, it is also very 
important for site personnel to encourage  subjects to visit the site at Week 26 + 4 weeks (and Week 12 + 1 
week, if applicable) when blood samples can be obtained for the AIA and HbA1 c measurements.  
Site personnel will contact [CONTACT_30355] 30 days after study completion  to query 
for serious adverse event information only.

NUMBER OF SUBJECTS: Enrollment is planned for 5 50 subjects overall (2 75 subjects per treatment 
group). The primary analysis for immunogenicity will be 2  one-sided equivalence tests with α=0.05 . This 
sample size was chosen to achieve over 80% power on the equivalence test of proportion of subjects under 
the margins dependent on the observed treatment -induced AIA rate . Sample size calculations were 
performed using EAS T Version 6.4 . 
STUDY TREATMENT(S):  Test Product, Dose and Mode of Administration: Gan & Lee  Insulin 
Glargine Injection solution for s ubcutaneous injection, 100 U/mL , in the integrated,  disposable 3.0-mL pre -
filled  Gan & Lee in jector  pen 
Reference Therapy, Dose and Mode of Administration: Lantus® (insulin glargine injection) solution for 
subcutaneous injection, 100 U/mL , in the SoloStar® 3-mL pre-filled insulin pen  
Lantus® contains insulin glargine, an insulin analog, and has a prolonged duration of action. Lantus® and Gan 
& Lee Insulin Glargine should be administered once daily at any time but at the same time each day. To be 
consistent with current Lantus® labeling, twice -daily dosing of IP is strictly prohibited. The dose regimen 
(dose and timing) should be individually adjusted. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, Lantus® and Gan 
& Lee Insulin Glargine Injection can also be given together with OAMs .  
DURATION OF TREATMENT:  Subjects in both  group s will receive study treatment for  26 weeks

Exploratory Endpoints  
• Retrospective CGM hypoglycemic rate  
• Time in hypoglycemia  and hyperglycemia  
STATISTICAL METHODS:  
The primary analysis for immunogenicity will be an equivalence test using the 2 one -sided tests (TOST) 
approach with α=0.[ADDRESS_29681] of difference in proportions based on normal approximation (- margin, 
+margin) where the margin is dependent on the observed treatment -induced AIA rate in Lantus® . The 
estimand of interest on the immunogenicity analysis is the difference in treatment -induced AIA rates regardless 
if all subjects tolerate or adhere to study treatment o r receive other insulin treatments. Intercurrent events will 
be handled according to the treatment policy strategy. Treatment policy strategy is defined as  the strategy that 
considers  “The occurrence of the intercurrent event is irrelevant: the value for the variable of interest is used 
regardless of whether or not the intercurrent event occurs” (ICH E9 R1 ) addendum.  The key secondary analysis 
will be to evaluate equivalence (FDA)/noninferiority (EMA) of Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection relative 
to Lant us® for HbA1 c by [CONTACT_17921] 90% confidence interval  (CI) (-0.4%, 0.4%) for equivalence using the 
TOST approach and by [CONTACT_30357] 95% CI with 0.4% from a pattern mixture model that 
uses multiple imputation analyzed using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment included as a 
fixed effect and baseline HbA1 c included as a covariate. Separately in each treatment group, the imputation 
will use the outcomes of patients who completed the study (including subjects who discontinued treatment, 
but provided a visit Week 26 HbA1c sample) to impute outcomes in patients without actual visit Week 26 recorded results  under the missing at random assumption. Full details of the multiple imputation procedure 
will be specified in the SAP. Analysis  of HbA1
c will follow a hierarchical testing strategy: first, 
equivalence/noninferiority will be tested with a margin of 0.4%; secondly, if and only if the test using a margin of 0.4% is significant, then equivalence/noninferiority will be tested using a margin of 0.3%. Analyses of 
HbA1
c in the testing hierarchy will be conducted on the Full Analysis Set consisting of all randomized subjects 
according to randomized treatment with supportive analyses on the Per Protocol Analysis Set. A tippi[INVESTIGATOR_30334].  
Categorical variables will be summarized using counts and percentages. Continuous variables will be 
summarized using the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum.  
The secondary immunogenicity variables of the percentage of subjects with negative AIA at baseline who develop confirmed positive AIA up to visit Week [ADDRESS_29682] 
of difference in proportions. The difference in proportions will be estimated along with the corresponding 90% CI using Wald method for risk difference without continuity correction.  The secondary immunogenicity 
variables of the percentage of subjects in each treatment group with confirmed positive AIA at baseline and 
8
 
   Protocol No. GL -GLAT2-3002  
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine vs Lantus® in Adults with Type [ADDRESS_29683] of difference in proportions. The difference in proportions will be estimated along with the 
corresponding 90% CI in the Safety Analysis Set. The exact confidence limits are computed by [CONTACT_24518] [ADDRESS_29684] tests that are based on the score statistic.  The mean change from baseline in each 
treatment g roup in AIA titers after baseline and up to visit Week 26 will be tabulated descriptively . 
Safety variables will be summarized descriptively in the Safety Analysis Set consisting of all randomized  
subjects according to actual treatment received. All reported adverse events will be assigned a system organ class and preferred term according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities and graded according to Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03. The number and percentage of subjects  with 
adverse events (all adverse events, hypoglycemia, serious adverse events [including fatal], adverse events leading to termination of study treatment and/or early withdrawal from the study, IP -related adverse events, 
and injection site reactions) will  be presented. Vital signs, body weight and BMI, ECG, and laboratory 
results will be summarized by [CONTACT_10659].  
The secondary efficacy variables of number and percentage of subjects achieving a HbA1
c value <  7.0% at 
visit Week [ADDRESS_29685] result of ≤ 8.0 mmol/L 
(≤ 144.0 mg/dL) in each treatment group will be compared using a test of difference of proportions based on 
the normal approximation and CIs.  
The retrospective CGM hypoglycemic rate and time in hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia will be 
summarized for subjects in the Safety Analysis Set.

6. INTRODUCTION
6.1 Disease Review  
Diabetes is a chronic, progressive disease that, if inadequately treated, can lead to significant 
morbidity, including macrovascular and microvascular complications, an d significantly 
increased mortality [ 1].  
Type 2 diabetes is characterized by [CONTACT_30361], hyperglycemia, and in the initial stages of the disease, hyperinsulinemia. Even before overt hyperglycemia occurs, dysfunction of the β-cells of the pancreas has been demonstrated. Increased secretion of insulin may for a time 
compensate for insulin resistance, but with progressive loss of β -cell function  or mass, 
production of endogenous insulin decreases [ 2]. 
In addition to comprehensive management of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_30336], the reduction of hyperglycemia is the primary goal of therapy. Initial treatment strategies for 
managing hyperglycemia in patients with type [ADDRESS_29705] exercise and weight loss, and the addition of medications to enhan ce insulin 
sensitivity, such as thiazolidinediones, metformin, and secretagogues. Newer drug classes include glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, sodium- glucose transporter -2 inhibitors, and 
dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors. At some point, many patients may require the addition of basal insulin, either because of difficulty achieving glycemic control despi[INVESTIGATOR_30337] [ 3]. 
6.2 Compound Review  – Insulin Glargine  
Insulin glargine is a biosynthetic insulin analog with a longer duration of action than human insulin. The substitution of glycine for asparagine at A21 and the addition of 2 arginines at the C-terminus of the B chain result in stabilization of the molecule, leading to delayed and prolonged absorption after subcutaneous injection [ 4]. 
6.2.1 Nonc linical Studies  
An extensive characterization and comparison of structural and biofunctional properties of Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine injection and Lantus
® has been conducted [ 5]. The structural 
characterization including primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures; size, hydrophobicity and charge heterogeneities; cell-based biofunctionality including the binding to the r eceptors of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1, and the activation of the insulin-
signaling cascade and the stimulation of glucose uptake were demonstrated to be similar between Gan & Lee Insulin G largine Injection and Lantus
®. For in vitro and in vivo 
pharmacologic and toxicologic studies and clinical studies, reference is made to NDA 021081 [ 4]. 
6.2.[ADDRESS_29706] 
crossover pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], demonstrated bioequivalence of Gan & Lee Insulin G largine Injection 
and [LOCATION_002] (US) -sourced Lantus
®. Although this exploratory study provided a 
statistically robust conclusion of biosimilarity  based on pharmacokinetics, it was not powered 
to provide robust statistical conclusions in terms of pharmacodynamics . Gan & Lee Insulin

Glargine Injection was well tolerated, and treatment- emergent adverse events were 
comparable to those with Lantus®. There were no significant signals that would indicate a 
difference in the safety profile between the treatments. A pi[INVESTIGATOR_30338] I study will be 
performed concurrently to assess the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynami c effects of Gan 
& Lee  Insulin G largine Injection compared with US - and European- sourced Lantus®. 
6.3 Clinical Study  Rationale 
The purpose of this study is to compare Gan & Lee Insulin G largine Injection 100 U/mL with 
Lantus®, [COMPANY_011]-Aventis’ brand of insulin glargine injection 100 U/mL, and evaluate 
equivalence in terms of immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy, in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus . 
Insulin analogs are more costly than conventional insulins, and limited ac cess to affordable 
insulin may keep some patients from accessing important treatment options, leading to unnecessary complications [ 1, 6].  
Biosimilar products may result in significant price reductions compared to the cost of the reference products, even if the reductions are not of the magnitude seen with many generics [ 7]. 
Biosimilar drugs are not identical to the reference product. Because even small differences in the primary structure can result in clinically significant functional differences, there are concerns about potential risks to patients [ 7]. Insulin glargine has been shown to exhibit 
proliferative and anti -apoptotic effects in vitro in color ectal cancer cells; however, clinical 
studies have produced conflicting results regarding an association between insulin glargine and cancer risk [ 8]. And although a number of observational studies in [ADDRESS_29707] cancer after a 
median 5-year follow-up period among those who were insulin-naive. A nonsignificant increase in risk was found among subjects who had switched to insulin glargine from other insulins [ 9]. 
Because biosimilar insulins have immunogenic potential, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the FDA require an evaluation of safety and immunogenicity between biosimilars and their reference products, and the EMA has indicated these studies should be of sufficient 
duration (at least 6 to 12 months) to detect these differences. This study is designed in 
accordance with the guidan ce documents provided by [CONTACT_23357] [ 10] and the FDA [ 11]. 
The immunogenicity assessment will use the one- assay [ 12] and tiered approach [ 13]. 
Samples collected at all time points (including pre -dose) from both treatment groups will first 
be tested using the validated electrochemiluminescence method [ 14]. The rate and degree of 
immunogenicity, and data interpretation will also include consideration of other clinical attributes such as (but not limited to) symptoms of hypersensitivity or injection site reactions and the pharmacokinetic profile.

8. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
8.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
The purpose of this equivalence study is to compare the immunogenicity, safety, and efficacy 
of Gan  & Lee  Insulin Glargine I njection with that of the reference medicinal product, 
Lantus®, in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  
At the screening visit, subjects will sign the informed consent form  (ICF), they will be 
screened  for eligibility, and the following information will be collected: adverse events, 
medical history (including diabetes mellitus and thyroid disease history), prior and 
concomitant medications, vital signs, height, body weight, and body mass index ( BMI ). The 
following procedures will be performed: 12- lead electrocardiog ram (ECG), physical 
examination, and blood collect ion for fasting blood glucose (FBG)  test, HbA1 c, AIA,  routine 
hematology and chemistry testing (complete blood count, metabolic chemistry panel with  
serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] , thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] and free thyroxine [T4]). A urinalysis , and 
for women  of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be performed. At this visit, 
the subject will be issued a glucometer , test strips, and other supplies, and the Investigator or 
designee will provide instruction and conduct training on how to use the glucometer for prospective glucose monitoring to document hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_11630] a prospective manner. Subjects will b e allowed to keep the glucometer  after the study, per local ethical and 
legal guidelines and regulations.
 Subjects will also receive a Hypoglycemic Events Record  in 
which they will record information about any hypoglycemic events that occur during their participation in the study.  
During the [ADDRESS_29708] any appropriate adjustments in their other antidiabetes medication s (OAM ) dosing that 
may be required because of the optimization of the ir insulin dosing. Subjects who are insulin -
naïve will have their OAM dosing optimized to prepare them for starting basal insulin therapy. 
Also , at the screening visit, the subject will have a FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose 
Monitoring sensor  applied to the back of the upper arm accord ing to the manufacturer’s 
instructions.  
The FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Monitoring System is approved by [CONTACT_30362] 
[ADDRESS_29709] will also be issued a Mealtime & 
Insulin Dose Record in which they will record the time of their meals and insulin use. After [ADDRESS_29710] bag provided, and bring it with them to the randomization visit. If the end of the 8-day continuous glucose monitoring (CGM ) period coincides with the date of the randomization visit, the sensor can be removed 
at the visit  by [CONTACT_7893] . Subjects will bring both th eir Hypoglycemic Events Record and 
their Mealtime & Insulin Dose Record to the randomization visit.

Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine vs Lantus® in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes  Amendment 3_ 25 April 2019  
 
 
Subjects who meet the study eligibility criteria will be centrally randomized 1:1 in an open-
label fashion to receive either Gan & Lee Insulin G largine Injection or Lantus® for 26 weeks. 
Subjects currently taking insulin will continue using their OAMs  and will substitute  IP for 
their basal  insulin as described in  Section 8.5.8. Subjects not currently taking basal insulin 
will c ontinue their OAMs, add IP , and undergo insulin dosing optimization and adjustments 
in OAM dosing as needed as described in Section 8.5.8. 
The Sponsor will ensure that all insulins will be provided to all subjects regardless of medical 
insurance or reimbursement issues.   
At the randomization visit (Visit 2), subjects will receive supply of insulin pens with IP  and 
the Investigator or designee will train subjects on all study procedures and proper dose 
administration. 
Subjects in both treatment groups will be assessed every 2 weeks after Visit 2 ( randomization 
visit) through Week 22 ( telephone call ) and then at Week 26; they will attend 9 clinic visits 
(the s creening visit, the randomization visit, and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 26) , 2 brief 
visits during which a CGM sensor will be applied (8 -10 days before the visits at Weeks 12 
and 26), and they will be contact[CONTACT_30354] 6, 10, 14, 18, and 22. T he Week 
26 visit (Visit 9) will be the end-of- treatment  visit . 
At all visits and phone contacts (except for visits to apply a CGM sensor) the Investigator or 
designee will review glucose results (especially looking for hypoglycemia), adverse events,  
changes in concomitant medications, and changes in IP , bolus insulin, and OAM use. At all 
study visits, the following procedures will be performed: vital signs, body weight, urinalysis, 
urine pregnancy testing for women of childbearing potential, and an FBG test. 
Additional procedures at study visits are as follows: at Weeks 8, 16, and 26, blood for HbA1 c 
will be collected; during the visits at Weeks 12  and 26, subjects will wear their  CGM sensors 
to the site for the site staff to safely remove it, and they will bring their Mealtime & Insulin Dose Record  for the site staff to review , and, blood will be collected for routine hematology 
and chemistry , TSH, free T4, and AIA testing; and at Week 26, a 12- lead ECG and physical 
examination will be performed . Figure [ADDRESS_29711] discontinues the study prematurely, site personnel will make a reasonable effort 
to perform all study activities scheduled for Visit 9 (end of treatment [ EOT] visit). 
Additionally, it is very important for site personnel to encourage subjects to visit the site at Week 26 (± 4 weeks) (and Week 12 ± 1 week if applicable) for a blood sample to be obtained for AIA and HbA1
c measurements.

8.2 Discussion of Study Design  
This open- label study is designed to evaluate Gan & Lee Insulin G largine Injection compared 
with that of Lantus® in subjects with type 2 diabetes to determine equivalence. Subjects will 
continue using their bolus insulin (which should not be changed for the duration of the study, 
with the exception of a dose change) and will substitute  IP for their basal  insulin. Subjects 
not currently using a basal insulin will add IP to their treatment.

[IP_ADDRESS] Hypoglycemia 
The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia may change with a change of insulin regimen, 
depending on the action profile of the insulins used. Because Lantus® has a more sustained 
basal insulin supply, fewer nocturnal but more frequent early morning epi[INVESTIGATOR_30342]. Particular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable for subjects in whom hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_30343], such as subjects with significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of cardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycemia), and for subjects with proliferative retinopathy, particularly if they have not been treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following hypoglycemia). 
Subject adherence to the prescribed medication, diet, and exercise regimens; correct insulin 
administration; and awareness of symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. The prolonged effect of subcutaneous insulin glargine may delay recovery from hypoglycemia. If normal or decreased HbA1
c values are noted, the Investigator should 
consider the possibil ity of recurrent, unrecognized (especially nocturnal) epi[INVESTIGATOR_30344]. 
Investigators will advise each subject about circumstances in which warning symptoms of 
hypoglycemia may be different, diminished, or absent, and that hypoglycemia (and possibl e 
loss of consciousness) may occur before the subject is aware of any symptoms.  
Some factors that may increase the susceptibility to hypoglycemia and require particularly close monitoring and possible dose adjustment include: 
• Markedly improved glycemic control after starting the study treatment 
• A known tendency to gradually develop hypoglycemia 
• Older subject age 
• Switching from animal insulin to human insulin 
• Autonomic neuropathy 
• A long history of diabetes 
• Psychiatric illness  
• A change in the site of injectio n from one body area to another 
• Conditions that may improve insulin sensitivity such as decreased stress 
• Unusual, increased, or prolonged physical activity

• Inadequate intake of food and/or liquids 
• Missed meals  
• Alcohol consumption 
• Uncompensated endocrine disorders such as hypothyroidism, anterior pi[INVESTIGATOR_30345]  
• Concomitant medications that may enhance the blood glucose- lowering effect and

8.6.2 FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash  Glucose Monitoring System  
The FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitori ng System is a glucose-monitoring device 
indicated for detecting trends and tracking patterns in persons (age 18 and older) with 
diabetes.  
The FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitoring System aids in understanding the person’s  glucose profile and detecting  epi[INVESTIGATOR_30346].  
Interpretation of the FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitoring System readings will be based o n the trends and patterns analyzed through time using the reports available. 
The FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitoring  System consists of a sensor with an 
applicator, and reader that is used to start the sensor on the subject and gather the glucose 
data at the end of the CGM period. The s ensor has a small, flexible filament  that is ins erted 
just under the skin. The s ensor can be worn for up to [ADDRESS_29733] a single reader that will  be used for all 
their subjects. R eadings from the FreeStyle Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitoring System will 
not be made available to s ubjects in real time and so they will continue performing glucose 
self-testing with the glucometer according to the Investigator’s instructions. The FreeSty le 
Libre Pro Flash Glucose Monitoring System will be used for data collection purposes only and will not be used to make treatment  decisions. The s ystem does not requir e any subject 
action . 
At the screening visit and between 8  and 10 days before the visits at Weeks 12  and 26, 
subjects will attend a brief visit so the Investigator or designee can apply a CGM sensor to the back of the upper arm  according to the instructions in the FreeStyle Libre Pro User 
Guide. Subjects will also receive a Mealtime & Insulin  Dose Record in which they will 
record the time of meals and insulin doses for the 8-day CGM period. 
Eight days after the screening visit, the subject may remove the sensor and will bring it to the 
randomization visit in a provided biohazard bag ; if the en d of the 8-day CGM period 
coincides with the date of the randomization visit, the sensor can be removed at the visit by [CONTACT_6624] . Subjects will bring both their Hypoglycemic Events Record and their Mealtime & 
Insulin Dose Record to the randomization visi t.

or designee will use the reader to retrieve the data from the sensor, and the 8-day M ealtime & 
Insulin Dose Record  will be collected and reviewed. The data from the sensor does not need 
to be uploaded at the time of the visit, but the Investigator will retain each sub ject’s  sensor 
until it is confirm ed the data have been successfully uploaded.  Each sensor will be labeled 
with the subject and visit number and will be stored in a secure location until the end of the 
study after confirmation of successful upload.

12. DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
The data management and statistical analysis of this study will be performed by [CONTACT_30371].  
12.1 Data Management 
An e lectronic clinical database (Medidata Solutions) will be us ed and a Data Management 
Plan will be prepared by [CONTACT_30372]. 
Previous and concomitant medications will be coded using the latest available WHO Drug Reference Dictio nary. Coexistent diseases and adverse events will be coded using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA).  
When the data base has been declared to be complete and accurate, the database will be 
locked. Any changes to the database after that time can be made only by [CONTACT_30373] & Lee  Pharmaceuticals  [LOCATION_003] and PRA Health Sciences. 
12.2 Sample Size Estimation  
Enrollm ent is planned for 550 subjects overall (275 subjects per treatment group). The 
primary analysis for immunogenicity will be an equivalence test using the 2 one- sided tests 
(TOST) approach with α=0.05. This  sample size was chosen to achieve over 80%  power on 
the equivalence test of proportion of subjects under the margins dependent on the observed treatment- induced AIA rate . For example, a sample size of 550 will provide approximately 
85% power on the equivalence test of proportion of subjects with t reatment -induced AIA 
using an event rate of 30% and a margin of 12% ( Table  4). The treatment -induced AIA is 
defined as newly  confirmed positive AIA develo pment or important ( at least a 4 -fold) 
increase in  AIA titers, after baseline and up to visit Week 26. For this sample size of 550, no 
dropouts are considered in the calculation. Subjects will be encouraged to come back for assessments even if they have discontinued treatment  early . 
The similarity margin, based on the actual observed event rate for the intended reference product, will be used f or final analysis after database lock as summarized in Table 4. Linear 
interpolation will be used for values between AIA rates in the table.

12.3 Statistical Analysis Plan  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be written and finalized prior to any lock of the study 
database. The SAP will provide a detailed description of the statistical methods and expand on the details provided in the protocol. Additional analyses may be added. Table, listing and figures shells will also be provided. 
12.4 Randomization 
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Gan & Lee Insulin G largine Injection or 
Lantus
® treatment.  
Registration and randomization will take place using a centralized IXRS. At registration, the 
IXRS will assign a unique subject identification number that will be used on all of that subject’s eCRFs and serious adverse event  report forms.  
The study is not blinded. However, to avoid the introduction of operational bias into final study results and to increase the interpretability and reliability of the data , certain roles of  the 
Sponsor and study team will be blinded. Details will be provide d in the Data Blinding and 
Documentation of Aggregate Data Dissemination Plan (hereafter referred to as the Blinding Plan).

12.5 Analysis Sets 
12.5.1 Safety Analysis Set  
The Safety Analysis Set is composed  of all randomized subjects who receive any IP , even a 
partial dose ( Gan & Lee Insulin G largine Injection or Lantus®). Subjects in the Safety 
Analysis Set will be grouped according to the treatment they actually received. All safety  and 
immunogenicity endpoints will be analyzed using the Safety Analysis Set.  
12.5.2 Full Anal ysis Set   
The Full  Analysis Set (FAS) is composed  of all randomized subjects. Subjects in the FAS 
will be grouped according to planned treatment. All efficacy endpoints will be analyzed 
using the FAS based on the subject’s randomized treatment . 
12.5.3 Per Protoco l Set 
The Per Protocol (PP) Analysis Set is composed of all randomized subjects who received at least [ADDRESS_29755] 
26 weeks of the study. Subjects in the PP Analysis Set will be grouped a ccording to actual 
treatment received. The PP Analysis Set will be used for sensitivity analyses of confirmed positive AIA and HbA1c and demography summary. 
12.6 Statistical Methods  
In general, categorical variables will be summarized using counts and percentages. 
Continuous variables will be summarized using the number of observations (n), mean, and standard  deviation, median, minimum 25

approach with α=0.05, which is algebraically equivalent to comparing the limits of the 90% 
confidence interval (CI) for treatment-induced AIA development via a test of difference in 
proportions based on normal approximation  to (-margin, +margin) where the margin is 
dependent on the observed treatment-induced AIA rate in Lantus® and is defined in Table 4. 
The estimand of interest for the primary immunogenicity analysis is the difference in 
treatment-induced AIA rates regardless if all subjects tolerate or adhere to study treatment  or 
receive ot her insulin treatments . Intercurrent events will be handled according to the 
treatment policy strategy. Treatment Policy strategy is defined as the strategy that considers “The occurrence of the intercurrent event is irrelevant: the value for the variable of interest is used regardless of whether or not the intercurrent event occurs” (See  ICH E9 R1 addendum 
[16]). Sensitivity analys es including worst -case imputation and using a ‘Composite Strategy’ 
will be conducted. 
12.8 Key Secondary Endpoint  
12.8.1 Change from Baseline in HbA1
c at 26 Weeks 
The key secondary analysis will be to evaluate equivalence (FDA)/noninferiority (EMA) of 
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine Injection relative to Lantus® for HbA1 c by [CONTACT_17921] 90% 
CI with (- 0.4%, 0.4%) for equivalence using the TOST approach and by [CONTACT_30375] 95% CI with 0.4% for noninferiority from a pattern mixture model that  uses 
multiple imputation analyzed using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment included as a fixed effect and baseline HbA1
c included as a covariate. Separately in each 
treatment group, the imputation will use the outcomes of patients who complete d the study 
(including the subjects who discontinued treatment, but provided a visit Week 26 HbA1 c 
sample) to impute outcomes in patients without actual visit Week 26 recorded results under the missing at random assumption. Full details of the multiple imputation procedure will be specified in the SAP. Analysis of HbA1
c will follow a hierarchical testing strategy: first, 
equivalence/noninferiority will be tested with a margin of 0.4%; secondly, if and only if the 
test using a margin of 0.4% is significant, then equivalence/noninferiority  will be tested using 
a margin of 0.3%. Analyses of HbA1 c in the testing hierarchy will be conducted on the Full 
Analysis Set consisting of all randomized subjects according to randomized treatment with 
supportive analyses on the Per Protocol Analysis Set. A tippi[INVESTIGATOR_30351]. The estimand of interest for the HbA1

Investigator and to the IRB(s)/IEC(s). 
15.2 Protocol Amendments  
In accordance with ICH E6 Guideline for GCP the Investigator should not implement any deviation from, or changes to the protocol without agreement by [CONTACT_30382]/IECs of a protocol amendment, except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to study subjects, or when the change(s) involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the study (e.g., change in monitor(s), change of 
telephone number(s)).  
Any change to the protocol must be handled as a protocol amendment. Any potential amendment must be approved by [CONTACT_1034]. A written amendment must be submitted to the appropriate regulatory authorities and to the IRB/IECs assuming this responsibility. The 
Investigator must await IRB/IEC approval of protocol amendments before implementing the 
changes, except where necessary to eliminate apparent im mediate hazard to subject s. In these 
cases, the IRB/IEC  must be notified within [ADDRESS_29770] be approved in writing by [CONTACT_30383]/IEC , except for administrative amendments, which require 
notification but not written approval. Once approved, the protocol amendment will be distributed to all recipi[INVESTIGATOR_29614], with instructions to append the amendment to the protocol. 
If, in the judgment of the loc al IRB/IEC, the Investigator and/or Sponsor, the protocol 
amendment alters the study design, procedures and/or increases the potential risk to the 
subject, the currently approved written ICF  will require modification. The modified ICF  must 
also be reviewed  and approved by [CONTACT_1034], appropriate regulatory authorities, and the 
IRB/IEC . In such cases, repeat informed consent must be obtained from subject s enrolled in 
the study before participation continues.

17. APPENDICES  
17.1 Appendix 1: Declaration of Helsinki  
WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF HELSINKI  
Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects  
Adopted by [CONTACT_941] 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964, and amended by [CONTACT_941]:  
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October [ADDRESS_29777], Republic of South Africa, October 1996  
52nd WMA General Assembly, Edinburgh, Scotland, October 2000 
53th WMA General Asse mbly, Washington 2002 (Note of Clarification on paragraph 29 added)  
55th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo 2004 (Note of Clarification on Paragraph 30 added)  
59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, October 2008  
A. INTRODUCTION 
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a 
statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including 
research on identifiable human material and data.  The Declaration is intended to be read as a 
whole and each of its constituent paragraphs should not be applied without consideration of all other relevant paragraphs.  
2. Although the Declaration is addressed primarily to physicians, the WMA encourages other participants in medical research involving human subjects to adopt t hese principles.  
3. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health of patients, including those who are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty. 
4. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The health 
of my patient will be my first consideration,” and the International Code of Medical Ethics declares that, “A physician shall act in the patient's best interest when  providing medica l 
care.”  
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving human subjects. Populations that are underrepresented in medical research should be provided appropriate access to participation in research. 
6. In medical research involving human subjects, the well-being of the individual research 
subject must take precedence over all other interests.  
65
 
   Protocol No. GL -GLAT2-3002  
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine vs Lantus® in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes  Amendment 3_ 25 April 2019  
 
 
7. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the 
causes, development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and  
therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best current  
interventions must be evaluated continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and q uality. 
8. In medical practice and in medical research, most interventions involve risks and burdens. 
9. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote respect for all human  subjects 
and protect their health and rights. Some research populat ions are particularly  vulnerable and 
need special protection. These include those who cannot give or refuse consent for 
themselves and those who may be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence. 
10. Physicians should consider the ethical, legal and regulatory norms and standards for 
research involving human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international 
norms and standards. No national or international ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research  subjects set forth in this 
Declaration.  
B. PRINCIPLES FOR ALL MEDICAL RESEARCH  
11. It is the duty of physicians who participate in medical research to protect the life, health,  
dignity, integrity, right to self -determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal 
information of research subjects.  
12. Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted scientific principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other relevant sources of information, and adequate laboratory and, as appropriate, animal experimentation. The welfare of animals used for research must be respected.  
13. Appropriate caution must be exercised in the conduct of medical research that may harm the environment. 
14. The design and performance of each research study involving human subjects must be 
clearly described in a research protocol. The protocol should contain a statement of the ethical considerations involved and should indicate how the principles in this Declaration have been addressed. The protocol should include information regarding funding, Sponsors, 
institutional affiliations, other potential conflicts of interest,  incentives for subjects and 
provisions for treating and/or compensating subjects who a re harmed as a consequence of 
participation in the research study. The protocol should describe arrangements for post -study 
access by [CONTACT_30387].  
15. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and approval to a research ethics committee before the study begins. This committee must  be 
independent of the researcher, the Sponsor and any other undue influence. It must take into 
66
 
   Protocol No. GL -GLAT2-3002  
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine vs Lantus® in Adults with Type [ADDRESS_29778] be 
adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of 
67
 
   Protocol No. GL -GLAT2-3002  
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine vs Lantus® in Adults with Type [ADDRESS_29779]’s freely -given  informed consent, preferably in writing. If the 
consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non-written consent must be formally documented and witnessed. 
25. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, physicians must normally 
seek consent for the collection, analysis, storage and/or reuse. There may be situations where consent would be impossible or impractical to obtain for such research  or would pose a threat 
to the validity of the research. In such situations the research may be done only after consideration and approval of a research ethics committee.  
26. When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician should be particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may consent under duress. In such situations the informed consent should be sought by [CONTACT_30388].  
27. For a potential research subject who is incompetent, the physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorized representative. These individuals must not be included in a research study that has no likelihood of benefit for them unless it is intended to promote the health of the population represented by [CONTACT_11275], the research cannot instead be 
performed with competent persons, and the research  entails only minimal risk and minimal 
burden. 
28. When a potential research subject who is deemed incompetent is able to give assent to  
decisions about participation in research, the physician must seek that assent in addition to 
the consent of the legally authorized representative. The potential subject’s dissent should be 
respected.  
29. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, 
for example, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that prevents giving informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research population. In such circumstances the physician should seek informed consent  from the legally authorized 
representative. If no such representative is availab le and if the research cannot be delayed, 
the study may proceed without informed consent provided that the specific reasons for involving subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study has been approved by a research ethics 
68
 
   Protocol No. GL -GLAT2-3002  
Gan & Lee Insulin Glargine vs Lantus® in Adults with Type [ADDRESS_29780] current proven intervention, except in the following circumstances:  
• The use of placebo, or no treatment, is acceptable in studies where no current  proven 
intervention exists; or  
• Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of 
placebo is necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention and the patients who receive placebo or no treatment will not be subject to any risk of serious or irreversible harm. Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option. 
33. At the conclusion of the study, patients entered into the study are entitled to be informed 
about the outcome of the study and to share any benefits that result from it, for example, access to interventions identified as beneficial in the study or to other appropriate care or benefits.  
34. The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of the care are related to the  
research. The refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s decision to  
withdraw from the study must never interfere with the patient- physician relationship.  
35. In the treatment of a patient, where proven interventions do not exist or have been ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert advice, with informed consent from the patient or a legally authorized representative, may use an unproven intervention if in the physician's judgement it offers hope of saving life, re- establishing health or alleviating  suffering.

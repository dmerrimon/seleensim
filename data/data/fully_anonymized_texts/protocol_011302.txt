TITLE Open-Label Extension Study of EFC12492, R727-CL-1112, EFC12732, & 
LTS11717 Studies to Assess the Long-Term Safety and Efficacy of 
Alirocumab in Patients with Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia 
INVESTIGATOR/TRIAL LOCATION Multinational - Multicenter 
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT Phase 3 
STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary objective 
x To assess the long-term safety of alirocumab when added to currently available lipid-modifying drug therapy in patients with 
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (heFH) who have 
completed one of the following studies: EFC12492, R727-CL-1112, 
EFC12732 & LTS11717. 
Secondary objectives 
x To evaluate the long-term efficacy of alirocumab on lipid parameters.  
x To evaluate the long term immunogenicity of alirocumab. 
STUDY DESIGN This is a Phase 3, open-label extension (OLE), uncontrolled study. 
Patients must have been diagnosed with heFH in the parent study and have 
completed one of the four randomized, double-blind, 18-month parent studies. 
Patients who missed the last injection or who performed the end of treatment 
visit outside the expected timelines can also be enrolled. 
The end of treatment visit of the Double-Blind Treatment Period of the parent 
study corresponds to the visit 1 (Day 1) of the OLE study, except for the 
patients having participated in the LTS11717. These latter patients will have 
the opportunity to enter the OLE study, after they have completed the parent 
study, including the 8 week follow-up period. Patients who meet eligibility 
criteria at the visit 1 (Day 1) will receive a first SC injection of alirocumab on 
that day.  
All patients will receive 75 mg Q2W at entry into the OLE, with the exception 
of patients from EFC12732 (ODYSSEY High-FH). These latter patients, who 
had a screening LDL-C ≥160 mg/dL in the parent study, will hence receive 
150 mg Q2W at entry into the OLE, as in the parent study. 
At entry in the OLE (at visit 1 on Day 1): 
x All eligible patients from EFC12732 will get the alirocumab dose 
[ADDRESS_523263] SC injection of alirocumab will be administered in the clinic (Day 1, Visit 1). Patients from the LTS11717 will have the possibility to perform a 
placebo self-injection training before the first alirocumab administration using 
an auto-injector on that same day (Day 1), as they used a different device (a prefilled syringe) in the parent study.  
From Visit 1, patients have the option to self-administer or have the study 
drug injection administered by [CONTACT_56435] (such as spouse,

alirocumab - LTS13463 Version number: 1  
 
Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 4 relative, etc.).  
From Day 1 (Visit 1) until Week 8 (first unblinded LDL-C value), neither the 
treatment received at the end of the double-blind treatment period in the parent study, nor the lipid parameters level, will be known by [CONTACT_737], 
and by [CONTACT_102], in order to prevent any potential blinding breaking of the 
parent clinical study. However, from Week 8 (Visit 3) in the OLE, the lipid 
values will be communicated to the investigator in real time.  
From Week 12 (Visit 4), the Investigator will be responsible, based on his/her 
own judgment and the patients’ LDL levels, to manage alirocumab dose (up-
titration from 75 to 150 mg every 2 weeks, down-titration from 150 to 75 mg 
every 2 weeks or maintenance of the dose, will be possible).  
Daily dose of statin or of other lipid-modifying therapy (LMT) (if applicable) 
can be modified based on the Investigator’s judgment throughout the study.  
After Week 24 (visit 5), visits will be scheduled every 24 weeks 
(approximately 6 months) and a dispensation visit will be scheduled in between the 24 weeks visits interval. This dispensation visit will allow to 
supply IMP for the next 3 months, and will also allow to check the treatment 
compliance, the concomitant medications, and occurrence of any adverse 
event. 
Patients should be on a stable diet (NCEP-ATPI[INVESTIGATOR_415042]) 
throughout the entire study duration from visit 1 (V1) to the end of OLE 
treatment period (OLETP) (V17). 
STUDY POPULATION  
Main selection criteria Inclusion criteria  
x Eligible patients for this OLE study will be men and women 
diagnosed with heFH in the parent study and who have completed 
one of the following studies, EFC12492, R727-CL-1112, EFC12732 
or LTS11717. Patients who missed the last injection or who 
performed the end of treatment visit outside the expected timelines 
can also be enrolled. 
 
Exclusion criteria 
x Significant protocol deviation in the parent study based on the 
Investigator judgment, such as non-compliance by [CONTACT_102]. 
x Adverse event leading to permanent discontinuation from parent 
study. 
x Have any new condition or worsening of existing condition which in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_37580], or could interfere with the patient participating in or 
completing the study.   
x Positive pregnancy test at the end of treatment visit or end of study visit, according to the parent study the patient was originating from.  
x Women of childbearing potential not willing to continue highly-effective method of birth control and/or who are unwilling or unable 
to be tested for pregnancy. 
Total expected number of patients Up to approximately 1,200 patients may be enrolled in the study. 
Expected number of sites  Approximately 200 sites worldwide

x Day 1 / Week 0 (End of treatment visit of the parent double-blind 
study = OLE Visit 1, except for the patients having participated in 
the LTS11717). 
x Complete study visits: Patients will be assessed in the clinic at 
Weeks 4 (Visit 2), 8 (Visit 3), 12 (Visit 4), 24 (Visit 5), and then 
every 24 weeks until EOT Visit (Visit 17), or early termination.  
x IMP dispensing visits: From Week 24, until study completion IMP 
dispensing visits will be scheduled every [ADDRESS_523264] IMP injection, ie 8 weeks after the EOT visit, for the patients who will 
complete the study and for the patients who will early discontinue 
whatever the reason. 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS Sample size determination: 
As this study is an open-label extension planning to include patients from previous studies, no calculation for sample size was performed. It is expected 
to enroll up to 1,200 heFH patients based on the number of patients already enrolled in the parent studies.  
Analysis Population: 
Safety analyses will be performed on Safety population which consists of 
patients receiving at least one dose or partial dose of IMP in the current study. 
Efficacy analyses will be performed on patients receiving at least one dose or 
partial dose of IMP in the current study, with a baseline (from parent study) 
LDL-C available and with at least one LDL-C value available in the period 
from first IMP injection in the current study to last IMP injection + 21 days.  
Analysis of safety endpoints: 
Safety analysis (Adverse events, laboratory, vital signs) will be descriptive, 
based on the safety population. The safety analysis will focus on the Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (T EAE) period defined as the time from 
the first dose of the current study to the last dose of IMP + 70 days (10 weeks).  
For analyses of changes from baseline for laboratory and vital signs 
parameters, baseline of the parent study or of the current study may be 
considered. 
Efficacy parameters: As secondary objectives of the study, efficacy variables will be explored 
through descriptive statistics at each scheduled visit of the current study. 
Formal statistical testing is not planned and alpha adjustments not needed. 95% confidence intervals will be provided for percent changes from baseline 
and success rate to reach targets.  
In addition, percent changes from baseline of the parent study and success 
rate to reach targets from the week 8 time point will also be analyzed in all 
groups combined as the influence of treatment received during the parent study should be offset by [CONTACT_415058] 
8 weeks of treatment.

SAR236553 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to PCSK9. Its 
International Nonproprietary Name  (INN) is alirocumab. Alirocumab was previously referred as 
SAR236553 or REGN727. All relevant information concerning the compound is available in the latest version of the Clinical Investigator’s Brochure (CIB). 
Background on patient populations: 
This open-label extension stud y will include patients diagnosed with heterozygous familial 
hypercholesterolemia (heFH) who have completed EFC12492, R727-CL-1112, EFC12732 or 
LTS11717.  
Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited disorder of lipid  metabolism that predisposes a 
person to premature severe card iovascular disease (CVD).  Familial hypercholesterolemia has a 
high prevalence in Caucasian populations, where an estimated [ADDRESS_523280] 3 different genes that code for proteins involved in hepatic clearance of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) can cause FH.  These include mutations in the gene coding for the LDL receptor (LDL-R) that removes LDL-C from the circulation, and less commonly, in the gene for Apo B, which is the major protein of the LDL particle.  In rare cases, the gene coding for proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), an enzyme involved in 
degrading the LDL-R (gain of func tion mutation), is mutated.  In all cases, this results in an 
accumulation of LDL-C in the plasma from birth, and subsequent development of tendon 
xanthomas, xanthelasmas, atheromata, and premature CVD. 
In the heterozygous form of FH (heFH), the cumulative risk of experiencing a coronary event by 
[CONTACT_14898] [ADDRESS_523281] 50% in men and approximately 30% in women (coronary disease occurs approximately [ADDRESS_523282]-menopausal women).  Before effective treatment with 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (commo nly referred to as statins) became available, 
mortality from coronary disease was increased by [CONTACT_47071] 100 fold in young FH adults aged 20 to 39 years, and approximately 4 fold for FH patients aged 40 to 59 years ( 1). 
In the real world, a large proportion of patients with FH do not reach treatment goals and, by [CONTACT_217927], remain at increased risk of CVD ( 2). In a recent large cross-sectional study 
conducted in the Netherlands, nearly all heterozygous FH patients (96%) were on statin treatment. Only 21% of patients achieved the LDL-C goal of less than 100 mg/dL (less than 2.59 mmol/L) and about 5% of patients still had an LDL-C concentration greater than 200 mg/dL. Among those not at goal, 27% were on combination ther apy of maximum statin dose and ezetimibe ( 3). These 
data emphasize the need for new LDL-lowering therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 21 Introduction to proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and alirocumab: 
Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) belongs to the subtilisin family of serine 
proteases and is highly expressed in the liver. PCSK9 is involved in regulating the levels of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) protein ( 4) (5). Once PCSK9 is secreted into plasma, it 
directly binds to the LDL-R and promotes its degradation. The increased degradation of LDL-Rs leads to a reduced removal of LDL particles -C and therefore, higher circulating levels of LDL-C.Experiments with mice have shown that increasing PCSK9 protein levels decreases levels of LDL-R protein in the liver while PCSK9 knockout mice have increased levels of LDL-R in the liver ( 6), (7). In humans, PCSK9 mutations have been identified: the gain-of-function mutations 
are rare and cause an autosomal dominant form of severe hypercholesterolemia and premature coronary heart disease (CHD), whereas loss-of-function mutations are more common and are associated with reduced plasma levels of LDL-C and protection from CHD ( 8) (9).  
Therefore, blocking PCSK9 from binding to the LDL-R can potentially benefit patients with hypercholesterolemia by [CONTACT_415061]-C levels. In addition, PCSK9 messenger 
ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein levels are increased in response to statins, potentially attenuating their cholester ol-lowering effect ( 10). 
Rationale for study design: 
The objective of the present study is to provide additional long term safety and efficacy 
experience with alirocumab in a closer to real life setting than a double-blind design study, in patients with heFH receiving lipid-modifying drug therapy including statins.  
Patients with heFH who cannot attain LDL-C goal despi[INVESTIGATOR_415047]-modifying therapy, including a 
statin at maximally tolerated dose, present a high  unmet need regarding their life-long increased 
cardiovascular risk.  This study gives these heFH patients, who already participated in one of the double-blind 18-month ODYSSEY Phase 3 studies, the possibility to start or continue treatment 
with alirocumab after the end of the parent study. All patients will receive alirocumab at entry in 
the open-label extension study regardless of the study treatment they received during the 18-
month double-blind treatment period of the parent study, provided they fulfill the eligibility criteria of the open-label extension study. 
Description of the parent studies: 
The study design of the four concerned parent studies was similar: Phas e 3, 18-month treatment 
duration, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group, multi-national, multi-
center study.

-  Simvastatin 80 mg daily (if already on this dose for >1 year) 
-  Patients not able to be on any of the above statin doses should be treated with the daily dose of atorvastatin, 
rosuvastatin or simvastatin which is considered appropriate for the patient as per the investigator's judgment or concerns. Some examples of acceptable reasons for a patient taking a lower statin dose include, but are 
not limited to: adverse effects on higher doses, advanced age, low body mass index, regional practices, local 
prescribing information, concomitant medications, co-morbid conditions such as impaired glucose 
tolerance/impaired fasting glucose. The reason(s) will need to be documented in the case report form. 
Rationale for dose selection: 
Two doses of alirocumab are currently being evaluated in the ODYSSEY Phase 3 program: 75 mg 
and 150 mg, to be administered subcutaneously every 2 weeks (Q2W), based on data from the 
Phase [ADDRESS_523283] observed with the

alirocumab - LTS13463 Version number: [ADDRESS_523284] initially been treated with 75 
mg Q2W and only those patients whose LDL-C levels remain above goal after 8 weeks of treatment are up-titrated to 150 mg Q2W (at week 12) in this initial double-blind treatment period.  
Only patients who are participating in two studies, LTS11717 and EFC12732 were initiated with 
[ADDRESS_523285] systemic exposure to alirocumab, in order to gather adequate safety and tolerability information at this dose; EFC12732 only included patients with a LDL-C level above 160 mg/dL (4.14 mmol/L) while receiving maximal tolerated statin: the aim was to assess the benefit from starting directly at the most effective dose in this specific population of patients who need large LDL-C decrease.  
In the OLE study, patients will st art treatment with 75 mg Q2W, re gardless of the treatment / dose 
they received at the end of the parent study, except patients from EFC12732. These latter patients, 
who had a screening LDL-C  160 mg/dL in the parent study, will receive [ADDRESS_523286] patients are included in the OLE, no 
information will be available on the treatment / dose received at the end of the parent study, nor on LDL-C level at the end of the parent study / baseline of the OLE.  
Brief description of the OLE study: 
Depending on the parent study the patient participated in, either 75 mg or 150 mg every 2 weeks 
will be administered at the entry in the OLE study.   
From Week 12 (Visit 4), based on the Investigator judgment and the LDL-C level unblinded from 
Week 8, dose adjustment, such as up-titration to 150 mg Q2W or down-titration to 75 mg Q2W of alirocumab, will be possible. It is anticipated that in real life, after initial up-titration, subsequent dose adjustment over time may include down-titration. This will be allowed in this study, and the Investigator will be asked to report the reason for down-titration from 150 to 75 mg Q2W and for up-titration from 75 mg to 150 mg Q2W. 
Taking into consideration the current number of patients enrolled in the four parent studies, it is 
estimated that up to approximately 1,200 patients could be enrolled. 
This open-label extension study will be conducted for approximately three additional years or 
more, depending on the inclusion date in the current study, after the 18-month double-blind 
treatment period of the parent studies.

Unlike the patients from the other studies, the patients from the ODYSSEY Long Term study used 
a different device (a prefilled syringe) in the parent study, and thus will have the possibility to perform on Visit 1 (Day 1) a placebo, self-injection training, using an auto-injector, before the first alirocumab administration.  
Injection for training: Sterile placebo for alirocumab will be prepared in the same formulation as 
alirocumab without the addition of protein as 1 mL volume in an auto-injector, for those patients willing to perform injection training. 
Note: Only in the event the manufacturer faces any performance or supply issues of the auto-
injector, contingency alternatives are the following ones, in order to ensure the continuity of the

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 31 The IMP could be administered by [CONTACT_6270]-injection or by [CONTACT_56435] (such as a 
spouse, relative, etc…). The used auto-injector will be discarded in a sharps container which will be provided to patients. It is recommended that the s ubcutaneous IMP injections be rotated within 
an anatomical area (eg, right thigh then left thigh or right abdomen then left abdomen). Patients 
also have the option to inject in a different anatomical area (eg, thigh then abdomen) during the 
study. 
If another concomitant drug is being injected at the same site planned for the IMP injection, then 
the patient should be advised to use an alternate location for administration of the IMP. 
Patients will be asked to store the IMP in a refrigerator. Prior to administration, the IMP should be 
set outside in a safe location at room temperature for about 30 to 40 minutes. Thereafter, the IMP should be administered as soon as possible. 
Instructions as outlined above should be provided to the patient (or another designated person 
[such as spouse, relative, etc...] that will administer the injections) at training and as needed during the course of the study. Close supervision and feedback should be given at the first visit, 
and other visits as needed. Anyone that plans to administer the IMP must be trained by [CONTACT_8702]. 
8.1.[ADDRESS_523299] alirocumab injection will be done at the site by [CONTACT_179610] (such as spouse, relative, etc) under direct site staff supervision. Patients will be monitored at the investigational site  for at least [ADDRESS_523300] on the 
same date as the site visit, then the IMP should be administered after the blood sampling has been completed. 
Alirocumab should ideally be administered subcutaneously every two weeks at approximately the 
same time of the day. The time of the day is based upon patient’s preference; however it is 
acceptable to have a window period of ± 3 days.

background therapy or a potential rescue medication: 
x Statins  
x Cholesterol absorption inhibitors (ezetimibe) 
x Bile acid-binding sequestrants (such as c holestyramine, colestipol, colesevelam) 
x Nicotinic acid 
x Fenofibrate 
x Omega-3 fatty acids ( 1000 mg daily) 
Please see Section 8.8 for further information. 
8.3 BLINDING PROCEDURES 
From Day 1 (visit 1) until Week 8 (first unblinded LDL-C value),  
x neither the treatment received during the double-blind treatment period of the parent study, 
x nor the lipid parameters levels,  
will be known by [CONTACT_415066], in order to prevent any potential to jeopardize the blinding of the parent clinical study. 
From Week 8 (visit 3), the lipid parameters values  will be communicated to the Investigator in 
real time. 
8.4 METHOD OF ASSIGNING PATIENTS TO TREATMENT GROUP 
This is an open-label study and every patient will receive alirocumab. Treatment kit numbers will 
be allocated via interactive voice/web response system (IVRS/IWRS). Patients will keep the same identification number that they were allocated in the parent study. 
From Week 12 (Visit 4), the Investigator will ma nage, based on his/her own judgment and LDL-C 
value from sample obtained at the previous scheduled visit, adjustment of alirocumab doses 
(either up-titration from 75 mg to 150 mg every 2 weeks or down-titration  from  150 mg to 75 mg every 2 weeks, or maintenance of the dose, will be possible).  For adjustments based on LDL-C 
values, simultaneous adjustments in alirocumab dose and any LMT should be avoided.

requirements.  
8.6 STORAGE CONDITIONS AND SHELF LIFE 
The IMP will be stored in a refrigerator between +2°C and + 8°C (36°F to 46° F) by [CONTACT_779]. The 
temperature of the site refrigerator should be checked daily and recorded on a log sheet. 
The IMP that will be stored at the investigational site should be kept in an appropriate locked 
room, under the responsibility of the Investigator or designee or other authorized person in 
accordance with the storage conditions indicated on the label. 
After the supply of IMP kits to patients at the study site visits, appropriate provisions will be in 
place for transportation of the IMP kits from the study site to the patient’s refrigerator. 
8.[ADDRESS_523301], or other personnel allowed to store and dispense the IMP will be responsible for ensuring that the IMP used in the clinical trial is securely maintained as specified by [CONTACT_179623]. 
All IMP will be dispensed in accordance with the Investigator's prescription and it is the 
Investigator's responsibility to ensure that an accurate record of IMP issued and returned is maintained. 
Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or use of an IMP (deficiency in condition, appearance, 
pertaining documentation, labeling, expi[INVESTIGATOR_320], etc) should be promptly notified to the Sponsor. Some deficiencies may be recorded through a complaint procedure. 
A potential defect in the quality of IMP may be s ubject to initiation of a recall procedure by [CONTACT_429]. In this case, the Investigator will be responsible for promptly addressing any request 
made by [CONTACT_1034], in order to recall IMP and eliminate potential hazards. 
Under no circumstances will the Investigator supply IMP to a third party, allow the IMP to be 
used other than as directed by [CONTACT_13129], or dispose of IMP in any other manner.

8.7.2 Return and/or destruction of treatments 
A detailed treatment log of the destroyed IMP will be established with the Investigator (or the 
pharmacist) and countersigned by [CONTACT_179626]. The Investigator will not destroy the unused IMP unless the Sponsor provides written authorization. 
If the site is not able to destroy or destruction of IMPs are not allowed in the country, all 
treatments kits will be retrieved by [CONTACT_1034]. A detailed treatment log of the returned IMP will 
be established with the Investigator or designee and countersigned by [CONTACT_415067]. 
8.8 CONCOMITANT MEDICATION 
A concomitant medication is any treatment received by [CONTACT_415068]’s  participation in the study. 
Concomitant medications should be kept to a minimum during the study. However, if these are considered necessary for the patient’s welfare and are unlikely to interfere with the IMP, they may 
be given at the discretion of the Investigator, with a stable dose (when possible). Besides the specific information related to concomitant medications provided in this section, any other concomitant medication(s) w ill be allowed and will ha ve to be recorded in the e-CRF and source 
data. 
8.8.1 Management of background lipid-modifying therapy 
Throughout the whole treatment period, the patients should stay, as far as possible, on the stable maximally tolerated registered daily dose of statins, with or without other LMT, that was received during the parent study.  
Background LMT may be adjusted as per the Investigator’s judgment, for example in case of 
tolerability issue. Any adjustment will be doc umented in the e-CRF. For adjustments based on 
LDL-C values, simultaneous adjustments in alirocumab dose and any LMT should be avoided.

9.1 PRIMARY SAFETY ENDPOINTS 
The safety parameters (adverse events, laboratory data, vital signs) will be assessed throughout 
the study. 
The definition and reporting procedures of Adverse Events (AE), Adverse Events of Special 
Interest (AESI) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and management of specific laboratory abnormalities are described in sections 10.4
 to 10.6.  
Adverse event observation period: 
The observation of safety data will be as follows: 
x Pre-treatment observation period  is defined as the time from signing the informed consent 
to the time of first dose of alirocumab in th e current study. The adverse events occurring 
during this period will be reported and reco rded in the parent study data base. 
x TEAE period:  the TEAE (Treatment Emergent Adverse Event) observation period is 
defined as the time from first dose of aliroc umab in the OLE up to 70 days (10 weeks) 
after the last dose of alirocumab received in the OLE study for the patients who will either 
complete the study or who will prematurely discontinue, as residual effect of treatment is expected until [ADDRESS_523304]-treatment period : the post-treatment obser vation period is defined as the time starting 
the day after the end of the TEAE period up to the end of the study (see definition in section 6.2.1). 
Death observation period: 
The death observations are per the observation period defined above. In addition, “post-study” 
death includes all deaths reported after the end of the study (see definition of end of study period 
per patient in Section 6.2.1). 
9.1.1 Adverse events 
All adverse events diagnosed by [CONTACT_415069]. 
All AEs will be coded to a “Lowest Level Term (LLT)”, “Preferred Term (PT)”, “High Level 
Term (HLT)”, “High Level Group Term (HLGT)” and associated primary “System Organ Class (SOC)” using the version of MedDRA (Medical Di ctionary for Regulatory Activities) currently in

Permanent treatment discontinuation (also referred to as treatment discontinuation) is any treatment discontinuation associated with the de finitive decision from the Investigator or the 
patient not to re-expose the pa tient to the IMP at any time. 
Patient withdrawal from the study treatment or study should be avoided as much as possible. 
10.3.[ADDRESS_523335] of criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation 
The patients may withdraw from treatment with the IMP if they decide to do so, at any time and 
irrespective of the reason, or this may be the Investigator’s decision. All efforts should be made to document the reasons for treatment discontinuation and this should be documented in the e-CRF. 
Patients should discontinue the IMP for the following reasons: 
x Pregnancy, intention for pregnancy, or no longer with effective contraceptive method of 
birth control (females only). 
x Acute injection reaction of clinical concern. 
x Serious adverse event (or non-serious but severe in intensity) of hypersensitivity reaction considered related to IMP. 
x At patient request. 
x If, in the Investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continuation with the administration of the IMP would be detrimental to the patient's well-being. 
x Intercurrent condition that requires discontinuation of the IMP (eg, laboratory 
abnormalities, please refer to decision tree Appendix C). 
x Any abnormal laboratory value will be immediately rechecked for confirmation before making a decision of permanent discontinuation of the IMP for the concerned patient 
x At the specific request of the Sponsor. 
10.3.4 Handling of patients after permanent treatment discontinuation 
Patients who prematurely discontinue study treatment (regardless of the reason) should undergo an unscheduled visit with assessments normally planned at the end of treatment visit (it should take place within 5 days of treatment discontinuation, if possible).  
The patient, at a minimum, should then be followed up for at least [ADDRESS_523336].

alirocumab - LTS13463 Version number: [ADDRESS_523337] wi th assessments at 10 weeks after the premature 
treatment discontinuation. 
All definitive discontinuation of study treatment should be recorded by [CONTACT_56478] e-CRF and in the patient’s medical records when considered as 
confirmed. IVRS/IWRS should be notified when a patient prematurely discontinues study 
treatment. 
10.3.5 Procedure and consequence for patient withdrawal from study  
The patients may withdraw from the study before study completion if they decide to do so, at any time and irrespective of the reason. If possible, the patients should be assessed using the 
procedure defined above. 
All study withdrawals should be recorded by [CONTACT_56479] e-
CRF and in the patient’s medical records (with, in th is medical records, at least date of withdrawal 
and reason for) when considered as confirmed. 
For patients who fail to return to the site, the Investigator should make the best effort to re-contact 
[CONTACT_102] (eg, contact[CONTACT_12531]’s family or private physician, reviewing available registries or health care databases), and to determine his/her health status, including at least his/her vital status. Attempts to contact [CONTACT_179642] s must be documented in the patie nt’s records (eg, times and dates 
of attempted telephone contact, receipt for sending a registered letter)  
Patients who have withdrawn from the study cannot be included in the study again. Their 
inclusion and treatment numbers must not be reused.  
10.4 OBLIGATION OF THE INVESTIGATOR REGARDING SAFETY REPORTING 
10.4.1 Definitions of adverse events  
Please refer to Appendix B  for Adverse Event (AE) reporting requirements. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse event 
An adverse event ( AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
patient administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a 
causal relationship with this treatment. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious adverse event 
A serious adverse event  (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
x Results in death, or 
x Is life-threatening, or

the patient was at risk of death at the time of  the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
x Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or 
x Results in persistent or sign ificant disability/incapacity, or 
x Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
x Is a medically important event

x The Investigator should take appropriate measures to follow all AEs until clinical recovery 
is complete and laborat ory results have returned to nor mal, or until progression has been 
stabilized, or until death, in order to ensure the safety of the patients. This may imply that 
observations will continue beyond the last planned visit per protocol, and that additional 
investigations may be requested by [CONTACT_181287].  
x When treatment is prematurely  discontinued, the patient’s obs ervations will continue until 
the end of the study as defined by [CONTACT_56485]. 
x Laboratory, vital signs or ECG abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs only if:  
- Symptomatic and/or  
- Requiring either corrective treatment or consultation, and/or  
- Leading to IMP discontinuation or modification of dosing, and/or  
- Fulfilling a seriousness criterion, and/or  
- Defined as an AESI  
See Appendix B  for a summary of AE reporting guidelines. 
10.4.[ADDRESS_523342] immediately:

described above, then the Investigator should exercise his/her medical judgment in the 
interpretation of the results, necessity for workup of the decrease in hemoglobin or referral 
to a hematologist. 
If a second hemoglobin measurement demonstrating a further decrease of 1 g/dL from the last 
available value is observed, even if the previous work-up was negative, the same investigations 
can be repeated and a hematology consultation can be requested at the discretion of the Investigator or at the Sponsor's request.  
10.5 OBLIGATIONS OF THE SPONSOR 
During the course of the study, the Sponsor will report in an expedited manner: 
x all SAEs that are both unexpected and at least reasonably related to the IMP (Suspected 
Unexpected Serious Adverse Re action; S[LOCATION_003]R), to the Health Authorities, IECs/IRBs as 
appropriate and to the Investigators.  
x all SAEs that are expected and at least re asonably related to the IMPs to the Health 
Authorities, according to local regulations. 
In this study, some AEs are considered related to the underlying condition and thus will not be 
considered unexpected, as given in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
Any other AE not listed as an expected event in the Investigator’s Brochure or in this protocol 
will be considered unexpected. 
The Sponsor will report all safety observations made during the conduct of the trial in the clinical 
study report (CSR). 
10.6 SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS 
10.6.1 Local tolerability (Local Injection Site Reactions) 
In case the Investigator or the patient recognizes any signs of local intolerability, then this should 
be treated and followed up as per the investigator’s medical judgment. See Appendix F  for further 
information.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 65 Sometimes transient injection site reactions, irritant in nature, may occur, requiring no 
intervention and being of dubious significance. These reactions would not be considered to be allergic reactions. 
Adverse events that may constitute an allergic  reaction (eg, generalize d itch, nasal itch, swelling 
at injection site, flushing, hives, swelling at lips,  eyes, face, tongue, hands, feet, lump in throat, 
difficulty to swallow, hoarseness, change in pi[INVESTIGATOR_179579], incapacity to speak, wheezing, chest 
tightness, stridor, etc) should be considered to be reported on the General Allergic Reaction and/or Local Injection Site Reaction Complementary Form (see Section 10.4.4). 
Adverse events that are obviously not of allergic origin (eg, local injection site reactions) should only be recorded on the Local Injection Site Reaction Complementary Form. However, injection site reactions which progress/expand/worsen/etc should be evaluated as recommended in [IP_ADDRESS] 
and General Allergic Reaction Complementary form should be completed. (See Sections 10.4.4) 
The IMP should be immediately interrupted (temporarily discontinued) if there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_415052].  See Section 10.3.1 for further information on treatment 
interruption and Section 10.3.3 for criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Allergic events with cutaneous involvement 
Adverse events with cutaneous involvement which are obviously of allergic origin or injection site reactions which progress/expand/worsen/etc should be evaluated by a dermatologist as soon as possible, and preferably within one week of the site first becoming aware of the event. 
The investigator should evaluate the patient for possible etiologies (new medications, etc) and 
extra-cutaneous symptoms and signs. An unscheduled Central Laboratory assessment for hematology, chemistry, liver panel and ADA should be obtained. If it is possible, the site will take pi[INVESTIGATOR_415053]’s visit. 
If the photos are obtained, then copi[INVESTIGATOR_415054].  The investigator will provide a summary of the patient's case, reason for consultation, and information being requested to the consulting dermatologist. 
A full consultation report should be sent by [CONTACT_415081]. The full report 
should contain, at a minimum, the following information; a detailed description of the rash (such as the morphology [lesion type], shape of individual lesions, arrangement of multiple lesions [eg, 
scattered, grouped, linear, etc.], distribution, color, consistency, presence of pruritus or pain, and 
other clinical signs) and in case a skin biopsy (including histopathology and immunofluorescence) was done (if it was deemed necessary as per the dermatologist’s or investigator’s medical judgment), the results of this investigation w ith, if applicable, a specific diagnosis of the AE. The 
investigator will fax the full report and the corrected AE form if necessary, to the Monitoring Team Representative within 24 hours.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 66 [IP_ADDRESS] Acute allergic Injection Reactions  
Acute allergic injection reaction (which are considered under the category of general allergic 
reactions) is defined as any AE that occurs during or shortly after injection of the IMP (characterized by [CONTACT_179649], bronchoconstriction, urticaria, edema, angioedema, nausea, vomiting). Emergency equipment and medication for the treatment of these potential adverse effects (eg, antihistamines, br onchodilators, IV saline, corticosteroids, 
acetaminophen, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) must be available for immediate use for the injections at the training, and randomization visits. (See Section 10.4.2) 
Patients will be observed at the i nvestigational site for at least [ADDRESS_523347] at the randomization visit. Patients should be treated symptomatically if any AEs are observed. Patients are to remain at the site until any acute injection reaction is assessed as stable, per the Investigator’s discretion.

11.4.1 Extent of alirocumab exposure and compliance 
The alirocumab extent exposure and compliance will be assessed and summarized within the 
safety population. 
In order to ensure the continuity of the investigational treatment for the patients without 
interruption (only in the event the manufacturer faces any performance or supply issues of the auto-injector), back-up plans may be implemented as described in Section 8.1. In that case, 
exposure to initial device and back -up device will be summarized and impact on study results will 
be assessed. More details will be provided in  the SAP, if applicable. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Extent of investigational medicinal product exposure 
The total exposure will be assessed by: 
x Duration of alirocumab exposure in weeks defi ned as: (last aliroc umab injection date 
+ [ADDRESS_523350] alirocumab injection date) / 7, regardless of unplanned intermittent discontinuations. 
x The total number of injections by [CONTACT_4676]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Compliance 
Compliance will be assessed using the following parameters: 
x The mean injection frequency will be defined for each patient as the average number of 
days between 2 consecutive injections, that is: (last dose date – first dose date)/(number of 
injections -1). 
This parameter will be summa rized descriptively (N, Mea n, SD, Median, Min and Max). 
x The overall compliance will be defined for each patient as: 100 - (% days with under-planned dosing + % days with above-planned dosing). Under-planned and above-planned dosing will be defined as follows, considering that injections should be performed every 2 weeks (+ - 3 days): 
x The %days with under-planned dosing will be defined for each patient as the number of days with no injection administered within the previous 17 days divided by [CONTACT_415082]. For example, if a patient takes a dose 18 days after his/her previous injection, then 1 day is counted as a day under-planned dosing. 
x The %days with above-planned dosing will be  defined for each patient as the number 
of days with more than one injection administered within the 11 days before divided by [CONTACT_415082]. For example, if a patient takes a dose 9 days after his/her previous injection, then 2 days are counted as a days above-planned dosing.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential Page 69 11.4.2 Analyses of safety endpoints 
All safety analyses will be performed on the Safety population using the following common rule:  
The baseline value is defined generally as the last available value before first injection. For 
analyses of changes from baseline for laboratory and vital signs parameters, baseline of the parent 
study or of the current study (ie value at visit [ADDRESS_523351] injection) may be considered. 
The safety analysis will focus on the Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) period defined 
as the time from the first dose of the current study to the last dose of IMP + 70 days (10 weeks).  
The following definitions will be applied to laboratory parameters  and vital signs. 
The potentially clinically significant abnormality (PCSA) values are defined as abnormal values 
considered medically important by [CONTACT_181295]/thresholds based 
on literature review and defined by [CONTACT_179653]. 
PCSA criteria will determine which patients had at least 1 PCSA during the TEAE period, taking 
into account all evaluations performed during the TEAE period, including unscheduled or repeated evaluations.  The number of all such patients will be the numerator for the PCSA 
percentage.   
Treatment period: the treatment period used for quantitative analysis is defined as the time from 
first dose of IMP injection to the last dose of IMP injection + 21 days.  
AE definition: 
x Pre-treatment AEs are AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during the 
PRE-TREATMENT period; 
x Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) are AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during the TEAE period; 
x Post-treatment AEs are AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during the POST-TREATMENT period. 
Drug-induced liver injury: 
Liver function tests, namely ALT, AST, alkalin e phosphatase and total bilirubin, are used to 
assess possible drug-induced liver toxicity. The proportion of patients with PCSA values at any 
post-baseline visit by [CONTACT_56495]. A graph of distribution of peak values of ALT vers us peak values of total bilirubin will also be 
presented. Note that the ALT and total bilirubin va lues are presented on a logarithmic scale. The

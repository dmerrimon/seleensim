4.   A bstract: Growing evidence supports the presence of dysregulated pain modulation in older adults, 
an effect which may heighten age -associated risk for chronic pain. While persistent pain is common in 
older adults, chronic low back pain is the leading cause of disability in this population and results in 
significant impairment in psychosocial and physical functioning. Given reports of suboptimal treatment 
of pain in older adults, improvements in pain management in this cohort are of critical importance. 
Resilience is characterized as a dynamic process resulting in positive adjustment and adaptation after exposure to adversity. The benefits of resilience in health- related functioning are manifold, and evidence 
suggests that resilience plays an important role in fostering adaptive physiological and affective responses to pain. Given this, capi[INVESTIGATOR_595778] a promising target for enhancing pain 
adaptation, and is especially salient to older adults given the burden of high- impact pain in this group. 
Therefore, the aim of this project will be to conduct a Stage I pi[INVESTIGATOR_595779] a resilience intervention for chronic low back pain among older adults. Using a Science 
of Behavior Change approach, the proposed study  will examine intervention- related benefits in 
psychosocial and physical functioning, and assess whether changes in targeted resilience mechanisms 
result in improvement in pain- associated outcomes. Achievement of these aims will provide a rich 
platform for  future intervention research and will forge a path toward investigating psychological 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_595780].  
 
5.   
Background: Chronic low back pain (cLBP) is the leading cause of disability worl dwide  (1, 2) and 
represents the most th erapeutically -challenging pain condition among older adults ( 3), affecting 
approximately 12 million  individuals over the age of 65 ( 4, 5). It is one of the top reasons for seeking 
healthcare and is frequently associated with impairments in psychological, cognitive, and physical 
functioning (6-8). Further, evidence suggests that the prevalence of disabling back pain increases with 
age (9), thus adding to its tremendous disease burden. Because older adults are among the fastest 
growing cohorts in the [LOCATION_002], both the incidence and burden of cLBP is expected to increase 
considerably. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], pain management is frequently suboptim al among older adults as 
pharmacological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_595781] a greater risk of side effects, polypharmacy 
can result in adverse drug reactions, and multimorbidities common to geriatric populations compl icate 
pharmacological treatme nt (3). As such, the demand for safe and effective therapeutic targets to reduce 
pain burden in later life is of critical importanc e. 
 Historically, research has been hampered by a predominant emphasis on the exploration of risk factors for chronic pain and relative inattention to identifying protective factors that facilitate optimal pain 
outcomes. This represents a significant knowledge gap as emerging literature suggests that individuals 
with chronic pain have the ability to exhibit resilience ( 10). Conceptualized as a dynamic, multilevel 
construct, resilience is a process through which dispositional resources (e.g., trait positive affect, social ties) and mechanisms (e.g., state positive affect, positive social int eractions) enhance functioning, 
thereby [CONTACT_595802], sustainability, and growth ( 11). In essence,  resilience is the ability to sustain 
adaptive functioning despi[INVESTIGATOR_595782]. Extant evidence signifies that resilience (and its 
underlying facets) is associated with attenuated experimental pain sensitivity (12), lower clinical pain 
and disability ( 13), and higher levels of psychological functioning (14).  
 
IRB Project #: 201901927  
IRB Version: 12/16/[ADDRESS_786536] the capacity to improve resilience in later life despi[INVESTIGATOR_595783] (e.g., pain) ( 15). 
Given the rapid growth of the older adult population and the general losses commonly associated with 
aging, recent years have witnessed a burgeoning interest in promoting adaptive functioning in this 
population through interventions that augment resilience and successful aging. In the context of pain, this offers advantages over conventional psychological interventions that focus primarily on the reduction of negative symptoms, an approach that does not necessarily lead to optimal functioning. 
While limited, a growing body of literature supports the use of resilience- based interventions in chronic 
pain, with positive outcomes  observed in affect regulation, clinical pain severity, physical and 
psychosocial disability, functional performance, well -being, and pharmacological use ( 16-19). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_595784], research examining the effectiveness of 
psychosocial interventions in this cohort remains limited.  
 
6.   Hypotheses and Specific Aims:  Chronic pain is one of the leading causes of disability, affecting 
over 100 million people in the [LOCATION_002] and resulting in tremendous health care costs and psychological burden. Older adults are disproportionately impacted by [CONTACT_77368], with an estimated  60-70% 
of people over the age of 65 reporting persistent pain. Given the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_595785], the identification of viable interventions to reduce pain burden in later life is a chief directive . Moreover, in 
light of the current opi[INVESTIGATOR_8562], initiatives to produce safe and effective nonpharmacological approaches to pain management are urgently needed.   
 
Using a Stage Model approach (20), the primary aim of this study is to examine the feasibility and 
acceptability of  a resilience intervention for chronic pain among older adults. Intervention modules will 
specifically engage hope, self -efficacy, positive affect, and pain acceptance as these factors 
demonstrated the strongest relationships with clinical pain, disability, and psychological functioning from the PI’s previous work  (NIH K99 Award). Chronic low back pain (cLBP) will be the targeted population 
given that it represents the most debilitating and therapeutically -challenging pain condition among 
geriatric populations. We will conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_595786] (primary aim), explore whether the intervention engages the 
proposed resilience targets (i.e., hope, self -efficacy, positive affect,  pain acceptance), and assess 
whether changes in these factors result in improvements in pain outcomes (i.e., NIH Science of Behavior 
Change approach ( 21)). Achievement of these aims will  provide a strong framework for  future 
intervention research examining mechanisms that promote adaptive health and pain- related functioning 
in aging populations.  
 
Specific Aim 1
 : Conduct a pi[INVESTIGATOR_595787], acceptability, and tolerability of a resilience 
intervention for older adults with cLBP. We will assess adherence and retention rates, and evaluate 
ratings of acceptability through brief assessments and eliciting qualitative feedback from participants at 
post-intervention.  Hypothesis 1. Individuals in the resilience intervention will report high adherence to 
and satisfaction with the intervention.  
 
Specific  Ai m 2: Assess whether  a resilience  intervention facilitates  improvements  in hope,  self-efficacy, 
positive affect,  and pain acceptance and whether  changes  in these  processes result  in improved pain-
related outcomes. Intervention modules will be adapted from the existing positive psychology literature 
and validated self -report measures will be used to verify engagement in the specific resilience  targets.  
Hypothesis 2. We hypothesize that a resilience intervention will improve pain severity, pain interference, 
negative affect, and quality of life by [CONTACT_595803], self -efficacy, positive affect, and pain acceptance.

esearch Plan:  
 
IRB Project #: 201901927  
IRB Version: 12/16/2021  
 General Overview of Procedures. All potential participants will undergo an initial phone screening 
interview, via telephone or in person. The initial screening will include questions regarding pain, age, and 
additional health history information to ensure that no exclusion criteria are p resent. Those who meet  study  
inclusion  criteria  will also be screened for COVID -19 using the COVID -19 phone screening form. If still 
eligible, participants will  be scheduled for an individual  baseline assessment  during which informed consent 
will be reviewed, medical and demographic history will be obtained to ensure eligibility, questionnaires will 
be administered, and a physical performance battery  will be conducted to examine lower extremity 
function.  At the completion of the baseline assessment, eligible participants will be scheduled for a 7-week  
program  (90 min/session)  in which  participants’ complete activities  designed to enhance hope, positive 
affect, pain acceptance, and self -efficacy. Participants will complete weekly home activities  and wi ll be 
asked to bring the home assignments into each session. Participants can miss  only one session without 
making it up or  up to two sessions if made up with individual sessions  in person, over the phone, or using 
a PHI Zoom call . Given evidence that intervention effects on pain and psychological outcomes in older 
adults are strongest when delivered using group- based approaches (relative to an individual format) (22), 
we have chosen to administer our protocol via groups.  
 
Participants. We will recruit adults, ages 5 0+ years, from the community and physician referral. To permit 
sex-stratified exploratory analyses, an equal number of  men and women will be targeted (23). Participants 
must endorse pain in the lower back region (i.e., space between the lower posterior margin of the rib cage 
and the horizontal gluteal fold) (24), and r eport pain of a moderate intensity (rating of >3 on a numeric 
rating scale ranging from 0- 10) occurring on at least half of the days in the past [ADDRESS_786537] 
moderately interfere with their daily activities (rating of >3 on a numeric rating scale ranging from 0 -10). In 
order to generalize results more broadly, study entry will not be restricted to low back pain although participants must identify low back pain as their primary pain condition. Exclusion criteria are as follows: 1) current participation in another psychological treatment; 2) severe psychiatric illness not adequately 
controlled by [CONTACT_12617] (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) or other conditions anticipated to impair 
intervention engagement (e.g., substance abuse/dependence); 3) presence of chronic, malignant pain 
(e.g., HIV, cancer) or systemic inflammatory disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, 
systemic lupus erythematosus, etc.); 4) significant cognitive impairment on the Montreal Cognitive Assessme nt (25);  5)
 inability to read and write English; and 6) if currently taking prescription analgesic or 
psychotropic medication, must be stabilized on these treatments for >[ADDRESS_786538], or counselor, taking new opi[INVESTIGATOR_595788], or using medical marijuana or CBD oil. If a participant begins a new pain 
treatment during study participation, the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_595789]. All participants  will be required to wear Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during in- person 
visits. PPE  (masks)  will be provided by [CONTACT_595804]. If intervention sessions are conducted through PHI Zoom, study staff will ensure participants have 
access to Zoom as well as a stable internet connection.  During Zoom intervention sessions, participants 
must have access to a working camera and microphone and have them both turned on in order to participate. Study staff will also ask participants if they have access to a space that will provide 
confidentiality  (e.g. not conducting Zoom call where other people may overhear, inform other household 
members about confidentiality expectations, ensure no identifying information is visible through camera) . 
Zoom tutorials will be provided during the Baseline Session.  
 
P
articipant payments will be made according to the following schedule: Baseline Assessment ($60), 
Intervention Sessions  1-6 ($20), Intervention Session 7 ($60) , and an additional $15 for completion of the 
3-month follow -up assessment (total max payment=$255 ). This is comparable to subject remuneration for 
studies of similar time commitment and invasiveness at our  institution. Participants  will receive partial 
paym ent if they  do not complete the entire study.  In addition, for participants traveling more than [ADDRESS_786539] #: 201901927  
IRB Version: 12/16/[ADDRESS_786540] to complete study visits, we will reimburse some travel expenses at up to the federal mileage 
rate ( total max travel reimbursement =$300) . Payment s for participation will occur after completion of each 
study session and will be handled through the University of [LOCATION_012]’s Human Subject Payment Program.  
 
Session 1 ( Baseline):  
 
Demographic and M edical History Questionnaire.  All participants will complete a through demographic 
and medical history form. We will assess self -reported duration of back pain, comorbid conditions, and 
current medication use. This medical history information will be reviewed with the participant by [CONTACT_80278] [INVESTIGATOR_595790]. Health status 
will also be reviewed with each participant during subsequent study sessions to ensure eligibility.  
 Vitals/Physical Measurements. Heigh t will be assessed to the nearest cm using a wall stadiometer and 
body weight to the nearest 0.1 kg using a digital scale. Calculation of BMI will be determined by [CONTACT_595805].
 Blood pressure will also be recorded for all participants.  
 Cognitive Testing.  The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (25) is a widely used screening 
assessment for detecting cognitive impairment. It was validated in the setting of mild cognitive impairment 
and has subsequently been adopted in numerous other settings clinically. Participants with scores <26 will 
be excluded from participation as this could interfere with completion of the study intervention. The 
alternative/equivalent version of the MoCA (Version 7.2) will be used to decrease possible learning effects when the MoCA (Version 7.1) has been administered within the past [ADDRESS_786541] recently participated in 
studies requiring the administration of this instrument.  
 
Physical Performance Battery . The Back Performanc e Scale (BPS)  (26) consists of five tests (i.e., sock 
test, pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696] -up test, roll -up test, fingertip- to-floor test, lift test) to assess mobility -related activities in individuals 
with back pain. Each test is scored from 0 to 3, and a total summed score ranging from 0 to 15 is  computed 
(higher scores equal worse functioning).  
 
 
Sessions 2-8 (Intervention Delivery):  
 Intervention Procedure . All sessions w ill be administered by [CONTACT_978], C o-I, and/or interventionist  
(masters/ PhD level psychologists) . Due to COVID- 19, intervention s essions  (Week 1 – Introduction and 
Background through Week 7 – Review of Skills and Wrap -Up) may be delivered online through PHI Zoom.  
To standardize the application of the intervention and ensure treatment fidelity, the resilience intervention 
is manualized and includes interventionist and client workbooks with materials and handouts for 
discussion. Client workbooks are written at the [ADDRESS_786542] been reviewed in an earlier phase of this trial 
(ARIAA 2A), whereby [CONTACT_595806] -structured focus groups and key informant interviews with 
approximately 47 older adults with cLBP to provide feedback on the treatment manual (IRB201802729). Interventionists  will be provided with a checklist of procedures specific to each session, and each checklist 
will be  reviewed to ensure treatment adherence. Participants who miss a group visit will be allowed to 
complete an individual make- up session, with the stipulation that only two missed sessions will be 
permitted.  
 Intervention Content .  All activities were adapted from the positive psychology literature and selected 
due to their strong empi[INVESTIGATOR_33727] ( 27-30), ease of completion, and applicability to the targeted 
resilience constructs. Each session will follow the same format including a review of the previous week’s 
content (i.e.,  homework review), an overview and discussion of the session objectives including didactic 
IRB Project #: 201901927  
IRB Version: 12/16/2021  
 in-session activities, and assignment of homework. The intervention will be comprised of the following 
activities . Week 1: Introduction and Background.  Participants will be provided with instruction on group 
therapy guidelines (e.g., confidentiality, respect, privacy), an overview of the purpose and structure of the 
program, and rationale for the use of resilience -enhancing activities for the management of cLBP. 
Participants will also be given education on cLBP etiology and symptoms and provided the opportunity to discuss their own personal experiences associated with chronic pain. As a home exercise, participants will be asked to complete a character strengths survey.  Week 2: Pleasant Activities.  During the second 
session, participants will be given instruction on how to increase the number of pleasant events in their life and will be provided with a list of pleasant activities to choose from (31). For their home practice, 
participants will be encouraged to engage in three pleasant activities over the week and to record things 
they are grateful for . Week 3: Pain Acceptance.  Participants will receive instruction on valued activity, 
psychological flexibility, and mindfulness -based exercises for enhancing pain acceptance and awareness. 
A values assessment will be administered to assist participants in identifying important values in their life  
(32). Week 4: Hope and Goal -Setting.  Based on Snyder’s theory of hope ( 27), participants will focus on 
their personal strengths and learn ways in which to create attainable goals through the developm ent of 
pathways and agency thinking. Participants will be asked to develop a goal that they would like to achieve 
over the course of the intervention to facilitate hopeful thinking and goal -directed behavior, and to identify 
areas in their life that inspi[INVESTIGATOR_595791] ( 33). Week 5: Positive Events and Reappraisal.  To increase 
attentional focus on positive events, participants will be taught ways in which to minimize the impact of adverse events and to downregulate negative emotions and thoughts through positive reappraisal  (34). 
As a home- based activity, participants will be encouraged to record, at minimum, one positive event that 
occurred every day, as well as negative event s in which they had to practice positive reappraisal  (35). 
Week 6: Pain Self -Efficacy.  While it is anticipated that self -efficacy will gradually be fostered throughout 
the course of the intervention (i.e., skills mastery experiences, feedback on progress, social persuasion through group support), this session will  complement ongoing training by [CONTACT_595807] -solving skills 
and confidence building, as well as empowering participants to promote adaptive pain management behaviors . Participants will be asked to engage in diaphragmatic breathing as a form of relaxation and to 
note areas of accomplishment over the course of the intervention ( 36, 37). Week 7: Review of Skills and 
Wrap -Up: Skills learned in the previous sessions will be reviewed and specific plans for maintenance of 
resilience activities will be discussed. Participants will also complete post -treatment outcome 
questionnaires and provide feedback on the intervention program . 
 
3-M
onth Follow -Up Assessment  
 Questionnaires will be administered via REDCap approximately 12 weeks after completion of the 
intervention to be completed online at home. These questionnaires will assess pain intensity and 
interference, mood, quality of life, and use of intervention materials and skills since the conclusion of the 
group sessions .  
 
Study Q
uestionnaires:  
 Several  questionnaires will be administered to assess general health, pain- related symptoms, and 
psychological functioning. In order to distribute participant burden, some of the questionnaires administered during Visit 1 and Visit 8 will be dispensed either during the session or at home between 
sessions  (either via our secure internet -based data collection system [i.e., REDCap] or on paper, 
depending on the participant’s preference).  
 
Measures of Treatment Acceptability. Treatment credibility  questions (38) w
ere adapted for the current 
study as a treatment expectancy  measure and will be administered during Visit 1 and Visit 2 consisting of 
the following items: 1) reasonableness of treatment, 2) willingness to undergo treatment, 3) confidence in recommending the treatment to others, 4) confidence that the treatment will help with pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 5) 
IRB Project #: 201901927  
IRB Version: 12/16/2021  
 confidence that the treatment will decrease pain, 6) confidence that the treatment will eliminate pain, and 
7) expectation for improvement .  
 The 8- item Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ -8) (39) w
ill be administered after the intervention as an 
assessment of treatment satisfaction. Items are rated on a 4- point Likert scale and measure aspects 
related to the quality of treatment, willingness to recommend the treatment , and general satisfaction with 
the treatment.  
 
As a treatment evaluation and t o better understand their perceptions of the intervention, participants will 
be queried at posttreatment  on their satisfaction with the intervention components, contentment with the 
structure of the intervention, and recommendations for intervention improvement.  Participants will also be 
asked to indicate the usefulness of each intervention session module and home activity on a 5- point Likert 
scale ranging from 0 (“not at all”) to 4 (“extremely”).  
 
Treatment engagement  questions were adapted for the current study ( 40) t o assess the participants’ effort 
exerted during group activities, completion of homework, and engagement in group discussions. This 
questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_38674][INVESTIGATOR_595792].  A modified version of this scale will also be completed by [CONTACT_595808]. At the 
beginning of each group session (starting with Visit 3 ), participants will also be administered a 7- item 
questionnaire assessing ease and quantity of home activity completion.  
 
Measures of Treatment Fidelity.  T herapi[INVESTIGATOR_595793], appropriateness of the 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]’s behavior, and quality of treatment delivery w ill be assessed using an adapted CT Adherence 
and Competence Scale (CTACS ) (41). A dherence will be evaluated for a randomized selection of 50% of 
the sessions conducted and reviewed by [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_7706]- I. Fidelity indicators are measured on a 0 
(“poor ”) to 4 (“excellent ”) scale, with higher ratings indicative of greater adherence, appropriateness, and 
quality of treatment  delivery .  
 
Psychosocial and Pain Questionnaires.  Several measures from the PROMIS short form  (24, 42 , 43) 
will be administered to assess self -reported pain intensity, pain interference, physical function, sleep 
impairment, and emotion (e.g., depression, anxiety).  The World Health Organization Quality of Life– Brief 
(WHOQol -Bref)  (44) s cale consists of [ADDRESS_786543] week  in four domains: 
physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment. The Roland- Morris Disability 
Questionnaire (RMDQ) (45) i s a 24- item self -report measure that assesses health status and disability 
related to low back pain.  Respondents are instructed to indicate which of the statements (e.g., “I stay at 
home most of the time because of my back”) describe their current experience. The 13- item Pain 
Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) (46) as sesses patient report of catastrophic thinking about pain, with scores 
ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (all the time). The Brief Resilience Scale  (BRS)  is a 6 -item questionnaire 
(47) t hat examines the ability to bounce back and recover from st ress. Items are rated on a 5- point scale 
(1=strongly disagree, 5=strongly agree) , with higher scores indicating greater levels of resilience. The 14-
item Pain Resilience Scale (PRS) (48) i s a pain- specific measure assessing perceived ability to regulate 
emotions and cognitions, as well as behavioral and motivational tenacity in the face of intense or prolonged 
pain. Items are rated on a 5- point scale (0=not at all, 4=all the time). The Modified Differential Emotions 
Scale  (mDES) (49) i s a [ADDRESS_786544] few days. Items are rated on a 5- point scale ranging from 0 (not at 
all) to 4 (extremely).  The Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support  (MSPSS) (50) i s a 12 -item 
scale with 4 items for each source of support (i.e., family, friends, and a significant other). Each item is rated on a 7- point scale ranging from “very strongly disagree” to “very strongly agree.” The Perceived 
Stress Scale  (PSS) (51, 52) i s a 10 -item measure examining the degree to which situations in one’s life 
are appraised as stressful, with scores ranging from 0=never to 4=very often.  The Graded Chronic Pain 
IRB Project #: 201901927  
IRB Version: 12/16/2021  
 Scale  (GCPS) is a 7 -item measure assessing pain intensity and pain -related disability  (53). T he Life 
Orientation Test -Revised  (LOT -R) is a 10- item scale measuring positive and negative thoughts about the 
future  (54). 
 
T
reatment Target Measures. To assess whether the intervention engages the proposed resilience 
targets (i.e., hope, self -efficacy, positive affect, pain acceptance), the following questionnaires will be 
administered. The Adult State Hope Scale (ASHS)  (55) t aps into state levels of hope. Two subscale scores 
assessing agency (i.e., sustained movement towards goals) and pathways (i.e., generation of workable 
routes to goals) thinking  are derived, as well as a total score consisting of a sum of these two scales. Pain -
related self -efficacy will be examined with the 10- item Pain Self -Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ) (56). 
Scores range from 0 (not at all confident) to 6 (completely confident  to undertake an activity), and higher 
scores indicate a greater level of self -efficacy in the midst of chronic pain. The Positive and Negative Affect 
Schedule (PANAS)  (57) i s a 20- item scale assessing positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA). Items 
are rated on a 5- point scale ranging from 1 (very slightly or not at all) to 5 (extremely) resulting in scale 
scores for PA  and NA. The Chronic Pain Acceptance Questionnaire (CPAQ) (58) i s comprised of 20 items 
measuring acceptance of pain. This measure has two subscales: activity engagement (i.e., pursuit of life 
activities regardless of pain)  and pain willingness (i.e., disengaging from pain avoidance and control). 
Items are rated on a 7- point scale (0=never true, 6=always true) . 
 
Statistical Methods.  T he goal of the study will be to target 50 participants for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_52393]. 
Accounting for a conservative 20% attrition rate, we will recruit an additional 10 participants (Total N =60). 
This sample size is feasible and will provide stable estimates of dropout rates, feasibility, and acceptability 
of the intervention protocol. We anticipate screening an additional 70 participants who may not meet eligibility criteria (i.e., screen fa ilures). Data Analysis:  Specific Aim 1.  The analysis of feasibility, 
tolerability, and acceptability outcomes will be predominantly conducted with descriptive statistics, with means and standard deviations reported. To assess feasibility, we will calculate a ratio between 
participants enrolled versus the number of participants commencing treatment. Tolerability will be examined by [CONTACT_595809] (i.e., participants completing all seven sessions of the intervention). Participant acceptability of the intervention will be assessed through treatment credibility 
ratings and satisfaction with the program ( 59). Ch
i -square tests and between- group t-tests will be used to 
compare group differences in baseline characteristics between completers and participant dropouts. Specific Aim 2.  To assess change in primary study outcomes (i.e., pain severity, pain interference, 
negative affect, quality of life), mean differences from pre- to post -intervention will be calculated using 
paired samples t -tests. Clinical significance of treatment changes will be determined by [CONTACT_595810]- half of a standard 
deviation from their baseline score ( 60, 61). Using residualized change scores (i.e., difference between 
the post -intervention va lue with the pre- intervention score covaried out), Pearson correlations will be 
computed to examine associations between outcome and treatment target change scores.   
 
Data and Safety Monitoring. Because this is not a formal clinical trial, a data and safet y monitoring 
board (DSMB) will not be required. In order to ensure data integrity and safety of human subjects, 
adverse events reported by [CONTACT_595811] [INVESTIGATOR_595794] “ Adverse 
Event and Unanticipated Problems  form” developed by [CONTACT_203671]’s Institutional Review 
Board. This form requires a description of the event, the course of action taken, and specification 
regarding whether or not the event was: 1) serious (e.g., life threatening, requiring o r prolonging 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], resulting in significant disability/incapacity or death); 2) unexpected (e.g., consistent with anticipated potential risks outlined in the study protocol/informed consent); or 3) causally related to the 
study interventions/procedures. All serious and unexpected adverse events are to be reported to the 
University of [LOCATION_012] IRB (within 5 working days)  and the study’s sponsor. Other types of adverse events 
will be monitored and reported to the University of [LOCATION_012] IRB in the study’s annual progress review. 
IRB Project #: 201901927  
IRB Version: 12/16/2021  
 The investigators will review the reported adverse events on a weekly basis  to minimize the risk to the 
study subjects.  
 
Confidentiality . All trained personnel assisting with the study will be instructed on the importance of 
protecting participants’ confidentiality  and will have successfully completed the required education on 
protection of human research participants.  All paper and computer records will be identified only by 
[CONTACT_469562]. All study records  will be stored in locked file cabinets and will only 
be available to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_469531]. Computer data files (without subject identifiers) will be stored on computer servers with secure passwords  and electronic storage devices  will be encrypted. All study 
records will be stored in locked file cabinets and will only be available to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_469531]. Study staff will be instructed to not record any information (e.g., responses to back pain criteria) obtained during the phone screen. E ach intervention group will be audio- recorded (and video- recorded via Zoom)  
for the evaluation of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_595795], and a random selection of 50% of all sessions conducted will be reviewed by [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_1238] C o-I. No identifying information will be transcribed as 
the purpose of this digital recording is to assess treatment integrity. Once the audio recordings are reviewed and adherence is discussed with the study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], the recordings will be destroyed. Prior to 
destruction, the recordings will be kept in a locked filing cabinet in the laboratory of the PI.  Video 
recordings via Zoom will only be used to extract an audio file, and video files will be promptly destroyed 
after each intervention visit.  
 8.   Possible Discomforts and Risks:  The risks for this study are minimal and appropriate safeguards 
are planned and in place to handle risks in a timely and appropriate manner.  
 
Protection against potential risks:   
Physical Performance Exam . The back performance test  may cause participant discomfort as a result 
of the exam. The examiner will monitor the response of participants in order to gauge the need to 
discontinue the exam. Participants may stop at any time.  
Questionnaires.  P articipants will fill out several  questionnaires  about  themselves.  While  these  generally  
carry  no associated  risks, it is possible that participants might experience some feelings of discomfort or 
unease when reading or responding to survey questions that are personal. Throughout each 
questionnaire, participants will be  reminded that partic ipation is completely voluntary,  and they can 
refuse to answer any question or can stop at any time. The PI, C o-I, and study interventionists are 
psychologists and are trained to deal with depression. Any participants whose responses during the 
group sessions  or on the PROMIS Depression Short Form  (raw score >33) indicate severe psychological 
distress (such as severe depression) will be interviewed by [CONTACT_7880], Co- I, or other appropriately 
trained professionals for suicide risk and risk of harm to self and others. Participants will be assisted to 
the emergency  room  if danger  is imminent or  referred  to either their physician or a mental health 
professional  if necessary .  
Intervention Integrity.  T o protect participants and maintain treatment integrity, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_595796]/interventionists on the intervention protocol . The intervention will be 
manualized to augment treatment fidelity and the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_595797]/supervision during intervention sessions and will hold weekly supervision meetings with interventionist s to review 
the protocol and ensure treatment compliance.  In addition, the Co- I (Kimberly Sibille) is a licen sed 
clinical psychologist who will be available for consultation/supervision during the intervention sessions.  
9.   Possible Benefits: While persistent pain is common in older adults, chronic low back pain is the 
leading cause of disability in this population and results in significant impairments in psychosocial and 
physical functioning. Participation in this research will provide the participant with a first -hand look at 
pain research and provide them with the opportunity to participate in a new self -management treatment

Moreover, our findings will enhance the understanding of underlying mechanisms contributing to treatment -
related effects in our proposed pain and psychological outcomes.  
 
Inclusion of Women and Minorities . Both male and female subjects will be recruited with the goal of 
equal gender distribution. It is planned that adult minorities ( 50+ years) will be included in the study 
sample in proportion to census levels in the Gainesville, [LOCATION_012] community including: 20% African -
American, 6% Asian, 5% Hispanic or Latino, and 3.6% More than One Race. To ensure that the study sample includes census levels of minorities, we will assess their representation periodically over the course of the study and adjust recruitment or ov er-sample as needed.  
 10.   Conflict of Interest: There is no conflict of interest involved with this study beyond the professional 
benefit from academic publication or presentation of the results.

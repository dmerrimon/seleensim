  Sponsor:  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
  Name [CONTACT_2756]:  AR-1105 (dexamethasone) implant for intravitreal administration  
  Name [CONTACT_19138]:  Dexamethasone  
  Study Title:  
A multicenter, open-label, safety and proof-of-concept study to  assess safety, tolerability and efficacy of 
AR-1105 in sub jects with macular edema due to retinal vein occlusion (RVO) 
  Study Number: AR-1105-CS201 
  Study Phase: Phase 2a 
  Primary Objective: 
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of 2 formulations of AR -1105 in subjects with macular edema due 
to branch RVO (BRVO) or central RVO (CRVO) 
  Secondary Objectives:  
• To evaluate the effect of AR-[ADDRESS_264036] Corrected Visual Acui ty (BCVA) by [CONTACT_219796] 
• To evaluate the effect of AR-1 105 on central retinal/foveal thi ckness (CRT/CFT) and subretinal fluid by 
[CONTACT_211682]-domain ocu lar coherence tomo graphy (SD-OCT)  
  Study Design:  
This will be a 6-month (with fo llow-up, if nece ssary, to monito r residual implant), open-label, multicenter, 
adaptive study evaluating the sa fety, tolerability, and efficac y of 2 formulations of dexamethasone 
intravitreal implant, AR-1105, in a single eye of up-to 45 subjects between 18 and 80 years of age with 
macular edema (ME) sec ondary to retinal vein occlusion (RVO).  Since this study represents the first-in-
human experience with AR-1105, th e study will begin with an ini tial phase, during which time, up to a 
maximum of 5 subjects will be t reated with AR-1105 clinical for mulation 1 (AR-1105-CF1) and followed 
during weekly visits for up to [ADDRESS_264037]-treatment to assess  tolerability and safety.  Providing none of the 
subjects experience any clinica lly-meaningful ocular adverse re actions (possibly) relat ed to treatment with 
AR-1105 during the initial phase , the study will continue into the randomized phase.  During the randomized 
phase of the study, subjects will be assigned in a 1:1 ratio to  either AR-1105-CF1 or AR-1105 clinical 
formulation 2 (AR-1105-CF2).  Data collected from the subjects enrolled into the randomized phase of the 
study will be primarily summarized separately from subjects enrolled during the initial phase.  
Treatment will consist of a singl e intravitreal administration with AR-1105-CF1  or -CF2, each of which has a 
target dose of 340 μg dexamethasone (2 implants, single injecti on).  During the randomized phase, each 
treatment group will enroll approximately 20 subjects (i.e. in addition to the enrolled subjects who will 
participate in the initial phase on AR-1105-CF1).  An interim a nalysis of the first [ADDRESS_264038] who presents at Month 6 with 
visible residual implant will be followed until they require re treatment (following the criteria provided for 
rescue therapy), or until [ADDRESS_264039] who, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1070], requires additional therapy for their RVO due to lack of efficacy after Month 3/Week 12.  
Minimum guideline criteria for considering rescue are an increa se in CRT of 50 μm a nd decrease in BCVA 
of ≥7 letters at any time compared to baseline.    
In the case of elevated intraocu lar pressure (IOP) or cataract,  investigators should tr eat the subject according 
to standard practice. In the ca se of a cataract, removal should  be performed as soon as possible since BCVA 
could be impacted b
y the catarac t.

Statistical  Methods:  
 
 
Sample Size 
This study  is not powered to detect a pre- stated efficacy signal, but rather will be used to inform the design 
and power for future studies.  With a sample size of [ADDRESS_264046] 9 5% confidence of ruling out adverse events with true incidence rates of 13.9% or higher within each 
treatment group .  That is, with 20 subjects in a treatment group, if an adverse event of a specific type is not 
observed, then with 95 % confidence, the true incidence rate of that adverse event is less than 13.9%.   
Safety Analysis: 
The primary safety analysis will summarize ocular and non- ocular treatment -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) using discrete summaries at the subject level by [CONTACT_219803] p.  Ocular TEAEs will be summarized separately for all study and fellow eyes.  A TEAE will 
be de fined as occurring after the first dose of study medication.  Serious adverse events and treatment- related 
ocular and non- ocular TEAEs will be summarized simila rly. Ocular and non -ocular TEAEs will also be 
summarized by [CONTACT_926].  
Slit lamp biomicroscopy and dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy measures will be summarized at each visit using discrete summary statistics.  
Intraocular pressure  (IOP) will be summarized at  each visit, using continuous and discrete summary 
statistics, including change from baseline and the proportion of study eyes with an increase from baseline in 
IOP of [ADDRESS_264047] 90% and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by [CONTACT_1570].  
Treatment group  comparisons will be compl eted using Fisher’s exact statistic and exact 90% and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) using the Farrington -Manning score statistic.  Additionally, exact logistic 
regression will be utilized to determine treatment effect on the percentage of  study eyes gaining at least 
15 letters in BCVA from baseline after adjusting for baseline BCVA.  These analyses will be used to

Clinical Study Protocol: AR-1105 -CS201, Amendme nt 1 Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Confidential  Page 13 of 59 determine differences in formulations  and to assess whether there are differences in outcomes between 
subjects’ data pre - and post- interim, to d etermine whether the data may be pooled .  
The efficacy summaries will be performed on the intent -to-treat (ITT) population using last observation 
carried forward (LOCF), imputing missing as failure, and using observed data only.  Subjects who receive 
rescu e medication prior to the summarized visit will be imputed as failure for the summarized visits.  No 
additional imputation methodologies will be performed in this early phase study, unless otherwise specified 
in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).   
The p ercentage of subjects gaining or losing at least [ADDRESS_264048] 10 letters at each study visit will be analyzed similarly.  
Change from baseline in BCVA letters to each on treatment  visit will be summarized using continuous 
summary statistics, including 90% and 95% CIs by [CONTACT_1570] .  
A linear model with change from baseline BCVA letters as the response, baseline BCVA letters as a covariate, and treatment group as a main effect factor will be fit to determine treatment group effect with 
separate models completed for each on treatment visit.  These analyses will be used to determine differences 
in formulations
 and may be used to assess whether there are differences in outcomes between subjects’ data 
pre- and post- interim to determine whether the data may be pooled .  Subjects who receive rescue medication 
prior to the summarized visit will have their measure replaced with their last observation prior to receiving rescue medication.  The least squares mean, standard error, and CI for each treatment group, and the 
difference between treatment groups, will be presented.  Additionally, analyses will be completed using 
individual two- sample t -tests and 90% and 95% CIs around the differenc e between treatment groups in mean 
BCVA and mean change from baseline BCVA.  
Median  time to achieve a treatment response of ≥ 15 letters improvement from baseline in BCVA and median 
time to rescue therapy will be estimated using Kaplan -Meier methods with 90 % and 95% CI calculated using 
the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley (1982) .  The logrank statistic will be used to determine differences 
in time to achieve response between the two treatment group s to determine differences in formulations
 and 
may be used to  assess whether there are differences in outcomes between subjects’ data pre - and post- interim 
to determine whether the data may be pooled.   Subjects receiving rescue medication will be considered 
censored on the day of rescue medication receipt.  Addition ally, the number and proportion of subjects who 
achieve a treatment response at each visit will be summarized.   
In all analyses, data from subject visits after receipt of rescue medication will be imputed using last 
observation prior to receiving rescue medication for continuous endpoints and will be imputed as failures for 
success/failure variables.

    1. INTRODUCTION  
Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is the second -most common sight- threatening vascular 
disorder of the retina after diabetic retinopathy (DR) (RCO 2015 , Klein 2000).  C urrent 
estimates put global prevalenc e at approximately 16 million p eople affected wi th the disease 
in one or both eyes and around 520 new cases per million are reported each year 
(Rogers 2010, Klein 2000). 
RVO is the result of thrombus formation in the central (CRVO), hemi- central (HRVO) or 
branch (BRVO) retinal vein, often due to compres sion by [CONTACT_219804] (RCO 2015).  The two main complications resulting from RVO are macular edema (ME) and retinal ischemia leading to retinal or iris neovascularization.  ME is 
a non- specific response of the reti na to a variety of insults and involves the breakdown of the 
blood- retina barrier at the capi[INVESTIGATOR_175347], which results in increased vascular 
permeability and subsequent leakage of fluids into the adjacent retinal tissues and significant visual distu rbances.  This reduction in vision may be reversible in the short-term, but chronic 
ME causes irreversible damage to the retina and permanent vision loss.  
Within the last 10 years, intravitreal pharmacotherapy has revolutionized the therapeutic options for ME-associated retinal vascular diseases, and particularly for RVO.  Current 
options for treating ME depend upon the cause and severity of the condition.  In the case of RVO, the goal is to reduce the amount of fluid leakage and decrease the edema, thus leading to improved visual acuity (VA).  Argon laser photocoagulation was used for many years to treat ME associated with BRVO, but was less effective in the treatment of CRVO, and was not successful in all patients ( Fekrat 1997).  Currently, two classes of medication are 
approved to treat ME following RVO – corticosteroids (such as OZURDEX
® dexamethasone 
intravitreal implant), and more recently,  anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_219777] (LUCENTIS®) and aflibercept (EYLEA®).  The anti- VEGFs , 
while effective at modulating vascular permeability,  do not address the inflammatory 
component of RVO however.  Corticos teroids have the advantage of targeting the three 
components of the pathophysiology of RVO;  reducing ME through inhibi tion of multiple 
inflammatory mediators, stabilizing  the blood brain barrier and decreasing vascular 
permeability (Zas 2017, OZURDEX PI).  Corticosteroids such as dexamethasone 
(OZURDEX ) and triamcinolone (KENALOG®) have demonstrated ME reduction and 
impro vement in  VA when dosed intravitreally ( Cekic 2005, Ip 2003, OZURDEX PI ).  
OZURDEX (0.7 mg dexamethasone) intravitreal implant has been  evaluated in RVO  and 
demonstrated efficacy up to 6 months ( Haller 2010 ), although the peak efficacy is generally 
achieved by [CONTACT_43380] 3 ( Joshi 2013, Bandello 2015 ). 
While both classes of medication have demonstrated efficacy in RVO patients, the treatment 
burden is high, with the anti -VEGFs  typi[INVESTIGATOR_219778] ( LUCENTIS  PI, 
EYLEA  PI) intravitreal injections, and the de xamethasone intravitreal implant typi[INVESTIGATOR_219779]-injection every 3 months ( Bezatis 2013 , Augustin 2014).  A corticosteroid 
implant that offered a longer duration of effect would provide the benefit of reducing the

    treatment burden on patients while treating the inflammatory components of ME that are not 
addressed by [CONTACT_219805].   
AR-1105 (dexamethasone intravitreal implant) is being developed at Aerie Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of ME following RVO.  AR- [ADDRESS_264057] -corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and anatomical markers of ME such 
as sub retinal fluid and central retinal thickness (CRT) in order to select the optimal implant 
to continue in clinical development.  The objective of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a longer-duration (>3months) lower- dose steroid implant, is based on the hypothesis that such a product may 
afford some safety benefits (e.g. potential reduction in the incidence of steroid- related 
adverse events and a lower treatmen t burden with respect to the number and frequency of 
intravitreal injections required) without compromising efficacy. 
The potential risks to subjects receiving AR -1105 are: 1) the risks associated with the use of 
dexamethasone in general; 2) the risks asso ciated with the intra vitreal injection procedure; 
3) the risk associated with the use of a solid, biodegradable implant in the vitreous; and 4) the 
risks associated with the use of the biodegradable polymers used for the sustained -release 
delivery system. 
Risks to human subjects participating in this study are based on the findings from pre- clinical 
studies, and on extensive safety, tolerability and efficacy data extrapolated from published 
studies and the FDA approval of OZURDEX.  Currently, there has been no exposure to 
AR-1105 in humans.   
Any intravitreal injection can be associated with the risk of endophthalmitis, ocular 
inflammation, increased intraocular pressure (IOP) and retinal detachments.  While 
investigators and study staff will be instructed t hat aseptic technique must be used at all times 
when handling the implant and applicator components, when loading the applicator, and when dosing the subject, there is an inherent risk of infection including endophthalmitis.  Similarly, as with other ocula r surgeries, there is a risk of cataract development.  Increased 
IOP is a risk due to both the addition of an implant into the vitreous cavity, and because the implant contains dexamethasone.  Corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, have been associated with increased IOP and the development of posterior subcapsular cataracts. 
AR-1105 is formulated as a solid, biodegradable, rectangular prism-shaped implant of 
dimensions of approximately   The implant is designed to undergo 
slow erosi on of the biodegradable matrix of different poly D, L- lactic -co-glycolic acid 
(PLGA) polymers to provide delivery of dexamethasone.  Dexamethasone, like other corticosteroids, is a potent anti-inflammatory agent that works by [CONTACT_219806]-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules and enzymes 
and other proteins that are activated during the inflammatory process (Barnes 2006, OZURDEX PI).  Steroid molecules readily diffuse across cell membranes and bind to 
glucocor ticoid receptors (GR) in the cytoplasm.  Thus activated, steroids control

including incidences of subconjunctival bleeding, blood on the end of an implant, and the presence of blood in the vitreous chamber after the dosing procedure.  The ocular observations were  attributed to the IVT injection procedur e and did not appear to be test

To evaluate the safety and tolerability of 2 formulations of AR-1105 in subjects with macular 
edema due to BRVO or CRVO  
2.2 Secondary  Objective (s) 
• To evaluate the effect of AR -1105 on BCVA by [CONTACT_219810] ( ETDRS ) methodology 
• To evaluate the effect of AR -1105 on CRT /CFT and subretinal fluid by [CONTACT_211682] -

provided for rescue therapy), or until [ADDRESS_264061] who, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], requires additional therapy for their RVO due to lack of efficacy after Month 3/Week 12.  Minimum guideline criteria for consideration of rescue are an increase in CRT  of 50 μm and decrease in BCVA of ≥[ADDRESS_264062].  The hypothesis is that a longer (>3 months) sustained release should necessitate less frequent intravitreal injections, and a 
lower steroid dose would potentially result in fewer, or less -frequent steroid -associated AEs 
without compromising effectiveness.  Taken together these attributes would reduce the 
burden of treatment.  The study is design ed to inform decisions on further development of

5.1.1 Study Drug  
AR-1105 dexamethasone intravitreal implant.   Two different formulations will be evaluated 
in this study, AR-1105-CF1 and AR-1105-CF2. 
 
   
 
  Prior to dosing, the applicator, consisting of a handle and a 25-gauge needle 
hub, will be assembled and b oth implants will be loaded into the lumen of the needle under 
aseptic conditions.   The applicator will then be used to  deliver the 2 implants by a single 
intravitreal injection.  The procedure for assembling the applicator and loading the implants 
is described in the separate Manual of Procedures (MoP).  
5.1.2 Placebo or Control Drug 
 
5.2 Treatments Administered  
Two implants each containing a target dose of 170 μg dexamethasone (for a total target dose 
of 340 μ g) will be injected intravitreally in to the study eye.  
5.3 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Patient 
A single intravitreal injection (with 2 implants) will be given on Day 1.  
5.3.1 Instructions for Administra tion of AR -1105 
 
 Following loading of the applicator with the 2 AR-1105 
implants, the procedure for administration of the implants is similar to that used for other intravitreal injections and should follow the guidelines on technique provided online by [CONTACT_219813] (AAO, www.aao.org).   
Precautions to minimize the risk of infection should be taken, and these include using appropriate barrier methods (sterile fields, drapes, gloves etc) and aseptic technique.  Preparation of the applicator is described in a separate Manual of Procedures.  Figure 1 i s an

    6.8 Performing Adverse Event (AE) Assessments  
This includes assessment of AE severity and rel ationship to investigational product.  AE 
information may be volunteered by [CONTACT_219818]-
leading questions. 
All AEs occurring during the study, regardless of the assumption of causal relationship, must 
be documented on the respective case report form ( CRF ).  Adverse events should be 
documented from the time the subject signs the informed consent until [ADDRESS_264078]’s last study visit .  
If a subject has an ongoing AE at the time of study completion, the ongoing AE must be followed-up and provided appropriate medical care until the event has resolved or stabilized.  
Documentation of AE s/adverse reactions includes start date and stop date, severity, action(s) 
taken, seriousness and outcome.  The following definitions of terms apply to this section:  
• Adverse event  (AE) . Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a 
drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. 
• Suspected adverse reaction (SAR) . Any AE  for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the AE. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘‘reasonable 
possibility’’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug 
and the AE . Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certa inty about 
causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE  caused by a drug. 
• Life-threatening AE or life -threatening SAR. An AE or SAR is considered “life-
threatening” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places 
the patient at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or SAR that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Serious adverse event (SAE) or serious suspected adverse reaction (SSAR) . An AE or 
SAR is considered ‘‘serious’’ if,  in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it 
results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life -threatening AE , patient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant 
incapacity or substantial disrup tion of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], 
based upon appropriate medica l judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergen cy room or at home, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

Confidential  Page 36 of 59  
    Note:  In the present study, Investigators are asked to report any loss in BCVA of ≥3 lines as 
a SAE.  
• Unexpected AE or unexpected SAR. An AE or SAR is considered ‘‘unexpected’’ if it 
is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure  (IB)  ‘Reference Safety Inf ormation’ or is 
not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed.  For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14213]) if the IB  referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Si milarly, cerebral 
thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14214]) if the IB  listed only cerebral vascular accidents. “Unexpected,” as used in 
this definition, also refers to AEs or SARs  that ar e mentioned in t he IB as occurring 
with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
Note: If an event occurs during the washout period (prior to subject enrollment and the administration  of study medication), it should be recorded as an AE .  
Note: Any medical condition present prior to administration of the  study medication which 
remains unchanged or improved should not be recorded as an AE  at subsequent visits. 
6.8.[ADDRESS_264079] be followed 
and provided appropriate medical care until the sign(s) and/or symptoms(s) of the AE have 
remitted or stabilized in  the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689]. 
When recording an AE, the following information should be provided on the study AE eCRF:  
1. Action Taken with Study Drug:  
• None 
• Investigational Product Discontinued 
2. Other Action Taken:

• Not Recovered/Not Resolved  
• Recovered/Resolved  
• Recovered/Resolved with sequelae  
• Recovering/Resolving 
• Unknown/Lost to follow-up 
6.8.2 Severity  
Severity of an AE  is defined as a qualitative assessment of the level of discomfort or the 
degree of intensity of an AE as determined by [CONTACT_19577]/her by [CONTACT_1560].  The assessment o f severity is made irrespective of study medication relationship or 
seriousness of the event and should be evaluated according to the following scale: 1 = Mild:  present and noticeable, but not distressing, and no disruption of normal daily 
activities.  
2 = Moderate:  bothersome, discomfort sufficient to possibly reduce or affect normal daily 
activity.  
3 = Severe:  incapacitating, with inability to work or perform normal daily activity.  
A change in severity for a reported AE will require a stop date for the previous severity and a 
new start and stop date for the new severity.  For example, a change in severity may go from mild to severe or from severe to moderate.  In both cases, the start and stop dates should be recorded.   
Please note: a severe AE is not the same as a serious AE.  Seriousness of an AE (NOT 
severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] 
for further information on serious AEs [SAEs]). 
6.8.3 Relationship  
The study medication r elationship for each AE/adverse reaction should be determined by [CONTACT_60265]:  
• Not Related:  The event is clearly related to other factors such as subject’s clinical 
condition; therapeutic interventions, concomitant disease o r therapy administered to 
the subject and does not follow a known response pattern to the product.

Clinical Study Pr otocol: AR-1105 -CS201, Amendment 1  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
 
   
Confidential  Page 38 of 59  
    • Unlikely Related: The event is most probably caused by [CONTACT_219819]’s underlying condition, therapeutic intervention, or concomitant therapy; or the delay between administration and the onset of the AE is incompatible with a causal relationship. Therefore, there is not a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by [CONTACT_7860]. 
• Possibly Related:  The event follows a reasonable, temporal sequence from the time of study medication administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the study medication, but could have been produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions or concomitant therapy administered to the subject. 
• Related:   The event follows a reasonable, temporal sequence from the time of study 
medication administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the study medication and cannot be reasonably explained  by [CONTACT_141477]’s 
clinical state, therapeutic interventions or concomitant therapy administered to the subject, and either occurs immediately following study medication administration, or improves on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_219788], or reappears on repeat exposure, or there is a positive reaction at the application site.  
6.8.[ADDRESS_264080] will be adequately anesthetized, but there will still 
be inherent risk associated with the procedure, including endophthalmitis and injection- site 
reactions (pain, inflammation).  
The most-common events noted in studies with rabbits and monkeys were conjunctival 
changes and vitreous hemorrhage associated with the procedure.  Additionally, ocular discharge and eye discoloration were observed but were not deemed to be AEs.  No post-
injection changes were observed in the retina, or in IOP.  Other  findings during follow-up 
were consistent with known class-effects of corticosteroids, including decreased white blood cell counts, decreased blood concentrations of urea, creatinine and phosphorus, and adrenal cortical atrophy.  
In the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_219789]- reported AEs during clinical trials 
are listed as increased IOP and conjunctival hemorrhage.  Other AEs reported included eye 
pain, conjunctival hyperemia, ocular hypertension, cataract, vitreous detachment, visual 
disturbance and vitreous fl oaters and headache.  Adverse events reported during the studies 
that were associated with the procedure, rather than the implant or dexamethasone treatment 
  
AR-1105  (dexamethasone) implant for intravitreal administration   
Clinical Study Pr otocol: AR-[ADDRESS_264081], and in the context of the 
entire study, is the responsibility of the Investigator.  The Sponsor additionally has overall responsibility for the safety of all subjects, and timely documentation and reporting of any 
safety concerns.  
6.8.6 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events 
Clinical laboratory values (other than pregnancy tests results) that are noted as abnormal and clinically significant at study exit and that are changes from Screening values will be documented as AEs.   
6.8.7 Serious Adverse Events, Serious Suspected Adverse Events, Serious Unexpected Suspected Adverse Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) or Serious Suspected Adverse Reactions 
(SSARs)  
An Investigator must immediately report any SAE or SSAR (see  Section  6.8 for definitions) 
to the Sponsor or Sponsor representative using the SAE report form , whether or not 
considered drug- related, including those listed in the protocol or IB and must include an 
assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event.  The 
Investigator must report any SAE or SSAR that occurs during the course of the study or  
within [ADDRESS_264082] 
provide follow-up information as soon as possible, again using the SAE report form.   
In addition, in the case of immediately life- threatening AEs or AEs with fatal outcome, or 
AEs that are serious, unexpected (i.e., not in the Clinical Investigator’s Brochure) and judged 
related to the investigational product, or a loss in BCVA ≥[ADDRESS_264083]’s last study visit,  must be reported and followed to outcome.  While 
pregnancy itself is not cons idered to be an AE or SAE, pregnancy reports are tracked by [CONTACT_219820] .  Premature terminations  including miscarriage, spontaneous 
abortion, or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be reported as an SAE.  Other pregnancy complications should be reported as SAEs, if they meet serious 
criteria.  Should a pregnancy result in a congenital anomaly or birth defect, a separate SAE 
report must be submitted  for the baby .  Furthermore, all neonatal deaths that occur within

S[LOCATION_003]R, the site must notify the Medical Monitors for the study (contact [CONTACT_219822]  [IP_ADDRESS]) using the SAE report form within [ADDRESS_264087] provide follow-up information as soon as possible using the SAE report form.  If the event is reported outside of re gular business hours 
and collected by [CONTACT_219823], their Medical Monitor will  notify the Sponsor Medical 
Monitor within 24 hours of knowledge of the e vent (contact [CONTACT_35659] [IP_ADDRESS]).  
Reports will be evaluated by [CONTACT_1689].  The IR B/IEC and Investigators at other 
study sites will be informed as required. 
6.9 Concomitant Medication Assessments  
Use of any medication – prescription or over- the-counter (OTC) should be recorded at the 
screening visit, and captured on the appropriate CRF, and the indication noted as part of the 
medical history.  Treatments that are permitted to continue throughout the duration of the study will be recorded as concomitant medications at all subsequent visits.  Judgment of 
continued study participation by [CONTACT_423], and inclusion of this subject’s subsequent visits in the safety and efficacy analysis will be made by [CONTACT_737].  
All medications which the subject has taken within 30 days prior to screening and during the study will be recorded in the CRF.  The name [CONTACT_18467], dose, route of administration,

9.1 General Considerations 
All continuous study assessments will be summarized by [CONTACT_3148] [and phase ( initial vs. 
randomized) for CF1] and visit (as applicable) using descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, 
standard deviation, minimum, and maximum ).  All categorical study assessments will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_10659] (as applicable) using frequency counts and percentages.   All study data will be listed by [CONTACT_3148] [and phase ( initial vs randomized) for CF1], patient 
and visit  (as applicable).  
The unit of analysis for efficacy will be the study eye. Statistical methods will be more fully described in separate document(s) (i.e., the Statistical 
Analysis Plan).  
9.[ADDRESS_264094] 95% confidence of ruling out AEs  with true 
incidence rates of 13.9% or higher within each treatment group.  That is, with 20 subjects in a treatment group , if an AE  of a specific type is not observed, then with 95% confidence, the 
true incidence rate of that adverse event is less than 13.9%.    
9.3 Anal ysis Populations  
9.3.1 Safety Population 
The safety population will include all subjects who received study medication.  This population will be used to summarize safety variables and will summarize subjects as treated.

    9.3.2 Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population  
The ITT p opulation will include all subjects who received study medication .  This population 
will be the primary population for efficacy analyses and will be used to summarize all 
efficacy variables and will summarize subjects as treated . 
9.3.3 Per Protocol (PP) Populati on 
The PP population is a subset of the ITT population, which will include those subjects who do not have major protocol violations likely to seriously affect the efficacy  outcomes of the 
study.  This population will be the secondary population for efficacy analyses and will be used to summarize a subset of efficacy variables.  If the PP and ITT populations are exactly the same, then additional efficacy analyses on the PP population will not be performed.  The PP population will summarize subjects as treate d. 
9.4 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics such as age, gender, race, and ethnicity will be 
summarized and listed.  Medical history, history of ocular surgery and procedures, and RVO 
history will also be summarize d and listed. 
9.5 Primary Safety Assessments and Analyses 
The primary safety analysis will summarize ocular and non -ocular treatment- emergent 
adverse events (TEAEs) using discrete summaries at the subject level by [CONTACT_219827].  Ocular TEAEs will be summarized separately 
for all study and fellow eyes.  A TEAE will be defined as occurring after the first dose of study medication.  Serious adverse events and treatment-related ocular and non-ocular TEAEs will be su mmarized similarly.  Ocular and non- ocular TEAEs will also be 
summarized by [CONTACT_926].  
Slit lamp biomicroscopy and dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy measures will be summarized at each visit using discrete summary statistics.  
Intraocular pressure will be sum marized at each visit, using continuous and discrete summary 
statistics, including change from baseline and the proportion of study eyes with an increase from baseline in IOP of 10 mmHg or more and the proportion of study eyes with IOP of 30 mmHg or more. 
Vital signs and safety laboratory data will be summarized at each visit, using continuous 
summary statistics, including change from baseline.

• Percentage of subjects requiring rescue therapy overall and by [CONTACT_765] 
9.6.[ADDRESS_264095] 90% and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by [CONTACT_1570].  Treatment group comparisons will  be completed using 
Fisher’s exact statistic and exact 90% and 95% CIs using the Farrington -Manning score 
statistic.  Additionally, exact logistic regression will be uti lized to determine treatment effect 
on the percentage of study eyes gaining at least 15 letters in BCVA from baseline after adjusting for baseline BCVA.  These analyses will be used to determine differences in 
formulations and to assess whether there are differences in outcomes between subjects’ data pre- and post- interim to determine whether the data may be pooled . 
The efficacy summaries will be performed on the ITT population using last observation 
carried forward (LOCF), imputing missing as failure, and using observed data only.  Subjects who receive rescue medication prior to the summarized visit will be imputed as failure for the summarized visits. No additional imputation methodologies will be performed in this early phase study, unless otherwise speci fied in the SAP .

statistic and exact 90% and 95% CIs  using the Farrington- Manning score statistic.  
Change from baseline in BCVA letters to each on treatment visit will be summarized using continuous summary statistics, including 90% and 95% CIs by [CONTACT_1570].  
A linear model with change from  baseline BCVA letters as the response, baseline BCVA 
letters as a covariate, and treatment group as a main effect factor will be fit to determine 
treatment group effect with separate models completed for each on treatment visit.  
 
.  Subjects who receive rescue medication prior to 
the summarized visit will have their measure replaced with their last observation prior to 
receiving rescue medication.  The least squares mean, standard error, and CI for each 
treatment group, and the difference between treatment groups, will be presented.  Additionally, analyses will be completed using individual two -sample t -tests and 90% and 
95% CIs around the difference between treatment groups in mean BCVA and mean change from baseline BCVA.  
Median time to achieve a treatment response of ≥ 15 letters improvement from baseline in 
BCVA and median time to rescue therapy will be estimated using Kaplan -Meier methods 
with 90% and 95% CI  calculated using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley (1982) .  The 
logrank statis tic will be used to determine differences in time to achieve response between 
the two treatment groups to determine differences in formulations and may be used to assess 
whether there are differences in outcomes between subjects’ data pre- and post- interim  to 
determine whether the data may be pooled .  Subjects receiving rescue medication will be 
considered censored on the day of rescue medication receipt.  Additionally, the number and proportion of subjects who achieve a treatment response at each visit wil l be summarized.  
Cox proportional hazards may also be used to analyze time to response, including baseline BCVA as a covariate.  
In all analyses, data from subject visits after receipt of rescue medication will be imputed using last observation prior to receiving rescue medication for continuous endpoints and will be imputed as failures for success/failure variables.

Clinical Study Pr otocol: AR-[ADDRESS_264101] of clinical trials on human subjects.  This includes, but is not necessarily limit ed to: the approval of IRB/IECs , the Helsinki Declaration , US FDA Law , 
ICH E6 (GCP) R2 guidelines, obtaining prospective informed consent, monitoring of the conduct of the study and the completeness of the CRFs by [CONTACT_4885](s); and appropriate record retention by [CONTACT_737].  Applicable IRB/I EC, Investigator/Sponsor 
obligations, study monitoring and protocol change procedures are detailed in Sections 10.[ADDRESS_264102] be maintained 
in the study files at the Investigator’s site.  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that no subject is subject to any study- related 
examination or activity before that subject has given inf ormed consent. The subject must give 
written consent after the receipt of detailed information.  The verbal explanation will cover all the elements specified in the written information provided for the subject.  
It should be emphasized that the subject is at liberty to withdraw consent to participate at any time, without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled. 
Subjects who refuse to give, or withdraw, written informed consent may not be included or 
continued in this study, but this will not impact on their subsequent care.  
The investigator will inform the subject of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits and potential hazards of the study, including any discomfort it may entail. The subject must be given every opportunity to c larify any points he/she does not understand and if necessary, ask 
for more information.  At the end of the interview, the subject may be given time to reflect if this is required, or if the subject requests more time.  Subjects and/or legal guardian will be 
required to sign and date the informed consent form. 
Signed informed consent must be attained prior to the conductance of any study procedures. 10.[ADDRESS_264103] Confidentiality  
The Investigator and his/her staff will maintain all personal subject data collected and 
processed for the purposes of this study using adequate precautions to ensure confidentiality,

• Study progress 
• Compliance with the protocol • Completion of CRFs  
• Dispensing, storage, and accountability of investigational product 
• Source data verification  
• AE and SAE reporting • Essential documents contained within the Investigator’s site file  
For source data verification (i.e., comparison of CRF entr ies with subject records), data will 
be 100% source verified and will include as a minimum:  
• Subject identification  
• Informed consent (procedure, signature, and date)  • Selection criteria  
• Primary efficacy and safety parameters (i.e., AEs)  
Member(s) of the Sponsor or their designee will meet with the Investigator prior to the 
initiation of the study in order to assess the adequacy of the Investigator's subject population, 
facilities, and equipment, and to familiarize the Investigator with the protocol. 
A member of the Sponsor or their designee in the role of Study Monitor will subsequently 
meet with the Investigator after several of the subjects have initiated the study in order to

been provided and that the assignment of medication is properly recorded. In addition, the 
Study Monitor will verify that the Investigator follows the approved protocol and all approved amendments, if any, by [CONTACT_219831]’s regulatory documents, source documents, ICFs , and CRFs  of study subjects. 
The Study Monitor will meet with the Investigator when all subjects have completed the Final Visit of the study, in order to collect unused study medications and unused suppli es and 
materials.  
Interim monitoring visits and telephone consultations will be done by [CONTACT_219832], to ensure the proper progression and documentation of the study. 
10.[ADDRESS_264107] source documentation.  The 
location and nature of the source documentation for all data collected in the study will be identified in the study files at the investigator’s site. In cases where no source documents will be used (i. e., data will be recorded directly onto the CRF without first being recorded on 
another document, such as a flowsheet, laboratory report, or other typi[INVESTIGATOR_219791]), the original data will be included in the  CRF.  
Source document information should be legible. Recorded data should only be corrected by [CONTACT_740] a single line through the incorrect entry and writing the revision next to the corrected data.  The person who has made the correction should place his or her initials as well as the date of the correction next to the correction.  Data may not be obliterated by [CONTACT_63049], redaction, or with correction fluid.  
Study data will be transcribed and recorded via an electronic data capture (EDC) system as electroni c CRFs (eCRFs). Security and authorization procedures consistent with the EDC 
system must be used. At each subject visit, the appropriate eCRFs must be completed.  Whenever an eCRF is used, be sure to provide all information requested including subject identification number and initials, name [CONTACT_219841], date(s), etc.  All applicable questions should be answered, and all data requested should be provided.  Those areas that require a response but are not filled in correctly are considered inco mplete or 
erroneous entries and will have to be corrected.   
Each authorized study staff member will receive a unique access account in order to use the EDC system. Access accounts will not be shared among study staff. Authorized users will make entries and/or changes to eCRFs via a secure internet access. Each completed set of eCRFs will be reviewed by [CONTACT_219833].  
The study records must include a copy of each Investigator's CV and medical license, and statement of Investigator qualifications. The name [CONTACT_219842] -investigator working under 
the supervision of the investigator is also required to be filed in the study records. In addition, 
  
AR-1105  (dexamethasone) implant for intravitreal administration   
Clinical Study Pr otocol: AR-[ADDRESS_264108] charts/source documents, Investigator’s Brochure, protocol, protocol 
amendments, correspondence with the Sponsor/designee and the IRB/IEC , investigational 
product storage, receipts, returns and dispensing records, Delegation of Responsibilities Log, site training records, records of site monitoring, any unmasking documentation, AE and SAE reporting, IRB/IEC approvals, advertisements, written information provided to subjects, and subject completed ICFs will be included in the study records.  
If the Investigator moves, withdraws from an investigation, or retires, the responsibility for maintaining the records may be transferred to another person (e.g., Sponsor, other Investigator) who will accept the responsibility. Notice of this transfer,  including written 
acceptance, must be made to and agreed upon by [CONTACT_1034].  
10.10 Protocol Deviations 
Per ICH E6 (GCP) R2 Section 4.5.1 the investigator/institution should conduct the trial in 
compliance with the protocol agreed with the sponsor and, if required, by [CONTACT_219834]/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_219792]/I EC  
Protocol waivers or deviations from the protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria are not allowed because they can potentially jeopardize the scientific integrity of the study regulatory 
acceptability or subject safety.  Therefore, adherence to the criteria as specified in the 
protocol is essential.  
The site will contact [CONTACT_219835] /exclusion criteria as needed prior to enrollment of  the study subject.  The Sponsor will document clarification requests 
and responses or their representative.  If a subject does not meet all the inclusion and exclusion criteria during screening, that subject may not be enrolled into the study. 
If a protocol deviation is identified by [CONTACT_219836]/IEC may be required e.g. 24 or 48 hours.  The Sponsor will assess any protocol deviation and decide whether any of these non- compliances should be 
reported to the relevant competent authority as a serious breach of GCP and the protocol. If per the relevant competent authorities’ requirements, the protocol deviation is not required to be reported immediately but is still re quired to be noti fied to the IRB/IEC, the specific 
protocol deviation will be added to the annual progress report.   
The Sponsor will review, designate, and/or approve all protocol deviations prior to the 
database lock. 
10.11 Access to Source Documentation  
The Investigator will permit study- relate d monitoring visits, audits, IRB/IEC review, and 
regulatory inspection(s) by [CONTACT_60282].

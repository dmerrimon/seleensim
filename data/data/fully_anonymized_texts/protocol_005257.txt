8 1. Introduction  
1.1 Study Significance  
The landmark 2014 Surgeon General’s Report concluded that for individuals with 
cancer, persistent smoking results in increased toxicity, poor cancer treatme nt, 
response, and i ncreas ed risk for disease recurrence and second primary 
cancers.1 Accordingly, in 2016 the Tobacco Control Research Working Group’s 
priorities presented to the NCI’s Board of Scientific Advisors emphasized the 
need to develop and test ef fective cessation t reatme nts for cancer patients with 
persistent tobacco use.[ADDRESS_1278342] study to examine the 
effectiveness and implementation of a virtually -delivered evidence -based 
tobacco treatment into cancer care for patients at  NCORP community si tes, 
including NCORP minority/underserved community sites ( >30% of patients are 
racial/ethnic minorities or rural residents ). Since 80% of patients receive their 
cancer care in the community, 17 and as many community -based oncology 
netwo rks serve large rur al pop ulations and lack resources, this is a tremendous 
opportun ity to examine and implement an evidence -based treatment to an NCI 
priority population of vulnerable patients.  NCORP community sites identified 
evidence -based cessation serv ices as a priority.  In 20 16 the NCI -AACR Cancer 
Patient Tobacco Use Assessment Task  Force 23 delineated implementation 
strategies. Our proposal evaluates 3 of these priorities: evaluation of 1) effective 
means of delivering tobacco treatment, including mot ivational approache s and 
telemedicine; 2) the effects of cessation treatment modera tors; and 3) cost -
effectiveness.  
NCORP community sites provide access to a diverse population of cancer 
patients making them ideal for studying effectiveness and implementat ion of 
tobacco trea tment in real-world cancer care settings. The NCI recently launc hed 
NCORP to coordinate trials among its community sites, which are organized 
networks of community -based oncology programs, including 
minority/underserved community sites. The goal of NCORP i s to c onduct cancer 
control research in communities where patien ts receive their care, with a priority 
on improving access and evaluating innovative cancer care delivery models, 
particularly among underserved and underrepresented populat ions. Our proposal 
is clo sely aligned with NCORP priorities  
Tobacco use following a  cancer diagnosis is prevalent and compromises 
treatment outcomes. About 10% to 30% of cancer patients are smoking at the 
time of diagnosis, 5-8, 24, 25 and the majority of cancer patients who  smoke  at 
diagnosis continue to smoke following diagnosis.7,26 Quitting smoking upon 
cancer diagnosis may improve cancer treatment effectiveness, reduce risk of 
recurrence and of developi[INVESTIGATOR_910390],1,13-15, 27 -30 and improve 
chances of survival.5, 31 -33 Conversely, continuing to smoke may result in 
diminishe d quality of life,5, 34 , 35 treatment delays and increased treatment 
complications.6,10-12, 36 -44 
National initiatives emphasize the importance of identifying smokers in can cer 
care settings. In 201 1, the Joint Commission and Medicare adopted National 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_910391], counseling, and medication.45 Smoking status 
was designated as a co re objective in the  2010 “Meaningful Use” EHR 
documentation.46, 47 The 2013 AACR re leased guidelines emphasize the 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
9 provision of tobacco cessation services to cancer patients.48 The American 
Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommends cessa tion counselin g to all 
smokers as a cor e quality indicator.49 In 2015 the National Comprehensive 
Cancer Network (NCCN) published Smoking Cessation guidelines to formalize 
these initiatives.2We propose to implement a virtually -delivered tobacco 
treatment to help communit y cancer centers me et nat ional recommendations.  
Integrated, evidence -based services  are needed, but are lacking, during cancer 
care.  The USPHS Practice Guidelines recommend that evidence -based tobacco 
treatment – specifically, combined medication and couns eling – be delivered  to all 
smokers in health care settings, yet little progress has  been made to integrate 
these guidelines into cancer care.[ADDRESS_1278343] all believed that having a tobacco treatment program is “very 
important”  but o nly half had any such type of program.[ADDRESS_1278344],5,52-55 and many cancer 
patie nts who smoke want to qui t smoking.52, 53, 56, 57  Additionally, little work has 
been done to explore the delivery and effectiveness of tobacco treatment among 
racial/ethnic minority cancer patients who are at risk for continued smoking. 3, 58, 
[ADDRESS_1278345] essed after treatment completion.60 A 
recent national stud y61 found that smokers treated for cancer were significantly 
more likely than smokers without cancer to try to quit smoking.  
Tobacco use is not being assessed or intervened upon during cancer care. 
Assessment of tobacco dependence among cancer patients is lacking; 62-64 in 
particular, rates of smoking assessment are lower in non -academic medical 
settings (i.e., community settings).[ADDRESS_1278346] cancer patients do not get 
assistance ( e.g., medications, counseling) to quit and/or stay quit.68-70 Only 30% -
40% of oncologists provide assistance to help patients quit smoking. 62, 63, [ADDRESS_1278347]. Park found that Cancer Care Outcomes 
Research & Surveillance Consortium (CanCORS) participants who were smoking 
at diagnosis had less education and more often had public health insurance 
(p<.001).[ADDRESS_1278348].77,78 
Cancer patients who report persistent smoking need intensive treatment, often 
endorsing high rates o f nicotine dependen ce and  household smoking.79 Cancer 
patients who smoke often expe rience internalized stigma; 80, [ADDRESS_1278349] analyses of in tervention costs.83 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, [ADDRESS_1278350] from fee -for-service 
payment (accountable care organization, epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] -based payment, etc.) will 
heighten the demand for cost data. Smoking cessation trials conducted with 
cancer pati ents have  not exami ned tr eatment costs. Our current R01 trial results 
will contribu te the first cost analyses of smoking cessation treatments for cancer 
patients at the time of diagnosis, but these are limited to comprehensive cancer 
centers. The proposed trial will extend t his wo rk and be the first cost analyses to 
be conducted in cance r community settings.  
Implementation outcomes to be gained from the proposed hybrid -
effectiveness trial.  In summary, the NCI, ASCO, AACR, and NCCN promote 
incorporating toba cco treatment into the de livery of cancer care, but this has 
never been done in com munity cancer centers. Trial findings will establish the 
effectiveness and cost of utilizing a virtual strategy to deliver evidence -based 
tobacco treatment in community onco logy settings and p rovide  detailed initial 
data on implementation processes that wi ll inform subsequent testing of multi -
level implementation strategies for broad national dissemination into community 
cancer care settings.  
Building on current work to enhan ce virtual tobacco treatm ent delivery.  Our 
preliminary R01 (the Smokefree Support S tudy 1) data demonstrates that an 
intensive tobacco treatment, delivered in -person (during outpatient and inpatient 
cancer center appointments) and via phone, targeted to th e needs of recently  
diagn osed cancer patients (breast, lung, GU, GI, ob/gyn, lympho ma, head and 
neck, and melanoma), is effective. We believe that face -to-face contact [CONTACT_910445] -counselor rapport. In our previous study, patients  
had the opportunit y to m eet counselors in -person during treatments, but the wide 
geographic distribution of cancer clinics within community -based setting limits the 
ability for tobacco treatment access and in -person contact. Recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_910392] r patients,117-[ADDRESS_1278351] been only two  studies using vide oconfe rencing to deliver smoking cessation 
programs, but both required patients to come into clinics  to use the technology; 
both found it to be feasible to deliver and reported high reported patient 
satisfaction. [CONTACT_574841] concluded th at videoconferencin g deli vered cessation 
groups  produced quit rates similar to  in-person  groups.[ADDRESS_1278352] to 
offer virtual delivery, via remote videoconference, of a tobacco treatment to 
cancer patients. We will leverage existing systems; we developed 
English/Sp anish treatment pro tocols , electronic data capture systems, 
medication algorithms, cost tracking templates, and motivational interviewing 
counseling fid elity and supervision materials . The proposed trial improves reach 
by: 1) using videoconferencing to bri ng a tobacco counse lor (s ynchronous visits) 
directly to patients; 2) bringing tobac co treatment into community cancer centers; 
3) offering tobacco treatment to diverse patients; and 4) incorporating 
involvement of cancer clinicians, t hrough delivery of bri ef videos .

low-SES, English and Spanish -speaking smokers that compared quitline referral 
to phone -based mot ivational counselin g call s with a tobacco counselor 
embedded in the health care sys tem and NRT.84 The intervention significantly 
increased tobacco abstinence at 9 months compared to usual care (18% vs. 8%; 
p<.001). Drs. Rigotti and Park also collaborated o n an RCT of a smoki ng

testing th e effe ctiveness of several systems -level, implementation strateg ies to 
improve adherence to tobacco treatment guidelines in community -based public 
health dental clinics.129 In June 2016, Drs. Park, Ostroff and Perez participated in 
a new  NCI initiative, SP eeding  Research -tested INTerventions which focuses on 
integratin g research trial -based interventions into real -world settings. They 
conducted 30 interviews with stakeholders to discuss barriers to implementing 
tobacco treatment training and programs for on cology  patients. These interviews 
confirmed 1) the need for a na tional tobacco treatment program, 2) the need for 
tobacco treatment delivery to be specialized for cancer patients, and 3) that 
oncology clinicians, although strongly suppor tive of tobacco tre atment  for their 
patients, lacked tobacco treatment training exp erience and time.130 In September 
2016, Drs. Wagner , Park and Ostroff were awarded an NCI supplement to 
administer the AACR tobacco assessment to 1000 patients (at enrollme nt, 3 and 
6 months) in EC OG/ACRIN NCORP tria ls to determine the effects of tobacco u se 
on patient’s a) physical and psychological symptoms and b) cancer treatment 
duration, dose intensity, and therapeutic benefit. These developments strengthen 
the team’s a bility to assess imp lemen tation of tobacco treatment in cancer care 
settings.

1.[ADDRESS_1278354] the effectiveness of our clinical intervention while also 
gathering key informa tion on its delivery  and potential for 
implementation in a real -world situation. Thi s design choice fits the 3 
recommended conditions for Hybrid Type 1 use, specifically: 1) strong 
face validity for the intervention that would support applicability to the 
new setting (NCORP c enter s), population (more diverse cancer 
patients), or delivery method (synchronous videoconferencing); 2) 
strong base of indirect evidence (data from different but associated 
populations) for the intervention; and 3) minimal risk assoc iated with 
the inter venti on, both its direct risk and any indirect risk through 
replacement of a known adequate intervention. Our design compares 
the effectiveness and implementation of Enhanced Usual Care (EUC: 
Asking about tobacco use, Advising current t obacco users to quit  and 
Referral to NCI Q uitline) versus an evidence -based Virtual 
Intervention Treatment (VIT; Asking about tobacco use, Advising 
current tobacco users to quit and Referral to a centralized NCORP 
tobacco coach for a videoconferencing inte rvention).  
1.3.2  Virtual A pproa ch: Referral and Delivery  
An IT platform  will be used to re cruit patients to the study  via a Virtual 
Clinician Referral . Brief, educational videos will be created for  
patients. Through this virtual clinician referral , clinicians ca n engage in 
a suppor tive collaborative care approach to underscore the 
importance of  cancer patients addressing their tobacco use and 
encouraging treatment participation.  
These brief videos can be accessed via a computer, tablets , or 
smartphones , and sent via secure email pla tform. To enhance patient 
engagement and standardized clinician care delivery, MGH staff will 
be available to support our brief video  development and 
implementation. Working with the MGH team, we will develop a brief 
(approximately  1-2 minutes) video that introduces the study and 
encourages participation in the study. These videos will build on our 
extensive experience in recruiting and retaining participants in study 
trials.  
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
13 In an effort to standardize usual care, a script  will be provi ded to each 
individu al site, and the virtual clinician referral  will be recorded by a 
site-designated oncology provider at each participating NCORP 
center. These brief videos will introduce the tobacco treatment 
program and ask about smoking behavior, norm alize tobacco use to  
decrease internalized stigma, advise  cancer patients of the 
importance of quitting/decreasing their smoking, encourage 
behavioral and medication support, refer patients to the program, and 
encourage follow -up with the treatment group r eferral.  
1.3.3  Conceptual Frame work for Treatment  
Our tobacco counseling sessions, which a ddress tobacco use in the 
context of a cancer diagnosis, combines two theoretical lenses —a 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_894584] a health behavior change model. The 
Self-Regulation  Model (SRM)147,148 focus es on the dynamic process 
between beliefs, emotions and cop ing, and has been widely used to 
study patients’ copi[INVESTIGATOR_910395]. Applying the SRM to a cancer 
diagnosis, changes in beliefs about cancer outcomes may lead 
smokers to en gage in quitting as a strategy to cope with the cognitive 
and emotional threat of ca ncer. If individuals’ evaluation of the effects 
of quitting, physical changes (e.g., breathing has improved) and 
environmental influences (e.g., smokefree home), make them feel 
better, then th ey wi ll stay quit. If quitting smoking decreases a sense 
of sham e and anxiety, this will increase chances of staying quit. The 
HBM149 posits that when faced with a health threat, individuals are 
more likely to change a behavior if they feel the threat is s eriou s, they 
are at risk, they are able to make the change, and the cha nge would 
decrease their risk. Applying the Health Belief Model (HBM) to a 
cancer diagnosis, smokers will be more likely to engage in tobacco 
treatment and quit if t hey 1) believe that conti nued smoking after a 
cancer diagnosis threatens health, 2) understand that continuing to 
smoke puts them at risk for poor outcomes, 3) are confident they can 
quit, and 4) believe quitting will improve outcomes.  
1.3.4  Rationale  for NRT  
The selection of combi natio n NRT is based on the current 
recommendations for the NCCN Smoking Cessation Guidelines2 and 
data from our prior clinical trial demonstrating safety and strong 
patient preferences. Smokefree Support Study 1  intervention arm 
partici pants were  offered a  choice of NRT (patch and /or lozenge) , 
bupropi[INVESTIGATOR_910396] (Zyban, Wellbutrin), or varenicline 
(Chantix) . In preliminary analyses as of February 2018, 80% of 
Intervention Treatment group participants elected to receive a 
smoking  cessation medicatio n, am ong which 83% selected NRT.  
Reported NRT medication side ef fects have been minor (e.g., tingling 
sensation on tongue, vivid dreams). Thus, given patient preferences 
and safety results from the R01 trial, combined with the ability t o 
deliver the NRT vi a mai l, patch and lozenge will be used in this trial. 
Additional ly, NRT is being used by [CONTACT_910447], has 
successfully been used with cancer patients,150,151 is available over -
the-counter, and is covered by [CONTACT_910448]. 
Lastly, the NCCN guidelines concluded that b lood2 nicotine levels 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
14 from NRT, including combination NRT, are significantly less than from 
smoking cigarettes; additionally, there is insufficient evidence that 
NRT causes cancer in humans or inc reases risk of myoca rdial 
infarction or cardiovascular disease.51,152,[ADDRESS_1278355] patients directly (via phone, e -mail,  or text 
messaging) to schedule the virtual counseling sessions. Counseling 
sessions will be conduct ed via MGH TeleHealt h, which  connects 
providers to patients through virtual HIPAA -compliant 
videoconferencing technology including: phone, video, email, mob ile 
applications and remote monitoring. These virtual visits are conducted 
via a videoconference pla tform that addresses  clinica l privacy and 
security (e.g., Zoom, Doximity, or other H IPPA -compliant platform). 
2017 Pew findings154, 155 showed that 74% of a dults ages 50 -64 
(average projected age of proposed study sample) own Smart 
Phones, and 87% use the internet; thus, a we b-based option is a 
feasible modality.[ADDRESS_1278356] been created at the 8th grade reading 
level.160 The counseling will be delivered by a study -designated 
tobacco treatment coach based at MGH and trained in a Motiva tional 
Interviewing (MI) sty le161-162, structured according to the 5As format 
and pe rsonalized to participant’s cessation readiness and cancer 
treatment phase (initiation, transitions, surveillance) . MI is an 
empathic and supportive style of treatment [ADDRESS_1278357]. Park has effectively used 
MI to promote quitting among childhood cancer survivors an d lung 
cancer patients.79,126 MI is particularly eff ective with cancer p atients;  1) 
MI focuses on building and maintaining self -confiden ce, and our pi[INVESTIGATOR_910397]; 2) the main 
MI tools (e.g., affirmations, refl ections) are effective when addressing 
sensitive top ics, such as cancer and smok ing-related beliefs (e.g., 
shame, fear of recurrence), a nd in delivering sensitive information 
(e.g., risks of smoking during cancer treatment);161 and 3) MI skills will 
encour age and sustain quit motivation.  
Of note, the interv ention counseling as  deliver ed here is a psycho -
educational program, and is not bein g delivered as clinical care.

Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, [ADDRESS_1278358] udy is designed to compare the effectiveness and 
implementation of an Enhanced Usual Care (EUC; control group) versus a Virtual 
Intervention Treatment (VIT; intervention gr oup) for tobacco ces sation i n newly 
diagnosed cancer patients who smoke. Trial findi ngs will establish the effectiveness and 
cost of utilizing a virtual strategy to deliver evidence -based tobacco treatmen t in 
community oncology settings and provide detaile d initial data on im plementa tion 
processes that will inform subsequent testing of mu lti-level implementation strategies for 
broad national dissemination into community cancer care settings.  
2.1 Study Aims : 
2.1.1  Aim 1: To assess treatment effectiveness, by [CONTACT_910449] (EUC) and 
Virtual Tobacc o Treatment (VIT) study arms abstinent post 
enrollment .  
2.1.2  Aim 2:  To assess the potential effect of  potential moderators ( e.g., 
sociodemographics, medical  and smoking history , cancer variables) 
on treat ment effectiveness between the two arms.  
2.1.3  Aim 3:  To asses s the processes of implementation and dissemination 
(acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, treatment fidelity, cost 
effectiveness, penetration/reach, and sustainability ) of delivering  
tobacco trea tment intervention s at community oncology sites.  
2.2 Primary  Objective:  
2.2.1  Treatment effectiveness (Aim 1)  
To compare the proportions of participants in the Enhanced Usual 
Care (EUC) and Virtual Tobacco Treatment (VIT) study arms with 
biochemically -verifi ed 7-day point -prevalence abstinence from 
cigarettes at 6-months  post enrollment.  
We will define biochemically -verified 7 -day point -prevalence 
abstinence at 6 month follow -up by:  
• saliva cotinine (<  15 ng/ml) , or 
• expi[INVESTIGATOR_393524] (<  10ppm)  
2.3 Secondary O bjective s: 
2.3.1  Secon dary treatment effectiveness (Aim 1)  
Secondary smoking o utcomes (5) include : 
• Biochemically -verified 7 -day point prevalence abstinence at 3 -
months follow -up 
• Self-reported 7 -day point prevalence cigarette abstinence at 3 - 
and 6 -months follow -up 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
16 • Signi ficant r eduction  (> 50% reduction in reported number of 
cigarett es per day)  in daily smoking from baseline to 3 - and 
baseline to 6-months follow -up 
• Continuous (no self -reported smoking  since last survey point) and 
sustained abstinence a t 6 months  (cotinine -verifie d at 3-months 
and 6 -months)  
2.4 Exploratory O bjectives  
Aim 2 : To assess the potential effect of known and potential moderators on 
treatment effectiveness between the two arms.  
Exploratory analyses will examine the moderator  and medi ator effects on 
treatment ef fectiveness (Aim 2).  
Moderators /Mediators  of primary int erest:  
• Sociodemographics:  Sex, age, marital status, race/ethnicity, education level, 
financial burden , health insurance,  internet and smartphone access and 
modality  
• Smoking  history:  Years smok ed, dail y smoking rate, other tobacco/nicotine 
use (e.g., cigars , cigarettes), current/past use of tobacco treatments, nicotine 
dependence  
• Cancer variables:  Cancer type, cancer stage, treatment, and days since 
diagnosis  
• Site characteris tics: Site, geograph ic locat ion, clinic volume, baseline 
organizational readiness, s ite usual care  
Additional moderators /mediators  to be explored:  
• Medical history:  ECOG Performance Status,  alcohol use  
• Quality of life/emotions:  Emotional distress, copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], anxiety, depression  
• Cancer an d smoking beliefs:  Stigma,  quit motivation, self -efficac y to quit, 
importance of quitting, perceived benefits of quitting smoking , quit -smoking 
medication beliefs  
• Physical symp toms:  Cravings  
• Environmental influences:  Level of se cond -hand smoke expo sure, pe rceived 
social support , perceived provider support  
Aim 3 : To assess the processes of implementation and dissemination 
(acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, treatment fidel ity, cost effectiveness, 
penetration/reach, and sust ainability) of our i ntervent ion at community oncology 
sites 
Guided by [CONTACT_910450]’ (2011) recommendations for measurement of 
implementation outcomes, we will explore the following to gain an in itial 
understanding of the  implementation process (A im 3).  
Implementatio n Outcom es 
• Acceptability:  Patient satisfaction with content/deli very of their randomly 
assigned tobacco treatment  
• Adoption:  Site program uptake, changes in organizational readiness  to deliver 
tobacco treatment  
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
17 • Appropriateness:  Perceived  fit and relevance o f the VIT and EUC 
intervention s from the perspective of represen tative site staff 
• Tobacco Treatment fidelity:  Delivery of all components of the Smokefree 2.0 
Study Treatment Interventi ons (EUC and VIT).  
• Cost:  Incremental cost per quit o f the VIT interventi on relat ive to the EUC 
control over the 6 -month follow -up period  
• Feasibility:  Ease of delivery and suitability for routine care of the VIT and 
EUC intervention s 
• Penetration/Reach:  Patient participation rate at each site, reasons for study 
ineligibility and refusal , comparison of sociodemographic and cancer variable 
characteristics of enrollees and refusers of the study  
• Sustainability:  Resources needed and preference for a site -based cen tralized 
tobacco treatment program  
Using existing staff data collection  survey and interview tools as well as synthesis 
of notes from m inutes of monthly meetings with CCDR Leads and study 
investigators, we will enhance our understanding of the implementation process 
(Aim 3) by: 1) examining organizational characteristics that  influence adoption of 
tobacco treatment interventions; and 2) i dentifying and developi[INVESTIGATOR_910398]. This exploratory research will add to the limited knowledge ab out 
contextual factors influencing the engagement of community o ncology sites in the 
adoption of tobacco use assessment and treatmen t; and inform how best to 
engage community oncology practices in the integration of smoking cessation in 
cancer care.

18 3. Participant Selection  
3.1 Selection of NCORP Si te Staff Participants  
In order to achieve Aim 3, we will enroll a subset of staff (n=approximately 110) 
from a minimum of 11 participating NCORP sites. We are seeking to elicit  
implementation process perspectives fro m key stakeh olders (clinicians and 
resea rch administration staff ) who would most likely be instrumental in making 
tobacco use assessment and treatment routine part of cancer care. Guided by 
[CONTACT_5657]/her knowledge of key s takeholders’ roles and responsibilities,  the Cancer 
Care Delivery Research (CCDR ) Leader and site PI [INVESTIGATOR_39736] m each participating site 
will be responsible for identifying approximately 10 multidisciplinary staff 
members to complete brief (approximately 15 minut e) surveys and participate in 
focus grou p interviews  (approximately 45 -60 minute s). The focus group inte rview 
will be conducted approximately [ADDRESS_1278359] three months, and able to 
provide informed consent to participate in this study (see Informed Consent for 
NCORP Staff). The CCDR Lead and Site PI [INVESTIGATOR_910399] e other staff p articipants. The CCDR Lead w ill update the 
REDCap  Roster survey with the dates of consent for each participant. The 
consent date entered into the MSK REDCap Roster survey will be used as the 
source docume ntation by [CONTACT_910451]. Given the minim al risk, minimal burden and broad 
relevance of this research to CCDR priorities for enhancing high quality cancer 
care, we do not anticipate any difficulty  recruiting staff participants. In th e event 
that th ere is staff turnover, the C CDR Leader will be re sponsible for identifying 
one or more replacement staff participants who will provide [ADDRESS_1278360] aff represent key site stake holders and that the 
quantitative (baseline, 12 and 36-month follow -up surveys) and qualitative data

4.7.5  ECOG -ACRIN Systems for Ea sy Entry of Patient Reported Outcomes 
(EASEE -PRO) System  
We will use a combination of EASEE -PRO and mailed questionnaires 
for this study. A proxy or family member can complete the 
questionnaires on behalf of the patient as lo ng as they can speak 
English or Spanish. The questionnaires are only available in English 
or Spanish.  
Access to the study in EASEE -PRO is granted to all participants 
registered to the study through the OPEN registration system with a 
valid participant email address. Upon registration, an account 
verification email will be sent to the user with a link to ac tivate their 
account. The user will be required to enter some verification 
information (e.g. DOB) in order to activate their EASEE -PRO account. 
Additionally, site persons with the appropriate roles i n RSS will be 
granted access a fter IRB approval is obtain ed. In some studies, this 
access may allow CRAs to assist the participant accessing baseline 
surveys, educational materials, or other EASEE -PRO materials.  
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
29 EASEE -PRO Participant Access:  
To access EASE E-PRO, the participant must have an active EASEE -
PRO user  account. Upon registration to the study in OPEN, an 
account activation email will be sent to the address entered for the 
participant in OPEN eligibility checklist. This email address must be a 
valid email address for the participant. All participants in t he 
EAQ171 CD Study are required to have access to the internet and a 
valid email address to participate. (If the patient email address were 
entered incorrectly in OPEN, the CRA must contact [CONTACT_910458] ( pro-
[EMAIL_1058]  to manually correct the error.) To activate their 
account, users must click the link in the email and verify their account 
before they can login and complete surveys  or view web education 
materials. Once the account is act ivated, participants may login to the 
EASEE -PRO system through the OEAU -PRIDE web portal 
(https://pride.stat.brown.edu/Participant -Login ). Upon login, users will 
be presented with a list of ava ilable surveys and materials they can 
view.  
EASEE -PRO CRA Access:  
To access EASEE -PRO, the site user must have an active CTEP IAM 
account ( https://eapps -ctep.nci.nih.gov/iam ). In addition, site users 
that are a member of ECOG -ACRI N must have the mapped ECO G-
ACRIN roles or explicit Rave roles (Rave CRA) in RSS at the enrolling 
site. Site users that are not members of ECOG -ACRIN must have the 
Rave roles on the CTSU roster at the enrolling sites. The Site 
Admi nistrator or Data Adminis trator at the enrolling si te may assign 
the appropriate roles from the Site Roles tab on the CTSU website. To 
login, CRAs will use their CTSU(IAM) credentials on the OEAU -
PRIDE web portal ( https://pride.stat.brown.edu/CRA -Login ) using the 
familiar IAM inte rface.  No e -learnings are  required for use of this site.  
The ECOG -ACRIN Outcomes and Economics Assessment Unit can 
be contact[CONTACT_910459] l at 
[EMAIL_17370] . An EASEE -PRO instructional guide for 
both sites an d patients can be found on  both the E -A and CTSU 
websites.  
Please see below for additional details on the EASEE -PRO system.  
1. A sec ure environment for control of user records, information, and 
transactions (SECURIT): Provides a secure – limited access poi nt 
for entering data into the  restricted secure PII Database, for 
management of user data, creating user accounts, and reporting. 
The SECURIT web management interface requires the secure 
hypertext transfer protocol (HTTPS) to ensure encryption of 
transmitt ed data.  
a) PII database: is a dedicated secure limited access database, 
used to store protected PII.  
i) Secure: All communications to the PII database through 
SECURIT are encrypted. The database resides behind a 
firewall and cannot be reach from outside t he OEAU.  
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
30 ii) Limited access: this database is restricted not only by 
[CONTACT_910460], so that only 
authorized users logging in at the OEAU from pre -specified 
computers may acce ss/enter PII.  At no time is outside 
access allowed to this database.  
iii) Protected restricted PII (e.g. SSN) are encrypted at the 
time of data entry and double data entered for verification. 
All users regardless of their security level are blinded to 
this protected data, and it cann ot be decrypted without the 
encryption key, housed in a safe, in a location separate 
from the OEAU. Thi s type of data is generally collected for 
long term follow -up where it may be needed to be 
decrypted for select patients in order to search registries 
like the national death index to determine survival status of 
lost participants. In these instances, with  appropriate 
approvals, the Database Administrator will decrypt this 
data in accordance with the approved retrieval 
specific ation.  
b) User records: This functionality allows OEAU personnel, using 
specific computers within the OEAU, to create user records, 
enter user information into the PII database, and establish 
user web accounts in the separate user database. Allows the 
mana gement of users and their dat a, including the ability to 
update a participant’s preferred contact [INVESTIGATOR_12183], address, and 
participation  status ( e.g., no longer wishes to be contact[CONTACT_910461]).  
c) Information: This functio nality allows the OEAU to rec ord all 
participant contact, document any changes to the participant, 
and make any important notes rel ated to the participant. Note 
that a paper based patient contact [CONTACT_910462]. Site staff will  need to fax the patient cont act 
forms to the OEAU office. See section 11.2.  
d) Transactions: SECURIT provides a reporting and moni toring 
interface to the PRO database, which is used to store non -PII 
patient reported survey responses.  
i) Allows OEAU to mon itor per patient form complet ion status 
using the tracking management facility. This facility reports 
on what data is currently exp ected from participants, 
CRAs, and the OEAU interviewers.  
ii) Aggregate reporting: this series of reports allows the 
OEAU to monitor the distribution of p atients over data 
completion methods and form completion methods (both 
overall and by [CONTACT_3725]).  
2. Database utility and control environment (PRO -DUCE): This 
utility interfaces with the main clinical database containing 
CRF/trigger  data (Medidata RAVE), monitors the clinical 
database for events (eg., participant registrations, scheduled 
procedures, and other trig gers) and establishes event 
scheduling. The system sets up e -mail reminders to CRAs, 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
31 participants [and SMS text message re minders, when 
applicable to the study], and OEAU personnel to ensure timely 
completion of surveys.  
3. Web entry systems (PROWESs): a Web site where 
participants complete online surveys  
a) PROWESs provides a front facing web portal for 
participants to complete questionnaires and have those 
results stored in the PRO database.  
b) Secure site using HTTPS an d requiring a username [CONTACT_910516]. 
c) On login, user is presented with brief instructions; including 
approx. time for completion, number of questions to be 
completed in this session, a ny important information 
regarding this survey (including help a nd contact 
[CONTACT_3031])  
d) PROWESs is a one -way interface,  data cannot be returned 
from the PRO -DB to the user.  
4. Valet Interface and data entry system (PROVIDES).  
a) The PROVIDES system is a we b interface that allows site 
CRAs to act as a valet and enter  a participant’s responses 
to a survey in to the PRO database should the survey be 
completed on paper. This allows Site CRAs to enter forms 
completed by [CONTACT_56132].  
b) Secure site using H TTPS and requiring a username [CONTACT_910517].  
c) Which fo rms can be entered is restricted by [CONTACT_910463], site 
affiliation, and role, thus Sites RAs can only enter surveys 
predesignated as on -site data collection surveys and only 
for their own patients.  
d) On login, user is presented with brief instructions; is 
requested to select the protocol, case numbe r, timepoint 
and verify the case Id by [CONTACT_910464].  
e) PROVIDES is a one -way interface, data cannot be 
returned from the PRO -DB to  the user.  
4.7.6  REDCap System to be used for Site Staff Surveys  
The site staff roster and survey data colle cted for this study will be 
managed through REDCap (Research Ele ctronic Data Capture). 
REDCap is a free, secure, web -based application designed to support  
data collection and storage for research studies. REDCap is fully 
compliant with HIPPA regulations. R EDCap is a tool for the creation of 
customized, secure data mana gement systems including web -based 
data entry forms, reporting tools, and a full array of security features 
including user and group based privileges with a full audit trail of data 
manipulati on and export procedures. More specifically, REDCap will 
be used  to distribute and collect the  roster,  baseline, 12 -month follow -
up, and 36-month foll ow-up NCORP site staff surveys.  For this study, 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
32 the REDCap data management software system will be support ed by 
[CONTACT_250465] (MSKCC). REDCap is 
maintained on MSKCC -owned servers that are kept in a locked server 
room with appropriate e nvironmental modifications (e.g. proper 
ventilation, power redundancy and fault tolerance arrangement)  and 
backed up nightly with some back -up tapes stored off -site. The 
MSKCC Information Systems group is responsible for applying all 
operating system patch es and security updates to the REDCap 
servers. All connections to REDCap utilize encrypted (SSL -based)  
connections. Nationally, the REDCap software is developed, 
enha nced, and supported through a multi -institutional consortium led 
by [CONTACT_50222] . 
4.7.7  Qualitative  Data  
Focus Groups: This data will be stored using qualitative database 
software (NVivo) located on the MSKCC secure file network.  
Patient Exit Interviews: This data will be stored using qualitative 
database software (NVivo) located on the MGH secure file networ k. 
4.8 Instructions for Patients who Do Not Complete Baseline Survey and/or Do Not 
Start Assigned Study Inte rvention  
If a patient is registered to Step [ADDRESS_1278377] ete the baseline survey

33 5. Methodology  
5.1 Recruitment and Accrual  
Participants will be recrui ted from NCORP Community and Minority/Underserved 
sites.  
Screening may occur in accordance  with local site policies and procedures. 
NCORP site staff may determine the foll owing criteria by [CONTACT_910465]/schedules, medical record reviews, or b y approaching patients in clinic or via 
phone. Sites will provide weekly number totals (vi a a distributed REDCap survey) 
of smokers seen at this subcomponent site, patient s ineligible (and rea son), 
smokers approached to participate, and patients refused (a nd reason).  
For potentially eligible  patients, the site staff will also verbally confirm  the 
following additional criteria  (as it is less readily -discernable from chart re view) , 
via phone or i n clinic (in accordance with local site policies and procedures) : 
• ECOG performance status (ineligible if 3 or above; eligible if 2 or below or no 
ECOG lis ted) 
• Cancer diagnosis (type; i.e., lung) and date (subject step [ADDRESS_1278378] 
be within 124 days  of diagnosis date)  
• Age (must be 18 years or older)  
• Language (must be English or  Spanish speaking)  
• Confirm they have s moked, even a puff, of a cigarette i n the last 30 days  
• Confirm they intend to receive  their cancer care or monitoring  at NCORP site 
(not a  one-time consult or second -opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649])  
• Conf irm they have telephone, e -mail access, and have access to the internet 
with a camera -enabled device (e.g., sma rtphone, tablet, computer, laptop 
with a webcam/camera).  
The recommended process i s as follows: Site s taff to review new patient list or 
schedules, particularly the electronic medical records (EMR) of patients with 
upcoming visits to identify all patients who are identified as current smokers. This 
list can either be created using an au tomated report with information obtained 
from the relevant EMR fields (e.g., tobacco use) or manually by [CONTACT_6624]. It is 
recommended that this list  of potentially eligible patients be generated at least on 
a weekly basis. If information on the smoking st atus of patients is either missing 
or unknown, site staff should ask the patient about their current smoking status 
and update their record. The tota l count of current smoker s onsite should be 
documented in the MSK REDCap Survey.  
EMRs of current smokers sh ould be reviewed for  patients who are adult (≥ 18 
years) and newly dia gnosed (within past 4 months). Site staff should then 
approach these patients t o confirm smoking status,  receipt of care at the NCORP 
site, and email/web access, as well as any above -listed criteria that we re unable 
to be discerned from chart review.  
Only patients who are still eligible after this initial chart review step should be 
approached about the stud y. For patients who are deemed ineligible, or whom 
refuse to be fully screened upo n approach, during t his screening process, site 
staff will document reasons in the MSK REDCap Survey (see Section 5.1.1 ). Rev. Add2

video about the study . Verbal permission may occur per sites usual pr actice (via 
telephone or in clinic). For patients who refuse, reasons  for refusal  will be 
documented and tr acked in the  study s pecific  enrollment log. Patients who agree 
to be contact[CONTACT_910466] (Screening Step 0). 
Patient  contact [CONTACT_910467] (criteria collected 
above) will be entered  into OPEN.  Once a Patient’s infor mation is in OPEN, the 
virtual clinician referral (informational video) will be sent to the email address 
provided by [CONTACT_910468]. It is highly recommended that site staff have an 
interested and eligible participant view the video at the time of visit and th en also 
obtain written consent (OPEN Step 1).  
Participants may choose to wait to sign consent, but give verbal consent to view 
the outreach recruitment vi deo. Site staff will then follow -up with all patients who 
received a virtual clini cian referral to ass ess their interest in participating in the 
study. Additionally, EASEE -PRO will prompt site staff when a patient has 
watched the v irtual clinician referral  video, to help facilitate recruitment efforts. 
Follow -up attempts may occur at up coming clinic visits  or via phone. It is 
recommended site staff make at least 3 outreach attempts (e.g., approaches in 
clinic, or voicemails), unless  a refusal or enrollment decision is received first. For 
those who refuse or are ineligible for the study, reasons will be docu mented in 
RAVE and ongoing secure data transfers will be sent to MGH. Otherwise, 
interested, eligible patients will be given an i nformed consent form to r eview and 
sign, and will be consented to the study by [CONTACT_910469].  
Once a  patient has signed written consent, they will be registered to OPEN Step 
[ADDRESS_1278380] 
information, study ID, dat es of consent and randomi zation, provider information, 
and randomization arm assignment to MGH centralized study staff via the site’s 
Enrollment Log REDCap project . MGH site staff will then email participants’ 
provider an email notification of enrollment i n the study.  
5.1.1  Screening P rocedure and Log  
All smokers on new patient lists or schedules should be screened.  
Inclusion criteria are: 
• Age >18  
• Diagnosed within the past 124 days (Note: patient must  still be in 
the 124 day window at step 0 registration.)  
• Primary language English or Sp anish  
• ECOG performance score < [ADDRESS_1278381]:  
• have smoked a cigarette in the past 30 days,  
• plan to receive care at the site, and

35 laptop wi th a webcam/camera).  Sites will provid e the cumulative 
total number of smokers seen at their site, the number of smokers 
approached, number of patients who  are ineligible and refuse, and 
reasons for ineligibility and refusal . These totals will be provided to 
the MSK coordinating center via a R EDCap survey.  
Eligible  patients are asked for consent to be contact[CONTACT_653900]. Those consenting are entered i n OPEN and their OPEN ID is 
recorded. If the patient refuses to be co ntacted, the reason for refusal 
is record ed. 
For patients who are eligible and provide written consent (OPEN Ste p 
1), the site staff will enter  sociodemographic, clinical, and contact [CONTACT_64197] a 
into their site specific REDCap  Project Enrollment Log.  
The data wi ll be securely exported from RED Cap and a ssessed for 
completeness at the DCC on an ongoing basis.  Complete screens will 
be stored in the study database at the  DCC.  DCC staff will provide 
feedback to the site contact [CONTACT_910470] v ia 
passwo rd-protected emails. The timing and frequ ency of the data 
exports will be coordinated between the site and DCC staff.  
5.1.2  Accrual Target  
Sites participating in this trial should anticipate an  accrual goal (i.e., 
patients who complete the baseline survey) of [ADDRESS_1278382] and upload the video to the online stu dy account. Final 
approval of th e brief video will be conducted by [CONTACT_6283]. Park, Ostroff, and 
Wagner. The approved video will be uploaded to the site’s study 
account. The video will then be sent to the patient via the site’s patient 
portal.  
5.2 Enhanced Usual Car e (EUC) (Arm A)  
The EUC reflects  the NCCN  Smoking Cessation Guideline recommendations2 
and mirrors what is often delivered at cancer centers and community settings: 
assessment of smoking status, provision of quitting advice, and referral to the 
national NC I Smokers’ Q uitline for free cou nseling . Some participating NCORP 
community sites might provide additional tobacco treatment, which we will 
assess and document as well.  
All participants r andomized to EUC will have received the assessment of 
smoking status and provision of quitting advice  through the screening and 
recruitment ( virtual clinician referral ) process, and will additionally be referred to 
the NCI Smoking Quitline (smokefree.gov).  Referrals will be sent via email by 
[CONTACT_910471] t o the EUC arm see Rev. Add2  
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD

36 supplementa l Appendix P). Referrals will also be sent via mailed letter (see EUC 
Referral Letter Supplemental Appendix Z1A) by [CONTACT_910472].  
On an ongoing basis, the NCI Quitl ine will provide reports on part icipant 
engagement (date and duration of Quitline call) with quitline services. This 
interaction will be documented in Rave.  
5.3 Virtual Intervention Treatment  (VIT) (Arm B)  
The VIT group will be offered  up to 11 counseling sess ions over  approximately  6 
months  (approxi mate schedule: 4 weekly sessions through week 4; 4 biweekly 
sessions through week 12; and 3 monthly sessions through week 24) and up to 
12 weeks o f free FDA -approved combination NRT (patch and lozenge combined, 
or may elect to receive either optio n alone) . 
VIT participants will receive their 11 counseling sessions via MGH TeleHealth, 
which connects providers to patients through virtual HIPAA -compli ant 
videoconferencing technology including: phone, video, email, m obile applications 
and remote monit oring. These virtual visits are conducted via a videoconference 
platform that addresses clinical privacy and security (e.g., Zoom, Doximity, or 
other HIPPA -compliant platform). Participants can use this videoconference 
platform on their computer, tablet or  smartphone. The counseling will be 
delivered by a study -designated tobacco treatment coach based at MGH. Since 
the counseling takes place virtually, parti cipants will be emailed handouts that 
are traditionally provided a s hardcopi[INVESTIGATOR_910402]. These hando uts, distributed at 
the end of Session 1, include a pi[INVESTIGATOR_69642], 11 Reasons for Cancer Patients to Quit 
Smoking, and Health Benefits When You Quit Smoking.  
5.3.1  Terminology  
Counseling structure and content: The initial session wil l last 
approximately 40 minutes;  follow -up sessions will last approximately 
15 minutes.  
All counseling sessions will be structured in a 5 As, patient -centered

During the initial session, the tobacco counselor:  
1. introduces the study and provides an overview of the goals and 
structur e of the program;  
2. gathers a comprehensive smoking history;  
3. asse sses participants’ concerns abou t smoking;  
4. offers a personalized message to quit smoking;  
5. assess participants’ importance and confidence to quit and pros 
and cons for quitting and c ontinuing to smoke; and  
6. evaluates participants’ readiness to quit.  
The tobacco counselor tailors p articipants’ quit plan based on their 
quit stage, which falls into one of 3 branching logics:  
1. not ready to quit or make changes;  
2. not ready to quit, b ut ready to make changes; and  
3. ready to quit.  
The tobacco counselor  assists the participant in setting a goal for the 
week and schedules a follow -up session for the next week. 
Participants then receive 3 weekly sessions, 4 biweekly sessions, and 
3 monthl y (booster) sessions. The str ucture of each follow -up 
treatment sessi on mirrors the initial weekly se ssions, wherein the

5.3.2  Provision of medication: Ni cotine Replacement Therapy (NRT)  
At the initial counseling session, t he tobacco counselor will discus s 
use of NRT. Using a decision tree (see Appendix VII  and Appendix 
VIII) the tobacco counselor will review contraindications of the patch 
and l ozenge. The lead CRA and oncolog y clinicians will be informed, 
via password protected emails s ent by [CONTACT_910473], that 
over-the-counter nicotine replacement therapy (patch/lozen ge) 
medication was dispensed as a means of collaborative care; this i s 
the standard of care for nicot ine replacement therapy. This method 
was reviewed by [CONTACT_253086] -ACRIN regulatory officer and MGH IRB 
and it was determined that oncology clinician notificati on prior to 
treatment was not needed. The coordinating site staff  will inform the 
NCORP oncology prov ider of the NRT assignment and participants 
will be offered an  initial 4 -week supply of nicotine replacement 
patches and lozenges. Although use of  medicati on will be promoted, it 
is not required for study participation. Medi cation will be administered 
acco rding to the USPHS guidelines16. Two 4 -week refills will be 
discussed with the patient and dispensed accordingly. Side effects will 
be monitored and discus sed weekly with the MPIs. Treating clinicians 
will be contact[CONTACT_5365] N RT-related questions/concerns. T he tobacco 
counselor will adjust the NRT dose to control withd rawal symptoms 
and minimize adverse effects. NRT will be  housed at the MGH and  
mailed to part icipants  by [CONTACT_612986] . NRT has been safely 
distributed through quit lines in this way. 85, 127 NRT kits will include 
instruction and patient information shee ts in English and Spanish 
written for a 6th grade reading level. Use of NRT will be supported  
during each session.  
5.4 Patient Assessments (Arms A & B)  
Patients assig ned to both arms will complete s urveys in the EASEE -PRO system 
at the following time points:  
• Baseline (Supplemental Appendix A)  
• 3 months (Supplemental Appendix B)  
• 6 months (Supplemental A ppendix C)  
The baseline survey (Supplemental Appendix A) should take  approximately 20 
minutes to com plete. The 3 month (Supplemental Appendix B) and 6 month 
(Supp lemental Appendix C) survey should each take approximately [ADDRESS_1278383] w ith data collection over the telephone. If the

39 5.5 Adverse Event Report ing Requirements  
All adverse event grades described throughout  this protocol and all 
reportable adverse events will be graded using the NCI Common 
Terminol ogy Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.  
All appropriate treatment areas should have acce ss to a copy of the CTCAE 
version 5.0. A copy of the CTCAE ver sion 5.0 can be downloaded from the 
CTEP website ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ). 
5.5.1  Purpose  
Adverse event (AE) data collection and reporting, which are a 
required part of every clinical trial, are done so investigators and 
regulatory agencies can detect and analyze adverse events and risk 
situations to ensure the saf ety of the patients enrolled, as well as 
those who will enroll in fut ure studies using similar agents .  
5.5.2  Terminology  
• Adverse Event (AE):  Any untoward medical occurr ence 
asso ciated with the use of an agent  in humans [(in this protocol 
Nicotine Replacement Th erapy (NRT)], whether or not considered 
agent  related. Therefore, an AE can be ANY  unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symp tom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product, whether or not con sidered related to the 
medicinal product.  
• Attribution:  An assessment of the relationship between the 
adverse event and the protocol agent (NRT), using the followin g 
categories.  
ATTRIBUTION  DESCRIPTION  
Unrelated  The AE is clearly NOT  related  to the Nicotin e 
Replacement Therapy (NRT)  
Unlikely  The AE is doubtfully related  to the Nicotine 
Replacement Therap y (NRT)  
Possible  The AE may be related  to the Nicotine 
Replac ement Therapy (NRT)  
Probable  The AE is likely related  to the Nicotine 
Replacement Therapy (N RT). 
Definite  The AE is clearly related  to the Nicotine 
Replacement Therapy (NRT)  
• CTCAE:  The NCI Co mmon Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events provides a descri ptive terminology that is to be utilized for 
AE reporting. A grade (severity) is provided for  each AE term.  
• Expectedness:  Expected events are those that have been  
previously identified as result ing from administration of the agent 
(NRT). An adverse event i s considered unexpected, for expedited 
reporting purposes, when either the type of event or t he severity of 
the event is NOT listed in  the protocol (please refer to Section 8) 
or drug package insert.  Rev. Add2

6.2.3  Exploratory objectives – implementation outcome s: We will assess 
patient satisfaction with the proposed virtual treatment delivery 
modality and intervention content. Patient feedback will be taken into 
consideration in further refining  of intervention protocols, and is 
important for gathering key infor mation on intervention delivery and 
potential for implementation in real -world situations.

assessed using a mixture of multiple -choice 
question items: (1) To what extent has the 
tobacco t reatment program met your 
needs? (2) Did you get the kind of smoking  
cessation assistance that you wanted; (3) 
How helpful was the smoking cessation 
assistance?;  (4) How would you rate the 
quality of the assistance you recei ved? (5)

6.2.4  Patient Remuneration  
Patient par ticipants will receive $20 in gift cards for each survey 
completed (baseline, 3  months, and 6  months; 3 total possible). 
Subjects who complete a bi ospecimen sample (saliva or CO b reath 
test) will receive $40 in gift cards for each sample completed (3mo., 
and 6mo; 2 total possible). Subjects who are randomly selected for an 
exit interview will be p rovided $20 in gift cards for participation (1 
possibl e). Therefore, subjects have the  opportunity to receive up to 
$160 in remuneration.  (See Supplemental Appendi ces G -M for Patient 
Remuneration Letters). The central coordinating site (i.e., MGH) will 
be responsible for managing the disbursement of gift card s directly to 
participants.  
6.3 NCOR P Site Staff Assessments  
At the practice (organizational) level, little is kn own about the acceptability of 
integrating tobacco treatment delivery into routine oncology c are. In this trial, 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
50 implementation outcomes will be as sessed with mixed methods using qualitative 
(focus group interviews) and quantitative (surveys) data to be co llected from a 
subset of Site PI, CCDR Leader, and other oncology clinicians and research 
administrative staff from each participating NCORP site ( See Section 3.1). As 
shown in the NCORP Site Staff Schema (p 7), surveys will be collected at 
baseline (pre -patient participant enrollment, and then again at approximately 12 
and 36 months following baseline).  
The NCORP Site Staff assessments will be manage d by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Ostroff and her 
study designated research assistant. The baseline, 1 2 and 36 month follow -up 
surveys will be collected using REDCap, (Research Electronic Data Ca pture), a 
data management software syst em supported by [CONTACT_910478] (MSKCC) Information Systems group . 
Staff Survey of Site Character istics, Organizational Readiness and 
Perceived Tobacco Treatment Feasibility, Acceptability a nd 
Appropriateness:  
As described in Sec tion 3.1, the CCDR Leader and site PI [INVESTIGATOR_910411] i dentify a subset of approximately 10 clinicians 
(nurses, oncologists) and administrative staf f (site coordinators, support staff)] t o 
provide data about the implementation of toba cco use assessment and 
treatment. Data collec tion will include qualitative ( focus group interviews) and 
quantita tive (survey) research methods.  The baseline site staff su rveys will be 
administered prior to the  first site patient enrollment. Post surveys will be 
cond ucted approximately [ADDRESS_1278399] the baseline survey. The group 
interview will be conducted at the 36 -month follow -up as well. (See Supplemental 
Appendices D: Baseline Site Staff Survey, E: 12-month Site Staff Survey, F: 36 -
month Site Staff Survey ). 
The content of the mixed methods data collection will focus on several 
impleme ntation outcomes including Appropriateness, Feasibility, Acceptability, 
and Sustainability. T he focus group interviews  will last for approximately 45 -60 
minutes, and the surveys w ill require approximately 15 minutes for completion. 
Site staff participants will be remunerated $[ADDRESS_1278400] -trial surveys ($20 per survey ) and focus group 
interview ($40) . 
6.3.1  NCORP Site Characteristics : 
At the time of site registration, the CCDR Lead or their designee(s) 
will complete the site rostering survey. This survey requests that 
applicable CTEP IDs be grouped into larger practice group s with 
shared providers, populations served an d services offe red. For each 
practice group, the CCDR Lead or their designee(s) will complete 
items regarding practice characteristics including safety net 
designation, minority/underserved NCORP status, geogra phic site 
location, practice volume, provider mix and ownersh ip, and tobacco 
cessation services that are available for patients treated at each 
practice group.

51 components of the tobacco  treatment interventions (EUC and VIT) will 
be assessed by [CONTACT_910479] - and post -trial. Perceptions  of 
site organizational readiness will be measured using the 7-item 
Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change (ORIC, Shea et 
al 2014) meas ure assessing two subscales, change commitment and 
change efficacy, on a 5 -point ordinal scal e ranging from ‘Ag ree’ to 
‘Disagree’. A total organizational readiness score, a nd subscale 
change commitment and change efficacy score are created.  144,145  
6.3.3  Perceiv ed Tobacco Treatment Feasibility, Acceptability and 
Appropriateness:  
Staff participants will also rate perceive d feasibility, acceptability and 
appropriateness of the vario us tobacco treatment interventions being 
tested in this trial (Weiner et al, 2017) o n a 6 -point ordinal scale 
ranging from ‘Strongly Disagree’ to ‘Strongly Agree’ Aggregate and 
intervention -speci fic summary scores for tobacco treatment feasibility, 
accepta bility and appropriateness are derived. The NCORP Staff 
Survey will take approximate ly [ADDRESS_1278401] patient is registered, and at approximately 12 and 36 months

6.3.4  Focus Group Interview  
The focus  group interview will assess implementation processes 
including barriers and fa cilitators for sustaining tobacco treatment as 
routine cancer c are practice in the N CORP site.  The question probes 
for our implementation -focused focus group interviews will be guided 
by [CONTACT_251979] 
(CFIR)20 and w ill address the 1) the intervention, 2) inner setting, 3) 
outer settings, 4) individ uals involved, and 5) the process for

The focus group interview will be conducted using videoconference 
software (e .g., Zoom, Doximity, or other HIPPA -compliant platform).  
enabling  audio recording of the focus group interview for subsequent 
coding of primary implementation themes. The focus gro up interviews 
will be scheduled at the convenience of the NCORP staff parti cipants 
and is expected to take about [ADDRESS_1278402] at the end of the trial (after patient 
participant enrollment is closed and 36-month follow -up surveys

Focus group Interviews will be recorde d, transc ribed and analyzed 
using NVivo qualitative software. Content analyses will be conducted 
by [CONTACT_910480]. Park and Ostroff. The coders 
will meet to develo p the thematic fram ework, categories, and coding 
plan. To ensure coding rel iability, coding discrepancies will be 
resolved through discussion and comparison of raw data. Coding will 
continue until a high level of reliability (Kappa= >0.80) is established.

6.6 Reach and Adoptio n 
Site coordinators will document the percentage of all current smokers who 
participate at  each site. Using a Patient Sc reening Log (Appendix Z2D), we will 
assess the number of eligible patients who were approached and the number of 
eligible patients who e nrolled. Reasons for ineligibility, refusal, and 
characteristics of refusers, ineligibles,  and drop outs will be documen ted. 
Consistent with the hybrid effectiveness implementation trial design, we will 
collect characteristics of ineligibles and refusers t o inform future dissemination 
efforts such that we can evaluate the critical question of w hom we are not 
reaching for to bacco treatment.  
The MGH RA will track uptake and utilization on the sites that are engaged in 
study activities (i.e., participation in monthly calls and patient program 
enrollment).

60 Patient is advised to pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696] "quit day" and begin using nicotine 
transdermal patches on that day and simultaneo usly stop smoking. 
They may continue to smoke if not immediately able to/willing to stop 
smoking, however every effort should be made to decrease the 
amount smoked while on replacement therapy, as continued smokin g 
can increase adverse effects.  It is impor tant for patients to  complete 
the full program, but some may need to use NRT for longe r periods to 
keep from smoking.  
Apply to clean, dry, non -hairy area of skin (typi[INVESTIGATOR_910413]), bein g sure to rotate sight placed. Do not use the same 
sight for two consecutiv e applications. Try to not repeat any sight 
more than once in a [ADDRESS_1278415] out of the re ach of children and 
pets. The patch still contains small amounts of nicotine which are 
poisonous children and pets . 
8.1.5  Availability/How Supplied  
Nicotine transdermal patches are FDA approved for smoking 
cessation aid and are commercially available.  
8.1.6  Side Effec ts 
There are no sign ificant safety concerns associated with using more 
than 1 over -the-counter (OTC) nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) 
simultaneously or at same time as another nicotine -containing product 
(including cigarettes), however the potential for nicotine overdose is  
increased if patient continues to smoke.  Every effort should be made 
to decrease the number of cigarettes smoked to zero while using 
replacement therapy.  
Below are the most commonly reported adverse events related to 
nicotine transderm al patch. Please ref er to the package 
insert/investigator’s brochure for the comprehensive list of adverse 
events.  
Gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, 
diarrhea), headache, insomnia, vivid dreams, and applicat ion site 
irritation.  
Contact [CONTACT_910488].  
The incidence of developi[INVESTIGATOR_910414] t is 
considered to be very low.  Smokers may worry that they will become 
dependent on nicotine replacement , but nicotine depen dence rarely 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Da te: July 1, 2021  
61 occurs. Nicotine replacement therapy has not been shown to increase 
or cause development of cancer.  
Use of nicotine transdermal patches may not be appropriate in the 
following populations and should be carefully monitored b y a 
physician  
• non-smokers, occasional smokers, and children under 18 years of 
age (see Warnings),  
• known hypersensitivity of the skin, allergy to nicotine or any patch 
components,  
• generalized skin disorders,  
• recovery phase of acute myocardial infarction, un stable or 
worsening angina pectoris, severe cardiac arrhythmias, and 
recent cerebrovascular accident.  
Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:  
Transdermal nicotine is considered US FDA Category D. The adverse 
effects on fetal and maternal health caused by [CONTACT_910489]. Nicotine freely passes into the placenta and is 
found in both amniotic fluid and umbilical cord blood (Luck & Nau, 
1984; Hibberd et al, 1978). Nicotine is readily transferred to the fetus 
throughout pregnancy; the fetus is ac tually exposed to hi gher nicotine 
concentrations than the mother (Luck et al, 1985). The use of 
cigarettes or nicotine gum during the third trimester of pregnancy has 
been associated with diminished breathing movement in the fetus. 
There are no conclusive data to support diff erent pregnancy 
categories for the various nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) 
products (Lyman & Raebel, 2001).  
If you are pregnant or breast -feeding, only use this medicine on the 
advice of your health care provider. Smoking can serious ly harm your 
child. Try to stop smoking without using any nicotine replacement 
medicine. This medicine is believed to be safer than smoking. 
However, the risks to your child from this medicine are not fully 
known."  
8.1.7  Potential Interactions  
There is increased  risk of nicotine ov erdose in patients who continue 
smoking while using a nicotine replacement therapy, or those utilizing 
more than one form of  nicotine replacement therapy. Caution should 
be used to prevent overdose, and smoking should be completely 
discontinued while using  therapy.  
Signs and symptoms of nicotine overdose may include:  
abdominal or stomach pain, cold sweat, confusion, convulsions 
(seizures), disturbed hearing and vision, drooling, extreme 
exhaustion, pale skin, rapid heartbeat, an d tremors . Contact [CONTACT_910490] r if you experience any of these symptoms .

Absorbed systemically; binds to nicotine receptors th ereby [CONTACT_910491] (including nicotine craving) associated with 
smoking cessation. Nicotine lozenges deliver nicotine at a lower and 
steadier rate compared to smoking cigarettes through the oral mucosa 
as opposed to the skin or gastrointest inal tract.  
Excretio n: Urine  
8.2.3  Storage and Stability

Cancer Research Group  Version Da te: July 1, [ADDRESS_1278421] cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up:  
• Use one [ADDRESS_1278422] cigarette > 30 minutes after waking up:  
• Use one 2 -mg lozenge every 1 to 2 hours for weeks 1 to 6, 
followed by [CONTACT_31806] 2 -mg lozenge every 2 to 4 hours for weeks 7 to 9, 
then one 2 -mg lozenge every 4 to 8 h ours for weeks 10 to  12. 
Patient is advised to pi[INVESTIGATOR_9696] "quit day" and begin using nicotine polacrilex 
lozenge on that day an d simultaneously stop smoking. They may 
continue to smoke if not immediately able to/willing to stop smoking, 
however every effort shou ld be made to decrea se the amount smoked 
while on replacement therapy, as continued smoking  can increase 
adverse effects. It is important for patients to complete the full 
program, but some may need to use NRT for longer periods to keep 
from smoking.  
Place  the lozenge in your  mouth and allow the lozenge to slowly 
dissolve (20 - 30 minutes). Avoid chewing or swallowing the lozenge. 
Patients should also avoid eating or drinking [ADDRESS_1278423] 6 wee ks 
Avoid using more than one lozenge at a time or continuously use one 
lozenge after another since this may cause hiccups, heartburn, 
nausea or other side effects. Do not use more than 5 lozenges in 6 
hours or 20 lozenges per day.  
8.2.5  Avail ability/How Supplied  
Nicotine polacrilex lozenges are FDA approved for smoking cessation 
aid and are commercially available.  
Product is supplied as a 2 mg or 4 mg oral lozenge or troche.  
8.2.6  Side Effects  
There are no significant safety concerns associated with  using more 
than 1 o ver-the-counter (OTC) nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) 
simultaneously or at same time as another nicotine -containing product 
(including cigarettes), however the potential for nicotine overdose is 
increased if patient continues to smok e. Every effort shou ld be made 
to decrease the number of cigarettes smoked to zero while using 
replacement therapy.

Cancer Research Group  Version Da te: July 1, 2021  
68 9.6 Plans for analyzing the primary objectives: treatment effectiveness (Aim 1)  
The primar y objective is to compare the proportions of participants in the study 
arms with [ADDRESS_1278437] 
enrollment. We will define 7 -day point -prevalence by [CONTACT_249899] (< 15 ng/ml) 
or expi[INVESTIGATOR_393524] (<10 ppm ). All participants who report being quit and no NRT or 
e-cigarette use will be reque sted to provide saliva samples, expi[INVESTIGATOR_910417] e -
cigarette use . If a participant is los t to follow -up or does not provide a saliva or 
CO sample, they will be considered a c urrent smoker. The primary analysis will 
be performed from an intent -to-treat perspective. Chi -square tests will be used to 
compare the outcomes between treatment groups. Outcomes will be considered 
different with p<0.01 . 
As a randomized study, it is hoped  that the two groups will be balanced between 
potential confounders. Appropriate comparisons between the groups will be 
performed (chi -squared tests, t -tests, etc.) to ide ntify any potential confo unders 
that were not balanced. If significant areas of imbal ance are identified, logistic 
regression modelling will be performed to adjust for potential confounding.  
9.7 Plans for analyzing the secondary objectives: secondary treatment  effectiveness 
(Aim 1)  
The 5 secondary  objectives (defined in Section 2.3) include various  ways of 
measuring abstinence at different times of assessment.  In order to adjust for 
multiple comparisons, differences will be considered significant at 
0.01/N=0.01/5=0.[ADDRESS_1278438] enrollment. We will define  7-day point -prevalence by [CONTACT_249899] 
(< 15 ng/ml) or expi[INVESTIGATOR_393524] (<  10 ppm).  All participants who report being quit 
and no NRT or e -cigarette use will be requested to provide saliva samples, 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_910418] e -cigarette use. If a participant is lost to follow -up or does not 
provide a saliva or CO sample, they will b e considered a current smoker.  Chi-
square tests will be used to compare the outcomes between treatment g roups.  
Another secondary objective is to compare the proportions of participants in t he 
study arms that self -report cig arette abstinence at 3 -months. The participant will 
be asked, “In the past [ADDRESS_1278439] you smoked a cigarette, even a puff.” With 
the an swer recorded as “Yes” or “No”. If the self -report response is unavailable, 
the parti cipant will b e considered a current smoker. Chi-square tests will be used 
to compare the outcom es between treatment groups. The process will be 
repeated using self -reporte d cigarette abstinence at 6 -months.  
Another secondary objective is to compare the pro portions of participants in the 
study arms that report a continuous abstinence at 6 months. The participants will 
be asked, “ How long has it been since  you last smoked a c igarette (even one or 
two puffs)?”  at 6 months.  If the response is more than  or equal  to 3 months  (e.g. 
time since previous survey) , the participant will be considered having a 
continuous abstinence at 6 months.  If the self -report response is unavailable, the 
participant will be considered not having a continuous abstinence at 6 months.  
Chi-square tests will be used to compare the outc omes between treatment 
groups .

Cancer Research Group  Version Da te: July 1, [ADDRESS_1278440] qualify as biochemically -verified 7 -day point 
prevalence cigarette abstinence at 3 and 6 mont hs, using the definition above.  If 
either measure is not available the p articipant will not  be considered sustained 
abstinence at 6 months . Chi-square tests will be used to compare the out comes 
between treatment groups.  
Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) approach will be used to study the 
treatment effect over time, incorp orating 3 & 6 month follow -up data. This will 
take into account the repeated measures  structure of observations within the 
same individuals over time and allow for analysis of incomplete data across time.  
9.8 Plans for analyzing the exploratory objectives:  
9.8.1  Aim 2: To assess the potential effect of known and potential 
moderators on treatment eff ectiveness between the two arms.  
We will export the moderator effects on treatment effectiveness.  
There are 2 outcomes collected at 2 time points  and 2 outcomes at 1 
time point : 
• Biochemically -verified 7 -day point prevalence abstinence at 3 - and 
6-months fo llow-up 
• Self-reported cigarette abstinence at 3 - and 6 -months follow -up 
• Continuous abstinence at 6 months (no self -reported smoking 
since last survey point)  
• Sustained abst inence at 6 months (biochemically -verified 
abstinence at 3 and 6 months)  
The moderato rs of primary interest are:  
• Sociodemographics: Sex, age, marital status, race/ethnicity, 
education level, financial burden , health insurance, internet and 
smartphone acces s and modality  
• Smoking history: Years smoked, daily smoking rate, other 
tobacco/nicot ine use (e.g., cigars, cigarettes), current/past use of 
tobacco treatments, nicotine dependence (2 -item “Heaviness of 
Smoking Index” from the FTND)  
• Cancer variables: Cance r type, cancer stage, treatment, and days 
since diagnosis  
• Site characteristics:  
• Site, geographic location, clinic volume,  
• baseline organizational readiness (9 -item survey for readiness 
to implement NCCN Guidelines for Smoking Cessation using 
Weiner’s Organ izational Readiness for Implementing Change 
(ORIC) survey144,145) 
• site usual care (re corded on the 2017 landscape survey)  
Additional moderators to be explored:  
• Medical history: ECOG Performance Status, alcohol use (3 items 
form the AUDIT -C) 
ECOG -ACRIN  EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Da te: July 1, 2021  
70 • Quality of life /emotions: Emotional distress, copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], anxiety, 
depression  
• Cancer and smoking beliefs : Stigma , quit motivation, self -efficacy 
to quit, importance of quitting, perceived benefits of quitting 
smoking , quit -smoking medication beliefs  
• Physical symptoms: Cravin gs 
• Environmental influences: Level of second -hand smoke exposure, 
perceived social support , perceived provider support  
For each of the 6, we will test the effects of these moderators  listed 
above on the outcomes. We test the effects of these moderators in 
logistic regression models to determine their associ ation with tobacco 
abstinence. Once a parsimonious multivariate model is developed, 
treatment arm will be included to test for the effect of the i ntervention 
on the moderators. Interactions between the tr eatment arm and the 
moderators will assess the relationship between the moderators an d 
the treatment group on the effectiveness outcomes.  
Also, GEE will be used to look at longitudinal models.  
Multiple comparisons will be accounted for by [CONTACT_910496].  
9.8.2  Aim 3: To assess the processes of implementation and dissemination  
(acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, treatment fidelity, cost 
effectiveness, penetration/reach, and sustainability) of our intervention 
at community oncology sites.  
To gain an initial understanding of implementation processes, for Aim 
3 we will foll ow Proctor and colleagues’ recommended taxonomy for 
measurement of implementation outcomes19. Specifically, we will 
measure acceptability (satisfaction with content/delive ry), adoption 
(program uptake), appropriateness (relevance), cost, and treatment 
fidelity/adaptation and penetration (reach) and sustainability. These 
implementation outcomes will be assessed with mixed methods using 
qualitative and quantitative data to be  collected from patient s, tobacco 
treatment counselor s, NCORP oncology PIs and provid er 
clinicians/staff, and EHR documentation . 
We will use descriptive statistics to summarize implementation 
outcomes (Acceptability, Adoption, Appropriateness, Fidelity, Co st, 
Penetration and Sustainability) and conduct treatment group 
comparisons (i.e., Ac ceptability).  
We will explore organizational readiness  and site level engagement 
using existing quantitative and qualitative data respectively.  In order 
to examine the generalizability of the study findings to the full NCORP 
network of cancer care delive ry sites, we will use the most recent 
(2017) existing N CORP Landscape data to conduct preliminary 
analyses comparing participating and nonparticipating sites on 
relevant site characteristics.  Rev. Add 4

reported survey data, counselor process data, and quitline 
data, we will ev aluate study treatment and non -study 
treatment (i.e., site -specific usual care, outside resources) 
utilization. We will dichotomize medication and cou nseling 
use in to low vs. high ( ≥ 8 weeks of NRT;  ≥ 8 sessions) 
levels of treatment utilization.191 Within each group, we will 
use chi -square tests and ANOVAs to explore the 
association between participant characteristics and 
treatment utilization. We will use chi -square  tests to 
compare  the association of treatment utilization ( brief

effectiveness ratio estimates will be further examined in 
sensitivity analyses in which each parameter is varied,

We will compare proportion of smokers who participate at 
each NCORP site using chi -square tests. We will analyze 
data collected from the study sites ’ screening logs 
maintained in REDCa p (see A ppendix Z 2D). This 
procedure is outlined in Section 5.1. We will compare 
patient characteristics between enrollees and refusers  and 
screenees from DCP -001 using univariate analyses (chi -

will be implementation context variables such as NCORP 
site designation, organizational, clinical staff, and 
population characterist ics, and the capacity to provide 
cancer care delivery se rvices. Additional determinants of 
organizational readiness, particularly, change valence, a 
determinant of change commitment211 – how staff 
perceive tobacco treatment interventions and informational 
assessment, a determinant of change efficacy211 – staff 
perceptions of resource availability and situational factors 
favorable to implementing tobacco treatment interventions 
will be explored in multivariable models. Baseline, 12 -and 
36-month ORIC survey s cores will be analyzed for 
longitudinal changes in chang e efficacy and commitment 
over the course of the study period.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Site level engagement  
We will carry our content analysis of monthly meeting 
minutes. Data will be stratified by [CONTACT_910498] (Who); at what point i n 
the project stakeholders are engaged (When); how 
stakeholders engage in the research project e.g., 
consultations, advisors/experts, information, recruiting or 
retaining participants, dissemination efforts (How and how 
much); and the impact stakeholders h ave on the project 
(What). Engagement interactions will be quantified into 
high, moderate and low levels of engagement. We will then 
assess the association between engagement level and 
organizational and cli nical characteristics (i.e., 
organizational, clin ical, patient population, characteristics) 
and capacity to provide cancer care delivery services (i.e., 
smoking cessation and treatment services).  Rev. Add 4

74 Qualitative data from focus groups described in Aim 3 will 
be used to examine the process of engaging commun ity 
oncology sites in community engaged research (CEnR), 
evaluate facilitators and barriers to engagement, and 
identify implementation strategies to facilitate engagement 
and the adoption of tobacco treatment  at the sub affiliate 
level. Guided by [CONTACT_524958]2 0 we will use domains depi[INVESTIGATOR_910419] (inner setting, process, characteristics of 
individuals) and select constructs within the domains20 to 
examine determinants of engagement, select appropriate 
impleme ntation strategies to facilitate engagement, and  to 
understand where those strategies can be employed in the 
implementation process.  
Data will be analyzed using an inductive approach and the 
constant comparative method.212 Using a three -stage 
analytical a pproach,213 we will begin with open coding, 
data immersion and marginal remarks. Axial coding will 
then be used to allow for the identification of relationships 
between codes. Finally, selective coding will be used for 
the integration of all codes into cor e categories/themes. 
We will code for 1) facilit ators and barriers to engagement 
and 2) implementation strategies to facilitate engagement 
and the adoption of tobacco treatment interventions within 
the CFIR domains and constructs. Independent coding 
with c lear documentation of thematic development follo wed 
by [CONTACT_910499] -rater reliability (alpha >.80) among 
coders and iterative data processing will ensure that the 
qualitative results are confirmable. Strategy domains such 
as the action, action targe t, and implementation outcome 
affected will be d escribed.

Patient indiv idual and NC ORP PI/Clinici an/Staff Focus Group Interview Analyses : 
Data analyses will occur coincident to data collection so that we can ascertain if thematic 
satur ation (the point at which no new data are generated) has been achieved for each 
strata (trea tment group,  site). Interv iews will be recorded, transcri bed and analyzed 
using NVivo qualitative software. Content analyses will be conducted by [CONTACT_910508]. Park and Ostroff. The coders will meet to develop the themat ic 
framework, cat egories, and  coding plan. To ensure coding reliability, coding 
discrepancies will be resolved through discussi on and comparison of raw data. Coding 
will continue un til a hi gh level of reliability (Kappa= >0.80) is established. Patient 
individual interview r esults will be analyzed by  [CONTACT_910509]. NCORP site 
participants’ focus group interviews will be analyzed according to appropriateness and

13. Patien t Consent and Peer Judgment  
Current FDA, NCI, state, federal and institutio nal regulations c oncerning in formed 
consent  will be followed  for the main portion of the study.  
13.1 Waivers of Consent  
13.1.1  Screening  
Per 45 CFR 46.117c, a waiver of documentation of consent  for the 
screening of study eligibility and recruitment of smokers is justi fied for 
the foll owing reason s 
• screening el igibility review of medical records by [CONTACT_910510] a potential subject,  
• screening eligibi lity review of medical records cannot practicably 
be done with the waiver due to the number of services 
participating in which the patient s may be eligible. Screening 
eligibility decreases the burden on patients o f introducing a 
research stud y to patients who can easily be identified through 
screening activities as not eligible for a research study,  
• screening eligibility review of medical re cords involves no more 
than minimal risk because the person accessing the i nformation 
has un dergone trai ning in confid entiality of medical records, and 
the records are viewed solely to screen for eligibility criteria and 
only minimal information found in t he screening process will be 
recorded for research purposes.  
ECOG -ACRI N EAQ171CD  
Cancer Research Group  Version Date: July 1, 2021  
83 13.1.2  Waiver of elem ents of informed consent – site staff  
We re quest a waiver of specific elements of consent regarding 
medical treatment, medical risks, and injury to site staff participants. 
This stu dy does not involve medical treatment of site staff, and these 
elements of informed consent would not ap ply to site st aff 
participating in the individual staff surveys and focus group interviews. 
We have therefore removed these sections from the model cons ent 
form. Omission of this information does not constitute greater than 
minimal risk and wou ld not adver sely affect th e site staff participants .

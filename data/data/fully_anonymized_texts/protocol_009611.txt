Planned study period:  
2014 -2018 
Background:   
The LRP Study is being initiated because of the success of both IVUS and NIRS in identifying 
vulnerable patients and vulnerable plaques.  The PROSPECT Study and [ADDRESS_636491] shown that plaques that occupy more than 70% of the area of the external elastic membrane 
(>70% plaque burden) as measured by [CONTACT_494906] a coronary event. 
(Madder et al, JIC Supplement, 2013)   
 
While the IVUS success is based on size of a plaque, the novel NIRS system has shown promis e 
based on analysis of plaque composition.  The distinctive signature [CONTACT_4007] a cholesterol plaque has now 
been found at the site of STEMI culprit lesions (Madder et al, JACC Interventions 2013).  In addition 
patients with increased cholesterol in a non -culprit  artery have been shown to have a 4 -fold multivariate 
increase in the risk of a coronary event over the subsequent year. (Oemrawsingh et al, Journal of the 
American College of Cardiology, in press , 2014).

Objectives:  
The Lipid -rich Plaque Study will be p erformed in patients undergoing IVUS -NIRS imaging (the index 
procedure ) in whom a TVC catheter will be purchased and used for routine clinical indications. The 
study will test the ability of multi -vessel NIRS scanning for LRP in coronary segments without s ignificant 
stenoses as a means to predict new coronary events arising from a new culprit lesion (a non -index 
culprit lesion).  Analyses will be performed at both the patient level (vulnerable patients) and the 
segment level (vulnerable plaques).  
If and when it is determined that vulnerable patients and vulnerable plaques can be detected by [CONTACT_7163] -
vessel NIRS scanning, the study will transition from a detection study to a treatment study.  This will 
require a separate protocol with separate IRB approval.  
Methodology:  
The LRP Study is a multicenter, prospective registry of patients with stable ischemic heart disease or a 
stabilized acute coronary syndrome (ACS) examined with angiography and IVUS -NIRS imaging for one 
or more suspected culprit lesions. After  successful PCI of all angiographically flow -limiting lesions, 
intravascular imaging with the combined IVUS -NIRS  catheter will be performed in all three coronary 
arteries if possible. Successful imaging of at least two vessels and a total of 50 mm of coron ary artery 
is required for enrollment. All enrolled patients with a large LRP as detected by [CONTACT_494907] 2,6,12 and 24 months by [CONTACT_249729] a new coronary event has occurred.  A randomly 
selected half of the patients with a small, or no, LRP will receive an identical follow -up.  The origin of 
any new event will be determined by [CONTACT_6591] -up angiography performed for clinical indications. The 
location of new culprit lesions will be identified and compared to the baseline NIRS findin gs in a central 
angiographic and NIRS -IVUS  core laboratory located at MedStar.  
Estimated number of subjects:  
The goal is to enroll [ADDRESS_636492] 
Study and the NIRS STEMI findings it is not expected that all 9,000 will be required to demonstrate 
successful prediction of coronary events with IVUS -NIRS  imaging.   If and when the goal of prediction 
is reached, the study will transition to a study of systemic and/or regional therapy of vulnerable  patients 
and plaques.  
Patient Enrollment and Procedure Overview:  
Patients with stable ischemic heart disease or an ACS and planned coronary angiography in whom 
IVUS -NIRS imaging is likely to be performed will be asked to provide their consent for partic ipation in 
the study.  Angiography  and PCI  will be performed as clinically indicated.  Unblinded NIRS IVUS 
imaging will be performed in the vessel, or vessels, containing a single or multiple suspected culprit 
lesions.  Imaging for research purposes will b egin in non -culprit vessels after all clinically indicated PCI 
has been performed. If a staged procedure is required to achieve revascularization of all lesions 
detected by [CONTACT_89320], the patient is not enrolled until after the staged procedure is succes sful and 
uncomplicated.  
Imaging results in an artery not suspected to be a culprit will be blinded for NIRS, but not for IVUS.   
The imaging goal, which may not be attainable in all cases, is to obtain IVUS -NIRS  imaging from all [ADDRESS_636493] 2 major coronary arteries

Study follow -up:  
All enrolled patients with a large LRP (Maximum Lipid Core Burden Index > 250 in 4 mm) will be 
contact[CONTACT_494908] 2, 6, 12 and 24 months  to 
determine if a new coronary event has occurred.  A randomly selected half of the patients with a small,

indications. Clinical and imaging data for any follow -up event will be sent to the central angiographic and 
IVUS/NIRS core laboratory located at MedStar. The location of new culprit lesions will be identified by a 
clinical events committee (blinded to the baseline NIRS results), and compared to the bas eline NIRS 
findings by [CONTACT_89709].  
Endpoints:  
The primary outcome variable is Non -Index Culprit Lesion related Major Adverse Cardiac Events (NC -
MACE) defined as the composite of:  
 
 cardiac death,  
 cardiac arrest,  
 non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), 
 acute coronary syndrome,  
 revascularization by [CONTACT_494910],  
 rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_494886], adjudicated to a non - index culprit lesion 
secondary to significant fixed, non -reversible (not -spasm related) lesion 
progression of more than 20% from the baseline study (confirmed by [CONTACT_494911]).

2 INTRODUCTION  
2.1 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE FOR STUDY 
 
Plaque composition rather than degree of stenosis has been shown to play a pi[INVESTIGATOR_494889]. Vulnerable plaque is a term 
that represents “the susceptibility of a plaque to rupture” (1). Autopsy studies in patients who have died of cardiac 
causes have shown that the most common underlying plaque morphology is a ruptured thin-cap fibroatheroma 
(TCFA), with superimposed thrombosis (2). Although atherosclerosis is a pan-vascular process arising from 
systemic inflammation, vulnerable plaques are not present diffusely but are limited in number and are most 
commonly located in the proximal and mid segments of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_494890] (and distal in the right 
coronary artery) (3-5). Although several plaque types have been identified which are suspected to be prone to 
thrombosis, pathological studies conducted after events have occurred have found that the majority of culprit 
lesions are TCFAs, characterized by a large necrotic core with a thin (<65 µm) fibrous cap consisting of mostly 
type 1 collagen with few smooth muscle cells, infiltrated with macrophages and T lymphocytes (5,6). Cellular 
production of matrix metalloproteinases and other digestive enzymes, exacerbated by [CONTACT_494913], are suspected to lead to plaque rupture, followed by [CONTACT_494914].  
 
Most coronary events occur in individuals who would be classified as low or intermediate risk by [CONTACT_494915]. Conversely, many individuals with an apparently adverse risk 
factor profile remain asymptomatic. Thus, for contemporary medicine to improve, the challenge is to find and treat 
those unrecognized individuals at highest risk without harming those who do not need treatment (limiting both 
under treatment and overtreatment). Given this pathophysiological background, the goal emerged to identify in vivo 
the structural, morphological, chemical, and physical properties of the such vulnerable plaques in patients, with the 
ultimate goal of preventing plaque rupture, thereby [CONTACT_494916] (MI) and sudden cardiac death. 
While the coronary angiography is the gold standard for identification of obstructive CAD, the angiogram is very 
limited for detection of vulnerable plaque. It provides only limited information about the underlying composition of 
coronary plaques. Direct visualization of atherosclerosis rather than merely identifying obstructive disease may 
improve risk stratification for future events. Therefore, a number of intravascular diagnostic modalities have been 
extensively tested over the last decade. Among those most widely tested are radiofrequency intravascular 
ultrasound, angioscopy, optical coherence tomography and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) (14).  
 
 PROSPECT is a prospective study of long-term outcomes in patients presenting with ACS. At baseline, 3-vessel 
angiography and intracoronary imaging with grayscale and RF-IVUS were performed to evaluate the 
characteristics of non-culprit lesions suspected to progress over time and cause major adverse cardiac events 
(MACE), defined as the composite of cardiac death, cardiac arrest, MI, unstable angina or increasing angina 
requiring re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (7). By [CONTACT_91613], the only patient-level clinical variables independently 
associated with nonculprit lesion MACE during follow-up were insulin-treated diabetes and previous PCI (1). No 
angiographic variable was strongly associated with subsequent events. However, significant independent 
predictors of nonculprit lesion related MACE (i.e., events arising from those specific untreated lesions) were plaque 
burden ≥70% (hazard ratio [HR]: 5.03; p <0.001), the presence of a TCFA by [CONTACT_494917] -IVUS (HR: 3.35; p <0.001), and a 
minimal lumen area <4.0 mm2 (HR: 3.21, p < 0.001). The presence of 2 or 3 of these 3 characteristics identified 
lesions with a 10% and 18% likelihood, respectively, of an event arising from that site within 3 years (7). 
Conversely, the 3-year nonculprit lesion –related MACE rate in >1,650 IVUS lesions with none of these 3 
characteristics was only 0.3%, and no events arose from coronary segments with <40% plaque area. 
 
  The LRP Study PAGE [ADDRESS_636506] and treat vulnerable plaque noted that in 5 separate studies, a large 
plaque burden by [CONTACT_494918] a MACE culprit lesion, thus 
establishing the principle that vulnerable plaques can be detected.   (Madder, Muller, Journal of Interventional 
Cardiology, Supplement, 2013).    However the specificity of the detection has not been adequate to serve as a 
guide to therapy.   A more accurate measure of suspected vulnerable plaques is needed. 
 
As demonstrated by [CONTACT_494919], cholesterol-rich atherosclerotic plaques, which are likely to be vulnerable 
plaques, have a specific near-infrared spectroscopic (NIRS) chemical signature.  A TVC imaging system 
intracoronary catheter (InfraReDx, Inc., Burlington, [LOCATION_005]) has been developed to identify this NIRS 
signature [CONTACT_494949]. This novel catheter uses rotation and 
an automated pullback to generate a longitudinal chemographic road map of the coronary artery that demonstrates 
the presence and location of lipid-rich plaque (LRP) whose presence could not be determined by [CONTACT_494920]. The NIRS capability has now been combined with a high-quality grayscale IVUS imaging system.   
The combined IVUS-NIRS catheter is FDA cleared and has obtained a CE mark.  NIRS has been used in over 
6,[ADDRESS_636507] IVUS catheter. 
 
The algorithm identifies both “lipid -core plaque” (LCP ) which is synonymous with “necrotic core plaque”  (8-12) and 
“lipid pools” in which the cellular structure is intact, but an increased concentration of lipid is present.   The 
inclusive term “lipid -rich plaque” (LRP) describes both lipid -core plaque and plaques containing lipid pools.   
 
LRP appears to be the common thread linking plaque vulnerability and frank instability.  It is also evident that LRP 
can be present in more than one artery since in many cases, atherosclerosis is a multifocal pan-coronary process 
(5,6). Hence delineation of plaque composition in both culprit and non-culprit lesions, and in multiple types of 
clinical presentations may be important. NIRS has been rigorously validated against autopsy specimens and is 
now established as a method to accurately identify LRP in patients (8,9).  
 
NIRS has demonstrated that culprit lesions in patients with both non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (ACS) 
and in patients with stable angina frequently contain LRP (13).  A recent study by [CONTACT_494921] (JACC 
Interventions, 2013) demonstrated that large lipid-rich plaques, often circumferential and similar to those that will 
be tracked prospectively in the present study, were found at the culprit site in most patients experiencing an ST 
segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) (14). The findings of Madder et al in [ADDRESS_636508] now 
been reproduced in a larger group of 76 patients with STEMI studied in Sweden and in the US.  (Erlinge et al, 
European Atherosclerosis Society Presentation, 2013).   This cross-sectional study included a prospective test of 
the ability of a max 4mm LCBI > 400 to discriminate STEMI culprit lesions from other portions of the culprit artery.  
This measure was able to provide excellent discrimination, and will be utilized as a measure of a “suspected 
vulnerable plaque” in the prospective LRP Study . 
 
In addition to this cross-sectional data, the NIRS signature [CONTACT_494950]-term coronary 
outcomes.  A longitudinal study in 203 patients conducted by [CONTACT_494922] a non-culprit artery identified patients with a 4-fold increased risk of MACE over the 
subsequent year, thus detecting vulnerable patients (Omerawsingh et al, JACC, in press, 2013).  In addition, 
linkages with angioscopic findings have been established.  Ueda and colleagues at the Osaka Police Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_494891], which require the removal of blood to obtain a clear field of view, with NIRS 
findings which can be obtained more easily without the need for blood removal.   Sites that were yellow by 
[CONTACT_494923].  This equivalence is of particular importance because the 
finding of a yellow plaque by [CONTACT_494924] a vulnerable patient (Ohtani 
et al, Uchida et Am H J, 1995). These linkages with outcome studies, which build on the equivalence of angioscopy 
and NIRS, and represent only a small number of patients, require validation.  This is the purpose of the larger, 
definitive LRP Outcomes Study.

2.1.1 STUDY AIMS 
The aim of this global, multicenter, observational study is to evaluate the correlation between the presence of non-
intervened, non-flow-limiting lipid-rich plaques detected by [CONTACT_427741]-NIRS imaging in two or more coronary arteries 
and the future development of a Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE) within the subsequent [ADDRESS_636509] 
imaging.  
 
Endpoint: The primary outcome variable is Non-Culprit Major Adverse Cardiac Events (NC- MACE) defined as the 
composite of: 
 
 cardiac death,  
 cardiac arrest,  
 non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), 
 acute coronary syndrome,  
 revascularization by [CONTACT_494910], 
 rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_494886], adjudicated to a non index -culprit lesion secondary 
to significant fixed, non-reversible (not-spasm related) lesion progression of more than 20% 
from the baseline study (confirmed by [CONTACT_494925]). 
 
Follow- up: All patients with a large LRP (defined as at least one 4 mm length of artery with a LCBI ≥ 250 as 
assessed by [CONTACT_427741]-NIRS imaging ) will be followed for 24 months to determine the occurrence of MACE.  Patients 
without a large LRP will be randomly allocated in a one to one ratio to a 24 month follow-up, or no follow- up. 
 
Blinding:    The results of NIRS imaging will be partially blinded to minimize the possibility that detection of excess 
lipid will lead to bias created by [CONTACT_494926]/or over-reporting clinical symptoms . 
Treatment of the Index Culprit Artery (or arteries) will be performed in an unblinded manner with full access by [CONTACT_494927]-NIRS imaging.  For NIRS imaging performed for research purposes in a non-
culprit artery, the clinical site will be blinded to the NIRS results. The clinical site will not be blinded to the IVUS 
results in the non-culprit artery. 
 
2.1.[ADDRESS_636510] not undergone PCI :  
 
Firs
t, patients with increased max 4mm LCBI in all scanned arteries are more likely to experience NC-MACE than 
those without increased max 4mm LCBI (the vulnerable patient hypothesis);  
 
Second, coronary artery segments (defined as the proximal, mid, and distal segments of the major epi[INVESTIGATOR_494892], ) with increased max 4mm LCBI (within the segment) are more likely than segments without increased 
max 4mm LCBI to cause NC-MACE (t he vulnerable plaque hypothesis). 
 
The portion of the coronary artery or arteries to be studied will meet all of the following criteria:  
 The portion of the coronary artery does not contain a flow-limiting stenosis, defined as > 50% diameter 
stenosis by [CONTACT_494928]; 
  The portion of the coronary artery has not undergone PCI in the past, and PCI is not performed at the 
index event or planned in a staged procedure. The length of artery excluded from the study because of 
PCI includes a 5mm border on either side of the intervened segment. 
 
  The LRP Study PAGE [ADDRESS_636511] of the Vulnerable Patient Hypothesis 
 
The primary baseline measurement will be the maximum LCBI in 4 mm (max 4mm LCBI) over all 
scanned portions of the coronary arteries.  The portion of artery to be scanned will exclude sites 
in which PCI has been performed in the past or will be performed in the index procedure (also 
excluding 5 mm borders of any site that underwent PCI).   
 
The primary endpoint for the test of the vulnerable patient hypothesis will be the incidence of NC -
MACE within [ADDRESS_636512] or will be performed in the index 
procedure (including 5 mm borders of any site that underwent PCI).   
 
The primary endpoint for the test of the vulnerable plaque hypothesis will be the inciden ce of NC -
MACE within 24 months .  
 
The exposure-response function will be calculated for varying levels of max 4mm LCBI for each 
coronary artery segment.  It is hypothesized that increased levels of max 4 mm LCBI in a 
coronary artery segment will identify increased levels of risk for that segment of causing NC-
MACE within 24 months following the artery imaging.    
 
FOLLOW -UP  
 
All patients with a large LRP (defined as at least one 4mm segment with a max LCBI ≥ 250  as assessed 
by [CONTACT_427741]-NIRS imaging ) will be followed for [ADDRESS_636513] one large LRP will be randomly allocated in a 1:[ADDRESS_636514] will be examined.  
Examples of each category and their relation to the primary endpoint are given below. 
 
1) Measures of exposure – As stated above, the primary measure of exposure will be the Max 4mm 
LCBI.   Additional analyses will be performed with the average LCBI, the IVUS plaque volume and 
other new measures of exposure that may emerge during the study. 
2) Outcomes  – The primary outcome will be NC-MACE (at the patient level in the Vulnerable Patient 
analysis and the segment level in the Vulnerable Plaque analysis) within 24 months following artery 
imaging .   
3) Methods of analysis  – As stated above, the primary method of analysis will involve estimation and 
testing for a positive association between max 4 mm LCBI and incidence of NC-MACE.   Additional 
analyses of diagnostic performance will be performed for specific thresholds for max 4 mm LCBI, 
using the AUC and the net reclassification index as measures of performance. 
4) Subgroup analys es – The relationship between exposure and response will be explored in patients 
with and without specific characteristics such as initial imaging presentation with ACS, diabetes, renal 
insufficiency, hypertension, age>65, male gender, and elevated cholesterol at baseline.  
5) Outcome at the Stented Site    While not a primary feature of the LRP Outcomes Study, an analysis 
will be performed of the impact of lipid status on the outcomes at the sited stented at the baseline 
study.  
The LRP Study will test three secondary hypotheses about measures of patient-level risk derived from the 
NIRS chemogram, stated here in terms of the alternative hypothesis:   
 
1) A threshold of max 4mm LCBI > 400 will identify patients at increased risk of a NC-MACE event. 
2) An average LCBI in all scanned segments above the median will identify patients at increased risk of 
a NC-MACE event. 
3) The exposure-response function described for the primary vulnerable patient analysis, viz, the 
relationship of max 4mm LCBI to NC –MACE, will demonstrate that higher values of max 4mm LCBI 
are associated with increased risk of the individual hard endpoints (non-culprit cardiac death, cardiac 
arrest, and non-fatal MI) included in the full NC-MACE endpoint. 
The three pre-specified secondary hypotheses for the vulnerable-plaque level analysis are: 
 
1) An average threshold of max 4mm LCBI > 400 in a coronary artery segment will identify patients at 
increased risk of a NC-MACE event caused by a culprit lesion located within that segment. 
2) An average LCBI in a coronary artery segment  above the median will identify sites at increased risk 
of a NC-MACE event due to a culprit lesion located in that segment.

3) Plaque burden >70% by [CONTACT_494929] a max 4mm LCBI>400 in a coronary artery segment 
will be a stronger predictor of risk that Max 4 mm LCBI>400 alone. 
The following section provides written descriptions of additional tertiary hypotheses and exploratory 
analyses to be performed as part of the LRP Study: 
 
3.3 TERTIARY A NALYSES FOR THE VULNERABLE PATIENT STUDY  
 
 To assess the risk of MACE based on the m ax 4 mm LCBI observed in any scanned portion of the 
coronary arteries excluding all sites in which PCI has been performed (either at the index event, or earlier) 
 To assess NC MACE risk with area under the curve (AUC) analysis of a receiver operator characteristic 
(ROC) curve for varying threshold values of Max 4 mm LCBI .  
 To in
vestigate whether the risk of a coronary event increases with the number (count) of LRP ’s with max 
4mm LCBI > 400. 
 To characterize the extent (LCBI) and size (max 4mm LCBI) of LRPs among enrolled patients with ACS 
vs non-ACS, and with and without diabetes. 
 To determine the relationship between the extent of LRP (LCBI of scanned artery) and size of LRP (max 4 
mm LCBI) and the timing to the MACE.   
 To compare the IVUS study variables (plaque burden, remodeling index, and MLA ) in patients with MACE 
versus IVUS study variables in a randomly selected group of patients without MACE . For this group the 
study segments will be assessed for IVUS, NIRS and QCA findings.   
 To compare the IVUS variables with the NIRS findings for patients with MACE versus a randomly 
selected group without MACE.  
 To assess the primary endpoint (described above) with the addition of a NIRS thin-cap algorithm to 
identify LRPs with thick and thin caps (if available). 
 
3.4 TERTIARY A NALYSES FOR THE VULNERABLE PLAQUE STUDY  
 
 To assess the relationship between the size of LRP in a coronary artery segment (max LCBI > 4mm) and 
MACE with an AUC analysis of an ROC curve.  
 To determine whether the incidence of NC-MACE attributable to a Follow up Culprit Lesion at a given site 
is dependent on the LCBI of the 30 mm segment, excluding sites (and their borders) in which PCI was 
performed prior to or at the time of index procedure.  
 To assess the relationship between the maximum 4 mm LCBI detected in each 10mm segment of 
coronary artery scanned and the appearance of a new culprit lesion within the corresponding 10 mm 
segment of artery.  These 10 mm segments will exclude sites (and their borders) that underwent PCI prior 
to or during the index event. 
 The 10 mm segments will be given a hierarchal level with the higher assignment to those 10mm 
segments closer to the proximal portion of the scanned artery.

4.2 REVIEW OF CHEMOGRAM TO DETERMINE P ROTOCOL FOR FOLLOW -UP D EPENDING ON THE PRESENCE OR 
ABSENCE OF A LARGE LRP 
 
A
t the end of the index procedure the chemogram (the NIRS findings output) data for both the Suspected 
Index Culprit  Lesion or Lesions (unblinded) and Index N on-culprit (blinded) Arteries will be submitted to 
the NIRS Core Laboratory for evaluation. The Core Lab will review the chemogram to determine if a large 
LRP is present in an area that:  
1) had not undergone PCI in the past,  
2) did no
t undergo PCI at the time of the index procedure. 
Areas that have undergone PCI (stent, balloon or other device) plus a 5 mm border on either side of the 
intervened area will be excluded from analysis.   
 
A “large LRP” will be defined as a 4mm segment within the eligible area with an LCBI ≥ 250.    
 
The Large LRP Group:    All patients with a large LRP will be followed with a phone inquiry at 
2,6,[ADDRESS_636521] enrollment.  
 
The Small or No LRP Group:  Of this group, 50% will be randomly assigned (in a 1:1 fashion) 
to be followed with a phone inquiry at 2,6,[ADDRESS_636522] enrollment .

The follow-up status for each patient will be determined by [CONTACT_494931] 2 month follow- up window for the call.  The clinical site will remain 
blinded to the NIRS findings, as will the clinical events commi ttee. 
 
It is anticipated that approximately 1/[ADDRESS_636523] 2 coronary arteries, including the Index Culprit Artery. If PCI is performed during the index 
procedure, the artery length for study inclusion will exclude the segment undergoing PCI plus a border of 5mm on 
either side of the PCI treated segment.   Patients in whom IVUS-NIRS imaging is performed in only one artery will 
be considered screen failures.  
 
It is expected that IVUS-NIRS imaging of the Suspected Index Culprit Artery will be performed for routine clinical 
indications.   For this reason both NIRS and IVUS data from the culprit artery will be available in an unblinded 
fashion to the clinical site .   
 
IVUS imaging of Index N on-Culprit Arteries may be of immediate clinical value (detection of an unexpected stenotic 
area) while NIRS imaging of Index N on-Culprit Arteries will be performed for research purposes.  Hence for the 
Index N on-Culprit Arteries, IVUS data will be available to the clinical site, but NIRS data will be blinded.  
 
Follow-up will be conducted in 6,000 patients (as defined in figure 1) at 2,6,[ADDRESS_636524] patient enrolled will conclude in December 2017.   
 
If the goals of the study – identification of vulnerable patients and vulnerable plaque by [CONTACT_427741]-NIRS imaging – are 
achieved before the enrollment of 9,000 patients, the study will transition to a blinded, randomized study of the use 
of IVUS-NIRS imaging to guide treatment.

 As described above (Section 4 ) screening will be performed in patients presenting for coronary angiography in 
whom IVUS and/or NIRS evaluation is planned or could be utilized as a part of their clinically-indicated evaluation.  
Written informed consent will be sought prior to the catheterization procedure for those meeting the general 
inclusion and exclusion criteria.   
 
IVUS-NIRS imaging for a Suspected Index Culprit Lesion or Lesions and all clinically necessary treatment of 
Suspected Index Culprit Lesion(s) will be performed per standard practice.  Patients who have provided written 
informed consent will then undergo IVUS-NIRS imaging of the Index Non-Culprit Arteries for research purposes 
during the catheterization.  Those in whom the Investigator determines that acceptable IVUS-NIRS imaging has 
been completed in at least [ADDRESS_636526] 2 epi[INVESTIGATOR_494893] a cumulative 50mm of artery is imaged.. No additional data 
will be collected on such patients. 
 
Enrollment:  
Patients with a successful IVUS-NIRS scan of >50 mm length in 2 or more arteries will be enrolled in the Study.  
IVUS-NIRS should be performed in 2 or more major epi[INVESTIGATOR_494894].   
The portion of the coronary artery or arteries to be studied will meet all of the following criteria:  
 The portion of the coronary artery does not contain a flow-limiting stenosis, defined as > 50% diameter 
stenosis by [CONTACT_494928]; 
  The portion of the coronary artery has not undergone PCI in the past, and PCI is not performed at the 
index event or planned in a staged procedure. The length of artery excluded from the study because of 
PCI includes a  5mm border on either side of the intervened segment. 
 
Suspected Index Culprit Lesion or Lesions -- IVUS-NIRS Assessment: 
 
For a native artery deemed by [CONTACT_494932]-indicated IVUS interrogation, the TVC console will 
image and record the IVUS and NIRS findings in an unblinded fashion (meaning, both the IVUS and NIRS images 
and details as provided on the commercially available TVC system will be available to the clinical site for diagnosis 
and treatment of the artery).  The TVC system will display the images and details for all pull-backs performed 
within the Suspected Index Culprit Artery throughout the imaging and, if needed, for treatment of the Index Culprit 
Artery. The denotation of “suspected culprit’ and ‘culprit’ will be recorded on the case report form.  
 
Once the clinical team determines that all of the clinically-indicated IVUS has been completed, the clinical team will 
switch the TVC System to the NIRS-blinded mode, as specified in the Manual of Operations for the LRP Study.  
 
Index Non-Culprit Artery or Arteries -- IVUS-NIRS Assessment:  
 
For an artery that does not require clinically-indicated IVUS imaging, the TVC console will image and record the 
NIRS findings in a blinded fashion, only displaying the IVUS findings to the  clinical site (meaning, only the IVUS 
images and details as provided on the commercially available TVC system will be available to the physician) . The 
denotation of ‘ non-culprit ’ will be recorded on the case report form.

For patients who are enrolled, the IVUS-NIRS images will be submitted to the NIRS Core Laboratory within 5 
business days of collection and enrollment.  The NIRS Core Lab will then assess the totality of NIRS findings, 
excluding locations and 10  mm borders of locations that underwent PCI, to establish the patient level max 4mm 
LCBI of all scanned segments.  The NIRS Core Lab determination that the  per patient max 4mm LCBI is below 
250 will indicate that the patient will be randomized to follow-up or no follow-up.   Patients with values above > or = 
to 250 will all receive follow-up per figure 1.    The NIRS Core Lab will provide notification to the site prior to the 60 
day follow up time interval to indicate to the sites which patients require follow up.   The patient will be allocated as 
below:  
 
 Patients with a max 4mm LCBI of all scanned segment ≥ 250 will be followed for a 2 year period 
as described in section 5 .1.3. 
 Patients with a max 4mm LCBI of all scanned segment < 25 0 will be randomized to follow up or 
no follow up beyond hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  Patients randomized (in a 1:1 fashion) to follow up will 
be followed for a [ADDRESS_636527] data collected through hospi[INVESTIGATOR_494895].  
The NIRS findings from the Index Non-culprit Artery details including the Core Lab determined patient-level max 
4mm LCBI will be blinded to the clinical site.

Follow up: 
 
The site will be notified prior to the 60 day follow up window whether or not the patient requires follow up per the 
algorithm listed in section [IP_ADDRESS], Allocation to Follow up.  The NIRS Core Lab will notify the enrolling site of the 
follow up allocation without unblinding the max 4mm LCBI per patient value.

the fluoroscopy during the catheterization for all non-culprit arteries:   
 All catheters used throughout the procedure should be clearly visualized in the diagnostic cines with a 
straight (non-tapered) portion of the unfilled catheter for off-line image calibration.  The catheter and 
segment of interest should be centered in the image. At least [ADDRESS_636530] injection, 
should be recorded for calibration of empty catheter tip. 
 Qualitative and quantitative analysis will be performed using at least 2 (two) orthogonal angiographic 
views of the lesion. 
 Intracoronary NTG is not required.  However, if given during the procedure usage will be recorded on the 
angiographic technician’s worksheet.   
 If a PCI is pursued during the procedure this will be noted on the angiographic technician’s worksheet.  
 All catheter sizes used during the catheterization should be recorded as specified above and listed on the 
angiographic technician’s worksheet.  
 Images of the TVC ™ IVUS -NIRS catheter distal and proximal placements should be recorded by 
[CONTACT_494934]’s worksheet  for each run performed. 
5.1.6 TVC™ C O RONARY IVUS-NIRS  IMAGING GUIDELINES   
 
All IVUS-NIRS imaging will be performed, either in the culprit or non-culprit arteries utilizing the automatic, 
motorized pullback device.  The IVUS-NIRS catheter should be positioned as distal as clinically feasible within 
each vessel.  The pull back should continue as proximal as clinically feasible. Fluoroscopy capture of the IVUS-
NIRS catheter marker positioning should be recorded on cine run prior to initiation of the automatic, motorized pull 
back; this should then be repeated upon completion of the pull back. The pull back start and stop time for both 
Suspected Index Culprit Lesion and N on-Culprit Arteries will be recorded within the case report form.   
 
Within each native epi[INVESTIGATOR_494899].  All study artery/vessel 
imaging will occur using the automatic pullback transducer at a rate of 0.5mm/second.   
 
Suspected Index Culprit Lesion or Lesions --  IVUS-NIRS Assessment: 
 
For a native artery deemed by [CONTACT_494932]-indicated IVUS interrogation, the TVC console will 
image and record the IVUS and NIRS findings in an unblinded fashion (meaning, both the IVUS and NIRS images 
and details as provided on the commercially available TVC system will be available to the clinical site for diagnosis 
and treatment of the artery).   The TVC system will display the images and details for all pull-backs performed 
within the Suspected Index Culprit Artery throughout the imaging and, if needed, for treatment of the Index Culprit 
Artery. The denotation of “suspected culprit’ and ‘culprit’ will be recorded on the case report form.  
 
Once the clinical team determines that all of the clinically-indicated IVUS has been completed, the clinical team will 
switch the TVC System to the NIRS-blinded mode, as specified in the Manual of Operations for the LRP Study.  
 
Index Non-Culprit Artery or Arteries -- IVUS-NIRS Assessment:  
 
  The LRP Study PAGE [ADDRESS_636531] the 
NIRS findings in a blinded fashion, only displaying the IVUS findings to the clinical site (meaning, only the IVUS 
images and details as provided on the commercially available TVC system will be available to the physician. The 
denotation of ‘non -culprit’ will be recorded on the case report form.  
 
The processes for establishing the TVC system to blind the NIRS findings on the console are located in the Manual 
of Operations for the LRP Study.  
 
Study Segment(s): 
The portion of the coronary artery or arteries to be studied will meet all of the following criteria:  
 The portion of the coronary artery does not contain a flow-limiting stenosis, defined as > 50% diameter 
stenosis by [CONTACT_494928]; 
 The portion of the coronary artery has not undergone PCI in the past, and PCI is not performed at the 
index event or planned in a staged procedure. The length of artery excluded from the study because of 
PCI includes a  5mm border on either side of the intervened segment; 
 
For the off-line Core Laboratory NIRS analysis will include the following definitions for the vulnerable plaque-based 
primary endpoint evaluation.  
 
For each coronary artery with available IVUS-NIRS imaging, the proximal segment will be defined as the 
first 30mm of the proximal chemogram obtained in that vessel, the mid segment as the next 30mm, and the 
distal segment as the remaining chemogram up to a [ADDRESS_636532]’s (or legal guardian’s) withdrawal of 
consent. All reasons for withdrawal (if given) will be recorded in the source documentation.   
5.3 PROTOCOL VIOLATIONS  
All deviations from clinical protocol requirements, including ICH/GCP guidelines referred to in this protocol, will be 
considered protocol violations.  A ‘serious violation’ is one that may affect the scientific soundness of the protocol 
or one that would affect the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects.   
 
Subject level deviations are those that occur in direct association with a specific study subject. These include, but 
are not limited to, deviations from Informed Consent  procedures, inclusion/exclusion criteria, required clinical 
assessments.

coronary arteries. The objective of the study is to determine whether the presence of one or more LRPs is 
predictive of subsequent coronary events. A patient-level (Vulnerable Patient) and a plaque-level analysis 
(Vulnerable Plaque) will be conducted. 
 
Primary Hypotheses: 
 
The study will test two primary hypotheses, stated here in terms of the null hypothesis: 
 
H1:  Vulnerable Patient Hypothesis – During 24-month follow-up after IVUS-NIRS imaging, there will be no 
association between the baseline value of max 4mm LCBI (over all coronary artery segments included in the 
analysis ) and the incidence of non-culprit NC-MACE events.  (This hypothesis will be tested with a time- to-event 
analysis as described below). 
 
H2:  Vulnerable Plaque Hypothesis – During 24- month follow- up, there will be no association between the max 
4mm LCBI of the proximal, mid, or distal segment of a coronary artery and the incidence of a culprit lesion in that 
segment leading to a NC-MACE event.  
 
Additional Objectives: 
 
As noted above, the study will also investigate the prognostic value of multiple novel NIRS measures and 
conventional IVUS measures that can be evaluated in multiple ways.   
 
Statistical Methods: 
 
To test Hypothesis 1 (the Vulnerable Patient Hypothesis), we will first fit a univariate proportional hazards 
regression model in which max 4mm LCBI is the only independent variable and NC-MACE is the outcome.  The 
null hypothesis will be tested by [CONTACT_494935] a proportional hazards regression 
model is significantly different from 0.  This analysis will determine whether max 4mm LCBI is a risk factor for NC-
MACE.  In supportive analyses, we will assess the validity of the proportional hazards assumption.  We will also 
investigate the predictive value of the binary variables defined by [CONTACT_494936]-points of max 4mm LCBI.  The 
analyses using these cut-points will be used to calculate an ROC curve characterizing the prognostic value of 
presence of a lipid-rich plaque.    Weighted estimation will be required to estimate the ROC curve because of the 
underrepresentation of 3,000 individuals (absence of follow-up data) with no segments with max 4mm LCBI  ≥ [ADDRESS_636534] of Hypothesis 1.  Results from these analyses will be 
used to estimate the net reclassification improvement, a measure of the incremental prognostic value of a new 
prognostic variable.  Weighted estimation will also be required to calculate the NRI.  Other covariates to be 
considered as possible prognostic factors in the NRI analysis include but are not limited to age (10 year units), 
hypertension, diabetes (any), current smoking (at the time of NIRS evaluation), prior history of coronary disease, 
history of cardiovascular disease, BMI, index catheterization presentation status (ACS, unstable angina, stable 
angina, and positive EST),  total cholesterol level, use of statin therapy at discharge (as well as prior to index 
catheterization), requirement for at least 1 lesion treatment at the time of index catheterization), ADP antagonist at 
discharge, plasma lipid levels at baseline and during follow-up if available and history of renal insufficiency.  
 
  The LRP Study PAGE [ADDRESS_636535] Hypothesis 2 (the Vulnerable Plaque Hypothesis), we will treat the individual coronary artery segments as 
separate units of observation, with appropriate adjustment for clustering of segments within patients.  A study 
participant will typi[INVESTIGATOR_494900] [ADDRESS_636536] variances to account for clustering of segments within patients. 
 
As in the vulnerable patient analysis, we will investigate the predictive value of the binary variables defined by 
[CONTACT_494936]-points of max 4mm LCBI.  The analyses using various cut-points will be used to calculate an ROC 
curve characterizing the prognostic value of presence of a lipid-rich plaque in a coronary artery segment .    
Weighted estimation will be required to estimate the ROC curve because of the exclusion from follow- up of 3,000 
of the 9,000 enrolled patients with no segments with max 4mm LCBI ≥ [ADDRESS_636537] 720 patients (8%) will experience a NC-MACE event.  We expect to find approximately 3,000 patients 
with large LRP (max 4mm LCBI ≥ 250 ).  All 3,[ADDRESS_636538] the hypothesis that there will be no association between the baseline value of max 
4mm LCBI (over the entire area scanned) and the incidence of NC-MACE.   
 
In PROSPECT registry results, the 24-month cumulative incidence of NC-MACE in patients was approximately 
10%.  Subsequent STEMI literature indicates that patients with large LRP will have a higher rate than that 
observed in PROSPECT.  
 
For the power calculations below, we assumed 6,000  evaluable patients, an event rate between 4 and 8% in the 
overall LRP study , and a two-sided alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_636539] sizes: hazard ratio of 1.18, 1.20, and 1.22 
per 100 unit increase in max 4mm LBCI (calculated in PASS 12).  These results demonstrate that the study will 
have 80% power to detect a minimal effect size of 1.18 per 100 unit increase in the max 4mm LCBI with 6,000 
patients and an overall cumulative incidence of 5% at 24 months. As described in section 5.3, interim analyses will 
be performed at 6 month intervals.

segments (24,000) and an overall cumulative incidence of 1.25% within the segments at 24 months.

If the hazard ratio for increased LCBI reaches or exceeds 5, the LRP Study will provide definitive evidence that 
max 4mm LCBI predicts NC-MACE well before 6,[ADDRESS_636543] been met, the 
LRP Study will transition to a treatment study.  This treatment study will include a control arm in which more 
detailed questions regarding the prognostic value of LCBI in various subgroups can be addressed in great detail. 
 
The transition to a treatment study will require submission of a new protocol to the IRBs of the participating 
centers. 
 
The interim analysis plan for the LRP Outcomes Study will be based on the Pocock spending function for repeated 
significance testing.  This spending function will provide a greater opportunity for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_494902] O’ Brien-Fleming or Haybittle-Peto spending functions.  Specifically, review of 
accumulated data by [CONTACT_140308] (DSMB) will occur on December 1, 2014 and at 6 
month intervals thereafter until December 1, 2016. The DSMB will review the accumulated data to determine 
whether, in the multivariate analyses described in Section 5.1, both the vulnerable patient and the vulnerable 
plaque null hypotheses are statistically significant at the level required by [CONTACT_494937].  If those conditions are met, the DSMB may recommend termination of the 
study.  If the study continues to the planned completion of two-year follow-up of all patients enrolled in the follow-
up study, the two null hypotheses will be tested at the same significance level as that employed in the interim 
analyses. Additional information regarding the interim analysis plan will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP).

10.1  DATA SAFETY MONITORING COMMITTEE  
The D ata Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will consist of one cardiologist and one bio-statistician with the 
remaining members to be announced. The purpose of the committee during the course of the trial will be to review 
accumulating safety data , to monitor the hazard ratio with regard to the Endpoints and other trends that would 
warrant modification or early termination of the trial.  
 
The DSMC may request any data it deems necessary to review. The minimum frequency of DSMC meetings will 
be twice during the study period and to establish the charter prior to the first data review meeting.  The DSMC may 
call a meeting at any time if there is a reason to believe there may be a safety issue with the study.  The DSMC 
chairperson will notify the sponsor of the meeting conclusions by [CONTACT_494938] .   
 
Any DSMC recommendations for study modification or termination, because of concerns over patient safety or 
issues relating to data monitoring or quality control, will be submitted to the sponsor of the trial in writing for 
consideration and final decision. If the DSMC at any time determines that a potential serious risk exists to patients 
in this trial, the DSMC chairman will immediately verbally notify the Sponsor, followed by [CONTACT_494939] n. 
10.2  CLINICAL EVENTS ADJUDICATION COMMITTEE  
 
A Clinical Events Committee (CEC) consisting of at least three members will be established to review and 
adjudicate all clinical endpoints as defined in the protocol.  The CEC will be independent from the study Sponsor.  
The primary mission of the Committee is to audit and review any major clinical event that occur within the follow up 
period for the purpose of accurate classification. The Committee will meet on an on-going basis as necessary to 
assure timely review of the data. Endpoint adjudication will be transmitted to the Data Analysis Center at MedStar 
for adjustment of the final database as necessary.  The CEC will be blinded to all the Index IVUS-NIRS findings

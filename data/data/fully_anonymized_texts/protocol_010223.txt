Version Date: 3.10.[ADDRESS_543790] disease (chronic GVHD)  
Chronic graft -versus -host disease (chronic GVHD) is a major late complication of 
allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), which affects up to 70% of HCT 
recip ients. The syndrome is associated with major transplant -related morbidity, 
mortality, infectious complications, prolonged duration of immune suppression, and impaired patient -reported quality of life.
1-[ADDRESS_543791] organs can be involved, with parallels to other systemic immune- mediated disorders, such as 
systemic lupus erythematosis, Sjogren’s disease, and systemic sclerosis.  Clinical predictors for the development of chronic GVHD reported in published literature most consistently include increasing age of the donor or recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], donor/recipi[INVESTIGATOR_429740] (greater risk in unrelated vs. matched sibling donors), male recipi[INVESTIGATOR_429741] e donors, prior development of acute 
GVHD, and the use of peripheral blood mobilized stem cells vs. bone marrow. 
9-[ADDRESS_543792]. The previousl y accepted severity 
classification defined limited involvement as restricted to limited cutaneous involvement and/or hepatic dysfunction, while extensive disease denoted more substantial manifestations such as generalized cutaneous involvement, hepatic dysfunction with biopsy confirmation of chronic aggressive hepatitis, bridging necrosis or cirrhosis, or involvement of other target organs, such as the eye, mouth, or lung.
[ADDRESS_543793] the previously accepted scheme based on limited vs. extensive involvement. Rather, severity is scored according to objective criteria for each organ involved, which is summarized for an overall severity score of mild, moderate or severe.

Version 7.0 
Version Date: 3.10.[ADDRESS_543794] primary therapy for chronic GVHD includes 1mg/kg or greater of 
prednisone or equivalent with or without a calcineurin inhibitor.2,15 The addition of other 
systemic immune suppressive agents has not provided benefit, as evidenced by [CONTACT_429784], thalidomide , or hydroxychloroquine combined with steroids,16-18 
or the more recent trial evaluating the combination of steroids and mycophenolate mofet il.
19  However, further work remains to improve the success of primary therapy for 
chronic GVHD, as response is often incomplete.  
In the a nalysis of major published primary chronic GVHD therapy trials ,15-20 the following 
summarizes current evidence : Complete response rate assessed at 6- 9 months 
following steroid based therapy (either 1mg/kg of prednisone alone or this in combination with additional agents such as azathioprine, thalidomide, hydroxychloroquine or mycophenolate mofetil) includes a range of reported values from 
16% to 37%. In the study by [CONTACT_165166], et al , 9 month complete response rate to 
prednisone was 33%, prednisone + azathioprine 37%, and prednisone alone among 
high risk cases 16%.
16 Arora, et al  reported 6 month complete response rate of 17% in 
prednisone + thalidomide and cyclosporine, and 28% for prednisone and cyclosporine 
alone.17 In a more recent trial comparing activity of prednisone vs. prednisone and 
mycophenolate mofetil, Martin, et al  reported a 6 month complete response rate of only 
23%.19 Finally, Gilman, et al reported CR rates  at 9 months of 38% and 33%, 
respectively for hydroxychloroquine + prednisone vs. prednisone alone. Thus, available randomized trials suggest an average complete response rate at 6- 9 months of 27%. 
Overall response rate (ORR) (total of complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)) 
has been reported as the following: Sullivan, et al reported ORR of  62% among 
prednisone treated patients, 64% for prednisone with azathioprine, and only 32% for prednisone treated patients with thrombocytopenia.
16 Arora, et al reported ORR of 84% 
at 6 months for prednisone treated patients and 88% for those treated with prednisone and thalidomide.
17 Martin, et al reported an ORR of 62% at 6 months for patients treated 
with prednisone + mycophenolate mofetil or prednisone + placebo.19,21 Gilman, et al 
reported ORR at 9 months of 39% and 46% for hydroxychloroquine + prednisone vs. 
prednisone alone.18 Thus, published randomized trials support an average ORR at 6-9 
months of 60% . Importantly, Martin, et al demonstrated that ORR at 6 months of 
therapy was significantly associated with the ultimate risk for treatment failure, defined as initiation of secondary systemic GVHD treatment, non- relapse death, or devel opment 
of Bronchiolitis Obliterans. The cumulative incidence of treatment failure was 37% vs. 63% in those with overall response vs. not, p = 0.01.
[ADDRESS_543795] commonly been defined as either progressive manifestations despi[INVESTIGATOR_429742], or rather incomplete response despi[INVESTIGATOR_380002] 1- 2mg/kg of prednisone or 
equivalent.
[ADDRESS_543796] demonstrated moderate activity in this setting, both ameliorating objective chronic GVHD manifestations, as well as importantly facilitating liberation from systemic steroids. Their activity is incomplete, however, and many with steroid- refractory chronic 
GVHD will require multiple agents to achieve disease control. The overall burden of chronic GVHD despi[INVESTIGATOR_380003], limited response to

primary and salvage therapy, and the attendant morbidity and mortality all speak to the 
rationale for novel approaches to primary therapy.  
 
Assessment of therapeutic response in chronic GVHD  
The established method for response determination in the majority of chronic GVHD 
therapy trials is that of clinician- determined response. This method relies on the treating 
clinician’s integration of dynam ic chronic GVHD manifestations  for a summary response 
categorization of complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), 
or progressive disease (PD). CR indicates complete resolution of all chronic GVHD manifestations; PR signifies reduction in disease activity at response assessment compared to pre- treatment levels, but without complete resolution; SD indicates no 
response and no progression; and PD indicates progressive chronic GVHD manifestations from baseline to response assessment. This response assessment tool will be utilized for the primary endpoint of 6 month ORR in this trial, and for the purpose of power/sample size estimation with reference to historical published data on [ADDRESS_543797] been 
proposed. These include change in overall NIH severity categories, proposed NIH response criteria, 0- 4 and 0- 10 ordinal scales that rely on clinician assessment, organ-
specific tools such as the Vienna skin scale, as well as patient -determined change in 
chronic GVHD activity, chronic GVHD associated symptom burden, functional limitations, and change in quality of life. A nat ional Chronic GVHD Consortium is 
currently assessing these competing measures of disease activity and their relationship to longer -reaching outcomes indicating clinical benefit, such as failure- free survival, 
discontinuatio n of all immune suppression, overall survival, or patient -reported benefit . 
However, to date these remain proposed tools that lack validation for the purpose of 
chronic GVHD clinical trial design and response determination.  
Accordingly, clinician -determined response (CR, PR, SD, PD) remai ns the standard for 
the primary measure of therapeutic response in clinical trial s. However, comprehensive 
information needed to calculate response according to proposed metrics will be 
collected ( see appendix  C) during the trial. We will report these data  as secondary 
measures of response, and will study both the level of agreement between these 
competing response measures and their association with long -term measures of chronic 
GVHD treatment success.  
  
Clinical Insights into chronic GVHD pathogenesis  
While major insights have resulted from investigation into pathobiology of acute GVHD, 
our understanding of the mechanisms underlying chronic GVHD development and 
maintenance is limited. Murine and human clinical data suggest a clear role for donor alloreacti ve T cells in chronic GVHD pathogenesis: Peripheral blood mobilized stem cell 
products, which contain a greater dose of donor T cells compared to bone marrow harvested stem cells, impose a greater risk for the occurrence and severity of chronic 
GVHD and an  associated prolonged duration of immune suppression.

vivo T cell depletion strategies, as well as in vivo  strategies such as anti -thymoc yte 
globulin (ATG) or alemtuzumab,22-[ADDRESS_543798] 
other important mechanisms.  
Major clinical observations support the role of loss of B -cell tolerance and altered B cell 
homeostasis following transplantation in chronic GVHD pat hogenesis: First, 
autoantibodies are often detected in patients with chronic GVHD.26-[ADDRESS_543799] less risk for steroid-requiring chronic GVHD compared to historical controls that did not receive prophylactic Rituximab.  
 
Altered B cell homeostasis and excess BAFF in chro nic GVHD development  
In a minor histocompatibility -mismatched murine model of chronic GVHD, donor B cells 
were required for the development of chronic GVHD.
37 Following transplant 
conditioning, recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] B cells are depleted, and donor B cells demonstrate altered 
reconstitution. Pre- clinical models demonstrate that B cell– activating factor (BAFF) has 
a key role in B cell reconstitution and homeostasis. In such models, B cell survival is 
dependent on B cell receptor and BAFF signaling, and B cell homeostasis is dependent 
on soluble BAFF concentration. BAFF levels, as well as the balance of autoreactive B cells and competing naïve B cells determine the fate of autoreactive B cells.
38,[ADDRESS_543800].
40 These included ‘group 1’ of 57 patients (22 with 
active chronic GVHD, 23 with inactive chronic GVHD, and 12 with no chronic GVHD), 
and  ‘group 2’ of [ADDRESS_543801] (including [ADDRESS_543802]). 
B cell phenotype was studied following isolation of lymphocytes from whole blood samples using the Ficoll method. Soluble BAFF from plasma samples was determined using enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In the group 1, comparisons were 
made in BAFF level, CD19+ B cell numbers, and BAFF to B cell ratio: Those with active chronic GVHD had significantly greater BAFF, lower CD19+ B cell number, and greater BAFF to B cell ratio compared to those with inactive chronic GVHD, no prior chronic

GVHD, and 33 healthy controls.  As well, antigen naïve B cells 
(CD19+IgD+ CD38LoCD27- ) were significantly lower in those with chronic GVHD 
compared to patients without chronic GVHD. Conversely, CD27+ B cell subsets (IGD+ 
memory B, Pre -GC, Post- GC memory B, and plasmablast/plasma cell (PB/PC)) 
proportions were greater in those with active chronic GVHD compared to other groups. Increasing BAFF levels correlated with increasing numbers of activated pre- GC and 
PB/PC cells in chronic GVHD.  
In the prospective (‘group 2’) cohort, serial BAFF levels, B cell numbers and phenotype were measured at [ADDRESS_543803]. In patients (n=8) who did not develop chronic GVHD and patients following autologous transplant (n=8), BAFF levels were elevated early after transplant at 1 and 3 months. In these two groups, BAFF levels declined as B cell numbers increased. In the 17 patients who developed chronic GVHD, 
BAFF levels remained high despi[INVESTIGATOR_16866] B cell numbers. While the proportion of CD27+ B cells decreased as BAFF levels returned to normal in those who did not develop chronic GVHD, those with chronic GVHD had elevated CD27+ B cells that persisted 
over [ADDRESS_543804]. A consolidative model suggests that, in patients who develop chronic GVHD, high BAFF levels and decreased numbers of naïve B cells (high BAFF/B cell ratio) support alloreactive pre- and post -germinal center CD27+ B cells that 
contribute to chronic GVHD development.  
 
Ofatumumab – summary of pharmacokinetics, toxicology, and human clinical trial 
data 
Ofatumumab ( also known as HuMax -CD20) is a human immunoglobulin G1 kap pa 
(IgG1κ) monoclonal antibody (mAb) which targets a unique epi[INVESTIGATOR_429743]20 
molecule.  
 Nonclinical Pharmacology  
Binding of ofatumumab causes clustering of CD20 on the cell surface and cell death 
through the induction of complement mediated cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody  
dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). In vitro studies showed that ofatumumab 
is able to kill tumor B cells including those with low CD20 expression, such as primary  
chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cells, and cells with high expression of  
complement defense molecules. Compared to rituximab, ofatumumab showed potential in nonclinical studies to be more potent at inducing CDC, especially in cells with low 
CD20 expression. As a fully human antibody, ofatumumab is predicted to be less 
immunogenic than rituximab,  which is a chimeric monoclonal antibody.  
 
Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics and Toxicology  
An in vitro human tissue cross- reactivity study has confirmed that ofatumumab binding 
is restricted to B cells within the peripheral blood circulation and human lymphoid 
tissues, suggesting there is little likelihood of non- pharmacologically mediated effects.   
In monkey repeat dose toxicity studies, ofatumumab elicited the predicted 
pharmacological response; specific binding of ofatumumab to CD20+ B cells and the  
induction of cell death. Intravenous (IV) administration to monkeys for up to 7 months

profoundly decreased circulating B cells and resulted in moderate germinal center and 
follicular atrophy in the lymph nodes, Peyer’s patches and spleen. Following clearance 
of ofatumumab, repletion of B cell counts and a reversal of the tissue changes noted  
during the study were observed. Subcutaneous (SC) administration to monkeys in the 2 
dose subcutaneous and intravenous bridging study demonstrated similar changes in the depletion and recovery of B cells. The pharmacokinetics of ofatumumab was typi[INVESTIGATOR_12340] a monoclonal antibody with low clearance, a small volume of distribution and a relatively  
long half -life. 
There were no other ofatumumab- related systemic effects (including effects on the 
delayed type hypersensitivity response) or histopathological changes in monkeys  
following chronic exposure to ofatumumab. However, a minor reduction in the magnitude of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) response to the keyhole limpet haemocyanin 
(KLH) antigen was noted in monkeys dosed at 20 and 100 mg/kg.  
There were 5 unscheduled deaths in the intravenous 7 month repeat dose study. Three 
out of 42 monkeys succumbed to a probable C. jejuni infection; a common yet 
proble matic  fecal -oral transmitted pathogen in monkeys. This infection was not 
considered to be ofatumumab treatment -related and no increase in susceptibility to 
infection has been reported in the clinical studies. Hemolytic anemia occurred in [ADDRESS_543805] Coombs’ 
test indicative  of the presence of anti -drug antibodies (ADAs). It is most likely that the 
hemolytic  anemia was due to a strong ADA response to ofatumumab, which induced 
immune  complex formation. Binding of immune complexes to the surface of the red 
blood cells is  thought to have resulted in sequestration of the coated red cells in the 
spleen causing the hemolytic anemia.   
ADAs have been detected in several monkey toxicity studies following both IV and SC  
administration. However, no toxicities directly associated with the ADAs have been 
reported and an ADA response in monkeys is not considered indicative of an ADA  
response in humans. No maternal toxicity, adverse effects on embryofetal development 
or teratogenicity  occurred in the monkey embryofetal development study at doses up to 
100 mg/kg. The effect on human pregnancy is unknown.  
 
Effects in Humans  
Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics Pharmacokinetic data are currently available from eight completed studies (Study Hx - 
CD20 -001, Study Hx -CD20 -402, Study Hx -CD20 -406, Study OMB111148, Study  
OMB112758, Study Hx -CD20 -403, Study OFA110867, and Study  EN414/OMS115102), 
three concluded studies (Study Hx -CD20 -405, Study Hx -CD20 -407, and St udy Hx -
CD20 -409), and two ongoing studies (Study GEN410/OFA110635  [double- blind and 
open- label treatment periods completed], and Study  GEN411/OFA110634 [completed 
up to 24 weeks]). Ofatumumab was administered by  [CONTACT_429785]1 [ZIP_CODE], in which it was given by  [CONTACT_6567] (SC) injection.  After repeated 
IV administration, clearance and volume of distribution values were low  and half -life 
values were long for ofatumumab, as seen with other monoclonal antibodies.  
Statistically significant increases in AUC, Cmax, and t½ values and decreases in CL  
 
Version 7.0 
Version Date: 3.10.[ADDRESS_543806] infusions. These findings are likely due to 
the rapid and sustained depletion of CD20+ B cells after first infusion, leaving a reduced number of B  cells available for the antibody to bind at subsequent infusions.   
Subcutaneous administration of a single dose of ofatumumab ≥30 mg in subjects with 
RA similarly resulted in rapid and sustained B -cell depletion.  
 
Summary of safety data Infusion reactions  in the IV program are common adverse events (AEs) that are 
generally  mild to moderate in severity, and have been mitigated by [CONTACT_429786]. Severe infusion reactions have been reported, and have 
occasionally led to temporary interruption or withdrawal of ofatumumab. Adverse events 
in the SC  program to date have also shown severe reactions, but overall, most AEs 
have been generally mild to moderate, and have been considered as post -injection 
systemic reactions (PI[INVESTIGATOR_429744]). Infectious events including lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_429745], anemia, and thrombocytopenia have been 
observed in oncology trials with ofatumumab, but these events are commonly reported 
with the  diseases under study and/or other concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Neutropenia and 
serious  infections have also been reported in RA studies, but these generally occurred 
at a similar  frequency between the ofatumumab and placebo groups . 
 Safety data from clinical trials utilizing the proposed dose/schedule of 
ofatumumab  
In a phase I/II study of escalating dose ofatumumab (300mg, 700mg or 1,000mg delivered on days 0 and 14) for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients who had failed prior disease modifying (DMARD) therapy, the study therapy was generally well tolerated. Part A was a double- blind, placebo- controlled, dose escalation study with randomized 
treatment allocation within each of 3 sequential dose cohorts. Subjects  received 2 
infusions on Day 0 and Day 14 of either ofatumumab (300 mg: n=12; 70 0 mg:  n=10; 
1000 mg: n=10) or placebo (n=7) and were followed for safety, efficacy, and PK  
measurements for 24 weeks. Part B was a double- blind, placebo- controlled parallel 
group study with randomization (1:1:1:1) into 1 of 4 treatment arms. Subjects received 2 infusions on Day 0 and Day 14 of either ofatumumab 300 mg (n=58), 700 mg (n=57), 1000 mg (n=54), or placebo (n=56) and were followed for safety, efficacy, and PK measurements for 24 weeks. In addition, following implementation via a protocol amendmen t, efficacy data, selected safety data (B cells, immunoglobulins, and SAEs) 
and samples for HAHA analysis were collected at Weeks 36 and 48.  Pre-medication 
with corticosteroids was not initially required; however, based on severe infusion- related 
reactions  reported during Part A and Part B, the protocol was amended to include pre-
medication with corticosteroids, an additional dose of antihistamine, and an increased 
infusion volume and infusion time.  
A total of [ADDRESS_543807]  
frequently reported AEs were nausea, fatigue, urticaria, hypotension, rash, pyrexia,  
vomiting, diarrhea, chills, dyspnea, headache, hyperhidrosis, and leukocyturia. A total of 164 AEs were reported in the ofatumumab treatment groups; these AEs were generally of mild or moderate intensity, while 7% (12 events) were severe and one was life-

threatening (anaphylactoid- like reaction). Adverse events judged as related to study 
product were mainly infusion- related and were also those most frequently reported. The 
most frequent symptoms reported on an infusion day were rash, urticaria, and 
hypotension. Of the AEs reported in the ofatumumab groups, 79/164 (48%) were reported on an infusion day. Among these, AEs were reported with substantially hig her 
frequency on the first infusion day (74/79, 94%) compared with the second infusion day, with no evidence of a dose effect.  
 
The safety population for Part B comprised all 225 exposed subjects. A total of 81%, 84%, 85%, and 57% of subjects in the [ADDRESS_543808] one AE. Among the 675 AEs reported,  66% (356/540) in 
the active dose groups and 41% (55/135) in the placebo group were  considered as 
related to study drug. The most frequently reported  AEs in the total active treatment 
group were rash, throat irritation, dyspnea, pharyngolaryngeal pain, nausea,  pruritus, 
and urticaria (Table 36). A total of 540 AEs were reported in the ofatumumab treatment

Version Date: 3.10.2016  10 
group; these AEs were generally of mild- to-moderate intensity, with 32 severe and 2 
life-threatening events (breast cancer and pneumonitis).  
 
A total of 3 SAEs were reported in Study 403 Part A; [ADDRESS_543809] experienced Grade 2 urticaria; ofatumumab infusion was paused, but when 
restarted the urticaria worsened. Treatment was discontinued and the urticaria resolved after 2.5 hours. One event of cardiac ischemia was reported in the 1000 mg dose group and was considered unrelated to treatment with ofatumumab. No deaths were reported.  
Two SAEs were reported during the Part A follow -up period as follows: cellulitis in one 
subject in the 700mg group and intervertebral disc protrusion in one subject in the 1000mg group. Neither event was considered related to treatment with ofatumumab by [CONTACT_093].  In part B, a total of 36 SAEs were reported in 26 subjects (24 events up 
to Week 24 and 12 events between Week 24 and Week 48). A higher incidence of SAEs, primarily infusion -related events, was observed in the 1000 mg group compared 
with the placebo, 300 mg, or 700 mg groups. No AEs had a fatal outcome.  Of the 11 
SAEs considered related to ofatumumab, 5 were infusion related, with 4 of the 5 infusion- related SAEs having occurred prior to implementation of the final protocol 
amendment t hat optimized the pre- medication regimen to decrease the frequency and

intensity of infusion- related reactions. Of the remaining, there were 3 infections 
(bronchopneumonia, urinary tract infection, cellulitis) and [ADDRESS_543810] with the pneumonitis had 
been receiving MTX, for 5 years. Other than infusion- related events, a review of the 
safety data including the serious events from this study did not provide evidence of a causal relationship between the reported events and ofatumumab use.  
 
 
Summary of efficacy data Efficacy in follicular lymphoma  
In Study Hx -CD20 -001, 15 of 37 (41%) evaluable subjects with FL obtained objective 
responses across all ofatumumab dose groups (300 mg, n=8:  63%; 500 mg, n=9: 33%;  
700 mg, n=10: 20%; and 1000 mg, n=10: 50%) and included 4 (11%) subjects with 
complete response (CR), 3 (8%) subjects with CRu, and 8 (22%) subjects with PR. A

Version Date: 3.10.2016  12 
total of 19 (51%) subjects had SD and 3 subjects had PD. The median TTP for all  
subjects was 8.8 months and the median duration of response was 29.9 months. The 
time to next FL therapy was not reached during the study. In Study Hx -CD20 -405, a 
total of 116 subjects were treated with two dose levels of single- agent ofatumumab. T he 
ORR in the total population was 11%. This group of subjects was highly refractory with 65% refractory to their last chemotherapy. Subjects in the study had previously received a median of 4 prior treatment regimens. The 1000 mg dose group (n=86) demonst rated 
an ORR of 10% (1 CR, 8 PR). In addition, 50% of subjects in the 1000 mg treatment arm had stable disease (SD). The ORR among subjects in both treatment arms who were refractory to prior rituximab monotherapy (n=27) was 22%. The ORR in subjects who we re refractory to rituximab in combination with chemotherapy was 7%, and the 
ORR among subjects refractory to rituximab maintenance was 9%. Median PFS was 3.2 months in the 500 mg dose group and 6.0 months in the 1000 mg dose group. At the time of this analysis, median OS was 31.7 months in the 1000 mg dose group (not estimable in the 500 mg dose group, as the estimated curve for OS did not cross the horizon line that represents the survival probability of 50%). In Study Hx -CD20 -409 
(N=58), subjects with previously untreated FL were randomized to two dose levels of ofatumumab in combination with CHOP: 300 mg of ofatumumab (cycle 1) followed by 500 or 1000 mg of ofatumumab (cycles 2- 6), in combination with CHOP, every 3 weeks 
for 6 cycles. Results demonstrated an ORR of 90% in the 500 mg group (n=29) and 
100% in the 1000 mg group (n=29). For the secondary endpoint of complete response, the rate was 21% for the 500 mg group and 31% for the 1000 mg group.  
 
Efficacy in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)  
In Study H x-CD20 -402 (N=33), ofatumumab treatment in subjects with relapsed or  
refractory CLL led to a 48% ORR in the highest dose group, Group C (n=27; 1st dose:  
500 mg; 2nd, 3rd, and 4th dose: 2000 mg), and included 12 (44%) subjects with PR and 
1(4%) subject with nodular partial response (nPR). One of the subjects showed all  
features of an nPR at Week 19 except that residual lymphadenopathy was identified by  
[CONTACT_20420] (CT). For Group C, the median TTP was 15.6 weeks in the full  
analysis population and 23  weeks in the subgroup of responders. The median duration 
of response was 16 weeks and the median time to next CLL therapy was 52.4 weeks.  
In Study Hx -CD20 -406 (N=154 as of the interim data cutoff of 19 May 2008;N=223 in  
the final CSR analysis), the protoc ol-defined results of ORR as assessed by [CONTACT_429787] (IRC), demonstrated that the ofatumumab regimen is  
effective in subjects with CLL who are either refractory to both fludarabine and  
alemtuzumab (i.e., DR) or who are refractory to flu darabine and considered 
inappropriate for alemtuzumab treatment due to the presence of bulky (>5cm) lymphadenopathy (i.e., BFR). Additionally, ofatumumab was effective in “Other” subjects who failed fludarabine but were enrolled in the study prior to Amend ment [ADDRESS_543811] or BFR defined in the amendment. The information from this interim data analysis formed the basis of the regulatory approval in the US, EU, Australia, Switzerland, and Croatia as ARZE RRA™, 
for the treatment of patients with CLL refractory to fludarabine and alemtuzumab.  
Improvements in the individual components (i.e., constitutional symptoms,  
organomegaly, lymphadenopathy) of the response assessment as well as ECOG  
performance were observed. Of note, the median lymphocyte count and median lymph

endpoint analysis of [ADDRESS_543812] (N= 95), BFR (N= 112), and Other (N=16) groups. The ORR was 49% (47/95) 
in the DR group, 43% (48/112) in the BFR group, and 63% (10/16) in the Other  
group. Among the [ADDRESS_543813], BFR and Other groups, respectively. The median overall survival (OS) was 13.[ADDRESS_543814] group, 17.4 months in the BFR group, and 28.3 months in the Other group. In Study Hx -CD20 -407 (N=61), subjects with previously 
untreated CLL obtained objective responses. The ORR in the 500 mg group was 77% and in the 1000 mg group was 73%. CR were observed in 32% of subjects (10/31) in 
the 500 mg group and in 50% of subjects (15/30) in the 1000 mg group. Overall, across both dose groups 25 subjects had CR, 19 subjects had PR, 2 subjects had nPR, 5 subjects had SD and 7 subjects had PD. Time- to-event endpoints were measured over 
2 years. Median duration of response was 32.0 months for the 500 mg group (not estimable for the 1000 mg group). Median PFS was 33.0 months for the 500 mg group and 23.5 months for the 1000 mg group. Time to next anti -CLL therapy was 31.9 
months for the 500 mg group and 26.7 months for the 1000 mg group. In Study OMB111148 (N=6), a total of 6 subjects with CLL were treated with two dose  
levels of single -agent ofatumumab. The ORR in the 6 subjects was 50%. All [ADDRESS_543815] had SD and 2 subjects had PD. The median PFS for all subjects was 32.1 weeks and the median duration of response was 30.8 weeks in the 1000 mg group. In Study OMB112758, conducted in Japan and Korea, 10 subjects received 8 weekly intravenous infusions of ofatumumab (1st dose: 300 mg; 2nd – 8th dose: 2000 mg) followed 5 weeks later by 4 monthly 
infusions of 2000 mg ofatumumab. For the 10 subjects, the overall response rate (PR or better) was 70% as assessed by [CONTACT_429788]; all of the seven responders had PR. The remaining 3 subjects had SD.

In Study GEN415/OMB111776, 81 subjects with CD20+ relapsed DLBCL ineligible for 
autologous stem cell transplantation or DLBCL which had relapsed or progressed after autologous stem cell transplantation were treated with ofatumumab [ADDRESS_543816] IV infusion, followed by [CONTACT_429789] 1000 mg. The ORR was  
11% (3 CR and 6 PR). In Study OMB110927, 61 subjects with relapsed or refractory CD20+ aggressive B -cell NHL who were transplant eligible were treated with  
ofatumumab + ICE (n=35) or ofatumumab + DHAP (n=26). Chemotherapy was dosed every 21 days for 3 cycles, while ofatumumab was dosed on Day 1 and Day 8 of Cycle 1, and on Day 1 of Cycles 2 and 3 (initial dose 300 mg, n=21; or 1000 mg, n=40; all subsequent doses 1000 mg).

Efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis 
As of 21 December 2011, efficacy results are available from 3 studies in subjects with 
RA: Study Hx -CD20 -403/OFA112657 Part A and Part B clinical study reports  
(completed Sept 2008) and follow -up period addenda (completed Dec 2010 and Jan  
2011, respectively); Study GEN410/OFA110635 (two interim clinical study reports for  
the double- blind and open- label periods, completed June 2010 and Dec 2011,  
respectively); Study GEN411/OFA110634 (one interim clinical study report for the  
double- blind period, completed August 2011).  
 In Study Hx -CD20 -403 Part A and B, all of the doses tested (300 mg, 700 mg and 1000 
mg) resulted in profound B -cell depletion and B -cell levels below normal range or  
baseline were sustained for approximately 20- 34 months. For the primary endpoint  
analysis (ACR20 response at 24 weeks) in Part B, all doses of ofatumumab were significantly better than placebo, with an ACR20 response being achieved by 40%  
(p<0.001), 49% (p<0.001), and 44% (p<0.001) of subjects in the 300 mg (n=58), 700 mg (n=57), and 1000 mg (n=54) ofatumumab groups, respectively, compared with 11% in  
the placebo group (n=55). For the 700 mg and 1000 mg groups, significantly better  
improvements in ACR20 and ACR50 response rates were maintained out to 48 weeks  
compared with placebo. Subgroup analyses for the subjects on background MTX  
(n=174) showed slightly higher response rates in this subject group.  
 Study GEN410/OFA110635, a double- blind, randomized, placebo- controlled trial of the  
efficacy of ofatumumab in RA patients with an inadequate response to MTX, completed  
its 24 -week double- blind period during the previous IB reporting period, and the  
open- label extension part was prematurely terminated by [CONTACT_429790]; the follow -up period is still ongoing. For  
the double- blind period, eligible subjects were randomized (1:1) to receive two  
intravenous infusions of either ofatumumab 700 mg or placebo two weeks apart (one  
course), in addition to background MTX treatment. In the intention- to-treat study  
population, comprising 260 patients, results demonstrated that a statistically significantly  
better ACR20 response at 24 weeks (primary  endpoint) of 50% (64/129; p<0.001) was  
achieved for patients receiving ofatumumab compared to 27% (35/131) in the placebo group. Efficacy appeared to be observed by 8 weeks and the response was sustained throughout the double- blind period. Statistically significant improvements in favour of  
ofatumumab were also observed for all other key secondary efficacy endpoints [(ACR50,  ACR70, ACRn, EULAR (European League Against Rheumatism) and Disease 
Activity  Score (DAS28)] [ Taylor , 2011]. All subjects who completed the 24- week double-
blind  period without receiving rescue disease -modifying anti -rheumatic drug (DMARD)  
treatment were eligible to proceed into the 120- week open- label period to receive repeat  
treatment courses with ofatumumab, which were given at individualized time intervals  
only if a clinical response had been achieved following the previous treatment course. As this study was prematurely terminated by [CONTACT_429791] 5, dated 28 October 2010, and subjects 
proceeded  to the ongoing Follow -up period at their next scheduled visit. An interim 
analysis of the open- label period was performed. No statistical analyses were

performed on data from  the open- label period; data were summarized per “treatment 
course” using appropriate descriptive statistics. The open- label population (subjects 
who received ofatumumab  during the open- label period) included 231 subjects. The 
mean (SD) for the minimum  DAS28 -ESR score (i.e. average lowest level of disease 
activity) wa s 4.01 (1.396) during  the first ofatumumab treatment course and ranged from 
3.34 (1.326) to 3.82 (1.588) for  treatment courses 2 to 6; the seventh treatment course 
only included 2 subjects. The mean (SD) for the minimum change from baseline in 
DAS28 -ESR sc ore (i.e. average greatest  change in disease activity) was -2.32 (1.192) 
for the first treatment course; a negative change represents an improvement in 
symptom s of disease. For subsequent treatment  courses the mean (SD) for the 
minimum change from baseline  in DAS28 -ESR score  ranged from -1.45 (0.845) to -1.77 
(1.015) except for the seventh treatment course which only included 2 subjects. Based 
on DAS28- ESR, 90 subjects (37%) achieved disease  remission (DAS28 score <2.6) 
and an additional 83 (34%) subjects had low disease  activity (DAS28 ≥2.6 and <3.2) at 
some time during the double- blind and/or open label  periods. When considered by 
[INVESTIGATOR_421277], the percentage of subjects achieving  disease remission ranged from 
16 to 42%, and the percentage of subjects with low  diseas e activity ranged from 9 to 
28% (except for the seventh treatment course which only included 2 subjects). Based 
on DAS28- CRP, 125 subjects (51%) achieved disease remission and an additional 88 
(36%) subjects had low disease activity at some time  during the double -blind and/or 
open label periods. When considered by [INVESTIGATOR_421277],  the percentage of subjects 
achieving disease remission ranged from 29 to 46%, and the percentage of subjects 
with low disease activity ranged from 13 to 18% (except for the seven th treatment 
course which only included 2 subjects). Therefore, during each treatment course there 
was an improvement in disease activity following ofatumumab treatment, in addition to 
background MTX. Disease remission or low disease activity was  achieved at some time 
during the double- blind and/or open label periods by 71% of  subjects based on DAS28-
ESR, and by 88% of subjects based on DAS28- CRP.  
 
Study GEN411/OFA110634, a double- blind, randomized, placebo- controlled trial of the  
efficacy of ofatumumab in RA subjects with an inadequate response to TNF -α 
antagonist  therapy, was prematurely terminated by [CONTACT_429792].  An interim analysis of the double- blind period has been completed. 
Because of premature termination only 169  subjects (out of 236) were randomized. This 
was an insufficient  number of subjects to achieve 90% power for the primary endpoint, 
and therefore no statistical testing was performed for the primary and secondary 
endpoints. Data were summarized using appropriate descriptive statistics. For the 
double- blind period, eligible subjects were randomized (1:1) to receive 2 infusions of 
either ofatumumab 700 mg or placebo 2 weeks apart (one treatment course), in addition to background MTX treatment. Ofatumumab, in addition to background MTX treatment, reduced the clinical signs and symptoms of RA in this population of patients with an inadequate response to TNF -α antagonist therapy, after a single treatment course of 2 
infusions separated by 2 weeks. Efficacy was sus tained throughout the double- blind 
period.

Efficacy in multiple sclerosis  
Study GEN414/OMS115102 has completed both the 48- week (with 24 week cross -
over),  double- blind, placebo controlled treatment phase and the individualized follow -up 
phase.  In the We ek 0 to 24 period the majority of subjects'CD19+ and CD20+ levels 
were suppressed to zero; recovery started for the 100 mg and 300 mg active/placebo 
groups after approximately 12 and 20 weeks, respectively. In the 700 mg active/placebo group, all but one subject had a persistent and complete CD19+ suppression at Week 24 In the Week 24 to 48 period the majority of the subjects' CD19+ and CD20+ levels were suppressed to zero (mm3) within one week in subjects who received active treatment after the treatment c ross-over phase. Recovery started for the subjects in the 
100 mg placebo/active group after approximately 16 weeks (from these subjects’ first infusion). In the 300 mg and 700 mg placebo/active groups, all subjects but one (700 mg) had persistent and complete CD19+ suppression at Week 48. Review of the raw summary statistics highlight the minimal amount of observed new MRI lesion activity following administration of IV ofatumumab in both the Week 0- 24 and Week 24- 48 
treatment periods. Statistical analyses s upported the observations from the raw data, 
showing statistically significant benefits in favour of ofatumumab; caution is needed in the interpretation of the analyses in this small dataset due to the extreme skew in the dataset collected and the assumptions made in the analyses. The observations were consistent in the majority of the exploratory endpoints (cumulative number of new T1 Gd-enhancing lesions, cumulative number of total T1 Gd- enhancing lesions and 
cumulative number of new and/or enlarging T2 l esions). The assessment of relapses 
did not show statistically significant differences in ofatumumab treatment from placebo.  Although this was primarily a safety and tolerability trial, it also aimed to confirm CD20+ depletion and to obtain preliminary evidence of efficacious effect on MRI and clinical endpoints. The data demonstrated that ofatumumab induced a disease activity response and, as expected, ofatumumab caused profound and selective CD20+ 
reductions.  Overall, the efficacy endpoints indicated that ofatumumab is potentially 
effective in  RRMS patients.  
 
Summary of trial rationale  
Chronic  GVHD is a major source of morbidity, mortality, and impaired quality of life after 
HCT. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_429747], the majority of patients will develop chronic GVHD. The currently accepted 
primary therapy of chronic GVHD, namely 1mg/kg or greater of prednisone or equivalent, is ineffective, and available immune suppressive agents have limited activity in those who fail primary therapy. These all speak to the need for more effective primary therapy for chronic GVHD. Based on compelling clinical and basic insights into chronic GVHD biology, anti -CD20 based therapy has great potential to improve the success of 
chronic GVHD therapy. Thus, we propose  a phase I -II study of combined ofatumumab 
and standard glucocorticoids to study the safety and efficacy of this approach.

II. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
Primary Objectives:  
1. Phase I: Determine the safety of ofatumumab in combination with steroids in the 
primary therapy of chronic GVHD  
2. Phase II: Determine overall response rate (CR+PR) at 6 months to ofatumumab 
and glucocorticoid primary therapy of chronic GVHD . 
 
Secondary Objectives:  
1. Determine 6 month complete response rate to ofatumumab and steroids in the primary therapy of chronic GVHD . 
2. Examine cumulative incidence of non-relapse  mortality and primary disease 
relapse, and es timate overall survival from time of therapy . 
3. Report utilization of second- line immune suppressive therapi [INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
4. Examine  incidence of complete discontinuation of  immune suppressive therapy . 
5. Determine failure- free survival (composite outcome of death, relapse  and 
requirement for secondary immune suppressive agents)  and treatment success 
(composite outcome defined as complete resolution of all reversible chronic GVHD manifestations, discontinuation of all systemic immune suppressive agents, and freedom from death or primary malignancy relapse) . 
6. Evaluate serial measures of patient -reported outcomes following therapy, 
including functional ability, symptom burden, and quality of life . 
7. Perform allied biologic studies for total B cells, B cell subsets, immune globulin 
levels, BAFF levels, and examine association between these biologic endpoints and clinical response to primary therapy . 
 
III. STUDY DESIGN AND ENROLLMENT CRITERIA  
Summary of Trial design This is a phase I -II trial to examine the safety and efficacy of prednisone and escalating 
dose of ofatumumab for the primary therapy of chronic GVHD. Prednisone will uniformly 
be initiated at 1 mg/kg/day, and the phase I component will test an escalating dose of 
ofatumumab at cohorts of 300mg, 700mg, and 1000mg given on day 0 and 14 of study. 
In the phase II component, patients will be followed for total of 24  months  (including 
study therapy day 0 and day 14, and then months 1, 3, 6, 12 after therapy, then at 18 and 24 months following therapy), and the primary efficacy endpoint of overall response 
to therapy will be determined at 6 months following initiation of therapy. Additional secondary endpoints and biologic correlative studies will be performed at the indicated time points.

IV. STUDY THERAPY  
i. Prednisone therapy  
Starting dose of prednisone will be 1mg/kg body weigh t per day. If patients are treated 
with a lternative steroid agents (e.g. methylprednisolone), this should be dosed to the 
corresponding prednisone equivalent  of 1 mg/kg actual body weight .  
The s pecific duration of prednisone therapy and tapering schedule for prednisone is not 
dictated by [CONTACT_3181] . However, the following serves as a guide for management of 
prednisone and other immune suppressive agents : 
1. Start prednisone at 1 mg/kg/day  
2. Continue this dose for 2- 4 weeks or longer as needed in the setting  of ongoing 
clinical improvement in chronic GVHD manifestations  
3. With stable or improving chronic GVHD manifestations, begin taper on an every 
1-2 week schedule with a target of reaching 0.5mg/kg/day  
4. Continue 0.5mg/kg/day for 4 week plateau  
5. Then taper by 10- 20% of total dose per month as tolerated  
6. In setting of increase chronic GVHD activity upon taper, increase prednisone dose as needed, with upper limit of 1- 2mg/kg/day  
7. Following complete discontinuation of prednisone, begin taper of other immune suppress ive agents as tolerated.

 Ofatumumab Infusion Set  up 
Ofatumumab must be administered by i.v. infusion through an in- line filter and through a 
well-functioning i.v. catheter (i.v. cannula) into a vein in the arm (or other venous 
access) by [CONTACT_248276].   
Please Note:   It is mandatory to use an in -line low protein binding 0.[ADDRESS_543827].  
 DO NOT ADMINISTER AS AN INTRAVENOUS PUSH OR BOLUS.  
 Ofatumumab should not be mixed with any other medication.  If ofatumumab is to 
be dosed through an in-dwelling catheter, then, any previous medication should 
be removed by [CONTACT_248277].  
Please note that the infusion site can be used for blood sampling only if there is no risk of contamination of the infusion needle with the saline, infusion solutions, or any other fluid(s).  Only a newly inserted needle can be used for the predose blood samples.   
• Check subject ID against the label on the infusion bag and ensure the expi[INVESTIGATOR_248213]. The solution must  be administered in its entirety to the subject within 
24 hours from time of preparation.   
• Attach the 1000mL infusion bag to the infusion set (if not done at the pharmacy).  
• Attach the in -line filter to the infusion set (closest to the subject; see schemat ic 
below ). Note
: The in- line filter must be used during the entire infusion.  
• Prime the infusion set and filter with ofatumumab (if not done at the pharmacy).  
• In case of a problem with the filter (i.e. clogging/blockage), please change, re-prime the new filter, and continue the infusion.  
 
Version 7.0 
Version Date: 3.10.2016  28 
• In case of problem with infusion set, follow local procedures.  
• Collect the pre- dose blood samples, if required.  
• Check the backflow from the i.v. cannula according to routine practice at site  
• Set the pump at the initial infus ion rate 12mL/hr for the first infusion and 25mL/hr 
for the subsequent infusions (see below infusion guidelines )

 V. STUDY OUTCOMES/ANALY SIS ENDPOINTS 
1. Safety 
a. 
Definition of DLT  for phase I component:  
i. In the phase I study, dose escalation will proceed as previously 
described. The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be defined using 
CTCAE version 4.0 as the following:  
- Events occurring within [ADDRESS_543829] dose of drug (4 half -
lives) that are:  
a) Grade 4 infusion reactions,  
b) Grade [ADDRESS_543830] possibly due to ofatumumab,  
c) Grade 3 organ toxicities (neurologic, pulmonary, cardiac, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, hepatic, cutaneous) at least possibly due to ofatumumab,  
d) Grade [ADDRESS_543831] into the phase II component of the trial as the recommended phase II dose.  
v. Events clearly related to chronic GVHD, relapse of the primary 
hematological disorder, concurrent medication, or infection will not 
be included as a DLT.  
vi. Plan for patients not able to be evaluated for outcome on phase I component:  
1. If an enrolled patient dies or comes off study following occurrence of DLT as defined above, this data will inform the 
 
Version 7.0 
Version Date: 3.10.[ADDRESS_543832] 
such patients.  
2. Rather, if an enrolled patient does not experience DLT during follow up, but decides to withdraw from the study for other non- DLT related reasons prior to the minimum follow 
up of 46 days, such a patient would be replaced by a newly accrued patient.  
 
2.  Efficacy  
a. 
Overall response rate  
i. Overall response rate (ORR)  at 6 months following initiation of 
therapy represents the composite outcome of complete and partial response (CR + PR).  
ii. Complete response is defined as resolution of all reversible manifestations in each organ or site of chronic GVHD involvement  
iii. Partial response is defined as improvement in at least one organ or site without progression in any other organ or site  
b. 
Complete response rate 
i. Complete response (CR) at 6 months following initiation of therapy requires complete resolution of all chronic GVHD manifestations in all affected organs.  
c. 
Cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality and primary malignancy relapse  
i. The cumulative incidence of non- relapse mortality (defined as 
death in the absence of primary malignancy relapse after transplant) and relapse (defined by [CONTACT_429798], but not limited to morphologic, immunophenotypic, or molecular methods) will be estimated from time of study therapy initiation. These are treated as competing -risk 
events. 
d. 
Overall survival  
i. Overall survival will be determined from date of study therapy initiation, with death from  any cause as the event of interest, and 
censoring at last follow up date for those with incomplete observations.  
e. 
Utilization of second- line systemic immune suppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
i. The use of second- line systemic immune suppressive agents will 
be captured at  each study visit.  
ii. This specifically refers to systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_19081], not topi[INVESTIGATOR_429753], such as topi[INVESTIGATOR_211652], mouth rinses, topi[INVESTIGATOR_429754], or topi[INVESTIGATOR_429755].  
 
Version 7.0 
Version Date: 3.10.2016  31 
iii. Adjustment in prednisone dose according to dis ease manifestations 
is not considered second- line therapy  
iv. Adjustment in the dose of existing immune suppressive agents that 
require dose modification to maintain therapeutic serum drug levels (e.g. tacrolimus, cyclosporine, sirolimus) is not considered a second- line therapy or change in therapy  
v. New initiation of extra- corporeal photopheresis (ECP) for 
progressive chronic GVHD manifestations following study intervention of prednisone and ofatumumab is considered second-line therapy.  
f. 
Discontinuation of all sy stemic immune suppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  
i. The incidence of complete discontinuation of all systemic immune suppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_429756].  
g. 
Failure -free survival  
i. This time -to-event outcome will be estimated with the composite 
event of death from any cause , relapse and addition of secondary 
immune suppressive agents  for progressive chronic GVHD . 
h. Treatment success  
i. This endpoint will be estimated with a composite outcome of complete resolution of all reversible chronic GVHD manifestations, discontinuation of all systemic immune suppressive agents, and 
freedom from death or primary malignancy relapse after transplant.  
i. 
Patient -reported outcomes  and functional measures  
i. Patients will provide assessment of their functional ability  (grip 
strength, [ADDRESS_543833]), symptom burden (Lee symptom 
scale) , and quality of life using validated instruments recommended 
by [CONTACT_429799] D 
(Lee Chronic GVHD Symptom S cale,[ADDRESS_543834] -BMT44) 
ii. These dat a will be collected at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months on 
study 
 
j. Biologic studies  
 
Peripheral blood samples will be obtained from study patients at baseline, and then 3, 6, 
and 12 months. From these peripheral blood samples, the following major analyses will be performed: (1) quantification of plasma B cell stimulatory factor (BAFF), (2) quantification of immune globulin levels, and (3) enumeration of total B cells, as well as characterization of B cell subsets by [CONTACT_429800].  
 
Version 7.0 
Version Date: 3.10.2016  32 
From whole blood samples, plasma will be separated, and utilized for determination of 
soluble BAFF levels by [CONTACT_28745]- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). From peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), B cells will be isolated. Antibodies targeting surface antigens CD19, CD20, CD38, CD27, and IgD will be utilized for staining, and the respective cell subsets will be characterized by [CONTACT_429801]: Naïve B cells (IgD
+CD38LowCD27-), transitional B cells (IgD+CD38HighCD27-), 
IgD+ memory B cells (IgD+CD38LowCD27+), pre -germinal center B cells

a. Phase I (those patients in dose levels that are not the MTD to be carried 
forward into the p hase II component)  
i. patients will complete [ADDRESS_543836] dose of ofatumumab to monitor for DLT  
ii. for those not in the MTD cohort, limited data will be collected at 6 and 12 months (clinical response, pharmacodynamics)  
b. Phase II (including patients who are carried forward from the phase I component) – patients will complete [ADDRESS_543837] all of the ongoing assessments performed

subsets, BAFF levels) at 6 and 12 month time points. These limited 
assessments for the non- MTD dose level patients will be included to 
examine the relationship between dose and clinical response, and dose/pharmacodynamic activity.  
 
 VI. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : 
Study design and sample size estimation:   
In the phase I component, dose escalation procedure is modeled after the data reported 
for ofatumumab in treatmen t of rheumatoid arthritis. Here, doses of 300, 700, and 
1000mg were delivered on days 0 and 14. As this dose/schedule was well tolerated, led to significant and sustained (up to 48 weeks) depletion of peripheral blood CD19+ B cells, and there was an association between escalating dose and clinical response (appendix A
), this dose/schedule will be adapt ed to a phase I design in the primary 
treatment of chronic GVHD.  
The study design of the phase I component represents a traditional (3+3) dose 
escalation design with the following cohorts of ofatumumab in combination with 1mg/kg/day prednisone therapy:  
      (cohort -1): 100mg days 0 and 14  
cohort 1: 300mg days 0 and 14  
cohort 2: 700mg days 0 and 14  
cohort 3: 1000mg days 0 and 14  
*cohort/dose level -1 (100mg days 0 and 14) will be pursued only
 if 2/3 patients in 
cohort 1 (300mg days 0 and 14) experience DLT.  
 
Phase I trial endpoint:  
Safety of escalating dose of ofatumumab in combination with prednisone.  
 
Definition of dose- limiting toxicity (DLT):  
Dose -limiting toxicity attributable to ofatumumab within 46 days of initiation of 
ofatumumab therapy  is defined in the  above section V.1 safety for definition of DLT . The 
occurrence of DLT attributable to ofatumumab in ≤ 17% serves as the boundary for the 
maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of ofatumumab.  
 
Phase I trial procedures and analysis:  
The initial group of 3 patients will be enrolled in the cohort 1. Dose escalation of ofatumumab will proceed according to the following: If no DLT is observed among [ADDRESS_543838] dose level. If the current level (i.e., the level at which no DLTs are observed) is the highest dose 
 
Version 7.0 
Version Date: 3.10.2016  35 
level, three additional patients will be enrolled  (total of six) . If one DLT is observed 
among 3 patients in a cohort, the next group of 3 will be treated at this same dose level. 
If no more DLT is observed among the 3 additional patients (i.e. one DLT in total is  
observed among the 6 patients), then the next [ADDRESS_543839] 1 of 6 patients has a DLT. That dose will be considered to be the MTD. If two DLTs are observed among 3 (or fewer) patients in a cohort, the next group of [ADDRESS_543840] dose level. If the current level (i.e.  the level at which 2 DLTs are 
observed) is the lowest dose level  (300mg days 0 and 14), then a dose level -1 will be 
pursued, in which a de -escalated dose of 100mg ofatumumab will be given on days 0 
and 14.   
The total number treated on the phase I component w ill depend on the occurrence of 
dose limiting toxicity (DLT), however the maximal number accrued on the phase I study would approximate [ADDRESS_543841] with the phase II component . 
 
Phase II component:  
Following definition of the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) in the phase I component, this MTD w ill be taken forward in a phase II trial to characterize the efficacy of this 
approach. The primary endpoint of interest in the phase II component is overall 
response rate (ORR) to therapy  at 6 months . Overall response is defined as the 
composite of complete response and partial respons e. In the assessment of response 
for this primary endpoint, response will be determined according to clinician assessment. The Simon’s two -stage optimum design is used to minimize the expected 
sample size. With a histori cal baseline ORR proportion of 60% ( justification for this 
baseline proportion in background section) , antici pated effect leading to ORR of 80% in 
this investigational treatment ( prednisone + ofatumumab), power of 90%, and alpha of 
0.1, a total of [ADDRESS_543842] been treated at the recommended phase II dose, these will be included for efficacy analysis. Early termination will occur if 6 or fewer out of 11 (≤6/11) subjects in first stage have a over all response ( CR or PR) . If the trial goes 
on the second stage and a total number of responders (CR or PR) is less than or equal to 26 (≤26/38), the null hypothesis fails to be rejected. To provide total of 38 subjects for 
this efficacy analysis, 32 additi onal patients will be enrolled in the phase II component.  
Thus, the net total number of patients to be enrolled on the combined phase I -II study 
will be a maximum of 5 0.  
 
Statistical Analysis plan:  
The ‘All Treated population’ will be used for the analys is of the efficacy and safety 
endpoints. Specifically, this  will consist of all patients who receive at least one dose of 
study treatment. For Complete Response (CR) rate and Overall Response rate:  A 
 
Version 7.0 
Version Date: 3.10.2016  36 
patient with unknown or missing response will be treated as a non- respon der (i.e. the 
patient will be included in the denominator when calculating the percentage).  
Overall response ( ORR) rate will be determined at 6 months and will be reported with 
associated 95% confidence interval. Complete response rate will be similarly reported. 
Association between clinical variables (chronic GVHD severity, organ involvement, 
patient socio- demographic data, disease and transplantation variables) and response 
will be examined. Patient reported outcomes will be reported, and  association between 
scores on individual measures (chronic GVHD symptom scale, human activity profile, QOL instruments including SF -[ADDRESS_543843] -BMT) and clinical response to therapy will 
be explored. Cumulative incidence of relapse and non- relapse mortali ty will be 
estimated, accounting for competing risk events. Overall survival from date of therapy initiation will be estimated by [CONTACT_5263]- Meier method, and survival curves among relevant 
subgroups will be compared utilizing the log -rank test. In the analysi s of survival time 
between responders and non- responders, landmark analysis will be utilized to avoid 
biased survival estimation. Other time -to-event secondary endpoints (e.g. failure- free 
survival) will similarly be estimated using the Kaplan- Meier method. Biologic endpoints 
(total B cell numbers, B cell subsets, immune globulin levels, BAFF levels) will be 
summarized. Comparisons between relevant groups will be made at specific time points utilizing parametric (e.g. t -test) or n on-parametric (e.g. W ilcoxo n rank -sum) as 
appropriate per the nature of the data. Additionally, change in these values over time will be examined according to response vs. non- response to primary therapy with 
mixed -model approach.  
 
Early Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_429757] 
(i.e. grade 4 AE attributable to ofatumumab per the above definitions) for the 38 patients  
in a Phase II component. The DLT is defined in Section V.1. Safety. The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_429758] a Pocock -type boundary as 
described in “Continuous Toxicity Monitoring in Phase II Trials in Oncology” by [CONTACT_429802], Qaqish, and Schell (Biometrics, 2005; 61(2):540- 45). Table below shows the number of 
DLTs allowed f or a given number of “assessable” patients up to that point. Patients are 
considered to be “assessable” when they have either experienced a DLT or completed the surveillance period (death without a DLT or 30 days after infusion of Ofatumumab) without having experienced a DLT so that their outcomes are identifiable. Up to 20% of DLT rate is expected or acceptable. The table below contains the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_128109], based on which the probability of early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_429759] 0.05 if the DLT rate is  equal to 6.5%. Given the first 6 patients on the phase II component were treated 
on the phase I component of the trial (and assessed for DLT in the phase I component), the starting number of sequentially enrolled patients for assessment of this toxicity stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_429760] (see below table). When the DLT rate is unacceptably high ( 30%), the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_429761] 97% probability of early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. If a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_429762], the accrual will be halted, and the data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_429803].

 Definition of Adverse Events:  
 
Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  Events meeting the definition of an AE include:  
 
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) 
or other safety assessments e.g., ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, and felt to be clinically significant in the medial and scientific judgment of the investigator  
• Exacerbation of a chro nic or intermittent pre- existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational product administration even though it may have been present prior to the start  of the study  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either investigational product or a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be reported as an A E/SAE)  
 
“Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” per se will not be 
reported as an AE or SAE. However, the signs and symptoms and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE.  
  Events that do not  meet the definition of an AE include:  
 
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal safety 
assessments that is associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_1173]’s condition.  
• The disease/disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the subject’s condition  
• Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that leads to the procedure is an AE  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307])  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre- existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen 
• B cell depletion and hypogammaglobulinemia due to ofatumumab treatment  
 
Version 7.0 
Version Date: 3.10.2016  39 
 
Definition of Severe Adverse Events (SAE):  
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
 
a. Results in death  
b. Is life -threatening  
NOTE:  The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
 
c. Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12331]:  In general, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5184] (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_22771]/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or out -patient setting.  Complications that occur during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084].  If a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the event is serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre- existing condition that did not worsen 
from baseline is not considered an AE.  
An overnight hospi[INVESTIGATOR_376770] a Serious Adverse Event.  
 
d. Results in disability/incapacity, or  
NOTE:  The term disability means a substantial disruption of  a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
 
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 
f. Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate in other  situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_299444].  These should also be considered serious.  Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood 
 
Version 7.0 
Version Date: 3.10.2016  40 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse.  
g.  Laboratory and Other Safety Assessment Abnormalities Reported as AEs and SAEs  
• A bnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments  (e.g., ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, and felt to be clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator are 
to be recorded as AEs or SAEs.  
 
• All events meeting liver stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_248232].  
 
• However, any clinically significant safety assessments that are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_1173]’s condition, are not to be reported as AEs or SAEs.  
 
• B cell depletion, IgG below LLN, low CD19+ count, and hypogammaglobulinemia due to treatment with ofatumumab are not to be reported as AEs or SAEs.  
 
• Infusion related AEs may lead to a prolonged infusion time. Overnight stay at the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_248233] a SAE.  
 
 Disease- Related Events and/or Disease- Related Outcomes Not Qualifying as 
SAEs 
An event which is part of the natural course of the disease under study (i.e., disease progression) does not need to be reported as an SAE.  However, if the progression of the underlying disease is greater than that which would normally be expected for the subject, or if the investigator considers that there was a causal relationship between treatment  with investigational product or protocol design/procedures and the disease 
progression, then this must be reported as an SAE.  
 
Severity scoring and attribution of a dverse events:  
As far as possible, each adverse event should be evaluated to determine:  
1.      the severity grade (mild, moderate, severe) or (grade 1- 4) 
2.      its relationship to the study drug(s) (suspected/not suspected)  
3.      its duration (start and end dates or if continuing at final exam)  
4.      action taken (no action taken; study drug dosage adjusted/temporarily interrupted; 
study drug permanently discontinued due to this adverse event; concomitant medication 
taken; non- drug therapy given; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059])  
5.      whether it constitutes a serious adverse ev ent (SAE)  
 
 
Version 7.0 
Version Date: 3.10.2016  41 
All adverse events should be treated appropriately. Such treatment may include 
changes in study drug treatment including possible interruption or discontinuation, starting or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_058], changes in the frequency or nature of  
assessments, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or any other medically required intervention. Once an adverse event is detected, it should be followed until its resolution, and assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to treat 
it, and the outcome.  
 
Collection of adverse events – study calendar driven collection schedule:  
-  All grades (1- 5) adverse events will be collected within [ADDRESS_543844] : 
 
i. Chronic GVHD disease activity  – adverse consequences of 
chronic GVHD activity itself will not be considered as adverse 
events. These are described in appendix B . 
ii. Renal or hepatic impairment  related to post -transplant 
medications or complications – Renal or hepatic impairment 
temporally associated with known transplant -related insults will not 
be considered adverse events attributable to ofatumumab. 
Common examples include worsening in renal function associated with calcineurin inhibitors, volum e depletion, or end- organ 
complications from thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA).  
iii. Electrolyte abnormalities related to post -transplant medications – 
Abnormalities in electrolytes including sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, and phosphorus are commonly obs erved 
following transplant, and are managed with supplementation. All grade electrolyte abnormalities are not considered adverse events attributable to ofatumumab.  
iv. Infectious complications  following transplant – Infectious 
complications are frequent after transplant. Anticipated frequencies of infectious complications are listed in the table below (3.g.iii). 
 
Version 7.0 
Version Date: 3.10.2016  42 
Bacterial, viral, fungal infections are anticipated, as well as 
pneumocystis jiroveci (PCP), and reactivation of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Ebstein Barr  virus (EBV). The frequency of infectious 
complications will be monitored during the study, and will be compared to historical rates. However, these will not be considered adverse events.  
The following table serves as a current best estimate of incidence of infectious complications following systemic therapy for chronic 
GVHD (reproduced from Martin, et al. Blood. 2009).
[ADDRESS_543845] 
anti-microbial prophylaxis was delivered on this trial according to 
institutional guidelines.  
 
 
v. C
ytopenias ( 
 
v. leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia  – the listed cytopenias 
are common following transplant, and often the result of transplant medications, or TMA. All grades of hematologic events related to complications of transplant and associated transplant medications are not reportable as adverse events attributable to ofatumumab.   
vi. Hyperglycemia – This is a common occurrence in the setting of 
steroid therapy for GVHD, and is controlled with insulin or other medications. Therefore, this  will not be reported as an adverse 
event attributable to ofatumumab.  
vii. Relapse of primary hematologic malignancy  – relapse of 
malignancy is an established risk after transplant, and therefore will not be considered an adverse event attributable to ofatumumab.  
 
Specific criteria for hepatic function monitoring, pregnancy, hepatitis B 
screening, and monitoring for PML:  
a. Liver monitoring:  Liver chemistries will be obtained pre- treatment, as specified 
below for treatment phase and at least [ADDRESS_543846]  dose of  Prednisone+MMF  Prednisone+placebo  p value  
Any infection  74% 87% 0.05 
Bacterial infection  24% 21% 0.6 
Viral infection  36% 35% 0.86 
Fungal infection  24% 31% 0.35 
Pneumonia  23% 13% 0.11 
Conjunctivitis  5% 14% 0.07 
Empi[INVESTIGATOR_429767]  31% 18% 0.06 
 
Version 7.0 
Version Date: 3.10.[ADDRESS_543847] at each study v isit. 
Patients with elevated liver function tests due to chronic GVHD are 
eligible. Grade 4 hepatic toxicity attributable to ofatumumab will inform the determination of dose- limiting toxicity in the phase I component of the study. In the 
phase II component, ongoing monitoring of AEs will capture any grade 4 hepatic toxicity attributable to ofatumumab, and review of these AEs will ensure patient safety.  
 
Liver interruption/stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418]:   
 - Liver chemistry stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_429768]. The sponsor -investigator is to review all 
events which meet liver chemistry stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_429769]:  
 
• tumor lysis  (this is not likely in this study, as relapse  of primary malignancy is an 
exclusion criterion), disease related liver involvement, or 
specifically hepatic 
chronic GVHD  
• concomitant chemotherapy (or other medications ) 
• other identified cause and to exclude drug induced liver injury (DILI) due to 
Ofatumu mab 
These criteria are relevant for Ofatumumab studies because transient elevations in LFTs may be due to disease related liver involvement (
particularly hepatic chronic 
GVHD in this study)  or due to other chemotherapy (or other medication insults) rather 
than drug induced liver injury from Ofatumumab.  
If the event is determined to be due to causes other than Ofatumumab DILI and improvement is observed after withdrawal of Ofatumumab, rechallenge may be attempted if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_456] -investig ator and in addition to consent 
of the subject.  
 
Oncology Ofatumumab Protocols Liver Interruption/Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2121]:  
 
1. ALT >3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) and
 bilirubin >[ADDRESS_543848] (>35% 
direct bilirubin; bilirubin fractionation required‡)  
2. ALT >[ADDRESS_543849]  
3. ALT >[ADDRESS_543850] for more than 2 weeks  
 
‡ NOTE:   If serum bilirubin fractionation not immediately available, study drug should be 
discontinued if ALT > 3xULN and bilirubin >2xULN.  Serum bilirubin fractionation should 
be performed if testing is available. If testing unavailable, record presence of detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick, indicating direct bilirubin elevations and suggesting liver injury . 
 
Version 7.0 
Version Date: 3.10.2016  44 
 
***NOTE: These criteria hold true for patients without LFT abnormalities before 
initiation of therapy for chronic GVHD. Thus, in these cases, new development of 
LFT abnormalities following administration of the study drug would necessarily 
prompt this evaluation. However, for patients with established LFT abnormalities 
due to chronic GVHD before initiation of study therapy, these rules will be based 
on progression of LFT abnormalities beyond these thresholds based on the pre -
therapy starting point.  
 
When any of the liver chemistry stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_24300], do the following:  
 
Immediately stop study treatment  
Hold Ofatumumab for two weeks, repeat liver chemistry testing at least twice 
weekly, and report to sponsor -investigator to discuss the possibility of re -
challenging with Ofatumumab .  Medication is interrupted and it is a clinical and 
patient decision if Ofatumumab may be re- started.   
 
Report SAE to [COMPANY_001] within 24 hours  
All events of ALT > 3xULN and bilirubin > 2xULN (>35% direct bilirubin) (or 
ALT>3xULN and INR>1.5, if INR measured; INR measurement is not required and the threshold value stated will not apply to subjects receiving anticoagulants), termed ‘Hy’s Law’, must be reported as an SAE  
(excluding studies of hepatic impairment or cirrhosis) . 
NOTE: if serum bilirubin fractionation is not immediately available, study 
treatment should be di scontinued if ALT > 3xULN and bilirubin > 2xULN. 
Serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is available. If testing is unavailable, record presence of detectable urinary bilirubin on 
dipstick , indicating direct bilirubin elevations and suggesting liver injury.  
 
Liver chemistry follow -up assessments are to be followed until liver chemistries resolve, 
stabilize or return to baseline values.  
Liver Chemistry Follow -up Assessments; (these chemistry tests/ assessments below 
are to be performed at the time of the event and then continued and/or discontinued at 
the discretion/judgment of the sponsor -investigator; please refer to stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_429770])  
 Viral hepatitis serology including:  
• Hepatitis A IgM antibody;  
• Hepatitis B  surface antigen and Hepatitis B Core Antibody (IgM);  
• Hepatitis C RNA;  
• Cytomegalovirus IgM antibody;   
 
Version 7.0 
Version Date: 3.10.2016  45 
• Epstein- Barr viral capsid antigen IgM antibody (or if unavailable, obtain 
heterophile antibody or monospot testing);   
• Hepatitis E IgM antibody  
Serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)  
Fractionate bilirubin, if total bilirubin >2xULN  
Obtain complete blood count with differential to assess eosinophilia 
Record the  appearance or worsening clinical symptoms of hepatitis, or 
hypers ensitivity, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, 
jaundice, fever, or rash  
Record use of concomitant medications, acetaminophen, herbal remedies, other 
over the counter medications, or putative hepatotoxins  
Increased  alcohol use  
The following assessments are required for subjects with ALT >3xULN and bilirubin 
>2xULN (.35% direct) but are optional for other abnormal liver chemistries:  
• Anti-nuclear antibody, anti -smooth muscle antibody, and Type 1 anti -liver 
kidney microsomal anti bodies  
• Liver imaging (ultrasound, magnetic resonance, or computerized tomography) to evaluate liver disease.  
 
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_2121]:  
• For subject meeting liver stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418] 1:  
o A repeat of  liver chemistries within [ADDRESS_543851] or hepatology consultation is recommended  
o Monitor subjects twice weekly until liver chemistries (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin) resolve, stabilize or return to within baseline values.  
• For subjects meeting criteria 2 or 3:  
o A repeat of  liver chemistries within 24 to 72 hours for repeat liver chemistries and liver event follow -up assessments  
o Monitor subjects weekly until liver chemistries (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin) resolve, stabilize or return to within baseline values  
• After holding Ofatumumab for two weeks:  
o If the treatment is exhibiting efficacy and the subject wants to continue 
therapy after being informed of the results of liver chemistry testing, then the Ofatumumab may be re- started.  
o Liver chemistries and follow -up assessments should be monitored at a 
minimum of every 2 weeks until resolution, stabilization, or a return to 
 
Version 7.0 
Version Date: 3.10.2016  46 
baseline values, at which point monitoring should be continued per 
protocol  
• Subjects with ALT >3xULN but <5xULN and bilirubin <2xULN without hepatitis 
symptoms or rash, and who may be monitored weekly for at least 4 weeks, then the following actions should be taken:  
o Subjects can continue Ofatumumab  
o Weekly repeat of liver chemistries until they resolve, stabilize, or return to baseline values, then monitor liver chemistries as per protocol assessment schedule  
If at any time the subject meets any of the liver chemistry stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418], then proceed as described above  
If after 4 weeks of monitoring, ALT<3xULN and bilirubin<2xULN monitor twice monthly until liver chemistries normalize or return to within baseline values  
 
b. Pregnancies:   Pregnancies must be reported to [COMPANY_001] ; however are not to be 
reported as SAEs unless they meet serious criteria.  
 
2. Special safety monitoring requirements on study:  
 
a. Hepatitis B Screenin g  
 
Follow -up monitoring must be included in the study protocol:  
• If HBV DNA is negative, subject may be included  
• Monitoring during the follow -up period will be performed during routine study 
visits for a  minimum follow -up period of six months after the last dose, as long as the 
subject remains on study. Monitoring frequency during follow -up should occur at a 
minimum of every 3 months.  Whenever possible, the monitoring should occur as part of 
the routine follow -up visit  
• Prophylactic antiviral therapy, in addition to the monitoring described above, may 
be initiated at the discretion of the investigator.  
 
HBsAg positive (regardless of other Hepatitis B serologies):  
• exclude  
 HBsAg negative, HBcAb negative, HBsAb positive  
• include  
 
HBsAg negative, HBcAb positive (regardless of HBsAb status)  
HBV DNA must be performed  
• if HBV DNA  is positive  the subject is excluded  
 
Version 7.0 
Version Date: 3.10.2016  47 
• If HBV DNA is negative, subject may be included but must undergo at least every 
2 month HBV DNA PCR testing from the start of treatment during the treatment course.  
• Monitoring during the on treatment periods is required at least every [ADDRESS_543852] dose. 
• Prophylactic antiviral therapy, in addition to the monitoring described above, may 
be initiated at the discretion of the investigator.  
 If the subjects’ HBV DNA becomes positive during the study, the investigator should manage the clinical situation as per the standard of care of that institution, and the [COMPANY_001] medical monitor should be notified. The risks and benefits of continuing 
ofatumumab or discontinuing ofatumumab should be discussed with the medical monitor before appropriate treatment decisions are made for that individual subject.  
  
b. Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)  
 Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a viral -induced demyelinating 
disease of the central nervous system usually occurring in the immunocompromised individual. JC virus infection resulting in PML and death has been reported in 
rituximab -treated subjects with hematologic malignancies or with systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE), an indication for which rituximab has not been approved. In the 
literature, PML has been reported  to occur in 0.52% of CLL subjects and in 
approximately 5% of fludarabine- treated B -CLL subjects. One case of PML was 
reported in a very ill CLL subject treated with ofatumumab, previously treated with alemtuzumab and fludarabine and with very low CD4 cell  count.  
1. Investigators and nurses should pay careful attention for signs and symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of PML. Signs and symptoms of PML include visual disturbances, ocular movements, ataxia, and changes in mental status such as disorientation or  confusion.  These symptoms are not an exhaustive list and the 
investigator should exercise judgment in deciding to report signs and symptoms to sponsor promptly.  
 
2. If a subject develops neurological signs or symptoms consistent with PML treatment should be halted and the subject referred to a neurologist for 
evaluation.  At a minimum, blood JCV PCR and/or MRI will be performed and if either is positive perform Cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_17106] (CSF) JCV PCR. If blood JCV PCR and MRI are negative, the investigator will contact [CONTACT_429807]. If blood JCV PCR and/or MRI are positive, the subject should proceed to the Follow -Up Period. All such subjects will be followed until 
resolution.  Any subject with a diagnosis of PML will be withdrawn from 
ofatumumab.  There are no known tests that can reliably determine who is at 
increased risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_156299]. There are no known interventions that can reliably prevent PML or adequately treat PML if it occurs.

difficulty comprehen ding spoken language:    
7. Does the subject have any other new 
neurological symptoms, including but not 
limited to: 
New onset seizure 
New sensory loss  
New emotional liability    
 
*If neurologic symptoms are otherwise explained by a competing etiology, the clinician should 
indicate ‘no’ on the above checklist, and urgent contact [CONTACT_429808]. 
As stated above, the study investigator should exercise judgment in deciding to report signs and 
symptoms.  
 If any of the above are answered “Yes” at any visit, the investigator will contact [CONTACT_429809] a neurologist.

 SAE Reporting Procedures:  
The study PI [INVESTIGATOR_429771]: 
 
NOVARTIS :  
Once an investigator determines that an event meets the protocol definition of an SAE, 
the SAE will be reported to [COMPANY_001] within [ADDRESS_543853] consents to participate in and completes the study all SAEs assessed as related  to study participation (e.g., protocol -mandated 
procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therapy) or related to [COMPANY_001] 
concomitant medication, will be reported promptly to [COMPANY_001] . 
 Any SAE brought to the investigator’s attention after the subject has completed the study and considered by [CONTACT_429811] . 
 Pregnancy  
Any pregnancy that occurs during study participation must be reported to [COMPANY_001] .   To 
ensure subject safety, each pregnancy must be reported to [COMPANY_001]  within [ADDRESS_543854] be followed up to determine outcome (including premature termination) and status of mother and child.  Pregnancy complications and elective terminations for medical reasons must be reported as an AE or SAE.  Spontaneous abortions must be reported as an SAE.  Any SAE occurring in 
association with a pregnancy, brought to the investigator’s attention after the subject has completed the study and considered by [CONTACT_248292], must be promptly reported to [COMPANY_001] . In addition, the 
investigator must attempt to collect pregnancy information on any female partners of male study subjects who become pregnant while the subjec t is enrolled in the study. 
Pregnancy information must be reported to [COMPANY_001]  as described above.  
All SAEs will be reported to [COMPANY_001] within [ADDRESS_543855] information for this reporting:

University of South [LOCATION_012] IRB:  
  
Unanticipated problems that are serious adverse events should be reported to the IRB 
immediately of the investigator becoming aware of the event.  
 Any other unanticipated problem involving risks to subjects or others should be reported to the IRB immediately of the investigator becoming aware of the problem.  
 All unanticipated problems should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required by [CONTACT_429812]), the supporting agency head (or designee), and OHRP within one month of the IRB’s receipt of the report of the problem 
from the investigator.  
 For device studies, investigators are required to submit a report of a UADE to the sponsor and the reviewing IRB as soon as possible, but in no event later than [ADDRESS_543857] learns of the event (§ 812.150(a)(1)).  
 
FDA: 
IND Safety Reporting Requirements  
This protocol is associated with an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) 
sponsored by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Joseph Pi[INVESTIGATOR_429772] .  IND Safety Reports are 
required for any  adverse experience associated (or possibly associated) with the use of 
the investigational product(s) that is both serious and unexpected. To meet the IND Safety Reporting requirements set forth in 21 CFR §312.32,  FDA Form 3500A 
(MedWatch form) will be completed and provided to the Moffitt Office of Institutional Regulatory Affairs for Investigational Drugs and Devices. All other adverse events will be reported to the FDA as part of the annual reporting requirement of the IND.  
The initial report will be as complete as possible, including details of the current illness 
and serious adverse event, and an assessment of the causal relationship between the event and the investigational product(s). Information not available at the time of the initial report (e.g., an end date for the adverse event or laboratory values received after the report) will be documented on a follow -up report. A final report to document 
resolution of the serious adverse event is required if it is not documented in the initial report.  
The Moffitt Office of Institutional Regulatory Affairs will complete the necessary 
documents and provide the report to the FDA as an official submission to the IND. This will occur independently of any other use of the MedWatch form or required reporting of 
serious adverse events.   Submission of the MedWatch form to any other agency, 
including the FDA, does not fulfill this IND Safety Reporting requirement.   Follow -up to 
 
Version 7.0 
Version Date: 3.10.[ADDRESS_543858] also be submitted to the Office of Institutional Regulatory Affairs 
in a timely manner.   
Upon completion of the report, a copy of all initial and follow -up MedWatch forms will be 
FAXed to the Manager of the Office of Institutional Regulatory Affairs (813- 745-8332) 
and a telephone call or email will be made to confirm receipt.  
For unexpected fatal or life threatening experiences associated with the use of the investigational product(s), the Office of Institutional Regulatory Affairs will be contact[CONTACT_11252] 24 hours. Notification to the FDA will be made as soon as possible,  but no later 
than 7 calendar days after initial receipt of the information.  
 
Data Safety and Monitoring Plan  
The Data Safety & Monitoring Plan (DSMP) will ensure that this trial is well designed, 
responsibly managed, appropriately reported, and that it protects the rights and welfare of patients. The following internal and external review and monitoring processes provide oversight and active monitoring of this trial:

The Scientific Review Committee (SRC)  
The Cancer Center's internal Scientific Review Committee (SRC) provides for a formal 
internal peer review of all protocols and general scientific oversight of interventional clinical research. The Committee has a defined membership representing all of the 
major research divisions of the Cancer Center, including biostatisticians. All new protocol submissions must contain the required elements of the protocol, and must includes a DSMP prior to approval by [CONTACT_30969]. The plan has to be appropriate for 
the phase and risk of the proposed study.  
 
The Protocol Monitoring Committee (PMC)  
The Protocol Monitoring Committee (PMC) will monitor this trial for safety, progress, 
protocol compliance, accrual, adverse event reporting, and data integrity. The membership of the PMC includes physician representation from each program area and a biostatistician. In addition to the existing stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], the PMC is authorized to suspend a trial for non- compliance with a DSMP or as a result of audit findings deemed 
unacceptable. The PMC will report significant findings to the IRB, and applicable regulatory bodies . Interim meetings are scheduled to address specific issues that 
require immediate attention to ensure safety of research participants.  
 
Phase I:
  Safety and monitoring reports are to be submitted to the Protocol Monitoring 
Committee (PMC) after completing each odd numbered dose level (i.e., 1, 3, 5, etc), or 
more frequently if requested by [CONTACT_428360].   A final sa fety and monitoring report must be 
submitted to the PMC within three months of defining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).      
Phase II:   Safety and monitoring reports are to be submitted to the Protocol Monitoring 
Committee (PMC) once 30% of the total accrual has been met or once the early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_429778].   A final safety and monitoring report must be 
submitted to the PMC within three months of last subject enrollment.   
 
The Research Compliance Division of the Cancer Center’s Compliance  Office 
(RCD) 
The Cancer Center’s Research Compliance Division (RCD) of the Corporate 
Compliance Department coordinates internal audits of all investigator -initiated trials 
conducted at the Cancer Center and its affiliates. The frequency of the audits is driven by [CONTACT_429813] a specific trial as well as the perceived patient risk for participating in the trial.   Internal audits are conducted by [CONTACT_429814].  
  The purpose of the internal audit program is to:

*Enrollment may occur within 14 days of initiation of prednisone for chronic GVHD.  Screening tests may 
occur between start of prednisone and ofatumumab.  
*As the MTD will not be known in real -time, patients on any of the phase I dose levels may potentially be 
those carried forward from the MTD cohort as the recommended phase II dose. Accordingly, patients in all dose levels of the phase I trial will need to have all of the above outlined on- study assessment s 
performed until the MTD is defined. Once the MTD is defined, only those patients in the MTD cohort will continue to have all of the ongoing assessments performed. Conversely, those in the non- MTD cohorts 
will complete an abbreviated assessment measure set to include only the chronic GVHD activity assessments/response determination and the biologic studies (B cell subsets, BAFF levels) at 6 and 12 month time points. These limited assessments for the non- MTD dose level patients will be included to 
examine the relationship between dose and clinical response, and dose/pharmacodynamic activity.

 
Rev. 07/01/[ADDRESS_822648] of Early L -Carnitine 
Supplementation on Neurodevelopmental Outcomes in Very Preterm Infants  
 
Background/Significance:  
Prematurity is a known risk factor for neurodevelopmental problems.1Risk factors for poor outcome 
include hypoxemia, ischemia, acidosis, hypoglycemia and infections .2One factor associated with 
improved neurodevelopmental outcome in preterm infants is gro wth.  In a study of infants receiving 
intensive neonatal nutritional support, better weight gain and head circumference growth during the initial 
NICU stay w ere associated with improvements in long-term neurodevelopment.3 
 
Neuroprotective e ffects of carnitine : 
The susceptibility of the newborn brain to damage is determined by [CONTACT_327029], in cluding severity and 
duration of an insult, membrane lipid composition, the number and duration of excitatory N -methyl -D-
aspartate receptors in the brain, and the presence of antioxidants.4Antioxidants play an important role in 
protecting vulnerable cells from hypoxic -ischemic damage.  One such antioxidant, carnitine, is an 
important nutrient which is synthesized in the liver and k idney during the breakdown of endogenous 
proteins from the resultant lysine and methionine.  Carnitine enhances energy production by [CONTACT_618776]-chain fatty acids into mitochondria for beta -oxidation.  Carnitine maintains adequate free coenzyme -
A for  metabolic pathways and protects cells against accumulation of toxic acyl -coenzyme -A compounds.  
In vitro models have shown that carnitine protects against neuronal damage.  The mechanism(s) 
contributing to cell death in hypoxic -ischemic brain injury were simulated in [ADDRESS_822649], kainic 
acid (KA).[ADDRESS_822650] of carnitine.  Sprague –Dawley 
rats exposed to hypobaric hypoxia for 14 consecutive days showed spatial memory impairments, which 
were reduced in rats treated with acetyl -L-carnitine (ALCAR) compared with controls.6  Similarly, in a rat 
model of Alzheimer’s Disease, spatial memory impairments were associated with tau 
hyperphosphorylation by [CONTACT_23983] -3β.  The administration of ALCAR decreased the spatial memory 
impairment of the rats by [CONTACT_618777] -3β activation.7  In addition, ALCAR arrested microtubule -
associated protein tau hyperphosphorylation at  multiple Alzheimer’s disease sites and enhanced the 
expression of several memory -associated proteins in the rat hippocampus.  In a rat model of Parkinson’s 
disease, acetyl -L-carnitine was shown to improve motor performance and reduce the level of lipid 
peroxides in rat brains as compared to controls.8  Treatment with L -carnitine in newborn rats during 
exposure to hypoxic -ischemic injury was associated with reduced neurologic injury, as demonstrated by 
[CONTACT_618778] t loss and less neuronal death.9  Carnitine treatment in these studies was administered 
over a short period , up to two weeks.  
 
Carnitine has also been studied in neurologic disorders in human subjects.  A randomized controlled trial 
of carnitine supplementation in pediatric patients with Rett Syndrome indicated that carnitine was 
associated with improvement in report of well -being and improvement in the Hand Apr axia Scale.10A 
randomized controlled trial of carnitine in patients with diabetic neuropathy reported that carnitine was 
effec tive and well -tolerated in improving neurophysiological parameters and in reducing pain over a 1 -
year period.11 
 
Carnitine and  the preterm infant : 
Due to a deficiency in precursors and decreased enzyme activity, neonates have a reduced ability to 
synthesize carnitine  and become deficient without external supplementation .  Since placental transfer of 
carnitine occurs during the th ird trimester, premature infants have lower stores and are at increased risk 
of carnitine deficiency.[ADDRESS_822651] milk contains carnitine, and both cow’s milk and soy -based infant formulas are

Supplementation with L -carnitine in preterm infants has been shown to enhance lipid tolerance and fatty 
acid oxidation an d to increase nitrogen balance.16–24  Helms et al. and Bonner et al. reported better early 
weight gain (at two weeks of life) in inf ants supplemented with carnitine.23,24However, several studies 
investigating the effect of carnitine supplementation on long -term weight gain in preterm infants did not 
show a beneficial effect.25–27We have previously reported the results of a double -blind parallel placebo -
controlled randomized clinical trial to investigate the effect of L -carnitine supplementat ion on weight gain 
in very preterm infants.28  Infants were randomized to receive 50 umol/kg/day of L -carnitine or placebo.  
No significant difference was seen in average daily weight gain from birth until 36 weeks’ PMA or until 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  However, we observed decreased weight loss in infants during the time period when 
they received supplemental carnitine with parente ral nutrition (data not previously reported).  Similar to 
our findings, Crill and colleagues demonstrated a shorter time to regain birthweight in carnitine -
supplemented infants compared with controls.29These improvements were noted within a two week time 
period.  
 
In general, the literature shows the effect of carnitine on weight gain in premature infants may be related 
to a dosi ng effect.  T he studies that failed to show an effect on weight gain and apnea of prematurity 
utilized supra -physiologic dosages of carnitine (156 – 625 umol/kg/day), whereas Helms, Bonner , and we  
utilized supplementation dosages of carnitine within the ph ysiologic range (50 umol/kg/day or 8 
mg/kg/day).  This dosage was calculated based upon daily in utero accretion and with the estimated 
intake of carnitine from 150 ml/kg /day of pooled breast milk.30–32  This suggests that physiologic dosing 
may strike a balance between deficiency and over -supplementation.  
 
Carnitine and systemic effects in the preterm infant  
In addi tion to early weight gain , differences in three additional outcomes were noted in our previous 
study :rates of proven infection, hearing screen failure and PDA ligation (unpublished data) .  The study 
was not powered to detect these additional outcomes, but previous work indicates that there may be a 
physiologic basis for the differences noted.  I nfants treated with carnitine had a significantly lower rate of 
proven infection than control infants, a finding which may be related to previous work investigating the 
impact of carnitine on lymphocyte counts in  immunocompromised patients.33 The rate of PDA ligation was 
greater in infants t reated with carnitine.  We discuss the potential basis and implications of this finding in 
the “Risks and Discomforts” section of this proposal.  The rate of hearing screen failure was markedly 
reduced in carnitine -treated infants.  This finding is congrue nt with previous work by [CONTACT_27156], which 
showed that carnitine is protective against ototoxicity.[ADDRESS_822654] of nucleotide -

supplementation on neurodevelopmental outcomes in premature infants remains unexplored.   
 
Hypothesis:  
We hypothesize that preterm infants supplemented with early physiologic doses of L -carnitine while on 
parenteral nutrition will have improved short -term growth parameters and significantly higher 
neurobehavioral scores when compared with control infants.   
 
Primary  Aims :  
To determine whether carnitine supplementation is associated with:  
1. Decreased percent weight loss within the first two weeks of life and decreased length of time to 
regain birthweight.    
2. Improved performance on the NICU Network Neurobehavi oral Scale (NNNS) at [ADDRESS_822658] -
menstrual age (+/ - 2 weeks).  
 
Secondary Aims:  
To determine whether carnitine supplementation is associated with:  
1. Increased rate of growth of head circumference within the first month of life and increased food 
efficiency (weight gain/calorie intake) during the supplementation period.  
2. Normalization of the serum carnitine profile at two weeks of life, compared with infants born at a 
post-menstrual age 2 weeks later.  
3. Enhanced brain maturation as measured by [CONTACT_618779] -integrat ed EEG (aEEG) measurements 
obtained during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2779]  
4. Fewer abnormal findings , better brain growth , white matter development and brain metabolism  on  
brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 36 -40 weeks’ corrected age (prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7954])  
 
Because of the potential for systemic effects of L -carnitine supplementation, we will also monitor those 
variables which showed significant difference in our prior study:  rates of proven infection, hear ing screen 
failure and PDA ligation.  
 
Primary Outcomes:  
1. Length of time to regain birthweight,  
2. Percent weight loss in the first two weeks of life,  
3. Neurodevelopmental scores on the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS) at [ADDRESS_822659]-menstrual age (+/- 2 weeks)  
 
Methods/Design:  
This is a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial involving infants with gestational age (GA) <[ADDRESS_822660] signed an 
informed consent form will be randomized to receive either carnitine supplementation (50 µmol/kg/day)

 Infants born <32weeks ’ gestation  
Exclusion criteria:  
 Presence of  
o potentially life -threatening congenital anomaly  
o known hereditary metabolic disorder

Participant recruitment :  Parents or guardians of infants who meet study criteria will be approached 
regarding the study as early as possible within 72 hours of the infant’s birth.  Informed consent will be 
obtained by [CONTACT_618780].  Permission will be requested to re -contact [CONTACT_618781] -up. 
 
Randomization :  As previously described by [CONTACT_618782]., enrolled patients will be randomized to either 
the treatment group (L -carnitine, 50 µmol/kg/day) or placebo group (5% glucose, similar volume as the L -
carnitine group).[ADDRESS_822661] signed informed parental/guardian 
consent will be enrolled in the study.  Because gestational age and small for gestational age (SGA) status 
will impact our outcome measures, we will ensure they are equally distributed in the arms of the study by 
[CONTACT_618783] .  We will analyze the two study arms using an intent -to-treat 
analysis.  Therefore, enrolled p atients will be stratified into fourgroups: gestational age 23 to 26 6/7 
weeks, gestational age 27 to 29 6/7 weeks, gestational age 30 to 31 6/7 weeks and small for gestational 
age (SGA).  Patients within each stratum will be randomized by [CONTACT_618784] a computerized 
block -generation with sets of 4.  In the case of multiple births, all infants must meet study criteria, and the 
infants will be ran domized as a set.  One infant of the multiple -birth set will be randomly chosen for 
inclusion in the analysis.  A recruitment log of all screened infants will be maintained. Clinicians and the 
nursing staff will be unaware of the arm of the treatment proto col to which the patient is assigned. Codes 
will be unblinded only after all patients have reached the study end -point , or at the request of the Data 
Safety Monitoring Board . 
 
Study supplementation :  Infants randomized to the treatment group will receive 5 0 µmol/kg/day of L -
carnitine intravenously for 2 weeks, and infants randomized to placebo will received 5% glucose, similar 
volume to the L -carnitine group.  At two weeks, sufficient carnitine is provided in enteral feeds of either 
breast milk or infant fo rmula.  If no intravenous access is available before the supplementation endpoint, 
the equivalent dose of enteral study supplement  (L-carnitine or placebo) will be administered.[ADDRESS_822662] NICU protocol.   
 
Of note, as many as  10% of the infants in the study will likely continue to rely primarily on parenteral 
nutrition beyond the proposed two -week supplementation period.  Enteral feeds may be withheld from 
these infants due to underlying illness es such as sepsis or gastrointes tinal disorders like necrotizing 
enterocolitis.  Due to the presence of underlying illness, these infants are at an even higher risk for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_618769] s.42Therefore, in study patients who are not receiving adequate enteral 
nutrition (100 cc/kg/day of enteral intake) after 2 -weeks of study supplements, carnitine supplementation 
will be continued until the se infant  are receiving  adequate enteral feeds ; at this point, t heir physiologic 
carnitine requirements will be  met by [CONTACT_618785].

Rev. 07/01/2014  Serum carnitine profiles :  Blood samples (dried blood spots) will be collected at study enrollment and 
again at two weeks of life for measurement of acyl carnitine profiles as well as total and free carnitine 
levels .  Collected samples will be batched and shipped to Baylor College of Medicine.  As blood 
transfusions may impact carnitine levels, these studies  will be drawn prior to a blood transfusion requir ed 
between the first and second weeks of life.

Rev. 07/01/2014  Amplitude -integrated EEG measurements (aEEG)  
It has previously been reported that background aEEG activity is concordant with the neurological 
examination and with background patterns on full -scale EEG.43,[ADDRESS_822664] a predictive  value for developmen tal outcomes at 3 years of age.45  We will, therefore, 
use aEEG recordings for neurophysiological assessm ents in our study population.  Sedation is not 
required for this procedure.  
We will perform 3-hour aEEG recordings within 2 -3 days of initiation of  carnitine or placebo 
supplementation and then at the following PMA: 28 weeks’, 32 weeks’, 36 weeks’, and at 40 weeks’ PMA 
if infant is still admitted to the NICU . aEEG readings will be recorded from the surface of the brain using 
surface disc electrodes and a Cerebral Function Monitor (CFM) System (Olympic Brainz Monitor; Natus 
Medical Inc., San Carlos, CA). The Brainz monitor  is a bedside brain monitor designed for continuous use 
in the NICU environment. With its 2 -channel capability, this system offers clinicians the ability to monitor 
brain function at the bedside displaying both real time EEG activity and a t ime-compressed trend of EEG 
called amplitude integrated EEG (aEEG) from both cerebral hemispheres. The EEG recordings are stored 
as downloadable digital files for offline analysis and archiving . The quality of the recording will be 
monitored by [CONTACT_618788]. The tracings will be assessed for both quantitative and 
qualitative characteristics observed in the whole tracing. We will assess the following: (1) continuity, (2) 
sleep -wake  cycling, (3) voltage and span or bandwidth of the signals, and (4) presence or absence of 
seizure activity.   
 
These aEEG recordings are non -invasive and do not create additional risk for the patient.  These aEEG 
readings will be performed by [CONTACT_618789].  
 
MRI Brain Imaging  
Imaging of the brain at term -equivalent is the standard of care for the evaluation of preterm infants prior to 
being discharged home. In our Neonatal Intensive Care Units, we  routinely obtain brain MRI at ≥ 36 
weeks’ corrected age (prior to discharge home).  The MRI examination is performed in sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_618770]; therefore, sedation is not required for the procedure.  MRI will be performed per 
routine pr otocol at 36 weeks’ corrected age, prior to discharge home.  Brain growth will be assessed on 
anatomical images, through manual segmentation of the basal ganglia, cerebellum and whole brain. 
White matter development will be assessed on diffusion tensor ima ging (DTI), using the tract -based 
spatial statistics method. The DTI measures fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity, which have 
previously been shown to be abnormal in ex -preterm children; these will be compared in multiple white 
matter regions (cereb ral peduncle, posterior limb of the internal capsule, corona radiata, corpus callosum, 
and optic radiations).37,46,47 
 
Brain metabolism will be assessed using proton MR spectroscopy, obtained from both white matter 
(centrum semiovale) and gray matter (basal ganglia) structures. The relative concentrations of the brain 
metabolites choline, creatine and n -acetylaspartate (NAA ) will be compared between control and 
carnitine -supplemented children. Each metabolite reflects specific cellular and biochemical processes. 
NAA is a neuronal marker and decreases with any disease that adversely affects neuronal integrity. 
Choline is a co nstituent of cell membranes and an intermediate of phospholipid metabolism. Choline 
levels on MR spectroscopy increase with increased membrane turnover, and are taken as a measure of 
cell proliferation. Creatine plays a role in maintaining energy -dependent  systems in brain cells by [CONTACT_618790] a reserve for high energy phosphates. Because the creatine peak remains fairly stable even in face of 
disease, it may be used as a control value.48  In children born preterm, the NAA/Choline ratio at term -
equivalent age correlates wi th later cognitive development.[ADDRESS_822665].

Rev. 07/01/[ADDRESS_822666] chosen to administer the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale due to its 
prevalence of use in neonatal r esearch and its s trong psychometric properties.49 
 
The NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS) was developed by [INVESTIGATOR_328068] M. Lest er, Ph. D., & Edward 
Z. Tronick, Ph.D.50  The scale is intended for use with use with healthy and at -risk preterm infants and fu ll 
term infants at risk because of prenatal substance exposure or other conditions.  The NNNS can be 
utilized in either a clinical or research setting in order to obtain a comprehensive assessment of 
neurobehavioral functioning.  There is a focus on neurol ogic, stress, and withdrawal signs.  The tool may 
be used with infants through 6 weeks of age and may be used as early as 30 weeks for preterm infants. 
The exam assesses 115 items in three categories:  
 
 Neurological items:  active and passive muscle tone, primitive reflexes, and central nervous 
system integrity  
 Behavioral state, sensory, and interactive responses  
 Stress/abstinence items  
 
The examiner assesses the items.  Summary scores are generated for stress, withdrawal, and the major 
domains of neurobeha vioral performance.  The NNNS is administered in a standardized format which 
allows objective assessment of the infant.  Normed scores are available for at -risk and healthy infants.   
Because the assessment is relatively new, there are no long -term studies looking at predictive validity.  
However, the test is based upon a variety of prior tools, where long -term predictive validity has been 
shown.[ADDRESS_822667] takes approximately 20 minutes to administer.  (Ordering information:  
http://www.brookespublishing.com/store/books/lester -7659/index.htm ) 
 
We wi ll assess neurodevelopmental outcomes at [ADDRESS_822668] Editio n (BSID -III). The BSID -III is a validated  instrument used for 
assessing the development of Cognitive, Language (Receptive and Expressive), Motor (Fine and Gross), 
Social -Emotional and Adaptive skills in infants and toddlers. This normative assessment yields scaled 
scores, composite scores, percen tile ranks, and developmental age equivalents, all of which provide 
important information about a child’s level of functioning relative to his or her same -age peers. While 
Cognitive, Language and Motor skills are assessed through direct interaction with th e child, Social -
Emotional and Adaptive skills are obtained from parent report. Because the BSID -III is commonly used for 
identifying children who are in need of early intervention due to developmental delays, this instrument will 
be sensitive to detecting the types of developmental issues we often  see in very young children born 
preterm . Additionally, at the follow -up visit at 18 -24 months corrected age, we will administer two parental 
questionnaires: the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M -CHAT) a nd the Child Behavior Checklist 
(CBCL). M-CHAT is a parent -report checklist developed to screen children for early signs of autistic 
features. The CBCL is a  standardized, well -validated parent -report questionnaire developed to assess 
various maladaptive be havioral and emotional problems in young children.  
 
Record confidentiality: Records relating to the study will be kept in a secure location, to which only study 
personnel will have access.  Records will be kept in a locked file cabinet in the neonatology o ffices and in 
a password -protected computer.  
 
Statistical Analyses : 
Statistical analysis will be performed with the assistance of a statistician.  
 
Sample size :  
We plan to recruit a total of 150 infants for our study over approximately 36months' time.  This number is 
based upon an expected attrition of approximately 50 infants over the course of the study and a desired 
sample size of 100 infants.  The inclusion of 100 infants in our study (50 in each study arm) will allow us 
to detect a mo derate difference in our primary outcomes at a significance level of 0.05 with a power of 
0.8.  (0.5 SD; α = .05; power = .80).

Baseline Comparability : 
Distribution of all variables will be examined for normality. Mean (continuous variables), or median 
(ordinal data and not normally distributed data) will be used as measures of central tendency.  Range, 
percentiles, variance and standard deviation will be used as measures of  dispersion. Standard error of 
the mean and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated to estimate the true populations mean for the 
placebo and the carnitine supplemented group.  Frequency distribution will be presented as grouped, as 
well as relative fr equency.  Bivariate distributions will be presented using contingency tables. Descriptive 
statistics of infant's characteristics at baseline will be compared between carnitine supplemented and 
placebo group using t -tests for continuous variables (birthweig ht, age at enrollment) and chi -square test 
for categorical variables (race, sex, prenatal care, multiple gestation, type of delivery).  
 
Outcome Measures :  
The effect of L -carnitine supplementation on outcome measures in enrolled infants will be examined fo r 
significance by [CONTACT_618791] a 
statistician.  Continuous data (percent weight loss, time to regain birthweight, NNNS score , BSID -III 
scores ) will be compared between the “placebo” and the “c arnitine supplemented” groups by [CONTACT_618792] t -test (a 2 tailed P value <0.05 will be considered to indicate statistical significance) or Wilcoxon’s 
rank sum test for non -parametric parameters. Unmatched nominal data will be compared using Fisher’s 
Exact Test or Chi -square test as required (e.g.: presence or absence of normalization of the carnitine 
profile; or presence or absence of pathological findings on the discharge MRI). Logistic regression models 
will be used to adjust for potentially confoundi ng factors including gestational age, birth weight, race, 
gender, Apgar scores.  
 
Risks and Discomforts : 
A brief description of the risks and discomforts associated with this study is included in the protocol 
consent form and will be discussed in detail wit h each family at the time of study enrollment.   
 
Carnitine is routinely administered with parenteral nutrition in approximately one -third of the neonatal 
intensive care units in the [LOCATION_002], although not in the Jack D. Weiler Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_618771]’s.  Carnitine is FDA -approved,  and there have been no reports of severe toxicity from

such as gastritis, vomiting, diarrhea or abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]; body odor; and seizures, in pati ents with or 
without a known seizure disorder.  These side effects are dose -dependent and might be avoided by [CONTACT_618793].  One investigator reported transient elevation of 
triglycerides and increased platelet aggre gation in uremic patients with severe renal insufficiency who 
received high doses of carnitine supplementation.52 
 
There is a theoretical risk of reduced closure of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in infants treated with 
indomethacin who receive carnitine supplementation as opposed to placebo.[ADDRESS_822670] been no other reports of adverse effects in neonates receiving 
supplementation doses (approximately 50 μmol/kg/day) although approximately one -third of NICU’s in the 
[LOCATION_002] supplement carnitine routinely i n parenteral nutrition.   In addition, there have been at least 
[ADDRESS_822671] in the event that questions/concerns regarding patient safety have 
been raised or if an unexpected AE/SAE occurs that is  possibly related to the study.  A report will be 
circulated to the board members approximately [ADDRESS_822672] unforeseen side effects.  All AEs will be 
collected and recorded as part of the study.  For each, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_618772]:

Rev. 07/01/[ADDRESS_822675] increased 
mortality compared to full -term infants.   Review of our own Weiler NICU data in 2010 revealed a high 
mortality rate ininfants less than 30 weeks gestational age:  approximately 75% for infants of gestational 
age of 23 weeks, 24% for gestational age 24 -26 weeks, and 5% for infants of gestational age 27 – [ADDRESS_822676] similar rates in infants enrolled in our study.  
 
An additional amount of blood will be drawn as part of the study protocol.  The estimated amount of blood 
is approximately 200 – 300 µl two to three times over the course of the study.  The blood draw will be 
obtained with other routine bloodwork whenever possible in order to avoid additional discomfort to the 
infant.   
 
Benefits:  
Carnitine has been shown to have anti -oxidant effects, enhance cellular function and prevent a poptosis.  
Supplementation has been associated with protection of neurons against hypoxic -ischemic injury in both 
in vitro and in vivo models.  In preterm infants, carnitine supplementation is associated with decreased 
time to regain birthweight.  Thus , potential benefits of  carnitine supplementation in premature infants 
include  hypoxic -ischemic neuronal injury  protection  and enhance d brain growth, leading to improved 
neurodevelopmental outcomes.   
 
Problems with neurodevelopment are a well -known morbidity for infants born very preterm.  Thus, it is 
important from a public health and scientific standpoint to determine whether carnitine supplementation 
has an impact on this outcome.  The potential identification of an important physiological benefit of 
carnit ine could lead to changing current recommendations for nutritional supplementation for preterm 
infants to include carnitine.   
 
Financial Compensation : 
No financial compensation is planned.  Carnitine supplementation will not be charged to the patient or 
insurance company.

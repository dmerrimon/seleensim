2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus 
A significant number of patients Alzheimer’s disease or related dementia diagnoses will 
be cared for in nursing homes near the end of life. Unfortunately, many of these patients experience unwanted and burdensome medical treatments, such as potentially avoidable hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], that negatively impact quality of life. Advance care planning (ACP) discussions with patients  and family caregivers are important to explore goals in advance 
of a crisis and support informed, values- based decision -making. The ACP process helps 
to ensure that preferences about treatments such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_637216], 
documented, and honored. R esearch indicates that ACP can reduce burdensome 
treatments and increase the likelihood that care will match documented preferences. Nursing homes are currently required by [CONTACT_637250]. However, there are no training requirements for nursing home staff and approaches to fulfilling this regulatory and ethical responsibility vary widely, resulting in inconsistent ACP. The “Aligning Patient Preferences – a Role Offering Alzheimer’s patients, Caregivers, and Healthcare prov iders Education and Support (APPROACHES)” 
trial will test the ACP Specialist Program. Existing nursing home staff members will be trained to enhance care and reduce unwanted, burdensome hospi[INVESTIGATOR_637217], standardized staff education on ACP, and systematic ACP facilitation.

[ADDRESS_851712] patients and their family caregivers. This intervention will be delivered by [CONTACT_637252] (e.g., social worker).  
 The over- riding objective of this proposal is to conduct a pragmatic cluster randomized 
controlled trial (RCT) of “Aligning Patient Preferences – a Role Offering Alzheimer’s patients, Caregivers, and Healthcare providers Ed ucation and Support (APPROACHES) ” 
that aims to improve ACP and goal-directed outcomes in nursing home patients with ADRD. In the R33 phase, we will conduct the full pragmatic RCT in partnership with 2 nursing home corporations (Signature [CONTACT_637272]’s Health Systems) in  a 
combi ned total of 142 diverse facilities in 8 states. Consistent with the spi[INVESTIGATOR_264518] a 
pragmatic trial, we will use existing data sources including electronic health records (EHR), the Minimum Data Set 3.0 (MDS), and Medicare Claims data to characterize the cohort and measure outcomes. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_637219] [ADDRESS_851713] patients is the 1
o trial outcome.  
 
3 STUDY DESIGN 
A total of 142  nursing home s will be randomized to either an intervention or control arm 
within each corporation (Signature, N= 109; Miller’s, N= 33 ). In intervention nursing 
home s, a nursing home provider (e.g. social worker) will be trained as an ACP Specialist 
who will work with nursing home leaders to: i. Consolidate nursing home ACP procedures; ii. Train and educate staff; and iii. Facilitate ACP with patients and their family caregivers. Control nursing home s will apply the usual ACP practices. The 
implementation period is expe cted to  be [ADDRESS_851714] patients in the nursing 
homes during the implementation will be followed for 12 months.  
4 SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PARTICIPANTS   
Facilities will be randomized to either the control arm or the intervention arm. This selection will take into account the choice of each organization considering half the organizations facilities are included in each arm.    
APPROACHES Protocol Version 1.3 Date : July 15, [ADDRESS_851715] is defined to include cognitive impairment1 or a 
documented diagnosis of dementia in the MDS. Patients will be excluded if they are currently enrolled in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_637220] . 
 Eligible facilities who agree to participate in the trial will be stratified at two levels: corporate ownership (Signature [CONTACT_637272]’s Health Systems ) & average 
number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_637221] [ADDRESS_851716]. Problematic or unstable facilities will be removed in consultation with nursing home corporate leaders prior to randomization.  
 
4.1 Inclusion Criteria  
• Medicare- certified  
• All residents with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. 
• > 50 licensed beds  
• >50% of residents are long-stay (>100 days in the facility) 
4.2 Exclusion Criteria  
• Patients currently enrolled in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_637220]  
• Problematic or unstable nursing homes   
• Defined by [CONTACT_637253] 
4.3 Study Enrollment Procedures  
• Enrollment is occurring at the facility level; individual patients are not being 
enrolled. 
 
[ADDRESS_851717] program will be rolled out to the 
intervention buildings. All communications will be tailored to fit the corporate branding style of Signature  [CONTACT_637272]’s Health Systems . Communications about the 
ACP Specialist Program with individual facilities will be delivered by [CONTACT_637254][INVESTIGATOR_637222], with , at minimum,  
monthly meetings with the project team to discuss issues and any unmet needs. At the conclusion o f the pragmatic cluster RCT, we will merge our data and analyze to measure 
APPROACHES Protocol Version 1.3 Date : July 15, 2025 10 our primary and secondary outcomes. 
6 STUDY PROCEDURES  
6.1 Description of Evaluations  
6.1.1. Enrollment, Baseline, and/or Randomization  
Nursing home  Eligibility : All Medicare -certified nursing homes are eligible at 
Signature [CONTACT_637273]’s Health Systems.  
 
Nursing home  Recruitment & Characteristics:  
The ACP Specialist Program will be rolled out as a corporate initiative and nursing 
home Executive Directors will be requested to participate in the initiative by [CONTACT_637255]. It is anticipated all nursing home Executive Directors who are approached will agree to participate.  
 Nursing home  corporate partners each provided data about key nursing home 
characteristics.  At the time of randomization Signature [CONTACT_637274] 1 09 
nursing homes in 8 states, with a total of 8,811 beds; 43% are rural. Miller’s Health Systems owns 3 3 nursing homes, all in Indiana with 3,066 beds; 55% are rural. The 
mix of rural and urban facilities will provide a rich environment for this pragmatic trial. Self-reported 30-day hospi[INVESTIGATOR_637223] 2016 range from 13% for Miller’s  Health Systems  and 17% for Signature [CONTACT_637275] s. 
 
Random Assignment : Nursing homes will be sorted  into groups that are comparable 
on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_637224]. Eligible facilities who agree to participate in the trial will be stratified at two levels: corporate ownership (Signature  [CONTACT_637272]’s 
Health Systems) & average number of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_637221] [ADDRESS_851718] of care and the risk of harm is no greater than those ordinarily encountered in the daily life of a nursing home patient or family caregiver who may be offered the opportunity to engage in ACP by [CONTACT_637256]. 
APPROACHES Protocol Version 1.3 Date : July 15, 2025 11 According to 45 CFR 46.102 (OHRP 2017),22 research is considered to pose minimal risk 
if the likelihood and degree of harm or discomfort anticipated from the research is no 
greater than that ordinarily encountered during daily life . 
 
7.1 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE)  is generally defined as any unfavorable and unintended 
diagnosis, symptom, sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), syndrome or disease which either occurs during the study, having been absent at baseline, or if present at baseline, appears to wor sen.  
 A serious adverse event (SAE)  is generally defined as any untoward medical occurrence 
that results in death, is life threatening, requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is a congeni tal anomaly.  
 
The potential serious negative reaction (SNR) that could occur during this trial is serious 
patient or family caregiver distress when engaging in ACP with the ACP Specialist. Based on our experience and results from other research studies, we anticipate th at this 
will be rare. Serious distress could be demonstrated by [CONTACT_637257], 
uncontrolled crying, or early termination of an ACP discussion with the Specialist. The 
nature of these discussions is sensitive and personal, thus expression s of emotion, 
including tears, is expected and would not be considered a SNR. Training of the ACP 
Specialist will include emphasis on the importance of asking permission to begin an ACP 
conversation and respecting patient and family refusals. It will also include provision of 
emotional support and empathic statements during discussions. ACP Specialist training 
will include recognition of SNRs and instruction. In the R33 phase, staff will be 
instructed to report any negative reactions immediately to the Exec utive Director and the 
nursing home Corporate Implementation Champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]. Together, these health care 
providers will evaluate the severity of the event and, if deemed serious, will report the 
SNR to the research team project manager via email or fax within [ADDRESS_851719] (DSMB) Chair in writing (email and hard copy) with in 48 
hours. The Co- PIs will take ultimate responsibility for ensuring the DSMB chair is 
informed in a timely manner. Follow -up includes checking in with the patient or family 
caregiver within 6 to 24 hours of the initial SNR to assess whether further inte rvention is 
needed to mitigate the SNR. If necessary, the patient or family caregiver should be 
referred for follow -up (e.g., referring family caregiver to primary care provider or 
community mental health facility).  
 
We do not believe any potential consequences of APPROACHES would be considered 
serious adverse events (SAEs). We do not believe that death should be considered an 
SAE for this trial as: 1) death is often not unexpected in this nursing home population 
with ADRD; 2) death is not an adverse outcome for patients and families with goals of comfort or palliation if those goals are met; and 3) it is not known whether or not 
APPROACHES Protocol Version 1.3 Date : July 15, [ADDRESS_851720] manager , data 
manager, information technology (IT) support person, and the IT representatives for each of the t wo partner institutions will all participate in the Regulatory and Operations 
Workgroup. This workgroup will also be responsible for obtaining appropriate agreements for nursing home health system partners, including Memoranda of Understanding (M OU) and Data Use Agreements (DUA) prior to any data transfer. This 
workgroup has oversight of submission of CMS data requests, that must include all data 
security precautions, as well as submission of the protocol to the Indiana University 
Indianapolis (IUI) Institutional Review Board (IRB) for review and approval. The Regulatory and Operations workgroup will also support the coordination of DSMB.

Any adverse events and unanticipated problems requiring immediate action will be discussed immediately with either of the PIs to determine necessary corrective action. Problems not requiring 
immediate actions will be addressed during monthly research team meeting and at quarterly DSMB meetings. Outcome of adverse events and unanticipated problems will be periodically rep orted to the IRB and the NIH. 
 
Content of Data and Safety Monitoring Report 
APPROACHES Protocol Version 1.3 Date : July 15, [ADDRESS_851721] Membership  
DSMB membership will include experts or representatives of the field with relevant clinical expertise, clinical trials methodology, and biostatistics. The members will be selected by [CONTACT_45429] (NIA) program officer in consultation with the Co -PIs. 
 
Conflict of Interests  
Members of the DSMB shall have no direct involvement with the study investigators or nursing home corporate partners. Each DSMB member will sign the IU Conflict of Interest Statement, which include current affiliations and any other relationships that could be perceived as a conflict of interest related to the study.  
Protection of Confidentiality  
Data will be presented in a blinded manner with no participant or nursing home identifiers. All materials, discussions, and proceedings of the DSMB will be completely confidential and DSMB members are expected to maintain confidentiality.  
 
DSMB Responsibilities  
The DSMB will be formed in consultation with the NIA program officer and will include 2-[ADDRESS_851722] and will be responsible for running meetings. The DSMB will be charged with monitoring patient 
safety, data quality and overall performance of the study. Responsibilities will include 
review of the research protocol, with a focus on protecting patient confidentiality and the plan for data and safety monitoring. Review of performance will include progress towards milestones, evaluation of recruitment, assessment of any serious negative reactions, and identification of issues around data storage or quality. The DMSB will also advise the NIA on the readiness of the trial to initiate recruitment, progress of the trial, and review of study performance including making recommendations and/or assisting in the resolution of problems identified by [CONTACT_24478] -PIs. The DMSB will report to the NIA on 
the safety and progress of the trial as well as commenting on any problems with study conduct, enrollment, sample size, and/or data collection. All adverse events and unanticipated problems occurring during the course of the study will be collected, documented, and reported to the PIs and the DSMB Chair. These will be reported to NIA Project Officer and IRB quarterly. The PIs will meet with the study team staff weekly and at least one of the Co -PIs will be available at all times via email or phone . Serious 
adverse events potentially related to the intervention will be reported to both the Chair of the DSMB and to the NIA Project Officer within 24 hours of either PI [INVESTIGATOR_637228]. The DSMB Chair will determine if an additional meeting of the  DSMB is needed 
and convene.   
APPROACHES Protocol Version 1.3 Date : July 15, 2025 14 8 INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION  
Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting. 
The potential adverse event (AE)  that could occur during this trial is significant distress 
by [CONTACT_637258]. Such events may be the 
manifestation of a very negative emotional reaction during a facilitated ACP discussion including uncontrolled crying or complaining to facility leadership. Due to the sensitive nature of the material, tearing up, crying, expressions of emotion, or early termination of the conversation by [CONTACT_637259]. The risk of potential distress caused by [CONTACT_637260].  
Training of the ACP Specialist will include emphasis on the importance of asking permission to begin an ACP conversation and respecting patient and family refusals. It will also include provision of emotional support and empathic statements during discussi ons. ACP Specialist training will include recognition of AEs and instructions. In 
the R33 phase, staff will be instructed to report any negative reactions immediately to the Executive Director and the nursing home Corporate Implementation Champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]. Instructions are provided to the ACP Specialists and Corporate Implementation Champi[INVESTIGATOR_637229]. In the event of an AE, ACP Specialists will report the event to his/her immediate supervisor, who will report it to the Corporate Impl ementation Specialist. Together, these professionals will determine the 
severity of the event and if it is a true AE related to the ACP Specialist Program. If deemed necessary, the Corporate Implementation Champi[INVESTIGATOR_637230] [ADDRESS_851723] (DSMB) Chair in writing (email and hard copy) within 48 
hours. The Co- PIs will take ultimate responsibility for ensuring the DSMB chair is 
informed in a timely manner. Follow -up includes checking in with the patient or family 
caregiver within 6 to 24 hours of the initial AE to assess whether further intervention is 
needed to m itigate the AE. If necessary, the patient or family caregiver should be referred 
for follow -up (e.g., referring family caregiver to primary care provider or community 
mental health facility). A summary of any AEs will be reported quarterly to the NIA 
program officer and the IRB.  
 
We do not believe any potential consequences of APPROACHES would be considered 
serious adverse events (SAEs). We do not believe that death should be considered an 
SAE for this trial as: 1) death is often not unexpected in this nursing home population 
with ADRD; 2) death is not an adverse outcome for patients and families with goals of 
comfort or palliation if those goals are met; and 3) it is not known whether or not 
aggressive care provided at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_637231].

In the R33 phase, we will conduct the full pragmatic RCT in partnership with 2 nursing home corporations (Signature [CONTACT_637273]’s Health Systems) who operate a combined total of 142 diverse facilities in 8 states. Consistent with the spi[INVESTIGATOR_264518] 
a pragmatic trial, we will use existing data sources including electronic health records (EHR), the Minimum Data Set 3.0 (MDS),  and Medicare Claims data to characterize the 
cohort and measure outcomes. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_637219] [ADDRESS_851725].

the intracluster correlation (ICC) coefficient 𝜌𝜌 , which represents the strength of

correlate – the between cluster variation, which is commonly expressed as the coefficient of variation (CV).
24   Larger ICC or CV values will lead to bigger variance inflation and 
more power loss.   A power analysis was conducted  using preliminary data from the Minimum Data Set 
(MDS) provided by [CONTACT_286348]. We estimated that the between -cluster CV would be less  than 
0.5. Assuming that the two  treatment arms have similar CV values of a similar 
magnitude, we calculated the power for detecting 20% reduction in rate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_637232]. Our analysis showed that with 12 0 facilities ( 60

9.5 Data Analyses  
Design consideration. The R33 phase of the study has two aims: (Aim 1 – Primary) To 
compare hospi[INVESTIGATOR_207788] (admissions and emergency department visits)  over [ADDRESS_851731] patients in the intervention and control facilities; and (Aim 2 - 
Secondary) assess the interventional effect of the ACP Specialist Program on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_637236]. Towards these ends, we employ a cluster RCT design. With this design, randomization will be carried out at the nursing home  level, stratified 
by [CONTACT_637262][INVESTIGATOR_637237] (low 
versus high) . All patients at a given nursing home  will have the same intervention 
assignment . The trial outcomes will be analyzed  at the individual patient level  and 
reported at the facility level. The cluster RCT with nursing home  randomization is chosen 
because of its ability to simultaneously maximize the implementational feasibility and minimize the contamination risk.
25,[ADDRESS_851732] patients during the follow -up period will 
be considered as the primary outcome. We designed the trial to ensure adequate power for the hypothesis concerning the primary outcome. Average age and proportion of female patients is similar across our nursing home  partner facilities and the U.S. The % 
of Black patients ranges from 6 -17% across the population of our partner nursing home s. 
About half of nursing home  patients have a dementia diagnosis. This is similar for our 
partner facilities.  
 Analysis will be carried out in an intention -to-treat (ITT) framework, which gives a 
pragmatic estimate of the interventional benefit.
27 The ITT analysis will use data from all 
eligible patients in randomized facilities, regardless of the level of facilities’ adherence to the study protocol and patient attrition. ITT is a preferred approach for pragmatic trials

negative binomial models. If necessary we will consider the use of zero -inflated Poisson 
or negative binomial regression analysis. Correlations among outcomes measured from residents in the same facility will be accounted for by [CONTACT_637263]. This analytical approach handles missing data (early dropout due to death or transfer to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6125]) more easily because of the inclusion of offsetting parameters in the model.  
 
[ADDRESS_851734] program that would not be 
considered a protocol deviation. 
APPROACHES Protocol Version 1.3 Date : July 15, [ADDRESS_851735] (IRB) Review  
The proposed study has been  reviewed by [CONTACT_637264] (IRB), which will serve as the centralized, single IRB for the trial in accordance with National Institutes of Health policy. This trial is  registered at clinicaltrials.gov  
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . A Data Safety and Management Plan is described in this protocol . 
 
11.2 Informed Consent Forms  
A wavier of informed consent was  sought from the IRB. This pragmatic clinical trial 
meets the criteria for a waiver of informed consent as described in 45 CRF 46:116. Specifically: 1) this research represents no more than minimal risk; 2) a waiver does not adversely affect the rights and  welfare of participants; 3) the research could not be 
practicably carried out without the waiver; and 4) information will be provided to the nursing home  partners after the trial to share with interested patients and family  
caregivers.
29 Patient and family caregiver refusals to participate in ACP discussion will 
be honored.  
11.3 Participant Confidentiality  
Data provided by [CONTACT_637265] (MDS, EHR) will be transferred using 
HIPAA compliant, encrypted processes. CMS (Claims, MDS) and EHR data files will be securely stored using processes developed to meet CMS data requirements as part of a prior CMS data request. Specifi cally, data will be stored on a virtual server administered 
by [CONTACT_164940]’s Clinical Affairs IT Service (CAITS) team. The virtual server is located on Indiana University’s Intelligent Infrastructure on hardware that is physically located in two ent erprise -class machine rooms in separate physical locations. The server 
rooms require biometric authentication in addition to a chip -based access card and are 
staffed 24x7x365 and feature video security. Network firewall rules are used to restrict server access to only necessary subnets. Only IU domain workstations with security controls (auto logoff , centralized threat management, host -based firewall, and more) will 
be permitted to connect to the virtual server. Each study team member with access to the CMS  data must use a passphrase. Protocols are in place dictating that passphrases must 
be at least [ADDRESS_851736] 4 unique characters (letters, numbers, and symbols ) and use at least [ADDRESS_851737] -
based risk management process prior to receipt and use of the requested data. The process is briefly outlined below:  
 a) Inventory assets—hardware, software, personnel.  
APPROACHES Protocol Version 1.3 Date : July 15, 2025 19 b) Document controls—identify every existing and appropriate NIST 800-[ADDRESS_851738] 800-53 (an industry and government standard) is a comprehensive catalog of [ADDRESS_851739] 800-66 (a mappi[INVESTIGATOR_637238] 800- 53) is used to identify appropriate controls for electronic Personal Health 
Information. c) Assess risk —identify risks that existing control address and residual risk from missing 
controls.  
d) Respond to risk-how each residual risk is addressed (mitigated, transferred or accepted), explanation/justification, and timelines for mitigation, if any. e) Establish ongoing risk management—semi -annual reviews and documentation 
updates, external assessments.  
f) Training -two annual HIPAA training courses (University general course and an IT-
specific course).

13 CO MMITTEES  
Executive Committee: The Executive Committee will oversee all aspects of project development, implementation, and analysis including human resources, communications with the National Institutes of Health, and budgetary decisions.   Steering Committee: The Steering Committee will include the Co -PIs Hickman and 
Unroe, Co- I Tu, Consultant s Mitchell and Hanson, and representatives from each nursing 
home corporate partner. This group will be responsible for overseeing the project direction, ensuring close collaboration between APPROACHES and nursing home partners, coordinating workgroup tasks, and meeting project milestones. This includes transition to the R33 phase. The Steering Committee will also be responsible for reviewing EHRs to ens ure existing fields adequately capture relevant ACP data to guide 
clinical care (e.g., allow for documentation of specific POLST form orders and not just code status) with the goal of standardization of documentation across sites and the creation of clinic ally useful dashboards. 
 
APPROACHES Protocol Version 1.3 Date : July 15, 2025 20 Regulatory and Operations Workgroup: This workgroup will be led by [CONTACT_15957]- PI [INVESTIGATOR_637239], 
with Co -PI [INVESTIGATOR_637240], the p roject manager, data manager, information technology (IT) 
support, and nursing home  Corporate Data Experts. This Workgroup will be responsible 
for obtaining signed Memoranda of Understanding as well as a signed Data Use 
Agreements (DUA) from each corporate nursing home  partner and ensuring data are 
transferred safely. This Workgroup will prepare and submit the CMS data request outlining all data security  precautions along with related institutional policies. Because of 
the close link between data security and issues related to patient and family caregiver confidentiality, this workgroup will be responsible for oversight of the human subjects’ protections. This include d submitting an application to the Indiana University 
Institutional Review Board (IU IRB), which will serve as the IRB of record, and requesting a waiver of informed consent for patients and family caregivers . Finally, this 
group will oversee the implementation of the Data Safety and Monitoring plan, which includes developi[INVESTIGATOR_637241] (DSMB) charter, convening the DSMB, and supporting its work (see Section F).  APPROACHES Intervention Protocol Workgroup: This group will be responsible for implementation in the R33 phase. It will be led by [CONTACT_15957] -PI [INVESTIGATOR_637242] -PI [INVESTIGATOR_637240], 
Consultant Hanson, the Project Manager , and representatives from the partner 
organizations.   The ACP Specialist Program is based on the successful OPTIMISTIC nurse role but adapted for use by [CONTACT_637266]. The ACP Specialist Program will be 
implemented as a new nursing home  initiative. Corporate policies regarding ACP 
practices will be reviewed and potentially modified or developed in collaboration with 
our nursing home  partners to support roll out of this new initiative. Signature  
[CONTACT_637272]’s Health Systems corporate leadership have expressed 
willingness to make policy or procedure modifications necessary to support the ACP Specialist Program. Similar to OPTIMISTIC, a process will be developed to ensure the staff member designated as the ACP Specialist is assigned a group of [ADDRESS_851741] be held separately with Signature  [CONTACT_637272]’s Health Systems corporate 
leadership to identify opportunities and potential barriers within each system. The program will be refined based on this feedback followed by a smaller, combined meeting with representatives from each organization to review and finalize.  
 The ACP Specialist Program include s a brief online training for Executive Directors, 
Medical Directors, and Directors of Nursing (approximately 1 hour for each). The materials have been tailored to each nursing home  corporation electronic learning 
platform and brand standards. The goals of this training are: a review of ACP and its importance, particularly for patients with ADRD and their families; an understanding of the ACP Specialist Program and role; and to conve y the importance of support for the 
ACP S pecialist dedicated role as a key nursing home  staff position. Nursing  home

 The nursing home  staff member designated as the ACP Specialist will complete a longer 
training (approximately 7  hours) and will receive a hard -copy manual including sample, 
educational handouts and access to videos for patients, families, and other nursing home staff, documentation instructions, tracking tools, and tips for navigating common barriers. Due to the COVID-[ADDRESS_851743] patients and/or family caregivers using the target assignment list. Based on experience with OPTIMISTIC, the ACP Specialist will require a minimum of 1 day per week (20% FTE) initially, with a reduction over time after the initial start -up 
work. Dedicated time and schedule flexibility are critical to the success of the ACP Specialist to reach family caregivers and facilitate conversations.  
 Consistent with the principles of a pragmatic trial, instructions about how to implement the protocol role will be highly flexible.
[ADDRESS_851744] may be any staff person deemed qualified by [CONTACT_637268], though it is anticipated it will likely be a social worker or a nurse. It is expected that there will be adaptations to the ACP tools and educational materials a s needed.  
 Data Management and Analysis Workgroup: This group will be led by [CONTACT_15957]- PI [INVESTIGATOR_637243]-I Tu, Co-PI [INVESTIGATOR_637239], Co-I Mitchell, biostatistician, data manager, and IT Support. 
This group is responsible for the data management required to link data sources in preparation for analysis as well as the analysis itself. In order to assess our outcome measures to both justify the adequacy of these measures and finalize these variables, a subset of MDS and Claims file records will be compared to the nursing home EHR in collaboration with our clinical partners to determine whether the process of merging was 
accurate. For example, validity checks will be performed to see if all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_637244].

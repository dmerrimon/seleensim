1.Statement of Purpose: This prospective, open-label pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]/feasibility study of youth with T1D is to evaluate 
glycemic and metabolic changes taking place with a very low carbohydrate diet.
2.
3.Probable Duration of Project: The expected duration of the project is 5 years, including all follow-up and 
data analysis activities.  
4.Background: As recently reported by [CONTACT_750399] 1 Diabetes Exchange (T1DX)  Registry, adolescents  with type 
1 diabetes (T1D) was the age group that had the highest hemoglobin A1c (A1c) levels compared to older 
participants;  young adults aged 10-25 years were a close second (1).   While the American Diabetes 
Association (ADA) recommends youth target A1c of <7.5% and adults <7%, only 17% of youth and 21% of 
young adults in the T1DX achieved these targets despi[INVESTIGATOR_750390] (1, 2).  These data suggest a need for novel approaches to improve glycemic control in 
adolescents and young adults with T1D.  
Even for compliant youth with T1D, postprandial hyperglycemia continues to pose a challenge for many 
reasons, including, delayed insulin absorption and action compared to absorption of glucose from the 
gastrointestinal tract and dysregulated glucagon secretion after mixed meals (3).  Moreover, postprandial 
glycemic changes can differ substantially depending on the macronutrient composition of the meal.  
Specifically, meals with reduced carbohydrate but increased fat and protein content will lessen immediate 
postprandial hyperglycemia (4).  For many, being able to avoid carbohydrates and adhere to a very low 
carbohydrate diet may be easier than administering varying amounts of insulin for variable amounts of 
carbohydrate intake. Although standard treatment of T!D recommends varying the  pre-meal dose of rapid-
acting insulin depending on the patient’s insulin to carbohydrate ratio, studies have shown that inaccurate 
carbohydrate counting happens frequently and contributes to increased glycemic variability (5). 
Data from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) demonstrated that lowering the A1c by 
[CONTACT_750400]-normal glycemic levels decreases the risk of complications related to 
diabetes (6).  However, intensive management in the DCCT was accompanied by [CONTACT_750401] T1D (7).  One approach to achieve targeted glycemic control with less insulin 
exposure is through the use of a very low carbohydrate diet (VLCD), defined as limiting carbohydrate intake 
to 50 grams  per day or less (8).  In adults with T1D, these diets have been shown  to achieve exceptional 
glycemic control with physiologically normal A1c values with lower total daily insulin doses due to decreased 
mealtime insulin for low amounts of carbohydrate intake (9, 10).  
Importantly, VLCDs have not been formally studied in adolescents and young adults with T1D. Observational 
data on children using a VLCD are also conflicting.  A small case series of 6 children with T1D on a low 
carbohydrate diet showed deficits in anthropomorphic measurements and elevated lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], though in some 
cases a caloric deficit was also reported (11).  Conversely, a recent observational study of 131 children with 
T1D on a VLCD reported no significant change in height percentile or SDS after initiating the diet (12).  Prior 
studies have explored use of low carbohydrate diets in T1D, but none have specifically monitored for 
ketosis.  In those studies, it is likely that the lack of carbohydrate intake led to lower insulin needs, thus 
increasing lipolysis and ketogenesis, and levels of ketosis while on this type of diet require further study (13).

Page 3 of 26Since rigorous studies implementing a VLCD in youth with T1D remain to be done, the present pi[INVESTIGATOR_750391] a very low 
carbohydrate diet in adolescents and young adults with T1D who are receiving insulin pump therapy. 
Specifically, we will measure changes in plasma glucagon, β-hydroxybutyrate, and free fatty acid (FFA) levels, 
as well as changes in basal hepatic glucose production, glycerol turnover, lipid oxidation and plasma 
glucagon responses to arginine infusions. Continuous glucose monitoring will be used to evaluate changes in 
plasma glucose responses to meals before and after initiation of the VLCD. Insulin pump downloads will be 
employed to assess changes in basal and bolus insulin doses. 
Aims:  To examine changes in sensor glucose levels, basal and bolus insulin doses, and FFA, glucagon, and β-
hydroxybutyrate levels following implementation of a VLCD.  Sensor-derived time glucose ranges will serve 
as a surrogate marker of hemoglobin A1c given the short duration of the study.  We will also be assessing 
safety measures of the diet, including daily fasting ketone levels.  Hypothesis:  We hypothesize that use of a 
VLCD with strict monitoring of ketosis will reduce glycemic variability and increase time in target range, 
defined as 70-180 mg/dL by [CONTACT_750402] (>180 mg/dL) and hypoglycemic ranges 
(<70 mg/dL).  Decreased carbohydrate intake will lead to less postprandial hyperglycemia.  Lower insulin 
doses for meals and snacks as a result of decreased carbohydrate intake will lessen postprandial 
hypoglycemia as well.
Further, we will also measure changes in glucose and glycerol metabolic fluxes using stable isotopes and 
indirect calorimetry to measure rates of fat oxidation before and after 2 weeks of a VLCD. Arginine infusion 
will used to assess changes in plasma glucagon responses with the VLCD. Hypothesis: Glucose and glycerol 
turnover will be increased in those with T1D on a very low carbohydrate diet. Lipid oxidation will also be 
increased. We further hypothesize that the arginine-stimulated glucagon response will be increased while 
on the VLCD will, in turn, decrease the risk of late post-meal hypoglycemia during the VLCD. 
Research Plan:  This prospective feasibility study of 10 youth (ages 13 – 25) with T1D will evaluate glycemic 
and metabolic changes after [ADDRESS_1027399] 
carbohydrate diet (see Table 1).  The study will take place in 2 parts.  Part 1 will only involve the high protein 
VLCD, but part 2 will involve high protein VLCD and high fat VLCD’s.

After consent has been obtained, participants will review their diabetes history and answer demographic 
questions.   At this and all other study visits, participants will meet (virtually or in person for part 1) with a 
diabetes care provider (i.e., a physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant) who will carry out a 
comprehensive review of diabetes management and review blood glucose and ketone records. Participants will 
be asked to rate their puberty status in lieu of a physical exam for puberty.  A validated system for self-
assessment of puberty status that has been used by [CONTACT_750407].  Women of 
childbearing age will have a urine pregnancy test performed at the time of the screening/enrollment visit and 
the need for contraception for the entire duration of the study will be discussed. If pregnancy testing cannot be 
performed in-person, a pregnancy test will be mailed to the participant an we will ask them to securely send a 
photo of the results to the study team. The treatment regimen will be adjusted as clinically indicated.  
Individuals will be asked to wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) during the 2-week standard carbohydrate 
and 2-week VLCD assessment period. A CGM will be provided if the individual does not have one that they use 
as a part of routine care.  Insulin pumps and CGMs will be downloaded to assess prior glycemic control. 
Baseline data obtained at the enrollment visit will include:
Demographic characteristics, including family income, highest parental education attained, and number 
of individuals in the home.
Anthropometric measures will be reviewed from the most recent clinic visit, including height, weight, 
BMI, vital signs).  Participants will self-identify their tanner stages based on gender-specific norms. 
Current diabetes care practices (frequency of self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG), insulin dosing, 
review of blood glucose values)
Medical History: duration of diabetes, comorbidities, past medical history, social history, family history, 
medications, and allergies.
Additional diabetes history including current/past use of CGM, insulin pump, and other modes of 
diabetes technology.
Frequency of missed school days and Emergency Department visits due to decompensated diabetes 
(i.e., hyperglycemia, ketosis and DKA) over the past 6 months
Questionnaires will be administered, including:
a. Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ), which includes eight items, six of which 
form a scale (scored 0-36) in which higher scores indicate greater treatment satisfaction 
(Bradley, 1994). 
b. Nutrition Knowledge Survey (NKS) which collects information on healthful eating, carbohydrate 
counting, blood glucose response to foods, and nutrition label reading. Higher NKS scores reflect 
greater nutrition knowledge (score range is 0–100%) (Rovner 2012). 
c. Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS) is a 17-item scale that captures diabetes distress in 4 different 
areas, including emotional burden, regimen distress, interpersonal distress, and physician 
distress (Polonsky 2005).

Page 8 of 26Prior to the HRU/CSRU admission, we will recommend a standard diet be given and no food be eaten after 
9pm (except for in cases of hypoglycemia). Participants will be advised to limit exercise in the 3 days prior to 
study to limit acute effects of recent exercise on insulin sensitivity.
Visit 2: After at least [ADDRESS_1027411] may arrive at 7:[ADDRESS_1027412]’s temperature, blood pressure, and pulse. A urine pregnancy test will be performed and we will 
discuss the need for contraception during the VLCD portion of the study.  Two indwelling catheters will be 
placed, one into an antecubital vein for infusion of test substances and a second catheter into a 
contralateral vein for blood sampling. 
The study will begin with a ~[ADDRESS_1027413].  Blood draws for measurements of glucose and glycerol 
enrichment are listed in tables 2, 3, and 4.  
Subjects will be asked permission to allow the serum and information collected during this research study 
to be used for future research purposes. The serum samples may be used by [CONTACT_750411].
Fasting laboratory assessment:  Upon arrival, participants will have blood tests performed, 
including β-hydroxybutyrate, free fatty acids (FFA), glucagon, comprehensive metabolic panel, 
magnesium level.
Non-radioactive, Stable Isotope Tracer Infusions will be employed to assess rates of glucose and 
glycerol metabolism at the end of the ~150-minute baseline equilibration period. From -150 to 0 
min, 4.5 mg/kg of 6,6-2H2-glucose (99% enriched; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover MA) will 
be followed by a continuous infusion at 0.06 mg/kg/min. 2H5- glycerol will be infused at 1.6 μmol/kg 
followed by a constant infusion of 0.11 μmol/kg/min  to assess glycerol turnover. During the basal 
turnover period, a variable rate insulin infusion may be utilized to maintain plasma glucose between 
~80-120 mg/dL. As results from prior participants become available, infusions of the isotopes may 
be adjusted in subsequent participants to ensure enrichment is not too low for measurement.
Metabolite Collection: Samples for measurements of glucose and glycerol enrichment, as well as 
hormones and substrates, will be obtained every ~15-30 minutes of the baseline equilibration phase 
(see Table 2). Additional blood samples at baseline will be collected and used to derive additional 
metabolic risk markers of timely interest; specific uses are to be determined but will only be 
conducted after corresponding future protocol approvals.  Biomarkers collected as part of this 
research will be stored by [CONTACT_750412].  
Measures of Oxidation: Indirect calorimetry will be utilized at each HRU/CSRU visit to evaluate rates 
of glucose and fat oxidation.
Arginine Stimulation Test (AST):  An AST will be conducted as a gold-standard assessment of islet 
hormone secretion, specifically, that of glucagon through stimulation of α cells. At time 0, arginine 
will be administered (5g of 10% solution) over ~ 1 minute.  We will measure stimulated glucagon, 
glucose, ketone, and c-peptide levels after arginine stimulation.  Blood glucose samples will be taken

macrovascular complications of T1D. Thus, it is critical to investigate ways to improve control in adolescents 
(both male and female), the population with the poorest glycemic control across all age ranges. The proposed 
study will employ a novel method that may limit acute complications of T1D, as well as improve overall 
glycemic control. Such studies can only be carried out in adolescents, due to the unique characteristics of this 
cohort.

and/or study team member who will verify that the parent/caregiver meets inclusion/exclusion criteria.
11.Risks: 
Risks of Very Low Carbohydrate Diet:  Previous studies have suggested that switching to a very low 
carbohydrate diet can cause symptoms including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, constipation, fatigue, 
and lightheadedness.  These symptoms will be screened for at follow up visits throughout the study (see 
Table 1).
Hypoglycemia/Hyperglycemia: Participants in the study will be at risk of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. 
For this reason, during the HRU/CSRU admission, blood glucose levels are measured frequently throughout 
the study by a reliable device (YSI 2300) so that if needed, dextrose infusion can be utilized to prevent 
hypoglycemia. The study procedures may result in elevated or low glucose values. At the end of each visit, 
the participant will receive guidance for glucose monitoring, food intake, and insulin dosing as needed.  
During the study, dose adjustments will be made according to standard of care to prevent hypoglycemia and 
hyperglycemia. 
Stable isotopes: Despi[INVESTIGATOR_750393], our team has been 
using isotopes during studies for [ADDRESS_1027420] not experienced any adverse 
events.  
Risk of Indirect Calorimetry:  The air under the hood may become warm and stuffy, which some subjects find 
uncomfortable. Rarely, subjects may feel nauseated and/or claustrophobic while under the hood.
Risk of indwelling catheter: There are potential complications associated with indwelling catheters, including 
hematomas, discomfort, and rarely infection, thrombophlebitis, or bleeding at the catheter insertion site.
Anemia: The risk of anemia exists in studies with frequent blood draws. In our many years of performing 
studies we have not known any participants to experience this complication. The volume of blood draw at 
each visit will vary depending on the participant’s age and weight.  However, for children <18 years the 
maximum blood volume will not exceed 5 cc/kg body weight over a 1-month period.  The exact blood 
volumes collected may vary according to local IRB regulations.  The maximum blood volume collected from 
adults >18 years will not exceed 250cc over a 1-month period.
Risk of loss of confidentiality: As in any study, there is the potential for loss of confidentiality. Female 
subjects of childbearing potential will require urine pregnancy testing prior to enrollment in the protocol, 
and results of this testing have potential to result in loss of confidentiality. 
Risk of glycemic deterioration: It is possible that changing dietary requirements or insulin doses may result in 
glycemic deterioration.  Likewise, adolescents may have glycemic deterioration due to non-compliance.

Page 13 of 26Risk of CGM: Participants have the option of using FDA approved CGM as part of clinical care in our clinics. 
There is a low risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a local skin infection at the site of the sensor needle placement. Itchiness, 
redness, mild bleeding, and or bruising may occur at the insertion site. Subjects may develop localized 
reactions to adhesive used to secure the sensor. 
Risk of study questionnaires:  Participants may experience some distress when discussing factors important 
to diabetes, diabetes management, and psychosocial stressors
Arginine Stimulation Test:  Intravenous infusion of glucose may cause venous irritation (phlebitis) or less 
commonly infiltration of the surrounding tissues, both which may be discomforting. Intravenously 
administered arginine may cause a transient metallic taste in the mouth, and less often a transient 
sensation of warmth or nausea; allergy is rare.  
Minimizing Risks:
Risks of Very Low Carbohydrate Diet:  In order to minimize the symptoms associated with transitioning 
to a low carbohydrate diet abruptly, participants will be slowly transitioned over 1 week to help them 
acclimate and avoid unwanted symptoms.
Hypoglycemia/Hyperglycemia: Participants will be contact[CONTACT_750414].  
Blood draws will be done frequently during the HRU or CSRU admission to minimize hypoglycemia and 
hyperglycemia.  Intravenous glucose will be available in case hypoglycemia occurs.  All infusates 
containing insulin are prepared under a filtration cabinet (Laminated HLDA filter) by a qualified member 
of the research team using sterile disposable materials.
Participants will be encouraged to monitor closely for signs of glycemic deterioration and will be able to 
contact [CONTACT_750415].  
At the end of each visit, the participant will receive guidance for glucose monitoring, food intake, and 
insulin dosing as needed.  
During the study, insulin doses will be adjusted regularly (2-3 times per week as needed) to prevent 
hypoglycemia.  Participants will use a real-time CGM that will provide alerts at the time of hypoglycemia 
and allow for early detection of hypoglycemia as well.  Participants will be trained on treatment of 
hypoglycemia and to contact [CONTACT_750416].
If any subject has 2 epi[INVESTIGATOR_116651], they will be transitioned to a regular diet after the 
2nd epi[INVESTIGATOR_66677].
Stable isotopes: Isotopes will be carefully monitored, administered and will be prepared in the 
investigational pharmacy to ensure proper technique.  As noted in previous protocols using this stable 
isotope, the pyrogenicity and sterility of the isotopes are documented by [CONTACT_750417].  Methods to Ensure Compound Sterility and Pyrogenicity:  All stable 
isotopes are purchased from Cambridge Isotopes ([LOCATION_011], MA) and are sent to us sterile and pyrogen-
free as specified in the certification form of analysis that is attached to each order.  In addition, all 
infusates containing the isotope that will be used in the study are prepared by [CONTACT_750418] (IDS) by [CONTACT_750419] (0.22µ).  Furthermore, we also use microfilters at the end of 
each syringe as another safety precaution.  All stable isotopes are stored by [CONTACT_750420].  
Risk of Indirect Calorimetry:  Potential feelings related to wearing the “hood” will be discussed with 
participants ahead of time, if participants become uncomfortable while wearing the hood it will be 
removed.
Arginine Stimulation Test: Intravenously administered arginine may cause a transient metallic taste in 
the mouth, and less often a transient sensation of warmth or nausea; allergy is rare.  
Risk of indwelling catheter: IV insertion will be performed by [CONTACT_750421]/CSRU. 
Trained nurses will use aseptic technique to insert the IV catheters. We will minimize the risk of pain by

Page [ADDRESS_1027421].
Anemia: Samples will be obtained with the minimum necessary blood volume. The point of care YSI 
glucose determinations require only 0.3ml of blood. We will ensure that blood volume obtained does 
not exceed a maximum of 5mL/kg in pediatric participants and 250 mL in adult participants.  
Risk of loss of confidentiality: All study staff are HIPPA certified. Participant names and study records will 
be kept confidential. The IRB may inspect study records at any given time. All efforts will be made to 
maintain the participants’ privacy. Each participant will be assigned a study ID code and data will be 
linked by [CONTACT_750422], initials, social security numbers, or other personal 
identifiers. Paper documents will be stored in locked areas accessible only to authorized staff. All 
electronic data files will be protected by [CONTACT_750423] a 
legitimate responsibility for data entry or management. This ensures that, in the unlikely event that any 
primary data sources from this study are lost or misplaced, it will not be possible to identify the study

subjects to coded information, but this link will be kept secure and available only to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_750394].  
Risk of CGM: Risks of glucose sensor insertion will be minimized because participants will be instructed 
to cleanse skin aseptically prior to insertion.  Participants will receive training on sensor use if they have 
not used the sensor previously.
Risk of study questionnaires:  Study staff and social work will be contact[CONTACT_750425].

2. The risks associated with the current study are deemed greater than minimal for the following 
reasons: (choose those that apply)
1. We do not view the risks associated with the arginine infusion as minimal risks.
2. Given the now established safety and validity of the current isotope infusions and arginine 
stimulation tests in our prior work, we do not view the proposed studies as high risk.
Although we have assessed the proposed study as one of greater than minimal risk, the potential exists 
for anticipated and/or unanticipated adverse events, serious or otherwise, to occur since it is not possible 
to predict with certainty the absolute risk in any given individual or in advance of first-hand experience 
with the proposed study methods. Therefore, we provide a plan for monitoring the data and safety of the 
proposed study as follows:
3. Attribution of Adverse Events:
Adverse events will be monitored for each subject participating in the study and attributed to the study 
procedures / design by [CONTACT_458] (Insert Investigator Name) according to the following 
categories:
a.) Definite: Adverse event is clearly related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
b.) Probable: Adverse event is likely related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
c.) Possible: Adverse event may be related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
d.) Unlikely: Adverse event is likely not to be related to the investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
e.) Unrelated: Adverse event is clearly not related to investigational procedures(s)/agent(s).
4. Plan for Grading Adverse Events:
The following scale will be used in grading the severity of adverse events noted during the study:
1. Mild adverse event
2. Moderate adverse event
3. Severe 
5. Plan for Determining Seriousness of Adverse Events:
Serious Adverse Events:
In addition to grading the adverse event, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_22414] a Serious Adverse Event (SAE).  An adverse event is considered serious if it results in any of 
the following outcomes:
1. Death;

3. A persistent or significant disability or incapacity; 
4. A congenital anomaly or birth defect; OR
5. Any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the 
subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in this definition. 
An adverse event may be graded as severe but still not meet the criteria for a Serious Adverse Event.  
Similarly, an adverse event may be graded as moderate but still meet the criteria for an SAE.  It is 
important for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_22415] “seriousness” when determining 
whether reporting to the IRB is necessary.
6. Plan for reporting UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865] (including Adverse Events) to the IRB
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_22416]: 
Any incident, experience or outcome that meets ALL 3 of the following criteria:
1. Is unexpected (in terms of nature, specificity, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved protocol 
and informed consent document and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being 
studied; AND 
2. Is related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_9156]); AND
3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, legal, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized.
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]) may be medical or non-
medical in nature, and include – but are not limited to – serious, unexpected, and related adverse 
events and unanticipated adverse device effects.  Please note that adverse events are reportable to the 
IRB as UPI[INVESTIGATOR_22417] 3 criteria listed above.
These UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865]/SAEs will be reported to the IRB in accordance with IRB Policy 710, using the 
appropriate forms found on the website. All related events involving risk but not meeting the prompt 
reporting requirements described in IRB Policy [ADDRESS_1027422] to oversight by a DSMB (or other monitoring entity that is monitoring the study on behalf of an

As a limited alternative to the above requirement, will you use the short form* for consenting process if you 
unexpectedly encounter a non-English speaking individual interested in study participation and the translation 
of the long form is not possible prior to intended enrollment?  YES ☒  NO ☐
Note* If more than [ADDRESS_1027428] speaking that 
language is to be enrolled.
Several translated short form templates are available on the HRPP website (yale.edu/hrpp) and translated HIPAA 
Research Authorization Forms are available on the HIPAA website (hipaa.yale.edu). If the translation of the short 
form is not available on our website, then the translated short form needs to be submitted to the IRB office for 
approval via modification prior to enrolling the subject.   Please review the guidance and presentation on use of

eligibility for study participation.
2. How will the research data be collected, recorded and stored? Clinical research forms will be created to allow 
for collection of data from schools and for study visits. Our study team is very experienced in collecting data 
and maintaining study databases, as we regularly conduct clinical trials. Study records will be maintained 
in Microsoft Excel databases, on university computers which are encrypted and served by a regular back up 
service. All study staff, office, and computers are HIPPA compliant.  
3. How will the digital data be stored? ☐CD  ☐DVD  ☐Flash Drive  ☐Portable Hard Drive   ☒Secured Server  ☒
Laptop Computer  ☐Desktop Computer  ☐Other
4. What methods and procedures will be used to safeguard the confidentiality and security of the identifiable 
study data and the storage media indicated above during and after the subject’s participation in the study? 
The list of names of the study subjects and their assigned code numbers will be kept in a locked file cabinet 
or password-protected computer file by [CONTACT_38991].  Individual patient medical information 
obtained as a result of this study is considered confidential and disclosure to third parties other than those 
noted below is prohibited.  Such medical information may be given to the patient’s personal physician or 
to other appropriate medical personnel responsible for the patient’s welfare. All individuals involved in the 
conduct of this study will be trained on HIPAA privacy regulations and will receive human subject protection 
training. The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_750397].
All portable devices must contain encryption software, per University Policy 5100.  If there is a technical reason a 
device cannot be encrypted please submit an exception request to the Information Security, Policy and 
Compliance Office by [CONTACT_20912]://its.yale.edu/egrc or email [EMAIL_364]
5. What will be done with the data when the research is completed? Are there plans to destroy the identifiable 
data? If yes, describe how, by [CONTACT_22467]. If no, describe how the data 
and/or identifiers will be secured. It is likely that data from this study will be published in scientific and 
medical journals and presented at scientific and medical conferences. In all such cases, project data will be 
presented in such a way that no participant could possibly be identified. Data will be de-identified at end 
of study prior to study termination.

SECTION V: POTENTIAL BENEFITS
Potential Benefits: Identify any benefits that may be reasonably expected to result from the research, either to 
the subject(s) or to society at large. (Payment of subjects is not considered a benefit in this context of the risk 
benefit assessment.) 
Participants may experience improved glycemic control by [CONTACT_6231].  
Long-term benefits of this research are a generalizable understanding of the changes of insulin resistance 
related to obesity and puberty in youth with T1D, which will help to inform future treatment strategies.

Page 24 of 26         SECTION VI: RESEARCH ALTERNATIVES AND ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS
1.Alternatives: What other alternatives are available to the study subjects outside of the research? 
The alternative to participating in this study is non-participation. Subjects who choose not to participate 
may continue their normal care in the Yale Pediatric Diabetes Program. There are no risks of non-
participation.
2.Payments for Participation (Economic Considerations): Describe any payments that will be made to 
subjects, the amount and schedule of payments, and the conditions for receiving this compensation.
Part 1:  Participants will receive a total of $75 total for participating in the full study.
Part 2:  To help offset the cost of the subjects’ participation in the study, they will receive $50 for 
each of the HRU/CSRU visits.  For each day that the participants take photos of their food and 
speak with study staff regarding dietary recall, they will receive $5. The total compensation a 
subject could potentially earn is $160.  
3.Costs for Participation (Economic Considerations): The costs of all study-specific equipment, such as the 
blood ketone meter and ketone test strips, will be covered by [CONTACT_1758]. Since continuous glucose monitors, 
glucometers and glucose test strips are part of routine diabetes care, these will be prescribed.  Clinical lab 
HbA1c is standard of care and will be billed through the participant’s insurance and will not be covered by 
[CONTACT_1758]. 
 
4.In Case of Injury: This section is required for any research involving more than minimal risk, and for minimal 
risk research that presents the potential for physical harm (e.g., research involving blood draws).
a. Will medical treatment be available if research-related injury occurs? Yes
b. Where and from whom may treatment be obtained? Research staff or YNHH staff if necessary
a. Are there any limits to the treatment being provided? Injuries caused directly by 
[CONTACT_9286]. There will be no payment for lost wages and/or direct or 
indirect losses.
a. Who will pay for this treatment? Subjects will be responsible for the costs of such medical 
care that is not covered by [CONTACT_750438].
a. How will the medical treatment be accessed by [CONTACT_1766]? By [CONTACT_750439], the overseeing physician and the study nurse 
will attend to the immediate needs of the patient. Should any acute care visit (i.e. emergency 
room or outpatient clinic), hospi[INVESTIGATOR_750398], the subject’s medical 
insurance will be responsible for covering any incurred charges.

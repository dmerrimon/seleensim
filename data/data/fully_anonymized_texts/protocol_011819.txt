 
Effect of Fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_61656]  
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
June 25, [ADDRESS_66497]-operative nausea and vomiting, 
and works by [CONTACT_61670] "substance P", which is found in the brain and spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]. Theoretically, fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_61657] P,  but it is not known if this actually occurs. The drug will be given 
after the patient has been anesthetized but before surgical incision so that if there are any 
changes on the intraoperative neuromonitoring signals they can only be att ributed to 
fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053].  
b. Objectives 
If fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_61658], it would be important because anesthesiologist's who administer this drug would want to give it at the beginning of surgery when changes in intraoperative neuromonitoring signals would be unlikely to mean that these changes 
were due to surgical damage to the nervous system.  
c. Rationale for Research in Humans 
We are specifically interested in evaluating if fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_61659]. 
2. STUDY PROCEDURES  
a. Procedures  
On the day of surgery the patient will be consented in the preoperative area. We regularly use fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_61660]. 
June 25, 2019   Page 2 of 7  
The patient will receive a single dose of 150 mg intravenous fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_61661]. Intraoperat ive neuromonitoring 
signals will be monitored for any changes during and after the administration of fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053].  
 The patient's intraoperative anesthetic management will be that typi[INVESTIGATOR_61662]. 
b. Procedure Risks  
Using fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_61663]. This study will no withhold medication used to treat post-
operative nausea and vomiting, rather, it seeks to determine if ut ilizing this very safe and 
effective medication during surgical procedures under general anesthesia with intraoperative neuromonitoring will alter or change intraoperative neuromonitoring 
signals due to the mechanism of action of the drug. 
c. Use of Deception  in the Study  
No deception will be used. 
d. Use of Audio and Video Recordings  
No audio or video will be recorded. 
e. Alternative Procedures or Courses of Treatment  
At this point the use of fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_61664] . The effect of this medication on intraoperative neuromonitoring signals 
in patients having surgery under general anesthesia is not understood. No standard 
treatment is being withheld.  
f. Will it be possible to continue the more (most) appropriate therapy fo r the 
participant(s) after the conclusion of the study?  
After surgery the primary surgery team is free to utilize any nausea and vomiting control 
scheme they would like to use.  
g. Study Endpoint (s) 
Our study endpoint is whether a single dose of fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_61665], and to quantify any such 
changes.

8. PARTICIPANT POPULATION  
a. Planned E nrollment  
The total number of participants expected to enroll is 50.  Patients presenting for surgery under general anesthesia with intraoperative 
neuromonitoring will be approached to participant in this study. 
 All participants will be at Stanford University Medical Center.  
 
We selected this patient population because we are particularly interested in knowing 
what effects, if any, fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_61668].

Enrollment of laboratory personnel, employees, and/or students would be purely coincidental. No payment will be provided for participation. 
f. Healthy Volunteer s 
No healthy volunteers will be enrolled in this study. Only patients coming to Stanford University Medical  Center for surgery requiring general anesthesia and intraoperative 
neuromonitoring will be approached to participate. 
g. Recruitment Details  
Patients co ming to Stanford University Medical  Center for surgery requiring general 
anesthesia and intraoperative neuromonitoring will be approached to participate.  
h. Eligibility Criteria  
i. Inclusion Criteria 
Patients presenting to Stanford University Medical  Center for su rgery requiring 
general anesthesia with intraoperative neuromonitoring will be approached to 
participate.  
ii. Exclusion Criteria 
Exclusion criteria include patient refusal or inability to consent to this study, or a 
contraindication to receiving fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053].  
i. Screening Procedures

j. Participation in Multiple Protocols  
Patients will be asked about participation in other studies. Enrollment in other studies that don't interfere with this study is acceptable. Surgical patients are frequently asked by [CONTACT_61672]. This is done 
during surgery and does not in any way interfere with this study.

m. Planned Duration of the Study  
One year. The total time requirement for each participant is minimal. It includes the time 
to get informed consent.
